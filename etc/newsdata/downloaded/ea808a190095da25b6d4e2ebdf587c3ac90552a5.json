It would have cost you $292. But with a Groupon, you spend $59.\n\nDeals such as this can be a big help if you\u2019re paying out of pocket and are uninsured.\n\nAnd more people are apparently falling into that category.\n\nA new report from the U.S. Census Bureau said that in 2018, 27 million people in the United States didn\u2019t have health insurance. That\u2019s up nearly 8 percent from the previous year.\n\nWhat\u2019s in it for doctors, dentists?\n\nAlex Zlatin, a business consultant who advises struggling dentists, says offers such as Groupons are largely about marketing and growing their practices.\n\n\u201cIf a Groupon deal brings 200 to 300 new patients through the door, let\u2019s say 50 of them and their families become long-term patients. Each patient on average is about a thousand dollars billed per treatment in a year,\u201d Zlatin told Healthline. \u201cSo even though you\u2019re not making a lot of money on the deal, some of them will become lifetime patients.\u201d\n\nGroupon didn\u2019t respond to requests from Healthline for comments on how many medical services are being bought, if the number is on the rise, or how the company\u2019s fee structure works.\n\nZlatin said that more recently, Groupon has apparently changed the way it does business.\n\n\u201cIn the past, they would only work with vendors who would offer products at huge discounts and split whatever revenue comes in 50/50,\u201d he said. \u201cNow they basically negotiate a different deal with each vendor in order for it to make sense for everybody, so it\u2019s a win-win.\u201d\n\nSome deals are controversial\n\nIt\u2019s not just dental exams and cleanings.\n\nIn some parts of the country, you can find Groupon deals for tests for serious medical conditions.\n\nOne in Southern California, for example, offers a heart scan for $148. That\u2019s a discount of 57 percent off the original $350 cost of the procedure.\n\nExperts say when it comes to those kinds of diagnostic tests, consumers should keep a few things in mind. That\u2019s especially true if your state doesn\u2019t require a doctor\u2019s order to get the test.\n\n\u201cRun it by your primary care physician or specialist first to see if he or she thinks it\u2019s reasonable to get the study,\u201d said Andrew Bierhals, MD, a radiology safety expert at Washington University St. Louis\u2019 Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology.\n\n\u201cWith certain types of studies, there\u2019s ionizing radiation or radiation. So there\u2019s risk, although the risk is very low,\u201d Dr. Bierhals told Healthline. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t need the study, you can make your risk zero.\u201d\n\n\u201cMake sure you go to facilities that have been approved or accredited by the American College of Radiology or some kind of oversight agency,\u201d he added. \u201cConfirm that their equipment is up to standards and that the people performing the tests meet minimal standards so things are done correctly.\u201d\n\n\u201cSometimes a hospital or doctor will want to repeat a test to look for something specific. That means you could\u2019ve actually wasted your money, even though you got a good \u2018deal\u2019 on it,\u201d he said.\n\nNot the only game in town\n\nMDsave is another organization offering medical services via discount vouchers.\n\nThe company partners with local hospitals and doctors to offer bundled services.\n\nMost tests require a doctor\u2019s order and the person\u2019s doctor is expected to follow up.\n\nPaul Ketchel, the chief executive officer and founder of MDsave, told Healthline the company is working to make health care more efficient and more affordable for their clients.\n\nHe said the upfront pricing is attractive to consumers and the prepayments are attractive to providers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re willing to offer better prices since patients pay before their visit, so there\u2019s no need to bill, and no risk of not getting paid,\u201d Ketchel said.\n\n\u201cWe see ourselves as disruptors because when it comes to consumerism in health care, we\u2019re pioneers in the field,\u201d he said.\n\nChanging the healthcare landscape?\n\n\u201cOverall, I don\u2019t think this will have a major impact on the health care landscape,\u201d said Nick Sawyer, MD, an assistant clinical professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of California, Davis.\n\nHe wrote a report called In the U.S. \u2018Healthcare\u2019 Is Now Strictly a Business Term for the Western Journal of Emergency Medicine.\n\n\u201cI do, however, think it\u2019s a good example of how our health care delivery system is in dire need of close review by knowledgeable, empathetic policymakers who understand how high health care costs are harming patients,\u201d Dr. Sawyer told Healthline.\n\n\u201cThey must be willing to make the changes needed to ensure that all patients have access to timely, high-quality health care,\u201d he said.\n\nClick here to get more from HealthLine.com.", "description": "Groupon and other online entities are now offering deals for a variety of medical and dental services.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/blood_test_istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
