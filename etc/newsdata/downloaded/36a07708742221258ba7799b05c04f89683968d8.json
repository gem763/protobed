Return them where you bought them for a refund\n\nA total of 10 people have been struck down with salmonella in New South Wales, making it the worst affected state.\n\nNSW Health issued a recall notice on Saturday.\n\nSpokesman Jeremy McAnulty warned that people may have to be hospitalised to manage dehydration from severe salmonellosis.\n\nYoung babies, elderly people and those with weakened immune systems are most at risk, he said in a release on NSW Health's website.\n\n'Salmonellosis symptoms include fever, headache, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting,' Dr McAnulty said.\n\n'Symptoms ... usually last for four to seven days, but can continue for much longer.\n\nCore Powerfoods Muay Thai meatballs are among the range recalled due to salmonella risk\n\n'It is important that people do not prepare food for others while they are unwell with salmonellosis and as a precaution for 48 hours after symptoms have passed.'\n\nDr McAnulty said thorough cooking kills salmonella bacteria, but microwaves can heat food unevenly if not used correctly.\n\n'The longer food is left at room temperature the more the Salmonella bacteria will multiply,' he said.\n\n'Refrigerated food should be kept at less than 5C and hot food should be kept above 60C.'\n\nSeismic Chicken, Holy Meatballs and Smokey Mountain Meatballs are all recalled. NSW Health says heat kills bacteria but microwave heating can be uneven, causing salmonella risk\n\nThe affected products have date markings of Best Before 26/08/2020 to 4/10/2020 inclusive.\n\nThe products have been on sale at Coles Supermarkets nationally and IGA supermarkets in New South Wales, ACT, Victoria and the Northern Territory.\n\nThey have also been on sale at independent retailers in all states and territories except Tasmania.\n\nConsumers have been urged to return the products to the place of purchase for a full refund.\n\nIf you have concerns about your health, seek medical advice.\n\nFor more information, contact Core Ingredients on 1300 133 728.", "description": "A line of frozen meals has been recalled after 15 cases of a rare strain of salmonella poisoning known as Salmonella Weltevedreden were reported nationally.", "authors": ["Alison Bevege And Aap For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/05/19976288-0-image-a-16_1571632933880.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
