Your options might include a 401(k) plan or a 457(b) plan. Both plans allow you to contribute money towards retirement on a tax-deferred basis. While there are similarities between a 457(b) and a 401(k), there are also key differences to keep in mind. Those variations can affect how a plan will work for you and your retirement.\n\nWhat Is a 457(b) Plan and How Does It Work?\n\nA 457(b) plan is a non-qualified, deferred compensation plan. It typically is offered to state and local government employees, as well as employees of certain tax-exempt organizations. The kinds of employees who may have access to a 457(b) through their employer include:\n\nTeachers (public school).\n\nLaw enforcement officers.\n\nFirefighters and emergency services workers.\n\nCity and county employees.\n\nState, county and local government officials.\n\nIn terms of how a 457(b) plan works, it\u2019s very similar to a 401(k) when it comes to who makes contributions, how much they can contribute and the tax treatment of those contributions. For 2019, workers with a 457(b) plan can contribute up to $19,000 to their account through elective salary deferrals. Workers age 50 or older can add $6,000 in catch-up contributions, bringing the total annual contribution to $25,000.\n\nThis money grows tax-deferred meaning no taxes are owed on investment earnings until money is withdrawn. An employer can designate a 457 account as a Roth account with after-tax contribution. Those contributions wouldn\u2019t be deductible from taxable income, the way they would with a traditional 457(b). But employees would benefit from tax-free distributions in retirement.\n\nSpecial Rules for 457(b) Plans\n\nTwo attributes make these accounts different from 401(k) plans. First, employer matching contributions are typically less common with 457(b) plans. If an employer makes a matching contribution, those contributions plus the employee\u2019s can\u2019t exceed the total annual contribution limit. If your employer contributes $5,000 to your plan for 2019, your contribution limit is $14,000 for the year. That only changes if you\u2019re 50 or older.\n\nAlso, 457(b) accounts allow for special catch-up contributions for workers three years away from normal retirement age. Those employees can contribute the lesser of twice the annual contribution limit (which would be $38,000 total for 2019) or the regular annual limit, plus the amount of the annual contribution limit not used in prior years. The latter is allowed only if the employee isn\u2019t using the standard 50-or-older catch-up contributions.\n\nWhat Is a 401(k) Plan and How Does It Work?\n\nA 401(k) is the most popular type of qualified retirement plan offered by employers. Any company can offer one of these plans to their employees, including government and non-government organizations. The annual contribution limits for 401(k) plans are identical to those allowed for 457(b) plans.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s more common for employers to make matching contributions to these accounts. With a 401(k) match, the employer can determine what percentage of employees\u2019 income to match. They\u2019re not restricted by the annual contribution limit.\n\nA traditional 401(k) grows tax-deferred, with withdrawals taxed at your ordinary tax rate in retirement. Some employers offer a Roth 401(k) option. The biggest catch of these plans is a 10% penalty for early withdrawals, on top of regular income tax.\n\nYour plan may allow for loans, and the limits for borrowing are the same as 457(b) plans. With either plan, failure to repay the loan in full means the amount becomes a taxable distribution. The difference is that if you\u2019re under age 59.5 at the time of the distribution, you\u2019d only pay the 10% early withdrawal penalty if the money comes from your 401(k).\n\nPros and Cons of Saving In a 457(b)\n\nHere we analyze the differences between the 457-vs-401k retirement plans. More\n\nOne of the main advantages of saving in this type of account is that it\u2019s a non-qualified plan. This means that it\u2019s not subject to the same withdrawal rules as a 401(k).\n\nThey aren\u2019t technically retirement plans and don\u2019t come with early withdrawals penalties. In other words, you can take money from your account at any time. Withdrawls prior to or after retirement don\u2019t trigger a penalty based on age. You would, however, pay regular income tax on those withdrawals, unless you have a designated Roth account. That means more flexibility if you need money for an emergency, to pay for college expenses or to buy a home.\n\nStory continues", "description": "When saving for retirement, your employer may give you a hand by offering a tax-advantaged savings plan.
