I think people all over the world are really suffering,\u201d Harry said.\n\nSheeran agreed, saying he had been working on a song to tackle the issue and \u201cget it out to more people.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople just don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like for people like us,\u201d he added. \u201cWell, you know with, like, the jokes and the snide comments. I just feel like it\u2019s time we stood up and said: \u2018We\u2019re not going to take this anymore.\u2019 We are ginger, and we\u2019re gonna fight.\u201d\n\nHarry quickly responded: \u201cUm, ok, um. Slightly awkward. This might have been a miscommunication, but this is about World Mental Health Day.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. Of course. I definitely knew that,\u201d Sheeran said, hastily deleting the content of a computer document titled, \u201cGINGERS UNITE.\u201d\n\nHarry ended the video with a serious message:\n\n\u201cGuys, this World Mental Health Day. Reach out. Make sure that your friends, strangers \u2014 look out for anybody that might be suffering in silence. We\u2019re all in this together.\u201d\n\nHarry revealed in 2017 that he had sought mental health support from a counselor after years of not thinking about the 1997 death of his mother, Princess Diana.\n\n\u201cYou need to know that part of being strong and tough is having the courage to seek help when you need it,\u201d he said during a royal tour of Australia last year. \u201cYou must not silently suffer. You are all in this together.\u201d", "description": "It's a comical case of misunderstanding in the clip that the Duke of Sussex and the singer put out to mark World Mental Health Day.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9f184220000058074ff372.png?cache=qydidb3zim&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
