If so, you may feel extremely seen by Netflix\u2019s latest horror film. Starring Charlie Shotwell, Max Martini, Sadie Sink, Lili Taylor, and Kelly Reilly, and directed by Ciar\u00e1n Foy, Eli tells the story of an 11-year-old boy with a mysterious illness that causes him to break out in an excruciating rash on contact with the outside world. Forced to live life behind glass, or in a blue hazmat suit, our sickly protagonist is delivered to a doctor to undergo a series of experimental treatments in a clinically-clean safe house.\n\n\n\nIt that wasn\u2019t creepy enough by itself, the real horror comes during these procedures themselves. The poor boy is routinely strapped down and pumped with injections and pills that only make his sickness worse. Oh, and that coincides with a totally coincidental uptick in paranormal activity in his squeaky clean prison. Even when writing literally appears on the wall (well, window), Eli is held at the facility under the guise of the obvious lie that \u2018you\u2019re meant to get worse before you get better\u2019. Yikes.\n\nAll in all, it looks positively nightmarish. Perfect watching for when you\u2019re next bedbound after breaking out in hives from breathing the air outside your house.\n\nThis article originally appeared on i-D UK.", "description": "The horror film deals with an eleven-year-old who\u2019s literally allergic to the world.
