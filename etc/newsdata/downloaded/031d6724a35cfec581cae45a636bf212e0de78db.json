After the break we did it better.\u201d\n\nThe Germans, missing half a dozen injured players, seemed to lack a clear game plan in the first half with plenty of passing but struggling to find ways to open up the Irish defence.\n\nLoew\u2019s young team, looking to recover from last year\u2019s shock first-round World Cup exit and Nations League relegation, have not had enough match practice and it showed.\n\n\u201cWe had never played before with this line-up,\u201d Loew said. \u201cSo we will need some patience because this a learning process.\u201d\n\nConor Washington had a golden chance to put the hosts ahead in the seventh minute when he pounced on a rare Toni Kroos mistake but fired straight at charging goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.\n\nTimo Werner had the visitors\u2019 best chance before the break but his close-range effort was saved by Bailey Peacock-Farrell.\n\nGermany looked to be feeling the effects of Friday\u2019s loss with the Irish working hard to stifle their attacks early.\n\n\u201cWe managed to stop them building the game and got joy off pressing and winning the ball higher up the pitch,\u201d the hosts\u2019 coach Michael O\u2019Neill told Sky.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to do that against this level of opposition. I\u2019m proud of what they gave.\u201d\n\nHalstenberg eventually settled German nerves, timing his half-volley to perfection as he angled Julian Brandt\u2019s cross into the far corner just after the break.\n\nThey should have scored again in a scintillating start to the second half but instead had to wait until deep into stoppage for Gnabry to make sure of the three points.", "description": "Germany beat hosts Northern Ireland 2-0 on Monday with two goals in the second half to get their Euro 2020 qualification on track as they bounced back from last week's loss to the Netherlands to take over top spot in Group C.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428240565&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF890KA-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
