Other companies or individuals can be found to have violated the statute if they act within the territory of the U.S.\n\nMr. Hoskins was a British national who worked in suburban Paris and never set foot in the U.S. during his three years at Alstom, Mr. Silver said. Prosecutors were trying to fit a square peg into a round hole, he said.\n\nProsecutors allege that Mr. Hoskins acted as an agent of Alstom Power Inc., a former Alstom subsidiary in Windsor, Conn. Alstom sold its power business to General Electric Co. in 2015, after agreeing to pay $772 million to resolve the FCPA probe.\n\nLawyers for Mr. Hoskins have disputed prosecutors\u2019 characterization of his role at Alstom and what it means to be an agent under the statute, which doesn\u2019t define the term.\n\nThe former executive didn\u2019t work for the Windsor, Conn., subsidiary, Mr. Silver said during his opening argument Monday. Instead, his job in part consisted of approving requests by Alstom subsidiaries to hire outside consultants, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen it came to hiring outside agents, Lawrence got to tell Alstom Power Inc. what to do,\u201d Mr. Silver said. Mr. Hoskins was never under the subsidiary\u2019s control, he said.\n\nThe former Alstom executive previously asked to have the bulk of the charges against him thrown out before trial on similar grounds, but a judge overseeing the case said the nature of his role at Alstom was a factual matter that had to be determined by a jury.\n\nMr. Hoskins\u2019s lawyers also tried to portray the former executive as a scapegoat. \u201cGuilt by association is exactly what the government is trying to prove here,\u201d Mr. Silver told jurors. Mr. Hoskins didn\u2019t stand to gain financially from the bribery scheme, he said.\n\nA prosecutor on Monday said Mr. Hoskins was much more central to the scheme. One of his roles was to help Alstom Power bribe government officials to win contracts by finding the right middlemen, said Lorinda Laryea, an assistant chief in the Justice Department\u2019s FCPA unit.\n\nAlstom called the middlemen it hired consultants, but they were essentially bagmen, she said. Executives sometimes used codewords like \u201ccandy\u201d to describe the bribes, she added.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2009, Alstom paid nearly $2 million to two consultants in Indonesia, who in turn paid bribes to officials at the country\u2019s state-owned energy company and a key member of its parliament, Izedrik Emir Moeis, Ms. Laryea said.\n\nMr. Moeis was convicted in Indonesia for taking bribes from Alstom.\n\nMr. Hoskins\u2019s trial will resume Tuesday with the cross examination of David Rothschild, a former executive of Alstom Power.\n\nMr. Rothschild, who was interviewed by the FBI in 2010 after he was laid off by Alstom and agreed to record conversations with other current and former executives, previously pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the FCPA.\n\nWrite to Dylan Tokar at dylan.tokar@wsj.com", "description": "A former Alstom executive mounted a direct challenge to the long reach of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act on Monday, the first day of a trial in a case that has raised legal questions about who is subject to the foreign bribery law.", "authors": ["Dylan Tokar"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-121537/social", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
