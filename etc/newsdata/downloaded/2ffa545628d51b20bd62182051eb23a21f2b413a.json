Carl Cole via Storyful, Lafayette Daily Advertiser\n\nNEW ORLEANS \u2013 On Saturday morning, structural engineer Walter Zehner\u2019s phone rang with news of a devastating construction collapse on a site he once worked.\n\nThe plan for 1031 Canal St. had completely changed since Zehner left the project approximately three years ago, moving from a mixed use retail/residential design to what was planned to be a Hard Rock Hotel.\n\nWhen Zehner arrived at the downtown construction site Saturday, he saw six to eight concrete levels had collapsed, the edges hanging down the side of the building as if they\u2019d melted.\n\n\u201cIt was a lot worse than I could have imagined,\u201d Zehner said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve seen the videos of the collapse and it\u2019s kind of hard to figure out exactly what was going on there.\"\n\nIn his career, Zehner has designed complex structures such as the Astor Crowne Plaza in the French Quarter, which he said is \u201cvery similar\u201d to the planned Hard Rock Hotel.\n\nBut he\u2019s also spent time as a trial witness tasked with explaining exactly how a build go wrong.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like problem solving, like being a detective,\u201d Zehner said. \u201cI\u2019m sure eventually I\u2019m going to be called by somebody\u2019s attorney to help them on this one.\u201d\n\nHard Rock Hotel collapse: Witness describes 'mind boggling' construction collapse in New Orleans\n\n'Very dangerous situation': Two dead, one still missing after Hard Rock hotel collapse\n\nAs local and federal authorities attempt to determine what could have caused the building to crumble, which resulted in two deaths, Zehner said an investigation would begin with examining the original plans to see if it was designed properly. If the design is sound, the investigation will move to examining the construction process.\n\n\"The one thing I find hard to understand is the collapse started at the rear of the building (by Rampart and Iberville streets) but it wound up, you had collapsed slabs all the way on the front end of the build, which is 300 feet away (on Canal Street),\" he said. \"So I don\u2019t know how that progression worked like that. I guess that\u2019s part of what the investigation is going to reveal.\u201d\n\nThis aerial photo shows the Hard Rock Hotel in New Orleans, which was under construction, after a fatal partial collapse on Saturday, Oct. 12, 2019. (Photo: Gerald Herbert, AP)\n\nWhile he believes it\u2019s too early to have an answer as to what caused the collapse, the spread of damage around the edge of the property \u201ccertainly raises questions\u201d for Zehner.\n\n\u201cLogically, it doesn\u2019t make sense it would happen that way. There\u2019s got to be a reason for that to happen, and that's going to be part of the investigation,\u201d he said.\n\nZehner heard the rumors of too heavy a load being placed atop the building or of a vehicle nudging a column. The city also experienced a drop in temperature between Friday and Saturday, but Zehner said the 11-degree swing was likely not drastic enough to affect building materials.\n\n\u201cIdeas have been tossed out that some kind of activity in the building might have caused it. Probably makes more sense than anything, and I think it\u2019s a matter of finding out what was going on at that time. There were people working. What were they doing that could have contributed to this?\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s kind of early on before anyone can start speculating what the actual cause was.\u201d\n\nCLOSE Welder David Hensley was inside the Hard Rock Hotel construction when it collapsed in New Orleans on Oct. 12, 2019. Andrew J. Yawn, Montgomery Advertiser\n\nThe $85 million project\u2019s design is now helmed by architecture firm Harry Baker Smith and constructed by Citadel Builders. Kailas Companies acquired the property for $3.6 million in 2007, though it wasn\u2019t until 2018 that the project was announced as a Hard Rock Hotel.\n\nThere have been questions in the aftermath of the collapse as to whether the site was properly inspected and up to date on all permits.\n\nNew Orleans Director of Homeland Security Colin Arnold said that is being investigated.\n\nThere is no evidence that an ongoing federal corruption investigation focusing on the Department of Safety and Permits is connected to the Hard Rock Hotel project. But the agency has dealt with the challenges such cases present.\n\nOne city inspector was indicted two months ago after being accused of accepting bribes for favorable inspection reports between 2012 and 2019, and in September, two from the office were suspended in conjunction with the probe, according to media reports.\n\nPhotos: Scenes from the Hard Rock hotel construction collapse in New Orleans\n\nA month ago, the local chapter of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union passed out orange flyers protesting the construction site and its alleged use of unlicensed electricians.\n\nBut when asked if this kind of breach in structural integrity could stem from employing unlicensed electricians, Zehner said steel workers are not normally licensed and would have more contact with structural materials.\n\n\u201cRight now everything is guesswork as to what could have caused this, but I can\u2019t imagine unlicensed electrical workers would have had anything to do with it,\u201d Zehner said.\n\nThe investigation is made all the more difficult right now by debris and the still-unstable building that officials say could collapse further.\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, the safety perimeter had expanded, both cranes on top of the building were found to be damaged, and the search continued for the two workers still inside the building, one of whom is said to be deceased.\n\nNews tips?
