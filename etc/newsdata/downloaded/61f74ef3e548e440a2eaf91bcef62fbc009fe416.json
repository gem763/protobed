The language he used is offensive, hurtful and unacceptable. We are sorry that we did not see these clips earlier, and that our vetting process was not up to our standard.\u201d\n\nGillis took to Twitter on Monday to react to the news. He wrote, \"It feels ridiculous for comedians to be making serious public statements but here we are.\"\n\n\"I'm a comedian who was funny enough to get SNL. That can't be taken away.\"\n\n\"Of course I wanted an opportunity to prove myself at SNL, but I understand It would too much of a distraction. I respect the decision they made. I'm honestly grateful for the opportunity. I was always a mad tv guy anyway.\"\n\nNBC announced Thursday that Gillis would be one of three new cast members on the venerable variety show, a launching pad for many comedy stars over the past several decades.\n\nHours later, a YouTube video surfaced of Gillis and fellow comedian Matt McCusker discussing an unidentified city's Chinatown neighborhood.\n\nAt one point, Gillis asked: \u201cWhy do the f---ing c---ks live there?\u201d before complaining that Chinese restaurants are full of \"f---ing Chinese. ... And the translation between you and the waiter is just such a f---ing hassle.\" He also said he was more annoyed by hearing an Asian trying to learn English when he's eating out than by any other \"minority\" playing music.\n\nLESLIE JONES EXITING 'SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE' AFTER FIVE SEASONS: REPORT\n\nHe characterized that reaction as \"nice racism, good racism,\" adding that whites would be a similar target if they were speaking English \"over there,\" not specifying where he meant.\n\nEarly Saturday, Page Six reported that Gillis had described 2020 presidential contender Andrew Yang as a \"Jew c---k\" on a podcast hosted by fellow comedians Luis J. Gomez and Zac Amico.\n\nANDREW YANG: NEW 'SNL' CAST MEMBER SHANE GILLIS SHOULDN'T LOSE JOB OVER RACIST REMARKS\n\nIn a statement late Thursday, Gillis offered to apologize \"to anyone who's actually offended by anything I've said.\" (Yang has said he was offended but did not call for the comedian to be fired.)\n\n\"I'm a comedian who pushes boundaries,\" the statement began. \"I sometimes miss. If you go through my 10 years of comedy, most of it bad, you're going to find a lot of bad misses. ... My intention is never to hurt anyone but I am trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometimes that requires risks.\n\nThe other two comedians joining the cast are Bowen Yang and Chloe Fineman. Yang joined NBC's \"SNL\" last season as a staff writer. He's also the co-host of a podcast, \"Las Culturistas.\"\n\nFineman's been a regular performer with the Groundlings improv company. She was also featured as one of the \"New Faces\" at the Just for Laughs Festival in Montreal.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe show returns Sept. 28 with host Woody Harrelson and musical guest Billie Eilish.\n\nThe Associated Press and Fox News' Morgan Phillips contributed to this report.", "description": "Shane Gillis will not be appearing on \"Saturday Night Live\" this fall.", "authors": ["Jessica Napoli"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/gillia.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
