Just one year later, he was $35,000 in debt and living in his car parked outside a Walmart WMT, -0.03%.\n\nA cascade of bad decisions, including rapid-fire impulse buys and efforts to impress his peers, drove ONeal to that Oceanside, Calif., parking lot.\n\nONeal\u2019s fall and rise began with a freshman-year hankering for pizza.\n\nONeal went to Palomar College in Southern California without a clear understanding of what he wanted to study or pursue as a career.\n\n\u2018I just knew my parents wanted me in college, so I went to college.\u2019 \u2014Anthony ONeal\n\n\u201cI just knew my parents wanted me in college, so I went to college,\u201d he said. He attended the San Diego-area school on his father\u2019s GI Bill benefits and took out a $10,000 student loan.\n\nHe also went to school with little financial savvy, having grown up in a Christian home \u201cpretty much focused on the Christian faith and school,\u201d he said. Money talk was essentially confined to the expectation of a 10% donation to church.\n\n\u201cWe never talked about building wealth and saving,\u201d ONeal said.\n\nThat\u2019s where the pizza came in.\n\nOn his first day of school, ONeal saw an array of credit-card representatives on campus. One offered him two large pizzas and a T-shirt just for applying. So he did, not expecting he would be approved. \u201cI really just wanted the free food and the T-shirt,\u201d he said.\n\nThe grub was a letdown \u2014 it was old and cold by the time he received it, he said, and his buddies took all but one slice. But that was nothing compared to what happened next.\n\n\u2018To this day, I wished I had listened to my mother, because she was right.\u2019\n\nONeal\u2019s mother saw the mail when the card arrived at his home address, and told him he didn\u2019t need a credit card. ONeal begged to differ.\n\n\u201cI just knew I was grown man,\u201d ONeal said. \u201cTo this day, I wish I had listened to my mother, because she was right.\u201d\n\nONeal hit his $500 limit within 18 hours. He picked up the tab for a $150 group outing to Red Lobster DRI, +0.35%, spent $150 on roses for a girl, then dropped another $200 at Dillard\u2019s DDS, -1.67% on a purse for her DDS, -1.67%.\n\nHe paid his $35 minimum, and the card company raised his limit to $1,000. This time, he maxed out in 45 minutes on a sound system for his 1987 Nissan Maxima NSANY, +3.18%.\n\nHe went on to rack up $15,000 in credit-card debt, and piled on another $10,000 in debt buying furniture from Aaron\u2019s AAN, -0.10%, a national rent-to-own furniture and appliance chain.\n\n\u201cThis is fun; this is easy,\u201d he recalled thinking. \u201cI went after every loan, every credit card.\u201d\n\n\u2018You made those choices. You need to leave.\u2019\n\nBy his sophomore year in 2003, ONeal was planning to join a fraternity when he and some fellow pledges were kicked out of school for hazing. ONeal deeply regrets it all, he said, describing it as a time when he \u201cwalked away\u201d from his spiritual path.\n\nBooted from school and without his campus job, he thought he could move back in with his mother and stepfather. But ONeal says his stepfather told him, \u201cYou made the decision; you made those choices. You need to leave.\u201d\n\nFriends wouldn\u2019t take him in, so ONeal went to a Walmart parking lot and lived out of his Nissan for six months, sound system and all.\n\nONeal cut grass, worked odd jobs and held a stock-clerk job at the discount chain Ross Stores ROST, -0.19%. He says he felt \u201cabandoned\u201d by his parents and by God. \u201cI questioned why I was here,\u201d he said.\n\nEventually, his stepfather told him it was time to come home.\n\n\u201cThat was when my whole life switched around,\u201d he said.\n\nA fresh start\n\nONeal stomached a day job as a bill collector and worked nights and weekends washing cars. He occasionally chipped in with food expenses, but lived rent-free and devoted everything else to paying off his debt. He started with the smallest debts, and then moved to the largest.\n\nThe collection-agent job \u201cwas probably the biggest motivator, calling other people, hearing their stories, hearing them cry when I owed, just like them,\u201d ONeal said. \u201cIt was hard.\u201d\n\nBut it also \u201cwasn\u2019t comfortable,\u201d he said. He paid off his debts in about two years and ditched the debt-collecting job as soon as he could.\n\nONeal moved east and became a youth pastor for a 30,000-member Jacksonville, Fla., church with 5,000 students. He spoke to them about the importance of financial literacy and the perils of making early mistakes like his.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re hungry for the knowledge. They just want it, but nobody\u2019s really teaching it.\u2019\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re hungry for the knowledge,\u201d said ONeal. \u201cThey just want it, but nobody\u2019s really teaching it.\u201d\n\nFinancial-literacy courses are required to graduate in just 20 states. In June, a federal commission recommended mandatory financial literacy for college students as student loan debts reach $1.5 trillion. Financial-literacy advocates like ONeal say there\u2019s momentum for increasing education on the topic, but there\u2019s still a long way to go.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: Fewer young people are working \u2014 here\u2019s why that could be a good thing\n\nONeal now speaks about his life to audiences across the country and is a frequent guest on Dave Ramsey\u2019s radio show.\n\nHis second book, \u201cDebt Free Degree,\u201d which discusses how parents and students can plan for college without drowning in red ink, hits stores Oct. 7. ONeal, 35, now earns six figures as an author and speaker, and is on a mission to prevent other college students from making the same mistakes.\n\nHis book addresses two key points, he said: One, the fact that there\u2019s \u201cnothing wrong with going to a trade school or a community college,\u201d and two, the \u201cmyth\u201d that taking on debt is the only way to afford higher education when there are alternatives like community colleges, scholarships and on-campus jobs.\n\n\u201cI meet way too many smart, talented young people whose lives are being choked by debt,\u201d ONeal writes in his book.\n\nIt\u2019s been 16 years since the Nashville, Tenn., suburb resident\u2019s college career abruptly ended, but he has no immediate plans to go back to school. College isn\u2019t for everyone, he says.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a huge fan of education. I\u2019m learning every single day; I just don\u2019t have a piece of paper,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in a good financial space. I want to go back and teach others.\u201d", "description": "\u2018I want to go back and teach others,\u2019 says Anthony ONeal.", "authors": ["Andrew Keshner"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ873_anthon_MG_20190906205009.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
