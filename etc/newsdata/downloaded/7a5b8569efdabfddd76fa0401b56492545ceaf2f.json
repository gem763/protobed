But to get there, they must go through Adam Wainwright, the diminished but dangerous Cardinals starter who was once a perennial Cy Young Award contender.

Wainwright joked it\u2019s \u201clike Christmas\u201d to compete with Scherzer.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have similar games,\u201d Wainwright said. \u201cWe\u2019re both attacking with high-velocity fastballs at the top of the zone and nasty sliders and change ups.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI would love to have reinvented myself into Max Scherzer, that would have been amazing. It just didn\u2019t work that way.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe Nationals hope the \u201caw shucks\u201d nature of Wainwright ends up with his statements realized, with Wainwright the inferior starter on Saturday afternoon.
