REUTERS/Simon Dawson/Files\n\nAn EU summit on Thursday aims to agree a divorce settlement ahead of Britain\u2019s scheduled Oct. 31 departure from the bloc.\n\nThe EU has said future market access for UK financial firms will be based on \u201cequivalence\u201d, whereby Brussels grants access if it deems a foreign country\u2019s home regulation is as robust as the EU\u2019s own regulation.\n\nBritain\u2019s finance ministry has been sounding out its financial sector ahead of the government\u2019s negotiations with the EU on future trade after Brexit.\n\nShifts by UK financial firms to the EU could make it easier for Britain when it comes to deciding which sectors to favour in the inevitable trade offs with the EU across industries.\n\n\u201cThe scale of relocations significantly reduces the potential benefit of the granting of equivalence or of any potential future deal in financial services between the UK and EU,\u201d New Financial said.\n\nThe report points to share trading and clearing as among the few areas where obtaining equivalence would be of benefit.\n\nWith access to the EU obtained via new units in the bloc, Britain could focus more on developing its business with the rest of the world, New Financial said.\n\nThis would also reduce British worries about having to stay closely aligned with EU rules or becoming a \u201crule taker\u201d to retain equivalence, it added.\n\nOver 330 firms have relocated part of their business, moved some staff or set up new entities in the EU, up by more than 60 from New Financial\u2019s initial tally in March.\n\nDublin is ahead of the pack in attracting business from Britain, with 115 firms choosing the Irish capital, well ahead of Luxembourg with 71 firms, Paris with 69, Frankfurt 45, and Amsterdam 40.\n\nDublin has attracted nearly 40% of all asset management firms from London, while banks have mainly chosen Frankfurt, home to their future regulator, the European Central Bank.\n\nAmsterdam has attracted two-thirds of exchanges and other trading platforms looking for a post-Brexit base. New Financial has not updated its March estimate of 5,000 job moves and about 800 billion pounds ($1 trillion) in assets shifting base.\n\n\u201cOver time, we expect the headline numbers of firms, staff, and business to increase significantly,\u201d the think tank said.", "description": "The growing tally of UK-based banks, insurers and asset managers opening hubs in the European Union means that a post-Brexit trade deal in financial services may be of limited importance to either side, the New Financial think tank said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Huw Jones", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441390418&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0HI", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
