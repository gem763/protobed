In separate cases in 2018, a New Jersey jury awarded a total of $117 million dollars, and a California jury awarded a total of $29.5 million.\n\nBut a South Carolina jury in May concluded that the company\u2019s baby powder does not contain asbestos and was not the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s disease. Johnson & Johnson at the time said it was the fifth verdict in the company\u2019s favor in just a few months.", "description": "Johnson & Johnson is recalling a single lot of its Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder after small amounts of asbestos were found in a bottle purchased online.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/babypowder-998013060.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
