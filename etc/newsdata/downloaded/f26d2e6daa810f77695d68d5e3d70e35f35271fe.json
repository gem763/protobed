The IMF Says Just Do Something.", "language": "en", "text": "Activists, politicians and economists are forever arguing over the best way to address climate change: carbon tax or Green New Deal; both or neither, or a mixture of elements from each. A new International Monetary Fund (IMF) report released Thursday cuts through that noise: any aggressive policy, it says, is better than nothing at all.\n\n\u201cWe definitely want action to be taken,\u201d says Paolo Mauro, deputy director of fiscal affairs at the IMF, who oversaw the report. \u201cWe\u2019re not religious about any particular type of measure.\u201d\n\nThe new report comes as a range of different climate policies are under consideration in the U.S. Proposals for a Green New Deal \u2014 an ambitious spending program aimed at eliminating emissions and funding social programs \u2014 have garnered the most attention in recent months. All the major Democratic presidential candidates have embraced some form of a Green New Deal, and activists have pushed aggressively for such a program. But proposals for a carbon tax have also been gaining momentum on Capitol Hill. U.S. lawmakers are currently considering drafts for several new carbon tax proposals.\n\nThe IMF report does not provide a specific policy prescription. Instead, it assesses a variety of different proposed climate policies, including a carbon tax, an emissions trading system, regulations and a so-called \u201cfeebate\u201d system in which polluting is penalized and those who reduce emissions are rewarded. The IMF report concludes that lawmakers must craft rules that work within their own countries\u2019 political context.\n\nStill, while taking an even-keeled look at several policies that would effectively reduce emissions, the IMF report does put a thumb on the scale. It concludes unequivocally that a carbon tax is the most \u201csingle, most powerful and efficient tool\u201d to drive a reduction in emissions. It would push polluters to reduce carbon emissions across all facets of the economy\u2014and it\u2019s easier to implement than some alternatives.\n\nOne of the benefits of a carbon tax, the report says, is that it\u2019s easier to standardize across borders. More than 70 countries have committed to eliminating their carbon footprint by 2050, but many others \u2014 including the biggest emitters, like the U.S. and China \u2014 have lagged behind. A carbon tax offers a uniform approach to compare each country\u2019s progress and to form coalitions across borders. \u201cIf a country has a straightforward carbon tax,\u201d says Mauro, \u201cit\u2019s a lot easier to compute how much action has been taken.\u201d\n\nFor those nations that don\u2019t implement a carbon tax, economists will need to calculate an implicit carbon price, a tricky but doable proposition, report authors say. The IMF found that to keep temperatures from rising more than 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century, the price on carbon needs to reach $75/ton by 2030.\n\nAuthors behind the IMF report argue that activists need not choose between a carbon tax and a Green New Deal-type spending program: a carbon tax can \u2014 at least in part \u2014 help defray the cost of a Green New Deal. It\u2019s an idea that has caught on in some policy circles, even if it hasn\u2019t risen to the forefront of the climate policy discussion. TIME reported in July that dozens of members of Congress who support Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s Green New Deal resolution also back a carbon tax.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Salud Carbajal of California, who supports both the Green New Deal and a carbon tax, echoed the need for action of any kind. \u201cI\u2019m for anything and everything,\u201d he told TIME in July, \u201cthat moves the ball forward.\u201d\n\nThe report also addresses some of the common critiques leveled against a carbon tax, including that the policy would hit the poor hardest. The report authors emphasize the wide range of potential uses for revenue derived from a carbon tax, from potential tax breaks for low-income people to helping communities whose livelihoods will be damaged by the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nWhat\u2019s clear is that the consequences of inaction will be severe. In a landmark report released last year, the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that a rise in temperatures of just 1.5\u00b0C could lead to ecological, economic and humanitarian disaster with millions displaced and severe impacts altering human civilization as we know it. The IMF under Christine Lagarde has prioritized the issue citing the costs of inaction. \u201cMany of the things that we are debating, whether it\u2019s sustainability, whether it\u2019s structural reform, whether it\u2019s fighting inequalities,\u201d said Lagarde at event in May, all \u201cwill be meaningless if in twenty years time essentially we have wasted the small window of opportunity we have.\u201d", "description": "The IMF says a carbon tax is best to fight climate change but says countries should do what works best for them \u2014 so long as they do something.", "authors": ["Justin Worland"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/haKO71WohFYWEmdmORT3ZQ--~B/aD0xNjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/a115399a573164807ab9082849e15a45", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
