Which is why I am so pleasantly surprised by how much I have enjoyed using the Fossil Carlyle smartwatch. It\u2019s one of two so-called \u201cGen 5\u201d Wear OS watches Fossil recently began selling for $295.\n\nPleasantly surprised, but not at all convinced that this watch is worth investing in, to say nothing of this platform. I give Fossil credit for resolving two of my biggest complaints with Wear OS. The first fix involves a relatively simple internal change to give the watch more memory, while the other is unfortunately a very complicated series of battery options.\n\nAndroid users who want a smartwatch have to choose between several mediocre options. Fossil\u2019s Gen 5 smartwatches don\u2019t really change that equation, but they do make at least one of those options a little better.\n\nOur review of Fossil Carlyle Gen 5 Smartwatch Verge Score 6 out of 10 Good Stuff Sharp looks\n\nFaster performance\n\nSpeaker Bad Stuff Complicated battery settings\n\nHard to see in direct sunlight\n\nWear OS Buy for $295.00 from Fossil Buy for $295.00 from Amazon\n\nThe Fossil Carlyle looks like a typical Wear OS smartwatch, which means that it has a round OLED screen with a fairly large bezel. Although it comes in a small variety of styles, all of them have 44mm cases with three chunky buttons sticking out of the right-hand side of the watch. I\u2019m using the all-black model and I think it looks really smart \u2014 but I also wear watches that are about this size quite often. If you have a smaller wrist, this will likely dominate it.\n\nI have no complaints about the 1.3-inch AMOLED screen when I look at it indoors \u2014 it\u2019s perfectly round without any chin and responsive when I tap it. Outdoors, however, it can be difficult to see \u2014 especially in direct sunlight. Fossil added a \u201cSunlight boost\u201d option, but I think it takes a second to realize it\u2019s necessary. I spent that second staring at a nearly black screen, wondering if something was busted.\n\nThe watch uses 22mm straps that are fairly simple to change out and should give you a wide variety of replacement options. Underneath, there\u2019s a heart rate sensor \u2014 it doesn\u2019t do any of the irregular heartbeat detection stuff the Apple Watch does and that Samsung promises is coming to its Tizen watches, nor does it have an EKG function.\n\nI especially like that the contacts for charging the watch are two complete rings \u2014 so you don\u2019t have to line up the charger. It\u2019s not as nice as a straight inductive charger like the Apple Watch, but it\u2019s functionally the same thing.\n\nNone of the above is especially new or notable for Wear OS watches. What\u2019s different this time \u2014 and what probably makes these watches $50 more than the Fossil Sport \u2014 are the internal specs. Fossil doubled the usual RAM of Wear OS watches, from 512MB to 1GB.\n\nIn theory, Wear OS should operate just fine with the usual memory \u2014 that\u2019s what it was supposedly designed for, after all. In practice, double the memory appears to be exactly what Wear OS was missing. What was sluggish before is now responsive. Apps don\u2019t exactly load quickly now, but they load in a reasonable amount of time \u2014 fast enough to meet my three-second rule for smartwatch interactions.\n\nThis watch also has the newer Snapdragon 3100 processor, which turns out to not be all that much faster, but is supposed to help with battery life. Previous testing on other watches with the 3100 hasn\u2019t really supported those claims, so on the Gen 5 watches Fossil achieves better battery life in a different way: with ridiculous settings.\n\nTap the battery saver icon in Wear OS on the Gen 5 watches and you are made to read through several screens of information detailing what each different option means. There\u2019s \u201cDaily,\u201d \u201cExtended,\u201d \u201cCustom,\u201d and \u201cTime Only.\u201d Inside the first three of those are a dozen (literally) options you can tweak to extend how long the watch will last.\n\nYou can adjust NFC, location, whether it should listen for a wake word, whether the screen will light up when you lift your wrist, whether you want an always-on screen, and so on.\n\nMost users will just pick \u201cDaily\u201d or \u201cExtended\u201d and be done \u2014 but the \u201cExtended\u201d mode turns off way too much, while the Daily mode leaves too much on. The result is that everyone will end up constantly trying to toggle those check boxes.\n\nIn a sense, this doesn\u2019t matter because the \u201cDaily\u201d mode with nearly everything on still netted me about 20 hours of battery life \u2014 at which point it offered to switch to \u201cExtended\u201d and made it most of the way through the next morning. So battery life is passable, but not as good as the last couple of generations of the Apple Watch and (of course) nowhere near what you can get with a hybrid smartwatch.\n\nIn reality, though, if you are offering a dozen different toggles to adjust battery life, you\u2019ve definitely blown it. I don\u2019t fully blame Fossil here, either, it is just making the best of a bad situation created by Qualcomm and Google.\n\nFossil has held up its end of the smartwatch bargain, at least\n\nFossil has also done a nice job of offering a wide array of watchfaces \u2014 which is good because finding the right ones in the Play Store is a trial. The two side buttons that flank the rotating crown can be mapped to whatever you like. By default they go to Fossil\u2019s completely unnecessary watchface repository app, so definitely remap them.\n\nI also was pleased to see a speaker. You can use it in a pinch for a call (so long as it\u2019s connected to your phone), but it\u2019s not a good speaker and you won\u2019t want to listen to music on it. You can get vocal responses to queries you ask the Google Assistant, which is way more convenient than speaking and then staring at your watch and waiting for it to respond.\n\nWear OS\u2019s user interface has progressed some in the past year. My favorite new feature is called \u201cTiles,\u201d though that word does nothing to explain what it does. Now, when you swipe left from the watchface, you can swipe through a series of informational screens: weather, Google Fit, or your next calendar appointment. It\u2019s a nice thing, but it\u2019s also seemingly limited to Google\u2019s own features.\n\nThese are the watches that Fossil wants you to believe will work well with iPhones \u2014 including for making calls. I\u2019m just going to tell you right now that I didn\u2019t really test any of that. If you have an iPhone and want a smartwatch, you should get an Apple Watch.\n\nThe Fossil Gen 5 watches can last through a day, look good, and run much better than previous generations. I would have no major qualms about making the Fossil Carlyle my daily watch. However, I do have qualms suggesting that anybody purchase one \u2014 not at $295.\n\nIt\u2019s a good watch at a bad price\n\nAlthough Wear OS runs well on this hardware, I do not have a ton of faith it will continue to do so in a year or two. Past experience has tended to show that this software grows to fill up the memory that\u2019s available to it, eventually slowing down.\n\nMore importantly, I still think Wear OS is in need of some kind of major revamp, at least from a hardware perspective. The software has progressed nicely to the point that it\u2019s coherent and usable, but the basic shape and battery life of the current watches hasn\u2019t significantly improved in at least two or three years.\n\nIf none of that bothers you and you don\u2019t mind spending nearly $300 to get a touchscreen smartwatch that works with your Android phone: godspeed. If all of it does, take a look at Samsung\u2019s Tizen-based Galaxy watches.", "description": "I am so pleasantly surprised by how much I have enjoyed using the Fossil Carlyle smartwatch.
