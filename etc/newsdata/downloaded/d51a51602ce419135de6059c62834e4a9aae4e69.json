The Fremont, California-based company was launched in 2007 and does not have a commercial product on the market.\n\nThe company's revenues so far have mostly come from licensing. Ardelynx employs about 86 people, with roughly 70% of them being in R&D.\n\nThe Pipeline\n\nThe company's lead drug tenapanor, an NHE3 inhibitor, is being evaluated for multiple indications.\n\n1. Tenapanor is being evaluated in a second Phase 3 trial dubbed \"PHREEDOM\" for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia, or elevated blood phosphate levels, in patients with end-stage renal disease, or ESRD, who are on dialysis.\n\nThe pipeline asset is a novel, potent small-molecule dosed twice daily in milligram quantities.\n\nAs opposed to current treatment options, which are mostly phosphate binders requiring multigram quantities, tenapanor is expected to significantly reduce patient pill burden. The twice-daily dosing also facilitates improved patient adherence and compliance.\n\n2. Tenapanor is also being evaluated in combination with phosphate binders in a Phase 3 trial dubbed \"AMPLIFY.\"\n\nIf approved for the indication, the investigational drug could be the first and only phosphate-lowering therapy used as an adjunctive therapy in combination with binders.\n\nIn a clinical readout, the company said Tuesday the study met the primary endpoint and all key secondary endpoints, including showing a statistically significant reduction in serum phosphate levels in patients treated with tenapanor and phosphate binders compared to phosphate binders alone.\n\n3. Tenapanor is in the clinics for irritable bowel syndrome with constipation, or IBS-C. The company submitted an NDA for the indication and has been granted a PDUFA goal date of Sept. 12.\n\nArdelyx is also developing RDX013 \u2014 a small molecule secretagogue \u2014 for the treatment of hyperkalemia.\n\nHyperkalemia is a condition in which the potassium level in the blood is abnormally high, and it is found to occur in patients with heart and kidney diseases, particularly those taking blood pressure medications belonging to the RAAS inhibitor class.\n\nRDX013 is in the preclinical stage of development.\n\nardelyxpipeline.png More\n\nSource: Ardelyx\n\nSee also: Biotech Stock On The Radar: MyoKardia Bets On Precision Medicine For Heart Health\n\nMarket Potential\n\nArdelyx estimates the market opportunity for tenapanor in hyperphosphatemia to be $500 million to $700 million in the U.S.\n\nThe company has three collaboration agreements in place for marketing tenapanor overseas:\n\nWith Kyowa Kirin Co Ltd (OTC: KYKOF) for cardiorenal diseases, including hyperphosphatemia, in Japan. The deal is for a $30-million upfront payment, up to $55 million in development milestone payments and up to $77.5 million in commercial milestone payments as well as royalties on annual sales.\n\nWith Fosun Pharma for IBS-C and hyperphosphatemia in China. The deal is for a $12-million upfront payment and up to an additional $113 million in additional milestone payments as well as tiered royalties on sales.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Shares of the thinly traded, micro-cap biotech Ardelyx Inc (NASDAQ: ARDX) have risen over 200% year-to-date.
