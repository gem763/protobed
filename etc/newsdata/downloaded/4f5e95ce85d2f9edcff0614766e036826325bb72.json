Mark A. Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, declined to elaborate on what was collected, citing operational security. The United States also is holding two men who were captured in the raid, he said.\n\nThe collection of materials at the site and the taking of prisoners raise questions about whether the U.S. military may be able to carry out other raids in the future based on what they learn.\n\nAD\n\nBaghdadi detonated a suicide vest while running from U.S. forces, President Trump said Sunday as he announced the terrorist leader\u2019s death. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said Sunday that fewer than 100 U.S. troops were involved in the operation on the ground. Other U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the raid, said it was carried out by elite members of Delta Force and the 75th Ranger Regiment.\n\nAD\n\nMilley, speaking alongside Esper during a Pentagon news conference Monday, said that he has \u201cseen a lot\u201d of video that was recorded during the raid and that the government will declassify some of it \u201cin the coming days\u201d and release it to the public.\n\nThe general also said the Pentagon is not releasing the name of the military working dog that was wounded in the operation.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe was slightly wounded and fully recovering, but the dog is still in theater and returned to duty with its handlers,\u201d Milley said. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to release just yet photos or names of dogs or anything else. We\u2019re protecting the dog\u2019s identity.\u201d\n\nTwo defense officials said the dog\u2019s name is considered classified because releasing it would make it easier to determine who was involved in the raid. It could eventually be released if the dog is retired from military service, one official said.\n\nAD\n\nThe raid, launched from Iraq, was carried out in Syria\u2019s northwestern Idlib province, about four miles from the Turkish border. It came as the U.S. military is bolstering its troop numbers in Syria\u2019s eastern Deir al-Zour province.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has said he wants to protect oil fields there from the Islamic State, but Esper acknowledged Monday that the presence of U.S. troops there also helps deny access to Russia and Syria.\n\nThat may draw new scrutiny from lawmakers who want to make sure U.S. military operations do not expand beyond the scope of congressional law. The long-standing Authorization for Use of Military Force used for U.S. counterterrorism operations allows the Pentagon to prevent \u201cfuture acts of international terrorism\u201d but does not cover countries that had no role in the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\nEsper suggested that the arrangement is acceptable because the United States wants to make sure its partner in the fight against the Islamic State, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, has \u201caccess to resources in order to guard the prisons, in order to arm their own troops, in order to assist us with the defeat-ISIS mission.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our mission,\u201d he said, \u201cto secure the oil fields.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The United States is holding two men captured during the operation and poring over video and other information.", "authors": ["Dan Lamothe", "Reporter Covering The Pentagon", "The U.S. Military"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tawfxY0DV4Gx130MDP9jNYTjBGM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/EIMZGGXZXEI6TLEMR3HNFHFG54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
