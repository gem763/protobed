Chants in Spanish alternated between thanking Trump (\u201cWe\u2019re with you!\u201d) and taunting Maduro (\u201cHe\u2019s already fallen!\u201d). \u201cIt was like a rock concert,\u201d Rafael Fernandez, who left Venezuela nearly two decades ago, told me. The Trump Administration had recently instituted sanctions against Venezuela\u2019s state oil company, which supplies the overwhelming majority of the government\u2019s budget, and more than fifty countries, including the U.S., now recognized the opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, as the country\u2019s legitimate President. Trump had also floated the possibility of a military intervention. Marco Rubio, the Republican senator from Florida, who is influential on Latin-American issues, claimed that high-ranking officers in the Venezuelan military were poised to defect. Addressing those who weren\u2019t, Trump warned, \u201cYou will find no safe harbor, no easy exit, and no way out. You\u2019ll lose everything.\u201d Fernandez was in the audience with his father, Francisco. The two argued constantly about Trump. Rafael told me that he was \u201cmore pro-Trump than anti.\u201d His father, a former Venezuelan politician, is a lifelong conservative, but when he voted for the first time in an American election, in 2016, it was for Hillary Clinton; he despised Trump. Francisco\u2019s sentiments were rare among his neighbors in Doral, a small city of strip malls and golf courses west of Miami. There are more than two hundred thousand Venezuelans in Florida, more than anywhere else in the country, and the majority live in the Doral area. Many of them are recent arrivals\u2014some four million people have left Venezuela in the past four years, ten per cent of the country\u2019s population. The exodus began after Maduro was elected, in 2013, when, in response to dwindling oil prices and economic mismanagement, the government tried to stave off collapse by printing more money. Earlier this year, with inflation close to two million per cent, a bottle of ketchup cost nine dollars, but a minimum-wage job paid about six dollars a month. Maduro has responded to public protests by jailing and killing dissenters; death squads aligned with the government have assassinated at least seven thousand people in the past year and a half. Condemnation of Maduro has been widespread in the U.S. and other countries, but no one has denounced the regime as aggressively as Trump has. In Doral, Rafael said, \u201cyou were a pariah if you didn\u2019t support Trump.\u201d Rafael, who is twenty-eight, manages a car dealership, and he and his father run a Web site called Bienvenidos Venezolanos. They created it eight years ago as an advice hub for Venezuelans in Florida, with links to immigration lawyers, job postings, and real-estate listings. It\u2019s a low-budget operation, with a single full-time employee, but by the end of last year, when Venezuelans were responsible for the largest share of asylum applications in American immigration courts, the site was getting five thousand hits a day. Rafael said that, at the rally, anticipating Maduro\u2019s downfall, \u201cwe were thinking, We could be free next month.\u201d When Trump promised a \u201cnew day\u201d in Latin America, asserting that \u201call options are open,\u201d Rafael looked at his father, who had tears in his eyes. \u201cOh, my God,\u201d Francisco said. \u201cIt\u2019s happening.\u201d Only a small percentage of the recently arrived Venezuelans are eligible to vote, but many Latin Americans in Florida see the Venezuelan government as the nexus of the region\u2019s worst problems. The repressive socialist leaders in Cuba and Nicaragua depend on Venezuela for oil and for political support. Colombia, which borders Venezuela, has taken in more than a million refugees. \u201cIf you solve the Venezuela problem, you get three for the price of one,\u201d a state Republican operative told me. \u201cYou\u2019ll make the Colombians, Nicaraguans, and Cubans in Florida very happy.\u201d In every Presidential election since 1992, the winner of Florida has gone on to the White House. Trump won the state, which has a population of twenty-one million, by a hundred and thirteen thousand votes. He\u2019s since made it the centerpiece of his re\u00eblection effort, launching his campaign in Orlando and making frequent visits to South Florida to deliver major addresses on Cuba and Venezuela. Local politicians call Interstate 4, which runs between Tampa and Daytona Beach, \u201cThe road to the White House.\u201d \u201cFlorida elections always come down to margins,\u201d Frank Mora, a professor of politics at F.I.U., told me. The 2018 races for governor and the Senate were each decided by less than half of a percentage point. In South Florida, which has diverse and overlapping voting blocs, candidates try to win votes in sympathetic constituencies and limit the damage in others. In and around Miami, seven hundred thousand Cubans are eligible to vote, along with a hundred and sixty thousand Colombians, eighty thousand Nicaraguans, and some fifty thousand Venezuelans. \u201cForeign policy is intensely local in South Florida,\u201d Mora said. Most of the diaspora communities in the state have fled socialist dictatorships. Republicans, and especially Trump, have seized on this fact to relentlessly attack left-wing populists in Central and South America. \u201cThe Trump Administration\u2019s Latin America policy has become all about Florida,\u201d a former State Department official told me. Less than a week after Trump\u2019s speech, the White House and Guaid\u00f3, convinced that Maduro was on the verge of falling, attempted to deliver nearly two hundred metric tons of food and medicine to Venezuela by way of checkpoints along the border with Brazil and Colombia, in a push that they hoped would break the will of Maduro\u2019s supporters. The Venezuelan military blocked the shipments and sealed the border. Few officers defected. In April, Guaid\u00f3 called for a military uprising\u2014the \u201cfinal phase,\u201d he said, of the attempt to oust Maduro\u2014but it never materialized. Two months later, when Trump returned to Florida to speak to campaign donors at the country club he owns in Doral, the regime was still in power. He didn\u2019t mention Venezuela. \u201cThe situation was hot at the time of the rally,\u201d Rafael Fernandez told me recently. \u201cNow the streets are cold.\u201d These days, Trump\u2019s promise of action in Venezuela rarely comes up at social gatherings; Rafael\u2019s friends and family prefer to avoid it. \u201c \u2018All the options are on the table.\u2019 That\u2019s what we heard, even though they aren\u2019t on the fucking table,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the Trump Administration, Plan A was that the military would come in and save the day,\u201d Mora told me. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a Plan B or C.\u201d The Latino electorate is younger, more numerous, and more diverse than ever before, with largely progressive views on health-care and social-justice issues. These trends should work in favor of the Democrats. Still, the Presidential election is more than a year away, and disaffection with Republicans is hardly a guarantee of Democratic votes. Florida Democrats remain bitterly divided over how they lost statewide races in 2018, and many have complained that the national Party leadership is not investing enough resources in voter-outreach and registration efforts. In an Op-Ed in the Times, Andrea Cristina Mercado, the head of the progressive group New Florida Majority, warned that the Democrats \u201cassume demography is destiny and think their policies speak for themselves.\u201d \u201cWe prefer our idea people to present their ideas during office hours.\u201d Cartoon by Frank Cotham This spring, the President\u2019s national-security adviser at the time, John Bolton, announced new sanctions against Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, claiming that \u201cthe troika of tyranny\u201d was \u201cbeginning to crumble.\u201d \u201cIf the President wins 2020, the Venezuelan policy will have been successful,\u201d a former Administration official said. \u201cNo matter how many Venezuelans are scattered to the winds.\u201d\n\nMeetings of the Venezuelan American Republican Club of Miami-Dade County begin with a recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. One night in late June, a group of thirty people dressed in cocktail attire stood with their hands on their hearts in the back room of a Cuban restaurant in Doral which was decorated with photographs of Old Havana. I\u2019d been invited by the club\u2019s vice-president, Kennedy Bol\u00edvar. Short and barrel-chested, Bol\u00edvar is a former union leader in Caracas. He fled to the U.S. in 2010, and worked in construction in New York before moving to Miami and applying for asylum. He will become a U.S. citizen next year, in time to vote in the 2020 elections. Bol\u00edvar helps organize press conferences and town-hall-style meetings for the Venezuelan opposition, when it visits Washington, and for the Trump Administration, when it visits Florida. He pulled out his phone to show me photographs of himself posing with Guaid\u00f3 and Vice-President Mike Pence. \u201cWe have a semantic problem with Venezuelans arriving in the U.S.,\u201d he told me. \u201cPeople associate Democrats with democracy. We have to tell them, \u2018No, there are two parties that work within the U.S. democratic system.\u2019 \u201d The club\u2019s president, Gustavo Garagorry, added, \u201cTrump is the king of democracy!\u201d A few miles away, the Democrats were holding the first debate of the Presidential primaries, and the club had asked two guests to offer a pre\u00ebmptive rebuttal: Luciano Su\u00e1rez, the Cuban-born, octogenarian vice-mayor of West Miami, and David Rivera, a Cuban-American former U.S. congressman. The words of the pledge were the only ones uttered in English all night. Su\u00e1rez, bald and bespectacled, in a white guayabera, took the microphone first, playing the role of elder statesman. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about Florida,\u201d he said, as waiters distributed baskets of fried plantains. \u201cIt\u2019s about preventing the spread of socialism in the region. If you\u2019ve got a friend who\u2019s Colombian, or Nicaraguan, and they say they\u2019re a Democrat, take them aside and say, \u2018Listen, this is about democracy.\u2019 \u201d The candidates who would be taking the debate stage, he said, were \u201csocialists disguised as Democrats.\u201d The Republicans\u2019 approach to Venezuelan immigrants builds on a relationship they\u2019ve been cultivating with Cuban-Americans since the nineteen-sixties. Between the Cuban Revolution, in 1959, and the mid-seventies, hundreds of thousands of Cubans came to Florida, fleeing the Castro regime. They thought that they\u2019d go home after Fidel Castro fell, but he remained in power until he died, in 2016, at which point he was replaced by his brother, Ra\u00fal. By the early eighties, local Cuban leaders had begun organizing voter-registration drives in South Florida under the slogan \u201cVote So That They Respect Us.\u201d Republicans courted them as the party of anti-Communism and free enterprise. The Party also capitalized on a history of Democratic betrayals, typified by the Bay of Pigs, in 1961, in which John F. Kennedy sent a battalion of Cuban \u00e9migr\u00e9s to overthrow Castro\u2014then, when the invasion foundered, abandoned them in order to deny American involvement. \u201cKennedy is still the No. 2 most hated man in Miami,\u201d the Cuban \u00e9migr\u00e9 Raul Masvidal said, in 1985, while running for mayor of the city. \u201cCastro is of course the No. 1.\u201d Within a decade, nearly seventy per cent of Cuban-Americans were registered Republicans. \u201cVenezuela is the gateway to the Cuban electorate,\u201d Fernand Amandi, a Democratic pollster in Miami, told me. Since 2000, Venezuela has supplied Cuba with some twenty-one billion dollars\u2019 worth of oil; in return, in 2008, the Castros began supplying Venezuela with Cuban intelligence agents, to monitor its military and to quell political opponents. In 2017, Maduro thanked Cuba publicly for this assistance. \u201cThe fall of Venezuela represents the fall of the Cuban regime,\u201d the Republican operative told me. \u201cCubans have waited their whole lives for this. For them, Venezuela is personal.\u201d At the meeting of the Venezuelan American Republican Club, Rivera gave a selective recounting of everything that the Republican Party had done over the years for South Florida\u2019s Latin-American constituencies: In Nicaragua, Ronald Reagan supported the Contras in their war against the Sandinistas. George W. Bush expanded Plan Colombia, a security-and-anti-drug initiative popular among the country\u2019s conservatives. And yet, Rivera said, without the efforts of groups such as the club he was addressing, it was far from assured that the diaspora communities would remember their debts. \u201cIt\u2019s the same with the Venezuelan vote,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that Trump has sanctioned Diosdado Cabello\u201d\u2014a member of Maduro\u2019s inner circle\u2014\u201cand that he\u2019s elevated Guaid\u00f3. That\u2019s not enough.\u201d The Democratic candidates on the debate stage made a point of proving how progressive they were on immigration. With a show of hands, they supported providing medical coverage to the undocumented and decriminalizing border crossings, proposals that fall well to the left of past Party consensus. Beto O\u2019Rourke, Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker, and Juli\u00e1n Castro attempted a few phrases in Spanish. (\u201cCervantes would have laughed. Or cried,\u201d the Miami Herald wrote.) But none of them mentioned Venezuela. Democrats in Florida have pushed for the Trump Administration to extend a form of legal relief, known as Temporary Protected Status, to some two hundred thousand Venezuelan refugees in the U.S., but the President has refused. Not a single Democrat on the debate stage talked about T.P.S. for Venezuelans. In the candidates\u2019 eagerness to satisfy their party\u2019s progressive base on immigration policy, they seemed to be forgetting that one reason they\u2019d come to Florida was to actually address the state\u2019s immigrants.\n\nOn a humid afternoon, I met Fabio Andrade, a Colombian-American Republican strategist, at a Panera Bread in a Doral strip mall. Last year, Andrade worked on Ron DeSantis\u2019s successful gubernatorial campaign, and he is now a consultant for the Republican Party on Latino outreach. In 2018, across Miami-Dade County, DeSantis and his predecessor, Rick Scott, who ran for Senate, outperformed Trump, mostly because of their strong showing among Cuban-Americans; turnout among previously registered voters, who are often older and more likely to vote Republican, outpaced new registrations. Andrade told me that older Cuban-Americans had been at the center of DeSantis\u2019s strategy in Miami-Dade, where he won seventy per cent of the Cuban vote. According to polling by a team at F.I.U., Cuban-Americans who came to the U.S. before 1980 supported DeSantis over his Democratic opponent, Andrew Gillum, by a margin of eighty-four per cent to fifteen per cent; those who were born in the U.S. supported him by a margin of only fifty-one per cent to forty-eight per cent. (DeSantis won over all by four-tenths of a percentage point.) DeSantis played on older Cubans\u2019 resentment of President Obama, who, in 2014, began the process of normalizing relations with Cuba and, two years later, visited the country and appeared alongside Ra\u00fal Castro, making him the first sitting American President to set foot on the island since the nineteen-twenties. \u201cFor Cubans, our message was that we had to return to the way things were before Obama,\u201d another Republican strategist told me. New generations of Cuban-Americans have grown less interested in Cuba policy, which has dropped below the economy, health care, and gun control in its importance to the Cuban-American electorate as a whole. While the community is still mostly Republican, younger Cuban-Americans identify less strongly with the G.O.P. The Venezuela issue, the strategist added, galvanized older Cuban-American voters, whose turnout had become more important than ever. Andrade walked me through the messages for other communities. Puerto Ricans, he said, were primarily concerned with the territory\u2019s achieving statehood. The national Republican leadership tends to reject this idea, but during the campaign DeSantis claimed to support it, in addition to immediate measures to insure the territory\u2019s sovereignty. On the campaign trail, Scott, who had travelled to Puerto Rico at least eight times as governor, emphasized the idea of representation, stressing the line \u201cI\u2019m going to be your senator.\u201d The Colombian-American community, Andrade said, had closely followed recent Presidential elections in Colombia, in which a right-wing candidate, Iv\u00e1n Duque, won by demonizing the previous government\u2019s peace accords with Marxist rebels. When Duque assumed office, in August, Scott was on hand for the inauguration, and appeared on Univision, which broadcast the event in Florida. Andrade said, \u201cWe saw that as an election that came down to a choice between socialist and non-socialist. The takeaway, in the governor\u2019s race, was that Gillum was the socialist.\u201d Similar appeals to Nicaraguans were reinforced by events in Nicaragua, where Daniel Ortega, the country\u2019s strongman President, has repressed dissent and brutalized opponents. One pro-DeSantis mailer added Gillum to a lineup of Latin-American socialist authoritarians, from Maduro to Ortega and Ra\u00fal Castro.\n\nIn 1983, when Ronald Reagan travelled to Little Havana for a rally, Al Cardenas, his state campaign chair, told the Times, \u201cIf you were running for President in a Latin-American country, I don\u2019t think you could fit the profile any better.\u201d The same could be said of Trump. Between his daily fulminations against the press and his fondness for campaign pageantry, there\u2019s something of the tropical caudillo about him. And, as the G.O.P. has morphed into the party of Trump, a small group of Florida Republicans have helped him boost his image with the state\u2019s Latino electorate. Representatives Mario D\u00edaz-Balart, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and Carlos Curbelo have deep ties to the Cuban community. Rick Scott has offered advice: in November, 2016, after Fidel Castro died, Trump, as President-elect, called Scott to ask what he should say. Most helpful of all is Rubio, who is known both for his interest in Latin-American policy and for his tendency to view the region through the lens of Cuban-American relations. \u201cHe knows a lot,\u201d a former White House official who worked with Rubio told me. \u201cBut what\u2019s good for Cuban-Americans isn\u2019t always what\u2019s good for America.\u201d When Rubio and Trump were running for President, they were contentious opponents: Rubio was \u201cLittle Marco\u201d; Trump was a \u201ccon artist.\u201d But that changed in early 2017, when Trump was trying to secure support in the Senate to repeal Obamacare, and Rubio was a swing vote. Rubio, for his part, wanted to be the Party\u2019s lead policymaker on Latin America. If Trump had any real interest in Cuba, it was as a business opportunity and a political staging ground. In 1998, he sent a group of investment advisers to the country on his behalf\u2014in violation of the U.S. embargo. The following year, when he was considering running for President, he gave a speech in Miami vowing never to do business in Cuba while Fidel Castro was in power. One former White House official told me that, by 2017, \u201cthe instructions were \u2018Make Rubio happy.\u2019 The President didn\u2019t care about Cuba at all, so it wasn\u2019t a big thing for him.\u201d The White House set a deadline of the summer of 2017 to reverse Obama\u2019s Cuba policy, and Rubio took the lead, working with officials at the National Security Council, as well as other Florida Republicans. At one point, after repeatedly failing to get meetings with the President, representatives from Kentucky, Louisiana, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Texas\u2014states that exported goods to Cuba, and didn\u2019t want White House policy to block trade with the country\u2014became upset. \u201cThey said to us, \u2018This is bullshit,\u2019 \u201d a White House official told me. \u201c \u2018We are Trump country. Why is the President only talking to Rubio and D\u00edaz-Balart? We represent more votes than they do!\u2019 \u201d But the Administration\u2014and the Florida Republicans\u2014saw the congressmen\u2019s business-minded pragmatism as insufficiently hard-line. On June 16, 2017, at a ceremony in Little Havana, with Rubio as the m.c. and the Florida Republican delegation in attendance, Trump claimed to be \u201ccancelling the last Administration\u2019s completely one-sided deal with Cuba.\u201d The presentation was a greatest hits of anti-Castro invective, featuring a violin performance of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d and homages to veterans of the Bay of Pigs. Nonetheless, the plan left most of Obama\u2019s policy intact: embassies remained open; direct commercial flights and cruises continued; Americans could still send unlimited remittances. \u201cThis was domestic electoral politics, not foreign policy,\u201d the second White House official told me. Returning to Washington on Air Force One, Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019re done. I won. We did what we needed to do. I said I\u2019d undo Obama\u2019s policy, and I did.\u201d A few months later, as the Cuban-American community in Miami learned the details of Trump\u2019s policy, Rubio, who, according to two White House officials, had been involved in drafting the policy, now lambasted it as the work of the deep state. \u201cBureaucrats in the State Department who oppose the President\u2019s Cuba policy refused to fully implement it,\u201d he said, in a statement issued just five hours after the final regulations were published. But, by then, Trump had shifted his focus to Venezuela. In May, while the White House had been preparing to unveil its Cuba policy, the situation in Caracas had exploded. \u201cPeople were marching in the streets by the millions, and on our end there was no strategy,\u201d one White House official told me. Officials at the N.S.C. started meeting with the State Department, and the Administration decided to impose a series of escalating sanctions in response to actions taken by Maduro. Later that month, Administration officials noticed a pattern. Every time they met with Rubio or his aides to share news about the developing Venezuela policy, the senator found some way to publicly disclose it in advance of a White House announcement. On May 17th, he appeared on the Senate floor with, he said, \u201can update and a suggestion, a request of the Administration about a step that we can take.\u201d According to a White House official involved in the policy, Rubio had been informed that the Administration planned to sanction eight members of the Venezuelan Supreme Court, including the chief judge, the next day. He delivered the speech to make it look as if he were the one behind it. \u201cHe was beginning to be seen as the godfather of Latin-American issues,\u201d another White House official told me. In July, after Maduro held a sham election for the constituent assembly, Rubio pre\u00ebmpted another White House announcement of sanctions, this time against Maduro himself. Having been told that sanctions were imminent, Rubio called for them in an official statement, voicing his confidence that \u201cTrump will respond swiftly and decisively.\u201d Trump was enraged, the official told me, but he and Rubio continued to \u201cplay from the same sheet of music.\u201d They needed each other. Announcing the latest sanctions, H. R. McMaster, the national-security adviser, said, \u201cMaduro is not just a bad leader. He is now a dictator.\u201d Many Democrats, especially those in South Florida, concurred, and routinely assailed Maduro themselves. \u201cThere was almost no sunlight between the South Florida Democrats and the Trump Administration on the Venezuela question,\u201d a senior Senate aide told me. But Trump and the Florida Republican delegation made sure that Democrats were cut out of conversations about Venezuelan policy. (Through a spokesperson, Rubio, who in the Senate has partnered with Democrats on legislation related to Venezuela, denied this.) When Trump and Pence travelled to Florida, they met only with Republican officeholders, then invited them to high-profile briefings in Washington. The more that the White House discussed Venezuela and Cuba, the more the region came to look like an exclusively Republican priority. In March, 2018, Trump fired McMaster and replaced him with John Bolton, a fierce advocate of regime change in Latin America. The Senate staffer told me, \u201cWhen Bolton takes over, the message was \u2018You guys are doing the right thing, keep going, but you\u2019re not taking enough political credit. Venezuela policy will affect Florida in 2020.\u2019 \u201d Inside the White House, Bolton\u2019s confidence created the illusion of immediate progress. He \u201cmisled POTUS,\u201d one White House official said. \u201cBolton told him, \u2018This whole thing is going to be over soon.\u2019 \u201d After the Administration announced a battery of policies against Maduro and the Cuban government, Bolton examined news reports in Florida to gauge the reaction. When he found critical op-eds or letters, especially from Republican voters faulting the Administration for not being tough enough, he told staffers, \u201cThese are the guys who are supposed to be supporting us. If we\u2019re losing them, we\u2019re doing something wrong.\u201d (A senior Administration official denied that Bolton had a political agenda.) Bolton\u2019s appointment was a triumph for Rubio and the Florida Republicans, many of whom had long-standing relationships with him. In August, Bolton fired the N.S.C.\u2019s head of Latin America policy and replaced him with an attorney from South Florida named Mauricio Claver-Carone, known among establishment politicians in Washington for his extremist, zero-sum outlook on Cuba. The Republican strategist told me that, in Miami, \u201cthe news about Mauricio made everyone very happy.\u201d Trump named another Rubio ally, Carlos Trujillo, as the U.S. Ambassador to the Organization of American States, a body designed to avoid regional military conflict. According to three Administration officials, Rubio also tried, but failed, to get the President to replace the acting Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs. \u201cRubio can\u2019t control the Holy Trinity on Latin America policy in Washington,\u201d another former State Department official said. \u201cBut he gets two out of three. He gets the Father and the Holy Ghost.\u201d The effect was to create an echo chamber, in which the Administration convinced itself that Maduro\u2019s fall was imminent. \u201cThis was the product of a small group of people who are being fed information from members of the Venezuelan diaspora,\u201d the official told me.\n\nThe headquarters of Actualidad Radio, an AM station started by Cuban and Venezuelan businessmen thirteen years ago, occupies a peach-colored building fringed with palm trees, on a quiet street off the freeway in Doral. One afternoon in late June, I arrived there with Luisana P\u00e9rez, who handles Latino outreach for Florida\u2019s Democratic Party. P\u00e9rez, who is thirty-two years old, came to the U.S. from Venezuela in 2011, after becoming engaged to a U.S. citizen, the son of a veteran of the Bay of Pigs. She volunteered at the Florida Immigrant Coalition, in Miami, on a campaign to persuade the state legislature to grant driver\u2019s licenses to the undocumented; that led to a job in the office of a Democratic state senator named Jos\u00e9 Javier Rodr\u00edguez, a Cuban-American with a law practice in Coral Gables. A few months before P\u00e9rez and I met, the Florida Democratic Party had held a meeting in Fort Lauderdale to discuss plans for 2020, and she was given an eighty-thousand-dollar budget to begin outreach. \u201cWhen I started with J.J.R.\u201d\u2014Jos\u00e9 Javier Rodr\u00edguez\u2014\u201che was very active on the radio, and I started to realize how important it was for a state representative to be on the radio,\u201d she told me. Univision and Telemundo are popular in South Florida, but AM radio is a diaspora staple. There\u2019s Radio Mamb\u00ed, the Cuban-American heir to La Cuban\u00edsima, the famous anti-Castro station, and the Colombian station Caracol. Amandi, the pollster, told me that Actualidad is \u201cthe command center of the Venezuelan community.\u201d It has a distinctly Venezuelan format: improvised and loosely structured, with frequent audience participation. The main topic of conversation, as on all South Florida Spanish-language stations, is the situation in Venezuela. P\u00e9rez bought a slot on Actualidad, for four hundred and twenty-five dollars, and hired a Venezuelan-American host, creating a news show with a progressive bent, called \u201cDemocracia al D\u00eda,\u201d which airs every Saturday at noon. The key to targeting voters in South Florida, P\u00e9rez told me, was understanding the fault lines within the diaspora communities. \u201cIf you tell me when you got to this country, I\u2019ll tell you what your socioeconomic background is,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you have money, you can get visas. If you don\u2019t, you need T.P.S. or asylum.\u201d When P\u00e9rez arrived, she stayed with extended family who\u2019d been there for more than a decade and had a house in a gated community. People who have arrived in the past five years, by contrast, often live together in subdivided apartments, doing odd jobs to pay the rent. \u201cTake a Lyft or an Uber\u2014all the drivers are Venezuelans,\u201d she said. There\u2019s been a similar evolution among Cubans. The island\u2019s economy has cratered in the past few decades, and recent immigrants to the U.S., who are poorer than their predecessors, are fleeing a different place. Rodr\u00edguez told me, \u201cIt\u2019s hard for some members of the Old Guard to claim to be leaders of the Cuban community, given how out of touch they are with the people coming now.\u201d This was one reason that P\u00e9rez was so frustrated with the Democratic Presidential candidates who came to Miami and talked about immigration without addressing local particularities: they were missing a historic opportunity to break the Republican grip on the leadership of South Florida\u2019s diaspora communities. \u201cWhether you came here twenty years ago or one year ago,\u201d she said, \u201cone of the things that unites everyone is what\u2019s happening in Venezuela.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve all been written out of the will in favor of more dynamic characters.\u201d Cartoon by Brendan Loper Democrats in South Florida have attacked the Trump Administration for championing Venezuelans in Venezuela but ignoring them once they arrive in the United States. For all the current political parallels between Venezuela and Cuba, immigration policy has been a point of conspicuous divergence. Cubans have historically enjoyed a singular set of immigration benefits. In 1966, the Cuban Adjustment Act allowed Cubans to apply for permanent residency on an expedited basis\u2014after a year and a day in the U.S. Beginning in 1995, through a policy called \u201cwet foot, dry foot,\u201d Cubans who had reached U.S. soil were guaranteed legal status. Venezuelans\u2019 request for T.P.S. is comparatively modest. Nevertheless, Trump still refuses to grant it, despite appeals from Rubio and Guaid\u00f3. \u201cThe Republican Party is going from a conservative party to a nationalist party,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said. \u201cIt\u2019s not the party of Reagan that\u2019s going full bore anti-immigrant.\u201d In an e-mail obtained by the Wall Street Journal, Elliott Abrams, the Administration\u2019s special envoy to Venezuela, warned the N.S.C. that the U.S. would become a \u201claughingstock\u201d if it deported Venezuelans while fighting the Maduro regime. \u201cWe have absolutely got to avoid any noncriminal deportations while we sort it out,\u201d he wrote. Claver-Carone tersely replied that any form of relief for Venezuelan refugees would send the message that Maduro might not fall anytime soon, and added that \u201cit opens up inconsistencies\u201d with the Administration\u2019s immigration agenda. Since 2016, there\u2019s been an eighty-four-per-cent increase in the deportation of Venezuelans and a six-hundred-and-twenty-per-cent increase in the deportation of Cubans. Still, not all Venezuelan immigrants regard Trump\u2019s agenda as an affront. \u201cThe Venezuelans here do not see themselves as undocumented,\u201d P\u00e9rez told me. \u201cThey think of the undocumented as the Guatemalans, the Central Americans. There\u2019s a reluctance in the community to identify as immigrants.\u201d Rafael Fernandez said that Venezuelans in Doral saw the latest waves of refugees as a Venezuelan political issue, rather than as part of the immigration wars in America. \u201cTheir stance on illegal immigration is tough,\u201d he said. A few days before Trump announced that \u201cmillions\u201d of people would be arrested in a series of national immigration raids, DeSantis signed a bill to increase immigration enforcement at the state level. Democrats had introduced an amendment to create special protections for Venezuelans, but Republicans voted it down. Annette Taddeo, a Democratic state senator from Miami, told me, \u201cAll the representatives who stand with the Venezuelan flag, who go to the Arepazo\u201d\u2014the most popular Venezuelan restaurant in Doral\u2014\u201cand give all these press conferences, they voted against the amendment to protect Venezuelans against these freaking raids that are coming.\u201d Taddeo and I were at Actualidad for an 8 A.M. show called \u201cProhibido Callarse\u201d (\u201cIt\u2019s Forbidden to Shut Up\u201d), hosted by Roberto Rodr\u00edguez Tejera, who is Cuban, and Juan Camilo G\u00f3mez, a Colombian. At Actualidad, liberals go on the air in the morning, conservatives in the afternoon. The later it gets, the farther right the personalities move; by dinnertime, the hosts are extolling Trump and calling for an armed invasion against Maduro. \u201cIn Miami, they call us the Communists,\u201d G\u00f3mez joked. He was sitting in the recording booth with Rodr\u00edguez Tejera, the pollster Fernand Amandi, and Taddeo, who\u2019s Colombian-American. They were drinking plastic cups of Cuban coffee and discussing the Democrats in South Florida. Mounted on the wall above them were three TVs, tuned to Fox News, CNN, and CNN en Espa\u00f1ol, showing, respectively, segments on \u201ccensoring conservatives,\u201d Robert Mueller, and the latest statements made by Juan Guaid\u00f3. Like many Democrats in South Florida, the four of them wanted Maduro gone, but they had to answer for other Democrats who were less attuned to the situation. Nancy Pelosi hasn\u2019t visited the Venezuelan community in South Florida this year. Bill de Blasio had recently flaunted his Spanish while in Miami by quoting Che Guevara. Last February, when the journalist Jorge Ramos, of Univision, asked Bernie Sanders whether he recognized the Presidency of Guaid\u00f3, he said no. One \u201cProhibido Callarse\u201d listener, who had posted a question for the group on Twitter, wanted to know why it was \u201cso hard\u201d for Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to condemn Maduro. A local Democrat told me that the head of the D.N.C., Tom P\u00e9rez, had done Florida Democrats \u201cno favors\u201d by bringing the primary debate to the state, because it exposed the left wing of the Party. Democrats need to avoid the trap of framing their stance on Venezuela solely in opposition to Trump. \u201cYou have to say, \u2018These guys in Venezuela and Cuba and Nicaragua are bad,\u2019 and then pivot to how Trump is making it worse,\u201d Mora, the professor of politics, said. \u201cThe mentality that what\u2019s happening in Venezuela is all about Trump will just reinforce the Republican narrative that Democrats are either ignorant or sympathetic with the regime.\u201d", "description": "Immigration, taxes, and health care matter, but a foreign-policy issue has taken center stage, Jonathan Blitzer writes.", "authors": ["Jonathan Blitzer", "Jonathan Franzen", "Rachel Syme", "Kameron Austin Collins", "Dan Kois", "Jiayang Fan", "Jon Lee Anderson", "Benjamin Wallace-Wells"], "top_image": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5d7c0cfd37d5a200083cee5f/16:9/w_1200,h_630,c_limit/190923_r34979-tout.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
