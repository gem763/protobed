The improvement in morphology - the size and shape of the sperm - was dramatic.\"\n\nPacey added that he believes the anti-oxidant properties of lycopene could prevent sperm from becoming damaged.\n\nThe team say that the next stage is to repeat the exercise in men with fertility issues to see if the supplement can increase sperm quality and whether or not it can help couples conceive without invasive fertility treatments.\n\nProf Richard Sharpe, a professor at MRC Centre for Reproductive Health at the University of Edinburgh, called the study a \u201csmall ray of sunshine\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe findings could mean that consumption of this tomato extract compound might have a beneficial effect in men with infertility because of poor sperm motility and/or morphology,\u201d Sharpe said.\n\nCommenting on the research, Ying Cheong, professor of Reproductive Medicine at the University of Southampton, recommended that the team expand on their findings with a study that uses \u201clive birth\u201d as the end point.\n\n\u201cThis study, undoubtedly, will add to our current knowledge of yet another anti-oxidant type supplement on sperm parameters, but what the study fails to tell us is if taking lactolycopene supplements improves fertility, that is the chance of actually having a successful pregnancy,\u201d Cheong said.", "description": "A compound found in tomatoes could help tackle fertility problems in men, scientists claim.
