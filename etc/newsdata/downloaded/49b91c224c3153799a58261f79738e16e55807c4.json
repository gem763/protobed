(Getty)\n\nA Dublin-based woman claims Air Canada staff forced her to sit in her own urine during a seven-hour return flight from Bogota, after she was refused access to the restroom.\n\nThe unnamed woman told Dublin Live that during the first leg of her return journey to Dublin last month, the flight was delayed for two hours.\n\nWhen she asked staff to use the washroom facilities, they refused.\n\n\"I asked four times over a two-hour period if I could use the toilet and told a cabin crew member that it was an emergency and I was going to have an accident if they didn\u2019t let me use the toilet,\u201d she told the outlet.\n\nRelated Video: Muslim Athlete Sues Air Canada for Forcing Her to Remove Hijab\n\nThe 26-year-old said she attempted to make her way to the bathroom while the plane was stationary, but she was sternly told by a crew member to get back to her seat.\n\n\"I explained I had asked on several occasions to use the toilet and feared I was going to have an accident that I had already waited as long as I could but the plane wasn\u2019t taking off or taxiing,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s when the crew member named John screamed into my face: 'Get back into your seat now, ma\u2019am,\u2019\u201d\n\nThe woman had no other option but to relieve herself in her seat and then sit in her urine on the seven-hour trip to Toronto, where the flight was scheduled to layover.\n\n\"I was completely humiliated and visibly upset the cabin crew ignored me for the rest of the flight,\u201d she said. \"When I was leaving the plane I looked for the different crew members who I had asked to use the toilet to let them know how disgusted I was at how they treated me but they had cowardly hid at the back of the plane.\"\n\nWhile in Toronto, the woman paid for a hotel room herself so she could clean up and change her clothes.\n\nOn the second part of her journey home, the Dubliner complained to the airline, who admitted that she should have been allowed to use the facilities, as another passenger on the same flight had done so during the delay. She was told that the incident was reviewed by their in-flight management team and the cabin crew had been addressed. As compensation, she was offered a $500 CAD voucher to use on the airline. However, the woman doesn\u2019t intend to use it and felt the airline didn\u2019t do enough.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s good enough that the cabin crew got away with nor is it good enough that I was compensated with a voucher I can only use on Air Canada and not their partners, so I will never use it.\"\n\nThe airline told the Toronto Sun that they have been in touch with the customer.", "description": "She says flight staff refused to let her use the facilities even though she asked four times in a two-hour window.", "authors": ["Elianna Lev"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_jtSn20Zi71RJ.fuTMY77g--~B/aD00MTYwO3c9NjI0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/feb94010-e6c5-11e9-9bf5-3eda8eb84aa8", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
