Bill Weld, one of President Donald Trump\u2019s longshot Republican primary challengers, said that he could support a Democrat in the general election \u2014 even Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)\n\n\u201cCould I vote for a Democrat? Hell yes,\u201d Weld said during an interview at CNN\u2019s CITIZEN conference. \u201cIf it\u2019s Trump against Joe Biden, I\u2019m with Biden in a heartbeat.\u201d\n\nWeld, flanked by fellow Republican primary challengers Joe Walsh and Mark Sandford, proclaimed he would never support President Trump \u201cunder any circumstances,\u201d but could \u201cvery well\u201d support a third-party presidential candidate.\n\nAsked if he could support 2020 presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), the former governor replied: \u201cI suppose I\u2019d rather have her, with a couple of modifications in her platform.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s articulate and bright and quick,\u201d Sanford said of Warren.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s got the energy and the fire,\u201d added Walsh.\n\nWeld went on to argue Biden would be President Trump\u2019s most difficult opponent because \u201che\u2019s a lunch-pail Democrat. He\u2019s a good guy. He\u2019s a centrist, and Trump is not going to be able to play the socialism card against him.\u201d", "description": "Bill Weld, one of Trump's longshot GOP challengers, said that he could support a Democrat in the general election\u00a0\u2014 even Elizabeth Warren.", "authors": ["Joshua Caplan"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/GettyImages-1161065850-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
