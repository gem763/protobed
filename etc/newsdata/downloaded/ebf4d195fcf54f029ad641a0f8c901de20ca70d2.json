With the threat of a no-deal Brexit still looming, the upcoming U.K. jobs data will be watched for further signs of weakness in the economy. Meanwhile, economic data out of China and the U.S. will be in focus as the trade war intensifies.\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know to start your week.\n\nECB in focus\n\nThe is all but certain to approve new stimulus measures on Thursday to boost an ailing economy, but the exact composition of the stimulus package is still unclear. While an interest rate cut seems like a done deal the big question is whether a resumption of asset purchases will be part of the package after some policymakers said it would be premature.\n\n\u201cWhile we doubt that more monetary easing will generate much of a growth effect, doing nothing is not an option anymore, as markets have already priced in additional easing\u201d, economists at ING wrote.\n\n\u201cWe expect a 20 basis point deposit rate cut, a tiered interest rate system for excess liquidity, more generous TLTRO conditions and \u20ac30 billion per month of quantitative easing (though this last point is still being discussed and could be delayed to wait for the Brexit outcome)\u201d.\n\nBrexit uncertainty\n\nA three-month Brexit postponement looks increasingly likely after Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s efforts to take Britain out of the European Union on Oct. 31 with or without a deal have floundered. Johnson lost his majority in parliament last week and has seen his initial bid to call an early general election blocked.\n\nOn Monday, Johnson is expected to make a second attempt to call snap elections, but opposition lawmakers said Friday they would not back an election until the government asks the EU for an extension.\n\nWith the economy showing signs of teetering on the edge of recession Tuesday\u2019s U.K. report will be the highlight of the U.K. data calendar, which also features updates on second quarter growth along with figures on industrial output, construction and trade.\n\nChina data dump\n\nFigures early Sunday showed that China's exports unexpectedly fell in August as shipments to the U.S. dropped 16%, pointing to further weakness in the world's second-largest economy.\n\nBeijing is widely expected to announce more support measures in coming weeks to avert the risk of a sharper economic slowdown, including cuts in some key lending rates.\n\nOn Friday, the People\u2019s Bank of China again slashed banks' reserve ratios, freeing up around 900 billion yuan to shore up the economy\n\nFigures on inflation and factory prices due Tuesday could offer some insight into whether more policy easing is needed.\n\nU.S. data\n\nThe key release to watch on the U.S. data calendar this week is Friday\u2019s retail sales figures for August. Forecasts are for a increase, slowing from a 0.7% increase in July. In the face of slowing exports and investment, shoppers remain a bright spot in the economy.\n\nSept. 1 saw U.S. tariff increases kick in on $112 billion worth of Chinese goods imports, bringing the tax up to 15%. News the two sides are to resume talks in October has soothed some fears but the tariffs will raise the prices Americans pay just before the holiday shopping season.\n\nOther data to watch this week includes Wednesday\u2019s factory gate numbers and Friday\u2019s report on import prices.\n\nTreasury bond/dividend yield inversion\n\nA decline in interest rates on long-term U.S. government bonds below the average stock dividend yield has received less attention than an inverted Treasury yield curve, but it could be a reason stocks find support after a bruising August.\n\nAfter the S&P 500 suffered its first monthly drop since May, equities have gotten off to a solid start in September. The uncommon Treasury bond/dividend yield inversion is providing a level of support.\n\nU.S. Treasury yields have fallen in step with a global bond market rally as global trade tensions have kept recession fears on the horizon.\n\nWhile yields on intermediate-term Treasuries have been below the S&P 500's dividend yield for several months, the long-term 30-year yield inverted at the end of August, the first time since March 2009.\n\n\"Whether it is the Federal Reserve signaling more cuts in the future or just in general this rally in the bond market, overall lower rates - you would think - put some sort of floor on the market as well,\" said Mark Kepner, equity trader at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.\n\n-- Reuters contributed to this report", "description": "Economic Calendar - Top 5 Things to Watch This Week", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEE2D0PD_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
