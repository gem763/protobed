Another study found that inertia \u2014 sticking with the same plan, rather than evaluating the options each year and choosing a better one \u2014 cost workers an average $2,032 annually.\n\nThese findings shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone who has tried to compare multiple health insurance plans offered by an employer, an Affordable Care Act marketplace or insurers with coverage that supplements Medicare.\n\nThere are simply too many moving parts: what you pay each month (your premium), how much you have to pay before insurance picks up a larger share of the cost (your deductible), and the limit on how much you\u2019ll pay in a year (your maximum out-of-pocket), for starters. There\u2019s also how much you\u2019ll owe for each doctor\u2019s visit, test or prescription, which could be a flat amount (your co-pay) or a percentage (your co-insurance), or both.\n\nThese amounts can vary not just by insurance plan, but also by the types of medical service you get, with different amounts for hospital stays, lab work, preventive care and so on. Which prescription drugs are covered varies from plan to plan and from year to year. So does the list of medical providers who are considered \u201cin-network.\u201d\n\nBut we owe it to our health and wallets to make the best choices we can during open enrollment.\n\nBut we owe it to our health and wallets to make the best choices we can during open enrollment. The following steps won\u2019t guarantee you\u2019ll pick the best plan, but they may help you avoid the worst.\n\nMATCH YOUR CONSUMPTION TO YOUR DEDUCTIBLE\n\nMany experts recommend high-deductible plans for healthy people who rarely visit the doctor, since premiums for these plans are lower. But high-deductible plans also can be a good fit for people who need a lot of health care, says Carolyn McClanahan, a physician and certified financial planner in Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nParents of young children or people who have chronic health conditions often spend so much on care that they can easily meet a higher deductible, McClanahan says. Many high-deductible plans (those with deductibles in 2020 of at least $1,400 for individuals or $2,800 for families) qualify for tax-advantaged health savings accounts, as well.\n\nMONEY EXPERT CHRIS HOGAN: HERE ARE TWO HABITS THAT LEAD TO A SUCCESSFUL RETIREMENT\n\nThese plans aren\u2019t a good fit, however, for people who would put off necessary care rather than pay out of pocket. If you don\u2019t have enough savings to cover medical costs until the deductible is satisfied, consider spending more for a lower-deductible plan.\n\nJust don\u2019t pay an extra $500 to lower your deductible by $250, as many people did in that first study. If you\u2019re allowed to choose different deductibles for the same plan, multiply the difference in premiums by 12 to get your yearly cost and compare that to the difference in deductibles.\n\nCALL YOUR DOCTORS\n\nIf you have physicians and specialists you prefer, call their offices to ask if they are in the network of the plans you\u2019re considering. It\u2019s important to ask \u201cAre you in network?\u201d rather than \u201cDo you take this insurance?\u201d A provider who\u2019s not in the network may be willing to bill your insurer, but you\u2019ll typically pay a (much) larger share of the cost.\n\nDO THE \u2018WORST-CASE SCENARIO\u2019 MATH\n\nSome employers offer software that allows workers to upload their claims history from the past year and uses that to recommend a health care plan. I wish that were available to everyone. The closest I\u2019ve seen is HealthSherpa, which helps people winnow their ACA marketplace options based on how they generally use health care.\n\nThe plan that may have been a good fit for your past claims, though, may not be the best choice for the future \u2014 especially if you become seriously ill or injured. To protect against worst-case scenarios, you also need to consider the \u201cout-of-pocket\u201d limits.\n\nANDREW CROWELL: A HAPPY RETIREMENT MAY BE EASIER THAN YOU THINK \u2014 HERE ARE BABY STEPS\n\nThese are the maximum amounts you\u2019d have to pay in addition to your premiums. Out-of-pocket limits typically range from $2,000 to $6,000, although there may be different maximums for in-network versus out-of-network costs, and not all policies have these caps.\n\nSome plans give you only a small break in premiums while exposing you to much larger potential costs, says Alan Silver, senior director of benefits delivery and administration at Willis Towers Watson, a benefits consultant.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nBefore signing up for any policy, add your annual premiums to the out-of-pocket limit to see the potential costs you could face. If the total scares you, look for a plan with a limit that lets you sleep at night.\n\n____________________________________________\n\nThis column was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.
