Happy images of long ago. My cousin Jimmy, one of the toughest, coolest kids you'd ever want to know. Three years my senior. Every Christmas, he wanted the same thing. When it was time to get Jimmy a gift for a special occasion, it was always a case of Chef Boyardee canned ravioli that would make him smile. Man, those were good times.\n\nThe Quarter\n\nLast (Wednesday) night, Conagra reported the firm's fiscal first quarter financial results. The firm posted adjusted EPS of $0.43, which beat by a nickel on revenue of $2.39 billion. The revenue number looks a bit gaudy, but actually missed expectations, and is largely due to the acquisition of Pinnacle Foods in October of 2018. Organic net sales (excluding fluctuations in currency exchange rates, mergers, and sales of other assets) declined 1.7% as softness in the food service sector became apparent.\n\nFor those wondering what brand names among many comprise the Conagra family, think Orville Redenbacher, Peter Pan, Healthy Choice, Slim Jim, Angie's, Banquet, Hunt's, Chef Boyardee, Birds Eye, Marie Callender's, Duncan Hines, Reddi Wip, and Vlasic. I left some out. I am sure you have a few favorite's here. I know I do. Now, all of these brands are not quite created equal. Recent strength for the firm has come from snacks (+2.5%) and frozen foods (+7.2%). I don't eat consumer food sold under the Slim Jim or Banquet brand names, but someone apparently does. Higher production costs forced the firm to raise prices for canned product. This has damaged Hunt's and Chef Boyardee, not to mention adjusted gross margin that fell to 28.3%. The firm largely reaffirmed 2020 guidance, expecting to see EPS somewhere between $2.08 to $2.18 with Wall Street consensus toward the lower end of that range ($2.09). Free cash flow is expected to land around a cool $1 billion.\n\nI will mention something - I like considering the honesty exhibited in reporting the balance sheet. Yes, long term debt is massive. The firm's quick ratio is very low, which to some degree might be expected for a firm that must run operations with almost perpetually large inventories. What I saw was a firm that removed value for \"doubtful accounts\" from the accounts receivable line. I am not sure that everyone always recognizes such issues in timely fashion.\n\nThe Chart\n\nI took several looks at this chart before I really saw anything. At first all I saw was some sideways action since the shares recovered from an early year selloff. I was going to tell you simply that I was going to take a walk. No interest. Then, I took one last look. I realized that though the shares seems to have come well off of the early Thursday morning highs, that these shares have also managed to form a series of higher lows that goes all the way back to March. This may just be an ascending triangle.\n\nIf I am right, a trader could make five or six bucks upon a move toward defensive names should external forces create another round of rotation. If I am wrong, the 50 day SMA stands at $28.90, so potential support is nearby. In addition, the firm pays the shareholder $0.85 annually just to stick around, a 2.85% yield. I think I can find room for this one, and I did not expect to when I started writing this piece. I will wait for you all to read this. After publication, I expect to initiate. For cousin Jimmy.\n\nTrade Idea (minimal lots)\n\n- Purchase 100 shares of Conagra at or close to the last sale of $30.39.\n\n- Sell one CAG December $28 put for roughly $2.25.\n\nNet basis: $28.14 (below 50 day SMA)\n\nTarget Price: $35\n\nWorst Case: Investor ends up long 200 shares of CAG at a net basis of $28.64 with the shares trading below $28.", "description": "I think I can find room for this one, and I did not expect to when I started writing this piece....CAG", "authors": ["Stephen Guilfoyle", "My Chef Boyardee Moment", "Trading Conagra", "I Think I Can Find Room For This One", "I Did Not Expect To When I Started Writing This Piece.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Doug Kass", "Bruce Kamich", "Jim Collins", "Chris Versace"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/e520e70c-e4e2-11e7-8839-bb24648f8ced.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
