That is something I would definitely have liked to see, maybe after the first edition.\u201d\n\nIndia notched up a convincing 203-run win in the opening test against South Africa at Visakhapatnam with an all-round performance and would have a chance to wrap up the three-test series with a game to spare.\n\nWhile the hosts did not name their playing side with a final call to be taken on the morning of the match on Thursday, Kohli said he did not expect any change looking at the pitch, on which India lost to Australia inside three days in 2017.\n\n\u201cIt will have to be a decision taken tomorrow morning,\u201d Kohli said, adding the pitch should be suited to good cricket.\n\n\u201cMore or less our team is settled. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to play that big a factor because when the pitch is damp, it turns as well.\n\n\u201c(But) Unless you have a pitch which has total grass coverage, only then you think of changing your combination too much. Because you know it\u2019s going to dry out at some stage.\u201d\n\nIndia deployed two spinners in Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja and the same number of fast bowlers in Mohammed Shami and Ishant Sharma with Hanuma Vihari the spin-bowling all-rounder in their opening win in the series.", "description": "The World Test Championship has already raised the excitement level in the longest format with points on offer for every match but an away win should earn a team double that is awarded for a victory at home, India captain Virat Kohli said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438787908&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980SQ", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
