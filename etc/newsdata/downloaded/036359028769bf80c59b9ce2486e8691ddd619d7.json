FUNDAMENTALS * The most active wheat futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade were up more than 3% for the week, extending two-week gains to nearly 7%. * Wheat on Thursday hit a high of $5.27 a bushel, the highest since July 15. * The most active soybean futures were down nearly 0.5% for the week, the first weekly loss in a month. * The most active corn futures down nearly 1% for the week, the first decline since Sept. 6. * Dry weather threatens wheat production in Argentina. * Traders noted that Egypt on Wednesday bought 405,000 tonnes of Russian, French and Ukrainian wheat at prices that were roughly $6 to $9 per tonne higher than what it paid at its previous international tender on Oct. 8. * White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Thursday that China's \"serious commitment\" to buy $40 billion to $50 billion worth of U.S. agricultural goods as part of a so-called Phase 1 trade deal would depend in part on private companies and market conditions.
