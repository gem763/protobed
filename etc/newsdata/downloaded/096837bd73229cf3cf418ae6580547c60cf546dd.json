The bat tested positive for the rabies virus, the health department said.\n\nAccording to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, bats are responsible for about seven of 10 of the rabies deaths among people who are infected in the United States with the virus.\n\nThat large proportion may be because people might not know that bats pose a rabies risk, the CDC said.\n\nBats account for about one-third of the 5,000 rabid animals reported in the United States each year, the CDC said.\n\nThe city\u2019s health department said those who encountered the bat should call the agency at (202) 442-9143 or email rabies.info@dc.gov.\n\nMost bats do not carry rabies, health officials say.", "description": "Bat was euthanized and tested positive, officials say.", "authors": ["Martin Weil", "Local Reporter", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/2CjPNwqvXHPS_2RpuRTKY-p3eVo=/1484x0/www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/twp-social-share.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
