(AP) - Lovie Smith understands the challenge his team will face this weekend.\n\nIllinois is coming off wins against Akron and UConn to open the season, but will host Eastern Michigan on Saturday while dealing with injury issues to some of its best players.\n\nLed by quarterback Mike Glass III, the Eagles (1-1) hope to get their second bowl bid in two years. They are coming off a loss to Kentucky, but played a much better second half - and Smith knows it.\n\n\u201cWe know we\u2019ll have a good Eastern Michigan team coming in,\u201d he said. \u201cBowl team that upset Big Ten opponents last year. Played Kentucky strong this past week. We need to make improvements in all areas.\u201d\n\nRunning back Reggie Corbin, who gained more than 1,000 yards for Illinois last season, suffered a hip pointer in the opener against Akron, missed the UConn win and is questionable against Eastern Michigan.\n\n\u201cWe missed him a lot last week,\u201d Smith said. \u201cInjuries are tough to predict, (such as) how long it will take to recover. Hopefully, Reggie will be ready to go this week.\u201d\n\nCorbin\u2019s backup, Mike Epstein, also was injured in the opener and is out for the season. If Corbin is unable to play on Saturday, Jakari Norwood and Dre Brown will again shoulder the load for the Illini (2-0).\n\nTHE QUARTERBACKS\n\nThe Eagles must find a way to contain Illinois graduate transfer quarterback Brandon Peters, who has completed 65.5% of his passes for 390 yards, seven touchdowns and one interception.\n\n\u201cIllinois has a pretty good quarterback,\u201d Eastern Michigan coach Chris Creighton said. \u201cHe\u2019s very effective in that he can throw and run the ball. It\u2019s a balanced offense and we\u2019re going to need a full defensive effort to stop them.\u201d\n\nGlass has looked good this season for the Eagles, completing 54 of his 75 passes for an average of 262 yards per game, with five touchdowns and two picks. Glass\u2019s favorite targets are Mathew Sexton, who leads all Eagles receivers with 51 yards, followed by Quian Williams and Dylan Drummond.\n\nDEFENSE\n\nEastern Michigan is allowing 30.5 points and 419.5 yards per game. Terry Myrick leads the Eagles with 18 tackles, Turan Rush has one sack and Clay Holford has one interception. Illinois has given up 13 points and 238.5 yards passing per game while holding opponents to just 1.1 yards per carry. Nate Hobbs leads the Illini with 14 tackles, Oluwole Betiku Jr. has five sacks and Michael Marchese has one interception.\n\nSMITH WATCH\n\nIllinois is desperate to get off to a good start in Smith\u2019s fourth season in charge, and a win would give the Illini its first 3-0 under the former NFL coach. He has been mentioned as a coach on the hot seat nearly every year since he took the job.\n\n\u201cWe want to be 3-0,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThat\u2019s been one of our goals: to go through our non-conference schedule 3-0.\u201d\n\nRESPECT THE EAGLES\n\nIllinois offensive coordinator Rod Smith said the Eagles are \u201clegit.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey beat Purdue last year, they\u2019ve been in multiple bowl games. Just watch the film. Turn the film on, watch how they play, how sound they are fundamentally. This\u2019ll be the best team we\u2019ve played this year, and we better be ready to roll,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Eagles\u2019 ground game is averaging 76 yards per game, with Shaq Vann leading the way with 93 yards on 30 carries. The second-half effort against Kentucky has given them confidence going to Champaign.\n\n\u201cWe feel like we forged our identity as a team during that Kentucky game,\u201d Creighton said. \u201cWe believe we can become what we believe we are.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Lovie Smith understands the challenge his team will face this weekend.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Terry Towery"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/07/illinois_uconn_football_85895_c0-297-4938-3176_s1770x1032.jpg?e7786ae91d5000db731755214fd41e34aba1eb20"}
