What's next? Recorded Oct. 14, 2019 at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wis. Dave Birkett and Jeff Seidel, Detroit Free Press\n\nIt's been a minute, but the Detroit Lions billboard brigade is back.\n\nAt least two billboards have popped up around metro Detroit showing a referee with a cheesehead on his head.\n\nThe billboards, we assume purchased by anonymous Lions fans, seem to imply the referees are Packers fans. Monday's 23-22 loss to Green Bay is mired in controversy \u2014 controversial calls or no calls in some cases.\n\nAmid the backlash, the NFL acknowledged Tuesday that it erred in enforcing an illegal hands to the face foul against Lions defensive end Trey Flowers.\n\nThis is not the first time a billboard criticizing officiating during a Lions game has popped up around metro Detroit.\n\nCheesehead billboard on eastbound Interstate 94 between Gratiot and Harper in Macomb County, Michigan.
