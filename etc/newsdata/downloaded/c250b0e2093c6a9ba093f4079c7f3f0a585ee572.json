He has been ferried between the Sydney hospital and Long Bay jail since then to undergo chemotherapy.\n\nThe hospital wing at Long Bay does not provide chemotherapy, making his heavily guarded trips to Prince of Wales necessary.\n\nAfter one of Milat\u2019s first chemo treatments, detectives visited in jail to try to extract a confession \u2014 without success.\n\nServing seven life sentences for the horrific murders of seven backpackers, Milat has also been linked to at least a dozen other unsolved murders. He has always maintained his innocence, refusing to confess to killing the seven people police were able to convict him on.\n\nMilat was found guilty of killing the backpackers over a period of four years, picking them up as they were hitchhiking before driving them to the Belanglo State Forest south of Sydney to murder them.\n\nThe Daily Telegraphreports Milat is under heavy guard in the hospital\u2019s ICU with extra guards being rostered on to watch the brutal killer.\n\nHealth sources told the publication Milat had been moved from the hospital\u2019s heavily guarded prison wing to the ICU this morning.\n\nThe 74-year-old had been making regular trips to the hospital since May and was filmed shuffling through the carpark in September with the help of a prison guard.\n\nThe video, taken by 7News, showed the notorious killer walking slowly out of the hospital before being put in a corrections van to return to Long Bay jail.\n\nIn May, Milat\u2019s nephew Alistair Shipsey told Network Ten his uncle\u2019s condition was \u201cvery bad\u201d and speculated he had a couple of weeks to live.\n\nMilat reportedly lost 20kg in the weeks after his diagnosis and hasn\u2019t been able to eat or keep food down.\n\nMilat was also convicted of kidnapping British tourist Paul Onions, who managed to escape from the serial killer\u2019s vehicle.\n\nNSW Police Minister David Elliot earlier already urged Milat to do \u201cone last honourable thing on his deathbed\u201d and openly answer questions relating to his crimes.\n\nMr Elliott also said Milat should assist police with any questions related to his crimes and any other cases police suspect he may have been involved with.", "description": "Ivan Milat is preparing to die as he waits under heavy guard in the ICU of Sydney\u2019s Prince of Wales Hospital.", "authors": ["Natalie Wolfe"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a34794ce4dafc5b595a0be244637097a?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
