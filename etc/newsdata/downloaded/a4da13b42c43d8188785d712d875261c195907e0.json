However, no date or location have been set.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been no nuclear testing at all,\u201d Trump told reporters as he met South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly.\n\n\u201cAnd the relationships have been very good. ... We want to see if we can do something. If we can, that\u2019ll be great. And if we can\u2019t, that\u2019s fine, we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d\n\nMoon said he hopes working-level negotiations between the United States and North Korea will be held soon to prepare for a third summit, but Trump said he would want to know what would result from a third summit with Kim before agreeing to hold it.\n\n\u201cRight now, people would like to see that happen. I want to know what\u2019s going to be coming out of it. We can know a lot before the summit takes place,\u201d Trump said.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s chief nuclear negotiator, Kim Myong Gil, last week welcomed Trump\u2019s suggestion for a \u201cnew method\u201d in talks on Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear weapons programmes, saying he wanted to be \u201coptimistic\u201d the United States would present the \u201cright calculation method\u201d.\n\nLast week, Trump distanced himself from a suggestion by his former national security adviser, John Bolton, for a Libyan model of denuclearisation for North Korea, saying it \u201cset us back very badly\u201d. Bolton was fired this month, with Trump naming Robert O\u2019Brien as new national security adviser.\n\nBefore his sit-down with Moon, Trump said the two would discuss North Korea\u2019s repeated launches of short-range missiles in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have an agreement on short-range missiles. And a lot of people and a lot of countries test short-range missiles,\u201d he added. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing spectacular about that.\u201d\n\nTalks on renewing a military cost-sharing deal with the United States will begin on Tuesday in Seoul, South Korea\u2019s foreign ministry has said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un shake hands during a meeting at the demilitarized zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas, in Panmunjom, South Korea, June 30, 2019.

In March it signed a deal with the United States to pay 1.04 trillion won ($870.94 million) this year - an increase of 8.2% on the year.\n\nThe agreement expires at the end of this year.\n\nTrump has repeatedly urged the South to contribute more to the cost. \u201cSouth Korea is a very wealthy nation,\u201d he wrote last month on Twitter, adding, \u201cTalks have begun to further increase payments to the United States\u201d.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump and his South Korean counterpart held a summit in New York on Monday to discuss plans to restart U.S.-North Korea talks, as the allies prepare for talks in Seoul on sharing the cost of American soldiers stationed in South Korea.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433133766&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M269", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
