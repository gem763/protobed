And as you could probably guess, there were no belly buttons in sight.\n\nNine of the Miss Universe 1952 contestants who were honoured at a cocktail party/dinner.\n\nThe top 5 Miss Universe contestants including the winner Armi Kuusela.\n\nNote, Armi's sash reads: \"Miss Universe 1953\". That's because up until 1958, the winner of pageant wore a sash dated for the following year.\n\n\n\n\n\nWATCH: Relive the crowning of the first Miss Universe\n\nThough the announcer in the video says that Armi was 18, she had only turned 18 two months after winning the title.\n\nNot only was the young beauty queen the first Miss Universe ever, she was also the first Miss Universe to give up her title shortly before her reign had ended in order to get married.\n\nUp until today, contestants entering the Miss Universe pageant cannot be married or pregnant at the time of the entering the competition or at any point throughout their reign.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Can you believe it's already been 67 years since the very first Miss Universe pageant?
