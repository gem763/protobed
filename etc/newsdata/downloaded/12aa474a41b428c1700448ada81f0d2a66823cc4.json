He began serving the sentence as he finished serving a previous one.\n\nAccording to an Ottawa police officer called as the first witness Tuesday, Rouschop's lengthy record includes convictions for theft, assault and uttering threats.\n\nJustice Robert Smith is presiding over the sentencing hearing, which is scheduled to last until Nov. 22. The Crown plans to call a number of witnesses including police, Ottawa-Carleton Detention Centre staff, parole board staff and a doctor.", "description": "The\u00a0Crown is seeking a dangerous offender designation for an Ottawa man convicted of sexually assaulting and choking two sex-trade workers.", "authors": ["Krystalle Ramlakhan Is A Multi-Platform Journalist With Cbc Ottawa.
