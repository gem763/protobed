Those efforts were then changed to focus instead on removing Amos Hochstein, who was appointed in 2018 and had worked for the State Department under the Obama administration, according to the sources.\n\nSondland's efforts to encourage the Naftogaz leadership change were said to have blindsided and confused American diplomats in both Kiev and Washington, DC.\n\nThe efforts also occurred at about the same time that President Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was pressuring Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Democrats including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, in a bid to help Trump's re-election campaign.\n\nSondland's efforts were said to come at about the same time that Rudy Giuliani was pressuring Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy (pictured) to investigate Democrats\n\nGiuliani (pictured) has come under fire for trying to pressure Zelenskiy to dig up dirt on Democrats as part of a bid to help Trump's reelection campaign\n\nRudy Giuliani is acting as Trump's (left) personal attorney. The issue of changing Naftogaz's leadership was said to have been broached at a May meeting that Energy Secretary Rick Perry (right) attended, along with Sondland, Zelenskiy and U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker\n\nThe sources told NBC News that the Ukrainian government then saw Sondland's Naftogaz leadership change as part of the Trump administration's larger attempts to exert influence.\n\nThe sources said that the Naftogaz leadership issue was broached during meetings in May, between Sondland, Zelenskiy, Energy Secretary Rick Perry and the U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, Kurt Volker, while they were in Kiev for Zelenskiy's inauguration.\n\nDuring the meetings, Perry was said to have stated that there needed to be a 'fundamental change' in the Naftogaz leadership.\n\nBut, an administration official denied that Perry proposed any change to the company's supervisory board, which includes four international members. Instead, the official said that Perry had just offered up four names, as well as some government experts, who could advise Zelenskiy\u2019s office on energy issues.\n\nThe Energy Department official said that Perry didn't recommend that these people should be placed on any board. Among the suggested people were Perry campaign donor and Ukrainian-American Michael Bleyzer and Robert Bensh, who worked for former Ukrainian energy minister Yuri Boyko in the country's pro-Russian government until it was toppled in 2014.\n\nUkrainian officials were said to have been alarmed by the interest in Naftogaz's board, because Giuliani associates Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman had been seeking the removal of the company\u2019s reform-minded CEO as part of a scheme to sell liquified natural gas to the company.\n\nParnas and Fruman - Florida businessmen who were born in the former USSR - were arrested on October 9 on campaign finance charges of planning to funnel foreign money to US political candidates.\n\nIt is unclear if Sondland's effort to change the Naftogaz leadership was made in conjunction with Giuliani or his associates, but it is said that if the leadership change had been made, it could have benefited Parnas and Fruman, as well as corrupt elements in the Ukraine that were looking to eliminate the energy company's independence.\n\nBoth Sondland nor Naftogaz representatives declined to give NBC News comments on the sources' statements.\n\nGiuliani, meanwhile, has denied any involvement with efforts aimed at Naftogaz.", "description": "Sources said ambassador Gordon Sondland pushed for a change in leadership at Ukraine's Naftogaz, to the surprise of career diplomats who saw the move as undermining anti-corruption efforts.", "authors": ["Maxine Shen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/05/19911066-0-image-a-66_1571458630212.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
