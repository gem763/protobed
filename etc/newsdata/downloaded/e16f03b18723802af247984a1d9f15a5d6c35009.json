They will make a huge impact in the team and provide exciting attack options all over the park.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis will be great boost to the internationals, and I can\u2019t wait to see the crowd support that this will generate from our famous Mate Ma\u2019a Tonga supporters.\n\n\u201cAnd it is good to see the RLIF approving these players for internationals. This is great for the game.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear, however, if the Rugby League International Federation has officially given the green light to the registration.\n\nThe Australian Rugby League Commission chairman, Peter Beattie, has previously shut the door on any attempt by Folau to return to the NRL. Beattie is also the deputy chairman of the RLIF.\n\n\u201cOur position on Israel Folau remains the same,\u201d Beattie said in June. \u201cWe are an inclusive game with respect for all. Israel has social media posts online that go against what our game stands for.\n\n\u201cAs it stands, he will not be considered for registration. What Israel chooses to do in relation to his social media posts and his faith is a matter for him.\u201d\n\nThe report also claims neither Folau brother is eligible to play in the inaugural nines tournament in Sydney because it is considered an NRL event.", "description": "The former Wallaby, who was sacked over Instagram post that claimed gay people would go to hell, has reportedly been registered to play for Tonga", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eac140756045b59038806456e257b171c521e7da/0_258_5117_3072/master/5117.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bbaa98942f44aafa98693db7224f37f0", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
