First up: Emmanuel Macron launches effort to reinvigorate small French towns in a very French way\u2014by starting caf\u00e9s. He\u2019s calling it 1,000 Caf\u00e9s, and it \u201cwill be run by Groupe SOS, a charity run by a Macron ally that will receive up to $220 million from the French government to complete its mission.\u201d\n\nUPS\u2019s drone service is the first to receive official airline certification: \u201cThe FAA has granted a Part 135 certification for the logistics giant\u2019s drone business, propelling the little fliers closer to a commercial future.\u201d\n\nThe art of name-dropping: \u201cNicholas Coleridge was given sound advice as an eighteen-year-old intern at a Cornish newspaper called the Falmouth Packet. \u2018Mention as many names as possible in your copy,\u2019 the editor told him. When covering a school sports day, \u2018don\u2019t come back with fewer than a hundred names \u2013 kids, parents, teachers, all of them.\u2019 When filing a story on Port Pendennis marina, \u2018mention every boat \u2013 dinghies, yachts, tubs. Remember, every name printed is a sold copy.\u2019 Coleridge hardly needed this reminder. Only a year or so earlier, when still a pupil at Eton, he had co-founded a contemporary arts society with the motto Lumines Nomine Noscere \u2013 \u2018To get to know the stars by their Christian names\u2019. Brian Eno, Angie Bowie and Elton John were among its first guests. The names never stop dropping in The Glossy Years. From Roman Abramovich to Catherine Zeta-Jones, from Adrenalin Village and Babington House to Wilton\u2019s and the Wolseley, every tub is mentioned.\u201d\n\nA closer look at Milton\u2019s heretical Christ in Paradise Regained: \u201cTo what extent was Milton\u2019s Christology influenced and shaped by the beliefs of Arius, and is this question of any true significance for contemporary Milton scholars? Milton\u2019s theological opposition to include Christ within the traditional Christian Trinity carries great weight; indeed, the scholarly debate over this particular Miltonic heresy has been a lively one extending as far back as Jonathan Richardson\u2019s 1734 defense of Milton\u2019s orthodoxy.\u201d\n\nMichael Schuab reviews Stephen Harrington\u2019s history of Texas: \u201cBig Wonderful Thing, a sprawling history of the Lone Star state, showcases Harrigan\u2019s enthusiasm for Texas\u2014 it\u2019s an endlessly fascinating look at how the state has evolved over the years.\u201d Keep an eye out for David Davis\u2019s excellent review of it in our forthcoming issue. (Not a subscriber? Here\u2019s a fix.)\n\nAn update on Notre Dame: \u201cThe most critical question concerns the spire. Will this be rebuilt in the form designed by Viollet-le-Duc in 1860, as internationally adopted conservation principles recommend, or will it be the object of a contemporary \u2018architectural gesture\u2019, as suggested by the master-mind of Notre Dame\u2019s restoration, President Emmanuel Macron?\u201d\n\nEssay of the Day:\n\nZadie Smith takes a stab at defending fiction in our increasingly unimaginative and incurious age:\n\n\u201c\u2018Re-examine all you have been told,\u2019 Whitman tells us, \u2018and dismiss whatever insults your own soul.\u2019 Full disclosure: what insults my soul is the idea\u2014popular in the culture just now, and presented in widely variant degrees of complexity\u2014that we can and should write only about people who are fundamentally \u2018like\u2019 us: racially, sexually, genetically, nationally, politically, personally. That only an intimate authorial autobiographical connection with a character can be the rightful basis of a fiction. I do not believe that. I could not have written a single one of my books if I did. But I feel no sense of triumph in my apostasy. It might well be that we simply don\u2019t want or need novels like mine anymore, or any of the kinds of fictions that, in order to exist, must fundamentally disagree with the new theory of \u2018likeness.\u2019 It may be that the whole category of what we used to call fiction is becoming lost to us. And if enough people turn from the concept of fiction as it was once understood, then fighting this transformation will be like going to war against the neologism \u2018impactful\u2019 or mourning the loss of the modal verb \u2018shall.\u2019 As it is with language, so it goes with culture: what is not used or wanted dies. What is needed blooms and spreads.\n\n\u201cConsequently, my interest here is not so much prescriptive as descriptive. For me the question is not: Should we abandon fiction? (Readers will decide that\u2014are in the process of already deciding. Many decided some time ago.) The question is: Do we know what fiction was? We think we know. In the process of turning from it, we\u2019ve accused it of appropriation, colonization, delusion, vanity, naivet\u00e9, political and moral irresponsibility. We have found fiction wanting in myriad ways but rarely paused to wonder, or recall, what we once wanted from it\u2014what theories of self-and-other it offered us, or why, for so long, those theories felt meaningful to so many. Embarrassed by the novel\u2014and its mortifying habit of putting words into the mouths of others\u2014many have moved swiftly on to what they perceive to be safer ground, namely, the supposedly unquestionable authenticity of personal experience.\n\n\u201cThe old\u2014and never especially helpful\u2014adage write what you know has morphed into something more like a threat: Stay in your lane. This principle permits the category of fiction, but really only to the extent that we acknowledge and confess that personal experience is inviolate and nontransferable. It concedes that personal experience may be displayed, very carefully, to the unlike-us, to the stranger, even to the enemy\u2014but insists it can never truly be shared by them. This rule also pertains in the opposite direction: the experience of the unlike-us can never be co-opted, ventriloquized, or otherwise \u2018stolen\u2019 by us. (As the philosopher Anthony Appiah has noted, these ideas of cultural ownership share some DNA with the late-capitalist concept of brand integrity.) Only those who are like us are like us. Only those who are like us can understand us\u2014or should even try. Which entire philosophical edifice depends on visibility and legibility, that is, on the sense that we can be certain of who is and isn\u2019t \u2018like us\u2019 simply by looking at them and/or listening to what they have to say.\n\n\u201cFiction didn\u2019t believe any of that. Fiction suspected that there is far more to people than what they choose to make manifest. Fiction wondered what likeness between selves might even mean, given the profound mystery of consciousness itself, which so many other disciplines\u2014most notably philosophy\u2014have probed for millennia without reaching any definitive conclusions. Fiction was suspicious of any theory of the self that appeared to be largely founded on what can be seen with the human eye, that is, those parts of our selves that are material, manifest, and clearly visible in a crowd. Fiction\u2014at least the kind that was any good\u2014was full of doubt, self-doubt above all. It had grave doubts about the nature of the self.\u201d\n\nRead the rest.\n\nPhoto: Solovetsky Islands\n\nPoem: Stephen Kampa, \u201cUpon Perusing a Volume of Systematic Theology\u201d\n\nReceive Prufrock in your inbox every weekday morning.
