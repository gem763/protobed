The Trump Administration Wants to Let Loggers Cut It Down.", "language": "en", "text": "Want the best of VICE News straight to your inbox? Sign up here.\n\nThe Trump administration just declared open season on the biggest temperate rainforest in the world, which naturally stores about half the amount of carbon the U.S. releases every year. If that forest disappears, experts say much of that carbon could wind up in the atmosphere and warm the planet.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Forest Service revealed a plan that, if enacted next year, could let developers build roads and chop down trees in more than half of the Tongass National Forest in southeastern Alaska. The 17-million acre forest, which is bigger than the entire state of West Virginia, has been protected from development since 2001. It\u2019s also remarkably biodiverse and home to robust populations of salmon, bears, moose, and deer.\n\n\u201cLogging not only reduces the forest\u2019s ability to store carbon and the number of trees, it disrupts the soil badly,\u201d Brian Buma, an assistant professor who studies forest ecology at the University of Colorado Denver, told VICE News. \u201cThat can impact salmon streams.\u201d\n\nThe Tongass is particularly adept at keeping carbon out of the atmosphere because its plant life is so dense. The forest and all its biomass hold 3 gigatons \u2014 or 3 billion metric tons \u2014 of carbon, more than any other U.S. forest. In fact, that\u2019s as much as all of the forests in Oregon and Northern California combined, according to Bev Law, a professor researching global climate change biology at Oregon State University.\n\n\u201cStoring carbon in the forests is low-hanging fruit, just letting it stay there, because carbon in the forest is carbon that\u2019s not in the atmosphere,\u201d Law said.\n\nIn his final days of office, President Bill Clinton enacted the \u201croadless rule,\u201d which protects 58.5 million acres of land in the U.S. forest system across 38 states from development, including the Tongass. But in 2003, the Bush administration tried to unsuccessfully roll back the regulation through the courts.\n\nTaking cues from Alaska Republicans like Sen. Lisa Murkowski, the Trump administration has argued that logging will help the economy in sparsely populated Southeastern Alaska, where most industries are losing jobs.\n\n\u201cThe roadless rule has hurt the timber industry, which now consists of just a handful of small, family-owned forest products companies. It also affects mining, transportation, energy and more,\u201d Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Republican of Alaska, said in a statement.\n\nBut critics have noted that the logging industry in southeastern Alaska employs just under 1% of people in the region. Fisheries and tourism together provide a quarter of jobs in the region, and both industries depend on the Tongass remaining intact, according to an analysis from Southeast Conference, a regional business group.\n\nAnd environmental groups \u2014 including Earthjustice, a legal nonprofit that fought the Bush administration\u2019s attempt to rollback the rule \u2014 have already vowed to fight.\n\n\u201cThe millions of ancient trees across this temperate rainforest serve as the greatest carbon sanctuary in the U.S. national forest system, helping us all as a counterweight against the climate crisis,\u201d said Eric Jorgensen, a lawyer with Earthjustice. \u201cThere is no good reason to roll back protections for the Tongass.\u201d\n\nCover image: Brown bear fishing for salmon in creek at Pavlof Harbor in Chatham Strait, Chichagof Island, Tongass National Forest, Alaska, USA.
