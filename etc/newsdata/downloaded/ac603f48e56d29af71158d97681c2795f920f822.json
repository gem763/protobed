The previous week was stacked with Opry performances from country music\u2019s biggest names and brightest stars singing their favorite Parton songs in anticipation for the moment she took the stage Saturday night to celebrate her 50th anniversary as an Opry member.\n\n\u201cThis whole week is very special,\u201d Parton said before she played her first 30-minute set at the Opry\u2019s 7 p.m. show. \u201cI\u2019m just grateful for all of it. Who knows when you\u2019re starting how you\u2019re going to turn out? Now, here I am at 73 years old looking back on my life and thinking, \u2018I\u2019m still here, and they\u2019re still allowing me to feel like I\u2019m important in the business.\u2019 It\u2019s a beautiful wonderful thing.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend singers, including Chris Janson, Margo Price, Dierks Bentley, Emmylou Harris, Toby Keith, Lady Antebellum and Hank Williams, Jr., honored Parton from the Opry\u2019s sacred wooden circle.\n\nCLOSE Dolly Parton's 50th Opry Member Anniversary at the Grand Ole Opry Larry McCormack, lmccormack@tennessean.com\n\n\u201cWe are just over the moon (to be part of Parton\u2019s celebration),\u201d said Lady Antebellum\u2019s Hillary Scott. She and the trio\u2019s Charles Kelley reinvented the Parton/Kenny Rogers classic \u201cIslands in the Stream.\u201d \u201cI feel so blessed we got to sing this song tonight.\u201d\n\nFriday and Saturday night shows were filmed for an NBC television special dubbed \u201cDolly Parton: 50 Years at the Grand Ole Opry\u201d that will air 8 p.m. Nov. 26 on the network.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a great honor to be a part of the Grand Ole Opry all these years,\u201d Parton said. \u201cIt was always my dream. To have a whole celebration and to have it televised, it\u2019s really a wonderful thing to round out my life like that. So, if I die the day after tomorrow \u2026 I\u2019m not going anywhere. I just meant, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t this be a great way to go?\u2019\u201d\n\nDolly Parton poses for the camera before a press conference at her 50th Opry Member Anniversary at the Grand Ole Opry Saturday, Oct. 12, 2019, in Nashville, Tenn. (Photo: Larry McCormack / The Tennessean)\n\nParton wowed the crowd with songs that span her decades-long career. After strutting to her spot center stage, she introduced \u201cJoshua,\u201d which she said was one of her first big country records.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about an ole boy I fell in love with back there in the Smokies,\u201d she explained before launching into the song. \u201cThat takes me back in time. I\u2019ve been writing songs since I was a little ole bitty thing. I used to love to write songs because back in the early days we didn\u2019t have a lot of television, and we didn\u2019t get to go to the movies. I\u2019d write stories and paint pictures, and I\u2019d sing them to my family. We felt like we were going to the movies. Some of them are true. Some of them are false, and some of them are based on a thread of truth \u2013 like this one.\u201d\n\nParton launched into her famous \u201cJolene,\u201d the impetus for one of her new Netflix movies starring Julianne Hough as the title character that will be out later this year.\n\nAt the end of the song, someone in the audience yelled: \u201cI love you, Dolly.\u201d\n\nShe quipped: \u201cI told you to wait in the truck.\u201d\n\n'Never leave a rhinestone unturned'\n\nThe crowd roared. Her bedazzled dulcimer was on stage waiting, and the Country Music Hall of Famer eased onto a stool and put the instrument across her lap.\n\n\u201cI never leave a rhinestone unturned,\u201d she said.\n\nParton, a native of Sevier County in East Tennessee, followed with \u201cMy Tennessee Mountain Home.\u201d On the same sentimental heartstring, she moved into stories about her beloved parents Avie Lee and Robert Parton. She talked about how her mother made their clothes, sewed curtains for their home from feed sacks, and taught them that just because they had nothing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not complaining,\u201d Parton said. \u201cWe were poor, but those memories have made me rich and not in money \u2013 but in gratefulness and being humble.\u201d\n\nThe sentiment inspired one of Parton\u2019s signature hits \u201cCoat of Many Colors,\u201d which she performed. The singer said that after the song was successful, she told her mother she wanted to take her to Knoxville and buy her a mink coat. Her mother soundly rejected the offer.\n\nDolly Parton performs at her 50th Opry Member Anniversary at the Grand Ole Opry Saturday, Oct. 12, 2019, in Nashville, Tenn.

Where am I gonna wear a mink coat around here?\u201d Parton remembers her mother asking. \u201cBesides, I don\u2019t want something that something has already wore. Just give me the money.\u201d\n\nParton gave her the money.\n\n\u201cRight after I lost Mama several years ago, it was just so hard for me to sing that song,\u201d Parton explained. \u201cNow it\u2019s like a sweet spirit in my heart brings her back to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere You Come Again\u201d made her setlist as did an energetic version of \u201c9 to 5.\u201d Parton, who launched her career performing with Porter Wagoner, welcomed Wagoner\u2019s famed banjo player Buck Trent on stage to join her for Wagoner\u2019s biggest hit \u201cCarroll County Accident.\u201d\n\nShe closed her set with \u201cI Will Always Love You.\u201d\n\nCrowd members wiped away tears. As she did following every song, Parton received a standing ovation. And that\u2019s not all she received. At a backstage reception between shows, Tennessee\u2019s Governor Bill Lee presented Parton with a proclamation declaring Oct. 12 Dolly Parton Day.\n\n\u201cI just love this, and I feel very special,\u201d Parton said. \u201cWhat else you got for me?\u201d\n\nNine hours after the 73-year-old Parton did her first interview of the day at the Grand Ole Opry House, she returned to the stage and played her show all over again for the next crowd.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.tennessean.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/10/13/dolly-parton-celebrates-50-years-member-grand-ole-opry/3945923002/", "description": "\u201cDolly Parton: 50 Years at the Grand Ole Opry\u201d will air 8 p.m. Nov. 26 on NBC.", "authors": ["Cindy Watts", "Published A.M.
