He was listed with a thigh injury for the first time on Wednesday, four days after Washington\u2019s win over the Miami Dolphins. The 31-year-old has also been battling a hand injury but has played through that.\n\nThis is Norman\u2019s first missed game since Week 7 of the 2017 season. Fabian Moreau is expected to start outside opposite of Quinton Dunbar and rookie Jimmy Moreland will slide into the slot.\n\nOf the Redskins\u2019 seven inactives this week, six are injured.\n\nThe Redskins announced Friday that running back Chris Thompson (toe), tight end Vernon Davis (concussion), guard Wes Martin (chest), linebacker Josh Harvey-Clemons (hamstring) and safety Deshazor Everett (ankle) would be out against the 49ers.\n\nWith Thompson out, the Redskins promoted running back Craig Reynolds from the practice squad and waived wideout Cam Sims.\n\nQuarterback Colt McCoy was also listed inactive.
