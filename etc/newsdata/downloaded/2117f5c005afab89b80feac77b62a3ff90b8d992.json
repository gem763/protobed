He revealed that although he, his wife Mitzi and their 18-year-old daughter Herta were Catholics, his wife was classified as Jewish under the Nuremberg laws, meaning they would lose their home - or he, as an Aryan, could stay if they separated, but the bookseller would not consider this.\n\nNazi laws had revoked citizenship for Jews - and banned Jewish people from marrying or having sexual relations with persons of 'German or related blood.' A 'Jew' was defined as a person with three of four Jewish grandparents, regardless of what faith, if any, they practised.\n\nThe next day Mr Buchberger continued speaking with the duchess, describing the persecution Jews faced under the Nazi regime - and showing her his autograph book with the signatures of Austria-Hungary emperor Franz Joseph and Charlie Chaplin, who had stayed at the stately hotel.\n\nOne day during the duchess's stay she found the hotel guarded by Nazi stormtroopers and crowds of 'foolish schoolgirls' who were waiting for propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels with bouquets of flowers. When the Reichsminister arrived, the duchess noticed the shopkeeper turning his back on him.\n\nGerman troops had marched into Austria on March 12, 1938 after the country's chancellor Kurt von Schuschnigg resigned from office, pleading with Austrian forces to not resist the coming Nazi invasion (pictured: Adolf Hitler waves to a crowd from a balcony as Storm Trooper commander and Reichstag president Hermann Goering stands by)\n\nThe duchess promised to help the Buchbergers escape the Nazi danger and emigrate to north America. After leaving Vienna for her home in Paris, she recalled lying to one French official who insisted the family must not rely on the help of the government that she had 'all the necessary funds'.\n\nIn a letter to the Times, the duchess wrote of the need for money to support families she had an interest in\n\nIn a letter to the Times, the duchess wrote of the need for money to support families she had an interest in to help them cross the Atlantic to North America, invoking the heroism of Jewish World War One soldiers she had known who fought for Britain, and asking for donations.\n\nWith the help of the duchess, who received donations totalling \u00a3400 through the post, the Buchbergers fled Austria and sailed from Cherbourg, France to Canada on the SS Montcalm.\n\nRose Zgodzinski, daughter-in-law of the Buchbergers' daughter Herta, revealed that the family moved to Toronto where Karl set up the Old Vienna Bookshop, Herta married a Royal Canadian Air Force flight-lieutenant and the duchess left Europe for New York.\n\nMr Buchberger died of a heart attack in his sleep, aged 49, in 1943. Mitzi died shortly before her 90th birthday in 1983. Herta, who ran the Old Vienna Bookshop alone for 40 years, died in 2012, aged 91.\n\nThe duchess died in France, aged 88, in 1955.", "description": "Lady Millicent Hawes, 70, met Karl Buchberger on a trip to Vienna in 1938 - and helped raise money to help his family, including his Jewish wife Mitzi, escape to Canada.
