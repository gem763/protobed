You\u2019re worrying about the referee stopping it and your opponent targeting it, but there\u2019s another battle outside the ring,\u2019 he told Metro.co.uk.\n\nWallin opened up two deep cuts on Fury (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018Once it\u2019s healed, it\u2019ll never be as tough as it once was. You\u2019ll be thinking about that cut in your next fight.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFury\u2019s first encounter with Wilder ten months ago went down in the history books as an instant heavyweight classic. The 31-year-old twice peeled himself off the canvas and despite displaying astonishing levels of mental fortitude, he knows he will again be facing boxing\u2019s premier knockout artist in Las Vegas.\n\nWBC champion Wilder can count himself among the heavyweight\u2019s hardest ever punchers and is a unique foe compared to his direct rivals, due to his terrifying one-punch knockout ability.\n\nAfter twice knocking Fury to the floor, the Bronze Bomber has promised to finish the job in their rematch, with Fury again expected to play the role of the elusive points scorer attempting to evade the poacher once.\n\nAsked how a cut could continue to affect a fighter, Warrington explained it begins to influence your decision-making in the ring.\n\n\u2018You\u2019ll be a little more cautious in your next fight,\u2019 Warrington said. \u2018You might be worried about going on a certain side because you\u2019ll be thinking about a clash of heads or another punch opening it up again.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018You\u2019ve just got to try and forget about it. Don\u2019t get cut in the first place is my best advice, because it can really mess with you afterwards.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFury is expected to be able to return to sparring in mid December and will fill his time between now and then with a stint in the WWE. After two guest appearances on the wrestling platform, Fury announced he would fight his new arch enemy, Braun Strowman, at the end of this month.\n\nAnd while his wrestling debut may represent a welcome distraction for Fury ahead of his rematch with Wilder, maintaining his focus against the WBC champion could be a far more difficult task than the first time round, given the damage inflicted upon him by Wallin.\n\nFury is occupying his time with a stint on the WWE (Picture: Getty)\n\nFury did a superb job of keeping Wilder guessing during their first fight, marrying his renowned elusiveness with an unshakable focus.\n\nBut, given he is likely to employ a game plan that has so little margin for error, Warrington explained how easily Fury could fall into the trap of wasting crucial mental energy.\n\n\u2018Fighters struggle to recover from cuts,\u2019 Warrington admitted.\n\nWilder and Fury are scheduled to fight again in February (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018Lee Selby is an example of that. He got cut in our fight and he got cut again in the same place in his next fight.\n\n\u2018It can potentially become a recurring injury that happens every time you fight. Will Tyson be expecting that now?\n\n\u2018Thinking about it every time he fights\u2026 Will he concentrate too much on his defence because he\u2019s afraid he\u2019ll be cut again?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Physically a cut obviously affects you in the fight, but I think mentally it can be a big concern afterwards.\n\n\u2018You only want to be thinking about winning a fight.
