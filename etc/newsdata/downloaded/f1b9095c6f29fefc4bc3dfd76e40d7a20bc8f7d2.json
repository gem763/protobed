Democrats who control the chamber say it was a demand to investigate Biden - the president's potential 2020 election rival - and a Ukrainian firm that hired Biden's son Hunter.\n\nOn Monday evening, Giuliani said, \"I don't know Fiona and can't figure out what she is talking about,\" and that the State Department arranged all his contacts with Ukraine, according to The Washington Post newspaper.\n\nLast week, the Times reported that Giuliani was himself under federal investigation for his dealings with Kiev on Trump's behalf.\n\nTrump in September fired Bolton, who is known for his hardline stances on Washington's archenemies, particularly Iran, North Korea and Venezuela.\n\nHill left the Trump administration shortly before the July call with Zelensky.", "description": "Remark came after Trump's former top Russia adviser told US legislators during a closed-door deposition, NYT reports.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/12/41fb71a93a6549b2a8fe2bfdf0068689_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
