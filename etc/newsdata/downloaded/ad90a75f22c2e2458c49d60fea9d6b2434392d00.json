So clearly they\u2019ve got some major announcements waiting in the wings, with a remake of PlayStation 1 game Resident Evil 3 now almost a certainty \u2013 not to mention Resident Evil 8.\n\nBut Resident Evil isn\u2019t a dormant franchise, thankfully, so what else are they thinking of doing? Onimusha is perhaps the most obvious guess, as it recently had a remaster, presumably to gauge current interest in what was, at one time, one of Capcom\u2019s biggest sellers.\n\nDino Crisis is another popular guess, given how well it\u2019d fit the Resident Evil 2 remake formula \u2013 even if it\u2019s only the first game in the series that was ever really popular.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBeyond that it could be almost anything, from Bionic Commando to Viewtiful Joe, Okami, Dragon\u2019s Dogma, Breath Of Fire, Strider, Ghosts \u2018N Goblins, Final Fight, and dozens of others (although we admit we\u2019re kind of hoping we\u2019ve seen the last of Dead Rising).\n\nMarvel Vs. Capcom is also fairly likely, as there have been rumours of Capcom attempting to make a proper Marvel Vs. Capcom 4, and sweeping Marvel Vs. Capcom: Infinite under the carpet.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Capcom Home Arcade is \u00a3200 worth of coin-op classics in one mini(-ish) console\n\nMORE: Devil May Cry 5 review \u2013 diabolically stylish\n\nMORE: Resident Evil 2 remake review \u2013 horrifyingly good", "description": "Things are looking up for Capcom fans wanting to see more classic franchises return but will it be Dino Crisis, Onimusha, or something else?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/5562-dino-crisis-windows-front-cover-030e_1571400016.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
