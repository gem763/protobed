It topped both revenue and earnings estimates but continued to witness a slowdown in Azure sales growth.\n\n\n\nEarnings per share came in at $1.38, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13 cents and improving 21% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues rose 14% year over year to $33.1 billion, topping the consensus estimate of $32.23 billion. The outperformance reflects the company\u2019s success in shifting its business toward Internet-based computing, which includes products such as Office 365, Dynamic 365 and the flagship Azure computing platform. This has become a major source of growth (see: all the Technology ETFs here).\n\n\n\nHowever, the cloud-computing business is witnessing a slowdown. Azure sales grew 59% in the fiscal first quarter, down from 64% growth in the previous quarter. Sales of Office 365 Commercial and Dynamic 365 climbed 25% and 41%, respectively.\n\n\n\nFollowing the earnings announcement, shares of Microsoft were little changed in after-market hours. Currently, Microsoft carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a VGM Score of B. It falls under a top-ranked Zacks industry (top 24%), which suggests its outperformance in the days ahead.\n\n\n\nETFs in Focus\n\n\n\nInvestors seeking to bet on this software leader could definitely tap ETFs.
