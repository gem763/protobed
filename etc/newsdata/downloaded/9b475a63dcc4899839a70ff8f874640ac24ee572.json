Mulvaney essentially admitted to a quid pro quo agreement with Ukraine over security funding, and House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) says it has made things \"much, much worse\" for Trump and company.\n\nWhen asked why the Trump administration withheld security aid to Ukraine earlier this year, Mulvaney didn't just say it was because Trump wanted the country to probe the DNC email hack it likely had nothing to do with. And he didn't just let his comments stand when ABC News' Jon Karl said Mulvaney had just described a quid pro quo. Mulvaney suggested withholding aid was something the U.S. does \"all the time with foreign policy,\" and that the press should \"get over it.\"\n\nSchiff, who is currently leading the House's impeachment investigation into Trump's urging of Ukraine to investigate his political rival, kept his response to Mulvaney's admittance simple. \"Mr. Mulvaney's acknowledgment means that things have gone from very, very bad to much, much worse,\" Schiff said, not saying whether he'd like to bring Mulvaney in for congressional testimony and letting his comments stand from there.", "description": "The G7 at Doral might be the only thing President Trump can look forward to right now.After announcing that the Group of Seven summit would be held at Trump's Miami resort next year, acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney took Trump's impeachment inquiry to a place he certainly didn't want it", "authors": ["Kathryn Krawczyk"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GdyuEMPEJ8M46FOCjN57pQ--~B/aD0xNDM2O3c9MjU1ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/74bb1920-f105-11e9-81ff-45805d39a10c", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
