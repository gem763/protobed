Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) declined to call Syria's President Bashar al-Assad a war criminal during a CNN Town Hall interview with Dana Bash Sunday.\n\nWhat she's saying: \u201cI think that the evidence needs to be gathered, and as I have said before, if there is evidence that he has committed war crimes, he should be prosecuted as such.\"\n\nThe big picture: Gabbard met with Assad when she made a secret trip to Syria in 2017.
