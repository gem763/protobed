Those that mistakenly got us into the Middle East Wars are still pushing to fight. They have no idea what a bad decision they have made. Why are they not asking for a Declaration of War?\u201d\n\nEsper said he would not discuss a timeline for the U.S. pullback, but he said it would be done \u201cas safely and quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nEsper isn\u2019t saying how many U.S. troops will leave the north, but he says they represent most of the 1,000 troops in Syria.\n\nHe also said it appears the U.S.-backed Kurdish forces, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, are trying to \u201ccut a deal\u201d with the Syrian army and Russia to launch a counterattack against the Turks.\n\nBrett McGurk, the former U.S. envoy to the global coalition fighting ISIS, called the unfolding situation a \u201ctotal disaster\u201d and warned that there will be \u201cserious consequences\u201d to the U.S. troop withdrawal:\n\nOnly four days into Turkish attack and one week after POTUS-Erdogan call:\n\n\n\n* UN: 130k displaced (likely to 3x)\n\n* ISIS terrorists escaping (caught after years of painstaking effort)\n\n* Syrians executed on roadways by Turkish-backed opposition forces\n\n* Main US supply lines cut.. \u2014 Brett McGurk (@brett_mcgurk) October 13, 2019\n\n* US forces fired on \u201cdanger close\u201d\n\n* Female politician brutally murdered\n\n* Turkish forces operating well outside \u201csecurity mechanism\u201d area\n\n* Increasingly impossible for US forces to remain in Syria at all\n\n* No plan to take care of anyone who worked with us\n\n\n\nTotal disaster \u2014 Brett McGurk (@brett_mcgurk) October 13, 2019\n\nU.S. military forces withdrawing from northeast Syria, what had been the ISIS caliphate. All without thought, process, or planning. There will be serious consequences for our national security well beyond Syria. For now, may our people get out safely. https://t.co/4FOx446AIU \u2014 Brett McGurk (@brett_mcgurk) October 13, 2019", "description": "Defense Secretary Mark Esper isn\u2019t saying how many U.S. troops will leave the north, but he says they represent most of the 1,000 troops in Syria.", "authors": ["Robert Burns", "Ap National Security Writer", "Ap"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da3269d210000330cacd739.png?cache=mb67duequt&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
