Here\u2019s why.", "language": "en", "text": "Now both are governed by unscrupulous populists. Though Prime Minister Boris Johnson is more articulate and erudite, he and Trump are cut from the same demagogic cloth. Johnson became a conservative journalist, and now the Conservative Party leader, by spreading pernicious myths about the European Union; Trump has uttered a record-breaking 13,435 falsehoods since taking office. Both men are ensnared in sex scandals: Johnson is accused of groping women and providing city contracts to a woman he was having a relationship with while mayor of London, Trump of sexually assaulting women and paying off his mistresses in violation of campaign finance laws.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBoth men stumbled onto their signature issues out of sheer expediency: Trump was for immigration before he was against it, and Johnson could have either supported or opposed Brexit \u2014 whatever was more advantageous. Both made promises they couldn\u2019t possibly keep \u2014 Trump to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for it, Johnson to leave the European Union without any serious financial or political cost.\n\nBoth men are inept at governing. Johnson lost his first seven votes in Parliament and his majority in the House of Commons, and Britain\u2019s Supreme Court ruled that he had illegally suspended Parliament. He might finally achieve a Brexit deal but only by making concessions, such as allowing Northern Ireland to remain de facto in the European customs area, that he would have opposed from anyone else. Trump, for his part, hasn\u2019t reduced illegal immigration (863,016 undocumented immigrants were apprehended at the southwest border in fiscal year 2019 compared with 408,870 in fiscal year 2016), and he has made a shambles of his foreign policy from Syria to North Korea.\n\nNot surprisingly, both men are unpopular: Johnson\u2019s YouGov approval rating is 33 percent, while Trump\u2019s Gallup poll approval is 39 percent. And yet Johnson is heavily favored to win a general election that is expected soon, because he has the good fortune to face an opposition leader even more reviled than him: Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s approval rating is a rock-bottom 23 percent.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe issue isn\u2019t just that Corbyn is personally unlikable, although he is. It\u2019s that his views are so extreme. Under his leadership, the Labour Party has pledged to nationalize energy, water and rail companies; to create a state-owned drug company ; and to abolish private schools. Corbyn is critical of NATO and the E.U., but he has a soft spot for anti-Semites in his own party, for anti-Western dictators such as Fidel Castro and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, and for terrorist groups such as Hamas and the Irish Republican Army. Even many voters who can\u2019t stand Johnson prefer him to Corbyn.\n\nMight something similar happen in America? As was evident in all the criticism she received in Tuesday night\u2019s debate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has overtaken Joe Biden as the Democratic Party front-runner. She is far more likable and far less radical than Corbyn, but in the more conservative context of U.S. politics, she is easily caricatured as a far-left extremist \u2014 an open-borders socialist, as Trump supporters would put it.\n\nWarren supports decriminalizing illegal immigration and providing illegal immigrants free health care; a Medicare-for-all plan that would abolish private health insurance; a Green New Deal that would force a radical revamp of the economy; a plethora of new government programs that would necessitate a big tax hike; and an isolationist foreign policy. (At Tuesday\u2019s debate, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have troops in the Middle East.\u201d Her campaign \u201cclarified\u201d that she wasn\u2019t referring to \u201cnon-combat bases.\u201d But all military bases are designed to support combat operations.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nPolls show Warren defeating Trump but by a smaller margin than Biden \u2014 and that\u2019s before Trump has started to work her over. Democrats should be concerned that Warren has struggled with two critical constituencies \u2014 white, working-class voters and African American voters \u2014 that they need to win. Even many liberal executives are wary of Warren because of her anti-business rhetoric. Like Corbyn, she relies on support from progressive activists who are out of touch with ordinary voters.\n\nThe only way Johnson or Trump can win is by alarming voters about what the opposition party would do. Labour has played into Johnson\u2019s hands by keeping Corbyn as its leader. I fear that if they nominate Warren, Democrats could be playing into Trump\u2019s hands, too.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Corbyn will save Boris.
