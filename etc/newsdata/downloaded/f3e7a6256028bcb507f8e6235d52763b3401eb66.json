REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo\n\n(Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) has asked suppliers to increase production of its iPhone 11 models by up to 8 million units, or about 10%, Nikkei Asian Review reported s.nikkei.com/2nlgcSk on Friday, citing better than expected demand.\n\n\u201cPreviously, Apple was quite conservative about placing orders\u201d, which were less than for last year\u2019s new iPhone, said the Nikkei quoting a source.\n\n\u201cAfter the increase, prepared production volume for the iPhone 11 series will be higher compared to last year\u201d.\n\nSources cited by Nikkei said that the recent surge in iPhone orders is concentrated in the cheapest iPhone 11 model and the iPhone 11 Pro model, while Apple has slightly revised down orders for its top range model, the iPhone 11 Pro Max, which has a starting price of $1,099.\n\nThe newspaper also reported that suppliers remain cautious and said they were concerned that the higher level of orders would not be sustained.\n\n\u201cDemand is good for now. But we have to be careful not to be too optimistic,\u201d an executive-level source said in the report. \u201cI hope that this year\u2019s peak season lasts longer than last year.\u201d\n\nApple did not respond to a Reuters request for comment outside regular U.S. business hours.\n\nThe company launched its three new iPhone models in September and reduced the starting price of the model upgrade, despite better cameras, to $699, compared to $749 for last year\u2019s iPhone XR.\n\n(The story has been refiled to correct company\u2019s ticker symbol in the first paragraph)", "description": "Apple Inc has asked suppliers to increase production of its iPhone 11 models by up to 8 million units, or about 10%, Nikkei Asian Review reported https://s.nikkei.com/2nlgcSk on Friday, citing better than expected demand.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436909475&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930BQ", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
