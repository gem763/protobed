The piece noted that fallout from Trump\u2019s controversial July phone call with the Ukraine president made it \u201ca big week in the news business for visual devices,\u201d like homepage takeovers and jumbo font headlines.\n\nFor the original version of Harris\u2019 article, the headline drew from the famously profane Rahm Emanuel, who used the explicit term to refer to Washington during his time as chief of staff to President Barack Obama.\n\ngood morning from politico mag's headline writer hot damn pic.twitter.com/SttiV3Wcd6 \u2014 Christian Datoc (@TocRadio) September 27, 2019\n\nThe headline was eventually replaced with a sanitized, more prosaic one: \u201cTrump Killed the Seriousness of Impeachment.\u201d\n\nPOLITICO WHY DID YOU CHANGE THE HEADLINE IT WAS SO MUCH BETTER BEFORE pic.twitter.com/zMoK6Jt6Kn \u2014 Christian Datoc (@TocRadio) September 27, 2019\n\nPolitico spokesperson Brad Dayspring didn\u2019t offer HuffPost a specific explanation for the change, saying, \u201cHeadlines are routinely changed by our editors, for a variety of different reasons.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cIf I had to explain the rationale each time a headline changed I wouldn\u2019t have time for anything else!\u201d\n\nThe initial wording \u201cwas up for several hours\u201d and it was not a placeholder, Dayspring said.\n\nSome readers soon began tweeting tributes to the original, sharing screenshots and words of support.\n\nRIP Politico's \"Just another day in Fucknutsville\" headline. Its reign was brief but glorious \u2014 Rosie Gray (@RosieGray) September 27, 2019\n\nThe fucknutsville headline is exponentially superior to the one they have now. \u2014 Asawin Suebsaeng (@swin24) September 27, 2019\n\nI thought the Fucknutsville headline was good. \u2014 Brent Scher (@BrentScher) September 27, 2019\n\nTo those disappointed with Politico\u2019s edit, Dayspring said, \u201cWe\u2019re glad they\u2019re reading!\u201d", "description": "The outlet cleaned up its eye-popping description of the president's besieged administration.
