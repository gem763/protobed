Sunday Times columnist Charlotte Edwardes says the incident took place when she worked at The Spectator, a conservative newsmagazine, while Johnson was its editor.\n\nJohnson\u2019s office said, \u201cThis allegation is untrue.\u201d\n\nEdwardes responded by tweeting: \u201cIf the prime minister doesn\u2019t recollect the incident then clearly I have a better memory than he does.\u201d\n\nJohnson also is under scrutiny for claims that an American businesswoman, Jennifer Arcuri, received money and perks from London coffers while Johnson was mayor of the British capital. He denies wrongdoing.\n\nThe allegations overshadowed the Conservative Party\u2019s four-day annual conference in Manchester, where Johnson is trying to rally the party under the slogan \u201cGet Brexit Done.\u201d\n\nJohnson has vowed that Britain will leave the European Union on the scheduled date of Oct. 31, with or without a divorce deal governing future relations with the bloc. The personal allegations were a distraction from that effort and overshadowed the conference.\n\nTreasury chief Sajid Javid said he had \u201cfull faith in the prime minister,\u201d adding: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to get drawn into personal allegations.\u201d\n\nBut Health Secretary Matt Hancock said he knew Edwardes and \u201cI entirely trust what she has to say.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, opposition parties, who want to prevent a no-deal Brexit, were due to meet in London on Monday to plot their next move.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced political opposition and personal allegations Monday as he tried to fulfill his pledge to lead Britain out of the European Union in just over a month.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/30/Britain_Conservative_Party_74007.jpg-a46b4_c0-0-2415-1408_s1770x1032.jpg?593a41fadf1823b2a4b626707409c472594b543a", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
