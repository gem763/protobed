So \u2018slow and steady\u2019 is the motto for today.\n\nTAURUS April 21-May 21 **\n\nIt\u2019s not the ideal day to take off on a fun holiday or important business trip, as Saturn slows things down or delays travel plans. If you must make a move, then double-check your itinerary carefully.\n\nGEMINI May 22-June 21 **\n\nWhen it comes to financial matters today, keep it simple and try not to stress about things that you can\u2019t change. If you are expecting money from someone else, be prepared to wait.\n\nCANCER June 22-July 23 **\n\nClose relationships will be a challenging juggle today, as many demands are placed on you and your energy levels take a dive. Try to relax, and steer clear of situations that produce extra tension.\n\nLEO July 24-Aug 23 **\n\nCats will feel cranky today! It won\u2019t take much to irritate you, and relations with loved ones or colleagues will be strained. So pace yourself and do all you can to avoid stressful people and situations.\n\nVIRGO Aug 24-Sep 23 **\n\nRelations with a child, teenager or friend will be frustrating today, as you encourage them to do something and they drag their heels. Not everyone shares your conscientious can-do attitude!\n\nLIBRA Sep 24-Oct 23 ***\n\nThe day will progress well if you are discriminating and disciplined; productive and patient. Resist the temptation to critique others though. Let them run their own race and make their own mistakes.\n\nSCORPIO Oct 24-Nov 22 **\n\nExpect a rather challenging day, with financial problems or frustrating friendships. But don\u2019t blame others if things aren\u2019t working out. The only person who\u2019s likely to sabotage your efforts is you.\n\nSAGITTARIUS Nov 23-Dec 21 ***\n\nYou\u2019re feeling rather disorganised at the moment. With the Sun, Venus and Mars visiting your hopes and wishes zone, make your dreams for the future as big and beautiful as possible.\n\nCAPRICORN Dec 22-Jan 20 **\n\nWith challenging Sun/Saturn aspects, the odds are you\u2019ll be stressing about something. If you try to convert others to your way of thinking, you could end up with a power struggle on your hands.\n\nAQUARIUS Jan 21-Feb 19 **\n\nRestless Aquarius - it will feel like one step forwards and two steps back today, as Saturn stymies your motivation and slows your progress. The lesson to learn at the moment is patience!\n\nPISCES Feb 20-March 20 ***\n\nYou\u2019re in the mood to socialise, but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re happy about who you\u2019re fraternising with! If a friend or acquaintance continues playing silly mind games, then perhaps it\u2019s time to move on?\n\nYOUR DAY\n\nThe Sun and Saturn are at odds so expect a stop/start kind of day, when nothing much gets done.\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY\n\nBorn on the zodiac\u2019s Day of High Romance, you love to be in love. 2020 is the year to turn abstract ideas into actual projects.\n\nCopyright Joanne Madeline Moore 2019", "description": "See what the stars have in store for you today.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7894/1f3b9e88cf724ae59a83764fb1fbf371.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
