A YouTube representative told The Verge that Wojcicki\u2019s comments were misinterpreted. The company will remove content that violates guidelines regardless of who said it. This includes politicians. But exceptions will be made if it has intrinsic educational, news, scientific, or artistic value. Or if there\u2019s enough context about the situation, including commentary on speeches or debates, or analyses of current events, the rep added.\n\n\u201cWhen you have a political officer that is making information this is really important for their constituents to see, or for other global leaders to see, that is content that we would leave up because we think it\u2019s important for other people to see,\u201d Wojcicki said.\n\n\u201cThat is content that we would leave up because we think it\u2019s important for other people to see\u201d\n\nWojcicki\u2019s comments come after Nick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s global affairs chief, announced that Facebook wouldn\u2019t take down politicians posts who violated guidelines on its site. Twitter has pledged to take a different approach, saying content that is posted by politicians or political figures won\u2019t be removed because it\u2019s of public interest, but it will be labeled as rule-breaking.\n\nQuestions about politicians breaking social media company\u2019s guidelines have only increased following the election of President Trump, who has often been accused of spreading misinformation or inciting harassment on Twitter. Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter have all come under criticism from academics and journalists for not taking more action against high profile figures that break the company's rules. YouTube in particular has faced harsh criticism for not doing more to remove borderline content from its platform \u2014 that is, videos that don't technically break the company\u2019s rules but are seen as harmful to society.\n\nThe company is working on revamping its rules around what is considered inappropriate content, and is set to make more policy announcements in the coming months.\n\nUpdate September 26th, 5:50AM ET: The story has been updated with comment from YouTube, who says that Wojcicki\u2019s original statement was misinterpreted by Politico. The headline has also been changed to reflect these updates.", "description": "YouTube won\u2019t ban politicians from using its platform even if their content violates the company\u2019s guidelines, CEO Susan Wojcicki said in a public interview on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Julia Alexander", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rHxqSbGxInZ78oi8nf-DyUbgU64=/0x0:6432x3368/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19232932/1146573511.jpg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
