A freedom of information request made public by the US Fish and Wildlife Services also revealed that the hunter, Carl Atkinson, was represented by lawyer John Jackson III, who is also a member of the Trump administration\u2019s International Wildlife Conservation Council, a controversial advisory board that promotes trophy hunting.\n\n\u201cThis is all very concerning,\u201d said Tanya Sanerib, the international legal director for the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cIt signals that the administration is ready to approve, trophy imports from Tanzania despite that country\u2019s history of wildlife mismanagement.\u201d\n\nUnder the Obama administration, the import of elephant trophies from Tanzania was banned \u2013 due to concerns that the government was ineffective at curbing poaching, leading to catastrophic population declines. Under Trump, FWS reversed course and decided to instead evaluate applications to import elephant and lion trophies from all countries on a case-by-case basis.\n\nDocuments released by FWS indicate that the agency justified granting the permit after sending a delegation to Tanzania in November and ascertaining that the country was responsibly managing lion hunting. \u201cBut there\u2019s no indication of what exactly improved or changed over the past couple of years,\u201d Sanerib said.\n\nFWS also contended that the current Tanzanian lion population is thriving at approximately 17,000, but that data was reported by the Tanzania Wildlife Research Institute in 2010.\n\nPart of the problem is that it is very difficult to track lion populations across their large habitat, which covers hundreds of thousands of square kilometers. \u201cIt\u2019s a really daunting prospect to even say whether the population is increasing or declining,\u201d said Craig Packer, a lion researcher at the University of Minnesota who was expelled from Tanzania after exposing corruption in the government\u2019s wildlife management. \u201cThese are shy animals who live across a vast expanse of land.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s equally challenging to track the ripple effects of one lion\u2019s death. Trophy hunters often target mature male lions \u2013 both because these lions are aesthetically appealing and because many countries, including Tanzania, prohibit the killing of male lions younger than six in order to give them a chance to breed. But older males often lead their pack, and hunters who kill these lions can leave a power vacuum, and lions vying to become the new leader will kill the previous one\u2019s offspring.\n\n\u201cAnd besides, unless you\u2019re conducting some sort of a long-term study of known individuals, it can be hard to know a lion\u2019s age by just looking,\u201d said Scott Creel, a conservation biologist at the University of Montana, so hunters could inadvertently kill younger lions.\n\nIn a statement, FWS simply reiterated that \u201clegal, well-regulated hunting\u201d can help fund and promote wildlife conservation.\n\nLast week, the department indicated that it will issue a permit to a Michigan hunter to import the skin, skull and horns from a critically endangered black rhinoceros killed in Namibia.", "description": "Environmental organizations say \u2018very concerning\u2019 move could open floodgates for importing other endangered species", "authors": ["Maanvi Singh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f5bb06f860a3db95fa0e64bb1f212a9c0bdf7d0/0_108_3150_1890/master/3150.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9735498e186adc75deaab2ecbb4578bc", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
