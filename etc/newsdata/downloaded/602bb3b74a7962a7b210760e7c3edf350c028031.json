Rocky Raybell\n\nSeveral times a year, around the border between the U.S. and Canada, STEVEs take to the sky. STEVEs aren\u2019t plaid-clad dudes with dreams of flight, but rather a celestial phenomenon that illuminates the sky with an enormous crescent of mauve light and an accompanying row of dashes of lime-green light. And STEVE isn\u2019t a nickname for Steven, but rather Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement. The physics behind STEVEs has stumped scientists almost as soon as they were officially named in 2017, but a recent study published on April 16, 2019, in Geophysical Research Letters sheds new light on the atmospheric reactions that conjure STEVE\u2019s signature hazy purple ribbon in the sky.\n\nThough STEVEs bear an uncanny resemblance to auroras\u2014which gain their glow from charged particles cascading into Earth\u2019s upper atmosphere\u2014they\u2019re not quite the same thing. In 2018, scientists confirmed that STEVE\u2019s mysterious purple light originated from another mechanism entirely. But no one knew precisely what that mechanism was or how it operated, so they coined it a \u201cskyglow\u201d and called it a day.\n\nNow, scientists understand that the elements of a STEVE originate from two distinct atmospheric phenomenon, writes Toshi Nishimura, a space physicist at Boston University and the lead author of the study, in an email. The researchers analyzed data from satellites passing over eight years of STEVE events. They also contrasted measurements of the electric and magnetic fields in Earth\u2019s magnetosphere against photos of STEVE events to see what caused the mysterious glow.\n\nAnother angle of a STEVE\u2019s mauve glow. Rocky Raybell\n\nThe team confirmed that a STEVE\u2019s row of green lights\u2014which scientists call a picket fence\u2014arises from a mechanism similar to auroras, where energetic electrons streaming in from space collide with oxygen atoms to emit a green light. Except a STEVE\u2019s green fences occur in atmospheres much closer to the equator than normal auroras.\n\nA STEVE\u2019s purple stripe, however, has a much more alluring origin. The light emerges when charged particles in the ionosphere collide, thus creating friction that heats the particles and causes them to emit light the approximate color of an eggplant. \u201cThe purple part is like a stream of excited particles zipping through the ionosphere,\u201d Nishimura says. \u201cInstead of knocking off electrons, this actually generated friction, which heats up the particles and causes them to vibrate and jump about a bit.\u201d He likens the reaction to the process that lights incandescent bulbs, where electricity heats a tungsten filament until it glows.\n\nThough the researchers now know what causes a STEVE\u2019s arc of light, they\u2019re not quite sure why it\u2019s purple. Nishimura hopes to resolve this question in a follow-up study, but he believes nitrogen might be involved, as the element has been known to create a mauve-colored auroral emission in similar altitudes.\n\nBeyond further clarifying the mystery of an atmospheric phenomenon that sounds a lot like a dude from your high school, the study has big implications for radio communication, Nishimura says. The new study reveals that STEVE events are associated with troughs, or holes in the plasma density of the ionosphere. These holes can disrupt radio communication between Earth and space, such as GPS navigation. Spotting a STEVE event help researchers visualize where these holes occur and how they evolve and may even help scientists predict areas of radio communication problems in the future, Nishimura says.\n\nSTEVEs are quite common and easy to spot, especially if you live in New England, British Columbia, or New Zealand. Nishimura says that photos of STEVEs taken by citizen scientists proved crucial for the team\u2019s analysis. So if you see a STEVE, snap a picture and you can help scientists like Nishimura better understand this stunning ethereal occurrence.", "description": "", "authors": ["Jessica Leigh Hester", "December", "Matthew Taub", "November", "Sarah Laskow", "October"], "top_image": "https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvYXNzZXRzLzM5ZDc0NDMyLTMzNmQtNDU5MC05Yzk2LTJlYjFmNjQwOTIyNmMyZjJlM2NlMjliYzY1N2MxZV9BdXJvcmEgTWF5IDd0aCAyMDE2IDI5MC5qcGciXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiIl0sWyJwIiwiY29udmVydCIsIi1xdWFsaXR5IDgxIC1hdXRvLW9yaWVudCJdLFsicCIsInRodW1iIiwiNjAweD4iXV0/Aurora%20May%207th%202016%20290.jpg", "published_at": "2019-04-30"}
