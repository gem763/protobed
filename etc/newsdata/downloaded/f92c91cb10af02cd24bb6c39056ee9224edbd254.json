USA TODAY\n\nCleveland Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield abruptly ended a news conference Wednesday after growing frustrated with a reporter's line of questioning.\n\nThe questions came more than seven minutes into Mayfield's news conference and revolved around a sequence at the end of the first half of Cleveland's 27-13 loss to the New England Patriots on Sunday. Tony Grossi, a reporter with 850 ESPN in Cleveland, asked Mayfield about what he perceived as \"a lack of urgency\" on a two-minute drive before halftime.\n\n\"There was a penalty, so we were in negative yardage,\" Mayfield answered.\n\n\"No,\" Grossi continued, \"but there was a lot of time between snaps.\"\n\n\"Well when the penalty happened, then we were behind the chains,\" Mayfield said, before growing visibly agitated. \"No, no, no \u2014 stop saying 'but.' I just told you, the clock was running and we had a penalty. You want to give them the ball back? No. You don't play. You don't know it. That's just plain and simple.\"\n\nGrossi concluded by asking if Mayfield was happy with the drive, which ultimately fizzled in Cleveland territory.\n\n\"Was I happy with the drive? No. We didn't score points,\" Mayfield said. \"That's the dumbest question you could ask. What? Jesus, Tony.\"\n\nMayfield tweeted later on Wednesday to address his exit.\n\nBaker Mayfield got into a heated moment with a reporter and walked out of his weekly press conference. #Brownspic.twitter.com/lSGxos3Ce8 \u2014 clevelanddotcom (@clevelanddotcom) October 30, 2019\n\nEverybody wants to hear the truth until they actually get it.... I am who I am and always have been. Don\u2019t call it emotional when it\u2019s convenient and then passion when it fits. I care about winning, so yeah I\u2019m frustrated. If I was to act like it\u2019s okay to lose, then y\u2019all would \u2014 Baker Mayfield (@bakermayfield) October 30, 2019\n\nsay that I\u2019ve gotten complacent. My sense of urgency is at an all time high. And if I offend anybody along the way... that\u2019s too bad \u2014 Baker Mayfield (@bakermayfield) October 30, 2019\n\nIt's worth noting that Grossi and Mayfield have not had a particularly warm relationship since the quarterback arrived in Cleveland. In January, Mayfield criticized Grossi for comparing Kyler Murray, who was the quarterback's former teammate at Oklahoma, to Johnny Manziel.\n\n\"He also said he would retire if the Browns drafted me,\" Mayfield wrote of Grossi on Twitter. \"So does anything he say have truth to it? Couldn\u2019t be any more wrong.\"\n\nNevertheless, Wednesday marked another frustrating moment for the team in 2019. The Browns, who entered the season with playoff aspirations, are now sitting at 2-5, and Mayfield has underperformed after a stellar rookie season. He's completed just 57% of his passes thus far in 2019, with six touchdown passes and 12 interceptions.\n\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
