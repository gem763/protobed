OMB is a component of the White House.\n\nEchoing the White House message, the VP, Trump\u2019s private lawyer, and OMB directors sent letters to House Democrats announcing that they would not respect Tuesday\u2019s deadline for them to hand over documents.\n\nAxios reported:\n\nThe counsel for Vice President Mike Pence sent a letter to the chairmen of the House committees investigating President Trump and Ukraine on Tuesday informing them that he will not cooperate with a request for documents in their \u201cself-proclaimed\u201d impeachment inquiry.\n\nMatthew Morgan, a counsel to the vice president, reportedly wrote:\n\nAs noted in the October 8, 2019 letter from the White House Counsel to each of you and to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the purported \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d has been designed and implemented in a manner that calls into question your commitment to fundamental fairness and due process rights. \u2026 Never before in history has the Speaker of the House attempted to launch an \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d against a President without a majority of the House of Representatives voting to authorize a constitutionally acceptable process.\n\nMorgan cited executive privilege as one of the reasons for defying the subpoena.\n\nOn Tuesday, Giuliani wrote on Twitter:\n\nI will not participate in an illegitimate, unconstitutional, and baseless \u201cimpeachment inquiry.\u201d Jon Sale, who is a lifelong friend, has represented me for the sole purpose of analyzing the request and responding. At this time, I do not need a lawyer.\n\nI will not participate in an illegitimate, unconstitutional, and baseless \u201cimpeachment inquiry.\u201d Jon Sale, who is a lifelong friend, has represented me for the sole purpose of analyzing the request and responding. At this time, I do not need a lawyer. pic.twitter.com/l0IR0ikEHD \u2014 Rudy Giuliani (@RudyGiuliani) October 15, 2019\n\nSale sent a letter to House Democrat investigators announcing Giuliani\u2019s decision to defy the subpoena.\n\nEchoing the White House, the letter declared:\n\nGiuliani will not participate because this appears to be an unconstitutional, baseless, and illegitimate \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d. \u2026 In addition, the subpoena is overbroad, unduly burdensome, and seeks documents beyond the scope of legitimate inquiry. Moreover, documents sought in the subpoena are protected by attorney-client, attorney work-product, and executive privileges.\n\nGiuliani \u201cadopts all the positions set forth\u201d in the White House letter from last week, Sale wrote.\n\nOn Tuesday, the White House budget office also sent a letter to House Democrats announcing that the OMB director would not comply with the subpoena.\n\nCiting the letter, the Washington Examiner reported:\n\nThe budget office attacks the Democratic inquiry as illegitimate in a written rebuttal, the content of which was first reported by the Washington Examiner. In a letter sent to the House Intelligence Committee Tuesday evening, the office cites the lack of a vote to begin an impeachment inquiry, longstanding privileges shielding executive branch documents, and the vagueness of the Democratic subpoena.\n\nOMB reportedly said in the letter:\n\nThe House of Representatives has yet to authorize such an inquiry. The Supreme Court has long held that the first step in assessing the validity of a subpoena from a congressional committee is determining \u2018whether the committee was authorized\u2019 to issue the subpoena, which requires \u2018constru[ing] the scope of the authority which the House of Representatives gave to\u2019 the committee.\n\nSo far, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has refused to hold a floor vote to authorize the impeachment probe, arguing that the Constitution does not require her to.\n\nDespite pressure from some Democrats to hold a vote, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the chairman of House Intelligence Committee, on Monday said there \u201cmay not\u201d be a vote.\n\nHouse Democrat leaders warned Giuliani and the OMB director against not complying with the subpoena, saying it would amount to \u201cobstruction.\u201d\n\nEchoing the warning for Giuliani and Vought, the Democrats warned Pence in the subpoena letter:\n\nFailure or refusal to comply with the subpoena, including at the direction or behest of the President or the White House, shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry and may be used as an adverse inference against you and the President.\n\nOMB responded to the threat in its letter announcing Vought\u2019s refusal to cooperate.\n\nThe White House budget office responded to the threat in its letter announcing Vought\u2019s refusal to cooperate, saying:\n\nOMB objects to this extraordinary threat. Invoking reasonable legal defenses to a subpoena, including invoking privileges that are held by the President, in no way manifests evidence of obstruction or otherwise warrants an adverse inference. Indeed, the very idea that reasonably asserting legal rights is itself evidence of wrongdoing turns fundamental notions of fairness on their head and is inconsistent with the rule of law.\n\nSchiff has stressed that Democrats are considering using the power of inherent contempt to fine Trump officials who defy subpoenas $25,000 a day.\n\nThe Democrat-led House Committees on Oversight and Reform, Intelligence, and Foreign Affairs are pursuing the impeachment probe.", "description": "Mike Pence, Rudy Giuliani, and Russell Vought defied Tuesday's deadline for an impeachment inquiry subpoena issued by House Democrats.", "authors": ["Edwin Mora"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Giuliani-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
