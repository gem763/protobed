The third foreign-born manager in the KBO, Williams had a quick message to the passionate fan base of the Tigers coming off a down season.\u201cMy promise is that we\u2019ll do everything we can do as a coaching staff and organization to put ourselves in a position to win a championship. That starts tomorrow when I get a chance to meet all the players,\u201d Williams told reporters at Incheon International Airport, west of Seoul. \u201cThe underlying philosophy is that nothing beats work. Repetition in this game is really important. We have to make sure that when we work, we\u2019re working correctly and we\u2019re working efficiently.\u201dWilliams is inheriting a club that finished in seventh place among 10 clubs this year with a record of 62-80-2 (wins-losses-ties), 11 games out of the fifth and the final playoff spot. They\u2019re only two years removed from a championship season.Though Williams hasn\u2019t seen the Tigers play in person, he said the impression he got from his own research led him to believe he will be managing \u201ca young, talented team with great upsides and potential.\u201d\u201cOur job is to put them in the position to maximize that potential,\u201d he added. \u201cI want to make sure that we\u2019re prepared. That\u2019s important. I am aggressive by nature. We want to compete. We want to be able to walk on the field every day and have a chance to win that game.\u201dThe two American managers that had come before him in the KBO, Jerry Royster with the Lotte Giants from 2008 to 2010 and Trey Hillman with the SK Wyverns from 2017 to 2018, both enjoyed postseason success. Hillman won the Korean Series title in 2018, and Royster took the Giants to the playoffs in each of his three years.Though Williams still has to prove himself here, he enjoyed a far more decorated MLB career than either Royster or Hillman. In addition to his All-Star selections, Williams won four Gold Gloves at third base and four Silver Slugger awards. A World Series champion with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001, Williams retired in 2003 with 378 home runs and 1,218 RBIs in 1,866 games over 17 seasons.Williams became the Washington Nationals manager before the 2014 season and was named the NL Manager of the Year that first year after guiding them to the NL East title. He\u2019d been the third base coach for the Oakland Athletics the past two seasons before taking the KBO job.Williams said he was surprised by the Tigers\u2019 job offer at first, and he\u2019d spoken to Hillman, now a coach with the Miami Marlins, about his experience in Korea.When he got plenty of positive feedback from Hillman, Williams said that \u201csealed the deal for me, for sure.\u201dReminded that Hillman won a championship in his second year in the KBO, Williams said with a smile: \u201cThat\u2019s our objective, too. It all starts tomorrow.\u201dWilliams said his passion for teaching and coaching also nudged him toward a new challenge in a new country.\u201cI love to teach. This is an opportunity for me to keep doing that,\u201d he said. \u201cI love creating a culture that these guys can thrive in and bring out the best of their abilities. I intend to do that and let them be themselves and play. We\u2019re going to play hard, and we\u2019re going to compete every day to get the organization back to where it wants to get to.\u201dAsked what his definition of a baseball team was, Williams said: \u201cIt\u2019s an organization with a single-minded goal and a system in place that will allow everybody to reach that goal. We\u2019ll institute that system starting tomorrow.\u201dYonhap", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/17203732.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
