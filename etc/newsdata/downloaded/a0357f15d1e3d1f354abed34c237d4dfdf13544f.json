Trump.\n\nThis loyalty and effort is not only required at ballot boxes nationwide, but throughout the Bill and Hillary Clinton-controlled fake news media, \u201csnowflake\u201d academia, Hollywood entertainment and deep-state-operative network.\n\nMake no mistake: The Clintons and their long line of former employees and operatives controlling every three-letter D.C. agency are the kingpins behind all #Resistance, Russia-collusion, anonymous op-ed and fake-whistleblower efforts, as well as every new impeachment attempt.\n\nThe Clintons are fiendishly interested in erasing Bill\u2019s brand as the most recent U.S. president to be impeached, while Hillary relentlessly seeks to slyly wiggle the couple\u2019s way back into White House in any way possible.\n\nDo not be fooled. All the incivility, hatred, hoaxes and harassment hurled each day at our politically inexperienced commander-in-chief has been masterminded, financed and deployed in secret by none other than deep-state \u201csupreme leaders\u201d and scorched-earth specialists Bill and Hillary Clinton.\n\nOnly those smart enough to stand up to the Clintons will be able to save our country from the next iteration of the \u201cClinton Foundation.\u201d\n\nBARON CHRISTOPHER HANSON\n\nMcLean, Va.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
