Nadiya is a fantastic teacher, I want to be a fantastic student, but we\u2019re on Strictly Come Dancing, not Love Island or some other show where people get themselves together.\n\n'As I said, I think the chemistry between the two of us is perfect because we know what we\u2019re here for and we\u2019re enjoying the process, even though being in the dance-off isn\u2019t fun.'\n\nFun: When asked by Tess Daly about his time on the show, David said: 'Oh I\u2019ve loved it.
