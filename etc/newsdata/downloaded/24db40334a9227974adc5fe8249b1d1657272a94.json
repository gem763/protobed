My missus actually reads the script and says whether or not I\u2019m doing it. She\u2019s made some good choices.\n\n\"I have to read it and read it and read it, then make it look like it\u2019s the first time I\u2019m saying it.\"\n\n* Samaritans (116 123) operates a 24-hour service available every day of the year.
