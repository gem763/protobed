Even the vocabulary used around it.\n\n'I would say there\u2019s a surrogate who\u2019s given us the gift of carrying our child for us, an egg donor that played a part in the journey, and we\u2019re the fathers.'\n\nHe added: 'For now that\u2019s the information that I wanna put out there. Maybe at some point I\u2019ll find a relevant reason to get into detail, but for me the relevant thing is that the both of us are her parents.'\n\nWhile bandmate Nicky Byrne exclaimed: 'Can I just say... that last five minutes is the evolution of Westlife.\n\nSmitten: The Westlife star, 39, also refused to reveal who the biological father is of Layla saying that the 'relevant thing is that the both of us are her parents' (pictured with Cailean)\n\n'I remember sitting in these situations answering what my favourite pizza topping was for Smash Hits magazine, and now we\u2019re talking about surrogacy.'\n\nMark revealed that he didn't even tell close family friends the exact due date of Layla and that it is a journey he has been 'researching and preparing for years'.\n\nLuckily for the singer, his bandmates have been on hand to share their fatherhood tips - Shane Filan has Nicole, 14, Patrick, 11, and Shane, nine; Nicky Byrne has twins Rocco and Jay, 12, and Gia, six; while Kian Egan has Koa, seven, and Zeke, four.\n\nMark said ahead of Layla's birth: 'The lads have given me loads of advice. A lot of the advice is, until you have the baby in your arms there\u2019s not much you can do.\n\nComplex: Talking exclusively to MailOnline, Mark said: 'Surrogacy is a complex journey. Even the vocabulary used around it.' (pictured with Layla's scan in May)\n\n'Kian gave me car seat advice and then I was up until about half two looking into car seats. This is what my world is inhabited with at the moment.\n\n\u2018But it\u2019s a lot of fun and I\u2019m under no illusion that it\u2019ll be easy and it\u2019ll be all fun and games, but I can\u2019t wait.'\n\nMark also discussed having more children with his fianc\u00e9 Cailean but insisted they will take it 'one step at a time'.\n\nHe said: 'I'm so sensible. At the start of the band, the lads went to pick a Ferrari each. I have the same Jeep I\u2019ve had for seven years.\n\nSweet: Luckily for the singer, his bandmates have been on hand to share their fatherhood tips with Kian Egan offering car seat advice (pictured together on stage in May)\n\n'I\u2019m so overly sensible, I\u2019ve had to fight against my overly sensible self. So, one kid at a time and see how it feels. I will do it one step at a time.'\n\nMark went on to talk about his wedding to fianc\u00e9 Cailean, insisting that they are in 'no rush' to get married and that they would like daughter Layla to walk down the aisle with them.\n\nThe lovebirds became engaged in February this year during an idyllic getaway after six happy years together. At the time, Mark divulged it would be the 'dream' to become a father and have his own kids 'running around' him.\n\nHe sweetly said: 'I'll be honest with you, with the engagement and the baby, that\u2019s a lot of excitement to deal with before you add in a 50-date Westlife tour, and recording an album or anything.\n\n'So, we\u2019re in no rush to get a wedding planned in the immediate future. Personally, I love the thought of the little girl [Layla] walking down the aisle, so we\u2019ll have to just wait and see. So, there\u2019s no date planned.'\n\nMark welcomed his daughter Layla on the 1 October and took to Instagram to reveal he had become a father with fianc\u00e9 Cailean in a heartwarming post.\n\nHe added the caption: 'Baby Layla born safe & sound @ 7.27pm on October 1st 2019! We\u2019re the happiest Dads in the world! x'.\n\nThe couple announced that they are expecting their first child in May before revealing in July that they were set to welcome a girl.\n\nWestlife\u2019s new single My Blood is released today.
