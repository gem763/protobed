It's renowned for being one of the world's healthiest and sustainable diets in the world,' Lee said.\n\nKnown as the 'caveman diet', Paleo eliminates modern foods such as grains, beans, legumes, soy, refined sugar, dairy and processed oils. The style of eating focuses on high intake of unprocessed meat, fish, eggs, limited fruits and vegetables and seeds and nuts (stock image)\n\nLow carb, high protein diet\n\nThe low carb, high protein diet focuses on meat, fish, low-carbohydrate vegetables such as spinach, zucchini and fruits like berries.\n\nThe foods excluded from the diet include grains such as rice and oats, potatoes, gluten products like bread, pasta and cakes and high-carb fruits like bananas and mangoes.\n\nLee said while this diet can lead to short-term weight loss, it usually results in long-term weight gain due to the 'restrictive nature of the diet'.\n\n'By cutting out carbohydrates, we lose the benefits of many important nutrients that can support our gut-health and immune system,' she said.\n\n'Complex carbohydrates are fibre rich and help the functioning of our gut. If you eat unrefined carbohydrates, like fruit, starchy vegetables and some grains like oats, you don't need to fear weight gain.'\n\nIntermittent fasting\n\nIntermittent fasting is a dieting method where you restrict what you eat at different times of the day or the week.\n\nThere are a number of different options available - the most popular of which is the 5:2 approach, which means you consume a total of 600 calories (2510 kilojoules) for men and 500 calories (2090 kilojoules) for women - and fast two days of the week.\n\n'In my opinion, this is a great way to rest the digestive system however, the food consumed on fasting days, should be real wholefoods - not low-fat, processed junk-food, which a lot of people lean towards for convenience,' Lee said.\n\n'By choosing sustainable, organic and real foods, you'll get the most out of intermittent fasting practices.'\n\nShe said studies have found intermittent fasting can improve your metabolism, revamp good gut bacteria and help shed a few kilos but timing of eating is an issue.\n\nSupercharge Your Gut diet\n\nSupercharge Your Gut is a diet that focuses on eating a diverse range of foods, including the 'rainbow' and both probiotics and prebiotics.\n\n'Prebiotics help nourish the probiotics within our digestive system, and without them, our probiotics have a poor chance of survival,' Lee said.\n\nThe foods to eat includes dandelion greens, avocados, bananas, leeks, onions, quality sources of protein and good carbohydrates.\n\n'By supercharging your gut, through consuming easily digestible and delicious foods, you can get your gut glowing, healthy and working at its prime,' she said.", "description": "Australia's leading nutritionist Lee Holmes has offered a guide explaining each popular diet's core concepts, prohibited foods and her recommendations.", "authors": ["Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/01/19376804-0-image-a-235_1570409413214.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
