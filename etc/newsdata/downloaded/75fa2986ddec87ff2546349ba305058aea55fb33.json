Recent incidents, such as Iran's downing of a US drone or the attacks on Saudi oil sites, have already made this clear.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nThe number of countries with military drones has skyrocketed over the past decade, a new report revealed, showing that nearly 100 countries have this kind of technology incorporated into their armed forces.\n\nIn 2010, only about 60 countries had military drones, but that number has since jumped to 95, a new report from Bard College's Center for the Study of the Drone revealed.\n\nDan Gettinger, the report's author, identified 171 different types of unmanned aerial vehicles in active inventories. Around the world, there are at least 21,000 drones in service, but the number may actually be significantly higher.\n\n\"The one thing that is clear is drone proliferation is accelerating,\" Michael Horowitz, a Center for New American Security (CNAS) adjunct senior fellow for technology and national security, told Insider, adding that it is particularly noteworthy that among the countries that have access to military drone technology, around 20 have armed drones, higher-end systems that are becoming more prolific.\n\nAnd the proliferation of drone technology is expected to continue as countries like China, which has emerged as a major exporter of unmanned systems, to include armed drones, and others export drones around the world. \"Drone proliferation is inevitable,\" Horowitz said, explaining that \"current-generation drones are the tip of the spear for the emergence of robotics in militaries around the world.\"\n\nNewer systems are appearing at a rapid rate. \"I think drones will be a ubiquitous presence on future battlefields,\" Gettinger told Insider Thursday, explaining that drone technology is contributing to an evolution in warfare. \"They represent an increase in combat capacity, an increase in the ability of a nation to wage war.\"\n\n\"We are likely to see drones featuring more prominently in global events, particularly in areas that are considered to be zones of geopolitical tension,\" he added, noting that \"we see this playing out in the Persian Gulf, Yemen, the Ukraine, and other conflicts.\"\n\nRead more: US soldiers in Afghanistan are patrolling like never before with these awesome pocket-sized spy drones\n\nDrones come in all shapes and sizes and levels of sophistication, and they have become important tools for both countries and non-state actors such as the Islamic State in several different countries, the Taliban in Afghanistan, and the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nIn recent months, militarized drones have made headlines globally, highlighting the importance of unmanned systems.\n\nOver the past few weeks, for instance, the American MQ-25 Stingray, an unmanned refueling asset expected to serve aboard US carriers, completed its first flight. Russia showed off its new Okhotnik (Hunter) drone flying alongside and working together with the fifth-generation Su-57, an important first step toward manned/unmanned teaming. And, China unveiled a suspected supersonic spy drone and a stealth attack drone during preparations for its National Day celebration.\n\nBut, the incident likely the freshest in everyone's mind is the drone and cruise missile attacks on Saudi oil sites earlier this month, when Saudi oil production was temporarily crippled by systems most air defense systems are not designed to effectively counter.\n\nRead more: The devastating attack on Saudi oil plants confirms the worst fears about low-tech drones in the wrong hands\n\nArthur Holland Michel, who co-directs the Center for the Study of the Drone with Gettinger, previously explained to Insider that the attacks confirmed \"some of the worst fears among militaries and law enforcement as to just how much damage one can do\" with this kind of technology.\n\nHe called the attack a \"wake-up call,\" one of many in recent years.\n\nThe strikes on Saudi Arabia, which the US believes were carried out by Iran, marked the second time in just a few months the US has had to figure out how to respond to a drone-related incident involving Iran, as Iranian forces shot down an expensive US surveillance drone, specifically a RQ-4A Global Hawk high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) drone, in June.\n\nRead more: Iran just shot down one of the US military's most advanced drones \u2014 it costs more than an F-35 stealth fighter\n\nThat incident nearly ignited an armed conflict between the US and Iran. President Donald Trump had plans to attack Iranian missile and radar sites in retaliation, but he called off the attack at the last minute due to concerns about possible Iranian casualties.\n\nThe US reaction, especially the president's stated concerns that killing Iranians in response to the downing of an unmanned air asset was disproportionate, highlights the challenges of responding to attacks involving military drones.\n\n\"The US and other countries,\" Gettinger explained, \"will have to develop a framework for thinking about and understanding enemy unmanned systems and how to deal with them and what their responses should be. Drones are becoming a more important feature of militaries, and the US and other countries will have to have a framework for dealing with that.\"\n\nAddressing these challenges will likely become more important as the technology evolves with advancements in capability to create drones with the ability to fight like unmanned fighter aircraft, manned/unmanned teaming, and progress on swarming.", "description": "30 more countries have military drones than a decade ago. \"I think drones will be a ubiquitous presence on future battlefields,\" an expert said.", "authors": ["Ryan Pickrell"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5b83fc778905f2151d8b4d17?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
