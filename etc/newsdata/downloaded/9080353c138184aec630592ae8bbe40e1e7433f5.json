Seems pretty ideal to me.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMiley, 26, recently addressed those wilder days while slamming reports that she had cheated on Liam with Kaitlynn.\n\nLove is in the air (Picture: Miley Cyrus, Instagram)\n\n\u2018I am the healthiest and happiest I have been in a long time. You can say I am a twerking, pot smoking, foul mouthed hillbilly but I am not a liar.\n\n\u2018I am proud to say, I am simply in a different place from where I was when I was a younger.\u2019\n\nOf course, Miley was referring to those Bangerz days of sticking out her tongue and swinging on a wrecking ball.\n\nMiley and Cody seem pretty smitten with each other. He\u2019s already met her mother Tish Cyrus, who seems to approve, and was right by Miley\u2019s side when she was in hospital with a throat infection.\n\nAnd Cody\u2019s mother, Angie, has also given the green light. Alongside a cosy photo of the new couple, Angie wrote on Instagram: \u2018Puts a smile on my dial to see you both so blissfully happy.\n\n\u2018Hearing your laughs and seeing the smiles on your faces lights up my heart #happyforyouguys #beautifullsouls @codysimpson @mileycyrus.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
