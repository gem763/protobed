It was around an hour after England had beaten New Zealand to secure their place in the World Cup final. Time enough for the adrenaline to settle down and the magnitude of their achievement to sink in. And yet, somehow, something didn\u2019t quite seem to fit. Ford didn\u2019t look like a guy who had just played the game of his life, or scaled the greatest peak of his career.\n\nWhen these two facts were pointed out to him, a puzzled expression crossed his face, as if he had just been snapped out of an extremely long sleep.\n\n\u201cIt was just our next game,\u201d he responded.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nObviously, as a pack of thirsty professional journalists hoping for some electric copy, we weren\u2019t going to let him get off that easily. Still, as we scanned Ford for signs of euphoria or rapture, we found only the same glassy focus that had sustained him through 80 minutes of high-intensity rugby.\n\nClearly, watching England outclass New Zealand and actually being a part of it are two very different sensations. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in it that much, you\u2019re just thinking about what you\u2019re doing next,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe scoreboard is almost irrelevant at times. It\u2019s just about: what\u2019s next, what\u2019s next, whatever opportunity presents itself.\u201d Which is why, too, he wasn\u2019t going to get too excited about the prospect of lifting the World Cup, either. \u201cWe\u2019ve given ourselves an opportunity. That\u2019s all it is.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. England vs New Zealand in 100 brilliant pictures Show all 100 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Zealand in the Rugby World Cup semi-final AP\n\nSeeing as Ford wasn\u2019t prepared to get animated about his performance, we\u2019re going to have to do it for him. It\u2019s ridiculous, in a way, to think that his very selection was in doubt just a few days ago, and may yet be again ahead of the final. Too often, it seems, we get hung up on what Ford can\u2019t do. This was one of those games when it was impossible to ignore what he can.\n\nIt was a magnificent performance. Having played an instrumental role in the first try after just 96 seconds, he then ripped the ball out of Nepo Laulala\u2019s hands just a few minutes later: a stinging riposte to those who questioned his appetite for a scrap. And throughout, he defended with the sort of gusto and front-foot aggression that Jones has always demanded. No Englishman made more than his 15 tackles.\n\nWith Owen Farrell limited by injury, Ford became more pivotal still: assuming not just kicking duties but strategic responsibilities, calling the plays and calling the shots. Against two of the world\u2019s greatest creative backs in Richie Mo\u2019unga and Beauden Barrett, Ford ran the game, directing play, kicking beautifully out of hand and immaculately off the ground. \u201cWe used our kicking game a bit more,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut we used it to score points. That\u2019s the key. It\u2019s still an attacking weapon for us.\u201d\n\nThe other key passage of play came midway through the second half, when New Zealand were handed their only try of the game via a lineout error. For England teams past, it was the sort of blow that would have hobbled them. Haunted them. Instead, they went straight back up the other end and scored three points. \u201cThat was massive for us,\u201d Ford said. \u201cBut again, we were thinking: what\u2019s next? We\u2019re going to chase the kick off as hard as we can. And we\u2019re going to get the ball back.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next? It\u2019s the question that dominated Jones\u2019 team-talk after the game: well done, good win, but for heaven\u2019s sake don\u2019t think the job\u2019s done. It\u2019s a mindset that his players have taken on, too. Beating the All Blacks won\u2019t mean half as much if it\u2019s followed by a meek defeat to South Africa next Saturday. For all the sustained brilliance of the semi-final, its legacy can only be secured by winning the whole thing. England owe it to themselves to finish the job.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re over the moon with the win tonight, but we want to finish this off,\u201d Ford said. And perhaps, in a way, that\u2019s why Ford looked so subdued in Yokohama on Saturday night. Why he didn\u2019t look like a guy who had just scaled the greatest peak of his career. He looked, instead, like a guy whose greatest peak still lay ahead.", "description": "George Ford almost looked flummoxed by the question.
