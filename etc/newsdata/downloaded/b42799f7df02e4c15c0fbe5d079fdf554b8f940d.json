But it shouldn't be.\n\nAs we roll out of the steamy summer and into more snuggly months of October and November, we\u2019re graced with a bevy of seasonal autumn flavors. Maple, chestnut, sweet potato, and yes of course pumpkin. Autumn means fresh selections based on the earthy goodness of the season\u2019s produce.\n\nWhile places like Starbucks have been celebrating autumn with limited edition brews for a while now, it looks like the city\u2019s donut makers are getting in on the action as well. Enter autumn donuts, the season-specific food trend you didn\u2019t know you needed until now. We trudged across the city to hunt down the best of this year\u2019s autumn donuts. Yeah, it\u2019s a tough gig, but someone has to do it. Enjoy!\n\nMister Donut\n\nIf there were a leaderboard for Japan\u2019s autumn donut race, Mister Donut would, without a doubt, come out on top. This year the chain released a whole family of autumn-flavored donuts. The release is proving so popular that when I went hunting for some on a quiet Tuesday afternoon at their outpost in Kichijoji, there was a line of at least 20 people deep. So what do they have to offer? Five fresh flavors in total, one for every variety of sweet tooth. Here\u2019s what the line up looks like:\n\nPlain Sweet Potato Donut: This donut is simple, but deliciously so. Its flavor sweet potato is an autumn favorite molded in the iconic Mister Donut Pon de Ring shape (all of the autumn donuts are). It\u2019s slightly sweet, soft, and chewy and perfect for that morning treat, with a little less guilt.\n\nFor those who crave the soy nuttiness of kinako, the Molasses Kinako is a perfect balance of soft powdery flavor and stick sweet molasses. The texture is almost like a powdered donut, without the overpowering sweetness.\n\nThe Murasaki Imo is the most eye-catching of all the donuts on the lineup. It features bright purple sweet potato icing and black sesame seeds. The icing is thin, but it still packs a lot in the sweetness department.\n\nThe sweetest of them all is the Candied Sweet Potato Donut. Completely coated in deliciously messy caramel glaze and sprinkled with sesame seeds as well. The sugary glaze of the caramel makes the sweet potato donut taste almost savory in comparison.\n\nIf you didn\u2019t get enough of the seasonal flavoring from the plain sweet potato donut, then the Sweet Potato Donut is the one for you. This donut has the same foundations as all the others, but it\u2019s topped with a soft sweet icing-like potato cream and sprinkled with crisp sesame seeds for good measure.\n\nHara\n\nHara is a Kichijoji donut store with a cult following. This cozy corner store sells rustic style donuts made from organic soy milk and okara (soy pulp). So, it\u2019s a little healthier than your average donut. It\u2019s also a little less sweet than most of the other donuts you\u2019ll see around Tokyo. But Hara\u2019s autumn selection is a perfect, satisfying blend of doughy comfort and delicate sweetness.\n\nHara currently has two classic seasonal variations: Marron and sweet potato. Both flavors of the donut feature the Hara donut foundation, a classic bready soybean donut body. It\u2019s the toppings that make the difference. Marron is topped with a smooth, nutty cream-like spread that\u2019s more blended nut than cream; it\u2019s sweet but not overly so.\n\nThe Sweet Potato is slightly sweeter, but only just.\n\nKrispy Kreme\n\nWe all know what Krispy Kreme stands for: Absolute blow out donuts. The donuts are jam-packed with sweetness, coated with tasty, sticky, messy icing, ready to set you off on a sugar-rush that\u2019ll run you through to next season. These three autumn Halloween hybrid donuts are no exception.\n\nPumpkin Custard Jack is a classic Krispy Kreme topped with thick sugary icing and a novel pumpkin decorated the face, complete with pumpkin seed. What makes it super autumnal is that the donut is also stuffed full of pumpkin custard ready to ooze out as soon as you fangs pierce his skin.\n\nApple bobbing is one of the most classic Halloween pastimes, and apples are usually in peak season during autumn. Combine these elements, and you have the Apple Caramel Monster. It also features a pumpkin seed for undefined reasons. Maybe it makes it more \u2018autumn\u2019? Its face is created with a tasty apple and chocolate icing combination.\n\nMarron aka chestnut is one of Japan\u2019s most popular autumn flavors, and our spooky little kitty here is full of sweet, nutty marron cream. The toppings are classic Halloween fare; dark and white chocolate, with a sprinkle of poppy seeds for added texture. There is also the Halloween Sprinkle donut, but it\u2019s pudding flavor which isn\u2019t very autumn, so we\u2019ve left if out of this official list.\n\nNico\n\nAzabu-Juban is unofficially the donut capital of Tokyo in terms of donut shop population density. But surprisingly not many of the outlets we visited had anything in the way of autumn specific donuts. That is except Nico, which had both sweet potato and maple leaf flavor. Nico is another \u2018healthier\u2019 donut option, as this store uses soy and millet powder to make their tasty, chew treats.\n\nThe pastel purple sweet potato version is a low-key but tasty combination of kinako soybean powder sweet potation flavoring. It\u2019s an ideal healthier alternative to your classic sugar-covered donut, with a subtle nutty finish.\n\nThe maple is a slightly sticky donut covered in a thin coating of maple topping which has soaked slightly into the donut, infusing with the earthier flavors of the millet powder donut foundation.\n\nDid we miss your favorite fall-flavored donut?
