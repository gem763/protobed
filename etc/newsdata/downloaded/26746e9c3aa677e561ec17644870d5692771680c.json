Lam\u2019s replacement wouldn\u2019t necessarily stay on for a full five-year term afterward. Leading candidates to succeed Lam include Norman Chan, former head of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, and Henry Tang, who has also served as the territory\u2019s financial secretary and chief secretary for administration, the report added.\n\nNeither Chan or Tang immediately responded to requests for comment on Wednesday. A spokesman for the Chief Executive\u2019s Office said the office does not comment on speculation.\n\nHong Kong Announces $255 Million in Economic Support Measures\n\n\u201cBusiness should not expect that the removal of Lam will end the civil unrest,\u201d Verisk Maplecroft, a consultancy that advises businesses on political risk, said in a note on Wednesday. \u201cNo matter who the next chief executive is, the protesters will continue to demand an independent investigation into police conduct amid widespread dissatisfaction with how the authorities are managing the demonstrations.\u201d\n\nLam\u2019s introduction of legislation allowing extraditions to China sparked months of increasingly violent protests against Beijing\u2019s tightening grip over the city, pushing the economy toward a recession. Her moves to withdraw the bill and invoke a colonial-era emergency law to ban face masks have done little to stem the unrest.\n\nAccording to audio excerpts released by Reuters last month, Lam told a gathering of business people that she had caused \u201chuge havoc,\u201d and would quit \u201cif I had a choice.\u201d She subsequently told reporters that she never asked China for permission to resign over the historic unrest rocking the city.\n\nIf Lam resigns, responsibility for leading the city of 7.5 million would fall immediately to Chief Secretary for Administration Matthew Cheung, who can act as chief executive for as long as six months. Before that interim period ends, the city\u2019s 1,200-member Election Committee comprised overwhelmingly of Beijing loyalists must meet to select a new leader.\n\nHow China Can Recover Even If Hong Kong\u2019s Lam Quits: QuickTake\n\nIn 2005, Hong Kong\u2019s first post-colonial leader, Tung Chee-hwa, resigned after mass protests forced him to withdraw China-backed national security legislation. Tung, a shipping magnate, held onto the job for more than a year after the demonstrations peaked as the party settled on a succession plan.\n\nOpposition lawmaker Claudia Mo said last week that Lam\u2019s resignation could help ease tensions.\n\n\u201cShe can go, if she wants to,\u201d Mo said in an interview. \u201cYou might say, \u2018What\u2019s the point of having Carrie Lam gone? There would just be another puppet in place.\u2019 But at least we can have a new face, and let\u2019s have a restart, if possible, between the government and the people.\u201d\n\nIn her annual policy address last week, Lam tried to appease the economic concerns of poorer Hong Kong citizens with incentives for first-time home buyers and annual grants for students. Still, she didn\u2019t make any new proposals and repeated her opposition to the protesters\u2019 demands, including granting amnesty, an independent police inquiry and the ability to nominate and elect their own leaders.\n\n\u201cHeads need to roll\u201d in order to show the administration is accountable but Lam\u2019s removal would also carry risks for the Communist Party in Beijng, said David Zweig, an emeritus professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and director of Transnational China Consulting Ltd.\n\n\u201cHow many cities in China may have bad situations, unemployment or difficulties particularly going forward if the U.S.-China trade war continues, China\u2019s economy slows down, and people march,\u201d he said. \u201cAre they going to remove mayors? Are they going to remove officials?\u201d\n\n(Updates with analyst comments from fourth paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Natalie Lung, Jason Scott, Blake Schmidt and Fion Li.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Iain Marlow in Hong Kong at imarlow1@bloomberg.net;Belinda Cao in New York at lcao4@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Brendan Scott at bscott66@bloomberg.net, Daniel Ten Kate\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The Chinese government is drafting a plan to replace Hong Kong\u2019s Carrie Lam with an \u201cinterim\u201d chief executive, the Financial Times reported, citing unidentified people briefed on the deliberations.Lam\u2019s successor would be installed by March, covering the remainder of her term should Chinese", "authors": ["Iain Marlow", "Belinda Cao"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/TyjPgUt5xTRTO4Y15VBSpw--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/f165dad4024462cf46eda397cddec65d", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
