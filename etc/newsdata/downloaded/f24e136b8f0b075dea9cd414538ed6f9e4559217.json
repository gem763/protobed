In Asia, Japan's Nikkei was down 2% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng closed up 0.3%. Stock markets in China and South Korea were closed on Thursday.\n\nU.K. stocks were a weak spot in the region, with London's FTSE 100 down 0.5% and the FTSE 250 down 0.4% after a weak reading on the country's services sector and amid fresh Brexit tensions.\n\nThe U.K. services purchasing managers index on Thursday hit a six-month low of 49.5, below the 50 level that marks contraction. The new figures reignited concerns that the economy is in recession, analysts at Capital Economics said in a note, adding that economic performance will remain \"well below par\" while Brexit negotiations drag on.\n\nMeanwhile, European officials gave a cool response to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's new proposals to break the deadlock over Brexit just weeks ahead of the U.K.'s scheduled exit from the European Union.\n\nFresh data also added to the gloomy outlook for the broader European economy. The IHS Markit composite purchasing managers index fell to 50.1 in September from 51.9 in August, the lowest reading since June 2013.\n\nStill, new figures from Eurostat showed retail sales in the euro area were up 0.3% over the month of August, following a 0.5% drop in July.\n\nInvestors were also still digesting news that the U.S. will impose new tariffs on EU goods, including jetliners Irish and Scotch whiskies, cheeses and hand tools, starting later this month.\n\n\"The total size or volume of tariffs being applied to what does amount to quite an array of goods is actually very small when you consider just the goods trade between the U.S. and the European Union,\" said Matt Cairns, rates strategist at Rabobank.\n\nShares in Airbus were up 3.2% on Thursday, while Pernod Ricard gained 3% and R\u00e9my Cointreau was up 5%.\n\nAmong the biggest gainers in Europe was fashion retailer Hennes & Mauritz. Its shares gained 6.4% after the company reported its third-quarter earnings, which showed a 6% rise in net sales with a reduction in markdowns helping operating profits.\n\nThe yield on U.S. 10-year Treasurys dropped to 1.577% on Thursday, from 1.594% on Wednesday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.\n\nThe WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the currency against a basket of its peers, was flat.\n\n\"The economy is fine without further escalation of the trade war, but what does an investor really have in terms of the next step in trade wars?\" said Emiel van den Heiligenberg, head of asset allocation at Legal and General Investment Management. \"No one can really predict what Trump will do next and that makes investors nervous.\"\n\nAmong the biggest gainers in Europe was fashion retailer Hennes & Mauritz. Its shares gained 6.6% after the company reported its third-quarter earnings, which showed a 6% rise in net sales with a reduction in markdowns helping operating profits.\n\nIn commodities, global oil benchmark Brent crude dropped 0.2% to $57.55 per barrel. Gold dropped 0.1%.\n\nLater Thursday, investors will be watching for data on U.S. services activity in September, as well as August factory orders, for clues about growth in the world's largest economy.\n\nJoanne Chiu contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Avantika Chilkoti at Avantika.Chilkoti@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 03, 2019 06:37 ET (10:37 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png"}
