I honestly don\u2019t even know what to say about it. I want to say, I know it wasn\u2019t easy for our colleague Brooke to come forward then, it\u2019s not easy now and we support her and any women who have come forward with claims. And it\u2019s just very painful for all of us at NBC and who are at the Today show. It\u2019s very, very, very difficult.\u201d\n\nBecoming noticeably emotional, Guthrie and Kotb said they were still working to process the difficult situation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking at you and having a weird moment: we were sitting here just like this two years ago,\u201d Kotb told Guthrie. \u201cTruth be told, Savannah and I did a little prayer upstairs before just to sort of sort out what we were going to do. I think you feel like you\u2019ve known someone for 12 years. I don\u2019t know if you guys have ever felt like that. You know someone, you feel like you know them inside and out and then all of a sudden, a door opens up and it\u2019s a part of them you didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nKotb continued: \u201cWe don\u2019t know all the facts on all of this, but there are not allegations of an affair, there are allegations of a crime. I think that\u2019s shocking to all of us here who have sat with Matt for many, many years. So I think we\u2019re going to just sort of continue to process this part of this horrific story and as you said, our thoughts are with Brooke. It\u2019s not easy what she did, to come forward. It\u2019s not easy at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are disturbed to our core,\u201d added Guthrie.\n\nView photos Matt Lauer | Wesley Mann/August More\n\nThe allegations are detailed in Ronan Farrow\u2019s new book Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to Protect Predators, which features an interview with Lauer\u2019s victim, former NBC News employee, whose complaint about Lauer led to his firing in November 2017.\n\n(At the time, her identity was kept anonymous at her request; this is the first time the full details of her allegations have been made public.)\n\nIn the book, obtained by Variety, Nevils claims Lauer anally raped her in his hotel room while working at the 2014 Sochi Olympics.\n\nAccording to Variety, Lauer, 61, pushed Nevils against a door and kissed her before moving to the bed and \u201cflipping her over, asking if she liked anal sex,\u201d Farrow wrote. \u201cShe said that she declined several times.\u201d\n\nShe \u201cwas in the midst of telling him she wasn\u2019t interested again when he \u2018just did it,\u2019 \u201d Farrow wrote. \u201cLauer, she said, didn\u2019t use lubricant. The encounter was excruciatingly painful. \u2018It hurt so bad. I remember thinking, Is this normal?\u2019 She told me she stopped saying no, but wept silently into a pillow.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Meredith Vieira Opens Up About Learning of the Sexual Misconduct Allegations Against Matt Lauer\n\nNevils reportedly claims the encounter was painful and that she \u201cbled for days.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was nonconsensual in the sense that I was too drunk to consent,\u201d Nevils said in the book, according to Variety. \u201cIt was nonconsensual in that I said, multiple times, that I didn\u2019t want to have anal sex.\u201d", "description": "Today's Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb Address New Matt Lauer Allegations", "authors": ["Jodi Guglielmi"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1a0Ia.oQBm8o9IyY2k9JJA--~B/aD04MDA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/b313abd6949ff90f57d94c0958c0c4bd", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
