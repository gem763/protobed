That vote could happen as early as Thursday.\n\nPHOTO: Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) speaks at the Polk County Democrats Steak Fry, Sept. 21, 2019, in Des Moines, Iowa. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call/Getty Images) More\n\nWhile the resolution isn\u2019t on impeachment itself \u2013 only on the process going forward \u2013 the vote will put every member on record on the validity of the impeachment probe. That could be a tough position for both Republicans and Democrats in more moderate districts and pave the way for political attack ads on both sides.\n\nBarbara Comstock, a former Republican congresswoman from Virginia, predicted the GOP will ultimately stick together.\n\n\u201cMy impression is there will not be a lot of breaks,\u201d Comstock told Devin Dwyer Tuesday on ABC News Live's \"The Briefing Room.\"\n\n\"The Republicans will hold on this because they feel the entire process is unfair,\u201d she said.\n\nFormer Republican @RepComstock weighs in on the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry after the text of an impeachment resolution is posted: \"I think unfortunately they started on a very partisan tone.\" https://t.co/NNXSQSH5Y0 pic.twitter.com/E5ys0E2ahc \u2014 ABC News Live (@ABCNewsLive) October 29, 2019\n\nStill worth watching, though, will be Republicans in swing districts like Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan, whose area supported President Barack Obama before swinging behind Trump in 2016. Nevada Republican Rep. Mark Amodei, who supports Trump, faced pushback in his district after saying he supports congressional oversight efforts.\n\nSeveral GOP lawmakers also are planning to retire, making them considered more likely to break ranks, including GOP Reps. Will Hurd of Texas and Francis Rooney of Florida. Neither has ruled out voting in favor of impeachment.\n\nEven if only a few Republicans vote in favor of an impeachment inquiry, any crossover by members of the president's party will serve as a black eye to Trump ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nOn the flip side, Democrats in districts that supported Trump could easily find themselves vulnerable to political challenges because of their vote.\n\nOne of those Democrats -- Rep. Anthony Brindisi of New York -- tells ABC News he doesn\u2019t know how he\u2019ll vote. Another Democrat in Trump country -- Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey \u2013 said he\u2019ll oppose the resolution.\n\n\"I just believe it's the right thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we've spent all this time and all this money, all this energy, all this effort, and all this toxicity exists here, because of what's going on. I want to get bills done.\"\n\nThe cameras start to roll\n\nFollowing the House vote, Democrats are expected to begin calling witnesses for public testimony. Those televised hearings may give Americans a chance to hear directly from people who have worked inside the White House or State Department with direct knowledge of Trump\u2019s actions.\n\nAt the top of the list will be Alexander Vindman, an Army lieutenant colonel assigned to work at the White House, who listened to the phone call before Trump and Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\nIn closed-door testimony, Vindman has already told Congress he thought it wasn\u2019t \u201cproper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen\u201d \u2013 a reference to Trump pressing Ukraine\u2019s president to launch an investigation that included Democrat Joe Biden and Biden\u2019s son, Hunter. Vindman said he thought a foreign-led investigation into Trump\u2019s political rival would \u201cundermine U.S. national security.\u201d", "description": "It\u2019s been only five weeks since Democrats launched an impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, and developments continue to unfold at a breakneck pace.
