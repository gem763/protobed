Its platform allows for the precise engineering of optical properties to provide high resolution analysis of single cells by high throughput flow cytometry.\n\nThe company intends to use the funds to scale, take its labels to market, and to expand and accelerate the development of precision molecular-scale optics for various applications in need of high resolution biology.\n\nPhitonex will be releasing its NovaFluor test kits for multicolor staining this fall, and plans to release more labels for high resolution biology soon.\n\nFinSMEs\n\n10/10/2019", "description": "Phitonex, Inc., a Durham, N.C.-based developer of next generation fluorescent labels for biomarker detection on single cells, closed a $2M seed funding", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.finsmes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Phitonex-300x176.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
