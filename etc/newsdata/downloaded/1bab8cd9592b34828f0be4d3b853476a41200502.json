We\u2019ll see how long it will stand.\n\nDuring Tuesday\u2019s broadcast of Trump\u2019s favorite morning talk show Fox & Friends, Doocy declared that it would be \u201creally off-the-rails wrong\u201d if the president offered a quid pro quo in exchange for the Ukrainian government opening an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nIn the wake of a blockbuster Washington Post report that revealed Trump ordered to withhold nearly $400 million of military aid to Ukraine days before he pushed the Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens, Doocy said that the freeze of money \u201cdoesn\u2019t look like good timing\u201d before offering up a defense for Trump.\n\n\u201cBut, Fox News has confirmed that apparently the president wanted to make sure that the new president of Ukraine understood that if you are going to get this money, we really want you to end corruption before we give you that dough,\u201d he added. \u201cThen there are other stories out about whether or not other allies and other countries were actually kicking in as much money as they should on the world stage.\u201d\n\nCo-hosts Brian Kilmeade and Ainsley Earhardt then rallied to the president\u2019s side, stating that they do not have a \u201cproblem with the timing\u201d of the withholding of aid and claiming that \u201cit\u2019s ridiculous\u201d for House Democrats to be discussing impeachment over this.\n\nDoocy, meanwhile, acknowledged that there should be a scenario that they can all agree is inappropriate.\n\n\u201cIf the president said I will give you the money but you have got to investigate Joe Biden, that is really off-the-rails wrong,\u201d he stated. \u201cBut if it\u2019s something else, you know it, would be nice to know what it is.\u201d\n\nThis didn\u2019t seem to phase his colleagues, however, as Kilmeade went on to say that the whistleblower behind the complaint surrounding the call could potentially be someone who is still upset about the 2016 election and disagrees with Trump\u2019s policies.", "description": "His colleagues, however, firmly defended the president, calling any impeachment talks \u201cridiculous.\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1080,w_1920,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1569337218/fox-and-friends_32_vyu0il", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
