A screenshot made the rounds earlier this week that allegedly listed all the Samsung devices that were going to receive Android 10. The list caused an understandable excitement for some Samsung owners, hopeful that the latest version of Android would hit device of choice.\n\nUnfortunately, the image appears to be fake \u2014 or, at the very least, not the \u201cofficial document\u201d it was originally assumed to be.\n\nAfter the screenshot was circulated by various outlets and tech bloggers, a number of people attempted to corroborate the information as suspicion mounted over the image\u2019s source and legitimacy. Long story short, the image reportedly surfaced from an unofficial Samsung fan page on Facebook, so don\u2019t get your hopes up about any devices you saw on it.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Android 10 isn\u2019t coming to the listed devices, but there is no way to confirm which devices will get the new version of the OS and which will not.\n\nThe point to remember is that leaks and rumours can easily be faked. This is especially wise for fans of consumer tech, where leaks and rumours of upcoming products, patches and features come part-and-parcel with the industry\u2019s release and announcement cycles.\n\nAs with many things in life, it\u2019s always best to approach internet rumours with open-minded scepticism; you don\u2019t need to entirely rule out the possibility, but it\u2019s best to wait for solid evidence before you accept it entirely.", "description": "Don\u2019t believe everything you read on the internet.
