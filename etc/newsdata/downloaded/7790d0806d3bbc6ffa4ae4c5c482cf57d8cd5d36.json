They couldn\u2019t believe what they found. He was kicked off site.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a scandal that Harding was able to get a job which could have given him the keys to residential properties.\u201d\n\nHe also used false ID to con his way into a job at St Modwen Homes\u2019 St Andrews Park development, Uxbridge, West London, but was \u00adbooted out \u00adafter they rumbled him. Harding is also believed to have worked at Persimmon\u2019s The Oaks project in Bicester, Oxfordshire.\n\nOne new homeowner \u2013 who has two young children \u2013 said: \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying that a rapist with such a horrific record could blag that access.\u201d\n\nHarding was brought to justice for raping the businesswoman 24 years after it happened thanks to DNA tests.\n\nHis victim said her life had been wrecked by Harding, who threatened to kill her during her ordeal.\n\nBarratt\u2019s Buckingham development is at an early stage with no complete houses. The firm said: \u201cAn individual was employed after giving a false \u00adidentity. As soon as that came to our attention he was immediately suspended and left the business.\u201d\n\nSt Modwen Homes said it was \u00adtechnically plausible but highly unlikely Harding could have copied keys.\n\nPersimmon declined to comment.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Nicholas Harding had previously been convicted for attacking a woman as she walked home", "authors": ["Dan Warburton", "Image", "Thams Valley Police", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20566275.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_HardingJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
