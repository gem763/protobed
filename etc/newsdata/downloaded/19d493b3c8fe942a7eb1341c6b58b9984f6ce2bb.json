Three sources told Business Insider that Claure would address the company at an all-staff meeting on Wednesday morning.\n\nFor more WeWork stories, click here.\n\nSoftBank on Tuesday formally announced a plan to rescue WeWork.\n\nThe deal ends a tumultuous 10 weeks for the office-rental company \u2013 which filed in mid-August for an initial public offering that was ultimately shelved \u2013 and for its largest investor.\n\nThe plan sees SoftBank invest $5 billion in new financing, buy back up to $3 billion of stock, and accelerate a planned $1.5 billion investment. The Japanese investor will own about 80% of WeWork after the deal closes. Because SoftBank won\u2019t hold a majority of voting rights, WeWork will be a SoftBank associate instead of a subsidiary.\n\n\u201cIt is not unusual for the world\u2019s leading technology disruptors to experience growth challenges as the one WeWork just faced,\u201d SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son said in the Tuesday statement. \u201cSince the vision remains unchanged, SoftBank has decided to double down on the company by providing a significant capital infusion and operational support.\u201d\n\nMarcelo Claure, SoftBank\u2019s chief operating officer, will take the cofounder Adam Neumann\u2019s position as chairman, and the board will add more members. Neumann will become a board observer, which means he won\u2019t have voting rights.\n\nThree sources told Business Insider that Claure would address WeWork staff at an all-company meeting on Wednesday morning. Earlier Tuesday, employees told Business Insider they were outraged about SoftBank\u2019s deal and the lack of communication about their jobs after headlines about major layoffs.\n\n\u201cThe funding provides WeWork with significant liquidity to execute its business plan to accelerate the Company\u2019s path to profitability and positive free cash flow,\u201d the company said in the Tuesday statement, which did not mention job cuts.\n\nRead more: Sex, tequila, and a tiger: Employees inside Adam Neumann\u2019s WeWork talk about the nonstop party to attain a $100 billion dream and the messy reality that tanked it\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier in the day that SoftBank would provide Neumann with almost $1.7 billion. SoftBank\u2019s Tuesday statement did not specify details on his exit package. The Journal reported that Neumann would have the option to sell nearly $1 billion of stock to SoftBank, step down as board chairman, and receive a $185 million consulting fee as well as a $500 million credit line, The Journal said.\n\nA representative for Neumann did not respond to request for comment. A representative for SoftBank declined to comment beyond Tuesday\u2019s statement.\n\nRead more: Leaked video reveals Adam Neumann told staff earlier this year that his family had 100% control of WeWork and that even in 300 years his descendants would be in control\n\nWeWork earlier this year was in talks to borrow $6 billion from banks, a deal contingent on raising at least $3 billion in a public float. But after the company released its initial-public-offering filing in mid-August, investors, analysts, and the media highlighted problems with its business model, conflicts of interest, and leadership. Six weeks later, WeWork\u2019s board of directors ousted the controversial Neumann as CEO and replaced him with two co-CEOs, who shelved the IPO indefinitely.\n\nCo-CEOs\u2019 first weeks in office\n\nAfter taking the co-CEO role on September 24, Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham immediately turned their attention to rescuing WeWork. They looked to sell some of WeWork\u2019s acquisitions and the company\u2019s corporate jet; lay off up to a quarter of the company\u2019s workforce; wind down noncore businesses like WeGrow, its educational arm; remove members of Neumann\u2019s inner circle; and line up billions in funding.\n\nWeWork\u2019s seven-member board tapped the directors Bruce Dunlevie and Lew Frankfort to form a two-man committee to evaluate the plans from SoftBank and JPMorgan, Reuters reported. Dunlevie is a general partner at the WeWork investor Benchmark Capital, while Frankfort was the CEO of the handbag company Coach.\n\nRead more: Inside WeWork\u2019s troubled $850 million Lord & Taylor building: A tale of outsize ambition, audacious renovations, and now financial worries\n\nGot a tip?
