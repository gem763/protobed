It included tours across Quebec, Europe and the U.S., hitting up the summer music festival circuit and a Polaris Music Prize shortlist nomination.\n\nAhead of his highly anticipated appearance at this year's Polaris gala, which will take place at Toronto's Carlu on Sept. 16, Les Louanges has released a new single from his upcoming new EP, Expansion Pack (out Sept. 27). The track, \"Attends-moi pas\" (\"Don't wait for me\" in English), and its accompanying music video follow the musician, real name Vincent Roberge, as he tries to balance a life on the road and at home with friends and family.\n\n\"'Attends-moi pas' is about the hardships of maintaining relationships while on tour, with a fast-paced life,\" Roberge explains in a statement. \"It's about people we leave behind or disappoint, because we're gone all the time, or too busy.\"\n\nDrawing on the same grooving pop sounds that made La nuit est une panth\u00e8re a success, \"Attends-moi pas\" uses swirling synths to create a sense of longing and distance.\n\nThe video, directed by CAO, illustrates Roberge's busy life as he crams into a tour van with his bandmates, signs records for fans, does on-camera interviews and, most importantly, performs for thousands of fans at his live shows. It's a hectic, sometimes lonely job, but the beginning of the clip shows a point of respite where Roberge gets to relax at home in Montreal between stops. It's a candid and brief look at the musician's life before the van revs up once again, and is a poignant reminder that home is always there, waiting for him, when the tour wraps up.\n\nFor more coverage of the Polaris Music Prize, head over to cbcmusic.ca/polaris.", "description": "The new clip follows the musician's busy life on the road and at home in Montreal.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5260462.1566849775!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/les-louanges.jpg"}
