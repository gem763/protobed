The marchers had converged on the town of Tuen Mun, in the west of the New Territories, where some set fire to a Chinese flag as others tore down wooden and metal fences and traffic bollards to build road blocks, at least one of which was set alight.\n\nSome trashed fittings at the Light Rail Transit station, dug up bricks and picked up stones from the sides of the tracks. Others turned fire extinguishers on the police.\n\nMany shops closed their shutters, and police made several arrests. \"Radical protesters damaged facilities in Light Rail Town Centre Station in Tuen Mun with metal rods, hurled objects into the Light Rail tracks and set barricades in the vicinity, causing obstruction to the traffic,\" police said in a statement.\n\n\"Radical protesters also threw petrol bombs, posing a serious threat to the safety of others and police officers.\"\n\nHundreds of protesters retreated from the lines of riot police when the tear gas was fired, many sprinting across a highway to regroup and block more roads.\n\nSome dissipated into malls and side-streets. Dozens of Beijing supporters had earlier torn down some of the large mosaics of colourful Post-it notes calling for democracy and denouncing perceived Chinese meddling in the former British colony which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\n\"I am a Chinese man!\" one the pro-Beijing protesters shouted in defense of his actions when confronted by pro-democracy supporters.\n\nThe walls have blossomed across the Asian financial centre, at bus stops and shopping centres, under footbridges, along pedestrian walkways and at universities.\n\nThey have also occasionally become hot spots of violence in more than three months of unrest. The subway transit operator, MTR, closed stations near potential protest sites, including Tuen Mun.\n\nHong Kong's protests picked up in June over legislation, now withdrawn, that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial. Demands have since broadened into calls for universal suffrage.\n\nA pro-Beijing city legislator, Junius Ho, who has been a vocal critic of the protests, had urged his supporters to clean up approximately 100 Lennon Walls around the city on Saturday.\n\nBut in a message posted late on Friday on his Facebook page, Ho said \"for the sake of safety\" the Lennon Walls would not be cleared up, only the streets.", "description": "Hong Kong police fired tear gas to disperse democracy protesters marching in sweltering heat on Saturday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106142174-1569061441538gettyimages-1169918442.jpeg?v=1569061877", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
