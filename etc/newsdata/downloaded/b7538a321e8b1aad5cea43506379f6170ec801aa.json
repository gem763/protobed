(Leah Millis/Reuters)\n\nInstead of praising Barr for releasing to the public what amounts to an off-the-shelf roadmap for impeachment, Democrats are cavalierly talking about throwing Barr in jail.\n\nEver since Donald Trump came down that Trump Tower escalator to announce his candidacy for president, we\u2019ve heard a great deal about the abuse of norms \u2014 constitutional norms, democratic norms, norms of decency, all kinds of norms. For Trump supporters, the president\u2019s frequent violations of norms, while occasionally regrettable, were for the most part welcome because they proved he was willing to fight to win. This was necessary, the theory went, because the Left didn\u2019t care about norms anymore; they only cared about winning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut this view \u2014 that the other side plays dirty so we must too \u2014 is hardly new to American politics. The sentiment is practically baked into politics. But the degree and intensity of the baking has increased and has come to define whichever side has been out of power over the past few decades.\n\nPresident Clinton\u2019s impeachment on charges of lying under oath to a federal grand jury and obstructing justice came after years of frustration with what was perceived as \u201cSlick Willie\u2019s\u201d flouting of political norms. The 2000 presidential election recount in Florida and the Supreme Court\u2019s role in settling the Bush-Gore recount dispute was all the evidence progressive online activists (called the \u201cnetroots\u201d in pre-Twitter nomenclature) needed to argue that Democrats needed \u201cfighting Dems\u201d to play as dirty as they imagined Karl Rove, Bush\u2019s supposed Rasputin, was playing.\n\nPartisans invariably think the other side is cheating perhaps just a little bit more than they really are, so when they decide to fight fire with fire, they emulate the worst-imagined tactics of the enemy, creating a race-to-the-bottom dynamic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that brings us to the Democrats\u2019 rush to create a \u201cconstitutional crisis\u201d where there isn\u2019t one. Last week, the House Judiciary Committee voted to hold Attorney General William Barr in contempt of Congress for refusing to hand over a fully unredacted version of the Mueller report in compliance with a subpoena.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a wild overreaction given that Barr\u2019s decision to release the Mueller report almost in its entirety was purely discretionary. By law, and by custom, Barr was under no obligation to release anything, since the norm is for the Department of Justice to stay silent if it fails to find prosecutable crimes. His only objectionable transgression against traditional norms was offering a Trump-friendly memo accurately, if tendentiously, summarizing the report\u2019s conclusions.\n\nThat was enough for Democrats to lock in to a \u201ccover-up\u201d narrative. Never mind that Barr soon waived all executive privilege claims and released the whole report, redacting only a sliver of material that relied on confidential grand jury testimony and a few sentences that might reveal sources and methods of intelligence gathering. The latter is stuff the Russians would presumably love to see, the former is stuff Barr is barred by law from releasing. If you read the report \u2014 and by the fact that you can read it \u2014 it\u2019s clear there was no cover-up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a compromise, Barr invited congressional leaders to look at an even more unredacted version. Representative Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, refused to even look at the report, saying a 99.9 percent redaction-free report wasn\u2019t good enough. The notion that a few sentences of blacked-out information are the real \u201csmoking gun\u201d is absurd.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of praising Barr for releasing to the public what amounts to an off-the-shelf roadmap for impeachment, Barr is not only being charged with contempt, but Democrats are cavalierly talking about throwing Barr in jail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Democrats are on much better legal footing in their pursuit of the president\u2019s tax returns, but even here the effort amounts to responding to one violation of norms with another.\n\nTrump should have abided by custom and released his returns, as past presidents have done and as he said he would. But the law says Congress can demand to see them. The law is a bad one prone to abuse, but the Trump administration will still have to comply. But in listening to Democrats explain why they want the returns, you can see how corrupting the desire to get Trump has become.\n\nOn MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, Representative Bill Pascrell Jr. (D., N.J.) offered his reason for wanting the tax returns: to rub the truth in the faces of \u201cthe people who follow Mr. Trump, his base.\u201d Pascrell wants them to say, \u201cWe\u2019ve been had.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t wait for that to happen,\u201d he added.\n\nPascrell will be sorely disappointed by the capacity of Trump\u2019s base to absorb negative revelations about the president. But that\u2019s beside the point. The White House is wrong when it claims Congress must have a \u201clegislative purpose\u201d to see the returns. But democratic norms suggest that Congress shouldn\u2019t require confidential tax returns to be spilled out just for the purpose of saying \u201cnyah, nyah\u201d to voters or to prove that Democrats are just as willing to fight dirty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00a9 2019 Tribune Content Agency LLC", "description": "We all think the other side is cheating and that we need to play dirty because they started it.", "authors": ["Jonah Goldberg", "Andrew C.
