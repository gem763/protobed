including at midnight when they are lying in bed,\" says Ms Makings.\n\nAI is not the only tech being used to improve employee benefits provision, though.\n\nA new generation of hi-tech benefits providers also offering innovative add-on services designed to cater to individual employees' needs.\n\nFaith Howe, a director of talent at global communications agency FleishmanHillard, says: \"One of the biggest changes over the last few years has been the breadth of choice of technology available\".\n\nImage copyright CLOSEBROS Image caption Jeanette Makings says data can help employers make better decisions about benefits\n\nOne example is Wagestream, which allows employees to access their pay before pay day.\n\nPeter Briffett, chief executive at the UK-based company, says Wagestream uses technology \"to tackle the cashflow problems that come with being paid once a month\".\n\n\"We know that lots of employees face financial stress as a result of this, with many being pushed into taking out high-interest lending.\n\n\"Our tech, which calculates how much people can withdraw by looking at how many hours they have worked, aims to prevent this issue.\"\n\nIt comes with a charge: employers pay \u00a31 per employee per month and staff are charged a fixed fee of \u00a31.75 each time they make a withdrawal.\n\nAnother example is Open Blend, a management performance tool provider that counts French fashion brand Lacoste among its clients.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Sleep monitoring is a \"bit Big Brother\"\n\nIt uses Microsoft's Power BI business analytics tool to provide businesses with information about their employees' wellbeing needs.\n\n\"Attrition is a huge problem for businesses,\" says Anna Rasmussen, founder of Open Blend.\n\n\"Our research indicates that 84% of millennials look to leave their jobs within the first two years.\n\n\"So live data of the kind we can provide because our system is updated each time an employee has a session with his or her manager is very valuable as it shows companies what their employees need to stay motivated and reach their full potential, in real-time.\"\n\nEmployers can even go a step beyond analysing data by tracking employees' movements.\n\nThis is where wearable technology comes in.\n\nHealth and life insurance provider Vitality, for example, claims its Active Rewards Apple Watch scheme, which is available in 13 countries including Australia and Germany, \"helps more than a million members make the most of their health and wealth\".\n\nImage copyright OPENBLEND Image caption \"Attrition is a huge problem for businesses,\" says Anna Rasmussen, founder of Open Blend\n\nUsers of the scheme can earn \"rewards\" such as discounts on their insurance premiums by tracking their activity with an Apple Watch.\n\nAnd according to a study conducted by RAND Europe for Vitality last year, combining the two can really get people moving.\n\nThe study, which included more than 400,000 people in South Africa, the US, and the UK, found that participants using Vitality Active Rewards in conjunction with an Apple Watch to measure their performance did the equivalent of 4.8 extra days of activity per month.\n\nThat's an increase of 34%.\n\nThere are concerns about how employers could use wearable device data in the future, though.\n\n\"Personally I think monitoring how your staff sleep, for example, is a bit Big Brother,\" says Ms Rasmussen.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption \"Rewards\" such as discounts on insurance premiums are on offer for those who track their activity with an Apple Watch\n\nHuman resources experts also warn against relying solely on tech for your employee benefits provision.\n\n\"Apps, for example, can increase engagement if used in the right way,\" Ms Howe said.\n\n\"But if you don't have a collaborative culture, apps alone won't solve your problems of uptake and engagement.\n\n\"At this stage, I think we need greater understanding of the technology coming through, as well as more practical examples to help us understand what works and what doesn't.\"", "description": "Companies offer gym deals and cycle schemes -
