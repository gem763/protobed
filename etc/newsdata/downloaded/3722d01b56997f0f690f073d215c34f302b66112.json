The couple sustained severe bullet injuries during the shootout,\" Babul said, adding that they were later declared dead in a hospital.\n\nRights groups have previously accused Bangladesh police of staging gunfights as a cover for the extrajudicial killings of Rohingya, mainly suspects in drug smuggling.\n\nEarly this week, UN human rights experts called for an impartial investigation into Rohingya being killed in gunfights after being named as suspects in Faruk's killing.\n\nFollowing the Faruk murder, local residents vandalised refugee shops and staged protests in one of the camps. The settlements are home to nearly a million of the stateless minority who fled oppression in neighbouring Myanmar.\n\nAt least 33 Rohingya have been killed by Bangladeshi security forces in gunfights and another nine killed in internal gang clashes since July last year, according to the police.\n\nUN experts have also expressed \"serious concerns\" new restrictions and a virtual internet blackout in the camps.\n\nThe ongoing clampdown came after the failure of a fresh attempt to repatriate some of the refugees, the second effort in less than a year.", "description": "A Rohingya couple was shot dead during a gunfight in a border town camp hours after they were detained by Bangladesh police, officials said Sunday, the latest killings amid growing tensions between the refugees and authorities.
