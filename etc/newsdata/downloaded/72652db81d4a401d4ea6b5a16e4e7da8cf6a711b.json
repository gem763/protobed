We have to be pretty f****** stupid to let a trillion-dollar tech company pay nothing in taxes, am I right, Los Angeles?\"\n\nNicholas Thompson, the editor-in-chief of Wired, asked Yang, \"Is anyone having more fun running for president?\"\n\n\"I highly doubt it!\" he replied.\n\nFor a first-time politician, Yang is doing surprisingly well. Polls put him in single-digits, but in the last three months, Yang picked up $10 million in donations. That's less than half of what the front-runners took in, but it put him solidly in the middle of the pack.\n\nHis supporters are known as the Yang Gang. \"He's all about humanity first,\" said Hessa, explaining her support.\n\n\"He's not really a politician,\" said Devin Montez.\n\nOr, as Yang himself put it to the crowd, \"I'm barely a f****** politician.\"\n\nAndrew Yang is campaigning under the theme of MATH: \"Make America Think Harder.\" CBS News\n\nAndrew Yang, in fact, calls himself an entrepreneur. His parents immigrated from Taiwan: His father, a physicist, and his mother, with a master's in math and statistics. Yang grew up in Schenectady, New York. His first big success was running a college test-prep company, and then he founded Venture for America, a non-profit that helps train entrepreneurs in struggling cities.\n\nHe thinks jobs \u2013 or rather, the loss of them \u2013 are why Donald Trump won the presidency.\n\n\"The numbers tell a very clear story,\" he said. \"We automated away four million manufacturing jobs in Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Iowa, all the swing states that Donald Trump needed to win, and did win.\"\n\nAnd Yang believes robots and artificial intelligence will accelerate the loss of all kinds of jobs. \"Now, what we did to those jobs, we're doing to the retail jobs, the call center jobs, the fast food jobs, the truck driving jobs, and on and on through the economy,\" he said.\n\nThompson met Yang along the campaign trail, as he took a break for some tea (\"Duke of Earl Gray\"), and then discovered a foosball table, where he naturally talked about economic theory, and another of his big ideas: reforming how we calculate Gross Domestic Product, or GDP.\n\n\"If you want to see how out-of-whack GDP is, all you have to do is look at my family,\" Yang said. \"My wife is at home with our two boys, one of whom is autistic. And what is her work every day, included at in GDP? Zero. And we know that her work is among the most important work being done for our society.\"\n\nThompson asked, \"Isn't your work also valued at zero right now, running for president?\"\n\n\"It probably is!\"\n\nInstead of just measuring economic output, Yang-style GDP would include health and life expectancy, mental health, freedom from substance abuse, how children are doing, and how clean our air and water are.\n\nBut the centerpiece of the Yang campaign is what he calls the Freedom Dividend, historically called Universal Basic Income. As president, he would give $1,000 a month \u2013 $12,000 a year \u2013 to every American adult, rich or poor.\n\n\"Our economy functions much better when we have money to spend, where we can participate in the market, where businesses are responsive to us,\" he said. \"We'll start more businesses. We'll be able to change jobs more easily. So, the money doesn't disappear in our hands. It creates a trickle-up economy from our people, our families, and our communities up.\"\n\nWhen asked if a universal basic income is a good idea, Austan Goolsbee, who was chairman of President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisors, said, \"There's some parts of it that are an interesting idea. On a practical basis, you would kind of need to know, well, how would that work? That's a thing that's going to cost $2.4 trillion a year.\"\n\nThompson asked, \"How big a number is 2.4 trillion?\"\n\n\"Let's just put it into context: The entire income tax in the United States on everyone combined is, like, $1.5 trillion,\" Goolsbee replied.\n\nTo pay for it, Yang proposes a federal Value Added Tax, essentially a sales tax of 10 percent. (Though Goolsbee estimates it might have to be up to 30 percent.) Yang says his proposals will particularly hit big-tech.\n\n\"If we put a mechanism in place where we, the American people get our fair share, tiny slice of every Amazon sale, every Google search, every Facebook ad, every robot truck mile, we can generate hundreds of billions in new revenue and easily afford $1,000 dividend for every American adult,\" Yang said.\n\nYang has already started giving out Freedom Dividends. He's called 10 families with the good news \u2013 paid for at first out of his own pocket, and then by the campaign.\n\nThough it's all getting Yang a lot of attention, the odds against him becoming president seem overwhelming. But he's not lacking in confidence; Andrew Yang says he's done the math. He told the L.A. crowd, \"I am here with you tonight, one of only two candidates in the field that 10% or more of Donald Trump voters say they will support, which means that when I am the nominee, we win the whole thing!\"\n\nHe added, \"It's like a game of rock, paper, scissors. And if Donald Trump's the scissors, I'm the f*****g rock!\"\n\n\n\nFor more info:\n\n\n\nStory produced by Alan Golds.", "description": "The entrepreneur, first-time politician and sometimes off-color Democratic presidential candidate talks about his longshot campaign, universal basic income, and our nation's economic transformation", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/13/02ac4226-7f9c-4cdc-b096-dfff152eeda6/thumbnail/1200x630/da71433b45c2ab91de515cc1d7b4fdde/andrew-yang-interview-promo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
