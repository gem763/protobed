Fiat Chrysler Finance Europe said it was disappointed with the judgment and was considering its next steps, adding that the matter was not material to the group.\n\nMs Vestager said the court endorsed the Commission's approach in using state aid rules in tax cases, adding however that a more comprehensive strategy was needed to tackle tax avoidance.\n\n\"The ultimate goal that all companies pay their fair share of tax can only be achieved by a combination of efforts to make legislative changes, enforce state aid rules and a change in corporate philosophies,\" she said.\n\nThe Commission in its 2015 decisions said Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler set prices for goods and services sold between subsidiaries, known as transfer prices, that were below market rates and which artificially lowered their taxes.\n\nThe losing side can appeal to the Court of Justice of the European Union on points of law.\n\nLuxembourg, the Netherlands and Ireland are among countries whose economies have benefited from attracting multinationals. They have amended their tax regimes in recent years following the EU tax drive.\n\nThe European Commission is currently investigating Ikea AB and Nike Inc's Dutch deals and Huhtamaki Oyi's Luxembourg tax ruling.\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Banking & Finance - [LUXEMBOURG] Starbucks won its fight on Tuesday against an EU demand to pay up to 30 million euros (S$50 million) in Dutch back taxes, while Fiat Chrysler Automobiles lost its challenge against an order to stump up a similar amount to Luxembourg. .
