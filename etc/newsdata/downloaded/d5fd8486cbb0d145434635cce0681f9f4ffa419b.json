It manifests in a wilful ignoring of the basic rules of language. City Press editor in chief Mondli Makhanya\u2019s article \u201cLet\u2019s make the DA white again\u201d, demonstrates this vividly. Read: Mondli Makhanya: Let\u2019s make the DA white again In an opinion piece in the Daily Friend, I argued that Western Cape premier Alan Winde should replace Mmusi Maimane as leader of the DA. I argue that Maimane should resign, as the buck of the DA\u2019s political failures of the past two years stops with him. I make the incontrovertibly obvious point that South Africans are not the race-baiting Twitter trolls our politicians and journalists seem to think we are. South Africans, I seemingly controversially say, want political leaders to be elected on merit.\n\n\n\nI argue that Winde deserves proper consideration and elevation to DA leader on merit.\n\nAs finance MEC in the Western Cape from 2009 to last year, Winde oversaw the province\u2019s economy, with more than 500 000 jobs created.\n\nI make another point obvious to anyone familiar with the actualities of the recent election campaign: everywhere except in the Western Cape, the DA underperformed to a damaging extent.\n\nElectorally, the reality cannot be ignored \u2013 where Maimane was the banner carrier for the DA, the party\u2019s results disappointed; where Winde was the banner carrier, the DA overperformed.\n\nLast month, Winde released a three-minute video to set out how the Western Cape will be training more law enforcement personnel to win the fight against crime.\n\nLet\u2019s then put the case for Winde to be DA leader clearly: A job creator, a man with a plan to fight crime, and a politician who managed an electoral result to save his party from complete humiliation.\n\nThat Winde is not or was not being considered for the DA\u2019s leadership is extraordinary.\n\nNow comes the tricky bit.\n\nMakhanya accuses me of blatant racism, saying I make the case for Winde\u2019s election because he is a white man.\n\nBut he should have properly read what I wrote before launching into the tired and convenient invective of self-righteously screeching racism at anything mildly related to the issue.\n\nTo address any possible misunderstanding, here is the paragraph that contributed most to last week\u2019s outrage: \u201cA job creator. A crime fighter. These should be enough to get a politician to lead their party. However, Winde can be, for the DA, the game-changer they undoubtedly need. Why? Because he is a white man.\u201d\n\nIn any form of reasoned discussion, the most important word is probably \u2018because\u2019.\n\nIt connects position with argument and reason. Am I making the point that Winde should be leader of the DA \u201cbecause he is a white man\u201d?\n\nOnly deliberate or accidental illiteracy can bring one to read the two-sentence paragraph quoted above to conclude that I am.\n\nMakhanya seems unable to grasp the difference between electing a leader because he is white or electing the leader on merit who happens to be white.\n\nDue to the reality of the political landscape, only a fool would not consider the collective gasp of outrage from the adherents of identity politics were the DA to elect a white man as leader.\n\nWere the DA to discover some bottle and elect Winde as leader based on the strong meritorious case for doing so, it is either absurd, naive or disingenuous to think no mention will be made of the fact that he is a white man.\n\nAnd in that lies the opportunity for a DA under Winde\u2019s leadership to change the game of politics for good.\n\nMakhanya seems not to have bothered to read what I wrote. Instead, he waxes diabolical about points never made by myself or the SA Institute of Race Relations.\n\nWere the DA to elect a leader on merit who happens to be white, instead of continuing its pandering to those who adhere to the Verwoerdian notion that your race determines whether you can serve your country, the DA would be saying to all South Africans: \u201cOver and over, you\u2019ve told us that job creation and fighting crime should be our top priorities \u2013 and we have chosen a leader with exactly the experience needed to win those fights.\u201d\n\nIn saying that to voters, the DA would show itself to be the only party willing to take the real issues of suffering voters seriously \u2013 so seriously, in fact, that they would do what the powerful disciples of identity politics consider heresy against the church of Verwoerdian racial nationalism: appoint the best person for the job.\n\nThe DA would then expose for all to see the cabal of South African politicians and journalists willing to say to a man like Winde: \u201cWe don\u2019t care about your record on creating jobs or uplifting our people, and we don\u2019t care that you have executable, practical plans to fight the scourge of crime \u2013 you cannot serve the people of South Africa because of the colour of your skin.\u201d\n\nI stand by my advice to the DA. Get rid of the failed leadership. Listen to the people.\n\nYou need to take unemployment and crime seriously enough to elect your leadership based on merit.\n\nElect a leader who has shown a remarkable ability to win against these inherited demons of almost a century of government failure.\n\nPretorius is campaigns coordinator at the Institute of Race Relations", "description": "There is something rotten in the heart of South African politics and the media.
