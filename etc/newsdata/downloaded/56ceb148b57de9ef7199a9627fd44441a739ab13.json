It was a bit windy and bumpy, but it\u2019s like riding a bike \u2013 it all comes back to you when you\u2019re up there,\u201d Khokhani says.\n\nMoving to Australia at 16 from Mumbai to study for a diploma of airway operations at a college attached to Sydney\u2019s Bankstown Airport, Khokhani learnt to fly before he could drive.\n\nNeel Khokhani: \"The idea is to keep costs low rather than give a clip to someone else.\"\n\nHowever, in his nascent entrepreneurial mind he wondered why he was flying Cessnas and Pipers to get the 150 hours of flight time required for his commercial pilot\u2019s licence.\n\n\u201cThere would be me and the instructor, and as many as six empty seats,\u201d Khokhani recalls.\n\n\u201cI knew there were these great, smaller aircraft beginning to come out of Europe that were much cheaper and much more efficient.\u201d\n\nWhen Khokhani offered free advice on fleet management to the owner of the flying school where he worked as an instructor, it wasn\u2019t well received.", "description": "Soar Aviation founder Neel Khokhani doesn't get much time in the pilot's seat these days.
