We're not going to allow it to be used against our fellow Americans anymore.\"\n\nO'ROURKE'S 'HELL YES' DEBATE STAGE VOW\n\nNow, the former congressman from western Texas, whose star has waned on the presidential campaign trail, is trying to capitalize on the moment.\n\nO'Rourke's campaign quickly took to Twitter minutes later to fundraise off the debate moment. Showing the picture of an assault-style weapon, the campaign tweeted \"Beto has a ban for that.\"\n\nThe O\u2019Rourke campaign touted late Thursday night that the two hours of fundraising off of the breakout moment was their best so far in the third quarter of this year. But the campaign has yet to specifically say how much campaign cash they hauled in during those two hours.\n\nThe fundraising surge touted by the campaign comes an an opportune time - there are only two and a half weeks left in the third quarter of fundraising. O'Rourke raised just $3.6 million in the April-June second quarter, less than half of his first quarter haul. And his Q3 numbers will be highly scrutinized.\n\nSoon after, the campaign started selling \u201cHELL YES WE\u2019RE GOING TO TAKE YOUR AR-15\u201d shirts for $30 apiece. And they\u2019re also advertising \u201cBeto has a ban for that\u201d vinyl stickers for $5 each. That line is a twist on Elizabeth Warren\u2019s \u201cI have a plan for that\u201d motto.\n\nWarren\u2019s campaign has raised funds by selling that popular T-shirt. Meanwhile, Sen. Kamala Harris, too, has capitalized on the most talked-about moment in late June\u2019s first round of debates -- her heated exchange with former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nIn that showdown, the former attorney general slammed Biden\u2019s highlighting of his decades-ago opposition to federally mandated school busing, making the point personal by explaining she was a member of only the second class of black children in California to be bused to school in an effort to force desegregation.\n\n\u201cThat little girl was me,\u201d Harris said directly to the former vice president.\n\nHarris's campaign quickly tweeted out a photo of their candidate as a little girl with a note saying, \u201cThere was a little girl in California who was bussed to school. That little girl was me.\u201d Hours later they were selling tees \u2013 also for $30 per shirt \u2013 with the photo emblazed on the shirt.", "description": "Beto O'Rourke's campaign is trying to capitalize on his viral debate moment vowing to seize AR-15s and AK-47s.", "authors": ["Paul Steinhauser", "Paul Steinhauser Is A Politics Reporter Based In New Hampshire."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/13/694940094001_6085965589001_6085962963001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
