Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) on Sunday decried income inequality and the \u201ctop one percent\u201d just one day after endorsing a millionaire.\n\nOcasio-Cortez tweeted a Business Insider report, which found that an individual needs to make \u201cat least $500,000 a year\u201d in order to make the \u201ctop one percent\u201d in the United States.\n\n\u201cA lot of people think that folks like your typical lawyer or doctor are in \u2018the 1%.\u2019 That may be bc it\u2019s hard to conceive how bad runaway inequality has gotten,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez wrote.\n\n\u201cEven this number \u2013 $500k \u2013 reflects top income, & even THAT doesn\u2019t hold a candle to recognizing concentrated wealth,\u201d she added:\n\nA lot of people think that folks like your typical lawyer or doctor are in \u201cthe 1%.\u201d That may be bc it\u2019s hard to conceive how bad runaway inequality has gotten. Even this number \u2013 $500k \u2013 reflects top income, & even THAT doesn\u2019t hold a candle to recognizing concentrated wealth. https://t.co/1L4ITfryEk \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 20, 2019\n\nThe socialist lawmaker\u2019s public complaint regarding the reality of \u201cincome inequality\u201d comes just one day after she endorsed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) \u2013 a millionaire \u2013 for president.\n\nAccording to Forbes, Sanders has a $2.5 million fortune, which he acquired via \u201cestate, investments, government pensions\u2014and earnings from three books,\u201d many of which lament the very system that made his wealth possible. While his senator\u2019s salary is $174,000 per year, Forbes notes that the socialist lawmaker has made a \u201csix-figure annual salary since he joined Congress in 1991\u201d:\n\nWith 28 years in office and a current salary of $174,000, Sanders is entitled to around $73,000 a year from the federal government for the rest of his life. If he were to sell that guaranteed income stream for a lump-sum pile of cash, Forbes figures he could get around $650,000 for it.\n\nIn 2016, Sanders purchased a $575,000 lake house \u2013 dubbed a \u201csummer home\u201d \u2013 in the Champlain Islands, making the socialist the proud owner of not one, not two, but three homes.\n\nDespite Sanders\u2019 commitment to make the wealthy pay their \u201cfair share\u201d and eradicate the existence of billionaires, Sanders has been defensive of his own wealth accumulation.\n\n\u201cI wrote a best-selling book,\u201d he quipped during an interview with the New York Times this year. \u201cIf you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too.\u201d\n\nSupporters of Sanders \u2013 many of whom are part of the wealthy elite (such as Michael Moore, who has a net worth of roughly $50 million) \u2013 believe that the government should play a key role in \u201credistributing\u201d wealth.\n\nProponents of capitalism, however, believe that individuals in the private sector can create a better society and argue that self-interest benefits everyone, not just the \u201cone percent\u201d\u2013 a sentiment outlined by Founding Father Adam Smith in the Wealth of Nations.\n\nTax returns show that Sanders and his wife donated just 3.4 percent of their $566,000 income \u2013 or $19,000 \u2013 to charity in 2018.\n\nDespite that, Sanders has consistently slammed the wealthy for not paying their \u201cfair share.\u201d\n\nThe presidential hopeful unveiled a massive plan to redistribute wealth in the U.S. via an \u201cextreme wealth tax\u201d last month, which would impose a one percent tax on couples with a net worth over $32 million.\n\nAccording to the plan:\n\nThe tax rate would increase to 2 percent on net worth from $50 to $250 million, 3 percent from $250 to $500 million, 4 percent from $500 million to $1 billion, 5 percent from $1 to $2.5 billion, 6 percent from $2.5 to $5 billion, 7 percent from $5 to $10 billion, and 8 percent on wealth over $10 billion.\n\nThere should be no billionaires. We are going to tax their extreme wealth and invest in working people. Read the plan: https://t.co/RJDLvX5H4c \u2014 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) September 24, 2019\n\nSanders reiterated in April that the wealthy \u2013 including himself \u2013 needs to pay their fair share but argued that he already pays the taxes that he owes.\n\n\u201c[Y]our taxes do show that you\u2019re a millionaire. You did make a million in 2016 and 2017. You\u2019re right, the 561 [thousand] in 2018, but your marginal tax rate was 26% because of President Trump\u2019s tax cuts,\u201d Bret Baier said during a Fox News town hall with Sanders in April.\n\n\u201cSo, why not say, I\u2019m leading this revolution, I\u2019m not going to take those?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cCome on. We\u2019re nearing \u2014 I am \u2014 I pay the taxes that I owe, and by the way, why don\u2019t you get Donald Trump up here and ask him how much he pays in taxes?\u201d Sanders responded, failing to explain why he did not decline the tax cut and give more the IRS voluntarily.", "description": "Rep.
