They let us down'", "language": "en", "text": "The times might have been different but right and wrong doesn\u2019t change.\u201d And for Dave Merrington, the events of 30 years ago remain etched in his mind with the same clarity that characterised an instinct to not look the other way but to act.\n\nAs history has since proven across many areas of society, it was a tragically uncommon reaction.\n\nThe catalyst had been a minibus journey one evening in February 1989 with a group of Southampton apprentices. Merrington, who was managing the youth team, was driving home boys who had come through a schoolboy system Bob Higgins had turned into a personal kingdom.\n\n\u201cThey were talking \u2013 banter \u2013 but of a sexual nature and it disturbed me,\u201d he says. \u201cI said, \u2018You are talking about a member of staff here\u2019. It went quiet. I knew there was something wrong.\u201d\n\nMerrington went to first-team manager Chris Nicholl, who reported the matter to directors which included two solicitors. Nicholl also felt Higgins should be informed. \u201cI thought he would do it or the chairman,\u201d says Merrington, \u201cbut he said, \u2018I think it should be you, Dave\u2019. I arranged a meeting in the players\u2019 lounge. I said, \u2018Look, Bob, I\u2019m very disturbed with what I heard. Sexual allegations\u2019. He got very aggressive. Jumped up, made a move towards me. He started pointing and saying, \u2018I\u2019ll sue anybody who says anything about me\u2019. Within about a week he had resigned and gone.\u201d", "description": "The times might have been different but right and wrong doesn\u2019t change.", "authors": ["Jeremy Wilson", "Chief Sports Reporter", "Sam Wallace", "Jason Burt"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/13/TELEMMGLPICT000000992235-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqh5n3nnlFh0Ue32MbdKQyfnA3x1dbh0MnngrX3S4DySQ.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
