No mild praise of Trump will be allowed. Apatow slammed Silver, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not about permitting Trump to have a good day. When he announced it, he acted like such a sniveling lunatic that it reminds us all that we are in danger with him leading our country. It does not feel like he has decreased the danger. He is unhinged and corrupt.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not about permitting Trump to have a good day.

He wants more personal praise and attention, so he will make the killing of a terrorist a reality tv show. It\u2019s straight out of Network,\u201d Apatow said.\n\nDo you understand @NateSilver538?

Halloween star Jamie Lee Curtis, for instance, attacked Trump instead of celebrating the end of terrorist al-Baghdadi.\n\nCurtis was only one of Hollywood\u2019s denizens who went on the attack against Trump over the death of Baghdadi. Others including actor Jeffry Wright, director Rob Reiner, and Bette Midler also went on the attack.\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @WTHuston.", "description": "Hollywood director and producer Judd Apatow joined the loud Hollywood leftists attacking\u00a0President Donald Trump\u00a0and trying to undermine news of the death of one of the world's worst terrorists, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/apatowrealityshow1-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
