The phenomenally popular Brain Age games for Nintendo DS starred Japanese neuroscientist Dr. Ryuta Kawashima and featured various simple puzzles designed to help keep your brain active. Also sudoku.\n\nThe latest entry has only been confirmed in Japan so far, where it\u2019s called \u201cTrain Your Brain: Nintendo Switch Training for Adults,\u201d which is the same title as the original DS game only with the platform swapped out. The original DS game was called Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day! in the US and Dr. Kawashima\u2019s Brain Training: How Old Is Your Brain? in PAL regions.\n\nThis won\u2019t work so well with the Switch Lite\n\nBased on Nintendo\u2019s trailer, the new game will lean hard on the Switch\u2019s unique functionality. For example, one game sees you use the right Joy-Con\u2019s IR camera to scan your hand so that you can deliberately lose a game of rock-paper-scissors. Others focus on local competitive play with detached controllers.\n\nMuch of the rest of the game appears to be designed to be played with the Switch in vertical orientation alongside an included stylus. You can also set the game to send notifications and reminders to your system when docked, buzzing the controller and flashing the home button\u2019s LED (which, as far as I know, has never been used before). This doesn\u2019t look like a game that\u2019ll work well with the new Switch Lite.\n\nTrain Your Brain: Nintendo Switch Training for Adults will be released in Japan on December 27th, costing 3,480 yen for a physical version with the included stylus or 2,680 yen for the downloadable version.", "description": "Nintendo has announced a new Brain Age game, bringing the brain-training series to the Switch for the first time.
