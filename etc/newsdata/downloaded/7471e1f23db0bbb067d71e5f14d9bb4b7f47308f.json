Steve Bland went to the store, officers Austin Neumann and William Daniels kept the children entertained, police said.\n\nThe kids were crying and scared, so \"I kind of leaned down next to a little boy. He just turned right to me and wanted to be picked up,\" said Neumann, who's seen in this photo first posted to Facebook by his wife.\n\nSavannah Police Department\n\n\"And that was it -- we were just best friends after that,\" Neumann said. \"He didn't want to be let down.\"\n\n\"The boys just really really took a liking to the officers, so much so that when the interaction was over ... the boys just did not want to let go,\" Savannah police spokeswoman Bianca Johnson told ABC News.\n\nNeumann said it's important for the public to know that police aren't looking to \"harass\" or arrest drivers -- officers are there to help keep communities safe.\n\nSavannah Police Department\n\n\"She was very thankful,\" he said of the young mom.\n\n\"They go above and beyond for kids all the time,\" officer Neumann's wife, Kelsey Neumann, said of her husband and his colleagues. \"I didn't expect anything less from them.\"\n\n\"You could tell that that not only touched the hearts of the officers and the boys, but the mother,\" Johnson said. \"With the way some attitudes are toward police, those interactions are really priceless.\"\n\nAfter the officers installed the car seats, \"the mother drove away with a completely different outlook on police,\" the department said on Facebook.\n\nAnd Kelsey Neumann called her husband's actions good practice -- the Neumanns' first child, a daughter, is due in January.", "description": "The young mom had 1-year-old twins who weren't in proper car seats.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/savannah-1-ht-er-190923_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
