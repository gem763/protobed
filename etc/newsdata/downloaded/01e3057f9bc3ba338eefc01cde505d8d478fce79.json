And you know what she said?\n\n\"Babe, switch cities.\"\n\nAnd I was like how weird, what kind of a suggestion is that? But I looked it up online and to my surprise, I found over 1,50,000 search hits that suggested the following:\n\n'10 cities to move to if you want to find love', 'Best cities for single people to date', 'Best cities for single women' and so on.\n\nHere's my rebuttal: the best city for single people to find love is exactly where they are. Below, you'll know why!\n\nPexels\n\nFirst, no single person ever asked for such a bizarre suggestion. I would love to believe that whichever city we are in, it was our choice. Except for those who were born in one city and lived their entire lives there. Since, it's our choice to stay in one place all our life or move away, the choice might be because of employment opportunities, an undergraduate or master's degree or proximity to family and friends. Nobody moves to a new city to find love. Because that doesn't make sense.\n\nSecond, if I am not living in a city that supposedly, doesn't have a thriving dating scene, am I supposed to just pack up and leave? Instead of building on our goals and creating a life that we will be proud of, we should keep moving from one city to another in order to search for 'love'?\n\nPexels\n\nThird, what if I am already living in a city that has been listed as the best city for singles, and I am still single? What if I hate the dating scene in that city? But then, people will make us feel as if we are not worthy of love or nice enough to keep someone interested. So now, it isn't a city issue but a 'me' issue.\n\nFinally, anyone who has been in love, knows love doesn't work this way.\n\nPexels\n\nDon't let anyone convince you that you must shift cities in order to find love. Love isn't limited to a metropolitan area. It can't be contained in geographical pin. Love can't also be owned by someone who has the finances and the freedom to relocate. We all have in us the ability to find love. Wherever we are, we must keep an open heart. And most importantly, we are certainly worthy of love wherever we are, with whoever and in any pin code.", "description": "Don't let anyone convince you that you must shift cities in order to find love.
