Unlike data breaches in other industries, where hackers make use of flaws in a company\u2019s security practices, many digital medical records systems don\u2019t even require passwords. What that means is you don\u2019t even need fancy hacker software to peep at millions of medical test results. All you need is to know where to look, and an internet browser.\n\nIn its investigation, ProPublica worked with German security firm Greenbone Networks, and journalists from German broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk. It ultimately identified 187 servers in the U.S. that lacked passwords or basic security precautions.\n\nIn total, the data from more than 16 million medical scans worldwide are available online. What\u2019s worse is that on top of private medical images, the scans include sensitive information such as names, birthdates and in some cases, Social Security numbers.\n\nOne issue is it\u2019s unclear who exactly is at fault, and many of the parties involved seem to think securing data is someone else\u2019s responsibility. The U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was enacted in 1996 to \u201cassure that individuals\u2019 health information is properly protected while allowing the flow of health information needed to provide and promote high quality health care.\u201d Among its provisions is a requirement that standards be publicised for the \u201celectronic exchange, privacy and security of health information.\u201d\n\nThat would appear to put the onus on health care providers and the services they use. However, the report found companies creating medical imaging software and medical device makers assumed their customers \u2014 health providers \u2014 would be in charge of securing data.\n\nAt the same time, while large hospital chains and academic medical centres did, in fact, implement security standards, ProPublica discovered this was not the case for many independent radiologists, medical imaging centres, or archiving services. It contacted the Medical Imaging & Technology Alliance, a group which oversees the DICOM communication standard used by medical imaging devices, but the group pointed the finger at those in charge of maintaining servers where data is stored.\n\nLikewise, the report found the government doesn\u2019t do a great job in punishing companies for patient privacy breaches, citing that in April, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services lowered the maximum fine from $US1.5 ($2) million to $US250,000 ($364,093) for \u201ccorrected wilful neglect.\u201d\n\nSome of the health care providers ProPublica reached out to have since beefed up their security. Thankfully, the report found no instances of malicious actors accessing these vulnerable medical images and publishing them elsewhere. That said, the potential for abuse is terrifying. Usually, data breaches deal with identifying information such as emails, passwords and phone numbers.\n\nThat\u2019s terrible, but leaked medical data also has the potential of publicising the private details of a person\u2019s health. Such information could be easily used to embarrass, blackmail, or encourage discrimination. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t even the first reported instance of widespread carelessness with regard to medical records.\n\nIn April, the medical files of 145,000 rehab patients were leaked online, unnecessarily putting people who sought help at risk of social stigma. Likewise, in 2017, tens of thousands of medical records belonging to patients at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Centre in New York were stored on insecure servers run by a third-party IT service.\n\nAt the moment there\u2019s not much an individual can do, as fixing the problem requires a concerted effort from American medical manufacturers, providers, the U.S. government, and standards makers.\n\n[ProPublica]", "description": "It turns out that anyone with basic computing skills and an internet connection can access millions of private medical images and data from Americans \u2014 such as MRIs, X-rays and CT scans \u2014 as well as a buffet of valuable private info, according to a disturbing report from ProPublica....", "authors": ["Sarah Basford", "Mack Hogan"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/yropf1yaj8e1kla7yfyd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
