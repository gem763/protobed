Starring: Jessica Chastain, James McAvoy, Bill Hader, Isaiah Mustafa, Jay Ryan, James Ransone, and Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd. 15 cert, 169 mins\n\nIt: Chapter Two is what happens when you put off the inevitable. There was a simplicity to its 2017 predecessor that worked beautifully: it was a tale of innocence lost, told through the battle between seven outcast kids and one murderous clown. Yet Andy Muschietti\u2019s first adaptation barely scraped the surface of Stephen King\u2019s brick-sized novel. Its follow-up has been left to pick up all the pieces \u2013 each part of the story that felt too messy or complicated to include before, but can now no longer be ignored. While the director does his very best with the material, there\u2019s no escaping how egregiously bloated this film feels.\n\nWhile King flips between two time periods, the films have separated them entirely. 2017\u2019s It dealt exclusively with the Losers Club\u2019s first encounter with Pennywise (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd) in 1988. Post-victory, the group swore a blood oath \u2013 a promise that they\u2019d return to their hometown of Derry if the great evil ever reared its head again. Twenty-seven years later, those fears come true. Mike (Isaiah Mustafa), the only one to have stayed behind, is tasked with organising this baleful reunion. Bill (James McAvoy) is now a successful mystery novelist, while Richie (Bill Hader) has made it as a stand-up comic. Eddie (James Ransone) has, in a purely Freudian sense, married his own mother (both wife and matriarch are played by Molly Atkinson). The formerly overweight Ben (Jay Ryan) is now a wealthy architect with washboard abs. Beverly (Jessica Chastain), meanwhile, remains trapped in a cycle of abuse. What was once her father\u2019s reign of terror is now her husband\u2019s.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nOn top of that, however, the film has to deal with King\u2019s habit of narrative excess. Even two films could never cover all the subplots, random thoughts, and bits of lore contained in the book\u2019s 1,138 pages. It\u2019s always been the price we\u2019ve had to pay for his wild imagination \u2013 he just can\u2019t keep a story on track. On the bright side, the filmmakers don\u2019t bother with Pennywise\u2019s mortal enemy, the very big turtle, but the film\u2019s faithful enough to have inherited a lot of the novel\u2019s core issues. Take, for example, the vaguely gross way everyone obsesses over Ben\u2019s weight loss, and how that suddenly makes him a now-eligible contender for Beverly\u2019s affections. There\u2019s the return of Henry Bowers (Teach Grant), the school bully, too, and a lot of hackneyed backstory about Native American rituals. Most glaringly, the film fails to rectify how blatantly underwritten Mike, the story\u2019s one non-white character, is. To Muschietti\u2019s credit, he does deal sensitively with the book\u2019s real-world violence, encompassing hate crimes, sexual abuse, and suicide. Although King links them directly to Pennywise\u2019s machinations, the film allows these scenes to stand independently as very human tragedies.\n\nMuschietti, alongside screenwriter Gary Dauberman, has at least done well to excavate the heart of King\u2019s story. Put aside the clown antics and you\u2019ll find a mournful observance of time\u2019s effect on memory. \u201cWe are what we wish we could forget,\u201d the opening narration posits. The more painful the memory, the bigger the scar it leaves. And if we don\u2019t hold on to good experiences, they\u2019ll soon fade out of existence. Those who have left Derry may not remember that fateful summer of 1988, but they\u2019re still changed by their experiences. The second they return, it all starts to come flooding back.\n\nIt: Chapter Two exists in direct communication with what came before, as the adult Losers Club turn back time and relive their greatest traumas. Thematically, it\u2019s a considered interrogation of the kind of hazy nostalgia that made the first film such a hit. In practical terms, it creates an overlong, repetitive narrative. It\u2019s been two years since we\u2019ve seen these characters, so there\u2019s an explanatory flashback every time an element is reintroduced. We\u2019re revisiting the same locations, ideas, and even scares. The adult cast do an impressive job of mimicking their younger counterparts, maintaining the same sense of easy camaraderie. Although it\u2019s interesting to see Chastain, a champion of headstrong characters, play it so subdued here, it\u2019s hard not to feel like these performances exist as an echo of something that came before.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 37 horror films that are genuinely scary Show all 37 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 37 horror films that are genuinely scary 1/37 Funny Games (1997) Directed by: Michael Haneke : Michael Haneke Funny Games places the horror in the familiar setting of home. It follows two young men who hold a family hostage and torture them with sadistic games. The result is far scarier than anything featuring ghosts, witches or demons. Concorde-Castle Rock/Turner 2/37 The Amityville Horror (1979) Directed by: Stuart Rosenberg : Stuart Rosenberg The Amityville Horror is based on the true story of the Lutzes, a family who were run out of their home after being terrorised by paranormal phenomena in 1975. Just one year before, Ronald DeFeo Jr shot and killed six members of his family in the same house. James Brolin and Margot Kidder lead this film, which became one of the biggest hits of 1979. American International Pictures 3/37 Audition (1999) Directed by: Takashi Miike : Takashi Miike Japanese horror Audition (1999) follows a widower who meets a woman named Ayoma after staging auditions to meet a potential new partner. Soon, though, her dark past begins to surface, which equates to a pretty disturbing climax. Omega Project 4/37 The Blair Witch Project (1999) Directed by: Daniel Myrick, Eduardo S\u00e1nchez : Daniel Myrick, Eduardo S\u00e1nchez Although parodied to death, The Blair Witch Project popularised the found-footage format to terrifying degrees in 1999. People genuinely believed they were watching real clips of three student filmmakers being terrorised by a Maryland legend known as the Blair Witch. Artisan Entertainment 5/37 The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920) Directed by: Robert Wiene : Robert Wiene Black-and-white silent horror film The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920) is considered the quintessential work of German Expressionism, but also one of the scariest films in cinema history. It follows a hypnotist (Werner Krauss) who uses a somnambulist to commit murders, and Wiene's shadowed sets and striking visual style combines to unsettle the viewer in ways most filmmakers only dream of managing. Decla-Bioscop 6/37 Candyman (1992) Directed by: Bernard Rose : Bernard Rose A contemporary classic of horror cinema, 1992 film Candyman \u2013 which spawned two sequels and has a Jordan Peele-produced remake in the works \u2013 follows a graduate student whose studies lead her to the legend of a ghost who appears when you say his name three times. TriStar Pictures 7/37 Cannibal Holocaust (1980) Directed by: Ruggero Deodato : Ruggero Deodato Extreme enough to warrant a ban in Italy and Australia, Cannibal Holocaust (1980) was one of the first films to embrace the found-footage format \u2013 so much so that Deodato found himself charged with multiple counts of murder due to rumours that several of the film's death scenes were real. He was later cleared. United Artists Europa 8/37 The Descent (2005) Directed by: Neil Marshall : Neil Marshall Released in 2005, The Descent follows six women who, upon exploring a cave, battle to survive against the creatures they find inside. It's these creatures that earn this British horror film's placement on this list. Path\u00e9 Distribution 9/37 The Exorcist (1973) Directed by: William Friedkin : William Friedkin One of the most controversial films of all time, The Exorcist \u2013 which tells the story of the demonic possession of a 12-year-old girl named Regan (Linda Blair) \u2013 became the first horror to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars in 1974. Warner Bros 10/37 Halloween (1978) Directed by: John Carpenter : John Carpenter Sure, it may be dated, but John Carpenter's original Halloween film \u2013 released in 1978 \u2013 remains the daddy of all horrors. It re-defined the rule book and has been emulated in everything from Scream (1996) to Trick 'r Treat (2007). The tension, as babysitter Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) attempts to evade masked murderer Michael Myers, only heightens with every new watch. Compass International Pictures[ 11/37 Hereditary (2018) Directed by: Ari Aster : Ari Aster Proving that horror is a force to be reckoned with, Hereditary became independent distributor A24's highest-grossing film around the world upon its release in 2018. It tells the story of a family who find themselves haunted after the death of their secretive grandmother and features a final act that left many of its viewers with sleepless nights. A24 12/37 The House of the Devil (2009) Directed by: Ti West : Ti West The House of the Devil (2009) follows a student named Samantha who is hired to guard an isolated house with one rule: don't go upstairs. For most of the film's runtime, not much happens, which is what makes the action-packed final third so terrifying. Spoiler: she goes upstairs. MPI Media Group 13/37 The Innocents (1961) Directed by: Jack Clayton : Jack Clayton Based upon Henry James' chiller The Turn of the Screw, the plot of 1961 psychological horror film The Innocents concerns a governess who watches over two children and comes to fear that their large estate is haunted by ghosts and that the youngsters are being possessed. 20th Century Fox 14/37 It (1986) Directed by: Tommy Lee Wallace : Tommy Lee Wallace Forget the effects-laden remake \u2013 this version of It, released as a miniseries in 1986, is the most terrifying adaptation of Stephen King's beloved novel to date. It follows a shapeshifting demon who takes the form of a sadistic child-killing clown named Pennywise (Tim Curry). Lorimar Productions 15/37 Ju-On: The Grudge (2002) Directed by: Takashi Shimizu : Takashi Shimizu Japanese horror maestro Takashi Shimizu \u2013 who also directed the pretty scary 2005 remake starring Sarah Michelle Gellar \u2013 balances mystery with horror in Ju-On: The Grudge, a story based in a cursed house in Tokyo. Lions Gate Films 16/37 Kill List (2011) Directed by: Ben Wheatley : Ben Wheatley To describe the horrors of Kill List is to ruin the film's surprises, but let's just say this: the final 20 minutes of Ben Wheatley's violent drama from 2011 features some of the most unsettling scenes in any film from this decade. Optimum Releasing 17/37 Lake Mungo (2008) Directed by: Joel Anderson : Joel Anderson Taking the form of a mockumentary, the little-seen Australian drama Lake Mungo may have received a limited release in 2008, but its story of a family attempting to come to terms with the drowning of their daughter stays with viewers long after. Arclight Films 18/37 Martyrs (2008) Directed by: Pascal Laugier : Pascal Laugier The polarising 2008 film Martyrs, often associated with the New French Extremity movement, is the kind of horror that leaves you needing a shower once the credits roll. It follows a young woman's quest for revenge on the people who kidnapped and tormented her as a child. Anchor Bay Films 19/37 Night of the Living Dead (1968) Directed by: George A Romero : George A Romero Younger viewers may be desensitised by the more extreme horror films to have been released in recent decades, but the scares featured in Romero's Night of the Living Dead \u2013 including the young girl zombie reveal \u2013 remain some of the most chilling committed to celluloid. Continental Distributing 20/37 Nosferatu (1922) Directed by: FW Murnau : FW Murnau Alongside Cesare in The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920), the character of vampire Count Orlok in 1922 film Nosferatu \u2013 played by Mac Schreck \u2013 remains one of the most spine-tingling in cinema history. Film Arts Guild 21/37 The Orphanage (2007) Directed by: JA Bayona : JA Bayona Produced by Guillermo del Toro, this acclaimed 2007 chiller follows the disappearance of a young boy in an orphanage, which brings many of the building's terrifying secrets to the fore. Warner Bros Pictures de Espa\u00f1a 22/37 The Others (2001) Directed by: Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar : Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar The Others (2001) is a towering achievement for Spanish filmmaker Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar who wrote, directed and scored this Nicole Kidman-fronted tale about a woman trying to protect her children from supernatural forces. It's perhaps the scariest 12-certificate film of all time. Warner Sogefilms 23/37 Paranormal Activity (2009) Directed by: Oren Peli : Oren Peli Could Paranormal Activity be the scariest film of all time? It's certainly one of them. Just when you thought found-footage had had its day, Oren Peli's small-budgeted festival favourite became one of 2009's biggest hits. Audiences lapped up the story of a couple who capture supernatural presences on a camera in their own home. Paramount Pictures[ 24/37 Paranormal Activity 3 (2011) Directed by: Henry Joost, Ariel Schulman : Henry Joost, Ariel Schulman Paranormal Activity 3 earns its place on this list for its final 10 minutes.

Paramount Pictures 25/37 [REC] (2007) Directed by: Jaume Balaguer\u00f3, Paco Plaza : Jaume Balaguer\u00f3, Paco Plaza Played out in real-time, the claustrophobic Spanish horror film [REC] is one of the better examples of found-footage cinema. Released in 2007, it follows a reporter and her cameraman who follow firefighters to a Barcelona building and soon find themselves locked inside with its occupants who are displaying murderous behaviour. Filmax International 26/37 Ring (1998) Directed by: Hideo Nakata : Hideo Nakata Unless you've been living under a rock, you know the story of Ring by now: viewers of a cursed videotape die seven days after watching it. While the inevitable Hollywood remake in 2002 was better than it had any right to be, Nakata's original is as terrifying as horror films come. Toho 27/37 Rosemary's Baby (1968) Directed by: Roman Polanski : Roman Polanski Released in 1968, Rosemary's Baby follows a pregnant woman who suspects that an evil cult want to take her baby for use in their rituals. Mia Farrow, John Cassavetes and Ruth Gordon's performances tip this psychological chiller into classic status. Paramount Pictures 28/37 The Shining (1980) Directed by: Stanley Kubrick : Stanley Kubrick Forget the iconic \"Heeeeere's Johnny\" or that bath scene \u2013 it's the smaller moments that make Kubrick's 1980 adaptation of Stephen King's The Shining a terrifying watch, notably the trippy final act that sees Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson) lose his mind to the Overlook Hotel. Warner Bros 29/37 Sinister (2012) Directed by: Scott Derrickson : Scott Derrickson Of all the Blumhouse horror films, 2012 release Sinister \u2013 which features the demonic character Bughuul \u2013 is the spookiest of them all. It stars Ethan Hawke as a true-crime writer who discovers a box of home movies depicting grisly murders in the attic of his new house. Momentum Pictures 30/37 Sleep Tight (2011) Directed by: Jaume Balaguer\u00f3 : Jaume Balaguer\u00f3 This little-seen Spanish horror follows a concierge who, believing he was born without the ability to feel happiness, decides to make life hell for everyone around him. Filmax 31/37 The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) Directed by: Tobe Hooper : Tobe Hooper The fictional Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), marketed as a true story, follows a group of cannibals \u2013 including Leatherface \u2013 who relentlessly hunt down a group of friends. Vortex 32/37 28 Days Later (2002) Directed by: Danny Boyle : Danny Boyle Many might not reflect upon 28 Days Later (2002) as one of the world's scariest horror films, but its desolate depiction of a viral outbreak seems more real than any other. When merged with the fast-paced infected and the usage of John Murphy's song \"In the House \u2013 In A Heartbeat\", it's hard to deny it such status. Fox Searchlight Pictures 33/37 V/H/S (2012) Directed by: Various : Various Directed by six filmmakers, including Adam Wingard and Ti West, 2012 anthology film V/H/S is grimy horror of the tallest order. Look no further than David Bruckner's section \"Amateur Night\" following three friends who meet a mysterious girl who says nothing other than three small words: \"I like you.\" Magnet Releasing 34/37 The Wailing (2016) Directed by: Na Hong-jin : Na Hong-jin Twist-filled horror drama The Wailing follows a policeman who investigates a series of mysterious killings and illness in the mountains of South Korea. If the journey fails to scare you, its destination will leave you lying awake at night. 20th Century Fox Korea 35/37 The Wicker Man (1973) Directed by: Robin Hardy : Robin Hardy The Wicker Man is deemed the best British horror film of all time for a reason. It tells the story of a Police Sergeant who travels to an isolated island in search of a missing girl, only to find its inhabitants practising a form of Celtic paganism. British Lion Films 36/37 The Witch (2015) Directed by: Robert Eggers : Robert Eggers For the most part, it's not what you see in The Witch that terrifies, it's what you don't see. Eggers unsettlingly holds his camera a fraction too long in places as he retells the story of a Separatist family who encounter supernatural forces in the woods beyond their farm. A24 37/37 Zero Day (2003) Directed by: Ben Coccio : Ben Coccio The horrors are all too real in Zero Day, a film inspired by the Columbine High School massacre in 1999.

Vortex 32/37 28 Days Later (2002) Directed by: Danny Boyle : Danny Boyle Many might not reflect upon 28 Days Later (2002) as one of the world's scariest horror films, but its desolate depiction of a viral outbreak seems more real than any other. When merged with the fast-paced infected and the usage of John Murphy's song \"In the House \u2013 In A Heartbeat\", it's hard to deny it such status. Fox Searchlight Pictures 33/37 V/H/S (2012) Directed by: Various : Various Directed by six filmmakers, including Adam Wingard and Ti West, 2012 anthology film V/H/S is grimy horror of the tallest order. Look no further than David Bruckner's section \"Amateur Night\" following three friends who meet a mysterious girl who says nothing other than three small words: \"I like you.\" Magnet Releasing 34/37 The Wailing (2016) Directed by: Na Hong-jin : Na Hong-jin Twist-filled horror drama The Wailing follows a policeman who investigates a series of mysterious killings and illness in the mountains of South Korea. If the journey fails to scare you, its destination will leave you lying awake at night. 20th Century Fox Korea 35/37 The Wicker Man (1973) Directed by: Robin Hardy : Robin Hardy The Wicker Man is deemed the best British horror film of all time for a reason. It tells the story of a Police Sergeant who travels to an isolated island in search of a missing girl, only to find its inhabitants practising a form of Celtic paganism. British Lion Films 36/37 The Witch (2015) Directed by: Robert Eggers : Robert Eggers For the most part, it's not what you see in The Witch that terrifies, it's what you don't see. Eggers unsettlingly holds his camera a fraction too long in places as he retells the story of a Separatist family who encounter supernatural forces in the woods beyond their farm. A24 37/37 Zero Day (2003) Directed by: Ben Coccio : Ben Coccio The horrors are all too real in Zero Day, a film inspired by the Columbine High School massacre in 1999. The majority of the film is portrayed through the video diaries of two students who are planning to attack their high school. Avatar Films\n\nThe film\u2019s highlights are, admittedly, the moments that deviate entirely from the book. Here, Muschietti works in the same vein as his debut Mama, concocting truly phantasmagorical creations that owe much more to the world of traditional folk tales and legends than they do to the pages of King\u2019s novels. There\u2019s some truly scary, nightmare material in here. However, It: Chapter Two is also a lot funnier than you\u2019d expect. Hader pitches his performance in the perfect place between self-awareness and sincerity, especially when he nails the line: \u201cLet\u2019s go kill this f***ing clown\u201d. Skarsg\u00e5rd is on top form once more, but he\u2019s smart to realise that his Pennywise is too much of a pop culture icon now to be truly terrifying. He\u2019s a more rounded character here \u2013 a sad, embittered bully.\n\nAbove all, It: Chapter Two is horror created in the blockbuster mould. For all its terrors, the film is equally concerned with its A-list stars, its venerable literary origins, its need to provide light entertainment, and its CGI-laden climactic showdown. That would explain why the film is nearly three hours long \u2013 it\u2019s one to put side-to-side with the action films and superhero franchises, as opposed to the usual, more humble mid-budget horror fare we\u2019re used to. It\u2019s an admirable attempt, and there\u2019s a lot of artistry on show here, but there\u2019s no escaping how truly unwieldy the final product is.\n\nIt: Chapter Two is released in UK cinemas on 6 September", "description": "Dir: Andy Muschietti.
