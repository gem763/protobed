It adds, \u201cThe prohibition on criminally prosecuting a sitting President cannot be circumvented by limiting the investigation to a grand-jury subpoena, or by not subpoenaing the President directly.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for Mazars said the firm would comply with its legal obligations. A spokesman for Mr. Vance said the office had received the complaint and would respond in court.\n\nMarc Mukasey, a lawyer for Mr. Trump, said in a statement, \u201cWe are in court to protect the president\u2019s rights and the Constitution.\u201d\n\nOn Aug. 1, the district attorney issued a grand-jury subpoena to the Trump Organization for documents relating to payments for or agreements about former Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal and Ms. Daniels.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawyers began producing those documents, the complaint says.\n\nOn Aug. 29, a second grand-jury subpoena, sent to Mazars, requested tax returns and other financial documents dating to 2011. That subpoena required Mazars to produce the documents by 2 p.m. on Sept. 19, although the district attorney offered a brief extension, according to the complaint.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s lawyers are asking a judge to rule the subpoena is invalid while the president is in office.\n\nJustice Department policy bars the indictment of a sitting president. But the question of whether a president can be subject to a criminal process, including the tax-return requests, is unsettled, said Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School and former Manhattan prosecutor.\n\nTo successfully fight the subpoenas, she said, Mr. Trump\u2019s lawyers will likely have to convince a court that the investigation impedes his presidency. \u201cTo succeed on that there is going to have to be some novel interpretation of the law,\u201d said Ms. Roiphe.\n\nWhile typically courts prefer not to intervene in debates over subpoenas, it is possible that this or a similar legal challenge could be heard by the Supreme Court, she said.\n\nThroughout his administration, Mr. Trump has aggressively fought investigators\u2019 efforts to obtain his tax returns. In April, the Trump Organization sued the Democratic chairman of the House Oversight Committee and Mazars in an attempt to block a subpoena from the committee to the accounting firm for tax returns.\n\nLater that month, Mr. Trump and his three oldest children sued Deutsche Bank AG and Capital One Financial Corp. after the House Intelligence and Financial Services committees subpoenaed financial records of Mr. Trump, his children and his businesses from the banks.\n\nIn August, Deutsche Bank told a federal appeals court it has copies of tax returns sought under that subpoena. Capital One told the court it didn\u2019t have the tax returns requested by the subpoena.\n\nThe appeals court hasn\u2019t issued its ruling.\n\nNew York state prosecutors\u2019 probe comes on the heels of a federal investigation into hush-money payments arranged by Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, that concluded this summer. Mr. Cohen pleaded guilty to charges including violating campaign-finance laws by arranging the hush payments, which he said\u2014and federal prosecutors later affirmed\u2014that the president directed him to make. Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing. Mr. Cohen began a three-year prison sentence in May.\n\nInvestigators from the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office interviewed Mr. Cohen last month at the federal prison in upstate New York where he is serving his sentence, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\n\u2014Rebecca Ballhaus contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Corinne Ramey at Corinne.Ramey@wsj.com", "description": "President Trump filed a lawsuit to block New York prosecutors\u2019 subpoena for his tax returns, the latest salvo in a continuing battle over the disclosure of the president\u2019s financial information.", "authors": ["Corinne Ramey", "Corinne.Ramey Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-108699/social", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
