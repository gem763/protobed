The announcement came about two years after the company first disclosed its plans to jump into car manufacturing.\n\nDyson represents one of the most high-profile players to pull out of a sector that\u2019s attracted hundreds of start-ups in recent years seeking to become the next Tesla (NASDAQ: ) Inc. But there are mounting signs that the bubble is bursting as China scales back handouts in the sector and competition heats up. Sanford C. Bernstein estimates that global EV sales fell for the first time ever in July and dropped by a record 23% in August.\n\n\u201cTesla\u2019s future remains uncertain. Almost all the EV start-ups trying to follow look challenged,\u201d Bernstein analysts, including Max Warburton and Robin Zhu, said in a report that cited the Dyson decision as a worrisome development in the industry. \u201cMost of these start-ups will likely fold. The truth is barriers to entry in autos remain high. Making cars is hard. The move to EVs will be expensive.\u201d\n\nTake the case of China\u2019s NIO Inc., one of the most prominent electric-car makers in a country that makes about half of the world\u2019s EVs. Last month it reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss, leading the stock to tumble to a record low and prompting analysts to openly question the company\u2019s viability. The shares jumped on Tuesday after NIO reported third-quarter deliveries exceeded the company\u2019s forecast, but the stock has since erased all those gains.\n\nElsewhere in China, Lifan Industry Group Co. and Zotye Automobile Co. have had to issue statements denying speculation that they\u2019re planning to file for bankruptcy, though the former conceded it\u2019s under liquidity pressure.\n\nThe competition is also getting tougher. Besides Tesla (NASDAQ: ), traditional automakers such as General Motors Co (NYSE: ). and Volkswagen (DE: ) AG are throwing massive resources into electrification. VW has vowed a $33 billion push to bring battery-powered autos to the masses. Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). has had an automotive project since about 2016, although it is said to have scaled back its ambitions.\n\nThere are growing concerns that the ample supply of cheap funding for new-age carmakers is about to dry up, according to Bernstein.\n\nAs to Dyson, the company said it plans to continue its 2.5 billion-pound ($3.1 billion) investment program into new technology, and will concentrate on manufacturing solid-state batteries and other technologies including machine learning and robotics.\n\n\u201cSingapore will play an important role in Dyson\u2019s growth plans,\u201d Tan Kong Hwee, assistant managing director at Singapore\u2019s Economic Development Board, said in an emailed statement Friday. Despite Dyson\u2019s decision, Singapore \u201cremains interested in advanced manufacturing activities, including for EVs,\u201d he said.\n\nExperts had questioned the company\u2019s costly plans to build an electric car plant in Singapore, where average salaries are among the highest in the world. Ford Motor (NYSE: ) Co. closed its factory in the city-state about 40 years ago, effectively ending car production on the island.\n\n\u201cIf everybody else is building a plant in China at a fraction of the cost in terms of labor, it didn\u2019t make a lot of sense for anybody to build that size of a manufacturing facility over there,\u201d said Steve Man, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence in Hong Kong. \u201cI hope Singapore wasn\u2019t expecting much from this.\u201d\n\nStill, Singapore has much riding on Dyson in its efforts to attract start-ups and advanced technology companies. Dyson became one of the biggest global industry names to ever relocate there.\n\nThere\u2019s another sector Dyson is looking to invest in Singapore. The family office of James Dyson has incorporated in the city state and is in the process of hiring IT and finance-service staff, according to job advertisements posted on Dyson\u2019s website. The family office was established in 2013 and employs around 55 people globally.\n\n\u201cIt would have been nice to have but the reality is OK, it\u2019s not going to work let\u2019s look at something else,\u201d said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB Private Banking in Singapore. \u201cIt\u2019s still about making money.\u201d", "description": "Dyson Becomes Latest Sign That Electric-Car Bubble Is Bursting", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic6872ad7a1d90e552d2ea1eb3c96f6e3d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
