Amazon just debuted the first full-length trailer for its upcoming Modern Love rom-com anthology series, which was adapted from everyone\u2019s favorite New York Times column about, well, very real modern love stories. The trailer takes on a more This Is Us-ish tone than the first teaser, showing clips from the series\u2019s eight episodes that look like they might add some -dram to the rom-com of it all. Catherine Keener reads Dev Patel like an open book. Anne Hathaway\u2019s gold paillettes and very red hair beguile Downton Abbey\u2019s Gary Carr. Andy Garcia\u2019s mere presence beguiles anyone who watches the trailer. Fleabag\u2019s Hot Priest Andrew Scott is not a priest but is still hot. Tina Fey and John Slattery are in couple\u2019s counseling, in an episode directed by Sharon Horgan, queen of intelligent Amazon rom-coms. And Cristin Milioti does that exact thing she does, which is star in things like this. John Carney, who demonstrated a knack for both stomping on and resuscitating hearts with Once, Begin Again, and Sing Street, is the executive producer for the series. It\u2019s set to premiere on October 18, just in time for those cozy cashmere autumnal rom-com vibes.\n\nRelated", "description": "Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey, Hot Priest Andrew Scott, and more star in anthology series Modern Love, which will premiere on Amazon October 18.
