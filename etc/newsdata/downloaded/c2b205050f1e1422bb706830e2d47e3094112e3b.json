Didn't expect it to get that much pub, but it is what it is.\"\n\nRobey-Coleman estimates he has watched the replay \"at least 4,000 or 5,000 times\" since January.\n\nFor anyone who somehow missed it: The Saints had a third-and-10 from the Los Angeles 13 with 1:45 left in the fourth quarter of a tied game, and the Rams had just one timeout left. Drew Brees spotted Lewis coming free for a potential first-down catch, but so did Robey-Coleman.\n\nInstead of going for an interception, Robey-Coleman delivered an early helmet-to-helmet hit that sent the wideout tumbling to the ground. A flag would have put New Orleans in position to score go-ahead points with almost no time left on the clock \u2014 but the officials didn't throw it, and the play wasn't reviewable on replay.\n\nNew Orleans kicked a field goal, but left enough time for Jared Goff to drive the Rams for a tying field goal of their own. After Brees threw an interception in overtime, Greg Zuerlein's 57-yard field goal sent the Rams to the Super Bowl.\n\nRobey-Coleman has always acknowledged he got away with pass interference, even saying it moments after the Rams' 26-23 victory.\n\n\"Never disputed it,\" he said. \"I'm on record. Told it how it was from the time that it happened until now. I never went against what I said. Just was clear and honest.\"", "description": "From his youth in central Florida to his college career at USC, Nickell Robey-Coleman dreamed of making a mark on NFL history.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/NFL-Nickell-Robey-Coleman2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
