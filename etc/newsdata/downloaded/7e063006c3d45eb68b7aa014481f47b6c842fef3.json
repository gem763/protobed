She alleges that she was then raped by two other men, who cheered and high-fived each other before she was taken back into the city.\n\nWe first saw the news via Vice. You can read the lawsuit here.\n\nTurkos alleges that she spent the following day traumatized and confused. She knew something was wrong as she was in so much pain she couldn't leave her bed or raise her arms, and was experiencing vaginal bleeding. She started to piece together what happened after she saw that her Lyft ride home, which should have taken 15 minutes, had taken 79 minutes. Vice reported that the trip had cost her $106.80.\n\nTurkos got in touch with the company but only received an automated response apologising for the inconvenience and giving her a partial refund of $93.99. She subsequently went to the police and obtained a rape kit.\n\nRead more: 14 women have filed a lawsuit against Lyft accusing the company of not addressing a \"sexual predator crisis\" among drivers\n\nEmails viewed by Vice also showed that Lyft promised to \"unpair\" her from the driver, and its explanation for the length of the trip was: \"The driver might have forgot to end the ride.\" In a subsequent response a Lyft representative told Turkos that poor internet connection, an old phone, or faulty software could have been the cause.\n\nTurkos filed the lawsuit against Lyft on Tuesday, claiming the firm is failing in its duty to keep sexual predators off the platform.\n\n\"Lyft's response to this sexual predator crisis amongst Lyft drivers has been appallingly inadequate,\" the lawsuit states. This language closely echoes a suit filed by 14 anonymous female Lyft passengers earlier this month. Following this flurry of accusations, Lyft brought in safety features including a 911 panic button in its app.\n\nIn the lawsuit Turkos also alleges that Lyft allowed her attacker to continue driving after the police began investigating her complaint, just under a different name.\n\n\"After Plaintiff reported this driver to Lyft and law enforcement contacted Lyft about this driver in relation to an investigation of Plaintiff's allegations of kidnapping, human trafficking and rape, Lyft continued to allow this driver to continue driving for Lyft under a different name, endangering the safety of countless unsuspecting passengers,\" the suit alleges.\n\nLyft was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Business Insider, but a Lyft spokesperson told Vice the driver in question had passed the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission's background check.", "description": "Alison Turkos alleges she was abducted at gunpoint by her Lyft driver in 2017 and raped by two other men.", "authors": ["Isobel Asher Hamilton"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d81f56f2e22af671704e746-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
