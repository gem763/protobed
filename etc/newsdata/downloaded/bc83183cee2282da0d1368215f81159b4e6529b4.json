It's properly dead, with NBN Co proposing to increase the data inclusions within the connectivity virtual circuit charges.\n\nThe proposal was quickly dubbed the 'Netflix tax', after news broke that NBN Co's consultation process asked resellers whether they would support \"the development of a price response whereby charging of streaming video could be differentiated from the charging of other traffic/services\". The internet naturally hit the roof, but NBN Co has since confirmed in the release of its pricing consultation paper it will instead focus on increasing the bandwidth of speeds offered in the connectivity virtual circuit charge (CVC).\n\nEven Telstra Hates The NBN Shitting on the NBN is fast becoming one of Australia's favourite pastimes. This week Telstra joined the ranks of those complaining about the cost of a service that hasn't delivered on many of its promises - from speeds to roll out timelines.

In its place is a range of options including a more affordable NBN 100/20 plan at $58/month, which sacrifices 20Mbps of upload speed from the existing $65/month 100/40 plan on the market.\n\nResellers will still pay the CVC charge, but the amount of data included will be increased slightly. The CVC is a charge the NBN applies to resellers, like Telstra or TPG, in order for them to supply bandwidth to their customers. It's proposing to increase that bandwidth while maintaining the same cost (CVC charge) to deal with the growing need for data.\n\nThe Netflix Tax, as it was coined, came to light when iTNews revealed the NBN Co asked RSPs if it would be viable to treat video traffic differently from other forms of traffic. Apart from the obvious pricing implications \u2014 which NBN Co denied it was seriously considering at the time \u2014 the proposal also raised concerns about NBN Co bargaining away net neutrality, the principle that all internet traffic should be treated equally.\n\nNBN Co is seeking to balance industry economics with affordability and choice for customers. The pricing review paper is not about levying additional charges on customers but rather how we can collectively deliver the best possible service to customers, including for streaming. \u2014 nbn\u2122 Australia (@NBN_Australia) July 2, 2019\n\nLater that month, Telstra released a scathing blog post about the state of the NBN and while it didn't mention the video streaming specifically, it had a lot to say about the service more generally.\n\n\"Wholesale broadband prices have more than doubled under the NBN and are set to go even higher. The consequence of this is that it's unprofitable for retail service providers to resell NBN at the current retail prices,\" Telstra's CEO Andrew Penn wrote. \"Under the current NBN pricing these objectives, along with the overall sustainability of the industry, are increasingly at risk.\"\n\nPenn recommended the NBN implement the following changes:\n\nRemoval of the separate volume-based pricing charge (CVC).\n\nSimpler single-point pricing for the standard NBN speed tiers (50/20 and 100/40) with prices reduced by around $20.\n\nLowering of the price for superfast services (250 Mbit and up) to under $100.\n\nIntroduction of a $10 per month voice-only service.\n\nIntroduction of a wholesale price discount for targeted vulnerable and low-income customers in need.\n\nAussie Broadband also called on NBN Co to reduce the cost of plans beyond 100 Mbps. \"We would actually like to see nbn develop additional discount bundles for the 150/100 and 250/100 speed tiers, as we believe there is a market for these speeds if the price was reduced,\" an Aussie Broadband representative told Kotaku Australia.\n\nOutcomes from the NBN's consultation papers are expected to be announced this November.", "description": "Remember that horrible NBN Co idea to \"differentiate video traffic\" and basically put net neutrality up for debate in Australia?
