The seven-time defending NL West champion Dodgers, who led the NL with 106 wins, remain without a World Series title since 1988.\n\nAdam Eaton walked against Kelly leading off the 10th, Rendon doubled on a drive that lodged in the left field wall and Soto was intentionally walked.\n\nKendrick fouled off a pitch, then hit a 97mph fastball over the wall in center for his second career slam. The other one was a game-ending, 11th-inning drive against San Francisco in August 2017. Center fielder Cody Bellinger chased the ball all the way to the wall, putting his arms up against the fence as he ran out of room.\n\nWashington Nationals (@Nationals) THIS IS HOWIE HIT A GRAND SLAM IN A TIE GAME OF THE 10TH INNING OF GAME 5 OF THE NLDS!!!#BEATLA // #STAYINTHEFIGHT pic.twitter.com/3RMsby8CBl\n\nWashington overcame a 19-31 start, finished 93-69, then rallied from a 3-0, eighth-inning deficit to beat Milwaukee 4-3 in the NL wild-card game.\n\n\u201cIt was electric. Probably the best moment of my career,\u201d said the 36-year-old Kedrick, a 14-year big league veteran. \u201cWe never gave up. The city had faith in us, the fans had faith in us. We believed in ourselves, everybody came through for us.\u201d\n\nDaniel Hudson got the win, retiring Will Smith on a drive to the right field warning track with one on and one out in the ninth, then getting Chris Taylor on a liner to center.\n\nSean Doolittle pitched the a perfect 10th for the Nationals, ending a streak of three straight NLCS appearances by the Dodgers.\n\nThe Nationals/Montreal Expos franchise won a postseason series for only the second time, the first since the Expos beat Philadelphia in a 1981 Division Series caused by the midseason players\u2019 strike.\n\nStephen Strasburg fell behind 2-0 after eight pitches. Joc Pederson doubled on a drive that went through an opening in the left-field wall \u2013 the crowd saw it land in the seats and thought it was a home run \u2013 but he was awarded the double after a video review. Muncy, who had been 0 for 12 against Strasburg, drove a fastball over the center-field wall.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez on Strasburg\u2019s second pitch of the second inning, another fastball, for a 3-0 lead.\n\nStrasburg gave up three runs and six hits in six innings, struck out seven and walked one.\n\nThere was a scary moment leading off the seventh.\n\nBuehler allowed one run and four hits in six and two-thirds innings before Kershaw came in. There was a scary moment starting the seventh when Buehler hit Suzuki in the left wrist and the ball shot up and knocked off his helmet as the ballpark went silent. Suzuki fell to the ground, grabbing his face. He walked off his under his own power and was replaced by Yan Gomes, who moved behind the plate in the bottom half.\n\nCards oust Braves with record first inning\n\nThe Cardinals turned the diamond into a giant pinball machine, dinging hits all over SunTrust Park.\n\nBy the time the Atlanta Braves finally got the third out, it was the most productive first inning in postseason history.\n\nThe Cardinals scored 10 runs their first time up and dealt Atlanta another playoff heartbreak, routing the Braves 13-1 in decisive Game 5 of the NL Division Series on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThat was crazy,\u201d said Marcell Ozuna, one of five players who batted twice in the stunning outburst. \u201cWe got a good opportunity \u2014 and we took it.\u201d\n\nBefore many fans had reached their seats, the Cardinals were already booking their plans for the NL Championship Series, where they will face Washington in a best-of-seven set beginning Friday at Busch Stadium.\n\nIt will be St. Louis\u2019 first NLCS trip since 2014.\n\n\u201cWe know we can beat anyone at this point,\u201d Kolten Wong said.\n\nFor the Braves, it might take a while to get over this debacle.\n\nAfter pitching seven scoreless innings in a Game 2 win, Mike Foltynewicz retired only one hitter before getting yanked. First baseman Freddie Freeman booted a potential double-play ball that might have limited the damage. The Cardinals scored their final run of the inning on a strikeout \u2013 a wild pitch in the dirt that skipped away from catcher Brian McCann.\n\n\u201cWe just strung together a bunch of great at-bats,\u201d Wong said.\n\nIt was Atlanta\u2019s 10th straight postseason round loss since its last victory 18 long years ago, tying the ignominious mark set by the Chicago Cubs between 1908 and 2003.\n\nCarrying on the tradition that started at Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium, moved on to Turner Field and is now becoming an annual occurrence at SunTrust Park, it was a visiting team that got to celebrate in the A-T-L.\n\nThe Cardinals broke out T-shirts and caps, hopped around in the middle of the infield and gathered on the pitcher\u2019s mound for a team portrait with the center field video board looming as a backdrop.\n\nFor the 13th time in 21 postseason appearances since moving to Atlanta, the Braves finished the year with a loss on their home field.\n\n\u201cIt was more of a shock than anything,\u201d said Josh Donaldson, whose homer provided the lone Atlanta run. \u201cYou don\u2019t expect something like that to happen, especially with how well we played all season.\u201d\n\nThe Cardinals batted around and got more than halfway through their order a second time before the Braves even came to the plate.\n\nTommy Edman, Dexter Fowler and Wong all had two-run doubles as St Louis equaled the highest-scoring inning in postseason history, a record set by the Philadelphia Athletics against the Chicago Cubs in the 1929 World Series. It was matched by the Detroit Tigers (1968 World Series v St Louis), the Anaheim Angels (2002 ALCS v Minnesota) and, now, the Cardinals.\n\nNo team had ever scored 10 runs in the very first inning of a postseason game. It was the first time the Braves franchise has allowed that many opening-inning runs in any game since they were in Boston on 2 July 1925 against the Brooklyn Robins.\n\nThe Cardinals made several changes after their 10-spot in what might\u2019ve been the first set of defensive moves ever made by a team before its opponent had batted. There was no need to worry about any more offense with budding ace Jack Flaherty on the mound, coming off one of the great second halves by a starting pitcher in baseball history.\n\nSt. Louis Cardinals (@Cardinals) 10-RUN FIRST INNING\n\n\n\nWALK\n\nSAC BUNT\n\nSINGLE\n\nSINGLE\n\nFIELDERS CHOICE\n\nWALK\n\nDOUBLE\n\nINTENTIONAL WALK\n\nWALK\n\nDOUBLE\n\nDOUBLE\n\nFLY OUT\n\nSTRIKEOUT (REACHED ON WILD PITCH)\n\nGROUNDOUT pic.twitter.com/bL6YhJsQfK\n\n\u201cWe took the crowd out of it,\u201d Fowler said. \u201cWe knew Folty would try to get ahead of us. We were trying to get some good pitches to hit. It was a little easier to see the ball today.\u201d\n\nManager Mike Shildt let the 23-year-old Flaherty throw 104 pitches over six innings, surrendering four hits for the first postseason win of his blossoming career. Flaherty loaded the bases in the fifth after drilling Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr with a fastball, but induced an inning-ending groundout from Freeman.\n\nThis one, though, will long be remembered for what happened before Flaherty even took the mound.", "description": "Howie Kendrick hit a tiebreaking grand slam off Joe Kelly in the 10th inning to lead Washington to an NLDS-clinching win over the favored LA Dodgers", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42ce1159c688c22626b92243923570dc28f505e5/0_106_3367_2020/master/3367.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6b20ed48332df20e7e06c7c7a53e57af", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
