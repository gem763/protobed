While there is value in writers and directors looking to tell stories that might feasibly chime with audiences, to insist we should each feel a kinship with those on our screens is to deprive ourselves of TV\u2019s most deliciously repellent characters.\n\nAnd few shows are as full of those as Succession, the comedy-drama about the billionaire Roy family, headed by fearsome patriarch Logan (Brian Cox), who preside over a vast media empire taking in news channels, film, local TV and theme parks. The protagonists are despicable \u2013 self-interested, emotionally stunted, and grossly entitled. Only a psychopath could relate to them. And yet they are mesmerising. To spend time with them is to marvel at the lengths they will go to in order to outmanoeuvre one another, and to thrill at lines such as: \u201cPolitics is what comes out of the asshole. Wouldn\u2019t you rather be upfront and feeding the horse?\u201d\n\nRight now, we don\u2019t need our noses gratuitously rubbed in ruthless capitalism, which is why Succession, with its scorching script and visceral performances, takes a somewhat different tack. The wealth on display, seen in the private helicopters, the gleaming townhouses and gargantuan country piles, is indisputably grotesque, but the series is less about the accumulation of money than the mindset that comes with extreme privilege. The Roys can afford to take wealth for granted, though as the sibling rivalry shows, power is another matter. There is no trust or camaraderie between the Roy children \u2013 not when their father\u2019s favour, and a prime position within the company, is at stake.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWe are now midway through the second season, and Kendall (Jeremy Strong), the eldest son, is a husk undone by a failed company coup and an accidental death \u2013 humiliation and self-loathing leaks from his every pore. His sister Shiv (Sarah Snook), as sharp of mind as of elbow, is, unbeknownst to her brothers, gently easing herself into the top job \u2013 that is, if Logan\u2019s murmurings about stepping aside are to be believed (they rarely are). Meanwhile, the youngest brother Roman (Kieran Culkin), a diminutive Dr Evil with a bottomless supply of snark, seesaws between promotion and demotion, all the while desperate to earn daddy\u2019s respect.\n\nWhile a cleverly observed TV series needn\u2019t deliver characters that we\u2019d happily take home to meet our parents, it\u2019s always a plus when it tells us something about the age in which we live. It is no coincidence that Succession has been created at a time when our political overlords are, broadly speaking, a bunch of self-serving, swivel-eyed dim-bulbs born into privilege and clueless about the lives of ordinary citizens, and in which disgustingly rich men, from Weinstein to Epstein, brazenly trash lives.\n\nSuccession\u2019s abuses of power are so commonplace as to be barely worth remarking on. Potentially damaging interactions with the public are spirited away with an NDA and a wad of cash. One-upmanship, back-stabbing and double-crossing are routine; personal ambition comes before the public good; lying is the default position; cruelty is rewarded; incompetence is the norm. Ring any bells? For all its demented humour, Succession\u2019s gilded world is just a whisker away from our own.\n\nIn the latest episode, Roman, a man you\u2019d scarcely trust with a tin opener let alone an entire media conglomeration, has been sent on a management training course in order to mix with \u201cnormals\u201d who at least know the price of milk. Asked what everyday people like to do in their downtime, he replies: \u201cHow the f*** should I know what everyday people like? I like booking out a suite at the chateau and snorting purified sertraline off women that don\u2019t know they\u2019re prostitutes yet.\u201d If you\u2019d asked the same question of the members of the Bullingdon Club circa 1992, chances are the reply wouldn\u2019t be so different.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Attenborough\u2019s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families.
