Sex And The City, Entourage, and Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys are among the worst offenders, overpowering exceptions to the rule like The Inbetweeners Movie or South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut.\n\nThis year represents somewhat of a changing tide. Downton Abbey has reigned at the box office and was positively received for capturing the show\u2019s spirit, while Deadwood: The Movie met overwhelming praise (97 per cent on Rotten Tomatoes) for providing the satisfying conclusion it never had when the show abruptly ended in 2006.\n\nEl Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie is arguably the riskiest of them all. The show, often ranked among the best ever created and one of the kickstarters for TV\u2019s golden age, ended in 2013 with the rare fortunes of a well-received climax. Creator Vince Gilligan even broke the second TV show curse by having a spin-off, Better Call Saul, which proved equally as exquisite.\n\nJesse Pinkman is on the run from the law in El Camino (Picture: Netflix)\n\nSo why come back after such a high? In returning to Breaking Bad\u2019s world, El Camino wisely plays it safe to avoid rewriting its golden path. While it doesn\u2019t feel entirely necessary, or match the show\u2019s highest peaks, the film serves as a beautifully crafted epilogue to Jesse Pinkman\u2019s (Aaron Paul) story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPicking up directly after the season five finale, Jesse has escaped Jack\u2019s neo-nazi compound after being enslaved and forced to cook crystal meth. With Walter White (Bryan Cranston) dead, police are hunting Jesse to tie up the remaining loose end of their fallen drug empire, leaving him to try and scramble for a fresh start against the law\u2019s pursuit.\n\nWhile we won\u2019t spoil where Jesse ends up, El Camino sticks to this simple story in a surprisingly straight-forward way. There\u2019s no twists or big reveals which majorly affect your understanding of what\u2019s come before. In fact, flashback sequences serve little more than a chance to see key characters back on screen again, but the stellar execution from a writing and directing standpoint makes these scenes a joy to soak up.\n\nEl Camino also wisely doesn\u2019t try to work as a standalone movie. This is a film designed as an epilogue tale to Breaking Bad, filling in the blanks for characters you\u2019re familiar with while posing new questions for others who aren\u2019t addressed. This might disappoint some looking for more substance, and there is a sense Vince Gilligan is hesitant to offer too much to avoid tampering with the past, but it works as a bonus, gratifying farewell.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nAs with the original show, this movie is a worthwhile trip for the production alone. Directed and written by Vince himself, El Camino is a constant visual treat of sprawling desert landscapes and imaginative camera work. Aaron Paul also naturally slots back into Jesse\u2019s psyche, delivering a performance which taps into his past scars and tortured mindset effortlessly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile movie versions of TV shows have a tendency to shoot bigger and louder, El Camino smartly does the opposite. This is a reflective and contemplative last bow for Jesse Pinkman who, after going through hell over the show\u2019s course, is given a worthy send-off to satisfy those looking for another spin in Breaking Bad\u2019s world. It might take few risks, but this is a skillfully-crafted victory lap for one of the best TV shows ever created.\n\nEl Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie is available on Netflix now.\n\nMORE: Footballers\u2019 Wives reboot in the works after Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy drama \u2013 have our prayers been answered?\n\nMORE: Is Walter White in the Breaking Bad movie El Camino on Netflix?", "description": "Jesse Pinkman is given the ending he deserves in this thrilling, if safe, victory lap for Breaking Bad's legacy.", "authors": ["Adam Starkey"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/PRI_86748383_1570798315.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
