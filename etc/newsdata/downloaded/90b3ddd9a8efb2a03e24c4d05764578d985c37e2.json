On the eve of being sworn into the Senate, Mr. Romney published an op-ed in The Washington Post in which he concluded that Mr. Trump had \u201cnot risen to the mantle of the office.\u201d This was two years after then-President-elect Trump had engaged Mr. Romney about possibly serving as his secretary of state. Mr. Romney said he most likely would have taken the job if offered, but it was not \u2014 and just as well.\n\n\u201cThe best personnel decision he made was not choosing me,\u201d Mr. Romney said. \u201cI would not have lasted as long as Rex Tillerson,\u201d he added of the eventual choice \u201cand maybe a little longer than Anthony Scaramucci did,\u201d referring to the White House communications director who lasted less than two weeks in the job\u2026\n\n\u201cI think that Donald Trump thinks a lot more about Mitt Romney than Mitt Romney thinks about Donald Trump,\u201d said Stuart Stevens, a Republican media consultant and chief strategist of Mr. Romney\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign. \u201cDonald Trump is fundamentally an unhappy, angry person. Mitt Romney is fundamentally a happy not angry person.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Mark Leibovich", "Nytimes.Com Us Politics Mitt-Romney-Donald-Trump.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
