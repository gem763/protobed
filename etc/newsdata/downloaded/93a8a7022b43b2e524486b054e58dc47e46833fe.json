International were down 0.5% to $59.43.\n\nCrude inventories rose by 4.5 million for the week ended Oct. 18, the API said.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration (EIA)\u2019s weekly report is due tomorrow. Analysts expect the EIA to report a build of 2.23 million barrels.\n\nOil prices have slumped about 18% from an April peak as the Sino-U.S. trade war dragged on and as global supplies swelled.\n\nCiting unnamed OPEC sources, Reuters reported that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its partners are concerned about the demand outlook next year.\n\n\u201cIf we see that the official number is in line with the API data, I suspect we would see a severe reaction and heavy selling in crude markets,\u201d said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets Asia Pacific Pty, in a Bloomberg report.\n\n\u201cThe next OPEC meeting is not until December. The market will remain cautious and is very vulnerable to headline risk.\u201d", "description": "Oil Prices Trade Lower as API Data Shows Crude Stockpiles Rise Last Week", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE2J0AZ-ORUBS_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
