Photo: Mark Peterson/Redux\n\nThe road back to the campaign trail begins with the Look. Do you know the one I mean? The Look is one of searching, of scanning, of wanting. For half a second, the eyes swell with hope \u2014 cartoonish, glassy. Every passing person presents an opportunity. Do you know me? the eyes ask. Can I shake your hand, slap your back, kiss your baby?\n\nMark Sanford was giving the Look left and right. In the direction of the young couple sitting in a hammock. An older couple on a bench. A man approaching on his jog. A golden retriever.\n\nIt was dusk in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, the suburban town six miles from downtown Charleston where Sanford lives. A short drive from his house, there\u2019s the ocean walk \u2014 a beautiful stretch of pavement and palmetto-studded grass that extends through the marsh to a pier on the Cooper River. Sanford walked along the path in his flip-flops. He was preparing for a trip to Iowa, a euphemism for declaring your candidacy for your party\u2019s presidential nomination. Some people recognized him, even offered words of encouragement. Others breezed past, unaware or uninterested in the man whom the president was, in fact, tweeting about at that very moment.\n\n\u201cCan you believe it? I\u2019m at 94 percent approval in the Republican Party, and have Three Stooges running against me. One is \u2018Mr. Appalachian Trail\u2019 who was actually in Argentina for bad reasons \u2026,\u201d Donald Trump wrote.\n\nIt can rarely be said that Trump is right, but on this he is, almost: Among Republicans, he maintains sky-high levels of support, though not the 94 percent he claims. According to Gallup, 88 percent of Republicans assess him favorably. When you talk to reluctant Trump voters \u2014 not the MAGA-hat-wearing rallygoers but rich white people \u2014 they cite the Supreme Court and tax reform as enough justification for their position; that whatever damage he has wrought, these victories denied to conservatives during eight years of Barack Obama are worth it. And besides, many of them think this will all be short-lived. Why bother trying to help a Joe Walsh or a Bill Weld when Trump will probably be defeated in the general?\n\nWhich again raises the question of who deserves more ridicule: the Republicans brimming with cynicism or those who believe they can change the future of the party. Sanford is a conservative from the more innocent time of, like, a few years ago, before Trump and the cultlike creed of his loyal fans supplanted Establishment Republican orthodoxy. News of his candidacy has been welcomed by some of his fellow travelers: Jennifer Rubin, the Washington Post columnist, said she felt \u201crelief\u201d to hear what Sanford has to say. He could be, as the headline read, \u201cthe last chance\u201d for their party. In the New York Times, Liz Mair, a \u201cNever Trump\u201d operative, called him \u201cthe biggest Republican threat to Trump.\u201d These assessments are undercut by the reality that the Republican National Committee and the state parties seem intent on guarding against legitimate challenges to an internally popular president. There is just one GOP debate scheduled so far, hosted by Business Insider. Trump won\u2019t be attending. South Carolina, Kansas, Nevada, and Arizona have canceled their nominating contests ahead of the October filing deadline. And the GOP primary polling, of course, is bleak. A Boston Herald\u2013FPU survey released on September 11 has Trump up 85 points over Weld (3 percent) and Walsh (one percent).\n\nSanford in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.

His last years as governor were mired in scandal after he went off the radar to visit his girlfriend in Argentina for several days in 2009 \u2014 which wouldn\u2019t have been a problem except for the fact that he had a wife, and a state to run, and nobody knew where the hell he was. His staff told reporters he\u2019d said something about going to hike the Appalachian Trail, which is the only detail that has really stuck after all this time. Still, he was elected to Congress in 2013 and elected again and then again. He lost his seat after last fall\u2019s primary with an assist from Trump, who endorsed Sanford\u2019s opponent and called him \u201cunhelpful to me in my campaign to MAGA.\u201d\n\nSanford retreated for a while. He taught a course at the University of Chicago. But people kept approaching him, he said, with this crazy idea. At first, he dismissed it. But after a while, after \u201csome people I respect and trust\u201d were the ones doing the calling, \u201cI began to break through.\u201d\n\nAs different as American politics is now, it remains standard for its actors to refuse to go away, judgment of the electorate be damned. Once you\u2019ve sipped from the well of the swamp, you never leave the party for long. That\u2019s true even if Washington is more like the Donner Party these days. Or maybe it\u2019s more true now because striving to hang on can so easily be sold as a fight to save the republic \u2014 or some shred of it, anyway.\n\nIt was getting darker, and Sanford, wearing Levi\u2019s crusted with grass and dirt and paint, sat down on a bench overlooking the water. \u201cI keep waiting for somebody else to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody else goes, they keep calling.\u201d\n\nThe only Republicans primarying Trump were the former governor of Massachusetts best known for joining the Libertarian Party ticket with Gary Johnson in 2016 and a one-term tea-party congressman from Illinois best known for tweeting nearly as much as the president. \u201cFinally,\u201d Sanford said, \u201cyou\u2019re like, Okay, I\u2019ll roll the grenade down the aisle.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Lauren Matarazzo\n\nSanford\u2019s sure he\u2019s not going to get elected president. It would be \u201cdelusional\u201d to think otherwise, and he\u2019s not that. He hasn\u2019t bothered with formal polling. \u201cYou will lose to Donald Trump. That\u2019s what it will tell you,\u201d he said. You just have to look at the history of primary challenges to sitting presidents to know that. \u201cIt\u2019s not to say it was not worthwhile, because in some cases it completely changed, or partially changed, the debate,\u201d he said. And he knows Trump and his supporters will continue to harass him over the scandal from ten years ago \u2014 seeing no irony in their selective outrage over a man\u2019s extramarital curricula. \u201cIt\u2019s all kinda out there,\u201d he told me. \u201c2009 was a process of letting go, of saying, \u2018I\u2019m not in charge. As much as I might try to be, I am not in charge.\u2019\u201d He and Mar\u00eda Bel\u00e9n Chapur broke off their engagement in 2016, after seven years together. \u201cI wish that you could say that you completely control who you fall in love with, but that certainly wasn\u2019t my experience. And so you end up in an awful mess,\u201d he said. \u201cI regret how I handled it \u2026 I always feel bad about it. You wish you could hit rewind play on different chapters of your life, but that\u2019s not life.\u201d He encountered some Trump supporters recently at a barbecue with Vice-President Mike Pence. When they saw him, they chanted, \u201cTake a hike! Take a hike! Take a hike! Trump! Trump! Trump!\u201d He laughed as he recalled this, like, What the fuck? Nobody had ever chanted the phrase at him before, he said (which surprised me!), \u201cPeople compartmentalize like you would not believe,\u201d he said, \u201cYou\u2019re sitting there thinking, \u2018Now wait, let me get this right. Your guy, we won\u2019t go there, but you\u2019re going to \u2026\u201d He trailed off. \u201cBut no, people compartmentalize as you can\u2019t imagine. They give everybody a nickname. I wouldn\u2019t look forward to mine. And they seem to stick with it. They\u2019re very good at it.\u201d\n\nIn this sense, he is clear-eyed and almost transparent about what he\u2019s up to here. He crossed his leg and absentmindedly picked at the nail on his big toe. He crossed his leg and absentmindedly picked at the nail of his big toe. \u201cI don\u2019t mind going into hostile environments to test ideas and to talk to people. I don\u2019t mind that at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI happen to believe the Republican Party will be stronger if we have a debate about what it means to be a Republican. Right now, there\u2019s a robust debate on the Democratic side on what it means to be a Democrat and \u2018What are our hopes and values and dreams?\u2019 and all those sorts of things. While on the Republican side, it\u2019s simply sun, moon, and stars revolve around Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nUnlike Walsh, a Trump voter turned Never Trumper whose platform is a reaction to the existential threat Trump poses to the GOP and the country broadly, Sanford has a single issue on his platform (the national debt) and implied exhaustion, or boredom, with the entire subject of the current president \u2014 sort of like, Is it really necessary that we talk about this guy all of the damn time? \u201cAs bad as he is, he doesn\u2019t have the capacity to sink our republic. Where we\u2019re going in terms of the debts and the deficit issue has the capacity to sink our republic,\u201d Sanford said.\n\n\u201cYou got 20-plus Democrats, and Joe Walsh and Bill Weld as well, who will tell you all the character flaws of Trump,\u201d he continued. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s new news.\u201d\n\nA man walking by called out to him.\n\n\u201cWhat do you say, Mark? You gonna do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. Trying to figure it out!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gotta do it, man!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou gotta do it!\u201d\n\nSanford smiled. \u201cHave a good one,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got my vote!\u201d\n\n*This article appears in the September 16, 2019, issue of New York Magazine.
