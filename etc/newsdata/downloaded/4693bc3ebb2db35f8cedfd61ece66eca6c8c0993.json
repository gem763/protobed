Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) argued, \u201cWe need to do the right thing regardless of who\u2019s benefiting,\u201d before noting that there is an outsize number of Republican seats up for grabs next year.\n\nA Senate trial \u201cwill make it make it very difficult for them to choose,\u201d added Stabenow, the No. 4 Senate Democrat. \u201cIf I were them in many of the states where people are running, I certainly would, politically, be concerned about taking that vote.\u201d\n\nDemocrats need to net at least three seats to win back the Senate, provided they also win back the presidency. And they have several opportunities to do so, but it will mean winning at least some races in states Trump carried in 2016.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/9f/5e/efb5847e4b42a358b4de7e606b6b/ukraine-site.png\"\n\nDemocrats consider the most vulnerable Republican senators to be Cory Gardner of Colorado, Martha McSally of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, with several others viewed as reach-states that could become increasingly competitive or fall off the map altogether depending, in part, on Trump\u2019s popularity.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a very problematic vote in a lot of states,\u201d said Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). \u201cPublic sentiment has shifted. The polling numbers suggest much stronger support for pursuing an impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nRepublicans largely dismiss the notion that impeachment poses a political threat.\n\n\"The idea that this is a political winner for Democrats is total fiction. Having three of the most liberal senators say differently doesn\u2019t make it true,\" said Kevin McLaughlin, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \"This strikes me as nothing more than an attempt by liberal members to bully others in their party.\"\n\nSome GOP senators and the Senate Republican campaign arm have also fundraised off impeachment to rile up the conservative base. And so far, most vulnerable Republicans are striking a defiant tone.\n\n\u201cTo me it\u2019s not a hard vote. The facts lead you where they lead. What I\u2019ve seen to this point makes me wonder if it\u2019s going to be anything other than a political exercise,\u201d Tillis said. \u201cHaving the Democrats on record for a frivolous activity on an impeachment vote may be a hard vote for them.\u201d\n\nNational polls show an uptick in support for an impeachment inquiry amid the Ukraine firestorm, but how that will translate to the politics of an impeachment trial in the Senate won\u2019t be clear for months.\n\n\u201cHaving the Democrats on record for a frivolous activity on an impeachment vote may be a hard vote for them.\u201d - Sen. Thom Tillis\n\nMost Democratic challengers to GOP senators also backed the House opening an impeachment inquiry against Trump but have been more cautious and measured in their statements on it.\n\nSenate Democrats are also protecting incumbents in two states that Trump won in 2016 for whom an impeachment vote could be challenging: Doug Jones of Alabama and Gary Peters of Michigan. Both senators backed the House impeachment inquiry but expressed caution on handicapping the outcome. In a speech on the Senate floor on impeachment, Jones angrily said, \u201cpartisan tribalism is taking over already.\u201d\n\nDemocrats recognize they need to be cautious in how they talk about trying to oust the president: It does them no good to be seen as pursuing impeachment for political gain. Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) said impeachment \u201cshould not be a political consideration at all,\u201d while Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), a presidential contender, said, \u201cThis is a time to put country over party, and I hope that people have the courage to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm concerned, I think like many people, that we have a president of the United States who calls a president of a foreign country and asks them to investigate his political rival,\u201d said Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. The DSCC has done little explicit impeachment messaging in recent days.\n\nBattleground state Republicans largely brushed off a transcript of Trump\u2019s conversation with Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky, in which Trump urged Zelensky to probe former Vice President Joe Biden, one of his main rivals in 2020. But few commented after the subsequent release of a whistleblower report documenting more alleged malfeasance.\n\nDemocrats say it\u2019s only going to get worse as the inquiry reveals more of the president's conduct.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be much more difficult than they are suggesting right now,\u201d said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), a former prosecutor. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard, I think, if you\u2019re in their shoes to hold out for very long the pretense that the transcript of the Zelensky phone call was exculpatory. As a guy who spent part of his life listening to organized crime wiretaps, you don\u2019t get much better than that.\u201d\n\nAs they prepared to head home and regroup for a two-week recess, Republicans tried several different approaches to ease the pressure.\n\n\u201cThe House ought to quit messing around and just go ahead and vote.\" - Sen. John Cornyn\n\nGardner called for a search for the facts while Collins insisted that she can\u2019t comment on daily events when she may serve as a juror in a conviction trial. Tillis and McSally moved to quickly dismiss questions of impeachment, with McSally predicting it would backfire on Democrats.\n\nAnd Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), whose race could be competitive, basically urged Speaker Nancy Pelosi to send him impeachment articles so the Senate can dismiss them.\n\n\u201cThe House ought to quit messing around and just go ahead and vote,\u201d he said. \"I'm not going to vote to convict somebody without any evidence.\"\n\nWhen asked about the politics of the situation, most Republicans will say it\u2019s an overreach by Pelosi that will backfire on Democrats. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who was a leading advocate for impeaching former President Bill Clinton, said, \u201cWe all thought we were right and the public thought we were a little crazy.\u201d\n\nIt is possible Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) could try to minimize an impeachment trial in the Senate through parliamentary procedures. Yet most Republicans believe the Senate is going to respond to any impeachment finding of the House with some sort of vote.\n\n\u201cThey have to go on record,\u201d said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.). \u201cHistory will condemn them if they duck and run.\u201d\n\nFor now, the two parties are engaged in a sparring match, with Senate Republicans ridiculing Pelosi for allegedly putting her own majority at risk, with Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) warning \"it could backfire\u201d on Democrats.\n\nBut some Democrats say such statements smack of weakness. And they are eager to see how Republicans deal with the issue when they are forced to take a stand on the Senate floor.\n\n\u201cSenate Republicans win if they make House Democrats lose their nerve,\u201d said Adam Jentleson, a former top aide to former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.). \u201cBut all Democrats win if the House impeaches Trump over Ukraine and forces Senate Republicans to decide whether to let a criminal remain in office.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Sen.
