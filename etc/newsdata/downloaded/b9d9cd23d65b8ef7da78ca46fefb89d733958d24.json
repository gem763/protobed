Photo: Courtesy of the Retailer\n\nIf you just moved into a new apartment or recently bought a new TV, you might find yourself needing one very specific piece of furniture: a media stand. We know it might not feel strictly necessary because it\u2019s easy enough to sub in a random end table or item you already own, but a decent media stand can really make a big difference in terms of design. Plus it provides a stable base for your TV and gives you some storage space to tidy up all those cords and wires.\n\nYou generally want to look for something low to the ground so the center of the TV is comfortable within your eyeline when you\u2019re seated, and you want it to be wide enough to fully encompass the width of your TV (but this rule of thumb is more about aesthetics than structural integrity). And though there are a lot of great media stands online, we found some that are a little more interesting than that standard rectangular wood-veneer one you see everywhere. We also found a bunch of other things that would actually make great media stands even though they weren\u2019t designed with that intention. The good thing about these is they\u2019re just as functional as a traditional media stand but they free you up a bit design-wise.\n\nActual media stands\n\nStone & Beam Factory Wheel Entertainment Console, 58 Inches Wide $381 (was $395, now 4% off) Buying artisan-made furniture built from repurposed wood and hardware is great, but it\u2019s also really expensive. This gives you a similar look for a more reasonable price. Plus it seems super-sturdy and is wide enough for pretty much any TV. $381 at Amazon Buy $381 at Amazon Buy\n\nModway Low-Profile Walnut TV Stand, 46 Inches Wide $241 (was $259, now 7% off) A mid-century-modern dupe of sorts. The semi-open slatted design gives you the best of both worlds: When closed, it hides all your media components and wires, but it should be open enough not to interfere with your remote control. $241 at Amazon Buy $241 at Amazon Buy\n\nVasagle Industrial TV Stand, 40 Inches Wide The product description says this can accommodate up to 43-inch TVs, and the price is good. $100 at Amazon Buy $100 at Amazon Buy\n\nGreat Deal Furniture TV Stand, 39 Inches Wide Materials for media stands in this price range tend to be pretty limited: You\u2019re looking at metal, particleboard, plastic, or hardwood at best. This tempered-glass model is something a little different. $157 at Amazon Buy $157 at Amazon Buy\n\nOther nice-looking things that would make great media stands\n\nSONGMICS Bamboo Shoe Rack, 34-Inches Wide $47 (was $60, now 22% off) The difference between shoe racks and media stands mostly comes down to semantics. Shoe racks like this don\u2019t have a solid backing, so the wires are more exposed, but the benefit of open shelving is that it\u2019s a lot easier to access components when necessary and the overall feel is just \u201clighter\u201d in the room. We like that this one is a little asymmetrical, with the middle shelf set off to one side. It\u2019s about 34 inches wide, so it should work for any TV around 36 inches and under. And one bonus of using a shoe rack as a media stand: It\u2019s easy to repurpose for organization or, of course, as a shoe rack. $47 at Amazon Buy $47 at Amazon Buy\n\nHouseinBox 3-Door Metal Cabinet Organizer, Red, 48 Inches Wide This red metal stand looks a bit like a school locker on the outside, but it\u2019s the perfect height and size for a large TV. At 48 inches wide, it should work well for any TV screen of about 50 inches or under. With the doors closed, it has a nice clean, minimalist look. $143 at Amazon Buy $143 at Amazon Buy\n\nTribesigns Office Storage Unit With Three-Drawer Lateral File Cabinet, 39 Inches Wide This storage unit is designed to be used in an office, but it would actually make a handy media stand, especially if you\u2019re short on storage space. You could use the file-cabinet drawers to organize documents (and that TV instruction manual you\u2019ve probably never looked at) with some hanging folders. $130 at Amazon Buy $130 at Amazon Buy\n\nECR4Kids Birch Five-Section Classroom Cabinet, 48 Inches Wide $164 (was $383, now 57% off) This storage cabinet designed for children\u2019s classrooms would make for a sturdy media stand, and since it\u2019s made to endure the wear and tear of an elementary-school setting, it can probably handle some moves every few years. $164 at Amazon Buy $164 at Amazon Buy\n\nChristopher Knight Home Colonial Outdoor Acacia Wood and Metal Bench, 63-Inches Wide This simple metal-and-wood bench would make for a sturdy media stand \u2014 as many benches do. It would be an especially good choice for larger TVs because it\u2019s low to the ground, and at 63-inches wide it should be able to accommodate pretty much any reasonably sized TV. $135 at Amazon Buy $135 at Amazon Buy\n\nKate and Laurel Rustic Wood Top Bench, Teal, 40-Inches Wide If you prefer to have the paint applied in advance, this teal bench could add a little color to your media center. TVs and their assorted components tend to be black and monotonous, so a bright media stand like this helps mix things up a bit. $126 at Amazon Buy $126 at Amazon Buy\n\nAmazonia Aster Eucalyptus Patio Bench, 52 Inches Wide This patio bench is understated, sure, but it\u2019s wide and sturdy and made from eucalyptus wood. $140 at Amazon Buy $140 at Amazon Buy\n\nMountain Woods Furniture Aspen Grizzly Collection Bench, 48 Inches Wide For the large flat-screen TV that\u2019s currently sitting on the floor in your log cabin. $247 at Amazon Buy $247 at Amazon Buy\n\nHoney-Can-Do Two-Shelf Rolling Media Cart, 36 Inches Wide $52 (was $73, now 29% off) An industrial-shelving media stand is useful because you can adjust the height of the shelves, and the wheels make it easy to move. It\u2019s 36 inches wide, so it should work for a screen that\u2019s 39 inches or under, but be sure to check the measurements. $52 at Amazon Buy $52 at Amazon Buy\n\nLuxor Stainless-Steel Utility Cart, 33 Inches Wide This industrial-grade stainless-steel cart might be overkill, but if you like the look, at least you\u2019ll know it\u2019s built to last. The handles extending above the top shelf might interfere with the sides of a TV, so this would probably be better suited to holding something like a record player, speakers, or a projector. $178 at Amazon Buy $178 at Amazon Buy\n\nNorwood Commercial Adjustable-Height Metal A/V Cart, 24 Inches Wide This one may be a bit of a wild card, but we love the old-school feel of this A/V cart from school supplier Norwood Commercial. It\u2019s not superwide, so it wouldn\u2019t be the best choice for a big TV, but it would be great for a projector, and you can wheel it back and forth until you get the best picture size and focus. (The height can also be adjusted from 26 inches to 42 inches.) $192 at Amazon Buy $192 at Amazon Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
