Chrissy (pictured in September) said she resonated with the storyline\n\n'It\u2019s one of those things that of course I can relate to because I have those voids with validation from other people or with food or whatever I think is going to make me feel better,' Chrissy told the publication.\n\n'Everybody, to some degree, fills a void with something, whether it\u2019s social media, alcohol, drugs, overspending, overeating. We\u2019re either chasing a feeling or trying to get rid of a feeling.'\n\nEarlier this season, her character discovered her newborn son was blind and decided to use food to cope with the problem. This method was previously used by the character when coping with the death of her father, played by Milo Ventimiglia.\n\nBut Chrissy said handling troubles with overeating would not solve her character's personal problems, and she knew that from personal experience.\n\n'But in the long run it never does. It\u2019s just a Bandaid on a really big wound that you have to get to the bottom of, because we don\u2019t like to be uncomfortable as humans. It feels awful, and that\u2019s sort of what she\u2019s doing with her overeating,' she said.\n\nThis conversation inspired Chrissy to reflect on her personal life.\n\nShe shared: 'That\u2019s a real big challenge, and of course, I get that and I understand that personally. Of course, I bring that [into playing Kate]. I think every actor brings something personal to a role.'\n\nDifficult topic: 'That\u2019s a real big challenge, and of course, I get that and I understand that personally,' Chrissy said about Kate's character struggles\n\nPositive influence: Chrissy has previously said she doesn't want Kate's storyline to be solely focused on her weight. But she has also used her platform to help others with body postivity\n\nHaving a platform on a hit show like This Is Us has allowed Chrissy to speak on topics relating to body positivity and acceptance.\n\nFans previously have tweeted personally to the actress and commended her for the perspective she takes with Kate when acting out the character's body struggles.\n\nDuring the episode last week, one fan commended Chrissy character's courage and bravery.\n\n'Chrissy I wish I had your courage. I live the booth nightmare. There are days I have wished myself get hit by a bus rather than deal w the embarrassment horrible people have done to me over it,' the fan wrote.\n\nTo this, Chrissy responded: 'Your weight does not define you! People\u2019s perceptions are theirs. You are worthy and purposeful no matter what.'\n\nAlthough Chrissy has embraced speaking about body image with both her personal life and playing Kate, she also has voiced frustration that the character's story, as well as her own, is centered on weight.\n\n'It can be frustrating in that the weight is not all that I am or all that Kate is, but it\u2019s a really big part of who we\u2019ve allowed it to be,' she told Vanity Fair in 2017. 'And the only way to tell that story is to tell the story.'", "description": "Chrissy, 39, plays Kate Pearson on This Is Us, a character whose storyline highlights her struggles with weight and body image.
