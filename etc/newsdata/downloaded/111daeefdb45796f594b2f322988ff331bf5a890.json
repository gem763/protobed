McDonald\u2019s Singapore, Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nRemember the time when all desserts and confectionery came in two \u2013 and only two \u2013 flavours?\n\nIn the early 1990s, kids often had their confectionery choices limited to just chocolate or strawberry. These days, the world of flavours has exploded, and consumers get to choose from all sorts of flavours from sea salt caramel to bubble tea.\n\nThanks to the insane number of choices we have today, it\u2019s been awhile since I last had anything strawberry-flavoured. But today, I got my whiff of nostalgia when I visited McDonald\u2019s to try its new White Choc Strawberry Cream Pie.\n\nEating the pie, I realised that I actually do miss that milky, artificial strawberry taste we used to get with the low-cost strawberry biscuits sold at the mamak shop, which are few and far between now.\n\nThis is what eating McDonald\u2019s Singapore\u2019s new White Choc Strawberry Cream Pie was like:\n\nThe photo on the box that the pie was packed in made my mouth water with its depiction of strawberries and cream.\n\ncaption It is priced at S$1.50, and will be on sale for a limited time only. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nIts golden crust was just beautiful. How can anyone resist that?\n\ncaption Looks like any other delicious McDonald\u2019s pie at this point. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nMy first bite was all pastry. The crust seems to be different from the usual one used for the chain\u2019s classic Apple Pie, and I was quite surprised by how flaky it was.\n\nIt was also quite oily on the surface (probably from the butter), so I needed to wash my hands immediately after taking these photos.\n\ncaption Warning: This is going to be a messy experience with pie crust flaking all over the table. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nHere\u2019s what the pie looked like in the promotional photo.\n\ncaption Expectation: bursting with strawberry goodness. source McDonald\u2019s Singapore\n\nIn real life, the strawberry white chocolate cream was quite dense and heavy. The strawberry flavour (which is nothing like the sour strawberries you get in supermarkets here) was quite rich too.\n\nBut it did not turn out to be too sweet like I was afraid it would. Overall, a good balance of flavours. I found it surprisingly filling too \u2013 it left me feeling full for quite some time after.\n\ncaption Reality: Not exactly bursting at the seams, but rich and creamy as expected. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nThe best thing about the pie was that it reminded me of my childhood, because the strawberry cream tasted exactly like the ones in some of my favourite childhood snacks.\n\nIn particular, these guys here:\n\ncaption Verdict: this McDonald\u2019s pie is a grown up version of strawberry Pocky and Hello Panda. source Business Insider/Jessica Lin\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - Expectation: bursting with strawberry goodness.
