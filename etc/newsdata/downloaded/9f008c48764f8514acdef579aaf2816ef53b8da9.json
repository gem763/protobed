But few anticipated what would come next.\n\n\u201cI was talking about all the [agents] that were in the station,\u201d Meco recalled in an interview with The Independent, describing the 10 October 2015 incident.\n\nThen everything went black.\n\n\"I want to say that at this moment the electricity to our channel has been cut,\" she announced.\n\nIn the ensuing days, authorities seized the station\u2019s equipment and almost archives.\n\nIn one swoop, Albania, a western Balkan NATO member closely allied with the US, killed off for good one of the most promising media experiments in the Balkans, perhaps even in all of Europe.\n\n\u201cThe investment was 150 million euros,\u201d Becchetti tells The Independent in an interview. \u201cThey took everything.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

In addition, Albanian partners to the station were indirectly awarded roughly 30 million euros.\n\nThe decision also required that Albania pay interest on any money owed.\n\nThe case illustrates how a group of surging authoritarians in eastern and southeastern Europe is attempting to squelch press freedoms, often abusing legal tools. EU officials are beginning to take notice, voicing concern this week after Albania proposed a law to tighten controls on online media.\n\n\u201cWhile we share the Albanian authorities\u2019 concerns with regard to disinformation, the [European] Commission recommends approaches that are less severe, based on a self-regulation approach,\u201d EU ambassador Luigi Soreca said cautioned this week.\n\nThe Albanian government contends that seizing the station was a legitimate use of executive and police powers in accord with Albanian law. The Independent sought comment from Albanian officials and the law firms that represented the country in the arbitration matter, but received no substantive reply by publication. One UK law firm representing Albania said its barristers were \u201call just too thinly spread with client work\u201d to comment.\n\nOf the tens of millions of euros Albania was ordered to pay, it has so far yet to pay a penny.\n\nIt was with high hopes that Becchetti and his business partners, who had entered the country as investors in the hydro-electric industry during the 1990s as it emerged from one of the most repressive Communist dictatorships in Europe. He first launched the free daily newspaper AgonFree in 2006, applying to turn it into a satellite TV station in 2013.\n\nIt expanded rapidly, launching 24-hour broadcasts the next year, and starting an Italian-language sister channel in 2015.\n\n\u201cWe were fiercely independent and unafraid of criticising the ruling parties,\u201d says Becchetti, best known in the UK as owner of the football club Leyton Orient for several unhappy years \u2013 the club was relegated and racked up over \u00a35m in debts during his tenure.\n\nBecchetti hoped to build on his investment in Albania, using low production costs to launch Italian broadcasts and perhaps eventually English- and other-language channels.\n\nJournalists like Meco who worked at the channel describe it as a haven for professionals. It used up-to-date HD quality broadcast technology. Some 500 employees were housed in an office just outside the centre of Tirana.\n\nThe station employed top-notch editors and producers, paying salaries three or four times what other Albanian journalists were making.\n\n\u201cI understood this as an example of globalised European television,\u201d says Becchetti. \u201cThen we [would] go to France, Germany, UK. That was our goal.\u201d\n\nBut troubles between Rama\u2019s government and the station began immediately. In one incident, Erion Veliaj \u2013 a Rama ally who is now mayor of Tirana \u2013 was upset that Agon covered his fancy September 2014 wedding.\n\n\u201cI don't understand why are you doing this to me,\u201d he wrote in a letter. \u201cYou are forcing me to be your enemy! The entire government is going to be [Becchetti\u2019s] enemy for no reason.\u201d\n\nThe battle between the station and the government escalated, perhaps exacerbated by tensions between Albania and Becchetti over his energy-sector investments.\n\nAgon reported what it described as widespread allegations of electoral fraud in 2015 municipal elections that saw victories for Rama and his party.\n\nMeanwhile, Albanian prosecutors formally charged Becchetti and his partner Mauro De Renzis with forgery, money laundering and tax evasion, and launched legal manouevres to take control of Agon.\n\nRama railed against the channel in television interviews describing it as a \u201cscandalous phenomenon against which we have declared war,\u201d and accusing it of being funded by \u201cdirty money.\u201d\n\nAgon continued to broadcast, though its employees couldn\u2019t get paid. Attempts to wire them money from Italy were blocked by Albanian banks. The government upped the pressure: Agon\u2019s journalists, editors, analysts, cameramen and even hair stylists were stopped at Albania\u2019s borders and forbidden to travel abroad.\n\nCourt orders were drawn up to seize the channel, but few believed a government aspiring to join the European Union would take so drastic a move.\n\n\u201cI was shocked,\u201d says Meco, now 42 and still working as a journalist in Albania, and who still hasn\u2019t gotten over the government-backed seizure of Agon. \u201cI didn\u2019t think things would come to this end.\u201d\n\nFor three years Meco struggled to find work as a journalist, before eventually landing a job at another channel. But she continues to long for the stature and resources of Agon.\n\n\u201cIt was a channel where as a journalist you could exercise liberty and freedom of information,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is very important not only for me, but Albania also had this great opportunity to be represented in the world with such a project. Everything after is like being downgraded. Nothing is like what we had.\u201d\n\nThe arbitration panel found the accusations of money laundering and tax evasion against Becchetti unfounded.\n\nHe suspects that the Albanian campaign against him was rooted in his energy dealings as well as the content of Agon TV, with powerful competitors in Italy and Albania egging on Rama.\n\nWestern governments have repeatedly refused to honour repeated Interpol red notices that Albania issued against Becchetti and his partners, and Albania has quietly withdrawn the requests.\n\nRama, asked earlier this year about the case, refused to disclose details about the case or comment on the ruling, citing a confidentiality agreement. The case has cost the impoverished country millions of euros in legal fees.\n\nBecchetti now spends much of his time overseeing his various legal battles with Albania, but is also attempting to start an investment fund for entrepreneurs pursuing international ventures. He says is also writing a screenplay about his Albania misadventures.\n\nThe battle for Agon TV has cost him four years of his life, but he says the real loss is what Albania could have become.\n\nSince shutting down Agon, Albania has increased attempts to impose restrictions and pressure on the press. Since last year, it has fallen from 75th to 82nd in the Reporters Sans Frontier ranking of country\u2019s media freedom.\n\nRama is said to repeatedly refer to Albanian journalists as \u201ctrash bins\u201d - though he promised a group of international media freedom advocates he met in Tirana in June that he would refrain from continuing to use the smear.\n\nOver the summer, Adi Krasta and Ylli Rakipi \u2013 both journalists who are critical of Rama and his protege Veliaj \u2013 were fired from talk shows on the Albanian News24 TV channel, under alleged government pressure.\n\n\u201cAfter the fall of the communist regime, Albania started to build up its democracy from scratch and thanks to the hard work of the Albanian people, aided by international investors like myself \u2026 the country broke through the inertia of its past and had made great strides forward,\u201d says Becchetti.\n\n\u201cBut the Rama government then put in place a series of actions against the freedom of people, including the closure of Agon channel and the attempt to arrest me, which was a huge step backwards,\u201d he says.", "description": "On air for her regular morning news show, Sonila Meco was forced to begin narrating for the audience what was unfolding before her - government agents swarming the station, knocking over equipment in their search through files.\u00a0 They claimed they were from Albania\u2019s state-owned energy company and wanted to talk with the managers of the station.
