Maguire has refused to release details of a whistleblower\u2019s complaint said to relate to a phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy, despite intensifying calls from Democrats and even some Republicans.\n\nHow did this begin?\n\nA whistleblower, working in US intelligence, filed a formal complaint in August. The unnamed whistleblower is said to have seen or heard something that raised \u201curgent concern\u201d.\n\nReporting has since revealed that the complaint was based on a series of events, including a 25 July call between Trump and Zelenskiy. Complaints of this nature are usually reported to Congress within seven days. Maguire, who was appointed by Trump, has refused to do so.\n\nWhat happened on the call?\n\nNumerous news outlets have reported that Trump pressured Zelenskiy to investigate Joe Biden\u2019s son, Hunter Biden, who served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump asked Zelenskiy eight times to investigate Hunter Biden.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump confirmed he discussed the Bidens with Zelenskiy, and accused the pair \u2013 without offering any evidence \u2013 of corruption.\n\n\u201cThe conversation I had was largely congratulatory, was largely corruption, all of the corruption taking place,\u201d he said. \u201cWas largely the fact that we don\u2019t want our people, like Vice-President Biden and his son, [contributing] to the corruption already in the Ukraine.\u201d\n\nWhy is Ukraine involved?\n\nThere is no evidence of any wrongdoing by Joe Biden or Hunter Biden. The allegations relate to Biden Jr\u2019s time on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, which was owned by a businessman who was being investigated by Ukraine\u2019s top prosecutor.\n\nIn 2016 the US and a number of other western countries pressured Ukraine to remove the prosecutor. Biden was vice-president at the time.\n\nTrump\u2019s push for the Bidens to be investigated relates to the prosecutor\u2019s removal. Trump\u2019s assertions appear to be politically motivated. Joe Biden is favorite to win the Democratic nomination for president and polls show him beating Trump comfortably.\n\nWhy is this so serious?\n\nIt is illegal for a political campaign to accept a \u201cthing of value\u201d from a foreign government. Democrats say an investigation into a political opponent \u2013 for which Trump appears to have been pushing \u2013 would amount to a thing of value.\n\nIt has also been suggested that Trump may have threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine. About a month after the call, the US delayed $250m in such assistance. The money was released this month, after the existence of the whistleblower complaint became public.\n\nOn Monday, at the United Nations in New York, Trump said of the call: \u201cIt\u2019s very important to talk about corruption. If you don\u2019t talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt? \u2026 It\u2019s very important that on occasion you speak to somebody about corruption.\u201d\n\nTrump also continued to seek to cast doubt on the whistleblower\u2019s motivations, tweeting: \u201cWho is this so-called \u2018whistleblower\u2019 who doesn\u2019t know the correct facts. Is he on our Country\u2019s side. Where does he come from?\u201d\n\nWill the Trump-Zelenskiy transcript be released?\n\nDemocrats and some Republicans have called for this to happen and it was reported on Monday that the White House is seriously considering doing so.\n\nCabinet members Steven Mnuchin and Mike Pompeo, and White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, have said releasing the transcript would set a damaging precedent, given the need for leaders to speak frankly in such calls.\n\nWhite House advisers are also reportedly worried that releasing the transcript would lead to calls for transcripts of conversations between Trump and other leaders \u2013 most notably Vladimir Putin \u2013 to be made public too.\n\nWhat are Democrats saying?\n\nOn Monday Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, wrote to the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, asking him to help obtain the whistleblower report and investigate why military aid was withheld. It seems unlikely McConnell will help him out.\n\nThe House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has said that if reports about the complaint bear out, Trump will face \u201cserious repercussions\u201d and the nation will have \u201cgrave, urgent concerns for our national security\u201d.\n\nPelosi has resisted pressure from the Democratic rank-and-file to impeach Trump over his links to Russia. The Ukraine revelations have only intensified calls for impeachment. On Sunday Adam Schiff, the Democratic chair of the House intelligence committee, told CNN \u201cwe may have crossed the Rubicon\u201d.", "description": "Reports that Trump urged a foreign leader to investigate Joe Biden have rocked Washington and intensified calls for impeachment", "authors": ["Adam Gabbatt"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f936bad0e3e294b116db35b931160930a406f274/0_241_3114_1869/master/3114.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=46fdc97b703a23b123c555f8ba15bcd5", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
