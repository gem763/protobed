Labour has finally managed to agree to offer another referendum if it wins, which will mortify some voters, though attract others.\n\nSecond thoughts on Brexit might see traditional concerns like health and public services resurface as voter priorities, as they did in the 2017 election. There are some extreme characters campaigning too, with much potential for fatal gaffes. And Parliament itself is on trial. Mr Johnson says that Parliament has held the country hostage. Others say Parliament has just done its job in questioning the result of an ill-conceived plebiscite that clashes for legitimacy with Britain\u2019s sovereign parliamentary system.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Opposition Leader Jeremy Corbyn. Getty\n\nThe jury is still out on the economic stakes, and the real worth of the Brexit exercise. Many of the promises of the Brexiteers have been a mirage. But former Bank of England governor Mervyn King has said it will be neither the end of the world, nor the promised land. His successor Mark Carney says the British economy is flexible enough to adapt to being outside the EU.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just economics, however. The British launched the first Industrial Revolution, and they were Karl Marx\u2019s classic proletariat and bourgeoisie. But as Australian Labor MP Clare O\u2019Neil says today in The Australian Financial Review, the Venn diagram of politics is shifting far beyond the old economic left and right. There are now many political identities.\n\nEven while the Conservatives have self-destructed in full view of the world for three years, Jeremy Corbyn has looked worse.\n\nIn the age of globalisation, it is the revolt of the localised, cultural \u201csomewheres\u201d that has such force. That is what has made Brexit cut across normal economic self-interest to more visceral belief in taking back national control. It\u2019s echoed by Donald Trump, or even Prime Minister Scott Morrison\u2019s pushback at the \u201cunaccountable internationalist bureaucracy\u201d of the United Nations.\n\nBy contrast Mr Corbyn\u2019s promises of worker control at companies, or squeezing the rich, could be obscured by the culture war that middle-class \u201canywhere\u201d lefties have waged on the working class and poor white sensibilities for decades. Centre-left parties from western Sydney to West Virginia are struggling to understand this rift.\n\nThe bookies give equal odds to Conservative or Labour minority government in December. Thankfully they judge a Conservative majority vastly more likely than a Labour one - and a solid win for Mr Johnson is the only resolution.\n\nAnother referendum, after the 52-48 result delivered by the half-baked plebiscite of 2016, would only ensure that another contested result raged on. That would weaken the UK and the European Union too, neither of which is in the interest of Australia and the wider West.", "description": "Brexit revealed a culture war in British politics.
