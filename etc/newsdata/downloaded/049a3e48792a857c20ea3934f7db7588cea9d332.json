The face of the NBA has been careful not to upset the Chinese - going so far as to call out Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey for the timing of his pro-Hong Kong protesters tweet days before the Lakers and Brooklyn Nets traveled to China for two preseason games. James also said earlier this week that \"we do have freedom of speech, but there can be a lot of negative things that come with that too,\" and \u201cI also don\u2019t think every issue should be everybody\u2019s problem.\"\n\nSome sales figures help shed light on why James might have said what he did and took criticism for it.\n\nHow much is James\u2019 deal with Nike worth? He makes $32 million annually from Nike, according to Forbes, and Nike\u2019s revenue in China surpassed $6 billion from June 1, 2018 to May 31, 2019, according to statista.com.\n\nOf course, James isn't the only NBA player who benefits from apparel sales in China. Stephen Curry has a deal with Under Armour and James Harden has one with Adidas, for example.\n\nThe Chinese shoe market is hot. Nike's revenue from shoe sales in China has doubled in the past five years while Nike shoe sales in the U.S. has remained flat the past four years. While Nike's annual revenue in the U.S. is considerably higher than in China, the growth area is in China.\n\nJames also has a lifetime deal with Nike that could exceed $1 billion according to hints from James\u2019 business partner Maverick Carter.\n\nChina is good to James, and that\u2019s one reason he came off looking like an apologist for an authoritarian regime that does not value human rights or freedom of speech.\n\nJames came off quite clear that profit outweighs all else. Will his comments hurt his image in North America?\n\n\u201cIt makes him look like a hypocrite to some people,\u201d David E. Johnson, CEO of Strategic Vision PR Group, said. \u201cBut as far as advertisers and companies like Nike, it\u2019s not really going to have a long-term consequences because people aren\u2019t buying shoes or other product he endorses because of his stand on China, on a police shooting. They\u2019re buying it based on his performance playing basketball.\u201d\n\nJohnson said for James to take a hit financially it would have to be something China does such as suspending a partnership with Nike.\n\nMark Francis, a sports business lecturer at UCLA, said there are implications for marketing and branding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big risk to take sides on things,\" Francis said. \"People have always been critical of Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan for never taking a side on basically anything. It sends that message that they\u2019re protecting their brand. But when we get a guy like LeBron who speaks on social issues and tries to use his platform for social good, there\u2019s a risk for backlash. He\u2019s almost in a no-win situation.\n\n\"That\u2019s why I\u2019m surprised he went public with it on his thoughts on Daryl Morey. When you take that side, you lose the other side. Even though I didn\u2019t read LeBron\u2019s comments as being in support of China, people have taken that interpretation.\"\n\nWill this hurt James both in domestic earnings and popularity? Francis predicted James will bounce back quickly.\n\n\u201cIn a month or two months from now, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll hear much more about this. The 24/7 news cycle spins pretty fast,\u201d Francis said. \u201cI salute him for having the courage to speak out. At the same time, perhaps he regrets going public with it. But this will pass.\u201d\n\nStory continues below video\n\n'It furthers his brand power in China'\n\nThe Lakers\u2019 star brands himself as \u201cmore than an athlete.\u201d\n\nYet, James remained quiet on the China topic until Monday. Once he returned from their week-long preseason trip in China, James had plenty to say. By Tuesday, he said he wouldn't speak on the topic again.\n\nHe did not share support for the Hong Kong protesters, or question China\u2019s human-rights record. Instead, James directed his frustration toward Morey, saying Morey was \u201cmisinformed\u201d for not anticipating how tweeting out support for the Hong Kong protesters could affect the NBA and its players\u2019 earnings in China.\n\n\u201cIt furthers his brand power in China,\" Eric Schiffer, a chairman of Reputation Management Consultants, said. \"They will look at it as a full-throated support of the Chinese approach to Hong Kong. In the United States, though, we are seeing the fallout from many who now look at LeBron as a card- holding member of the Communist party.\n\n\u201cThat is ludicrous, though, because LeBron was just trying to be careful not to alienate. The bigger issue for LeBron, though, is it overshadows all the great work that he does.\u201d\n\nIt also overshadows that there are those within the NBA who share James\u2019 sentiments. The Lakers also traveled to China in 2013 and remain interested in being among the teams to make future visits. As much as he has spoken out on Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric and mass violence, both Warriors coach Steve Kerr and James have argued it is not as appropriate to comment on foreign affairs as it is on domestic issues because of their relative ignorance on foreign affairs.\n\nStill, the NBA had held out hope that tensions would thaw after the Lakers and Nets returned. It still remains optimistic it will maintain its partnership with China that started nearly 30 years ago and has continued with preseason games since 2004.\n\nThose tensions re-emerged with James\u2019 comments.\n\n\u201cHe could\u2019ve approached it with more sensitivity to the geopolitics and to the larger issue in play,\u201d Schiffer said. \u201cUnderstandably, he also felt pressure given where his paycheck was coming from and the fact that the NBA was not wanting to upset the Chinese government. I think people are upset because he chose money over what they see as a lack of supporting democracy in Hong Kong. It\u2019s that inconsistency that is affecting his brand today.\u201d\n\nOPINION: James' most disgraceful career moment\n\nOPINION:LeBron's stance on China weakens his voice\n\nJAMES SPEAKS:LeBron says Morey 'misinformed'\n\nWAR OF WORDS: Are LeBron, NBA right to bow to China?\n\n'NBA players have learned cost of speaking out'\n\nBill Bishop lived in China for more than a decade and his reporting and commentary on the country has made him an authority on Chinese affairs. He runs the popular newsletter Sincocism.com focused on China affairs and tries to provide a nuanced viewpoint to complicated topics such as foreign policy and trade.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t want to come off as an apologist for James or other NBA players, but he acknowledged \u201cit\u2019s an awful situation for players.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople say they\u2019re a bunch of hypocrites because they (won't) talk about China,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cLook, it\u2019d be great if they could talk injustices everywhere, but at the end of the day, they are human and we have to really wonder is it fair to expect them to sacrifice their careers and the earnings of their friends, teammates and other players.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the genius \u2013 and I don\u2019t mean this in a positive way \u2013 of how the communist party has set up this global censorship mechanism. NBA players have learned the cost of speaking out (about China).\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong. I would love to see a situation where LeBron comes out and defends human rights and defends free speech and mentions the plight of the Uyghurs in western China. My point is not to say LeBron is fine what he said, but is that a fair expectation? These are individuals who have a lot of money on the line, and you have major corporations with billions of dollars of revenue assets who are unwilling to take a stand.\u201d\n\nFollow Jeff Zillgitt on Twitter @JeffZillgitt and Mark Medina @MarkG_Medina", "description": "How much is LeBron James\u2019 deal with Nike worth?
