The conflict has had a chilling effect across the world, taking Germany and Britain closer to recession.\n\nMeanwhile, diesel cars are losing popularity in the UK and Europe more generally, hitting overall sales.\n\nMr Hawes said this meant that \u201cmaintaining the UK\u2019s global competitiveness has never been more important\u201d.\n\n\u201cSo we need a Brexit deal \u2013 and quickly \u2013 to unlock investment and safeguard the long-term future of a sector which has recently been such an international success story,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite extensive preparations, a no-deal Brexit would wreak havoc with the \u201cjust-in-time\u201d supply chains across the English Channel that the industry relies on. Combined with tariffs on exports to the EU, no deal would threaten the very viability of the UK\u2019s greatest single foreign currency-earning sector and source of 168,000 jobs, Mr Hawes said in July.\n\nChances of Britain crashing out of the EU on 31 October have risen since it was announced that parliament will be suspended for more than a month in the run-up to the date. The move dramatically reduces the time available to MPs to attempt to pass legislation to block a no-deal Brexit.", "description": "UK car production declined for the 14th consecutive month in July, slumping by 10.6 per cent from a year ago, as key markets in the EU and Asia remained weak, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).
