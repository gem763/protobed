His body is to be transferred to Mecca, awaiting the family\u2019s decision on burial arrangements, according to his lawyer, Mounir Ben Salha.\n\nZine al-Abidine Ben Ali obituary Read more\n\nA Tunisian court sentenced Ben Ali in absentia in 2011 to fines and time in prison on charges including misappropriating public funds and ordering the torture of army officers accused of launching a coup attempt against him.\n\nThe following year, he was sentenced in absentia to life in jail for his role in the deaths of protesters during the Jasmine revolution that ousted him. The uprising inspired what became known as the Arab spring, a movement that swept many autocratic leaders from power.\n\nAmid the upheaval of snap presidential elections, which took place at the weekend, some Tunisians have expressed a nostalgia for the Ben Ali era \u2013 if not for the man himself, whose death was announced on the website of Tunisia\u2019s La Presse with the simple headline: \u201cBen Ali is dead.\u201d\n\nAppointed prime minister in October 1987, Ben Ali assumed the presidency later that year in a bloodless coup against Habib Bourguiba, the ageing founding father of Tunisian independence from French colonial rule.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The former Tunisian president Habib Bourguiba, right, greets Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, left, in January 1986.

As president, his image was plastered for decades on billboards and buildings across the country, his face remaining strangely ageless despite the passage of time, his hair still jet-black. It seemed that only death would end his grip on power.\n\nBut as revolt swept the country in late 2010 and early 2011, fuelled by anger over corruption, repression and unemployment, demonstrators set fire to his photo \u2013 once an unthinkable act. After he was ousted from power on 14 January 2011 his picture was peeled off buildings and billboards nationwide.\n\nBen Ali was born in the coastal town of Hammam-Sousse in 1936, eventually becoming Bourguiba\u2019s chief of military security and a close aide.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters demonstrate against Ben Ali in Tunis on 14 January 2011.

Now a general, he was made interior minister in 1986, charged with countering the perceived threat from the country\u2019s Islamist movement, and then prime minister in 1987.\n\nAfter that it took him less than three weeks to arrange a promotion to the top job, bringing in a team of doctors to declare Bourguiba senile, meaning he would automatically take over as head of state. \u201cI needed to re-establish the rule of law,\u201d Ben Ali told a French television channel in 1988. \u201cThe president was ill and his inner circle was harmful.\u201d\n\nHis first decade as president involved a big economic restructuring \u2013 backed by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank \u2013 and an annual growth rate slightly over 4% a year.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ben Ali and his wife, Leila Trabelsi, voting in Tunis in October 2004.

What that meant, in effect, was harsh restrictions on dissent and freedom of expression, a state-dominated media and violent suppression of the country\u2019s Islamist movements.\n\nBut in the midst of widespread rural and urban poverty, a stagnating economy and the realisation that Ben Ali and his second wife, Leila Trabelsi, had vastly enriched themselves and their cronies at the expense of the country, Tunisians finally turned against him.\n\nThe moment in December 2010 when the desperate vegetable seller Mohammed Bouazizi set himself alight in the impoverished town of Sidi Bouzid after police confiscated his barrow became the trigger for revolution.\n\nBouazizi\u2019s funeral was attended by tens of thousands of people, prompting weeks of protests in which scores of people were killed.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, who fled in 2011, dies days after free presidential election in Tunisia", "authors": ["Peter Beaumont"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0436aaf00dfb9dc3d1590d4e27e037f8efd3b5e/0_84_4697_2818/master/4697.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=c259a4f1353f181d6a82a015e66f3949", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
