[The orgasm was] much less pleasurable. More like relief than pleasure.'\n\nResearchers suggested men can put pressure on women to orgasm because they see their partner's climax as a masculinity achievement (stock image)\n\nMs Chadwick and Professor van Anders's previous work suggested men may put pressure on women to orgasm because they see their partner's climax as a masculinity achievement.\n\nThey added: 'It is okay to have mixed or even entirely negative feelings about a sexual encounter where you had an orgasm.'\n\nThe study using information gathered online through a survey was published online in the Archives of Sexual Behavior.\n\nThe researchers concluded that orgasms do not always equate to pleasure and said people should not assume their partner has enjoyed the sex just because they orgasm.\n\nThey also wanted people who have had orgasms during unwanted or undesirable encounters to known 'their orgasm does not mean they liked it or secretly 'wanted' what was happening'.\n\nThe researchers now say they are looking into how these experiences affected their sexuality, relationships and psychological health.\n\nResearchers detailed that for 'good orgasms' people should listen to their partner's needs that they may communicate non-verbally.\n\nThey added: 'Pushing someone to have sex or continue sex until orgasm when they do not want to be having sex can make your partner feel coerced, ignored, and/or generally negative about the encounter, even if they end up having an orgasm.'", "description": "Researchers from the US and Canada questioned 726 people about their sexual experiences and found there is such a thing as a 'bad orgasm' and there are various reasons people may not enjoy one.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/15/19592562-0-image-a-48_1570803511049.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
