He impressed in last year\u2019s Europa League, and combines unpredictability in 1-v-1 situations with a useful end product to make him a daunting prospect to face. Getty Images 3/23 Renan Lodi, Atletico Madrid Replacing Filipe Luis at Atletico Madrid will be a tough task for Renan Lodi, but the Brazilian is Atletico\u2019s only natural left-back and will therefore be integral for Diego Simeone this season. Lodi is a typical marauding Brazilian full-back, and is a keen crosser of the ball which suits Atletico\u2019s style of play. Getty Images 4/23 Eljif Elmas, Napoli The Macedonian is an eager midfielder, to say the least. Elmas distributes the ball well and is usually on the move shortly after, and has displayed a keen appetite for winning the ball back. Signed from Fenerbahce this summer, he has impressed in his short time with Napoli as a player who is always happy to take possession of the ball. Getty Images 5/23 Colin Dagba, PSG PSG are not typically associated with blooding through their own young talent, with many academy prospects often being sold rather than nurtured. Dagba has escaped such a fate, and established himself as first-choice right-back under Thomas Tuchel, keeping three clean sheets in his three starts this season. AFP/Getty Images 6/23 Matthijs de Ligt, Juventus The Dutchman already seems like a generational talent and was immense in Ajax\u2019s run to the semi-finals last year. He will be under a microscope at Juventus, especially with Giorgio Chiellini injured, but has already shown incredible leadership qualities and the ability to bounce back from a rocky debut as he did with the Netherlands. Getty Images 7/23 Ferran Torres, Valencia Valencia\u2019s young winger is a first-team regular, despite being just 19. The Spaniard operates predominantly from the right-hand side of midfield as an old-school type of winger - stay wide, beat a man, cross the ball - but is also comfortable taking up positions across the attacking third. Getty Images 8/23 Lee Kang-in, Valencia To say that the South Korean midfielder has flair would be an understatement. The 18-year-old has been linked with Real Madrid and Manchester City and it is clear why. He has bags of natural ability and is more than capable of playing himself out of a tight spot anywhere on the pitch. The Valencia man also possesses great technique with his left foot, and has featured regularly in their matchday squads this season. Bongarts/Getty Images 9/23 Trent Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool The Englishman\u2019s technical abilities are virtually unparalleled as a full-back, and many argue that he is already the best right-back in the world. In order to ratify such claims, Alexander-Arnold will have to help improve Liverpool\u2019s group stage away record from last year when they lost against PSG, Napoli and Red Star Belgrade, only just qualifying. Liverpool FC via Getty Images 10/23 Vinicius Jr, Real Madrid With Real Madrid\u2019s relatively small and injury hit squad, there is an expectation that Vinicius Jr will get chances to impress, particularly in games against Club Brugge and Galatasaray. The Brazilian has bags of flair and ability, but does need to work on his goal output before he can be considered as a more than a prospect. Getty Images 11/23 Victor Osimhen, Lille The Nigerian striker was signed with some of the fee Lille received for Nicholas Pepe, and looks to be a good investment with five goals in as many games in Ligue 1. Osimhen has shown he can handle the pressure of filling another\u2019s shoes, and will be seeking to impress as Lille\u2019s main man. AFP/Getty Images 12/23 Lisandro Martinez, Ajax One of two defenders signed to replace Matthijs de Ligt, Lisandro Martinez has hit the ground running at Ajax, who themselves will be looking to take advantage of a group without a clear favourite (Chelsea, Valencia, Lille). Martinez\u2019s efforts from the back are sure to be crucial in any Champions League success they have. Getty Images 13/23 Florentino Luis, Benfica Benfica are synonymous with producing talented players, and Florentino Luis appears to be the latest prospect from Lisbon. The midfielder reads the game exceptionally well, and it is not uncommon to see him slide in to intercept a pass. He is a deft tackler, but is not without technique and is more than capable of playing around a pressing opponent AFP/Getty Images 14/23 Reece James, Chelsea After a very successful campaign with Wigan, the Chelsea full-back\u2019s stock seems to have risen substantially this season, despite not playing a game due to injury. Cesar Azpilicueta has not played well and has looked like a player who has played 205 games in four seasons, with James likely to be given minutes in the Champions League in order to give the club captain a much-needed rest. AFP/Getty Images 15/23 Houssem Aouar, Lyon Aouar has a wonderful ability of carrying the ball into the final third, and is also capable of operating in tight spaces in and around the box. The composed midfielder has established himself as one of Lyon\u2019s most important players in recent years, and is another who may move on next season. AFP/Getty Images 16/23 Ibrahima Konate, RB Leipzig The French defender is a towering presence at the heart of the Leipzig defence. With the German club handed a group they should back themselves to qualify from (Lyon, Zenit and Benfica), it is likely we will see Konate test himself in the latter stages of the competition as well. Bongarts/Getty Images 17/23 Ansu Fati, Barcelona Given his performances thus far for Barcelona, it seems inconceivable that Ansu Fati is just 16. The Barcelona shirt does not seem to weigh him down at all - he plays with a freedom and unpredictability that is extremely refreshing and is sure to get him further opportunities to impress this season. Getty Images 18/23 Tete, Shakhtar Donetsk The latest in Shakhtar\u2019s production line of young Brazilians, Tete joined the club from Gremio in February. The skillful winger has impressed in his short time at the club, and is capable of causing real problems from the right-hand side. AFP/Getty Images 19/23 Kai Havertz, Bayer Leverkusen Although he is only 20, Havertz has made over 100 appearances for Bayer Leverkusen. Last season in the Bundesliga he established himself as a goal-scoring midfielder, scoring 17 times. This season\u2019s Champions League campaign is the chance for Havertz to further showcase his ability to Europe\u2019s elite - with the expectation that he will leave Leverkusen at the end of this season. Bongarts/Getty Images 20/23 Mason Mount, Chelsea It is a rarity to see players transition from the Championship to the Premier League so easily, but Mount has taken to the Chelsea first team like a duck to water. The Englishman\u2019s game intelligence is astounding at such a young age, and will suit the demands of Champions League football. AFP/Getty Images 21/23 Dani Olmo, Dinamo Zagreb Dani Olmo starred for Spain at the under 21 Euros during the summer, and surprisingly was not snapped up from Dinamo Zagreb. He moved to Croatia from Barcelona\u2019s La Masia academy back in 2014 and has not looked back, winning the league\u2019s player of the year last season. The attacking midfielder will have plenty of opportunities to impress and potentially qualify, with Zagreb fighting Atalanta and Shakhtar Donetsk for second place behind Manchester City. Getty Images 22/23 Jadon Sancho, Borussia Dortmund Sancho\u2019s talents are well-established but he should not be satisfied with just being a recognised player. This season\u2019s Champions League, when Dortmund face Barcelona and Inter Milan, is the perfect stage for him to show he can cope with the pressure of expectation and be talked about in the elite bracket of players by leading by example. Bongarts/Getty Images 23/23 Joao Felix, Atletico Madrid At the age of just 19, Joao Felix has the weighty expectations of Atletico Madrid fans upon his shoulders. His abilities with the ball are immense, but is another who will be looking to prove that they can make the step up and perform under intense scrutiny. Getty Images 1/23 22 under 22: The young players who could light up this year's Champions League Getty Images 2/23 Callum Hudson-Odoi, Chelsea Though Chelsea have plenty of options in wide areas, there will be pressure from Blues fans on Frank Lampard, as there was on Maurizio Sarri, to play Hudson-Odoi consistently.
