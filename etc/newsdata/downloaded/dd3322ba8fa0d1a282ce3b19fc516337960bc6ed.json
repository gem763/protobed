He argued in Thursday\u2019s speech that Facebook should be viewed as a tool for democracy, providing everyone an ability \u201cto share their perspectives\u201d and contribute to a more \u201cinclusive society.\u201d He gave nonpolitical examples of people using the site to foster community, such as a church group that used Facebook to coordinate hurricane relief.\n\n\u201cPeople having the power to express themselves at scale is a new kind of force in the world \u2014 a Fifth Estate alongside the other power structures of society,\u201d Zuckerberg said, lauding Facebook as a democratic institution akin to the free press and the three branches of government.\n\nTo make his point, Zuckerberg invoked the censorship tactics used by authoritarian countries such as China. He also mentioned civil rights icons Frederick Douglass and Martin Luther King, Jr., whose free expression fueled important social movements,\n\nKing\u2019s daughter responded disparagingly to the comparison.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to help Facebook better understand the challenges #MLK faced from disinformation campaigns launched by politicians,\u201d Bernice King wrote on Twitter. \u201cThese campaigns created an atmosphere for his assassination.\u201d\n\nFacebook provoked sharp condemnation last month when it announced a new policy: The site would not police political ads or politicians\u2019 speech, even if it contained lies and falsehoods. The company refused to remove a video from President Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign that claims former Vice President Joe Biden \u201cpromised Ukraine $1 billion if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son\u2019s company,\u201d a line prefaced by a directive: \u201cLEARN THE TRUTH.\u201d\n\nCritics say Facebook\u2019s policy will only fuel the spread of misinformation, leading to potentially dangerous consequences for American democracy. To illustrate how the company\u2019s policy encourages lies, Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) ran a Facebook ad falsely claiming that Zuckerberg had endorsed Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nZuckerberg addressed the threat of misinformation at Georgetown, saying that his company focuses on \u201cmaking sure complete hoaxes don\u2019t go viral.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe especially focus on misinformation that could lead to imminent physical harm, like misleading health advice saying if you\u2019re having a stroke, no need to go to the hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cMore broadly, though, we\u2019ve found a different strategy works best: focusing on the authenticity of the speaker rather than the content itself.\u201d\n\nInvestigations into the extent of Russia\u2019s disinformation campaign against the U.S. led Facebook to promote more transparency, implementing rules so people could better understand exactly who posts things they see on the site.\n\nBut Zuckerberg has indicated his company will not shoulder the responsibility of moderating content for potentially harmful lies.\n\n\u201cI know many people disagree, but, in general, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy,\u201d he said.", "description": "The Iraq War was famously based on a false claim.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da8ce76210000461334a493.jpeg?cache=gxetn7rkx0&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
