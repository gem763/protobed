If the two sensors give different readings, the pilots will be alerted to the fact and if they vary too much MCAS will simply be switched off.\n\nThere will be other safeguards, too - ensuring that the system can always be counteracted by the flight crew, and preventing it from deploying multiple times \u201cin non-normal conditions\u201d.\n\nAt a congressional hearing on 15 May, the FAA\u2019s acting administrator Daniel Elwell said he expected to receive details of the update from Boeing \u201cin the next week or so\u201d.\n\nIt would, he said, be subject to a \u201cthorough and rigorous safety analysis\u201d. The aircraft would not be allowed to fly in the US until it was \u201cabsolutely safe to do so\u201d.\n\nIt is still far from clear when this will happen. Safety agencies from around the world are due to meet in Washington on 22 May to discuss the FAA\u2019s latest safety analysis.\n\nMeanwhile, winning back the confidence of passengers may not be easy, but aviation historian Shea Oakley believes the aircraft can still be a success, once it has been allowed back in the sky.\n\n\u201cThere have been a number of commercial airliners that suffered fatal crashes early on, that were linked to either design or pilot training issues,\u201d he says.\n\nHe points out that aircraft such as the Boeing 727, the BAC 1-11 and McDonnell Douglas DC10 were involved in major accidents soon after being launched, remained on sale for decades afterwards.\n\nBoeing\u2019s chief executive Muilenburg has pledged that once MCAS has been modified, the 737 Max will be one of the safest aircraft ever built.\n\nBoeing still has more than 4,500 orders for the Max, and airlines want their new planes. Those efficiency improvements are still badly needed, and Airbus alone cannot hope to meet demand.\n\nProduction continues and the chances are most of those outstanding orders will be fulfilled.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean Boeing can simply get the aircraft flying and act as though nothing has happened.\n\nThe two accidents claimed the lives of 346 people. Formal investigations are ongoing, and more information may yet emerge. Relatives of the victims are demanding answers. There is a great deal of anger - and lawsuits are mounting up.\n\nThe US Department of Transportation is looking into the certification process for the 737 Max, and the Department of Justice is also taking an interest. It\u2019s far from clear where these inquiries will lead, and what the outcome could mean for the company or its senior executives.\n\nNor should we forget the impact these accidents will have had on Boeing\u2019s own employees. They were clearly proud of their new creation. They certainly did not intend to make a product that was in any way unsafe. Now, people within the aerospace giant say they feel \u201cshattered\u201d by what has happened.\n\nNevertheless, Boeing will almost certainly recover in the end. And despite the two tragedies, it is highly likely the 737 Max itself will be flying for years or even decades to come.", "description": "The full story as pressure mounts on Boeing and the FAA.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://news.files.bbci.co.uk/vj/live/idt-images/shorthand-boeing/FB-GettyImages-500436702_1nmxr.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
