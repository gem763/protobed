The youngest was reportedly just one year old.\n\nOne-year-old Ariel Wall, her brother Daemeon Wall and cousin Rose Alwood, both aged two; Ariel and Daemeon's father, Jason Wall, 34, and the children's maternal great-grandmother, Kathryn Murray, 69 all died in the inferno.\n\nTwo others managed to escape.\n\nThe boy faces five counts of first-degree murder, two counts of arson, and one count of aggravated arson over the deadly April fire, the ABC reports.\n\n(Image: Legacy.com)\n\n(Image: Legacy.com)\n\nThe controversial decision to charge such a young boy with murder has sent ripples through the American legal community.\n\nOne lawyer has argued children young enough to believe in Santa Claus can't form intent to commit murder, according to reports.\n\nAuthorities did not say if there was any connection between the suspect and the fire's victims.\n\nWoodford County State\u2019s Attorney Greg Minger told US media \"it was a heavy decision\" to charge the boy.\n\nHe said: \"It\u2019s a tragedy, but at the end of the day it\u2019s charging a very young person with one of the most serious crimes we have.\"\n\n(Image: Legacy.com)\n\n(Image: 25 News)\n\nThe prosecutor alleges the fire was set in the knowledge people were at home.\n\nThe boy's identity has been withheld, and reports say if he is convicted he will not face jail.\n\nInstead, a conviction would likely lead to mandatory therapy, psychological evaluation, and counselling, Mr Minger said.\n\nBut the The Sun reports some lawyers were seriously questioning the decision to charge the boy.\n\nChicago juvenile defense lawyer Gus Kostopoulos said: \"Nine-year-olds don't know that Santa Claus doesn't exist.\n\n\"They don't know people die and don't come back to life.\n\n(Image: 25 News)\n\n\"I don't know if nine-year-olds can form intent to commit murder.\"\n\nThe Juveline Justice Initiative also criticised the move, calling the charges \"completely\" out of line\" and at odds with what experts know about children's brain development.\n\nThe organisation's president Betsy Clark pointed out 14 is the minimum age for criminal prosecution in many countries, including Germany.\n\nIn the UK, it is 10, meaning children under that age can't be arrested or charged with a crime, although they can be punished and receive treatment in other ways.\n\nChildren aged between 10 and 17 in the UK are dealt with in youth courts, except for in the most extreme cases, such as when 10-year-olds Jon Venables and Robert Thompson were tied as adults for the notorious 1993 murder of two-year-old James Bulger.", "description": "Two children aged two and a one-year-old died in the inferno in Chicago, along with their dad and great-grandma", "authors": ["Talia Shadwell", "Image", "Facebook", "Legacy.Com", "News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20542299.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-09-at-052844.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
