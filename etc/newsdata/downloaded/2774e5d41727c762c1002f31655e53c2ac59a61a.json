Your failure or refusal to comply with the subpoena shall constitute evidence of obstruction of the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry,\u201d the three chairmen wrote.\n\nThe three committees also want any information the State Department has about the involvement of Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani. Additionally, five senior State Department officials have been scheduled for depositions during the upcoming congressional recess.\n\n\u201cThe department has previously acknowledged that Special Representative for Ukraine Kurt Volker played a direct role in arranging meetings between Rudy Giuliani, who has no official role in the U.S. government, and representatives of President Zelensky,\u201d the chairmen wrote to Pompeo on Friday.\n\nVolker resigned his post as the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine negotiations on Friday amid the increasing attention on his role in the controversy.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/416/1155968404_6089748555001_6089746049001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi and her leadership team agreed earlier this week to press ahead with an impeachment inquiry that\u2019s squarely focused on the Ukraine scandal engulfing Trump and some of his senior officials \u2014 allegations that have unified their fractious caucus against the president in a way that previous ones have not.\n\nThree members of the intelligence panel told POLITICO that they expect the committee to issue subpoenas for documents and witnesses as they work to corroborate the whistleblower\u2019s claims. Schiff later confirmed the action in his letter to colleagues.\n\nAtkinson, the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, previously said the complaint was both urgent and credible. The whistleblower, meanwhile, is awaiting legal guidance from the office of the director of national intelligence regarding what he or she is permitted to tell lawmakers. Democrats have accused Trump of abusing his power to pressure Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son, and possibly withhold critical military aid to the Eastern European country.\n\nIn a separate letter to Democrats Friday afternoon, Pelosi reiterated that the impeachment investigation \u201cwill be centered\u201d in the Intelligence Committee, adding that Democrats will have \u201ca series of conference calls\u201d over the two-week recess to keep everyone updated.\n\nHouse Democrats\u2019 campaign arm also sent lawmakers an internal poll conducted Thursday and Friday that showed likely voters more supportive of impeachment investigation than ever before. Fifty percent of likely voters said they would support \"impeaching Donald Trump and removing him from office\" and forty-nine percent of those surveyed said they were more likely to vote for a Democrat who backed an impeachment investigation versus thirty-eight percent who said they'd support a Republican opposed to the inquiry\n\nThe polling data, while still early, could help calm vulnerable Democrats who long resisted supporting impeachment in large part because voters were so against the idea.\n\nThe Intelligence Committee is in the spotlight as it pursues the Ukraine investigation, but members of the Judiciary Committee and lawmakers on some of the other panels investigating Trump are privately jockeying to ensure they have a say in how the impeachment inquiry culminates.\n\nHouse Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) told members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus during a closed-door meeting Thursday that the impeachment process, which his panel oversees, is not likely to be a sprawling one that includes a dozen articles of impeachment.\n\nNadler\u2019s key message to the group? \u201cIt\u2019s going to happen sooner than people think,\u201d said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), who attended the Thursday meeting.\n\n\u201cWhen I said it needs to happen before the end of the year, people started laughing, saying it\u2019s going to happen much faster than that,\u201d Khanna added.\n\nBut Nadler also stressed to lawmakers that the House should not sideline other potentially impeachable offenses, including those outlined in the Mueller report and allegations that Trump is violating the foreign and domestic emoluments clauses of the Constitution.\n\n\u201cIt makes no sense to put aside the Mueller investigation,\u201d Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.), an Intelligence Committee member, said in an interview. \u201cWe can\u2019t forget the special counsel\u2019s report and the crimes that were elicited there.\u201d\n\nLawmakers and aides emphasized that it is too early to discuss potential articles of impeachment and when such measures could come to the House floor. Much of the timing, they say, will depend on when \u2014 and if \u2014 they are able to secure further evidence from the whistleblower and the inspector general.\n\nAs the House moves ahead with its impeachment inquiry, top Democrats have increasingly discussed the possibility of pursuing \u201cobstruction of Congress\u201d as part of potential articles of impeachment, including during a closed-door meeting on Monday with committee chairs.\n\nThe focus on obstruction of Congress would be in addition to the House investigations centering on the mounting Ukraine scandal. Obstruction of Congress articles would be a catchall rebuke of the president, lawmakers say, over his refusal to comply with dozens of congressional oversight requests over the past year.\n\n\u201cObstruction of Congress is a unifying pattern of misconduct that we\u2019ve seen from the beginning of this Congress,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), a Judiciary Committee member. \u201cSo I would be shocked if it doesn\u2019t find its way into whatever our final work product is.\u201d\n\nRep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas), who sits on the Judiciary panel, said there is a \u201cstrong possibility\u201d that obstruction of Congress articles could receive an eventual vote.\n\n\u201cThe president has now had a long lineage of obstruction of Congress,\u201d she said, pointing to the Trump administration\u2019s refusal to initially turn over the whistleblower complaint and the stonewalling by Trump confidants like his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and former White House counsel Don McGahn.\n\nSchiff said the White House will only \u201cstrengthen the case on obstruction\u201d if it refuses to comply with his committee\u2019s investigation.\n\nStill, there is a simmering debate within the caucus about just what should be in the articles of impeachment that Democrats will likely draft. The difference of opinion is part of a larger behind-the-scenes turf way playing out over just who is overseeing the impeachment investigation.\n\n\u201cI think the articles of impeachment, assuming we refer them to the House, there will be a debate about what those should be,\u201d said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), a Judiciary Committee member. \u201cWhat the Judiciary Committee is going to do over the next couple of weeks is begin to start to think about the legal framework.\u201d\n\nJake Sherman contributed to this report.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Democrats are issuing new subpoenas and some lawmakers are planning to return to Washington despite a scheduled congressional recess.", "authors": ["Andrew Desiderio", "Heather Caygle", "Sarah Ferris"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fb/23/4d39f8ff4d7292e5e93179f63da3/190924-schiff-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
