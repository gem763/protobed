While there are limitations on how much contributors can give to individual candidates, there are no limits on donations to PACs that spend separately from specific campaigns.\n\nAccording to its website, the PAC\u2019s primary issues are traffic and congestion, homelessness and wage and business growth. CASE is also linked to the Seattle Chamber of Commerce.\n\nAs noted by The Seattle Times, at least two of the candidates the Chamber of Commerce opposes were supporters of the so-called \u201chead tax\u201d that the council considered implementing last year to combat homelessness.\n\nThe Seattle City Council initially adopted the tax in May 2018, which would have required companies that earn at least $20 million a year to pay $275 per employee annually. Amazon, which is headquartered in the city, was one of the companies that pushed Seattle to repeal the tax. It also threatened to withdraw local projects.\n\nThe proposal would have cost Amazon, which employees about 45,000 workers in the city, an estimated $12.4 million annually.\n\nLast June, the Seattle City Council repealed the head tax.\n\nIn the run-up to the elections, Amazon hosted more than 40 candidates and campaigns for a meet and greet with employees in addition to a candidate forum. It sponsored a series of debates in an effort to get its employees engaged, as well.\n\nVoters are expected to receive ballots for the Nov. 5 election in the coming days.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "All seven seats on the Seattle City Council are up for grabs.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/06/0/0/iStock-Amazon-HQ.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
