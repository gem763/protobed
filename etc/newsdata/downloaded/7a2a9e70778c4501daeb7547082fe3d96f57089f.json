Rosenstein\u2019s boss was then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the Russia probe, meaning the president would not have known either.\n\nA source close to Rosenstein confirmed to Fox News that he had confidential conversations with Mueller about whether he would be willing to serve in the event he needed to appoint a special counsel. These conversations began on May 12, 2017, prior to Mueller's meeting with the president on May 16, 2017, the source acknowledged.\n\nAt the time of the now-famous May 16, 2017 meeting, James Comey had been fired as FBI director just days before and -- unbeknownst to the president -- Mueller would end up being named special counsel the very next day to oversee the Trump-Russia probe.\n\nThe president has repeatedly claimed that Mueller \u2013 who served as FBI director under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama \u2013 met with him about returning to lead the Justice Department. The president has pointed to this to argue it was a conflict for Mueller to become special counsel, saying he opted against hiring Mueller as FBI director.\n\nBut Mueller, in his July congressional testimony, denied the claim, saying he believed he was giving \u201cinput\u201d to the president about the position.\n\n\u201cMy understanding was I was not applying for the job,\u201d Mueller said on July 24. \u201cI was asked to give my input on what it would take to do the job.\u201d\n\nJohn Dowd, who served as the president\u2019s attorney during the probe, ripped Mueller for meeting with Trump, calling it the \u201cmost dishonorable conduct I have ever witnessed.\u201d He added, \u201cCapt. Robert Mueller, USMC, sits in front of his commander-in-chief being interviewed for FBI director knowing he is going to investigate the president and never says a word.\u201d\n\nThe president himself has claimed there were \u201cnumerous witnesses\u201d to the meeting.\n\n\"It has been reported that Robert Mueller is saying that he did not apply and interview for the job of FBI Director (and get turned down) the day before he was wrongfully appointed Special Counsel\" Trump tweeted the day of Mueller\u2019s Capitol Hill testimony. \"Hope he doesn't say that under oath in that we have numerous witnesses to the interview, including the Vice President of the United States!\"\n\nMueller did not immediately return a request for comment from Fox News on Tuesday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt was announced earlier this month that Mueller rejoined the WilmerHale law firm, after concluding his work as special counsel.\n\nIn April, Mueller\u2019s team released a report about their findings, indicating they did not find evidence of coordination between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia while declining to reach a conclusion on whether the president's conduct during the probe amounted to obstruction.\n\nFox News\u2019 John Roberts and Alex Pappas contributed to this report.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE\u00a0\u2013 Multiple administration officials tell Fox News that when Robert Mueller met with President Trump in May of 2017, Mueller was indeed pursuing the open post as the director of the FBI \u2013 something the former Russia probe special counsel denied under oath during congressional testimony this summer.", "authors": ["Bret Baier", "Bret Baier Is The Chief Political Anchor Of Fox News Channel", "The Anchor", "Executive Editor Of", "Special Report With Bret Baier.", "He Is The Author Of"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/07/25/694940094001_6063881634001_6063879951001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
