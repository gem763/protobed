'Why? By forcing its employees to go along with this ''gender identity'' nonsense.'\n\nThe agent continued: 'Lying to yourself is one thing Lying to others is something else, but forcing others to lie, in order to perform their jobs, or to keep their jobs, is an altogether other evil.'\n\nAnother agent told a story of how they were inspecting bags and noticed a passenger left a note asking TSA agents not to touch anything and instead contact her.\n\nThe employee said they asked the boss who said 'eff that note, touch everything'.\n\n'Clearly I'm not the insubordinate type, so what do I do?
