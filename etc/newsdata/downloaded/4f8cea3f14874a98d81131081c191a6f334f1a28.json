This in part has allowed rival Altria-backed (MO.N) Juul to capture nearly three-quarters of the new market.\n\nAt the same time, a spike in teenage use and a string of illnesses and deaths possibly linked to the devices prompted the U.S. administration to ban flavoured e-cigarettes.\n\nThat has meant a double whammy for Imperial, which cut back on its 10% dividend growth target earlier this year to focus on developing its e-cigarette portfolio that includes Blu e-cigarettes.\n\n\u201cCURIOUS TIMING\u201d\n\nLast week, the company said that it was seeing a \u201cmarked slowdown\u201d in the growth of its e-cigarettes category, due to the U.S. ban, as many wholesalers and retailers were not ordering or promoting their products.\n\nThis also led the company to cut its full-year revenue forecast, sending its shares to a nine-year low.\n\n\u201cThe timing of the move is curious, given that the company as well as the sector is facing some serious headwinds as we move into the end of the year and look to 2020,\u201d Michael Hewson, Chief Market analyst at CMC Markets, said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no comment from her about why she is leaving..and it seems like they don\u2019t have a succession plan in place.\u201d\n\nCooper, 53, has spent two decades at the company and is one of just five female CEOs among Britain\u2019s top 100 listed companies. Since Cooper became CEO in May 2010, Imperial\u2019s stock has fallen 2%, while sales have risen 8%.\n\nWhile the hunt for a new CEO continues, Cooper\u2019s focus will include the asset divestment programme, from which the company expects to realise proceeds of up to 2 billion pounds ($2.46 billion) by May 2020, Imperial said.\n\nAs part of the plan, the company is looking to sell its premium cigar business, that includes brands such as Cohiba, Montecristo and Romeo Y Julieta. The company said last week said the business had generated strong interest from a number of potential buyers and that it remains on track to realise its proceeds target.\n\nShares of the company rose 0.4% in morning trade on Thursday.", "description": "Imperial Brands Plc Chief Executive Officer Alison Cooper will step down once a replacement is found, a move that comes as the cigarette maker grapples with a regulatory backlash against e-cigarettes and declining tobacco sales.", "authors": ["Siddharth Cavale", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
