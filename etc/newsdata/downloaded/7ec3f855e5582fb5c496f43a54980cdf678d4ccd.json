Ha! See you at the wedding!\u201d he wrote, thus giving away the date of their hush-hush late-June French ceremony. They married originally in Las Vegas in early May.\n\nKimmel asked him if the ceremony was indeed one week after his comment, and cited several news reports, including HuffPost\u2019s. \u201cI didn\u2019t know you had evidence,\u201d Dr. Phil said sheepishly.\n\nFinally, Dr. Phil conceded that \u201cit wasn\u2019t a week but it was pretty close.\u201d\n\nThese two had more issues to smooth over, like why Kimmel didn\u2019t ask Dr. Phil to his own wedding.
