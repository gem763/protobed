Many Ford workers believe GM strikers are sacrificing for them. But it's also curiosity. The deal the union ultimately gets with GM will influence the fates of hourly workers at Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.\n\nThen, there is the fear.\n\n\"If Ford isn\u2019t willing to budge on the same sticking points as GM, then the UAW might take us all out on strike,\" said James Benson, a team leader in the body shop at the Dearborn Truck plant. \"A better part of our workforce is probably not prepared for something long term. They are worried about a strike.\"\n\nMack Truck strike: More than 3,600 workers go on strike at Mack Truck plants in 3 states\n\n2020 Corvette: It's not just super-fast; it\u2019s luxury-car quiet and smooth\n\nKevin Donnellon, 23, of Eastpointe a striking GM worker checks out a box of supplies that include canned goods and ramen at the Local 163 in Westland, Monday, Oct. 14, 2019.

The most recent main sticking points have been the length of time for in-progression workers to reach a full wage, product allocation and updating pension and 401(k) formulas.\n\nFord and Fiat Chrysler workers might not be eager to live on $275 a week in strike wages as GM workers have done for a month, but they are stepping up to help their union brothers and sisters with support on the picket line and cash and food donations.\n\n\"They\u2019re all picketing, every single one of them,\" said Joe Garrett, Local 163's shop chairman at GM's Romulus Powertrain.\n\nEvery day, 15 to 30 Ford and FCA workers appear at the three Romulus Powertrain gates to join the GM strikers and spend an hour on the picket line, said Garrett.\n\n\"They lift our spirits on the picket line and there\u2019s just massive caring and giving,\" Garrett said.\n\nSteve Van Norman, 62, of Romulus and a 23 year GM employee, grabs a box of supplies to help out his family, Monday, Oct. 14, 2019, as Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles workers are donating food and other items at the Local 163 in Westland, Mich.

We had a day with about 100 Ford workers that came to Romulus.\u201d\n\nMost of the Ford and FCA UAW members are ready to help because \u201cthis fight is our fight,\u201d Walkowicz said. \"This can greatly impact our contract and our future.\"\n\nStrikers walk the line at Romulus Powertrain, Monday, Oct. 14, 2019. (Photo: Mandi Wright, Detroit Free Press)\n\nLocal 600 represents Dearborn Truck's union workers. About 4,200 hourly workers populate the plant. Walkowicz said Ford union members are troubled by the same issues as GM union workers.\n\nOne issue is temporary workers, who make up about 10% of Dearborn Truck's hourly workforce, he said. Compared with permanent workers, temps are paid less and get fewer benefits, yet often work similar jobs with no pathway to permanency.\n\n\"Most of the workers in the plant feel they need to be made permanent,\" said Walkowicz. \"It\u2019s totally unfair.\"\n\nFord workers want higher wages too, noting the big profits Detroit automakers have recorded over the past four years, Walkowicz said.\n\nFor its part, GM has said it has shared its success through annual profit-sharing checks to its workers. GM wants to lower its total labor costs to remain competitive against nonunion foreign-based carmakers who build in the United States. Those imports presently have a $13 per employee cost advantage when it comes to total costs of labor, including wages and benefits.\n\nJohn Taylor, 47, of Belleville, looks through supplies at the Local 163 in Westland, Monday, Oct. 14, 2019.

He has the \"utmost respect\" for GM strikers, who he said are \"taking the brunt of it with the strike.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m watching how dug in both sides are and if this goes any longer, it\u2019s not unheard of for the UAW to say, 'We\u2019ll move on to the next company and work with them,' which is Ford,\" said Benson. \"Or put us all on strike for more leverage.\"\n\nBenson said he has been saving his money to prepare for a possible strike. In the meantime, he reads all the news he can get on the talks.\n\nDave Kowalski, who has worked 25 years at Dearborn Truck, does not expect a strike at Ford even though, he said, \"Most of the UAW people are pretty steadfast to make sure we reap some of the billions of dollars they\u2019ve made.\"\n\nKowalski has not yet walked a GM picket line, but he said he \"absolutely\" plans to do so.\n\nLemanuel Jones, a team leader in transmissions at GM Romulus Powertrain, carries a box of can goods and supplies to help make ends meet during the strike at the Local 163 in Westland,Monday, Oct. 14, 2019. (Photo: Mandi Wright, Detroit Free Press)\n\nGood Samaritans\n\nBesides time on the line, other UAW locals have donated food and other goods to help strikers who are depleting their savings to survive on strike wages.\n\n\"We\u2019ve asked our workers to go out and walk the picket line and to donate goods such as gift cards,\" Walkowicz said. \"We\u2019ve been getting a good response.\"\n\nLocal 600 has delivered dozens of $25 gift cards to Local 163 for Meijer's, said Garrett.\n\n\"I can\u2019t even name all of their names, but Jay from Rouge came in here last Friday and had five vehicles full of food and stuff to give us,\" Garrett said. \"It\u2019s amazing what they\u2019ve done to give us support.\"\n\nLikewise, members of Local 900 in Wayne, which represents Ford's Michigan Assembly Plant, which builds the Ranger pickup, have come daily to either donate goods or lend support on the picket line, Garrett said. Also, Local 3000, which represents Ford's Flat Rock Assembly Plant; and Local 1248, which represents FCA's Mopar, have made donations of time and goods, said Garrett.\n\n\"I have seen guys taking three $100 bills out of their wallets and dropping it in the jar for our members,\" Garrett said. \"The amount of financial support they\u2019ve given us has been tremendous. Ford and Chrysler people are keeping us afloat on their donations.\"\n\nFollow Jamie L.
