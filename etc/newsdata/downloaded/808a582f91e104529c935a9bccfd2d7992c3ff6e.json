But the effort is stalled amid a fierce debate over how to figure out how much the insurer should then pay the doctor or hospital once the patient is protected, with intense lobbying from doctors and hospitals against getting pay cuts.\n\nNeal proposed late last month to essentially punt the problem to a committee of stakeholder groups and administrative agencies to come up with a solution. That proposal drew criticism even from some Democrats as not addressing the problem directly, but Neal said at the time that he was \u201coptimistic\u201d Brady would support it.\n\nNow, Brady is rejecting Neal\u2019s idea, raising questions about what the path forward is.\n\n\u201cI have yet to see how that would work anywhere in what we're trying to achieve for ending surprise medical billing,\u201d Brady said.\n\nBrady seemed to say that as an alternative approach, he supports allowing for an arbitration process as a backstop to give doctors a way to appeal payment rates that they view as too low, though he did not get into specifics.\n\nDoctors' groups are lobbying to allow for an arbitration process, which they think will give them fairer payment rates.\n\nBrady made the comments while standing next to Rep.
