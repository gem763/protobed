In 2010, the government passed a law prohibiting people from wearing a full-face veil in public spaces.\n\nThe new proposed legislation was passed by a majority right-wing Republican Senate, but it's unlikely to pass in the National Assembly, where Macron's party \"La R\u00e9publique en Marche\" has the majority.\n\nRead more: Veil back in the spotlight in France as politicians debate new law\n\nOn Wednesday, the leader of the Senate Republicans in France, Bruno Retailleau, said that he wanted the government not to speak loudly, but to act.\n\nRetailleau was referring to Macron stating in 2018 that wearing a veil did not \"conform to the civility\" of French society because of the value of equality between men and women.\n\nMacron's sentiment was echoed by Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa, the Secretary of State for Equality between women and men, who said that although she thought wearing a headscarf did not help to liberate women, she did not support the proposed law to ban religious symbols on school trips.\n\n\"If we exclude [women who wear a veil], I fear that we will exclude parents of children in French [public schools],\" she said.\n\nRetailleau had been asked to pull the proposed legislation by French Senator Samia Ghali in light of the shooting in Bayonne, but he refused.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Manuel Valls supported Macron's words on the subject on secularism - tell BFMTV that his speech was important because \"we are having a profound crisis of values.\"", "description": "Macron spoke about the French concept of \"la\u00efcit\u00e9\" or secularism, at the inauguration of a European Centre for Judaism.", "authors": ["Lauren Chadwick"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/26/89/58/1000x563_cmsv2_22cefead-6b43-563d-972b-403c1e484993-4268958.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
