As the meth kingpin-turned-prisoner Jesse Pinkman, he speeds away from his captors in a Chevrolet El Camino, laughing and crying hysterically, his face a mess of unkempt facial hair and bruises.\n\nThe Breaking Bad finale aired six years ago, and Paul\u2019s career has surged forward beyond the AMC drama: he starred in The Path, a Hulu series about a cult-like religion, and Need For Speed, an action movie based on the video game series of the same name. And he\u2019s currently a part of two immensely acclaimed shows, Westworld (which he\u2019ll join for its third season), and Bojack Horseman (which will end with its sixth season).\n\nBut Paul will never fully shake Jesse or his unresolved ending. \u201cI lived this guy,\u201d Paul tells TIME. And on Oct. 11, he steps back into the character in the Netflix film sequel El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie, which picks up moments after that final scene and follows Jesse\u2019s desperate bid for freedom out of Albuquerque\u2019s meth-ridden streets.\n\nIn an interview, Paul talked about returning to the enduring role that earned him three Emmys and reconnecting with old friends on set.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

It was a life-changing role for me, and there were a lot of ups and downs with this guy. In the first couple seasons, I tried to stay within that skin and stay as focused as possible. But [co-star] Bryan [Cranston] taught me that it\u2019s okay to wash the makeup off at the end of the day and just be yourself. It was a bit of a struggle for all of us\u2014it was an emotional toll. Playing Jesse was like revisiting an old friend.\n\nDid you ever imagine what might have happened to Jesse after the show\u2019s end?\n\nI love the way the show ended\u2014that it left it very vague. You\u2019d like to think he\u2019s riding off into the sunset, but you know life isn\u2019t going to be that easy for him.\n\nPeople, almost on a daily basis, ask me, \u201cWhat happened to Jesse?\u201d My response is, \u201cI have no idea. In reality, he\u2019s probably on the run and in hiding. His fingerprints were all over that murder scene.\u201d But I fantasized that he was just living in the woods somewhere, maybe working with his hands again, creating things with wood.\n\nThe ending of Breaking Bad is widely beloved. Did you have any trepidation when creator Vince Gilligan asked you to star in a continuation?\n\nZero. I think any fan of Vince trusts him. He\u2019s not going to do something for no reason. It was this itch that he just had to scratch; the one unanswered question that he was living with.\n\nThe movie picks back up with Jesse in a raw and traumatized state. How difficult was it to get back into such a fragile mindset?\n\nHonestly, not at all. After I first read the script, I instantly felt all of those emotions running through me. Because everything you saw and didn\u2019t see, I lived through these moments. It was incredibly easy to jump right back in.\n\nThe movie features several familiar faces from Breaking Bad. Did filming with them bring back a flood of memories from a bygone era?\n\nAbsolutely. Everyone had that same expression on their face when they\u2019re walking onto set, and would just say, \u201cThis is so weird.\u201d We\u2019re in the same wardrobe; we look just slightly older.\n\nHow difficult was it to film this movie under the veil of secrecy?\n\nIt was incredibly easy, to be honest. On the weekends, when my wife, my baby girl and I would be running around town, people would come up to me and ask what I\u2019m doing there. I would say, \u201cI\u2019m just doing this indie passion project.\u201d And that was it: no one questioned it, not one time. We never had any people trying to sneak around any photos of the sets.\n\nDo you think you\u2019ve improved as an actor since you left the show?\n\nYeah. Just rewatch the show and you can instantly find out: I am definitely a better actor from when I began. But when you are working with material coming from Vince Gilligan, it\u2019s nearly impossible to not spread your wings.\n\nI\u2019ve never taken an acting class: it was just trial and error, learning from my mistakes, forcing yourself to believe these situations that the characters are in. Sometimes you just get lost in these moments: You really feel like it\u2019s actually happening.\n\nSome actors think of really sad things that have happened in their life to stir up genuine emotion. I don\u2019t want to mess with that\u2014it feels too torturous. I try to separate myself completely from these roles that I play and just create all of these new moments.\n\nIt was recently announced that this season of Bojack Horseman will be the show\u2019s last. What can you say about your character Todd\u2019s closing arc?\n\nAll I can say is this season is just another punch in the gut of raw, honest reality. They\u2019re just not afraid to take you down that road and make you laugh and cry and think. And I love that Todd, when you first meet him, seems like this sort of loser, this slacker. But you quickly realize he\u2019s extremely articulate\u2014he\u2019s borderline genius in a way. He comes up with such idiotic ideas but I think is extremely profound at times. I think he\u2019s the most mysterious character of the show.\n\nYou\u2019re now filming another hugely popular and ambitious drama, Westworld. How do the universes compare?\n\nI\u2019m doing night shoots at the moment, and last night I worked until 7 a.m. My god, I wish I could tell you what we were doing last night. It was easily one of the most crazy, out-there moments in my entire career.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The actor talks about returning, for a new Netflix movie, to the enduring role that earned him three Emmys.", "authors": ["Andrew R.
