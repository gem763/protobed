October top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 3/11 9. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 4/11 8. Gennady Golovkin (39-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. The boxing legend is now a two-time world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 6/11 6. Errol Spence (26-0-0) Spence beat Shawn Porter to unify the welterweight division as he goes in search of more belts. Danny Garcia looks set to be next. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (17-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion has successfully moved up in weight, beating Chazz Witherspoon on his heavyweight debut. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

Getty Images\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very taxing on the body,\u201d he said. \u201cVery hard work. There\u2019s a lot of impact to the human body which is different to boxing because you don\u2019t really take any impact when you\u2019re boxing, well at least I don\u2019t. The cut [against Wallin] was my first one in 10 years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t take any impact in boxing but wrestling you take impact every day getting power-slammed suplexed, everything you can think of. I\u2019ve been getting chucked out of the ring too. It\u2019s all just impact impact impact. It is painful to say the least.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get hit when I\u2019m boxing really. I would say there is 100 times more impact than in boxing because I\u2019m actually getting picked up and slammed onto a hard floor. I don\u2019t ever get that in boxing, ever.\n\n\u201cI can honestly tell you that if I spar for 10 or 12 rounds, I might get hit five times. In this you\u2019re getting impacted every day you train. Every time I go to that gym and train for two hours there will be impact, getting smashed onto the floor, the ropes or into a corner.\n\n\u201cAnyone who says wrestling is easier than boxing is full of shit. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.\n\n\u201cI thought I had a hard schedule boxing twice a year, being away in training camp for 10 weeks. These guys are away every day and wrestle five nights a week. Braun Strowman had 191 matches last year, I had two. So which one is more taxing on the body?\u201d\n\nFury had been slated to take on Deontay Wilder in a much-anticipated rematch on February 22 following their memorable and controversial draw in Los Angeles last December.\n\nBut the severity of the cut that Fury suffered against Wallin had seemingly left the timing of that fight in doubt.\n\nThere were also suggestions that Fury\u2019s decision to take part in the world of WWE was evidence that he did not expect to be fit enough to face Wilder in four months\u2019 time.\n\nBut Fury says he will be boxing on the aforementioned date whether it is against Wilder or not. The American WBC heavyweight champion takes on Luis Ortiz on November 23 and a defeat would leave the Gypsy King in need of a new opponent.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to see what happens,\u201d Fury says. \u201cWrestling has offered me an opportunity and I\u2019ve taken it with both hands, let\u2019s see where that leads but there are no big plans for the future.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to February 22, It\u2019s not me, Wilder has to fight Ortiz so let\u2019s see how that fight goes and then we can make a decision. If he loses then it\u2019s definitely not going to happen in February, it won\u2019t happen at all.\n\n\u201cIf he loses we will have to look for a new opponent for February 22nd. Either way, I\u2019ll be boxing on February 22 in Vegas, whether it\u2019s Wilder or not. What happens in other people\u2019s lives or careers is none of my concern but in my life and career, I\u2019ll be boxing February 22nd.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s for sure, providing I don\u2019t get run over in the meantime. Whether the cut is ok or not, I will still be fighting February 22 because that\u2019s what I do.\u201d\n\nOn the wound, he added: \u201cIt was only 40 days ago it happened and it\u2019s doing alright now. I\u2019ve been told it will take 100 days until it\u2019s fully healed. It should be alright,\n\n\u201cIt could open up, but I could walk into the door and open it up, anything could happen. That\u2019s the sort of risk element that you face in day-to-day life.\u201d", "description": "Tyson Fury has described wrestling training as \u2018100 times\u2019 harder than his usual boxing preparation and insists he will be back to his usual sport in time for February 22.
