But intelligence officials are suspicious of Huawei\u2019s ties to the Chinese government and worried about the vulnerability of 5G networks.\n\nAdding to Merkel\u2019s headaches, the U.S. administration has turned the Huawei case into a test of loyalty for western nations in its trade war with China. The White House is also demanding tougher restrictions and threatening to end intelligence cooperation with Germany if Merkel doesn\u2019t deliver.\n\nMerkel on Tuesday promised that German companies will soon have access to 5G technology at a reasonable price. Deutsche Telekom AG has said that a 5G roll-out would be delayed by at least two years and cost the industry billions if a full ban were to be imposed on Huawei.\n\nBruno Kahl, who heads the Federal Intelligence Service, or BND, issued a warning in rare public testimony on Tuesday, saying Huawei was too dependent on the Chinese Communist Party and \u201ccan\u2019t be fully trusted.\u201d The comments came a week after reports that the German Chancellery had intervened to soften security measures, effectively killing any attempt to impose a ban on Huawei.\n\n\u201cDespite a very intensive discussion that\u2019s lasted over many months, the position of the government is not clear -- apparently not even to the heads of the intelligence services,\u201d Konstantin von Notz, a lawmaker with the opposition Green party who queried the BND chief in Tuesday\u2019s testimony, said in a statement to Bloomberg afterward. Merkel\u2019s government has \u201cfailed to this day\u201d to establish tough guidelines.\n\nHuawei pushed back, saying that accusations over trustworthiness were unfounded for a company serving three billion people globally.\n\n\u201cWe have never introduced, and would never entertain the thought of introducing, so-called \u2018backdoors\u2019 in our equipment,\u201d Huawei said in an emailed response to a query. \u201cNo government agency or outside organization holds any shares in Huawei or controls Huawei in any way.\u201d\n\nA group of lawmakers in Merkel\u2019s bloc led by Norbert Roettgen, the chairman of the parliamentary foreign affairs committee, added to the mounting dissent last week with an op-ed in Handelsblatt, the German daily, that called for the lower house, or Bundestag, to take control of assessing trustworthiness of 5G equipment suppliers. The German Interior Ministry relented to criticism and has pledged to weigh political factors when assessing components for 5G, Handelsblatt reported.\n\nMerkel\u2019s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, last week denied that the Chancellery had softened draft security standards by removing the ability of authorities to identify \u201cuntrustworthy\u201d vendors. \u201cAs far as we know, there was at no time during the drafting process a \u2018banning clause,\u2019\u201d Seibert told reporters.\n\nWhile not calling for a complete ban, officials in the BND as well as the foreign and interior ministries want to have the tools to keep Huawei out if they decide it poses a security risk. The chances of German authorities determining whether equipment contains secret backdoors that could give China access to data is \u201cvery limited if not to say hopeless,\u201d Kahl said.\n\nEven if it were possible, he added, a software update could \u201cimmediately\u201d alter the network and open it to \u201csabotage or espionage.\u201d\n\n--With assistance from Birgit Jennen and Stefan Nicola.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Patrick Donahue in Berlin at pdonahue1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Ben Sills at bsills@bloomberg.net, Raymond Colitt\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Chancellor Angela Merkel is under pressure from her intelligence services and her party to toughen her stance on Chinese equipment supplier Huawei Technologies Co. to ensure German data is safe as the country builds out its fifth-generation networks.Security and intelligence officials", "authors": ["Patrick Donahue"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/YqwZTeeJAPJ4UNopw3Sttg--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/88a2c9c5c6b03334501f52e18bfeabf8", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
