This came after Reuters reported on Friday the U.S.\n\nadministration was considering de-listing Chinese companies from\n\nU.S. stock markets. \"For the short term there is some confusion considering the\n\ncontradicting headlines we are getting on the trade war,\" said\n\nAxiTrader market strategist Stephen Innes.\n\n\"In these situations what investors do is quit their\n\nposition in equities and switch to bond markets,\" said Innes,\n\nadding that this boosted the dollar and in turn made gold\n\nexpensive.\n\nSpot gold fell 0.3% to $1,492.30 per ounce by 0418\n\nGMT, after hitting its lowest since Sept. 18 at $1,486.60 in the\n\nprevious session.\n\nU.S. gold futures GCcv1 for December delivery fell 0.5% to\n\n$1,498.80 per ounce.\n\nMeanwhile, ahead of trade talks with the United States,\n\nChinese Vice Commerce Minister Wang Shouwen said on Sunday the\n\ntwo major economies would resolve their trade dispute \"with a\n\ncalm and rational attitude\".\n\n\"The gold market is looking for clarity on the trade war\n\nfront while the Federal Reserve narrative has been less dovish,\"\n\nInnes said.\n\nPhiladelphia Federal Reserve Bank President Patrick Harker\n\nsaid on Friday he opposed the central bank's September rate cut\n\nand thinks the Fed should \"hold firm\" on interest\n\nrates. Higher interest rates boost the dollar, making\n\ndollar-denominated gold more expensive for buyers using other\n\ncurrencies and reducing investor interest in non-yielding\n\nbullion.\n\n\"Overall, gold remains stuck in a wider $1,480 to $1,530 an\n\nounce longer-term trading range,\" OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley\n\nsaid in a note, adding that a trade or some other geopolitical\n\ncatalyst was needed to break the range.\n\nHoldings in SPDR Gold Trust , the world's largest\n\ngold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 0.22% to 922.88 tonnes on\n\nFriday.
