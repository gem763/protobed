Johnson is pushing for a snap election.

There are too many people in that party who don\u2019t want to listen to the public,\u201d Bowkett, 58, said holding up an umbrella on a rainy day this week in Lincoln in eastern central England.\n\n\u201cI am beginning to doubt that Brexit will happen, and I don\u2019t think the Conservatives can deliver it alone.\u201d\n\nBowkett is just the sort of voter Prime Minister Boris Johnson needs if he is to win an election following parliament\u2019s rejection of a Brexit deal agreed by his predecessor, Theresa May, and the EU\u2019s refusal to renegotiate it.\n\nJohnson wants an election to strengthen his mandate for pulling Britain out of the EU after his Conservative government lost its majority over his handling of Brexit. Opponents refuse to endorse an early election unless he rules out leaving the EU without a deal, which could cause a disorderly Brexit, but a snap poll is likely sooner or later.\n\nIt is a risky move. If Johnson fails to carry out a pledge to leave the EU on Oct. 31, frustrated Brexit supporters like Bowkett could be driven into the arms of the Brexit Party founded this year by eurosceptic Nigel Farage, polls show.\n\nJohnson could lose power, the main opposition Labour Party could enter government and Brexit might never happen.\n\nEven if Johnson can persuade the EU to accept a revision of the deal reached by Theresa May, it is unlikely to be enough to appease voters like Bowkett.\n\n\u201cIf that (revision) happens, all this fighting will have been pointless,\u201d Bowkett said. \u201cWe will be the laughing stock of the world.\u201d\n\nELECTION GAMBLE\n\nTo win a majority in a general election, Johnson will be banking on winning in places such as Lincoln, a cathedral city that was an important settlement in Roman times and lies 120 miles (193 km) north of London.\n\nThe constituency, narrowly held by Labour, has been a bellwether of national trends in all but one election since 1979.\n\nIt voted 57% in favour of quitting the EU in the 2016 Brexit referendum - compared to the nationwide margin of 52-48 - and the Brexit Party finished top in local voting in European elections in May, as it did in the national vote.\n\nThe Brexit Party has proposed a non-aggression pact with the Conservatives to avoid diluting support for leaving the EU. But so far Johnson, who also risks losing votes to Labour and the pro-EU Liberal Democrats, has rejected its overtures.\n\nBrexit supporters\u2019 frustration is evident in the streets beneath Lincoln\u2019s Norman castle. Many said they wanted to exit the EU so that some of the large sums Britain pays into the bloc\u2019s coffers can be reinvested in their community.\n\nThey say there are few good jobs, the transport system is underfunded and that immigration since the EU took in 10 new member states in 2004, most of them from the former Soviet bloc, is putting extra pressure on local services. A local road called Portland Street is known to locals as Poland Street. The nearby town of Boston has experienced the highest levels of immigration in Britain.\n\nJohn Roland, a retired engineer, said the main institutions in Britain were failing and he planned to back the Brexit Party.\n\n\u201cI feel like we need some fresh blood,\u201d he said.\n\nBrexit supporters broadly welcome Johnson\u2019s Brexit stance but say some Conservative lawmakers have undermined him by opposing his strategy of threatening the EU that Britain will leave without a deal if the terms on offer are not good enough.\n\n\u201cWhen you take away his \u2018atomic bomb\u2019, you have no leverage,\u201d said David Daniels, a Lincoln policeman and former member of the air force.\n\nNON-AGGRESSION PACT?\n\nThe Conservatives lead Labour by between one and 14 points in opinion polls. The Brexit party trails further behind but an ICM poll last week found support for Farage\u2019s party would double from nine percent to 18 percent in any election held after Oct. 31 if Britain had not left the EU by then.\n\nThe poll, commissioned by Represent Us \u2014 which is pushing for a second Brexit referendum \u2014 found the Conservatives\u2019 lead over Labour would evaporate in these circumstances.\n\nThere is no longer enough time to hold an election before November and EU negotiator Michel Barnier is not optimistic a divorce deal can be reached on or before Oct. 31. [L5N2636V4]\n\nJohnson\u2019s ability to take Britain out without a deal has also been hindered by parliament passing a law forcing him to seek a delay - which he has said he will not do.\n\nJohn Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said a decisive factor in the election would be whether eurosceptic voters have more confidence in Johnson or Farage over Brexit.\n\n\u201cThat could be the crucial debate on which any election might well turn,\u201d he said.\n\nKarl McCartney, the Conservative candidate for Lincoln and the local member of parliament between 2010 and 2017, acknowledged the threat from the Brexit Party.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cWe know if we do not leave (the EU) ... the Brexit Party is the main danger, not the Labour Party,\u201d he said.\n\nFarage, who has spoken at two rallies in Lincoln in the last five months, sees few options for Johnson and has proposed Conservative and Brexit Party candidates do not run against each other in more than 80 of the 650 parliamentary constituencies.\n\n\u201cI very much hope that Boris Johnson will simply look at the numbers,\u201d Farage told Reuters. \u201cIf we stand against them, they cannot win a majority.\u201d", "description": "James Bowkett is a long-time Conservative Party supporter who voted in 2016 for Britain to leave the European Union.", "authors": ["Andrew Macaskill", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429387816&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0QH", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
