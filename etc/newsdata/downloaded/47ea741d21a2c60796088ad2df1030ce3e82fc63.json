Consumers flush with rising wages and benefiting from strong jobs growth have kept things ticking over.\n\nSecond, \"while there's still uncertainty as a result of the coming election in Britain . . . . the tail risk of a non-negotiated no-deal Brexit seems to have decreased\", Powell said.\n\n\"There's plenty of risk left, but the risks do seem to have subsided.\"\n\nPowell's remarks echo what Reserve Bank of Australia governor Philip Lowe has been saying since he took part in the International Monetary Fund's annual meeting in Washington two weeks ago.\n\nWhat both Powell and Lowe are saying, in effect, is that a significant measure of the future trajectory of economic growth now rests with key global leaders. Central banks have done what they can.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nChile's decision on Wednesday (Thursday AEDT) to cancel next month's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit has set back hopes that Trump and China's president Xi Jinping would use the forum to sign a starting deal to end their two-year trade war.\n\nBut both sides are now scrambling to find an alternative opportunity, according to some reports.\n\nPowell made no reference to the Chile cancellation, suggesting policymakers don't regard it as endangering chances of a potential breakthrough.\n\nWith Wall Street equity markets close to records, Powell did nothing to disturb investors on Wednesday (Thursday AEDT) when he pointedly dismissed questions about whether he would return to \"normalising\" rates next year.\n\nHe responded by saying the Fed would only raise rates if inflation began to pick up, and \"we don't see that\".\n\n\"It seems to be settling in below 2 per cent . . . . inflation expectations have moved down and sideways.\n\n\"We're not thinking about raising rates right now. What we're really thinking now is that our current stance is appropriate and will remain so.\"\n\nPowell has given notice that the Fed is done.\n\nThe only things that would change that outlook, he indicated, is if economic growth, employment or inflation collapsed.", "description": "The Fed's mid-cycle adjustment is over and, it would seem, a new normal has been reached.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2119%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_110/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/7b119099a73e0ec9c9b7e4ef70d4be269e026af8", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
