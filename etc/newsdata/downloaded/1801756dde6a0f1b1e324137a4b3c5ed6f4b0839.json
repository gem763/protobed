It\u2019s a passion project for me.\u2019\n\nAt the time, 50 admitted he didn\u2019t expect to win any awards or accolades for his efforts in losing weight to portray the cancer patient.\n\nHe said: \u2018Well, you know, I haven\u2019t received accolades that comes with the success that I\u2019ve had in music. It would be a surprise [to win].\u2019\n\nBut he did find comfort in the fact that other actors had literally dedicated their body to their art, and used their experiences for research.\n\nWe\u2019re guessing Christian Bale\u2019s shocking transformation for The Machinist was top of the list.\n\nFast forward to nine years later and Fiddy is actually putting on the pounds.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nThe Candy Shop rapper shared an Instagram photo of him on the set of For Life in character as Isaac Wright Jr, who was wrongfully convicted of being a drug kingpin in 1991.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWearing a red prison jumpsuit, it\u2019s clear that 50 has seriously bulked up.\n\nIn the caption, he revealed: \u2018My New ABC show is intense,I filmed yesterday I\u2019m still bugging. I gained 15 pounds for this role.\u2019\n\nBasically, he really suffers for his art and we salute him for it.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
