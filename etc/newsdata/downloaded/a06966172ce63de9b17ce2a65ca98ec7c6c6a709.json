As recently as Friday, Trump boasted that he'd \"defeated\" the Islamic State, days after the terrorist group released a recording purportedly of its fugitive leader exhorting its fighters to pursue their violent cause.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIn their final report, released Tuesday, members of the Syria Study Group lay out dozens of suggestions for U.S. strategy in Syria, including the need for a continued U.S. military presence to battle terrorist groups and the importance of holding Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad accountable for war crimes.\n\nBut the core idea animating the report? American leaders must stay consistently engaged in Syria because it holds long-term risks for U.S. national security and because the conflict there, now over eight years old, is nowhere near finished.\n\nThe panel makes the argument for engagement even while acknowledging Americans have grown tired of the Syrian issue. Those weary Americans include President Trump, who has roiled Washington's national security establishment by trying to pull U.S. troops out of the country.\n\n\u201cSyria is now a breeding ground for terrorist organizations committed to attacking the United States, the front line for Iranian power projection, and the main stage for Russia\u2019s return to the region,\u201d the report warns. \u201cEach of these actors is now better positioned to influence Syria\u2019s future than the United States and its allies and partners.\u201d\n\nThe roughly 80-page report largely echoes an interim version POLITICO wrote about in May. The final version, however, lands amid unusually high tensions in the Middle East, with the U.S. and Iran trading accusations over a series of attacks on Gulf Arab states\u2019 oil infrastructure.\n\nGlobal Translations A new podcast series from POLITICO.

The panel, housed at the U.S. Institute of Peace, is modeled after the Iraq Study Group, which was established in 2006 to recommend policy following the 2003 U.S. invasion. The Syria panel was created by legislation spearheaded by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), who worked with the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) on the idea.\n\nThe final report devotes significant attention to Iran\u2019s role in Syria.\n\nIt says Iran\u2019s \u201ctwo-track policy of military entrenchment and political and economic activity\u201d appears designed to make it a major player in Syria \u201cfor the long term.\u201d Israeli airstrikes have disrupted some of Iran\u2019s activities, but Tehran\u2019s \u201coverall objectives appear unchanged.\u201d\n\nIranian leaders\u2019 efforts to gain influence in Syria include setting up cultural centers and schools that offer scholarships and stipends for Syrian students.\n\nThe U.S. should stick to its objective of expelling Iran from Syria, but \u201crecognize that this is best accomplished in phases,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe immediate goal should be to prevent more Iranian entrenchment, including by supporting Israeli air strikes and sanctions on Tehran. In the long run, the U.S. should insist any political settlement for the Syrian conflict include the withdrawal of Iran\u2019s direct and proxy forces, the report states.\n\nThe Syria Study Group says the United States underestimated Russia\u2019s ability to gain regional influence by intervening in Syria to support Assad against a popular rebellion. The cost to Russia has been relatively small, the report adds: \u201cMost estimates suggest that Moscow spends only around $4 million a day in Syria.\u201d\n\n\u201cGovernments in the Middle East are deepening ties to Russia across multiple sectors \u2014 military, diplomatic, economic, and energy \u2014 to hedge against perceptions of U.S. retrenchment and unreliability,\u201d the report states. As one example, \u201cIn Iraq, Russia has opened an intelligence-sharing center to facilitate cooperation with the Iraqi military.\u201d\n\nIn fact, \u201cthe threat to Israel posed by Iran in Syrian territory has motivated Israeli leaders to seek accommodation with Russia,\u201d the report states, adding: \u201cAlthough Russia has acquiesced to the Israeli campaign against Iran, there are few signs of a wider divergence between Moscow and Tehran regarding aims or tactics in Syria.\u201d\n\nMoscow will seek to leverage its influence in the Middle East in other global arenas, including its relations with NATO countries, the report predicts. It recommends, among other moves, that the U.S. pressure Russia to help deliver a political settlement to end the Syrian conflict, including by exposing Russian war crimes in Syria.\n\nThe panel also urges that the U.S. \u201cmaintain consistency\u201d in advancing its objectives and \u201crally allies and partners by taking their concerns into account and ensuring that, going forward, they are never surprised or undermined by U.S. policy actions or announcements.\u201d\n\nWhile the report does not single out Trump on this front, the unpredictability of the president\u2019s foreign policy moves, including in Syria, have deeply unnerved many longstanding U.S. allies, not to mention even some of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans in Congress.\n\nThe American military intervention in Syria, which began falling to pieces in 2011, has largely been aimed at fighting terrorist groups such as the Islamic State and al Qaeda or its affiliates.\n\nStarting under former President Barack Obama, the U.S. rallied dozens of countries to help local forces, including Kurdish fighters, take back territory in Iraq and Syria occupied by the Islamic State. The Trump administration continued that fight, eventually seizing back all the land.\n\nBut the Syria Study Group\u2019s report says Islamic State, also known as ISIS, remains a danger both inside Syria and beyond.\n\n\u201cISIS no longer holds significant territory in Syria or Iraq, but it is not defeated,\u201d the report explains. \u201cThe group has morphed into an insurgency with the will, capability, and resources to carry out attacks against the United States.\u201d In Syria, ISIS retains \u201cexcellent command and control capability,\u201d the report says, adding that a burgeoning campaign of prison breakout operations in both Syria and Iraq mirrors a similar effort that preceded ISIS\u2019s 2014 rise.\n\nOther terrorist groups also abound, making it all the more necessary for the U.S. to keep a presence in Syria, even if it\u2019s a small one, the report argues.\n\n\u201cAlthough the U.S. military mission in Syria is often lumped together with the Iraq and Afghanistan missions in the \u2018forever war\u2019 category, the Syria case offers a different\u2014and far less costly\u2014model,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe report covers a range of other issues, including: tensions between the U.S. and Turkey in Syria; the humanitarian suffering caused by all the fighting and the strains caused by refugee outflows.\n\nIt pays special attention to the struggle for the area of Idlib, where one al Qaeda offshoot has formed a government and a second has \u201cthe capacity and the desire to conduct external attacks.\u201d The Idlib area remains largely outside the reach of the U.S. military.\n\nThe report urges the U.S. to prioritize devising a long-term solution to the problem of thousands of detained Islamic State fighters, as well as the many more family members of the fighters in camps.\n\nMany are children who were indoctrinated with Islamic State ideology. Many of the fighters, meanwhile, are citizens of European and other countries beyond Iraq and Syria that are reluctant to take them back.\n\nThe U.S. should help \u201cdevelop an internationally coordinated strategy for addressing the ISIS detainee problem set and designate one senior U.S. official charged with implementing a coherent strategy to address all ISIS detainee populations,\u201d the report offers, among several recommendations on the issue.\n\nThe report bemoans Assad\u2019s brutal treatment of civilians, as well as his flouting of international norms against the use of chemical weapons. It acknowledges, however, that Assad is unlikely to face accountability for his actions anytime soon, not least because Russia holds a veto on the United Nations Security Council.\n\nIt advises that the \u2014 along with its ongoing efforts to diplomatically isolate Assad and economically sanction him \u2014 the U.S. nonetheless plan for a long-term approach to accountability.\n\nOne way is to robustly \u201dfund documentation efforts and support organizations focused on building evidence for third-country prosecutions.\u201d", "description": "The panel makes the argument for engagement even while acknowledging Americans have grown tired of the Syrian issue.", "authors": ["Nahal Toosi", "Wesley Morgan"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/73/51/220d4c2445d6a3f1d3497363c293/190510-us-syria-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
