Prorogation! The Speaker! The Black Rod! Boris Johnson! Well, here\u2019s one new term you probably don\u2019t need explaining: The Hulk.\n\nYes, recently-elevated Prime Minister Boris Johnson \u2014 best known before his current position as unelected leader of the United Kingdom for being an absolute wanker \u2014 has decided that his latest way to connect with the increasingly politically ostracised youths is to invoke Marvel Comics. That he did so in an interview with a newspaper, specifically The Mail on Sunday, is probably not the best way to target said youths, but hey, the kids! They like the Marvel movies and not being part of the European Union, right?\n\nMAIL On Sunday: \u201cWe\u2019ll Break Free Of The EU Like The Incredible Hulk\u201d #bbcpapers #TomorrowsPapersToday pic.twitter.com/8lig4ZH7HL \u2014 Allie Hodgkins-Brown (@AllieHBNews) September 14, 2019\n\nRight?\n\nAnyway, yes. Here is the ostensible leader of a nation telling the press that, should he be confronted by the UK Parliament\u2019s recently-ratified legal action to prevent the UK facing the political equivalent of shitting its own pants with a no-deal Brexit \u2014 currently set on November 1 \u2014 that he would become Bruce Banner, break the surly bonds of his enemies, and Hulk out.\n\nBanner might be bound in manacles, but when provoked he would explode out of them. Hulk always escaped, no matter how tightly bound in he seemed to be \u2014 and that is the case for this country. We will come out on 31 October and we will get it done. The madder Hulk gets, the stronger Hulk gets.\n\nThis would require literally breaking the law \u2014 legal experts have advised Johnson could even face prison time for doing so. But since when did skirting the law ever stop the Hulk from carving a path of titanic destruction? Oh wait, right, he\u2019s a goddamn comic book character. And these days is actually scary smart, whether that\u2019s on screen or in the books themselves.\n\nClearly, the same can\u2019t be said for Boris Johnson.", "description": "If you\u2019ve been trying to pay attention to whatever in god\u2019s now-ungodly-name is going on in the UK right now over the nightmare that is Brexit, recently you\u2019ve heard about some bizarre, arcane parliamentary terminology.
