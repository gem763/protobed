The greens are soft so we can fire at just about every flag.\"\n\nWoods, who will equal Sam Snead's record if he can complete victory on Monday, added: \"I'm going to try and win, there's no doubt about that.\n\n\"I've got a job to do tomorrow and start off on the 12th hole. It's not exactly the easiest of holes, so right out of the gate I've got one of the hardest par fours on the golf course. It certainly will have my attention.\n\n\"As the holes have gone by I've gotten a little bit more comfortable. I didn't start off very good this week, bogeyed my first three holes, but after that it's been pretty good.\"\n\nSouth Korea's Sungjae Im and US Open champion Gary Woodland are six shots off the pace with four and eight holes to play respectively, with Rory McIlroy a stroke further back.\n\nMcIlroy, who fired an eagle and six birdies in a third round of 63, has just two holes of his final round to play.\n\nPA", "description": "Tiger Woods is on the verge of winning a record-equalling 82nd PGA Tour title in the weather-effected Zozo Championship in Japan.
