He\u2019s called Josh Varley and he\u2019s younger than me,\u201d said Root.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

We\u2019ve been doing a bit of work together, not much technical stuff but he\u2019s been doing a lot of flinging.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also been down to Denstone College to use the facilities there, where (former Yorkshire wicketkeeper) Simon Guy is head of cricket. Starting out he was a bit of a mentor to me and he knows my game like the back of his hand.\n\n\u201cI wanted to work on a few things so it\u2019s been good to get back into it. I want to start the winter with a bang and set a marker in terms of making big scores and leading from the front.\u201d\n\nRoot had a top score of 77 in the summer\u2019s drawn Ashes series and also bagged three ducks, a contribution far beneath his own high standards, and has taken the chance to cast his net a little wider than usual to find a remedy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m throwing ideas around, using people outside of the bubble. Getting different points of view and different ways of looking at things is nice,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI do brilliant work with (England batting coach) Graham Thorpe but every now and again when you\u2019re out of it, it\u2019s quite nice to go to other people.\n\n\u201cI think four years ago was the last time I had a break this long and that\u2019s because I broke a thumb.\n\n\u201cSo to have a break, working on things without the pressure of a game in a week\u2019s time is invaluable.\u201d\n\nDespite appreciating the chance to take a step off the treadmill, Root realises his absence for the next five matches represents a risk.\n\nWhile still the fulcrum of the five-day side, he is no longer a guaranteed selection for the sprint format with a year to go to the next Twenty20 World Cup.\n\nHe was England\u2019s top-scorer when they finished runners-up in the 2016 final but with plenty of talent coming up underneath, the competition for places in heating up.\n\nSomerset\u2019s rising star Tom Banton was among those on the long flight to Christchurch for England\u2019s Monday departure and the uncapped batsman will surely get his chance to stake his claim for next year\u2019s tournament \u2013 a challenge Root relishes.\n\n\u201cIf someone like Tom comes in and sets the world alight and I\u2019ve got to try and force him out in the limited opportunities I get to play then it\u2019s going to raise the standard of England cricket in that format,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cFor me, I just have to keep improving and getting better and it will raise the bar for the team.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the food chain that cricket is sometimes. You\u2019ve got to be at the top of it or you\u2019ll get swept away and eaten up.\u201d", "description": "England\u00a0captain Joe Root has gone back to basics to rediscover his best form with the bat, linking up with a friend from boyhood club Sheffield Collegiate for informal coaching sessions.
