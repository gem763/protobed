He was leading again late in Doha but, though he faded to finish fourth, he crossed the line on his feet this time.\n\nNow he, and many more like him, particularly from cooler parts of the world, will be able to plan their next year of training thinking only of how to improve such things as their oxygen take up, their running economy and build their strength and endurance, and no longer try to find a way to \"just survive\".\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "The news that the marathon and walking events at the Tokyo Olympics are set to move to a cooler climate will be welcomed by the majority of athletes, who can now focus on reaching their absolute maximum without fear of a major medical breakdown.
