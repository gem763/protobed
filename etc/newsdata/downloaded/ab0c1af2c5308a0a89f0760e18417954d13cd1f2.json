Respect the game, and they did that.\n\n\u2018They\u2019re hugely talented and they;re leaning to manage and be ruthless in games.\u2019\n\nAyoze Perez and Jamie Vardy both scored twice in the absolute demolition of the Saints, with Youri Tielemans, Ben Chilwell and James Maddison all also finding the back of the net.\n\nRodgers is delighted with the confidence and the \u2018lovely arrogance\u2019 of his side, with the Northern Irishman continuing: \u2018There\u2019s a lot of confidence, which is great, but they\u2019re good boys as well, they\u2019re honest fellas, boys like Ben and James there\u2019s a lovely arrogance, but you can see they can produce it on the field.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Leicester make Premier League history with 9-0 walloping of Southampton\n\nMORE: Gary Neville hails Mike Dean as the VAR king after Ryan Bertrand red card for Southampton against Leicester", "description": "Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers encouraged his team to 'punish' a dreadful Southampton side en route to their record breaking 9-0 win at St Mary's on Friday night.
