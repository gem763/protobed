The exhumation began Thursday morning in the presence of 22 Franco family members, including his seven grandchildren. Members of Spain\u2019s Socialist government, which ordered the exhumation after years of legislative and judicial hurdles, were also present.\n\nMore than 500 international and national journalists congregated Thursday outside the entrance to the complex. Attendees must pass a metal detector, with all cameras forbidden in the sanctuary where the tomb will be opened.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe exhumation, once unimaginable, comes at a time of deep political polarization in Spain, weeks before it goes to the polls on Nov. 10 in the fourth general election in less than four years.\n\nOpposition parties have criticized the Spanish government for going ahead with the exhumation, slamming it as a campaign move meant to further polarize the electorate.\n\nFranco ruled Spain from 1936 until his death in 1975, coming to power after defeating the democratic government in the Spanish Civil War. His death paved the way for Spain\u2019s peaceful transition to democracy.\n\nThe move, long a priority of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez, follows years of judicial proceedings, with Spain\u2019s Supreme Court recently dismissing the Franco family\u2019s objections.\n\n\u201cExhuming the dictator was a key part of the many reflections made over the years by the men and women in this country who didn't want their relatives to be in the dark,\u201d Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo said Thursday morning.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work ahead of us,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are the second country in the world in terms of missing people from the war. That is unacceptable. The Valley of the Fallen will be a place of memory and honor, justice for all, for both sides. Because there are more than 30,000 people buried there from both sides.\u201d\n\nWhile Franco\u2019s popularity is waning, the burial site has been a place of pilgrimage for his supporters on the far right to commemorate the anniversary of his death on Nov. 22.\n\nOriginally presented by Franco as a monument to both sides of the civil war, the Valley of the Fallen \u2014 whose giant cross is visible for miles \u2014 has become a symbol of Franco\u2019s rule. But it is also the focal point of Spain\u2019s 2007 Historical Memory Law, which formally condemned Franco\u2019s regime, recognized victims on both sides of the civil war and called for the repurposing of the monument to represent all Spaniards.\n\n\u201cToday the doors of the Valley of the Fallen are opened so that democracy can enter,\u201d said Emilio Silva, who heads the Association for the Recovery of Historic Memory. \u201cAnd it ends the marginalization that the victims of the Francoist dictatorship have suffered for 40 years.\u201d\n\nSome 300 Franco supporters, who oppose the exhumation and relocation, congregated at the entrance to the private cemetery where his remains will be reinterred. Decked in pro-Franco flags and scarves, protesters chanted: \u201cLong live Spain. Long live Franco.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWeather allowing, the double coffin with its zinc interior will be flown by helicopter to the family crypt in Madrid\u2019s Mingorrubio Cemetery, where Franco\u2019s body will be buried next to that of his wife, Carmen Polo, in a private family ceremony.\n\nAntonio Tejero, son of a Spanish Civil Guard general who attempted a coup d\u2019etat in 1981 in support of Franco\u2019s legacy, is the priest the Franco family has chosen for the funeral Mass.", "description": "The decision was a priority of Spain\u2019s Socialist government but comes at a time of dangerous political fragmentation.", "authors": ["Pamela Rolfe", "James Mcauley", "Foreign Correspondent Focusing On French", "European Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ejZMuu_oaD6WxwMCjUhMmqn-Dr8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/IHHNUCXWJQI6TLMLQXRKUAFVZY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
