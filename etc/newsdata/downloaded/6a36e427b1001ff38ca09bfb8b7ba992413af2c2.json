Then the 16-year-old Ohio high school student found out her race didn't count.\n\nAbukaram was disqualified from her team's meet for wearing a hijab while in competition. A practicing Muslim who attends private Islamic school in Sylvania, Ohio, Abukaram competes in athletics for the local public school, Northview High School.\n\n\"It was like your worst nightmare to have to compete and then find out that you got disqualified and it's because of something that you love,\" Abukaram told CNN. \"Why should you have to sacrifice your religion and a part of who you are to run, to do another thing that you're very passionate about?\"\n\nNFL TRADE DEADLINE:Five teams that should be buyers and five that should be sellers\n\nNOT ENOUGH:Astros must pay a steeper price for lies\n\nAbukaram told several news media outlets she had competed in six meets this season without any problems. She also said officials did not address her hijab immediately after the race. Meet officials told her that her coach ultimately didn't fill out the correct paperwork.\n\n\u201cWhen (her coach) told me that, I was like, what do you mean I have to have a signed waiver for me to race?\u201d she told The New York Times. \u201cThey don\u2019t have to prepare anything special for me, I don\u2019t have any disabilities, I am just running just like anybody else. When he said that, I didn\u2019t think, \u2018Oh, Coach, why didn\u2019t you do this?\u2019 I thought, \u2018Why do we even have to do this in the first place?\u2019\u201d\n\nIn an emotional Facebook post, Abukaram wrote, in part: \"I feel like my rights as an athlete were violated this weekend. ....I should not have to get a waiver signed and approved by OSAA to allow me to race due to my religious head covering.\"\n\nTim Stried, a spokesman for the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA), told USA TODAY in a statement Friday that the organization had been examining the rule and was considering dropping the waiver requirement.\n\n\u201cThe student-athlete can run this weekend at regionals, and the OHSAA is also already looking at this specific uniform regulation to modify it in the future so that religious headwear does not require a waiver,\" Stried's statement read.\n\n\"If the coach or school had obtained the waiver previously, all this could have been avoided. The race official was simply enforcing this rule since a waiver had not been submitted. After the race, the OHSAA communicated with the school, which then submitted a waiver request. The request was approved immediately. This emphasizes our continual requirement to also assist in educating our coaches on all sport rules. We support the student-athlete and wish her the best of luck this weekend at regionals.\u201d\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic presidential candidate, heard about the situation and expressed her criticism of the school on Thursday over Twitter, blasting \"discriminatory dress codes.\"\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got your back, Noor,\u201d Warren wrote. \u201cEvery kid should be able to feel safe and welcome at school \u2014 and Muslim students should never be denied participation in school activities.\u201d", "description": "Noor Alexandria Abukaram ran a personal-best time at cross-country meet Saturday, but it didn't count because she didn't have waiver to wear a hijab.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/25/USAT/d3f38fd3-881e-448a-bdff-27013ec39c28-noor_1.jpg?crop=347,617,x82,y167&width=284&height=617&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
