They chastise me that babies are expensive and that I'll regret it later.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAm I depriving people who just want to celebrate? Am I being a pill? Or is it perfectly fine for me to just smile and say, \"I'm not going to have a baby shower right now, but I'd love to get together with you!\"\n\n\u2014 Six Months and Counting\n\nSix Months and Counting: Your husband, family, friends, co-workers and any well-meaning others need to butt right out. Immediately. So please tell your husband this explicitly, and ask him please to get the word out to others on your behalf.\n\nThe pressure for you to say yes to a shower you don\u2019t want would be inappropriate under any circumstances, but it is particularly frustrating when you\u2019re clearly sorting through bigger emotional stuff.\n\nAD\n\nYou don\u2019t seem to be on the path to regrets about going party-free, not even a little bit. But if you do surprise yourself with second thoughts, then there\u2019s a much easier remedy available to you than the preemptive stress of a grudging yes: a shower after the baby is born. (A \u201cSip and See,\u201d if it must be named.) Only if and only when you want it. A favorite-children\u2019s-book theme would help head off superfluous stuff.\n\nAD\n\nMy condolences for your loss, and best wishes for a healthy birth.\n\nHi, Carolyn: I've always dreamed of writing a book. Not the great American novel but of the fictional-romance genre, using my personal memoirs as a basis \u2014 sexy, but not porn. It is what I know, and I have enough plotlines to do a few books. There were many men in my life, as I married late.\n\nAD\n\nMy husband is very private, and I am an open book. Since I am writing about myself, he doesn't support the new career and wants me to consider writing something less controversial, like history, travel, cookbooks. My plan was to use an assumed name, but even this doesn't placate him.\n\nThis has been my dream for years, and now he won't even discuss it with me. Should I continue and publish without his knowledge, or is that like being unfaithful? My first book is almost finished, but I'm in a quandary.\n\nAD\n\n\u2014 Stymied\n\nStymied: You\u2019re looking at steep and unwelcome consequences regardless: publish quietly and lie by omission; publish with your husband\u2019s knowledge and risk alienation; don\u2019t publish and deny your dreams.\n\nAD\n\nGiven the high emotional stakes, no one can or should tell you there\u2019s a right answer. There is only what you can live with in relative peace.\n\nThat said, I hope you\u2019ll think carefully about two things: First, it\u2019s wonderful that you\u2019re an \u201copen book\u201d and lived many sexy story lines; good for you. However, it would have been just as easy for you to write erotica without spelling out for your \u201cvery private\u201d husband that you\u2019re basically writing your sexual memoirs. It\u2019s not dishonest to be discreet.\n\nIt\u2019s a little late now, but you still can assure your husband, yes, that anything you write is a fictionalized account?\n\nAD\n\nSecond, you are under no obligation to compromise your artistic vision \u2014 and, again, this isn\u2019t about avoiding consequences; it\u2019s about choosing the ones you can live with. Maybe you\u2019re ready to bare all and bear all. But a pseudonym and some conceptual airbrushing are reasonable accommodations for your husband\u2019s concerns. Is he willing to meet you partway as well, giving up something he\u2019d prefer in order to meet your needs? And if not, then does that change your math at all toward what you\u2019re willing to give up for him?\n\nWrite to Carolyn Hax at tellme@washpost.com.
