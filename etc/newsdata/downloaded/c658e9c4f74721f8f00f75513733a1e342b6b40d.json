The people could also be seen bursting crackers before 8 PM, however, the intensity remained low.\n\nWith Delhi's air quality plummeting to dangerous levels around Diwali every year, the Supreme Court in 2018 banned polluting firecrackers and ordered that only green firecrackers, which is said to cause 30 per cent less pollution, can be manufactured and sold.\n\nAccording to reports, stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana have doubled in the last 48 hours, adding to the woes of Delhiites.\n\nBut the green pyrotechnics have failed to draw good response both from sellers and buyers, primarily due to lack of variety, limited stock and high prices.\n\nLast year too, people continued to buy the conventional firecrackers and use them.\n\nWhereas Delhi has been impacted once again by pollution during Diwali, other parts of the country were largely unaffected, according to the Centre For Science And Environment (CSE), which quoted data from aqi.in.\n\nAir Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR) had already warned in advance that lighting up even half the fire crackers than in 2018 could pull down AQI to \u2018severe\u2019 in Delhi NCR.\n\nNow, the festival is over, we have woken up to exactly that in Delhi and surrounding regions.\n\nWith PTI Inputs", "description": "After Celebrating Diwali, Delhi Wakes Up To 'Severe' Air Quality.
