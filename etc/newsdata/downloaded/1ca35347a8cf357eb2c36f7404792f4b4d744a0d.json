And experts have warned that more cuts could well follow.\n\nFrom today, savers in Barclays Instant Cash Isa will earn just 0.4 per cent on sums up to \u00a330,000 \u2014 or a paltry \u00a34 interest on every \u00a31,000 in the account.\n\nIt means they are now earning the same as nearly three years ago when the Bank of England base rate stood at a rock-bottom 0.25 per cent against 0.75 per cent today.\n\nThose with between \u00a330,000 and \u00a3100,000 in the Barclays account will earn even less at 0.45 per cent, down from 0.65 per cent.\n\nHSBC\u2019s standard rate on its Loyalty Isa is dropping to 0.5 per cent from December 18.\n\nLast month Lloyds cut its Instant Cash Isa rate from 0.35 per cent to 0.2 per cent.\n\nOther cuts in the pipeline include Tesco Bank; its Instant Access Cash Isa rate will nearly halve from 0.65 per cent to 0.35 per cent from October 24.\n\nTSB now pays only 0.15 per cent on its Cash Isa Saver following cuts last month.\n\nRachel Springall, finance expert at Moneyfacts, says: \u2018Savers will be disappointed with the worst Isa season for three years.\u2019\n\nThe average rate on easy-access cash Isas is down at 0.95 per cent compared with 0.98 per cent in April (the time of year when savers qualify for a new annual Isa allowance).\n\nFor this tax year you can save up to \u00a320,000 in these tax-free accounts.\n\nNatWest, the only bank out of the big four not to cut its rates so far, already pays a miserly 0.2 per cent on balances up to \u00a310,000 and 0.85 per cent on \u00a350,000 or more.\n\nOther popular accounts such as Halifax Instant Isa Saver also pays just 0.2 per cent.\n\nSavers should seriously consider switching their money to another provider for a better rate.\n\nFamily BS pays 1.34 per cent on its Market Tracker Saver available online, by post or through its branch in Epsom, Surrey.\n\nThe rate is set at the average of the 20 best rates plus 0.05 percentage points.\n\nIt would earn you an extra \u00a3131 a year more in interest on each \u00a310,000 compared to if you left it in TSB\u2019s account paying 0.15 per cent.\n\nWith Coventry BS Limited Access Isa the rate is a higher 1.46 per cent, but you are limited to making three withdrawals a year.\n\nThe rate is also boosted by a 0.31 per cent bonus until January 2021 when the rate drops to 1.15 per cent. It\u2019s available online, by post or in its branches.\n\nTo switch your cash Isa, ask your new provider to arrange the transfer for you.\n\nsy.morris@dailymail.co.uk", "description": "Experts say it is the worst cash Isa season in three years, with rates tumbling to 0.15 per cent.
