(Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)\n\nThe NBA offseason was as wild as everyone expected it to be, but the biggest coup may have been pulled off by the Los Angeles Clippers. They signed Kawhi Leonard and traded for Paul George from the Oklahoma City Thunder, and are poised to challenge the Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors in the West.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t easy to pull off, as Clippers coach Doc Rivers revealed when he spoke at a recent non-profit event, via the Los Anegeles Times. The Clippers had tried to let Leonard know that they were interested during the season by sending executives to Toronto Raptors games to sit in the crowd. Rivers even tried to talk to Leonard a few times when they were passing, but Leonard didn\u2019t even acknowledge him.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThings picked up once they met with Leonard in person. Rivers recounted what Leonard said to him and owner Steve Ballmer in that meeting, via the Los Angeles Times:\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I want to play for you,\u2019 and he pointed at me. He said, \u2018Mr. Ballmer, I love the things you do and what you stand for, but your team is not good enough and if you don\u2019t change your team, I\u2019m not coming.\u2019\u201d\n\nRivers said that they had already prepared a list of players to give to Leonard, but when they did, he fixated on just one name: Paul George.\n\n\u201cWe showed him everybody else and he didn\u2019t want to hear it. He just stayed on Paul George, so after the meeting we sat down and I said, \u2018We got to get Paul George. I don\u2019t know how we are going to do it, but we have to do it.\u2019\u201d\n\nNot knowing if they could trade for George didn\u2019t mean they weren\u2019t going to try. The offer they put together was overwhelming: five first-round draft picks spanning five of the next seven years, the option to swap picks in 2023 and 2025, and two Clippers players who had been selected in the first round.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt was a lot. It was so much that even the brash Ballmer wasn\u2019t totally on board. But Rivers found a way to convince him that it was the best way to get what they wanted.\n\n\u201cSteve Ballmer was nervous about the picks. I said, \u2018Steve, you keep saying six picks for Paul George is insane, but you\u2019re saying it wrong. It\u2019s not six for Paul; it\u2019s six for Paul and Kawhi. So three for each. I would do that.\u2019 You have to look at it in those terms.\u201d\n\nRivers\u2019 brilliant argument sold Ballmer on the trade package (even though it ended up being five picks with the option for two more). The deal fell apart a few times before it actually got done \u2014 at noon on the day the trade went through, there was no deal. Rivers had heard that Leonard might be signing with the Lakers, which he considered to be the doomsday scenario.\n\n\u201cI actually told Steve jokingly that if that happens, we\u2019re moving the team to Seattle. It was a joke, but I was actually serious about it. I really believed that.\u201d\n\nBut by the end of that day, the Thunder got their picks, the Clippers got their men, and Doc Rivers was instrumental in making it happen.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "When Clippers owner Steve Ballmer balked at the trade package for Paul George, Doc Rivers found the perfect argument to convince him.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SWnYLXK__LcMSjfgRe0vHQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD05ODIuNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8BDC48QicoWerEDx4buM9A--~B/aD0yNDEyO3c9MzE0NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-07/9b1e9090-af8a-11e9-979f-7cff3b409cac", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
