A partisan hit job does not make you a whistleblower just because you go through the Whistleblower Protection Act,\u201d Miller said.\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nThen Wallace cut to video of the Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire testifying before Congress that the whistleblower and the Inspector General have \u201cacted in good faith throughout\u201d and have done everything \u201cby the book and followed the law.\u201d\n\nHe then asked Miller, \u201cOn what basis do you think this is a partisan hit job?\u201d\n\nMiller refused to back down, describing the whistleblower\u2019s report as a \u201cseven-page Nancy Drew novel\u201d that \u201cdrips with condescension, righteous indignation and contempt for the president.\u201d\n\nAgain, Wallace reminded Miller that the Inspector General found the allegations to be \u201ccredible.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they\u2019re wrong, Chris,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThis is a deep state operative, pure and simple\u2026 You have a group of unelected bureaucrats who think that they need to take down this president\u2026 publish hit pieces, they publish fake stories.\u201d\n\nWallace interjected. \u201cThe president has the State Department. He\u2019s got the CIA. He\u2019s got the Pentagon. He\u2019s got a number of other agencies. Why did he use three private lawyers to get information on Biden from the Ukrainian government rather than go through all of the agencies of his government?\u201d\n\nMiller, true to form, tried to obfuscate, but Wallace held his ground, insisting Miller answer his question directly. \u201cI understand that you have your question, I have my answer,\u201d Miller said.\n\nThis prompted Wallace to say, \u201cYou have your non-answer at this point.\u201d\n\n\"You have your non-answer\" \u2014 watch Chris Wallace grill Stephen Miller about why Trump thought it was appropriate to use his private attorney to dig up dirt on Biden \u2014 and not let Miller get away with obfuscating. pic.twitter.com/wKr1fpIX5Z \u2014 Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) September 29, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nLater, Wallace became frustrated again, saying, \u201cWith all due respect, this is an exercise in obfuscation. Why did the president go against his own Pentagon and State Department?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tone of judgment in all of your questions,\u201d Miller replied before going on to say that, in actuality, \u201cThe president is the whistleblower here. The president of the United States is the whistleblower. And this individual is a saboteur trying to undermine a democratically elected government.\u201d\n\nWALLACE: How specifically did the Bidens break the law in Ukraine?

Jim Jordan attempted to do on State of the Union, it\u2019s clear Trump\u2019s surrogates have been sent out to spin and distract from the actual issues in an attempt to frame the whistleblower and resulting impeachment inquiry as partisan. But it\u2019s too late. The transcripts are out. The president\u2019s actions are clear. And even the American people, including nearly a third of Republicans, are shifting towards supporting the impeachment inquiry.\n\nSee where your favorite artists and songs rank on the Rolling Stone Charts.\n\n\n\nSign up for Rolling Stone\u2019s Newsletter.
