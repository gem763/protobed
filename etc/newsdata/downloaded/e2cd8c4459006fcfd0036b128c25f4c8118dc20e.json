Photo: Alex Wroblewski/Getty Images\n\nEven before Friday, when the Washington Post reported that one of Joe Biden\u2019s go-to stories on the campaign trail is full of half-truths and inaccuracies, the former vice-president\u2019s penchant for gaffes and misstatements were drawing close attention from the pundit class.\n\nAfter the Post published its article, which exposed the problems with a story Biden often tells of pinning a Silver Star on a soldier in Afghanistan, the attention increased. So did the number Biden allies jumping to his defense. Former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell wrote on The Hill that the average voter doesn\u2019t care about gaffes. Former DNC chair Donna Brazile said on Fox News that Biden\u2019s \u201cjumbled\u201d thoughts could happen to anybody. \u201cSometimes when you have a lot of information in your brain and you try to put it out your mouth, it comes across like you are jumbling the story,\u201d she said.\n\nCNN\u2019s Michael Smerconish said he forgave Biden because there was \u201cno puffery\u201d in Biden\u2019s cobbled-together tale. And New York Times columnist David Brooks defended Biden by saying that at least his false statements were not \u201cmendacious\u201d or \u201cirresponsible.\u201d\n\nFinally on Monday, Biden spoke out in his own defense. After previously telling a South Carolina paper that the war story was fine because the \u201cessence\u201d is accurate, he told NPR that he wasn\u2019t trying to mislead with his version of events. And anyway, he added, the relative accuracy of his campaign stories \u201care irrelevant in terms of decision-making.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat has nothing to do with judgment of whether or not you send troops to war, the judgment of whether you bring someone home, the judgment of whether you decide on a health-care policy,\u201d he said on the NPR Politics Podcast and Iowa Public Radio.\n\nThis is the common refrain from Biden defenders. Yes, he may say some silly things here and there. He may exaggerate and jumble stories. He may even let slip an accidentally racist remark. But this is an obsession of the media, not the people. And anyway, Biden\u2019s heart is in the right place, unlike the current occupant of the White House.\n\nIt\u2019s also what CBS News heard when reporters asked voters in South Carolina about Biden\u2019s string of cringe-inducing gaffes. \u201cHe\u2019s human. It makes him real, not scripted,\u201d one said. \u201cI think his heart is in the right place and that\u2019s what we need right now,\u201d said another. Another added: \u201cI don\u2019t think he does anything more than the average person would do. And I think that\u2019s what makes him likable.\u201d\n\nWhat this analysis misses is that the GOP, and especially the Trump campaign, will not be eager to give Biden the same benefit of the doubt. Instead, if he\u2019s the nominee, every slip of the tongue or overstatement will be another piece of evidence of what Breitbart News called Biden\u2019s \u201ccognitive decline.\u201d Trump himself has already started on it. And the media will be there at every step to catalogue each misstep. That will help build a narrative, and once narratives take hold they\u2019re hard to let go.\n\nThe bad news for Team Biden is that this narrative is already catching on. The best evidence for that comes from the publication that helped craft the persona of Biden as a fun-loving, Busch-drinking, Trans Am\u2013driving uncle.
