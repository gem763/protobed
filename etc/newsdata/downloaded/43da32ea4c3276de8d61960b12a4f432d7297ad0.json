(Niko Tavernise/Warner Bros.)\n\nTheaters nationwide have started to sell tickets for the highly anticipated film \u201cJoker\u201d ahead of its Oct. 4 release, with one notable exception: Century Aurora and XD \u2014 the Cinemark venue that was the site of deadly mass shooting seven years ago during a midnight screening of \u201cThe Dark Knight Rises.\u201d\n\nThe new film won\u2019t play at the Aurora, Colo., theater, previously known as Century 16. Reached early Tuesday afternoon, a manager indicated the decision had been made at the corporate level and declined to speak further. Cinemark has not yet responded to The Washington Post\u2019s requests for comment.\n\n\u201cJoker,\u201d director Todd Phillips\u2019s R-rated take on the Batman villain, is also based on DC Comics characters but otherwise unaffiliated with Christopher Nolan\u2019s \u201cDark Knight\u201d trilogy. Earlier this month, it took home the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, where it received largely positive reviews from critics. Much of the praise has been directed at Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s portrayal of the mentally ill title character.\n\nBut the film has also been the subject of much speculation and worry over its gritty, realistic depictions of violence. Family members of those affected by the Aurora shooting \u2014 during which a gunman murdered 12 people and injured 70 \u2014 sent a letter to Warner Bros. expressing their concerns and asking the studio to donate to groups that support gun violence victims, according to the Hollywood Reporter and Variety.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on you to be a part of the growing chorus of corporate leaders who understand that they have a social responsibility to keep us safe,\u201d the letter reads. It does not ask for Warner Bros. to halt the film\u2019s release or for anyone to boycott it but, instead, calls for the studio to, among similar actions, \u201cend political contributions to candidates who take money from the NRA and vote against gun reform.\u201d\n\nThe shooting was \u201cperpetrated by a socially isolated individual who felt \u2018wronged\u2019 by society,\u201d the letter reportedly states. \u201cAs a result, we have committed ourselves to ensuring that no other family ever has to go through the absolute hell we have experienced and the pain we continue to live with.\"\n\nIn a statement shared Tuesday evening with The Post, Warner Bros. extended its \u201cdeepest sympathy\u201d to victims and families affected by gun violence, calling it a \u201ccritical issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur company has a long history of donating to victims of violence, including Aurora, and in recent weeks, our parent company joined other business leaders to call on policymakers to enact bi-partisan legislation to address this epidemic,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cAt the same time, Warner Bros. believes that one of the functions of storytelling is to provoke difficult conversations around complex issues. Make no mistake: neither the fictional character Joker, nor the film, is an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind. It is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s somewhat unusual for such fervent debate over a film\u2019s societal implications to precede its release, but many of those worried about \u201cJoker,\u201d like the letter\u2019s writers, have drawn a connection between how the character violently responds to his feelings of isolation and how other people have done so in real life. Phoenix, who walked out of an interview after being asked if the film could encourage people to become violent, addressed the concern while speaking to IGN.\n\n\u201cWell, I think that, for most of us, you\u2019re able to tell the difference between right and wrong,\u201d Phoenix said. \u201cAnd those that aren\u2019t are capable of interpreting anything in the way that they may want to. People misinterpret lyrics from songs. They misinterpret passages from books. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the responsibility of a filmmaker to teach the audience morality or the difference between right or wrong.\u201d\n\nPhillips told IGN he finds such concerns \u201cbizarre.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe movie makes statements about a lack of love, childhood trauma, lack of compassion in the world. I think people can handle that message,\u201d he said, later adding: \u201cTo me, art can be complicated, and oftentimes art is meant to be complicated. If you want uncomplicated art, you might want to take up calligraphy, but filmmaking will always be a complicated art.\u201d\n\nIn the Hollywood Reporter piece, Aurora survivor Pierce O\u2019Farrill recounted suffering from a panic attack while in a movie theater earlier this year. It had nothing to do with the movie, he said, but \u201cyou just never know what can trigger it, and I sympathize with those folks who are concerned about this film.\u201d\n\nTom Sullivan, a Democratic state representative whose son died in the shooting, doesn\u2019t believe the film will \u201cjump-start somebody\u201d to commit violent acts but said he would be in favor of Warner Bros. adding \u201ca blurb to the end or beginning of the movie about directing people to organizations for mental health.\u201d\n\nThis post has been updated.", "description": "The theater where the shooting occurred will not be showing Joaquin Phoenix's new film.", "authors": ["Sonia Rao", "Pop Culture Reporter", "September At Pm", "Sonia Rao Is A Pop Culture Reporter.
