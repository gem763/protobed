(AP) - Mississippi has had to quickly recover and try to put a heartbreaking loss at home to a ranked team.\n\nThe last-second loss to No. 15 California still lingers, the Rebels have to turn their attention to second-ranked Alabama - which has yet to be challenged.\n\nThat difficult challenge left the Rebels no time for self-pity after losing 28-20 to Cal when backup quarterback John Rhys Plumlee was stopped for no gain at the 1-yard line as time expired.\n\n\u201cI think he scored, but it\u2019s time for us to move on and get ready for Alabama,\u201d Ole Miss coach Matt Luke said.\n\nThat\u2019s enough of a challenge for the 38-point underdog Rebels (2-2, 1-0 Southeastern Conference). Alabama (4-0, 1-0) has won each of its game by at least 24 points, including the Crimson Tide\u2019s league opener at South Carolina.\n\nTide coach Nick Saban said Ole Miss is \u201carguably the best team we\u2019ve played so far this year.\u201d But the Rebels\u2019 starting quarterback, Matt Corral, left the Cal game with bruised ribs, leaving his status uncertain.\n\nWith its QB hurting, Ole Miss will try to slow down Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa , who has matched the school record of five touchdown passes in each of the past two games.\n\nAlabama has won the past three meetings but Ole Miss did pull off back-to-back upsets in the 2014 and 2015 games.\n\nSome other things to watch for in this game:\n\nCORRAL OR PLUMLEE?\n\nAlabama is having to prepare for two different quarterbacks in case Corral isn\u2019t able to go, and Luke is hoping their differing styles makes that harder. Plumlee replaced Corral late and completed all seven of his pass attempts for 82 yards.\n\n\u201cThe quarterback\u2019s playing really well for them,\u201d Saban said. \u201cThe backup quarterback came in and played even better in the game last week.\u201d\n\nRECEIVING QUARTET\n\nThe Rebels are facing the dilemma of every defense against Alabama: How to contain the Tide\u2019s receiving foursome of Jerry Jeudy , Henry Ruggs III, DeVonta Smith and Jaylen Waddle. Not to mention tailback Najee Harris, who has three touchdown catches and only one rushing score.\n\n\u201cThey are very, very talented and very hard to defend,\u201d Luke said. \u201cObviously, they are really, really fast and get behind you. The thing you see is even on some short routes, they are breaking tackles and scoring. They are hard to tackle in the open field. You have to tackle well against them and limit the big plays and make them earn it all the way down the field.\u201d\n\nALABAMA INJURIES\n\nAlabama seems likely to get back two injured defenders, nose guard DJ Dale and linebacker Terrell Lewis. Placekicker Will Reichard might take longer, which means the Tide will likely turn to former starter Joseph Bulovas.\n\nPRESSURING TUA\n\nTagovailoa has been good at releasing the ball quickly, but Ole Miss has excelled in getting to opposing quarterbacks. The Rebels are second in the SEC averaging three sacks per game. Their average of eight tackles for loss leads the league.\n\n\u201cTheir defense has been a lot more aggressive this year in terms of creating negative plays, sacks, tackles for loss,\u201d Saban said.\n\nBROWN\u2019S RETURN\n\nAlabama guard Deonte Brown is eligible after serving a four-game NCAA-imposed suspension, but Saban makes it clear reclaiming his starting job isn\u2019t automatic.\n\n\u201cThe plan for every player on our team is the guy\u2019s got to beat someone out if he wants to play,\u201d the coach said. \u201cI mean, nobody\u2019s entitled to play.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mississippi has had to quickly recover and try to put a heartbreaking loss at home to a ranked team.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "John Zenor"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/27/california_mississippi_football_34304_c0-166-2443-1590_s1770x1032.jpg?980d5c8e09376746982981d9fd75e1ba8ef25e2f", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
