When the projector is not turned on, the screen is basically a MASSIVE grey rectangle sitting on your wall, behind a not-all-that-attractive and quite-large black box (the projector console itself).\n\nWhichever way you look at it, it's a large black box.\n\nSamsung and LG are going to great lengths to dream up ways to conceal even 75-inch LCD and OLED TVs when they\u2019re not in use, by turning them the colour of the wallpaper, or turning them into artworks. But there is no hiding this MASSIVE grey rectangle. It doesn\u2019t have a camouflage mode. Depending on your tastes, you might need to hide it in a room other than your main living room.\n\nOn the plus side, it\u2019s absolutely MASSIVE, and will impress those who you most need to impress, especially if you invite them over during the day to watch sport.\n\nHighlights and light tones are pleasant and accurate on this projector, but once you\u2019re down into deeper tones, things get murkier.\n\nThe projector on this Hisense TV/not TV is extraordinarily bright (more than 3500 lumens, which is a large number by domestic projector standards), and even during the day (when a lot of sport is on) the picture is very watchable.\n\nI reviewed the LN60D in a house so bright, all that sunlight eventually gave me a migraine. Either that or it was the rainbows flashing in front of my eyes for hours on end later that evening. But in any case, the TV/not TV was surprisingly good in the brightest of bright rooms in the house, where other projectors (or indeed many other TVs) would be washed out.\n\nWith bright ambient light you\u2019ll never see blacks any darker than the mid-grey ambient-light-rejecting (ALR) screen the image is projected onto, of course, but your mind quickly adjusts to that, and all in all it\u2019s very impressive.\n\nNow you know why a minute number of viewers may find themselves singing frog songs in the shower...\n\n(For those of you who suffer from the Rainbow Effect, it\u2019s worth noting that I only suffered from it when reviewing the TV/not TV at night, when the ambient light was dim enough to allow for the sort of high-contrast image that is usually associated with the rainbows. During the day, nary a rainbow was to be seen.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlightly less impressive than the image brightness, however, is the colour accuracy of the Hisense TV/not TV. Highlights and light tones (such as paler skin tones) are pleasant and accurate on this projector, but once you\u2019re down into deeper tones, things can get a little murkier.\n\nBlacks tend to crush down, so you lose a bit of shadow detail compared to high-end (though much, much smaller) OLED and LCD TVs, and the colours tend to become less accurate as well.\n\nThere\u2019s way too much blue in the deeper reds for my tastes, for instance. I spent about 20 minutes trying to balance out the excess blues using the LN60D\u2019s fairly comprehensive calibration system, but I could never fix it. (In fact I only made a mess of things and had to reset it.) If I was spending $20,000 to buy this TV, I'd probably spend another $1000 or so to get it calibrated by someone who knows what they\u2019re doing.\n\nOr maybe I\u2019d wait for an upcoming model of the Hisense TV/not TV to come out, the L9 TriChroma, which is going to have three laser beams generating the projected light, instead of two, and which by virtue of those three beams ought to have better colour accuracy out of the box.\n\n8K would be expensive overkill, especially when there are more pressing matters to address...\n\nThe upcoming model should also have a slightly more sophisticated smart TV operating system that supports things like voice control, though it must be said the operating system on this year\u2019s model (which is actually last year\u2019s model, due to a delay in getting it to Australia) is perfectly decent and easy to use.\n\nIt supports the basic apps, such as Netflix, Stan and Plex, and for anything else (such as Foxtel\u2019s Kayo for the sports mad) you can just plug a Chromecast dongle into one of the TV\u2019s four HDMI ports.\n\nThere is an issue that even the L9 TriChroma model won\u2019t address, however: 8K.\n\nWe mostly think that 8K, which has four times the number of pixels as a regular UHD TV, is something of a crock of shit. At most real-world viewing distances, UHD is more than enough resolution for most people. (Remember, it was only a few years ago that the companies that are now singing the praises of 8K TV were telling you that UHD pixels were invisible even when you sat really close to the screen.)\n\nThere is one exception to this: really, really big screens, where even UHD pixels get large enough to be noticeable at normal viewing distances.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHisense\u2019s MASSIVE 100-inch TV/Not TV is as good an argument for 8K as you\u2019re going to get right now. Sitting close but not too close, and donning my sharpest eye glasses, it\u2019s true that I was able to make out individual pixels in the projected image if I looked for them, meaning an 8K version of this TV/not TV might well be called for, for anyone with very good eyesight who likes to sit at the close end of normal viewing distances.\n\nBut for the rest of us, Hisense\u2019s decision to stick with UHD for this 100-inch TV/not TV is perfectly OK. 8K would be expensive overkill, especially given that price is one of its big selling points, and especially when there are more pressing matters to address, like colour accuracy, and the rainbow effect.\n\nYou can see where I\u2019m going with this.\n\nFor some of us, 8K would be a crock at the end of a rainbow.\n\nHISENSE LN60D UHD TV\n\nLikes Huge, bright, sharp picture\n\nDislikes Colours (especially reds) can be a little off without calibration.\n\nSome people (me!) may see rainbows\n\nPrice $19,999 including delivery and installation in some areas", "description": "Even if you could find a TV this big, you probably wouldn\u2019t be able to afford it.
