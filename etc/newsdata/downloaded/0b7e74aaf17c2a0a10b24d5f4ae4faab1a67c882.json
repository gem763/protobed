It will then tour across the United Kingdom and internationally, including in Canada, Spain, the United States, Australia and Germany.", "description": "Chinese Yongqing Bao named Wildlife Photographer of the Year in a ceremony at London's Natural History Museum.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/16/1f7f80bcec754251b3c5b45dde068734_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
