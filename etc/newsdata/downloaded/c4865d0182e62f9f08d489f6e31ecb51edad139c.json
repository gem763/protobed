Rep. Jordan said that there are several questions that need to be answered regarding Pelosi, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA), and the intelligence officer \u201cwhistleblower.\u201d\n\nThere has been a lot of noise since @SpeakerPelosi decided to call for impeachment before having the facts. Here are a few important questions:\n\nJordan asked:\n\nWhy did the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d write an 800+ word memo describing President Trump and President Zelensky\u2019s call based on second-hand information gleaned from a conversation that lasted just a few minutes?\n\nWhy did the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d wait 18 days to file the complaint after describing the call as \u201cfrightening\u201d in their memo?\n\nWhy and when did the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d communicate with @RepAdamSchiff \u2019s staff before filing the complaint?\n\nWhy did the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d hide from the ICIG [Intelligence Community Inspector General] that they met with @repadamschiff \u2019s staff by not checking the box on the whistleblower form indicating they had spoken to Congress?\n\nWhy didn\u2019t @RepAdamSchiff tell us his staff had met with the \u201cwhistleblower?\u201d\n\nWhy didn\u2019t the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d just give his memo to the Inspector General, instead of a seven-page complaint dressed up with extraneous citations and media references?\n\nWhy is @RepAdamSchiff holding hearings, depositions, and interviews behind closed doors?\n\nWhy won\u2019t @RepAdamSchiff release the transcripts of these interviews, instead of leaking cherry-picked information that fits his narrative?\n\nWhy does @SpeakerPelosi think we need to \u201cstrike while the iron is hot,\u201d instead of taking time for serious and thorough investigative fact-finding?\n\nWhy is @SpeakerPelosi scared to have a vote to open an official impeachment inquiry like it\u2019s been done every other time?\n\nWhy do Democrats keep making up the rules as they go along, instead of following a fair process?\n\nWhat work did the \u201cwhistleblower\u201d do with a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate?\n\nWhy do Democrats and the media keep falsely claiming President Trump pressured Ukraine? President Zelensky has repeatedly said that he wasn\u2019t pushed.\n\nWhy don\u2019t Democrats trust the American people to choose the President? The election is less than 13 months away.", "description": "Jim Jordan (R-OH) said Saturday that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) decided to call for impeachment \"before having the facts.\"", "authors": ["Sean Moran"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Nancy-Pelosi-hand-out-press-conference-October-2-2019-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
