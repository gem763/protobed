(AP) - Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said Tuesday night that her work on the bench saved her during her cancer treatments, as the judge was given a rock-star reception in the home state of the president who nominated her to the nation\u2019s highest court.\n\nGinsburg told a packed arena that she was \u201cfeeling very good tonight,\u201d following the 86-year-old\u2019s disclosure last month that she had completed three weeks of outpatient radiation therapy for a cancerous tumor on her pancreas and is now disease-free. It was the fourth time over the past two decades that Ginsburg, the leader of the court\u2019s liberal wing, has been treated for cancer. She had colorectal cancer in 1999, pancreatic cancer in 2009 and lung cancer surgery in December.\n\n\u201cI think my work is what saved me because instead of dwelling on my physical discomforts if I have an opinion to write or a brief to read, I know I\u2019ve just got to get it done so I have to get over it,\u201d she said during a one-hour interview on stage with NPR Reporter Nina Totenberg at Verizon Arena. About 13,000 attended the event, which was hosted by the Clinton Foundation and the University of Arkansas\u2019 Clinton School of Public Service, and more had been on a waiting list to attend.\n\nThe lecture had been moved to the arena to accommodate the crowd and was sandwiched between a concert by \u201cWeird Al\u201d Yankovic over the weekend and KISS on Thursday.\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton praised Ginsburg as he introduced her Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cI liked her and believed in her. I just knew she was the right person for the court,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cBut I have to say over the past 26 years she has far exceeded my expectations.\u201d\n\nClinton added he never expected Ginsburg to achieve the pop culture status she has, including a movie and a documentary released about her last year and products ranging from t-shirts to coffee mugs featuring her. Verizon Arena erupted into cheers as footage of Ginsburg\u2019s swearing-in was shown and the audience chanted \u201cRBG\u201d as she took the stage.\n\nTuesday\u2019s speech was the latest in a handful of public appearances Ginsburg has made since her radiation treatment was disclosed last month. Ginsburg\u2019s health has been watched closely by both conservatives and liberals since it\u2019s believed the court would shift to the right if President Donald Trump could nominate someone to replace her. Clinton alluded to that concern.\n\n\u201cAll of us hope that she will stay on the court forever,\u201d Clinton said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Andrew DeMillo on Twitter at www.twitter.com/ademillo\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said Tuesday night that her work on the bench saved her during her cancer treatments, as the judge was given a rock-star reception in the home state of the president who nominated her to the nation's highest court.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Andrew Demillo"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/08/31/scotus_ginsberg_book_festival_24908_c0-177-4231-2643_s1770x1032.jpg?7de7b9804d6003e18ba55d595cd02d288d5b0ec3"}
