The living room, which was designed by her longtime decorator Stephen Shadley, includes Midcentury furniture, fine art and a sophisticated black-and-white color scheme. The room also features a bar and a cozy lounge area.\n\n\u201cBonny and Clyde,\u201d the stylists captioned the sunny snap on Instagram.\n\nAniston\u2019s beloved terrier also got a shout out in the Times story, with Aniston remarking, \u201cI\u2019m like a weird dog person, it turns out, like a dog lady.\u201d\n\nOpening up about the design style of her home back in 2018, Aniston told Architectural Digest that \u201cSexy is important, but comfort is essential.\u201d\n\nAniston, who picked up the 1965 property in 2011 for $21 million, said the home was initially \u201cthe furthest thing from what I wanted\u201d aesthetically.\n\nAniston and Theroux, who announced their split in February 2018, spent two years renovating the property decorating it together with help from Shadley. The collaboration was a struggle at first for Aniston, who had designed her previous home solo.\n\n\u201cJustin definitely wanted to be involved, so there was a bit of a learning curve for me on how to include another voice in the design process,\u201d she admitted. \u201cFor instance, I figured out that immediately saying \u2018No!\u2019 to any suggestion is not the most collaborative move.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Inside the Home Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux Created Together\n\nThe remodeling resulted in rooms thoughtfully layered with Abstract Expressionist paintings, hand-painted wallpaper, and silk rugs, while outside, the grounds were reimagined to include terraces, pocket gardens and a stunning pool surrounded by a teak deck.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when I thought there was something romantic about picking up and trotting off somewhere different every three months. Now I\u2019m becoming more particular about the projects I take,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cthere\u2019s nowhere else I want to be.\u201d", "description": "Jennifer Aniston Strikes a Pose in Her $21 Million Bel Air Home", "authors": ["Maria Pasquini"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/e.TAE8nYSP6a.PMLO4.kug--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/a1355bfccd761ed428c7b0a44b0b8ff5", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
