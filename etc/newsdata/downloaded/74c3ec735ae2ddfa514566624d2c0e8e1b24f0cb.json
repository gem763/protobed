His stint with Kraft\u2019s Patriots lasted just 11 days and one game. Although he played in Week 2 after the filing of a lawsuit alleging rape and sexual assault in 2017 and 2018, he was cut after a Sports Illustrated report last week that he had allegedly threatened a second victim. Brown has not been arrested and he denies the allegations.\n\n\u201cKraft got caught in the parlor AB speculations fired different strokes different folks clearly,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nKraft got caught in the parlor AB speculations fired different strokes different folks clearly \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/eKrAE0Vwih \u2014 AB (@AB84) September 22, 2019\n\nIn response to his Patriots ouster, he will file a grievance, according to ESPN\u2019s Chris Mortensen, to get the $10 million guaranteed by New England. The NFL Players Association will represent him. However, personal misconduct can void guarantees, something contained in contracts in all sports leagues. His tweet about the Patriots owner isn\u2019t going to engender any goodwill with Kraft.\n\n[How the deal between Antonio Brown and the Patriots dissolved]\n\nBrown called out Roethlisberger, noting that he was suspended in 2010 for violating the NFL\u2019s personal conduct policy after being accused of sexually assaulting a Georgia college student following a night of drinking. He was the first player suspended under the NFL\u2019s personal conduct policy who was not arrested, charged with or convicted of a crime.\n\n\u201c4 games for Big Ben,\u201d he tweeted, \u201ccrazy world I\u2019m done with it.\u201d\n\n4 games for Big Ben crazy world I\u2019m done with it pic.twitter.com/ZXVZXzM4xh \u2014 AB (@AB84) September 22, 2019\n\nShannon Sharpe, the Hall of Famer who appears on FS1 and formerly appeared on CBS, was accused sexual assault and making threats by a former girlfriend in 2010. The charges were dismissed, but that report did not escape Brown, either.\n\nShannon Sharp the funny guy on tv \ud83d\udcfa still after this pic.twitter.com/ZlVvvOqKWg \u2014 AB (@AB84) September 22, 2019\n\nBrown continued with another tweet, sharing a link to a Daily Beast story about Sports Illustrated writer Robert Klemko allegedly being threatened by Patriots fans after he reported the second allegation, the one that led to Brown\u2019s release. \u201cSystem working effectively,\u201d he noted.\n\nRead more NFL coverage from The Post:\n\nChiefs-Ravens, Saints-Seahawks, Steelers-Niners highlight Week 3 NFL schedule\n\nHow Michael Vick\u2019s dogfighting case changed animal welfare\n\nNFL power rankings Week 3: Cowboys, Ravens move up as others suffer QB unrest\n\nBrewer: If Drew Brees and Ben Roethlisberger can\u2019t stay healthy, good luck to the NFL\n\nThe NFL\u2019s great quarterback transition is happening, and the most flexible teams will thrive", "description": "Cut by the New England Patriots on Friday, the wide receiver took to social media two days later.", "authors": ["Cindy Boren", "Reporter Covering Sports", "With An Emphasis On Politics", "National Stories", "September At Am", "Cindy Boren Arrived At The Post In As An Assignment Editor In Charge Of Baseball", "Nfl Redskins Coverage.
