Gali Tibbon/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\n\nNetanyahu made his allegations, which were short on details, as he hosted a senior U.S. delegation and following days of unusually voluble warnings in Israel that war could break out with Iran or its allies on more than one front.\n\nNeither Iran nor the Yemeni Houthi fighters it sponsors had an immediate response to Israel\u2019s allegation. The Houthis use missiles and drones in their war against a coalition led by neighboring Saudi Arabia but there is scant public indication they possess weapons capable of traveling the some 2,000 km (1,240 miles) to Israel.\n\n\u201cIran wants to develop precision-guided missiles that can hit any target in Israel within five to ten meters,\u201d Netanyahu said in a speech in Jerusalem.\n\n\u201cIran hopes to use Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen as bases to attack Israel with statistical missiles and precision-guided missiles. That is a great, great danger,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier, addressing reporters ahead of meetings with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and top White House adviser Jared Kushner, Netanyahu reiterated Israeli suspicions, shared by Washington, that Iran has been trying to refit the rocket arsenal of Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah with precision-guidance systems.\n\n\u201cThey seek also to develop that, and have already begun to put that in Yemen, with the goal of reaching Israel from there too,\u201d said Netanyahu, who has urged the Trump administration to step up sanctions on the Iranians over their nuclear program and regional activities.\n\nAides would not elaborate on whether Netanyahu, in his remarks with Mnuchin at his side, meant to say that missile-conversion facilities were being installed in Yemen or that missiles capable of reaching Israel were already there.\n\nAn Israeli government source held out the prospect that Israel could take action. \u201cThis will cause Israel to be extremely vulnerable and this is something that we cannot just sit by and watch happening,\u201d the source said.\n\nWith Israel in political deadlock after inconclusive elections in April and last month, Netanyahu has cited growing security concerns in urging his strongest rival, ex-general Benny Gantz, to form a broad coalition government.\n\n\u201cThis is not a spin, this is not a line, this is a real thing that is happening as the power balance in the Middle East changes,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cWe need a national unity government.\u201d\n\nIsrael\u2019s armed forces chief briefed Gantz about regional threats on Oct 16 and, last week, issued a public statement describing Israel\u2019s northern and southern fronts as \u201ctense and fragile and (liable to) deteriorate into conflict\u201d.\n\nWhen Israel refers to its northern front, it means Lebanon and more easterly Syria. \u201cSouthern front\u201d usually refers to the Gaza Strip, in the southwest, where Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants receive Iranian funds. Yemen is to Israel\u2019s southeast.\n\nA senior Iranian military official, Abbas Nilforoushan, told the Tasnim news agency on Sept 28 that Iran had \u201csurrounded it (Israel) from east, west, north and south\u201d.\n\nIsrael has signaled willingness to broaden its military campaign against suspected deployments by Iranian-fighters within striking distance of its borders. In addition to hundreds of Israeli bombing runs in Syria, Iranian-linked militias have accused Israel of carrying out attacks within Lebanon and Iraq.", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Iran on Monday of seeking the means to launch precision-guided missiles at Israel from Yemen, a signal that the war-torn Gulf Arab country could come under pre-emptive Israeli attack.", "authors": ["Dan Williams", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446007863&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R1AQ", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
