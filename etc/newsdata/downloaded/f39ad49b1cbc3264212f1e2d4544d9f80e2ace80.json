He agreed to a $500 fine and probation, avoiding a 30 day jail sentence.\n\nRavenel, who starred on Bravo\u2019s Southern Charm for 5 seasons, was accused of assaulting his children\u2019s nanny, Dawn Ledwell, in January of 2015. According to Ledwell, Ravenel attempted to kiss her, put her hand on his genitals, and forcibly remove her clothes while she was cleaning his home. Ledwell filed a police report in June of 2018 claiming that Ravenel had committed a \u201csexual offense\u201d and \u201cforcible rape.\u201d Ravenel was arrested that September.\n\nLedwell is not the first woman to accuse Ravenel of sexual assault. In 2018, real estate agent and model Ashley Perkins came forward on behalf of her mother, Debbie Holloway Perkins, whom she claimed Ravenel attempted to sexually assault and forcibly penetrate after a Tinder date in October of 2015. Ravenel ultimately settled with Holloway Perkins for $200,000. In the wake of these allegations, Bravo confirmed last year that Ravenel would not return for the 6th season of Southern Charm.", "description": "Former Southern Charm star Thomas Ravenel pleads guilty to third degree assault and battery charges in Charleston, South Carolina.", "authors": ["Chris Murphy"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/10/11-thomas-ravenel.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
