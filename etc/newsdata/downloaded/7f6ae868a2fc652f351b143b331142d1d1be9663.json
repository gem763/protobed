It can take up to 25 years to successfully breed a new variety of apple, according to Sean Myles, an associate professor of agriculture at Dalhousie.\n\nBreeders start by adding the pollen from one flower to the flower of another variety, which will produce a seed months later that the grower will then plant, he said.\n\nSean Myles was one of the founders of the Apple Biodiversity Collection, an orchard in Kentville, N.S., that boasts more than 1,000 varieties of apples. (Mary-Catherine McIntosh/CBC)\n\nThe careful growing and refining that follows can take years to turn into large-scale stocks.\n\nMyles and his team created the orchard as a resource for growers \"so that it takes less time and money and space to create new apple varieties that are tasty, [and] that achieve commercial success.\"\n\n\"Think of it as a kind of a United Nations of apples ... different apples from all over the world, as many different varieties as we can get a hold of, all in one place.\"\n\nThose varieties include an \"ancestor\" of modern-day apples from Kazakhstan, which Myles described as a \"tiny little yellow apple that goes soft pretty quickly, [and] wouldn't be a big hit in the grocery store today.\"\n\nThere are also Black Oxfords \u2014 \"not completely black, but it's as close to black as an apple is going to get: very, very, very dark purple,\" he said.\n\n'A blockbuster apple' ready to hit stores\n\nOne variety apple lovers won't have to wait long for is the Cosmic Crisp, which has been in development in Washington state since 1997, and will make its debut in grocery stores this fall.\n\nIt's the offspring of two varieties: the crunchy, sweet and tart Honeycrisp, and the juicy and disease-resistant Enterprise. Legal protections mean the apple can only be grown in Washington state until 2024, a deal that may be extended for a further 10 years.\n\n\"They're really banking on this being a blockbuster apple,\" said Myles, adding that it could supplant another popular variety, the Red Delicious.\n\nSean Myles described these small yellow apples, grown in N.S. but from Kazakhstan, as the ancestor of modern-day apples the world over. (Mary-Catherine McIntosh/CBC)\n\nThis apple became so popular because of its looks, but with the rise of apples like the Cosmic Crisp, \"we see that taste is starting to take over for looks, which is great,\" he said.\n\n\"Red Delicious is that apple that's beautiful on the outside, and garbage on the inside.\"\n\nMyles said some breeders are looking into red-fleshed apples, betting that the unusual colour would be a winner if the apple was also tasty, crunchy and stored well.\n\nApple expert can't eat apples\n\nPeople could \"make do\" with the apple varieties on the shelves today \u2014 but Myles argues, the same could be said of other products.\n\n\"Somebody is going to go out there and try to figure out how to make a better toothbrush, a better car and a better apple \u2014 we're just focused on the apple.\"\n\nHe thinks that apples have long held a special place in people's hearts \u2014 appearing in art and popular culture for centuries \u2014 but their popularity could also have something to do with their flexibility.\n\n\"You can throw them in your bag and they don't go mushy there. You can store them for a really long period of time. You can ferment them and turn them into cider.\"\n\nThe Red Delicious is 'beautiful on the outside, and garbage on the inside,' Myles said. (Mary-Catherine McIntosh/CBC)\n\nBut despite his enthusiasm, Myles can't actually enjoy them \u2014 he's allergic.\n\n\"I can take a little bite and chew a little bit, but then it starts to burn around my lips and on my tongue,\" he said.\n\nHe said he one day hopes to breed a \"hypoallergenic\" apple that won't trigger his allergies.\n\n\"It's a good career goal.\"\n\nWritten by Padraig Moran.
