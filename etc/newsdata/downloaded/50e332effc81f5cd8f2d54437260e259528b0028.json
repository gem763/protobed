I've seen him before bolt off when he's substituted. He's walked off and then he goads them.\n\n\"We're talking about fans who have watched him play a handful of good games in three years. And he's treating them like that.\"\n\nUnder-pressure Arsenal manager Unai Emery admitted Xhaka's reaction was wrong, and said he would talk to the player in private about the incident .\n\nBut Wright believes it is down to the player to try to make things right with the supporters.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nWright added: \"He should apologise. That's the guy Arsenal have chosen as captain. That's not captain behaviour.\n\n\"Arsenal fans have been patient with him. He owes them a lot more than that. He's got the responsibility. You can't go on like that. The manager has faith in him and he's done that.\"\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Xhaka will face those same supporters when Arsenal return to the Emirates Stadium next Saturday to take on Wolves , and it is anybody's guess what kind of reaction he will face if he is named in the team.", "description": "The Swiss midfielder was involved in an angry exchange with supporters as he was substituted in his side's 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace", "authors": ["Alex Milne", "Image", "Visionhaus", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20582118.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_pxl_eng_bulgaria_racist_wright_021JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
