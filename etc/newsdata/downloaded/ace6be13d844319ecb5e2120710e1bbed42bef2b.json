Kramer, a long-time adviser to late Senator John McCain. Kramer played a central role in disseminating the anti-Trump dossier to the news media and Obama administration. Taylor participated in events and initiatives organized by Kramer.\n\nThe links may be particularly instructive after Breitbart News reported that itinerary for a trip to Ukraine in August organized by the Burisma-funded Atlantic Council for ten Congressional aides reveals that a staffer on Rep. Adam Schiff\u2019s House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence held a meeting during the trip with Taylor. The pre-planned trip took place after the so-called whistleblower officially filed his August 12 complaint and reportedly after a Schiff aide was contacted by the so-called whistleblower.\n\nMultiple U.S. media outlets yesterday obtained Taylor\u2019s full opening statement to the House Intelligence, Oversight and Foreign Affairs committees.\n\nIn the leaked pre-written full opening statement, Taylor alluded to work he said he did for a \u201csmall Ukrainian non- governmental organization\u201d but he omitted the name of the organization.\n\n\u201cIn the intervening 10 years, I have stayed engaged with Ukraine, visiting frequently since 2013 as a board member of a small Ukrainian non- governmental organization supporting good governance and reform,\u201d he said.\n\nThe name of the organization is the U.S.-Ukraine Business Council (USUBC), where Taylor served for nine years as senior advisor. The USUBC has co-hosted or participated in scores of events with the Atlantic Council. Taylor has also authored numerous analysis pieces published by the Atlantic Council itself and has co-authored opeds written together with the Atlantic Council\u2019s director.\n\nBurisma is a key financial backer of the Atlantic Council. In 2017, Burisma and the Atlantic Council signed a cooperative agreement to develop transatlantic programs with Burisma\u2019s financial support reportedly to focus \u201con European and international energy security.\u201d Burisma specifically finances the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center.\n\nBesides funding the Atlantic Council, Burisma also routinely partners with the think tank. Only four months ago, the company co-hosted the Atlantic Council\u2019s second Annual Kharkiv Security Conference. Burisma advertises that it committed itself to \u201c15 key principles of rule of law and economic policy in Ukraine developed by the Atlantic Council.\u201d\n\nIn March, three months before he became Trump\u2019s ambassador to Ukraine, the Atlantic Council featured an oped co-authored by Taylor in which the diplomat argued Ukraine \u201chas further to travel toward its self-proclaimed European goal\u201d of reformation.\n\nIn 2017, Taylor wrote a piece for the Atlantic Council about a Ukrainian parliament vote on health care reform.\n\nLast year, he participated in an online Atlantic Council Q & A on the Crimea.\n\nIn November 2011, the Atlantic Council hosted Taylor as the featured speaker at a discussion event when he was appointed that year as Special Coordinator for Middle East Transitions at the State Department.\n\nIn March 2014, Taylor co-authored an analysis piece at Foreign Policy magazine written together with John E. Herbst, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine who serves as director of the Eurasia Center for the Atlantic council \u2013 the same Eurasia Center that is specifically funded by Burisma.\n\nThat same year, Taylor also co-authored a New York Times op-ed with the Atlantic Council\u2019s Herbst on Ukraine. The duo co-authored another Times op-ed one year later on the future of Ukraine. The op-ed was reprinted on the USUBC\u2019s website.\n\nThe USUBC, where Taylor was a senior adviser for nine years along with Kramer, has hosted Herbst for briefings and other events.\n\nKramer of the USUBC, infamous for his role in disseminating the anti-Trump dossier, also held a November 2011 event at the Atlantic Council\u2019s D.C. offices for a group that he heads called Freedom House. Taylor was one of six featured speakers at Kramer\u2019s event.\n\nThe Atlantic Council published what it deemed a 24-point plan for ending the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In conjunction with the plan, Kramer, in his role as director of Freedom House, organized a letter by American and European experts and former officials urging Russia to end its conflict with Ukraine. Signatories of the letter, published on the Burisma-funded Atlantic Council\u2019s website, include Taylor, Kramer and the Atlantic Council\u2019s Herbst.\n\nAs late as this past March, Taylor was listed as one of nine members of the Friends of Ukraine Network Economic Security Task Force. Another member is Kramer.\n\nWhen he deployed to Ukraine as Trump\u2019s ambassador in June, the USUBC authored a piece in the Kyiv Post welcoming him\n\nIn the USUBC piece welcoming Taylor to Ukraine, Kramer himself commented about Taylor\u2019s ambassador position. \u201cHe\u2019s a great choice for now,\u201d Kramer gushed.\n\nThe USUBC\u2019s piece noted that the \u201cUSUBC has worked closely with Ambassador Taylor for many years,\u201d touting his role as the business group\u2019s senior adviser.\n\nOn June 26, just nine days after arriving in Ukraine as ambassador, the USUBC already hosted Taylor for a roundtable discussion about his new position.\n\nVadym Pozharskyi, adviser to the board of directors at Burisma Holdings, was also previously hosted as a USUBC featured speaker.\n\nGeysha Gonzalez is the sponsoring Atlantic Council officer listed on the Congressional disclosure form for the Schiff staffer\u2019s trip to Ukraine in August. She is deputy director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center.\n\nGonzalez is also one of eleven members of the rapid response team for the Ukrainian Election Task Force, which says it is working to expose \u201cforeign interference in Ukraine\u2019s democracy.\u201d Another member of the team is Kramer.\n\nKramer revealed in testimony that he held a meeting about the anti-Trump dossier with a reporter from BuzzFeed News, who he says snapped photos of the controversial document without Kramer\u2019s permission when he left the room to go to the bathroom. That meeting was held at the McCain Institute office in Washington, Kramer stated.\n\nBuzzFeed infamously published the Christopher Steele dossier on January 10, 2017, setting off a firestorm of news media coverage about the document.\n\nThe Washington Post reported last February that Kramer received the dossier directly from Fusion GPS after McCain expressed interest in it.\n\nIn a deposition taken on December 13, 2017, and posted online earlier this year, Kramer revealed that he met with two Obama administration officials to inquire about whether the anti-Trump dossier was being taken seriously.\n\nIn one case, Kramer said that he personally provided a copy of the dossier to Obama National Security Council official Celeste Wallander.\n\nIn the deposition, Kramer said that McCain specifically asked him in early December 2016 to meet about the dossier with Wallander and Victoria Nuland, a senior official in John Kerry\u2019s State Department.\n\nTaylor testimony and Burisma\n\nIn his testimony to the Democrats secretive impeachment inquiry yesterday, Taylor said that he \u201cunderstood\u201d from U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland that a White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u201cwas dependent on a public announcement of the investigations.\u201d Taylor was referring to the announcement of an investigation that included Burisma, as well as alleged Ukrainian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nTaylor\u2019s testimony was characterized by CNN as \u201cexplosive\u201d and was similarly hyped by other news media outlets despite it not being unusual for the U.S. to condition aspects of relations on participation in ongoing American investigations involving the foreign country in question.\n\nStill, Taylor conceded that there was no quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cAmbassador Sondland said that he had talked to President Zelensky and Mr. Yermak and told them that, although this was not a quid pro quo, if President Zelensky did not \u2018clear things up\u2019 in public, we could be at a \u2018stalemate.\u2019 I understood \u2018stalemate to mean that Ukraine would not receive the much-needed military assistance,\u201d Taylor testified.\n\nDocument: Adam Schiff Staffer Met with Impeachment Witness on Ukraine Trip\n\nAs Breitbart News reported, Thomas Eager, a staffer on Schiff\u2019s House Intelligence Committee, took a trip to Ukraine in August billed as a bipartisan \u201cUkraine Study Trip\u201d in which ten Congressional staffers participated.\n\nEager is also currently a fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Congressional Fellowship, a bipartisan program that says it \u201ceducates congressional staff on current events in the Eurasia region.\u201d The pre-planned Ukraine trip was part of the fellowship program.\n\nA closer look at the itinerary for the August 24 to August 31 trip shows that the delegation\u2019s first meeting upon arrival in Ukraine was with Taylor.\n\nSpokespeople for Schiff\u2019s office did not reply to multiple Breitbart News requests for comment on Eager\u2019s meeting with Taylor.\n\nWhen Breitbart News first reported on Eager\u2019s visit to Ukraine, Schiff\u2019s office quickly replied to several comment requests, denying any impropriety related to Eager\u2019s association with the Atlantic Council or the trip.\n\nThe unanswered Breitbart email requests to Schiff\u2019s office about Taylor\u2019s meeting with Eager posed the following question:\n\nWhile in Ukraine, did Mr. Eager speak to Mr. Taylor about the issue of reports about any representatives of President Trump looking into alleged Biden corruption in Ukraine?\n\nThe dates of the pre-planned trip are instructive. Eager\u2019s visit to Ukraine sponsored by the Burisma-funded Atlantic Council began 12 days after the so-called whistleblower officially filed his August 12 complaint.\n\nSchiff and his office have offered seemingly conflicting statements on the timeline of the California Congressman\u2019s initial contact with the so-called whistleblower.\n\nSpeaking on September 17, Schiff told MSNBC, \u201cWe have not spoken directly with the whistleblower. We would like to.\u201d\n\nSchiff\u2019s spokesperson, Patrick Boland, was quoted on October 2 saying, \u201cAt no point did the committee review or receive the complaint in advance.\u201d Boland said Schiff\u2019s committee received the complaint the night before it publicly released the document.\n\nOn October 2, however, the New York Times reported that Schiff received some of the contents of the complaint through an unnamed House Intelligence Committee aide initially contacted by the so-called whistleblower, described as a CIA officer.\n\nThe Times reported the aide \u201cshared some of what the officer conveyed to Mr. Schiff.\u201d The referenced officer refers to the so-called whistleblower.\n\nThe newspaper also reported:\n\nBy the time the whistle-blower filed his complaint, Mr. Schiff and his staff knew at least vaguely what it contained.\n\nSpeaking to CBS\u2019s Face the Nation on Sunday, Schiff conceded that he was not clear enough about his contact with the so-called whistleblower.\n\n\u201cI should have been much more clear,\u201d Schiff said.\n\nSchiff signed form\n\nSchiff\u2019s signature appears on the required post-travel disclosure form filed with the House Committee on Ethics documenting the visit to Ukraine. The form signed by Schiff says that Eager\u2019s trip to Ukraine was paid for by the \u201cAtlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center.\u201d\n\nThe form bearing Schiff\u2019s signature (above) describes the visit thusly:\n\nSeries of meetings and visits with gov\u2019t officials, party officials, civil society and private sector reps in Ukraine to learn about ongoing political and military issues, including conflict in the East.\n\nThe costs for Eager\u2019s visit listed on the form are $2202.91 for transportation, $985.50 for lodging, and $630.15 for meal expenses.\n\nSpeaking to Breitbart News, Gonzalez confirmed that Eager started his one-year fellowship with the organization in January and that Eager is still a fellow.\n\nGonzalez said the pre-planned trip was part of the fellowship program, which also includes a full year of round tables and other educational events. She said it was not within her portfolio to comment on issues of funding from Burisma or other donors.\n\nCommon funding themes\n\nBesides Burisma funding, the Atlantic Council is also financed by billionaire activist George Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations, Google, the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, Inc., and the U.S. State Department.\n\nGoogle, Soros\u2019s Open Society Foundations, the Rockefeller Fund, and an agency of the State Department each also finance a self-described investigative journalism organization repeatedly referenced as a source of information in the so-called whistleblower\u2019s complaint alleging Trump was \u201cusing the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country\u201d in the 2020 presidential race.\n\nThe charges in the July 22 report referenced in the so-called whistleblower\u2019s document and released by the Google and Soros-funded organization, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), seem to be the public precursors for a lot of the so-called whistleblower\u2019s own claims, as Breitbart News documented.\n\nOne key section of the so-called whistleblower\u2019s document claims that \u201cmultiple U.S. officials told me that Mr. Giuliani had reportedly privately reached out to a variety of other Zelensky advisers, including Chief of Staff Andriy Bohdan and Acting Chairman of the Security Service of Ukraine Ivan Bakanov.\u201d\n\nThis was allegedly to follow up on Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky in order to discuss the \u201ccases\u201d mentioned in that call, according to the so-called whistleblower\u2019s narrative. The complainer was clearly referencing Trump\u2019s request for Ukraine to investigate the Biden corruption allegations.\n\nEven though the statement was written in first person \u2013 \u201cmultiple U.S. officials told me\u201d \u2013 it contains a footnote referencing a report by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP).\n\nThat footnote reads:\n\nIn a report published by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) on 22 July, two associates of Mr. Giuliani reportedly traveled to Kyiv in May 2019 and met with Mr. Bakanov and another close Zelensky adviser, Mr. Serhiy Shefir.\n\nThe so-called whistleblower\u2019s account goes on to rely upon that same OCCRP report on three more occasions. It does so to:\n\nWrite that Ukraine\u2019s Prosecutor General Yuriy Lutsenko \u201calso stated that he wished to communicate directly with Attorney General Barr on these matters.\u201d\n\nDocument that Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani \u201chad spoken in late 2018 to former Prosecutor General Shokin, in a Skype call arranged by two associates of Mr. Giuliani.\u201d\n\nBolster the charge that, \u201cI also learned from a U.S. official that \u2018associates\u2019 of Mr. Giuliani were trying to make contact with the incoming Zelenskyy team.\u201d The so-called whistleblower then relates in another footnote, \u201cI do not know whether these associates of Mr. Giuliani were the same individuals named in the 22 July report by OCCRP, referenced above.\u201d\n\nThe OCCRP report repeatedly referenced is actually a \u201cjoint investigation by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and BuzzFeed News, based on interviews and court and business records in the United States and Ukraine.\u201d\n\nBuzzFeed infamously also first published the full anti-Trump dossier alleging unsubstantiated collusion between Trump\u2019s presidential campaign and Russia. The dossier was paid for by Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and the Democratic National Committee, and was produced by the Fusion GPS opposition dirt outfit.\n\nThe OCCRP and BuzzFeed \u201cjoint investigation\u201d resulted in both OCCRP and BuzzFeed publishing similar lengthy pieces on July 22 claiming that Giuliani was attempting to use connections to have Ukraine investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals.\n\nThe so-called whistleblower\u2019s document, however, only mentions the largely unknown OCCRP and does not reference BuzzFeed, which has faced scrutiny over its reporting on the Russia collusion claims.\n\nAaron Klein is Breitbart\u2019s Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.
