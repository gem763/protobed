Other patrons yelled at the man, who spit on them as they left early, said Nathanael Hood, who was in the theater.\n\n\u201cI was scared. I\u2019m sure a lot of other people were,\u201d Hood said in an interview conducted by private messages.\n\nSocial media users posted photos of police, security sweeps and safety notices at theaters in California and Florida. And in Tennessee, a drive-in theater banned moviegoers from wearing costumes to a screening of the R-rated \u201cJoker,\u201d which scored an October box-office record with $13.3 million in earnings.\n\nThe Warner Bros. film, directed by Todd Phillips, presents the backstory of the man who becomes Batman\u2019s classic foe. Starring Joaquin Phoenix, it probes the journey of a disturbed man with a penetrating laugh into a killer.\n\nWhile Phillips has said he hopes the film inspires discussions about guns, violence and the treatment of people with mental illness, some feared the movie could inspire violence, particularly after a mass shooting killed 12 at a Colorado theater during a screening of another Batman movie in 2012.\n\nHood, who attended an afternoon viewing of \u201cJoker\u201d at AMC Empire 25 in Times Square, said a disruption began in the seats when the action on the screen grew intense.\n\n\u201cAbout halfway through when Joker started killing people and monologuing about how society is evil he started clapping really loudly and incessantly for a good minute. People started yelling for him to shut up, but he kept clapping and cheering like mad,\u201d Hood said.\n\nThe man started clapping and cheering again \u201creally loudly\u201d during a climatic gunfight, he said, and got \u201cbelligerent\u201d when people told him to quit.\n\n\u201cFinally security came and got him. He was still being interrogated outside the theater when we came out,\u201d said Hood. Plenty of police were around the theater, he said.\n\nAnother moviegoer, Etai Benson, said the loud man was sitting beside him at the start of the movie and poured what appeared to be a full bottle of alcohol into a drink. The man\u2019s behavior \u201ccombined with the carnage happening onscreen got people nervous,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis was most likely a harmless drunk guy, but all the nervousness built around the film made what happened (Friday) night really unsettling,\u201d Benson said in an interview conducted by private messages.\n\nA spokesman for the Kansas-based AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., which operates AMC Theatres, did not immediately return an email seeking comment.\n\nThe FBI told local police agencies to monitor potentially threatening online posts related to the film.\n\nPhotos posted on social media showed officers and a police dog outside a theater where \u201cJoker\u201d was being shown in Orlando, Florida, and a police SUV was parked on the sidewalk outside a cinema in suburban Birmingham, Alabama, during a screening.\n\nIn Bristol, Tennessee, the owner of the Twin City Drive-In Theater, Danny Warden, posted a warning on Facebook that anyone wearing a costume or mask to see \u201cJoker\u201d wouldn\u2019t be allowed in, and anyone who smuggled in an outfit would be asked to leave.\n\nWarden told WJHL-TV that the decision was \u201ccommon sense\u201d after the film sparked concerns about its violent content.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Extra layers of security, intense on-screen action and a frightening incident inside a New York theater combined to create an unsettling experience for some moviegoers who went to see \"Joker\" on its opening weekend.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Jay Reeves"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/film_review_-_joker_34094_c0-152-4440-2740_s1770x1032.jpg?085de71d829e094448c328d861f0a32eeffc6d7c", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
