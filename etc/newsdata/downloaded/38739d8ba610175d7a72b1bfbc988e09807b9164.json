This is because design, software, hardware and industry professionals \u2013 many of which came to us through acquisitions, like Nytec, Pillar Technology and Mindtribe \u2013 all work at the same table. A Forge lets them tap the entire stack of equipment and methods needed to take ideas from sketch to final product.\u201d\n\nAccenture currently operates Industry X.0 Forges in Columbus, Ohio; Ann Arbor, Michigan; Des Moines, Iowa; and Jefferson, Iowa. Additional Forges are planned to open across the United States and in Asia in the coming 12 months.\n\nThe opening of the Forge builds upon Accenture\u2019s continued growth in Chicago. In July 2019, the company announced it will increase the footprint of its Chicago Innovation Hub located in the 500 West Madison building \u2013 which was renamed the Accenture Tower \u2013 and add 600 highly-skilled tech jobs and significantly grow its apprentice program.\n\n\u201cChicago is a manufacturing powerhouse and at our new Forge, we will help our clients create product innovations at speed and at scale,\u201d said Jim Coleman, senior managing director at Accenture, who leads its business in Chicago. \u201cBy calling mHUB our home, we\u2019re able to tap into their state-of-the-art facilities and vibrant, entrepreneurial mindset, which is critical in today\u2019s business environment.\u201d\n\nmHUB CEO and Co-Founder Haven Allen added, \u201cAccenture\u2019s Industry X.0 is a key partner for us as we continue to build an ecosystem around physical product innovation and leverage the power of entrepreneurship to solve problems in manufacturing. We look forward to working hand-in-hand with them to drive industry 4.0 right here in the Midwest.\u201d\n\nThe Innovation Hub in Chicago is part of a network of 11 Accenture Innovation Hubs in North America, with other locations in Atlanta; Boston; Columbus, Ohio; metro Detroit; Houston; New York; San Francisco; Seattle; Toronto; and metro Washington, D.C.
