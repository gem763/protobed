The woman, also said to be British, died instantly.\n\n\u201cAn inquiry is being conducted,\u201d said police spokeswoman Chryssa Panayiotou. \u201cIt seems to have been an accident. The 58-year-old woman was lying on the ground when her 62-year-old husband drove into her, not knowing she was there.\u201d\n\nPolice said while it was premature to rush to conclusions, the woman appeared to have got out of the car under the influence of alcohol before collapsing. \u201cThe incident happened at around 2.30am,\u201d added the spokeswoman. \u201cHer body was immediately taken to the health centre on Skiathos. An autopsy will be conducted in the coming days.\u201d\n\nPolice said the couple, who have not been named, spent long stints on the island, residing there every year between May and November.\n\nThe man, who was arrested but released pending trial on the order of a public prosecutor, underwent medical tests on Wednesday to ascertain alcohol levels in his blood. \u201cWe want to see to what degree he was under the influence,\u201d said Panayiotou.\n\nDespite the Briton being charged with involuntary manslaughter the case was being treated as an accident, according to authorities. A coroner in the central Greek town of Larissa is expected to carry out an autopsy.\n\nSkiathos, where much of the blockbuster Mamma Mia! was filmed, is hugely popular among Britons. The incident had shocked many on the island, according to local media.", "description": "Police say it appears man drove into his wife outside Skiathos villa not knowing she was there", "authors": ["Helena Smith"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cab09071ad609b7236b6eec1d8c937cc7b37f733/0_203_3822_2294/master/3822.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f7e08632ecc2531b80487957ba94bc45", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
