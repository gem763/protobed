The team will provide an update on her condition and availability on Saturday.\n\nDelle Donne left early in the first quarter of Game 2 with back spasms and did not return. Coach Mike Thibault said Delle Donne called for a substitute immediately after going up for a rebound.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the one nightmare I\u2019ve had for the last month, is seeing her lying on her back,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cI watched that in 2015 when she was in Chicago, and it wasn\u2019t a good sight for them, and it wasn\u2019t a good sight for me now.\u201d\n\nThe Connecticut Sun went on to beat Washington Tuesday 99-87, tying the series at 1-1.\n\nIt\u2019s the second straight year Delle Donne was injured in the playoffs. Last year, a bone bruise in her knee caused her to miss some time during the semifinal round, and when she returned to the lineup, she was not quite herself.\n\nShe continues to play with a knee brace as well as a face mask after breaking her nose during the regular season, though both of those injuries have healed.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
