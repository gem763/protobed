Conor Garland also scored and Oliver Ekman-Larsson finished with two assists.\n\nArizona was 2 for 2 on the power play. The Jets were 2 for 6.\n\n\"We just didn't kill two penalties. That, to me, is the difference,\" Jets coach Paul Maurice said.\n\nHe also saw weaknesses in his team's penalty kill rather than strength in Arizona's power play.\n\n\"Those were their first two power-play goals of the year,\" Maurice said. \"We made mistakes, but we blocked four shots. Four. We blocked four shots tonight and that's a problem.\"\n\nDarcy Kuemper made 38 saves for the Coyotes. He has allowed two goals or less in 11 straight games, tying the franchise record set by Nikolai Khabibulin.\n\nMark Scheifele had a goal and an assist and extended his point streak to five games with his team-leading fourth goal of the season for Winnipeg.\n\nKyle Connor also scored for Winnipeg, and Josh Morrissey had a pair of assists.\n\nJets captain Blake Wheeler said the team wants to play well defensively and work from there.\n\n\"I think we're still trying to establish ourselves and figure out our identity as a team,\" Wheeler said. \"We're very much a work in progress.\n\n\"We're a competitive group and we've come to work every single day since training camp. That's a great thing to fall back on. Tighten a few things up. Also keeping in mind we've played quite a bit of hockey here to start the year.\"\n\nConnor Hellebuyck stopped 31 shots for the Jets, who were playing the second game of a five-game homestand and coming off a 7-2 loss to Pittsburgh.\n\nThe teams were tied 1-1 after the first period, but Arizona scored a pair of power-play goals and led 4-1 following the second.\n\nWith Coyotes forward Derek Stepan off for hooking, Patrik Laine blasted a shot that hit the post and Scheifele sent the rebound past Kuemper at 7:35 of the first.\n\nGarland deflected a shot from the point by Ekman-Larrson with eight seconds remaining in the opening period to tie it.\n\nDvorak and Schmaltz scored with the man advantage just over two minutes apart in the second to stretch Arizona's lead to 3-1 at 7:21.\n\nJets defenseman Josh Morrissey had accidentally flipped the puck into his own net after Dvorak touched it.\n\nSchmaltz then scored through traffic and Dvorak added his second goal of the game when he beat Hellebuyck on the glove side at 17:47.\n\nWith Garland in the penalty box for a high-sticking double minor against Laine, Connor flipped a backhand shot by Kuemper at 4:48 of the third to make it 4-2.\n\nWinnipeg had another power play with five minutes left in the third, but failed to convert.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCoyotes: Host Nashville on Thursday.\n\nJets: Host the New York Islanders on Thursday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NHL: https://apnews.com/NHL and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
