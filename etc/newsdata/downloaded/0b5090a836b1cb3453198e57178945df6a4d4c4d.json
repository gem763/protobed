Sign up here.\n\nBeing run over by a vehicle, beaten while handcuffed, and even threatened with rape \u2014 they\u2019re all examples of the treatment migrant children and teenagers have said they endured while in the custody of Customs and Border Protection.\n\nSome of the kids claim officers hit them for no reason. One boy said officers accused him of lying about his age and told him he\u2019d be raped by an adult man if he didn\u2019t tell the truth.\n\nThe documents, which ACLU of San Diego obtained through a FOIA request, relate to allegations of abuse made against Customs and Border Protection officers by people in custody, or made by people on their behalf, between 2009 and 2014. The documents predate the Trump administration \u2014 but the ACLU says they\u2019re indicative of a broader pattern of abuse and mistreatment within the Customs and Border Protection, one of the largest law enforcement agency in the country.\n\n\u201cThis didn\u2019t happen overnight,\u201d Mitra Ebadolahi, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU of San Diego, told VICE News. \u201cFor those of us who have been paying attention to those problems for many years, unfortunately much of what has happened more recently \u2014 although devastating and truly horrifying \u2014 is not necessarily surprising.\u201d\n\nHere are some of the allegations in the 35,000 pages of documents.\n\nCoercion and abuse\n\nOne 16-year-old Guatemalan boy claimed he was verbally abused and strip-searched while in custody in 2013. He said two agents accused him of lying about his age and falsifying his documents, and then told him he\u2019d be sexually abused by an adult detainee if he didn\u2019t tell the truth. One of the agents told the boy to remove his clothing, searched him, and continued to interview him about his age while he was undressed, according to the incident report.\n\nAnother Mexican minor said officers in Texas verbally harassed him while they drove to a processing station. At one point, according to a May 2013 incident report filed by an officer, the agents took him out of the van and told him he was going to be raped. \u201cWell take off my handcuffs so I can defend myself,\u201d he replied.\n\nREAD: Here's the real reason kids are being kept in filthy Border Patrol holding cells for weeks\n\nThe agents said the boy would be beat up if he resisted, according to the document. One agent also allegedly pulled out his pepper spray and held it to the boy\u2019s face and told him he\u2019d be sprayed if he fought back.\n\nExcessive force\n\nSeveral documents show the lengths migrants went to to hide from Border Patrol officers, and the lengths those officers went to to catch them. In one instance, an officer told his supervisors that he doesn\u2019t mind when migrants flee, \u201cbecause he actually enjoys the chase\u201d according to an affidavit.\n\nBut the chase can quickly become violent. One officer filed an incident report after two Mexican nationals said officers in Texas ran them over with ATVs. One said the vehicle ran over his right foot, the other, his lower back. Both were \u201cgiven a voluntary return to Mexico,\u201d according to documents.\n\nAnother migrant, who attempted to hide from a Border Patrol agent under a parked car, said the officer dragged him out and called him \u201cmotherfucker,\u201d \u201cputo,\u201d and verga.\u201d In a separate memo related to the incident, the same officer justified the use of force, saying he \u201cescalated the level of force necessary to gain compliance as per my instruction from the Border Patrol academy.\u201d\n\nTaken together, the documents provide some insight into the way CBP handles allegations of abuse and mistreatment. But sometimes the reports are closed or transferred before they can be investigated. That the case with a July 2010 report in which an underage migrant said an officer shoved him into a fence and shocked him with a taser gun.\n\nBeaten while handcuffed\n\nMany children and teenagers said the officers beat them after they had been arrested, sometimes while they were already in handcuffs.\n\nOne report was filed after a Mexican minor \u2014 whose age isn\u2019t disclosed in the documents \u2014 said officer who hit him in the face while he was already cuffed. Another Mexican minor said a border agent \u201ckneed him on his head four or five times after being handcuffed,\u201d according to a June 2013 report.\n\nREAD: A Congressional tour of Border Patrol facilities went \"off the rails\"\n\nAnother boy, a 15-year-old from Guatemala, said officers hit him in the mouth after handcuffing him during his arrest in the desert and that an officer choked him after he asked for food, an incident report shows. When he made it to the Border Patrol processing station, he said he wasn\u2019t given any blankets during his two-day detention or provided with an interpreter to translate documents or instructions for him.\n\nCover image: In this March 27, 2019, file photo, Central American migrants wait for food in a pen erected by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to process a surge of migrant families and unaccompanied minors in El Paso, Texas.
