Russian authorities deny Wagner contractors carry out their orders.\n\nThe Wagner group was thrust into the spotlight last year when three Russian journalists were killed in Central African Republic while investigating there.\n\nRussian private military contractors use a defense ministry base in southern Russia containing barracks that were built by a company linked to businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, Reuters reported in April.\n\nThe United States imposed sanctions on Prigozhin after it accused him of trying meddle in its 2016 presidential election and the 2018 U.S. congressional elections.\n\nPrigozhin has denied any links to Wagner and has declined to comment on the U.S. allegations, calling them a \"private matter\" for the U.S. Treasury.\n\nWhen asked if it was behind Proekt's troubles, Concord Management and Consulting, Prigozhin's main business, said by email:\n\n\"If journalists are being persecuted or threatened they should phone 02,\" a reference to the police emergency number in Russia.\n\nRussia is regularly criticized by media freedom watchdogs who say attacks on journalists often go unpunished. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists says 28 journalists have been killed in Russia since 2000.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Anton Zverev, Andrew Osborn; editing by Mark Heinrich and Grant McCool)", "description": "A group of Russian journalists who investigated the activities of a secretive group of Russian mercenaries in Africa and the Middle East have been subject to a campaign of physical threats and harassment, their editor-in-chief said.
