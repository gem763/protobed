Then he fell unconscious,\u201d says a co-worker. \u201cThere was a sense of fear and panic after he died. We were afraid to sleep in that room.\u201d\n\nRumba, a labourer from Nepal, had been working as a scaffolder for two months at the Education City football stadium, a new 40,000-seat arena set to host a World Cup quarter-final in three years\u2019 time. He was employed by a labour supply company \u2013 a firm that farms out its workers wherever they are needed.\n\nLike hundreds of other young migrant workers who die in Qatar every year, his sudden and unexplained death was attributed to \u201cacute cardio respiratory failure due to natural cause[s]\u201d.\n\nBut Rumba was just 24. His friends and wife say he was perfectly healthy. He didn\u2019t drink and only occasionally smoked \u2013 he could not afford more than a couple of cigarettes a day.\n\nLast year nine World Cup stadium workers died of \u201cnatural causes\u201d, which the World Cup organisers call, \u201cnon-work related deaths\u201d.\n\nDeaths from natural causes are never investigated. Yet a Guardian investigation has found that migrant workers like Rumba can be exposed to hours of extreme heat stress every day for months at a time over the summer. Cardiologists now say that heat stress is the direct cause of the high numbers of deaths attributed to cardiovascular problems in Qatar.\n\nIn its most recent report on worker welfare, the Supreme Committee organising the World Cup boasts of a \u201ccore mission to ensure a sustained culture of health, safety and welfare\u201d.\n\nBut Rumba\u2019s death shows how far they have to go. Cardiologists say that heat stress fatalities can be avoided if the signs of heat stress are recognised and people get access to healthcare quickly. Yet Rumba\u2019s workmates say they have not even been issued with a mandatory health card by their employer, which would entitle them to low-cost or free healthcare.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rumba\u2019s wife, Nirmala Pakrin, 26, worries how she will support her son.

They just give us a Panadol,\u201d says another one of Rumba\u2019s co-workers.\n\nFar from the glistening towers of Doha, Rumba\u2019s wife, Nirmala Pakrin, lives with their six-year-old son, Niraj, in a room on the outskirts of Kathmandu.\n\nPakrin spoke to her husband regularly. \u201cHe told me he was working at the stadium. He said the work was not difficult, but he complained about the pay. He said he had not got his salary for three months. He said the camp boss used to swear at them and beat them sometimes,\u201d she says, swiping through photos of her husband on her phone.\n\nThen she received a call from a number she did not recognise. It was Rumba\u2019s camp boss, calling to tell her that her husband had died.\n\nHis death has left her shocked and confused. \u201cI don\u2019t remember him ever complaining about his health. I can\u2019t remember the last time he was unwell. He complained about the heat; how hot it was, how much he would sweat, but there was no hint that he was sick,\u201d she says.\n\nPakrin has been left with no husband, no income and no compensation from Qatar. The only money she has received from one of the richest countries in the world has come from Rumba\u2019s impoverished workmates, who all chipped in to send her 67,000 rupees (\u00a3470).\n\nFamily of World Cup worker waits for answers over death at Qatar stadium Read more\n\n\u201cI called the company boss and asked him for money. He said \u2026 since [Rumba died] in the camp he was not eligible for compensation. All they could do was send his body back,\u201d says Pakrin.\n\nLast year the Guardian revealed two cases where the Nepalis working on World Cup stadiums had died, and five months on, their families had not yet received compensation. The workers\u2019 employers have since made these payments.\n\nPakrin now says she doesn\u2019t know what she will do or how to provide for their son, Niraj. \u201cHe says his dad promised to bring chocolates when he came home,\u201d says Pakrin. \u201cHe keeps asking, \u2018Where\u2019s my dad?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Qatar Supreme Committee confirmed Rumba\u2019s death but said that the sub-contractor employing Rumba at the time was not pre-approved to mobilise on the World Cup stadium site. As a result Rumba had not received a comprehensive medical screening. It is launching a full investigation into how this happened.", "description": "Nepali Rupchandra Rumba\u2019s sudden death was attributed to heart failure \u2013 like hundreds of other young migrant workers who die in Qatar each year", "authors": ["Pete Pattisson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31514a77d52d9c24e4c53b9c2c6747d22f7e7e7d/0_211_576_346/master/576.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9f4aa7b4011353326d65bd6c9230b824"}
