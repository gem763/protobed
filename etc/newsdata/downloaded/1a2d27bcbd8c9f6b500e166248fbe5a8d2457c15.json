According to the post, more than $2.8 billion was spent on lobbying last year.\n\nThe Lobbying Defense Trust Fund would allocate the money toward three initiatives, according to the plan:\n\nStrengthening support agencies like the Congressional Budget Office, which provides economic and budget data to congress.\n\nProviding money to federal agencies that are facing significant lobbing activity.\n\nProceeds will also help create a new Office of the Public Advocate to \"help the American people engage with federal agencies and fight for the public interest in the rule-making process.\"\n\n\"Corporate lobbyists are experts at killing widely popular policies behind closed doors,\" Warren added. \"My new lobbying tax will make hiring armies of lobbyists significantly more expensive for the largest corporate influencers.\"\n\nRead more: Morgan Stanley breaks down how the next market downturn could upend what even the most prepared investors are expecting", "description": "Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday unveiled a plan designed to curb the influence of corporate lobbying.
