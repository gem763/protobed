Plus, sub-Saharan Africa's colonial-era media laws.\n\nSpinning, downplaying, ignoring: Lebanon protests and the media\n\nFor a week and a half now, the streets of Lebanon have been jammed with protesters - the biggest anti-government demonstrations in 15 years.\n\nThe protests were triggered by talk of a new tax on WhatsApp and other internet call services - like Facebook Messenger and FaceTime.\n\nThe protesters are a non-sectarian coalition. Not that you would know that, watching some of the television channels coming out of Beirut. Some of the more independent outlets have jumped on this story, but those controlled by politicians have been spinning, downplaying, or just ignoring the unrest.\n\nLead contributors:\n\nHabib Battah - Fellow, Reuters Institute Oxford\n\nRania Masri - Writer and academic\n\nLara Bitar - Media worker and organiser\n\nSalim Haddad - Head, Media Advisory Board, Free Patriotic Movement\n\nOn our radar\n\nRichard Gizbert speaks to producer Tariq Nafi about the relationship between Ethiopia\u2019s prime minister and one of the country\u2019s most famous media owners that may have gone sour.\n\nThe colonial-era laws that still govern African journalism\n\nBack in the late 19th century, European powers were setting sail for Africa, sweeping across the continent, colonising country after country.\n\nOnce they took power, they wrote laws designed to ensure that the colonised would not rise up against the colonisers - laws that could also be used to silence, censor, and jail or intimidate journalists who refused to toe the line.\n\nCome the late 1950s, Africans began revolting and over the next decade or two, most countries would win their independence.\n\nHowever, much of the colonial legislation remained in place and there is now a growing list of journalists in sub-Saharan Africa falling afoul of those laws.\n\nThe Listening Post's Nic Muirhead explores the colonial-era laws that still determine what can and cannot be reported in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nFeature contributors:\n\nOutsa Mokone - Editor, Sunday Standard\n\nSethunya Tshepho Mosime - Lecturer, University of Botswana\n\nAngela Quintal - Africa Programme coordinator, CPJ\n\nVuyisile Hlatshwayo - Director, Media Institute of Southern Africa\n\nSource: Al Jazeera News", "description": "WhatsApp and Lebanon's protests against tax, austerity, corruption.
