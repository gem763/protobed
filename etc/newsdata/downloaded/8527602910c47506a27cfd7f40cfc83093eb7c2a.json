(AP) - The Oakland Raiders are preparing to make do without the anchor of their offensive line.\n\nCenter Rodney Hudson missed practice on Wednesday with a sprained ankle that knocked him out of last week\u2019s loss at Houston and appears unlikely to be able to play this week against the Detroit Lions.\n\nHudson is one of the most valuable members of the offense for the Raiders (3-4) because of his strong blocking in the pass and run games and the ability to get the entire offense into the correct protections.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s super big shoes to fill,\u201d rookie backup Andre James said. \u201cHe\u2019s a dude who can\u2019t be replaced. I just try to do the best I can.\u201d\n\nHudson left the game in Houston early with the injury and was replaced by James, a converted tackle who is just learning the position of center this year. The offense fared well with James, allowing no sacks and moving the ball efficiently despite losing 27-24.\n\n\u201c(Andre) came in and there was no drop off,\u201d left guard Richie Incognito said. \u201cHe was confident in his points, battled his butt off and was battling with us. It was great. He did a really good job.\u201d\n\nJames also missed practice Wednesday with a sprained ankle but said he expects to be able to play this weekend.\n\nIf he can\u2019t go, Incognito worked at center in practice and could move there if necessary, despite not playing the position in a game since 2010. Oakland also signed Erik Magnuson off Buffalo\u2019s practice squad this week for more depth at the position.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something that comes natural to me, snapping the ball making the points,\u201d Incognito said. \u201cIt\u2019s fun. It\u2019s fun going back to center and learning something new.\u201d\n\nHudson has been one of the most dependable blockers in the league in recent years. He has allowed zero sacks this season, according to game tracking by Sports Info Solutions, after giving up only one in each of the previous three seasons. That gives him just three sacks allowed in 2,032 pass-blocking snaps since the start of 2016.\n\nHe also hasn\u2019t committed a single penalty while pass blocking the past three seasons and is also a key part of Oakland\u2019s successful running game.\n\nThe offensive line has been a strength for Oakland this season despite having all five projected starters on the field together for just 10 plays. Incognito missed the first two games with a suspension and left guard Gabe Jackson missed the first five with a knee injury.\n\nAfter Jackson returned, right tackle Trent Brown sat out a loss at Green Bay with a calf injury and then Hudson went down after 10 snaps in Houston in the first game with all five starters active.\n\n\u201cThe only guy to start every game on the line has been Kolton Miller,\u201d coach Jon Gruden said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had three different left guards, three different right guards and three different right tackles. And now potentially three different centers, so when you combine that with the youth at running back, the youth at tight end and then the changing of the guards at wide receiver, it\u2019s been tough on Derek (Carr).\u201d\n\nBut the patchwork line has kept Carr protected. The Raiders have allowed only eight sacks all season, one off the franchise low through seven games, and have matched a team record by going three straight games without allowing a sack. Oakland also ranks seventh in the NFL in rushing and is averaging 4.8 yards per carry.\n\nNOTES: The Raiders have signed four new players this week, bringing back LB Brandon Marshall after cutting him before the season and adding Magnuson, LB Will Compton and DT Terrell McClain. \u2026 Oakland waived LB Justin Phillips, LB Dakota Allen, DE Kasim Edebali and DT Corey Liuget.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Oakland Raiders are preparing to make do without the anchor of their offensive line.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Josh Dubow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/30/raiders_hudson_football_11389_c0-183-5059-3134_s1200x700.jpg?3baf775c8511830756373e0d838814e59cbe2b59", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
