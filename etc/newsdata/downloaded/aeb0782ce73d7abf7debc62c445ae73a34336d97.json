Up to Monday\u2019s close, the stock has fallen 69% since the findings were first revealed.\n\nThe company had also said in July that it was exploring a possible sale.\n\nOn Tuesday, CannTrust said its management and board were reviewing the notice with the company\u2019s counsel and other advisers.\n\nCannTrust added Health Canada would reinstate the licenses if the reasons for suspension no longer existed or if the company could show that the suspension was unfounded.\n\nThe company\u2019s shares were trading at C$1.74 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.", "description": "Troubled Canadian pot grower CannTrust Holdings Inc said on Tuesday its license to produce and sell cannabis has been suspended by Health Canada, sending its shares down 12.6%.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
