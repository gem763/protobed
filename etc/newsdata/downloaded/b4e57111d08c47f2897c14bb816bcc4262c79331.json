Bossert, who served as Mr. Trump\u2019s first homeland security adviser, said he told the president there was no basis to the theory that Ukraine, not Russia, intervened in the 2016 election and did so on behalf of the Democrats. Speaking out for the first time, Mr. Bossert said he was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d that Mr. Trump nonetheless tried to get Ukraine\u2019s president to produce damaging information about Democrats.\n\nMr. Bossert\u2019s comments, on the ABC program \u201cThis Week\u201d and in a subsequent telephone interview, underscored the danger to the president as the House moves ahead with an inquiry into whether he abused his power for political gain. Other former aides to Mr. Trump said on Sunday that he refused to accept reassurances about Ukraine no matter how many times it was explained to him, instead subscribing to an unsubstantiated narrative that has now brought him to the brink of impeachment.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nytimes.Com Us Politics Tom-Bossert-Trump-Ukraine.Html"], "top_image": ""}
