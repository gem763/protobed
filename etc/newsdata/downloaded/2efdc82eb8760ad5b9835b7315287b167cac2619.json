Still, a little straightforward information helps. Let\u2019s strip personal finance down to its basics:\n\n1. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to save.\u201d It\u2019s easy: Put savings first, and then figure out what you can and can\u2019t afford.\n\n2. \u201cWhere do I invest my money?\u201d Low-cost stock index mutual funds. Start mixing in some bond funds as you close in on retirement. Also check out the target-date funds you\u2019ll probably find in your 401(k) plan. If you\u2019re a tad more of a risk taker, buy a few stocks with good dividend-paying records and build an income stream.\n\n3. \u201cI don\u2019t make enough money.\u201d Look for a better job, up your skills, get a second job, start a small side business, work overtime. Perhaps even collect scrap metal with that F-150 you just had to have. Yup, I\u2019m being sarcastic.\n\n4. \u201cHow much can I withdraw from retirement savings before retirement?\u201d Do you mean how much should you withdraw? That money isn\u2019t an emergency or vacation fund. It\u2019s for retirement.\n\n5. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to expect from Social Security.\u201d Why not? Go to the Social Security website and run an estimate.\n\n6. \u201cHow do I avoid running out of money in retirement?\u201d Start with sufficient savings. Live within your means after you retire. Having zero debt upon retirement isn\u2019t a bad idea, either.\n\n7. \u201cHow do I calculate what to take from retirement funds?\u201d Well, there\u2019s the 4% guideline, which says start by taking 4% of your retirement assets in the first year of retirement and thereafter increase that amount by inflation each year.\n\n8. \u201cHow much money will I need for retirement?\u201d It isn\u2019t $1 million, $2 million or $5 million. It isn\u2019t any number someone else can give you. It\u2019s about 25 times the amount of money you need each year from your portfolio to live the way you want in retirement. Don\u2019t forget to consider what Social Security will also provide.\n\n9. \u201cWhen should I start taking Social Security?\u201d When you absolutely need the money to live on. That may mean age 62 or 70, or somewhere in between. Don\u2019t take it simply because you can or because you think it won\u2019t be there for you later. Remember, when you\u2019re 75 or 80, the highest possible Social Security benefit may come in handy.\n\n10. \u201cWhat do I do if the stock market takes a big tumble?\u201d Nothing, except keep up your periodic investing. It isn\u2019t a disaster, it\u2019s an opportunity. It\u2019s also why you minimize risk when you\u2019re close to retirement by diversifying into nonstock investments.\n\n11. \u201cHow much will Medicare cost me?\u201d The basic monthly individual Medicare Part B premium is projected to be some $144 in 2020, a $9 increase. Individuals with incomes of $85,000 or more will see increases of about $25 to $30 a month. You can find the premium schedule on CMS.gov. A Part D prescription drug plan will cost most people about $30 a month in 2020. But like Medicare Part B, it\u2019s based on income.\n\n12. \u201cIs Medicare all I need?\u201d Probably not. Medicare has deductibles and copays, plus there\u2019s no out-of-pocket limit. Most people have some form of supplemental Medigap coverage. Only 23% don\u2019t.\n\n13. \u201cI heard some guy harping on about an emergency fund in retirement. What gives?\u201d That would be me. Here\u2019s the deal: You have $800,000 in your retirement fund and you expect to use $32,000 a year to live. Next month, your car dies or your roof needs replacing. Take that money from your nest egg and your retirement income plan is kaput. Need I say more?\n\n14. \u201cI say we don\u2019t need life insurance when we retire. My spouse disagrees. What do I do?\u201d Simple. If you have folks dependent on you for support, how will you provide for them upon your demise? You might do so with life insurance, a survivor annuity or lots of savings, or some combination thereof. If a married couple makes it to age 65, there\u2019s a 45% chance one of them will reach 90.\n\n15. \u201cI don\u2019t have much, so I don\u2019t need a will, right?\u201d Wrong. The fact is, you need a will and maybe a living trust. Those beneficiary designations you may have made are crucial, but not sufficient.\n\n16. \u201cIs giving up my daily latte really going to help me in retirement?\u201d Not by itself. Rather, it\u2019s all about your spending mind-set. My simple formula is save, don\u2019t charge to a credit card what you can\u2019t repay in full each month, and then spend as you like.\n\n17. \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal with compound interest?\u201d The big deal is you make money on the money you previously made, and the whole thing snowballs over time. Say you\u2019re 25 and you invest $1,000, earning an average annual return of 7% between now and 65. That\u2019ll give you $14,974\u2014and you didn\u2019t lift a finger to earn it.\n\n18. \u201cMy wife and I are considering moving to the Island of Wheretheheckarewe. They say living there is so much cheaper. Does it sound like a good move?\u201d If moving to a lower cost location is necessary to retire, you may have missed a few planning steps.\n\nConsider a few questions. Could you afford to move back if needed or desired? How\u2019s the health care? Remember, there\u2019s no Medicare outside the U.S. What will you do with your time? How does your family feel about the move? Will you have funds to visit home? Is your spouse or partner truly on board with this idea?\n\n19. \u201cI\u2019m not going to retire, or at least not until around age 75, so why should I worry about all this planning and saving?\u201d Because you may not have a choice. A layoff, deteriorating health and caregiver duties could all get in the way. Or you may later change your mind and decide you\u2019d like to retire earlier. Don\u2019t get me wrong: If you enjoy working and figure out a way to never stop, best of luck to you.\n\n20. \u201cOK, I\u2019ve got it. Now what do I do?\u201d You plan. You may want to talk to an adviser to guide you. Get your head out of the sand. You can\u2019t go through your working life and suddenly decide at age 50 that you need to think about retirement. You reap what you sow, to paraphrase Paul. Think about the negative things that could happen in your life and strive to minimize those risks. In other words, think about the \u201cwhat ifs?\u201d\n\nThis column originally appeared on Humble Dollar. It was republished with permission.\n\nRichard Quinn blogs at QuinnsCommentary.com.
