I have no reason to lie and neither does coach Barry (Robinson). The management team was aware and so was everyone at his camp.\n\n\u201cI contacted them and they told me they would compensate me after the Wilder fight. They tried to talk me down and say they didn\u2019t do anything to the gloves.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cSo, let\u2019s say the possibility is that they didn\u2019t. But as soon as I picked up the glove the inside was falling out. You could manipulate the part of the glove that makes contact with its target.\n\n\u201cI showed in my screenshot conversations that they knew Tyson was sparring with gloves that were, to their account \u2018dodgy\u2019. The gloves just didn\u2019t have all of the paddings in there.\n\n\u201cThey also had weird marks on the outside of the glove that showed it was in contact with something other than what it was made for.\u201d\n\nFury's trainer Ben Davison vehemently denied the claims of 'dodgy gloves' in an angry post on Twitter .\n\n\"What do you think mate? Tyson/ or a team taking padding out his gloves to hurt sparring partners?!?\" Davison tweeted.\n\n\"When they only do 1-2 maybe 3 rounds at a time in and out? For THERE (sic) benefit! Funny how Tyson has great relationship with everybody he spars. Convenient timing too!\"", "description": "Nicholas Asberry accused former heavyweight champion Tyson Fury of taking the padding out of his sparring gloves", "authors": ["Alex Smith", "Image", "Instagram", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20708105.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Tyson-Furys-sparring-partner-doubles-down-on-glove-tampering-claim.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
