Europol highlighted these attacks as the most prominent cybercrime it tackles.\n\nHard Fork has previously reported on numerous ransomware attacks that\u2019ve demanded Bitcoin to restore encrypted files.\n\nStill, authorities say there has been a more \u201cpronounced shift\u201d towards more privacy-orientated cryptocurrencies, and expects this trend to continue as criminals become more security aware.\n\n\u201cThe main developments regarding this trend are on the Darknet [sic] markets, several of which also accept Monero, or in some cases exclusively trade in it,\u201d Europol added.\n\nJoin us in Amsterdam on October 15-17 to discuss blockchain and cryptocurrency with leading experts.", "description": "Europol notes that Bitcoin's prevalence in underground economies is a consequence of its familiarity within the customer base.", "authors": ["David Canellis", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/hardfork?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F06%2Feuropol-cryptocurrency-lsd.png&signature=a4b9bc0386752189f3411af7e191069c", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
