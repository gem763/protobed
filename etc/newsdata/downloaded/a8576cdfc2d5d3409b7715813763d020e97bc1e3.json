I did push past and got on the train and I showed him my pass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I was on my way to another charity event so did not want to miss my train. He was a white man with a thick South African accent.\u2019\n\nA formal complaint was made against the comedian (Picture: ITV, Rex Features)\n\nHowever, Paul claims: \u2018The man was black. Jim made a couple of phone calls moaning about him and repeatedly used the same kind of dismissive and abusive language.\u2019\n\nBritish Transport Police confirmed they had received a \u2018report of racial abuse\u2019 on the Virgin Trains service to Milton Keynes Central on 4 October.\n\nJim, who won Celebrity Big Brother in 2014, is known for his controversial style of comedy.\n\nIn August, he was reported to have jokingly told the audience at a stand-up show that they needed to \u2018take our country back\u2019.\n\nAuthor Martin Knight, who attended Jim\u2019s show on The People Fight Back tour in Hunstanton, tweeted: \u2018Jim Davidson on top form last night. Ended show on a political note: \u201cPay EU \u00a339bn? No thanks. We\u2019ve paid. Paid in blood on the Flanders field. And on the beaches of Dunkirk.
