Photo: HBO\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to think of Succession\u2019s Shiv Roy as someone worth rooting for, if only because the people around her so clearly aren\u2019t. Her father has no moral compass. Her brothers are, respectively, an addict, a slimeball, and a nincompoop. Her husband, as evidenced by his testimony before Congress in this week\u2019s episode, \u201cDC,\u201d has as much of a spine as your average sidewalk slug. The fact that Shiv is competent, astute, and frank about her ambitions \u2014 and on top of all that, a woman who has to deal with all these ridiculous men \u2014 makes her one of the few Succession characters that you\u2019re almost, almost tempted to admire. (The fact that she can rock a backless dress doesn\u2019t hurt either.) I mean, when you take a \u201cWhich Succession character are you?\u201d quiz, you want to get Shiv as your result, right? (I got Tom Wambsgans. I think it\u2019s because I chose Fozzie Bear as my favorite Muppet.)\n\nBut as Succession heads into its season two finale, \u201cDC\u201d reminded us that we definitely should not admire Shiv, or want to be anything like her. In the most distressing scene in Sunday\u2019s episode, Shiv (played with sneaky ruthlessness by Sarah Snook) convinces Kira (Sally Murphy), a victim of sexual harassment and abuse in Waystar Royco\u2019s cruises division, not to testify before Congress about what she\u2019s suffered. By doing so, Shiv Roy proves once and for all that she is a true Ivanka, a woman who rah-rahs feminism in theory but is really only invested in doing her daddy\u2019s bidding, regardless of the ethical lines that get obliterated along the way.\n\nWhen Shiv learns from her old boss, Sen. Gil Eavis, that Kira will be called as a witness, Logan and Kendall immediately decide that Kira has to be stopped. Against her better judgment, Rhea decides to handle it with Shiv. \u201cThis doesn\u2019t feel right,\u201d Rhea says as they head to a city playground where Kira agreed to meet. \u201cNo,\u201d Shiv says, completely missing the point. \u201cIt\u2019s lady duty, soft skills shit work.\u201d What\u2019s wrong, in Shiv\u2019s mind, is that she\u2019s been asked to handle a \u201clesser\u201d task, not that she is about to intimidate a fellow woman and a witness, which, in addition to being unethical, is also illegal.\n\nWhen they arrive at the playground, Rhea changes her mind about meeting Kira. That\u2019s because, even though she\u2019s not perfect, Rhea tends to ingest at least some moral fiber at breakfast every day. When Rhea tells Shiv that she doesn\u2019t have to go through with the confrontation either, Shiv corrects her: \u201cIf she speaks and she\u2019s compelling, then that\u2019s it for my family\u2019s company. So, yeah, I do have to.\u201d That\u2019s the moment when the true Shiv, the one who values her father\u2019s company and her status within it above all else, emerges. (It\u2019s also the moment that finally convinces Rhea she can no longer have anything to do with the Roys or their business endeavors; by the end of the episode, she\u2019ll walk away from Waystar, Logan, and the CEO job.)\n\nShiv\u2019s manipulation of Kira is unsubtle but masterful. She starts out by trying to seem like she\u2019s on Kira\u2019s side. \u201cI\u2019m here to listen,\u201d she says, even though she doesn\u2019t ask Kira any questions about what happened to her. She plays the \u201cwoman-to-woman\u201d card, removing her heels as if to suggest they\u2019re on equal footing, then complaining about how much she hates wearing them. (Shiv Roy: She\u2019s just like you. She gets it.) The pattern in Shiv\u2019s herringbone suit dress even resembles Kira\u2019s, though Shiv\u2019s ensemble is more chic and probably ten times more expensive. Their clothes are a reminder that they\u2019re both women, but otherwise live in different worlds.\n\nWhen Kira responds skeptically, Shiv makes a point of noting that she doesn\u2019t trust her dad. She also says that she wants to clean up the operation in the cruises division, too, and suggests it\u2019s something that they could do together if Kira doesn\u2019t testify. But the move that ultimately proves to be most effective is brutal honesty. After Shiv acknowledges that she isn\u2019t trustworthy and has her own personal agenda, she reminds Kira that so do the senators encouraging her to testify, then she lays out what her life will look like if she speaks out: Kira will be the center of media attention for a few days, but that will fade and nothing will change. The fact that she was sexually harassed by Lester McClintock \u2014 a man with the nickname Mo, as in \u201cMo Lester\u201d \u2014 will hang over her for the rest of her entire life. People will call her a slut. They\u2019ll never see her for who she is without thinking first of what she said before Congress. Her assault will be the first line of her obituary, Shiv says in frank but chilling words, and it will be the last.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about Shiv\u2019s faux \u201chonesty\u201d is that it really is honest. If Kira goes public, there\u2019s a distinct chance that no significant change will come of it. That\u2019s something that, as women, both of them know as well as they know that high heels hurt. Of course, testifying before Congress about her experience would, ideally, put another dent in a misogynistic machine that needs to be broken. But what Shiv says sounds so plausible to Kira that it\u2019s easier to believe she has more to lose than gain.\n\nIt\u2019s easy for us watching at home to believe, too. There are very strong shades of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford in this situation with Kira, and the fact that this episode airs on the one-year anniversary of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s confirmation by the Senate only drives that point home even further. Before Ford came forward last year, she feared the exact scenario that Shiv lays out on the playground: \u201cWhy suffer through the annihilation if it\u2019s not going to matter?\u201d she told the Washington Post at the time. If you were a friend of Kira\u2019s, it\u2019s very possible you might give her the same advice that Shiv did. The difference is that a friend would genuinely be trying to protect her. Shiv is not. It\u2019s disturbing how similar those efforts can sound, even when the motivations behind them are so opposed.\n\nSuccession is a dark show, obviously. But there\u2019s something about this moment that is extra-dark. There is zero comedy in it, not even a wry remark to put a button on the scene. It reminds me of what Logan did to Roman a couple of episodes ago: Shiv\u2019s conversation with Kira, and the fact that it has the desired effect, lands like a slap.\n\nThere is one tiny instant when Shiv seems like she might feel a sliver of remorse for what she did to Kira. It\u2019s after her father congratulates her. The camera holds on her face for a moment after Logan walks away. She is smiling, but then her face straightens up for a moment. The smile fades and she appears to be contemplating something, but \u2014 snap! \u2014 in a millisecond it\u2019s gone.\n\nShiv did what she needed to do. She made her daddy proud. I wonder, though, if she should be worried? I swore that in the distant background I could see other women watching Shiv talk to Kira, and that one of them was holding a camera as though she were filming the conversation. We\u2019ll see what happens in the finale. But if Shiv\u2019s attempt to undermine a fellow woman winds up being exposed by a woman, that would offer nice poetic justice. It\u2019s easy to stop one lady from blowing a whistle. But Shiv hasn\u2019t considered that there are always more ladies and, potentially, more whistles.", "description": "Shiv Roy, played by Sarah Snook on HBO\u2019s Succession, reveals her true colors by intimidating a sexual harassment victim in the episode \u201cDC.\u201d", "authors": ["Jen Chaney"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/04/04-succession-sarah-snook.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
