Universum defines Gen Z as those born in 1997 and after.\n\nUniversum asked students about 40 employer and job attributes, broken into four groups of ten each: employer reputation and image, people and culture, remuneration and advancement opportunities, and job characteristics. Students are asked to list up to three attributes in each category as being most important to them in their future careers.\n\nLGBT students were more likely to rank certain attributes as being important to them than their non-LGBT peers. Here are eight categories that had a notably higher ranking from LGBT students than non-LGBT students:\n\nLGBT students were more than twice as likely as non-LGBT students to rate support for gender equality and commitment to diversity and inclusion as being important characteristics of their future employers. They were also more likely to value corporate social responsibility, ethical standards, and opportunities for international travel or relocation.\n\nUniversum also asked students to select up to three industries from a list of 20 that they would like to work in. LGBT students were much more likely to say they wanted to work in the arts, entertainment, and recreation industry, educational and scientific institutions, and NGOs and non-profits than non-LGBT respondents:", "description": "The next generation of LGBT students know what they want in the workplace, and they're not afraid to be vocal about it.", "authors": ["Andy Kiersz"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d167e71a17d6c1ed735cdec?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
