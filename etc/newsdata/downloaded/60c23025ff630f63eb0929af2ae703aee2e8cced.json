Dozens more were wounded in the blasts, for which the Taliban claimed responsibility.\n\nMore violence is expected in coming days as Afghans prepare for a presidential election on September 28, which the Taliban have promised to disrupt.\n\n\"We already warned people not to attend election rallies. If they suffer any losses that is their own responsibility,\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said in a statement released after Tuesday's blasts.\n\nThe insurgents have said previously that the only other option is to continue fighting.\n\n\"We had two ways to end occupation in Afghanistan, one was jihad and fighting, the other was talks and negotiations,\" Mujahid told AFP earlier this month.\n\n\"If Trump wants to stop talks, we will take the first way and they will soon regret it.\"", "description": "The Taliban's chief negotiator has said their \"doors are open\" to resuming talks with Washington, hours after two attacks by the insurgents killed at least 48 people in war-weary Afghanistan.
