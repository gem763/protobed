The two fought a 16-year civil war that ended in a truce in 1992 but have clashed sporadically since.\n\nInstead the deal is at risk of falling apart as opposition parties reject the results, claiming they were tarnished by fraud, violence and irregularities from the outset. Frelimo says the elections were free and fair.\n\nAnalysts say a return to all-out conflict is highly unlikely even if the deal collapses, but low-level violence, including from an armed group of breakaway former Renamo fighters, could worsen. That could suck the government\u2019s focus and resources away from the insurgency in the gas-rich north.\n\n\u201cSHAMEFUL\u201d\n\nEight members of the CNE, which is made up of Frelimo and opposition party representatives, voted against accepting the results earlier this week, verses nine in favour.\n\nSpeaking after the conference, Fernando Mazanga, a Renamo member of the CNE, said they distanced themselves from the results because of irregularities.\n\n\u201cIt is shameful and a disgrace what we are witnessing here,\u201d he said.\n\nDaviz Simango, of the third largest party the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM), secured just over 4% of the presidential vote\n\nEarlier on Sunday, he said MDM saw the election outcome as \u201cnull and void\u201d. Renamo has also already rejected the results, and a number of observer groups have raised concerns.\n\nFrelimo won 184 out of 250 seats in parliament, verses 60 for Renamo and 6 for MDM, Carimo said.\n\nFrelimo also won a majority in all 10 of Mozambique\u2019s provinces in the provincial poll - a contest seen as central to the survival of the peace pact.\n\nFor the first time, provincial governors will be appointed by the majority party in each province rather than the government - a key demand of Renamo during peace talks.\n\nThe party had wanted to win control of a number of provinces in Mozambique\u2019s centre and north to achieve this long-thwarted ambition for influence, but has instead come away empty handed.", "description": "Mozambique's incumbent President Filipe Nyusi has won a landslide victory in an election it was hoped would calm tensions in a nation soon to become a top global gas exporter, but has instead stoked divisions as opposition parties cry foul.", "authors": ["Manuel Mucari", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445510002&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q0GG-OZATP", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
