In the 1980s he gained notoriety as the \u201cThursday robber\u201d after holding up a string of banks shortly before closing time on Thursdays. He said in court he had recently started working as a night porter but had picked up a gun again after finding his pension payments \u201cpitiful\u201d.\n\nBy his own account in court, Jauernik treated prisons more as educational establishments than correctional facilities. At a prison in Karlsruhe, he said, a former member of the Baader-Meinhof Gang introduced him to the works of Brecht, Sartre and Hegel. During a later prison spell in Hamburg he made headlines by leading a protest against conditions from the roof of the building, inciting a riot involving about 250 other inmates.\n\nWearing a suit and dark sunglasses throughout the trial, Jauernik painted himself as a highly intelligent gentleman thief whom the police had managed to catch only by chance. \u201cI am more intelligent and clever than any employee of the criminal police agency, that much is sure,\u201d he claimed.\n\nHe boasted that he had kept himself fit during his pre-trial detainment with thrice-daily sit-up sessions and 5km runs. The tabloid Bild nicknamed him Richard Gier (gier is German for greed) because of his resemblance to the Hollywood actor.\n\nJauernik appeared to justify his raids on financial institutions by citing recent high-profile banking scandals such as the so-called \u201ccum-ex\u201d dividend-stripping scandal, where a group of investment bankers currently on trial in Bonn are are accused of having defrauded the German state of millions of euros. \u201cI didn\u2019t rob supermarkets or old women,\u201d Jauernik said.\n\nThe judge said he had shown limited compassion for banks\u2019 employees. \u201cYou suffer from a narcissistic personality disorder, which was on display to everyone who followed the main trial,\u201d she said in her verdict.\n\nA psychiatric expert witness noted that Jauernik had a tendency to talk about his crimes as if \u201crecounting mischief from his school days\u201d.\n\nJauernik is now likely to spend the rest of his life in custody.", "description": "Judge says she regrets not curtailing Michael Jauernik\u2019s closing statement sooner", "authors": ["Philip Oltermann"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e9e8f94c33784a8582b5c8c8a9dde6b46969377/1044_252_2088_1253/master/2088.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=64e6ba8ce8b8736438d2cab910a20b89", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
