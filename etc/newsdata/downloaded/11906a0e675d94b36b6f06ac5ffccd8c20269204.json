James Mattis roasts Pres. Trump: \"I earned my spurs on the battlefield.\" https://t.co/KWUs9cJPvX pic.twitter.com/zdexSTSfCg \u2014 ABC News (@ABC) October 18, 2019\n\nMattis, a retired Marine Corps four-star general, served as Trump's first defense secretary, but resigned in December 2018 over policy differences, particularly Trump's plans to pull out American troops from Syria, writing in his resignation letter that Trump should have a defense secretary \"whose views are better aligned\" with his own.\n\nThe former secretary of defense directly referenced the \"most overrated general\" comment in a crack comparing himself to three-time Oscar-winning actress Meryl Streep.\n\n\"I'm not just an overrated general. I\u2019m the world\u2019s greatest overrated general,\" he joked. \"I'm honored to be called that by Donald Trump, because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actor. So I guess I\u2019m the Meryl Streep of generals.\"\n\nBloomberg via Getty Images, FILE\n\nHe went on to say, \"Between me and Meryl, at least we\u2019ve had some victories.\"\n\nMattis, who has been critical of many of Trump's foreign policy decisions since leaving office, also got serious for a moment Thursday, mentioning the U.S.'s Kurdish allies in Syria. He called for the U.S. to again back the population, which has been attacked by Turkey.\n\n\"Let us restore trust in one another,\" Mattis said.\n\nThe president was onstage in Dallas at the same time as Mattis' keynote, delivering a campaign speech to a packed crowd at American Airlines Center.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
