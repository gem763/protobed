In the parallel process to be decided by the WTO early next year, Brussels is pushing for tariffs of around $10bn on American goods.\n\nOn Tuesday, the head of Ryanair urged the US and EU to pull back from the brink of a tariff war and said neither side\u2019s aviation industry would survive a long dispute.\n\nBut Peter Harrell, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Center for a New American Security, saw no immediate peace deal.\n\n\u201cMy sense is that there will be a settlement only after both sides have imposed tariffs on each other,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the level of tariffs amounts to less than three days\u2019 worth of annual trade between Europe and the US, American importers have urged Washington to be selective when choosing industries to hit in order to avoid causing collateral damage to the US economy.\n\nEU manufacturers are already facing US tariffs on steel and aluminium and a threat from Donald Trump to penalise EU cars and car parts. The EU has in turn retaliated.\n\nThe Trump administration has concluded tariffs were effective in bringing China to the negotiating table over trade, and in convincing Japan to open its agricultural market to US products. Washington is unlikely to skip the opportunity to implement tariffs in the case over aircraft subsidies, according to current and former US officials.\n\nAirbus has said this would lead to a \u201close-lose\u201d trade war and has published a video stressing its contribution to the US industry through local assembly plants and 4,000 direct jobs.\n\nReuters", "description": "The World Trade Organization (WTO) has ruled that the US can impose tariffs on $7.5bn (\u00a36.1bn) worth of European goods over illegal EU subsidies to Airbus.The WTO has also found that the aircraft maker\u2019s US rival Boeing received billions of dollars of illegal subsidies but is yet to decide on the measures", "authors": ["Philip Blenkinsop", "Tim Hepher"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VEcvdsec8iEyUme.PfLd3w--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/4101ca2a32d5bd359e0707654f158009"}
