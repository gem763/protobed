Total mail volume has dropped 31 percent and first class mail has fallen 41 percent since 2007.\n\nUnlike nearly every other government agency, USPS is required to pre-fund health benefits for postal retirees. This mandate accounts for 80 percent of those losses, Brennan said. The Postal Service has defaulted on $48 billion in these mandatory payments since 2012 to conserve cash.\n\nIf USPS made all of these legally mandated payments in 2019, it will be out of cash in 2020, Brennan said.\n\nIn fiscal 2018, the USPS had about $200 million of cash on hand for about two months on any given day. Ideally, Brennan said her agency should have $20 billion in cash on hand for about 100 days.\n\nNearly everyone on the House Oversight Committee agreed the Postal Service\u2019s financial situation has become untenable. The committee has tried for years to advance comprehensive postal reform. It unanimously passed a postal bill back in 2017, but the legislation never made it to the House floor for a vote.\n\n\u201cIt is our responsibility to move further than we did in the past,\u201d Rep. Elijah Cummings, the committee\u2019s chairman. \u201cWe now have a whole new Congress. We now have members who are new to this committee and new to this issue. I hope today\u2019s hearing will be an opportunity for all of our members, new and old, to get an overview of the challenges faced by our Postal Service and to get an update on its current financial condition and to hear about the many different proposals that have been made for reform.\u201d\n\nA variety of stakeholders have weighed in over the years with these proposals. The President\u2019s Postal Reform Task Force late last year recommended a series of changes to the USPS, including its handling of collective bargaining rights for postal unions.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget in its government reorganization plan recommended privatization.\n\n\u201cThe crisis here is much more dire, I think, than a lot of people are recognizing. Those health care costs keep accruing every year. First-class mail volume keeps plunging,\u201d Chris Edwards, director of tax policy for the Cato Institute, said. \u201cWe should let USPS defend itself, and the way to do that is to privatize them, open them up, give them a pricing flexibility and let them diversify them into other businesses.\u201d\n\nUSPS finalizing financial stability business plan\n\nBrennan said she is working with the Postal Board of Governors to write a business plan that would restore financial stability to the USPS over the next 10 years. The goal, she said, is to find both cost-saving and revenue-producing methods to address a $125 billion funding shortfall, which the agency will experience over the next decade.\n\nBut for Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who said he has met with USPS more times over the course of his congressional career than any other agency, the Postal Service should be moving with much more urgency on a financial stability plan.\n\n\u201cHow long are we going to have to wait for a plan to come from the board, Ms. Brennan? We\u2019ve been dealing with this; it\u2019s been in crisis mode for two or three years,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cWhen are we going to have a plan?\u201d\n\nMeadows and Brennan sparred over the timing and communication of this plan several times during Tuesday\u2019s hearing.\n\n\u201cYes, and if this committee had acted and if we able to pass reform we\u2019d be in a much better position today,\u201d Brennan said.\n\nThe plan itself is being finalized, and Brennan said she would deliver the plan to the committee within the next 45 days or so.\n\nStill, Brennan insisted Congress could get started on its own by developing legislative proposals to implement key changes that many stakeholders have agreed on.\n\nPostal unions and others, for example, have said Congress should eliminate the mandate for USPS to pre-fund retirees\u2019 health benefits. This mandate started back in 2006 and has been a challenge for the Postal Service since.\n\n\u201cThis committee can act now on the core provisions that have been communicated, that have gained broad support among key stakeholders and that will go a long way in putting us on firmer financial footing and giving us some runway to try to build consensus for a plan that will address broader structural issues,\u201d Brennan said.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to do a part-time bailout,\u201d Meadows said. \u201cI think the Chairman would agree with me here, we want a plan so you\u2019re not back here in two years asking for more money.\u201d\n\nCummings said Brennan and the Postal Service would discuss the plan at a public hearing sometime in early July.\n\nThough the USPS business plan isn\u2019t finished, Brennan did preview some of the options that the board is considering. Reducing USPS mail delivery from six to five days with seven-day package delivery, is a possibility.\n\nIt\u2019s an option, Brennan said, after Meadows reminded her Congress had once considered a similar proposal that never went far.\n\n\u201cQuit wasting our time, Ms. Brennan,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have very little time to get this done. You\u2019re saying you\u2019re going to deliver packages seven days a week and deliver mail five days a week. I do not understand that.\u201d\n\nMany members on the committee understood Meadows\u2019 frustration over the need for urgency.\n\n\u201cThis is a slow-motion trainwreck that keeps getting worse while Congress looks on. The situation is untenable under current law, and congressional action is required to stop the bleeding and prevent a catastrophic financial reckoning,\u201d Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the committee\u2019s ranking member, said. \u201cReforms have been right in front of us for a decade, but we\u2019ve lacked the courage to act.\u201d\n\nThe new members of Congress that Cummings said he hoped would get involved in the committee\u2019s work on postal reform also weighed in.\n\n\u201c[USPS needs] a plan, but we need a plan,\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said, referring to the committee. \u201cCongress needs a plan.\u201d\n\nBut for now, a specific plan for postal reform still seems elusive.\n\n\u201cThe thing that really concerns me is we were so much there. We had a solution. It was a solution that I felt pretty good about. Mr. Meadows felt pretty good about it,\u201d Cummings said of the committee\u2019s 2017 bill. \u201cHow we\u2019re going to be able to get back to that level of comfort \u2026 I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re going to do that, but we\u2019re going to try.\u201d\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Federal News Network.
