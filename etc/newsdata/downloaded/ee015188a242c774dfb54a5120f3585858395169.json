Four years after that, she suffered a tragedy.\n\nWhite, now 62, was engaged to actor John Gibson from \"The Young and the Restless,\" who died when the plane he was flying crashed near Los Angeles in 1986.\n\n\u201cThe second I heard about it, I fell to my knees,\" White told People magazine in a new interview published Thursday. \"It was just devastating.\u201d\n\n'WHEEL OF FORTUNE' CONTESTANT WHO JOKED ABOUT 'LOVELESS MARRIAGE' SAYS HE WANTED TO 'KEEP IT REAL'\n\nLooking back, White credited her fans from \"Wheel of Fortune\" for helping her through the difficult time.\n\n\u201cI heard from so many people who had shared the same experience of losing someone instantly in an accident, and that really helped me,\" she said. \"I didn\u2019t feel like I was alone. Because when something like that happens, you immediately think you\u2019re the only one.\u201d\n\nIn 1990, White married restauranteur George Santo Pietro. Two years later she announced her pregnancy through a puzzle on the famous game show -- the answer to one round was \"Vanna's pregnant.\"\n\n\u201cI so wanted to be pregnant and have a baby, so then when I finally got pregnant, I wanted to tell the world immediately,\u201d White said.\n\nBut just a week later, White suffered a miscarriage.\n\n\u201cObviously I lost the baby, which was devastating after announcing it,\" she told People. \"The good news is I was able to get pregnant again and had two beautiful, healthy children. But losing a child -- there\u2019s nothing good about that.\u201d\n\nAfter the miscarriage, White again turned to fans for support.\n\n'WHEEL OF FORTUNE' HOSTESS VANNA WHITE REVEALS THE ONLY ARGUMENT SHE AND PAT SAJAK HAVE EVER HAD IN 36 YEARS\n\n\u201cYou have to take their support and try to be strong. It\u2019s so hard, but you just have to think, \u2018What would they want me to do?\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nWhite said her faith helped her heal, as well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Christian and have always had my own personal relationship with God,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t preach about it, because everyone\u2019s entitled to their own beliefs. But I pray. I pray every day.\u201d\n\nWhite and Pietro split amicably in 2002. She has found love again with real estate developer John Donaldson. The two aren't married but share a home together.\n\n\u201cI remember looking at him and thinking, \u2018He\u2019s really cute.' We ended up talking for a long time that night,\" she said. \"It just works. He lets me be me, I let him be him. There is no drama.\u201d\n\nWhite also said that she has no plans of leaving \"Wheel of Fortune\" in the immediate future.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re one big family,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "37 years ago, Vanna White began turning letters on \"Wheel of Fortune\" and just four years after that, she suffered a tragedy.", "authors": ["Nate Day"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/05/Vanna-White-Getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
