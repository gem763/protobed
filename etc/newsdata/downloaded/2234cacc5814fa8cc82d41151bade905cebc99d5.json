It styles itself as New York\u2019s first gay hotel, \u201cthe Big Apple\u2019s local sanctuary\u201d for a clientele of jet-setting homosexual tourists from Pittsburgh and Fresno. Opened in the summer of 2012, the hotel\u2019s steel-and-glass-and-marble-and-more-glass aesthetic aims for posh futurism and manages neither.\n\nThe Out NYC boasts a middling faux-Mediterranean restaurant, a vast and chilly discotheque, chairs that look like human faces, and this year, the 8th Annual International Escort Awards. The Hookies, for short.\n\nHosted by Rentboy.com, the world\u2019s largest listing service for male escorts, the awards purport to honor the work of Rentboy\u2019s more than 170,000 listed escorts in sixteen categories, ranging from Best Daddy and Best Massage to the night\u2019s titular honor: Mr. International Escort. The votes are tallied online\u2014there\u2019s no form to fill out after you\u2019ve had a satisfactory appointment. One needn\u2019t even be a registered client on Rentboy.com to vote. So how does one judge an escort\u2019s prowess if one has not engaged the escort in sexual congress? One porn star who insists that he remain nameless ventures a guess. \u201cA lot of this is just a front for the porn industry. Ever check out the banner ads on Rentboy.com? All porn studios.\u201d He nods knowingly.\n\nGALLERY: The 2014 Hookie Awards in NYC (PHOTOS)\n\nInside BPM, a work of nightclub necromancy that began life 26 blocks downtown under the name XL, tank-topped volunteers are flitting between narrow cocktail tables, depositing plastic gift bags on each seat. Inside each bag: one \u201cWorking Boys\u201d 2014 calendar; one catalogue from Chez Priape, Montr\u00e9al\u2019s premiere fetish and leather store; one ad for DJ Tony Moran\u2019s appearance at this June\u2019s Pride celebrations; one ad for the hotel\u2019s $25 bottomless brunch; one Lube Shooter Lubricant Delivery Device, which I initially mistake for a water pistol.\n\nAt the club\u2019s entrance, a young man in a V-neck shirt pleads with the bouncer that he\u2019s a nominee. \u201cWait in line,\u201d says the bouncer, already bored. Behind the putative nominee, the escort aficionados who have paid anywhere from $10 to $65 to attend are mostly men, mostly middle-aged, and mostly embarrassed to be seen here. Once inside, they move to the darker recesses of the club, eyes trained on the stretch of red carpet where the evening\u2019s honorees will be interviewed, kissed, and stripped by Mr. Pam, gay porn\u2019s only female videographer.\n\n\u201cI love my hookers!\u201d Mr. Pam shouts. The tangle of enormous fake diamonds resting on top of her cleavage sparkles at every flashbulb. \u201cThey give the world so much pleasure! And really, isn\u2019t that the reason we\u2019re all here?\u201d Most of the nominees I speak to don\u2019t know who she is\u2014a few even think she\u2019s just a highly convincing drag queen\u2014but Mr. Pam is a force in the gay porn industry, having directed or shot with nearly every major studio. According to her, about two-thirds of the porn stars at her \u201chigh-end indie\u201d production company, Naked Sword, are escorts. \u201cA lot of escorts actually start doing porn as a way to raise their rates.\u201d\n\nAccording to Melissa Gira Grant\u2019s Playing the Whore: The Work of Sex Work, participation in the different \u201ccareer paths\u201d in sex work often overlaps\u2014and it\u2019s not just for financial gain. \u201cIt\u2019s about more than maximizing the earning potential; it\u2019s also a way to negotiate the varying degrees of exposure and surveillance that come with each venue.\u201d For every rentboy who does porn to increase his street value, there\u2019s another who would never give up his relative anonymity by having video of his work posted online. Hookies nominees are a breed apart, however\u2014no blurred-out profile photos attempt to hide their faces or identities. Many have even taken on their \u201cescort name\u201d as their everyday appellation, in the name of maintaining their \u201cbrand.\u201d As Mr. Pam notes, \u201cEveryone wants to be with a porn star!\u201d\n\nPorn actor Leo Sweetwood\u2014n\u00e9 Peter\u2014isn\u2019t so sure. \u201cI\u2019m just here to see what the escorting scene is\u2014test out the waters before I, like, jump in? Porn stars get a lot more advertising. There\u2019s a lot more publicity in the escorting scene when you also do porn. But the best escorts? Nobody knows who they are.\u201d He\u2019s wearing gilded sneakers with an Oriental dragon design and looks intimidated, despite his status as a \u201ctwunk\u201d\u2014a portmanteau of \u201chunk\u201d and \u201ctwink\u201d indicating a young, more-cute-than-handsome guy with musculature and boyish features.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from outside San Antonio, Texas. Just a nice, Texan upbringing, and now I\u2019m here!\u201d There\u2019s a tinge of regret to this statement. \u201cI\u2019m definitely seeing the better side of the escorting scene. Escorting the proper way.\u201d He laughs at the unintentional contradiction of that statement. \u201cSo much of what you see here doesn\u2019t really represent the, y\u2019know, other side of the business.\u201d\n\nWhy the hesitation about moving from porn to escorting? Is sex with a stranger really that different from sex with a stranger in front of a camera? \u201cBeing able to control the terms of the interaction is important. When you\u2019re on a shoot, you\u2019re an employee, obviously, but you\u2019re kind of an equal. If you\u2019re an escort, you\u2019re basically at the mercy\u2026\u201d He rethinks the term. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna have to say yes. Not that these guys\u201d\u2014he gestures towards the huddled attendees\u2014\u201care bad! A lot of \u2018em just want companionship.\u201d\n\nThe early bird attendees look terrified at the prospect. Even Robert, a fiftysomething fan who has attended the Hookies three times, prefers to survey the action from a catwalk above the red carpet than to meet his fantasy figures in the flesh. \u201cI\u2019m kinda bored with the studios. I actually really like Tumblr! I barely check out the studio sites anymore.\u201d He\u2019s on the prowl, hoping for a glimpse of porn star Darius Ferdynand. \u201cI think that porn has gotten so much raunchier. Like, before HIV, cum was no big deal, it just happened. Now, it\u2019s gotten so fetishized, like, it has to be everywhere.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s less passionate about the perforated boundaries between Porn World and Escort World. \u201cThey get paid shit to make all those videos, so of course they have to hustle to survive. I suppose on one level, it\u2019s sad.\u201d But as someone who prefers his pornography ad- and subscription-free, isn\u2019t he contributing to the problem of porn star penury? \u201cYeah, I feel bad about it. But, you know\u2026\u201d He trails off when he spots Bravo Delta, a former amateur porn actor who caught the eye of ascendant New York outfit CockyBoys.\n\nIs it hard to get off when you can reasonably assume that the person on the other side of the screen is performing out of desperation? \u201cI\u2019d really rather not talk about it.\u201d Robert excuses himself, uncomfortable with the line of questioning, or with his own fantasies being disrupted by the fact that many sex workers start their \u201ccareers\u201d as homeless youth. According to the National Coalition for the Homeless, LGBT youth are more susceptible to victimization and mental health problems once they become homeless. The group said nearly 60 percent of homeless LGBT youth have been sexually assaulted, often in the form of underage prostitution.\n\nRobert isn\u2019t alone\u2014the men who have come to see their fantasies in person prefer to keep their distance. Typically, their relationships with their idols are a private affair, far from the flashbulbs\u2014here, their fantasies are discomfortingly made flesh.\n\nBravo Delta himself seems even more uncomfortable with the attention than his fans are with lavishing it. Unlike the nominees, who are dressed up in leather, rubber, spikes, and mesh, he\u2019s wearing a blue flannel button-down and no-name dungarees. During the week, he\u2019s a software engineer\u2014according to him, porn is for weekends, and for fun. \u201cI\u2019m not an escort. I\u2019ve thought about it, but honestly? I\u2019m not a \u2018people person.\u2019 It\u2019d probably just be some poor guy sitting there awkwardly with me for an hour. I\u2019m\u2026 pretty weird.\u201d Slight pause. \u201cAt least with porn, we both want to do this. There\u2019s no guarantee I\u2019m going to be into anybody.\u201d\n\nStill, he clearly enjoys the spectacle. \u201cLast year, this all took place during [drug-fueled dance extravaganza] the Black Party, which was a huge mistake. [Porn star and Best Newcomer 2013] J.D. Phoenix won something, and nobody could find him because he was backstage blowing somebody.\u201d He betrays a small smile at the ridiculousness of it all, one of the more overt acknowledgements of the irony behind this entire spectacle. Self-awareness at the ridiculousness of the Hookies hides just under Mr. Pam\u2019s waxy makeup and the too-tight tuxedos and the self-conscious sleekness of the venue. If an appointment with an escort is about living a fantasy of hot sex or true love or good companionship, the Hookies are about the fantasy of a society that celebrates its least-loved figure: the gay prostitute.\n\nOnstage, a trio of dancers in elaborate underwear sway lazily to generic synth beats.\n\nAt BPM\u2019s entrance, nominees and press are piling up around the red carpet, a rectangular patch roughly the size of a four square court on which Mr. Pam is chatting up presenter Jason Dottley. He seems insulted when I ask if he\u2019s a nominee. \u201cI\u2019m an actor of the non-porn persuasion,\u201d he clarifies snottily. What\u2019s his involvement in the escorting world or Rentboy.com? \u201cHonestly? I haven\u2019t even seen the website. My publicist called me up and was like, \u2018Would you wanna to do this?\u2019 and so I did. I mean, I\u2019ve watched a lot of porn and I\u2019ve met a lot of escorts. I\u2019m gonna be so horny tonight, I might jerk off between every award.\u201d\n\nA familiar face swings into view. Duncan Black, another nominee in the Best Newcomer category\u2014as well as Best Ass, about which he is much more excited\u2014and the subject of an earlier profile introduces me to a diminutive young man with Old Bieber hair and a silver bow tie.\n\nThis is Eli Lewis, whose face-et-cetera has been all over Rentboy.com\u2019s Twitter page for the past week. The self-described \u201cPocket Gaysian\u201d seems to be the only Hookies organizer who manages to stay on point. \u201cI run social media for Rentboy, and I also escort and do porn!\u201d Every few seconds, an escort or admirer comes by to give Lewis a quick hug or butt-squeeze. \u201cWe do a lot of really hard work, and we should be recognized for it!\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s a little nebulous on the mechanics of the nominations\u2014how does an escort go about getting a nod for Best Boyfriend Fantasy or Best Masseur? \u201cA lot of the nominees I know through social networking, plus I\u2019m friends with a lot more.\u201d The fact that many of the nominees are porn actors affiliated with the site\u2019s biggest advertisers is, according to Lewis, merely a function of press. \u201cPorn stars have the biggest social media followings, so they can garner the most votes for nominations, as opposed to pure escorts\u201d\u2014a term he uses without consciousness of its irony\u2014\u201cwho don\u2019t have that kind of audience.\u201d According to Lewis, about 80 percent of the nominees are involved in porn.\n\nLewis waves at Tony Orion, a nominee up for Best Bear/Cub whose biceps have stretched his black mesh jersey to a shine. A dog collar around his neck says \u201cBoeuf.\u201d Along with Lewis, Orion is one of the few minority escorts to be seen. Lewis admits that as an escort and porn star of Asian descent, he\u2019s more \u201cniche\u201d than mainstream\u2014of the 77 escorts nominated tonight, only one self-identifies as Asian. \u201cWe\u2019re getting more ethnically diverse, but it could be more so.\u201d Lewis shrugs.\n\nPressed five deep next to the red carpet, the men waiting to for their on-camera chat with Mr. Pam are wearing suits and mesh and white spandex and skinny jeans and lam\u00e9 and nothing. One man, clearly up for Best Fetish/Kink Escort, is unidentifiable in a hooded, rubberized version of a monsignor\u2019s cassock, holding something the size and shape of a dead lobster in a Glad bag. At the hands of Mr. Pam, asses are bared in full view of the unforgiving cameras\u2014one gentleman in a kilt goes for the full Lindsay Lohan up-skirt shot.\n\nAs the crowd thickens, any potential for erotic tension evaporates. It\u2019s remarkable how un-sexy it all is. In Porn World and Escort World, sex is always just a pretext away: Picking up a hitchhiker, ordering a pizza, an after-school tutoring session. You might expect the collision of porn stars and escorts with their fans and clients to bring those same triple-X fantasies to life, but the frisson between the bored nominees and their timid fans is nearly nonexistent.\n\nAnother surprising absence: There are no condoms. Not in the gift bags, or at the bar, or in the bathroom, or anywhere. Never once in the course of the evening does one nominee, attendee, host, or presenter mention safe sex. Granted, due to a lack of government interest in the welfare of sex workers, data on HIV rates in escorts aren\u2019t abundant. There aren\u2019t a lot of votes in allocating money to tell hookers about using protection.\n\nThe Hookies open with a performance by Boston-based rapper/songwriter/louchebag Cazwell. \u201cThis song is dedicated to anybody who just so happens to be in love\u2026 With themselves!\u201d To the disappointment of an industry journalist standing nearby, he does not sing \u201cAll Over Your Face,\u201d a 2006 single that ranks among the most disgusting songs you\u2019ve never heard. \u201cOver it,\u201d the journalist announces. Leslie Jordan, former Will & Grace scene stealer and host of tonight\u2019s festivities, and drag queen Shequida take the stage. Jordan can barely muster a damn to give in his monologue about giving a boy his lunch money when he was 14 in exchange for sexual favors. It\u2019s not until an interlude between awards that Jordan shows any interest, when he risks death by crushed pelvis during a group lapdance performed by a half-dozen hulking nominees.\n\nDottley, \u201cactor of the non-porn persuasion\u201d and potential backstage onanist, hands out the Hookie for Best Newcomer. \u201cI\u2019ve fucked every guy in this category!\u201d he shouts hoarsely (This feat must have occurred in the roughly thirty minutes since he claimed not to have even browsed Rentboy.com before arriving.) The audience reaction is muted\u2014who is this guy, anyway? Nearly every presenter tonight makes a joke about having sampled the wares; not a single one elicits more than a few chuckles. It\u2019s almost as if the entire audience is saying: \u201cGirl, we\u2019ve all been there.\u201d Duncan Black wins.\n\nTommy Defendi accepts his Hookie for Best Porn Star Escort, thanking his clients: \u201cYou made me the hooker I am today!\u201d The audience gasps when it is revealed that there is a tie in the Best Top category. \u201cWell they can\u2019t fuck each other!\u201d Jordan bleats. The Onion gets the biggest laugh of the night when Shequida replays a classic 2012 election spoof: \u201cTampa Bay Gay Prostitutes Gearing Up For Flood Of Closeted Republicans.\u201d The show is roughly at the same level of raunchiness\u2014or even its tamer sister, bawdiness\u2014as a mid-rent gay club.\n\nThe curtained-off \u201cbackstage\u201d area is unguarded and chaotic. Winners pose for photographs and send their friends \u201cI WON!!!!!!\u201d texts. The nominees for Mr. International Escort 2014 are hugging and playfully kissing \u2014 Mr. Chicago and Mr. New York, less playfully.\n\nThe two \u201cTrophy Boys,\u201d a pair of be-jockstrapped young men who hand out the physical Hookie, come backstage. I immediately recognize one of them as a college classmate, a nice Jewish boy from a well-heeled New England suburb. About fifteen worlds are colliding at once when a hand clasps my shoulder. It\u2019s Duncan Black. \u201cHey!\u201d The Best Ass Hookie is about to be announced, and Black is nervously biting his lip. \u201cThis is the one I really wanted to win.\u201d He hops up and down like a little boy\u2014though at 23, he is a boy, really\u2014as the names of the other nominees are called out. \u201cAnd the winner is\u2026 Duncan Black!\u201d\n\nBlack squeals and runs onstage. He\u2019s too far back from the microphone to hear his acceptance speech, but that doesn\u2019t stop some of the other nominees from mocking the earnestness of his excitement. \u201cWho\u2019s he gonna thank next\u2014his mom?\u201d one says bitchily. \u201cI honestly think he just did. It\u2019s a joke, sweetie,\u201d the other clucks. The post-ironic acknowledgment of the night\u2019s absurdity has taken its purest form: two catty gay dudes.\n\nBackstage, Black is giving everyone hugs. He screams a little. \u201cI\u2019m so excited!\u201d The physical Hookie is an etched glass paperweight in the shape of a brilliant-cut diamond. I\u2019m not sure what I expected, but it wasn\u2019t this. All of the work that comes with being an escort, and all of its attendant horrors, for this\u2026 paperweight? Does this hunk of glass make up for his untenable relationships? The skyrocketing statistical likelihood that he\u2019s going to be a victim of sexual violence, if he hasn\u2019t already? That, at age 23, he has eliminated all careers paths not directly related to sex work? Black is grinning like a Little Leaguer who\u2019s just been awarded a trophy for participation. I can\u2019t bring myself to ask him these questions, and I can\u2019t bring myself to ignore them.\n\nA friend of his insists that we take a photo together. I hesitate\u2014there\u2019s nothing more intimidating than being photographed next to a person who just won an award for his attractiveness\u2014but Black dismisses my concern. \u201cYou know what? You\u2019re your own worst critic. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned in this business. I\u2019ll be in a shoot, hating on my skin or my hair or whatever, and everyone still loves me.\u201d\n\nAfter hometown favorite Boomer Banks is crowned Mr. International Escort 2014, BPM clears out. Most attendees are headed for a nightclub nearby\u2014a few of the CockyBoys actors will be dancing. Lingering backstage, I manage to catch the eyes of my former classmate. He gives me an un-ironic hug, although he\u2019s careful not to rub off any of his bronzer. \u201cWe\u2019re going out! You should come! Just for one drink.\u201d When I cite a deadline, they start dishing on the nominees.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019d he get so big?\u201d\n\n\u201cUgh, he\u2019s so on steroids. His back is, like, one giant pimple.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow much does he make?\u201d\n\n\u201c$400.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn hour? Are you effing serious?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd at the studio? He makes $150 per day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a fucking joke. He might as well do it for free.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re good at something, never do it for free.\u201d", "description": "The finalists were hot, their fans were shy\u2014welcome to an uncomfortable evening celebrating the sex economy at the International Escort Awards.", "authors": ["Scott Bixby", "National Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1439,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1492201566/articles/2014/03/24/and-the-escort-of-the-year-is-backstage-at-the-sex-oscars/140323-bixby-hookies-tease_u13uif", "published_at": "2014-03-24"}
