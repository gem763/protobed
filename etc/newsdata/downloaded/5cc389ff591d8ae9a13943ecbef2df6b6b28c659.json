Now there are plans to expand it, which is why Hill was contacting AFR Weekend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe, Angus and Marks are on the board of the Jack Brockhoff Foundation, known in Melbourne as JBF, which provides research grants for medicine and other good causes.\n\nIn 2016, they switched the focus of the medical grants from funding senior researchers to funding projects for young researchers. Since then, JBF has awarded 36 \u2018Early Career Research Grants\u2019.\n\n\u201cThese have been very well received and we\u2019ve had some very encouraging letters from heads of institutes saying this hits a sweet spot in developing our young talent,\" says Hill.\n\n\u201cOur only regret is that we attract far more high-quality applications than JBF can afford to fund. Our budget for the scheme is $700,000 per annum.\n\nProfessor Robin Marks\n\nHill wants potential philanthropists \u2013 who often have difficulty assessing the worthiness of an enterprise in need of support \u2013 to know about this scheme, which could spend at least $1 million a year without wasting a cent.\n\n\u201cThe foundation is willing to share access to as yet unfunded, high-quality applicants with no financial benefit to JBF. We have some excellent proposals waiting to be funded.\n\n\u201cEarly bibliometric data shows our young grantees are generally making a substantial scientific impact already \u2013 well above world averages for their fields. A few are doing spectacularly better.\n\n\u201cMost already have a field-weighted citation index equivalent to those who have spent their careers in the field worldwide.\u201d\n\nSome, like Dr Ryan Cross, are three times more highly cited. Cross describes receiving a JBF grant in 2016 as emotionally massive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'Early validation'\n\n\u201cHere was an external organisation providing validation that you think creatively, that you have promise. In academia this is rare because most of the time you apply for grants, you try to get published and your ego is constantly bruised.\n\n\u201cThis early validation gives you confidence in yourself and your research.\u201d\n\nCross, who does research into brain cancer at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in Melbourne, says other recipients say this too.\n\n\u201cThese grants give us the assurance and the flexibility to take bold, exciting new ideas forward, rather than sitting on them worrying that we have not been in science long enough to know whether they are novel and new or old and disproven.\u201d\n\nI could feel their struggle and I wanted to make a difference. \u2014 Dr Ryan Cross, JBF grant recipient\n\nThe $110,000 he received over two years gave him a direct experience of the non-linear nature of scientific discovery. The original idea, for which he received the grant, still hasn\u2019t worked.\n\nBut in the process of investigating it, he developed a technology which has far greater potential. This has seen him become a primary investigator in more than $720,000 in further funding from foundations such as Cure Brain Cancer Foundation and Financial Markets Foundation for Children.\n\nHis technology allows for the exploration of many new ways of targeting brain cancer using immunotherapy.\n\nThis therapy takes blood from a patient and repurposes its cancer-fighting immune cells. Then it returns these cells to the patient where they attack their own tumours.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt works extremely well in some cancers and now the race is on to make it effective in brain cancer too.\n\nEarlier, when Cross was doing his PhD at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, he often worked weekends and would mill around chatting to cancer patients.\n\n\u201cI could feel their struggle and I wanted to make a difference. So, I moved from basic biology to an area where it may be possible to make a fast impact on their lives.\n\n\u201cThen I met a brilliant young neurosurgeon who said her patients have no therapies and that I should direct my efforts to brain cancer.\u201d\n\nThe quality is there, the need is there, and if this could be translated to other areas of science too, we would welcome it. \u2014 Professor James Angus\n\nCross threw himself into it. \u201cMy focus is creating something that can translate into the clinic and I now dedicate all my energies and resources to this.\u201d\n\nAs to his original idea, Cross, 31, says, \u201cIt\u2019s not a dead end, I\u2019ll circle back to it.\u201d\n\nProfessor Angus, a past chairman of the grants committee of the NHMRC, says JBF grants give researchers an opportunity to show how good they are by winning further grants, by getting promotion, by their outputs and maybe by ideas that go onto commercialisation.\n\n\u201cWe will keep tracking them over the next decade or two and I\u2019d be surprised if most did not become outstanding scientists.\u201d\n\nFor Angus, the scheme has echoes of \u201cthe Friday afternoon experiment\u201d which once ran at Melbourne\u2019s Florey Institute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a free space for young researchers to investigate lateral, fresh ideas that had shot off from a solid piece of funded research they were working on.\n\n\u201cIt allowed them to have a go,\u201d says Angus,\n\n\u201cNow that we have been doing the JBF grants through three or four cycles, we have confidence that we are picking the right people. The quality is there, the need is there, and if this could be translated to other areas of science too, we would welcome it.\n\n\u201cWhile JBF grants are restricted to Victoria, we would love for other states to take this up in some way.\u201d\n\nConditions of entry\n\nSo how does it work?\n\nApplicants must have graduated with a PhD within the previous three years and their salary must be certain.\n\nThey need to propose an idea that is genuinely original and not shaped by their laboratory head. They also need to identify an unconflicted referee to provide an assessment of their project, and their employing institution has to guarantee 50 per cent of their time to work on it.\n\nSuccessful candidates receive up to $70,000 per year for up to two years, which allows them to \u2018own\u2019, manage and publish a piece of research.\n\nA great admirer of David Hill, Angus says, \u201cThe scheme was David\u2019s idea, and we have a wonderful application form which he almost single-handedly wrote.\n\n\"I\u2019ve seen a lot of application forms in my time and it is the simplest. It asks the right questions, it is spare and not deluged by words. It ends by simply asking 'and what is your last pitch?'\u201d\n\nJill Margo is an adjunct associate professor at the University of NSW, Sydney.", "description": "Rather than encouraging the crazy, brilliant ideas of young scientists, we block them.
