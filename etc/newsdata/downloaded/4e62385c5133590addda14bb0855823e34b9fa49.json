Photo: United Artists\n\nThis post is updated regularly to reflect the latest movies to leave and enter Netflix. *New additions are indicated by an asterisk.\n\nWith thousands of movies to choose from, and a navigation system and algorithm that don\u2019t always make the right choice easy to find, it can be difficult to know what to watch on Netflix. That\u2019s why we\u2019re here, breaking down the 100 best movies on the service at this minute, with regular updates for titles that have been removed and when new ones are added. We\u2019ve done the hard work, so now the only thing you have to do is sit back and, uh, watch all 100 movies. (And if you\u2019re more of a TV person, check out the 50 best TV shows on Netflix.)\n\n13th\n\nAva DuVernay\u2019s documentary is named after the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which ended slavery. Her brilliant nonfiction work outlines the way that slavery has simply been reshaped and reformed into other societal elements, particularly imbalanced prison sentences and enforcement of laws that more directly impact minorities. It\u2019s a searing, powerful piece of work.\n\nA Separation\n\nAsghar Farhadi\u2019s Oscar winner is one of the best films of the 2010s, a powerful examination of the impact of one couple\u2019s separation on those around them, including their daughter and a caregiver hired by the man to watch over his father. It\u2019s the first Iranian film to win the Oscar for Foreign Language Film, and a great introduction to that country\u2019s excellent film industry.\n\nAbout a Boy\n\nContaining possibly Hugh Grant\u2019s best performance, this delicate adaptation of the Nick Hornby novel tells the story of a grown man who learns how to behave in life through his friendship with a young boy. With great performances by Nicholas Hoult and Toni Collette, along with a script nominated for an Oscar, this is a movie that young viewers may not have caught up with yet but shouldn\u2019t miss.\n\nAcross the Universe\n\nLove it or hate it, you really need to see Julie Taymor\u2019s romantic drama inspired by the music of the Beatles. There aren\u2019t many big-screen musicals out there quite like this trippy, dreamy flick starring Jim Sturgess and Westworld\u2019s Evan Rachel Wood, and Taymor\u2019s theatrical background gives the whole film a larger-than-life magical quality, especially if you\u2019re a fan of Paul, John, George, and Ringo.\n\nAmerican Honey\n\nAndrea Arnold\u2019s 2016 teen epic about a runaway (Sasha Lane) who finds herself a part of a crew of young people bouncing their way across the country \u2014 including Shia LaBeouf and Riley Keough \u2014 is the best movie on Netflix that you probably haven\u2019t seen. With propulsive energy, an amazing soundtrack, and beautiful cinematography of the heart of America, this is a fascinating movie that deserves a look.\n\nAmerican Psycho\n\nBefore Christian Bale became Batman or won an Oscar, he was Patrick Bateman in Mary Harron\u2019s 2000 adaptation of the controversial novel by Bret Easton Ellis. People often meme and gif American Psycho without really digging into why this movie is so good. It\u2019s not just another serial-killer story, but also a dark vision of privilege and \u201880s narcissism. It\u2019s funny and scary in equal measure, with a totally fearless performance from one of the best actors of his generation.\n\nAmy\n\nThe Oscar-winning documentary about Amy Winehouse not only details the rise and early death of its subject but confronts viewers with the way that tabloid culture impacts celebrities who may be prone to addiction. Winehouse was a generational talent, but this is a must-watch not only for chronicling her ability but also asking who let her down, depriving the music world of that talent today.\n\nAs Good As It Gets\n\nVery few films have won Oscars for both Best Actor and Best Actress. In fact, this romantic comedy, for which stars Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt both took home the big trophies, is the last time it happened. It\u2019s a great example of a film that plays perfectly to the strengths of both of its stars.\n\nThe Aviator\n\nNetflix is clearly prepping subscribers for Martin Scorcese\u2019s upcoming Netflix-exclusive film The Irishman by including several of his most beloved films (see: The Departed, also on this list). This one has slid a bit under history\u2019s radar, not being talked about as much as it should. It\u2019s a technical marvel for the plane-crash scene alone and includes one of Scorsese\u2019s best ensembles, including his old pal Leo alongside Cate Blanchett, Kate Beckinsale, and Jude Law, just to name a few.\n\nThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs\n\nJoel and Ethan Coen\u2019s Western anthology series was a part of Netflix\u2019s brand-redefining 2018. Sure, Netflix still has a bunch of junk, but it also landed the latest from Alfonso Cuaron, the Coens, and even Orson Welles. This brilliant Western works as comedy, drama, and even a commentary on the Coens themselves. Don\u2019t miss it.\n\n*Black Hawk Down\n\nRidley Scott directed this 2001 Hollywood version of Mark Bowden\u2019s non-fiction book of the same name, which tells the story of a 1993 incident in Mogadishu that became known around the world. Members of the U.S. Military (including Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana, and Tom Hardy) are pinned down in the city as they try to capture a faction leader. This is a technical marvel, winning Oscars for Best Editing and Sound Mixing.\n\nBlack Panther\n\nTake advantage of this opportunity before Disney+ guts all the Marvel and Disney movie options from every streaming service on the planet. The first MCU movie to win an Oscar is one of the best superhero movies of all time, and a movie that holds up incredibly well on repeat viewing. This isn\u2019t just an action movie, it\u2019s a cultural event \u2014 something that redefined and reshaped the superhero genre for the rest of time.\n\n*Blow\n\nTed Demme\u2019s drug drama was dismissed on its release as being too derivative of other crime epics of the era, but it has developed a pretty loyal following over the years. One of the reasons for that is that it contains one of Johnny Depp\u2019s last great performances, a totally committed turn as George Yung, a man caught up in the deadliest drug cartel in the world.\n\n*Blue Ruin\n\nJeremy Saulnier wrote and directed this 2013 breakthrough, a great little thriller that\u2019s reminiscent of the Coen Brothers\u2019 classic Blood Simple in its blunt, darkly humorous approach. Macon Blair plays Dwight, a vagrant who learns that the man who murdered his parents is about to be released from prison. Dwight takes action \u2013 that\u2019s all you need to know. This is a vicious thrill ride of a movie.\n\nBlue Valentine\n\nMichelle Williams just won her first Emmy, but so far, her deserved Oscar remains just out of reach. One of her best performances on the big screen is in this intimate, devastating dissection of the dissolution of a marriage, which also just so happens to contain arguably Ryan Gosling\u2019s best performance to date. They\u2019re both masterful here. You won\u2019t forget it.\n\nBoyhood\n\nFilmed in pieces over a 12-year span, Boyhood is one of the most ambitious films of the \u201810s, and one of the few films to notch an almost-impossible 100 on Metacritic. When people start listing the essential films of the decade in a few months, this will be on it. Make sure you\u2019ve seen it.\n\nBrick\n\nLong before he divided the world with Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson directed this brilliant teen noir, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, then known primarily as the kid from 3rd Rock From the Sun. It may take place in an ordinary California suburb, but the teens in this movie speak like their words were written by Dashiell Hammett or Jim Thompson. It\u2019s a riveting experiment in genre, and an announcement of a major writer/director talent.\n\nBurn After Reading\n\nJoel and Ethan Coen followed their Best Picture winner No Country For Old Men with one of their most cynical and hysterical movies, a comedy of errors about some incredibly stupid people. Brad Pitt, Frances McDormand, George Clooney, Richard Jenkins, John Malkovich, and J.K. Simmons star in a movie that\u2019s basically about, well, a bunch of total idiots. No one drops an f-bomb like John Malkovich.\n\nBurning\n\nThe best foreign-language film of 2018 is already on Netflix, hopefully indicating a deeper commitment by the company to present the best of international cinema to American audiences. Lee Chang-dong adapts a novella by Haruki Murakami into a riveting dissection of class and gender in modern Korea. Steven Yeun is mesmerizing as the mysterious Ben, someone who our protagonist starts to think might be a killer. Don\u2019t miss this one.\n\nCaddyshack\n\nOne of the most quotable comedies of all time makes its way to Netflix to encourage young subscribers to watch movies made before 1990. This one definitely has some funny dialogue and one-liners, but it\u2019s also a phenomenal example of how far casting can go to make a classic comedy. Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, Ted Knight, and Rodney Dangerfield weren\u2019t just hysterical here, they were all perfectly cast to play off their comedy reputations. Most of all, it\u2019s still damn funny.\n\nCarrie\n\nStephen King has arguably never been bigger than he is in 2019 with films like Pet Sematary and It: Chapter Two, and a new book in the Fall. Use this Brian De Palma masterpiece to flash back to a time when King wasn\u2019t yet a household name. Sissy Spacek gives one of her best performances as the title character, a bullied girl who discovers that she\u2019s not your ordinary teenager. This is still one of the best King adaptations of all time.\n\nCloud Atlas\n\nIt\u2019s amazing that a studio ever gave a movie this unabashedly bizarre a huge budget but that\u2019s what happened for the Wachowskis\u2019 2012 adaptation of David Mitchell\u2019s masterful book. When it was released, the film barely made a dent at the box office domestically and polarized critics, but it has built a loyal following over the years since. Don\u2019t be surprised if it shows up on a few \u201cbest of the decade\u201d lists. People who love this movie, really love this movie. See if you\u2019re one of them.\n\nCoco\n\nThere aren\u2019t a lot of Oscar-winning animated movies on Netflix. Sure, there are hours of options in the kids\u2019 section of Netflix, but most of it is mindless garbage. So if you\u2019re tired of letting your little ones watch nonsense, sit them down in front of one of the best animated movies of the last few years. This is a delicate, sweet, heartfelt movie about love and ancestry that would also be on a list of surefire tearjerkers now on Netflix.\n\nThe Conjuring\n\nThe most notable horror franchise of the \u201810s (if you include massive spin-offs like Annabelle and The Nun) started here with the story of Ed and Lorraine Warren and a very haunted house. James Wan\u2019s brilliant use of space and a great ensemble would really change the horror genre in ways reflected all across movies today.\n\nCoraline\n\nWe don\u2019t deserve Laika. The company behind Kubo and the Two Strings and ParaNorman has never made a bad movie, but this is the only one on Netflix as of right now, a beautifully refined adaptation of a Neil Gaiman book. Lyrical, scary, and unforgettable, this is stop-motion animation for the whole family.\n\nCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\n\nAng Lee\u2019s martial arts epic was an absolute phenomenon when it came out, domestically grossing more than any foreign language film in history on its way to ten Academy Award nominations. It\u2019s held up marvelously, a cinematic explosion of color and passion for filmmaking. If you haven\u2019t seen it since it took the world by storm, it\u2019s time for a rewatch.\n\nThe Dark Crystal\n\nAn entire generation was scarred by this 1982 Jim Henson and Frank Oz vision, a world that is being revived for a Netflix series on August 30th, 2019. If you haven\u2019t seen The Dark Crystal since it scarred you as a child, it\u2019s time to revisit the land of Gelflings and Skeksis. In an era in which it feels like so much filmmaking aimed at children is safe and produced for mass enjoyment, this kind of creative, fascinating family entertainment feels even rarer than ever. It\u2019s daring in terms of its visuals and pure in its storytelling. It\u2019s not just a great family movie. It\u2019s a great movie, period.\n\nEx Machina\n\nAlex Garland\u2019s sci-fi masterpiece already feels like a classic. Alicia Vikander, Domhnall Gleeson, and Oscar Isaac star in an examination of the future of artificial intelligence, what it means to be a human being, and how often men seek to control that which they create. It\u2019s a movie that gets better every time you see it.\n\nThe Fighter\n\nDavid O. Russell\u2019s dramatization of the true story of boxer Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) won Oscars for both of its supporting players \u2014 Melissa Leo and a transformed Christian Bale. It\u2019s got some beats that already make it feel older than just 2010 but the great cast holds it together.\n\nFour Weddings and a Funeral\n\nRemember when romantic comedies weren\u2019t basically the exclusive territory of Netflix Original movies? It\u2019s hard to believe now, but Mike Newell\u2019s Four Weddings and a Funeral was a legitimate phenomenon, grossing more than any U.K.-produced film in history at the time of its release and earning an Oscar nomination for Best Picture! Why was it such a hit? A lot of the success of great rom-coms comes down to casting, and Newell got Hugh Grant and Andie MacDowell at their most absolutely charming.\n\nFrances Ha\n\nBefore there was Lady Bird, there was Frances Ha, another semi-autobiographical comedy starring and co-written by Greta Gerwig. The delightful actress plays a woman dealing with a quarter-life crisis in NYC in one of Noah Baumbach\u2019s best films.\n\nGangs of New York\n\nThere\u2019s an incredible number of films by Martin Scorsese on Netflix in a move designed to get you even more excited for this Fall\u2019s The Irishman. This is one of the director\u2019s more underrated modern movies, especially surprising given it\u2019s also one of his biggest hits at the box office. Over the years people have dismissed this period action-drama, but it features a stunning performance from Daniel Day-Lewis and incredible design detail.\n\nGerald\u2019s Game\n\nThe Vulture choice for the Best Netflix Original Horror Movie has to be on this list too, right? Especially viewed in the wake of the phenomenon that was The Haunting of Hill House, this movie really works. It\u2019s one of the best Stephen King adaptations on any platform, anchored by a phenomenal Carla Gugino performance.\n\nGood Night, and Good Luck\n\nLong before we had to deal with the concept of Fake News and attacks on journalists, George Clooney directed what is basically a tribute to one of the news industry\u2019s most important figures: Edward R. Murrow. Clooney\u2019s best directorial work earned him an Oscar nomination, along with a nod for star David Straithairn, a great performer never better than he is here as a man caught up in Joseph McCarthy\u2019s Red Scare and a changing industry.\n\nThe Graduate\n\nCertain films transcend mere celluloid to become cultural benchmarks and Mike Nichols\u2019s beloved 1967 sophomore outing is certainly one such film. It hasn\u2019t held up as well as some of the works of its era, but few films are still as influential today as the story of a college graduate lost in life and love. You need to see it just so you can pick out its fingerprints on the half-century of comedies that followed.\n\nGroundhog Day\n\nRelive one of the best comedies of all time over and over again on Netflix. Believe it or not, this 1993 Bill Murray vehicle wasn\u2019t rapturously received either critically or commercially when it came out, but it has become a beloved genre classic. Murray stars as a weatherman forced to repeat the same day over and over again until he gets it right. It\u2019s not just the clever premise but how much Murray and director and co-writer Harold Ramis inject humanism and truth into it. And it holds up so much better than most early-\u201990s comedies.\n\nThe Hateful Eight\n\nDebate among yourselves if this should be on the movie or TV list, but it\u2019s still basically the same venture that was released in theaters, only slightly reedited by Quentin Tarantino into episodes, so we say it\u2019s a movie. And it\u2019s an underrated one, overshadowed by the way it deals with race and gender when it was released. Just a few years later, it looks almost prescient about how divided the country would become, and it contains some of the best performances in Q.T.\u2019s entire filmography.\n\nHeathers\n\nIt may look quainter today than it did in the late \u201880s, but Michael Lehmann\u2019s dark comedy felt revolutionary 30 years ago. Winona Ryder stars as a student at a school full of awful people who use their social status to bully those beneath them. Christian Slater does his best Jack Nicholson impression as the loner who teaches her how to kill them.\n\nHellboy\n\nThis 2004 Guillermo del Toro action classic stars Ron Perlman, John Hurt, Selma Blair, and Rupert Evans. Before GdT was winning Oscars and rocking Twitter, he brought Mike Mignola\u2019s most famous comic character to the screen and lost none of his irascible charm along the way.\n\nHer\n\nSpike Jonze\u2019s Oscar winner stars Joaquin Phoenix as a writer who falls in love with a daring new A.I., voiced by Scarlett Johansson. This is not only one of the best films on Netflix, but one of the best films of the \u201810s. Just see it.\n\nHigh Flying Bird\n\nSteven Soderbergh very rarely makes bad movies and he\u2019s not about to start with Andre Holland and Zazie Beetz in his court. The two star in the first excellent Netflix movie of 2019, an analysis of the game on top of the game that makes the NBA work. The man who almost directed Moneyball crafts a razor-sharp, incredibly entertaining, and humane basketball/corporate-media/labor drama that will appeal to hoops fanatics and the sports-averse alike. And the entire thing was shot on an iPhone!\n\nHowards End\n\nYoung film lovers may not know why Sir Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson are so beloved in the film community. This is a good place to start. Both are at the top of their game (Thompson won an Oscar, as did Ruth Prawer Jhabvala for her screenplay) in this gorgeous Merchant/Ivory adaptation of the E.M. Forster classic.\n\nIncredibles 2\n\nWhile Disney works to get its upcoming streaming service off the ground, it\u2019s still regularly releasing new hits to Netflix, including the beloved sequel to one of the most popular Pixar films of all time. Brad Bird\u2019s long-awaited sequel is one of the top films of 2018, and arguably its best animated film (at least that\u2019s not about Spider-man).\n\nIndiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of Steven Spielberg on Netflix, but this is one of the best choices you could make from the filmography of one the best American filmmakers. Maybe you\u2019ve heard of it? All four Indy films are actually still on Netflix. Do a marathon while you still can. Yes, you can skip the last one if you want.\n\nThe Informant!\n\nMatt Damon stars in Steven Soderbergh\u2019s telling of the true story of Mark Whitacre, a relatively mediocre employee who ended up being a spy for the FBI when his company started illegally price-fixing. It\u2019s a quirky, odd, unforgettable movie with one of Damon\u2019s best performances.\n\nInglourious Basterds\n\nQuentin Tarantino\u2019s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is currently dividing Film Twitter and making a fortune at the box office on the back of rave reviews. So naturally someone at Netflix realized this might be a good time to add a few QT films to the catalogue. As of this writing, you can check out one that\u2019s widely considered to be among his best: the Oscar-winning Inglourious Basterds. If you somehow haven\u2019t seen it, you really should before seeing Once, as it does a lot of the same melding of history and Tarantino\u2019s vision.\n\nJackie Brown\n\nOne of Quentin Tarantino\u2019s best movies \u2014 and a film whose melancholic tone is deeply reflected in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood \u2014 is this adaptation of the Elmore Leonard book. The only time Tarantino explicitly worked from someone else\u2019s material resulted in a film that beautifully blends his and Leonard\u2019s voices. It\u2019s anchored by great performances from Pam Grier, Robert Forster, Robert De Niro, Bridget Fonda, and Samuel L. Jackson.\n\nLayer Cake\n\nIf you like Daniel Craig as James Bond, you owe it to yourself to check out this Matthew Vaughn 2004 crime/action flick that helped get him the part. The director who would go on to make his own superspy franchise in The Kingman directed the future 007 in a wildly entertaining movie about very bad people that co-stars Tom Hardy, Colm Meaney, and Sienna Miller. It\u2019s stylish, gritty fun.\n\nLincoln\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that Netflix plays to Spielberg fans, but it\u2019s nice to see that it includes more than the crowd-pleasing blockbusters, also occasionally diving a bit deeper and adding his historical dramas. This is one of his best from that category, featuring an Oscar-winning performance from Daniel Day-Lewis.\n\nLittle Women\n\nThere have been a dozen or so versions of the Louisa May Alcott classic novel that you probably read in high school, but this 1994 adaptation is easily one of the best, starring Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, Kirsten Dunst, and Susan Sarandon. Ignore the others, just watch this one.\n\nThe Lives of Others\n\nFlorian Henckel von Donnersmarck\u2019s 2006 film may have been released 16 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, but it was actually one of the first films from Germany to really deal with that subject matter. It\u2019s a detailed, fascinating look at the monitoring of East Berlin residents by the secret police. The winner of the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, it\u2019s a complex, challenging look at how spying on your neighbors changes a society, and it may be about Germany in the \u201880s but feels relevant to governments around the world today.\n\n*Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\n\nGuy Ritchie\u2019s breakthrough is over two decades old now, making it the perfect time to look back on one of the biggest indie hits of its era. With its tough-talking characters, clever plotting, and charismatic ensemble (this is the movie that gave us Vinnie Jones and Jason Statham), some people wrote off Lock as a Tarantino riff but it\u2019s interesting now to consider how many films were influenced by this one too.\n\n*Locke\n\nSteven Knight wrote and directed this 2013 drama that contains one of Tom Hardy\u2019s career-best performances. It\u2019s an actor\u2019s showcase in that it contains no one else on-screen other than Hardy, who plays the title character, someone juggling various issues in his life as he drives through the night to reach his in-labor girlfriend. Hardy is charismatic and brilliant, proving he\u2019s one of the few actors of his generation who could carry a one-man show like this.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings Trilogy\n\nIt\u2019s kind of amazing that what was once one of the biggest theatrical events of all time can now be watched on your phone. The original, Oscar-winning trilogy \u2013 The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, Return of the King \u2013 have all dropped on Netflix, and it\u2019s time for you revisit the Shire. These films have held up beautifully, still a great example of how movie magic can transport to fantasy worlds. If you haven\u2019t seen them since they ruled the cinematic ring, it\u2019s time to rejoin the fellowship.\n\nMean Streets\n\nAs Netflix subscribers get pumped up for the fall arrival of Martin Scorsese\u2019s The Irishman, it only makes sense that the streaming service would help build anticipation by making more of the master filmmaker\u2019s work available. This is his breakthrough film and remains one of his unqualified masterpieces, a stunning look at masculinity and friendship that also happens to contain one of the best performances of Harvey Keitel\u2019s career. The hardest thing to believe is that it\u2019s almost 50 years old.\n\nThe Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)\n\nNoah Baumbach\u2019s latest didn\u2019t premiere in theaters, going the Netflix route in 2017. Adam Sandler does arguably the best work of his career in this drama about how family can both connect and divide us, sometimes in the same moment. Sandler is joined by Ben Stiller, Dustin Hoffman, and Emma Thompson in this must-see dramedy. Forget the Sandler Netflix Originals \u2014 watch this one instead.\n\nMilk\n\nSean Penn\u2019s last Oscar came for his portrayal of Harvey Milk, the slain activist for gay rights and California\u2019s first openly gay elected official. It\u2019s a movie that has lost none of its dramatic power a decade after its release.\n\nMiracle\n\nThere are so few great sports movies that audiences really embrace the ones that do come along like this underrated 2004 film from Gavin O\u2019Connor. Kurt Russell gives a truly fantastic performance as Herb Brooks, the coach of the U.S. Men\u2019s Hockey team that made everyone believe in miracles when they defeated their heavily favored Russian counterparts.\n\nMonty Python and the Holy Grail\n\nMovies don\u2019t get much funnier than the best offering from the Monty Python troupe, a comedy that spawned a quoting fandom that still roams the hills saying, \u201cNot dead yet,\u201d and, \u201cI fart in your general direction.\u201d It\u2019s possible there\u2019s a young generation yet to appreciate the comedic brilliance of the men of Monty Python. Start here and then move on to the sketches and other movies, some of which are also on Netflix.\n\nMoonlight\n\nBarry Jenkins\u2019 2016 drama might be the most shocking Best Picture winner of all time, and not just for the way it went down on Oscar night. Envelope-gate somewhat overshadowed how crazy it is that such a small, gentle, personal film won the biggest prize in movies. If you have somehow never seen it, correct that oversight now. And, if you have, watch it again. It\u2019s a movie that grows richer with each viewing.\n\nA Most Violent Year\n\nOne of the most underrated flicks of the \u201810s, J.C. Chandor\u2019s period crime drama stars Oscar Isaac, Jessica Chastain, and David Oyelowo. Awash in the dread surrounding the most violent year in New York history, this is a crime epic for viewers who like characters more than action in their sagas of men who work both sides of the law.\n\nMudbound\n\nArguably Netflix\u2019s first masterpiece, Dee Rees\u2019s period drama is an epic portrait of racism, trauma, and injustice in the post-WWII South. You won\u2019t find a better ensemble in a Netflix Original, anchored by Jason Mitchell, Carey Mulligan, Garrett Hedlund, Jason Clarke, and the amazing Dee Rees.\n\nMystic River\n\nDennis Lehane\u2019s novel gets an incredible adaptation in this 2003 Oscar winner starring Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon, directed by Clint Eastwood. It\u2019s a fascinating ensemble piece about how past trauma and resentment resurfaces in a group of friends after one of their daughters is murdered. Both Penn and Robbins won well-deserved Oscar for their work here.\n\nObvious Child\n\nIf you\u2019re not a fan of Jenny Slate, you probably have yet to see how charming and relatable she is in this Sundance comedy hit. She plays a stand-up comedian whose life is rattled by an unplanned pregnancy. It\u2019s a great comedy \u2014 funny, empathetic, and daring.\n\nOkja\n\nGod bless Bong Joon-ho. The director of The Host, The Mother, and Snowpiercer \u2014 all of which you owe it to yourself to see \u2014 brought arguably his weirdest movie yet to Netflix in this sci-fi dramedy about a giant pig. Say what you will about the film\u2019s flights of fancy \u2014 or Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s truly committed performance \u2014 there ain\u2019t nothing else like it on Netflix.\n\nThe Other Side of the Wind\n\nIt took almost a half-century to complete Orson Welles\u2019s final film, this meta work that blends documentary style, fictional filmmaking, and even the reputation and life of its own creator into something that feels defiantly new \u2014 even though most of it was shot before you were born. It took the efforts of dozens over decades to get this out. You can spare two hours to see what all the work was for.\n\nPanic Room\n\nDavid Fincher followed his cult hit Fight Club with a movie that still doesn\u2019t get enough attention in his filmography, this 2002 thriller starring Jodie Foster and a young Kristen Stewart. Not only is this a tight, well-crafted flick, it\u2019s also unavailable on Blu-ray \u2014 so streaming is the only way to watch it in HD right now.\n\nPersonal Shopper\n\nOlivier Assayas\u2019s ghost story is not your typical tale of the supernatural. The French filmmaker, working in perfect conjunction with star Kristen Stewart, who has never been better, crafts a film about loss, fear, and longing. It\u2019s not an easy film to dissect or understand, but you won\u2019t forget it.\n\nPhiladelphia\n\nTom Hanks may be America\u2019s Favorite Dad now, but there was a time when it was difficult to see the star of things like Bosom Buddies and Big transitioning into being one of the most acclaimed actors of all time. This was the film that truly began to realize that potential. Before Forrest Gump and Saving Private Ryan, Hanks starred in Jonathan Demme\u2019s true story of a lawyer fired because of his HIV diagnosis, and the system-changing lawsuit that followed.\n\n*The Place Beyond the Pines\n\nDerek Cianfrance\u2019s 2013 crime drama divided audiences when it was released but it\u2019s definitely worth a reappreciation now. Anchored by a great ensemble, including Ryan Gosling, Ben Mendelsohn, Mahershala Ali, and Bradley Cooper, this is a story of the ripple effect of criminal behavior, and how it can impact across the generations. It\u2019s smarter and better in every way than it got credit for when it was released.\n\nPrivate Life\n\nTamara Jenkins returned to filmmaking for the first time since The Savages with this personal portrait of the struggle faced by people going through fertility procedures. With an amazingly truthful performance by Kathryn Hahn, this is the kind of film that feels both delicately specific and universal to the struggle of so many couples.\n\nPulp Fiction\n\nThere are certain tentpoles of American film history that changed the form forever, and this is undeniably one. Heck, we\u2019re still getting Tarantino riffs over 20 years later, as everyone wants to make a movie as effortlessly cool as his masterpiece.\n\nRachel Getting Married\n\nJonathan Demme\u2019s character drama contains arguably Anne Hathaway\u2019s best performance as Kym, a recovering alcoholic dealing with trauma over the course of her sister Rachel\u2019s wedding weekend. This is a beautiful film, full of both joy and regret, and anchored by Demme\u2019s deep humanism and skill with performers. It\u2019s one of the best films of the \u201800s.\n\n*Raging Bull\n\nOne of the best films of all time, Martin Scorsese\u2019s drama won Robert De Niro his second Oscar (and should have won Scorsese his first Oscar as well as Best Picture) for playing Jake LaMotta, a famous boxer in the \u201840s whose life unraveled in the \u201850s in large part due to his rage, jealousy, and violent behavior. It\u2019s a riveting character study that has lost none of its power in the nearly 40 years since its release.\n\nRain Man\n\nBarry Levinson directs Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman in the story of a man who learns after the death of his father that he has a brother who is an autistic savant. Both gentlemen are fantastic in a movie that\u2019s arguably a little manipulative, but that should be watched or rewatched purely for the strength of its performances. The movie won four Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Hoffman.\n\nRocky\n\nTake this as one entry for an entire franchise: Netflix is making available not just the Oscar-winning first film but the entire Rocky series (minus the Creed movies, if you think those count). Given that Sylvester Stallone is actually talking about returning to one of film\u2019s most iconic characters for yet another sequel, it\u2019s time to remember why the story of America\u2019s favorite underdog boxer has resonated for over four decades.\n\nRoma\n\nAlfonso Cuaron\u2019s deeply personal story of the domestic worker who really helped raise him is Netflix\u2019s first nominee for Best Picture and a movie that has really altered the way the streaming service will be seen on the film landscape. It\u2019s also a masterpiece, a heartbreaking, mesmerizing piece of filmmaking that really operates on Roger Ebert\u2019s belief that great cinema is an \u201cempathy machine,\u201d a way to experience lives that you otherwise never would.\n\nSchindler\u2019s List\n\nMore Spielberg! Arguably his best historical drama, this Best Picture winner stars Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler, a man who saved numerous Jewish lives during World War II. Everyone here is working at the top of their game, including Spielberg, Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes. It\u2019s the kind of movie you see once and never forget.\n\nScott Pilgrim vs. the World\n\nSure, we all know how much fun Edgar Wright\u2019s adaptation of Bryan Lee O\u2019Malley\u2019s graphic novels is, but has anyone else noticed how many careers this movie helped launch? It\u2019s amazing to watch it nearly a decade after it was released and consider how much people like Anna Kendrick, Alison Pill, Aubrey Plaza, Chris Evans, Brie Larson, Mae Whitman, and Jason Schwartzman have done since then.\n\nA Serious Man\n\nMore Coen brothers! When Netflix added Buster Scruggs, they dropped a few earlier films as well, including this underrated comedy about a man dealing with the inequity of life after his wife leaves him. With a great performance by Michael Stuhlbarg, this one has some of the Coens\u2019 best darkly comic bits in the back half of their career.\n\nShe\u2019s Gotta Have It\n\nSpike Lee had \u201cit\u201d from the beginning, as you can see in his 1986 debut comedy, recently loosely adapted into a Netflix Original series. It\u2019s incredible to see how much of Lee\u2019s voice as a filmmaker was already there in this passionate, daring independent flick that really announced one of American cinema\u2019s most important filmmakers.\n\nShirkers\n\nDocumentaries that aren\u2019t about serial killers can be a tough sell to a Netflix audience, but just trust us on this one. Sandi Tan\u2019s story of a film she made with some friends in Singapore back in the \u201890s seems at first like just another document of creative young people but becomes something much more complicated as it comments on ownership, toxic masculinity, and the need for closure.\n\nShort Term 12\n\nDestin Daniel Cretton\u2019s 2013 drama was a great piece of filmmaking when it was released but has become something even more special over the years. We\u2019ve watched its incredible young cast develop into some of the best actors working today: Two of them (Brie Larson and Rami Malek) already have Oscars, and it wouldn\u2019t be too hard to envision Kaitlyn Dever and Lakeith Stanfield joining them one day. Check out this early gem in all their careers, a story of empathy at a group home for troubled teens.\n\n*Sin City\n\nFrank Miller, Robert Rodriguez, and Quentin Tarantino adapted this stylish version of Miller\u2019s beloved graphic novel about violent men and femme fatales. The star power here is one draw (including Bruce Willis, Clive Owen, Mickey Rourke, Benicio del Toro, and Elijah Wood), but the best reason to watch this is that there\u2019s never been anything else quite like it.\n\nThe Sixth Sense\n\nIt\u2019s funny to hear people use Jordan Peele\u2019s career as evidence that people are taking horror more seriously than ever. With no offense to Peele, horror has had critically adored genre entries before, including The Exorcist, The Silence of the Lambs and this multiple Oscar nominee, one of the most popular films of 1999. The movie that made \u201cShyamalan-esque\u201d a thing, The Sixth Sense is still the filmmaker\u2019s best, a powerful piece of work about grief and loss that works well beyond the twist ending that would come to define it culturally.\n\nSnowpiercer\n\nBong Joon-ho is about to have a major cultural moment with the release of his Palme d\u2019Or-winning Parasite. Why not go back and check out what is arguably his most popular movie to date, this 2013 adaptation of a groundbreaking French graphic novel? The concept is wonderfully simple \u2014 an always-moving train is divided into class with the 1% at the front and the poorest people in the back. Those in the caboose, including Chris Evans and Song Kang-ho, plan to move up a few train cars. It\u2019s smart, action-packed, memorable sci-fi action, and it\u2019s the kind that also has something to say.\n\nThe Spectacular Now\n\nJames Ponsoldt\u2019s 2013 adaptation of Tim Tharp\u2019s 2008 novel was one of the biggest hits to come out of that year\u2019s Sundance Film Festival, and helped launch the careers of Miles Teller, Shailene Woodley, and Brie Larson. On paper, it\u2019s another romantic dramedy about two very different teenagers who find themselves falling in love, but Ponsoldt and his cast imbue the film with a truth that\u2019s so often missing from this genre. It\u2019s a legitimately great movie. A bit of trivia: this film was the last one reviewed by Roger Ebert, who gave it four stars.\n\nSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\n\nThe Best Animated Film Oscar for 2018 went to this unexpected treat, one of the best superhero movies of the modern era. It\u2019s got a little bit of everything. First, it replicates the comic-book aesthetic in ways we\u2019ve never seen before. Second, it is a leap forward in terms of representation in superhero movies. Third, it is just an unbelievable amount of fun, the kind of movie that you can watch again and again. It will hold up for generations to come.\n\nSpring Breakers\n\nHarmony Korine\u2019s 2013 dark comedy is one of the most divisive movies of the \u201810s. Some people just see excess, but there\u2019s more to this movie than the many GIFs that sprung from it may lead you to believe. Not only is it a mesmerizing blend of music video composition and cautionary drama, but it contains arguably the best performance of James Franco\u2019s career. Spriiiinnnnnng breaaaakkkkkkk!\n\n*The Squid and the Whale\n\nNoah Baumbach\u2019s personal 2005 drama dissects the impact of divorce on an average family and offers the suggestion that the flaws of parents will only be amplified in their children. Jeff Daniels, Laura Linney, and Jesse Eisenberg all give excellent performances in a film that feels both specifically revealing and universal in its themes.\n\nStar Wars: The Last Jedi\n\nBefore Disney+ runs off with all of the MCU and Lucasfilm movies that they can grab, you should take the chance to watch the few that are just sitting there on Netflix waiting for you to enjoy them. One of the most divisive films of the \u201810s, The Last Jedi spawned an entire industry of online hatred and petitions, but it\u2019s a movie that you should A) See for yourself and B) Revisit away from all the hype. You may be surprised.\n\nStripes\n\nWe still miss John Candy. His co-starring work here is only one of the great things about this near-perfect comedy, a flick that caught Candy, Bill Murray, and Harold Ramis at their charismatic peaks. Murray is at his sad sack best as a man who gets knocked down by life and decides to join the Army. Comedy hijinks ensue. A lot of comedies from the early \u201880s have not aged well. This one has.\n\nSuperbad\n\nGreg Mottola\u2019s 2007 comedy became so beloved for a generation that it\u2019s already a reference point (look at how many people called Booksmart a female version of this). Written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, Superbad turned Michael Cera and Jonah Hill into stars overnight, and introduced the world to future Oscar-winner Emma Stone. Some of its gender issues already seem a little dated, but there\u2019s an innocent charm to the film that holds up. And it\u2019s just damn funny.\n\nTaxi Driver\n\nBy the time The Irishman debuts, expect there to be a dozen or so movies on the service by Martin Scorsese, one of the best directors of all time. This is one of his early masterpieces, a wildly influential story of a man pushed off the edge of sanity, featuring a fearless performance from a young Robert De Niro. Few movies from this era are cited more than this one, and it\u2019s not just because it touches on themes that remain timeless, but that it does so in such a riveting, harrowing way.\n\n*Trainspotting\n\nDanny Boyle really broke through with his second film, this beloved adaptation of Irvine Welsh\u2019s novel about addiction. Ewan McGregor plays Mark Renton, the most charismatic member of a group of friends who became instantly iconic, including Spud (Ewan Bremner), Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), Tommy (Kevin McKidd), and the sociopathic Begbie (Robert Carlyle). Propelled by one of the best soundtracks of the \u201890s, this movie has more energy than nearly anything else on Netflix.\n\n*Troy\n\nWolfgang Petersen rode his fame as an action director to make a massive, big-budget version of Homer\u2019s Iliad, and it ended up being one of the highest grossing films of 2004. Brad Pitt, Eric Bana, and Orlando Bloom lead a massively talented ensemble in an old-fashioned epic film that recalls the era of Ben-Hur and The Ten Commandments. It\u2019s better than you remember, a great example of action-adventure filmmaking.\n\nUnder the Skin\n\nA trippy, sci-fi masterpiece, this flick stars Scarlett Johansson as an alien being exploring the world around her and, well, doing some terrifying things to the men she comes into contact with. Although that only scratches the surface of why this is a special movie, a terrifying tone piece that has more in common with Twin Peaks than Species. It\u2019s unforgettable and brilliant.\n\n*Winter\u2019s Bone\n\nJennifer Lawrence\u2019s breakthrough role came in this resonant drama from writer/director Debra Granik about a teenager in the Ozarks forced to deal with the seedy, underground world of meth dealers in this poor part of the country. Lawrence is so believable that she earned an Oscar nomination alongside nods for John Hawkes, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Picture.\n\nThe Witch\n\nRobert Eggers\u2019s Sundance hit is a master class in sound design and limited perspective. Using testimony from the Salem witch trials, the concept of Eggers\u2019s script is beautifully simple \u2014 what if one of those trials was about a legitimate witch? The sound of branches hitting each other from the wind, the sound of footsteps on the leafy ground \u2014 this is a movie that understands that horror is often sensory more than purely conveyed through storytelling. It\u2019s a modern genre masterpiece.\n\nY Tu Mama Tambi\u00e9n\n\nLikely added to accompany Roma, this is a great piece of work to watch after that one as it\u2019s another obviously personal film from Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n. Two teenage boys \u2014 Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal and Diego Luna \u2014 fall for an older woman who has a secret. It\u2019s a sweet, moving film from a modern master.", "description": "The best movies on Netflix include Pulp Fiction, Raging Bull, Black Panther, Roma, and many more.
