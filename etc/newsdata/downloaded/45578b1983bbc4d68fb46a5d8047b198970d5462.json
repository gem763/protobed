Of course, clearing one hurdle for a market seemingly beset by them doesn\u2019t mean investors should get too giddy.\n\nWhile the S&P 500\u2019s SPX, +1.42% Friday rally brings it back within 2.5% of a July 26 record, a report that China isn\u2019t keen on a broad-scale trade deal when it meets with the U.S. later this week has triggered early losses for stock-index futures.\n\nOur call of the day is focused elsewhere \u2014 on the fate of the dollar. Enter Jim Rogers, the chairman of Rogers Holdings, who says dollar fundamentals are \u201chorrible,\u201d but he\u2019s buying it to prepare for the currency\u2019s last-gasp rally.\n\n\u201cPeople would think the U.S. dollar is a safe haven, it\u2019s not. The fundamentals are horrible. Nobody in his right mind would buy the U.S. dollar, but I own a lot\u2026because I\u2019m not in my right mind. I\u2019m assuming that the rest of the world is not in its mind either and they\u2019re all going to buy it,\u201d Rogers told Real Vision in a recent interview.\n\nHe predicts the dollar will eventually get overpriced and turn into a bubble, and then the veteran investor, who founded the Quantum Fund with billionaire George Soros in the 1970s, will sell. \u201cI\u2019m not very good at market timing but I would expect it to be in the next period of turmoil, which will be coming in the next two or three years,\u201d he said.\n\nThe dollar headwinds are numerous he says, given such factors as the U.S. is \u201cthe biggest debtor nation in the history of the world,\u201d and countries such as China, Russia and Brazil are hard at work to find an alternate international currency.\n\nRogers says he\u2019ll switch to the Chinese renminbi and/or gold when he senses it\u2019s over for the dollar. But he doesn\u2019t own any U.S. stocks, and is only really interested in Russian equities. That is as he\u2019s still predicting the \u201cworst bear market in my lifetime.\u201d\n\nThe market\n\nDow YM00, -0.22%, S&P ES00, -0.25% and Nasdaq NQ00, -0.27% futures are down on trade worries.

On the Federal Reserve front, Kansas City President Esther George said she was not so sure about more interest-rate cuts, while Chairman Jerome Powell is slated to offer brief remarks at 1 p.m. Eastern at an event in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nThe tweet\n\n1/ I did not intend my tweet to cause any offense to Rockets fans and friends of mine in China. I was merely voicing one thought, based on one interpretation, of one complicated event. I have had a lot of opportunity since that tweet to hear and consider other perspectives. \u2014 Daryl Morey (@dmorey) October 7, 2019\n\nHouston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey, triggered chaos over a now-deleted tweet he sent that appeared to show support for Hong Kong protests.
