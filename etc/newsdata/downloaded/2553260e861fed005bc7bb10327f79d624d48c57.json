He was the only nominee for the post and critics said there should have a varied field of candidates. Geshev has not commented publicly.\n\nBulgaria ranked 111th out of 180 countries in the Reporters Without Borders world press freedom index this year - even below countries in the Western Balkans that are not yet EU members.
