But a few changes can help lift the burden\n\nHuman beings are not built to endure prolonged periods of stress. If you want to see an extreme example of what it can do to a person, observe prime ministers as they enter and exit Downing Street. Before, fresh-faced, they simper for the cameras. Afterwards, they are gaunt, grey and lined. It is like watching an accelerated version of ageing, and a reminder of how stress corrodes the human body.\n\nWe live in stressful times, though. More people are scratching a living in the gig economy, without paid leave or long-term job security. Austerity has ripped through communities like bullets through plasterboard, destroying the mental health of those forced into dehumanising encounters with the machinery of the welfare state. The Amazon is burning, a no-deal Brexit is looming and we are hurtling headfirst towards climate catastrophe. It is no wonder that our mental health services are in crisis, more young people are seeking help for anxiety and schoolchildren are being taught mindfulness to cope with the stresses of social media. According to a 2018 study, 75% of Britons experienced such profound stress in the previous year that they felt unable to cope.\n\nThe fact is, stress kills. Prolonged stress has been linked to heart disease, depression and diabetes. But how can you stay healthy when you are stressed? We asked some experts.\n\nEat well\n\nThe salty-sweet smack of snack foods is often the only thing that gets many of us through stressful times. But the crisps you inhale as a deadline looms will make you feel rotten in the long term.\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re overwhelmed, it\u2019s easy to reach for a quick fix in the form of sugar-rich food and drink,\u201d says Azmina Govindji, a registered dietitian and a member of the British Dietetic Association. \u201cThis gives you an instant spike in serotonin, the body\u2019s feelgood chemical, but it won\u2019t last \u2013 and neither will the fast rise in your blood glucose levels, which also gives you a temporary high.\u201d Instead, opt for complex carbohydrates such as porridge or wholegrain bread, which will give you the energy you need to face a difficult day.\n\nTaking 10 minutes to eat lunch away from your desk will reduce stress levels and prevent unhealthy snacking. \u201cEat mindfully,\u201d Govindji urges. \u201cGet away from your desk, chew your food slowly and savour the flavours.\u201d\n\nAccording to research from the American Psychological Association, a third of Americans reach for high-fat, high-calorie foods when stressed. \u201cTo avoid this, plan your meals to give you structure and control.\u201d It is unrealistic to expect people to meal-prep during periods of high stress, but a very easy meal plan of porridge and berries for breakfast, a wholegrain sandwich for lunch and vegetable pasta or fish with potatoes and broccoli for dinner is achievable and healthy.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Porridge and berries can help set you up for a long day.

We hammer the gym hard before a holiday, but when life gets in the way, our fitness goes out of the window. However, exercise is a powerful natural stress-reliever that will flood your body with feelgood endorphins.\n\nTo motivate yourself, the personal trainer Maiken Skoie Brustad advises you to \u201cremember how good you feel after you train. After exercise, you\u2019ll always feel better.\u201d\n\nIf you can\u2019t afford to visit a gym, or have responsibilities that keep you at home, there are plenty of free home-based workouts that can be squeezed into a few minutes. \u201cWrite down a cardio circuit of five exercises \u2013 three high-intensity exercises, such as running on the spot or squat jumps, and then two ab exercises such as planks or crunches \u2013 stick a timer on for 45 seconds and do each exercise for two rounds.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t feel guilty about taking time out to exercise. \u201cYou have to be strict with yourself,\u201d Brustad says. \u201cSay: \u2018OK, on Tuesday I will clear an hour out of my schedule,\u2019 and train no matter what. When you\u2019re training, focus on why you\u2019re there. It shouldn\u2019t be a treat to give yourself time to train. It should be a necessary thing for healthy human beings.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to seek professional help\n\nIt is not normal to exist in a state of perpetual stress. If you feel you are approaching burnout, your first port of call should be your GP. \u201cWe all have stress in our lives,\u201d says Dr Zoe Norris, a GP, \u201cbut the definition of anxiety as a disease is different from stress.\u201d If patients come to her complaining of stress, she will ask them whether they have been having palpitations, panic attacks or long-term sleep disturbances. These could all indicatebe indicators that they were struggling with an anxiety disorder.\n\nEven if your stress does not meet the clinical threshold for an anxiety disorder, it is a good idea to be mindful of your stress levels. \u201cAlmost every part of the body is affected by experiencing constant stress,\u201d Norris warns. \u201cWe are not designed for it as humans.\u201d\n\nDevelop coping mechanisms. \u201cPut into place protective factors to reduce the impact stress is having on you,\u201d Norris says. Exercise, reading or socialising with friends are all levellers. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have these coping mechanisms, what happens is that you develop bad coping mechanisms, such as drinking coffee to stay awake, then wine to help you sleep.\u201d\n\nSome stress is unavoidable: a relative dying, for instance. But if your stress is work-related, Norris encourages her patients to speak to their boss. \u201cIf their employers aren\u2019t accommodating, they may come to the conclusion they need to find somewhere else to work.\u201d\n\nStress is a trigger for self-destructive behaviour, such as smoking or drinking too much. \u201cLots of patients are keen on detoxes or Dry January, but sustained lifestyle changes are better in the long term.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Exercise will flood your body with feelgood endorphins.

But staying up late in order to tackle a growing to-do list is counterproductive. \u201cIf you are suffering from poor sleep, that will make your stress levels higher,\u201d says Dr Guy Leschziner, a neurologist and the author of The Nocturnal Brain. \u201cGetting as much sleep as possible when you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed will help to manage your stress.\u201d\n\nWhat about sleeping pills? \u201cThey\u2019re a double-edged sword,\u201d Leschziner says. He explains that they can be helpful as a short-term solution, when someone is under acute stress. \u201cIf your GP prescribes you a short course of sleeping tablets, for a maximum of two weeks, they can be helpful. People can get to a crunch point where they don\u2019t sleep at all and they can end up in a nervous breakdown situation.\u201d But you can\u2019t rely on pills as a long-term solution to stress. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get on a slippery slope. It\u2019s better to resolve your sleep issues by dealing with the underlying source of stress.\u201d Cognitive behavioural therapy can also help address your anxiety and improve the quality of your sleep.\n\nGet smart about how you cope\n\n\u201cIf you feel overwhelmed, it\u2019s usually a combination of work and home-life factors,\u201d says Andrew Kinder, an occupational psychologist and a member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.\n\nDevelop your support structures. \u201cLook at your relationships,\u201d says Kinder. \u201cWho are your potential allies? It may be family or friends. When people open up, they\u2019re often overwhelmed by how much support is available to them.\u201d\n\nProblem-solving approaches will mitigate extreme stress. If you are worried about debt, for example, tackle it head-on. \u201cGet out the brown envelopes, open them up, start talking with your creditor and negotiate. That will give you more hope than just sitting on it and knowing that it\u2019s festering in the background.\u201d\n\nRemember: your job does not define you\n\nWe live in a society that fetishises overwork, whether it is the side hustle you balance on top of your full-time job or the toxic culture of presenteeism that increasingly blights British offices. \u201cAsk yourself the question: what do you really care about?\u201d suggests Prof Josh Cohen, the author of Not Working: Why We Have to Stop.\n\nStrip your workload down to the essentials. \u201cExcessive workloads are one of the main sources of stress,\u201d Cohen says. Many things that we do in the workplace to endear ourselves to our bosses or appear more proactive than our colleagues are basically pointless. \u201cThere\u2019s so much that\u2019s just window dressing, where you\u2019re being seen to do something.\u201d Stop doing that and your stress levels may reduce.\n\nTo avoid burnout, remember you don\u2019t have to spend every hour in productive or fruitful labour. Sometimes, it is good to just do nothing at all. \u201cResist a permanent state of task orientation. There are other dimensions of life, and selfhood, that are worth believing in. Reducing yourself to the sum of what you do and identifying yourself so fully with your work won\u2019t do your work any good in the long term. You\u2019ll just end up resenting it.\u201d", "description": "Keeping on top of your mental health in today\u2019s taxing world can be tough.
