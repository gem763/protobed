The cause, Duke said, was a combination of extreme heat, a temporary drop in sea level at the time caused by atmospheric pressure, and drought.\n\nDuke and colleagues returned for a second follow-up monitoring trip to find devastating impacts of two cyclones had created a 400km stretch of dead and damaged mangroves.\n\nIn December 2018, Cyclone Owen battered the gulf\u2019s coast and then, just three month\u2019s later, the category 4 Cyclone Trevor struck just to the south of Owen\u2019s impact area.\n\nHow the gulf can sustain that I don\u2019t know Norman Duke\n\n\u201cWe are getting these compounding effects that we just didn\u2019t expect,\u201d Duke told Guardian Australia.\n\n\u201cThe mangroves hit in the 2015 dieback are already vulnerable because they are just recovering. Now you have all this dead wood that becomes like projectiles. It was a shock to me to see the damage.\u201d\n\nFor hundreds of kilometres, Duke says what would usually be a landscape of lush green mangroves has been replaced by struggling dull grey trees with stripped foliage.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aerial view of damaged mangroves from a 2019 monitoring trip in the Gulf of Carpentaria.

These are very successful trees and they usually form a solid green canopy that\u2019s very distinctive. Now we see canopy damage \u2013 a grey colour where it would normally be green.\u201d\n\nHe said new growth was being smothered and damaged by the dead branches stacked up behind them and the shoreline in many places was also in retreat, caused partly by rising sea levels which, he said, were rising faster than the global average.\n\n\u201cHow the gulf can sustain that I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said, referring to the impact of rising sea levels.\n\nDuke said it was \u201cabundantly clear\u201d that the estuaries that flow into the gulf had greater levels of erosion than he had previously seen.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest James Cook University scientists Jock Mackenzie (L) and Norman Duke during a 2019 monitoring trip to the Gulf of Carpentaria. Photograph: Norman Duke\n\n\u201cThere will almost certainly be impacts on fisheries and the ability of mangroves to protect the coasts from erosion,\u201d he said.\n\nInitial reports estimated the area damaged in 2015 to be about 1,000km in length, but Duke says subsequent visits put that number at more like 2,000km. About 8,000 hectares (20,000 acres) of mangroves had been affected.\n\nEarlier this week, a major study found that Australia was a global hotspot for carbon stored in mangroves, seagrasses and tidal marshes, but warned degradation of the ecosystems was already releasing about 3m tonnes of CO2 a year.\n\nAustralia\u2019s vast carbon sink releasing millions of tonnes of CO2 back into atmosphere Read more\n\nThe findings quantified for the first time the major role that \u201cvegetated coastal ecosystems\u201d play in absorbing and locking away carbon.\n\nDuke said he did not know if human-caused climate change was a factor in what he had seen, but he added: \u201cWhat would you expect with climate change, with more severe storms and higher temperatures? What does that look like?\n\n\u201cI believe this example in the gulf is a clear presentation, because this area is so remote. There are no other factors that we can attribute to it.\u201d\n\nDuke is leading a National Environmental Science Program project to study the after-effects of the vast 2015 mangrove dieback.\n\nHe said local traditional owner rangers he had been working with, and who supported the monitoring trips, needed support to continue their work.\n\nHe said rangers were doing vital work in patrolling the beaches, and also trying to look after turtle nesting sites that were being attacked by feral pigs.", "description": "Mangrove monitoring trip to remote coast finds shocking impact of two cyclones across hundreds of kilometres", "authors": ["Graham Readfearn"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eae21859eee7ca56debc19e710d0a07df0a980bd/0_59_4443_2666/master/4443.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5db071d892c59d5d863cbaeecba81908"}
