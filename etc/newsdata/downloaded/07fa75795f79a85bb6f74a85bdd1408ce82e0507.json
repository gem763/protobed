He saw a flawed system, and exploited it. Even though he wound up disgraced, his price hike was perfectly legal.\n\nI thought of Shkreli on Wednesday when I read a tweet by Senator Tom Cotton, a conservative Republican from Arkansas. The tweet was about WeWork, and the senator expressed fury at what its former CEO Adam Neumann had just gotten away with.\n\nHe saw a flawed system and his combination of greed, smarts and apparent remorselessness allowed him to exploit it.\n\nEven in the unlikely event that the WeWork story has a happy ending now that its primary investor, SoftBank has control of it, the company's spectacular implosion is going to linger for a very long time.\n\nBooks are going to be written, podcasts are going to be recorded, documentaries and TV series and feature films are going to be aired.\n\nAnd you can bet that Adam Neumann is going to be at the red-hot centre of it all. Here he is, an unknown entrepreneur, negotiating a deal in a limo with SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, that would give the company a $20 billion valuation!\n\nThere he is spending $80 million buying five homes (including one in San Francisco with a guitar-shaped room)!\n\nHe's borrowing tens of millions of dollars from a credit facility led by JPMorgan Chase & Co. against his WeWork shares. He's selling millions of dollars of shares when WeWork raises money from private investors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe's buying commercial buildings and then leasing office space to WeWork. He trademarks the word \"We\" and then tries to sell it to his own company for $5.9 million. (That deal doesn't fly.)\n\nAnd finally, of course, once the company has been decimated, he sells his stock to a now-desperate SoftBank for $1 billion as a condition of his leaving the premises.\n\nPlus SoftBank gives him a $185 million \"consulting fee.\" And a $500 million line of credit to pay back the credit facility.\n\nMartin Shkreli, step aside. Adam Neumann will soon be the new \"most hated man in America.\" When even a free market Republican like Tom Cotton expresses disgust at Neumann's greed, you know that the WeWork founder is soon going to be a pi\u00f1ata, just as Shkreli was.\n\nBut as much as Cotton would like to view him as a fraud, it doesn't appear that he's done anything illegal. Like Shkreli, he saw a flawed system and his combination of greed, smarts and apparent remorselessness allowed him to exploit it.\n\nFor instance: In April 2012, President Barack Obama signed into law the so-called JOBS Act,(1) which allowed companies with 2000 shareholders to remain privately-held. (The previous threshold had been 500.)\n\nThat meant companies like WeWork could stay private longer, raising funds from a broader group of investors without some of the checks that come with being a publicly-traded concern.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWithout greater scrutiny and questions about the magical thinking of executives and private investors, valuations swelled. This helped make venture capitalists desperate to throw money at privately-held unicorns \u2013 so desperate they let founders retain control of their companies through supervoting shares.\n\nThat concession was founded on the notion that CEOs themselves were magical; not infallible, but pretty darn close.\n\nAll of this allowed Neumann to keep raising billions even as his company was losing billions. WeWork's status as a private company gave him the cover he needed to do his inside deals.\n\nHe convinced Son that he and only he could find WeWork's less-than-obvious path to profitability. And at the end, Neumann's control of the company gave him the leverage to extract that shocking $1.7 billion payment on his way out the door.\n\nIt was only when the public got its first peek inside, when WeWork issued its prospectus in mid-August prior to a proposed initial public offering, that the game was finally exposed.\n\nThe market's been in bubble territory for some time. WeWork's implosion will one day be seen as the end of that bubble, just as the AOL-Time Warner deal marked the beginning of the end of the dot-com bubble in 2000.\n\nAt the tail end of every bubble there is always one company whose story is so patently insane that people wonder after the bubble bursts how in the world anyone could have thought it ever made sense. And there is always one person who becomes the stand-in for everything that went wrong.\n\nWeWork is going to be that company. And Adam Neumann is going to be that person.\n\nJoe Nocera is a Bloomberg opinion columnist covering business.
