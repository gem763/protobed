Not long ago, Ferguson happened to see a woman collapse unconscious, and then she watched panic spread across the face of the woman\u2019s husband and ripple on to the faces of the people around him. Though it was not her place, because she is a big-time Hollywood actor and is in no way a medical professional, she waded into the formed crowd, located the woman\u2019s pulse (which she could not properly count) and began barking instructions. A stranger suggested water for the fallen woman, but Ferguson shouted, \u201cNo! Orange juice!\u201d a tip she\u2019d picked up watching ER. When the crowd edged closer, Ferguson yelled, \u201cSome space, please!\u201d The instructions tumbled out of her mouth before she could think to recover them, one after the other, an apparently natural act, until the woman came to and the crowd broke apart. As Ferguson walked away, someone asked, \u201cAre you a nurse?\u201d And she was forced to say no, she was an actor, that her actions had been formed in make-believe, a revelation she admits could have gone either way.\n\nIt was a confidence act, she says now. She is surrounded by cushions in the window seat of a caf\u00e9, in a plush part of south London, waving her long hands around, being confident. \u201cWhat I realised,\u201d she says, making the realisation all over again, \u201cis that as soon as someone takes control, people feel safe.\u201d She looks awed: \u201cHuman psychology\u2026\u201d Then sincere, like she might have done a bad thing: \u201cShe could have been dying.\u201d\n\nFor a while now, Ferguson, 35, has been popping up in some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest productions. She starred in the 2016 thriller The Girl on the Train, and has appeared alongside Tom Cruise in the Mission Impossible franchise and with Hugh Jackman and Michelle Williams in The Greatest Showman. She is about to star in Doctor Sleep, a sequel to The Shining and, next year, in Denis Villeneuve\u2019s Dune and Lisa Joy\u2019s Reminiscence \u2013 major box-office events. She has appeared in magazines and on late-night talk-show couches and on big screens around the world. She has likely already made more money than most people earn in a lifetime.\n\nSo what is more remarkable: that Ferguson did this weird thing, pretended to be a medical professional at a real-life emergency, thought it would be a good idea to do the thing she is best at doing: acting, making people believe? Or that, throughout the entire ordeal, not a single person realised who she was?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018For me, it\u2019s been a slow process\u2019: Rebecca Ferguson wears suit by Margaret Howell.

She looks around the caf\u00e9, where nobody is recognising her. \u201cI never am.\u201d It suits her; it is a good thing. Does she enjoy fame? No! Is she private? Yes, completely, so private she avoids her own phone, which is problematic for her family when they need to reach her. She says of her phone: \u201cI\u2019m sick and tired of the device,\u201d and pours scorn over it. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m tired of technology,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s too simplistic \u2013 it\u2019s all around us. It\u2019s that I know what I\u2019m like. When I start something I want to finish it. I hate having 400 things up in the air.\u201d\n\nSo all this time she spends not being recognised is good for her. She is able to \u201cdisconnect\u201d, which means she can focus fully on \u201clife\u201d: her 15-month-old daughter, her 11-year-old son, a house renovation, a house move, work, publicity for work, learning new accents for work, experimenting with new accents for work, all the many things tied into being a \u201cvery busy\u201d actor and mum and friend and wife.\n\nFor a time, Ferguson was the most recognisable girl in Sweden, but that was her mother\u2019s fault. Ferguson grew up in Stockholm, a happy child of separation. Her mother was English and glamorous and loving. Before dinner parties, she would light a cigar, percolate coffee, fill a glass with cognac and sprinkle it around the home. \u201cLike people do now with sage,\u201d to create a feeling of warmth. She encouraged Ferguson to try new things: gymnastics, salsa, playing cards. When she was very young, Ferguson was \u201cthe only kid in a bridge class, learning to gamble with 70-year-old women\u201d. Her mother thought she might have a knack for numbers; she thought she might have a knack for many things. \u201cBridge is a very cool game,\u201d Ferguson says, \u201cif you were born in 1765.\u201d\n\nWhen Ferguson was 15, her mother encouraged her to attend a TV casting. She\u2019d already tried modelling but disliked it so much she never booked a job. \u201cI remember thinking: that\u2019s absolutely terrifying. Hated the idea. I would blush just standing in front of my class.\u201d But the casting was a revelation. Somehow, she forgot about the camera and the crew \u2013 all those people around \u2013 and she just started \u201ctrying things\u201d, changing language, making things more \u201cnatural\u201d. The job, which she won, happened to be the lead role in a Swedish soap opera, Nya Tider (New Times), that almost everyone in the country tuned into. She filmed five episodes a week for a year and a half.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest What a scream: Rebecca Ferguson in the new Stephen King film Doctor Sleep.

When the job ended, \u201cIt was one of those moments of, \u2018Yes, you\u2019re a famous soap actor in Sweden, what now?\u2019 Most sincere actors go to drama school. They watch Bergman and wear purple berets. That wasn\u2019t me. I didn\u2019t know what the craft was. I didn\u2019t know anything. How do I get a job? I didn\u2019t know what a casting director was. Could I look one up? Could I send them my CV?\u201d\n\nWhat followed was a kind of wilderness, bleak in her telling. She missed out on an important part of youth, she says: \u201cHaving sex with lots of people. Doing drugs.\u201d For a while, she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to act. So she got other jobs. She worked at a daycare centre and as a nanny. She worked in a jewellery shop and in a shoe shop and at a Korean restaurant. \u201cSome people sharp-elbow themselves through life,\u201d she says, \u201cjust to get what they want. I never felt that drive, which sometimes made me think I\u2019m not really worthy of the job I do. For me, it\u2019s been a slow process.\u201d\n\nHer international career is still newish, she thinks, which might explain why, despite having appeared in very major films, few people recognise her on the street. She remembers turning up at castings as recently as five years ago, recording self-tapes, running lines with her mother, who could be counted on to overact. She used to take any role she could get, but \u201cnow I get enough offers to be working and complaining about it. In the beginning, you\u2019re so grateful you grab and you grab. You need to do all the jobs you can. To be versatile, to meet people. But after a while you get to a point where you can sift things out.\u201d She offers me some you-can-do-it advice. \u201cIt will get to the point where you can turn down jobs, too. Rebecca Ferguson? No, way\u2026 Unless it\u2019s that Liverpudlian singer.\u201d\n\nTo prepare for her role in Doctor Sleep, a psychological horror film, Ferguson steeled herself to watch other horror films, which was in itself an ordeal, she admits, because she doesn\u2019t watch horror films, can\u2019t handle them, hates losing control. \u201cI have a bad startle reflex,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you jump out, I will hit you.\u201d Her husband told her she\u2019d be remiss if she didn\u2019t research. \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen Nightmare on Elm Street. Halloween? Fuck off! Because. I. Will. Not. Sleep!\u201d Eventually she relented, on one condition: no clowns, no kids. \u201cHate the look of a clown,\u201d she says. \u201cHate their need for attention. Hate the sorrow of a clown. And children because, well, children are really scary. And he said, \u2018Let\u2019s watch Annabelle.\u2019 Which is about clowns and kids!\u201d\n\nThe upshot of watching so many terrifying horror films was this: she came to understand that the act of losing control was a positive thing, that her responsibility as an adapted Stephen King villain was to enable people to lose control \u2013 that people can\u2019t get enough of it. \u201cIt\u2019s a high,\u201d Ferguson says. \u201cThe electricity of shock, or fear\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Furrowed brows: Rebecca Ferguson in Mission Impossible Rogue Nation. Photograph: Rex Shutterstock\n\nHorror films allow for a managed fear \u2013 audiences know the fear will end \u2013 and in that way a horror film can function as reprieve from the world, I say, which is an uncontrollable shitshow. \u201cBut the world\u2019s always been a shitshow,\u201d she says. \u201cWe think we live in the shitshow, with Brexit, and Trump, and all of the wars. But they battled stuff back in the day. Women not being allowed to vote. Women just being used for various reasons. Slavery. You think we\u2019re in a shitshow now? We\u2019ve constantly been in a shitshow.\u201d\n\nShe takes a breath, then turns earnest for a moment. \u201cResearch the medieval times,\u201d she instructs. \u201cHoly moly. Giving birth in dungeons? It wasn\u2019t easy, dude.\u201d\n\nThe night before we meet, I watch Ferguson in the latest Mission Impossible film. She is demure and focussed and doesn\u2019t smile much, though nobody smiles much \u2013 it is a film-length sequence of furrowed brows. In real life, she is sweary and bright, vibrant and loud. She is a coo-er. She coos at other people\u2019s kids and at other people\u2019s dogs. When it is time to leave, she continues talking, because she is excited. She is excited about her new house. She is excited about her upcoming films. She is excited about working with very good directors. She is excited about being listened to in meetings, that when she makes a suggestion, she sees it in print in the following morning\u2019s script.\n\nThat is success, she says: being listened to. Does she consider herself successful? Yes! Who cares if nobody recognises her?\n\nDoctor Sleep is in cinemas nationwide from 31 October\n\nStyling by Richard Sloan at Saint Luke Artists; hair by Halley Brisker and makeup by Emma Lovell, both at Wall Group", "description": "She\u2019s been in some of the biggest blockbusters of recent years, yet has somehow always remained below the radar.
