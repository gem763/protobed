But if there\u2019s one thing that stays constant - its 'vulnerability'. A serious crush takes your hormones, mind and heart for a ride, drowning you in everything from excitement, nervousness to anticipation. The main task at hand is to break the ice, and pursue your wannabe-significant-other in the right manner.\n\nHowever, a lot of us tend to make some rookie mistakes that can certainly wreak havoc and soil a relationship even before it starts!\n\nTake a look at these 5 habits that are a definite recipe for disaster when it comes to wooing your flame.\n\nShowing Off - A Big No!\n\nMX Player\n\nWhile creating a good impression on your crush is no easy feat, going overboard with it is just a bad idea. The worst thing you can do is to show off- which only goes on to display your lack of self confidence and constant need for validation.The best way to brag about yourself to others is probably not to brag at all. Let other people do the bragging for you \u2013 that\u2019ll get you all the attention!\n\nAvoid Being Clingy\n\nMX Player\n\nHaven\u2019t we all wished that our crush replied to our messages almost instantly, ask us out for a movie maybe? But hey, the last you want to be in such a scenario is clingy! It's important to give your FLAME his/her space, and let things happen in their own time.\n\nInstead of hyperventilating and being clingy, allow your crush some breathing space. It will only make them realise that you respect their personal life, and they might be more likely to interact with you.\n\nDon't Be Over-Possessive\n\nMX Player\n\nAmong the top ways to butcher a potential relationship is being unreasonably possessive. I mean, it should be yin and yang - the ideal balance of being concerned enough to question, but never being overtly intrusive.\n\nJust like every other thing in this world, excess of anything is bad so there has to be a limit to everything. Give them a little space.\n\nDon\u2019t Take Too Long To Text Back\n\nMX Player\n\nIf you have a crush on someone, quit playing mind games. Reply to their text as soon as you see it. If you know what you want to say, don\u2019t hesitate to say it. If you genuinely don\u2019t know how to respond, then give it some time and think over it.\n\nWhile most of us think that replying instantly will make people think we are either jobless or too desperate, it not true at all. You should be comfortable with the person you like, that\u2019s what marks good start!\n\nDon\u2019t Always Talk, Listen!\n\nMX Player\n\nHeart-mark this point right away! Don\u2019t be the person who goes on and on about their day, not giving the other person a chance to interject. Sit back, be all ears, make the other person feel important, and ask questions too.\n\nThis gesture is as heart-warming as it gets!\n\nIf you\u2019re in the zone of impressing a crush, or want to steer your relationship to rosy heights, join our favourite digital sweethearts Ritvik Sahore (essaying the role of Rajat) and Taniya Maniktala (playing Ishita) in their journey on MX Exclusive - Flames Season 2, A TVF Original.\n\nDirected by Apoorv Singh Karki and written by Kunal Aneja, the second season of the show is all set to make the audience experience a gamut of emotions, attraction, first fights, deep-rooted discomforts and the most important - keeping faith and trusting each other.
