Isn\u2019t that insane?\n\nYewande opened up about the debate over her looks (Picture: In The Style)\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been on Twitter for the last few days, I\u2019ve even seen a Tweet today like, \u201cYou guys are trying to force Yewande on us like the way you forced Lupita [Nyong\u2019o]\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a huge thing about dark-skinned women and whether society finds them beautiful, and whether they find me beautiful because I\u2019m dark-skinned.\n\n\u2018It has been an issue that\u2019s been going on for the last three days, it\u2019s like, \u201cAre you not tired?\u201d It\u2019s so mad.\u2019\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just faceless people on Twitter, but those that Yewande meets in public as well.\n\nYewande feels \u2018like that ugly friend\u2019 amid the debate (Picture: Rex)\n\nShe continued: \u2018Anytime I meet people, [they say] \u201cOh my god you\u2019re so pretty\u201d but it\u2019s not like, \u201cOh you\u2019re so pretty\u201d. It\u2019s more of, \u201cOh I see all the backlash you\u2019re getting and I just want you to know I find you attractive.\u201d\n\n\u2018I just feel like that ugly friend who people have to tell they\u2019re really pretty because like, they feel sorry for them.\u2019\n\nThe ITV2 star explained that\u2019s often the hardest part of life after the Love Island villa.\n\n\u2018People feel like they have to have opinions. They forget I am a real person, I do see these comments,\u2019 she added.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t see all of them, but I do see it, I have feelings like everybody else. But I just try not to let it phase me, and just try and move on, really.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just like people having an opinion of you without even knowing you like positive or negative, it\u2019s hard sometimes.\u2019\n\nYewande Biala\u2019s In The Style Power Edit is available now.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
