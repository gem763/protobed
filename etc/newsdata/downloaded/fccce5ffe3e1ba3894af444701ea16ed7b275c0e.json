The government shut down coverage almost immediately as protests began, according to an order by the prime minister seen by Reuters.\n\nThe offices of local and international media were attacked last week, and journalists have said they were warned not to cover the protests. With the internet down, there was little coverage of the protests on television.\n\nAbdul Mahdi's government has sought to address the grievances of protesters, who demand the removal of government and a political class they view as endemically corrupt.\n\nMinisters met provincial governors, to address grievances across the country, which include crumbling infrastructure, toxic water and high unemployment. But proposed reforms, some of which have been recycled from a package of proposed reforms after protests in 2015, are unlikely to ease public anger.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo condemned the recent violence and urged Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi to \"exercise maximum restraint\" and \"address protesters' grievances\", the U.S. State Department said on Tuesday.\n\nA readout of a call between the two provided by Abdul Mahdi's office on Monday said Pompeo \"expressed confidence in the Iraqi forces.\" (Reporting by Ahmed Rasheed and John Davison in Baghdad and Raya Jalabi in Erbil; writing by Raya Jalabi aditing by Timothy Heritage)", "description": "Iraq had its calmest night since anti-government protests began more than a week ago over corruption and unemployment.
