He\u2019s the biggest. But he ain\u2019t the baddest,\u201d Velasquez said during a press conference at T-Mobile Arena. \u201cI beat him once before in the UFC, and I\u2019m ready to do it again.\u201d\n\nThe foundation for a Velasquez-Lesnar storyline was put in motion by WWE a couple of weeks ago. Then last Friday, Velasquez made his first WWE appearance last week on the FOX debut of \u201cSmackdown\u201d and had a physical confrontation with Lesnar.\n\nAs first reported by MMA Junkie last week, Velasquez notified the UFC of his intention to withdraw from the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency testing pool, effectively retiring from MMA. He made that move official \u2013 or as official as MMA retirements can get \u2013 on Friday and has signed a multi-year deal with WWE.\n\n\u201cAs of right now, the chapter is closed on my MMA career, and I\u2019m focusing on the task at hand with the WWE,\u201d Velasquez said after the press conference. \u201cI love this sport (pro wrestling). I\u2019ve kind of rebirthed myself into reliving it and loving it again. I\u2019m all in on doing this. I\u2019m diving deep into this. This is what I\u2019m doing for right now.\u201d\n\nVelasquez struggled to get his UFC career on track because of various injuries. In February, Velasquez had his first fight in two-and-a-half years and lost to Francis Ngannou by TKO in 26 seconds, suffering a knee injury in the process.\n\nWWE officials also announced that current lineal heavyweight boxing champion Tyson Fury will wrestle against Braun Strowman at the \u201cCrown Jewel\u201d event in Saudi Arabia.", "description": "Cain Velasquez informed the UFC of his retirement from MMA as he moves on to a full-time career in pro wrestling.", "authors": ["John Morgan", "Nolan King", "Christian Stein", "Mike Bohn", "Matt Erickson", "Ben Fowlkes"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/brock-lesnar-cain-velasquez-wwe.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
