He would not be looking out the window at the TPC Sawgrass and realizing he\u2019ll be part of the field next March at The Players Championship, followed by his debut a month later at Augusta National for the Masters.\n\nIt explains why Griffin, not long after he rolled in a 6-foot par putt with eerie calm to win on the PGA Tour, fought back tears when asked how he got to this point.\n\nHis family always opened one gift on Christmas Eve, and Griffin was 8 when he got a putter. The next morning, he got the rest of his starter set - a 5-iron, 7-iron, 9-iron and a 3-wood. No one in his family played golf. Until then, his only experience was whacking balls in a field with a persimmons club his father had bought from a barrel of clubs that sold for $1 each.\n\nA mile from their home in Blacksburg, Virginia, was a nine-hole course called \u201cThe Hill\u201d where he could spend all day for $9. And then one day, Griffin was invited to Blacksburg Country Club, where he noticed Prater, the head pro, conducting a clinic for a small group of kids.\n\nPrater took it from there.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here without him,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cHe opened every door in golf that I ever had - teaching me for free, giving me a membership. He\u2019s had my back my entire journey.\u201d\n\nPrater, who now works at Roanoke Country Club, remembers a young boy who asked if he could come to the clinic. He didn\u2019t know much about the family\u2019s financial situation except it was clear Griffin could use the help and that he had a passion for the game.\n\nWhen Griffin\u2019s father died of a brain tumor, Prater called the house that day and offered the 12-year-old boy a free membership to Blacksburg Country Club. Prater\u2019s son is five years younger, and he and Griffin became friends.\n\n\u201cHe stayed at my house quite a bit because he could walk to the course,\u201d Prater said. \u201cI took him on as another son. He was sad, and I think him coming down and staying with me some and getting away from things that reminded him of his father \u2026 he pulled from playing golf. That was his way of getting away.\u201d\n\nGriffin says he would leave the house at 7 a.m. and stay at the course until 7 p.m.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what made me fall in love with the game at a young age,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cIf Steve didn\u2019t bring me in at that real vulnerable part of my life, then there\u2019s no chance that I would be playing golf in college - or winning the Houston Open.\u201d\n\nGriffin shot 51 for nine holes in his first junior event at the club. By the time he finished high school, he was good enough to play four years at Virginia Commonwealth and told Prater he wanted to try playing for a living.\n\nJust like everything else in life, nothing came easily.\n\nGriffin made $975 in his first mini-tour event, minus the $950 entry fee. He picked up experience, along with plenty of debt. He thought about quitting more than once, and he might have done that if not for Will Wilcox - whom he met at that first mini-tour event - asking Griffin to caddie for him at The Greenbrier in 2014. Wilcox tied for fourth. Griffin made $17,000, at the time his largest check in golf.\n\nPrater, who gleaned everything he could about instruction during stints at Sailfish Point and Jupiter Island Club in Florida, kept teaching through phone calls and texts and whenever he could get out to a tournament. He also knew Griffin needed more than he could offer.\n\n\u201cI mostly teach juniors and members. I build golf swings,\u201d Prater said. \u201cWhen he was in Latin America, he was starting to spin his wheels. He needed some confidence. He needed other opinions.\u201d\n\nPrater hooked him up with noted instructor Todd Anderson because they have similar philosophies, and Griffin became more polished. He still leans on Prater for the short game, and they keep in touch through texts, phone calls and the occasional video.\n\n\u201cTodd has been a huge help for Lanto,\u201d Prater said. \u201cIt\u2019s a team now, and it works really good.\u201d\n\nAnd yes, it\u2019s finally work.\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t charged me in 17 years,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cHe would never let me pay. I gave him a bonus at the end of last year, and at the beginning of this season, I put him on the payroll - 1% of everything, and I put in a $25,000 bonus for a PGA Tour victory.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be the easiest check I write.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Steve Prater can recall only one time in more than 30 years as a PGA professional that he refused payment for a golf lesson.
