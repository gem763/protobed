The COO said that he took the decision alone, without discussing it with Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam or other board members.\n\n\"The Homburger investigation did not identify any indication that the CEO had approved the observation of Iqbal Khan nor that he was aware of it prior to Sept. 18, 2019, after the observation had been aborted,\" the bank said in a statement.\n\nNo evidence was found suggesting that Mr. Khan tried to poach employees or clients, it said.\n\nThe bank's head of global security services also resigned.\n\nJames Walker has been appointed COO and board member.\n\nMr. Khan has joined Swiss bank UBS Group AG (UBS), where he is scheduled to start work Tuesday.\n\nWrite to Pietro Lombardi at pietro.lombardi@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 01, 2019 01:32 ET (05:32 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
