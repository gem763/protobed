No need.\"\n\nWhile another shared: \"Can Katya please tone it down a notch or two?!!\"\n\n(Image: DIGITAL/EROTEME.CO.UK)\n\nA third added: \"Katya needs to calm down, kinda fed up of her now.\"\n\nAnother added: \"Can we get a warning before Katya screeeeeeeches so we can hit the mute button??? My fury is justified with their undeserved high score.\"\n\nLast night, Katya was left incredibly emotional after she and BBC presenter Mike wowed the judges with their performance.\n\nAfter receiving a nine from judge Motsi Mabuse, Katya couldn't contain the tears as they hugged tightly.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nAs an inconsolable Katya was asked by Claudia Winkleman if she was alright, Mike kissed her on the cheek.\n\nGrabbing him around the neck, she squealed: \"I want to kiss him so much! He worked so hard!\"\n\nBut eagle-eyed fans noticed the awkward reaction on Neil Jones' face in response to Katya's cringeworthy comment.\n\n(Image: BBC/Guy Levy)\n\nTonight's results show was a shocker as the third celebrity to be booted off the show was revealed as radio DJ Dev Griffin and his professional partner Dianne Buswell.\n\nAnneka Rice and Kevin Clifton received the lowest score last week and were voted off after scoring a total of 11 points for their Charleston to Woo Hoo from Kill Bill.\n\nJames Cracknell was the first celebrity to be voted off the popular BBC dance competition after struggling to impress on the dancefloor with his professional partner Luba Mushtuk .\n\n*Strictly Come Dancing returns next Saturday at 6.40pm on BBC One", "description": "The pro dancer was heard dramatically chanting the dance counts in her celebrity partner Mike's ear during their comical Quickstep performance", "authors": ["Tiffany Wallis", "Image", "Bbc", "Digital Eroteme.Co.Uk", "Bbc Guy Levy"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20567765.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EHP_CHP_121019SCD_6014JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
