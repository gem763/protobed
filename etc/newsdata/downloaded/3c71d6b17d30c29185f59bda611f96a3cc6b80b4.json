He only has one full game under his belt - we hope he can give us much more in the coming matches.'\n\nValverde has received a boost with the news that both Samuel Umtiti and Junior Firpo have been declared fit. The pair had travelled with the squad but were awaiting medical clearance.\n\nMessi is on the road to recovery after injury, but is still not 100 per cent fit, says his manager\n\nHowever, Barcelona are definitely without suspended pair Ousmane Dembele and Gerard Pique, with the club losing an appeal over Dembele's red card last week for dissent.\n\nDespite clawing their way to second place in the table, Valverde acknowledged his side have suffered a torrid start to their campaign, highlighted by their shock loss at Granada last month.\n\n'We have had a difficult time but what I like is that we have been able to react,' added Valverde.\n\n'It is what we have been doing in recent years - overcoming slumps. What we would like is to go top, but we can't do that because we have slipped up.'\n\nMessi returned to the field against Sevilla recently, when he played 90 minutes and scored\n\nOpponents Eibar have improved in recent weeks and go into the game on a four-match unbeaten run in LaLiga.\n\nAnd their coach Jose Luis Mendilibar is refusing to accept that Messi may present an easier than usual challenge given the injury situations he has faced this season.\n\nMendilibar told a press conference: 'Against us Messi always scores goals.\n\n'(But) we can't be obsessed with him and the key is to stop the whole team. We have a plan to stop Barcelona, and Messi is among them.'", "description": "Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde has warned against heaping expectation back upon Lionel Messi as he continues his recovery from an injury-plagued start to the new season.", "authors": ["Pa Sport Staff"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/18/19894844-0-image-a-6_1571418424519.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
