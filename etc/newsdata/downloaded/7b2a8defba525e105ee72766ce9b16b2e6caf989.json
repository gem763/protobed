Some bankers, however, say an IPO may prove challenging in an industry past its peak, given how strongly cyclical the business is.\n\nCredito Fondiario manages 52 billion euros in problem loans and Cerved 54.5 billion, meaning a tie-up would turn it into Italy\u2019s biggest bad loan specialist, leapfrogging current market leader doValue (DOVA.MI).", "description": "Italian bad loan specialists Banca IFIS and Credito Fondiario on Wednesday ended talks to set up a debt recovery partnership with IFIS citing disagreements over governance.", "authors": ["Valentina Za", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
