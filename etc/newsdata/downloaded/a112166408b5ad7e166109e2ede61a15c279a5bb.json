That's no small feat considering the overwhelming amount of pessimism present in the marketplace.\n\nAfter all, investors are actually willing to lock in losses today in order to preserve purchasing power in the future. That's not something you usually see when markets are calm, cool, and collected.\n\nRead more: 'You could have a massive profit over the short term': Billionaire 'Bond King' Jeff Gundlach shares a strategy for taking advantage of an interest-rate increase\n\nBut to Hennessy, the market's jitters are due to the \"recycling of headlines\" concerning tariffs, recession fears, and a yield curve that was inverted for \"10 minutes.\" He thinks negative sentiment is way overblown and full of hyperbole \u2014 and he's not shy in making his bullish thesis clear.\n\nHennessy laid out his thoughts in detail: \"If I told you that you were going to have 2% interest rates, you're going to have 1.5% 10-year Treasury, a 2% 30-year treasury, mortgage rates for 30-years at 4%, full employment, corporate profits at all-time high, corporate cash flow at all-time high, consumer discretionary spending continues along with consumer confidence, you'd say: 'Neil, I've got to get into this market.'\"\n\n\"You would not short into that,\" he added.\n\nTo further his bull-continuation thesis, Hennessy cites a veritable war chest of capital waiting to be deployed.\n\n\"There's tons of money on the sideline,\" he said. \"If you look at the balance sheets of the S&P 500, there's over $5 trillion in cash and short-term investments, sitting in those 500 companies.\"\n\nThat means there's no shortage of capital to raise dividends and buyback stock going-forward \u2014 two potential catalysts that can send shares soaring higher.\n\nWith all of that established, Hennessy relays four stocks he thinks have a great opportunity to flourish. He's a big proponent of the price-to-sales ratio as far as evaluation is concerned, due to the amount of tinkering a company can do to manipulate their bottom-line price-to-earnings ratio.\n\nWithout further ado, here are the stocks Hennessy sees big opportunities in, listed in descending price-to-sales order:\n\n1.Restoration Hardware ( RH)\n\nPrice-to-sales: 1.21\n\nYear-to-date performance: 41%\n\n2.
