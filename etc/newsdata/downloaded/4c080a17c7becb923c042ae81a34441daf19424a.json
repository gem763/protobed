The city began exploring the possibility of a public takeover after PG&E PCG, -3.50% sought chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January, citing more than $30 billion in potential liability costs stemming from its role in sparking deadly wildfires in 2017 and 2018.\n\nIf the bid is accepted, it could significantly shrink PG&E, removing hundreds of miles of wire and siphoning off hundreds of thousands of customers. It is a public vote of no-confidence in PG&E, which has struggled to prevent its equipment from causing fires amid a sizable increase in wildfire risk in northern California.\n\nMayor London Breed and City Attorney Dennis Herrera said in a written statement that the city\u2019s offer is \u201ccompetitive, fair and equitable.\u201d They added: \u201cIt will offer financial stability for PG&E, while helping the City expand upon our efforts to provide reliable, safe, clean and affordable electricity to the residents and businesses of San Francisco.\u201d\n\nAn expanded version of this report appears on WSJ.com.\n\nAlso popular on WSJ.com:\n\nWorkers are fleeing big cities for smaller ones \u2014 and taking their jobs with them.\n\nPeople urged to stop vaping following more deaths, hundreds of illnesses.", "description": "The City of San Francisco on Sunday said it has offered $2.5 billion to acquire PG&E Corp.\u2019s electrical lines serving the city, a potential first step...", "authors": ["Katherine Blunt"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HC040_pge_ZG_20190115113109.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
