Amazon has a secret outlet, plus a giveaway section for scoring free stuff", "language": "en", "text": "The editors at Yahoo Lifestyle are committed to finding you the best products at the best prices. At times, we may receive a share from purchases made via links on this page.\n\nView photos What will Amazon come up with next? (Photo: Getty Images) More\n\nAmazon just got Amazinger. Why? There\u2019s a secret outlet section. Shhh. And a giveaway page where you can get stuff for free. Surprise!\n\nFirst let\u2019s start with the giveaways. In an example of pure marketing genius, Amazon features a selection of products you can click to instantly win. If you don\u2019t win, you can still put the item in your cart at a deep discount. Entering to win is free as long as you have an Amazon account. Sometimes you\u2019ll have to watch a 15-second video before entering, but to us that\u2019s a small price to pay for a freebie.\n\nNow onto the outlet. It\u2019s like an overstock warehouse with clickable merchandise. You\u2019ll find thousands of items by category (electronics, beauty, pet supplies, home & furniture and more) and deals on everyday necessities like razors and fancy stuff like watches. For a bargain hunter, it\u2019s truly fantastical.\n\nIn true tag-sale style, the offerings are pretty random. A recent glance at the Super Discounts section revealed a dog-wearing-a-sombrero taco holder next to a set of essential oil roller bottles. Not that there\u2019s anything wrong with that.\n\nJust like when you go looking for deals in person, it can take awhile to find a diamond in the rough. So we tracked down the gems for you. But remember, these are mainly overstock items so if you see something you love, click away or someone else might.
