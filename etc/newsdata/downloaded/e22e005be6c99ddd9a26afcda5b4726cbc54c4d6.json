I saw it myself,\" Hawley tweeted.\n\n\"If Carrie Lam wants to demonstrate otherwise, here's an idea: resign.\"\n\nThe Hong Kong protests were sparked by opposition to a now-scrapped proposal by Lam's government that would have allowed extraditions to the mainland, but have since transformed into a wider movement for democratic reform -- including universal suffrage -- and police accountability.\n\nThe semi-autonomous hub enjoys freedoms under the terms of its 1997 handover to China by Britain that critics say are being eroded because of Beijing's tightening grip on the city.\n\nWhile the demonstrations have largely been peaceful, there have been increasingly violent and frequent clashes between the police and hardcore protesters.\n\nProtesters have accused the police of brutality and excessive tactics, while authorities say they are acting lawfully in a bid to end violence by demonstrators -- who have vandalised infrastructure like subway stations and businesses perceived to be pro-Beijing.", "description": "Hong Kong's leader on Tuesday hit back at a US senator who said the city is becoming a police state, a day after a massive rally called on Washington to punish Beijing over sliding freedoms in the international hub.
