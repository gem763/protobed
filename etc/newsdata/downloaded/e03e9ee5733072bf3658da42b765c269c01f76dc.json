(Carolyn Kaster/AP)\n\nIn Washington, there is no figure quite as recognizable as the anonymous figure. They\u2019ve written best-selling books (\u201cPrimary Colors\u201d); been primary sources for both history-altering stories (Deep Throat) and juicy tales of palace intrigue (This account is the result of more than two dozen interviews); and one has even written a viral op-ed in the New York Times about resisting President Trump from within the administration.\n\nYet, in the annals of anonymity, nothing seems quite as fraught, quite as intriguing or quite as dangerous as the whistleblower. On Thursday, the day after Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and his colleagues on the House Intelligence Committee read a complaint regarding Trump\u2019s communications with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2014 (\u201cvery well written,\u201d Schiff opined) \u2014 the whistleblower\u2019s report was declassified and gobbled up by the masses. The president raged behind closed doors that it appeared to be a work of spycraft bordering on \u201ctreason,\u201d and the New York Times published hints about who, exactly, this person might be.\n\nFor once, this doesn\u2019t feel like just another version of D.C.\u2019s favorite parlor game of Guess Who.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that we protect the identity of this whistleblower,\u201d Rep. Katie Porter, a freshman Democrat from California, said in a hallway interview.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we hope to do,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a news conference. \u201cProtect the whistleblower.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe will do everything we can to protect this courageous whistle\u00adblower,\u201d tweeted Schiff, who said his committee is trying to figure out a way for this person to testify.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019d like to see with the whistleblower is,\u201d said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), \u201cwho this person is.\u201d\n\nWhoever this person is, they\u2019ve put Washington in a tizzy. The whistleblower alleged, among other things, that Trump had pressured the president of Ukraine to \u201cinitiate or continue an investigation into the activities of former Vice President\u201d \u2014 and potential 2020 election opponent \u2014 \u201cJoseph Biden and his son, Hunter Biden,\u201d and led the White House to release a summary of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president, which, oddly, seemed to back up parts of the complaint.\n\n[Whistleblower painstakingly gathered material and almost single-handedly set impeachment in motion]\n\nBefore the whistleblower, Democrats couldn\u2019t even agree whether they were on the path to impeachment. After, Pelosi called Democrats together for an all-hands meeting and announced her support for an impeachment inquiry, which, according to the six committees already investigating Trump, was already underway.\n\n\u201cI think she is saying full steam ahead on an impeachment inquiry,\u201d Rep. Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington, said coming out of that Tuesday meeting. \u201cObviously we\u2019re in an impeachment inquiry, but there has been some confusion around exactly what that means.\u201d\n\nWhat does it mean for Rep. Brad Sherman, a Democrat from California who introduced articles of impeachment more than two years ago?\n\n\u201cThere is no great joy,\u201d he said. For all the celebrating on Resistance Twitter, and all caps diatribes from @RealDonaldTrump (\u201cTHE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!\u201d), politicians on both sides of the aisle did their best to remain subdued. No talk about excitement from Democrats, just lip-biting grimaces and words like \u201csober,\u201d \u201csomber\u201d and \u201csad.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is not a matter of personal vindication,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cThere is no \u2018I told you so.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIt would be a little early for that. There would still be time for plenty of plot twists before the end, if this were a film. And, according to Republicans, it is.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this movie before,\u201d said Rep. Michael R. Turner, a Republican from Ohio.\n\n\u201cMany Americans have seen this movie too many times,\u201d said Rep. Brad Wenstrup, another Republican from Ohio.\n\nThe Ohioans were speaking from behind the dais Thursday at an Intelligence Committee hearing featuring the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, who handled the whistle\u00adblower\u2019s complaint. Of concern to the Republicans was their belief that Democrats were just continuing their singular quest to ruin the president and have now enlisted the help of an unnamed, unreliable narrator.\n\n\u201cThe complaint relied on hearsay evidence,\u201d said Rep. Devin Nunes of California, the highest-ranking Republican on the committee. \u201cThe whistleblower displayed arguable, political bias against Trump.\u201d\n\n[Who\u2019s who in the whistleblower complaint]\n\nIt is true that in the report, the whistleblower admitted to not being \u201ca direct witness to most of the events described\u201d and that the inspector general found an \u201carguable political bias on the part of a rival candidate.\u201d But that didn\u2019t change the fact that the whistleblower \u2014 who was informed of \u201cvarious facts\u201d by \u201cmore than half a dozen U.S. officials\u201d \u2014 provided a report that the inspector general found both \u201curgent\u201d and \u201ccredible.\u201d But when the person at the center of a scandal is a blank canvas, politicians can try to paint him or her however they\u2019d like.\n\nSo Republicans paint the whistleblower as a \u201cpartisan\u201d with \u201csecond-hand\u201d information or, worse, as a joke.\n\nRep. Steve Stivers, an oft-grinning Republican from Ohio known for his easy laughs and frequent jokes, whipped out a cellphone with a picture of President Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky in the Oval Office.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s some breaking news!\u201d he cracked on Thursday, holding up his cellphone for others to see near the House floor.\n\nOn the picture, the meme under Clinton read: \u201cEveryone remembers my whistleblower.\u201d\n\nHe roared with laughter at people\u2019s appalled reactions.\n\nDemocrats don\u2019t think any of this is funny.\n\n\u201cDirector, you don\u2019t believe the whistleblower is a political hack, do you?\u201d Schiff asked Maguire.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who the whistleblower is, Mr. Chairman,\u201d Maguire answered. \u201cI\u2019ve done my utmost to protect his anonymity.\u201d\n\nNot everyone has been keen on keeping the secret. Rep. Dan Crenshaw, a freshman Republican from Texas and former Navy SEAL, said he\u2019s not so sure this whistleblower is actually a whistle\u00adblower.\n\n\u201cNot by the traditional definition,\u201d he said. When most of us think of a whistleblower, he said, we think of someone who was asked to do something illegal, refused and then sounded the alarm.\n\n\u201cI have an intelligence background, so I know what an intelligence analyst writes like,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis sounds like that, like they did their own investigation. And then developed their own report. So you have to ask yourself, is that really a whistleblower?\u201d\n\nAround the time Crenshaw posed this question, standing alone outside a Capitol Hill office building, the president was in a meeting with staffers and families of the delegation at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, with a similar theory.\n\n\u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person, who\u2019s the person who gave the whistleblower the information? Because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d Trump said, according to audio obtained by the Los Angeles Times. \u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now.\u201d\n\nJust an hour after the Times published its report on these not-so-veiled threats from the president (one form of punishment for treason, historically, has been death), it published another bombshell \u2014 reporting that the whistleblower worked for the CIA and other details that could potentially identify him.\n\nFor more than a year now, the Times has managed to keep the author of its anonymous op-ed a secret. It\u2019s possible that the whistle\u00adblower won\u2019t be so lucky.\n\n\u201cMaybe the two are the same person,\u201d a Republican staffer in the Senate said. After requesting anonymity, of course.\n\nRachael Bade contributed to this report.", "description": "In the annals of anonymity, nothing seems quite as fraught, quite as intriguing or quite as dangerous as the whistleblower.", "authors": ["Ben Terris", "Feature Reporter Covering National Politics", "Ben Terris Is A Writer In The Washington Post'S Style Section With A Focus On National Politics.
