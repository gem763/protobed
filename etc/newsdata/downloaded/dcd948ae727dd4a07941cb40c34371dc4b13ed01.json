Marcelo Claure, the former CEO of Sprint \u2014 which SoftBank acquired in 2012 \u2014 will be the new executive chairman at WeWork. Adam Neumann, the founder and CEO who is receiving more than a billion dollars to leave, will become a \u201cboard observer\u201d without voting power. Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunningham remain co-CEOs of WeWork.\n\nSoftBank is already WeWork\u2019s largest investor, to the tune of more than $10 billion. The new deal includes $5 billion in further funding, $1.5 billion that had already been pledged for the future, and a $3 billion tender offer for existing shareholders outside SoftBank. WeWork claims, however, that SoftBank won\u2019t have a majority of voting rights at any company meeting, making it an \u201cassociate\u201d rather than a subsidiary.\n\nSoftBank CEO and chairman Masayoshi Son downplayed the the nature of what can really only be described as an extraordinary bailout. \u201cIt is not unusual for the world\u2019s leading technology disruptors to experience growth challenges as the one WeWork just faced,\u201d Son said in a statement. \u201cSince the vision remains unchanged, SoftBank has decided to double down on the company by providing a significant capital infusion and operational support.\u201d\n\nSon has become an even bigger player in tech investment in recent years with SoftBank\u2019s colossal Vision Fund, making huge deals that basically no-one else is able to match. This latest injection of liquidity suggests a degree of faith in WeWork\u2019s long-term prospects, which would put Son out of step with the broader investment community; WeWork was forced to scrap its IPO after investors baulked at the details in its S-1 filing.", "description": "Former Sprint CEO elected executive chairman", "authors": ["Sam Byford", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OiJvdUWn54knFq_yFKCnf7XCtjg=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18979576/acastro_190814_1777_wework_ipo_0002.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
