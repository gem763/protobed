Enjoy!pic.twitter.com/7DYITRpY8E \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 17, 2019\n\nHunter Biden has been an executive at MBNA beginning in 1996.\n\nThe 41-year-old also criticized Biden's position on the board of Burisma Holdings - a Ukranian natural gas company - as well as a Chinese private equity firm.\n\n'When you're the father and your sons entire career is dependent on that, they own you,' he said.\n\nThe 41-year-old also criticized Biden's position on the board of Burisma Holdings - a Ukranian natural gas company - as well as a Chinese private equity firm\n\nTrump Jr. then turned his attention to Biden's remarks toward his family.\n\n'They want to question my family,' Trump Jr. chirped.\n\n'If Donald Trump Jr. took one-point-five dollars from China -- not $1.5 billion, Sean -- just one-point-five dollars, we'd solve the fake news media problem because their heads would explode and there would be none of them left.\n\n'It would be over if I did that for a 'no-show' job for $83,000 a month in Ukraine.\n\nTrump Jr. dismissed the obvious nepotism comparison that could be made between the Trumps and the Bidens, falsely claiming that his family made its money in international business prior to Trump's elections.\n\nForbes reported that since Trump's inaugruation, his sons have sold off $110million of their father's real estate hildings - with the 100 tiny transactions flying under the radar.\n\nThe sons sold a piece of land from the Dominican Republic in January 2018, a clear violation of their father's pledge not to do any new foreign deals while in office.\n\nIn Hunter Biden's interview with 'Good Monring America' on Tuesday, he said he exercised poor judgement in his business deals with Ukraine and China - but emphasized he did nothing wrong in the scandals that have engulfed his father's presidential bid and made the family a political target for President Trump.\n\nAn actual quote from Don Jr about Hunter Biden: \"When you're the father and your sons entire career is dependent on that, they own you\" pic.twitter.com/KABtg5XzSa \u2014 Andrew Lawrence (@ndrew_lawrence) October 17, 2019\n\nTrump Jr. dismissed the obvious nepotism comparison that could be made between the Trumps and the Bidens\n\n'In retrospect, look, I think that it was poor judgment on my part. Is that I think that it was poor judgment because I don't believe now, when I look back on it - I know that there was - did nothing wrong at all,' he told ABC News in an interview that aired Tuesday morning on Good Morning America.\n\n'However, was it poor judgment to be in the middle of something that is...a swamp in- in - in many ways? Yeah.'\n\n'I gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That's where I made the mistake,' he noted.\n\n'So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.'\n\n'Did I make a mistake? Well, maybe in the grand scheme of things, yeah,' he said, in reference to fallout from his overseas business. 'But did I make a mistake based upon some ethical lapse? Absolutely not.'", "description": "The Wharton School legacy appeared on 'Hannity' Wednesday to slam Hunter Biden for having benefited from his father's political positions as early as the 1990s.", "authors": ["Dailymail.Com Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/06/19822312-0-image-a-81_1571291625538.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
