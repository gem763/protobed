REUTERS/Khalid al-Mousily\n\nBAGHDAD (Reuters) - Hundreds of Iraqi protesters remained in Baghdad\u2019s central Tahrir Square on Sunday, defying a bloody crackdown that killed scores over the weekend and an overnight raid by security forces seeking to disperse them.\n\nYoung men had erected barricades on a bridge leading to the capital\u2019s fortified Green Zone between them and security forces who continued to lob tear gas canisters towards them.\n\nAt least 67 Iraqis were killed and hundreds wounded on Friday and Saturday, as demonstrators clashed with security forces and militia groups in a second wave of protests against Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi\u2019s government this month, bringing the total death toll in October to 224.\n\nIraq\u2019s elite Counter-Terrorism Service said on Sunday it had deployed in the streets of Baghdad to protect important state buildings \u201cfrom undisciplined elements\u201d.\n\nTwo security sources had told Reuters on Saturday that the elite counter-terrorism forces had been deployed in Baghdad and had been told to \u201cuse all necessary measures\u201d to end the protests against Abdul Mahdi\u2019s government.\n\nCounter-terrorism forces beat and arrested dozens of protesters in the southern city of Nassiriya on Saturday night. They broke up the demonstrations in Tahrir Square with tear gas and stun grenades but some protesters have regrouped.\n\nThe unrest has broken nearly two years of relative stability in Iraq, which from 2003 to 2017 endured a foreign occupation, civil war and an Islamic State insurgency.\n\nIt poses the biggest challenge to Abdul Mahdi since he took office just a year ago. Despite promising reforms and ordering a broad cabinet reshuffle, he has so far struggled to address the protesters\u2019 discontent.\n\nPolitical alliances backing his fragile coalition government began to fracture, making his continued leadership increasingly precarious.", "description": "Hundreds of Iraqi protesters remained in Baghdad's central Tahrir Square on Sunday, defying a bloody crackdown that killed scores over the weekend and an overnight raid by security forces seeking to disperse them.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191027&t=2&i=1445458895&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9Q07X", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
