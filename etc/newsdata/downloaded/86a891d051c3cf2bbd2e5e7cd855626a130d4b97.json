The two organizations declared that running the image was in the interest of the public, but the BBC did issue a letter of apology for failing to warn the prince about what would be shown in the segment.\n\n\u201cThis was an important piece of journalism which led to the arrest, conviction and imprisonment of two members of a neo-Nazi group,\u201d a BBC source familiar with the outlet\u2019s decision-making told HuffPost on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe image of The Duke of Sussex was included to show the abhorrent nature of their behaviour and OFCOM has subsequently concluded that there was a clear editorial rationale for using the image which, in the context of the news report, was considered unlikely to incite crime,\u201d the source said via email.\n\n\u201cNaturally we regret the distress caused and we apologised for failing to warn Kensington Palace in advance that it was to be published,\u201d the source added.\n\nSamir Hussein via Getty Images The Duke and Duchess of Sussex attend the European premiere of \"The Lion King\" at Leicester Square on July 14 in London.\n\nWhile a spokesperson for the Duke of Sussex said that he welcomed the letter from the BBC, the royal still didn\u2019t feel that the image was needed for the on-air segment as it \u201ccaused his family great distress specifically while his wife was nearly five months pregnant.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis Royal Highness raised the issue with Ofcom about the rebroadcasting of this racist image due to his concerns that hateful and dangerous propaganda had been spread globally by the world\u2019s most important public service broadcaster,\u201d the royal\u2019s spokesperson said in a statement to The Guardian in an article published Wednesday.\n\n\u201cDue to the credibility of the BBC, their choice to publicise this material created an open door for all other media to reproduce it.\u201d\n\nHarry and Meghan have repeatedly dealt with racist trolls, media commentary and news segments throughout their entire relationship. Recently, the duchess was the subject of a sexist and racist hit piece produced by \u201c60 Minutes Australia\u201d that purported to investigate why \u201cMeghan Markle lost her sparkle.\u201d\n\nA tweet about the segment sparked immediately backlash online.\n\n\u201cFrom adored to insufferable in less than a year.
