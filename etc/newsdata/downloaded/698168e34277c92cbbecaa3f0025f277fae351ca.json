Commanders sent 42 officers in five trucks.\n\nIt wasn't enough. More than 30 suspected drug cartel gunmen were waiting for them Monday, some in vehicles that were apparently armored, prosecutors in Mexico's western state of Michoacan said.\n\nOfficials said the gunmen opened up on the police convoy with .50 caliber sniper rifles and AR-15 and AK-47 assault rifles.\n\nThirteen officers were killed, some of their bodies still inside the patrol trucks when the vehicles were set afire. Nine other officers were wounded.\n\nThe attack \u2013 the worst on Mexican law enforcement in years \u2013 came in a state where violence blamed on drug gangs has jumped in recent months.\n\nThe cap of a Michoacan state police officer lies in the brush where charred police trucks stand on the roadside after its police officer occupants were attacked in El Aguaje, Mexico, Monday, Oct. 14, 2019.

Silvano Aureoles said.\n\nImages published in Mexican media showed vehicles burning in the middle of a highway and messages apparently signed by Jalisco New Generation, one of Mexico's most powerful and rising cartels. Aureoles said their authenticity was under investigation.\n\nLater in the day, an Associated Press journalist saw two gutted patrol cars at the entrance to El Aguaje surrounded by hundreds of bullet casings.

Later, an area roughly 45 miles north of Aguililla was the scene of fierce clashes between members of Jalisco New Generation and regional self-defense groups.\n\nA charred truck that belongs to Michoacan state police sits on the side of the road after it was burned during an attack, as state police drive past in El Aguaje, Mexico, Monday, Oct. 14, 2019.

They said they took up arms to defend themselves from kidnappings, extortion and killings by cartels. But some of the self-defense or vigilante groups later became infiltrated by cartels and gangs.\n\nThe government of former President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto launched a process to disarm and legalize the vigilante groups and incorporate them into official security forces.\n\nAureoles, the governor, says the self-defense groups haven't returned and has criticized federal authorities for not attacking drug cartels in Michoacan with sufficient force and for negotiating with vigilante groups he refers to as criminals.\n\nBesides avocado orchards, Michoacan for decades has been known for marijuana plantations and the making of methamphetamine. It is home to the port of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, a key entry point for precursor chemicals used to make synthetic drugs.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/10/15/aguililla-michoacan-13-officers-killed-ambush-mexico-police/3983988002/", "description": "Commanders sent 42 officers in five trucks  to serve a single warrant in Aguililla.
