While attending a Pandora event with her husband, Kane Vato (left), in Sydney on Thursday, Pia Muehlenbeck (right) displayed noticeably puffy features\n\nHer face seemed rather 'overcrowded', perhaps as a result of too much filler, as she posed alongside her spouse.\n\nShe displayed remarkably plump lips and cheeks, and looked hardly recognisable compared to photos from her early modelling career.\n\nIn her early twenties, Pia was a model for stock photo agency Shutterstock and dozens of images exist of her from before she went 'under the needle'.\n\nEvolving look: Her face seemed rather 'overcrowded', perhaps as a result of too much filler. Pictured left: Pia in her early twenties\n\nCosmetic surgeon Dr Jeremy Hunt shared his professional thoughts on Pia's changing looks in an interview with Daily Mail Australia last year.\n\n'Her appearance is highly suggestive of rhinoplasty, as the nasal bones in the upper part of the nose are narrowed,' observed Dr Hunt.\n\n'The tip of her nose appears smaller and the bridge seems narrower.'\n\nA rhinoplasty would have cost Pia around $15,000.\n\nTransformed! Cosmetic surgeon Dr Jeremy Hunt shared his professional thoughts on Pia's changing looks in an interview with Daily Mail Australia last year. Pictured left: Pia in her early twenties, and right: at Coachella earlier this year\n\nDr Hunt added that Pia appears to have had fillers in both her upper and lower lip, both of which look fuller compared to older photos.\n\n'The natural proportion of the lips has been lost and the upper lip is too large compared to the lower lip, resulting in the \"trout pout\",' he said.\n\nThis non-surgical procedure would have likely cost around $1,000.\n\nPia may have also had fillers in her cheeks, a procedure that costs approximately $2,000 and requires two days of recovery time.\n\nBefore and after: 'Her appearance is highly suggestive of rhinoplasty, as the nasal bones in the upper part of the nose are narrowed,' said Dr Hunt\n\nHer breast assets? Dr Hunt also weighed in on Pia's large, spherical breasts, saying that he believes she may have had surgical implants\n\nDr Hunt went on to say that Pia's changing face shape may be the result of a Buccal fat pad removal, which costs around $5,000.\n\n'The lower cheek is hollower with less volume, leading to a more heart-shaped face,' the celebrity surgeon claimed.\n\nDr Hunt also weighed in on Pia's large, spherical breasts, saying that he believes she may have had surgical implants.\n\n'[Her breasts] keep getting bigger,' he said, adding that a breast augmentation of this type would have cost around $15,000.\n\nA revision breast augmentation would also have cost an additional $15,000.", "description": "While attending a Pandora event with her husband, Kane Vato, in Sydney on Thursday,\u00a0Pia displayed noticeably puffy features", "authors": ["Alisha Buaya", "Monique Friedlander For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/03/20162854-0-image-a-86_1571970996094.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
