It said last year it had already eliminated as much as 280,000 tonnes of annual ozone-depleting substance (ODS) manufacturing capacity.\n\nChinese authorities had responded to the global rise in CFC-11 this year by carrying out more \u201cspecial enforcement actions\u201d to crack down on illegal production, Environment minister Li Ganjie said at an event to mark the International Day for the Preservation of the Ozone Layer on Monday.\n\nProducers of carbon tetrachloride, a key ingredient of CFC-11, have also been put under 24-hour supervision, he said.\n\nLi said the next phase in the implementation of the Montreal Protocol - which calls on countries to speed up the elimination of hydrochlorofluorocarbons, another group of ozone-depleting compounds - would bring \u201cnew challenges\u201d to China.\n\nLi said the government would improve its policies and strengthen supervision and management in order to \u201cresolutely fulfill its commitments\u201d. He said it would also work with international partners to help improve regulation and develop alternative products and technologies.", "description": "China faces \"new challenges\" when it comes to cracking down on the production of chemicals that deplete the ozone layer, the country's environment minister said, adding Beijing has shown \"zero tolerance\" to violators.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
