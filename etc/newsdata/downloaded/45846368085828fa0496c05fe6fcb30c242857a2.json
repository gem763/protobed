Gavin Newsom lashed out at PG&E for its \u201cgreed\u201d while praising firefighters and city officials for their coordinated response and preparation, vowing that the cycle of blackouts, wildfires and evacuations plaguing the state was not \u201cthe new normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not even close to where we need to be in this state,\u201d Mr. Newsom said at a press conference in Los Angeles with Mayor Eric Garcetti.\n\n\u201cThis is not the new normal, and it doesn\u2019t take a decade to fix this damn thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re getting serious about forest management, vegetation management, we\u2019re getting serious about prepositioning, and we\u2019re putting a historic amount of money into new suppression technology.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic governor also offered praise for the Trump administration\u2019s assistance in battling California\u2019s seven active wildfires.\n\n\u201cI want to make this point as well: FEMA has been extraordinary,\u201d Mr. Newsom said. \u201c[The] Trump administration has been extraordinarily supportive and helpful. Every request we have made has been granted, and that support has come in real time and the cooperation and collaboration has continued.\u201d\n\nThe National Weather Service posted Tuesday red-flag warnings for 43 California counties, driven by a combination of low humidity, high winds and thick, dry vegetation, meaning more blackouts and evacuations are likely as the winds stoke the current fires and whip up new blazes.\n\nMr. Garcetti said 12 homes in the Los Angeles hills have been lost in the 656-acre Getty fire, which was 15% contained.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re prepared to fight more than a one-front war,\u201d Mr. Garcetti said. \u201cWe have poured so much into this over the last day and a half precisely because we know that when that wind picks up, fires can start in other parts of the city.\u201d\n\nHe urged residents to assist neighbors under evacuation orders \u2014 NBA superstar LeBron James was among those evacuated on Monday \u2014 in anticipation of \u201cthe most significant wind event of Los Angeles of the year,\u201d with gusts expected to peak at 3 a.m. Wednesday but continue until Thursday.\n\n\u201cIf you know somebody\u2019s who affected, make sure they have a place to stay,\u201d Mr. Garcetti said. \u201cOpen up your home. We\u2019ve had so many people do that. It\u2019s been beautiful to see.\u201d\n\nIn Northern California, dozens of structures, including a Sonoma County winery, have been destroyed as millions of residents face more power outages, driven by PG&E\u2019s efforts to avoid having its transmission lines spark more wildfires.\n\nPG&E declared bankruptcy after the 2018 Camp Fire, the deadliest and most expensive wildfire in state history, which was caused by a faulty transmission line. The utility has since ordered blackouts on especially dry and windy days to avoid sparking blazes in and near Northern California\u2019s overgrown woodlands.\n\nMr. Newsom called on the state\u2019s three big investor-owned utilities to \u201cdo the damn work that is long overdue to focus on modernizing their grid, undergrounding their grid, and making sure they have a grid where they can target these blackouts in a more sophisticated manner.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAnd we\u2019re not in a position of reacting to these fires and dealing with their mess.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
