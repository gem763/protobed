I want to start by saying that i love And respect @drzeusworld paaji immensely and he knows it. He has the right to get angry with me because he\u2019s my senior and ive learnt a lot from him. And he is the last person id want to go through something like this. I got on the song, which has been recreated by my dear friends Sachin Jigar, only after making sure we had the necessary rights. But still if there\u2019s any misunderstanding, ill make sure it gets cleared asap. I support Zeus Paaji.\u201d\n\nDr Zeus then confirmed that he had a telephonic conversation with Badshah and said that he has been his fan too.
