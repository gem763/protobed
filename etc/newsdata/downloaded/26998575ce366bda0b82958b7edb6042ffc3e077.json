His then girlfriend, Margaret Moore, was left with bruising to her forehead and black eyes.\n\nA French court fined him \u00a35,000 and handed down a three-month suspended jail sentence. He has always denied the charge, maintaining her injuries were sustained in an accidental fall. At his trial, the public prosecutor Jean-Yves Duval rejected this claim, saying the injuries were \u201cabsolutely incompatible\u201d with an accident.\n\nClaire said: \u201cCelebrating a man who was convicted for assaulting his partner sends a dangerous message that domestic abuse is not taken seriously as a crime.\n\n\u201cWith increasing awareness of domestic abuse, and a domestic abuse bill ready to be taken forward by government, it is extremely disappointing that a knighthood has been recommended for Geoffrey Boycott, who is a convicted perpetrator of domestic abuse.\u201d\n\nMay, who introduced a landmark domestic abuse bill to parliament earlier this year, gave Boycott a knighthood for services to sport.\n\nA spokeswoman from the Woman\u2019s Trust said: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing to see Geoffrey Boycott included in Theresa May\u2019s honours list, given her vocal support for domestic abuse survivors and the domestic abuse bill.\u201d\n\nIn an extraordinary exchange, Kearney asked why Boycott had not been given the honour sooner, and suggested one reason could be the conviction. The former cricketer proclaimed his innocence and cited the conviction as a reason for his outspoken support for Brexit.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Boycott made the comments while speaking to Martha Kearney on the BBC\u2019s Today programme.

In France, as in Britain, defendants are presumed to be innocent until proven guilty.\n\nHe said: \u201cTwenty-five years ago, love. In a French court, she [Moore] tried to blackmail me for \u00a31m. I said no, because in England if you pay any money at all, we think: \u2018Hang on, there must be something there.\u2019 I said: \u2018I\u2019m not paying anything\u2019 \u2026 I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d actually got a million at the time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a court case in France where you\u2019re guilty, which is one of the reasons I [didn\u2019t] vote to remain in Europe \u2013 because you\u2019re guilty until you\u2019re proved innocent. That\u2019s totally the opposite from England and it\u2019s very difficult to prove you\u2019re innocent in another country and another language.\n\n\u201cMost people in England don\u2019t believe it. I didn\u2019t do it. Move on. It\u2019s a cross I have to bear, right or wrong, good or bad, I have to live with it. And I do, because I\u2019m clear in my mind and I think most people in England are that it\u2019s not true.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care a toss about her, love. It was 25 years ago. You can take your political nature and do whatever you want with it. You want to talk to me about my knighthood. It\u2019s very nice of you to have me, but I couldn\u2019t give a toss.\n\n\u201cThis is just recognition of my cricket. [It\u2019s] very nice, very honoured, thankful to Theresa May and I thank all the people that supported me and cared for me throughout my cricketing career.\u201d\n\nIn response to Boycott\u2019s comments disputing the conviction, Claire told the BBC\u2019s Victoria Derbyshire programme that the knighthood should be withdrawn, describing it as a \u201ctragedy\u201d that sends \u201ca really terrible message to survivors\u201d. She added: \u201cI believe [the knighthood] should be taken away, absolutely\u201d.\n\nShe also spoke to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Woman\u2019s Hour, where she expressed her disappointment in May, describing Boycott\u2019s honour as a \u201cmisstep\u201d that undermined her record for tackling domestic abuse.\n\nShe said women were in limbo as they waited to hear whether Johnson\u2019s government would continue to move May\u2019s legislation forward.\n\nDawn Butler, the shadow women and equalities secretary, said the honour was \u201can insult to victims and survivors of domestic violence.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cHonouring a perpetrator of domestic violence just because he is the former prime minister\u2019s favourite sportsman shows how out of touch and nepotistic the honours list is.\n\n\u201cBoris Johnson should rescind his knighthood today. The whole honours system needs radically overhauling, alongside peerages, so that our political system works for the many not the few.\u201d\n\nDavid Challen, a domestic violence campaigner added his voice to those calling for the knighthood to be rescinded. Challen, whose mother, Sally Challen was recently freed from prison after killing her husband following decades of abuse, tweeted:\n\nDavid Challen (@David_Challen) The absolute state of our society for knighting a man who has a conviction for domestic abuse and shows no remorse.\n\n\n\nEven Boycott\u2019s reply to @Marthakearney in response to the @womensaid\u2019s concerns was sexist bile:\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t give a toss about her, love.\u201d\n\n\n\nRevoke his knighthood now https://t.co/naRxW4rwpn\n\nReacting to Boycott\u2019s radio appearance, the Women\u2019s Equality party called for a \u201cBoycott boycott\u201d. The party\u2019s leader, Mandu Reid, said: \u201cThe contempt shown by Boycott on the Today programme this morning highlights precisely why he shouldn\u2019t be celebrated by the British establishment or anyone, and why he shouldn\u2019t be given airtime by the media. Putting men like him on a pedestal is indefensible and sends a message that violence is normal and acceptable.\u201d\n\nThe Yorkshire-born former Spice Girl Melanie Brown, who has accused her ex-husband Stephen Belafonte of domestic abuse, also criticised the decision, saying Boycott was \u201ca disgrace to Yorkshire\u201d. The shadow policing minister, Louise Haigh, who is the MP for Sheffield Heeley, labelled the BBC pundit \u201can embarrassment to Yorkshire\u201d in a tweet.\n\nBoycott was forced to apologise in 2017 for suggesting he would have to black up to be awarded a knighthood. He is alleged to have said the honour was handed out like \u201cconfetti\u201d to West Indies cricketers, saying: \u201cMine\u2019s been turned down twice. I\u2019d better black me face.\u201d\n\nAn estimated 1.3 million women and 695,000 men experienced domestic abuse in the year ending March 2018, according to Office for National Statistics figures from November 2018.", "description": "Charities and opposition parties highlight ex-cricketer\u2019s conviction for domestic abuse", "authors": ["Maya Wolfe-Robinson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18611d64dc8c36464562603a6acb96f564a139c8/0_453_2333_1399/master/2333.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8b49ec65aa4ded3494e029a5d8f0482a", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
