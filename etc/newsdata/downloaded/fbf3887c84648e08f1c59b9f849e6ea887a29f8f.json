I get more and more depressed. I never had these feelings before. I cry a lot,\" she said.\n\n\u201cEverybody sees me joyful, winning medals, being strong, but they don\u2019t see the other side. That is why every Paralympian is, to me, a champion.\u201d\n\nShe talked of struggling to sleep, sometimes getting only 10 minutes a night. \u201cI can\u2019t sleep at night. My psychologist knows it. I want her to be with me when I die. She works at the hospital but even she says: \u2018It is a lot that you are going through. I have never seen anything like this.\u2019\u201d\n\nVervoort also had epileptic seizures and had one in 2014 when she was cooking pasta and spilled boiling water over her legs. That resulted in a four-month hospital stay.\n\nA loyal Labrador named Zenn began staying with her, pawing her when a seizure was about to occur. Zenn also pulled her socks out of the sock drawer, she said, and helped carry groceries home when Vervoort bought too much.\n\n\u201cEverything I drop on the ground, she picks it up and gives it to me,\u201d Vervoort said of the dog. \u201cWhen I lose consciousness, she barks and the nurses come, and she stays licking my face until I come back around. She pulls out my socks, my jacket, opens and closes doors. She will stay with me forever. I could not even imagine giving her away.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of her planned death in 2017, Vervoort said: \u201cThe people will cry, but I want them also to give thanks for the life I had, for the fact that I\u2019m happy now I\u2019m at peace.\u201d", "description": "Belgian Paralympian Marieke Vervoort, the T52 100m champion from the 2012 London Games has died by euthanasia at the age of 40, Belgian media reported on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Telegraph Sport"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XGy4pAbIsMXA_tbk.gmwww--~B/aD0xNTYzO3c9MjUwMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/0916bf06349a67b41d8b62fa4de0d3d8", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
