After a few more attempts\u2014and three hours of waiting in line wasted\u2014the 46-year-old accountant pulled out of the station with a low tank and no way to get to work.\n\n\u201cThe attendant asked me to pay cash, which I didn\u2019t have,\u201d said Mr. Hwamiridza, shaking his head. \u201cThis country has gone to the dogs.\u201d\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Have you ever been stranded without access to cash? Share your stories with us below.\n\nMore than most other places in the world, this southern African nation with a long history of monetary dysfunction has staked its financial system on mobile money, which allows funds to change hands through the touch of a few buttons on an old-school cellphone or through a smartphone app.\n\nBut now, amid power cuts lasting for up to 17 hours a day, EcoCash breaks down frequently. The outages are blocking everyday economic activity and exacerbating a financial crisis that has left Zimbabwe\u2019s government bankrupt and some five million people, about a third of its population, in need of food aid.\n\nEight out of 10 transactions in Zimbabwe\u2014from buying milk to filling up a car or settling a utility bill\u2014are done via cellphones, almost exclusively on EcoCash.\n\n\u201cIf you are relying on one payment platform, the whole country comes to a hold\u201d when it breaks down, said Evonia Muzondo, senior research analyst with Harare-based brokerage firm Imara Edwards Securities. Government and regulators \u201cshouldn\u2019t have allowed it to come to this point at all,\u201d she added.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Have you ever been stranded without access to cash? Join the conversation below.\n\nEcoCash is operated by local telecommunications platform Econet Wireless , which has said that EcoCash\u2019s troubles, and wider disruptions of its network, are due to the power cuts implemented by Zimbabwe\u2019s state utility, which on many days provides electricity only between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. The company said 1,300 of its base stations are running on diesel generators, an unsustainable practice with the cost of fuel having risen around sevenfold this year.\n\nIt says it needs $600 million to upgrade to solar power generation and warned that it might have to take unspecified \u201cdrastic measures\u201d should the government fail to resolve the power cuts quickly.\n\nA vendor makes a transaction on his mobile phone while selling cash. With cash in short supply, EcoCash kept the economy ticking, facilitating digital payments for even small transactions.

The heading: \u201cWhat you feel, we feel it too. It\u2019s not business as usual.\u201d He didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment and the company declined to comment beyond its public statements.\n\nEcoCash\u2019s dominance is a result of the dramatic mismanagement of Zimbabwe\u2019s currency, which has its roots in the final days of longtime President Robert Mugabe in 2017. Short on U.S. dollars\u2014the country\u2019s official currency following devastating hyperinflation in the early 2000s\u2014the government once again resorted to printing money to cover salaries and other costs, this time by issuing Zimbabwean treasury bills to its banks.\n\nThe result was a steep devaluation of \u201cdigital\u201d dollars in people\u2019s banks accounts, compared with U.S. dollars, which were nearly impossible to get on the formal market. With cash dollars in short supply, EcoCash kept the economy ticking, facilitating digital payments for even small transactions in a country where few people own credit or debit cards.\n\nIn February, the central bank abandoned its dollar peg, effectively reintroducing a national currency, although there are only a limited number of Zimbabwean bills and coins in circulation.\n\n\u201cWe are more or less a cashless economy,\u201d said Ashok Chakravarti, an economist based in Harare who believes that the EcoCash outages will hurt Zimbabwe\u2019s gross domestic product, which the International Monetary Fund expects to shrink by 5.2% this year.\n\nA government austerity program and limits on issuing T-bills haven\u2019t stopped the new Zimbabwean dollar from losing value. Inflation spiked to 176% in June. Last month, the finance minister announced Zimbabwe\u2019s statistics agency would stop publishing annual inflation data until February, saying it was distorted by the reintroduction of a local currency.\n\nFew people have trust in the ability and willingness of Mr. Mugabe\u2019s successor, President Emmerson Mnangagwa, to overhaul the country. In recent weeks, security forces have beaten up protesters and arrested opposition and union activists. Several government critics say they have been abducted and tortured, allegations that officials have dismissed as fake news.\n\nAmid the crackdown, Zimbabwe has failed to secure funds to pay overdue loans from the World Bank and other multilateral financial institutions, disqualifying it from getting an IMF bailout to cushion government cutbacks.\n\nMr. Mnangagwa and his finance minister, Mthuli Ncube, have said the reintroduction of a local currency is a painful but necessary step to restore the economy. They are blaming the power cuts on a drought that has ravaged parts of the country and left its hydroelectric power stations with too little water to generate enough electricity.\n\nMunicipal water systems have broken down, partly because the power cuts have idled pumps, and many Zimbabweans are now fetching waters from public wells. Some factories and businesses have moved to night shifts to take advantage of the times when there is electricity.\n\nThe EcoCash outages are adding to the struggles. With more businesses demanding cash payments, funds stored in EcoCash\u2019s \u201cmobile wallets\u201d have started losing value. Black-market traders are now charging premiums of up to 40% for exchanging EcoCash for actual cash. Last week, EcoCash said it has suspended more than 1,000 of its sales agents for demanding extra payments in return for cash.\n\n\u201cEcoCash is what everyone is using,\u201d said a woman, who identified herself as Mbuya va Rosy, or Rosy\u2019s Grandma in the local Shona language. She was one of several women trying to sell vegetables, candy and cigarettes on the side of the road, not far from the station where Mr. Hwamiridza unsuccessfully tried to buy gas. On days where EcoCash isn\u2019t functioning, Mbuya va Rosy said she is struggling to feed her family.\n\nOn a Friday evening, Noel Sibanda, a 28-year-old salesman at a body shop, was in a Harare pub, hoping to while away the hours until electricity returned at home. But with EcoCash once again down, his nighttime beer proved elusive.\n\n\u201cWe now fetch water from wells and spend long hours in darkness,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel as if Harare is turning out to be a rural village.\u201d\n\nWrite to Gabriele Steinhauser at gabriele.steinhauser@wsj.com", "description": "Ecocash, the cellphone platform used for eight out of 10 transactions in Zimbabwe, regularly breaks down, making buying milk, filling up a car or settling a utility bill a test of endurance. \u201cThis country has gone to the dogs,\u201d complains one man after a three-hour attempt to buy gas.", "authors": ["Bernard Mpofu", "Gabriele Steinhauser", "Gabriele.Steinhauser Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-102707/social"}
