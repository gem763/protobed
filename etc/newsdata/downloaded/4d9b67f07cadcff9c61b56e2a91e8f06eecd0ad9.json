But her decades-long phony insistence on Cherokee identity, which is to identity politics what stolen valor is to military service, is just part of her oleaginous, changeling habit of cycling through one persona after another. She\u2019s Chief Spitting Bull, the lady with a J.D. in B.S.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhether she\u2019s claiming her white parents had to elope because of racism or, five years after the matter was litigated, falsely asserting that Michael Brown \u201cwas murdered\u201d in Ferguson, Mo., or stating she was the \u201cfirst nursing mother to take a bar exam in the state of New Jersey,\u201d as though anyone kept tabs on such strange details (\u201cExcuse me, madam, are you lactating at the moment? I\u2019m making a record book\u201d), Elizabeth Warren is always ready with a load of bull. Warren will say whatever is convenient for her ambitions of the moment. \u201cI am not running for president of the United States,\u201d Senator Warren said last March on Meet the Press. \u201cI am running for the United States Senate in 2018 in Massachusetts.\u201d The month after she was reelected she announced she was forming an exploratory committee to mull a presidential run.\n\nAnd note the false, strained way she did get in the presidential race, in that infamous video. She starts recording. Then \u2014 hello, soon-to-be-conquered Earth people, I understand you like brewed malt beverages on this planet \u2014 she immediately takes a break to get a beer. Her programmers in the Nebula 235X star system have told her that ordinary Earthfolk are intimidated by proper grammar, so she phrases this entirely natural and spontaneous decision like this: \u201cHold on a sec, I\u2019m gonna get me, uh, a beer.\u201d Then she follows up with this classic: \u201cHey! My husband Bruce is now in here!\u201d Her husband was in her house? Where does she normally keep him, in the shed with the lawnmower? Warren isn\u2019t just phony, she\u2019s creepy and alien and able to change form to play on your nightmares: She\u2019s It of the Charles. Occasionally she lets the mask slip, as when, in Greenwich Village, she positioned herself as the candidate opposed to half the population. \u201cWe\u2019re not here today because of famous arches or famous men,\u201d she said. \u201cIn fact, we\u2019re not here because of men at all.\u201d Huh? Warren must be the first candidate in history to think that winning the working class means deriding the sex that does most of the grunt labor in this country. Should she make it to the general election, and advisers somberly inform her that she is losing the men\u2019s vote by 97 points and that all of her male supporters wear Capris and live in Brooklyn, I wonder what her Dukakis-in-a-tank response will be. My guess is it\u2019ll involve a misbegotten attempt to imbibe tequila during a show at Bada Bing\u2019s, where she somehow mispronounces the word \u201cbro.\u201d Someone will ask who her favorite member of the New England Patriots is and she\u2019ll say something like \u201cEli Kaepernick.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlien programmers who misunderstand Earth energy have instructed her to give her rallies a \u201cdeli scene from When Harry Met Sally\u201d vibe, which plays a bit strangely in a septuagenarian Harvard Law professor. \u201cThe candidate,\u201d noted The New Yorker, \u201cmay take the stage at a run; at intervals during her speech, she will clench a fist, thrust it skyward, and cry out, \u2018Yes!\u2019\u201d Amid the self-celebration, she claims pernicious forces fought her at every step. \u201cPeople told me you can\u2019t win,\u201d she recalled at a town hall in Council Bluffs, Iowa. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t win because Massachusetts is not going to elect a woman to the Senate or the governor\u2019s office.\u201d As with New Jersey\u2019s record-keeping about nursing moms taking the bar exam, I suspect proof of this statement will prove elusive to locate. I had to rise above all those nasty retrograde misogynistic troglodytes of er, Massachusetts . . .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWarren is a proud representative of an industry that is to B.S. what France is to wine. She comes from a world \u2014 academia \u2014 where stealing a paragraph of boilerplate is a career-ending crime but stealing an identity from historically oppressed people is merely a canny way to play the angles. Not that she isn\u2019t also guilty of plagiarism \u2014 recall that she copied a recipe from the New York Times news service for a 1984 cookbook called \u201cPow Wow Chow\u201d and signed it as \u201cElizabeth Warren \u2014 Cherokee.\u201d That a woman who is so white she is practically fluorescent would claim to be of color was the logical endpoint of a career spent trying on various identities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven her surname is merely an identity she picked up along the way; her maiden name is \u201cHerring\u201d and her current husband\u2019s name is \u201cMann.\u201d Jim Warren is the man she was married to in the Seventies. She married Bruce Mann six months after their divorce came through and, typically, lied about this. \u201cI was a single mom with two little kids, and I\u2019d just started teaching law in Houston,\u201d she said in a 2015 Facebook post. \u201cAnd then I met a guy from Massachusetts named Bruce. I was completely crazy about him, and I still am. When I proposed to him, he said yes.\u201d She may have felt like a single mom just as she may have felt Cherokee, but the facts are otherwise. She was still married to Jim Warren and had not yet filed for divorce. She and Jim more or less invented conscious uncoupling, wafting gently away from each other without so much as a cross word. She later said, \u201cWe never really fought and never really had hard words; it just didn\u2019t work.\u201d Jim Warren won\u2019t be offering his version of events, as he died in 2003. In her early days with Mann, he lived in St. Louis while she was teaching in Texas, which looks like very early foreshadowing of how close American men in general are going to want to get to her. Warren describes him as \u201cmy sweetie.\u201d \u201cI found my sweetie,\u201d she told Politico and, in another instance of failed programming by her alien masters from a distant galaxy, added, \u201cThat should be a good country-western song don\u2019t you think? \u2018I Found My Sweetie at Law and Economics Camp.\u2019\u201d Warren\u2019s efforts to seem like a normal Earthling come across like C-3PO trying to convince us he\u2019s chill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring her early years in law, Warren was a deregulator\u2019s dream girl, a shameless shill for big business, practically an NR columnist. The Warren of 1980 struck a Thatcherite tone. A stirring paper she wrote that year on utility regulation has proved enduring (it was cited approvingly as recently as 2006, by the Texas Court of Appeals). She derided consumer advocates for making \u201cfallacious\u201d arguments based on \u201cunscrutinized . . . conventional wisdom.\u201d In Politico one expert called it \u201csuch a pro-utility paper\u201d that \u201cit\u2019s, like, awesome. If you\u2019re a utility, you love that thing.\u201d Rarely is she questioned on such youthful and even middle-aged-ful indiscretions, but when Politico asked her about them she offered this word salad: \u201cI followed theory and tried my hand at what all academics did then in our field, and that was theory. I pretty quickly discovered not only that the theory was wrong, but it was deeply misleading.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, it wasn\u2019t so quick as all that. Friends say she was a \u201cdiehard conservative\u201d for many years and she concedes that she was a registered Republican for most of her life. She didn\u2019t register as a Democrat until, perhaps, 1996, when she was 47. As late as 2003 she was rejecting a \u201cquasi-socialist safety net to rival the European model\u201d in her book The Two-Income Trap. That was in her Aughties guise as a Suze Orman wannabe. Her other book from the period, All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan, advised readers to spend within their means, creating a 50-30-20 template: 50 percent of disposable income for needs, 30 percent for wants, 20 percent for savings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThese days she is advising people not to live within their means at all and blaming their debts on a conspiracy theory about how government and plutocrats are cheating us. \u201cThese aren\u2019t cracks that families are falling into, they\u2019re traps,\u201d she says in a campaign video. \u201cAmerica\u2019s middle class is under attack. How did we get here? Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie. And they enlisted politicians to cut \u2019em a fatter slice.\u201d It\u2019s the old Democratic-party story \u2014 be angry about your tax cuts because rich people have also gotten tax cuts, never mind the tax increases that might accompany $32 trillion of Medicare for All spending. By way of funding, Ms. \u201cI Have a Plan\u201d\u2122 mentions only a few taxes on the rich that might yield $3 trillion or so. This reminds me of my plan for dating Nicole Kidman: First, I\u2019m going to find out where she lives. Second, I\u2019m going to go to her house. Third, hey, I\u2019m a wonk, I won\u2019t bore you with the details, but I have a plan. Also, I\u2019m not Donald Trump, did I mention that? (Bows for applause.)\n\nLess than a year ago Warren, heeding typically bizarre advice from Nebula 235X, said \u201cI think I\u2019ll take me a DNA test.\u201d This demonstrated that her ancestry was between 1/64th and 1/1024th Indian. That\u2019s at most 1.6 percent. So Elizabeth Warren is at least 98.4 percent not Cherokee. She claims she never used this lie to her advantage, but that\u2019s preposterous. Harvard Law School certainly didn\u2019t look at her polar-ice-cap coloring and think, \u201cAh, there\u2019s the woman of color we need!\u201d Nor does Harvard Law School often hire graduates of the Rutgers University\u2013Newark law school. We know that she claimed to be American Indian as far back as that 1984 cookbook and her 1986 Texas bar license, and that Harvard Law School boasted that she was the first woman of color on its faculty. How was Harvard supposed to have gotten this information if not from Elizabeth \u201cPow Wow Chow\u201d Warren? Warren not only stole her identity from the Cherokee but did so from the brazen position of someone who is really exceptionally white. I suppose that means her life story is just a white lie.\n\nThis article appears as \u201cThe Cherokee from Outer Space\u201d in the October 14, 2019, print edition of National Review.", "description": "Conservative; liberal; white; Cherokee; Harvard prof; tribune of the people; possibly extraterrestrial.", "authors": ["Kyle Smith", "Kevin D.
