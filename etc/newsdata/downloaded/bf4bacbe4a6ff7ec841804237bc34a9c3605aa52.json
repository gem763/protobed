Gold weighs more than that, for God\u2019s sake,\u2019 laughed the famous car-maker, delightedly.\n\nHe was toasting their success in the $24 million criminal enterprise \u2014 money he said he would use to shore up his floundering car business \u2014 when agents burst in. They slapped cuffs on his hands, which, moments earlier, had been holding a celebratory glass of champagne.\n\nIt was October 1982, and DeLorean, a suave, 57-year-old American entrepreneur with film-star looks and a genius for self-promotion, was witnessing the death of his dreams.\n\nOn the same day, the Thatcher Government finally called time on his Belfast car plant after the British taxpayer had thrown tens of millions of pounds into keeping it going.\n\nDeLorean's wife stuck by him during his trial but, discovering during it that he had lied to her, she left him as soon as it was over. The pair are pictured above. As secretly shot video footage would later show, the FBI sting on John DeLorean perfectly captured how a supremely cunning man could be blinded by greed\n\nClad in stainless steel and featuring gullwing doors, his sci fi-looking DMC-12 appeared as if it could fly, but became one of the biggest jokes in manufacturing history.\n\nAnyone who knew of its miserable story would have sniggered when it turned up as Marty McFly\u2019s time-travelling car in the Back To The Future movies (it was chosen because the film-makers wanted a car that looked like an alien spaceship.\n\nNow, new film Driven is going back in time to tell the tale of DeLorean and how the Machiavellian crook\u2019s grand plan to build an \u2018ethical\u2019 sports car in Northern Ireland ended in drug-trafficking charges and disgrace.\n\nBizarrely, after several failed attempts to bring the story to the screen, two DeLorean films have come out within months of each other (Alec Baldwin played him in the docu-drama Framing John DeLorean in July).\n\nDriven \u2014 an entertaining, if only loosely factual, comedy-drama directed by Belfast-born British director Nick Hamm and written by Ulsterman Colin Bateman \u2014 is set in southern California.\n\nIt was there that DeLorean (played by Lee Pace) became fatefully acquainted with a neighbour, Jim Hoffman (Jason Sudeikis), a pilot with a criminal past who was, in fact, an FBI informant.\n\nThe film, released in the UK next month, had to imagine much of their unlikely relationship, as DeLorean died in 2005, while Hoffman has for decades lived in anonymity under the U.S. Government\u2019s witness protection scheme.\n\nHoffman was almost certainly not DeLorean\u2019s bosom buddy, as portrayed in Driven. They were neighbours only briefly, and DeLorean insisted that they had spoken once before Hoffman phoned him just a month before the FBI sting.\n\nAnyone who knew of its miserable story would have sniggered when it turned up as Marty McFly\u2019s time-travelling car in the Back To The Future movies (it was chosen because the film-makers wanted a car that looked like an alien spaceship\n\nEach man claimed it was the other who first suggested DeLorean should get involved in cocaine smuggling \u2014 a vital point, since the answer might indicate whether he could argue that he was entrapped.\n\nHoffman claimed in court that DeLorean told him he hoped that by investing $2 million with Hoffman\u2019s drug-trafficking contacts, he could make up to $50 million.\n\nBut, even without either\u2019s input, the film-makers hardly needed to embellish a Hollywood-ready saga of drugs, sports cars, beautiful women, terrorists, multi-million-pound theft and Margaret Thatcher.\n\nJohn DeLorean was as eye- catching as his car \u2014 a 6ft 4in, languid smoothie with a mane of silver hair. He was so vain he had a chin implant and a facelift.\n\nThe son of a Ford foundry worker, Detroit-born DeLorean was a brilliant engineer who had a starry career in the U.S. automobile industry before he walked out of General Motors to set up on his own.\n\nAn egotistical narcissist whose beads, jewellery and long hair flouted the dress code of the conservative GM, he wanted to build his own cars.\n\nFew worried about their public image as much as DeLorean. The playboy car designer befriended celebrities and went out with Hollywood stars including Candice Bergen, Ursula Andress and Frank Sinatra\u2019s daughter Tina.\n\nHe was impossibly smug. \u2018I\u2019ve got a reasonably strong sex drive. No man who ever accomplished something didn\u2019t have that characteristic,\u2019 he once boasted.\n\nHe married four times. His second wife, Kelly, aged 19 when they wed, was 24 years his junior, so the General Motors press office made her older in its marriage announcement.\n\nWhen they split, he bragged that his Hollywood friends treated him to a \u2018classy\u2019 weekend in Malibu with three young prostitutes who looked like her.\n\nIn 1973, he married model Cristina Ferrare after seeing her in Vogue. She was 25 years younger than him.\n\nDeLorean turned up in Belfast in 1978 to sell Northern Ireland his concept of an \u2018ethical\u2019, long-lasting dream car that would be safe, economical and rustproof. The two-seater had an unpainted stainless steel body and gullwing doors\n\nThey and their two children (one of whom DeLorean had previously adopted) lived on a 440-acre country estate in New Jersey.\n\nDriven portrays DeLorean as a maverick visionary who cuts corners only to save his company and thousands of Northern Irish jobs. That may wash with U.S. audiences but, in Britain \u2014 his chief victim \u2014 he is remembered as a conman.\n\nCristina liked to say that her charismatic husband could walk into a room and talk anybody into anything. He certainly talked Jim Callaghan\u2019s Labour Government into handing over tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money.\n\nDeLorean turned up in Belfast in 1978 to sell Northern Ireland his concept of an \u2018ethical\u2019, long-lasting dream car that would be safe, economical and rustproof. The two-seater had an unpainted stainless steel body and gullwing doors.\n\nDeLorean had an impressive track record in America, celebrity backers including Sammy Davis Jr and chat-show king Johnny Carson, a rock-star image and a highly persuasive manner. He also claimed, wrongly, that he had already secured 30,000 orders for his car in the U.S.\n\nWorried that DeLorean could take his business elsewhere, and keen to reduce the heavy unemployment that fuelled sectarian violence in Ulster, the British Government opened its wallet.\n\nRoy Mason, then Northern Ireland Secretary, injected \u00a354 million \u2014 more than half the total start-up costs \u2014 to help build the world\u2019s most modern car factory in Dunmurry, a suburb of West Belfast with the highest unemployment in Europe. Renault would make the engines, while Lotus Cars, the British sports car manufacturer, would design the chassis and bodywork. The rest of the money came from private U.S. investors.\n\nConcern that the local workforce had never before built high-quality cars was swept aside, as were some people\u2019s misgivings about DeLorean, who\u2019d been investigated at General Motors for allegedly taking bribes.\n\nThe plant would create 2,500 jobs, and Mr Mason fancifully predicted the boost to Ulster\u2019s self-confidence would be a \u2018hammer blow\u2019 to the IRA.\n\nNever modest, DeLorean declared: \u2018I\u2019m starting to think that God stuck me here to be part of the solution to the crisis in Northern Ireland.\u2019\n\nBut nothing about dazzling Mr DeLorean was quite what it seemed. For a start, he was a compulsive liar.\n\nAlthough he liked to say he and his wife lived in a palatial Dunmurry home, he was terrified of being targeted by IRA kidnappers and never stayed a night there. Instead, he would commute from London, where he stayed in top hotels.\n\nAs with a 20-room apartment he rented on Manhattan\u2019s Fifth Avenue, palatial offices in nearby Park Avenue and a small army of servants, the British taxpayer was footing the bill for everything. DeLorean even hired a well-spoken British secretary to put UK officials at ease when they visited him in New York.\n\nCristina liked to say that her charismatic husband could walk into a room and talk anybody into anything. He certainly talked Jim Callaghan\u2019s Labour Government into handing over tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money\n\nDeLorean was secretly seeing a New York psychic, whom he consulted about business, and once paid her a six-figure sum to use her powers to make his wife pregnant.\n\nHis breathless claims to have created the ultimate sports car were also a lot of hot air. It was neither as fuel-efficient nor as safe as he claimed.\n\nThere were production issues with the DMC-12 from the start, as the first cars started coming off the line in 1981.\n\nThe gullwing doors didn\u2019t always work properly \u2014 sometimes trapping people inside \u2014 while the stainless steel exterior showed every fingerprint. Motoring experts complained the car was underpowered and handled badly.\n\nAnother big problem was that the $25,000 car was almost as pricey as a Porsche and had come out during a U.S. recession. By February 1982, when the company was put into receivership by the British Government, more than half of the cars produced remained unsold.\n\nDeLorean\u2019s charm cut little ice with Jim Callaghan\u2019s successor, Mrs Thatcher. After giving the firm two further subsidies, she pulled the plug.\n\nHours before DeLorean\u2019s arrest by the FBI in 1982, the Conservative Government announced it was permanently closing the car plant. By then, Britain had sunk \u00a384 million into the project.\n\nBefore his subsequent trial for cocaine trafficking, prosecutors revealed how DeLorean sensationally claimed he had been in cahoots with the IRA in the drugs deal.\n\nThey said he had told undercover agents he had the financial backing and protective muscle of the Provos. The IRA denied this.\n\nDuring DeLorean\u2019s trial, Jim Hoffman said the car designer, desperate for money to keep his company going, had asked him to set up a drug-smuggling deal (in which DeLorean would finance the purchase of 220lb of cocaine in Colombia), after learning that Hoffman had previously flown cocaine shipments into the U.S. from Latin America.\n\nHoffman was working for the FBI, though \u2014 and the bureau, posing as crooked bankers, even lent DeLorean the $2 million he needed to buy the cocaine when he couldn\u2019t raise it himself.\n\nFortunately for DeLorean, the jury accepted the defence claim that he had been entrapped. Acquitted, he avoided prison, but could not escape disgrace and eventual bankruptcy.\n\n\u2018Would you buy a used car from me?\u2019 he quipped presciently as he left court.\n\nAlthough he liked to say he and his wife lived in a palatial Dunmurry home, he was terrified of being targeted by IRA kidnappers and never stayed a night there. Instead, he would commute from London, where he stayed in top hotels\n\nIn the end, no more than 9,000 of his cars were produced, and the entire workforce lost their jobs.\n\nInvestigators found nearly $18 million had gone missing through a secret Panama-registered, Geneva-based firm DeLorean had set up to pay Lotus for its design work.\n\nVirtually none of it was spent on the car; instead, it was shared by DeLorean and the founder of Lotus, Colin Chapman. The latter died in 1982, escaping prosecution.\n\nThe British Government spent ten years trying to sue DeLorean\u2019s auditors but, in 1992, it settled out of court for just \u00a318 million.\n\nA British judge said he would have liked to sentence him to ten years in prison for \u2018barefaced, outrageous and massive fraud\u2019 over stolen UK taxpayers\u2019 money.\n\nHis wife stuck by him during his trial but, discovering during it that he had lied to her, she left him as soon as it was over.\n\nShe became a TV presenter and, in 1993, testified that she\u2019d seen DeLorean practising forging signatures and using a lamp bulb to age documents.\n\nCristina said recently: \u2018He was so charismatic, so worldly, so smart, handsome . . . I was mesmerised by him. I fell deeply in love with him, and I remained so up until the end, when I realised that John couldn\u2019t go from point A to point B in a straight line.\u2019\n\nDeLorean, who never set foot in Britain again, spent the rest of his life in and out of court.\n\nHe married for a fourth time, and claimed to be a born- again Christian.\n\nAnd he blamed everyone but himself for his downfall, even insisting that the British Government had closed the car plant because it believed its Catholic workforce was helping to fund the IRA.\n\nHe declared bankruptcy in 1999 and moved into a one-bedroom flat, where he lived largely off social security.\n\nHe died in 2005 from a stroke, at the age of 80. His Michigan gravestone depicts a DeLorean with its doors invitingly open.\n\nDriven is in cinemas on November 8.", "description": "John DeLorean turned up in Belfast in 1978 to sell Northern Ireland his concept of an 'ethical', long-lasting dream car that would be safe, economical and rustproof.", "authors": ["Tom Leonard For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/21/20153248-0-image-a-30_1571950224700.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
