They said clashes broke out after a fight between students from different schools.\n\nPapua military spokesman Eko Daryanto told news agency AFP the death toll from Monday's violence could rise, saying many civilians had been \"trapped in burning kiosks\".\n\nLocal military commander Chandra Dianto told the news agency that other victims were \"burned... some were hacked to death\".\n\nSome 700 people were brought in for questioning by police but most were released.\n\nMeanwhile in Jayapura, clashes took place between security forces and protesters, with pictures showing scores of police gathered outside a university.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Indonesian riot police were seen outside a university in Jayapura\n\nMr Daryanto told news agency the Associated Press that a mob of students had attacked a soldier and police officers in Jayapura with machetes and rocks.\n\nSecurity forces responded with gunfire, killing three civilians, he told AP. The soldier later died.\n\nWhy is there violence in West Papua?\n\nIt was the taunting of the Papua students that triggered the violence earlier this year, but for many in the region, feelings of resentment towards Indonesia have been simmering for decades.\n\nThe former Dutch colony did not become part of Indonesia until 1963, after a short period under UN control.\n\nA referendum on its independence was held in 1969 but only about 1,000 people were allowed to vote.\n\nAs a result, a low-level separatist movement, fighting for independence, continues to this day.\n\nThe Indonesian military, meanwhile, is accused of gross human rights abuses in their attempt to suppress any form of dissent in the province.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Papuans hold protest in Indonesian capital\n\nAnalysis\n\nBy Jonathan Head, BBC South East Asia correspondent\n\nWhen the 32-year rule of President Suharto came crashing down in Indonesia 21 years ago, there were real fears the country would break up - an Asian Yugoslavia.\n\nAside from the former Portuguese territory of East Timor, that did not happen, thanks in part to a new democracy, decentralisation and, in some regions, autonomy.\n\nBut the eastern region of Papua remains troubled, and much of its indigenous population unreconciled to Indonesian rule.\n\n\"Indonesia is either the former Dutch East Indies or it is nothing,\" I was told by one government adviser in the perilous days following Suharto's fall. But Papua is a special case.\n\nIt was not incorporated into Indonesia in the decolonisation agreement with the Netherlands in 1949. It was handed over only in 1963, to be approved by a referendum in 1969, the so-called \"Act of Free Choice\", widely accepted now as an Indonesian-manipulated sham.\n\nRemote, undeveloped and largely ignored by the world, Papua's rich resources were crudely exploited by Indonesia, a pro-independence movement was harshly suppressed, and waves of migrants encouraged to move there from other islands.\n\nPapua has enjoyed a form of autonomy since 2001, with other attempts made by successive Indonesian governments to assuage local resentment. But hostility to Indonesian rule runs deep.\n\nWhere is West Papua?\n\nPapua is divided into two provinces, Papua and West Papua - the two regions are collectively referred to as West Papua.\n\nTogether, they make up the western half of the island of New Guinea. The eastern half of the island is comprised of the independent state of Papua New Guinea.", "description": "Some victims were trapped in burning buildings, while others were hacked to death.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/FA16/production/_108922046_gettyimages-1170349137.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
