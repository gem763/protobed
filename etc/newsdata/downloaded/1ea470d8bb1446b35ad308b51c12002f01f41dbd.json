And then what?\u201d\n\nWhat began as a series of marches in Hong Kong against a proposal to allow extraditions to mainland China has grown into a broader challenge to Beijing\u2019s grip on the city. Four months of unrest have brought regular scenes of tear gas, vandalism and transit network disruptions that are beginning to weigh on the financial hub.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s demonstrators have called for an independent inquiry into the violence, an amnesty for those charged during the unrest, rescinding the categorization of participants as \u201crioters\u201d and the ability to nominate and elect their leaders.\n\nLee called for Hong Kongers to solve problems gradually, including respect for the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework, universal suffrage and housing in one of the world\u2019s most expensive markets.\n\nWhy Hong Kong\u2019s Still Protesting and Where It May Go: QuickTake\n\n\u201cAs one Hong Konger put it very neatly, from China\u2019s point of view they must not only think of one country but remember that this is two systems and from Hong Kong\u2019s point of view, you must not only think of two systems, but remember that this is one country,\u201d he said to applause. \u201cAnd that calls for wisdom and constraint on both sides.\u201d\n\nLee also said that Hong Kong would need to find \u201cpolitical courage\u201d to solve its housing problems.\n\n\u201cYou must be prepared to make changes which will have very significant social and economic consequences, and so far the SAR governments have gone for conservative approaches and the problem has not really significantly improved,\u201d he said.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Chief Executive Carrie Lam on Wednesday announced a slew of measures aimed at reducing the cost of living for poorer members of the city, a bid to address some of the underlying economic issues that have helped fuel discontent. She planned to boost compulsory land purchases for housing, relax mortgage rules for first-time home buyers, give cash to students and increase subsidies for low-income families.\n\nSingapore, which competes with Hong Kong as a center of finance in Asia, has faced criticism by human rights groups for taking a heavy hand to block dissent and suppress free speech. The city currently has the second most expensive residential housing market in the world behind Hong Kong, according to research by CBRE.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Philip J.
