(SGX:IX2) A Strong Dividend Stock?", "language": "en", "text": "Is PEC Ltd. (SGX:IX2) a good dividend stock? How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. If you are hoping to live on the income from dividends, it's important to be a lot more stringent with your investments than the average punter.\n\nIn this case, PEC likely looks attractive to investors, given its 3.5% dividend yield and a payment history of over ten years. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. The company also returned around 0.6% of its market capitalisation to shareholders in the form of stock buybacks over the past year. There are a few simple ways to reduce the risks of buying PEC for its dividend, and we'll go through these below.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nSGX:IX2 Historical Dividend Yield, October 7th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 62% of PEC's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. This is a fairly normal payout ratio among most businesses. It allows a higher dividend to be paid to shareholders, but does limit the capital retained in the business - which could be good or bad.\n\nAnother important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. PEC paid out 177% of its free cash flow last year, suggesting the dividend is poorly covered by cash flow. Paying out more than 100% of your free cash flow in dividends is generally not a long-term, sustainable state of affairs, so we think shareholders should watch this metric closely. PEC paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough free cash flow to cover the dividend. Cash is king, as they say, and were PEC to repeatedly pay dividends that aren't well covered by cashflow, we would consider this a warning sign.\n\nWhile the above analysis focuses on dividends relative to a company's earnings, we do note PEC's strong net cash position, which will let it pay larger dividends for a time, should it choose.\n\nConsider getting our latest analysis on PEC's financial position here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of PEC's dividend payments. This dividend has been unstable, which we define as having fallen by at least 20% one or more times over this time. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was S$0.046 in 2009, compared to S$0.02 last year. The dividend has shrunk at around 7.9% a year during that period. PEC's dividend hasn't shrunk linearly at 7.9% per annum, but the CAGR is a useful estimate of the historical rate of change.\n\nWhen a company's per-share dividend falls we question if this reflects poorly on either external business conditions, or the company's capital allocation decisions. Either way, we find it hard to get excited about a company with a declining dividend.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Is PEC Ltd. (SGX:IX2) a good dividend stock? How can we tell?
