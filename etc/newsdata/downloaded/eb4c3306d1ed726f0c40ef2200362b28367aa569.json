I can\u2019t think of another game that so frequently reminds its audience of such options, and I wondered why the developers of this flamboyant, new action game might do this. It all became clear after my performance on the first couple of files was deemed worthy of a D rating. Having played through a good number of Platinum Games\u2019 back catalogue \u2014 and generally fared much better \u2014 I was rattled by my first few hours with this decidedly odd action game.\n\n\u201cAstral Chain\u201d follows the story of twins \u2014 a brother and sister \u2014 who work for Neuron, an elite police force dedicated to defending humanity against an alien threat posed by \u201cchimeras,\u201d powerful creatures from another dimension who are invisible to most humans. Aided by bleeding edge technology, a select number of Neuron\u2019s employees are entrusted with Legions, captured chimeras who are chained to the wrist and neurologically linked to their operator. Figuratively speaking, I could feel my brain working overtime as I tried to get used to guiding a Legion and one of the twins at the same time.\n\n\n\nAstral Chain (Nintendo)\n\nAs is usual for most action games, movement of your agent is mapped to the left thumbstick while the right thumbstick controls the camera. Pressing the left trigger calls your Legion which then can be steered by holding the left trigger and manipulating the right thumbstick. On top of that there are buttons for switching weapons, switching Legions, using items and using your Legion\u2019s special abilities.\n\nThroughout the campaign, you\u2019ll acquire different Legions who each have their own unique characteristics. For example, the Arrow Legion allows you to fire projectiles at airborne enemies, the Arms Legion allows you lift heavy objects and the Beast Legion allows you to track enemies and ride on its back for speedy traversal. Learning to keep track of two avatars on the screen and to effectively use the chain between them \u2014 which, among other things, can be used to clothesline charging opponents, or to circle around enemies and briefly bind them \u2014 can be a tricky thing to come to grips with unless you are enviably ambidextrous.\n\n\n\nAstral Chain (Nintendo)\n\nWhen you factor in the \u201cAstral Chain\u2019s\u201d unusual duo avatar mechanic with the ins-and-outs of mastering the game\u2019s fighting mechanics \u2014 nailing a perfect dodge or keeping an eye out for the telltale flash on the screen that indicates an agent and a Legion can perform a coordinated attack \u2014 it\u2019s easy to get your fingers tangled up. Countless times while learning the ropes, I accidentally yanked on the chain sending my agent flying in the direction of a Legion without meaning to, or I\u2019d use an item when I meant to switch weapons or Legions.\n\nThree difficulty levels are available: Unchained, Casual, and Platinum Standard. In Unchained mode the game does the fighting for you so you can concentrate on the story. Casual mode forgoes the letter grade evaluations. It also and allows you to continue six times, after getting knocked down, before a Game Over screen appears. Platinum Standard gives you two continues. I tried playing \u201cAstral Chain\u201d on Casual after getting my second D but I found that too easy, so I anxiously went back to the other level. Thankfully, my anxieties were unfounded. Health items are plentiful, and I relaxed once I upgraded my Legions and weapons and began to get a better feel for using the chain more strategically.\n\n\n\nAstral Chain (Nintendo)\n\n\u201cAstral Chain\u201d was directed by Takahisa Taura whose 2017 game \u201cNier: Automata\u201d was selected as one of The Washington Post\u2019s Best Games of the Year. Both games are notable for their noncombat moments that often delight in the absurd. So it is at one point you must go on an office tour of Neuron with a dedicated employee who dresses up in a dog costume; you\u2019ll also get points for picking up cans on the streets and dropping them in trash receptacles. Conversely, you lose points for indulging in that most cliched video game activity, breaking crates. Presumably, since you\u2019re a cop as well as a good citizen, you can only cross city streets at crosswalks which, if you\u2019re late making it to the other side, will lead you to lose you points as well.\n\nThe game, which looks like a stylish heavily-inked manga, flaunts its affection toward animals. You can walk your Beast Legion like a dog and, in your off time, repair to a room full of cats. If only more big league developers dared to be this bonkers, the industry would be that much more untamed.\n\nChristopher Byrd is a Brooklyn-based writer.
