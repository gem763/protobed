It is capable of memory. It is capable of having an adapted behavior. It is capable of solving problems, of moving around a labyrinth.\u201d\n\nSlime molds are protists \u2014 mostly single-cell organisms grouped into their own kingdom on the evolutionary family tree because scientists aren\u2019t sure where else to put them. And the blob is one of the standouts of the kingdom of wayward organisms, after what could be an evolution that began a billion years ago.\n\nWhat David described is the blob\u2019s exasperating ability to navigate without eyes, limbs or wings. Researchers who sliced up pieces of the organism and sprinkled them in a maze watched them consolidate back into its original form.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen researchers put nutrients at the end of a maze, the blob searched for a way to the food, retreating from dead ends to find the shortest possible way to the prize. That\u2019s because it leaves a slime trail that tells itself where it has been, The Post\u2019s Sarah Kaplan reported.\n\nThe blob stretches in such an efficient manner that it has replicated human design. One blob re-created the Tokyo rail system after scientists scattered oat flakes in a pattern that resembled Japanese cities around the capital region, Wired reported, in a stunning development that one day could lead to engineers looking to slime for cues on urban planning.\n\nBlobs can even pass on what they know to others. In one study, French scientists created a bridge experiment with unpleasant nutrients in the way to make the blob find an alternate path to food on the other side.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAfter introducing the experiment to a new blob and allowing it to merge with another, the new super blob showed incredible wisdom.\n\n\u201cSomehow during the merging process, the naive cells learned a behavior for a situation that they themselves had never experienced,\u201d Harvard University wrote in a summary of the findings.\n\nThe zoo coronation has been a journey for the organism. Some have taken to calling it \u201cdog vomit\u201d for its murky yellowish color, but its informal name comes from the film \u201cThe Blob,\u201d a 1958 Steve McQueen B-movie about a creature from space that consumes two Pennsylvania towns in a bout of alien rage.\n\nCould that really happen? Could it gobble up the Paris zoo? All it needs is a reason. We know the blob can find a way.\n\nSarah Kaplan contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Physarum polycephalum \u2014 \u201cmany-headed slime\u201d \u2014 is making its public debut at the Paris Zoological Park.", "authors": ["Alex Horton", "General Assignment Reporter Covering National", "Breaking News"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Fa4plFYLoavbznEDuEFoA_kDbsg=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-17-2019/t_72f1b8841f2b421587d3bab6c6b06438_name_yellowblobpariszoo_scaled.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
