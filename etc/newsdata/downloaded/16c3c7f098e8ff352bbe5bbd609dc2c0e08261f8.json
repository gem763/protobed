It\u2019s a fair and balanced agreement for the EU and the UK and it is testament to our commitment to find solutions.\u201d\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted that the two sides had struck a \u201cgreat new deal\u201d and urged U.K. lawmakers to ratify it in a special session on Saturday\n\nThe breakthrough came just hours after Johnson\u2019s Northern Irish government allies threw a spanner in the works by saying they couldn\u2019t support the draft agreement because of provisions for the Irish border.\n\nThe prime minister needs all the support he can get to push any deal past a deeply divided Parliament.\n\nIt only added to the high anxiety that reigned on Thursday morning, as the last outstanding issues of the divorce papers were hammered out.\n\nTechnical negotiators again went into the night Wednesday to fine-tune customs and sales tax regulations that will have to regulate trade in goods between the Northern Ireland and Ireland \u2014 where the U.K. and the EU share their only land border.\n\nAfter months of gloom over the stalled Brexit process, European leaders have sounded upbeat this week. French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday that \u201cI want to believe that a deal is being finalized,\u201d while German Chancellor Angela Merkel said negotiations were \u201cin the final stretch.\u201d\n\nJohnson \u2014 who took office in July vowing Britain would finally leave the EU on Oct. 31, come what may \u2014 was slightly more cautious. He likened Brexit to climbing Mount Everest, saying the summit was in sight, though still shrouded in cloud.\n\nNorthern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party added to those clouds early Thursday. DUP leader Arlene Foster and the party\u2019s parliamentary chief Nigel Dodds said they \u201ccould not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues,\u201d referring to a say the Northern Irish authorities might have in future developments.\n\nBoth the customs and consent arrangements are key to guaranteeing an open border between the U.K.\u2019s Northern Ireland and EU member Ireland \u2014 the main obstacle to a Brexit deal.\n\nFoster and Dodds said they would continue to work with the U.K. government to get a \u201csensible\u201d deal. The problem is that the closer Johnson aligns himself with the DUP, the further he removes himself from the EU, leaving him walking a political tightrope.\n\nBrexit negotiations have been here before \u2014 seemingly closing in on a deal that is dashed at the last moment. But hopes have risen that this time may be different.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP\u2019s full coverage of Brexit and British politics at https://www.apnews.com/Brexit\n\n___\n\nA previous version of this story corrected a typographical error in the DUP leader\u2019s name to Arlene, not Arlen.", "description": "BRUSSELS (AP) \u2014 Britain and the European Union said Thursday that they have struck an outline Brexit deal after days of intense see-saw negotiations \u2014", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/ap/17/eb9ccc_belgium-eu-brexit-53332-man-waves-an-eu-union-flag-out-car-adorned-anti-brexit-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
