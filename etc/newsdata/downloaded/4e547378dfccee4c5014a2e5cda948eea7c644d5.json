And that's what I believe I took the most from.\"\n\nThe next two years will be daunting for track and field, as it tries to regain -- or retain -- its niche in the post-Bolt landscape. This week marks the beginning of the first world championships without Bolt since 2003. In less than a year, track will take its act to the Olympics, sans Bolt, for the first time since 2000.\n\nWATCH | Noah Lyles wins Diamond League sprint double:\n\nNoah Lyles added to his 100 metres win, with a victory in the men's 200 metres Diamond League final in Brussels, while Andre De Grasse finished third with a season best time of 19.74 seconds. 5:27\n\nLyles knows there will be comparisons. Two months ago, he ran 19.50 in the 200 metres, the distance Bolt considered his specialty and at which he holds a world record \u2014 19.19 seconds \u2014 that many in the sport feel will be hardest to top.\n\nBut Lyles, the charismatic sprinter \u2014 sound familiar? \u2014 who grew up in Florida before moving to Virginia, isn't daunted by that.\n\nThe 2019 world track and field championships in Qatar will mark the first without eight-time Olympic gold medallist Usain Bolt since 2003. (Thomas Kienzle/Associated Press/File)\n\nApparel designer, budding musician\n\nAnd while Lyles will be trying for three gold medals at next year's Tokyo Olympics \u2014 in the 100, 200 and 4x100 relay, a la Bolt \u2014 he's focusing solely on the 200 at world championships , because, in his words, \"I have a very strong chance of winning that 200. I also have a very strong chance of trying to break some meet records.\" (Bolt's world record was set at world championships in 2009).\n\nIf he does, then the track world will certainly want to scoop up every little tidbit it can about its newest, fastest man.\n\nAmong them:\n\nLyles is an apparel designer (check out his socks collection) and a budding musician who produced a hip-hop album that focuses on the cycle teenagers go through in acting out. He considers himself a cross between Kendrick Lamar, Travis Scott, Kanye West and Jaden Smith.\n\n\"I'm still trying to find my own flow,\" Lyles said.\n\nWATCH | Justin Gatlin outlasts upstart Noah Lyles in Monaco:\n\nUSA's Justin Gatlin finishes with a 9.91 time in the men's 100m race at the IAAF Diamond League event in Monaco. He finished just ahead of fellow Americans Noah Lyles and Michael Rodgers. 6:04\n\nNever lined up with Bolt on track\n\nWhether it was on the track, or on the dance floor, or spinning records at his own dance club in Kingston, few were able to make the switch between the athletic field and the nightclub as seamlessly as Bolt. In fact, sometimes they felt like one and the same.\n\nThough the comparisons are sure to come in all these venues, the five-foot-11 Lyles believes there's a benefit to never having lined up, mano a mano, against the six-foot-five Jamaican.\n\n\"It helps my career being able to say that I wasn't beaten by Bolt,\" said Lyles, who along with his younger brother, Josephus, signed a long-term deal with Adidas in 2016, passing on a chance to run at the University of Florida. \"If I [had been] then I would have that overwhelming gloom of, 'Oh, but you got beat by Bolt that one time.' And then you'd have that conversation of, 'Oh, but I was only 19.\"'\n\nThey did meet once, in a doctor's office in Germany before the 2017 world championships. Lyles, who was there to get his hamstring checked out, went over Bolt in the waiting area and introduced himself.\n\n\"Of course he's a cool guy,\" Lyles said. \"He's got world records.\"\n\nWhether it was on the track or dance floor, few were able to make the switch between the athletic field and the nightclub as seamlessly as current 200-metre world-record holder Usain Bolt. (Lee Jin-man/Associated Press/File)\n\nCould those records someday belong to Lyles? And if they do, could he be the sort of personality who would make people want to watch?\n\n\"He just wants to be the first Noah Lyles and that's all he thinks about,\" his coach, Lance Brauman, said. \"He's not caught up in the rigmarole about saving the sport -- or being the next this or being the next that.\n\n\"He's got the personality, has a lot of talent and likes to train. He's got a few good qualities right there.\"\n\nBreaking out dance moves\n\nHe certainly stands out in a crowd \u2014 spraying his hair silver will tend to do that (he did that for U.S. championships and plans to again in Doha).\n\nHe certainly can dance, too, breaking out a few moves after winning at nationals. Then, he posed for pictures with fans. He was in no hurry to leave the stage.\n\n\"Noah's a rock star,\" said Justin Gatlin, the reigning 100-metre world champion. \"He likes to put on a show.\"\n\nIn short, Lyles gets it: Lots of people run fast. But Bolt's celebrations are what made the victories so memorable.\n\n\"I could be the fastest and I could have the most medals, but are they going to remember that when I leave? Probably not,\" Lyles said. \"Because somebody else is going to come by and do the same thing. But everybody will remember Bolt's personality.\"", "description": "When U.S. sprinter Noah Lyles spends time studying Usain Bolt on video, he's not only looking at the lanky speedster's form in between the lanes, but at the dancing, rollicking post-race celebrations Bolt concocted to make his sport can't-miss viewing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5292742.1569079630!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/lyles-noah-190906-1180.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
