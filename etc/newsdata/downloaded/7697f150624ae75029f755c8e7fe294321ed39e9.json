Josh Hawley (R-MO) unloaded on NBA superstar LeBron James for his remarks regarding the league\u2019s ongoing free speech scandal with China, stating that his \u201cgarbage\u201d comments are \u201chard to take.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving just been in Hong Kong \u2013 on the streets & with the protestors \u2013 this kind of garbage is hard to take. LeBron, are YOU educated on \u201cthe situation\u201d? Why don\u2019t you go to Hong Kong? Why don\u2019t you meet the people there risking their lives for their most basic liberties,\u201d Hawley wrote on Twitter.\n\nThis statement is unbelievable. \u201cSo many people could have been harmed\u201d? By Daryl Morey daring to express sympathy for democracy? News flash: people ARE being harmed \u2013 shot, beaten, gassed \u2013 right now in Hong Kong. By China. By the Communist Party the NBA is so eager to appease \u2014 Josh Hawley (@HawleyMO) October 15, 2019\n\nhe added:\n\nThis statement is unbelievable. \u201cSo many people could have been harmed\u201d? By Daryl Morey daring to express sympathy for democracy? News flash: people ARE being harmed \u2013 shot, beaten, gassed \u2013 right now in Hong Kong. By China. By the Communist Party the NBA is so eager to appease.\n\nEarlier Monday, LeBron broke his silence on the NBA-China scandal by criticizing Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s now-deleted tweet in support of the pro-democracy movement sweeping Hong Kong, calling him uneducated on the subject, while warning against the \u201cramifications\u201d of free speech.\n\nJames told reporters:\n\nWe all talk about freedom of speech \u2014 yes, we do have freedom of speech. But at times, there are ramifications for the negative that can happen when you\u2019re not thinking about others and you\u2019re only thinking about yourself.\n\nThe hoops star added:\n\nI don\u2019t believe \u2014 I don\u2019t want to get into a \u2026 feud with Daryl Morey but I believe he wasn\u2019t educated on the situation at hand. And he spoke. And so many people could have been harmed, not only financially but emotionally, physically and spiritually. So just be careful with what we tweet and what we say and what we do, even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech. But there can be a lot of negative that comes from that speech.\n\nJames didn\u2019t play when the Lakers hosted the Golden State Warriors at Staples Center on Monday night, just two days after they returned from their bizarre trip to China.\n\nA typical NBA preseason promotional swing through Shanghai and Shenzhen became something else when Morey tweeted in support of the Hong Kong protesters while the Lakers were in the air on their 13-hour flight to China.\n\nThe Lakers landed amid outrage with Morey\u2019s since-deleted tweet and the NBA in general. The league and Chinese authorities decided to hold no media availability or community events with the Lakers or the Brooklyn Nets, their opponents.\n\nThe Lakers passed their week in China in public silence. Although the exhibition games weren\u2019t canceled, the league claimed it would be unfair to ask players and coaches to speak on the delicate geopolitical argument in which they found themselves involuntarily enmeshed.\n\nSo the players spent most of the week in hotels or on the court, with two NBA Cares events, a fan event, and other public appearances canceled by the league or the government. Several companies and state-run offices reportedly severed their ties with the NBA over Morey\u2019s tweet and the league\u2019s response to it.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Sen.
