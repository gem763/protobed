(\u201cHalo\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NEO: HALO, OTCQX: AGEEF, Germany: A9KN) is pleased to announce that, further to the press release dated October 7, 2019 (the \u201cOctober 7 Press Release\u201d), it has closed the previously announced non-brokered private placement of Halo common shares at a price of CAD $0.31 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of CAD $3 million (the \u201cPrivate Placement\u201d). Due to increase investor interest, the Company anticipates that the Private Placement will be increased by at least CAD $1 million within the next week. The Company will issue a subsequent press release to announce the closing of any additional tranches of the Private Placement.\n\nHalo is also pleased to announce the closing of its acquisition of all of the common shares of Cannpos Services Corp. (\u201cCannpos\u201d) pursuant to the definitive agreement executed on October 5, 2019, and as amended on October 11, 2019 (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) for CAD $4.88 million in Halo common shares at a deemed price of CAD $0.26 per share (the \u201cAcquisition\u201c), as previously disclosed in the October 7 Press Release.\n\nAbout Cannpos\n\nCannpos is a software company that is developing an application to alleviate customer flow constraints currently experienced by dispensaries. Subject to state and local regulations, once fully functional, the application will enable customers to electronically interact with dispensaries, thereby reducing wait times and improving customer experience. Dispensaries will also be able to use the application to display in-store specials, advertise specific products, and track customers\u2019 purchasing patterns. The application\u2019s tracking capabilities will enable dispensaries and Halo to gather business intelligence on end customers, in compliance with privacy laws. The application is being designed to be used on a smart phone or tablet and will be available for private distribution once tested and complete. Halo intends to rebrand the application as \u201cDispensaryTrack\u201d and offer it to its retail partners for an ongoing monthly service fee.\n\nThe Private Placement\n\nPursuant to the Private Placement, Halo issued a total of 9,677,420 common shares at a price of CAD $0.31 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of CAD $3 million. The Halo common shares issued in connection with the Private Placement will be subject to a four month and one day statutory hold period pursuant to applicable securities laws.\n\nHalo intends to use the proceeds of the Private Placement to complete the development and deployment of DispensaryTrack and continue its expansion efforts in California, including the increase of its direct sales force and product offerings and the growth of its manufacturing capacity in Cathedral City.\n\nThe Acquisition\n\nThe Acquisition was completed through a three-cornered amalgamation (the \u201cAmalgamation\u201d) whereby Halo, through a new wholly-owned subsidiary (Halo DispensaryTrack Software Inc.), acquired 100% of Cannpos\u2019 outstanding common shares from its shareholders in exchange for 18,785,714 Halo common shares (rather than 18,035,714 Halo common shares and 1,250,000 performance warrants as previously disclosed in the October 7 Press Release). In connection with the Agreement, two Cannpos shareholder vendors entered into consulting agreements (the \u201cConsulting Agreements\u201d) with the amalgamated company resulting from the Amalgamation (\u201cAmalco\u201d). As consideration under the Consulting Agreements, Halo issued 1,250,000 performance share units (the \u201cPerformance Share Units\u201d), which are convertible into 1,250,000 Halo common shares and subject to vesting restrictions. The Performance Share Units will only vest and become convertible when the application has been custom designed to meet Halo\u2019s specifications on or before October 11, 2020. The common shares issued by Halo in conjunction with the Acquisition will be subject to certain sale restrictions.\n\nHalo has received the acceptance of the Neo Exchange Inc. for the Acquisition and the Private Placement, including the Performance Share Units issuable under the Consulting Agreements.\n\nABOUT HALO\n\nHalo is a cannabis extraction company that develops and manufactures quality cannabis oils and concentrates, which are the fastest growing segments in the cannabis industry.
