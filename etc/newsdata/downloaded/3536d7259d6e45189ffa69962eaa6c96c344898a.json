Photo: Elkanah Tisdale\n\nWhen the U.S. Supreme Court declared partisan gerrymandering none of its business in June, it did remind opponents of that nasty and anti-democratic practice there was another way to skin the cat, as I noted at the time:\n\nThe silver lining of the Supreme Court\u2019s retreat from interest in partisan gerrymandering is that it has led the Court to defer to recent efforts to attack the practice on state constitutional grounds. That\u2019s what happened last year when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down a GOP-drafted congressional map and substituted its own: As Republicans everywhere howled, the U.S. Supreme Court shrugged and refused to review the case.\n\nNow partisan gerrymandering has hit a judicial wall in a second state, North Carolina, as the Raleigh News & Observer reports:\n\nNorth Carolina\u2019s political maps for the state legislature are unconstitutional and must be redrawn before the 2020 elections, a court has decided.\n\nA panel of judges struck down the maps Tuesday, in a 357-page ruling that focused on the level of political partisanship used to draw them. The maps were drawn in 2017 to replace previous maps, drawn in 2011, that had also been ruled unconstitutional. Both sets of maps were drawn by North Carolina\u2019s Republican-led legislature.\n\nThis was the unanimous decision of a fact-finding trial court (in North Carolina, lawsuits involving constitutional challenges are generally heard by three-judge panels\u2013in this case composed of two Democrats and one Republican), not the appeal court of final recourse, but it very thoroughly examined the redistricting system and legal precedents and, like the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, found that the GOP\u2019s effort to systematically reduce representation of Democratic voters violated the state constitution\u2019s equal protection clause (plus another \u201cfree elections\u201d clause). It ordered the legislature to conduct a remap for 2020 immediately, for which it set a September 18 deadline. Amazingly, the Republican president of the North Carolina Senate said he intended to comply instead of seeking to overturn the order with an appeal to a higher state court:\n\n[A]fter the loss Tuesday, Republican Senate leader Phil Berger said he wouldn\u2019t appeal and would instead start drawing new maps.\n\n\u201cWe disagree with the court\u2019s ruling as it contradicts the Constitution and binding legal precedent, but we intend to respect the court\u2019s decision and finally put this divisive battle behind us,\u201d Berger said in a statement. \u201cNearly a decade of relentless litigation has strained the legitimacy of this state\u2019s institutions, and the relationship between its leaders, to the breaking point. It\u2019s time to move on.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll soon find out if other Republicans agree. In theory the decision could provide the basis for a challenge to North Carolina\u2019s congressional map, too, but it remains to be seen if that will develop. Nonpartisan maps should help Democrats enormously in the 2020 legislative elections, in which all 120 House seats and 50 Senate seats will be up. Currently Republicans hold a 64-55 margin in the House (with one vacancy) and a 29-21 margin in the Senate. With a gubernatorial and a Senate race on the ballot and the state also expected to be a presidential battleground, North Carolina could represent a mega-target for both parties next year.\n\nThere\u2019s no particular reason today\u2019s decision in one state court should have an impact on potential gerrymandering cases elsewhere. But on the other hand, copy-cat lawsuits are entirely likely, particularly in places with state constitutional provisions similar to the general \u201cequal protection\u201d guarantees found in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. You can expect some intense litigation before the next round of redistricting begins in 2021. Soon, in some states, partisan gerrymandering can be as illegal and unsavory as racial gerrymandering.", "description": "Despite the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision earlier this year that partisan gerrymandering doesn\u2019t violate the U.S. Constitution, courts in Pennsylvania and now North Carolina have decided state equal protection clauses ban them.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/03/03-gerrymandering.w1200.h630.jpg"}
