It was daily life, especially when they closed with hostile shorelines to render naval gunfire support to forces ashore\u2014and thus came within striking reach of Iraqi defenses.\n\nMy answer: yes.\n\nIn the abstract. Under ideal conditions.\n\nIf you ripped such an engagement out of its actual operational context, in other words, then yes, it was technically possible for Iraqi airmen or rocketeers to sink a dreadnought. One vessel can scarcely stand against the combined might of a nation. Yet sundering could-have-been events from reality reveals little of value. Iraqi prospects were farfetched when viewed in the real-world context of war in the Persian Gulf. Focusing that much martial throw weight against one surface combatant at the right time and place would have strained Iraqi capability\u2014even if Saddam & Co. had made assaulting the American ironclads their uppermost priority.\n\nBut first the hypotheticals. Events in the Gulf during the 1980s, when Iraq and Iran waged a brutal struggle for dominion, bore grim witness to the power of mine and missile warfare. During the 1987-1988 \u201ctanker war,\u201d the U.S. Navy organized convoys for Kuwaiti merchantmen reflagged under the Stars and Stripes. While they guarded against missile attack, escort ships took to trailing behind the tankers they were protecting, simply because the tankers\u2019 massive hulls could withstand the blast from a sea mine far better than flimsily armored warships could. Protectors became the protected.\n\nRead the original article.", "description": "Could it have worked?", "authors": ["James Holmes"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KdtS9y.HvrPy.sVx8hRNdA--~B/aD0xMDA5O3c9MTQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/a92272113a6e3d3c08c897490ec39fcd", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
