The above calculator applies that model to thousands of possible situations. We\u2019ve written an article on the findings of the quiz, but here are a few key takeaways:\n\nThe friend effect\n\nInvitations to or from a \u201cfriend of a friend\u201d are mostly likely to be perceived as a date, all else being equal. Invitations from a friend, meanwhile, are the least likely to be considered dates.\n\nGender and age play a role\n\nIn most cases, straight men are at least 5% more likely than women of any orientation to consider something a date. Gay men are 4% less likely to consider anything a date. People age 30 or younger are 3% more likely to consider anything a date.\n\nSubscribe to the Motto newsletter for advice worth sharing.\n\nDinner usually means a date\n\nDinner telegraphs \u201cdate\u201d better than any other meal, followed by a drink. This is less true in both cases if the day is Sunday.\n\nThe best way to ask\n\nAsking someone out in person adds a modest boost to the odds that the person being asked will consider it a date. Emailing, meanwhile, slightly detracts from the odds.\n\nHow to see an ex\n\nIf you\u2019re meeting with an ex-boyfriend or an ex-girlfriend, coffee and lunch are the safest options to signal that you\u2019re not interested in getting back together.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://timeinclabs.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/was-it-a-date-share.jpg?quality=75&strip=color"}
