The Cadzow oakwoods provided much inspiration to the Cadzow Artists, a school of landscape painters including Horatio McCulloch (1805-67) and Samuel Bough (1822-78).\n\nThe Future Forest Tree - Glen Nevis\n\nImage copyright Niall Benvie/WTML Image caption Nevis Landscape Partnership volunteer Alison Stewart nominated the Future Forest Tree\n\nThis four-year-old Scots pine represents thousands reversing the deforestation of Glen Nevis thanks to Nevis Landscape Parternship's Future Forests initiative.\n\nSeed was collected from gnarly ancient pines high in the glen and grown in planting boxes around Lochaber.\n\nLocal children planted the saplings back out in the glen in exclosures protecting them from grazing animals. The trees will grow, with the children, to become future guardians of the Glen.\n\nCovenanter's Oak - Motherwell\n\nImage copyright Niall Benvie/WTML Image caption The Covenanter's Oak was nominated by Alex Marshall of 10th Motherwell Scouts\n\nThis oak tree on the Dalzell Estate in Motherwell is more than 800 years old and formed part of a deer park planted by King David I.\n\nFrom 1638 to 1688, the Scottish Covenanters sought religious and civil freedom, refusing to subscribe to the view that the monarch was spiritual head of the Church.\n\nUnder threat of death for their beliefs, Covenanters had to hold clandestine outdoor services, and hundreds attended worship beneath this tree.\n\nThe Peace Tree - Stonehaven\n\nImage copyright Niall Benvie/WTML Image caption Councillor Colin Pike chose The Peace Tree as his nomination\n\nThis oak was planted at Dunnottar Church in 1919 to mark the signing of the treaty ending World War One, and is officially recognised as a national war memorial.\n\nOne hundred years on, a service was held on the 6 July 2019 and was attended by Freemasons from the Province of Kincardineshire, principally from the Lodge of Stonehaven No.65, along with guests from local churches and organisations.\n\nThe original spade used to plant the tree was on display and is kept in the Masonic Lodge above the internal entrance door.\n\nOnce hidden away by brambles, the tree has been returned to view in recent years and celebrated its 100th birthday by producing a good crop of acorns for the first time in some years.\n\nThe Grand Old Man of Dawyck - Peebles\n\nImage copyright Niall Benvie/WTML Image caption The Grand Old Man of Dawyk was nominated by Graham Stewart, curator of Dawyck Botanic Garden\n\nThis 340-year-old European silver fir is the oldest tree in Dawyck Botanic Garden near Peebles. Collected from the mountains of Europe it bears battle scars from centuries of harsh weather, including the great storm of 1880, the hurricane of 1968 and the relentless battering of Boxing Day 1998.\n\nPlanted in the wake of the Battle of Bothwell Bridge and before the Jacobite rising, it has stood steady through many momentous periods in Scottish history.\n\nThe Last Ent of Affric - Glen Affric\n\nImage copyright Niall Benvie/WTML Image caption The Last Ent of Affric, nominated by Giles Brockman of Forest and Land Scotland\n\nWith the looks of an ancient tree-creature from Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, this elm stood forgotten in a spur off Glen Affric until a 2012 site visit by FLS and Trees for Life staff.\n\nIt is the only one of its kind in the glen and likely the last survivor of some ancient forest, and now stands guard over the rebirth of a new native woodland in Affric.\n\nThe Last Ent of Affric has quietly lived hidden away from the ravages of Dutch Elm disease that is spreading west through the Highlands.\n\nAll images are copyrighted.", "description": "Fans will vote for their favourites from a shortlist of six trees, including an ancient oak and a 340-year-old silver fir.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/5254/production/_108667012_affricifte-nb-184762.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
