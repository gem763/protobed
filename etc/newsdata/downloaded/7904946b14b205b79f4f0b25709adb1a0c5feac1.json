But reports of a possible end to the strike didn\u2019t prevent Democratic candidates from forgoing their chance to bash the corporation and virtue-signal their support for the striking union members in front of the Ohio crowd.\n\nOf course, while the candidates felt comfortable denouncing GM as a greedy and evil corporation, they conveniently glossed over the habitual corruption of UAW\u2019s leadership which includes recent FBI investigations and raids on charges of racketeering, bribery and kickbacks. The scandal has led to a string of arrests and the indictment of ten top UAW officials, including officials still at the negotiating table with GM. For Democrats, these are small matters easily swept under the rug when the union\u2019s endorsement is still up for grabs.\n\nDuring the debate, without mentioning a word of the UAW\u2019s crookedness, Beto O\u2019Rourke blamed GM for the strikes and attacked the automaker for the alleged \u201cmalfeasance\u201d of \u201cpaying effectively zero in taxes last year.\u201d First, it should be obvious to all that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s claim that GM paid no taxes in 2018 is false. According to GM, the company paid more than $3.15 billion in state, local and payroll taxes in the U.S. in 2018.\n\nUnfortunately, claiming that corporations aren\u2019t paying taxes has become a standard talking point for Democratic candidates. In reality these companies utilize federal tax credits for research and development and take deductions for losses in previous years, all of which is allowed by U.S. tax code. GM, for example, benefits from R&D credits for electric and autonomous vehicles and is still taking tax deductions for its losses prior to 2009. O\u2019Rourke can oppose such deductions on policy grounds, but to label GM\u2019s legal use of the tax code as \u201cmalfeasance\u201d while ignoring the actual criminals leading UAW makes him an outright hypocrite.\n\nBut O\u2019Rourke wasn\u2019t alone is in his pandering. Elizabeth Warren also joined in, vowing her campaign would strengthen the bargaining position of UAW members by requiring 40% of a corporation\u2019s board of directors to be chosen by their employees. Warren\u2019s plan, which in addition to having the government coerce corporate boards to abandon their accountability to shareholders, would effectively place unions are on both sides of the bargaining table during worker strikes. Having unions negotiating with themselves is an obvious recipe for disaster, although perhaps in UAW\u2019s case it would eliminate the need for bribery as union officials would only be paying themselves.\n\nWhen asked by moderators to explain his support of the striking autoworkers, Cory Booker answered by implying GM is denying its workers a \u201cliving wage\u201d and broadly proclaiming that \u201cunions in America are under attack.\u201d Apparently for Booker, the average $90,000 annual salary earned by GM\u2019s hourly employees doesn\u2019t constitute a living wage and GM\u2019s decision to continue healthcare coverage for its striking employees amounts to an assault. To most Americans, having your employer continue paying for your healthcare plan while refusing to show up to work seems rather generous.\n\nThe rhetoric and pandering on display at Tuesday\u2019s debate made clear that the Democratic candidates aren\u2019t concerned with an end to the strike or for the welfare of workers. If they were, they would have used the debate stage to praise GM and its workers for reaching an agreement that gets employees back to work under better terms.\n\nInstead, Democrats spent the night bashing GM and sowing discord between a company and its employees.\n\nMike Palicz is Federal Affairs Manager at Americans for Tax Reform", "description": "In an apparent pandering competition to win the favor of .10/19/2019 12:11:33PM EST.", "authors": ["Mike", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Sarah Lee"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/216/d917a76f-dd0e-4ffa-bc1e-6778e3848d32.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
