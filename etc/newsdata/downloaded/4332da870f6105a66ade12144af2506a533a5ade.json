Five minutes later, though, the goalkeeper was beaten after a fine build-up featuring consecutive reverse passes by Adam Jackson and Allan to free Christian Doidge inside the Celtic box.\n\nRather than shoot, the striker chose to attempt a cutback across the six-yard box but the ball ricocheted from Ajer to wrong-foot Forster and finish up in the back of the net.\n\nCeltic were level before the midway point of the half when Bauer got clear on the right to deliver a hanging cross which was attacked by Ryan Christie, entirely unmarked, for a looping header over Chris Maxwell.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe goal had been preceded by a free-kick to Celtic, but only after a prolonged passage of play, at the end of which they should have returned the ball to Hibs, according to the Easter Road manager, Paul Heckingbottom, who kicked a water bottle that struck assistant referee Alan Mulvaney. Heckingbottom was promptly sent to the stand by Kevin Clancy.\n\nScott Brown was at the heart of a game strewn with yellow cards Credit: PA\n\nThe referee also angered Celtic, who believed that he turned down two plausible claims for penalty kicks for challenges by Stevenson on Christie and Daryl Horgan on Bauer. Hibs\u2019 later grievance was about a blatant and sustained tug on Middleton\u2019s jersey by Christopher Jullien.\n\nCeltic\u2019s next challenge is the chance to remedy unfinished business on Thursday when they meet CFR Cluj at home for the second time in as many competitions this season. When the pair first collided in the third round of the Champions League qualifiers, Dan Petrescu\u2019s side achieved an extraordinary 4-3 victory in the east end of Glasgow and they now return in the Europa League group stage.\n\n\u201cThey came to our house and beat us,\u201d said Jullien, as he contemplated the rematch. \u201cWhenever a team comes here and does that it\u2019s going to remain in the corner of our minds.\n\n\u201cWe know the Champions League was a big goal for the club, it was a misstep for us in that game. It was hard for us. They celebrated, they enjoyed their victory in our house and we were mad after that.\n\n\u201cFor sure, it\u2019s going to be a revenge game. I wasn\u2019t with all my team-mates at the time of the Europa League group draw but in the locker room we were pretty confident because we know the quality we have here.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t point the finger specifically at Cluj because we know Rennes and Lazio are good teams too. We just laughed a little bit \u2013 \u2018We\u2019re going to see them again!\u2019\n\n\u201cWe are ready for that challenge. They showed they are a good team by beating Lazio and the Europa League is a tough competition. Every team in this competition fights for everything.\u201d\n\nJullien pinpointed his French countryman, Odsonne Edouard, as the player most likely to reverse the outcome of the first meeting with Cluj.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve played against a lot of strikers and I have definitely not met many who are complete like Odsonne,\u201d he said. \u201cHe can drop deep and play in the midfielders and, as a defender, it can be hard when the striker is getting away from you, it\u2019s like he disappears from you. Then he might come back, dribbling from another part of the field. It\u2019s really difficult.\u201d\n\nRangers thrashed Aberdeen to close the gap at the top of the table Credit: PA\n\nElsewhere in the Premiership, Rangers beat Aberdeen 5-0 at Ibrox to move just a point behind Celtic in the table. Derek McInnes\u2019s Dons caused Rangers many problems last season but on this occasion Steven Gerrard\u2019s side dominated, handing Aberdeen their heaviest loss for almost 10 years.\n\nJames Tavernier scored the opening goal from the penalty spot after Zak Vyner had fouled Alfredo Morelos. Five minutes before half-time, former Dons loan player Greg Stewart made it 2-0 with a left-foot shot.\n\nEarly in the second half, Stewart hit the bar with a right-foot shot. But goal No 3 duly arrived in the 50th minute when Morelos headed in a cross from Borna Barisic. Aberdeen held firm for a while after that but Rangers made it 4-0 from another penalty in the 71st minute. Greg Leigh fouled Stewart in the box and Tavernier again did the necessary with the spot-kick.\n\nSubstitute Jermain Defoe, who had replaced Sheyi Ojo, scored Rangers\u2019 fifth 10 minutes from time.\n\nHamilton came from behind to win 2-1 at home against Livingston. Alan Lithgow headed the visitors in front but Brian Rice\u2019s team fought back to take the points with an equaliser from Blair Alston and a penalty winner by Ross Cunningham following a foul on Marios Ogboe six minutes from time.\n\nMotherwell are up to third place in the table after a hard-fought 1-0 victory at St Johnstone thanks to a first-half tap-in by Devante Cole.\n\nThe Lanarkshire side, who had Liam Donnelly sent off late on, were grateful to keeper Mark Gillespie for saving a Scott Tanser penalty.\n\nRoss County goalkeeper Ross Laidlaw also saved a penalty, denying Osman Sow, as they held Kilmarnock to a 0-0 draw at Rugby Park. St Mirren also drew 0-0 at home to Hearts.", "description": "Celtic at last fell short of perfection on Saturday, conceding their first league points to a fighting Hibernian side, who redeemed themselves after last week\u2019s dispiriting home defeat by Edinburgh rivals Hearts.
