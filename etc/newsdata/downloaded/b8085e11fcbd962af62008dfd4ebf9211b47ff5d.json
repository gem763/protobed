REUTERS/Rafael Marchante\n\nAlbert Rivera, head of the pro-unionist Ciudadanos party, told hundreds of flag-waving supporters that Spain\u2019s acting Socialist government was not doing enough to end the chaos sparked by the jailing of separatist leaders.\n\n\u201cPeople can\u2019t take their children to school, they can\u2019t open their businesses,\u201d Barcelona-born Rivera said. \u201cWe need a Spanish government that protects the weak.\u201d\n\nPro-independence supporters have taken to the streets of Barcelona for six days running in often violent confrontations with police that have left dozens injured and caused more than a million euros ($1.1 million) of damage to the Mediterranean city.\n\nA policeman and a protester remained in critical condition, Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau said on Sunday, adding that \u201cseveral people\u201d had been blinded in one eye by police rubber bullets.\n\nAfter unprecedented violence on Friday, demonstrations on Saturday passed off relatively peacefully and the government has said it has the situation under control.\n\nIndependence is a highly divisive issue in Catalonia, which is Spain\u2019s wealthiest region and has 7.5 million inhabitants. A poll in July showed backing for secession at its lowest level in two years, with 48.3% of people against and 44% in favor.\n\n\u201cThere are more of us Catalan Spaniards than separatists. It\u2019s important that people see that not everyone is in favor of independence,\u201d said Martina Gonzalez, a 58-year-old cleaner who had a Spanish flag draped over her shoulders.\n\n\u201cI am Spanish, Spanish, Spanish,\u201d the crowd chanted.\n\nNO DIALOGUE\n\nOne of those at the rally, 54-year-old Angel Rodriguez, said he had never witnessed the sort of urban unrest that has rocked Spain\u2019s second-largest city this week.\n\n\u201cThese young people have been indoctrinated. They can\u2019t explain why they want independence because they don\u2019t know the history,\u201d he said.\n\nSpain\u2019s acting Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, dismissed calls on Saturday from Catalonia\u2019s pro-independence regional chief to hold talks aimed at defusing the crisis.\n\nSanchez said Catalonia President Quim Torra must first condemn the tumult unequivocally and then build bridges with the many Catalans who do not want secession.\n\nPro-independence leaders staged an illegal referendum in 2017 and then declared they were breaking away from Spain. The Spanish government of the time immediately seized control of the Catalan administration and the ringleaders were put on trial.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday found nine politicians and activists guilty of sedition and sentenced them to up to 13 years in jail, triggering immediate street unrest.\n\nThe Catalan question has dominated domestic politics in recent years and was instrumental in triggering parliamentary elections in April, which gave no single party a majority.\n\nThe Socialists have called a national election next month, but a poll released on Thursday suggested parliament would remain split. The survey found that support for Ciudadanos was plunging, suggesting Rivera is fighting for political survival.", "description": "One of the most prominent figures against independence for the Spanish region of Catalonia staged a counter-protest on Sunday after a week of separatist unrest and called for an end to the violence.", "authors": ["Isla Binnie", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1442991117&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0CU-OCATP", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
