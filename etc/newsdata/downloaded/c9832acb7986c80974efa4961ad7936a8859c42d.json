That legislation would strengthen background check requirements for gun purchases.\n\nThe Senate's top Republican said he expects the administration to come to a conclusion next week.\n\nMore: 'Congress has a lot of thinking to do' on gun control after Midland-Odessa shooting\n\n\u201cIf the president is in favor of a number of things that he has discussed openly and publicly, and I know that if we pass it it\u2019ll become law, I\u2019ll put it on the floor,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nTrump had come out strongly in support of gun control legislation in the wake of recent mass shootings, only to reverse his stance several times. He has also placed emphasis on the issue of mental health care in order to address gun violence.\n\nThe Kentucky lawmaker, who is up for reelection in 2020, said on Tuesday that he hopes voters will \u201cfocus on facts\u201d rather than rhetoric. His opponents have labeled him a \u201cgrim reaper\u201d of legislation and given him the moniker \u201cMoscow Mitch.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an effort to smear me,\u201d he said.\n\nPrior to Saturday's shooting, McConnell had already instructed the chairman of three committees \u2013 Judiciary; Commerce, Science and Transportation; and Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \u2014 to examine an array of potential bipartisan solutions \"to help protect our communities without infringing on Americans\u2019 constitutional rights.\"\n\nAnd, because of Hurricane Dorian, the House Judiciary Committee canceled plans to return early from recess to work on gun bills. The trio of bills the committee will examine includes measures that would prevent those convicted of misdemeanor hate crimes from being eligible to purchase firearms, a proposal aimed to entice states to create \"red flag\" programs and a ban on high-capacity magazines.\n\nWhile the GOP-controlled Senate has instead been examining its own measures addressing mental health, video games and a \"red flag\" proposal, which Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. has said he would introduce.\n\nMore: Hurricane Dorian causes House panel to cancel plans to come back early, take up gun bills\n\nDemocratic politicians called on McConnell to move forward with the House-passed legislation after Saturday\u2019s shooting.\n\n\u201cDo something, Senator McConnell. America is done waiting for you,\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts tweeted.\n\nTime\u2019s up, @SenateMajLdr. Let\u2019s vote on gun safety legislation NOW. Every day you wait, more tragedies happen.\n\n\n\nDo something, Senator McConnell. America is done waiting for you. \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) September 1, 2019\n\nOur thoughts are with the victims, their families, & everyone injured in the shooting in Odessa & Midland, TX.\n\n\n\nThank you to the first responders who risked their lives to stop the threat.@senatemajldr should bring up H.R. 8 the week Congress returns. We must #endgunviolence. \u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) September 1, 2019", "description": "\u201cWell, we\u2019re in a discussion about what to do on the gun issue in the wake of these horrendous shootings,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told conservative radio talk show host Hugh Hewitt Tuesday.", "authors": ["Jeanine Santucci", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/htrLjFCZ3B1WlvtppjlgAg--~B/aD0zMjY2O3c9NDg5ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/fbdec5ee538d8852c37f7499d7de8376"}
