Switzerland have a much easier run-in as they host Georgia and visit Gibraltar in their final games.\n\nSwitzerland took early control and Seferovic picked up a loose ball outside the penalty area and scored with a snapshot beyond Darren Randolph to put them ahead.\n\nIreland had to wait 42 minutes for their first effort on target, a Duffy header from a corner which went straight to keeper Yann Sommer.\n\nSeferovic fired wildly over from a good position before halftime and, as the hosts became edgy, Ireland enjoyed a long period of pressure early in the second half without seriously threatening Sommer\u2019s goal.\n\nAfter Randolph turned a Fabian Schaer header onto the post, Switzerland won a penalty when Seamus Coleman blocked Breel Embolo\u2019s shot with his hand and was sent off for a second bookable offence.\n\nYet Rodriguez\u2019s weak penalty from a stuttering run up was pushed onto the post by Randolph.\n\nSwitzerland finally settled matters with the last kick of the game courtesy of Duffy, who slid Edimilson Fernandes\u2019 shot into his own net.\n\nGeorgia, who cannot qualify from the group, won 3-2 away to Gibraltar in the other game.\n\nGiorgi Kharaishvili and Jaba Kankava put Georgia 2-0 ahead after 21 minutes but Gibraltar, still without a point, hit back to equalise through Lee Casciaro and Roy Chipolina in an eight-minute spell in the second half.\n\nIt was all in vain, however, as Giorgi Kvilitaia grabbed Georgia\u2019s winner six minutes from fulltime.", "description": "Switzerland revived their hopes of qualifying directly for Euro 2020 and denied Ireland the chance to book their place early with a nervous 2-0 win in rain-soaked Geneva on Tuesday which threw their group wide open.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191015&t=2&i=1441245258&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9E1WR", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
