Nor during a fourth, 5D ultrasound during the sixth month of pregnancy, when they allegedly specifically asked whether Carvalho could see any potential issues and he said no.\n\n\u201cHe explained that sometimes some parts of the face are not visible [on ultrasounds] \u2026 when the baby\u2019s face is glued to the belly of the mother,\u201d the baby\u2019s aunt told a local broadcaster, AFP reported.\n\nRelated Video: Fetal Remains Found in Garage of Late Abortion Doctor\n\nBut when their son Rodrigo was born on Oct. 7, he was missing part of his face. The parents submitted a complaint to the Portuguese Prosecutor\u2019s Office, and the Portugal medical council, Ordem dos Medicos, voted to suspend Carvalho for six months while they investigate.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Surrogate Mom Gives Birth to Baby Girl with Serious Birth Defects Despite Parents\u2019 Order to Abort\n\nSeveral other complaints against Carvalho have since come out, the BBC reported, including one from 2011 of a baby born with severe brain damage and leg and facial deformities. The child is now 8, according to P\u00fablico, a daily newspaper in Portugal, and cannot walk or talk, despite undergoing multiple operations.\n\nRodrigo was only expected to live for a few hours, but he has made through over two weeks at the hospital.\n\nCarvalho initially agreed to stop practicing while the Ordem dos M\u00e9dicos investigated the latest complaint, but they later decided to suspend him for six months.\n\nAlexandre Valentim Lourenco, the medical council chief for Portugal\u2019s southern region told a local broadcaster that there is \u201cstrong evidence\u201d that Carvalho did not properly care for his patients. He added that Carvalho\u2019s suspension will hopefully \u201creassure\u201d pregnant women now that he is no longer practicing.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Doctor Suspended After Baby Born Without Part of Its Face", "authors": ["Julie Mazziotta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/FMQg_kv.UH3oJaK5Gg2BAg--~B/aD0xMzU4O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/659ae42294680f1f4501c685d50935b7", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
