In a 750-word Facebook post, since removed, Paisley described the journalist as \u201cincredibly immature, intellectually weak and a simplistic fellow\u201d.\n\nThe News Letter\u2019s editor, Alistair Bushe, demanded in a letter to the Democratic Unionist party (DUP) MP on Tuesday that he remove the post and publish a retraction.\n\n\u201cI was appalled to see your egregious and defamatory personal attacks on my political editor, Sam McBride, and on the News Letter \u2026 your statements are plainly false, and although I am not a lawyer, I have no doubt they are highly defamatory of him,\u201d wrote Bushe.\n\n\u201cIn any event, they seem to me to be clearly designed to undermine and discredit Sam McBride\u2019s private and professional reputations, and to harm the reputation of the News Letter (and indirectly, of me as its editor).\u201d\n\nIn the letter, which was copied to the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, its deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, and its chief whip, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Bushe said that while he hoped the matter could be resolved without delay, Paisley should desist from further attacks.\n\n\u201cPlease understand that neither Sam McBride nor I will tolerate your attacks on our respective reputations, or allow your false assertions to go unchallenged,\u201d said the editor.\n\nPaisley was responding to an analysis piece written by McBride on Saturday exploring the tactics of the DUP in relation to abortion reform in Northern Ireland, which will be imposed by Westminster if power-sharing is not restored by 21 October. The News Letter is a unionist paper and has a large readership in DUP heartlands where abortion reform is a divisive issue.\n\nThe DUP issued a statement on Tuesday night relating to the specific arguments in McBride\u2019s piece, but added that \u201cconcentration should be on the analysis rather than the author\u201d.\n\nThe NUJ spokesman S\u00e9amus Dooley described Paisley\u2019s attack as \u201cunwarranted and unworthy of an MP\u201d. He said it was a \u201cclear attempt to smear the professional reputation of a conscientious journalist\u201d.\n\nMcBride said he was \u201chumbled by the scale of the support\u201d from colleagues, readers and politicians \u201cincluding individuals within the DUP who have contacted me to express their private disquiet at what Mr Paisley has said\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is healthy for politicians and journalists to engage in robust debate and I passionately believe in free speech. However, it in unacceptable for Mr Paisley to misrepresent what I have written, denigrate me by peddling falsehoods and for some of his party colleagues to then extend this to my family,\u201d he said.", "description": "North Antrim MP accused Sam McBride of lying as part of agenda to destroy DUP", "authors": ["Lisa O'Carroll", "Ben Lowry"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e620c06f47066310c57374e7afeefea059a38f3/873_411_2627_1576/master/2627.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cbe8be7a9966a13ef92edcc65346ebe8", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
