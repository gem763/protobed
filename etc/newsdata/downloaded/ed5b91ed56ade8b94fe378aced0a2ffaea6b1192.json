A Charity Commission spokesperson said: 'We have not received an application for the David Cotterill Foundation. It is not a registered charity.'\n\nThe former Wales international was a part of the Euro 2016 side that reached the semi-finals\n\nCotterill's foundation could also face a probe due to his listing as a director.
