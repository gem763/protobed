Sondland is due to give his version of events on Thursday.\n\nAccording to Fox News, Hill told congressional investigators that she and other officials went to the national security council lawyer with their concerns that the White House was seeking to prompt Ukraine to open investigations into Trump\u2019s rivals.\n\nHill\u2019s lawyer had earlier rejected arguments from the president\u2019s attorneys that her testimony on Ukraine was covered by executive privilege.\n\nFormer White House adviser on Russia Fiona Hill leaves Capitol Hill after testifying before congressional lawmakers.
