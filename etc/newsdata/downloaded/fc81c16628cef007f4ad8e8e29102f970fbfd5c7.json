Whether it\u2019ll actually last as long as Messenger has remains to be seen.\n\nThe app is camera-first, meaning your own face is likely to be the first thing you see upon entering the app. You can quickly take a picture and shoot it off to a friend. Users have access to Instagram\u2018s suite of photo- and video-editing features, so it\u2019s pretty much the same as sending a DM on Instagram itself.\n\nUsers can also share one-word statuses accompanied by an emoji \u2014 which used to be a big thing on Facebook before it kind of fizzled out. If need be, you can set Threads to \u201cauto-status,\u201d which apparently preemptively tells friends what you\u2019re up to (never thought I\u2019d see the day when you could be both lazy and give TMI, but there you go).\n\nCredit: Instagram\n\nWe first heard about Threads in August, when reports circulated that Facebook was testing the new app internally. The primary difference between Threads and Instagram proper is that it\u2019s strictly for communicating with Close Friends \u2014 by which I mean the feature introduced last year that allows users to share Stories privately with a curated list of best pals. You can only use Threads with the people on this list. If you don\u2019t have one, you\u2019ll be prompted to create one when you open the app for the first time.\n\nThreads isn\u2019t a terrible idea at first glance. There\u2019s a large subset of Instagrammers for whom the app is their primary social media. So, in that respect, it makes sense to invest in a dedicated DM app. Facebook did it with Messenger, and it seems to have worked out alright for them. Also, Instagram proper has become a platform for cultivating an audience, so creating a separate space just for your nearest and dearest might be helpful for those users with a large following \u2014 a sort of separation of the public and private.\n\nCredit: Instagram\n\nBut it\u2019s definitely starting at a bit of a disadvantage. For starters, it needs to differentiate itself enough from Instagram to justify its use. Messages you get in Threads will still appear in your Instagram Direct inbox. And the former is not going to offer a long list of potential correspondents. Instagram\u2018s director of product, Robby Stein, told The Verge that the average user who has a Close Friends list only has about one-to-two dozen people on it.\n\nWhy not just\u2026 keep using Instagram Direct? Getting a new app strictly for communicating with a handful of buddies seems like a bit of a hassle. The last time I downloaded an app on which I had so few people to talk to, I was reviewing Vero.\n\nThreads rolls out globally starting today; download it now on Android and iOS.\n\nRead next: The Mars Rover's SoundCloud is lit", "description": "Instagram is launching Threads, the dedicated chat app specifically for sending photos and videos with your close friends.", "authors": ["Rachel Kaser"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FInstagram-Threads.jpg&signature=f33054908417efd8f8628b319ecb0358", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
