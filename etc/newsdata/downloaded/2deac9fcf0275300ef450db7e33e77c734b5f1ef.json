Another victory on Sunday will see the five-time champion secure his third in a row and hand Mercedes their fourth successive Singapore success.\n\nFerrari, on a high after winning two races on the trot with the second of those in front of their passionate home fans in Monza, could face a reality check.\n\nTheir hopes could rest on the weather or a safety car, which has made an appearance in every race Singapore has hosted since it joined the calendar in 2008.\n\nVettel who was involved in a multi-car start line crash that cost him victory in 2017, will have to stay out of trouble.\n\nThe German four-times champion was sanctioned after spinning out and rejoining the track in a dangerous manner in Italy and is now only three penalty points away from a one-race ban.\n\n\u201cAfter two positive weekends in Belgium and Italy, the race in Singapore doesn\u2019t look as good on paper for us,\u201d said Monegasque Charles Leclerc, winner in Belgium and Italy.\n\n\u201cIt might be a more difficult weekend for us, but we will give our all to have a good result.\u201d\n\nRed Bull may be Mercedes\u2019 closest challengers.\n\nRelated Coverage Formula One statistics for the Singapore Grand Prix\n\nSingapore has tended to suit the team\u2019s typically nimble chassis, with the former champions finishing second for the last five years.\n\nMax Verstappen, who battled Hamilton hard for victory in Hungary and was runner-up to the Briton last year, will be eyeing Sunday as an opportunity to go one better.\n\nHis rookie team mate Alexander Albon, who has made a strong start to his Red Bull career, will also aim to impress in the closest race the British-born Thai has to a home appearance in Asia.", "description": "Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton can return Mercedes to the top of the podium this Sunday with an unprecedented fifth win around the floodlit streets of Singapore.", "authors": ["Abhishek Takle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431199504&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0RG", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
