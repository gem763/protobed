The lucrative relationship between the league and China has been damaged since the Houston Rockets general manager, Daryl Morey, tweeted in support of the protestors earlier this month. Morey subsequently deleted the tweet but China has threatened to cut ties with the NBA, and some Chinese companies have backed out of broadcasts and sponsorship deals.\n\nOn Tuesday, a group of around 200 gathered on courts amid Hong Kong\u2019s high-rise buildings, chanting support for Morey and obscene epithets about James. One person threw a ball at a photo of James while others burned and trampled on jerseys bearing his name.\n\n\u201cPeople are angry,\u201d said James Lo, a web designer who runs a Hong Kong basketball fan page on Facebook. He said he\u2019s already received a video from a protester that showed him burning a No 23 jersey bearing James\u2019 name.\n\nOn Monday, James was asked about the strained relationship between the NBA and China. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get into a ... feud with Daryl but I believe he wasn\u2019t educated about the situation at hand and he spoke,\u201d James said. \u201cJust be careful what we tweet ... even though, yes, we do have freedom of speech. But there can be a lot of negative that comes with that too.\u201d James later said he meant Morey wasn\u2019t educated on the repercussions of the tweet rather than the situation in Hong Kong. Law enforcement have used live ammunition on civilians after months of demonstrations in Hong Kong.\n\nLo said James\u2019s comments had infuriated many in Hong Kong. \u201cStudents, they come out like every weekend,\u201d said Lo. \u201cThey\u2019ve got tear gassed and then they got gun-shot, like every weekend. Police beating students and then innocent people, like every day. And then he just comes up with something [like] that. We just can\u2019t accept that.\u201d\n\nDemonstrators in Hong Kong set light to a LeBron James jersey during a rally. Photograph: Mark Schiefelbein/AP\n\nNBA players weren\u2019t made available before or after recent pre-season games in China, which CCTV didn\u2019t broadcast, and several companies and state-run offices reportedly severed their ties with the NBA over Morey\u2019s tweet and the league\u2019s response to it.\n\nProtesters said James was guilty of double standards, because he has used his influence as a star athlete to promote social causes in the United States. \u201cPlease remember, all NBA players, what you said before: \u2018Black lives matter.\u2019 Hong Kong lives also matter!\u201d one of the protesters, 36-year-old office worker William Mok, said as he addressed the crowd.\n\nYahoo Sports estimates that the dispute with China could depress the league\u2019s salary cap \u2013 and therefore NBA wages \u2013 by up to 15% next season. Some protestors thought James\u2019s comments had more to do with money than politics. \u201cJames was trying, you know, to take a side, on the China side, which is like ridiculous,\u201d said Aaron Lee, a 36-year-old marketing director. \u201cHe was being honest, financially. Financial is money. Simple as that. LeBron James stands for money. Period.\u201d\n\n-Haven\u2019t seen or talked to my family 5 years\n\n-Jailed my dad\n\n-My siblings can\u2019t find jobs\n\n-Revoked my passport\n\n-International arrest warrant\n\n-My family can\u2019t leave the country\n\n-Got Death Threats everyday\n\n-Got attacked, harassed\n\n-Tried to kidnap me in Indonesia\n\n\n\nFREEDOM IS NOT FREE \u2014 Enes Kanter (@EnesKanter) October 15, 2019\n\nOne NBA player has appeared to voice support for the protestors in Hong Kong. The Boston Celtics\u2019 Enes Kanter, who is exiled from his native Turkey due to his opposition to the country\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, tweeted a list of issues he has faced due to his political beliefs. They include seeing his father imprisoned and having his passport revoked. At the end of the tweet he wrote \u201cFREEDOM IS NOT FREE\u201d.", "description": "%27LeBron%20stands%20for%20money%27%3A%20Hong%20Kong%20protesters%20burn%20James%20jerseys%20%7C%20LeBron%20James%20%7C%20The%20Guardian", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
