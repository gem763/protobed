The board has therefore decided to exit the markets in an orderly manner,' he said.\n\nDomino's Pizza is set to pull the plug on it sizeable international operations, it said today\n\nOverseas sales slumped 2.7 per cent to \u00a325million in the past three months as it started to sell off stores. The international division was expected to break even this year, but losses have spiralled in several markets.\n\nWayne Brown, an analyst at Liberum, said the retreat was 'likely to be complex', but will give the firm space to refocus on its UK and Ireland operation, which also faces challenges as a dispute with some of its franchisees rolls on and puts the breaks on new store openings.\n\nIn May, Domino's said talks were ongoing after franchisees protested against receiving a smaller cut of the profits.\n\nWild, who has held the top job at the pizza chain since 2014 and is set to step down, said: 'Normal working practices continue to be impacted by our franchisee dispute.\n\n'As we said at our interim results, this situation is complex and we expect a resolution to take time, certainly into 2020. We remain committed to working with our franchisees to agree sustainable win-win solutions.'\n\nThe firm said the search for Wild's successor, as well as a new chair, is ongoing.\n\nRuss Mould from AJ Bell said that Domino's may have had 'eyes bigger than their stomachs'\n\nIn the past three months, the company's UK and Ireland sales gained pace, growing 3.9 per cent to \u00a3288million.\n\nDomino's has recently felt the heat from fresh competition in the industry, such as Deliveroo and Uber Eats, which continue to eat into the takeaway market.\n\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said that Domino's may have had 'eyes bigger than their stomachs' when it came to expanding into overseas territories 'which have unfortunately resulted in indigestion'.\n\nHe added, however, that pulling out is 'the sensible thing to do'.\n\n'Management should be applauded for making the decision to pull out rather than digging themselves a bigger hole,' he said.\n\n'There is now a real opportunity to fix Domino's which has lost its way in recent years thanks to over-expansion, deteriorating relationships with franchisees, international woes and heightened competition.'\n\nShares advanced by more than 3 per cent in early trading to \u00a32.80.", "description": "Outgoing chief executive David Wild said today that, following a review of the division - which spans\u00a0Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland - the firm is better off selling out.", "authors": ["Emily Hardy For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
