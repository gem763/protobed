The Slovenian then bizarrely raced Dennis to the line.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"It's been a long route to get here since July,\" Dennis, who pointed to his head at the finish, told a news conference held in a church. \"There are a lot of people to thank. It's not just been tough for me, it's been tough for them too.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nCONFIDENCE BACK\n\nAsked about his odd build-up to the Championships, Dennis said; \"The confidence did not come until very late in my preparation. It wasn't until Sept. 15 when I nailed a training session and that's when the confidence came up.\n\n\"That was a real turning-point. It was about getting the mental side to really be back in that fold of not caring too much. When I was riding I was thinking negatively and that was effecting my training. My coach Neal Henderson has tried to help me through thinking I wasn't good enough.\n\n\"Confidence is a huge part of time trialling. Today I was just zoning out, counting the pedal strokes for an hour. It's just about going to a special place of pain.\"\n\nAdelaide-born Dennis, a former Hour record holder, said his wife had sent him a photo of his baby son on the morning of the race, helping him keep everything in perspective.\n\n\"When I saw that picture I thought this is just a bike race,\" he said. \"It's nice to win but when I'm 65 this won't be in my top 10 things that happened in my life.\"\n\nDennis hopes to have a few more years in the 'top seat' and will be gunning for gold in Tokyo but admitted times are a changing, pointing to 19-year-old Evenepoel alongside him.\n\nEvenepoel, already being likened to Belgian great Eddy Merckx after winning the European TT title and the San Sebastian Classic in his first year as a pro, is the youngest medallist ever in the event and said his silver \"felt like a gold\".\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Martyn Herman,; Editing by Christian Radnedge and Ed Osmond)", "description": "Australian Rohan Dennis admits he has been in a dark place since going AWOL at this year's Tour de France but he emerged from a cloud of self-doubt to win the UCI Road World Championships time trial on Wednesday for a second successive year.
