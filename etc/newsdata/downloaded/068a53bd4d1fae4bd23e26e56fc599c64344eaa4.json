The fact that it will begin growing again should not be read as an effort to stimulate the economy, Powell said, but rather to meet the public's demand for cash, bank demand for reserves and to carry out other core Fed functions.\n\nMarkets have been waiting for the Fed to decide what permanent policies it might put in place to avoid the sort of disruption that occurred recently, when reserve shortages pushed the target federal funds rate to the top of the range set by the central bank - a situation that could disrupt the Fed's goals for monetary policy if it became a regular feature of financial markets.", "description": "Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell said as global risks evolve the Fed would move \"as appropriate\" to keep the decade-old US expansion under way.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2577%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_276%2C$y_60/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/23e83b9a6b51deee026f0f480878cd70ad125579", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
