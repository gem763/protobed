Stalemate in 8th day; Trump arrives", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE President Donald Trump was in Chicago on Monday for a speech and fundraiser, and a crowd of protesters numbering well into the thousands gathered outside Trump Hotel and Tower in Chicago. (Oct. 28) AP, AP\n\nCHICAGO \u2014 Negotiators have met for 22 straight days. Students have missed eight days of school and counting. And still the Chicago teachers' strike presses on.\n\nPublic school teachers and city officials started the week at loggerheads over money for classrooms, as families in the nation's third-largest city again had to find options for around 350,000 kids who are still missing class.\n\nThe main issue: The Chicago Teachers Union says it can eke out more concessions from the city, especially related to teachers' prep time. City officials say they've made plenty of concessions and can't flex the budget anymore.\n\nOne bright spot: The city has reached a tentative agreement with the union representing 7,500 school support staff, who have been striking alongside some 25,000 CPS teachers. But that won't restart classes.\n\nAmid the strike, President Donald Trump came to town: A fundraiser, and a tenuous meeting with Chicago police\n\nWhat's the hangup between the city and the teachers' union?\n\nA strike lasting eight school days \u2014 headed to nine on Tuesday \u2014 is long even by recent standards, as teacher walkouts have gained momentum around the country. (A strike in January in Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest school district, lasted six school days.) It's reportedly the longest teacher strike Chicago has seen since 1987, when teachers demonstrated for 19 days.\n\nEducators, students, and union laborers rally at Union Park during the Chicago Teachers Union strike Saturday, Oct. 26, 2019, in Chicago. (Photo: Tyler LaRiviere, AP)\n\nThe major hangup in Chicago: City officials say they've offered the union more money \u2014 at least $500 million more than what's being spent now, by the time the contract would reach its fifth year. That would go toward reducing class sizes and teacher raises. City officials also say in 22 straight days of negotiations, they put many of the union's other requests into the contract language \u2014 a major talking point for the union before the strike.\n\nBut the union says the offer doesn't go far enough to address the deep needs of Chicago Public Schools children.\n\n\"We are enormously disappointed that CTU simply cannot take yes for an answer,\" Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a news conference Sunday night.\n\nIn a tweet Sunday night, CPS said the offer includes $110 million to provide a nurse and social worker in every school. The district said it also has offered $25 million to lower class sizes. City officials say they have offered to prioritize lowering class sizes in the most high-poverty schools.\n\nEarlier tonight, CTU rejected a nearly half-billion dollar offer. In addition to double-digit raises for all staff, our offer included another 110M to provide a nurse and social worker for every school, and prioritized support for high-need schools. #PutItInWritingpic.twitter.com/aIhWhqTPGq \u2014 ChicagoPublicSchools (@ChiPubSchools) October 28, 2019\n\nThe union, however, says the class size remedy only addresses one-third of Chicago's public schools.\n\nCPS will finally remedy class size for 1/3 of CPS schools. That's great. That's equity. But as VP @stacydavisgates said last night, \"I don't go into a classroom and decide to teach 1/3 [of the students]. I go into a classroom and I have to educate everyone who sits there.\" \u2014 ChicagoTeachersUnion (@CTULocal1) October 28, 2019\n\nUnion officials also want elementary teachers to have a 30-minute period in the morning for collaborative preparation time. They say that's a huge sticking point in the current negotiations.\n\n\"The district continues to refuse to restore morning preps,\" the Chicago Teachers Union posted on its Facebook page Monday.\n\nSupport for unions? Even when teachers strike, Americans give them high grades, poll shows. Unions fare worse\n\nHow might the strike end?\n\nCity officials say there's a cost associated with that prep time \u2014 for example, they'd have to pay teachers for a longer school day if they didn't want to cut out instructional time. And if the prep time is the top priority, the union has to accept less money for some of its other requests.\n\nBut teachers could agree to less of a salary increase in exchange for the collaborative prep time.\n\n'Can't pay their bills with love': In many teaching jobs, teachers' salaries can't cover rent\n\nDespite the back-and-forth over continuing to cancel class, negotiations are \"toward the end,\" said Katie Osgood, a member of the union\u2019s bargaining team.\n\n\"We have come a long way, in terms of where we were. Before we went on strike, we were told: \u2018There\u2019s no way you\u2019ll ever get class size, staffing for social workers, nurses, special education case managers,'\" Osgood said. \"Now, we\u2019re actually talking about what those improvements will look like. ... We\u2019re just a small amount of money away.\"\n\nThe strike that started it all: How a West Virginia teacher\u2019s Facebook post started a national movement\n\nWhat about Trump's visit to Chicago?\n\nA flurry of protests broke out across the city Monday. Dozens of teachers started the day on the picket lines and traveled to an afternoon rally across from Chicago's Trump Tower, where hundreds of demonstrators gathered to protest President Donald Trump's visit.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks at the International Association of Chiefs of Police Convention Monday, Oct. 28, 2019, in Chicago. (Photo: Charles Rex Arbogast, AP)\n\nDennis Kass, a high school sociology teacher in Little Village on the city's West Side, said many Trump administration policies have negatively impacted his students, who are predominantly immigrants. Kass said he was eager to return to his classroom as soon as possible.\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of students flooded City Hall in support of striking teachers, holding signs and chanting: \"Show me what democracy looks like! This is what democracy looks like!\"\n\nThread:\n\nWe\u2019re all over the city today! Some of us went to turn up on Lori at city hall for a #FairContractNow, some went to #FreedomSchool with @KAFreedomSchoo1 & the rest of us heading to go shut #Trump down! We want justice in Chicago so that\u2019s why we fight!#GoodKidsMadCitypic.twitter.com/9f4rcmyjfa \u2014 GoodKidsMadCity (@GKMC18) October 28, 2019\n\nWhy can't Chicago spend more on its schools? Is the district broke?\n\nThe teachers' union is insisting on more money for schools in part because a recent change in the state's funding formula brought an additional $1 billion or so to Chicago's schools.\n\nBut city and district leaders say most of that money has gone toward stabilizing teacher pensions and paying for universal pre-kindergarten and other academic programs.\n\nIn a recent opinion piece in the Chicago Sun-Times, CPS CEO Janice Jackson said that the district is still recovering from being on the brink of insolvency two years ago. She said the district's overall budget is $7.7 billion and it's borrowing another $1.5 billion to stay afloat.\n\nUnion leaders say the city can absolutely afford the remaining concessions they want. Lightfoot has found the money to fund other projects around the city, they say.\n\nIt should only cost CPS another $38 million to meet the union's requests, union President Jesse Sharkey said in a statement Monday. The city has \"misplaced priorities,\" he said.\n\nAre unions back?: GM, Chicago teacher strikes show how unions can start winning again\n\nHow have other school districts managed to end a strike?\n\nThis strike differs from other teacher walkouts around the country in part because of Lightfoot's insistence on sticking with her set budget.\n\nChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot reads a book to children at Breakthrough, a nonprofit that partners with those affected by poverty, on Day One of the Chicago teachers strike. (Photo: Rick Wood, USA TODAY NETWORK/MILWAUKEE JOUR)\n\nIn other teacher strikes, sometimes districts agree to things they can't currently afford, then figure out how to pay for them later. For example, the Los Angeles teachers' strike was resolved in part when school officials agreed to pay for class-size reductions and said they'd figure out how to pay for it later, either by a special kind of tax or some other ballot measure to be approved by voters.\n\nDistricts also have pursued staff layoffs after a strike to balance the budget.\n\nThose kinds of moves are irresponsible, Chicago city officials said, and the city needs to live within its means.\n\n\"Taxpayers have said loud and clear that they do not want a property tax increase,\" Lightfoot said Sunday night.\n\nWhat else makes the Chicago strike unusual?\n\nCity officials still say the major reason the strike has dragged on is because a team of 45 rank-and-file teachers are holding up negotiations. They say the union's top leadership, which is elected, has to take each of the offers back to this team for approval before the offers can be voted on by the entire membership.\n\nThat's not the reason for the holdup, union officials say. They said the union leadership ran on a platform of more democracy, and the city has declined their offer to bargain openly so the public can see what's happening.\n\nUnion officials also say they've seen overwhelming support for the strike and for holding out for more money to pay to improve conditions in classrooms.\n\n\"We're bargaining for the public good,\" said union spokesperson Chris Geovanis.\n\nWhat's the contract deal for the 7,500 school staff?\n\nSchool staff such as bus aides and custodians represented by the Service Employees International Union Local 73 on Sunday night announced a tentative deal with the city.\n\n\"The lowest paid support workers who are the backbone of our schools are going to see raises that mean their families won't have to struggle living in an expensive city where costs keep going up,\" said Dian Palmer, president of SEIU Local 73, in a statement.\n\nSalaries were low: Chicago schools strike is for aides living off less than $36,000 a year, union members say\n\nThe tentative agreement, which will expire in 2023, must be approved by a majority of the membership. Members will vote Monday and Tuesday, Palmer said.\n\nBut at this point, the SEIU deal won't restart classes: SEIU workers are expected to remain on the picket lines until CTU also reaches a deal with City Hall.\n\nHauck reported from Chicago.\n\nEducation coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.
