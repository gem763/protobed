Sorry Microsoft, it\u2019s true!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like breaking up these tech companies will revive mainstream businesses around the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd as the parent of two young children, I\u2019m particularly concerned about screen use and its effect on our children. Studies clearly show that we\u2019re seeing record levels of anxiety and depression coincident with smartphone adoption and social media use.\u201d\n\n\u201cBreaking up the tech companies does nothing to make our kids healthier. What we have to do is we have to hone in on the specific problems we\u2019re trying to solve and use 21st-century solutions for 21st-century problems. Using a 20th-century antitrust framework will not work. We need new solutions and a new toolkit.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Warren responded to Yang\u2019s remarks, stating \u201cI\u2019m not willing to give up and let a handful of monopolists dominate our economy and our democracy. It\u2019s time to fight back.\u201d\n\nShe went on to slam Amazon for its domination of America\u2019s retail market, and the way it crowds out competition from small businesses.\n\n\u201cThink about it this way \u2014 when you talk about it this way when you talk about how it works, and competition. About eight percent [to] nine percent of retail sales in bricks and sticks stores happen at Walmart. About 49 percent of all sales online happen in one place \u2014 that\u2019s Amazon. It collects information from every little business. And then Amazon does something else \u2014 it runs the platform, gets all the information, and then goes into competition with those little businesses.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou get to be the umpire in the baseball or you get to be a team, but you don\u2019t get to do both at the same time. We need to enforce our antitrust laws, break up these giant companies that are dominating big tech, big pharma, big oil \u2014 all of them.\u201d\n\nWhereas Tulsi Gabbard has been consistent on the question of censorship, criticizing big tech companies for \u201cthrowing free speech out the window,\u201d Warren has flip-flopped on the issue. She condemned Facebook for its power to \u201cshut down debate\u201d after it removed an ad for her campaign in March this year, but a few months later called for tech companies to censor criticism of Kamala Harris.\n\nAre you an insider at Google, Facebook, Twitter or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
