Directors\u2019 deals can point you towards whether the men and women at the top have enough confidence to buy into their firm, or so little that they are selling out.\n\nInvesting with those who have 'skin in the game' is one of the popular philosophies of world-famous investor Warren Buffett\n\nThe idea of backing firms where the bosses are invested is a long-held one and the world's most famous investor Warren Buffett increased the popularity of of 'skin in the game' as an investing philosophy.\n\nWhen a director buys shares in the company they work at, this can sometimes be viewed as a green light for investors to follow suit.\n\nSimilarly, if directors are selling their shareholdings quicker than goods leave shelves in a Black Friday sales frenzy, you might want to think about getting out too.\n\nBut you also need to remember that, as with any indicator, director dealing should not be taken in isolation - and can raise plenty of false flags.\n\nSimon McGarry, senior equity analyst at Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management, said: 'It\u2019s a very important indicator when you have a management team that ultimately are aligned with their shareholders. That is what you want.\n\n'You don\u2019t want a management team paying themselves a lot whether it\u2019s a salary or cash bonus yet not holding much equity. You want to invest in a business that has done a good job creating value in the long term for shareholders and back themselves'.\n\nCanaccord Genuity Wealth Management ran a screen to look for companies with the greatest amount of director buying and selling in September and October so far, which we feature in the tables below. It found that TalkTalk saw the most buys, with Diageo second and NMC Health third.\n\nFIRMS WITH THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF DIRECTOR BUYING Company Purchases in last two months \u00a3M Sales in last two months \u00a3M Net purchases / sales \u00a3M TALKTALK TEL 10,364,171 - 10,364,171 DIAGEO PLC 13,092,140 6,172,516 6,919,623 NMC HEALTH 3,624,029 - 3,624,029 BT GROUP PLC 3,576,723 - 3,576,723 CONVATEC GROUP P 3,275,620 1,164,348 2,111,272 STANDARD CHARTER 2,821,873 1,069,856 1,752,017 BARRATT DEV 3,257,120 1,533,155 1,723,965 RIGHTMOVE 5,221,857 3,743,511 1,478,346 HAYS PLC 5,105,777 3,773,963 1,331,814 GENUS PLC 2,117,202 987,614 1,129,587 TRITAX BIG BOX R 1,101,843 - 1,101,843 BARCLAYS PLC 1,995,415 924,844 1,070,571 SAGE GROUP 1,027,317 57,946 969,370 NEXT PLC 827,006 - 827,006 IMPERIAL BRANDS 480,999 - 480,999 AVIVA PLC 416,897 - 416,897 PEARSON PLC 507,515 161,356 346,159 ADMIRAL GROUP 1,843,571 1,500,455 343,116 REDROW PLC 2,918,820 2,585,817 333,003 RESTAURANT GROUP 330,574 - 330,574 KELLER GROUP PLC 328,860 - 328,860 WETHERSPOON (JD) 596,147 313,745 282,402 ROYAL DUTCH SH-B 277,049 - 277,049 INTERNATIONAL PE 277,000 - 277,000 HSBC HOLDINGS PL 436,308 164,214 272,094 SAFESTORE HOLDIN 247,011 - 247,011 ANGLO AMER PLC 180,234 - 180,234 MERLIN 313,083 147,519 165,565 INCHCAPE PLC 195,493 40,024 155,469 HALFORDS GRP PLC 154,501 - 154,501 INTERMEDIATE CAP 145,500 - 145,500 MAN GROUP PLC/JE 141,696 - 141,696 PENNON GRP PLC 141,227 - 141,227 MARKS & SPENCER 138,640 - 138,640 FIRSTGROUP PLC 243,452 114,730 128,722 PRUDENTIAL PLC 115,495 - 115,495 HAMMERSON PLC 114,024 - 114,024 PARAGON BANKING 14,472 120,600 -106,128 SEVERN TRENT - 113,403 -113,403 DS SMITH PLC - 327,486 -327,486 MILLENNIUM & COP 227,597 569,920 -342,323 UNILEVER PLC 82,299 438,144 -355,845 TESCO PLC 1,325,821 1,735,753 -409,932 UNITED UTILITIES 461,787 903,574 -441,786 DIRECT LINE INSU 54,477 580,167 -525,689 BAE SYSTEMS PLC 269,502 883,819 -614,318 LLOYDS BANKING 472,982 1,451,303 -978,321 SCHRODERS PLC 117,158 1,235,689 -1,118,531 HISCOX LTD 51,277 1,788,218 -1,736,941 CLARKSON PLC - 1,837,500 -1,837,500 DERWENT LONDON - 2,929,144 -2,929,144 HIKMA PHARMACEUT - 3,300,000 -3,300,000 DECHRA PHARMA 2,605,186 7,622,906 -5,017,720 BERKELEY GROUP - 14,113,110 -14,113,110 ASHMORE GROUP 346,347 15,526,347 -15,180,000 Source: Canaccord Genuity Wealth Management, September 2019 to 10 October 2019\n\nThe idea behind checking up on director share purchases is simple. They know the firm they work for and its prospects and backing it to a greater degree than they already do is a sign of confidence that things are on the up.\n\nDan Coatsworth, stock market analyst at AJ Bell, said: 'Directors should know a business better than anyone else so buying and selling of shares can send a strong signal to the market.\n\n'A chief executive, chairman, finance director or operations director will see data on sales, costs and various key performance indicators. They will be involved in strategy meetings and know if a company is achieving its goals or not.\n\nThey should also be able to spot if something bad is coming up and whether a company has major challenges to overcome.\n\n'So when a director buys shares, it suggests they are very confident about the future of a business. Equally, when they sell shares one has to wonder if they know something we don\u2019t.'\n\nThere are exceptions of course. People are aware that directors\u2019 deals are a good indicator of share price value and movement, so a cynic could say this is a variable that could be manipulated if a company wants to sway public opinion.\n\nIn fact, one of the first things that often happens after a bout of bad news is that senior directors buy chunks of shares, knowing the market will see this as a positive sign.\n\nBut some directors might pile their money into their business, but just as quickly take it out again when people are paying less attention.\n\nBut Coatsworth added: 'Sometimes directors buy after a share has slumped in a show of faith in the business, but often these transactions amount to no more than publicity stunts and are often small in monetary terms.'\n\nAJ Bell's Coatsworth said a director buying shares suggests they are confident about its future, while Canaccord's McGarry said they may sell for personal reasons\n\nWhat does it mean if a director sells their shares?\n\nAs buying can often indicate a positive outlook for the company, it is easy to think a director selling their shares can mean something less positive.\n\nMcGarry said: 'As an investor this isn't something you'd particularly want to see. If a certain director, for example the chief executive, sells their shares it may be the beginning of them starting to step back.\n\n'This could potentially be bad news if that person has had a particularly good impact on the business' success since they worked there.'\n\nBut it's important to remember any sale of shares might not necessarily reflect what is happening at the company at all, and rather a personal issue.\n\n'When people have most of their wealth tied up in a business and they need cash for whatever reason, then they have no choice but to sell their shares \u2013 divorce payments are quite a common reason for this,' said McGarry.\n\n'What also gets misreported is when shareholders have to sell shares in order to simply pay tax. Sometimes you get an explanation and sometimes you don\u2019t but often the damage is done when someone makes a large sale but the reasoning doesn't get reported until later.'\n\nIt's also important to remember that directors can only buy or sell at certain times of the year.\n\nCoatsworth added: 'They cannot deal in a closed period which is when financial accounts are being prepared. They also cannot buy or sell if there is undisclosed inside information, such as news of a possible takeover or a big contract win or loss.'\n\nDo certain companies have more 'skin in the game'?\n\nOf course not every director is invested in their own company and some companies may not have any internal investment at all - though this is rare.\n\nOften, smaller companies will have a higher rate of skin in the game than larger companies for example.\n\nMcGarry said: 'It comes back to tenure of the management team. My instinct would say smaller businesses have more skin in the game because they have more founder-run management teams or teams that have been a long time.\n\n'It is unusual for a FTSE 100 CEO to have been there for more than seven or eight years. But then in relative terms, a FTSE 100 CEO will be getting paid more than FTSE 250 CEO so they may have a larger stake based on that.'\n\nHow can I chec k directors' dealings in a company?\n\nDirectors\u2019 buys and sells have to be reported to the stock market so it is easy to find out who is doing what via RNS feeds.
