Or that optimism doesn\u2019t even begin to describe the claims of environmental impact. Pay no attention, even, to the fact that a precedent \u2014 just south of the border \u2014 has been set on precisely how not to implement cleaner gas. Quebec\u2019s new government is thinking about implementing new fuel standards and the result just might clog your fuel line.\n\nFirst, the news flash. According to an article in La Presse on October 4, the ruling Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec (CAQ) is thinking about tripling the amount of ethanol required in fuel from today\u2019s five per cent to a whopping 15 per cent by 2025. In making the announcement, Jonatan Julien claimed that the changes would eliminate two million megatonnes of greenhouse gasses, the equivalent, said the province\u2019s minister of energy and natural resources, of taking 500,000 cars off the road.\n\nUhm, that would be, according to my back-of-the-napkin calculations, akin to converting one tenth of all the cars currently registered in our French Canadian outpost to full zero-emission, battery-powered EVs. Just by putting a little more grain alcohol in our gas? Wow! Why are we even bothering with an EV mandate when such a potent solution is so readily available?\n\nIndeed, so wonky are the government\u2019s calculations that those two million megatonnes of emissions reduced represent roughly 12.5 per cent of all the GHGs produced by all the cars and light trucks currently on Quebec roads. Imagine that, a 12.5 per cent reduction when you are simply upping the ethanol content by 10 per cent.\n\nTo get an idea of how, uhm, abstract these calculations might be \u2014 and I apologize if the following nerdiness brings back the horrors of high school chemistry \u2014 consider the following: According to Daniel Ciolkosz, an assistant professor in Penn State\u2019s Department of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, the chemical formula for ethanol \u2014 C2H6O \u2014 means that a molecule of ethanol contains about 52 per cent carbon. Gasoline, meanwhile, is comprised of 87 per cent carbon. Now, I am certainly simplifying the matter grossly, but that\u2019s an admirable(but still not carbon free) 40 per cent less carbon.\n\nExcept that, thanks to something called energy density \u2014 and I apologize for also turning this into a math seminar \u2014 you need to burn about 30 per cent more ethanol to produce the same power as gasoline. Net it all out, and theoretically, ethanol could reduce emissions by some 30 per cent. In other words,a 10 per cent increase in ethanol use might get you a reduction in GHG emissions of three per cent.\n\nOK, so perhaps the reduction in greenhouse gasses won\u2019t be quite as dramatic as envisioned, but at least it will be easy. Just pour some readily-available ethanol into our gasoline stockpiles and your uncle Bob is suddenly an environmentalist, instant emissions reduction. The Quebec Association for the Production of Renewable Energy certainly thinks so, telling La Presse that \u201cQuebec will give itself the means to reduce its emissions,\u201d implying \u2014 at least, I am reading it this way \u2014 that the province will produce its own ethanol.\n\nExcept that fuel-grade ethanol isn\u2019t readily available in Quebec. In fact, according to Pierre-Olivier Pineau, a professor at the university of HEC Montreal and the chair in its Energy Sector Management, at the current five per cent blend, Quebec produces only two per cent of the ethanol it uses. The rest is imported, much of it from the U.S.\n\nImporting ethanol from Trump-land, meanwhile, brings its own controversies. For one, 95 per cent of all American ethanol is produced from corn. In fact, some 40 per cent of America\u2019s entire corn crop is directed to ethanol production. Not only do critics decry the attendant increase in the price of feedstock and consumer products that brings, but others \u2014 Scientific American among them \u2014 contend that \u201ccorn is no better \u2013 and might be worse \u2013 than petroleum when total greenhouse gas emissions are considered. Yet, with production of corn-based fuel slated to in crease to 36 billion-with-a-b gallons \u2014 more than 136 billion litres \u2014 by 2022, ethanol is big money, big business, and especially as it pertains to convincing politicians that grain alcohol is smart environmental policy, big lobbying.\n\nThen there\u2019s something called net energy balance, and here too, the use of corn as a fuel is controversial. Essentially, what a fuel\u2019s energy balance does is compare how much energy it takes to produce a specific fuel to the amount of energy that that fuel produces. In other words, the less energy required to produce, refine, and distribute a fuel compared with the amount of energy it releases once in a gas tank, the better.\n\nIt\u2019s not hard to see the Bloc foisting its automobile emissions policies on the rest of our fair land.\n\nCorn-fed ethanol doesn\u2019t fare well in this calculation. At least a few scientists think corn is energy negative, meaning it takes more energy to produce than is released in our engines. Even favourable ratings still have corn only modestly energy positive, one unit of energy \u2018in\u2019 creating but 1.2 to 1.4 units of corn ethanol energy out.\n\nBefore you eyes roll over completely, just consider this: Brazil, which depends highly on ethanol as an automotive fuel \u2014 but produces it from sugar cane \u2014 gets about 8 units of energy from every unit used to process its favoured crop. In other words, refining ethanol from corn is extremely inefficient. So, why would anyone still derive any ethanol from corn? See my previous comments vis-a-vis the corn lobby and the 40 per cent of its constituents\u2019 crops devoted to ethanol production.\n\nAnd, lastly, there\u2019s the fact that ethanol is not particularly good for our cars and is especially toxic for classic cars. Ethanol is hygroscopic \u2014 it attracts water \u2014 which means that, over time, the ethanol in your gas will attract water, bringing with it rust and corrosion in your gas tank, fuel pump, and fuel lines if they aren\u2019t suitably protected. Furthermore, many are the gas tanks and/or carburetors left full of ethanol-blended gasoline over a winter that require a complete disassembly thanks to the gummy varnish left after ethanol-infused gasoline evaporates.\n\nFinally, I will leave those of you living in a Canadian province other than Quebec \u2014 no doubt smugly ruminating on yet another foolish notion from La Belle Province \u2014 with these cheery thoughts. There\u2019s at least an outside chance that the Bloc Quebecois could be the power broker in a soon-to-be-minority Liberal government. With Trudeau desperate to burnish his environmental bona fides \u2014 the one party platform he seemingly hasn\u2019t lied about yet \u2014 it\u2019s not hard to see the Bloc foisting its automobile emissions policies on the rest of our fair land.\n\nSleep tight.", "description": "Exaggerating environmental bona-fides has become the norm for Quebec politicians, but will the rest of Canada follow suit?", "authors": ["Hours Ago"], "top_image": "https://postmediadriving.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/gas_stations_20180105.jpg?quality=80", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
