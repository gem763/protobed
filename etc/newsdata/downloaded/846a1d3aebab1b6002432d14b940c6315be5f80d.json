Only 42% of mothers avoided giving babies stuffed animals, pillows and other soft bedding, while just 32% used cribs or other safe sleep surfaces.\n\nWhen mothers had been instructed on safe sleep practices by doctors, however, they were 12% to 28% more likely to put babies to bed in the safest ways, researchers report in Pediatrics.\n\n\u201cPlacing infants to sleep on their stomach is the most widely known risk factor for sleep-related deaths, but there are other sleep-related risks that parents need to be aware of such as side sleeping, sleeping with blankets, pillows, or other soft objects, and sleeping on shared surfaces like adult beds and couches,\u201d said Ashley Hirai, lead author of the study and a senior scientist at the Health Resources and Services Administration in Rockville, Maryland.\n\n\u201cThe safest place for babies to sleep is on their backs, on separate firm sleep surfaces (crib, bassinet, or Pack \u2018n Play) without any soft bedding (blankets, pillows, or bumper pads) and in the same room as caregivers,\u201d Hirai said.\n\nSudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) has become much less common in recent decades as doctors have urged parents to put infants to sleep on their backs without blankets or other soft bedding and toys that could pose a suffocation risk. But it remains a leading cause of infant mortality, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP).\n\nIn the current study, demographic factors like age, race, income or education levels appeared to explain some variation - about 5 to 10 percentage points - in the proportion of mothers who said doctors told them about safe sleep practices.\n\nBut demographics explained more of the variation - about 10 to 20 percentage points - in how often mothers followed the advice.\n\nThe survey questions didn\u2019t distinguish routine habits that led to unsafe infant sleep from occasional or accidental unsafe practices.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know why families are more compliant with some of these recommendations vs others,\u201d said Dr Michael Goodstein, division chief of WellSpan Neonatology and director of the York County Cribs for Kids Program.\n\n\u201cI suspect that back sleeping is one of the more commonly followed practices because we have been promoting it the longest and the \u2018back to sleep\u2019 campaign has been so successful in saving lives,\u201d said Goodstein, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\nSome knowledge gaps may also be cultural or generational, said Dr Lori Feldman-Winter of Cooper Medical School of Rowan University in Camden, New Jersey.\n\n\u201cMany caregivers, such as young mothers, or grandmothers, who may not have been reached by the \u2018back to sleep\u2019 (or safe to sleep) campaigns do not know about the importance of placing a baby on his/her back as a way to prevent SIDS,\u201d Feldman-Winter, who wasn\u2019t involved in the study, said.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "Parents are more likely to follow safe infant sleep practices when doctors tell them clearly what to do and what to avoid, to minimize the chances of babies getting injured or dying during the night, a U.S. study suggests.
