(AP/Bill Kostroun)\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Shurmur said, pursing his lips and shaking his head. \u201cI think Daniel\u2019s going to learn from everything that\u2019s going on, just like all the other rookies in there playing are going to learn from the things that happen. But you have to learn and you have to win games, and I\u2019m well aware of that. I\u2019m totally well aware of it.\u201d\n\nIs Pat Shurmur considering a change at QB?\n\n\n\n\"No.\" pic.twitter.com/DeoW78OFN4 \u2014 Giants Videos (@SNYGiants) October 21, 2019\n\nHow does Jones get back on track?\n\nSticking with Jones is certainly Shurmur\u2019s prerogative, and it has only been five games.\n\nBut there\u2019s no denying that the first-round pick has been struggling in recent weeks. In his first start, in Week 3 on the road against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Jones led New York back from an 18-point halftime deficit in a 32-31 win; he was named NFC offensive player of the week and the Giants\u2019 social media team gleefully \u2014 and prematurely gloated, directing tweets to those who questioned general manager Dave Gettleman\u2019s choice of the former Duke quarterback in the top 10.\n\nIn Jones\u2019 second start, home against Washington, he completed nearly three-quarters of his pass attempts in a 24-3 win.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut in the weeks since, he\u2019s gone 58-for-104 (55.8 percent) for 566 yards, with 3 touchdowns and 5 interceptions. Against the Cardinals, Jones fumbled three times, including on fourth-and-long from his own 33, and also on a strip-sack by Arizona\u2019s Chandler Jones in which Daniel Jones was looking left the entire time and had no idea that Chandler Jones was bearing down on him from his right.\n\nIt was one of eight sacks on the day for Arizona, highlighting the Giants\u2019 weakness on offensive line.\n\nNew York plays at Detroit this Sunday.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Jones has struggled in New York's last three games.", "authors": ["Shalise Manza Young"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pj1KYpL.q50omsINrKALaw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NzAuNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/OXISYB8yLY.cVQOuzLso5A--~B/aD0xMTQ4O3c9MTY4ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/cef844f0-f432-11e9-bb5f-1e930b8f494d", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
