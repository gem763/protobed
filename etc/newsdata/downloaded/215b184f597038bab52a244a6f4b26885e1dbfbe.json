He also claimed to be the victim of an \u201cattempted coup\u201d at the university.\n\nBut at least one of Falwell\u2019s denials is already falling apart. He denied being on the Miami party scene at the Wall club in 2014.\n\n\u201cThere was no picture snapped of me at Wall nightclub or any other nightclub,\u201d Falwell said, and claimed any image showing as much was \u201cphoto-shopped.\u201d\n\nPolitico posted the images on its website. Then, after Falwell\u2019s \u201cphoto-shop\u201d accusation, the agency that provided the pics stepped in.\n\n\u201cFor 21 years, I have maintained an impeccable reputation for documenting Miami Beach\u2019s storied social scene,\u201d wrote Seth Browarnik, founder of the World Red Eye photo agency.\n\nBrowarnik said he initially didn\u2019t know why Politico was interested in buying one of his 2014 images. When Browarnik learned that it was because Falwell was one of the partiers \u2015 and that the evangelical leader had claimed it was a fake \u2015 he searched his archives and located more pictures of Falwell and his son, Trey Falwell, then posted the images on his website.\n\nBrowarnik told The Miami Herald that Falwell\u2019s accusation had motivated him to dig through his archives to find more.\n\n\u201cIf you want to say you weren\u2019t there, fine. But going and saying I \u2019photo-shopped?\u201d he said. \u201cThis is coming after my livelihood and reputation, which is pristine.\u201d\n\nIn the Sept. 9 article, Politico reported that more than two dozen current and former Liberty University officials \u201cdescribe a culture of fear and self-dealing\u201d at the Christian college. Sources claim the conservative leader was partying in nightclubs and graphically discussing his sex life with employees.\n\nTwitter users also slammed Falwell for \u201chypocrisy,\u201d especially given that, as Politico reported, Liberty University restricts co-ed dancing and forbids drinking:\n\nPlease don't RT this trove of photos of grifting Trumpist demagogue Jerry Falwell Jr partying at Miami nightclub he swears he was never at. https://t.co/Tk379mg6yc via @POLITICO for Android \u2014 Rep.

I mean...to call Falwell a hypocrite is not fair to the rest of the normal hypocrites...#FallwellCrimeFamily \u2014 Phil Brandt (@blackhook) September 10, 2019\n\n\"Finding him in the crowd is like a \u2018Where\u2019s Waldo?'\" https://t.co/NI4CDVLJ2E \u2014 William Gallo (@GalloVOA) September 11, 2019\n\nMr. Falwell, you're not Trump. Don't double down on a lie when you're caught. Because when you do ... this happens. https://t.co/ksBEk4VBEz \u2014 Tami (Justice Time) Matthews (@geekgirlden) September 11, 2019\n\nLiberty University is notoriously strict about alcohol consumption & students can receive demerits for co-ed dancing & be expelled for drinking Me: The usual GOP example of \"do as I say & not as I do\"\n\n\n\nNew Photos Emerge of Falwell at Miami Nightclub https://t.co/1nWNxDSF1M \u2014 JoeFaz\u2122\u00ae VetsResistSquadron (@joefaz) September 11, 2019\n\nI couldn\u2019t care less about Jerry Falwell Jr being in a Miami nightclub. It\u2019s the authoritarian, fear mongering, wrapping your lies and hate in religiosity, and leading a culture of shame that inflames me. https://t.co/dgGry4bCvh \u2014 Brittany Pounders (@LibertyBritt) September 11, 2019\n\nLove HuffPost?
