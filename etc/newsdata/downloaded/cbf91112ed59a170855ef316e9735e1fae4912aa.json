(AP) - Josh Rosen believes his aggressive playing style will help him give the Miami Dolphins the lift they badly need.\n\nRosen will make his first start at quarterback for Miami on Sunday at Dallas, and he takes over an offense that ranks last in the NFL in points and yards. The Dolphins were outscored 102-10 in two games with Ryan Fitzpatrick as the starting quarterback.\n\n\u201cObviously right now we need a spark,\u201d Rosen said Friday, \u201cand I\u2019m going to try and provide that spark.\u201d\n\nRosen believes he can do it by being a bit of a gunslinger, as has been his nature since he played at UCLA. He also believes his style will work well in rookie coach Brian Flores\u2019 offense, which Rosen and his teammates are still learning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really complex system,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cI think it\u2019s only a matter of time before with enough game reps and practice reps, we\u2019ll get it down and slowly improve. I\u2019m hoping and rooting for dramatic improvement, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to go out and score 100 touchdowns and throw for a million yards. I think the key is just to keep grinding away.\u201d\n\nMiami\u2019s quarterback switch was expected at some point, with the 36-year-old Fitzpatrick never considered a long-term solution. Rosen was a first-round draft pick by Arizona in 2018 and is regarded as a possible franchise quarterback.\n\n\u201cIs there potential for that? Yeah, obviously,\u201d Flores said. \u201cBut if you start thinking about five or 10 years from now, you\u2019re not really locked in on right now. That would be my advice to Josh.\u201d\n\nRegardless of how Rosen plays, the rebuilding Dolphins are expected to use one of their three first-round picks in 2020 on a quarterback.\n\nThe Dolphins totaled 38 yards in the first three quarters of Sunday\u2019s 43-0 loss to New England. Flores said he decided to start Rosen this week because of the young QB\u2019s performance in practice Wednesday and Thursday.\n\n\u201cI think he maybe saw an opportunity and jumped at it in practice really well,\u201d Flores said. \u201cHis development is very important to me, so I never wanted to throw him in there too quickly. But I do think he\u2019s ready. He has shown me that he\u2019s ready to go.\u201d\n\nRosen said that since training camp began, he has focused on trying to improve, and not on any quarterback competition.\n\n\u201cIn coach Flo\u2019s mind, there was a threshold which would be enough for him to name me the starter,\u201d Rosen said. \u201cI just put my head down for the last couple months, and I guess I hit it.\u201d\n\nRosen went 3-10 starting as a rookie last year for the Cardinals, and became expendable in April when they used the No. 1 overall pick to draft Kyler Murray.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Josh Rosen believes his aggressive playing style will help him give the Miami Dolphins the lift they badly need.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/patriots_dolphins_football_54450_c0-172-4127-2578_s1770x1032.jpg?c5e382e961fd6dea9fa3e9c4d050c0338f79683e", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
