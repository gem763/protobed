Tinder, the largest dating app on the market right now, has about 5 million users.\n\n\u201cIn theory, given that so many people use Facebook, they could harness that population in an advantageous way,\u201d says Kevin Lewis, a sociologist at UC San Diego who has studied both Facebook and online dating. \u201cWill everyone sign up for it? If everyone did, this would be by far the biggest dating site there ever was.\u201d Great, an even bigger sea.\n\nFacebook\u2019s motivations to get into the dating game are somewhat obvious. Analysts expect dating apps to be a $20 billion business by the end of next year. Advertising, premium accounts, and other paid features on Tinder bring in the lion\u2019s share of revenue for its parent company, Match Group, which just reported a $498 million quarter and also owns Hinge, Plenty of Fish, Match.com, OkCupid, and dozens of smaller dating-related businesses. It\u2019s understandable why Facebook would want a piece of that market, especially because teens and Millennials are abandoning the social network in droves.\n\nTo use Facebook Dating\u2014and this is billed explicitly as one of the benefits\u2014you don\u2019t need to download another dating app. You enroll within the Facebook app, which I assume is still installed on your phone. Just kidding: Though a sizable majority of all Americans under 65 still have Facebook accounts, 44 percent of users ages 18 to 29 deleted the app from their phones in 2018. (Just imagine an army of horny 20-somethings scrubbing their furious #DeleteFacebook tweets in service of their love life.) Facebook Dating is free and doesn\u2019t include any advertising, and the company says it never will. But it does pull users back into Facebook\u2019s ecosystem, creating a new and very compelling reason for people\u2014especially young people\u2014to use an app they may have deserted.\n\nAnd, of course, it could be that Facebook picked this moment to get into dating because everyone else already is. Even if thousands of Tinder bios still read, cloyingly, \u201cLet\u2019s lie about where we met,\u201d conversational laziness often leads people to gesture at a stigma that isn\u2019t really there, or express discomfort with things that they\u2019re actually fine with\u2014such as dating apps, and such as downloading another dating app after they\u2019ve become jaded with the first dating app, their continued ability to return to the App Store serving as a tiny sign that their heart is still beating and they\u2019re still looking for it.\n\nThe irrepressibly genteel New York Times weddings section regularly name-checks Tinder. The presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg met his husband on Hinge. The latest Pew Research Center data, from 2016, showed that 22 percent of Americans ages 25 to 34, and 27 percent of Americans ages 18 to 24, had dated online. Eighty percent of the people who had done so said it was a good way to meet someone, and 46 percent of college graduates said they could personally name someone for whom online dating had resulted in a marriage or long-term partnership. Those numbers were all drastically higher than they had been when Pew looked into the matter just three years earlier. It\u2019s probably safe to assume that they\u2019re even higher now. Online dating has become sufficiently mainstream to be part of the most mainstream website of all time.", "description": "An app that matches people based on their offline lives is a great idea\u2014but 2019 is a strange time to have it.", "authors": ["Kaitlyn Tiffany"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/fbdating/facebook.jpg?1569960424"}
