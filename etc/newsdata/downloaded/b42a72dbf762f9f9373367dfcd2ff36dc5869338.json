ECB\u2019s Newest Policy Maker Says Latest Stimulus May Be a Mistake\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Austria\u2019s new central bank governor said that the European Central Bank\u2019s latest easing package was possibly a mistake and can be changed after incoming President Christine Lagarde takes over from Mario Draghi.\n\n\u201cAs things change -- also this forward guidance and the policy may change -- not tomorrow, not the day after tomorrow, but I wouldn\u2019t think it\u2019s there for the next decades,\u201d Robert Holzmann said in an interview with Bloomberg on Friday in Helsinki. Lagarde is not \u201ca weak person who\u2019ll say I\u2019m locked in one or the other way.\u201d\n\nHolzmann participated in his first Governing Council meeting this week after taking over from his outspoken predecessor Ewald Nowotny. He described Thursday\u2019s debate in Frankfurt as \u201cvery intense but also very constructive.\u201d\n\nDespite unprecedented opposition from within the council, Draghi pushed through the restarting of quantitative easing, a rate cut, more generous conditions for long-term loans to banks and left open the possibility for doing more.\n\nAsked if this monetary push was a mistake, Holzmann said \u201cthis idea crossed the mind of some people\u201d in the council. \u201cIt definitely crossed my mind,\u201d he added.", "description": "ECB\u2019s Newest Policy Maker Says Latest Stimulus May Be a Mistake", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED3R0M8_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
