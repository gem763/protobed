REUTERS/Luis Cortes\n\nPresident Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador\u2019s second budget since winning a landslide election victory last year aims to boost spending on social welfare programs, security and state-run oil company Pemex, while at the same time eschewing new taxes or fuel price hikes.\n\nOne of the most salient measures of Lopez Obrador\u2019s commitment to fiscal responsibility is the primary fiscal surplus of 0.7% of gross domestic product targeted in the budget for next year - below earlier targets.\n\nA preliminary budget forecast sent to lawmakers in April forecast a primary surplus of 1.3% of GDP for 2020.\n\n\u201cWe applaud the fiscal discipline and responsibility in spending,\u201d said Alfonso Ramirez Cuellar, chair of the budget committee in the lower house of Congress, which will evaluate the blueprint.\n\nAlberto Ramos, head of Latin American research at Goldman Sachs in New York, had warned that the primary fiscal surplus needed to be above 0.5% of GDP, since going below that \u201cwould signal a weakening commitment to fiscal discipline.\u201d\n\nSpeaking from the main dais of the lower house in front of two massive, draped Mexican flags, Finance Minister Arturo Herrera said around 60% of the budget is destined for fixed spending, including payments to local governments and pensions.\n\n\u201cThe remaining 40% will go to three main destinations: welfare, security and the third spot is fiscal support for Pemex,\u201d said Herrera, who noted the budget sets aside some $4.4 billion in extra funds for the ailing oil firm.\n\nPart of the funds for security will go toward the new National Guard, a security force created by Lopez Obrador to combat spiraling violence and record homicide rates.\n\nThe National Guard has placated President Donald Trump by patrolling the border to stem the flow of U.S.-bound migrants, down 56% between May and August, according to Mexican government figures on Friday.\n\nSecurity Minister Alfonso Durazo has previously said he expects the budget to set aside 56 billion pesos ($2.87 billion) for the National Guard, but that figure was not highlighted in the budget documents.\n\nThe budget blueprint calls for 59.2 billion pesos for \u201csecurity and citizen safety\u201d spending next year, around 6.5% higher than the 2019 budget.\n\nThe budget also calls for 523.4 billion pesos ($26.8 billion) for state-owned oil company Pemex, up about 9% compared to this year\u2019s level, while Herrera stressed the 86 billion pesos in extra support for the firm, including a capital injection of 46 billion pesos.\n\nThe budget blueprint estimates Pemex\u2019s year-end 2020 oil output at 1.95 million barrels per day (bpd), but it was unclear if this includes just crude or total liquids production.\n\nPemex crude production has fallen for 14 consecutive years, which has also meant less tax revenue for the government.\n\nFalling oil production and prices, as well declining resources from income and value-added taxes as Mexico\u2019s economy barely escaped entering a recession, have meant lower tax revenue.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe budget blueprint forecasts 2020 economic growth of between 1.5% and 2.5%, and total government income of 6.1 trillion pesos ($312 billion).\n\nWhile Ramirez Cuellar expressed a mostly positive view on the budget proposal, he said the committee he leads would not be a rubber stamp.\n\n\u201cI think there needs to be a greater effort in income generation,\u201d he said.", "description": "Mexico's government cautiously freed up funds for spending in its 2020 budget proposal on Sunday, slightly loosening a primary surplus target as it aimed to balance big welfare promises with the reality of a stagnant economy.", "authors": ["David Alire Garcia", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427793326&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8805E", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
