He added: \u201cAnything related to the earthquake would be speculation at this point.\"\n\nThe inferno, which began Tuesday afternoon at the NuStar Energy plant in Crockett, involved two large tanks that held ethanol, an additive used for vehicle fuel. The tanks contained at least 250,000 gallons, according to the Contra Costa Fire Department. NuStar said that that volume makes up only about 1% of the tank capacity.\n\nAnda Chu/MediaNews Group/East Bay Times via Getty Images\n\nOne of the tanks exploded, sending its roof flying into the air and then crashing to the ground. Nearby residents said the explosion was so powerful that they thought it was a second earthquake on the heels of Monday\u2019s 4.5 tremor, which hit around 15 miles from the energy plant.\n\nThick black smoke rose through the air, impeding the work of first responders. A related vegetation fire also broke out in the area, affecting approximately 14 acres.\n\nImmediately following the outbreak, NuStar enacted it\u2019s emergency response procedures, which includes cooling adjacent tanks \u201cto minimize the risk of the fire spreading\u201d and contacting all regulatory agencies, the energy facility said in a statement.\n\nContra Costa Fire, which responded to the alarm, used water and foam to fight the blaze and has since been keeping foam blankets to smother the fire and prevent oxygen from getting to the ethanol. These blankets also help to protect flareups so nearby tanks, which hold ethanol and jet fuel, don\u2019t catch fire too. Officials say these tanks are being examined to ensure structural integrity.\n\nAnda Chu/MediaNews Group/East Bay Times via Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re examining one in particular,\u201d said Hill.\n\n\u201cWe believe that it is safe. We want to make absolutely sure and so that assessment team is in there looking at that one tank right now. The rest of the tanks we were concerned about all day yesterday, we determined they maintained their structural integrity. They are safe,\u201d he continued.\n\nWhile there were no employee injuries, one NuStar employee was unable to evacuate and was forced to hid in a culvert until he was rescued by first responders. One firefighter, however, did sustain minor injuries.\n\nThe fire, which shut down both directions of Interstate 80, caused major delays during the rush hour period and forced frustrated drivers to seek alternate routes. The highway eventually reopened late Tuesday night.\n\nResidents in surrounding areas were forced to shelter in place for several hours, including children who were forced to shelter in schools as the air conditions were not safe enough to allow parents to pick up their kids. By Wednesday though, officials say there is no ongoing public health threat and the shelter in place had been lifted.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that the assessment team that is in the facility right now is doing is they are looking at a solution of mitigating the vapor emissions that are coming off of both of those where the tanks location were,\u201d said Hill.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened is the two tank\u2019s that burned were more or less destroyed in the fires and the secondary containment facilities which are earth and berms around those tanks are now holding the remainders of the materials that were in the tanks,\u201d he added.\n\nABC News' Jenna Harrison, Marilyn Heck, Alyssa Pone and Timmy Truong, Leah Larosa and Will Carr contributed to this report.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
