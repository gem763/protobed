China celebrated its 70th anniversary on Oct 1 this year, and between 1949 and 2019 it's experienced significant progress and change. The ideas of the country's founder and spiritual leader, Mao Zedong, however persist. The Chinese spirit, too, has not changed and the values of previous generation are the same as those of the younger generation.\n\nSeventy years was enough to make China one of the world's greatest countries and to make it a threat to those who tyrannized the earth and rule the world uncontrollably. What China has done in a short period of time is surprising and can be described as the \"miracle of the 21st century\", which would not have been a reality without the unity of the Chinese people and the wise leadership that governed the country. China's domestic policy can serve as an example for other countries, because it has led to internal cohesion among all races and religions, in addition to the wise management of natural resources and manpower.\n\nSuccessive achievements and progress in China's scientific and technological fields and the country's tremendous economy are all important factors in both making China's enemies more hostile and in promoting relations between China and friendly countries. Western fears of unstoppable Chinese progress have prompted media to broadcast false and fabricated stories that spread hostility toward China. However, the Chinese people have proved their awareness and remain unbowed.\n\nAnyone who wants to criticize the Chinese government or talk in a negative way about China has to associate their words with evidence, otherwise these words and analyses are meaningless. Based on my Chinese experience and knowledge of the Chinese people, the ruling political system and the security system, I can assure that China will remain strong and united. The Chinese people will not be fuel for foreign projects, because they do not resemble most other peoples, in addition to their long history of struggle with colonialism and great sacrifices for the Chinese nation.\n\nOn the 70th anniversary of the People's Republic of China, the dream of the ancient Silk Road became a reality through the Belt and Road Initiative proposed by Chinese President Xi Jinping. China has become a country open to the world and the Chinese market has become the largest worldwide, while the Chinese language is no longer strange but widespread and Confucius Institutes are now ubiquitous.\n\nThe economic, developmental and intellectual miracle that China has made in a short period of time will have a positive impact on different countries of the world regardless of their geographical location, religion or ethnicity of their people. It is likely that China is the country capable of changing the current world order and formulating a new world order according to an unparalleled Chinese vision and aspirations. Therefore, the world will witness a future based on cooperation, respect, cultural exchange and common profit. This is what the world did not know before during colonial and mandatory regimes.\n\nSeventy years and the red star is getting brighter. Seventy years and China is united and strong in the face of all storms and malicious campaigns. The Chinese dragon, which the West has long warned of, has risen steadily and the future will be written in Chinese rather than Latin script. Long live the People's Republic of China.\n\nMohamad Zreik is a PhD candidate at the School of Politics and International Studies (SPIS), Central China Normal University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.\n\nThe opinions expressed here are those of the writer and do not necessarily represent the views of China Daily and China Daily website.", "description": "China has proved to be an economically, technologically, militarily and scientifically important country, and is in constant and rapid progress at an accelerated pace.
