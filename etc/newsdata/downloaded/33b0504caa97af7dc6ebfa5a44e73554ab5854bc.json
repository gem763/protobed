Cory Booker is a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination. On Monday Booker unveiled his new plan to prevent gun violence in the U.S. It calls for a national gun licensing program to keep guns out of the wrong hands. His plan would also ban assault rifles, limit handgun purchases to one a month, and close loopholes that allow abusive partners to buy a gun. As part of the Road to 2020, Booker joins \"CBS This Morning\" to reveal the details of his plan. He also comments on the Trump administration's plan to send a U.S. aircraft carrier and a bomber task force to areas closer to Iran.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/12/12/77e5d36d-5915-46ce-b496-218c87d98c5d/thumbnail/1200x630/15dcb72c6fdec4125306ed9638345480/cbsnews-1600x900.jpg"}
