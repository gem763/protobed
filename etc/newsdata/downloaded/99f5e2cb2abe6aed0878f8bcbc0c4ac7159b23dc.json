Villa were leading 2-1 at the time, then Xhaka was substituted and serenaded by boos.\n\n\u2018Arsenal, despite being down to 10 men, went on to win 3-2 without the midfielder. Then five days later, Unai Emery names Xhaka as captain anyway.\n\n\u2018Emery is as much to blame as anyone. If you let the players pick their skipper, then it becomes a popularity contest and that is not what leadership is about.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve never had a manager who decided the captaincy that way and, for me, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is still the safer bet.\u2019\n\nMORE: James Milner rates Liverpool\u2019s title chances and names Wilfried Zaha as his toughest ever opponent", "description": "The Swiss FA have given Arsenal captain Granit Xhaka their full backing after he told fans to 'f*** off' in the side's Premier League clash with Crystal Palace.", "authors": ["Tom Olver"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1183821317-e1572352435968_1572354013.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
