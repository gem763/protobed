This lack of \u201ccomplexity\u201d should have spelled trouble, according to the big database from the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s Centre for International Development. After all, Australia\u2019s Economic Complexity Index has fallen from 57th in the world in 1995 to 93rd (out of 133 countries) in 2017.\n\nYet, while losing \u201ccomplexity\u201d, Australia has climbed the global income rankings to boast the eighth highest GDP per capita in the world, according to the very same Atlas of Complexity. While we\u2019ve supposedly been getting \u201cdumber\u201d, we\u2019ve somehow gotten richer. The reason is that the Harvard Kennedy School\u2019s complexity index is pretty dumb itself: on what other score is Australia below Namibia, a country where much of the population relies on subsistence agriculture? Australia has become high income by concentrating on what it naturally can do best, as economist David Ricardo worked out 200 years ago. The Harvard types may have backed those who called on Australia to strategically bet on developing a computer chip industry during the tech boom of the early 2000s. Instead of that dead end, we were adept enough to work out how to dig up and transport a tonne of iron ore from the Pilbara to China for $20. That has made Australians richer than when they rode on the sheep\u2019s back.\n\nNothing dumb about trading in natural advantage.\n\nAaron Patrick\u2019s voraciously-read reporting of this in The Australian Financial Review has tapped into popular concerns that Australia\u2019s economy is not sophisticated enough. The Atlas of Complexity says Australia\u2019s economy is projected to grow slowly because its \u201cexisting knowhow\u201d provides a \u201cmoderate number of opportunities to diversify its production\u201d. To the contrary, Australia is blessed with a bounty of opportunities to sell all manner of goods and services to the expanding middle classes of Asia, if only we sharpen up and focus on getting the basics right.", "description": "Despite what Harvard University might say, there is nothing smart about investing in things which don't play to our strengths.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2926%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_94/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f4a8e1279cedb04fa2196b0236ba0d5be15202fd", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
