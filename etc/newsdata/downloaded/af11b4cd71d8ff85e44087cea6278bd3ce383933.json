The relative quiet came after a volatile day for European stocks on Thursday, when the ECB unveiled a long-awaited package of stimulus measures, including an interest-rate cut and a renewed program of bond purchases, known as quantitative easing.\n\nIn Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rallied 1% and Japan's Nikkei was up 1.1%. Markets in China, Korea and Taiwan were closed for a holiday.\n\nMoritz Sterzinger, a director at financial-advisory firm JCRA, flagged concerns that further quantitative easing might have limited impact on growth and inflation, given that interest rates are in negative territory.\n\nHe questioned: \"How big are the these diminishing returns to monetary stimulus, and how effective are additional rate cuts and another round of quantitative easing going to be in terms of stimulating the economy?\"\n\nAmong the biggest gainers in Europe on Friday were Italy's Unione di Banche Italiane, known as UBI Banca, which was up 2.8% and Germany's Commerzbank, which gained 3.3%.\n\nThe ECB also set plans on Thursday for a new two-tiered system for charging interest on the deposits held by eurozone banks, in an effort to ease some of the losses lenders face as rates dip further into negative territory.\n\nOn the trade front, The Wall Street Journal reported Beijing was making efforts to narrow the scope of negotiations with the U.S., separating issues like national security that have held up the talks. That came after President Trump on Wednesday postponed new tariffs that were set to be imposed on $250 billion of Chinese imports from Oct. 1.\n\nThe yield on U.S. 10-year Treasurys rose to 1.802%, from 1.789% on Thursday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.\n\nIn currencies, the British pound climbed 0.6% against the U.S. dollar, a day after local papers reported that Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party had suggested it would accept Northern Ireland keeping some European Union rules in place after Brexit, which could ease a major sticking point in the Brexit negotiations.\n\nThe WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the currency against a basket of its peers, slipped 0.2%.\n\nLater in the day, markets will be watching for fresh retail sales data from the U.S., as well as a measure of consumer confidence.\n\nWrite to Avantika Chilkoti at Avantika.Chilkoti@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 13, 2019 04:37 ET (08:37 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
