These are the kind of people who take \u201ccasual Friday\u201d beyond jeans or even shorts and show up in pajamas and bunny slippers.\n\nThis leads to HR telling everyone that casual Friday has a dress code\u2026if it\u2019s not canceled outright. Those who forced the change are usually the first to complain about how awful and unfair it was, all while failing to acknowledge their role in things.\n\nIn the gun community, we\u2019ve got people like that too.\n\nOver at Gun Free Zone, my buddy Miguel has an open letter to those folks:\n\nFirst, let\u2019s make something clear, we have two distinct groups: Open Carry Citizens (the ones that understand both Rights and Responsibilities) and Open Carry Idiots (the ones that go full tactical rifle, plate carrier and 20 magazines to show off at the local Dairy Queen) . This is addressed to the second lot. \u2026 [Open Carry Idiots] OCI is the opposite. They want controversy. They want their mention in the Six O\u2019clock news under a negative banner as if they wanted to show off in Social Media as victims of Fake News. An OCI seems to think: \u201cA mass shooter with a rifle kills a bunch of people in a Walmart? Hell, fuck being polite, I am gonna dress just like the caricature of a Gun Owner, go out in the street parading, sporting an attitude and see what happens. Maybe I can be famous too\u201d which if you think about it, it is supposedly the same mentality that Mass Killers have: The seeking of fame and recognition. So, again, we are sick of your stupid stunts. So far the pushback was been from privately-owned (as in property rights) business politely asking not to open carry. But Stupid Cousin being stupid and doing something outstandingly moronic at one of these places, we are expecting the asking to be upgraded to prohibiting Open Carry and that is if we are lucky and then don\u2019t decided to go all the way to include Concealed Carry in the ban.\n\nGo read the whole thing. I\u2019m begging you to do so. Go read it, then come back here.\n\nDone? Great.\n\nI want to echo was Miguel says here because, frankly, I\u2019m sick of the stupid.\n\n\u201cOh, I have a right to do this!\u201d\n\nSure, to a point. Those stores have property rights and you\u2019re cruising here buster. You\u2019re about half a heartbeat from screwing it up for everyone else. As someone who falls into the \u201ceveryone else\u201d category, I take exception to that brand of stupidity.\n\nAlso understand that because you have a right to do something, it doesn\u2019t mean you have an obligation to do so. You may have a right to walk around town like you\u2019re a heavily-armed extra from a war movie, but that shouldn\u2019t be taken to mean that it\u2019s something you should do for kicks on a slow Saturday afternoon.\n\nThere are times when doing that may make sense. Times of intense civil unrest where a sidearm just isn\u2019t enough for you to be comfortable, for example. At a time like that, you may need to carry an AR-15 to Walmart. At a time like that, people might even be more understanding of you doing so, especially if you\u2019re not trying to look like the most tricked out airsofter at the milsim game while doing it.\n\nHowever, that\u2019s not going to be possible because some people can\u2019t differentiate between \u201ccan\u201d and \u201cshould.\u201d\n\nLook, I get the concept of trying to normalize open carry. I get it. While I\u2019m not completely sure I agree with it, I don\u2019t mind it.\n\nThat\u2019s not what this is about. This is about the dipsticks who take AR-15s into Starbucks just because Starbucks didn\u2019t trip all over themselves to appease anti-gunners. Remember how that turned out? They asked us not to carry in there anymore.\n\nWalmart did the same, unsurprisingly.\n\nAnd now some jackwagons are seeming to do everything in their power to push Walmart to declare itself a gun-free zone. If I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d swear anti-gunners were behind it.\n\nSo stop it, will you? The rest of us are sick of your crap.", "description": "While open carry is a god-given right that shouldn't be infringed upon, some out there abuse this right by being complete idiots with it.", "authors": ["Tom Knighton", "Author'S Bio", "Tom Knighton Is A Navy Veteran", "A Former Newspaperman", "A Novelist", "A Blogger", "Lifetime Shooter.
