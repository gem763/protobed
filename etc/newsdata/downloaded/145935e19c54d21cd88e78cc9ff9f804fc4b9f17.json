The paper says the recording of Khashoggi\u2019s grisly killing and reported dismemberment on 2 October 2018 at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul was obtained by Turkey\u2019s intelligence agency.\n\nJamal Khashoggi: murder in the consulate Read more\n\nAccording to the transcript, Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, a member of the Saudi hit squad, tells Khashoggi that he has to be taken back to Riyadh because of an Interpol order against him. The journalist objects, saying there is no legal case against him and that his fiancee is waiting for him outside.\n\nMutreb and another man are also heard trying to force Khashoggi to send his son a message telling him not to worry if he doesn\u2019t hear from him, according to the paper. Khashoggi resists, saying: \u201cI will write nothing.\u201d\n\nMutreb is later heard saying: \u201cHelp us, so that we can help you. Because in the end, we will take you to Saudi Arabia. And if you don\u2019t help us, you know what will happen in the end.\u201d\n\nSabah also published Khashoggi\u2019s last words before he was apparently drugged and lost consciousness.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t cover my mouth,\u201d he told his killers, according to Sabah. \u201cI have asthma, don\u2019t do it. You\u2019ll suffocate me.\u201d\n\nSome of the details of the transcript published by Sabah were already in a United Nations report on Khashoggi\u2019s murder, released in June. The UN report alleged that Saudi Arabia bore responsibility for the killing and said Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s possible role in the killing should be examined.\n\nSaudi Arabia initially offered multiple, shifting accounts about Khashoggi\u2019s disappearance. As international pressure mounted, the kingdom eventually settled on the explanation that he was killed by rogue officials in a brawl inside their consulate.\n\nThe kingdom has put 11 people on trial in non-public proceedings. The 34-year-old prince, who continues to have the support of his father, King Salman, denies any involvement in the killing.\n\nKhashoggi\u2019s remains have never been found.", "description": "Sabah paper says recording was obtained by Turkey\u2019s intelligence agency", "authors": ["Associated Press In Ankara"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da4e526c97d53dae471e392046d4547244aabc0d/0_185_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f8072e864d2ad8888a4639e3823244b2", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
