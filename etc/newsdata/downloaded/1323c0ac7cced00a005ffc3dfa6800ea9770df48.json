Mullet with sideburns? Guilty. Ventriloquist dummy that looks exactly like its owner? Guilty. Sequin ball cap with a faux fur jacket and striped shorts? Definitely guilty.\n\nDuring this week\u2019s Saturday Night Live, Jason Momoa throws himself on the mercy on the court in a surprise cameo. How much mercy does the court have for a leopard-draped live-in nurse/gigolo/paralegal named Apollo Benz? Turns out, not much. Yes, he did steal an old woman\u2019s heirloom earrings and pierce his nipples with them, but is that a crime? Oh, it is? Theft, you say. Looks like Judge Barry is going to make it to night church with plenty of time to spare.", "description": "Jason Momoa stopped by Saturday Night Live, hosted by Chance the Rapper, to play a shady live-in nurse/gigilo.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/27-Jason-Mamoa.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
