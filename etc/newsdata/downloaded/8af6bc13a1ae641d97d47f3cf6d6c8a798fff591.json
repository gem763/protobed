While they say it\u2019s too early to write off Michigan \u2014 Trump aides say the campaign still intends to pump resources into the state \u2014 a range of public polling has shown Trump in poor shape here.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be tough,\u201d said Greg McNeilly, a veteran GOP strategist in Michigan. Though the president overcame tough odds in 2016, winning the state by 10,704 votes, or less than 1 point, McNeilly expects Democratic turnout to be stronger in 2020. \u201cTrump is the underdog,\u201d he said.", "description": "", "authors": ["Politico.Com Story"], "top_image": ""}
