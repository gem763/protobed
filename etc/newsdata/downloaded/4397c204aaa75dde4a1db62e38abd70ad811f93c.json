For years, prosecutors alleged, Epstein used others to recruit minor girls and young women for sex at his properties in New York, Florida, the Virgin Islands, New Mexico and elsewhere.\n\nEpstein strongly denied the accusations. His alleged madame, the British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, maintains her denial. Others who were known to socialize with Epstein, including attorney Alan Dershowitz, say they never witnessed any of the alleged abuse.\n\nA third accuser who spoke to the Herald, Marijke Chartouni, only reached out to law enforcement after hearing of Epstein\u2019s arrest in July. She described seeing Dershowitz with Epstein at the financier\u2019s Manhattan mansion before she was taken to a room and assaulted.\n\nAll of the women told the Herald that they believed many of the people around Epstein \u2015 his wealthy and powerful friends, his household staff and others who provided services for him \u2015 had to have known about the abuse, despite their many denials.\n\nAn attorney who sued the Justice Department over Epstein\u2019s unusually lenient 2008 plea deal, Bradley Edwards, told the Herald how he believed Epstein successfully manipulated his victims, based on interviews with dozens of them. Accusers had been outraged by the deal Epstein managed to reach with federal prosecutors: He pled guilty to state-level charges and was sentenced to 13 months in a low-security jail, which he left most days on a work permit.\n\n\u201c[Epstein] would find out they have no home, no car, that they need a place to live, and he would provide a place to live,\u2019\u2019 Edwards told the Herald. \u201cHe can get you to the best doctors. Sometimes he would do that and sometimes he wouldn\u2019t do that, but the promise was real because as soon as you walk into his house and see there are legitimate cooks, chefs, and assistants, everybody catering to him \u2014 it gives this air of legitimacy. I mean, everybody in this whole entire mansion can\u2019t possibly be running an illegal sex trafficking operation, right?\u201d\n\nThe financier pulled young women into his orbit, Edwards said, by giving them a taste of his vast wealth \u2015 offering to pay for school or help with their careers. One accuser used money she received from Epstein to help her mother pay rent.\n\nFear was another tool used to allegedly control the girls. Ransome said she was scared of Epstein and Maxwell because they would threaten to harm her if she disobeyed them and, due to their proximity to such powerful figures in business and politics \u2015 including presidents and royalty \u2015 she believed they were capable of it.\n\nWhile the criminal case against Epstein died with him, prosecutors are still investigating other potential co-conspirators and say they are prepared to bring charges if needed.", "description": "A new report details how the deceased money manager controlled the minors he is accused of trafficking for sex.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d866f0c230000d000d2e5e1.jpeg?cache=usqyglcmdl&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
