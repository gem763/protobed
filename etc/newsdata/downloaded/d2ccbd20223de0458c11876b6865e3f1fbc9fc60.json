Looming punishments for Halkbank, a state-owned Turkish bank accused of helping Iran evade sanctions.\n\nWith the standoff over Brunson, however, we have entered uncharted waters. \"It went from a crisis in the bureaucracy to a crisis at the presidential level,\" Cagaptay says.\n\nHow that happened...\n\nTrump and Erdogan met on the sidelines of last month's NATO summit, and Trump left under the impression that he and Erdogan had reached a deal: the U.S. would secure the release of a Turkish woman held in Israel, and Turkey would release Brunson.\n\non the sidelines of last month's NATO summit, and Trump left under the impression that he and Erdogan had reached a deal: the U.S. would secure the release of a Turkish woman held in Israel, and Turkey would release Brunson. But when Brunson was moved to house arrest, rather than released, \"Trump felt slighted, and took it personally,\" Cagaptay says.\n\nrather than released, \"Trump felt slighted, and took it personally,\" Cagaptay says. Trump has now pushed things to the brink, demanding Erdogan's full surrender. \"There will be no normalization of relations now without Brunson\u2019s unconditional release,\" according to Cagaptay.\n\nErdogan might still have a way out. He could release Brunson, Cagaptay explains, but use his control over the media to frame the move as part of a wider deal that doesn't actually exist.\n\nSo why hasn't he done it? Originally, Erdogan wanted to use Brunson as leverage to reduce the punishment on Halkbank and discourage further investigation of the bank by the Treasury Department. Now he's in a bind, but one that has a silver lining.\n\n\"Erdogan didn\u2019t want this crisis with Trump, but now he\u2019s looking at how he can intertwine it with the other crises he faces,\" most notably the long-anticipated economic meltdown which Erdogan is now blaming on U.S. sanctions, despite having largely caused it with his own economic policies.\n\nbut now he\u2019s looking at how he can intertwine it with the other crises he faces,\" most notably the long-anticipated economic meltdown which Erdogan is now blaming on U.S. sanctions, despite having largely caused it with his own economic policies. \"Erdogan is a master of turning situations to his advantage,\" Cagaptay says. \"His base buys into his rhetoric on this, that other countries don\u2019t want Turkey to be a great power.\"\n\nWhat to watch: Both leaders have been have been shocked at various stages here, says Aaron Stein of the Atlantic Council \u2014 Trump that Brunson wasn't released despite his efforts to \"buddy up\" to Erdogan, Erdogan that his long-term bet that no U.S. president would risk losing Turkey as an ally has been called.\n\n\"They made a bet on the old rules with the new guy.\"\n\n\u2014 Stein on Turkey's decision to continue to hold Brunson\n\nThe bottom line: \"Political ties will remain tense until Erdogan finds a way to release Brunson and sell it in Turkey,\" Cagaptay says, though he isn\u2019t expecting the U.S.-Turkey alliance to collapse entirely. \"Military and intelligence cooperation remains strong. That could be the foundation of a reset when it eventually comes.\"", "description": "Trump didn't start the fire, but he added plenty of fuel.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/y_IhSld2tiTU5baSZXVKoHr57PY=/0x193:2835x1788/1920x1080/2018/08/17/1534539868695.jpg", "published_at": "2018-08-17"}
