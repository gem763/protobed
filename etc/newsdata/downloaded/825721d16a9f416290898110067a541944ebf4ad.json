While different kinds of points are worth different amounts, each of these 100,000-plus offers represents a fantastic value.\n\nSome of these are limited-time offers, while others seem to be here to stay. Read on to learn more about these offers.\n\nRead more: The best credit card sign-up offers available right now\n\nKeep in mind that we're focusing on the rewards and perks that make these credit cards great options, not things like interest rates and late fees, which can far outweigh the value of any rewards.\n\nWhen you're working to earn credit card rewards, it's important to practice financial discipline, like paying your balances off in full each month, making payments on time, and not spending more than you can afford to pay back. Basically, treat your credit card like a debit card.\n\nWelcome offer: 125,000 points after you spend $3,000 in the first three months\n\nIHG is the parent company of a handful of hotel chains, including Holiday Inn. The company has more than 5,600 properties around the world, making it the second-largest hotel brand, behind Marriott. IHG has a wide range of properties from budget options like the Holiday Inn Express, to luxurious Regent and InterContinental hotels and resorts.\n\nIHG's Rewards Club program is often overlooked\u2014 I know I'm guilty of passing it over without a second look in favor of Hilton Honors or Marriott Bonvoy (and back in the day, Starwood Preferred Guest).\n\nHowever, the program is worth a second look, and a newly increased sign-up bonus on its primary credit card offers a perfect opportunity.\n\nRight now, the IHG Rewards Club Premier card has a sign-up bonus of 125,000 points, which you can earn after you spend $3,000 in the first three months.\n\nRooms can cost as little at 10,000 points per night, depending on the property and its location within a city. The bonus is enough to cover almost two weeks' worth of nights at a Holiday Inn Express \u2014 even some in prime markets \u2014 or two to four nights at top InterContinental locations.\n\nThe card normally earns 10 points per dollar spent at IHG hotels, but as part of the current sign-up offer, you'll get 25 points per dollar spent on IHG purchases for the first 12 months. You'll also earn 4 points per dollar on all other purchases for the first 12 months \u2014 after that, the earning rate is 2 points per dollar spent at gas stations, grocery stores, and restaurants, and 1x point on everything else.\n\nIt also comes with automatic Platinum elite status, which entitles you to a 50% bonus on points earned during a stay, complimentary room upgrades, late checkout when available, and guaranteed room availability with 72 hours' notice \u2014 helpful if you have a last-minute trip.\n\nThe Premier card offers an annual anniversary free night certificate that can be used at any category 1-7 hotel (hotels that cost 40,000 points per night or less). While that means that some of IHG's most premium locations are excluded, the certificate is still valid at a ton of locations all around the world.\n\nFor instance, I didn't have trouble finding properties in major cities like New York and Chicago during peak travel season \u2014 all charging well upward of $200 \u2014 that accept the free night certificate. That more than makes up for the card's $89 annual fee.\n\nWelcome offer: 150,000 Hilton Honors points when you spend $4,000 in the first three months.\n\nThe premium Hilton Honors American Express Aspire card has a hefty $450 annual fee, but it comes with so many perks, benefits, and rebates that it's more than worth paying for Hilton loyalists \u2014 or even brand-agnostic hotel guests.\n\nIn addition to an airline fee credit up to $250 per calendar year and up to a $250 Hilton resort statement credit each card member year, the Aspire also offers up to a $100 Hilton on-property credit every time you book a stay of two nights or longer at a luxury Hilton property \u2014 you just need to book through a specific website for cardholders.\n\nThe card also offers a free weekend night reward each year \u2014 regardless of how much you spend \u2014 and a second if you spend $60,000 on the card in a calendar year. It also comes with complimentary Diamond status.\n\nThe Aspire earns a tremendous 14 points per dollar spent with Hilton, 7 points on flights booked with the airline, car rentals, and at US restaurants, and 3 points on everything else.\n\nWelcome offer: 125,000 Hilton Honors points when you spend $2,000 in the first three months.\n\nThis card was previously known as the Hilton Ascend card, but it was rebranded as the Surpass card.\n\nNot only do you get a hefty welcome bonus of 125,000 Hilton points with the Surpass card if you apply now, you also get complimentary Gold status. That comes with a suite of useful benefits, including late check-out, free water bottles during stays, and more. Plus, you'll get free breakfast during your stay, and you'll be eligible for a room upgrade, assuming there's a free room available.\n\nThe Surpass earns 12x points on Hilton purchases, 6x points at restaurants, gas stations, and supermarkets \u2014 all within the US \u2014 and 3x points on everything else.\n\nBetween the 125,000-point welcome bonus, and the fact that the Surpass card offers a free weekend night when you spend $15,000 on it within a calendar year, you've got the makings of a nice long hotel stay without having to pay.\n\nThe card also comes with 10 free day passes to Priority Pass airport lounges, and offers a free weekend night when you spend $15,000 on it within a calendar year. The Surpass has a $95 annual fee, but chances are the benefits will offset that for you.\n\nWelcome offer: 50,000 bonus miles after you spend $5,000 in the first three months, and another 50,000 bonus miles after you spend $25,000 total in the first six months. This offer is available until October 10, 2019.\n\nThe United Explorer Business Card is a good option if you fly United a few times a year, as it offers a first checked bag for free on United flights along with priority boarding and two one-time United Club lounge passes each year.\n\nUnlike most other airline cards, the United Explorer Business earns bonus miles on categories beyond airline spending. So in addition to earning 2x miles on United purchases, it earns 2x miles at office supply stores, gas stations, and restaurants.\n\nThe card has a $95 annual fee, and doesn't charge foreign transaction fees. If you can meet the high spending requirement of $25,000 total in the first six months, this offer is worth a look \u2014 just keep in mind it's only available until October 10.\n\nWelcome offer: 125,000 Hilton Honors points when you spend $3,000 in the first three months.\n\nIn terms of benefits, the small business Hilton card is almost the same as the Surpass card. It comes with complimentary Hilton Honors Gold status, offers a free weekend night when you spend $15,000 in a calendar year, and comes with 10 free Priority Pass lounge visits annually. It also has a $95 annual fee.\n\nIt has two differences from the Surpass, however. First, you'll earn a second free weekend night certificate after spending $60,000 within a calendar year.\n\nSecond, the earning rates are a bit different to reflect business spending. You'll get 12x points per dollar spent at Hilton properties, 6x points on select business travel and purchases, and 3x points on everything else.\n\nThose select business travel and purchases that earn 6x points include:\n\nFlights booked directly with airlines or Amex Travel\n\nCar rentals booked directly with select car rental companies\n\nUS restaurants\n\nUS gas stations\n\nCell phone services purchased directly from US service providers\n\nUS purchases for shipping\n\nWelcome offer: 50,000 Avios after you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first three months, plus an additional 50,000 Avios when you spend $20,000 total in purchases in your first year.\n\nLike the United Explorer Business Card, the British Airways Visa has a high minimum spending requirement to earn the full 100,000-point bonus. However, with this card you have your whole first account year to meet the spending requirement, not just the first six months.\n\nYou can use Avios to book travel on British Airways as well as its partners such as American Airlines, Iberia, and Aer Lingus.\n\nIf you spend at least $30,000 on the card in a calendar year, you'll earn a travel together ticket. This is essentially a certificate for two-for-one travel, letting you bring along a companion on a British Airways award flight for free minus the taxes and fees (you'll still be on the hook for those).\n\nThe British Airways Visa earns 3 Avios per dollar on British Airways purchases, and 1 point per dollar on everything else. There's a $95 annual fee, and no foreign transaction fees.", "description": "Right now, there are 6 credit cards with bonuses of 100,000 points or more!
