Everyone should have heard. And yet, the media gives more attention to President Trump\u2019s joke that fluorescent lighting makes his skin look orange than to the discovery of 2,246 corpses at an abortionist\u2019s home.\n\nThink about this.\n\nAre we so numb to the horror of abortion that the collection of thousands of dead babies is hardly newsworthy? Perhaps. But I have another hypothesis. Once you see a victim, it\u2019s impossible to deny that there was a crime. And once you come face to face with the truth, it\u2019s no longer possible to accept the lie.\n\nAbortion has always required the acceptance of a lie. For years, the dominant lie was this: \u201cIt\u2019s a fetus, not a baby.\u201d Thus, an abortion only terminates a pregnancy, it doesn\u2019t end a life. But then science revealed the truth. Within a few short weeks, this \u201cclump of cells\u201d has fingers and toes, eyes and a nose, a beating heart and a developing brain. This is not a bundle of tissue, but rather a bundle of joy, a life made in the image of God.\n\nUndeterred, abortion activists fought back. They ignored or dismissed the science, and as ultrasound technology exploded, Planned Parenthood instructed mothers to look the other way. It\u2019s no surprise. As Live Action\u2019s Lila Rose states so clearly, \u201c[t]hose images destroy the abortion industry myth that her baby is just a \u2018clump of cells\u2019 lacking humanity.\u201d\n\nThey stressed \u201cviability\u201d (never mind that a newborn baby is in many ways equally dependent on its mother), and pushed forward another lie: \u201cMy body, my choice.\u201d Bodily autonomy became the rallying cry until, again, science demurred. Bodily autonomy could never justify this cruelest of \u201cprocedures\u201d because it is not the mother\u2019s body to which an abortion does violence, but rather \u201ca distinct, self-developing individual,\u201d with his or her own \u201cdistinctive genetic code from the moment of fertilization.\u201d\n\nWith the truth beckoning, abortion defenders urged women to \u201cshout your abortion.\u201d They claimed that the facts don\u2019t matter because \u201cabortion is normal\u2026it is natural\u2026this is not a debate.\u201d Defiantly, they proclaimed, \u201cI did choose life; I chose my own.\u201d They shouted because they could not lend reason to the one lie that remained. Because if a baby is human, and if it is a distinct life, then human life must be disposable.\n\nAnd then we saw what \u201cdisposable\u201d looks like. David Daleiden told America about the human trafficking of baby parts. And also about Planned Parenthood and its allies harvesting the heart, brains, and other organs of the unborn, and selling them on the black market. It shocked our societal conscience. In response, the abortion industry (and it is an industry) raged. Its defenders shouted all the more. They put David on trial and told us that his videos were the problem, and not the ugly truth that they uncovered. He had invaded their privacy; no matter that they had invaded the womb. David could face prison time because he showed us the truth and, collectively, we have been unwilling to face it.\n\nToday, turning away is no longer possible. Shouting down the truth is no longer a viable option. When Dr. Klopfer preserved the remains of 2,246 aborted babies, he made the truth unavoidable. He showed us his trophies. He showed us our victims.\n\nBut will we act? Unborn children do not lack humanity, but they have no voice. Will we speak on their behalf? I suggested recently that there would be greater public outcry if we were destroying puppies or kittens than there is for the nearly one million abortions that occur in America each year.\n\nWhat about now?\n\nThe Trump administration has worked to advance pro-life policies, and for that I am thankful. More and more states are passing legislation to restrict abortion, and I am hopeful that one day soon, such laws will overcome the legal challenges and take effect. But we need more than a change of policy, we need a societal change of heart. One by one, the lies of abortion have been exposed. Now the truth about human life must be proclaimed. I ask the Christian church to find its voice.\n\nGod help us, we must speak and break the silence.
