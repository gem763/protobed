Don\u2019t know how they will ever look their workforce in the eye again. Moral cowardice,\u201d David Titley, the NOAA\u2019s former chief operating officer, tweeted Friday.\n\nBREAKING: NOAA has sided with President Trump, rather than its own scientists: https://t.co/9fFQpFrtbs \u2014 Capital Weather Gang (@capitalweather) September 6, 2019\n\nPerhaps the darkest day ever for @noaa leadership. Don\u2019t know how they will ever look their workforce in the eye again. Moral cowardice. \u2014 David Titley (@dwtitley) September 6, 2019\n\nTrump erroneously tweeted and later said Sunday that Alabama was in the projected path of Hurricane Dorian. The Birmingham NWS quickly issued a notice contradicting Trump.\n\nAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east. #alwx \u2014 NWS Birmingham (@NWSBirmingham) September 1, 2019\n\nFive days later \u2014 after Trump relentlessly insisted he was correct and even tried to back up his story by presenting an altered National Hurricane Center map on which he himself circled Alabama with a marker, according to The Washington Post \u2014 the NOAA disavowed the statement by the NWS contradicting Trump.\n\nThe \u201cBirmingham National Weather Service\u2019s Sunday morning tweet spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time,\u201d said an unsigned statement from the NOAA. Information and maps disseminated to the public \u201cclearly demonstrated that tropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama.\u201d Clearly, that\u2019s not the case:\n\nHere was the 12z September 1, 2019 \"spaghetti plot\" ... Alabama was definitely outside of any threat cone. pic.twitter.com/mm9hL4rKQN \u2014 Ryan Maue (@RyanMaue) September 6, 2019\n\nThis is a complete and utter disgrace. The NWS in Birmingham's tweet was 100% spot on with the absolute terms it chose at that time, and anyone telling you otherwise is a liar. Trump is taking NWS, arguably the most effective government agency & trying to ruin it to save face. https://t.co/tm8AVPQqfF \u2014 Matt Lanza (@mattlanza) September 6, 2019", "description": "\"Don\u2019t know how they will ever look their workforce in the eye again.
