But of course, Annie Wilkes still manages to stir up some chaos.\n\nThe first five (of 10 total) episodes of Castle Rock\u2019s second season were made available for review, and we won\u2019t be spoiling any of the twists here. We can say, however, that you absolutely don\u2019t need to have seen the first season to dive right in; there are some familiar landmarks, like the big church in downtown Castle Rock and the Mellow Tiger bar, and a few sly name-drops (including Shawshank Prison\u2019s late Warden Lacy), but otherwise the first half of season two follows the anthology playbook by offering up a new story and characters.\n\nWell, not entirely new. Anyone who\u2019s read King\u2019s Misery or watched Kathy Bates\u2019 Oscar-winning turn in the 1990 film has Annie Wilkes branded into their nightmares. She\u2019s the prim, folksy, seriously unhinged nurse who \u201crescues\u201d a famous romance novelist after a car accident, then keeps him prisoner and tortures him while forcing him to write a new book that revives her favourite character.\n\nCastle Rock, which is set in the present day, applies its own timeline to Annie\u2019s story; here, she\u2019s in her 30s (played with mannered, manic energy by the excellent Lizzy Caplan), so it\u2019s probably a decade before the events of Misery, with flashbacks that place her childhood and adolescence in the 1990s.\n\nThe season opens with one of those flashbacks, and though the circumstances aren\u2019t explained until a later episode, it\u2019s safe to say that teenage Annie got mixed up in Something Very Bad that will reverberate throughout her life. Without giving anything away, it\u2019s something that instilled her passion for reading and the idea of being a writer\u2019s \u201cnumber one fan,\u201d but also awakened the full capabilities of her terrifying dark side.\n\nWhen we meet contemporary Annie in Castle Rock, she\u2019s living like a nomad with her daughter Joy (Eighth Grade\u2019s Elsie Fisher, here playing another awkward teen with authentic angst). The two are on a continuous road trip as Annie, who\u2019s secretive and clearly on the run from that thing in her past, infiltrates hospitals dressed in her nurse garb to steal the pills she needs \u2014 not to feed an addiction, but to keep her mood swings and her occasionally slippery relationship with reality in check.\n\nWhen a late-night car accident strands the duo in Maine, Annie and Joy become drawn into the drama \u2014 cultural, familial and supernatural \u2014 that\u2019s already brewing in Castle Rock, as well as the adjacent town of Jerusalem\u2019s Lot.\n\nJoy (Elsie Fisher), surrounded by ominous Castle Rock atmosphere.

Construction manager Abdi Omar (Captain Phillips\u2019 Barkhad Abdi) and his sister, Nadia (Yusra Warsama), who\u2019s the head doctor at the local hospital, came to Maine as teens after losing their mother during the Battle of Mogadishu.\n\nWhen they arrived in Castle Rock, Abdi and Omar were taken in by Pop Merrill \u2014 played by Tim Robbins, whose casting is a nice mirror to his role in 1994's The Shawshank Redemption, though he\u2019s playing a totally different character here. Pop is a gruff but fair Army veteran dying of cancer who\u2019s long been one of the town\u2019s most powerful residents. Like Annie, he\u2019s also hiding an awful secret.\n\nPop is kind of a King deep cut (he\u2019s in the novella The Sun Dog), but another kid he helped raise \u2014 his nephew, John \u201cAce\u201d Merrill (Paul Sparks)\u2014is notorious for his bullying antics in stories like \u201cThe Body\u201d (adapted into Stand By Me) and Needful Things. The middle-aged version of Ace is no less cruel and menacing than he was as a young man, though Castle Rock balances him out a little by giving him a brother, Chris (Matthew Alan), who\u2019s a much kinder soul.\n\nThe Omar siblings and their community \u2014 likely inspired by Maine\u2019s real-life Somali population \u2014 bring some welcome diversity to the story, and also make King\u2019s version of New England feel a little less bound to the past. But just because Abdi and Nadia share Pop with Ace doesn\u2019t mean he accepts them as family; you expect him to be racist, but he\u2019s particularly infuriated when Abdi\u2019s business dealings start encroaching on his turf.\n\nWyd, Annie? (Image: Dana Starbard, Hulu)\n\nAll this is to say that season two of Castle Rock \u2014 still showrun by creators Sam Shaw and Dustin Thomason, with J.J. Abrams and King among the exec producers, and an array of different writers and directors involved throughout the season\u2014delivers the viewer into a very tangled web.\n\nThere is a lot going on even without the supernatural elements, which really rise to the surface by episode five and are obviously going to have a huge impact on the back half of the season. Knowing that Annie will survive no matter what happens (so she can meet her end in Misery, that is) doesn\u2019t really compromise any of the drama, because there are so many other characters with so many other things at stake. Each episode is emotional and packed with conflict and just, in general, a lot to take in.\n\nWhile season one also piled on a lot (inter-dimensional portals and fractured timelines, religious fanaticism, dementia, psychic empathy, etc.), the pieces didn\u2019t quite fit together in the end, as much as the show wanted them to. Despite all its high drama, season two feels a little more conventional in its narrative, and that\u2019ll likely make for a more satisfying story arc, especially with all the horror-fantasy elements to come.\n\nThe decision to make a known antagonist the main protagonist \u2014 Annie is the ultimate unreliable narrator, being a perpetual liar who also experiences hallucinations on the regular \u2014 is also an intriguing one. Among King\u2019s hundreds of character creations, Annie\u2019s someone whose backstory seems especially ripe for exploration.\n\nWe\u2019re primed to fear and dislike her from the start, considering what we know from Misery and from seeing the strict way she controls Joy, a shy girl who wants nothing more than a stable, normal life. But there\u2019s a specific moment in the season premiere (no spoilers, but you\u2019ll know it when you see it) when you will find yourself rooting for Annie as she faces off with another character. They clearly have no idea what she\u2019s capable of, but we sure do, and the payoff is tremendous.\n\nCastle Rock premieres October 24 on Hulu in the U.S. and will stream on Fox Showcase in Australia.", "description": "As we saw last season, and as we\u2019ve known for decades thanks to Stephen King\u2019s interconnected stories, Castle Rock is a grim little town \u2014 there\u2019s no way one odd outsider is gonna change the status quo too much.
