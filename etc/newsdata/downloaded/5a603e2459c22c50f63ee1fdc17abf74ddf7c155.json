Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and the president's other defenders claimed on weekend news shows that rules they said required a whistleblower to have first-hand knowledge were changed, just before the complaint, was filed to allow second-hand information -- and Trump did so himself on Monday.\n\n\u201cWHO CHANGED THE LONG STANDING WHISTLEBLOWER RULES JUST BEFORE SUBMITTAL OF THE FAKE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT? DRAIN THE SWAMP!,\u201d Trump tweeted Monday morning.\n\nWHO CHANGED THE LONG STANDING WHISTLEBLOWER RULES JUST BEFORE SUBMITTAL OF THE FAKE WHISTLEBLOWER REPORT? DRAIN THE SWAMP! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019\n\n(MORE: Trump: 'Trying to find out' whistleblower's identity, demands to meet 'accuser')\n\nThe complaint, which prompted an impeachment inquiry, was based on second-hand knowledge the whistleblower said was gained from other U.S. government officials, and it alleged that Trump abused his office in the July 25 call by repeatedly pressuring Ukraine's president to work with his personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe president's supporters have claimed that, in August, prior to the whistleblower filing his complaint about Trump and the July call, the intelligence community changed a rule they say required that whistleblowers provide direct, first-hand knowledge of alleged wrongdoings.\n\nIn making the claim, Trump and his supporters referred to a change made on the \u201cDisclosure of Urgent Concern\u201d form, which previously had asked if the whistleblower had direct or indirect knowledge.\n\nThe intelligence community inspector's general's office released a statement Monday evening disputing any recent change in the whistleblower form.\n\n\u201cWith respect to the whistleblower complaint received by the ICIG on August 12, 2019, the ICIG processed and reviewed the complaint in accordance with the law,\u201d read a statement from the intelligence community inspector general's office (ICIG) dated Sept. 30. \u201cThe Disclosure of Urgent Concern form the Complainant submitted on August 12, 2019 is the same form the ICIG has had in place since May 24, 2018,\u201d the statement said.\n\nNational security lawyers who specialize in whistleblower complaints told ABC News that whistleblowers have never been required to have direct knowledge of alleged wrongdoing in order to file a complaint.\n\n\u201cIn no way, shape or form was anything changed as a matter of law,\u201d said national security lawyer Brad Moss. \u201cThe law has never said that a whistleblower couldn't have second information because that would unnecessarily restrict an inordinate amount of whistleblowing allegations coming forward because most people don\u2019t have the first-hand information.\u201d\n\n(MORE: Whistleblower feared Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine constituted 'flagrant' abuse of power)\n\nIrvin McCullough, national security analyst for Government Accountability Project, said that the change made by the intelligence community's chief watchdog Michael Atkinson, in an attempt to revamp and simplify the form, carried no legal weight and did not change any whistleblower laws or protections.\n\nMoss agreed, saying that the previous form caused some confusion for whistleblowers who did not have legal counsel about whether they themselves had to have first-hand knowledge. He agreed as well that changing the form didn't change the law that he said clearly allows a whistleblower to file a complaint with second-hand information.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Ever since the whistleblower complaint focused on President Donald Trump's Ukraine call  was released to the public, he and his allies have repeatedly questioned how the intelligence community handled the matter -- trying to discredit the account because it's based on second-hand information", "authors": ["Elizabeth Thomas"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ypzQ8tlYg3bnvHK1ebPQZQ--~B/aD01NTg7dz05OTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/gma/us.abcnews.go.com/trump-6-ap-er-190930_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
