Kerry, a Democrat, was secretary of state from 2013 to 2017. He is the visiting distinguished statesman at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a leader of the World War Zero initiative.\n\nFive years ago, the U.N. secretary-general convened a summit on climate change in New York that helped jump-start the historic Paris agreement 15 months later. That summit, which launched a new era in global climate action, feels like an eternity ago, and in too many quarters not for the better. But the armies of progress have refused to bow to delay, denial or distortion. This week a different secretary-general will host another global climate summit to spur the world toward the next phase of meeting an existential challenge: countries strengthening their current national commitments under the agreement to reduce climate pollution. The need for leadership has never been more urgent; certainly the destruction from Hurricane Dorian and the fires in the Amazon should have refocused everyone\u2019s minds on the fragility of our global carbon sinks. Most wars start with a bomb dropped, a leader killed or a line crossed. But today we stand on the precipice of the greatest battle humanity has ever faced, precisely because no one has done enough.\n\nSince the Paris agreement was adopted, climate analysts have argued that the initial commitments made by more than 185 countries were insufficient to reach the agreement\u2019s goals in fighting climate change. That\u2019s true, but partly by design. The agreement was structured first to get countries to buy in and then to increase their ambition in five-year intervals; 2020 is the target date for the first round of more influential climate plans.\n\nAs secretary of state, I worked with President Barack Obama to ensure that the United States led by example with its ambitious first target. Unfortunately, the current administration has made its opposition crystal clear, even as governors, mayors and businesses continue to push forward. In the temporary absence of U.S. leadership, we need other major emitters to step up \u2014 not only to deliver the climate action we need but also to build trust that international institutions are prepared to take on this global challenge until the United States is ready to rejoin the fight.\n\nWho will take the lead in lifting global ambition to the next stage?\n\nIn recent joint statements with France, both India and China indicated they would update their national climate commitments \u201cin a manner representing a progression beyond the current one and reflecting their highest possible ambition.\u201d They also announced they would submit strategies next year for the essential task of cutting emissions over the long-term, also called for under the Paris Agreement.\n\nThese countries recognize that national climate commitments are not economic burdens, but opportunities. They\u2019re right. A report from the World Bank\u2019s International Finance Corp. finds that the commitments under Paris from just the top 21 developing countries will generate a $23 trillion investment opportunity by 2030.\n\nFrance is seizing the reins of the Paris agreement\u2019s legacy. Not only has the country adopted legislation to cut emissions to net-zero by 2050, it\u2019s pushing the European Union to do the same and strengthen its Paris commitment for 2030.\n\nChina and India also might be ready to step up their efforts, which shouldn\u2019t be a surprise given all they have to gain from improved air quality to economic competitiveness. This month, India announced it is making strong progress on its massive 175 gigawatts of new installed renewable capacity by 2022; 99 percent of electric buses currently on the road are in China, thanks to ambitious national policies.\n\nBut make no mistake, the true test for the two countries, and for all of us, arrives this week at the secretary-general\u2019s summit. China and India have the chance to be much more explicit in their commitments about strengthening action and to clearly prove that they won\u2019t be held back by a recalcitrant Washington or anyone else.\n\nI\u2019ve negotiated the language of international agreements, resolutions and joint statements. I know China and India are serious about international climate action. But any armchair quarterbacking or back-seat driving by the remaining skeptics, who dare say Paris is suspect because the large developing-country emitters aren\u2019t serious, can be crushed this week. We don\u2019t need open-ended statements. We need a concrete commitment that countries will step up their domestic ambition on the Paris agreement\u2019s 2020 timetable, the ultimate rejoinder to the naysayers.\n\nSwift, ambitious action can put the Paris agreement on track for success and put the deniers, the delayers and the distorters on the defensive. The United States will be back at the table after 2020, but in this aberrational period of shortsightedness, now is the time for China, India and other countries to prove just what we are missing.", "description": "We need a concrete commitment to meet the Paris agreement\u2019s 2020 timetable.", "authors": ["John F.
