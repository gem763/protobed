The hotel also hosted the Trump family during a brief trip to Ireland by the president in June.\n\nAsked if Trump had suggested that Pence stay at the property, the vice president\u2019s chief of staff, Marc Short, told journalists, \u201cI think that it was a suggestion.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like when we went through the trip it\u2019s like, `Well, he\u2019s going to Doonbeg because that is where his family is from, it\u2019s like `oh, you should stay at my place\u2019,\u201d Short said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like a `you must.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t like a `you have to.\u2019\u201d\n\nCalifornia Democratic Congressman Ted Lieu accused Pence on Twitter of \u201cfunneling taxpayer money\u201d to Trump by staying at the hotel. \u201cYou took an oath to the Constitution, not to @realDonaldTrump,\u201d Lieu said.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee also chimed in, saying on its DNC War Room Twitter feed that Pence\u2019s choice of hotel meant \u201cyour tax dollars: making the Trump family richer.\u201d\n\nPence defended the decision, pointing to family ties and saying the hotel stay was vetted in advance.\n\n\u201cI understand political attacks by Democrats but if you have the chance to get to Doonbeg you\u2019ll find that it is a fairly small place,\u201d he told reporters of the one-street village that has a population of just 200 people.\n\n\u201cWe checked it with the State Department, they approved us staying there and I was pleased to have the opportunity to return to that family hometown and be able to stay there ... It was important to me, before our original trip plan, to at least spend one night in Doonbeg.\u201d\n\nGREAT-GRANDMOTHER\u2019S ROOTS\n\nPence\u2019s stay was paid for by U.S. taxpayers, Short said, but the vice president personally paid for his sister and mother who came with him. Pence\u2019s great-grandmother was from Doonbeg.\n\nTrump has retained ownership of his hotels, golf courses and other businesses, but he gave control of the businesses to his sons shortly before he took office in January 2017.\n\nFormer government ethics officials and watchdog groups say Trump has failed to put safeguards in place to ensure that he does not directly profit from his actions as president.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nShort said the original plan had been for Pence to hold meetings in Dublin and to head to Doonbeg afterwards. A last-minute schedule change meant Pence would need to visit Dublin after staying overnight in Ireland, and Trump\u2019s property had already been vetted.\n\nTrump on Thursday canceled a visit to Poland here in order to monitor Hurricane Dorian, and sent Pence in his stead. He was later criticized for playing golf during that time.\n\nIn Dublin, Pence met with Irish President Michael D. Higgins and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, urging Ireland and the European Union to negotiate \u201cin good faith\u201d with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and reach a Brexit deal that respects UK sovereignty.", "description": "U.S. Vice President Mike Pence drew fire from Democrats on Tuesday when he met with Irish leaders in the capital Dublin but stayed at a hotel owned by President Donald Trump almost 300 kilometers (180 miles) away at his boss's urging.", "authors": ["Alexandra Alper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425747008&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8210T"}
