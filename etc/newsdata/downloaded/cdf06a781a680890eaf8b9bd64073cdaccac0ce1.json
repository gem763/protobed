In my heart I\u2019ll always be a Remainer. I hope if our British friends decide to return one day, our door will always be open\u201d We haven\u2019t left yet! #Commons will reject dealpic.twitter.com/gwgm5D0M50 \u2014 Richard Corbett (@RCorbettMEP) October 17, 2019\n\n\u201cOn a personal note, what I feel today is sadness,\u201d added the 62-year-old. \u201cIn my heart I\u2019ll always be a Remainer. I hope if our British friends decide to return one day, our door will always be open.\u201d\n\nPresident Juncker went even further, remarking that he \u201cwould like to say to the 48 per cent [of British voters who backed Remain] that they were right\u201d in a characteristically antagonistic fashion.\n\n\u201cI am happy and relieved that we reached a deal but I am sad because Brexit is happening,\u201d he added.\n\nTory Brexiteers in Parliament appear to be rowing in behind the new deal, despite the EU having made it clear that, excepting the contentious backstop arrangements for Northern Ireland, it leaves the terms of Theresa May\u2019s deal \u201cunchanged in substance\u201d.\n\nConservative & Unionist MPs must take a stand for the Union and join us in rejecting this deal. Internal & burdensome trade barriers will be erected within the UK without parallel consent from both unionists & nationalists. This is not Brexit. \u2014 Sammy Wilson MP (@eastantrimmp) October 18, 2019\n\nWe don't abstain on the Union! https://t.co/6x1O0Cw54S \u2014 Sammy Wilson MP (@eastantrimmp) October 18, 2019\n\nAs regards Northern Ireland, the British province\u2019s Brexit-supporting Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which the Tories rely on for a parliamentary majority, say the changes to the deal are not sufficient for them to support it.\n\nJohnson\u2019s version of the deal improves on the backstop insofar as it asserts Northern Ireland will remain part of the United Kingdom customs union, but undermines this by adding that trade between mainland Great Britain and the province will be subject to customs checks \u2014 one of the defining characteristics of not being in a customs union. ]\n\nNorthern Ireland will also be obliged to adopt the regulatory rules of the EU Single Market, which could result in major divergence between the province and the rest of the United Kingdom over the longer term.\n\nThe revised Protocol responds to the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland with the aim of protecting peace and stability. All other elements of the Withdrawal Agreement remain unchanged in substance, as per the agreement reached on 14 November 2018. \u2014 European Commission \ud83c\uddfa (@EU_Commission) October 17, 2019\n\nFollow Jack Montgomery on Twitter: @JackBMontgomery", "description": "EU Council president Donald Tusk has contradicted EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, saying Brexit could be delayed yet again.", "authors": ["Jack Montgomery"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/eu-tusk-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
