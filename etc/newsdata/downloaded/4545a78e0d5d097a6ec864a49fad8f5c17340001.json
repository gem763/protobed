Some have been sent to Niger in the past, but few countries have so far come forward to take them.\n\nRwanda, which at one time in 1994 had over 2 million of its citizens displaced after a genocide, signed a deal with the United Nations last month.\n\n\u201cWe thank God. We cannot explain the life back there in Libya. There is fighting and we couldn\u2019t even sleep peacefully at night. Now, we feel safe,\u201d Zainab Yousef, one of the asylum seekers, said in Somali through a translator in video footage provided by UNHCR. She was being processed at a centre 50 kilometres (30 miles) south of Kigali.\n\nUNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch said in a statement that the refugees arrived in Kigali late on Thursday aboard a U.N.-chartered flight. Many were children, including a baby born in Libyan detention two weeks ago.\n\n\u201cIn total, 26 of the evacuees were refugee children, nearly all of them unaccompanied, without a family member or parent,\u201d Baloch said. \u201cOne evacuee had not been outside a detention centre for more than four years.\u201d\n\nUNHCR said the group was from Sudan, Somalia and Eritrea. They have been given asylum-seeker status while the agency determines whether they are refugees.\n\n\u201cA second evacuation flight is expected in the coming weeks as UNHCR continues every effort to get vulnerable refugees in Libya out of harm\u2019s way and to safety,\u201d said Baloch.\n\nUNHCR said it will spend $10 million this year on flying the refugees from Libya to Rwanda and building facilities that will provide basic aid and services.\n\nPeople smugglers have exploited the turmoil in Libya since 2011 to send hundreds of thousands of migrants on dangerous journeys across the central Mediterranean, though the number of crossings dropped sharply from 2017 amid an EU-backed push to block departures.\n\nMigrant detention centres are nominally administered by the Libyan government but often controlled by armed groups. Aid workers and rights groups say abuse is rife, including beatings and forced labour, and have long appealed for their closure.", "description": "Rwanda has received 66 asylum-seekers that were being held in a Libyan detention centre, the first of a group of 500 to be sent there under a new agreement with the United Nations to help resettle people detained while trying to reach Europe.", "authors": ["Clement Uwiringiyimana", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
