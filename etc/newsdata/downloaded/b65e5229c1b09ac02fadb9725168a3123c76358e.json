In essence, Mr. McConnell\u2019s maneuver is tantamount to making the Senate a rubber stamp for the president, and hence part of the executive branch \u2014 something our Founding Fathers vigorously sought to avoid. All Americans, regardless of party affiliation and political ideology, should find Mr. McConnell\u2019s stance reprehensible.\n\nRICHARD CHERWITZ\n\nErnest S.
