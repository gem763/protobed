You'll find that Charleston appeals to every traveler, every mood and every appetite. 10Best Editors, USA TODAY 10Best\n\nCHARLESTON, S.C. \u2013 This is one of America\u2019s most-visited cities year after year. First-timers check out the City Market, take a bus or carriage tour through downtown neighborhoods dripping with history or visit Fort Sumter and see a plantation or two. All are major attractions \u2013 must-sees for thousands.\n\nThe handful of highlights is the agenda of most tour operators. Surface-scratching is their business model built on visitor appeal, tour length and logistics.\n\nBut there\u2019s much more to see and do. Here\u2019s where top travel pros in the area suggest for an added value \u201csomething different\u201d:\n\nSee Charleston by water\n\nTravel experts in Charleston are big on exploring downtown by water \u2013 both for the cityscape and for the sunsets. Take a guided kayak tour, or just rent a kayak and explore on your own. (Photo: Courtesy of ExploreCharleston.com)\n\nDowntown is flanked by the Ashley and Cooper rivers as they enter the sea, and physically going with the flow points up the skyline and is a potent reminder of the city\u2019s maritime history. The views are spectacular at sunset.\n\n\u201cKayak tours are lot of fun,\u201d says John LaVerne, owner of Bulldog Tours. \u201cOr rent a kayak at Wild Dunes or Shem Creek, and explore on your own.\n\n\u201cMore tourists take it than locals, but the Schooner Pride sunset cruise is pretty amazing. It goes close to Fort Sumter, and at sunset, it parks off the Battery and the antebellum mansions behind it. The price is incredibly good.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s great boating an easy drive from downtown, too, he says. \u201cOut Bohicket Road, near Kiawah Island, Holy City Sailing does charter sailboats and cruises. The charter that goes from Bohicket down to the coast showcases an inlet sunset that seems to last for eternity.\u201d\n\nChristina Knoth of Lowcountry Walking Tours suggests an in-town option: Ride the water taxi that crosses the Cooper between downtown and Mount Pleasant. \u201cYou can board it at the Maritime Center, near the S.C. Aquarium, or Waterfront Park, near City Market, and cross over to Patriots Point and the Harbor Marina near it. Just going back and forth between the stops gives you great views of the skyline, the Cooper bridge and the harbor.\u201d An all-day pass is $12.\n\nDo a bridge walk\n\nThe water taxi provides great views of the stunning Cooper River bridge. You can also walk the bridge from downtown Charleston to Mount Pleasant. Pedestrian lanes are on the south side of the span. (Photo: Courtesy of ExploreCharleston.com)\n\nThe Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge is a modern marvel, a visually stunning cabled span that elegantly holds eight lanes of U.S. 17 over the Cooper River. It\u2019s the site of the Cooper River Bridge Run, a 10K held in early April.\n\nAny time of year. the views from its pedestrian lanes are sumptuous. The bridge, Lynn Seldon says, \u201chas become a playground for walkers, runners and cyclists, morning to night, while the busy weekends have their own party vibe.\u201d\n\nVisit Charleston's oldest suburb\n\nPitt Street Pharmacy is in the heart of downtown Mount Pleasant. (Photo: John Bordsen/Special to USA TODAY)\n\nMount Pleasant, at the eastern end of the bridge, is Charleston\u2019s oldest suburb.\n\n\u201cThat part of town is a best-kept secret that will take your breath away,\" LaVerne says. \"Pitt Street is the hub of the small downtown, and near Pitt Street Pharmacy, you can take a Segway tour.\u201d\n\nDo a cemetery walk at St. Philips\n\nTour operator Tommy Dew says a great place to visit on your own is the cemetery at St. Philips Episcopal Church, in downtown Charleston\u2019s historic French Quarter. (Photo: John Bordsen/Special to USA TODAY)\n\nTommy Dew of TD\u2019s Walking Tours hits the historic high spots in downtown Charleston \u2013 but he says what\u2019s in the ground makes it under-the-radar cool. St. Phillips Episcopal Church Cemetery is a \"virtual South Carolina hall of fame,\" he says.\n\nPick up a free brochure at the church and find the location of the graves of statesman John C. Calhoun; Edward Rutledge, who signed the Declaration of Independence at age 26; and Charles Pinckney, dubbed \"Constitution Charlie\" for his role as a signatory in 1787.\n\nAlso buried there is Rebecca Brewton Motte \u2013 an important Revolutionary War heroine that Dew says was \"so hated by the British that they confiscated her home here and also turned her country home in St. Matthews into a fort. So she bought rockets for Francis Marion, the \u2018Swamp Fox,\u2019 to burn it to the ground.\u201d\n\nThe landscaping is beautiful. Dew notes that the cemetery\u2019s live oak is one of the largest in the city.\n\nCatch a wave or a fish at Folly Beach\n\nThe Edwin S. Taylor Fishing Pier, positioned 23 feet above sea level, is popular with anglers and walkers. (Photo: John Bordsen/Special to USA TODAY)\n\nSouth of downton, Folly Beach is where natives go to enjoy laid-back, Key West-style ambience. Walk the beach and the long fishing pier. It\u2019s prime for relaxation, says Benjamin Criscitiello, director of tourism for Pineapple Tour Group, which offers bus and walking tours of Charleston.\n\nLaVerne says, \u201cIt\u2019s not for everybody, but the Sand Dollar there is an institution, with everyone from 70-year-old hippies to millennials and bikers. There\u2019s live music pretty much every night.\u201d\n\nSee where 'The Patriot' and 'The Notebook' were filmed\n\nCypress Gardens, a pastoral attraction in Berkeley County, is out of range for short guided tours \u2013 about an hour north of downtown, in Moncks Corners \u2013 but its 170 acres offer miles of trails through Lowcountry gardens and swamplands.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most beautiful, off-the-beaten-path places you can find, with natural life second to none,\u201d LaVerne says.\n\nHollywood has already been here: You may recognize locations featured in Mel Gibson\u2019s Revolutionary War movie, \u201cThe Patriot\u201d (2000), the Civil War film \"Cold Mountain\" (2003) and the 2004 tearjerker \u201cThe Notebook.\u201d\n\nScenes from 2000's \"The Patriot,\" starring Mel Gibson and Heath Ledger, were filmed at Cypress Gardens. (Photo: Andrew Cooper/Columbia Tri-Star Pictures)\n\nChow down\n\nThere's no shortage of restaurants and great seafood \u2013 or tourists. Once discovered, Lowcountry dining spots can sprout lines and waits. Foodies may want to opt for one of several culinary tours instead.\n\nLynn and Cele Seldon suggest Chez Nous, a tiny, elegant spot that uses local ingredients in its French and northern Italian-inspired fare.\n\nOysters and shrimp make for a popular combo at Tavern and Table. (Photo: John Bordsen/Special to USA TODAY)\n\nChristina Knoth suggests heading to Shem Creek, the maritime/dining area in Mount Pleasant, where solid seafood restaurants (and a nice boardwalk) line the water. Her favorite? Tavern and Table.\n\nFor seafood, John LaVerne recommends Bowens Island Restaurant, on a small isle above the marshes just shy of Folly Beach on S.C. 151 (Folly Beach Road). It looks like a ramshackle roadhouse on stilts, but is a Charleston institution. (Photo: John Bordsen/Special to USA TODAY)\n\nLaVerne suggests heading to rustic Bowen\u2019s Island Restaurant, about 25 minutes southwest of downtown Charleston on one of the marshy isles leading to Folly Beach. It\u2019s famous for fried shrimp and oysters. He\u2019s addicted to viewing its wild landscapes at sunset.\n\nDew takes a different approach: Go for good bar food at scruffy places locals frequent. \u201cMoe\u2019s Crosstown Tavern has a killer burger. I\u2019d also suggest Tattooed Moose.\u201d\n\nEmbrace your inner chef\n\nWhile culinary tours take you to several of Charleston\u2019s best dining spots, foodies in search of a more hands-on experience should search out Bob Waggoner's Market Street kitchen, where diners help make their own meals. Reservations are required (and visitors are advised do so well in advance). (Photo: Courtesy of ExploreCharleston.com)\n\nSeveral tour operators offer culinary tours of Charleston\u2019s top restaurants \u2013 but why not learn to cook with one of the pros?\n\nLynn Seldon says, \u201cBob Waggoner was the longtime chef at the Charleston Grill, and he now offers often sold-out cooking classes in a contemporary Market Street kitchen and dining space. The 2-to-3-hour classes feature different menus every night and include convivial cooking instruction, active participation and a tasty dinner.\u201d\n\nTake in a magic show\n\nHoly City Magic is a small venue, so you\u2019re not far from the act you came for. Like Charleston itself, there\u2019s more surprising stuff to see than meets the casual eye. (Photo: Courtesy of Holy City Magic)\n\nOne of the hottest tickets, according to LaVerne, is the new, 50-seat Holy City Magic club where illusionist Howard Blackwell and guest artists perform. Blackwell retired from the military in Charleston and bases his touring magic career there.\n\nAfter playing area clubs and cafes and Piccolo Spoleto (the more eclectic sibling of Charleston\u2019s famous Spoleto arts festival), he opened his own place at Meeting and Johns streets this summer.\n\nShop at Historic Charleston Foundation\n\nLooking for an alternative to City Market as a source for quality Charleston souvenirs? Lynn Seldon, co-authors of \u201c100 Things to Do in Charleston Before You Die,\u201d recommends the Historic Charleston Foundation shop on Meeting Street. (Photo: Courtesy of Seldonik.com)\n\nYou can find sweetgrass baskets and other local crafts at the Historic City Market. But Lynn Seldon, who co-authored \u201c100 Things to Do in Charleston Before You Die\u201d with wife Cele. suggests walking three blocks south to the shop operated by HCF.\n\nThere you'll find quality items, ranging from notecards to home furnishings, in a less stressful environment. \u201cThe foundation works with talented artisans to create beautiful objects that reflect the vibrant urban city.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2019/10/03/charleston-south-carolina-10-less-touristy-spots-and-activities/3843028002/", "description": "Charleston's top travel pros share their favorite off-the-beaten-path spots and activities for when you want to try something a little different.", "authors": ["John Bordsen", "Special To Usa Today", "Published A.M.
