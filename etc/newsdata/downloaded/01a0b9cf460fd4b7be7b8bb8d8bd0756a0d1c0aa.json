God, in his mercy and unfathomable love, began drawing people to himself across the Colonies, including inspiring Edwards to deliver a no-nonsense sermon to a congregation described as \u201cthoughtless and vain.\u201d\n\nThat bold sermon became a powerful force in the Great Awakening that created the moral foundation and intestinal fortitude required to launch, persevere through and win the Revolutionary War, securing both a new nation and personal liberty.\n\nMake no mistake: This revival was not rooted in some amorphous sense of spirituality, wherein each man determined what was \u201cright\u201d for himself based on desires and emotions. The revival was centered around the God of the Bible, who says who He is and commands how we should live.\n\nToday, our culture again is suffering from thoughtless vanity as Americans increasingly reject God Almighty. Our many societal problems \u2014 from violence to rising suicide rates to abortion to drug abuse to failed families to sexual disorientation \u2014 all stem from our cultural failure to worship the one triune God, to recognize him as the Creator and ourselves as men and women created in his image.\n\nWe have forgotten that it is \u201cHe that hath made us, and not we ourselves.\u201d (Psalms 100:3)\n\nOur churches fail to boldly proclaim the raw, beautiful, challenging, captivating Gospel of Jesus Christ and God\u2019s immense love for us.\n\nOur pastors too frequently deliver a candy-coated version of God\u2019s love, instead of the iron-clad love that cares enough to teach us how we must live in order to be whole.\n\nWe have discarded God\u2019s moral absolutes and replaced his instruction book with the doctrine that it is possible to thrive living any ol\u2019 way we wish.\n\nSuch pagan spirituality does not understand the difference between an angry God and a hateful one.\n\nJonathan Edwards preached that God is angry at our disobedience and pride because he knows it will lead to our destruction. The image is not unlike the father who is angry at his teenage son when he steals the car and careens down the road at 100 mph drunk on his foolish arrogance and ignorant bliss.\n\nMost Americans are ignorant of both Scripture and our historical dance with death before our forefathers and mothers were challenged by the truth and fell to their knees in repentance and worship of their Creator. These colonists rediscovered the faith that their own forefathers and mothers \u2014 the Pilgrims \u2014 had known: a faith so strong that it sent them on a quest for freedom across dangerous seas.\n\nIf not for the spiritual revival that swept through the Colonies, the dream of freedom would have died along with their souls.\n\nThe Great Awakening also produced the wisdom of America\u2019s founders who knew from whom liberty comes: \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they endowed by their Creator with certain, unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\u201d\n\nIf \u201cthe governed\u201d do not recognize and worship God as Creator, then they will give their consent to be governed by something else. Life and liberty will not be protected as rights and will be infringed.\n\nTragically, this is America today.\n\nIf we continue to reject God and his moral absolutes, He will let us go our own way, neither interfering with our personal choices nor protecting us from their natural consequences.\n\nRefusing to follow the steps of Christ and instead determining our own path has placed us on a slippery slope. Edwards warned in his sermon, quoting from Deuteronomy in the Old Testament: \u201cTheir foot will slide in due time.\u201d\n\nSo too, will ours, unless we allow the Holy Spirit to open our eyes to our precarious condition and permit him to rescue us from it.\n\nAmerica is in desperate need of healing, and the church must lead the way. 2 Chronicles 7:14 is clear: \u201cIf my people, which are called by name, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and heal their land.\u201d\n\nNext week: Fostering a culture of life.\n\n\u2981 Rebecca Hagelin can be reached at [email protected]\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
