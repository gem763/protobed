Close enough, the Washington Post notes, that the Trump administration has begun to declare victory in preparation for departing the field. Mike Pompeo carefully parsed this victory as pertaining to the \u201coriginal mission\u201d of the war in Afghanistan in an interview with the Daily Signal:\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States has \u201cdelivered\u201d on its mission to oust al-Qaeda from Afghanistan and deter terrorist attacks plotted in the country and neighboring Pakistan. The top diplomat\u2019s upbeat message came ahead of a potential announcement of a peace deal between the United States and Taliban that has been tested by repeated Taliban bombings and is opposed by President Trump\u2019s national security adviser. In an interview published Wednesday with the Daily Signal, a news outlet affiliated with the conservative Heritage Foundation, Pompeo said American forces engaged in the United States\u2019 longest war have been \u201csuccessful\u201d in achieving their original mission.\n\nOddly (nor maybe not so much), the Post doesn\u2019t actually provide a link to the Daily Signal article. Nevertheless, their characterization of Pompeo\u2019s remarks matches that of the Daily Signal\u2019s Nolan Peterson, who took note of the \u201cshifting goal posts\u201d of the Secretary of State:\n\n\u201cIf you go back and look at the days following 9/11, the objectives set out were pretty clear: to go defeat al-Qaeda, the group that had launched the attack on the United States of America from Afghanistan. And today, al-Qaeda \u2026 doesn\u2019t even amount to a shadow of its former self in Afghanistan,\u201d Pompeo told The Daily Signal in an exclusive interview. \u201cWe have delivered,\u201d the secretary of state added in the telephone interview. \u2026 Despite the shifting goal posts for what victory in Afghanistan looks like, Pompeo said U.S. forces have been \u201csuccessful\u201d in achieving their original mission. \u201cThere is a real achievement that has taken place, and we have in fact for now almost two decades greatly reduced the risk that an attack on the United States of America would emanate from Afghan soil, or for that matter from Pakistan as well,\u201d Pompeo told The Daily Signal.\n\nPeterson\u2019s not the only one noticing the goalposts moving. The Afghan government has publicly objected to the deal forming between the US and the Taliban, in part because the Afghan government doesn\u2019t have much say in it. However, president Ashraf Ghani also criticizes the proposal because it doesn\u2019t have any enforcement mechanism if the Taliban break their word:\n\nThe Afghan government is criticizing parts of a proposed U.S.-Taliban deal to withdraw U.S. and other foreign forces from Afghanistan, saying the accord contains no clear penalties if the insurgency fails to comply. Zalmay Khalilzad, the chief U.S. negotiator to the Afghan peace process, said this week that he had completed an agreement in principle with the insurgents, more than a year after Washington resumed direct talks with Taliban officials in the Gulf state of Qatar. Mr. Khalilzad told a local television station on Monday that the deal awaited only President Trump\u2019s approval.\n\nThat would explain why Pompeo\u2019s on a PR campaign to declare victory on the \u201coriginal mission.\u201d The mission quickly evolved into a project to restore human rights and democracy in Afghanistan, however, and the US and NATO have spent almost two decades attempting to shore up Kabul\u2019s recognized government as the sole legitimate power in the country. At some point, that government has to stand on its own, but the terms of the peace deal appear to divide that legitimacy with the Taliban\u2019s claim of an \u201cemirate\u201d \u2014 apparently with the US\u2019 blessing:\n\n\u201cIt is not clear what happens if and when the Taliban fail to comply with the commitments they\u2019re making to the U.S.,\u201d a senior official said. \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee of any action.\u201d The government also complained about the U.S. allowing the Taliban to sign the accord as \u201cthe Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.\u201d Whether to call the country an emirate or\u2014as the government and the international community officially refer to it\u2014the \u201cIslamic Republic of Afghanistan\u201d is an issue to be discussed in Norway. By using it in the Doha accord, the U.S. is \u201cgiving the Taliban a legitimacy, almost puts them in a position of being a government,\u201d the official said. \u201cThe U.S. never called them that. We never call them that\u2014we called them terrorists. This is the first time this has happened.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of which \u2026 here\u2019s the \u201cemirate\u201d in action:\n\nAn American is among two NATO service members killed in the latest Taliban attack in the capital of Afghanistan. The car bomb in Kabul yesterday killed 12 people and wounded 42 others. @charliecbs is in Afghanistan with more: pic.twitter.com/d13hqLVgdj \u2014 CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) September 6, 2019\n\nWhile it\u2019s getting more difficult to explain what our goals are in Afghanistan, this doesn\u2019t look like \u201csuccess\u201d or victory. It looks like we\u2019re bugging out, and we\u2019re betraying the people we asked to help pull Afghanistan back into modernity by leaving them at the mercy of the thugs. Expect that lesson to be long remembered by more strategic potential allies than the Afghans.", "description": "Emirate?", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pompeo-smile.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
