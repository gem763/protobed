The women in the stylised images were not in fancy haute couture, but instead wore khaki jumpsuits and held machine guns. These were the female fighters of the YPG \u2013 the main Kurdish group of the Syrian Democratic Forces \u2013 in Rojava, a de facto autonomous region in northern Syria.\n\nThese women were praised for their bravery in fighting against the most unfathomable evil of our times, Isis. The world championed them as an antidote to the death cult originating from the Middle East, which spread its ideas to Europe and the US. At the same time, the women remained quite invisible to Turkish audiences, because of their connection to the PKK (Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party) which has been designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the US and the EU.\n\nFor many years, there has been an on-and-off cold war between Kurdish political activists and the Turkish left \u2013the despite being natural allies\n\nLast week when the US president decided to tacitly back Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, the Turkish president, in his military operation in northern Syria, there was much talk of the plight of the Kurds \u2013 the word \u201cbetrayal\u201d circulated in the higher echelons of Washington political circles, mostly as a domestic political tool against the president. But many around the world genuinely felt the burden of what had happened. This time the death toll from the ongoing war somewhere in the Middle Eastern dust with ever changing names and extremely complex details had come with recognisable female faces \u2013 those of the beautiful, young YPG fighters.\n\nThe international reaction against the Turkish incursion into Syria was a rare instance of unhesitant moral outcry since the outbreak of war in 2011. It wasn\u2019t just because of the Kurdish fighters, but also because the western countries embroiled in the conflict were aware of their own moral responsibility for having opened up a Syrian Pandora\u2019s box to Donald Trump\u2019s mesmerising vulgarity and Erdo\u011fan\u2019s madman politics.\n\nEvery actor in the conflict may have had their own expectations for an exit strategy from this mess, but the general idea seemed to be to make it up as you go along \u2013 or, to put it in a more Middle Eastern fashion: \u201cThe caravan gets in line once it hits the road.\u201d The betrayal of the Kurds didn\u2019t simply come from Trump\u2019s impulsive actions, leaving a US ally alone in the region, but rather because there was an international consensus of disregard.\n\nAs footage of military action in northern Syria began appearing last week, pro-Kurdish politicians in Turkey were first to respond. Since the beginning of war several years ago, this group have been split between responding to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s massive oppression of dissent in national politics, and the developments beyond their borders. But Turkey\u2019s nationalist war-on-terror narrative has invaded the media, and as it became clear that these are extremely dangerous times in Turkey, even the strongest opposition voices were scared into silence, out of fear of finding themselves in prison for a tweet. Yet whether fear is the only reason for this silence is another matter.\n\nFor many years, there has been a cold war between Kurdish political activists and the Turkish left \u2013 despite being natural allies in the fight against human rights violations and towards democratisation. This conflict crystalised in 2003, just before the Iraq war. While the Turkish left was organising anti-war demonstrations, Kurdish politicians seemed reticent: some of them were beguiled by the potential for a Kurdish state in Northern Iraq once the US invasion began \u2013 a long-term aspiration for some Kurds.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan during their meeting in Sochi, Russia, on Tuesday.

The conventional left criticised Kurdish politicians for falling for Erdo\u011fan\u2019s false promises \u2013 but Kurds did not want to miss a historic chance for a peaceful settlement.\n\nThe irreparable damage on all sides came with the Syrian war. While the US-backed YPG, and Kurdish armed forces in general, earned international recognition for their brave fight against Isis, the broader Kurdish question appeared dramatically different to the Turkish one. Until then, it was a more narrow question of democratisation and human rights in Turkey \u2013 but with Syria it became a Middle Eastern conflict. Ordinary, progressive Turkish people were barely able to follow the storyline of complex international power struggles. The Kurds were now playing the big game with big players on the world stage, they thought, and the Turkish left\u2019s plate was full taking on Erdo\u011fan\u2019s repressive regime anyway.\n\nThe left believed that the Kurds betrayed the democracy struggle in Turkey \u2013 while the Kurds believed that the left abandoned them in their battle for existence. Meanwhile, the only political figure who could have helped mend the broken ties between these sides, Selahattin Demirta\u015f, co-leader of the HDP \u2013 the pro-Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic party \u2013 has been in prison since 2016.\n\nErdo\u011fan threatens to ramp up assault on Kurds in Syria 'safe zone' Read more\n\nThis all goes to explain the silence in Turkey among the Kurds\u2019 natural allies and supporters.\n\nThe only character who seems to have a plan in this sorry story is Russian president Vladimir Putin, who met with Erdo\u011fan on Tuesday. In a new world where global decisions are made not by transparent democratic institutions but by a few men behind closed doors, they will decide the destiny of the Kurdish people.\n\nI am stuck with the image of a Kurdish female fighter in Rojava today who is facing the disgusting banality of history being made in mafioso fashion. Some Americans will use her betrayal by Trump as a means to pursue their desire to topple the president. For Putin and Assad, she is a precious bargaining chip. Erdo\u011fan has already used her as a tool for the most effective consolidation of power in domestic politics for a decade.\n\nAs the daughter of a people who for centuries have been swept back and forth through a viciously contested location, continually facing death in the hope of being recognised, this YPG fighter will wonder if her fight against Isis will really be remembered at all.\n\n\u2022 Ece Temelkuran is a Turkish journalist and political commentator, and author of How to Lose a Country: The 7 Steps from Democracy to Dictatorship", "description": "They have fought Isis with unparalleled bravery.
