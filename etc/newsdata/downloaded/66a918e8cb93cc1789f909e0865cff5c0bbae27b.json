Anthony Amada and Officer Plenio Massiah wanted to speak with Yadiel Torres, 18, seen on the roof, top left, in connection with a possible stolen car\n\nWhen police arrived, Torres, pictured, ran upstairs and jumped onto his roof\n\nDown below, police officers could be heard encouraging Torres to jump down to the ground\n\nWhen officers arrived at the home, the man, identified as Yadiel Torres ran upstairs and climbed through a window onto the roof.\n\nA police body camera showed the man sitting on the edge of the roof some nine feet above the ground, with his feet dangling over the edge when he was suddenly pushed without warning.\n\nOfficers could be heard urging Torres to 'Come down!' and 'You're going to get tased and you're going to fall. So, you better jump!'\n\nBut Torres, refused to jump down to the patio below where Sgt. Anthony Amada was waiting for him according to WFTV.\n\nOfficer Massiah chased Torres and was encouraged by a fellow officer to push him off\n\nBoth officers were disciplined as a result of this action as Torres was pushed. Amada resigned\n\n'Now you've got no choice but to jump down, now you've got no choice,' Officer Massiah told Torres.\n\nAmada then repeatedly told Officer Plenio Massiah, who was up on the roof, to push him down.\n\n'Push him off the roof! Push him off! Just push him off! Push him off!' Amada said.\n\nVideo shows Massiah placing his right hand on Torres' right shoulder and shoving him off the nine-foot roof to the ground below, whereupon Amada tasered him as soon as he hit the concrete reports WKMG.\n\nTorres fell nine feet to the ground whereupon he was tased by Sgt. Amada\n\n'All right, hey, I'm down. I'm not resisting,' Torres screamed as the Taser was fired into him\n\n'All right, hey, I'm down. I'm not resisting,' Torres screamed as the Taser was fired into him.\n\nKissimmee police said both officers wrongfully put Torres in danger.\n\nIncredibly, Torres was not injured after the fall, but the Kissimmee police chief said that he could have been.\n\nKissimmee police have launched an internal investigation into the actions of the officer and the sergeant.\n\nA report concluded that the officer Massiah feared that there could have been a struggle between himself and the suspect while up on the roof that would have seen them both fall off.\n\nIncredibly, Torres was not injured in the fall or subsequent tasing. He is pictured here falling to the ground\n\nPolice said a woman who called the police to report the car theft, Torres' ex-girlfriend, told them that he was known to be armed, although there was no evidence that he was.\n\nAs a result of the police investigation, the department docked Massiah for eight hours vacation time, 'for failing to follow KPD general order'.\n\nThe police code of conduct notes: 'Members shall use only the degree of force necessary to affect lawful objectives.'\n\nPolice Chief Jeff O'Dell said, 'Massiah's decision to push the suspect off the roof could have resulted in significant injury.'\n\nAmada, who had 14 years of experience with the force, ended up resigning from the department in June.\n\nHe had already been disciplined in a separate case when this particular investigation began and would have been fired in this instance.", "description": "Kissimmee police Sgt.
