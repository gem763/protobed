UPDATE 6-Oil prices rise on prospects for U.S.-China trade deal\n\n* China says progress made in trade talks with United States\n\n* U.S. crude stockpiles seen higher for sixth week - poll\n\n* Goldman Sachs lowers 2020 demand growth outlook to 1.3 mln\n\nbpd\n\n\n\n(Updates prices)\n\nBy Bozorgmehr Sharafedin\n\nLONDON, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Tuesday after\n\nChina signalled progress in trade talks with the United States,\n\nbut gains were capped by bearish forecasts of a buildup in U.S.\n\ncrude stockpiles.\n\nBrent crude oil was up 66 cents at $59.62 a barrel\n\nby 1337 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude was\n\n77 cents higher at $54.08 per barrel.\n\nChina and the United States have achieved some progress in\n\ntheir trade talks, Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng said on\n\nTuesday, and any problems could be resolved as long as both\n\nsides respected each other. \"While the encouraging mood across financial markets will\n\nremain stimulated by trade optimism, risk aversion could still\n\nmake an abrupt return should talks drag on or turn sour,\" said\n\nLukman Otunuga, analyst at FXTM.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund last week forecast that\n\nfallout from the U.S.-China trade war and trade disputes across\n\nthe world would slow global growth in 2019 to 3.0%, the weakest\n\nin a decade.\n\nLower economic growth typically means reduced demand for\n\ncommodities such as oil.\n\nPrices were also pressured by forecasts of a buildup in U.S.\n\ncrude stockpiles. Inventories are expected to have risen for a\n\nsixth straight week, while distillates and gasoline stocks\n\nlikely fell in the week to Oct. 18, a Reuters poll showed.\n\nThe poll was conducted ahead of reports from the American\n\nPetroleum Institute (API), an industry group, and the Energy\n\nInformation Administration (EIA), an agency of the U.S.\n\nDepartment of Energy.\n\n\"Expectations that the API and EIA will report that U.S.\n\ncrude oil inventories increased by around 3 million barrels over\n\nthe last week certainly do not help sentiment,\" ING analyst\n\nWarren Patterson said.\n\n\"These more visible stock builds, along with demand concerns\n\ncontinuing to linger, suggest it is becoming increasingly more\n\ndifficult to see a sustained rally in prices ahead of the OPEC+\n\nmeeting in early December.\"\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries,\n\nRussia and other oil producers, an alliance known as OPEC+, have\n\npledged to cut production by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd)\n\nuntil March 2020. The producers meet again on Dec. 5-6.\n\nRussian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said U.S. oil\n\nproduction is likely to peak in the next few years as current\n\noil prices are capping the pace of expansion. The brisk pace of U.S. production, now the world's highest,\n\nin the past few years has been a key factor behind the relative\n\nweakness in oil prices. Output has slowed recently, however.\n\n\n\nPMI https://tmsnrt.rs/2MVbXFy\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>\n\n", "description": "UPDATE 6-Oil prices rise on prospects for U.S.-China trade deal", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEAA50PT_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
