Privacy experts that were brought in by Social Science One raised concerns about disclosing too much personal information, according to The Times. The result was that Facebook started to apply \"differential privacy,\" which means that researchers can learn a lot about a group from data, but virtually nothing about an individual, The Times wrote.\n\nBut some of the researchers say that Facebook's privacy concerns here have been overblown, and it's limiting their work.\n\nDipayan Ghosh, a former privacy and public policy adviser at Facebook and a fellow at the Shorenstein Center at Harvard told The Times that, \"Silicon Valley has a moral obligation to do all it can to protect the American political process.\n\n\"We need researchers to have access to study what went wrong,\" he said, referring to disinformation campaigns that spread during the 2016 election campaign.\n\n\"At one level, it's difficult as there's a large amount of data and Facebook has concerns around privacy,\" Tom Glaisyer, chairman of the group of seven nonprofits supporting the research efforts, told The Times. \"But frankly, our digital public square doesn't appear to be serving our democracy,\" he added.\n\nRead more: Facebook is the most popular social network for governments spreading fake news and propaganda\n\nIn October 2017, Facebook admitted that 126 million Americans had likely seen Russian misinformation over a two-year period up till August 2017.\n\nDisinformation is still rife on the platform and is continuing to grow. Last week, research from the University of Oxford showed Facebook was the number one global platform of choice for political parties and governments to spread fake news.", "description": "Facebook previously said it would share detailed data with researchers and academics that they could use to study and prevent the spread of disinformation.", "authors": ["Mary Hanbury"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d44587f100a2409ae6c5582-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
