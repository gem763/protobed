National elections were contested in 57 parliamentary constituencies and, as dictated by the country\u2019s Constitution, any party with a presidential candidate that wins more than 50% of those constituencies takes the helm.\n\nBotswana IEC spokesperson, Osupile Maroba, said earlier that the country\u2019s Chief Justice, Terence Rannowane, was on standby to pronounce the new president when any presidential candidate\u2019s party hit the threshold mark.\n\nUnless it starts catching up, the UDC could slowly be watching parliamentary seats slipping through its fingers as BDP continues collecting.\n\nDuring campaigns, the UDC made it clear it was working towards removing Masisi and BDP.\n\nThe opposition scored 17 parliamentary seats in its first elections in 2014 while BDP took 27 and Botswana Congress Party took the remaining three.\n\nThe first parliamentary seat announced earlier on Thursday was won by BDP in Kgalagadi North with 5534 votes, closely followed by UDC with 5072 votes.\n\nIt was announced within an hour that the UDC has also won its first seat in Phikwe West with 2987 votes with the BDP right on its tail with 2537.\n\nThe graph kept on going up and down with the two parties overtaking each other as results trickled in. The leader was UDC with five seats and UDC with three just before 6pm.\n\nThe Alliance for Progressives (AP) which was formed after its leader and presidential candidate, Ndaba Gaolathe, left the UDC, had at the time won a National Assembly seat in Francistown South.\n\nA breakaway party from BDP, Botswana Progressive Party (BPF), had by 10pm collected two seats in Serowe.\n\nThe party was contesting in 19 constituencies with 18 of them based in Central District which is a historically a BDP stronghold but includes Serowe areas where former president Ian Khama reins as Paramount Chief of Bangwato.\n\nKhama and his brother, Tshekedi Khama, followed each other out of the BDP which was co-founded by their father and Botswana\u2019s first president, Sir Seretse Khama, and joined the BPF.\n\nTshekedi was contesting for a parliamentary seat in Serowe and he would be returning to Parliament in a BPF cap after winning Serowe West constituency in what could arguably be a show of loyalty to the Khama brothers by their tribal community.\n\nVote counting continues.", "description": "Botswana\u2019s decades-long governing party has begun taking the lead, giving strong indications that its leader, Mokgweeetsi Masisi, may retain his position as president.", "authors": ["Poloko Tau"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9519/19870f1c63b84bb88ac261e7f4cb8796.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
