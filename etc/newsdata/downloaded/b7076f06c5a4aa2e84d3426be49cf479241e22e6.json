One of the lead bullets was merely millimetres away from his left eye. To say he is one lucky bird is an understatement.'\n\nVet Lorenzo Crosta told ABC News he couldn't believe what he found after giving the bird an x-ray.\n\nMr Cocky had two pellets embedded in his chest, with the others found above his left eye and in his shoulder.\n\n'I mean, he's like winning the national lottery, this one, he's definitely very lucky being alive,' Dr Crosta told the publication.\n\nDr Crosta was able to remove all but the pellet in the bird's shoulder which he said at the moment isn't limiting the bird too much.\n\nIt is expected Mr Cocky will be on the recovery trail for a number of months before he will be freed back into the wild.\n\n'For now, Mr Cocky is enjoying his daily physiotherapy to increase his range of motion so that he may one day be released and given a second chance at life,' the post read.\n\nCockatoos are a protected species in New South Wales under the Biodiversity Conservation Act of 2016.\n\nThe maximum penalty for shooting a cockatoo is a fine up to $22,000 and five years in jail.\n\nIf you see someone partaking in such acts, please call the RSPCA on 1300 CRUELTY.", "description": "The sulphur-crested cockatoo,  named Mr Cocky, was brought into the\u00a0Avian Reptile and Exotic Pet Hospital south of Sydney, after he was found injured in a backyard in September.", "authors": ["Adam Mccleery For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/08/19478682-0-image-a-6_1570604923782.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
