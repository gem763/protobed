An average baseball game can last a little over three hours, but Tuesday\u2019s game will be televised with extended breaks for commercials that could leave many of the more than 40,000 expected attendees without a ride home under regular Metro hours. At the same time as first pitch, the Washington Mystics tip off in Game 2 of the nationally televised WNBA Finals nearly three miles south, at the 4,200-seat Entertainment and Sports Arena.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nStessel said the \u201cconfluence of two playoff games on the same night\u201d prompted the special arrangements. The extended-service plan was announced Monday afternoon, hours after a Metro representative had informed a fan on Twitter that the transit authority had been planning on keeping regular hours despite the games.\n\nGood afternoon. Tuesday 10/1, Metro will be operating on a normal rail schedule 5 am- 11:30 pm. You can view last train times departing from the Navy Yard station below. -KAhttps://t.co/yPoZNIxpxF \u2014 Metrorail Info (@Metrorailinfo) September 30, 2019\n\nStessel said Metro had asked both franchises whether their fans might need later rail service, but no request was made. Metro typically asks franchises, event and concert promoters or a sponsor to pay for the additional overtime costs associated with keeping 91 stations open late, estimated at about $100,000 per extra hour of service. The transit agency made an exception, realizing that throngs of people could be stranded, scrambling for rides without Metro service.\n\n\u201cWhile there has been no formal request to extend Metrorail service, we want to assure fans considering choosing Metro that we will get you home if the game runs later than expected,\u201d Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld and board chair Paul Smedberg said in a joint statement.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA similar arrangement was made in April for a Capitals playoff match.\n\nTo our @capitals fans, we are prepared to stay open as late as necessary to get you home tonight! Gallery Place, Metro Center 11/F, & Judiciary Sq entrances will remain open for entry 20 minutes after the game ends. Please spread the word at @CapitalOneArena #wmata #ALLCAPS \u2014 Metro (@wmata) April 25, 2019\n\nOnce Metro begins operating on extended time after 11:30 p.m., trains would continue to run systemwide. But only the Navy Yard station near the baseball park and possibly the Congress Heights station near the arena will permit riders inside. All other Metro stations will allow passengers to exit only.\n\nSure, if we're going later than normal closing, then Navy Yard-Ballpark (if Nationals) and/or Congress Heights (if Mystics) will be \"entry only,\" while all stations on all other lines will be \"exit only.\" We'll add this info to the web. It was a quick turn to get this out ASAP. \u2014 Metro (@wmata) September 30, 2019\n\nThe sudden decision comes just days after D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) and D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) sent top Metro officials a letter with a \u201cchallenge\u201d to restore late-night service hours full time. Service was curtailed from midnight closings on weeknights and 3 a.m. weekend closings in June 2016 when the transit authority launched its year-long SafeTrack rebuilding program. The project gave workers additional time to upgrade and repair infrastructure, and the Metro board kept the new hours in place indefinitely, saying the current schedule has helped the rail service operate more efficiently by giving workers more hours for preventive maintenance. Wiedefeld and board members said they plan to discuss restoring the later hours in the coming months.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nD.C. Mayor Bowser renews push for later Metro hours\n\nIn their statement, Wiedefeld and Smedberg said they will also discuss a more consistent plan on how to handle special sporting events.\n\n\u201cWhile this announcement addresses the immediate concern around Tuesday\u2019s games, the Metro Board will take up the broader issues concerning Metro\u2019s closing time and accommodating fans during playoff season in the coming months,\u201d the Metro statement said. \u201cThank you for your support of Metro. Go Mystics! Go Nats!\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Metro will extend service by up to one hour Tuesday night for fans attending the Mystics championship game and the Nationals Wild Card matchup.", "authors": ["Justin George", "Transportation Reporter Focusing On National Transit", "Metro", "The D.C.-Area Public Transportation System"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/LF8GBC3uqCnewS4cIBYI1w5QeAw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/2FHDJXHDDYI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
