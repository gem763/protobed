Relations with China, the effects of climate change and ending nuclear proliferation are among other challenges a future president may find harder to tackle in a post-Trump world.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that U.S. foreign policy is increasingly falling prey to partisan fighting in Washington. A Democratic president focused on reversing Trump\u2019s legacy \u2014 the same way Trump has tried to erase Barack Obama's legacy \u2014 runs the risk of feeding the perception that U.S. foreign policy will not remain stable over time.\n\n\u201cThere is a hunger for the U.S. to get back to its traditional role on the world stage,\u201d said Jeff Prescott, a former senior National Security Council official in the Obama administration. \u201cBut after Trump, many of our international partners are going to step back and ask whether signing up with us is going to be a long-term proposition.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s defenders view the situation differently.\n\nThey argue that Trump has injected a much-needed dose of truth into the foreign policy conversation, especially on problems that have festered for decades, such as North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. They assert that Trump\u2019s pressure on allies is often aimed at ultimately making them stronger. And while they agree Trump\u2019s rhetoric can go too far, they say his policies are not entirely unconventional.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a lot about recognizing reality and leveling with the American people,\u201d a senior Trump administration official said. \u201cThis administration is adhering to the rule of law and is telling the truth about the world. I\u2019d say that\u2019s a lot more durable than the last administration\u2019s approach.\u201d\n\nIn particular, Trump\u2019s approach to two sensitive topics \u2014 Iran and Israel \u2014 could have lasting effects.\n\nOn Iran, Trump has chilled slowly warming relations between the two countries.\n\nIt started with Trump\u2019s decision to pull the U.S. out of a nuclear deal with Iran. Then he reimposed the sanctions lifted under the deal and heaped on new ones.\n\nIranian President Hassan Rouhani says \"talks are useless\" when dealing with the United States. | Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nWhile most of the Democrats running for president have promised to rejoin the nuclear deal, which was negotiated under President Barack Obama, they must overcome an array of logistical and political hurdles, including Iran\u2019s own steps to violate the deal in light of Trump\u2019s sanctions.\n\nFor instance, Trump has declared Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist group, an unprecedented decision made despite warnings that it could spark retaliatory actions against American troops overseas. But even though Democrats widely disparaged the move, they might find it politically impossible in Washington to rescind the label, given that the IRGC has been blamed for hundreds of U.S. troop deaths in Iraq.\n\nTrump\u2019s provocations have helped raise military tensions in the Middle East and left Tehran proclaiming, \u201cTalks are useless.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that our enemies do not accept logic, we cannot respond with logic,\u201d Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech Thursday.\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters argue that such a standoff is the inevitable result of the United States finally getting tough on the Iranian regime. But it also means any sort of rapprochement could remain impossible long after Trump leaves office.\n\nAnother area where Trump has perhaps permanently changed the landscape is the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nNearly every step Trump has taken in the area has pleased Israel and angered the Palestinians. He ended U.S. financial aid to the Palestinians, closed their office in Washington and recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, despite the Palestinians\u2019 competing claims to the city. In response, the Palestinians have essentially cut off communication with Trump officials.\n\nThe Trump administration is also at work on a peace proposal for the Israelis and Palestinians, but the president\u2019s aides have indicated that the plan will not support a separate Palestinian state.\n\nA Democratic successor may recommit the U.S. to a two-state solution \u2014 long the American government's preferred approach \u2014 and even rebuild some of the bridges to the Palestinians that Trump has torched. Foreign policy veterans say it may be too late, though. Under Trump, an emboldened Israel already has made moves some predict will lead it to annex the West Bank, territory long claimed by the Palestinians.\n\nThe United States has found itself in a similar reputational crisis before.\n\nPresident George W. Bush\u2019s 2003 invasion of Iraq and its chaotic aftermath fueled tremendous global anger toward the United States.\n\nThe mere fact of Obama\u2019s election was seen as a rebuke of Bush\u2019s ideology and brought much relief overseas. The new president was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, to his own surprise, before he\u2019d finished a full year in office.\n\nGlobal Translations A new podcast series from POLITICO.

Trump has thrown into question America\u2019s support for what were once bedrock bipartisan principles, such as unwavering support for the NATO military alliance, promotion of global free trade and diplomatic respect for allies.\n\nAttempts to rescind Trump\u2019s executive orders or regulations could actually feed into the narrative that the United States is unreliable \u2014 that a deal one president signs could be thrown out by the next.\n\nOn a purely technical level, though, many of Trump\u2019s policies are reversible, especially if they were put in place through regulatory changes, executive orders or other measures less durable than legislation.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, a top contender for the 2020 Democratic nomination, signaled in a speech earlier this year that he would quickly move to reverse many of Trump\u2019s foreign policy edicts, including the travel ban Trump imposed on several mostly Muslim countries. Other Democrats eyeing the Oval Office have said they\u2019d take similar steps.\n\nThere are some ways, however, in which a technical reversal may be too late.\n\nA Democratic Trump successor will likely rejoin the Paris agreement to combat climate change, which Trump quit during his first year in office. Still, critics say the lost time under Trump \u2014 time without U.S. global leadership on the issue \u2014 could have caused irreparable damage to the global ecosystem.\n\nA Democratic president could also take office with a new global nuclear arms race under way.\n\nThat\u2019s what some fear will result from Trump\u2019s decision to quit the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and the possibility he might let another pact, known as New START, lapse. In response, Russia, China and the U.S. have all shown signs that they are already building up their missile arsenals.\n\n\u201cIt takes years, sometimes decades, of diplomacy to secure arms control treaties, and every Trump move makes it that much harder for a new administration to put the guardrails back on,\u201d said Michael Fuchs, a former State Department official who specializes in Asia.\n\nTrump\u2019s supporters, however, see the changes on the arms control front as inevitable. After all, they note, the U.S. quit the INF treaty over accusations that Russia was violating it and over concerns the agreement was limiting America\u2019s ability to counter China\u2019s military rise \u2014 challenges that would have confronted a president from either party.\n\nThe intense focus on Trump\u2019s rhetoric and mannerisms distracts from that somber assessment, some say.\n\n\u201cAmerica is actually evolving toward a post-Cold War consensus of the global security environment, and nobody is noticing it because we\u2019re still wrapped up in Trump,\u201d said James Carafano, a foreign policy analyst with the conservative Heritage Foundation.\n\nTrump also may have given cover to Democrats for series of foreign policy steps that they would have wanted to take but avoided because of the political difficulties.\n\nFor instance, past presidents, including Obama, had promised to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv, but they eventually opted not to, citing security concerns and other issues. Trump actually kept his promise to move the embassy, and several Democratic White House candidates already have indicated they wouldn\u2019t reverse the steps.\n\nThe senior administration official described that decision as one of several in which Trump \u201crecognized a reality\u201d \u2014 that Jerusalem is and has been Israel\u2019s capital.\n\nTrump also shattered another diplomatic taboo by meeting face-to-face with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\nPast presidents had spurned such sessions to avoid granting legitimacy to that country\u2019s brutal regime, but they also made little progress in persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear program.\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t made much progress on the nuclear front, either, but he\u2019s shifted the dynamics of North Korean engagement. A FiveThirtyEight survey of Democratic candidates found at least five who said they\u2019d be willing to meet Kim without preconditions.\n\nTrump also gets plaudits from both sides of the aisle when it comes to his treatment of China.\n\nIn broad terms, the president has challenged Beijing on multiple fronts, including its theft of intellectual property and other questionable economic practices. Even Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, has urged Trump to \u201c hang tough \u201d on China.\n\nEven though many foreign policy veterans disagree with Trump\u2019s extensive use of tariffs against Beijing \u2014 arguing that such measures harm U.S. businesses and consumers \u2014 the tariffs could offer Democrats some leverage to go after China over trade practices they\u2019ve long decried.\n\nThe biggest challenge a successor to Trump might face is rebuilding trust with the rest of the world. Already, some foreign leaders have looked to bolster their ties with Russia and China as the United States, under Trump, has appeared a less reliable global power.\n\n\u201cOther countries have noticed that America can tear things down and blow things up easily, but it has a hard time sealing the deal and getting things done,\u201d said Brian Katulis, a foreign policy analyst with the left-leaning Center for American Progress. \u201cAs a result, many countries are moving to assert their own interests with less regard for America\u2019s views.\u201d\n\nThe politics of rebuilding American trust with the rest of the world are treacherous.\n\nAs Obama reached out to his foreign counterparts in the post-Bush years, Republicans accused him of staging unpatriotic \u201capology tours.\u201d There\u2019s no reason to believe they won\u2019t level the same accusation at a Democratic successor to Trump.\n\nThat is, of course, if one of them can defeat Trump.\n\n\u201cThe next president inherits a singularly high-risk environment, much of it due entirely to the brinkmanship of the current president,\u201d said Constanze Stelzenm\u00fcller, a specialist in European and trans-Atlantic policy with the Brookings Institution. \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting if that turns out to be the same man.\u201d", "description": "Through executive orders, regulatory changes, political maneuvers and sometimes mere neglect, the president has overseen major, possibly permanent, shifts in U.S. foreign policy.", "authors": ["Nahal Toosi"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a7/68/f577233e474c9025067cae71de01/19823-trump-ap-773.jpg"}
