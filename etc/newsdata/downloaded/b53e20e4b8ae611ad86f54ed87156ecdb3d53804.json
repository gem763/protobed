From the few details the senator provided, Feinberg was able to identify Romney\u2019s secret Twitter account as one going by the name Pierre Delecto, handle @qaws9876.\n\nFeinberg first located the conspicuously inconspicuous account with no profile picture among the Twitter followers of Romney\u2019s oldest granddaughter, Allie Romney Critchlow. From there, the then-public account all but bled supporting evidence. The Pierre account joined Twitter in July 2011, one month after Romney announced his run for president. It also follows an array of political reporters, specifically those who have found themselves on the Romney beat over the years.\n\nAmong the assortment of obviously Romney-related accounts are also what Feinberg calls \u201caccounts it\u2019s hard to imagine anyone but Mitt Romney following.\u201d These include such oddities as whoever managed to lock down the @SenRomney Twitter handle but firmly asserts they are \u201cdefinitely not the junior senator from Utah,\u201d a pro-Romney parody account that goes by the handle @AltPresRomney, and various accounts for Romney stans like @NY4Mitt and @MittRomney_2016.\n\nWhen Feinberg\u2019s deep dive first published Sunday evening, it was still just a hunch, albeit a pretty strong one. A mere three hours later, however, after Pierre Delecto frantically toggled between making the account public and private a few times, Romney confirmed the account was his. According to a tweet from Coppins, Romney claimed the account over the phone in true Pierre fashion, telling Coppins only, \u201cC\u2019est moi.\u201d\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at Slate", "description": "After Mitt Romney let it slip that he uses a secret Twitter profile, Slate's Ashley Feinberg managed to successfully identify the account.", "authors": ["Kayla Kibbe"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Mitt_Romney_Secret_Twitter.jpg?fit=1200%2C793", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
