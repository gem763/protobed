The beta for Legends Of Runeterra is already live on PC, with iOS and Android to come, and plenty of streams on Twitch if you want to get a look at it in action.\n\nThe official launch is set for early 2020 but you can pre-register for the beta here at the official website. Although if you don\u2019t already have a League Of Legends account you\u2019ll have to sign up for one first.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there\u2019s autobattler Teamfight Tactics, inspired by the likes of Auto Chess, which started as a mod for Dota 2. Teamfight Tactics will be out on mobile next spring, with pre-registrations already available via Google Play.\n\nRiot also have three secret games currently in development, referred to merely as Project A, Project L, and Project F.\n\nProject A is a tactical shooter that\u2019s intended as a more serious rival to Overwatch, Project L is a fighting game set in the League Of Legends universe, and Project F is a proper secret but there\u2019ve been hints it may be a dungeon crawler in the Diablo vein.\n\nLEAGUE OF LEGENDS FIGHTING GAME FOOTAGE pic.twitter.com/FrQiOhK5Ol \u2014 Panda Global (@PandaGlobal) October 16, 2019\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter", "description": "Riot Games is making a big push onto consoles and mobile, as League Of Legends is reimagined as the all-new Wild Rift.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Legends-of-Runeterra-League-of-Legends-Riot-Games-Card-Game-9f61_1571219317.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
