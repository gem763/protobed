And at 7.15pm in Isleworth, the Trent Rockets were entrusted with first pick in their pod. They plumped for Afghanistan\u2019s Rashid Khan, a brilliant leg-spinner who thus acquired the honour of the inaugural draft pick in the history of the Hundred.\n\nThis was the night that each Hundred side went from being merely a concept to a normal sports team, with a fully-fledged squad and their own player signings to be celebrated and denigrated. This made-for-TV spectacle, that was in keeping with the competition that will arrive next year: a controversial and much-castigated attempt by English cricket to expand its footprint in a cut-throat sporting landscape.\n\nRashid\u2019s selection embodied one of the themes of the night. Spinners - especially overseas ones brimming with mystery - were among the most in-demand players of the draft, unsurprising given their great success in the Twenty20 game. Sunil Narine, Imran Tahir and Rashid\u2019s compatriot Mujeeb Ur Rahman were also picked up for the maximum \u00a3125,000; indeed, four Afghan spinners were signed. Nepal\u2019s leg spinner Sandeep Lamichhane, who has played in a plethora of T20 leagues around the world, was also drafted for \u00a3100,000 by the Oval Invincibles.", "description": "I\u2019m from England cricket,\u201d said Jofra Archer, as he pulled his car into security at Sky studios.", "authors": ["Tim Wigmore", "Simon Briggs"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/20/TELEMMGLPICT000198494503-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PUPXbRlaI4_qh_dM2Z5d688.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
