He added that \"recent events\" had put the airline's \"reputation and brand under pressure\".\n\nThis could simply be a routine retirement - John Slosar had widely been expected to retire soon - but the timing of this announcement is surprising, and comes at a turbulent time for Cathay.\n\nIn the last few weeks, Hong Kong's flagship carrier has seen two of its top bosses resign - under pressure, some have speculated, from Beijing.\n\nMr Slosar had reportedly defended his workers in the initial stages of the protests, saying Cathay wouldn't \"dream of telling its staff what they have to think about something\".\n\nBut he later changed his mind, bowing to the Beijing aviation regulator's demands to suspend workers who supported the protests.\n\nWhile Cathay and Mr Slosar have said the reason for his departure is his retirement, it will no doubt raise questions about how much control China has over the firm.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Cathay Pacific's departing executives Rupert Hogg, John Slosar and Paul Loo\n\nProtests in Hong Kong began about 12 weeks ago over a proposed extradition bill between the territory and mainland China, and have evolved into demands for greater freedoms.\n\nHong Kong is part of China, but its citizens have more autonomy than those on the mainland.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said she would withdraw the controversial extradition bill, but protesters are still calling for full democratic rights.\n\nMr Slosar will be replaced by Patrick Healy, who joined Cathay Pacific's owner Swire Group in 1988.", "description": "News of John Slosar's departure comes weeks after the airline's boss was forced to quit.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/4C7C/production/_108608591_john-slosar2.jpg"}
