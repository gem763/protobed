HBR attributes his sudden disappearance to a change in ranking methodology.\n\nHBR says it ranks CEOs based on financial performance as well as environmental, social, and governance measures (called \"ESG,\" collectively). Whereas ESG comprised 20% of the total CEO score in years past, it became more important in 2019. ESG now comprises 30% of the total CEO score, which proved fatal for Bezos.\n\nAccording to HBR, Amazon has a low ESG score; it cites Sustainanalytics, which attributes the low score to \"risks created by working conditions and employment policies, data security, and antitrust issues.\"\n\nSome CEOs included on the list have stepped down from their roles this year, including Mark Parker from Nike and Anders Runevad from Vestas.\n\nHBR acknowledged that women CEOs are \"underrepresented\" on the ranking, with just four women on the list this year. It says this number is illustrative of how few women are in the c-suite and is not indicative of performance.\n\nCheck out the top 35 below.", "description": "The CEOs of NVIDIA, Salesforce, Adobe, Mastercard, Microsoft, Texas Instruments, Nike, and L'Or\u00e9al all made the top third of the prestigious list.", "authors": ["Rebecca Aydin"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db36a54dee0193c126efd78?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
