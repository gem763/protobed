(There\u2019s a reason why it\u2019s been the reigning style in Hollywood for years.)\n\nAnd, as you\u2019re about to see, you can wear it up or keep it down and tailor the length and layers of the cut to fit your specific hair texture and personal style. Here, 25 easy hairstyles for medium hair.\n\nRELATED: The 32 Best Haircuts for Shoulder-Length Hair\n\nA lob (which is shorthand for long bob) is a solid style for ladies who have naturally thick or wavy strands like Chrissy here. The length of the cut keeps it from poufing out too much, but isn\u2019t so long that it overpowers the rest of your features or weighs things down.\n\nFor straighter strands, an angled, slightly asymmetrical cut (so it\u2019s shorter in the back and gradually lengthens in the front) is an ultra-chic option. Pair it with a crisp, center part and a bit of shine serum on the ends for added polish.\n\nOr rather than curl in the ends like Sandra above, you can flip them out for a more playful look. To replicate J.Lo\u2019s style here (sequined plunging dress not included) comb a small amount of texturizing paste or gel through the lengths and run a flat iron over the ends to lightly flick them out. Total style time: Two minutes, tops.\n\nView photos\n\n4. Straight-Across Bangs\n\nLooking for an easy way to liven up a lob? Try adding some brow-skimming fringe. Just make sure that your stylist cuts into them so the ends are lightly tapered (which will help them lie better on your forehead).\n\nView photos\n\n5. Side-Swept Bangs\n\nOr you can always go for side-swept bangs (and a corresponding deep side part) instead. This is a good alternative for ladies who have a stubborn cowlick or are looking for ways to add volume to limp hair.\n\nRELATED: Every Type of Bangs, Explained\n\nView photos\n\n6. Layered Midi-Cut\n\nWhat\u2019s that saying about when it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it? Jennifer Aniston has been rocking a layered medium-length cut and sunny highlights for over a decade (and has spawned millions of copycats in the process). This cut is universally flattering and timeless. Ask your stylist for long, sweeping layers throughout to keep your strands from falling flat and to frame your face nicely.\n\nView photos\n\n7. Half-Back Style\n\nCan we first take a quick moment to appreciate the radiance that Julia Louis Dreyfus is exuding here? Wow. Ok, now where were we? Ah yes, her hair. At this year\u2019s Emmy awards, JLD went for a half-up style that kept her brunette locks out of her face and put those gorgeous gilded drop earrings on full display. The beauty of a half-up \u2018do is that it\u2019s dressy enough to wear to a party, or, you know, a red carpet without coming off as stuffy (like an updo sometimes can).\n\nRELATED: 9 Half-Up, Half-Down Hairstyles for Any Occasion\n\nView photos\n\n8. Side-Swept Waves\n\nOur longtime fandom of Emma Stone has already been documented at length. (Here, here and also here ICYMI.) And honestly, we don\u2019t see that ending anytime soon because, in addition to being ridiculously charming and talented\u201a our gal always keeps things fun on the red carpet, too. Case in point: Her side-swept crimped waves at this year\u2019s Met Gala that gave us major early Madonna vibes. Tip: This is a surefire way to boost volume in finer strands easily since you\u2019re gathering all of your hair to one side.\n\nRELATED: 5 Styles That Add Volume to Your Fine, Mid-Length Hair\n\nView photos\n\n9. Natural Lob\n\nOf all the things we love about Oprah (and believe us, the list goes on and on), we\u2019re really feeling the natural curls she\u2019s been wearing lately. (Tied only, of course, with her fancy frames and spot on book recommendations.) To rock a crown of coils like momma O, work a conditioning leave-in to soften strands and infuse them with shine as they dry.\n\nRELATED: 7 of the Best Styling Products for Natural Hair\n\nView photos\n\n10. Shaggy Lob\n\nBritish trendsetter, Alexa Chung, may single-handedly be responsible for making the lob the \u201cit\u201d haircut of the last decade. (Seriously\u2014we\u2019ve interviewed dozens of celebrity hairstylists and she always makes the list as being one of the most requested cuts.) We\u2019re guessing this has something to do with her artfully rumpled waves and beautifully blended curtain bangs that gently frame her features, while lending an aura of effortless cool.\n\nRELATED: What Are Curtain Bangs and Why Is Everyone Getting Them?\n\nView photos\n\n11. Sleek Layers\n\nHere\u2019s a timeless cut for all of our ladies out there who are blessed with thick strands. Long layers that start below your shoulders will add movement and keep your ends from looking too heavy. Tip: If you have naturally dark hair like Olivia, adding some lighter pieces around your face can help brighten up your complexion, while also breaking up your hair visually so there\u2019s more dimension throughout.\n\nRELATED: The Best Haircuts for Thick Hair\n\nView photos\n\n12. Blunt Ends\n\nOr if your hair falls on the finer side, keeping the ends all one length can add the illusion of fullness (while adding a loose bend to the lower half of your hair adds some laid-back glam). To replicate the look at home, you\u2019ll need a 1-inch flat iron and good flick of the wrist to get that subtle curve. Finish with a light misting of a shine spray for that expensive-looking sheen that makes it look like you spent a lot more time and money on your hair than you actually did.\n\nView photos\n\n13. Surfer Girl Swoop\n\nIn the middle of growing out bangs or need to quickly camouflage greasy roots before work? Take a cue from Natalie here and just sweep the front pieces of your hair up and over to create a little wave up top. Note: If your hair tends to part to one side anyway, use that to your advantage here (and for extra stubborn strands that refuse to stay put, set things in place with a blast of hot air from your blow dryer for 30 seconds).\n\nView photos\n\n14. Loose Braid\n\nWho says braids don\u2019t work past the age of 50? Certainly not Halle Berry (who is sitting pretty at 53 in case you were about to Google her age like we just did.) And yes, we realize that it\u2019s Halle Berry and she could make a mullet look good, but her loosely-woven French braid would look fetching on anyone, anytime\u2014trust. Just do a low plait and pull out a few pieces in the front to soften the overall look and keep it from looking like you\u2019re about to play at a piano recital.\n\nRELATED: 8 Grown-Up Summer Braids to Try When You\u2019re Tired of Topknots\n\nView photos\n\n15. High Ponytail\n\nAnother easy style to try on mid-length hair? A high ponytail, as modeled by Priyanka after a recent taping of \u201cThe View.\u201d The trick to wearing it like the grown woman and fashion plate that you are (and less like the version you might have worn as a tween during the pop princess era in the early 2000s) is to keep the pony no higher than the back of your head. You should see it peeking from the top, not spouting a fountain of hair.\n\nRELATED: How to Beef Up a Thin Ponytail in 3 Steps\n\nView photos\n\n16. Double-pinned \u2018do\n\nConfession: We have an entire Instagram folder filled with saved images of South Korean model, Irene Kim. (Fans of street style may remember her multi-colored rainbow strands from a few years back.) Since then, she\u2019s committed to just one shade and has continually stepped out with a number of very chic and simple looks\u2014like this all-white ensemble and double-pinned back style she wore to a Chanel show last year. Lucky for us, this style requires zero bleach and is super easy to recreate (which, let\u2019s be honest, is a fancy word for blatantly copy) at home. All you need are two matching barrettes and you\u2019re basically done. It also helps that the whole hair accessory trend has steadily been gaining popularity for the past couple of years.\n\nRELATED: 6 Ways to Wear the Barrettes You Bought Off Instagram\n\nView photos\n\n17. Top-Knotted Twist\n\nRemember when top-knots were all the rage? Everywhere you turned, someone was wearing one\u2014ballet class or not. Then, like most trends, they were overdone and soon phased out. So when Karlie Kloss recently arrived at Rihanna\u2019s annual Diamond Ball donning the highest of top knots, we were quickly reminded of how much we loved the style. It\u2019s fun and playful and gives you an instant face lift (not that you need one, girl). And, as the messy bun\u2019s slightly more polished sister, you really just need to twist your hair in place and pin in the ends to keep the knot more black-tie and less rolled-out-of-bed.\n\nView photos\n\n18. Messy Top-Knot\n\nUnless, of course, you\u2019re going for the messy top-knot\u2014in which case, we say, lean all the way in, sister. Let those pieces fall out casually from the bun. Have it sit slightly askew on top of your head. Go ahead with those baby hairs. The more imperfect, the better.\n\nView photos\n\n19. Baby-Banged Lob\n\nAdmittedly this is not an easy look to pull off, but we think Emma does a pretty (ahem) bang up job. All puns aside, we wanted to call out this particular cut because it\u2019s a rare and refreshing moment when you see a woman\u2014in this case, a young actress in Hollywood\u2014continually push the envelope and evolve their style to fit whatever it is they\u2019re trying to convey at that time. (Reminder to self: Beauty is about self-expression, not trends or perfection.)\n\nOK, now that we\u2019ve stepped off of our soap box, let\u2019s go back to the baby bangs. They\u2019re a great option for ladies with medium-length strands because of the contrast they create between the top and bottom of your hair, which visually opens up your face. The trick to getting these guys just right is to make sure they sit a couple inches below your forehead so you always have the option to curl them slightly under (a la Audrey Tautou in Am\u00e9lie) or sweep them to the side to soften the overall effect.\n\nView photos\n\n20. Glamorous Lob\n\nHow glam is Mandy\u2019s buoyant blowout here? With a subtle side part and tons of volume throughout, the curled ends are just the icing on the cake. Paired with those classy drop earrings and sleek slip dress and she looks every bit the part of a leading lady. Bravo, Mandy. We want moore. (We can\u2019t be helped, y\u2019all.)\n\nRELATED: 9 Perfect Blowouts to Show Your Stylist (So You Don\u2019t Look Like an \u201880s Pageant Queen)\n\nView photos\n\n21. Half-Up Twists\n\nMindy\u2019s teetering on the edge of what we\u2019d consider to be medium-length hair (another inch or so and we think it\u2019s safe to say she\u2019ll have officially crossed over into long hair territory) but for this exact moment in time, we deeply appreciate the sweetness of her half-up style. The subtle twists on either side and loose curls compliment her scalloped collar-and-sweater combo. Filing this under: Date night looks.\n\nView photos\n\n22. Side-Braided Lob\n\nWhy settle for tucking your hair behind one ear, when you could put it all back into a cool side braid like Gina here? Just make sure to lay the braid flat against your head and pin the tail underneath the rest of your hair for an edgier twist.\n\nRELATED: How to Do an Easy, Sleek Side Braid (Best for Curly-Haired Gals)\n\nView photos\n\n23. Double-Dutch Braid\n\nOr you could always take a page from Zooey\u2019s book and try a low and loose double-dutch braid. A quick note on trying this look at home: After braiding each side, use your fingers to gently pull apart the braid (aka \u201cpancaking\u201d) so it\u2019s bigger.\n\nView photos\n\n24. Banana Bun\n\nBe still our hearts. When Gemma Chan stepped out in this light pink Oscar de la Renta number and a casual banana bun (remember those?) earlier this year, we immediately pinned the red carpet images to our board the next day. The ease of the hairstyle makes even a flouncy ball gown appear laid-back somehow.\n\nView photos\n\n25. Slicked Back Style\n\nIt\u2019s hard to imagine Issa Rae feeling insecure (ha) about anything with her glowing gorgeous skin, sky high cheekbones and perfectly-shaped almond eyes. This slicked back \u2018do puts those stunning features of hers on full display and is an easy way to dress up your natural curls. Starting just above your ears, pull the top half of your hair back and smooth on a bit of a styling cream for a look that's just as fitting for a night out as it is for the office.\n\nRELATED: 6 Natural Hairstyles to Try If You\u2019re Tired of the Same Old Same Old", "description": "Medium-length hair\u2014that is, hair that falls somewhere between the tops of your shoulders and just below your collarbones\u2014is a versatile length that works on most people.
