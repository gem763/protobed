On Sunday night, Trump paraphrased Robert Jeffress, a baptist-preacher-turned-Fox-News-pundit, tweeting: \u201cIf the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.\u201d\n\n\u2026.If the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.\u201d Pastor Robert Jeffress, @FoxNews \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2019\n\nThe online reactions to the tweet were far ranging. #CivilWar2 started trending. A Harvard Law professor claimed the tweet itself was grounds for impeachment. A Republican representative disavowed the tweet as \u201cbeyond repugnant.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a right-wing militia group called the Oath Keepers weighed in to agree with Trump.\n\nHere\u2019s the money quote from that thread. This is the truth. This is where we are. We ARE on the verge of a HOT civil war. Like in 1859. That\u2019s where we are. And the Right has ZERO trust or respect for anything the left is doing. We see THEM as illegitimate too.@StewartRhodesOK https://t.co/DjB8TY0vCo \u2014 Oath Keepers (@Oathkeepers) September 30, 2019\n\nThe Oath Keepers describe themselves as an anti-government \u201cpatriot\u201d group whose members pledge to uphold the constitution if a tyrannical president declares martial law. The group believes that day is imminent, and is constantly looking for evidence of a Deep state conspiracy to back their ideology. As Mother Jones reported back in 2010, the group consists largely of soldiers, police, and veterans, like Lee Pray, who runs training drills with fellow Oath Keepers to prepare for when that day inevitably comes:\n\nPray (who asked me to use his middle name rather than his first) and five fellow soldiers based at Fort Drum take this directive very seriously. In the belief that the government is already turning on its citizens, they are recruiting military buddies, stashing weapons, running drills, and outlining a plan of action. For years, they say, police and military have trained side by side in local anti-terrorism exercises around the nation. In September 2008, the Army began training the 3rd Infantry\u2019s 1st Brigade Combat Team to provide humanitarian aid following a domestic disaster or terror attack\u2014and to help with crowd control and civil unrest if need be. (The ACLU has expressed concern about this deployment.) And some of Pray\u2019s comrades were guinea pigs for military-grade sonic weapons, only to see them used by Pittsburgh police against protesters last fall\u2026 In Pray\u2019s estimate, it might not be long (months, perhaps a year) before President Obama finds some pretext\u2014a pandemic, a natural disaster, a terror attack\u2014to impose martial law, ban interstate travel, and begin detaining citizens en masse. One of his fellow Oath Keepers, a former infantryman, advised me to prepare a \u201cbug out\u201d bag with 39 items including gas masks, ammo, and water purification tablets, so that I\u2019d be ready to go \u201cwhen the shit hits the fan.\u201d\n\nWith Trump in the Oval Office, the group\u2019s longstanding antagonism toward the presidency appears to have waned; they\u2019ve pivoted to viewing the president not as the perpetrator of Deep state collusion, but the victim.", "description": "", "authors": ["Laura Thompson"], "top_image": "https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AP_19273692105616_edited.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
