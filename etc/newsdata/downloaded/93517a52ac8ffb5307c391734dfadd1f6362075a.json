Mr. McConnell labeled it wrong-headed in remarks on the Senate floor on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the resolution crafted by House Democrats is insufficient,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much wrong, as it is insufficient.\u201d\n\nMr. McConnell suggested that the resolution put forward by the House last week attempted to \u201cpaper over\u201d and \u201cdance around\u201d the real issues about the troop level in Syria out of a need to provide cover for Democratic presidential primary politics.\n\nMr. McConnell also cautioned his colleagues on both sides of the aisle against turning toward sanctions as a primary means of addressing the Syria crisis, saying the Senate must proceed with caution against using sanctions as its \u201cfirst, last and only resort\u201d for implementing foreign policy.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, said Tuesday that Democrats would still push for the adoption of the House resolution. Mr. Schumer noted that if the resolution was good enough for \u201chard\u201d foreign policy hawks such as Rep. Liz Cheney, Wyoming Republican, and other GOP leaders in the House, then the resolution should satisfy the Senate as well.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep trying to pass the House resolution here in the Senate because it means we could send a bill to the president\u2019s desk that shows him a bipartisan majority of Congress is against his reckless decision in Syria,\u201d Mr. Schumer said. \u201cThis is extremely, extremely troubling, and I am very angry.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
