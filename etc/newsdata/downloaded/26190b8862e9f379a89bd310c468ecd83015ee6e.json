Schumer (D-N.Y.) plans to force a second vote in the chamber this year on a resolution to terminate President Trump\u2019s emergency border declaration. (Melissa Lyttle/Bloomberg)\n\nSenate Democrats plan to force another vote in Congress aimed at overturning President Trump\u2019s border emergency declaration \u2014 potentially triggering a new standoff between the administration and congressional Republicans over the billions of dollars being siphoned from the Pentagon to pay for Trump\u2019s border wall.\n\nThe procedure to disapprove Trump\u2019s border emergency being deployed by Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) is \u201cprivileged,\u201d meaning Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) would be unable to block the vote from happening. The Senate voted to reject the emergency declaration on March 14, with a dozen Republicans joining Democrats to defy Trump\u2019s contention that there is an emergency at the border that justified his end run around Congress to pay for the wall. Trump promptly vetoed the legislation, and Congress lacked the votes to override his decision.\n\n\u201cThis rises to a large and vital constitutional issue: Does our country truly have checks and balances, particularly when we have such an overreaching president?\u201d Schumer said in a floor speech Tuesday. \u201cWe all must consider the dangerous precedent that would set if presidents may declare national emergencies every time their initiatives fail in Congress. It is outrageous.\u201d\n\nThe timing of the vote is unclear, but it would probably occur in the coming weeks \u2014 the law invoked by Trump to justify his border emergency allows one every six months. Democrats are hoping the vote will be politically uncomfortable for Republicans facing potentially tough reelection battles in states that will lose money for military construction projects to pay for sections of the wall. The resolution needs only a simple majority to pass in the Senate.\n\nTrump issued his declaration in February after Congress denied him the $5.7 billion he demanded to construct new barriers at the U.S.-Mexico border. The administration used the declaration to unlock about $3.6 billion that had been set aside for military construction projects to pay for one of Trump\u2019s signature campaign promises, although the emergency order is being challenged in the courts.\n\nThe Pentagon last week made public a list of 127 military projects, both domestic and overseas, that would lose money. There are 11 border projects that are gaining the funds.\n\n[Projects defunded for Trump\u2019s border wall include military buildings with \u2018life safety violations\u2019 and hazmat concerns]\n\nThe list of projects include Hurricane Maria recovery projects at military installations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and projects across Europe designed to help U.S. allies fend off Russian aggression. In all, projects in 23 states, three U.S. territories and 20 countries are affected.\n\nThe Trump administration argues that in effect, the projects are merely delayed until Congress approves new money for them.\n\nBut Democrats have promised not to \u201cbackfill\u201d the funding. Sen. Brian Schatz (Hawaii), the ranking Democrat on the panel that oversees money for military construction projects, stressed again Tuesday there is \u201czero chance\u201d that Congress will greenlight fresh funding for them.\n\n\u201cThe Constitution provides that we do the appropriating,\u201d Schatz said. \u201cI will not \u2014 and I do not believe other Democrats would \u2014 vote to appropriate money to the same project twice.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have repeatedly gone on the offensive against GOP senators up for reelection who have backed Trump on his border emergency yet are losing millions in federal funding for key military projects in their home states.\n\nSen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) \u2014 who initially announced his opposition to Trump\u2019s emergency declaration only to reverse himself just before the vote to overturn it \u2014 stands to lose about $80 million in military projects in North Carolina. One of the projects \u2014 $32.9 million for an elementary school at Fort Bragg \u2014 had already been canceled, according to the Pentagon.\n\nTillis said he had spoken with military officials who said the impact would be minimal. He dismissed attacks from Democrats in North Carolina, noting that he\u2019s secured other funding victories for Camp Lejeune and Fort Bragg.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a good story to tell,\u201d he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) said earlier this year that she had secured a promise from then-acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan that no military projects in Arizona would lose money for barrier construction.\n\nBut $30 million for the Fort Huachuca Ground Transport Equipment Building in Sierra Vista is being diverted for the border; McSally\u2019s office said that project had already been delayed because of \u201cunforeseen environmental issues at the construction site.\u201d\n\nBoth Tillis and McSally face potentially tough election contests next November. But both stressed that they would still vote to support the border emergency.\n\n\u201cI think Chuck Schumer is talking out of both sides of his mouth,\u201d Tillis said. \u201cOn the one hand, he says it\u2019s a slap to the military; on the other hand, he says it\u2019s not gonna backfill it? We\u2019ll have that discussion once we get to the appropriations process.\u201d", "description": "Minority Leader Charles E.
