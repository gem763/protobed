It bred in me this love of play, pick-up sport and community,\" Whitfield told CBC Sports on Wednesday before he was inducted into the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame along with six others and two teams at the CBC's Glenn Gould Studio in Toronto.\n\nWhile his friends went on to become bankers, musicians and tree surveyors, Whitfield made history in his Summer Games debut in Sydney, where he unexpectedly became the first-ever Olympic champion in men's triathlon in 2000.\n\nWhitfield, who was 25 at the time, sat in 25th place after the 1,500-metre swim and 40-kilometre bike race. He unleashed a devastating kick in the 10K and passed his friend Stephan Vuckovic of Germany with about 200 metres left and crossed the finish line first in 30 minutes 52 seconds.\n\n\"I just had this mission and internal belief,\" Whitfield, now 44, said. \"When I [took the lead] I thought, 'Here I am, leading at the Olympic Games.' I had a real love for doing it, enjoyed being there and wasn't consumed with all the pressure.\n\n14 World Cup victories\n\n\"A wide-eyed kid with a big dream who loved playing road hockey around a pothole. I just had a naive and joyful opportunity. My folks always said to express your gifts. [My wife] Jennie and I give the same thoughts to our daughters [Pippa and Evelyn] who are going through their own journey of sport, competition, pressure and the anxiety and anxiousness that comes with it.\"\n\nThe 2008 Olympic silver medallist told a story of when he was a youngster and beat the older brother of one of his friends on a race around the block riding a banana-seat bike. His friends wondered if Whitfield had cheated and taken a shortcut through an alleyway but he said it was legit.\n\nWATCH | Behind the scenes at the Olympic Hall of Fame induction:\n\nCBC Sports takes you behind the scenes, bringing you exclusive coverage and interviews with the 2019 inductees of the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame. 1:58\n\n\"I remember thinking I was good at it and that translates, years later, to be that seed in a young kid's head that maybe I'm good at this, and those people in that legacy end up here today [in the Hall of Fame],\" said Whitfield, the 2002 and 2009 Commonwealth Games champion who also had 14 World Cup victories and eight top-10 finishes at the world championships before retiring at 38 in 2013.\n\nWhitfield, who now lives in Victoria, remembers watching the Olympics with his parents as a child and among his early recollections was Canada's Dave Steen winning a bronze medal in decathlon at the 1988 Games in Seoul, South Korea.\n\n\"I wanted to hear the [Canadian] anthem and see the flag flying,\" he said. \"My parents never asked how [my sister and I] did in sports. They just asked, 'Did you give a great effort today?' It was a key in my development that I've passed on to my daughters.\"\n\nAt the beginning of his acceptance speech, Whitfield deviated from sports, calling on Canadian politicians to expand the Canadian Trans Mountain pipeline, a controversial project in Alberta and British Columbia.\n\n\"Please work together on behalf of Canadians towards ensuring effective and affordable use of our micro resource endowments,\" Whitfield said. \"Let this effort be guided and governed by local communities, Indigenous peoples with oversight from senior levels of government.\"\n\nWATCH | Simon Whitfield calls for Trans Mountain pipeline expansion:\n\nDuring his acceptance speech at the Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame induction, Olympic champion triathlete Simon Whitfield implored Canadian politicians to expand the Canadian Trans Mountain pipeline. 3:00\n\nThe 2019 class also includes:\n\nAlexandre Despatie (Diving: 2-time Olympic silver medallist)\n\n(Diving: 2-time Olympic silver medallist) Christine Girard (Weightlifting: 2012 Olympic gold medallist, 2008 Olympic bronze medallist)\n\n(Weightlifting: 2012 Olympic gold medallist, 2008 Olympic bronze medallist) \u00c9milie Heymans (Diving: First Canadian summer Olympian to win medals at four consecutive Olympics)\n\n(Diving: First Canadian summer Olympian to win medals at four consecutive Olympics) Women's 2010 Olympic hockey gold medallists\n\nWomen's 2012 Olympic soccer bronze medallists\n\nHiroshi Nakamura (Judo coach)\n\n(Judo coach) Jack Poole (Builder: Largely responsible for landing 2010 Vancouver Olympics)\n\n(Builder: Largely responsible for landing 2010 Vancouver Olympics) Randy Starkman (Builder: Late Toronto Star writer)\n\nThe individual inductees will be commemorated with murals painted in their honour that will appear in their respective local communities across Canada.\n\nAlex Despatie\n\nDespatie of Laval, Que., won a silver medal in 3-metre springboard at the 2004 Olympics in Athens and earned silver four years later in Beijing after fracturing his foot just four months earlier.\n\nThe four-time Olympian added eight world championship medals before retiring in 2013.\n\n\"It is a privilege to be part of this class,\" the 34-year-old told the family and friends of his fellow inductees. \"You're all amazing people.\n\n\"\"I have had the privilege to do what I loved the most for 22 years and had the honour of competing and representing my country on the biggest stage in sports.

The translation is 'always try to have the best day possible and the combination of lifetime experiences will define your life,\" Nakamura said. \"If you truly live this way, you will feel your life has value and fulfillment.\"\n\nJack Poole\n\nPoole was instrumental in bringing the Olympics to Vancouver in 2010.
