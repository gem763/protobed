Altria agreed to pay close to $13 billion for a 35% stake in Juul in December 2018.\n\nDarsana is among a group of hedge funds including Tiger Global Management and Coatue Management that reaped huge gains from the rapid rise of Juul's valuation after Altria's investment.\n\nJuul fueled more than half of Darsana's 11.9% return last year, the WSJ reported citing people familiar with the matter. Despite the writedown, Darsana is still up overall on its investment in Juul thanks to a $150-a-share dividend paid out as part of the Altria deal, the report found.\n\nThe company has experienced a tumultuous few months as federal regulators have moved to crack down on e-cigarette products amid a rising number of vaping-related illnesses and deaths. Juul CEO Kevin Burnes also stepped down last week and the company announced it planned to suspend all advertising in the US.\n\nThe Trump administration is currently exploring a ban on flavored vaping products, which account for almost 80% of Juul's US sales, according to the WSJ.\n\nRead more: As WeWork bleeds cash, Bernstein lays out 4 ways the struggling company can stay afloat", "description": "Hedge fund Darsana Capital Partners has reportedly cut the valuation of e-cigarette maker Juul Labs by more than a third.\u00a0 The firm now values Juul a...", "authors": ["Finanzen.Net Gmbh"], "top_image": "https://images.markets.businessinsider.com/image/5be5d5a6110d4c1f5c703c64-2400/juul.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
