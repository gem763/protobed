YouTube/Singapore Airlines\n\nSingapore Airlines\u2019 (SIA) first non-stop flight to Seattle took off from Changi Airport on Tuesday (September 3) morning.\n\nIn a statement, SIA said that SQ28 will be met with a water cannon salute when it lands on the tarmac of the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all.\n\nTo mark the airline\u2019s fourth US city served on a non-stop route (the others are Los Angeles, Newark and San Francisco), SIA also unveiled a special music track dedicated to the Seattle service.\n\nCreated by up-and-coming Seattle musician and beatsmith Chong the Nomad, the track titled \u201cNon-Stop\u201d is a remix of sounds collected from the Airbus A350-900, which is the aircraft SIA will use for its non-stop flights to the Emerald City three times a week.\n\nSeattle, SIA noted, has a rich music scene and is also the birthplace of many major musical influences such as Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Jimi Hendrix.\n\nSome of the sounds Chong collected on the flight include a mid-flight announcement by a Singapore Girl (a female flight attendant), the whirring of a cockpit control, a seatbelt being fastened, the bubbling of champagne being poured in a glass, and more.\n\nChong the Nomad, an Asian American artist based in Seattle, then remixed the sounds in her signature pop-electronic style for SIA\u2019s aptly named \u201cSeattle Sounds Even Better Now\u201d campaign.\n\nThe result was a genius, refreshing and upbeat combination of common sounds heard on an airplane.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, she announced the collaboration on an Instagram post, revealing that she had flown to Singapore about a month prior to the song\u2019s release.\n\n\u201cI had the adventure of a lifetime. Can\u2019t believe music took me all the way across the world,\u201d Chong, whose real name is Alda Agustiano, wrote.\n\nCalling Singapore a \u201cbeautiful country\u201d, she added that she \u201chad the adventure of a lifetime\u201d.\n\nThe frequency of SIA\u2019s non-stop Seattle service will increase from three to four times weekly in October. This will bring the total number of weekly non-stop Singapore-US services to 31, SIA said.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - The new music track includes a recording of a mid-flight announcement by a Singapore Girl..
