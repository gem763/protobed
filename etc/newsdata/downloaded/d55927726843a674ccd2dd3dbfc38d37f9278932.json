I have two years left on my deal and there's no better place to play than Barcelona.\n\nRakitic has fallen out of favour with Ernesto Valverde, who has preferred Frenkie de Jong\n\n'It's the best club in the world, but I need to play and not just enjoy walks around the city and the beach.'\n\nRakitic, who joined Barca from Sevilla in 2014, added that he has spoken to president Josep Bartomeu and captain Lionel Messi about his prospects.\n\n'I spoke with people at the club everyone knew I had other options.
