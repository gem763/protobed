The video Trump tweeted superimposed on that picture a photo from 2014 of Joe and Hunter Biden on a golf course with Hunter Biden's business associate.\n\nWhile the tweet remained up as of Thursday late morning, the video was removed. In its place is a message from Twitter reading: \"This media has been disabled in response to a report by the copyright owner.\"\n\nThe man labeled as \"UKRAINE GAS EXEC\" in the meme video is Devon Archer, an American businessman and longtime colleague of the Bidens. Hunter Biden and Archer co-founded the private equity firm Rosemont Seneca Partners in 2009 before they served together on the board of Burisma Holdings in 2014.\n\nLOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH! pic.twitter.com/QQYTqG4KTt \u2014 Donald J.

The meme revolves around people replacing Kroeger's photograph with a photo or video of their choosing inside the frame. It is not the meme, but the music, that appears to have violated Twitter's copyright policy.\n\nIt is not the first time the president has posted content violating Twitter's copyright rules. Earlier this year in April, Trump tweeted a campaign advertisement put to music from the Batman film \"The Dark Knight Rises.\" It was removed following a take-down notice from copyright holder Warner Bros.\n\nSaul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images, FILE\n\nA Twitter spokeswoman said Thursday morning that the company responded \"to valid copyright complaints sent to us by a copyright owner or their authorized representatives.\"\n\nNickelback representatives have not responded to ABC News' messages seeking comment.", "description": "Within 12 hours of Trump tweeting a digitally altered meme from a 2005 Nickelback music video, Twitter disabled the content from playing due to a copyright complaint.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/zelensky-trump-gty-ps-191003_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
