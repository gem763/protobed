If the IRS aimed to reclaim all the avoided taxes, it would be seeking a figure close to the largest tax repayment in US history\u2014behind GlaxoSmithKline\u2019s $3.4 billion settlement with the IRS in 2006.\n\nChinese tax authorities may also have questions about the arrangement, a Chinese tax law expert said.\n\nWalmart\u2019s arrangement, internally named \u201cProject Flex,\u201d revolved around the company\u2019s payments to its Chinese subsidiary in Shenzhen, from which it sources many of the billions of dollars of Chinese goods it imports every year, the former executive wrote in a presentation explaining it. To avoid paying tax in either the US or China, Walmart created a \u201ctax nowhere\u201d entity that neither country would claim jurisdiction over, according to the former executive.\n\n\u201cThe goal of Project Flex was to create something from nothing, that China would say is nothing, but which the US tax rules would be required to embrace,\u201d the former executive wrote in the presentation. Tax law experts confirmed the executive\u2019s thesis that the structure does not exist in Chinese law and said the IRS would have grounds to challenge Walmart.\n\nWalmart rejected that assessment. \u201cThese issues were raised years ago, independently and thoroughly investigated at the time and the tax year covering the matter has been closed by the IRS,\u201d a company spokesman said in an emailed statement. \u201cThe IRS also has an on-site office at Walmart full-time, year-round. Through our participation in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process [CAP] program, we have open and transparent discussions, proactively share information about corporate structures as they occur, including this matter, and provide other materials the IRS requests.\u201d Walmart has been in the voluntary CAP program since 2005.\n\nThe Walmart spokesman declined to comment on when the independent investigation took place and which law firm conducted it, whether the IRS was aware of the structure\u2019s legal viability in China, and which tax year the IRS has closed. Project Flex started in 2014, and would become unnecessary by 2017 under US tax law changes. Walmart avoided around $2 billion in tax through a \u201cdeemed dividend,\u201d obtained in 2014, and then dodged around $200 million per year thereafter, the former executive argued. If the IRS closed the 2014 tax year for Walmart, it\u2019s possible it wouldn\u2019t be able to go after the $2 billion. (EY, the accounting firm that helped Walmart devise the arrangement according to the former executive\u2019s documents, declined to comment for this story.)\n\nThe documents were shown to Quartz by a third party who had been sent the documents by the former Walmart executive. The former executive, who declined to comment on this story, citing a confidentiality agreement with Walmart, wrote the documents with a view to sending them to the IRS, which gives financial rewards to whistleblowers. It\u2019s unclear, however, if they were ever actually sent to the agency.\n\nThe former executive\u2019s files include the legal contract for the \u201ctax nowhere\u201d entity\u2014an ostensibly Chinese \u201cjoint venture\u201d\u2014and a lengthy slide deck and detailed legal memo explaining why the IRS has a claim to the money, both written by the former executive. A person familiar with the arrangement confirmed that the structure was set up as described in the documents. Much of the structure can also be seen in internal Walmart files obtained in the Paradise Papers leak, which the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists shared with Quartz.\n\nSome of the machinations are \u201cegregious,\u201d said Wei Cui, an expert in American and Chinese tax law and professor at the University of British Columbia, who reviewed the files for Quartz. \u201cThe idea is that they create an entity that did nothing, completely a piece of paper,\u201d he said. \u201c[The] arrangement is aggressive\u2014there\u2019s no question about that.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nIf the IRS took Walmart to court, it would have a good shot at recovering at least some of the $2.6 billion, tax experts said. \u201cI think there is a good argument based on the facts presented by the whistleblower that the structure actually does not work [as a means of avoiding US tax],\u201d said Omri Marian, a tax-law professor at the University of California, Irvine. He added that he couldn\u2019t be sure of the strength of any legal challenge, since the files don\u2019t include the legal opinion commissioned by Walmart, which, the former executive\u2019s memo says, argued the structure would hold up in court.\n\nWhile the structure might not stand up as a tax-avoidance mechanism, there\u2019s no allegation that Walmart broke US law, since tax avoidance on its own is not illegal. An IRS spokesperson declined to comment for this story, citing a federal law that prohibits the agency from discussing specific taxpayers.\n\nWalmart, with annual revenue hitting $501 billion in 2018, has topped the Fortune Global 500 every year since 2014. Its owners, the Waltons, reportedly the world\u2019s richest family, are said to add $100 million per day to their $191 billion fortune. A 2015 report by the Americans for Tax Fairness campaign group alleged that Walmart had placed assets worth at least $76 billion in tax havens where it had no retail stores\u2014a figure equal to 37% of the company\u2019s total assets at the time. (Walmart called the group\u2019s findings \u201cincomplete and erroneous.\u201d)\n\n\u201cOur old report showed there was an octopus. Its foreign subsidiaries\u2014and the secretive nature of these foreign subsidiaries\u2014was remarkable and it appeared to be a substantial tax dodge,\u201d said Frank Clemente, Americans for Tax Fairness\u2019s executive director and co-author of the 2015 report. Project Flex \u201cseems to me to be some smoking-gun evidence of the extent to which Walmart engaged in subterfuge and tax dodging.\u201d\n\nWalmart is far from alone in using offshore mechanisms to avoid tax. In total, US multinationals held around $1 trillion offshore by the end of 2017, the Federal Reserve estimated, with giants such as Apple and Microsoft brazenly, and legally, booking profits in tax havens like Ireland.\n\nHow Project Flex worked\n\nWalmart paid its Shenzhen subsidiary via a commission on the imported goods, sending the commission from the US parent company to a subsidiary in Hong Kong, which then sent it on to another subsidiary in Shenzhen to pay for Walmart\u2019s 1,000-employee operation there, according to the documents.\n\nA slide from the former executives files shows the eight subsidiaries through which the Hong Kong structure worked More\n\nA slide from the former Walmart executive\u2019s files shows the structure through which the Hong Kong company was held.\n\nA second former Walmart employee, with direct knowledge of its taxes, confirmed that Walmart held the Hong Kong subsidiary via this structure, which can also be seen in an internal company slide from 2009, found in the Paradise Papers.\n\nWalmart paid a 1.4% commission on the pre-shipping cost of the goods to the Shenzhen entity, but declared to US authorities that it was paying an amount worth 5% to a foreign subsidiary, according to the former executive\u2019s account. It didn\u2019t have to pay US tax on that money, since it was just presumed to be going to another part of the same company. Walmart then kept the remaining 3.6% in the Hong Kong subsidiary, the former executive\u2019s files say. This amounted to stashing around $600 million per year in the Hong Kong subsidiary, which had \u201cno employees or activities,\u201d the former executive wrote.\n\nThe former Walmart tax employee summarized the goal for Quartz: \u201cThey wanted to park some profits in places where it wasn\u2019t subject to tax\u2014neither in China, nor in the US.\u201d\n\nAt the time, that was likely an acceptable tax-avoidance arrangement under US law, according to the documents. The Hong Kong arrangement had been in place since 2001, according to the former executive\u2019s memo. Filings with Hong Kong\u2019s corporate registry show the entity, WMGS Co. Ltd, was created that year.\n\nWhile sitting in Hong Kong, the money could amass millions of dollars in interest without being taxed. Many US multinationals allow money to accrue interest offshore and wait until a new presidential administration grants a tax holiday, allowing the companies to repatriate it at discounted rates. At least some of the money was used to make loans to finance other Walmart entities, the person familiar with the arrangement said.\n\nTo avoid paying tax in Hong Kong, Walmart wasn\u2019t allowed to do substantive business there, creating headaches even if it wanted to just hold meetings, the former Walmart tax employee said. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t want to go to the mainland\u2014they wanted to go to Hong Kong, it\u2019s easier to fly into,\u201d the person said. \u201cUnder the old structure, that would be discouraged because you\u2019d be breaching a deal [with the Hong Kong authorities].\u201d\n\nIn November 2014, however, Walmart changed the structure of the arrangement. It went through a highly complex 11-step process to create a \u201cjoint venture\u201d between Walmart\u2019s British Virgin Islands and Dutch subsidiaries, the former executive wrote. Under Project Flex, the \u201cjoint venture\u201d replaced the Hong Kong subsidiary. The former executive\u2019s documents include a copy of the \u201cjoint venture\u201d agreement signed by Walmart\u2019s then-global head of tax and a vice president in its Global Treasury department, who is also listed as a director of the Hong Kong subsidiary on the company\u2019s public filings.\n\nThe opening of the \"fictitious\" \"joint venture\" agreement between two Walmart subsidiaries More\n\nThe ostensibly Chinese \u201cjoint venture\u201d agreement between two Walmart subsidiaries.\n\nThis joint venture claimed to be Chinese. Its legal agreement includes just one line saying it \u201cshall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of China.\u201d Since the \u201cjoint venture\u201d was ostensibly based in China, Walmart was then able to claim a US tax credit on that annual $600 million in revenue because US authorities would assume it was still being taxed on that money in China, the former executive wrote. It also didn\u2019t pay tax in China on the \u201cjoint venture,\u201d according to the former executive\u2019s files.\n\nHowever, the type of joint venture created under Project Flex doesn\u2019t exist as a valid entity in Chinese law, according to two Chinese tax law experts and the former executive. \u201cThis is a fictitious joint venture,\u201d said Jinyan Li, a professor at York University in Toronto and expert on Chinese tax law. \u201cIt makes me feel so mad when I see people taking these things seriously for tax purposes. This is really not a corporation, not any entity recognized by Chinese law.\u201d Walmart said it had the structure investigated by an independent law firm.\n\nFurther, the former executive noted in the presentation, by marrying the BVI entity with the Dutch entity, Walmart was creating a \u201cjoint venture\u201d with itself. The BVI entity and its parent company, Wal-Mart Far East Holdings, already owned the Dutch entity, the former executive said. Dutch public filings confirm that structure, and show the firm was created the day before the \u201cjoint venture\u201d agreement was signed. \u201cWhat\u2019s a good reason for someone to do something not by itself but with another entity created by itself? It\u2019s very hard to say that there\u2019s any purpose for that [aside from tax avoidance],\u201d said Cui. \u201cGiven what I\u2019ve seen, I can\u2019t think of any other reasons.\u201d\n\nThe person familiar with the arrangement said the \u201cjoint venture\u201d was created for \u201cbusiness reasons.\u201d \u201cThe old structure was very restrictive on what activities they could perform in Hong Kong,\u201d the person said, adding that the company wanted to hire more talent in Hong Kong and attend trade shows and engage in other business activity there. \u201cIt didn\u2019t necessarily require a joint venture, but the JV was the most efficient way to enable that without a bunch of ripple effects.\u201d The person said Walmart considered the argument described by Cui and Li, and consulted with Chinese legal counsel when setting up the structure.\n\nPotential IRS issues\n\nThe US tax exemption that would have allowed Walmart to dodge payments on the money stashed in the JV exists because US authorities expect that when a company transfers money between two of its entities in a foreign country, that cash will have been taxed in that country. However, since the \u201cjoint venture\u201d didn\u2019t really exist under Chinese law and Chinese authorities were likely not even aware of it, the former executive contended that Walmart owes around $200 million per year in US tax on the $600 million annually sent to the allegedly fictitious entity.\n\nThe person familiar with Project Flex said that Walmart \u201cwent through some pretty significant negotiations and discussions with the IRS\u201d to support the 5% commission figure, and that it disclosed the full structure to the agency.\n\nIf Project Flex continued until 2017, when changes to US tax law would have dented some of its avoidance strategies, the IRS would have grounds to sue Walmart for around $600 million based on the \u201cjoint venture,\u201d based on the calculations in the former executive\u2019s presentation. The independent US tax experts told Quartz they agreed. There could be a separate argument to sue for an extra $2 billion, the former executive argued.\n\nAllowing Walmart to use the \u201cjoint venture\u201d structure would make one element of the US tax code \u201cmeaningless,\u201d the former executive argued in the presentation. \u201cCompanies will be able to create \u2018same country\u2019 income anywhere in the world without the corresponding burden of having to form a local country entity that would be subject to local country taxes.\u201d\n\nBased on the former executive\u2019s presentation, the IRS would have a good case, Marian argued, adding that tax courts can impose extra penalties for what is deemed to be aggressive avoidance, as well as demand repayment of $600 million plus interest. Extra penalties can be as high as 40% of the initial amount of tax avoided.\n\nCui, who agreed the IRS would have a decent case, noted the agency would also take on a \u201clitigation risk\u201d by bringing it to court. \u201cThere\u2019s not a lot of law in this area\u2014it would be hard to predict how a judge would rule on this very technical issue,\u201d he said, adding he is \u201csympathetic\u201d to the argument that a decision in favor of Walmart would make it easy for other firms to abuse the tax exemption Walmart used.\n\nCui said the Chinese government also could\u2014and \u201cshould\u201d\u2014have taxed Walmart on the money. However, Beijing likely tolerates the avoidance because it doesn\u2019t want to lose business from big multinationals, he said. \u201cIf China decides to crack down on Walmart, which is probably the last thing it wants to do now, it would have to do that to a lot of others,\u201d he said. \u201cWalmart\u2019s Shenzhen operation is a big deal, so people are happy enough.\u201d\n\nLi disagrees, arguing that upon learning about the scheme, Chinese tax authorities \u201cwould be interested\u2014they will probably give Walmart\u2019s representative in China a call.\u201d The crux of the matter is whether Walmart has previously told China 1.4% is the market rate for a commission for such services\u2014and whether it has the data to persuade authorities that is the case, she says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a magic show, and the intended audience is the IRS,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Chinese may look at it and say, \u2018Hey, this looks interesting. Is our interest hurt?\u2019 They may look and say, \u2018We\u2019re still happy with 1.4%.\u2019 They may not do anything; they may be offended that China is used as a prompt for this show put on for the IRS, but look at their interests and say, \u2018We remain happy with 1.4%.\u2019\u201d\n\nBeyond $200 million in tax avoided per year, the company essentially paid itself a dividend of around $6 billion by shifting the scheme from the Hong Kong shell company to the \u201cjoint venture,\u201d the former executive argues in the presentation, saying EY and Walmart had valued the arrangement at around that sum. That \u201cdeemed dividend\u201d should incur $2 billion more in taxes, the executive argued. Marian said he agrees that the transaction, as described by the former executive, could be judged a \u201cdeemed dividend\u201d but can\u2019t be certain it would succeed in court without analyzing the counter-argument written by Walmart\u2019s lawyers. Cui said it wouldn\u2019t be a \u201cslam dunk\u201d in court. If the IRS signed off on the 2014 tax year, Walmart is probably safe from any legal challenge over the $2 billion, since the \u201cdeemed dividend\u201d occurred when the structure changed in 2014.\n\nThe independent auditor and tax consultant\n\nEY has been Walmart\u2019s auditor since 1969, earning $24.5 million for its services in fiscal year 2018 alone. In 2014, while EY\u2019s auditors independently analyzed Walmart\u2019s accounts, its tax consultants advised it on how to structure Project Flex, the former executive alleged, writing that they were paid \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars\u201d for the plan. Major accounting firms are facing a series of crises around the world, many of which are related to perceived conflicts of interest.\n\nIn 2014, a US Senate investigation into manufacturing firm Caterpillar\u2019s taxes said that EY\u2019s rival PwC raised \u201csignificant conflict of interest concerns\u201d by acting as both an auditor and tax consultant to the firm\u2014just as EY did for Walmart. It recommended that the government\u2019s audit regulator, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, ban accountancy firms from fulfilling both roles for one company. The board reportedly opened an investigation into whether the case represented a conflict for PwC. In the UK, where accountancy firms are trying to avoid auditing scandal-plagued retailer Sports Direct, both EY and Deloitte have insisted they are conflicted out, since they have done non-audit work for the company or an entity it has bought.\n\nEY\u2019s tenure as Walmart\u2019s auditor last came under scrutiny in 2015, when a Walmart shareholder accused EY of knowing Walmart may have paid bribes in Mexico a long time before the accountancy disclosed the matter to authorities. Walmart agreed to pay a $282 million settlement over the case earlier this year. At the time, EY declined to comment on matters involving its clients.\n\nSign up for the Quartz Daily Brief, our free daily newsletter with the world\u2019s most important and interesting news.\n\nMore stories from Quartz:", "description": "Experts say Walmart could be liable to pay hundreds of millions, based on a former executive's presentation reviewed by Quartz\u2014if the IRS ever took it to court.", "authors": ["Max De Haldevang"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Px7kjz_lkpTQmX1VpSoMLg--~B/aD01NzU7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/quartz.com/aced46496778f820554e37915b2aac73", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
