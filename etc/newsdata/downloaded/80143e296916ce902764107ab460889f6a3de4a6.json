The list was discovered within the unreleased phone\u2019s Motion Sense app, and includes nine pieces of software in total; Amazon Music, Deezer, Google Play Music, iHeartRadio, Pandora, Spotify, Spotify Stations, YouTube Music, and YouTube.\n\nWhile a separate leak suggested that the phone\u2019s gesture controls will be able to check the phone\u2019s lock screen and silence calls, this list implies that the phone\u2019s app-specific gestures could be focused mainly on music playback. Both Google\u2019s original announcement of the feature, as well as a leaked promo video, showed gestures being used to skip forwards and backwards through tracks.\n\nThe functionality could be available in 38 countries\n\nAlong with the list of apps, 9to5Google also reports that Google expects gesture controls to be available in 38 countries. Although the list includes most major territories including the US, UK, Canada, France, and Germany, there are a couple of odd omissions, namely Japan, Mexico, India, Australia and New Zealand. Motion Sense relies on Google\u2019s Project Soli tech, which the company needs permission to use in each country because of its reliance on radar technology.\n\n9to5Google notes that both the list of apps and list of countries may not be final since they\u2019ve come from a device running pre-release software. It also speculates that the list of apps could just be the ones that Google officially sanctions, while allowing others to also add their own support for the hardware\u2019s features. We won\u2019t know for sure until the phone is officially released, which amazingly (given the amount of leaks) is still over a month away.", "description": "A list of the apps that will support the Google Pixel 4\u2019s \"Motion Sense\" gesture controls has been discovered in the phone\u2019s pre-release software.
