But its seven-day forecast shows a likelihood of another planned blackout across a much larger area starting Saturday, when even heavier winds are expected to move through.\n\n\"There could be another round of safety shut-offs this weekend into early next week. The timing isn't clear yet,\" said Johnson.\n\nPG&E meteorologist Scott Strenfel said of the weekend weather: \"This could be the strongest wind event of the season, unfortunately.\"\n\nStrenfel called the current wind event a \"California-wide phenomenon.\" Conditions should begin easing in the northern part of the state around midday Thursday, when crews will begin inspecting lines to make sure they're safe to re-energize.\n\nThat's when Santa Ana winds are expected to begin whipping up in the south. Southern California Edison said it could cut power Thursday to more than 308,000 customers in seven counties, and San Diego Gas & Electric was warning of power shutoffs to about 24,000 customers.\n\nWith winds forecast to top 60 mph (97 kph), utilities worried branches and debris could be thrown into power lines or topple them, sparking wildfires.\n\nTwo weeks ago, a PG&E blackout affected nearly 2 million people from Oct 9-12, prompting feelings of frustration and resignation among residents and business owners who are finding the new routine both inconvenient and expensive.\n\nThe small city of Calistoga, in the Napa Valley, known for its hot springs and wineries, was among those hit by Wednesday's outage.\n\n\"It's very frustrating,\" said Michael Dunsford, owner of the 18-room Calistoga Inn, which has rented two powerful generators for the month at a cost of $5,000. Like many, he feels the outages need to be better managed, better targeted and less expansive.\n\n\"Right now, we have no wind. Zero. I don't even see a single leaf blowing. Did they really have to cut the power right now?\" he said, shortly after the lights went out Wednesday afternoon and he revved up the generators. \"When the wind picks up to 40 mph maybe that's a good time to close the power.\"\n\n\"They're not appreciating enough the impact this has on everybody,\" he said about PG&E.\n\nSome of the frustration was being taken out on PG&E employees, said the company's CEO.\n\nJohnson said Wednesday that a PG&E employee was the target of what appeared to be a deliberate attack in Glenn County. He said a projectile that may have come from a pellet gun hit the employee's front window.\n\n\"There is no justification for this sort of violence,\" Johnson said. \"Wherever you see crews they are there to help you.\"\n\nSonoma County Supervisor James Gore said PG&E was better this time about getting information to people who would be affected, but he was still astonished by the need to resort to largescale blackouts.\n\n\"I am a big believer in shutdowns to prevent fires. But the thing that erodes public trust is when it doesn't make sense,\" he said. \"You say, 'God, I know if we can put a man on the moon ... we can manage a (power) grid.'\"\n\nStory continues", "description": "Lights went out across large portions of Northern California on Wednesday as the state's largest utility began its second massive blackout in two weeks and hinted that more outages could come this weekend due to the return of dangerous fire weather.
