A California sixth-grader recorded these words while taking notes during the teacher\u2019s lesson. Along with foregoing any plans of having a family, the class was told to \u201ceat less or no meat\u201d and \u201cavoid air travel\u201d because \u2014 as this teacher is so certain \u2014 climate change has caused the extinction of animals, contamination of our food and water, exacerbated wildfires and many other harrowing things.\n\nNYC SAYS 1.1M STUDENTS CAN ATTEND CLIMATE STRIKE PROTEST WITHOUT PUNISHMENT\n\nIf Democrat presidential candidates have their way, lessons like this teacher\u2019s will be standard in every classroom in America. The teachers\u2019 unions spend billions electing Democrats and have schemed for decades to implement climate change talking points into curriculums and pressure school boards and administrations on the issue too.\n\nAnd it\u2019s working.\n\nIn San Diego Unified School District, the school board voted to cancel school on September 20 so students can participate in a national climate change protest. The board\u2019s resolution says the Trump administration \u201cundermines the validity of climate change\u201d and points to \u201cemerging legislation like the Green New Deal\u201d as a ray of hope.\n\nSan Diego\u2019s school board should be more concerned with educating its students than canceling classes to send little kids to fill a picket line in support of a partisan agenda.\n\nParents in San Diego say school \u201cleaders\u201d never bothered to consult them about their kids being leveraged for politics. One of those parents, Amy, points out that a 2018 assessment of California student performance shows 43.65% of San Diego Unified School District\u2019s students don\u2019t meet standards in English Language Arts/Literacy and 52.84% don\u2019t meet standards in math.\n\nSounds to me like San Diego\u2019s kids should be in class! That\u2019s what we pay for as taxpayers, not political activism.\n\nBut school district officials controlled by powerful state and national teachers\u2019 unions couldn\u2019t care less about taxpayers, facts, the actual jurisdiction of schools, or parental rights. Instead, greedy for the wealth and power gained by doing the bidding of unions (or too cowardly to stand up to unions), they brazenly merge politics into our schools while destroying the very foundation of America\u2019s educational system.\n\nSan Diego Unified wrote it, \u201cencourages all professional educators to support student Global Climate Walkout events provided that educational outcomes are demonstrated (e.g., preparing an essay or video on the experience, documenting planning time).\u201d\n\nSince when are educators who allow students to walk out of classrooms during learning hours considered \u201cprofessional?\u201d And since when are essays and videos reflecting student protests considered \u201ceducational outcomes?\u201d Professional educators seek outcomes (hopefully student mastery) based on the goals and objectives of their subject matter not the passions of kids indoctrinated by activists.\n\nNew York City public schools has also announced students will receive excused absences if they attend global youth climate strikes. Actions like these in NYC and San Diego are also used to promote the left\u2019s gun control agenda through March for Our Lives student protests.\n\nHave you noticed these protests only support the leftist agenda, and we\u2019re always told they\u2019re started by kids, but they\u2019re bankrolled by millions?\n\nSimple deductive reasoning reveals that union-controlled school districts are exploiting our kids for their political agenda. What kid wouldn\u2019t skip school to hang out with friends at a big well-funded event that causes worldwide controversy and receives massive media coverage?\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see how our educational system has been turned on its head once you understand that labor unions \u2014 not professional educators \u2014 now run our schools.\n\nConnect the dots with me.\n\nFirst, the National Education Association changed the definition of the scientific method, swapping facts with theory. NEA removed \u201cempirical evidence derived from valid scientific experimentation...\u201d and replaced it with \u201cscientific theory...methodology...processes\u2026\u201d that \u201cleads towards scientific consensus.\u201d\n\nSecond, with judgmental arrogance, they only accept the \u201cconsensus\u201d of scientists who advance their hysterical climate change narrative.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThird, the NEA passed Business Item 29 (2019), which empowers them to implement their climate change curriculum into schools across the country while providing online resources for teachers including \u201cunion-friendly teaching resources.\u201d\n\nFourth, they label anyone who dares challenge their hysteria as \u201cclimate change deniers.\u201d\n\nTheir rationale? \u201cWe must embrace the imminent crisis of climate change. Every student must be exposed to the threat their generation faces. They must also be told of the real solutions and how they can make a difference.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThis is how union activist \u201cteachers\u201d get away with using our kids on picket lines and presenting lessons you\u2019d expect to see in Communist China like \u201chave one or no children.\u201d\n\nAll of these reasons and more are why thousands of America\u2019s real teachers are pushing back against labor unions. But we need your help. Unions have used our union dues to lavish billions on unscrupulous Democrat politicians for decades. Tragically, most teachers have no idea we\u2019re being exploited, nor do they realize we just won them the right to stop funding unions.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REBECCA FRIEDRICHS", "description": "In San Diego Unified School District, the school board voted to cancel school on September 20 so students can participate in a national climate change protest.", "authors": ["Rebecca Friedrichs", "Rebecca Friedrichs Is The Founder Of"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/AP19256641984516.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
