The five-year LPR was fixed at 4.85%, unchanged from September.\n\nA Reuters poll last week had forecast the rate would be cut again following reductions in August and last month.\n\nIt is the third fixing since the People's Bank of China (PBOC) unveiled the new lending benchmark, which is set by 18 banks.\n\nThe new LPR is linked to the rate on PBOC's medium-term lending facility (MLF), which is determined by broader financial system demand for central bank liquidity. The one-year MLF rate, last cut in February 2016, now stands at 3.3%.", "description": "The one- and five-year Loan Prime Rates for October remained at 4.20% and 4.85%, respectively \u2014 unchanged from September.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106085469-1566201160341gettyimages-1166413333.jpeg?v=1568247453", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
