Millions of residents on the East Coast are watching to see if the storm will turn north in the next two days and spare the state with a direct hit.\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT DORIAN'S PATH\n\n\u201cNo matter what path this storm takes, our state will be impacted,\u201d Jared Moskowitz, the director of the state\u2019s Department of Emergency Management, said. \u201cWe will continue to work around the clock to prepare.\u201d\n\nThe National Hurricane Center on Sunday issued its first hurricane warning for parts of Florida related to Dorian. The storm has slowed early Monday and is moving west at 5 mph.\n\nIF YOU'RE IN STORM'S PATH, YOU SHOULD KNOW THESE CRITICAL THINGS\n\nThe warning affected areas from Juniper Inlet, in Palm Beach County -- stretching from the state\u2019s Atlantic coast into its rural center -- to the Volusia-Brevard County line. A hurricane watch also was issued from the Volusia-Brevard County line to the Flagler-Volusia County line.\n\nCONTINUING COVERAGE ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL\n\nGlenn Richards, the chief meteorologist on Fox 35, said late Sunday that the forecast \u201cturns Dorian northwest Monday afternoon/eve\u201d and should keep the storm about 50-70 miles off the coast of Central Florida.\n\n\u201cThis will produce tropical storm sustained winds and hurricane gusts along the coast with tropical-storm-force gusts inland. Still expecting 1-3 inches of rain inland with 3-6 inches near the coast,\u201d he said. \u201cWorst weather arrives early Tuesday and departs early Wednesday.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for Florida's East Coast from Deerfield Beach north to the Georgia state line. The same area was put under a storm surge watch. Lake Okeechobee was under a tropical storm watch.\n\nKen Graham, director of the hurricane center, urged people not to bet on safety just because the forecast track had the storm a bit offshore. With every new forecast, \"we keep nudging (Dorian's track) a little bit to the left\" -- that is, is closer to the Florida coast, Graham said.\n\nThe storm slammed into the Bahamas on Sunday as the strongest hurricane in modern records for the northwestern part of the islands.\n\nFLIGHT CANCELLATIONS\n\nDr. Hubert Minnis, the prime minister of the Bahamas, cried on Sunday as he described the devastation left behind. Forecasters said Dorian was most likely to begin pulling away from the Bahamas early Tuesday.\n\n\"This is a deadly storm and a monster storm. I can only say to them, that I hope this is not the last time they will hear my voice and may God be with them,\u201d he said.\n\nThere was little information from the affected islands, though officials expected many residents to be left homeless. Most people went to shelters as the storm approached, with tourist hotels shutting down and residents boarded up their homes.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDorian's maximum sustained winds reached 185 mph, with gusts up to 220 mph, tying the record for the most powerful Atlantic hurricane to ever make landfall.\n\nThat equaled the Labor Day hurricane of 1935, before storms were named. The only recorded storm that was more powerful was Hurricane Allen in 1980, with 190 mph winds, though it did not make landfall at that strength.\n\nSouth Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster issued an order Sunday for the mandatory evacuation of his state's entire coast. The order, which covers about 830,000 people, was to take effect at noon Monday, at which point state troopers were to make all lanes on major coastal highways one-way heading inland.\n\nA few hours later, Georgia's governor, Brian Kemp, ordered mandatory evacuations for that state's Atlantic coast, also starting at midday Monday. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper warned his state that it could see heavy rain, winds and floods later in the week.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to monitor this storm, all Floridians should follow local reports and heed the call for evacuations,\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said. \"We are ready to deploy assets as needed and will continue to monitor traffic and fuel levels as more counties come under hurricane watches and warnings.\u201d\n\nFox News' Frank Miles and the Associated Press contributed to this report", "description": "Florida weather officials warned late Sunday that Hurricane Dorian\u2014the Category 5 monster that continues to batter parts of the Bahamas with 185 mph winds\u2014 is the strongest storm to ever threaten the state\u2019s East Coast.", "authors": ["Edmund Demarche", "Edmund Demarche Is A News Editor For Foxnews.Com.
