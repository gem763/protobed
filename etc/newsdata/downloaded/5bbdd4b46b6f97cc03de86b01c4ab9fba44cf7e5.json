I guess all in all I wish I wasn't American.'\n\n'The guy lit up a room': US freelance journalist who was an avid rugby player\n\nSteven Sotloff, 31, from Miami, who freelanced for Time and Foreign Policy magazines, vanished in Syria in 2013\n\nUS journalist Steven Sotloff, 31, vanished in Syria in August 2013.\n\nMr Sotloff was not seen again until he appeared in a video released online by ISIS on August 2014, that showed James Foley's beheading.\n\nIn a second clip, published weeks later, entitled 'A Second Message to America,' Mr Sotloff appeared in a orange jumpsuit before he is beheaded by an Islamic State fighter.\n\nThe grandson of Holocaust survivors, Mr Sotloff grew up Miami, before attending the Kimball Union Academy boarding school in New Hampshire before studying at the University of Central Florida.\n\nWhile at Kimball, Mr Sotloff was an avid rugby player and on moving to UFC began working for the student newspaper there, the Central Florida Future.\n\nHe left this paper in 2005 and began to pursue his dreams of journalism full time.\n\n'The guy lit up a room. He was always such a loyal, caring and good friend to us,' former roommate Josh Polsky told the New York Times.\n\n'If you needed to rely on anybody for anything he would drop everything on a dime for you or for anyone else.'\n\nSotloff travelled to the Middle East as a freelance journalist and wrote reports from Bahrain, Egypt, Libya, Turkey and Syria.\n\nHe often had pieces in Time and Foreign Policy magazines.\n\n'A million people could have told him what he was doing was foolish, as it seemed to us outsiders looking in, but to him it was what he loved to do and you weren't going to stop him,' his friend, Emerson Lotzia, said.\n\n'Steve said it was scary over there. It was dangerous. It wasn't safe to be over there. He knew it. He kept going back.'\n\nBritish taxi driver who volunteered as an aid worker\n\nAlan Henning, a father-of-two, was kidnapped on Boxing Day 2013 as he delivered aid to Syrian refugees\n\nAlan Henning, a father-of-two, was kidnapped on Boxing Day 2013 as he delivered aid to Syrian refugees.\n\nThe taxi-driver, from Manchester, was kept hostage until he was beheaded by Jihadi John on video in October 2014.\n\nBefore he was killed, Mr Henning was forced to tell the camera that he was being murdered in retaliation for parliament's decision to attack ISIS.\n\nOriginally from Salford, he had seen the suffering first hand during a life-changing visit to a refugee camp, which inspired him to help the innocents whose lives were being wrecked by the conflict.\n\nAfter volunteering with a Muslim charity, the 47-year-old agreed to drive 3,000 miles in a convoy of old ambulances to help the aid effort and take much-needed medical supplies to hospitals in the northern Syrian province of Idlib.\n\nKnown as 'Gadget' to friends and family for his fondness for technology, Mr Henning had been washing cars in the UK to raise money for donations before setting off on his fourth visit to the country.\n\nHe travelled with eight others from charity Al-Fathiha Global, who intended to deliver vital equipment, including NHS ambulances packed with baby milk, nappies, food and defibrillators, but was kidnapped by ISIS extremists on Boxing Day, shortly after making the 4,000-mile journey to the town of Al-Dana.\n\nA fan of Phil Collins, which he enjoyed playing as he drove, Mr Henning was incredibly popular and during one trip insisted on sleeping inside his ambulance instead of a hotel to save money so it could be donated to the refugees instead.\n\nKasim Jameel, leader of the convoy on which Mr Henning was travelling when he was kidnapped, described his friend as a 'big softie.'\n\nDr Shameela Islam-Zulfiqar, who was also in the convoy, said Mr Henning was 'remarkable.'\n\n'He's such a compassionate and selfless human being,' she said. 'It just simply wasn't enough for Alan to sit back and just donate or raise awareness.\n\nHe had to get up and do something about what he'd seen Every time the convoys went he had a yearning to go. That really motivated him, to see, practically, first-hand the difference he was making.'\n\nScottish father-of-two who spent his career as an aid worker\n\nDavid Haines, who was beheaded a week after Steven Sotloff, was the first British victim of Jihadi John\n\nDavid Haines, who was beheaded a week after Steven Sotloff, was the first British victim of Jihadi John.\n\nThe father-of-two, from Holderness, East Yorkshire, was taken hostage while working for relief agency ACTED in Syria in March this year.\n\nHe was captured near the Atmeh refugee camp, just inside the Syrian border with Turkey.\n\nMr Haines spent his career as an aid worker helping to protect innocent civilians in developing nations.\n\nFor more than two decades, he travelled with aid agencies through Syria, Libya, the former Yugoslavia and South Sudan.\n\nHe dedicated his life to promoting peace in places of violent conflict and oversaw projects to save civilians from land mines.\n\nThe 44-year-old was described as a hero by his family, who were inspired by him to travel the world on further aid missions.\n\nHe had a teenage daughter in Scotland from a previous marriage with his first wife, and a four-year-old daughter, Athea, in Croatia from his second wife.\n\nMr Haines was brought up in Perth, Scotland, and studied at Perth Academy before joining the military aged 17.\n\nAccording to his online CV he spent 11 years in the military, holding 'various positions covering security and threat assessments in a number of different countries' between 1988 and 1999.\n\nIt did not specify with which armed forces he served, although his ISIS execution video claimed he had been in the Royal Air Force.\n\nHis brother Mike later confirmed this, saying he was an engineer.\n\n26-year-old who was helping refugees while living in Beirut\n\nPeter Kassig, a 26-year-old from Indiana, was beheaded by ISIS executioner Jihadi John in November 2014\n\nPeter Kassig, a 26-year-old from Indiana, started a non-profit organisation called Special Emergency Response and Assistance (SERA).\n\nThe Iraq war veteran, who was living in Beirut to provide relief for refugees of the Syrian crisis, was beheaded by ISIS executioner Jihadi John, in November 2014.\n\nWriting on his profile page on fundraising website FundRazr, Mr Kassig said he had previously worked as a medic in a hospital in Tripoli, Lebanon.\n\nHe said: 'When I first started this cause to help those in need, I was on my own but I saw first-hand the shortages in available resources and supplies for people who were suffering in Lebanon, Syria, and Turkey as a result of the violence.\n\n'The amount of feedback and support from people all around the world motivated me to get organised and develop a platform through which people could send donations to support the continuation of my work.'\n\nKassig joined the U.S. Army Rangers in 2006 and was deployed to Iraq in 2007.\n\nHe was honourably discharged for medical reasons after a brief tour and returned to the United States to study political science.\n\nHowever, in 2010, he decided to take time off from his studies and began his certification as an emergency medical technician.\n\nHe then decided to travel to Beirut to try and help those in need as a result of the Syria crisis.\n\nIt was after a short time in the country that he started up his own aid group, SERA.\n\nFew details are publicly known about how Kassig was taken captive.", "description": "Donald Trump touted in an overnight tweet that two ISIS fighters linked to beheadings in Syria has been taken into U.S. custody.", "authors": ["Katelyn Caralle", "U.S. Political Reporter", "Kayla Brantley For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/14/19539518-0-image-a-4_1570712543260.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
