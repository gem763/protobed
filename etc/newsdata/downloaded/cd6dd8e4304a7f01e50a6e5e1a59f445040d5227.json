This year alone, Iran brazenly shot down a U.S. drone and attacked six merchant vessels in international waters, prompting the U.S. to deploy the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group to protect American service members and international shipping lanes.\n\nBut such swift responses are impossible without the proper resources. Unfortunately, maintenance backlogs and funding shortfalls within the Navy are providing barriers to full naval readiness to address such conflicts. That was recently demonstrated by the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman\u2019s delayed deployment.\n\nIncreasingly belligerent threats, coupled with a realistic assessment of American military capability, capacity, and readiness, necessarily shine the spotlight on the need for consistent and increased defense funding.\n\nWhile the global operating environment and foreign threat levels are not fully within American control, our defense budget\u2014and, consequently, our military capacity and capabilities\u2014is exclusively within U.S. control.\n\nA bolstered defense budget is needed specifically to modernize the force and increase its size. Especially as Russia, China, and Iran fortify their own military capabilities, the United States must be fully ready to quell instability and conflict.\n\nToday, the United States possesses the strongest military in the world, but others are working as fast as they can to build capability. Our armed forces deserve the proper resources to operate at full capacity, capability, and readiness to defend America and our interests.", "description": "How prepared is the United States military to defend the American homeland, win wars abroad, and preserve freedom of commerce internationally?\n\nMarginally.\n\n\u201cMarginal\u201d is a reality-based description for America\u2019s military, according to The Heritage Foundation\u2019s 2020 Index of U.S. Military Strength.\n\nThe latest Index of U.S. Military Strength is a one-of-a-kind assessment, which unpacks American preparedness to achieve three primary goals by measuring U.S. military capacity, capability, and readiness.", "authors": ["Thomas Spoehr", "Director", "Center For National Defense", "Thomas W.
