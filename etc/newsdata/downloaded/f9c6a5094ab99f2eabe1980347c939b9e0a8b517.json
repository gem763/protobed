He will be preceded by President Jair M. Bolsonaro of Brazil, sometimes called the mini-Trump, a polarizing figure at home who, like Mr. Trump, dismisses fears about climate change and disparages critics on Twitter.\n\nAfter Mr. Trump comes President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, the former general who has come to symbolize the repression of the Arab Spring revolutions \u2014 although his appearance was thrown into doubt this past weekend as protests erupted at home. Then comes President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, an autocrat who has bullied critics and whose government is a leading jailer of journalists.\n\nTwenty-one leaders are speaking on Tuesday alone, and the final one scheduled is Boris Johnson, making his United Nations debut as Britain\u2019s prime minister. His visit came as the country\u2019s top court delivered a stinging rebuke to Mr. Johnson, ruling he had acted unconstitutionally in suspending Parliament, an action taken as he tries to take his country of the European Union by Oct. 31.", "description": "Presidents and prime ministers have converged at the world\u2019s most prominent diplomatic stage, amid crises ranging from climate change to possible armed conflict between Iran and the United States.", "authors": ["Rick Gladstone", "Alan Yuhas"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/world/24UNGA-live-promo3/24UNGA-live-promo3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
