It\u2019s not known if he is armed or has any hostages trapped inside with him.\n\nThe alarm was raised at roughly 8am local time when cleaning staff could not gain access to the building and were reportedly confronted by a topless man.\n\nThe police have established a security cordon and asked the public to avoid the area while they attempt to make contact with the man in the museum.\n\nAccording to unnamed police sources cited by French news outlets, the man wrote messages on the walls in Arabic, which referred to the museum and hell.\n\nThe suspect\u2019s motives are unclear and authorities currently believe they are dealing with someone suffering from mental illness, rather than it being an act of terrorism, according to statements made by the local prosecutor\u2019s office and cited by French media.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
