All ages, sexes and regions of the world are affected (and) each loss is one too many,\u201d the WHO\u2019s report said.\n\nSuicide was the second leading cause of death among young people aged between 15 and 29, after road injury, and among teenage girls aged 15 to 19 it was the second biggest killer after maternal conditions. In teenage boys, suicide ranked third behind road injury and interpersonal violence.\n\nOverall, close to 800,000 people die by suicide every year - more than are killed by malaria or breast cancer, or by war or homicide, the WHO said.\n\nGlobal rates have fallen in recent years - with a 9.8% decrease between 2010 and 2016 - but declines were patchy. In the WHO\u2019s Americas region, for example, rates rose by 6% in between 2010 and 2016.\n\nThe report also found that nearly three times as many men as women die by suicide in wealthy countries, in contrast to low- and middle-income countries, where the rates are more equal.\n\n\u201cSuicides are preventable,\u201d said the WHO\u2019s director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \u201cWe call on all countries to incorporate proven suicide prevention strategies into national health and education programmes.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: A logo is pictured on the World Health Organization (WHO) headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland, November 22, 2017. REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\n\nThe WHO said restricting access to pesticides was one of the most effective ways of reducing suicide numbers swiftly.\n\nPesticides are commonly used and usually result in death because they are so toxic, have no antidotes, and are often used in remote areas where there is no nearby medical help.\n\nThe WHO pointed to studies in Sri Lanka, where bans on pesticides have led to a 70% drop in suicides and an estimated 93,000 lives saved between 1995 and 2015.", "description": "Across the world, one person takes their own life every 40 seconds, and more people die by suicide every year than in war, the World Health Organization said on Monday.", "authors": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427948444&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF88158", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
