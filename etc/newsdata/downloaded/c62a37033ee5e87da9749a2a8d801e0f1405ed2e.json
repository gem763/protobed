Its main potential, he continued, is not for developed and already highly digitized economies, nor for cash-dominated informal economies, but for what he dubbed \u201cthird economies\u201d in which barter systems still prevail:\n\n\u201cThe third economy is an economy where people don\u2019t have access to electronic forms of distributing value or cash [...] Think of the people who live two hours outside Shanghai, China\u2019s central coast. They will use Bitcoin to trade and unlock international transactions outside of the existing frameworks in a manner that you and I cannot imagine.\u201d\n\nMasie also took pains to address fundamental misconceptions about Bitcoin, such as its alleged hackability \u2014 stressing that \u201cit\u2019s the exchanges that can be hacked, not the Bitcoin.\u201d\n\nIn parallel to his advocacy of decentralization, Masie took stock of the rise of tech corporations as a watershed for global markets:\n\n\u201cWhen combined, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Facebook and Microsoft\u2019s net asset value represents the same value as S&P 500 companies combined and this is extraordinary because we have never seen the concentration of wealth like this in history. Combined, these companies have value that equates to the gross domestic product rates of some countries.\u201d\n\nWeWork\u2019s woes\n\nWeWork \u2014 which notoriously saw breakneck growth \u2014 pulled its planned $47 billion initial public offering earlier this year amid a spate of controversies over its business model and corporate governance.\n\nEarlier this week, reports surfaced that the firm was poised to sack 2,000 of its employees imminently \u2014 roughly 13% of its workforce.\n\nThis September, Cointelegraph published an analysis of the prospects for crypto adoption in South Africa, the second-largest economy on the continent, which some recent surveys suggest has the highest ratio of crypto owners among internet users, at 10.7%, in the world.", "description": "Computer scientist and general manager of WeWork South Africa Stafford Masie says that Bitcoin will change the future of humanity more than any other tech innov...", "authors": ["Marie Huillet"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvOTJlODYzMjVhYTZjZDdmNzkyMzNiODE2YmM2ODViNjUuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
