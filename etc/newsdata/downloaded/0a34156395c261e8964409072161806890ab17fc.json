He has yet to lodge an official bail application.\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s court appearance, the legal teams on both sides were arguing over whether the three are flights risks, whether they\u2019re a danger to society, and whether there\u2019s enough evidence to support claims they might interfere with witnesses.\n\nThe situation is poised on a knife-edge now, says Amy\u2019Leigh\u2019s granddad Christo.\n\n\u201cI could hardly believe my ears when I heard they\u2019re planning on entering a not-guilty plea \u2013 it was a tremendous shock,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense \u2013 there\u2019d already been confessions. And in those confessions there\u2019s already been testimony about how the kidnapping plans had been executed and who\u2019d been involved in the planning.\u201d\n\nChristo says he was disgusted when the three accused\u2019s lawyer smiled when the court heard testimony about Amy\u2019Leigh\u2019s wellbeing. Last week, the six-year-old\u2019s parents, Wynand and Angeline, told YOU the little girl struggles with stomach ulcers and nightmares \u2013 and that doctors believe they\u2019re caused by the trauma of her kidnapping.\n\n\u201cThe lawyers are constantly trying to prove Amy\u2019Leigh is unharmed. And today, when testimony was delivered about her health challenges, one of them grinned. It makes me furious. No, more than that \u2013 it makes my blood boil. I can\u2019t believe they\u2019re implying she suffered no ill effects after the whole drama,\u201d Christo says.\n\nHe adds the family are now waiting anxiously to see what\u2019s going to happen in court in the next few weeks. But their first priority is to protect Amy\u2019Leigh and her brother, Jayden (5).\n\n\u201cOf course we want this thing to come to an end . . . For now I have no reason to be bitter about our legal system yet. These guys [police detectives] fought hard to bring Amy\u2019Leigh back to us and they\u2019re [state prosecutors] fighting equally hard to make the guilty parties pay for what they did. We believe that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going to happen \u2013 the guilty will pay.\u201d", "description": "He felt his blood boil with indignation when he heard the three suspects in his granddaughter\u2019s kidnapping case plead not guilty in court, says Amy\u2019Leigh de Jager\u2019s grandfather.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9428/a08284e01ea045c0aa79ff9e8102372d.png", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
