Photo: Renata Brito/Associated Press Over the past year, while Mr. Salvini was Interior Minister, Italy clashed repeatedly with other EU countries over NGO-run boats carrying migrants rescued at sea, which Mr. Salvini often banned from entering Italian ports. Mr. Salvini lost his office this month after a failed attempt to trigger snap elections, and is now in opposition\u2014but opinion polls show his party is well-placed to win elections if Italy\u2019s new, rickety coalition fails. \u201cWith Salvini out of power, European leaders are showing greater flexibility toward Italy to try to defuse the migration issue from the populists\u2019 arsenal,\u201d said Wolfango Piccoli, co-president of political-risk consulting firm Teneo. \u201cIt is certainly encouraging for the new government in Rome, but the new scheme is voluntary and temporary and it involves only a few countries.\u201d Italy has for years complained that the EU has left it alone to deal with the problem of barely controlled immigration across the Mediterranean. The sea passage from Libya to Italy has been one of the main routes through which refugees from warzones and migrants seeking a better life have tried to reach Europe. The number of migrants landing in Italy has dropped sharply since 2017, but the issue continues to divide politics in Italy, as in much of the rest of the EU. Italy\u2019s new, left-leaning governing coalition under Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has vowed to work together with the EU on migration, rather than confront it as Mr. Salvini did. German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said on Monday that he hoped 12-14 EU countries would participate in the distribution scheme for migrants rescued at sea. Mr. Seehofer said the migrants would be brought to ports in Italy, Malta and possibly France, where they would undergo security checks before being distributed within four weeks to participating EU countries. The recipient countries would process their asylum claims, and would have the right to withdraw from the pact if the arrangement, or the numbers of migrants, became disorderly, he said. \u201cWe want to save people from drowning: that\u2019s our humane duty. But we also want order in the whole migration situation,\u201d Mr. Seehofer said. Write to Giovanni Legorano at giovanni.legorano@wsj.com\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
