Psychopaths display different traits depending on their disorder. Common signs include superficial charm, a grandiose notion of self-worth, the need for stimulation and impulsiveness, pathological lying, the ability to manipulate others and a lack of remorse and empathy. But despite the popular association, not all psychopaths become killers. Experts claim people usually find psychopaths intriguing, but can't put their finger on why. This is down to incongruous behaviour because psychopaths tend to do a lot of acting to deceive, or mimic normal reactions, sometimes changing their views and reactions quickly. For example, Self-professed psychopath Jacob Wells said that upon meeting someone, he tries to become 'the most interesting person they know' and presumably adopts suitable interests and responses to do this. His response also gives away another common trait - a grandiose notion of self-worth - in that he can be the most interesting person in the room. Psychopaths occasionally tend to exhibit unconvincing emotional responses, with slip-ups including tone of voice or body language. This may be because they are unable to understand emotions such as fear and love, but can mimic them. Psychopaths display different traits depending on their disorder, but common signs include superficial charm and the ability to manipulate others. Despite the popular association, not all psychopaths become killers (stock image) Generally psychopaths' 'emotions' are shallow and short-lived and there is a manipulative ulterior motive to showing them. For example, Mr Wells said he offers to do favours and tells false secrets to people to gain their complete trust. He also displays insincere charm - another trait associated with psychopaths. He says: 'I keep secrets, and tell them fake secrets to further gain their trust, and once they trust me enough, I ask for favours, reminding them of the favours I did them. I can get literally anything from them, which is incredibly useful.' Psychopaths typically display an incredible ability to manipulate others and sometimes take pleasure in doing so. Psychopaths often have an air of superiority about them, perhaps shown by Mr Wells' belief he can spot other psychopaths Even expert Dr Hare, who came up with the Hare Psychopathy Checklist-Revised (PCL-R) used as a diagnostic tool to determine where someone lies on the psychopathy spectrum, warns that anyone can be duped during a short interaction with a psychopath.\n\nWhat he found adds to past research which has suggested psychopathic traits can give individuals an evolutionary advantage.\n\nScientists from Serbia found in 2017 that prisoners who scored higher on psychopathy tests tended to have more children than those who scored lower.\n\nThey said the manipulative traits psychopaths embody made them more likely to be successful at finding partners to have sex with.\n\nMr Brazil said understanding these traits \u2013 over-confidence and always saying the right things, for example \u2013 could help people spot potentially dangerous partners.\n\nHe added: 'More research needs to be done on this, but whatever the reason, our research shows that psychopathic traits certainly don\u2019t seem \"disordered\".\n\n'There is something in this personality style that may provide individual benefits, which makes us think it is not a disorder.'", "description": "A researcher from Brock University in Ontario used a video dating scenario to find women were attracted to psychopathic men (Pictured: Cristian Bale as Patrick Bateman in American Psycho).", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/15/19993532-0-image-a-8_1571667462634.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
