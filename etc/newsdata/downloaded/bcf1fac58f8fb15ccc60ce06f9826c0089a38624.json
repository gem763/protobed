A White House spokesman denied that the document was a White House product \u2014 even though its top legislative official was briefing GOP senators on the plan\u2019s details.\n\nMany Republicans who reviewed the specifics of the background checks measure remained lukewarm about it, and a handful of GOP senators who had been directly briefed by Attorney General William P. Barr on the plan acknowledged that the proposal was incomplete \u2014 at best.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know who leaked it,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), who discussed the proposal with Barr on Tuesday. \u201cBut obviously that wasn\u2019t the idea.\u201d\n\nFor weeks, President Trump has publicly vowed to advance a package of ideas to reduce gun violence, as mass shootings in Texas and Ohio galvanized public support for new restrictions and pressure mounted on Capitol Hill to pass substantive legislation addressing the issue.\n\nThe administration \u2014 led by Barr and Eric Ueland, the White House\u2019s director of legislative affairs \u2014 began circulating a one-page document on Capitol Hill this week, outlining a new requirement for background checks on all advertised commercial gun sales.\n\nThe plan was first reported by the Daily Caller, a conservative news website.\n\nAfter the plan became public, the White House immediately distanced itself. Trump, who has waffled publicly and in private on various firearms restrictions, has not endorsed any one proposal, a White House spokesman said.\n\n\u201cThat is not a White House document,\u201d said the spokesman, Hogan Gidley, referring to the Justice Department plan. \u201cAny suggestion to [the] contrary is completely false.\u201d\n\nBarr, who returned to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to continue briefing senators on the proposal, said in brief remarks to reporters that he was \u201cjust kicking around some ideas\u201d in his meetings this week. He declined to get into specifics, saying simply: \u201cThere are a number of proposals being considered.\u201d\n\nBut the plan drew immediate opposition from the NRA, where officials were privately unhappy Wednesday after they reviewed the memo and expressed concern about the White House\u2019s handling of the talks, according to one top NRA executive who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nThat concern was quickly relayed to allies on Capitol Hill, according to the executive, who said the outline \u201creads like a pathway to gun registration and confirms their worst fears.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis missive is a non-starter with the NRA and our 5 million members because it burdens law-abiding gun owners while ignoring what actually matters: fixing the broken mental health system and the prosecution of violent criminals,\u201d said Jason Ouimet, executive director of the NRA\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action.\n\nEven before details began to emerge this week, congressional Republicans had been struggling to unite behind a firearms plan, particularly with little direction from the mercurial Trump when it came to what kind of gun measures he would endorse. One senior White House official said public rollout of a guns package was unlikely this week because of dissension within the administration.\n\n[White House prepares gun proposals, but where Trump stands is unclear]\n\nAlthough it was drafted with some White House input, the background check proposal surprised key White House officials including acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who was traveling with the president on the West Coast and not involved in writing the memo, said a senior administration official.\n\nTrump\u2019s conservatives allies have told him that he would never get credit for toughening gun laws no matter what he does, and that endorsing additional gun restrictions would only depress enthusiasm among his core base of voters, according to two White House officials.\n\nMeanwhile, Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter and a White House senior adviser, has been the biggest force within the administration lobbying for a plan that would expand background checks, according to a White House official familiar with the internal dynamics \u2014 prompting fears from elsewhere in the White House that the president himself would go for it because she is pushing it.\n\nThe White House officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to freely discuss private deliberations.\n\nA broad swath of Republican senators also hail from rural states, where the culture of gun ownership runs deep and where voters are averse to any measure that would be seen as infringing on Second Amendment rights.\n\nSen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said the proposal that was being pitched by the administration appeared similar to legislation drafted by Sens. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) and Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) in 2013 that failed to advance in a Senate controlled by Democrats.\n\n\u201cExpanding background checks has always been viewed by a lot of our constituents, my constituents, as a slippery slope and probably something that\u2019s not all that helpful,\u201d Cramer said. \u201cI think most people I know, in North Dakota anyway, prefer dealing with existing law and enforcing it better.\u201d\n\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), a favorite of the right who also met with Barr earlier this week, declined to take a position on the administration\u2019s proposal and also cautioned that the plan was premature.\n\n\u201cMy question to the attorney general [on Tuesday] was, \u2018What is the president going to support? What is the president going to put forward?\u2019 \u201d Hawley said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know the answer to that yet.\u201d\n\nThe lack of enthusiasm on the right didn\u2019t mean Democrats were on board, either.\n\n\u201cIt is strange to be shopping [a proposal] that doesn\u2019t have the president\u2019s imprimatur,\u201d said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), one of the most prominent advocates of gun control in Congress. He said he had yet to endorse or oppose the plan drafted by Barr.\n\nThe two senators who appeared even remotely warm to the administration\u2019s offer were Manchin and Toomey \u2014 who, along with Murphy, met privately with Barr in Toomey\u2019s office on Capitol Hill later Wednesday.\n\nStill, the three men \u2014 each of whom has spoken with the president repeatedly in recent weeks \u2014 cautioned that nothing had been finalized.\n\n\u201cI think he has advanced some ideas that are very constructive, very thoughtful and could go a long way toward expanding background checks in a way that poses absolutely minimal inconvenience on law-abiding citizens and increases the chances that we would keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people who shouldn\u2019t have them,\u201d Toomey said. \u201cI think there\u2019s some details that still need to be worked out.\u201d\n\n[Waiting for Trump, Congress remains at loggerheads on gun legislation]\n\nYet whatever is finalized among senators may fall short in the Democratic-led House, where the leadership had demanded nothing short of a universal background checks bill that passed earlier this year but faces a veto threat from the White House.\n\nRep. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.), chairman of House Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, said he would review the administration\u2019s plan but noted that Trump has flirted with embracing expanded background checks only to back away.\n\nUeland, speaking to reporters on Capitol Hill, dismissed such criticism.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t put any credence [in] that at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s important for people to realize that this president is open to and seeks input across a wide array of perspectives as he comes to conclusions about policy decisions, which you all witness, cover, talk about on television, put in print and tweet about nonstop.\u201d\n\nWhen asked who drafted the memorandum, Ueland just laughed.\n\nRobert Costa, Erica Werner, Mike DeBonis and Karoun Demirjian contributed to this report.\n\nRead more at PowerPost", "description": "Republican senators were lukewarm about the proposal after a briefing by the attorney general.", "authors": ["Seung Min Kim", "White House Reporter", "Paul Kane", "Senior Congressional Correspondent", "Josh Dawsey", "Reporter Covering The White House", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/qq-ck9O8V0k29qi7dSs5TkxCShk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/RKZF4DW2NAI6TLDDGALHCFKD7Y.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
