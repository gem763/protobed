If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nI'm a strong believer that every weekend should be a three-day weekend (how else are you supposed to run errands and have some semblance of a social life?!). But because that sadly will never be the case, I live for the few long weekends we do get: Labor Day, Memorial Day, Columbus Day, the works.\n\nAnd that also means that when one of those rare three-day weekends rolls around, I try to make the most of it. And these 21 things\u2014all of which you can get on Amazon\u2014will help you do just that. Whether you're vacationing or staycationing, here's to enjoying that extra day off.\n\n1. Our number one luggage\n\nThe built-in accessory pockets will help keep you organized. (Photo: Reviewed.com/Seamus Bellamy)\n\nIf you're a notorious over-packer like I am, you know the struggle that is trying to fit everything you could ever possibly need into a small carry-on. Even for a quick getaway, you need a full-sized suitcase. This one from Travelpro is our experts' top pick because its easy to navigate through crowded airports (spinning wheels for the win!) and can expand an additional two inches so you can squeeze in every last pair of shoes.\n\nGet the Travelpro Platinum Magna 2 Expandable Spinner Suiter for $327.58\n\n2. This cooler that keeps things cold for up to 14 days\n\nChill as many cans as you want thanks to the OtterBox' 45-quart capacity. (Photo: Reviewed.com/Jackson Ruckar)\n\nOne thing that's necessary no matter what your weekend plans are is plenty of ice cold beverages. We put some of the top cooler brands to the test and found that the OtterBox Venture Cooler was the best at keeping its contents cool the longest (it's even better than Yeti!). Plus, its design and lock-latching system make it both leak-proof and very versatile.\n\nGet the OtterBox Venture Cooler for $349.99\n\n3. This cult-favorite instant camera\n\nSay cheese! (Photo: Instax)\n\nThe holiday weekend may only last three days, but your memories will hopefully last even longer. At least they will if you have the Instax Mini 90. We named it the best instant camera because of its seemingly endless features including macro mode and a double exposure setting and its long battery life.\n\nGet the Fujifilm Instax Mini 90 Neo Classic Camera for $124\n\n4. These grill tongs every pitmaster needs\n\nBehind every good griller is an even better set of tongs. (Photo: Reviewed.com/Lindsay D. Mattison)\n\nFlip burgers with ease? Check. Grab veggies securely? Check. It's all possible with our experts' preferred grill tongs. They are comfortable to hold (so your hands won't get tired when you're standing over the grill all afternoon) and have a no-slip grip so your food will end up where it belongs\u2014on your plate\u2014instead of on the ground.\n\nGet the OXO Good Grips Grilling Tongs for $14.99\n\n5. This top-rated portable charger\n\nDead phone? Not you. (Photo: Reviewed.com/Michael Desjardin)\n\nWhile we recommend putting your phone on airplane mode until Tuesday morning and step away from your email inbox, we also know you might need your phone for taking pictures, navigating to your getaway destination, or blasting your perfectly curated playlist.

This incredibly effective bug spray\n\nBugs begone! (Photo: Repel)\n\nHanging out in the backyard with your friends is all fun and games until you wake up the next morning covered in itchy bug bites.

This koozie from the internet's favorite cooler brand\n\nCrack a cold one. (Photo: Yeti)\n\nYeti has a reputation for making some of the best coolers on the market. And the brand's take on a koozie\u2014made with double-wall vacuum insulation\u2014is equally good at keeping your drinks cold (or hot!). Available in a varietu of colors, the Colster has over 2,000 5-star reviews for being super durable and effective at chilling both cans and bottles.\n\nGet the Yeti Rambler Colster for $24.99\n\n8. This Bluetooth speaker you can take anywhere\n\nPlay your vacation soundtrack on this compact speaker. (Photo: Reviewed.com/Betsey Goldwasser)\n\nNo matter what you're listening to this weekend (I'll have the new Taylor Swift album on repeat, obviously), it'll sound much better coming from a Bluetooth speaker instead of the pathetic excuse for a speaker that your iPhone has. We like the JBL Flip 4 because it's good quality, mostly waterproof and has a longer battery life than most other speakers.\n\nGet the JBL Flip 4 for $99.95\n\n9. This best-selling travel pillow\n\nTravel naps are the best naps thanks to this pillow. (Photo: MLVOC)\n\nLong car rides or flights are a lot more bearable when you can sleep through them. But leaning against the window isn't exactly ideal (hello, stiff neck). This travel pillow\u2014which is the number one travel pillow on Amazon\u2014will help with that. With hundreds of positive reviews, it's popular because it's made of memory foam and provides superior support for your neck while still being incredibly comfortable.\n\nGet the MLVOC Travel Pillow for $21.99\n\n10. These cubes to help you pack smarter\n\nPacking doesn't have to be so hard with these cubes. (Photo: Reviewed.com/Seamus Bellamy)\n\nMy method of packing is throw everything in my suitcase an hour before I leave and pray nothing spills or gets too wrinkled in the process. A better solution would be to use these packing cubes, which our experts dubbed the best of the year. For less than $50, you'll get six cubes in four different sizes, each one very lightweight and compact so they'll fit snugly inside your suitcase.\n\nGet the eBags Classic Packing Cubes for $44.99\n\n11.

(Photo: Hydro Flask)\n\nEven if your weekend plans include just lounging on your back porch with a good book, hydration is key (and no, beer doesn't count). When we tested this Hydro Flask water bottle, it kept ice unmelted well past the 24-hour mark. Bonus: You can rotate caps to whichever style you prefer, from straw lids to flip-top lids.\n\nGet the Hydro Flask Standard Mouth Water Bottle for $29.95\n\n12.

All you need for a rainbow fire is this flame colorant, which has hundreds of positive reviews on Amazon. Happy campers (literally) like that the vibrant hues last for about an hour and that it's easy to use\u2014all you have to do is toss an unopened pouch into your fire and let the magic happen.\n\nGet Magical Flames for $19.25\n\n15. This wildly popular outdoor game\n\nThe first one to 21 wins! (Photo: Himal)\n\nFun fact: One of my proudest moments was the day I won my town's annual corn hole tournament. It's a game I'll play anytime, anywhere\u2014whether it's at the beach or at a tailgate or just in the backyard.
