Commissioner for Teacher Regulation, according to a consent agreement posted online Tuesday .\n\n\"Gu\u00e9rineau's actions had the potential to cause emotional harm to students,\" the agreement said, adding that she has acknowledged her actions were inappropriate.\n\nThe unfortunate series of events began on June 19, 2018, when a soiled pair of underwear was found on a toilet lid in the boys' bathroom, the agreement says. There were feces on the floor nearby.\n\nThe school's principal wasn't available, so Gu\u00e9rineau stepped in to deal with things and track down the culprit.\n\nShe asked the secretary to make an announcement over the PA system, then visited every classroom from grades 3 to 6, asking each boy to show her the waistband of his underpants.\n\nGu\u00e9rineau then asked male students in grades 7 to 11 to line up in the hallway, and repeated the exercise.\n\nThe school district placed her on paid leave two days later, then fired her on Oct. 1, 2018, with a termination date effective Sept. 17, 2018.\n\nThe district reported Gu\u00e9rineau to the Teacher Regulation Branch in December, and Gu\u00e9rineau admitted that she had committed professional misconduct. She has consented to a reprimand with the understanding that it would be made public.\n\nGu\u00e9rineau has been registered as a teacher in B.C. for four years.", "description": "The vice-principal at a francophone school in Comox was fired after she made every boy show her their underwear to prove they hadn't left a pair of soiled briefs in the bathroom.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5332503.1571859040!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/manitoba-high-school-lockers-stock-shot.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
