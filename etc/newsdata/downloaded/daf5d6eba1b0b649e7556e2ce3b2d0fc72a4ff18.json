He was soaked, freezing and curled up in his wet sleeping bag in the shelter of a pit toilet. Part of his feet and toenails had turned blue.\n\nCALIFORNIA HIKERS UNEARTH 'MYSTERY' HUMAN SKELTON BENEATH SECOND-HIGHEST PEAK\n\n\u201cYou count your blessings,\u201d the 50-year-old told the Salem Statesman Journal on Saturday. \u201cYou thank your lucky stars. Not to be overly dramatic, because people have been through much worse, I\u2019m sure, but I wouldn\u2019t have survived another night. I\u2019m convinced of that.\u201d\n\nCampbell set out on the famed trail near the Mexican border in early May with plans to trek all the way to the Canadian border some 2,650 miles away.\n\nBut, Campbell encountered trouble Wednesday night when snow began to fall. By Thursday, the snow had buried the trail. Not even a navigational smartphone app was able to keep him from straying miles off the trail and into a boulder field.\n\nHIKER DIES IN CALIFORNIA AFTER RUNNING OUT OF WATER ALONG TRAIL, OFFICIALS SAY\n\n\u201cYou just know, if anything happens, I\u2019m dead,\u201d Campbell told the paper. \u201cNo one\u2019s going to find me until spring.\u201d\n\nMany hikers have died trying to navigate the treacherous trail in similar conditions.\n\nIn 2017, the body of Chaocui Wang, who had quit her job in Shanghai, China, to hike the trail, turned up in a creek made swift by melting snowpack. In February, another hiker died after falling on ice. A falling tree killed a German hiker this year as well.\n\nCampbell acknowledged the danger he faced and called 911 on Thursday. But, the call dropped partway through and he lost his phone signal. The Marion County Sheriff\u2019s Office deployed a search-and-rescue team to find him after the distress call.\n\nMeanwhile, Campbell said he trudged into an empty campground and found the only available shelter: a pit toilet. Cold and wet, he waited. Friday afternoon, rescuers passed the campground and finally found his footprints.\n\n\u201cI really think I owe them my life because ... I couldn't have made it another night,\u201d Campell told The Associated Press from his motel room in Oregon. \u201cMy sleeping bag and tent are just completely soaked and probably ruined and I have no dry clothes.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut, Cambell said his adventure wasn\u2019t finished yet, declaring, \u201cCanada or bust.\u201d\n\n\u201cI'm going to be doing it a lot more smartly,\u201d he told The AP. \u201cAny chance of snow, I'm not going to even mess around with it.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A hiker who got lost in a snowstorm on the perilous Pacific Crest Trail in Oregon\u00a0says he wouldn't have lived another night if deputies didn't answer his desperate call for help.", "authors": ["Stephen Sorace"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/robert-campbell-hiker-lost.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
