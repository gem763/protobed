Ahead of the company's 3Q on Friday, we take a look at what's caused it and what may lie ahead.\n\nIn the current deteriorating macro environment, the world\u2019s largest and producers have been reluctant to increase spending, thus thwarting the company's efforts to recover from the downturn it's been stuck in since the middle of 2014.\n\nSchlumberger, which operates in more than 120 countries, supplying the industry's most comprehensive range of products and services, from exploration through production, has seen its stock plunge more than 45% in the past year. Trading at $31.95 at Wednesday's close, it\u2019s down more than 65% in the past five years.\n\n\n\n\n\nSchlumberger price chart\n\nThis drastic correction has made its stock quite cheap. Its forward price-to-earnings multiple of 17.37 is close to the lowest in the past five years, while its 6.1% dividend yield looks attractive in this low-rate environment.\n\nThese multiples may appear appealing, but with no near-term growth catalyst on the horizon, investors have no incentive to get excited about the oil servicing companies.\n\nSlowing Oil and Gas Investment\n\nUnder pressure from shareholders, exploration and production companies are keeping spending in check, returning most of their free cash flow to shareholders in the shape of dividends and share buybacks.\n\nSchlumberger itself isn\u2019t shying away from admitting that reality. In the last conference call in July, the company told analysts that it expects oil production from North American shale basins to slow as explorers cut spending after the recent wave of mergers and acquisitions and the move away from growth.\n\nSpending among producers in North America is likely to decline 10% this year, according to Schlumberger \u2014 and the only other avenue though which the company can increase revenue is via its international business.\n\nSchlumberger\u2019s business outside the U.S. and Canada is where the company generates most of its income. The company is forecasting single-digit growth for 2019, with explorers slated to boost spending as much as 8%. The earnings potential for Schlumberger internationally is about four times that of its competitors when considering its larger market share and operating margin.\n\nBut betting on its global growth is also risky. Many large oil producing nations are in pain and keeping their supplies under check because of fears of a global supply glut. We don\u2019t expect that situation to change anytime soon, and hence see no near-term upside for Schulmberger stock.\n\nIn its call with analysts tomorrow, the most important thing for investors to focus on is how many more cuts in capital spending Schulmberger is willing to make to protect its $2 a share annual dividend.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe stocks of oil services companies have become cheaper after a precipitous decline in the past five years. But despite their more attractive valuations, we don\u2019t think the time has come to snap up their shares. In this uncertain global economic and geopolitical environment, oil prices may not remain higher sustainably. It would be better for investors to avoid entering this trade now.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Investing.com (Haris Anwar/Investing.com) covering: Schlumberger NV, Crude Oil WTI Futures, Natural Gas Futures.
