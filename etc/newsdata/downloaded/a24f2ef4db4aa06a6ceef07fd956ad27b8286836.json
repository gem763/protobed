Under these circumstances the\n\nprice of oil could remain elevated for some time yet,\" City\n\nIndex analyst Fiona Cincotta said.\n\n\"However, let's not also forget that the demand picture\n\nisn't great right now which will dampen the oil price quickly.\n\nMost recently China's industrial production figures disappointed\n\novernight,\" Cincotta said.\n\nSaudi Arabia is the world's biggest oil exporter and, with\n\nits comparatively large spare capacity, has been the supplier of\n\nlast resort for decades.\n\nThe attack on state-owned producer Saudi Aramco's\n\ncrude-processing facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais cut output by\n\n5.7 million barrels a day and threw into question its ability to\n\nmaintain oil exports.\n\nThe company has not given a specific timeline for the\n\nresumption of full output. Refiners in Asia, the world's biggest consuming region, were\n\nscrambling for alternative supplies, while U.S. crude producers\n\nramped up efforts to export crude and Saudi Arabia tried to\n\nsecure refined products.", "description": "REFILE-Oil falls more than 1% as market awaits response to Saudi oil attacks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/indicatornews_6_800x533_L_1412601562.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
