It was disgusting, it shouldn't be happening and something needs to be done about it but I thought the lads were outstanding and if I was angry I'm sure they were angry as well.\n\n\u201cI thought we let the football do the talking and we made them suffer - that is what we wanted to do.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Sportimage)\n\nAnd as the debate rages about whether England should have left the field and not returned, Henderson believes they did the right thing.\n\nHe explained: \u201cI felt as though as a team we dealt with it so well, we touched on it before we came here just in case it did happen and unfortunately it did.\n\n\u201cSo we spoke together and the decision was that we carried on because if you leave the pitch and stop the game they win, really.\n\n\u201cIt will just make us stronger, no doubt. We stayed together like we should have, handled it well and if one player didn't want to carry on we would have stopped playing - simple as that, no problem. But everyone wanted to carry on and we wanted to let football do the talking.\u201d", "description": "England's Euro 2020 qualifier vs Bulgaria was twice suspended after racist abuse, including Nazi salutes, from the home crowd", "authors": ["Andy Dunn", "Image", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Getty Images", "Sportimage"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20586443.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Euro-2020-Qualifier-Group-A-Bulgaria-v-England.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
