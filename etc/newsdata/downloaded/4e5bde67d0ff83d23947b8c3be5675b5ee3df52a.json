'But when you're moving into the box at pace and cutting across defenders, whether the VAR decides it is a penalty or not is one thing.\n\nFrank Lampard has backed Hudson Odoi, insisting he would warn him if he genuinely dived\n\n'I thought there were a lot of things going on in the game, of people going down. Their bench wanted everything that was happening, every time Ashley Barnes has a contest in the air, he falls to the ground, they want a free-kick.\n\n'If it was a dive I'd address it for sure. I need to look back at it but I actually don't think it's as clean cut an argument as that.'\n\nHis opposite number Sean Dyche has been a huge critic of simulation in the past and has called for tougher action from the Premier League, and he admitted diving still baffles him.\n\n'I can't abide it,' he said. 'I don't know why it's in the game. We were told by the Premier League the worst you can get is a yellow card, so everyone has a chance to cheat once a game knowing they are not going to get sent off.\n\nBurnley boss Sean Dyche wants players to 'respect the game' and has called diving 'shambolic'\n\n'It's not about the player tonight - the greater good of the game. Because it's shambolic how people just dive all over the place. I keep hearing this word respect. Respect the game. That is what people should be doing.'\n\nChelsea continued their good recent form with a confident win at Burnley, with Christian Pulisic grabbing the headlines with his first professional hat-trick.\n\nThe US star was nicknamed 'Captain America' by team-mate Fikayo Tomori after his heroics, which come after the midfielder had been struggling for game time under his manager Lampard.\n\n4-2 win\ud83e\udd29\u26bd\ufe0f.
