There, government-guaranteed debt makes up almost 19 per cent of gross domestic product - nearly five times the average for the Asia-Pacific, excluding China.\n\nMeanwhile, liabilities associated with public-private partnerships (PPPs) are rising in the region, but \u201conly a small number of countries reveal their possible risks from PPPs (including Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Japan)\u201d, the report remarked. \u201cAnd some governments might not adhere to global accounting standards for PPP disclosure.\u201d", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES ASEAN Business - The risk of bailing out state-owned enterprises (SOEs) could put pressure on emerging and \u201cfrontier\u201d markets, Moody\u2019s Investors Service has warned. .
