Sunlight, infections and medications can trigger the disease. Common symptoms include fatigue, fever, joint pain, a butterfly-shaped rash on the face, skin lesions and headaches.\n\nInaba said she's made various lifestyle changes since learning she has lupus.\n\n\u201cI quit Diet Coke. I also stopped going in the sun because when you have lupus you\u2019re allergic to UV light, which I didn\u2019t know, so I was causing my own flare-ups.\u201d\n\nStaying out of the sun has been a difficult change because of where Inaba is from, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m from Hawaii, that\u2019s what we do,\u201d she said.\n\nINDIANA MOM WARNS OTHERS OF COMMON VIRUS AFTER SON, 3, HOSPITALIZED\n\nIn the past, Inaba has discussed being diagnosed as having Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA), a condition in which the blood \u201clacks adequate healthy red blood cells,\u201d per the Mayo Clinic.\n\n\u201cI was going through a time where I was very fatigued. I had body aches I had a little bit of anxiety, heart palpitations and a lot of brain fog,\u201d Inaba told Fox News in March. \u201cAnd we couldn't figure out what it was until my doctors gave me the correct test.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce I was diagnosed, it's like I got my life back,\u201d she once told People. \u201cI am so grateful.\u201d\n\nFox News' Lindsay Carlton contributed to this report.", "description": "\u2018Dancing with the Stars\u2019 judge Carrie Ann Inaba was candid this week when describing her life with the autoimmune disease lupus.", "authors": ["Madeline Farber", "Madeline Farber Is A Reporter For Fox News.
