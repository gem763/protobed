Scrawny cattle pick at sprigs of strawy grass on pastures that have turned to dust. Cows, goats and horses roam hungry on hills have turned to a dry muddy brown.\n\n\u201cThe drought has been disastrous for us,\u201d said Sandra Aguilar. Her family owned about a hundred head of cattle. Today, only half survive thanks to a trickle of water provided by a neighbor who still has some reserves.\n\n\u201cThe situation is complicated,\u201d said Javier Maldonado, governor of the province of Chacabuco, where several agricultural areas have been hit particularly hard by the drought.\n\n\u201cWe have to be realistic, climate change is here to stay,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 Water shortages \u2013\n\nDominga Mondaca points out the deep fissures that run through the garden behind her house in the village of La Ligua near Valparaiso. The garden used to be full of strawberries and citrus trees; now it\u2019s cracked earth.\n\n\u201cWe have had many years with little water. But the last year, it didn\u2019t rain at all,\u201d said the 73-year-old, one of more than 600,000 people the government is supplying by tanker trucks as part of emergency measures.\n\nShe says she has had to give up raising chickens, in order to keep what little water she and her husband receive for their own consumption, washing and cleaning. Whatever is left, she uses to sprinkle on herbs in a small kitchen garden.\n\nThe agriculture ministry says 37,000 family farms need assistance in the central Chile.\n\n\u2013 Thirsty avocados? \u2013\n\nIn Petorca, some rivers have run dry, and the landscape has been left parched, but lush avocado and citrus plantations are nevertheless thriving.\n\nLocals in Petorca say the real, long-term problem is the mismanagement of water resources.\n\n\u201cThere is an excess of monoculture plantations that consume all the water,\u201d said Diego Soto of the Movement for the Defense of Access to Water, Land and Environmental Protection (MODATIMA) told AFP.\n\nAvocados need a lot of water to grow, said Soto.\n\n\u201cAn avocado tree needs 600 liters of water per week, whereas humans consume 50 liters a day, or 350 liters a week,\u201d he said.\n\nProducers refute these figures and say the real problem is a lack of infrastructure to store water, both above and below ground.\n\n\u201cThe avocado is not a crop that needs more water,\u201d insisted Francisco Contardo, chairman of the local producers\u2019 committee.\n\nAvocados are a key export for Chile, mostly to the US and China, but drought has reduced exports by 25 percent.\n\n\u2013 Less snow \u2013\n\nFor many though, the changes being wrought by climate change are overwhelmingly obvious. Snow in the highlands of central Chile was relatively scarce this year.\n\nScientists predict an average decrease of between five and 10 percent snowfall every 10 years in almost the entire Andes mountains, one of the country\u2019s main sources of water.\n\n\u201cThe central zone of Chile is highly dependent on the summer melt season, its snow and glaciers, which means that if the snow cover is reduced, there is also a reduction in the availability of water resources,\u201d said Paul Cordero, climate change expert at the University of Santiago.\n\nWeak snowfall forced the country\u2019s main ski resorts to use artificial snow machines much earlier and more often this season than in previous years.\n\n\u201cChile has been living as if it were a country with an abundance of water,\u201d said Pinera.\n\n\u201cClimate change and global warming have changed this situation probably forever.\u201d", "description": "Petorca (Chile) (AFP) \u2013 For Erick Hurtado, the worst thing about the drought that has devastated his family farm in Chile is the dead animals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/04/8ca894_cows-on-farmland-left-arid-by-lack-rainwater-in-colina-north-santiago-chile-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
