REUTERS/Carlo Allegri\n\nOne early lesson from the Fed\u2019s daily interventions in money markets is that a standing repo facility, which would allow banks to convert Treasury holdings to cash, might not be enough on its own to make sure banks have the liquidity they need, Williams told reporters following an event organized by the Managed Funds Association\n\nThere are still a \u201cnumber of steps needed\u201d to spread reserves out more broadly throughout the banking system after a repo operation, he said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that alone would address the problem,\u201d Williams said. \u201cRepo does add reserves but it\u2019s not a perfect substitute for actually having a higher level of reserves permanent in the banking system.\u201d\n\nThe Fed expected that certain events happening in mid-September, including corporate tax payments and Treasury settlements, would increase demand for reserves, Williams said at the event earlier. However, the size of the payments and its effect on short-term borrowing rates \u201cwere outside of recent experience,\u201d he said.\n\nThe New York Fed calmed money markets and stabilized borrowing rates by injecting billions of dollars of cash into the financial system through daily operations in the market for repurchase agreements, or repos.\n\nThe central bank announced last week that it will continue to offer those daily repo operations through January. It also said it would increase the level of reserves in the banking system by purchasing short-term Treasury bills at an initial pace of about $60 billion per month.\n\nSpeaking about his outlook for the economy, Williams said the interest rate cuts the Fed approved this year leave monetary policy in a position to appropriately address current risks to economic growth and that future decisions will be set on a \u201cmeeting by meeting\u201d basis.\n\nWilliams said Fed officials factored in a slowdown in global growth, low inflation and uncertainty around trade policy when they decided to lower borrowing costs in July and September. But he said that while those concerns are still hovering over the economy, policymakers will need to focus on the outlook to justify future rate cuts.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to have this narrative that we still have the same conditions out there so does it mean we need to take further and further action,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cWhat we need to do is weigh or consider how those factors are influencing the outlook.\u201d\n\nWilliams said the economy is in a \u201cpretty good place\u201d and that consumers have been \u201cvery resilient.\u201d He cautioned that consumer spending is a lagging indicator, but said that so far the factors that affect consumer spending, including asset prices, job growth and wage gains, have been positive.", "description": "New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said Thursday the central bank is learning as it works to increase liquidity in the banking system and that it will adjust its approach as needed.", "authors": ["Jonnelle Marte", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1442051147&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G28D", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
