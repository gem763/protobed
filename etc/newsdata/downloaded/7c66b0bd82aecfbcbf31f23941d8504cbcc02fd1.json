Business Insider / Lamont Mark Smith\n\nRushing to get home but don\u2019t want to get caught in the peak hour jam? You may soon be able to take an air taxi across the island.\n\nExpected to begin operations by 2024, air taxi firm VoloPort unveiled its first public prototype of its Singapore vertiport \u2013 a landing port for aircraft which land or take off vertically \u2013 at the Marina Bay floating platform on Monday (Oct 21) as part of the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) World Congress.\n\nFirst announced earlier this year, the Marina Bay air taxi vertiport is the first that has come out of a collaboration between German aircraft manufacturer Volocopter and UK-based vertiport operator Skyports.\n\nThe air taxi service \u2013 operated on the Volocopter 2X \u2013 is meant to complement Singapore\u2019s already efficient transport system by tackling routes that traditionally face topographical challenges, VoloPort said.\n\nDamian Kysely, infrastructure manager at Skyports, told Business Insider in an interview that the service offers an alternative option when \u201ctravel time between point A to B is fairly long, especially during peak hours\u201d.\n\nAdditionally, he added that air taxis can connect nearby destinations like Johor Bahru and Batam, where the only modes of transport from Singapore currently are by causeway or sea.\n\nVolocopter estimates that the routes to Johor Bahru and Batam would only take 18 minutes and 20 minutes respectively, much faster than the current travel times of around one hour by car to Johor and 45 mins by ferry to Batam.\n\nApart from the Marina Bay vertiport, VoloPort is currently looking into nodes at areas such as Jurong East, Sentosa, Changi Airport, Seletar Airport and Tampines.\n\nHelena Treeck, senior public relations manager at Volocopter, told Business Insider that the service aims to have fares \u201csimilar to premium taxis\u201d in the long run.\n\nThe service could cost users \u201ca few hundred\u201d dollars when it first launches, but will \u201cdefinitely be cheaper than traditional helicopter flights\u201d, Treeck said.\n\nBusiness Insider saw the world\u2019s first VoloPort air taxi and vertiport up close at Marina Bay.\n\nHere\u2019s what it was like:\n\nThe vertiport prototype at the floating platform pans 2,500 square feet.\n\nOpen to congress guests, it showcases planned customer services such as pre-flight checks, passenger lounges and boarding procedures.\n\ncaption source Business Insider / Lamont Mark Smith\n\nAccording to the two companies, a single landing pad can accommodate 10 to 15 flights per hour, up to 150 flights a day and around 1,000 flights each week.\n\nSkyports \u2013 which provides the infrastructure for the VoloPort \u2013 said that the modular design of the take-off and landing pad can accommodate a wide range of air taxis, which means aircraft other than the Volocopter will also be able to use the pad.\n\nIts modular design can be easily adapted to fit rooftops, train stations, parking lots and other metropolitan locations, the company added.\n\ncaption The prototype of VoloPort\u2019s take-off and landing pad is located at the back of the platform, against the backdrop of Singapore\u2019s central business district. source Business Insider / Lamont Mark Smith\n\nIts check-in counter features a biometric identification system, which will use data collected from the VoloPort booking app to identify passengers.\n\ncaption Factors that make Singapore an ideal air taxi host include the small size of the country, which is perfect for the current range of air taxis, and Singaporeans\u2019 openness towards trying new technologies, Kysely said. source Business Insider / Lamont Mark Smith\n\nAll flights will be operated on the Volocopter 2x, which is an electric Verticle Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft.\n\nAccording to Volocopter, the aircraft meets the standards of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency\u2019s (EASA) international certification \u2013 which requires air taxis to be as safe as airliners.\n\nThough they look like helicopters, the vehicles are in fact built upon drone technology, the company said.\n\nTest flights are scheduled to take place on Tuesday (Oct 22), and are supported by the Ministry of Transport (MOT), Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), and the Economic Development Board (EDB).\n\ncaption Volocopter had previously collaborated with the Roads and Transport Authority of Dubai to conduct a public unmanned test flight in Dubai in September 2017. source Business Insider / Lamont Mark Smith\n\nThe two-seater will be manned by a certified air pilot when it first begins operations, but will eventually transition towards being driver-less.\n\nThe futuristic-looking aircraft specifically designed for flights within the confines of inner cities, and is able to sustain stable flight even in micro-turbulence around skyscrapers, the German manufacturer said.\n\ncaption It is also touted to be \u2018extremely quiet\u2019, says Volocopter.

operates on electricity, there\u2019s a charging station located in the vertiport to refuel its batteries.\n\nEach full charge is estimated to last 35 kilometres, and approximately 30 minutes of flight time, Volocopter said.\n\ncaption The battery life will easily accommodate all of the air taxi\u2019s routes, as its longest flight is expected to last about 20 minutes. source Business Insider

provided by Unifly that provides real-time air traffic data.\n\nKysely said that Singapore is a great starting point for air taxis as the Republic is like the \u201cfocal point of Asia\u201d.\n\nSingapore will provide the first major step to the commercialisation of air taxis. Other cities in the region \u2013 Jakarta, Manila or Bangkok \u2013 where there are traffic congestion issues could be next on the list, Kysely added.\n\nAccording to him, existing transport systems will be able to cope with the amount of air traffic for the next five to ten years. However, new air traffic management systems must be integrated gradually in the next \u201cfive to fifteen years\u201d, he added.\n\ncaption A projected Changi Airport to Marina Bay route. source Business Insider / Lamont Mark Smith\n\nRead Also:", "description": "Business Insider - MRT breakdown and traffic jam getting to you?
