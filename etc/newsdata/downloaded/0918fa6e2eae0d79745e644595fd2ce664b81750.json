(Netflix) defames and portrays the plaintiffs (Mossack and Fonseca) as ruthless uncaring lawyers who are involved in money laundering, tax evasion, bribes and/or other criminal conduct,\" according to a copy of the 42-page lawsuit seen by Reuters.\n\nThe suit was filed in U.S. federal court in Connecticut on Oct. 13. Netflix did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn the official trailer for \"The Laundromat,\" which co-stars Meryl Streep as a widow investigating insurance fraud, the following question is asked and answered in big, bold type: \"How do 15 million millionaires in 200 countries stay rich? With lawyers like these.\"\n\nThe trailer then cuts to the elegantly dressed lawyers played by Oldmann and Banderas laughing uproariously.\n\nMossack Fonseca shut down last year after being accused by U.S. prosecutors of helping clients conceal assets, investments and income from government tax authorities using a wide range of sham foundations and shell companies.\n\nWhile Mossack and Fonseca also did not respond to requests for comment, a source close to them told Reuters that both lawyers maintain their position that the massive leak of the firm's internal documents consisted of \"information theft or hacking\" that was illegal.
