Alarmed by what they see as an increasingly aggressive Russian foreign policy, they reject anything that might smack of appeasement.\n\n\"Are we to reward Russia because they have not done anything grotesque in the past few months?\" one EU diplomat asked.\n\nIn EU meetings, letters and speeches, divisions about Russia that were once under control are resurfacing, diplomats say.\n\nThe tension could make it harder for the EU to agree new sanctions if Russia intensifies what are often depicted by Western leaders as efforts by President Vladimir Putin to undermine Western institutions such as the 28-nation bloc.\n\nThe tension could also further divide the bloc - with a group of French-led, relatively Russia-friendly allies such as Italy on one side, and the Baltic states, Poland and Romania on the other. This in turn could weaken the resolve of Western-backed governments to stand up for Ukraine, diplomats said.\n\nEU diplomats still expect leaders of the bloc to extend sanctions on Russia's energy, financial and defense sectors for another six months at a regular summit in December.\n\nBut while Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel say there can be no sanctions relief until Russia implements a peace deal for Ukraine agreed in 2014-2015, both see sanctions as impeding better relations with Moscow.\n\n\n\n\n\nMACRON'S \"RESET\"\n\nThe measures, imposed over the annexation of Crimea and Russian support for the separatists fighting in Ukraine, require all EU governments to agree. Any friction could allow just one country, possibly Moscow's ally Hungary, to end them.\n\n\"The time has come for the German government to pressure the EU for a partial lifting of the sanctions,\" German lawmaker Peter Ramsauer, whose center-right Christian Social Union (CSU) is a member of Germany's ruling coalition, told Reuters.\n\nBaltic states, once part of the Soviet Union, fear a Russian trap to block Ukraine's ambition to join NATO and the EU. The country of 42 million has borders both with Russia and countries in the EU and NATO.\n\nWith Germany open to France taking a more active role on Russia, Macron unexpectedly relaunched a bid for better Russian ties in July.\n\nSending his defense and foreign ministers to Moscow in September and ending a four-year freeze on such high-level diplomatic visits, Macron is seeking to bring Moscow back into the fold of leading industrialised nations.\n\nMacron, who said in August that alienating Russia was \"a profound strategic mistake\", wants Moscow's help to solve the world's most intractable crises, from Syria to North Korea.\n\n\"The geography, history and culture of Russia are fundamentally European,\" Macron said on Tuesday in a speech to the Council of Europe, the continent's main human rights forum, from which Russia was suspended after Crimea.\n\nRussia's readmission in July, for which France and Germany lobbied, was the first time that an international sanction imposed for Moscow's seizure of Crimea has been reversed.\n\nCharles Michel, Belgium's prime minister, told EU diplomats last month that while Russia was a security threat, it \"remains a neighbor too and we must deal with this reality.\"\n\nIn a letter to EU diplomats last month, the EU's ambassador to Moscow also called for a \"pragmatic\" approach to Russia.\n\n\n\n\n\nREWARD OR REVENGE?\n\nEU diplomats from eastern, Baltic and Nordic nations have said they are confused by Macron's approach, questioning what has changed in Russia to merit a renaissance in relations.", "description": "French and German attempts to end the conflict in east Ukraine risk increasing tensions that were already rising in the European Union over how to handle Russia and which could complicate peace efforts.", "authors": ["Robin Emmott", "John Irish", "Andreas Rinke"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.16ERSh6uRn9ajiFOqvV9g--~B/aD0zMDA7dz00NDk7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/reuters.com/9a60be8868490912356fa8f1e0b6c134", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
