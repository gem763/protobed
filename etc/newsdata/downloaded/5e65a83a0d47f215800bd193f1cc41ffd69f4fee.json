In Washington\u2019s 24-3 loss to the New York Giants, the Redskins benched Case Keenum for rookie Dwayne Haskins.\n\nDespite the move, Gruden declined to name Haskins the full-time starter moving forward.\n\nInstead, Gruden said he wants to see how his quarterbacks respond in practice this week, adding he needs to get injury updates on Keenum and Colt McCoy before determining a starter.\n\nKeenum, who has been dealing with a foot injury, wore a walking boot for precautionary reasons after Sunday\u2019s loss, Gruden said. McCoy, on the other hand, is working his back from a leg injury, which kept him sidelined for a month-and-a-half before returning to practice last week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to let it play out because I need to see these guys perform,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cI don\u2019t need to make an announcement and then change my mind on Friday. \u2026 Hopefully, someone will take the job and run.\u201d\n\nIn any event, Haskins did not perform well enough to lock down the job. The 22-year-old threw three interceptions, one of which was returned for a touchdown, and went 9 of 17 for 107 yards. After reviewing the film, Gruden said the Redskins \u201cweren\u2019t on the same page\u201d when Haskins was in the game.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Haskins has been ruled out of starting against New England. But if he had performed better, Gruden likely would have given him a stronger vote of confidence. Gruden, too, has been clear Haskins needs further development \u2014 and wasn\u2019t planning on playing him until Keenum struggled for the second straight week.\n\nGruden, though, said he wouldn\u2019t hesitate in playing Haskins if he determined the rookie gave Washington the best chance to pull off the upset.\n\nThe Redskins opened as 15-point underdogs to the Patriots, and some had wondered if it would be a wiser decision to let Haskins sit. That way, the Ohio State\u2019s product first start wouldn\u2019t come against the defending Super Bowl champions, who also have given up just one defensive touchdown this season.\n\nRunning back Chris Thompson said Haskins would embrace the challenge, should he be given the start.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been in big games, although that\u2019s college, it\u2019s still a big game,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIf he\u2019s asked to be the guy, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be nervous or anything like that at all. \u2026 We know what\u2019s ahead of us. I think he\u2019d be excited for that opportunity to step up and play against Tom Brady. That\u2019s somebody he looks up to.\n\n\u201cI know it would mean everything for him to say \u2018Oh I beat Tom Brady in my first start.\u2019 But we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nMcCoy could be the most realistic option, granted he\u2019s healthy enough to play. The 32-year-old was a real threat in the Redskins\u2019 quarterback competition this summer before he re-aggravated his leg injury in August. McCoy felt discomfort when pushing off to throw, causing the Redskins to shut him down until recently.\n\nAsked about the possible upside of playing McCoy, Gruden pointed to the backup\u2019s experience. The two have been linked together for six years and Gruden has always been fond of McCoy.\n\nThe concern, however, will be if McCoy can stay upright. Last season, the oft-injured quarterback started only two games before he broke his leg on \u201cMonday Night Football\u201d in Philadelphia.\n\nMcCoy has started six games for Washington in six seasons, leading the Redskins to a 1-5 record.\n\n\u201cFrom an experience standpoint in this offense \u2026 it does help that when I call a play we\u2019ve been running for five or six years that you know where to look and what side of the field to read as opposed to seeing it for the first time, like Case and Dwayne,\u201d Gruden said.\n\nGruden said in addition to waiting for updates on Keenum and McCoy, he\u2019ll also talk to Haskins to evaluate his progress.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll make that determination (on the starter),\u201d Gruden said. \u201cI think it will depend on the decision I make and then how that person performs on Thursday and Friday.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
