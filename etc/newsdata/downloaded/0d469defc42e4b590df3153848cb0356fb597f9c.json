Photos: Kenneth Chan\n\nA little bit of luck \u2013 something that eluded him early in the season \u2013 helped hard-working jockey Ben So Tik-hung taste success at Happy Valley on Wednesday night.\n\nThe 32-year-old has found it hard to obtain opportunities this term amid the competitive Hong Kong jockey ranks but he made the most of his chance in the Class Three Hebe Hill Handicap (1,200m).\n\nSo showed what he\u2019s capable of, settling Jimmy Ting Koon-ho\u2019s Baby in the box-seat, before finding clear running early in the straight to run over the top of favourite Shining Ace while holding off the fast-finishing Lobo\u2019s Legend to prevail.\n\nAstonishingly, it was the first time this season So had been on a horse that started a single-figure price in betting. Baby was his 72nd ride.\n\nHis two earlier mounts on the night started at $152 (Green Generation) and $64 (Happy Win Win). Baby jumped at $9.50.\n\nWhile regarded as a terrific judge on the training track, So only get the scraps on race day but he was delighted to enjoy a rare moment in the sun.\n\n\u201cIt was a very good feeling crossing the line,\u201d a beaming So said after his first win since July 3.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been riding horses with good chances, but you still have to keep going. Luckily today I was able to get a winner.\n\n\u201cHopefully I can get a few more, I always try my best.\u201d\n\nSo is aware of where he stands in the pecking order and doesn\u2019t complain, instead continuing to work hard and do his job as best as possible.\n\nBen So grabs his first win this season as Baby wears down Shining Ace in the sixth event! #HappyWednesday #HKracing pic.twitter.com/KoJlODEZqm \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 30, 2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been frustrating. In the morning I ride six or seven horses in the morning, but Hong Kong is very complicated,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to get on horses with good chances, especially this season with Joao [Moreira] becoming a freelance jockey. He gets a lot of good rides.\n\n\u201cIn Hong Kong there are different steps. Joao and Zac get the best horses and then it goes down step-by-step. I\u2019m down the bottom and I don\u2019t get many chances.\u201d\n\nAs luck would have it, So only got a late call-up to partner Baby as his regular jockey Keith Yeung Ming-lun had already committed to Tang Fleming.\n\n\u201cHe rode another one and I got on because of the light weight,\u201d So said. \u201cNot many people can do that, so when Jimmy asked me, of course I said yes.\u201d\n\nTing was happy to give So his first winner of the term, while he was also thrilled with Baby\u2019s improvement after struggling through the first seven runs of his Hong Kong career.\n\n\u201cThe draw [barrier two] helped, he was able to get a good position,\u201d Ting said. \u201cI think 1,200m is a little bit short for him, but the barrier made the difference.\n\n\u201cLast season he was a bit disappointing. I thought he would win in Class Three straightaway. Maybe he just need a bit of time.\u201d\n\nAt the other end of the scale, reigning champion Zac Purton bounced back to form with a double, guiding Amazing Luck and Aurora Pegasus to victory.\n\nLike Baby, it was Amazing Luck\u2019s first win in Hong Kong, another who has taken a bit of time to acclimatise to his new home after going undefeated in two starts in New Zealand (when known as Jasd).\n\nBut a season under his belt, a drop in grade and a step up to 1,650m provided the right ingredients for him to show what he\u2019s capable of and trainer Paul O\u2019Sullivan hopes he can build on it.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s going to be competitive in Class Three when he goes back up,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said.\n\n\u201cHe seems to get around the track here pretty well and the step up to 1,650m was a positive.\n\n\u201cLast season, he was placed in three behind some one or two progressive horses so stepping up again to Class Three, he should be fine.\n\nHong Kong's champion jockey @zpurton combines with Paul O'Sullivan for the 4th time this season as Amazing Luck secures his first win! #HappyWednesday #HKracing pic.twitter.com/ByqcX16ohN \u2014 HKJC Racing (@HKJC_Racing) October 30, 2019\n\n\u201cHe was pretty nervous in all his races last season, he did a fair bit wrong but he seems to have found his niche here so we\u2019ll continue with it.\n\n\u201cHe was conceding a lot of weight to those horses and Zac said when he got to the front he pulled up and was waiting for them, so there might be a little more there.\u201d\n\nTrainer David Ferraris continued his good recent run as well, bookending the card with Young Glory (Grant van Niekerk) and Xiang Bai Qi (Umberto Rispoli).", "description": "A little bit of luck \u2013 something that eluded him early in the season \u2013 helped hard-working jockey Ben So Tik-hung taste success at Happy Valley on Wednesday night....", "authors": ["Tom Biddington", "Sam Agars"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/30/3f6e72d2-fb26-11e9-acf9-cafedce87d15_image_hires_232353.JPG?itok=j9ax9DfV&v=1572449043", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
