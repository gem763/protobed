Photo: Getty\n\nRonan Farrow\u2019s new book, Catch and Kill, uncovers new allegations regarding NBC News chief Andrew Lack, the man accused of mishandling sexual-harassment complaints at the company. Lack himself reportedly preyed on young female employees, two of which spoke to Farrow for Catch and Kill. Insiders told \u201cPage Six\u201d that the allegations in Farrow\u2019s book have NBC News execs, including Lack and president Noah Oppenheim, \u201cquivering in their suits.\u201d\n\nAccording to an excerpt obtained by \u201cPage Six,\u201d Jane Wallace was an anchor on NBC\u2019s West 57th show in the 1980s and Lack was her executive producer. She describes Lack, who was married at the time, as \u201calmost unrelenting\u201d in asking her out for dinner \u201cevery day for almost a month\u201d under the guise of celebrating her contract. \u201cIf your boss does that, what are you gonna say?\u201d Wallace said to Farrow. \u201cYou know if you say, \u2018I don\u2019t want to celebrate with you,\u2019 you\u2019re asking for trouble.\u201d Their sexual relationship was \u201cultimately consensual, but I didn\u2019t just get flirted with. I got worked over,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen their relationship came undone, Wallace remembers Lack threatening her career. \u201cAs she left the show, she recalled him yelling, \u2018You will never get credit,\u2019\u201d Farrow writes. \u201cThen the network deployed a tactic that the public was barely conscious of at the time: It offered her a substantial payout to sign a binding nondisclosure agreement.\u201d Once she left the company, Wallace felt \u201cdisgusted\u201d and said, \u201cIf [Lack] hadn\u2019t been like that, I would have kept that job.\u201d A source close to Lack told \u201cPage Six\u201d that Wallace\u2019s charges are \u201cdead wrong\u201d and that there was no \u201cretaliation.\u201d\n\nAnother young employee, Jennifer Laird, spoke to Farrow about what she called a \u201chostile\u201d relationship with Lack. \u201cWhen Laird asked to be reassigned, Lack wouldn\u2019t allow it,\u201d Farrow writes. \u201cHe compelled her to work longer hours, and on weekends, and proposed she cancel vacations.\u201d In the book, a rep denies that Lack retaliated in any way.\n\nThe NBC News chairman came under fire last year when it was revealed that he mishandled sexual-harassment complaints, including one about his former friend Matt Lauer, and one at his previous company, Sony BMG Music Entertainment. In Catch and Kill, Farrow also suggests that Lack was involved in killing Farrow\u2019s investigation into Harvey Weinstein. In a September 2017 phone call, Farrow reports, Lack told Weinstein\u2019s attorney, \u201cWe\u2019ve told Harvey we are not doing a story.\u201d A month later, Oppenheim had Farrow sign a statement saying his Weinstein story \u201cfailed to meet the network\u2019s standards.\u201d In an internal memo to staff obtained by People on Wednesday, Lack denied Farrow\u2019s claims that they tried to cover up the Weinstein story, calling the report \u201cfundamentally untrue.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter seven months, without one victim or witness on the record, he simply didn\u2019t have a story that met our standard for broadcast nor that of any major news organization,\u201d Lack wrote in the memo. \u201cNot willing to accept that standard and not wanting to get beaten by the New York Times, [Farrow] asked to take his story to an outlet he claimed was ready to publish right away.\u201d Farrow\u2019s producer for the segment, Rich McHugh, refutes this in a new Vanity Fair article. McHugh corroborates that NBC, specifically Lack, Oppenheim, and MSNBC president Phil Griffin, \u201cpersonally intervened to shut down our investigation of Weinstein,\u201d made \u201cat least 15 calls\u201d to Weinstein about the story, and \u201crefused to allow me to follow up on our work after Weinstein\u2019s history of sexual assault became front-page news,\u201d he wrote. He also includes statements from both former Weinstein Company employee Emily Nestor and Rose McGowan stating that they were willing to name Harvey Weinstein on air. (In a statement to Vanity Fair, NBC maintained that Nestor was \u201cunwilling to be outed.\u201d)\n\nIn the fall of 2017, NBC allowed Farrow to publish his investigation with The New Yorker five days after the New York Times broke the story. A rep for Farrow told People the claims made by NBC senior management are \u201csimply not true, as his book will methodically demonstrate.\u201d\n\nThis is a breaking news story and has been updated throughout.", "description": "Ronan Farrow\u2019s upcoming book, \u201cCatch and Kill,\u201d reveals details regarding NBC News chief Andy Lack\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct and his potential cover-up of the Weinstein allegations.", "authors": ["Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/11/11-ronan-farrow-andy-lack.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
