The biggest challenge might be Congress.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nNASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine at a White House celebration marking the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nHe\u2019s no longer in Congress, but Jim Bridenstine is in full campaign mode. On the road. Glad-handing. Posing for photos. He\u2019s got his stump speech down, a shiny new logo and the support of the White House.\n\nBridenstine, a Republican from Oklahoma who is now the NASA administrator, is seeking not support at the ballot box but votes in Congress for what could become one of the boldest human exploration endeavors NASA has undertaken in decades \u2014 the first return to the moon since the end of the Apollo era.\n\nEver since the White House dramatically accelerated NASA\u2019s lunar mission this spring, mandating the agency get people there by 2024 instead of 2028 as previously planned, Bridenstine has been under enormous pressure to meet a goal many think impossible. His orders are not only to deliver a long-shot moon-landing coup, but also to inject a heavy dose of Trumpian impatience into an agency the White House thinks has become too bureaucratic and risk averse.\n\nTo drum up support and the financial resources needed for what NASA calls its Artemis program, after the twin sister of Apollo, Bridenstine spent much of the summer touring the country in a 10-city swing like a one-man rock band.\n\nNow that Congress is back in session, Bridenstine has made repeated pilgrimages to Capitol Hill, where he\u2019s continued to sing his refrain to committee chairs and backbenchers alike, seeking votes for funding in every corridor for a program that would, as he repeatedly says, \u201csend the next man and the first woman to the surface of the moon.\u201d\n\nIn all, he\u2019s visited with 30 members of Congress or their staffs, selling Republicans and Democrats on the moon program and, perhaps more important, the additional $1.6 billion in funding the White House has asked for in next year\u2019s budget.\n\nIt\u2019s a small down payment for a program estimated to cost between $20 billion and $30 billion, and a crucial test for an administrator seeking to carry out the White House\u2019s wishes. If he can\u2019t get the initial $1.6 billion, well, as the space adage goes: no bucks, no Buck Rogers.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really selling, as he needs to,\u201d said John Logsdon, professor emeritus of George Washington University\u2019s Space Policy Institute. \u201cIf they can\u2019t get [the $1.6 billion,] they\u2019re not going anywhere by 2024.\u201d\n\n[Pence calls for NASA to send humans to the moon within five years]\n\nThe technical challenge of landing on the moon is hard enough. Recently, spacecraft from India and Israel tried and failed \u2014 and neither of them were carrying people. Given the enormous difficulties of landing softly on another celestial body, even Ken Bowersox, NASA\u2019s head of human exploration, recently told a congressional hearing that he was doubtful the agency could meet the 2024 deadline.\n\nWhile it is good to have \u201can aggressive goal,\u201d he said, he \u201cwouldn\u2019t bet my oldest child\u2019s upcoming birthday present or anything like that.\u201d\n\nBut Bridenstine knows that before NASA builds the rockets, spacecraft and lunar landers needed for the mission, the agency must clear the political roadblocks that are every bit as daunting as the vacuum of space. While members of Congress love to say they support NASA \u2014 as they do lowering crime or boosting national security \u2014 getting them to increase the agency\u2019s budget is another story. Traditionally, space does not equal votes in elections. And getting Democrats to support a project that, if successful, could be a legacy for the Trump administration is going to be a tough sell.\n\nThank you @RepCartwright for spending time with me today to discuss @NASA\u2019s #Artemis program. I\u2019m committed to working in a bipartisan manner to achieve the goals of Artemis. Thank you for your support! pic.twitter.com/EZYl0RVpXA \u2014 Jim Bridenstine (@JimBridenstine) September 11, 2019\n\nSome key lawmakers are already on record as skeptical of, if not hostile to, the proposal.\n\n\u201cThe President has decided to play politics with the Artemis program by seeking to speed up plans to send humans back to the moon in 2024 instead of 2028 without a strong justification for doing so,\u201d Rep. Jos\u00e9 E. Serrano (D-N.Y.), the chair of the House appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA, said in a statement.\n\nAt a recent congressional hearing about deep space exploration, Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Tex.), the chair of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, blasted the way the administration has rolled out the program.\n\n[For NASA contractors, lunar landing failures by Israel and India hit close to home]\n\n\u201cRhetoric about American leadership in space and advancing the role of women in spaceflight is all well and good,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it is not a substitute for a well-planned, well-managed, well-funded and well-executed exploration program. To date, Congress has not been given a credible basis for believing the president\u2019s moon program satisfied any of those criteria.\u201d\n\nBut like any good salesman, Bridenstine has pressed ahead, outwardly optimistic and undeterred, one congressional district at a time.\n\nIn August, he kept up a punishing travel schedule. On the 16th, he visited the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama with a trio of Republicans: Rep. Robert B. Aderholt (Ala.), Rep. Mo Brooks (Ala.) and Rep. Scott DesJarlais (Tenn.). On the 22nd, he was in Ohio with Rep. Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat, and Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican. On the 26th, he was at the NASA Ames Research Center in California with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Anna G. Eshoo, both Democrats. Two days later, it was the University of New Hampshire with Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D); then the University of Iowa with Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R) and Rep. David Loebsack (D).\n\nThe goal, Bridenstine said in an interview, is to \u201ceducate and, in some cases, even inspire the right actions that will enable us to get where we all desire to go.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s also to showcase how institutions in certain congressional districts are contributing to the program, which is something members of Congress can take credit for on the campaign trail. It\u2019s the moon as political currency, which Bridenstine, who served a little over two terms in Congress, knows as well as anyone.\n\nDuring his confirmation process, Bridenstine was criticized for being a politician instead of a scientist or engineer, as many NASA administrators had been.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s a university in their district,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s their industry that helps NASA. I think it really changes the dynamic to where they can see the direct impact to programs like this and how it affects their constituents and how it benefits the country as a whole.\u201d\n\nAlong the way, Bridenstine has helped forge some unlikely alliances.\n\nAt the Ames Research Center, he appeared to win Pelosi's endorsement. During a speech, she turned to Bridenstine and said, \u201cAs far as having a woman step foot on the moon, our hopes are riding on you.\u201d\n\nThat triggered a rare tweet of support for Pelosi from Vice President Pence, the chair of the National Space Council: \u201cGreat to see @SpeakerPelosi join us in supporting Artemis, which will land the first American woman on the Moon by 2024! Thank you @NASA for all of your hard work!\u201d\n\nBut Pelosi is not satisfied with the way the Trump administration has pursued the goal. \u201cOf course, the Speaker supports women having an equal opportunity to go to the moon and pioneer new frontiers,\u201d Drew Hammill, Pelosi\u2019s deputy chief of staff, said in an email. \"But NASA has failed to provide Congress with what we need to evaluate the Administration\u2019s proposal. Congress needs answers.\u201d\n\nGreat to see @SpeakerPelosi join us in supporting Artemis, which will land the first American woman on the Moon by 2024! Thank you @NASA for all of your hard work! https://t.co/GJGa1OGQTJ \u2014 Vice President Mike Pence (@VP) August 29, 2019\n\nIn a statement, Eshoo said that while she wanted more detail about the ultimate cost and timeline, she, too, was generally supportive.\n\n\u201cArtemis has the potential to captivate the country by landing the first woman on the Moon and develop the technology necessary to live and work on another world, and I\u2019m especially proud that the NASA Ames Center in my District will be integral to the mission\u2019s success,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken with Administrator Bridenstine about Artemis on several occasions, and I\u2019m optimistic we can land a woman on the Moon in a handful of years.\u201d\n\nHe also has a key ally in Rep. Kay Granger (Tex.), the ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee. She recently met with Bridenstine to discuss the program and said in an interview that the \u201cchances are good\u201d for getting the funding it needs. She\u2019s joining the administrator in selling the program to members of Congress, she said, because \u201cmany of them are just not aware of it.\u201d\n\nThrilled to give @RepKayGranger of Texas the very first #Artemis lapel pin! Rep. Granger is leading the effort to build bipartisan support for Artemis with women in Congress. pic.twitter.com/7ggjmvN8xb \u2014 Jim Bridenstine (@JimBridenstine) September 11, 2019\n\nStill, it\u2019s clear NASA and the White House have a lot of work to do \u2014 especially with giving Congress a detailed budget of what the entire program is going to cost.\n\n\u201cThe truth is, without a lot more detailed information, it would be difficult to support in absolute terms the administration\u2019s plans for Artemis,\u201d said Rep. Matthew Cartwright (D-Pa.), the vice chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA.\n\nEven supporters such as Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), a key member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said NASA has a ways to go to build up support.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve yet to see the numbers for a five-year plan,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cI want to be able to strongly make the case for acceleration for Artemis, for moving forward with landing a woman on the moon. But for me to convince my colleagues, I need information I don\u2019t yet have.\u201d", "description": "NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine has been lobbying hard for the Artemis program.", "authors": ["Christian Davenport", "Reporter Covering The Defense", "Space Industries", "September At Pm", "Christian Davenport Covers The Defense", "Space Industries For The Washington Post'S Financial Desk.
