In the near future, my baby will leave me to go to her father and start school in the UK.\n\n\"It will be a daunting trip for her travelling and me left behind.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n(Image: EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n\u201cAnd the authorities who hold me will watch on, unmoved at the injustice of separation.\"\n\nHer fight for freedom has seen her endure hunger strikes and solitary confinement amid a diplomatic row.\n\nHer family agreed that Gabriella should return to the UK to start the school year in September but postponed the decision after Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was taken to a psychiatric hospital.\n\nShe was returned to prison after a week but not permitted phone calls with her husband, Richard Ratcliffe.\n\n(Image: The Free Nazanin campaign)\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHe said his wife is hoping for a last minute release to enable her to come home with Gabriella. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s expecting it though,\u201d he said.\n\nHe added: \u201cGabriella has been a lifeline for Nazanin. That\u2019s the hardest part. It will feel like abandonment.\u201d\n\nGabriella has lived with her grandparents in Tehran since April 2016.\n\nIn a much-criticised error, PM Boris Johnson said in 2017 that she was in Iran \u201cteaching people journalism\u201d \u2013 despite her family saying she was visit relatives.", "description": "The British-Iranian mum has been visited in prison in the Iranian capital by Gabriella at least once a week for the past three years", "authors": ["Andy Lines", "Image", "The Free Nazanin Campaign Pa", "Getty", "Epa-Efe Rex", "The Free Nazanin Campaign", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article17478571.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Nazanin-Zaghari-Ratcliffe-with-her-daughter-Gabriella.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
