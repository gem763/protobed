That was too much.\n\nIn 2011, President Obama withdrew all troops which Vice President Biden claimed was \u201cone of the great achievements of this administration.\u201d That was too little.\n\nBut President Trump got it just right: Fewer than 1,000 special operators training, equipping, advising and providing air support to the Syrian Defense Forces, 60,000 tough fighters, mostly Kurdish but also including Christian Syrians, Arabs, and others who, like us, oppose jihadism.\n\nThanks to this sustainable investment, the SDF had been degrading the Islamic State, preventing the Islamic Republic of Iran from running roughshod across the region, holding Syrian dictator Bashar Assad in check, and making Russian President Vladimir Putin understand he could go only so far.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s decision to retreat from Syria has thrown all that away. His defenders say he is doing it for the troops, bringing them home where they\u2019ll be safe. But America\u2019s warriors volunteer not to be safe at home but to keep their fellow Americans safe at home by targeting our enemies wherever they live and plot.\n\nOur troops forged bonds with their allies in Syria. The last thing they wanted was to leave those allies and their families defenseless. Fox News\u2019 Jennifer Griffin spoke to one such warrior soon after he was ordered to abandon his comrades-in-arms. \u201cI am ashamed for the first time in my career,\u201d he told her. She added: \u201cThis US Special Forces soldier wanted me to know: \u2018The Kurds are sticking by us. No other partner I have ever dealt with would stand by us.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Kurds have long been America\u2019s best friends within what is now called the Muslim World. A proud and ancient nation with no state of their own, they have nevertheless managed to survive, and they have no wish to be gobbled up by a new anti-Western, Islamic empire \u2014 the goal of both Sunni salafi/jihadis and Iran\u2019s Khomeinist/Shia rulers.\n\nApparently Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t get this. Neither does Sen. Rand Paul who seems to have Mr. Trump\u2019s ear. The only reason Americans are in Syria, Mr. Paul asserted last week, is because of \u201cthe bloodlust of the neocons\u201d which, he added for good measure, \u201cknows no bounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe need an end to endless war,\u201d Mr. Paul has said repeatedly. Senator, I feel your pain, but the reason we have an \u201cendless war\u201d is because we have enemies who are patient and determined, and encouraged by the knowledge that Americans like you are neither.\n\nThese enemies regard themselves as men of faith, divinely ordained to defeat all infidels everywhere, heirs to Caliph Umar who conquered Jerusalem in 637, to Saladin who defeated the Crusaders in 1187, to Sultan Mehmed who occupied the Christian capital of Constantinople in 1453.\n\nThat the \u201cendless war\u201d we\u2019re fighting is already more than a thousand years old is not an opinion. It\u2019s the conviction of our enemies. Refuse to process that reality and progress is unlikely.\n\nDan Crenshaw, a former Navy SEAL officer now serving in Congress, noted that the \u201cgreat irony\u201d of the \u201cendless wars\u201d argument \u201cis that removing our small and cost-effective force from Northern Syria is causing more war, not less.\u201d\n\nWhatever might be said about Donald Trump, I figured him for a guy who could smell a con a mile away. But he seems to have succumbed to the charms of Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The Turkish president is an Islamist, Muslim Brotherhood supporter and neo-Ottoman posing as an ally. He has shown little interest in suppressing the Islamic State (indeed, IS terrorists were operating from Turkish territory as recently as last year) and he has conspired with Iran\u2019s rulers against America on multiple occasions.\n\nHe also has brutally repressed the large Kurdish minority in Turkey. Yes, some Kurds have responded with terrorism. But the Kurds in Syria posed no threat to Turkey as long as they were under America\u2019s wing. Indeed, America\u2019s influence, sustained over the long term, can be transformational. Japan, Germany and South Korea are examples.\n\nOne more thing: If President Trump considered it essential to withdraw from Syria, he could have instructed his new National Security Advisor, Robert O\u2019Brien, his new Defense Secretary, Mark Esper, and his even-keeled Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, to hammer out a plan to leverage America\u2019s military power to protect American interests; accommodate legitimate Turkish security concerns (negotiations were well underway to create a \u201csafe zone\u201d along the Syrian border); prevent the escape of thousands of Islamic State prisoners from Kurdish-guarded camps; and not betray America\u2019s friends, leaving them to Mr. Erdogan\u2019s tender mercies.\n\nIn other words, he could have cut a good deal \u2014 for America, his re-election campaign, and those who have trusted us. If America is to be great again, America will need trusting partners to help fight a war that can end one of two ways \u2014 with us giving up, or with us making clear that defeating America is neither realistic nor divinely ordained.\n\n\u2022 Clifford D.
