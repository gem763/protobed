Instead, companies appear to be confronting the lack of low-cost workers by investing in software and machines that can perform tasks ranging from human resources management to filling prescriptions. \u2026 Those investments are helping keep wage growth in line despite historically-low unemployment. Average hourly earnings were unchanged in October despite the unemployment rate falling to 3.5% from 3.7%, while the annual increase in wages fell slightly to 2.9%.\n\nThe evidence for the good news comes from the quarterly briefings which executives hold with Wall Street\u2019s investment advisors, says Reuters:\n\nOverall, companies have discussed automation on quarterly earnings calls more than 1,110 times since the beginning of the year, a 15% increase from this time last year and nearly double the mentions by this time in October, 2016, according to Refinitiv data. Corporate orders of robotics alone rose 7.2% over the first half of this year compared with 2018, totaling $869 million in spending, according to the Association for Advancing Automation.\n\nIn part, the productivity gains are intended to help employers avoid a bidding war for workers that would drive up salaries and also cut the profits sought by shareholders. But the investment options create wealth for investors and workers, so also expanding the nation\u2019s economic growth.\n\nAdvocates for reduced immigration have long predicted this trifecta goal of rising wages, profits, and productivity.\n\nHowever, most business groups prefer to maximize wealth for shareholders by simply adding migrant workers so they can cut wages and investment spending.\n\nMigration above all: Reuters writes a sympathetic article about oil-business executives demanding more migrant labor. Basically, Reuters is urging wage cuts for blue-collar American families so that migrants can get more US jobs. https://t.co/52QBEgJvnl \u2014 Neil Munro (@NeilMunroDC) October 15, 2019\n\nBut a shortage of immigrants is best for the long-term growth of employees\u2019 personal wealth, partly because it forces employers to push for productivity increases.\n\nTrump has ensured a shortage of workers by repeatedly rejecting demands from business groups for more unskilled and more skilled workers. So Trump\u2019s \u201cHire American\u201d policy is forcing companies to hire Americans \u2014 and also to give them better tools in kitchens, warehouses, factories, and office parks.\n\nEconomists have worried about the slowing annual growth in productivity since the early 2000s. They are often reluctant to blame the extra labor-supply caused by migration, even as they create new jargon to hide the impact of lower-skilled immigrants. For example, a March 2017 report by McKinsey admitted \u201ca shift in the composition of employment in the economy toward lower-productivity sectors\u201d contributes to the problem, but then quickly changed the subject.\n\nBut economists are becoming optimistic recent productivity gains may become a multi-year trend.", "description": "Companies are boosting their employees' productivity with better technology, says a Reuters survey of company reports.", "authors": ["Neil Munro"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/10/Now-Hiring-Getty-Images.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
