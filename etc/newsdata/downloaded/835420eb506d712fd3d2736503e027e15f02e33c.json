The benchmark S&P 500 index ended Friday with its second weekly gain, while the Nasdaq rose for a third straight week.\n\nShares of Boeing Co shed 3.1%, extending losses from the previous session, as multiple brokerages downgraded the stock following reports that call into question the timing of the 737 MAX jet's return to service.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 52.03 points, or 0.19%, at 26,822.23, the S&P 500 was up 18.70 points, or 0.63%, at 3,004.90 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 73.06 points, or 0.90%, at 8,162.61.\n\nThe earnings line up for this week includes high-profile companies such as Boeing, Microsoft Corp, Procter & Gamble Co, United Parcel Service Inc and Caterpillar Inc.\n\nAnalysts have projected the first earnings contraction since 2016 for S&P 500 companies, but of the 75 companies that have reported results so far, only 12% have come in below estimates, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nHalliburton Co gained 7.8% after the oilfield services provider detailed plans of further cost reductions.\n\nCoty Inc surged 14.1% after the cosmetics maker said it was planning to sell its professional beauty business that houses brands such as Wella and OPI.\n\nCardinal Health Inc, McKesson Corp and AmerisourceBergen Corp led declines on the benchmark index.\n\nThe drug distributors, along with Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, reached a settlement with two Ohio counties related to the opioid crisis.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.43-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and by a 2.62-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.\n\nThe S&P index recorded 38 new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 85 new highs and 49 new lows.
