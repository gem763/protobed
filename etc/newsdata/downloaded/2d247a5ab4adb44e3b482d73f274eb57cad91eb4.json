(Joe Robbins/Getty Images)\n\nThe mysterious saga surrounding prized Alabama defensive tackle Antonio Alfano may be coming to an end soon, as the 2019 No. 5 overall recruit\u2019s father announced on Twitter that his son entered the transfer portal on Thursday.\n\nThis does not mean that Alfano will necessarily depart Tuscaloosa, but it would likely allow him to play in 2020 without sitting out a year if he did transfer.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAlfano was expected to immediately contribute as a freshman after enrolling early in January and racking up two sacks in their spring game. However, he may not play a single regular season game at Alabama at all.\n\nSaban: \u2018He kinda disappeared for a little bit\u2019\n\nAlfano\u2019s role with the program has been murky since at least August, when he missed the Crimson Tide's first three preseason practices for what Saban deemed \u201cpersonal reasons.\u201d Alfano's father tweeted on Friday that Antonio\u2019s grandmother is ill.\n\n\u201cAntonio\u2019s grandmother recently fell very ill and is still fighting on life support,\u201d Frankie Alfano said. \u201cHe is very close with her. Since this illness took effect, Antonio has taken it very hard. He has not attended classes and practices.\u201d\n\nWhile that may well be part of the reason for Alfano\u2019s absence, head coach Nick Saban was a bit more cryptic in Wednesday\u2019s press conference. He revealed that Alfano sat out Saturday\u2019s game for disciplinary reasons and alluded to mistakes the 19-year-old had made.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s kind of disappeared a little bit,\u201d Saban said. \u201cI talked to our team today about the fact that \u2014 people make mistakes. We all make mistakes. I make mistakes, probably everybody in this room makes mistakes. We make mistakes as parents. We make mistakes as coaches. We make mistakes in just about everything that we do.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cBut I think you compound the problem when you don\u2019t confront the mistakes that you make and you create greater consequences for yourself because of the choices and decisions that you make after you make a mistake. And so hopefully this will be a learning experience for all the guys in our team.\u201d\n\nSlow start to Alabama\u2019s 2019 recruiting class\n\nAlfano was the top defensive lineman in the 2019 class, but Alabama is also waiting for a contribution from its other prized freshman: No. 3 overall recruit Trey Sanders.\n\nThe running back out of IMG Academy is out indefinitely with a foot injury that may cost him the entire season. Alabama should still be happy with former No. 1 overall recruit Najee Harris and four-star back Brian Robinson Jr. splitting carries, but developing Sanders would have been a plus.\n\nPotentially losing both of their top recruits would be a major blow to most programs, but it shouldn\u2019t greatly change Alabama\u2019s outlook this season. Alabama visits South Carolina at 3:30 p.m. ET on Saturday and will face its first ranked team on Oct. 12 at No. 16 Texas A&M.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Days earlier, Alabama head coach Nick Saban said that Alfano \u201ckind of disappeared a little bit.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hr1RPU8kxsn.Xo4F7NE_XQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NDIuNjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2Ng--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XyXwmLpsPTPfpf6zX0w23g--~B/aD0xMDcwO3c9MTYyNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/fde87580-d701-11e9-bff8-95ea260e565c", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
