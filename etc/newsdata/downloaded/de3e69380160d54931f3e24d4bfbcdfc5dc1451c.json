Johnson denies any wrongdoing.\n\nBut the U.K. Prime Minister has been dogged by claims and reports about his private life throughout his career as a journalist and as politician. Here\u2019s what to know:\n\nWhat are the groping allegations against Boris Johnson?\n\nEdwardes accused Johnson of groping her leg during an event at the offices of The Spectator, a British magazine the future Prime Minister edited between 1999 and 2005. Johnson has denied the claims. The allegations were made by Edwardes, 45, in a Sunday Times article on Sept. 29.\n\nShe wrote: \u201cI\u2019m seated on Johnson\u2019s right; on his left is a young woman I know. More wine is poured; more wine is drunk. Under the table I feel Johnson\u2019s hand on my thigh. He gives it a squeeze. His hand is high up my leg and he has enough inner flesh beneath his fingers to make me sit suddenly upright.\u201d\n\nAfter confiding in the young woman on Johnson\u2019s left, the guest tells her \u201cOh god, he did exactly the same to me,\u201d Edwardes claimed.\n\nResponding to the allegations on the first day of the Conservative Party conference, Johnson\u2019s spokesperson said: \u201cThis allegation is untrue.\u201d Edwardes responded in a Tweet: \u201cIf the prime minister doesn\u2019t recollect the incident then clearly I have a better memory than he does.\u201d\n\nOutside the conference, Carrie Symonds, Boris Johnson\u2019s current partner, declined to answer TIME\u2019s questions about the groping allegations.\n\nAt least one of Johnsons\u2019s own cabinet colleagues believes the allegations have some substance. Health Secretary Matt Hancock came to Edwardes\u2019 support, saying she was \u201ctrustworthy.\u201d Amber Rudd, the former Work and Pensions Secretary, said she agreed with Hancock.\n\nWhat are the allegations against Boris Johnson relating to Jennifer Arcuri?\n\nJennifer Arcuri meets Boris Johnson as part of Innotechsummit.com Google Hangout at Excel World Islamic Economic Forum, London, UK - 30 Oct 2013. Boris Johnson was the Mayor of London at the time. Vicki Couchman \u2014 Shutterstock\n\nAn investigation by The Sunday Times revealed that Arcuri, a U.S. entrepreneur who has described Johnson as her \u201cbest friend\u201d, was given a total of \u00a3126,000 in public money and attended three official overseas trade missions led by Boris Johnson whilst he was the Mayor of London. Johnson has since been referred to the U.K. police watchdog by the Greater London Authority monitoring officer Emma Strain, who oversees the conduct of the mayor and other members.\n\nOn Sept. 29, sources \u2013 including a New York Times journalist \u2013 told the Sunday Times that Jennifer Arcuri confided in friends that she was engaged in a sexual affair with Boris Johnson during his time as Mayor of London. David Enrich, the financial editor of the New York Times, told the Sunday Times that he was told of an alleged relationship between Johnson and Arcuri by two of Arcuri\u2019s friends when he was working for another newspaper. A friend of Arcuri told The Sunday Times that Johnson was a regular visitor of Arcuri\u2019s flat in East London.\n\nJennifer Arcuri did not respond to a request to comment by The Sunday Times in relation to her relationship with Johnson, but did issue a short statement on Sept. 27. It read: \u201cAny grants received by my companies and any trade mission I joined were purely in respect to my role as a legitimate businesswoman. I am incredibly disappointed that The Sunday Times cannot write about a successful female entrepreneur without smearing her with innuendo based on leaks from City Hall.\u201d\n\nDuring his time as Mayor of London, Jennifer Arcuri\u2019s company, Innotech, received two sponsorship grants totaling \u00a311,500 from London & Partners, the organization that Johnson was responsible for at the time.\n\nArcuri also attended three overseas trade missions led by Johnson to Singapore and Malaysia, New York and Tel Aviv, despite her businesses not meeting the eligibility criteria for the trips. Johnson\u2019s team overruled the decisions made by officials to not include her on the official visits to New York and Tel Aviv.\n\nAs Mayor, Johnson was bound by the Greater London Authority\u2019s code of conduct, which stated that he must \u201cdeclare any private interests relating to their public duties and to take steps to resolve and conflicts arising in a way that protects the public interest.\u201d\n\nHow has Johnson responded?\n\nBoris Johnson has refused to answer questions about his relationship with Jennifer Arcuri, but he has denied any impropriety. On Sept. 29, the P.M. said that there was \u201cno interest to declare\u201d regarding their relationship.\n\nHe told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show: \u201cEverything was done in accordance with the code, and everything was done with full propriety. There was no interest to declare. Let\u2019s be absolutely clear, I am very, very proud of everything that we did and certainly everything that I did as mayor of London.\u201d\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe U.K. Prime Minister was referred to the UK\u2019s police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct, on Sept. 20, to assess whether Johnson should be investigated for criminal charges relating to misconduct in public office. This follows the allegations by The Sunday Times of a potential conflict of interest with regard to his relationship with Jennifer Arcuri during his time as London Mayor.\n\nWhat other controversies has Johnson faced?\n\nJohnson\u2019s colorful private life has been heavily scrutinized over the years. He wed his first wife, Allegra Mostyn-Owen, in 1987 but they divorced in 1993. During his first marriage, Johnson was having an affair with Marina Wheeler. Wheeler was heavily pregnant by Johnson by the time Johnson\u2019s divorce was finalized with Mostyn-Owen in 1993. The Mail reported \u201cthey married 12 days later\u201d and went on to have four children together.\n\nIn 2004, Johnson was forced to leave his post as shadow Arts Minister for lying to Conservative Party Leader Michael Howard about a four-year-long marital affair with journalist Petronella Wyatt. He called claims about the affair an \u201cinverted pyramid of piffle,\u201d before Wyatt\u2019s mother confirmed it.\n\nThen, in 2010, reports emerged that Johnson had fathered a child with Helen Macintyre, an arts consultant. The reports only came to light after Macintyre lost a three-year legal battle to stop the media from naming Johnson as the father of the child. Johnson and Marina Wheeler eventually separated in 2018 and he later began a relationship with current partner, Carrie Symonds.\n\nEarlier this year, on June. 21, neighbours called police to the home of Boris Johnson and his partner, Carrie Symonds, after they heard screaming, shouting and banging. A neighbour alleged that they heard Symonds telling Johnson to \u201cget off me\u201d and \u201cget out of my flat\u201d. Johnson told the BBC that it was \u201csimply unfair\u201d to \u201cdrag\u201d his loved ones into politics. Symonds has not commented on their argument.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Boris Johnson faces allegations of groping journalist Charlotte Edwardes and having an improper relationship with Jennifer Arcuri.
