There was also a lot of buying or perceived value, as participants are hoping for laggards to outperform.\n\nProfessional money mangers are really in a pickle and while good old-fashioned window dressing might fool some folks, they need to go against the grain to explain performance. They could blame trade wars and mean tweets, but their investors can\u2019t retire on those kinds of lame excuses.\n\nS&P 500 Index +0.41% Communication Services (XLC) +0.78% Consumer Discretionary (XLY) -0.12% Consumer Staples (XLP) -0.59% Energy (XLE) +0.81% Financials (XLF) +0.49% Health Care (XLV) +0.11% Industrials (XLI) +0.63% Materials (XLB) +1.09% Real Estate (XLRE) -1.23% Technology (XLK) +1.21% Utilities (XLU) -1.02%\n\nStocks to Watch\n\nTiffany & Co (TIF) confirms it has received an unsolicited, non-binding proposal from LMVH Moet Hennessy \u2013 Louis Vuitton to acquire Tiffany for $120 per share in cash (closed on Friday at 98.55)\n\nNote: stock is indicating at $128, suggesting a higher bid or bidding war. The most important from this news is that this reflects the strength of the American consumer, which Tiffany has missed with old designs and selling techniques.\n\nThe United States continues to mint millionaires at a blistering pace. The fact of the matter is demand for LV products, which is being driven by pop culture.\n\nInvesting Lessons\n\nFollow Volume\n\nIgnore the Experts\n\nSomeone knew an offer was coming. On Friday shares of TIF traded 3.7 million shares almost double the average daily volume. I haven\u2019t seen news telegraphed like this in a long time. 90% of all news is leaked ahead of time in my opinion, but there are smarter ways for insiders to take advantage than blatantly buying stocks.\n\nBig Money Managers Caught Flatfooted as Money Manager Survey Showed enormous bearishness on October 15.\n\nToday\u2019s Session\n\nMicrosoft is higher on a huge Department of Defense contract.\n\nPresident Trump echoes reports out of China\u2019s media that suggest Phase One is just about done and will certainly be ready for the APAC meeting next month.", "description": "Although major indices came up short on hitting new record .10/28/2019 20:15:57PM EST.", "authors": ["Charles Payne", "Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien", "Julio Rosas", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/302/05fcdb00-2dfe-41ba-8059-1cce0d0b74f9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
