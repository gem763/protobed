Well, if you\u2019re a Democrat and among a majority in your party who wanted to see impeachment, you\u2019re excited about the prospect, and perhaps relieved that the process seems to be headed toward an actual vote in the House. But for the more progressive wing of the Democratic Party, a mere inquiry doesn't go far enough.\n\nAmerica\u2019s attitude toward impeachment is changing. Unlike what we saw during the Mueller investigation, voters seem to care.\n\nIf the polls are to be believed, American\u2019s views on impeachment are evolving. As of late September, Americans were split over the Democratic move to open an impeachment inquiry. According to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, 49 percent approved while 46 percent did not. According to that poll, independents were certainly not on board. But according to that same poll, seven in 10 said they were paying attention to the news.\n\nLARRY ELDER: IMPEACHMENT IS JUST THE LATEST DEMOCRATIC ATTEMPT TO TAKE OUT TRUMP\n\nIn July, it was only 37 percent that supported opening an impeachment inquiry.\n\nNow, a new Washington Post-Schar School poll shows the tide of public opinion shifting yet again, and in favor of Pelosi. The polling showed Americans, by a margin of 58 to 38 percent, feel House Democrats are right to open an impeachment inquiry. Of those, 43 percent were strongly in favor.\n\nSo what changed?\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIt seems the transcript of the president\u2019s phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a game-changer. In that same Washington Post-Schar School poll, 62 percent stated it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d for Trump to ask Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, while 43 percent said it was \u201cvery inappropriate.\u201d\n\nWe also see that many believe that Trump withheld military aid ahead of requesting the investigation of the Bidens: 38 percent said it \u201cmattered a great deal\u201d and 20 percent said it mattered \"a good amount.\"\n\nBut what is very telling in these most recent poll numbers, is that almost three in ten Republicans said they supported beginning an impeachment inquiry, compared to 86 percent of Democrats and 57 percent of independents.\n\nTwo-thirds of Americans think the president\u2019s phone call with the president of Ukraine was inappropriate. And three in five Americans say the president doesn\u2019t uphold adequate standards for ethics in government.\n\nThe numbers indicate more Americans supporting an impeachment inquiry. They are bothered by the president\u2019s phone call with the Ukrainian president, and they feel he withheld aid before requesting information on the Bidens.\n\nWhat the polling shows is that American voters are increasingly interested in the impeachment inquiry. Nearly half also feel the House should vote to remove the president from office. These numbers greatly favor Democrats in the impeachment dispute.\n\nBut there is some bad news for Democrats, too. The polling also indicates that approximately half of respondents feel Democrats are distracting Congress from more important issues. Especially with respect to Trump's decision to pull troops out of northern Syria, thereby throwing the Kurds under the bus, many feel impeachment is distracting from more serious issues.\n\nBut if we look outside the polls and at Democrats in Congress, especially in the House, support for impeachment has also grown. At least 90 Democrats announced their support for impeachment after the details of the president\u2019s call to the Ukrainian president came to light.\n\nSo maybe Pelosi knows what she\u2019s doing. She wanted a smoking gun, bipartisan support and did not want to divide the nation by going forward with a formal vote for impeachment.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nPelosi is right to open an inquiry while taking a slower pace. Who knows? Ukraine might just be the smoking gun she needed.\n\nPolling indicates the country is becoming less divided over the issue, as the speaker wanted. And, as Pelosi herself has said: \"Donald, you used to own a casino \u2014 you know the house always wins.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY LESLIE MARSHALL", "description": "Pelosi wanted a smoking gun and bipartisan support before moving forward with a vote on impeachment, and she just may get her way.", "authors": ["Leslie Marshall", "Leslie Marshall Joined Fox News Channel As A Contributor In", "Providing Analysis On Both Political", "Social Issues A Liberal Point Of View.
