In fact, the expressly stated goal of the policy is to maintain and, if possible, increase the Afrikaans offering, subject to demand and resources.\u201d\n\nThe policy adopts a preference for English in certain circumstances in order to advance the university\u2019s goals of equal access, multilingualism, integration, and preserving Afrikaans, the judge pointed out.\n\nALSO READ: Fewer lectures offered in Afrikaans, Stellenbosch University language policy case hears\n\nHe said that the university was accused of cynically \u201cexploiting\u201d or \u201ccapitalising\u201d on the bilingualism of Afrikaans students to reduce Afrikaans tuition.\n\n\u201cIt is true that SU justifies the 2016 policy on the basis that Afrikaans students are universally bilingual whereas the majority of black (African) students are not. The reality is that Afrikaans students will suffer less harm being required to learn in English than English students will incur if they have to learn in Afrikaans. If SU did not take account of the aforegoing, it would have acted irrationally,\u201d he said.\n\nJudge Dloldo also referred to the argument that the policy violated students\u2019 Constitutional rights to basic education because it excluded access to the university for those who speak Afrikaans.\n\nAfrikaans speakers who cannot obtain Afrikaans tuition at the university will not study there and, if they cannot study in Afrikaans elsewhere, they will forego tertiary education altogether, the applicants argued.\n\nREAD: Everyone wins with new language policy \u2013 Stellenbosch University\n\nHowever, Judge Dloldo said that he failed to comprehend that argument.\n\n\u201cThe point is, in terms of the 2016 policy, first-year students can learn entirely in Afrikaans. In later years, Afrikaans is used as much as students\u2019 needs demand, within SU\u2019s resources,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said that the applicants did not persuade the court that the policy was unconstitutional in any way and dismissed the application with costs.\n\nJudge Kate Savage agreed.", "description": "Two Western Cape High Court judges have dismissed an application for the review and setting aside of a Stellenbosch University policy that abandons Afrikaans as a primary language of instruction.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4647/e7fd3f2611a74e5abfd59c1e54ca253b.jpg", "published_at": "2017-10-27"}
