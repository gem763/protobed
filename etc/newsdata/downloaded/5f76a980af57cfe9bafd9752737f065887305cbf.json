I'm gonna stand four feet from a f--king rapist and no one's gonna say anything?\"\n\nWeinstein remained blank-faced, according to TMZ, and event organizers and someone from Weinstein's group immediately escorted Stuckless out of the bar.\n\nLet me explain that one more time, an event that was supposed to support actors and artists invited a serial rapist who has ruined at least 87 actors lives and supported that monster over an actor in the room. They supported HIM over all the actors in the room.\n\n\u2014 clever, but make it spooky (@ambercrollo) October 24, 2019\n\nAfter Stuckless was removed from the event, Bachman separately approached Weinstein's table, calling him a \"monster\" and saying he should leave. In response, \"his friend / bodyguard / goon / family member called me a c-nt,\" she tweeted.\n\nPhotos from inside the bar show Weinstein seated at a table between two unidentified women.\n\n\"Let me explain that one more time, an event that was supposed to support actors and artists invited a serial rapist who has ruined at least 87 actors' lives and supported that monster over an actor in the room,\" Bachman wrote. \"They supported HIM over all the actors in the room.\"\n\nPHOTOS: Some of the women who have accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault\n\nA rep for Weinstein told TMZ: \"Harvey Weinstein was out with friends enjoying the music and trying to find some solace in his life that has been turned upside down. This scene was uncalled for, downright rude and an example of how due process today is being squashed by the public, trying to take it away in the courtroom too.\"\n\nDozens of women across the film industry have accused Weinstein, formerly a major Hollywood producer, of crimes including rape, sexual assault and sexual abuse over a 30-year period. He was arrested in May 2018 and his trial is scheduled for January 2020.\n\nThe trial will take place in Manhattan, despite Weinstein's efforts to have it held elsewhere.", "description": "'Nobody's gonna say anything?
