The latest victim is Peloton Interactive Inc (NASDAQ: ), lovingly known as a screen on a bike from those on the short side (borrowed from the camera on a stick schtick that was the GoPro IPO). It can\u2019t even hold its IPO price on the opening day, and was down about 8% from its IPO price in early trading. So long to another Unicorn.\n\nWhen not providing wand material and life saving blood to Dark Lords, \u201cunicorns,\u201d as they\u2019re known in the venture capital space, refer to startup companies who have valuations over $1 billion. Their goal from there, it seems these days, is to get to the public markets as soon as possible and cash in on the high valuations \u2013 selling stakes to every day investors. Problem is, this IPO business can be quite tricky for investors getting in after the company goes public. Sure, it\u2019s worked splendidly for the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Netflix (NASDAQ: ) and some others. But for every one of those, there\u2019s a GoPro, WebVan, or Pets.com for those of you old enough to remember.\n\nHere\u2019s how the stars of the 2019 class have done thus far from their opening price on the first day of trading. And that\u2019s not even including WeWork and their inability to even get to the IPO, after losing about $30 billion in pre-IPO value thanks in no small part to the musings of Scot Galloway.\n\nHere\u2019s the full list of Unicorn companies if you want to bet who ends up next on the ugly duckling list. And of course, here\u2019s our infographic looking at some of the most high profile IPOs of the past 20 years:", "description": "Shares Analysis by Jeff Malec covering: Amazon.com Inc, Netflix Inc, Peloton Interactive Inc.
