News organizations moved right along, focusing on Ukraine, Syria and other political matters, while Trump\u2019s approval rating barely budged. That\u2019s because the president has a way of making any story seem like it\u2019s something we already knew about him. Nothing feels revelatory, or like a shock to the public consciousness.\n\nBut this is not Trump\u2019s genius at work \u2014 it\u2019s a function of our own cognitive biases. We measure people against what we perceive to be their baseline behavior. If, as evidenced by his history, we believe that Trump is a bad-faith actor with no moral compass (a belief that even some Republicans have expressed), malfeasance is to be expected. We react little to behaviors that in absolute terms are horrifying but that conform to the norm. We\u2019re moved only by deviations from our expectations.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo it would be less surprising if a notorious criminal were guilty of a number of crimes than if an upstanding citizen were guilty of a misdemeanor: Each has set a standard of behavior against which their subsequent actions are measured. In Trump\u2019s case, he stiffed contractors and drove his own business into bankruptcy six times; lenders stopped loaning him money. He has treated women horribly, with some of that behavior documented by women he\u2019s been horrible to, including his ex-wife Ivana, who claimed in a deposition that he raped her. (Trump denies this, and she later said that she did not want her words to be taken in \u201ca literal or criminal\u201d sense.) Before he ever ran for president, Trump had a long history of lying on the record about his business success, his personal life, his intelligence and the time of day (according to an acquaintance). Even his persona on \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d was cutthroat, selfish and oblivious to the needs of others. The consistent through-line: Trump views ethics as dispensable features of the middle and lower classes, who have to consider the lives of other people because they lack the power or money that enables contemptuous disregard.\n\nIn 2016, it seemed that it might behoove Trump to clean up that image as he went on the campaign trail. Yet when asked about his taxes, he admitted he didn\u2019t pay them, which supposedly made him \u201csmart.\u201d And when an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d video featuring him bragging about sexual assault became public, he displayed no embarrassment or remorse beyond a pro forma statement: \u201cI apologize if anyone was offended,\u201d he said, while in the same breath dismissing his comments as \u201clocker room banter.\u201d Polling showed that the tape\u2019s revelations did not change people\u2019s opinions of Trump: Both before and after its release, 59 percent of the public said they thought that Trump did not respect women, according to HuffPost. Today, after scandals such as the payoffs to Stormy Daniels, and after E. Jean Carroll\u2019s essay alleging that Trump raped her, that figure has somehow fallen to 51 percent. In 2016, 44 percent of Americans said that if the allegations of sexual assault were true, they should disqualify Trump from the presidency; today, only 40 percent would consider them disqualifying.\n\nYears into his presidency, why would anyone be jolted by additional women coming forward, or by the growing paper trail pointing to financial malfeasance? He has long since admitted to both, in public. Trump has made being openly terrible an asset, at least in terms of weathering blowback from additional misdeeds. When Politico/Morning Consult asked voters in May their opinions of Trump as a businessman, after a New York Times report that he had lost more than $1 billion in the 1980s and 1990s, they were evenly split: Forty-three percent said he\u2019d succeeded in business, and 41 percent said he\u2019d been unsuccessful.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe baseline effect is so strong that when Trump does minor things that you\u2019d expect any decent human being to do, like expressing sympathy for hurricane victims and not immediately smearing an alleged sexual assault victim as a liar, the public applauds him. People see a deviation from his normal behavior and take it as a vast improvement, declaring that he seems more \u201cpresidential.\u201d This defines \u201cpresidential\u201d downward to about the altitude of Dante\u2019s eighth circle of hell (which is where fraudsters go).\n\nIt also explains why scandals from people who produce fewer of them are blown out of proportion. When Hillary Clinton uses a private server for government business, she has to weather endless investigations, but when senior White House advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner do it, Democrats shrug because they\u2019re unsurprised, and Republicans attribute it to all manner of good-faith negligence (they\u2019re naive; they mean well; how can they be expected to know these things?). Conservatives accuse Joe Biden of allowing his son to grift his way through Ukraine as a beneficiary of nepotism, while Trump installs his daughter in the White House in an official capacity and his sons gleefully utilize the presidency to enhance the Trump Organization, all while pocketing millions of dollars from his golf courses.\n\nIn my day job, we create messaging for political candidates and conduct polls. Over and over, messages about Trump\u2019s corruption land with a thud. The reality is that voters have a hard time buying the idea that such misconduct affects them in any way at all. They might think it\u2019s unfair, but they also overwhelmingly think everything that happens in Washington is corrupt, and that all elites in politics and business are corrupted on some level. They view Trump as a data point on a continuum of corruption, not as an outlier. (Here the baseline is defined by perceptions of elites as a class: selfish cheaters who deceive nonelites all the time to get what they want.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat appears to be changing incrementally with the impeachment inquiry. So many of Trump\u2019s recent misdeeds are wholly unprecedented \u2014 including soliciting help from foreign adversaries in damaging his political enemies, openly, publicly and live on television. It\u2019s hard not to notice them. A civic education process has begun: If most Americans didn\u2019t know that it\u2019s illegal to solicit foreign interference in an election, because the issue hadn\u2019t come up in their lifetimes, they\u2019re learning that now. We\u2019re primed as humans to register danger in terms of severity, magnitude and immediacy of threat, and Trump\u2019s impeachable offenses affect the whole country. The potential removal of a president has profound implications for all Americans.\n\nIn this case, it\u2019s important \u2014 for ourselves as individuals and for the sake of our democracy \u2014 to rethink our baseline expectations. Do we want a Trump presidency that is, to invoke a metaphor from the president\u2019s favorite and most expensive hobby, par for the course? Or do we want occupants of the Oval Office to respect its gravity, and to understand that they are public servants who exist to serve the office and not the other way around? Our expectations for Trump may be reasonable in the context of his historical behavior, but we cannot conflate our baseline for Trump with our baseline for the American presidency. They are not the same.\n\nTwitter: @espiers\n\nAD", "description": "The president never bothered to clean up his image.
