Since then, he has become the Pirates\u2019 full-time closer and been named an All-Star in 2018 and 2019.\n\nAfter the charges were announced MLB put V\u00e1zquez on administrative leave.\n\n\u201cToday we were made aware of an active law enforcement investigation involving Felipe V\u00e1zquez and his subsequent arrest. We take this matter, and these charges in particular, extremely seriously,\u201d Pirates President Frank Coonelly said in a statement. \u201cWe need to be respectful to all involved and the ongoing legal proceeding. As a result, the organization, our staff and players cannot comment any further at this time.\u201d", "description": "The lefty pitcher allegedly sent a 15-year-old girl video of himself performing a sex act.", "authors": ["Andrew Kirell", "Senior Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1678,w_2984,x_12,y_131/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568739444/RTS2Q8IO_ogxcmj", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
