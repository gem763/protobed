(Eric Christian Smith/Associated Press)\n\nNow that the Packers-Bears appetizer has been devoured and digested and the Antonio Brown situation has been resolved, the NFL schedule can begin for real. It\u2019s tough to know which lucky few teams will be playoff-bound when Week 17 arrives in late December, but Week 1 offers something for everyone, with none of that pesky irrelevance of preseason.\n\nWe\u2019ll get to see rookie quarterback Kyler Murray in Kliff Kingsbury\u2019s Arizona Cardinals offense, the Cleveland Browns\u2019 new combo of Baker Mayfield and Odell Beckham Jr., Ezekiel Elliott\u2019s return to the Cowboys after a long holdout, the Pittsburgh Steelers after Antonio Brown\u2019s departure and the ageless wonder that is Tom Brady, who will soon be throwing to Brown in a pairing so crazy it might work.\n\n[The Antonio Brown saga, explained]\n\nSix of the NFL\u2019s new head coaches start the season at home (including Bruce Arians in Tampa), with only poor Zac Taylor and the Cincinnati Bengals facing the prospect of having to play on the road \u2014 in, of all the daunting places, Seattle\u2019s CenturyLink Field.\n\nThe first Sunday also features some tantalizing division games right out of the gate, including the Washington Redskins at the Philadelphia Eagles, the New York Giants at the Dallas Cowboys and the Buffalo Bills at the New York Jets.\n\nGet yer popcorn.\n\nAll times Eastern.\n\nTime Game TV 1 Rams at Panthers Fox 1 Redskins at Eagles Fox 1 Bills at Jets CBS 1 Falcons at Vikings Fox 1 Ravens at Dolphins CBS 1 Chiefs at Jaguars CBS 1 Titans at Browns CBS 4:05 Colts at Chargers CBS 4:05 Bengals at Seahawks CBS 4:25 49ers at Buccaneers Fox 4:25 Giants at Cowboys Fox 4:25 Lions at Cardinals Fox 8:20 Steelers at Patriots NBC\n\nThe early shift\n\nRams at Panthers, 1, Fox\n\nAmong the first seven games of the day, pay particular attention to the Rams\u2019 first test since losing to the Patriots in the Super Bowl. L.A. quarterback Jared Goff has a huge new contract extension and the Rams will try to put the disappointment of their 13-3 Super Bowl loss to rest. On a more granular level, the game offers a chance to assess the physical conditions of Todd Gurley Jr. and Cam Newton.\n\nRedskins at Eagles, 1, Fox\n\nCase Keenum starts for the Redskins (and Jordan Reed is out), but when will the clamor for rookie Dwayne Haskins begin?\n\nBills at Jets, 1, CBS\n\nSay hello to the Jets\u2019 new running back, Le\u2019Veon Bell, whose legs should be fresh from an entire season off.\n\nFalcons at Vikings, 1, Fox\n\nKirk Cousins advocated for Josh Doctson in Minnesota, and the Vikings brought in the Washington castoff.

So the Patriots settled for \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d and, in the Pittsburgh Steelers, they drew an opponent that hasn\u2019t won in Gillette Stadium since 2008, when Brady was out with a knee injury. The Steelers are trying an \u201caddition by subtraction\u201d theme with the departures of Brown and Bell.\n\nRead more NFL coverage from The Post:\n\nNFL expert Super Bowl picks\n\nThe Steelers are less talented than a year ago.
