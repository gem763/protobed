If this project gets funded, we plan to align AOC's figure with the Sunrise Movement\u2014a grassroots organization that works alongside the real AOC, championing the Green New Deal.\u201d\n\nThe time is now! ?? Our @AOC Kickstarter campaign is officially live: Click below to preorder your very own little hero (@realDonaldTrump we think this would make a great Christmas gift for your grandkids ??). #AOC #AOCActionFigure #Kickstarter https://t.co/pnC2u9Xeny \u2014 FCTRY (@fctry) October 15, 2019\n\nPerusing FCTRY\u2019s current catalog of \u201cReal Life Action Figures\u201d reveals figurines based on people including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA), Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden, Robert Mueller, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Billie Jean King, Pope Francis, and notably, a Trump figure that shows him holding up his middle finger.\n\nIn a 2017 post on Medium Jason Feinberg said that the company would start giving all profits from the Trump figurine to the ACLU: \u201cSo, as of today, we are giving 100% of the profits from our Trump Action Figures to ACLU. And for as long as we keep selling these Action Figures, we will keep on taking ALL of the profits and funneling them into the organizations and causes that are working to hinder the darkest parts of Trump\u2019s agenda.\u201d\n\nSome people on Twitter commented on the news of the forthcoming AOC figurine:\n\nWill the new @AOC action figure cost $50-$90 trillion? Does it come with no carbon footprint? Did it miss out on the prosperity of other generations of action figures? Does it require a $300 haircut? https://t.co/IA8jUON4L4 \u2014 Scott Walker (@ScottWalker) October 15, 2019\n\nCan I buy these in bulk?
