It becomes mandatory from 2027 for states with large aviation industries.\n\nThe United States has voluntarily joined CORSIA, despite withdrawing from the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.\n\nIn 2018, China was no longer listed as a participant in the first phase, raising concern that the world\u2019s fastest-growing aviation country isn\u2019t part of the deal.\n\nHOW MUCH WILL IT COST?\n\nAccording to ICAO data, the deal is expected to cost airlines between $5.3 billion and $23.9 billion, depending on the future price of units in the carbon market.\n\nAirlines largely support CORSIA to avoid countries creating their own regional schemes. But some European countries, where there is a growing backlash against air travel spurred by a Swedish-born boycott called \u201cflight shame\u201d, are already considering a separate aviation carbon tax.\n\nSome environmentalists say they would support CORSIA as long as it includes safeguards to ensure, for example, that airlines can only buy emission credits from credible projects. But most are calling for ICAO to set separate long-term targets for reducing emissions, which are not specified in CORSIA.\n\nAVIATION\u2019S ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT\n\nCommercial flying currently accounts for about 2% of global carbon emissions and about 12% of transport emissions, according to data cited by the Air Transport Action Group (ATAG).\n\nAirplane traces are pictured in a blue sky, in Caen, France, August 30, 2019. REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol/Files\n\nBy 2020, emissions from global international aviation are projected to be about 70% higher than in 2005 due to rising travel demand. Passenger numbers are forecast to double to 8.2 billion between 2017 and 2037, according to IATA.\n\nStudies, including reports by the International Council of Clean Transportation (ICCT), have shown planes are less energy efficient on short trips than buses or trains.\n\nAccording to the European Commission, a return flight between London and New York generates roughly the same level of emissions as heating a European home for a whole year.", "description": "International airlines are counting on a global carbon offsetting plan to cap CO2 emissions from air travel at 2020 levels, mitigating the environmental impact of flying even as passenger traffic is forecast to grow.", "authors": ["Allison Lampert", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433343028&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N15B", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
