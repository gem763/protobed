Franklin explains capturing the iconic photo 'Raising the Flag at Ground Zero.' | Photos by John Wheeler, Thomas E. Franklin Behind the lens on Sept. 11\n\nOn the evening of Sept. 11, Thomas E. Franklin, shaken from a day of photographing the World Trade Center attacks and trying to get back to New Jersey to finish his job, didn\u2019t know he was carrying a piece of history in his digital camera.\n\nFor the veteran photographer, the photo that would become \u201cRaising the Flag at Ground Zero\u201d and get short-listed for the Pulitzer Prize was one of more than a thousand he took \u2014 all important, all capturing a snippet of time.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nA photographer and videographer for the northern New Jersey newspaper The Record, Franklin was preparing for a meeting in his office in Hackensack, N.J., when a colleague told him about the first plane.\n\n\u201cI ran over to the window. I had a clear view across Jersey. I could see a huge gaping hole in the tower. I immediately took off for the city, but the tunnels and bridges were closed,\u201d Franklin explained to POLITICO.\n\nHaving photographed the towers from New Jersey before, he headed to the riverfront in Jersey City.\n\nBoats were going back and forth between New Jersey and Manhattan, and a triage center had been set up where Franklin was taking photos. He went back to the office to download photos and returned to Jersey City under the assumption that photographers had been asked to leave. \u201cBecause I had left, I was able to blend in with the crowd. I saw a photographer friend [John Wheeler] who said, \u2018I know the head of the Jersey police department, let\u2019s see if he can help us get on a boat,\u2019\u201d recalled Franklin.\n\nThe officer helped the two men get a ride over on a tugboat. \u201cI never got his name,\u201d said the photographer, \u201cbut it was a pivotal moment. I got the access I needed. A lot of the day is a blur, but being on the boat, I remember preparing myself for what I was going to see and had to remind myself that I had to focus on the job.\u201d\n\nIn the late afternoon, after a day photographing the tragedy, Franklin said search and rescue had come to a halt: \u201cThey anticipated tower 7 was going to collapse. Fire and rescue gathered at a first aid center. I was like, \u2018I need to go back,\u2019 and that\u2019s when I saw the three firemen; they were fumbling with the flag. It was shot at a distance, and it just happened.\u201d\n\nBut did he know that he had just taken an iconic photo?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the million-dollar question,\u201d Franklin said. \u201cI just spoke at a Bergen County 9/11 ceremony and that\u2019s how I started the talk. This picture did not stand out to me. Three men raising a flag paled in comparison to thousands of people dying and two buildings falling to the ground. I can\u2019t even say this is the best picture I ever took. It is the photo with the most meaning.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor a brief moment, the similarity to [Joe] Rosenthal\u2019s picture [\u201cRaising the Flag on Iwo Jima\u201d] flashed through my mind and I recognized the symbolism,\u201d said Franklin, who recalled the feeling but described working with \u201cno concept of time that day.\u201d\n\nAfter his photo was used for The Record and put on The Associated Press wire shortly after midnight, the picture, he said, \u201ctook on a life of its own.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe picture and the level of attention it got, for a while was unprecedented,\u201d he said. \u201cI still don\u2019t lose focus on the fact that thousands of innocent people died. That was a murder scene, and people died in the most horrific way.\u201d\n\nThe man who captured a moment of hope in a time of horror will spend the 10-year anniversary of Sept. 11 covering the ceremony at ground zero. \u201cFor journalists who were working that day, I think this is a tough time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut all anniversaries are as important, and people need to remember what happened that day. I don\u2019t want people to forget.\u201d\n\nSee also, Franklin's \"Witness to History\" site.\n\n", "description": "Thomas E.
