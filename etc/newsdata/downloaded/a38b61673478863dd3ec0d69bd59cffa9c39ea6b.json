We are the public broadcaster. \u2026 I think it's important to hold me to account,\" she said.\n\n\"That said, I really don't have a horse in the race. I don't have a partisan bone in my body. It's not the way I was raised; it's not who I am.\"\n\nFurther to her point, Barton disclosed that she doesn't feel comfortable choosing sides, even in the privacy of a voting booth.\n\n\"I actually cancelled my ballot,\" she said.\n\nI have been in rooms where I was the only female journalist. ... Know that you deserve to be there, and then show everybody why you do. - Rosemary Barton\n\n\"It just makes me feel more comfortable when I'm doing my job to know, in the back of my head, that I haven't made a choice for anybody.\"\n\nHowever, Barton explained, the act of voting is \"very important\" so she still submitted a ballot, despite not selecting a party or candidate.\n\nBarton joined host Duncan McCue in the Cross Country Checkup studio to answer calls and social media questions from listeners. (Emilie Quesnel/CBC)\n\nThe upcoming Canadian federal election, she continued, is going to be a tight race and voting matters.\n\n\"It's going to be \u2014 not to sound clich\u00e9 \u2014 but an election for the ages. It's going to be very tight. It's going to determine a lot of people's fates.\"\n\nOn how women can make their voices heard in politics\n\nFrom fighting to have her questions heard during scrums to grilling prime ministers and state secretaries, Barton said you sometimes have to be pushy and stubborn to get the answers you're looking for.\n\n\"I learned how to make myself present in a scrum. \u2026 I wanted to be there. I wanted to prove myself. I wanted to get answers for people. I felt that that was my job; I still do,\" she said.\n\nOttawa listener Genevieve Gallant called to ask for advice on how young women who want to \"step up\" can make their voices heard in the world of public policy.\n\nThroughout her career, Barton has interviewed a range of political and public policy figures, including Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. (Evan Mitsui/CBC)\n\n\"Fake it 'til you make it!\" Barton said.\n\n\"I have been in rooms where I was the only female journalist, or in scrums where there weren't many of us. Sometimes you have to speak a little louder. But I do think that things are changing and I hope you feel that too,\" she explained.\n\n\"Know that you deserve to be there, and then show everybody why you do.\"\n\nOn her love of flashy footwear\n\nBetween her posts of on-the-job selfies and promoting new content, Barton's Instagram is awash with shoe pictures.\n\nOne listener, Ian MacIntyre in Winnipeg, took note of this and asked about it.\n\n\"Everybody's got something,\" she responded.\n\n\"They're fun and you can wear different colours and you can see them on TV and you can show your personality and still be a, you know, sort of square news anchor if you need to be.\"\n\nBarton characterized the number of pairs of shoes she owns as \"embarrassing,\" and that she could never pick a favourite.", "description": "Rosemary Barton, co-host of CBC News' The National as well as the new CBC election podcast Party Lines, took your calls in the first edition of Cross Country Checkup's new recurring Ask Me Anything segment.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.1927851.1567985375!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/rosemary-barton.jpg"}
