(Oct. 8) AP Domestic\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump's pick for a federal appeals court seat broke down in an emotional exchange during his confirmation hearing Wednesday, addressing concerns that he would be unfair to LGBT people.\n\n\"It is a fundamental belief of mine that all people are created in the image of God, and they should all be treated with dignity and respect,\" Lawrence VanDyke said through tears at his hearing.\n\nVanDyke, a nominee for the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, was responding to a question from Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Missouri, about a report from the the American Bar Association.\n\nThe ABA's Federal Judiciary Committee voted that VanDyke was \"not qualified\" for the position, citing concerns that he \"lacks humility\" and \"does not have an open mind.\"\n\n\"Mr. VanDyke\u2019s accomplishments are offset by the assessments of interviewees that Mr. VanDyke is arrogant, lazy, an ideologue, and lacking in knowledge of the day-to-day practice including procedural rules,\" an ABA letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee reads.\n\nVanDyke works in the Department of Justice's Environment and Natural Resources Division. He also served as solicitor general in Nevada and Montana.\n\nMore: Trump's conservative judges begin takeover of federal appeals courts\n\nThe letter says that some of the individuals interviewed in its review, who had worked with VanDyke in the past, raised the concern that he might not be fair to members of the LGBTQ community.\n\n\"Mr. VanDyke would not say affirmatively that he would be fair to any litigant before him, notably members of the LGBTQ community,\" the letter says of an interview conducted with VanDyke.\n\n\"It is a fundamental belief of mine that all people are created in the image of God, and they should all be treated with dignity and respect.\"\n\n\n\nWATCH: Judicial nominee Lawrence VanDyke breaks down amid question about attitude towards LGBT people https://t.co/Ku7xoMuWtCpic.twitter.com/DnfXjfu1k1 \u2014 The Hill (@thehill) October 30, 2019\n\nHawley asked VanDyke, \"Did you say that you wouldn't be fair to members of the LGBT community?\"\n\n\"Senator, that was the part of the letter ...\" VanDyke began, trailing off as he began to cry. \"I did not say that.\"\n\nAfter a moment, VanDyke continued, \"No, I did not say that. I do not believe that.\" He said if confirmed, he would \"absolutely\" commit to treating every person in his court with dignity and respect.\n\nMore: Supreme Court is divided over gay, transgender job bias in civil rights case to be decided during 2020 election\n\nHawley called the contents of the letter \"outrageous allegations\" and \"hearsay.\"\n\nSen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, also blasted the ABA for its review as biased, and called for it to be considered a special interest group.\n\nThe letter \"would almost be humorous in an inflammatory way were it not so personal, were it not so unfounded,\" Lee said. \"The ABA has essentially called you a homophobic bigot... with no apparent basis.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/30/trump-nominee-vandyke-cries-hearing-aba-concerned-lgbtq-attitude/4102302002/", "description": "Lawrence VanDyke, a Trump nominee for a federal appeals court, was given a \"not qualified\" rating from the American Bar Association.", "authors": ["Jeanine Santucci", "Published P.M.
