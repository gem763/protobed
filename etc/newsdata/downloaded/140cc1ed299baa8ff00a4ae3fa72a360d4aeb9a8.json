They spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\nLate Monday, an influential group of freshmen Democrats who served in the military and national security before winning office said Trump's actions cut to the core of the country's defenses. Their views, as centrist lawmakers from previously Republican-held districts where Trump has been popular, hold sway with party leadership.\n\nAt issue is a summer phone call with Ukrainian President Voldymyr Zelenskiy, in which Trump is said to have pushed for investigations into Biden. In the days before that call, Trump ordered the aid to Ukraine frozen.\n\nTrump has insisted he did nothing wrong and has denied that any requests for help in procuring damaging information about Biden were tied to the aid freeze.\n\nThe United States began providing military aid to the government of Ukraine shortly after Russia illegally annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014. With Ukraine's new president still grappling with separatist rebels in the east, the aid has long been viewed as a measure of Washington's determination to push back against Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nDemocrats, and some Republicans, have urged the White House to be open about Trump's actions, which are at the center of a whistleblower complaint. But with no new information from the administration forthcoming, more than a dozen Democrats, including some in House leadership, added their names to those calling for impeachment proceedings.\n\nThe sudden rush of activity shows the extent to which Trump's call to the foreign leader, and his subsequent comments about the conversation, are raising further questions about whether the president improperly used his office to pressure another country as a way of helping his own reelection prospects.\n\n\"These allegations are stunning, both in the national security threat they pose and the potential corruption they represent,\" wrote the seven freshmen, who include a former Navy pilot, soldiers, officers and intelligence analysts.\n\n\"We do not arrive at this conclusion lightly,\" the lawmakers wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. The lawmakers include Reps. Gil Cisneros of California, Jason Crow of Colorado, Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, Elaine Luria of Virginia, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Elissa Slotkin of Michigan and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia.\n\n\"These new allegations are a threat to all we have sworn to protect. We must preserve the checks and balances envisioned by the Founders and restore the trust of the American people in our government. And that is what we intend to do.\"\n\nCongress on Monday pressed for full disclosure of a whistleblower's complaint about Trump and pushed the White House to release a transcript of Trump's call with the Ukraine president.\n\nThe president has acknowledged the phone call. On Monday, he said he didn't want to give money to Ukraine \u2014 if there were corruption issues.\n\n\"It's very important to talk about corruption,\" Trump told reporters as he opened meetings at the United Nations. \"If you don't talk about corruption, why would you give money to a country that you think is, is corrupt?\"\n\nLater Monday, Trump denied telling the Ukraine president that his country would only get U.S. aid if it investigated Biden's son. \"I didn't do it,\" he said.\n\nThe fresh calls for impeachment proceedings come as House Democrats are heading into a closed-door meeting Tuesday with Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\nPelosi and her leadership team on the various oversight committees are considering bringing forward a resolution that will put the House on the record on this matter, according to a Democratic leadership aide unauthorized to discuss the private talks. The aide was granted anonymity.\n\nStill, Democrats remained divided on moving forward with an effort to impeach Trump. Pelosi has resisted calls for impeachment and is sticking with her position that Congress must not start formal proceedings unless the American public demands it.", "description": "President Donald Trump ordered his staff to freeze nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine a few days before a phone call in which he pressured the Eastern European nation's leader to investigate the family of political rival Joe Biden, a revelation that comes as more Democrats move toward impeachment", "authors": ["Lisa Mascaro", "Mary Clare Jalonick", "Jonathan Lemire"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/oCmc104_dckyyOPxmylz9w--~B/aD0yODI3O3c9NDI0MTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/77def56486b75af3cce4570e79da9b1f", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
