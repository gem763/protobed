Fast-fashion giant Forever 21, which is reportedly considering filing for bankruptcy in the face of flagging sales, is now being sued by the pop star for at least $10 million over allegedly using her likeness without permission.\n\nThe New York Times reports that a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles\u2019s Federal District Court on Monday claims certain Forever 21 ads posted to the retail chain\u2019s Instagram bear a resemblance to Grande\u2019s \u201c7 rings\u201d music video (the one with the purple-lightning scheme, jewel-encrusted cat ears, and lip gloss). Court papers say a caption accompanying one of the posts is a riff on a lyric from \u201c7 Rings\u201d (\u201cGee thanks, just bought it\u201d) and that, in addition to similar styling, the ad employed a \u201clook-alike model,\u201d complete with Grande\u2019s signature high ponytail. The lawsuit contends that \u201cthe resemblance is uncanny and Forever 21\u2019s intent was clear: to suggest to the viewing public that Ms. Grande endorsed Forever 21, its products, and was affiliated with Forever 21.\u201d All this to sell a bizarre headband that looks like two fuzzy pink breasts sporting nipple jewelry.\n\nForever 21 also allegedly posted images directly from Grande\u2019s \u201cThank U, Next\u201d music video (and, speaking of there being no new ideas, that music video is basically a restaging of popular romantic comedies like Legally Blonde). According to the lawsuit, Forever 21 agreed under pressure from Grande\u2019s lawyers to remove the unauthorized images in February but displayed them on social media until mid-April nonetheless. Forever 21 also allegedly tried to partner with Grande, who ultimately refused over what she considered to be inadequate compensation, per the Times:\n\nAfter Grande released the hit song \u201cThank U, Next\u201d last November, Forever 21 reached out to her representatives to suggest an endorsement deal that would be centered on social media, the lawsuit said. Grande\u2019s representatives considered the deal but ultimately declined because the fashion retailer wasn\u2019t willing to pay Grande enough.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that the damages aren\u2019t unreasonable since a single Grande Instagram post is worth \u201cwell into the six figures.\u201d I don\u2019t mean to get all Illuminati about this shit, but the figure Grande has requested in fact has seven rings.", "description": "Ariana Grande is suing Forever 21 over allegedly using a \u201clook-alike model\u201d and ripping off her music video to sell headbands.", "authors": ["Hannah Gold"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/04/4-ariana-grande.w1200.h630.jpg"}
