You want him to change the mentality of pursuing instant results, to move away from the disastrous policy of buying \u201cexperience\u201d and \u201cnames\u201d, to focus on youth and the future. But you want that to happen overnight?!\n\nIf they\u2019re saying he\u2019ll get four transfer windows and some proper long-term signings, then that is far more sensible.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nYet Ole and me both, we\u2019ve been in football long enough to know the score.\n\nAs managers, we know it\u2019s all about results. I am desperate for him to do well (OK, not THAT well), to succeed and show the faith is justified.\n\nBut we all know you are judged completely and entirely on what happens on the pitch and, for all the suggestion he\u2019ll get several windows, he won\u2019t make the next one unless results pick up.\n\nUnfortunately, the real football world isn\u2019t like Championship Manager.\n\nThey can talk all they like about patience, building, etc, but, if he doesn\u2019t start winning in the next few weeks, then Manchester United are a club who demand things, and the demand will be for his head.", "description": "ROBBIE FOWLER: Backing Solskjaer is the right thing to do ahead of January transfer window", "authors": ["Robbie Fowler", "Image", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20566688.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_AZ-Alkmaar-v-Manchester-United-UEFA-Europa-League-Group-L-Cars-Jeans-Stadion.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
