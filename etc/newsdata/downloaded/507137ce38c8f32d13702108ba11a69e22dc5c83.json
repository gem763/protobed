Watch what happens when the occupant fights back.", "language": "en", "text": "The doors of the silver car \u2014 which was stolen \u2014 opened. Out came five masked men clutching handguns. A resident of the house, a 23-year-old student, was eating breakfast in the kitchen, according to Sao Paulo police, watching the security footage. The armed intruders were coming in through the garage. He put down his food, then rushed upstairs to his bedroom and retrieved his own handgun.\n\nAD\n\nThen, shirtless and in flip flops, he waited at the top of the stairs, gun at his side. He yelled at them to go away, but then a figure peeped around the corner. He fired once, twice, three times.\n\nAD\n\nDown below, the intruders lurched back in surprise. They briefly returned fire before falling down the steps. They scooted out through the garage \u2014 apparently in such a fright that they decided to abandon their car \u2014 and vamoosed down the street on foot as confused neighbors watched.\n\nNo one was wounded in the shootout, police said.\n\nIn a country traumatized by pervasive crime, where many live in fear of violence, video of the shootout was red meat for conservatives calling to liberalize gun ownership laws. In January, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who won the presidency last year with calls to get tough on crime, signed a decree making it easier for the \u201cgood guys\u201d to get guns. In May, he followed it up with another decree, easing restrictions on gun imports and ammunition purchases.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHow great that he was armed!\u201d one person cheered on Twitter.\n\nAD\n\nIn Sao Paulo, the Western Hemisphere\u2019s largest city, the wealthy have devised elaborate security systems to protect themselves from crime. Many wealthy people live behind tall concrete walls, guard towers, electrified wire, spotlights, double steel doors, and digital fingerprint analysis machines that decide who gets in and who doesn\u2019t.\n\nThen there\u2019s simple security footage \u2014 which was what saved the resident of the targeted Sao Paulo home.\n\n\u201cI was having breakfast and I was watching my camera monitors,\u201d the student said in an interview with Jovem Pan News, saying he preferred to stay anonymous for security reasons. \u201cThen I realized there was a car getting inside my home, and the alarm turned on. They got in really quickly. \u2026 I had to get my gun in my bedroom, and by that time, they were already in the stairs, ready to get me.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut they wouldn\u2019t. Neither that day, nor any in the future, he vowed.\n\n\u201cI think that those who need to be afraid are them,\u201d he told the Brazilian news outlet. \u201cThey better know that if they get in here again I\u2019ll do it again, cause I\u2019ll never allow them to do any harm to me or my family. They need to be afraid of us. It\u2019s not us that need to be afraid of them.\u201d\n\nPolice said they found one of the intruders\u2019 ID and a wallet.\n\nAD", "description": "The wealthy have devised elaborate security systems in Sao Paulo \u2014 but even that sometimes doesn't keep crime away.", "authors": ["Terrence Mccoy", "Reporter Covering Social Issues"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/t0I7x_RuWD5Mtk-iaJgB6cG_a-c=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DF2QSJHQHMI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
