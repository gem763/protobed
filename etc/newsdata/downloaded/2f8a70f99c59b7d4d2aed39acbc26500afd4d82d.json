I suffered two punctured lungs, broke a finger, both wrists, the head of my humerus and both shoulders.\n\n\"I also fractured all the bones in my neck, including a break to one, and had multiple fractures and breaks to every one of my ribs.\n\n\"I have had quite a few surgeries to sort all this and now have a large amount of metal in me. All of this will heal fully.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I also suffered a complete sever to my spinal cord at T9. This means that I am paralysed from my belly button downwards.\n\n(Image: Claire Danson/Instagram)\n\n\"This is of course not something that will heal.\n\n\"Whilst I still have hard moments, I have accepted the situation I am now in and won't be letting it stop me do anything that I want to [including triathlon!]\"\n\nShe added she was \"still exactly the same person\" and had decided to share her story as she \"would like you to follow me and I would like you to learn all about spinal injuries with me\".\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nEngland hockey star Alex Danson won Olympic gold with Great Britain at the 2016 Games in Rio.\n\nTalking about her sister, Alex Danson said: \"She's the most resilient, hard-working and inspiring person you will ever meet.\n\n\"Having already overcome many challenges in her life before, I know she will reign a champion of this one too.\"", "description": "Triathlete Danson was crowned European Champion in June - then two months later her life changed forever after a collision while riding her bike", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Claire Danson Instagram", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20662769.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Claire-Danson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
