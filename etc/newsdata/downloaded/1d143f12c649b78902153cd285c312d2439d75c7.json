Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nHasbro\u2019s foam-based weaponry toy brand Nerf launched the world\u2019s first Nerf Action Xperience Arena on Children\u2019s Day morning (Oct 4). The 18,000 square feet compound features four unique play zones that are beyond exhilarating to any Nerf fan \u2013 even adults.\n\nAccording to Nerf, the four zones, \u201cCompete\u201d, \u201cConquer\u201d, \u201cChallenge\u201d and \u201cCreate\u201d are designed to enhance skill sets, identify personal strengths, and build individual confidence.\n\nNerf added that all play zones have been jointly developed with international sports psychologists from the USA\u2019s Mental Toughness Research Institute (MTRI) to hone and support the development of confidence, resilience and problem-solving strategies.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s highly stressful and disruptive society, mental toughness is going to be an important psychological coping resource,\u201d said Edgar K. Tham, a sport and performance psychologist at the Mental Toughness Research Institute (MTRI).\n\nA two-hour adult ticket starts at S$26, and SS19 for children.\n\nCorporate passes are also available.\n\nThe sock labels signify that they are shoe-free zones and require you to wear Nerf\u2019s special grip socks. Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nThe place is surprisingly large, and there are lockers and rest areas situated along the hallway. There are also three \u201cparty rooms\u201d that you can book for up to 150 guests.\n\nThe compound has a daily capacity of over 1,000 visitors Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nHere\u2019s what it was like inside the arena:\n\nAs there were already other customers in the arena, I had to wait for my turn in the \u201cCompete\u201d zone. I decided to pay a visit to \u201cCreate\u201d first, where you get to create your own custom souvenir shirts and tote bags.\n\ncaption Pick up your choice of a plain white tee shirt or a tote bag here, as well as the stencils you want to use. source Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nThen, you can pick up one of the Nerf \u201cSuper Soakers\u201d, which are loaded with red or blue fabric dye, and start creating!\n\nOne thing to note is that the T-shirt sizes only come in small, medium or large. There\u2019s also no limitation to how much you want to paint your fabric, so go crazy!\n\ncaption A pair of children being taught by a NAX PRO, a staff member at the arena. source Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nThe aesthetic of the room is artsy, with colours of the rainbow strewn everywhere, like on these bins and barrels.\n\ncaption Everything was colourful and vibrant. source Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nEven the wash-basins are rainbow coloured, and are installed on top of barrels, which I found cute.\n\ncaption Wash your hands! source Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nSadly, I did not get to try painting my own souvenir as my turn in the \u201cCompete\u201d zone was finally here.\n\nThe \u201cCompete\u201d zone featured two activities \u2013 \u201cCapture the Flag\u201d and \u201cZombie City\u201d. Both are team-based games that pit two teams against each other in a race for points.\n\nAccording to Nerf, these team-based battlegrounds are dedicated to strengthening strategic thinking, teamwork and communication skills by working towards common goals. The teams are separated into the \u201cBlue Nation\u201d and \u201cOrange Nation\u201d.\n\ncaption Both activities have separate play areas. source Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nI checked out capture the flag first, and had a showdown with some of the Nerf Action Xperience (NAX) PROs. But first, I had to suit up with gear and listen to the safety briefing.\n\ncaption There were two types of guns to choose from, the smaller and easier-to-handle \u201cElite\u201d, and the intimidating two-handed \u201cSurgefire\u201d. source Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\n\u201cCapture the flag\u201d had a whole war zone-esque theme complete with makeshift barriers and bullets strewn across the floor. There was even a 10-second respawn system.\n\ncaption I used the \u201cElite\u201d gun in this match. Unfortunately, I was narrowly defeated. Two times. I blame the gun. source Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nAfter the game, there is an area to return your equipment. Business Insider understands that the equipment is wiped down every evening to keep it clean \u2013 or immediately if you have sweaty palms like me.\n\ncaption Looks pretty organised. source Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nEven though it was a 2v2, the game was still action-packed throughout and kept me on my toes. The makeshift barriers were sturdy and I was most impressed with the respawn system.\n\nLastly, there is also a referee on hand to make sure that the game remains fair. And if someone tries to respawn earlier, an alarm from the system will go off.\n\ncaption The six green lights at the back of each team is the respawn system, it turns red if someone is in the process of respawning. source Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nNext up was \u201cZombie City\u201d, which has interactive features throughout and an attached story-line and goal. Even the briefing segment was interactive.\n\ncaption By the way, the floor shakes violently when the plane \u201ccrashes\u201d. source Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\n\u201cZombie City\u201d has a much larger play area, and requires teams to shoot zombies to collect points, and find hidden missleheads in order to obtain \u201cvaccines\u201d for their nation.\n\ncaption I tried the \u201cSurgefire\u201d gun this time, which failed to shoot on multiple occasions. source Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nI let the reliable NAX PRO take a shot with the misslehead for a chance at a vaccine, since he was the one who found it anyway.\n\ncaption Well, what can I say. source Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nAt the end of it all, there is a scoreboard which displays a point recap for each nation.\n\nNerf explained that \u201cZombie City\u201d is a game designed with a duration of 5 minutes, for high-octane and action-packed intensity.\n\nHowever, what piqued my interest was the overall immersion of the play zone. The combination of the interactivity through motion sensors, and sounds of the game made it much more entertaining. Definitely something you would not want to miss when you are here.\n\ncaption Hey my points only look low because I was on a team of two. source Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nAt long last, I have arrived.\n\nThis zone is open for any participant aged above seven, and features the largest play area which boasted a time trial, two rock walls, a two-layer obstacle course, and a 4-metre slide. However, the slide was not ready for operation yet when I visited.\n\nAs the time trial was the closest one to me, I decided to try that one out first. It had a volcano theme and a camera that took a flash photo once I was near the end.\n\ncaption Make sure to remember to press the red button at the end! source Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nAfter I blazed through the volcano, I climbed up a few stairs to the main play area of \u201cConquer\u201d.\n\nThere were multiple NAX PRO staff stationed here to ensure safety, and an ample amount of harnesses and helmets available.\n\ncaption This photo was taken outside the outlet. source Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nBeing a thrill seeker myself, I decided that I wanted to take on the rope course, which is called \u201cThe Summit\u201d, right away. I got excited when I saw that it was not going to be a short obstacle course, and looked challenging enough.\n\nThis is me clearing the course smoothly (well, sort of), attracting much attention from the diners at the Putien restaurant that was located beside the course.\n\nYou have to keep the harness in front of you at all times, which proved to be quite tedious after awhile.\n\nA staff member told Business Insider that the most challenging part some children may face on the course is the fact that the harnesses are a little high.\n\ncaption One of the NAX PRO staff said I was fearless. source Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nI also gave the rock wall a shot. It had a auto-belay system that allowed me to descend the wall with ease.\n\nNamed \u201cThe Ice Cliff\u201d, the rocks on the wall were not very rough compared to other rock walls like the one in Kallang Wave Mall. However, they still have more than enough grip, and chalk is far from needed. There are also many rocks, making it suitable for kids as well.\n\ncaption I do have rock-climbing experience. Please be careful while on the wall! source Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nLastly, I checked out zone C, \u201cChallenge\u201d.\n\nThis exclusively-kids zone was designed with vibrant colours that is not too hard on the eyes.\n\nThe zone features a ball pit playground, a small race slope, a mini obstacle course and a mini rope course. It had a race-like theme, with finish lines at the end and small race cars for kids to sit on.\n\ncaption Fun fun fun. source Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nI managed to catch one of the children trying out the rope course, and it was adorable.\n\ncaption Look at that little champ\u2019 go! source Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nI was allowed to try out the kiddie obstacle course, which proved to be quite difficult, but it\u2019s probably because I was way too big for it.\n\nThe entire \u201cChallenge\u201d zone is a shoe-free zone, and had soft, padded flooring, so you do not have to worry if your child falls down. The toilet is also located right beside the zone and there are vending machines in the parents\u2019 lounge if you need refreshments.\n\ncaption Tires are officially my nemesis. source Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nThere\u2019s also a parents area for you to keep watch over your child as they play.\n\ncaption If you need refreshments, there\u2019s a snack vending machine as well, the closest drink machine is located near the entrance of \u201cVolcano\u201d. source Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nThere\u2019s a large variety of snacks to choose from too, starting from S$0.90.\n\ncaption Prices are pretty reasonable. source Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nPrices of drinks range from S$1.20 for a packet of orange juice to S$2.90 for a bottle of Cocomax.\n\ncaption The machine also displays the stock available for each drink. source Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nAll in all, the new Nerf Action Xperience Arena was a boat load of fun, and I would definitely recommend going there if you are a thrill seeker or you just want to have some fun. It\u2019s also the perfect place to bring your kids to, as it builds a myriad of different skills.\n\nHere\u2019s a picture of me posing with the \u201cSurgefire\u201d. I had a blast, pun intended.\n\ncaption Definitely bringing some of my friends back here. source Business Insider/Lamont Mark Smith\n\nRead Also:", "description": "Business Insider - Nerf's new playground is 18,000 square feet big, and the only one in the world..
