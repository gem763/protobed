(NASDAQ:SMBC) A Great Dividend Stock?", "language": "en", "text": "Today we'll take a closer look at Southern Missouri Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMBC) from a dividend investor's perspective. Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. Yet sometimes, investors buy a stock for its dividend and lose money because the share price falls by more than they earned in dividend payments.\n\nWhile Southern Missouri Bancorp's 1.7% dividend yield is not the highest, we think its lengthy payment history is quite interesting. Before you buy any stock for its dividend however, you should always remember Warren Buffett's two rules: 1) Don't lose money, and 2) Remember rule #1. We'll run through some checks below to help with this.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nNasdaqGM:SMBC Historical Dividend Yield, October 9th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are usually paid out of company earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 17% of Southern Missouri Bancorp's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. With a low payout ratio, it looks like the dividend is comprehensively covered by earnings.\n\nRemember, you can always get a snapshot of Southern Missouri Bancorp's latest financial position, by checking our visualisation of its financial health.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. For the purpose of this article, we only scrutinise the last decade of Southern Missouri Bancorp's dividend payments. The dividend has been stable over the past 10 years, which is great. We think this could suggest some resilience to the business and its dividends. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was US$0.24 in 2009, compared to US$0.60 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 9.6% per year over this time.\n\nBusinesses that can grow their dividends at a decent rate and maintain a stable payout can generate substantial wealth for shareholders over the long term.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nDividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. Strong earnings per share (EPS) growth might encourage our interest in the company despite fluctuating dividends, which is why it's great to see Southern Missouri Bancorp has grown its earnings per share at 16% per annum over the past five years. Rapid earnings growth and a low payout ratio suggests this company has been effectively reinvesting in its business. Should that continue, this company could have a bright future.\n\nConclusion\n\nDividend investors should always want to know if a) a company's dividends are affordable, b) if there is a track record of consistent payments, and c) if the dividend is capable of growing. Firstly, we like that Southern Missouri Bancorp has a low and conservative payout ratio. We like that it has been delivering solid improvement in its earnings per share, and relatively consistent dividend payments. Southern Missouri Bancorp fits all of our criteria, and we think there are a lot of positives to it from a dividend perspective.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Today we'll take a closer look at Southern Missouri Bancorp, Inc.
