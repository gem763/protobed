Andr\u00e9s himself delivered a report from the island, reminding viewers that he was nowhere near the eye of the storm, which at that time was centered above the Abaco Islands. The chef had to scream above the pounding rains, which lashed his face and drenched his clothes.\n\nWe @WCKitchen are 80 miles from #HurricaneDorian eye & feeling this!! Imagine what the people of Abaco+Grand Bahamas will experience!

They activated any space with electricity and water: churches, restaurants, food trucks, even the Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan. Andr\u00e9s frequently had to fight for his place at the table with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other relief officials.\n\nHow do we organize a response in Bahamas? Here\u2019s our current map we are working from.... @WCKitchen has kitchens ready to go and shelters mapped out. If kitchens are destroyed, we build one and cook in big paella pans! https://t.co/yNzrfrKIaS pic.twitter.com/fa4sBN8qMe \u2014 Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s (@chefjoseandres) September 1, 2019\n\nTwo years later, those hassles seemed like ancient history as the 2019 hurricane season saw its worst storm yet, Hurricane Dorian, batter the Bahamas over the weekend before turning north to start its trudge along the East Coast of the United States. According to a map that Andr\u00e9s tweeted out, World Central Kitchen had more than a dozen potential sites on Abaco and Grand Bahama islands to start feeding people.\n\n\u201cIf kitchens are destroyed, we build one and cook in big paella pans!\u201d World Central Kitchen volunteers did exactly that \u2014 cooked in outdoor paella pans \u2014 after Hurricane Michael flattened much of the Florida panhandle in October.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Andr\u00e9s tweeted a video from a pilot who surveyed the damage on Abaco. You can hear one person say that several sites are \u201cgone,\u201d or buried underwater. The chef added his own commentary in the tweet, \u201cI am hoping to land there this afternoon with sandwiches and fruit, and @WCKitchen will try to establish relief kitchen[s] immediately.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis footage from a pilot surveying the damage on Abaco is heartbreaking... @opmthebahamas officials able to see for first time. I am hoping to land there this afternoon with sandwiches and fruit, and @WCKitchen will try to establish relief kitchen immediately. #ChefsForBahamas pic.twitter.com/cQ3zbpZUG0 \u2014 Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s (@chefjoseandres) September 3, 2019\n\nIn some ways, Andr\u00e9s and WCK employees have become as much reporters on the scene as first responders, given their access to disaster areas. They not only talk about what food they\u2019re preparing, and for whom, but about the current conditions and the availability of resources.\n\n\n\nAndr\u00e9s was not immediately available for comment Tuesday, but Tim Kilcoyne, director of chef operations for World Central Kitchen, sent around a video on Twitter. He said volunteers on Monday had prepared and delivered more than 1,000 ham-and-cheese sandwiches to those affected on Abaco.\n\n\u201cA lot of places were closed yesterday, a lot of stores,\u201d Kilcoyne said, while standing at a Bahamas Food Services warehouse in Nassau. The BFS facility \u201creopened today, getting a ton of product. We got apples and oranges. \u2026 We got bread for our sandwiches, lettuce.\u201d\n\nVolunteers were preparing tuna sandwiches on Tuesday and delivering them to the hungry on Abaco via helicopter, Kilcoyne said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be here,\u201d Kilcoyne added. \u201cWe have more teams coming from Florida. \u2026 We will have lots to report on and more images and everything coming soon.\u201d\n\nMorning Update from WCK\u2019s @cheftkilcoyne in The Bahamas! Today we are stocking up on ingredients and fruit, making thousands of sandwiches & preparing initial food deliveries by helicopter to Abaco. #HurricaneDorian is finally moving, but only 2mph. #ChefsForBahamas pic.twitter.com/TCTxwlLXGU \u2014 World Central Kitchen (@WCKitchen) September 3, 2019\n\nIn the two years since Maria hit Puerto Rico, Andr\u00e9s and World Central Kitchen have embraced their role as first responders working to feed victims of natural disasters. They have responded to disasters of every stripe: They deployed to the Venezuelan-Colombian border during the power struggle in Venezuela. They traveled to California after the devastating wildfires. They set up kitchens in Indonesia after the earthquake and tsunami. They even opened a relief kitchen in downtown Washington to feed federal workers during the partial government shutdown this year.\n\nJos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s is nominated for the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize, congressman confirms\n\nAndr\u00e9s, World Central Kitchen employees and volunteers have prepared and served millions of meals around the world.\n\nIn the process, World Central Kitchen has grown from a small organization, with total assets of $119,000 in 2016, to one with total assets of $16.3 million in 2018, according to World Central Kitchen\u2019s financials. Andr\u00e9s is up for a Nobel Peace Prize, which will be announced Oct. 11 in Oslo.\n\nLatest @NHC_Atlantic forecast good news for Florida, but still danger from flooding! Our @WCKitchen team remains ready to respond with multiple kitchens cooking!
