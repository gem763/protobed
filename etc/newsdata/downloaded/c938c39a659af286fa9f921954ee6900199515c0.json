We were not aware of the dispute when the exhibition was planned, but it appears to be an issue between the previous owners.'\n\nThe Inigo Philbrick Gallery, Fine Art Partners and Royal Commission for Al-Ula have all been contacted for comment.", "description": "The immersive installation titled All the Eternal Love I Have for the Pumpkins is currently on display at the\u00a0Institute of Contemporary Art in Miami, America.", "authors": ["Raven Saunt For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/01/20262242-0-image-a-103_1572227843783.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
