So, sources close to the Prime Minister say, the government has nothing to fear should a transcript be released of the call in which Trump demanded Australia help him destroy special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nThe government has been less than forthcoming in its public response to the Mueller revelations, restricting itself to a short statement confirming Trump made the request and that \"the Australian government has always been ready to assist and co-operate with efforts that help shed further light on the matters under investigation''.\n\nDiplomatically, of course you would co-operate. But without further elaboration, that can be interpreted two ways. Either the government threw Alexander Downer under a bus in order to appease Trump, or it explained Downer did no more than any other diplomat would do in similar circumstances. He received information, and passed it on to those who needed to know.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the opposition opted for the former interpretation whereas the latter is the reality.\n\nNobody wanted to see a prime minister with the perception of being a lapdog to a US president or the American domestic political agenda, former Labor leader Bill Shorten has said.\n\n\"Prime Minister Morrison got a very warm, indeed special reception from President Trump,\" he noted.\n\n\"Mr Morrison needs to clean up the perception that perhaps the special reception was returned for special favours done.\"\n\nMoreover, Australia now finds itself being dragged into the impeachment scandal brewing around Trump. By his own admission, Trump sought the help of a foreign power (Ukraine) to destroy a domestic political opponent (Joe Biden), with the threat of withholding military aid.\n\nThat he is prepared to co-opt other foreign leaders such as Morrison to help him in a domestic political fight bolsters that case against Trump.\n\n\"Like the call with the Ukrainian President, Volodymyr Zelensky, the discussion with Mr Morrison shows the President using high-level diplomacy to advance his personal political interest,'' the Times says.", "description": "The Australian government's brief response to the Trump revelations leaves it prone to political attacks at home.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5519%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/8d3ca67d69c47d58f1d104494ccb6298c0335579", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
