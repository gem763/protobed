REUTERS/Lai Seng Sin/File Photo\n\nProducers of palm oil, a commodity used in everything from ice cream to lipstick, are blamed for destroying millions of hectares of forest in Southeast Asia, in part by using slash-and-burn techniques that blanketed Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia in smog in September.\n\nThe growers, though, say palm oil buyers like Unilever (ULVR.L), Nestle (NESN.S), Procter & Gamble Co (PG.N) and PepsiCo (PEP.O) share responsibility because they don\u2019t buy enough sustainably produced oil, undermining efforts to reward those who adopt greener practices and reduce deforestation.\n\nLast year, growers produced around 13.5 million tonnes of green palm oil - which costs more to grow and process - but only about half of it was sold at premiums to conventional palm oil.\n\n\u201cWe are not seeing new demand for sustainable palm oil,\u201d said Mohd Haris Mohd Arshad, downstream managing director of Sime Darby Plantation (SIPL.KL), the world\u2019s biggest producer of the environmentally friendly variety.\n\n\u201cHow do you get others to move towards (sustainable methods) when there\u2019s not even an incentive for it?\u201d\n\nPlanters received premiums of up to $50 a tonne for green palm oil right after certification was launched in 2004, but now they get as little as $1 to $30 over conventional palm oil prices of around $500 a tonne. [POI/]\n\nThat makes it hard to cover the extra costs of sustainable palm oil, which, according to Simon Lord, chief sustainability officer at Sime Darby, amount to $8-$12 a tonne, not including staff expenses.\n\nGREEN PALM OIL GOES TO EUROPE\n\nCark Bek-Nielsen, chief executive of United Plantations (UTPS.KL), said the consumer goods companies are not doing their part: \u201cWhen push comes to shove the only thing holding them back is their fear of having to pay a slight premium.\u201d\n\nTo force the issue, the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) - a regulator whose members include consumer companies, retailers, traders and palm growers - will for the first time make it mandatory for buyers to increase their purchases, according to new draft regulations.\n\nThe rules, to be implemented in November, will require RSPO members who buy palm oil to increase the proportion of their sustainable purchases by 15% every year or face fines and possible suspension from the green initiative body.\n\nWhen asked about the rules, the big consumer firms said they have pledged to eventually use only green palm oil in their products, but also that there are still supply reliability and transportation issues to overcome.\n\nOnly a fifth of last year\u2019s global palm oil output of 68 million tonnes had RSPO sustainable certification, which requires growers to meet standards on protecting forests, workers\u2019 rights and transparency.\n\nPart of the problem, the producers say, is that the goods companies buy sustainable oil mostly for products sold in Europe, and not for goods for India and China, the world\u2019s biggest palm oil markets and where price drives consumer demand.\n\nNestle told the RSPO that last year 56% of the palm oil it used in Europe was sustainable, while only 4% was green in India and none was in China. For Unilever, 97% of its palm oil used in Europe was green, compared with 41% in India and 48% in China.\n\nNestle said it was committed to achieving RSPO sustainable certification for 100% of its palm oil by 2023.\n\n\u201cAchieving a sustainable palm oil industry ... requires all companies in the supply chain to take action,\u201d a Nestle spokeswoman told Reuters by email.\n\nGemma Shaw, a Unilever spokeswoman, said her company was also committed to sustainable palm oil.\n\n\u201cAlthough consumer demand ... does vary from market to market, our commitment is a global one,\u201d Shaw said, adding that the RSPO numbers were old and that Unilever has made progress since then.\n\nPepsi and Procter & Gamble did not respond to requests for comment.", "description": "A palm oil industry watchdog will adopt rules next month that will impose fines on consumer goods companies like Unilever and Nestle if they don't start buying more green palm oil to help curb deforestation in Southeast Asia, the regulating body said.", "authors": ["A.
