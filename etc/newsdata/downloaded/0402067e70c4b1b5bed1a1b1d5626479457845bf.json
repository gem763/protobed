Boxing is what Pat loved to do. It\u2019s how he inspired people and it was something that made him feel alive.\u201d\n\nConwell wrote an emotional letter on Instagram praying for Day\u2019s recovery and admitted he was considering quitting the sport.\n\n\u201cI never meant this to happen to you, all I wanted to do was win,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I could take it all back, I would. No-one deserves this to happen to them.\n\nDiBella also discussed how the sport would respond to the news of Day\u2019s passing, which follows that of Russia\u2019s Maxim Dadashev and Argentina\u2019s Hugo Santillan in July.\n\n\u201cIt becomes very difficult to explain away or justify the dangers of boxing at a time like this,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not a time where edicts or pronouncements are appropriate, or the answers are readily available. It is, however, a time for a call to action.\n\n\u201cWhile we don\u2019t have the answers, we certainly know many of the questions, have the means to answer them, and have the opportunity to respond responsibly and accordingly and make boxing safer for all who participate.\n\n\u201cThis is a way we can honour the legacy of Pat Day. Many people live much longer than Patrick\u2019s 27 years, wondering if they made a difference or positively affected their world.\n\n\u201cThis was not the case for Patrick Day when he left us. Rest in peace and power, Pat, with the angels.\u201d", "description": "Boxer\u00a0Patrick Day, 27, has died from the head injuries sustained during his fight against Charles Conwell\u00a0in Chicago on Saturday.
