The number of domestic trips grew 7.8% this year, but that was slower than the 9.4% growth pace during last year\u2019s holiday week, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism said.\n\nHong Kong, a favorite vacation destination for Chinese, has seen a slump in visitors from the mainland, hurting receipts at hotels and shops and helping push the island\u2019s economy toward possible recession. The number of mainland citizens entering Hong Kong from Shenzhen\u2019s Luohu port was down almost 48% compared to last year\u2019s holiday, the immigration administration said.\n\nThe pullback continues the trend of slumping visitor numbers affecting tourist destinations across the region and is another sign of how weak consumer demand is undercutting efforts by China\u2019s government to rebalance and stimulate the economy.\n\nTo contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Yinan Zhao in Beijing at yzhao300@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jeffrey Black at jblack25@bloomberg.net, James Mayger, Michael S.
