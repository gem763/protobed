REUTERS/Toby Melville/Files\n\nThe state-backed bank said on Wednesday it had made an additional provision of 600-900 million pounds, on top of the 5.3 billion pounds already set aside, after claims received in August exceeded expectations.\n\nThe news gives credence to recent comments by industry experts that Britain\u2019s most costly consumer banking scandal could yet have a sting in the tail even after an August 29 deadline for claiming compensation.\n\nSeparately on Wednesday, rival Clydesdale Bank (CYBGC.L) (CYBG), which also owns the Yorkshire Bank and Virgin Money brands, said it had also received \u201cunprecedented volumes\u201d of requests for information from customers in the run-up to the complaints deadline.\n\nCYBG said it could take several months before determining the quality of the complaints received and the potential related financial impact.\n\nLater in the day, it said it expected to increase its provisions for legacy PPI costs by between 300 million pounds and 450 million pounds.\n\nBritish banks have so far paid out more than 36 billion pounds to consumers eight years after it first emerged they were mis-sold the loans insurance on a vast scale.\n\nPPI policies were sold alongside a personal loan or mortgage to cover repayments if borrowers fell ill or lost jobs but most were sold unsuitable policies.\n\nRBS said 4.9 billion pounds of its total provisions had already been utilised.\n\nPeople were bombarded with commercials and advertisements pushing them to make last minute PPI claims to their banks.\n\nOne such campaign was financed by Britain\u2019s banking regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority and fronted by U.S. actor-turned-politician Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nRBS\u2019s new provision will be reflected in the third-quarter results, the bank said, adding that the processing of PPI claims were ongoing and the ultimate provision recognised could be above or below the 600-900 million pounds range.\n\nAnalysts at Investec described the RBS provision as a \u201chorrific finish to the PPI saga\u201d.\n\n\u201cRBS has had more limited exposure to PPI relative to its domestic peers, in the context of which today\u2019s announcement ... is all the more shocking,\u201d Investec\u2019s Ian Gordon said.\n\n($1 = 0.8145 pounds)", "description": "Britain's Royal Bank of Scotland may have to shell out a further 900 million pounds ($1.1 billion) to settle a final compensation bill for mis-selling payment protection insurance after a last-minute surge in customer claims.", "authors": ["Abhinav Ramnarayan", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426121604&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830H4"}
