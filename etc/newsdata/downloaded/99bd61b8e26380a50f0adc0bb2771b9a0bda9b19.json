Advisers said that they were escalating efforts in the states that vote on Super Tuesday, a month after Iowans caucus, looking further down the calendar in what could become a long campaign slog as top candidates fight for delegates.\n\nBut for a campaign that has often touted polls and his perceived electability, it was a unique concession: Biden could afford to lose the first two contests.\n\n\u201cDo I think we have to win Iowa? No,\u201d one top adviser said, like the others speaking to reporters on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking. \u201cDo we want to win Iowa? Yeah.\u201d\n\nWhen speaking about New Hampshire, the adviser added, \u201cHistorically, there\u2019s an incredible home field advantage for a Massachusetts candidate, or a New Englander for that matter.\u201d\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren is from next-door Massachusetts, and Sen. Bernie Sanders is from neighboring Vermont.\n\n\u201cWe expect this to go one for a while,\u201d the adviser added.\n\n[The Daily 202: Four questions for the fall, starting with Joe Biden\u2019s durability]\n\nDuring Biden\u2019s previous two presidential campaigns, Iowa was a thorn. In his first race, it was the scene of him plagiarizing words from a British politician, which led him to drop out of the race in 1987, well before the next year\u2019s caucuses. During the 2008 campaign, he received less than 1 percent of the vote and soon dropped out.\n\nThe state does not line up with Biden\u2019s perceived demographic strengths, lacking a substantial population of black voters, who have provided a strong base of his support nationally and in other early-voting states such as South Carolina.\n\nHis campaign advisers\u2019 description of his approach to Iowa is similar to one that Biden himself has made, conveying a mixture of humility that he could lose while trying to project strength that he hopes to win.\n\nDuring an Iowa trip last month, Biden told the crowd that he thought the state held \u201cthe keys to the kingdom.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by a reporter as he walked to the Iowa Democratic Wing Ding dinner in Clear Lake whether that meant he viewed the state as a must-win for him, Biden responded: \u201cNo. I think you\u2019ve got to finish at the top. You\u2019ve got to be competitive.\u201d\n\nHe said that he thought the state would perform its traditional role of winnowing the field and that he hoped he would be among those who advanced.\n\nBiden advisers on Tuesday also tried to rebut any concerns by voters that his gaffes are all that significant, saying that voters generally feel that they know him and know what he means even when he makes verbal mistakes.\n\n\u201cThe newest story line is Biden making gaffes and mistakes. People say, \u2018How is it possible he says these things and voters rally to him?\u2019 \u201d one adviser said. \u201cThere\u2019s a depth of understanding that people believe they know him. They trust him. They believe him.\u201d\n\nThey also attempted to dispel the notion that he is not in line with the current Democratic Party. They said the party is older and more ideologically diverse than is often pointed out.\n\n\u201cWhen I hear that Joe Biden is out of step with the Democratic Party, I look at it and I think he is most representative of the Democratic Party \u2014 more than anybody,\u201d one of the Biden advisers said.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic Party is more than Twitter,\u201d the adviser added. \u201cAnd it\u2019s more than just a slice of the ideological spectrum. The Democratic Party represents a lot of interests. It\u2019s older than people want to admit sometimes. It\u2019s more ideologically diverse.\u201d\n\nThe aides also said the country is looking for the kind of uplifting message that Biden promotes.\n\nBiden has a \u201cmore optimistic vision,\u201d one senior adviser said. \u201cSometimes the Democratic message is so negative, almost exclusively negative. It doesn\u2019t offer a lot of hope or optimism in the future.\u201d\n\nThey conceded that Biden\u2019s standing with young voters is not as strong, which they said reflects unfamiliarity with his record.", "description": "The aides echoed the candidate\u2019s earlier comments, intended to meld humility and assertions of strength.", "authors": ["Matt Viser", "National Political Reporter", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/db8fW2hmxMUISAP3RIzjoE3jcvE=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/LOS56EGOPAI6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg"}
