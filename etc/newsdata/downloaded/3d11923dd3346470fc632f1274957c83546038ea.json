This includes all employers, no matter how few people they employ. Most workers, including employees, agency workers, trainees and those who are self-employed have protection from sex discrimination at work. This includes: recruitment and selection\n\npromotion\n\ntraining, pay and benefits\n\nredundancy and dismissal\n\nterms and conditions of work Source: Citizens Advice\n\nIn cases of the ethical failure\u2014where the company knew in advance the sensors were faulty\u2014participants were less likely to buy the car when the CEO was described as a woman than when described as a man.\n\nInterestingly, when the failure was due to incompetence\u2014the company didn't know in advance that the sensors were faulty\u2014participants said they were more likely to buy the vehicle when the CEO was described as a woman than when described as a man.\n\n'Women incur greater penalties for ethical transgressions because of persistent gender stereotypes that tend to categorize women as having more communal traits than men, such as being more likable, sensitive and supportive of others,' University of Virginia's Nicole Votolato Montgomery said in a statement released with the study.\n\n'Even in leadership settings, women are still expected to be more communal than their male counterparts.'", "description": "It's harder for women to rise to positions of leadership in corporate America, and once they get into positions of power they often face unfair expectations from the public.", "authors": ["Michael Thomsen For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/23/20157004-0-image-a-33_1571955800313.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
