Based on this assumption, we expect a 7% decline on average in budgeted gross operating balances for all rated metros over the same period,\" the report read. This means the gross operating balance of R2.8bn would be reduced to R2.6bn in three years.\n\n\n\nTshwane and Ekurhuleni, both have the highest exposure to LPUs and will be the most impacted. Their budgeted gross operating balances are expected to decline by 10% and 8%, respectively.\n\nNo room to move\n\nAs per current regulations, municipalities can only purchase electricity from Eskom. This limits their flexibility to counteract the impact of load shedding on their revenues, according to Moody's.\n\nThe City of Cape Town has taken legal action to allow the metro to procure up to 400MW of renewable energy from IPPs.\n\n\"Although municipalities are permitted to have their own generation plants, they only provide a small proportion of energy relative to demand, leaving Eskom as the main supplier of electricity to municipalities and thereby limiting their ability to offset supply challenges from the provider,\" the report read.\n\nAdditionally, the National Energy Regulator of South Africa has ruled on electricity tariff limits \u2013 which means without the regulator's approval municipalities cannot increase the price of electricity to counteract declining revenues.\n\n\"They (municipalities) also lack flexibility with regard to other major sources of revenue, including property rates, government grants and water rates,\" Moody's noted.\n\n\n\nMunicipalities often use the surplus from electricity revenue to cross-subsidise other basic services and cover part of capital expenditure. Declining electricity revenue surplus means municipalities are more likely to be reliant on capital grants and borrowing to fund their capital expenditure budget, Moody's pointed out.\n\n\"This will likely limit the ability of municipalities to efficiently provide basic services to the public,\" Moody's warned.", "description": "Metros such as the City of Johannesburg and City of Tshwane have suffered with declining revenues as users of electricity opt for off-grid solutions to beat supply shortages created by load shedding.", "authors": ["Lameez Omarjee"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8658/200b0825a8574f5a963e60b69d06defb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
