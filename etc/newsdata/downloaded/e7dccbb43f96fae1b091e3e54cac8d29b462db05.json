For one, the reality star had to take \"corset breathing lessons\" in order to walk and talk on the red carpet without passing out. And, now, it's revealed that she couldn't go to the bathroom unassisted while wearing the waist-cinching Mugler number.\n\nIn a new clip from an upcoming episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Kim expresses her concern to able to urinate without incident during a fitting for her dress. \u201cIf I have to pee, it\u2019s a problem,\" she told a group of her friends, to which one replied: \"Can you just wear...a diaper?\" Nope, a diaper was out the question.\n\nDavid Fisher/REX/Shutterstock More\n\nKim's solution? \"Honestly, if it\u2019s an emergency, I think I pee my pants and then have my sister wipe my leg up,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not even joking. She can wipe my leg up.\u201d By sister, it's unclear if she was referring to Kendall or Kylie who both attended the annual fashion event.\n\nPresumably, it never came down to Kim peeing herself, but she was still super uncomfortable throughout the night.\n\nRELATED: Kim Kardashian's Personal Trainer Claps Back at Critics of Her Super Cinched Waist at the Met Gala\n\nBack in July, Kardashian told WSJ.
