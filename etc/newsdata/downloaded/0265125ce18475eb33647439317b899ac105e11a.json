Last week some signals were sent that may indicate Romney is considering it.\n\nRemember Evan McMullin? He\u2019s the former CIA officer who ran as a third-party candidate in 2016. He claimed to be a conservative alternative to Donald Trump. He failed miserably and even placed third in total votes in his own state of Utah. McMullin was said to have been recruited by Bill Kristol and his ilk among Establishment Republicans who were unable to accept Trump at the GOP nominee.\n\nRomney has re-emerged, as he does occasionally, to be the self-appointed voice of morality. He slammed President Trump\u2019s behavior during the phone call to Ukraine\u2019s President Zelensky as \u201cwrong and appalling\u201d.\n\nBy all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling. \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) October 4, 2019\n\nKristol weighed in on Twitter with a poll \u2013 who do you respect more?\n\nLet\u2019s see how much of a hellscape Twitter is. Whom do you respect more? \u2014 Bill Kristol (@BillKristol) October 5, 2019\n\nThat exercise earned him a response that you would imagine from Trump supporters. Romney\u2019s behavior toward Trump has been erratic from the start. He blasted Trump before the election then pursued the position of Secretary of State and then ran for the U.S. Senate with the mission of being a thorn in Trump\u2019s side. His talent at flip-flopping is legendary.\n\nWhile Romney is clutching his pearls over Trump\u2019s phone call, I haven\u2019t seen a tweet criticizing Rep. Adam Schiff for lying about contact with the whistleblower who filed the complaint that opened up the investigation into the phone call. Even the Washington Post gave that four Pinocchios. That\u2019s the problem with Romney \u2013 he\u2019s too busy criticizing a Republican president to criticize Democrats. He was the first one out of the gate to jab at Trump on Twitter. Romney knew it would get a response.\n\nPresident Trump lashed out at Sen. Mitt Romney as a \u201cpompous \u2018ass\u2019 who has been fighting me from the beginning\u201d after the Utah Republican called Trump\u2019s discussions with foreign leaders \u201cbrazen and unprecedented.\u201d \u201cSomebody please wake up Mitt Romney,\u201d Trump tweeted Saturday, defending his conversations as \u201ccongenial and very appropriate.\u201d \u201cMitt Romney never knew how to win,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cHe is so bad for R\u2019s!\u201d\n\nThere was some chatter that Romney is quietly taking the pulse of GOP donors.\n\nBREAKING: Senator Mitt Romey has been calling conservative donors asking about a potential 2020 primary run against President Trump \u2014 Jack Posobiec \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@JackPosobiec) October 4, 2019\n\nLooks like Anthony Scaramucci is a fan of a Romney candidacy:\n\nMitt\u2019s Decency over Trump\u2019s Indecency.\n\nMitt\u2019s Patriotism over Trump\u2019s Facsism.\n\nMitt\u2019s Democracy over Trump\u2019s Dictatorship.\n\nMitt\u2019s Grace over Trump\u2019s Disgrace.\n\nMitt over Trump in 2020 If he ran he would win@MittRomney over the traitor @realDonaldTrump \u2014 Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) October 6, 2019\n\nI don\u2019t know what this week holds. None of us do. I do think that the twists and turns will continue all the way until the House votes to impeach Trump \u2013 which they will, and then the Senate votes not to impeach Trump \u2013 which they will. Or at least that is what it looks like today.\n\nDoes Romney have the cojones to put a primary challenge forward? Probably not. When push comes to shove, he usually whiffs. Most of all, Romney is an opportunist. He\u2019s for something as long as it is beneficial to him. For example, he set into place Romneycare in Massachusetts but when he ran for president against Obama and Obamacare, suddenly he was against it. If he continues to just preen on Twitter, he won\u2019t garner much support. He\u2019s just taking the opportunity in front of him to criticize Trump and sound like the Democrats who love to love him, except when he runs for president. The same Democrats praising him now called him all sorts of horrible names and made wild accusations against him back in 2012.\n\nRomney is stuck in Establishment Republican mode. His time has passed. An argument can be made that he\u2019s an example of how we got Trump in 2016. Trump voters aren\u2019t as interested in the president\u2019s words as they are actions. Romney isn\u2019t a fighter. He swats his opponents. Americans were ready for a fighter and that\u2019s why Trump rose as he did. Romney hasn\u2019t learned that lesson yet.", "description": "This is how we got Trump.", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "John Sexton", "Taylor Millard"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Mitt-Romney.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
