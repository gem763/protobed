Instead, the Home Office gave the American academic two weeks to pack up her life and leave the country.\n\nFord has held a research fellowship at Edinburgh University \u2013 which, like Glasgow is in the elite Russell Group \u2013 and is due to begin a new research fellowship at Oxford University. But this is in jeopardy after a letter from the Home Office in July, which said that her leave to remain, granted a year before, was erroneous, and that she must leave within two weeks.\n\nFord, an expert on 18th century Scottish music history, who says she loved Scotland from the moment she first set foot there, says: \u201cAfter eight years I had 14 days to get out. It was truly shocking. I have never felt so unwelcome or so offended.\u201d\n\nFord\u2019s case adds to a growing storm over the visa system. While the government has announced plans to offer two-year work visas for international students, nothing similar has been offered to researchers from abroad, who say the process is hostile, cumbersome and punitively expensive. University leaders say the situation could block the talent pipeline to the UK.\n\nGender pay gap expert among top professors quitting Brexit Britain Read more\n\nFord is refusing to leave her home in Glasgow and has been strongly backed by Scottish MPs, including Ian Blackford, the Scottish National party\u2019s Westminster leader. She has consulted immigration lawyers who say she has a case to appeal on human rights grounds.\n\nShe came to Glasgow to do her PhD under a student visa, then obtained a doctoral extension visa for a year. The research fellowships she has won since do not come with a fixed employment contract, so a charity sponsored her last visa applications. \u201cThe visa system in the UK is completely arcane and arbitrary,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is focused on high income and nothing else. But it is unrealistic to expect newly minted PhDs to find a permanent academic job with a high salary. It just doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nProf Roibeard \u00d3 Maolalaigh, vice-principal and head of the college of arts at Glasgow, says Ford is a \u201cvalued colleague\u201d and the university is very supportive of her application for a visa extension. \u201cThis case has caused considerable distress to Dr Ford, especially as it would appear that the issue was caused by an error at the Home Office,\u201d he says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shamit Shrivastava, a post-doctoral research associate at Oxford University\u2019s Institute of Biomedical Engineering, is forced to renew his visa every year at great expense.\n\nHowever, it is not only academics who have had their visas refused who are unhappy. The cost of applying for a visa has increased considerably in recent years, and many young researchers are struggling to pay the fees. Dr Jana Bacevic, a sociology research associate on a part-time contract at Cambridge University, earns \u00a31,200 a month. Last month she was horrified to hear that she had to pay \u00a31,500 to cover the costs of extending her visa for a year while she looked for a permanent academic job. She tweeted: \u201cYou know what UK? Good night and good luck. I used to love this place with all its flaws, but hey, there are universities on the continent too.\u201d\n\nGareth Edwards, an Australian who is a senior lecturer in human geography at the University of East Anglia, says: \u201cIf I was arriving today as a fresh postdoc I couldn\u2019t finance it, especially with a family.\u201d\n\nEdwards, who has co-founded an academic campaign group called International and Broke, says a postdoctoral researcher with a three-year contract, a partner and two children on the average salary is now expected to pay more than 30% of their first year\u2019s take-home pay \u2013 \u00a37,240 \u2013 upfront on visa and immigration costs.\n\nHe says junior academics are hit hardest as they are often on short-term contracts and have to reapply for their visa \u2013 and pay thousands again \u2013 every time their contract is extended or they move jobs.\n\nOne young Indian academic, who asked not to be named in case it prejudices his future visa applications, says the costs felt overwhelming, coming to Liverpool University from Mumbai with his wife and baby. \u201cI had visa costs of around \u00a32,500. We had to use my father\u2019s retirement savings,\u201d he says.\n\nShamit Shrivastava, a post-doctoral research associate at Oxford University\u2019s Institute of Biomedical Engineering, has had to reapply for his visa every year since he arrived in 2015. He says he is lucky because Oxford, unlike many other universities, pays the fees. But he still usually ends up spending hundreds more on the premium service each year to speed things up, because, typically, applications take two and a half months to process, meaning he could not work.\n\nBrexit brain drain: elite universities say they are losing future research stars Read more\n\n\u201cWhen I first applied, the programme I was working for had the funding to employ me for at least three years but I was only given a one-year visa. It is very stressful to have to go through it all again every summer,\u201d he says.\n\nShrivastava adds that to take out a loan or rent a flat for 12 months you need a visa of at least a year. This means that even a month after his paperwork is finalised, he is ineligible. \u201cI only manage because I have a wife who is employed, but colleagues have really struggled with this,\u201d he says. \u201cThe system leaves you with a feeling of helplessness.\u201d\n\nMartin Smith, policy manager at the Wellcome Trust, says UK visa costs for scientists are more expensive than competitor countries \u201cby a long way\u201d. The charity has also collected around 100 examples of cases where scientists wishing to come to the UK for conferences have had their visa declined unfairly. \u201cThese are disproportionately from lower-income countries, especially in Africa,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are told they do not have sufficient finances, even if the trip is fully funded.\u201d\n\nSmith adds that the suspension of parliament means that the immigration bill making its way through Westminster has died and will need to be reintroduced in a new session. The trust is worried that there is no clarity about what the government intends to do on immigration. \u201cIt\u2019s not reassuring for researchers right now,\u201d he says. \u201cFor people thinking about moving their lives to another country it is an enormous decision.\n\n\u201cThe current immigration system is so bad for science that unless we get some real clarity and improvement, talented people will drift away.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Home Office says: \u201cWe welcome international academics and recognise their contribution to the UK\u2019s world-leading education sector. All immigration applications are considered on their individual merits and on the basis of the evidence available.\u201d", "description": "Visa system for researchers is hostile and costly and risks jamming a pipeline of talent, universities warn", "authors": ["Anna Fazackerley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df0bf655a8e44bd0fcc3b86bfd8fa43445229a7f/0_335_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=103a36312be14440aa0342aa9193bc95", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
