The higher trajectory for oil prices could help support a stagnant Russian economy: increased oil prices give the government more leeway to raise public consumption, a much-needed prop to gross domestic product given a sharp drop off in private investment in recent years. It would also pad the central bank's foreign reserves and give comfort to foreign investors in the government bond market.\n\n\n\nThe World Bank cut its forecast for Russia\u2019s GDP growth this year to 1.4% from the previous 1.5% in early April. Now, new expectations that the economy may expand along with the energy sector are likely to give an additional boost to the ruble.\n\nUSD/RUB Daily Chart\n\nThe dollar rebounded today against the ruble after a three day drop of 2.22% after the attack on Saudi oil facilities. The ruble\u2019s weakness correlates to that of oil, and we consider it temporary amid a technical correction \u2013 profit-taking and gauging the playing field.\n\nNote, the price rebounded yesterday from precisely the same level as the March and April lows. Presumably, traders remembered that prices jumped 3% for the ruble and double digits for oil during that period.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, there is room for an upward correction after the August-September double top \u2014 the neckline of which coincides with the 200 DMA. This could also be developing a H&S top, with the right shoulder bottom marked by a blue dotted line. Whichever the top, it developed near the top of a falling channel since September, reinforcing a downward path for the dollar versus the ruble.\n\nTrading Strategies\n\nConservative traders are likely to wait for a full return move followed by evidence of oversupply, with a rally ending with at least one long red candle engulfing a green or small candle of either color.\n\nModerate traders may wait for the return move for a better entry but not necessarily for proof of trend integrity.\n\nAggressive traders may enter a contrarian long position, hoping to ride the bounce \u2013 providing they understand the risk and have preset a trade plan that fits their budget.\n\nTrade Sample \u2013 Long Position Setup\n\nEntry: 64.2000\n\nStop-Loss: 64.0000\n\nRisk: 2,000 pips\n\nTarget: 64.8000 \u2013 potential resistance if right shoulder develops (blue dotted line).\n\nReward: 6,000 pips\n\nRisk:Reward Ratio: 1:3", "description": "Forex Analysis by Investing.com (Pinchas Cohen/Investing.com) covering: USD/RUB, Crude Oil WTI Futures.
