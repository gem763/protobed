REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/Files\n\nTCS, a part of salt-to-software conglomerate Tata Group, heavily relies on banking clients in the West for revenue like its peers in the $180-billion IT services sector.\n\nHowever, an escalating trade war between the United States and China, as well as Britain\u2019s likely chaotic exit from the European Union have throttled global economic growth and many companies are cutting costs to cope with the slowdown.\n\nTCS\u2019 net profit rose 1.8% to 80.42 billion rupees ($1.13 billion) in the three months ended Sept. 30 from a year ago, but missed the average analyst estimate of 82.55 billion rupees, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nOperating margins dropped to 24% from 26.5%.\n\nThe company - whose clients include the Netherlands-based ABN Amro Bank, Citigroup UK and Norway\u2019s DNB - said revenue in its key banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) segment rose only 5.3% to 154.27 billion rupees.\n\nTotal revenue rose 5.8% to 389.77 billion rupees.\n\nBFSI, the company\u2019s biggest earner, contributed to over a third of its revenue in the last financial year.\n\nTCS has reported consistently outperforming results in the flagging global economy, but had said last quarter that it only expected to \u201csustain double-digit\u201d growth this fiscal year.\n\nShares of the company ended down 0.77%.\n\n($1 = 71.0850 Indian rupees)", "description": "Tata Consultancy Services Ltd reported a lower-than-expected September-quarter profit on Thursday, as India's No. 1 IT services exporter battled sluggish spending by financial clients.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439234119&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF990WQ", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
