They are ditching cutting-edge technology for double-edge or \u201csafety\u201d razors.\n\nSafety is something of a misnomer for what is basically a straight razor attached perpendicularly to a handle with only a metal guard separating blade from skin. Popularized in standard-issue World War I field kits, the razors are so-named because they replaced the barbershop-style straight razor that was simply blade-on-skin.\n\nMen are looking to reconnect with the past, \u201ceither their own family or a romanticized version of a 1950s barber shop,\u201d says Mark Herro, who runs Sharpologist.com, a kind of online shaving bible, and started using a safety razor over decade ago.\n\n\u201cHow many of us remember standing at the feet of your father in the bathroom, watching him shave?\u201d the site says.\n\nMr. Young says he switched from multi-blade razor refills because \u201cit offended me on a moral level\u201d to pay so much \u201cfor something that gets thrown in the trash.\u201d A double-edge razor costs as little a 15 cents for a blade that is typically recyclable.\n\nReady for a good old shave: safety-razor handle, blade, shave soap.

He bought a styptic pencil, an essential tool to stanch bleeding from mishaps.\n\nThe perils of grandpa\u2019s razor have driven users to virtual communities of men who share tips on surviving an old-timey shave. Without the safety features of a modern razor cartridge, pressure is paramount. Too little leaves behind stubble; too much causes razor burn or worse. A careless lateral swipe can leave a nasty gash.\n\nPaul Bissonnette shaving using a safety razor and part of his collection of 83 razors.

Baxter of California, a maker of men\u2019s grooming products, recommends a brush made from a badger\u2019s belly hair.\n\nNick Theccanat, a New Yorker who works in public relations, came across a blog suggesting the razors as a way to cut costs while attending college a decade ago. \u201cThe first couple of shaves were not that successful,\u201d he says. Early attempts left his face covered in nicks and often a Band-Aid or two. \u201cIt was embarrassing.\u201d\n\nHe sought suggestions online for a less bloody shave and came upon a world of how-to videos, passionate writings on the safety razor\u2019s merits and collectors showing off rare razors.\n\nOn the Double Edge Safety Razor Club Facebook group, around 1,000 members go for advice on things like \u201cWhat is the best way to clean shaving cream residue/buildup off the razor brass\u201d or \u201cIs it normal for your face to look like a war zone?\u201d The community wasn\u2019t kind to one who announced he was returning to modern razors, criticizing him for giving up too soon.\n\nShare Your Thoughts What would you rename the safety razor? Join the conversation below.\n\nThe safety razor\u2019s recorded history dates to an 1847 U.S. patent application, filed by British-born inventor William S. Henson, describing a device resembling a \u201ccommon hoe.\u201d A second iteration made its debut in the late 1800s, with Brooklyn brothers Frederic and Otto Kampfe submitting a patent for \u201cnew and useful improvements in Safety-Razors.\u201d\n\nMore pivotal was the 1901 introduction of a safety razor with a disposable blade. Behind it was American businessman King C. Gillette, founder of the namesake razor giant that Procter & Gamble Co. acquired for $57 billion in 2005. Mr. Gillette won a contract to supply American troops in World War I. Soldiers returning home began the device\u2019s path toward becoming a mainstay.\n\nA spokesman for P&G, which still sells Gillette safety-razor blades, said there was no meaningful shift to safety razors. The consumer-products giant in 2009 acquired The Art of Shaving, which sells high-end safety razors and accessories, among other items.\n\nSafety razors represent a tiny fraction of the U.S. razor industry, with around $2 billion-a-year in annual sales, according to one estimate. Their growing following has made an impact on people like Nancy Woda, who with her husband runs Taconic Shave in Yorktown Heights, N.Y.\n\n\u2018There\u2019s a trend of men reconnecting with the past, either their own family or a romanticized version of a 1950s barber shop.\u2019 Photo: Arnd Wiegmann/Reuters\n\n\u201cIt used to be that we were the only ones in the space, now we have a huge amount of competition,\u201d she says. The company distributes and co-owns Parker Safety Razor handles, blades, brushes and other products.\n\nMost recently, Ms. Woda says, environmentalists have taken up safety-razor shaving because the blades are recyclable and the handles last pretty much forever. \u201cI am hashtagged all the time by eco people.\u201d\n\nIn an eager collector\u2019s community, razors can go for hundreds, sometimes thousands, of dollars based on age, rarity, features and condition. A Gillette Bottom Dial razor, considered high-tech when it came out in the 1960s with a handle dial to adjust the blade, sells at auction for $1,500 or more.\n\nPaul Bissonnette of Bucksport, Maine, has 83. He started collecting after his search for a superior replacement to his safety razor led him to a 1955 Gillette model. It worked perfectly, says Mr. Bissonnette, 44, and the search left him intrigued.\n\n\u201cYou have this razor from 1955 or from 1909, and it\u2019s weird to think about where that has been,\u201d he says. \u201cThen to know that 100 years from now it will be a great razor.\u201d\n\nWrite to Sharon Terlep at sharon.terlep@wsj.com", "description": "\u2018Is it normal for your face to look like a war zone?\u2019 People are ditching cutting-edge technology for old-style double-edge blades to reconnect with the past, cut costs and save the planet, at the risk of a little bloodletting.", "authors": ["Sharon Terlep"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-109489/social", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
