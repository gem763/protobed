Almost a riot.\u201d\n\nHowever, not everyone went without their free cuppa on Tuesday.\n\n\"How can you not love a day when you can get a free Costa?\" tweeted one person.\n\nAnother tweeted a photo of their free coffee with the caption: \"Might have to wait 30 minutes or so for a free coffee but trust me it\u2019s worth it.\"\n\nIn response to the shortage, a Costa Express spokesperson apologised to those who were unable to get their free coffee and stressed that very few of its machines were out of order on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe have had a phenomenal response to our Costa Express Free Coffee Day and have been delighted by the overwhelmingly positive feedback from our customers,\" they said.\n\n\"Out of our 8,500+ Express machines in the UK, less than one per cent experienced a technical issue. The technology and innovation aligned to our machines means that we can see in real-time which machines are experiencing issues and we can either send out an engineer to fix the issue or resolve directly from our contact centre. We do apologise to the small number of customers who weren\u2019t able to pick up their coffee today.\"", "description": "Costa\u00a0customers were thrilled when the chain revealed\u00a0it would be giving out free cups of coffee on Tuesday, less so when the drinks had run out by 8am.", "authors": ["Olivia Petter"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/02/10/istock-529144262.jpg"}
