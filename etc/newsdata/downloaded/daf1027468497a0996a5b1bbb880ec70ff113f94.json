Otari Giorgadze has been busy and powerful (40 run metres for the number eight in the half) and extended the lead to 12 from the back of the scrum, Alexander Todua the first to cross in the corner with a scrum penalty advantage coming.\n\nBut Uruguay have stuck in the contest with some solid defence, and produced a set-piece move of real quality, attacking the back of the Georgian defensive lineout - just as Wales had, and similarly devastatingly executed. Andres Vilaseca's try means the margin is just five, and Uruguay are right in this one.", "description": "Follow live updates from the Rugby World Cup as Uruguay\u00a0and Georgia\u00a0go head to head this morning in Kumagaya.
