He said the flight had been long, and the pileup at the permanent resident reentry aisle was sluggish. So sluggish, Watson jokingly began \"mooing,\" he said.\n\nBy the time he finally reached the passport screening official, Watson was hoping to breeze by. Instead, the official repeatedly asked Watson if he wrote propaganda.\n\nHere's how Watson recalled the conversation, as published in Defense One:\n\nCBP officer, holding Watson\u2019s passport: \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d Watson: \u201cJournalism.\u201d CBP officer: \u201cSo you write propaganda, right?\u201d Watson: \u201cNo.\u201d CBP officer: \u201cYou\u2019re a journalist?\u201d Watson: \u201cYes.\u201d CBP officer: \u201cYou write propaganda, right?\u201d Watson: \u201cNo. I am in journalism. Covering national security. And homeland security. And with many of the same skills I used in the U.S. Army as a public affairs officer. Some would argue that\u2019s propaganda.\u201d CBP officer: \u201cYou\u2019re a journalist?\u201d Watson: \u201cYes.\u201d CBP officer: \u201cYou write propaganda, right?\u201d Watson waited five seconds. Then: \u201cFor the purposes of expediting this conversation, yes.\u201d CBP officer, a fourth time: \u201cYou write propaganda, right?\u201d Watson, again: \u201cFor the purposes of expediting this conversation, yes.\u201d CBP officer: \u201cHere you go.\u201d At that point, the CBP officer handed back the passport.\n\nWatson told USA TODAY he called his wife shortly after the encounter, and that's when things really began to sink in.\n\n\"Talking with my wife, I began to process it, and it began to feel totally abnormal. And I hope it doesn\u2019t become normal,\" Watson said Saturday.\n\nWatson has filed a civil rights complaint with the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nCBP is investigating Watson's claim, the agency said in a statement.\n\n\u201cCustoms and Border Protection is aware of the allegation posed by a Defense One editor about an officer\u2019s alleged inappropriate conduct at Washington Dulles International airport and we are investigating the allegation,\" a spokesperson said. \"We hold our employees accountable to our core values of vigilance, integrity and service to country, and do not tolerate inappropriate comments or behavior by our employees.\"\n\nFreedom of press: Committee to Protect Journalists broke own rule to protest Trump\n\nWatson said that, since the incident, journalists who have experienced similar treatment have been contacting him. While Watson said he can't validate any of their stories, he's certainly hearing a lot of them.\n\n\"I\u2019m finding more stories every time I open my inbox or check my text messages. That\u2019s alarming. I didn\u2019t expect that. I figured a little bit ... but not how much I\u2019ve heard,\" Watson said. \"It\u2019s interesting how people feel empowered in a way to share this.\"\n\nIn February, a CBP agent similarly questioned a BuzzFeed News reporter at New York's JFK Airport, asking the reporter about coverage of President Donald Trump, according to BuzzFeed. CBP later apologized for the official's conduct.\n\nIn May, a freelance journalist said he was detained by CBP for hours after returning home to Austin, Texas. Officials even parsed through the photos, videos and communications on his iPhone, the reporter said.\n\nIn August, a journalist passing through Los Angeles International Airport said a CBP official accused him of \"being part of the \u2018fake news media,'\" and wanted to know if he had ever worked for CNN or MSNBC.\n\n\"He let me go after I said that I was just here to write about 'Star Wars,' and would keep the fake news about that to a bare minimum,\" journalist James Dyer said in a Twitter thread that quickly went viral.\n\nThe incident at Dulles Airport has also been met with outrage on social media. Watson's colleague, Katie Bo Williams, called the CBP official's behavior \"genuinely disturbing\" in a Tweet on Friday.\n\nThis 1st-person account from my colleague @natsecwatson is genuinely disturbing & you should read it.\n\n\n\nOn learning he was a journalist, a customs officer at Dulles asked him *four* times \"You write propaganda, right?\" & held his passport until he said yes. https://t.co/cVAjBuaSCr \u2014 Katie Bo Williams (@KatieBoWill) October 4, 2019\n\nThreats against journalists in the U.S. are becoming standard. In April, Reporters Without Borders dropped the U.S. to No. 48 out of 180 on its annual World Press Freedom Index.\n\n\"As a result of an increasingly hostile climate that goes beyond Donald Trump\u2019s comments, the United States has fallen three places in this year\u2019s Index and the media climate is now classified as 'problematic,'\" the organization wrote in the report.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/10/05/cbp-agent-withheld-journalist-ben-watson-passport-dulles-airport/3880062002/", "description": "A U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u00a0official withheld journalist Ben Watson's passport until he admitted to writing 'propaganda.'", "authors": ["Grace Hauck", "Published P.M.
