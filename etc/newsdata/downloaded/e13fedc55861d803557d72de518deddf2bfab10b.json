Since 2016, I have served as Hunter\u2019s lawyer. In recent weeks, I have received numerous questions about those activities, many of which have been shaped by allegations bearing little resemblance to the public record. The following is a succinct, fact-based accounting of Hunter Biden\u2019s business activities in Ukraine and China. Hunter has also outlined specific commitments that would govern his business and financial dealings during a Biden Administration.\n\nUkraine: Burisma Holdings Limited (\u201cBurisma\u201d)\n\nIn April 2014, Hunter was asked to join the board of Burisma, the largest independent natural gas producer in Ukraine. At the time, Hunter was of counsel with Boies Schiller Flexner LLP [fn 1] (\u201cBoies Schiller\u201d), a major U.S. law firm, and was advising Burisma on its corporate reform initiatives, an important aspect of fueling Burisma\u2019s international growth and diversity. Vibrant energy production, particularly natural gas, was central to Ukraine\u2019s independence and to stemming the tide of Vladimir Putin\u2019s attack on the principles of a democratic Europe.\n\nTo further its goals of independence, Burisma sought to adopt standards and practices traditionally employed by Western companies. At Hunter\u2019s urging, Boies Schiller engaged Nardello & Co., a leading global investigative firm, to assess, among other things, Burisma\u2019s corporate structure and governance practices. Burisma agreed to pay the legal expenses of Boies Schiller to support Hunter in developing corporate reform initiatives.\n\nBecause of Burisma\u2019s stated commitment to corporate best practices, it was able to attract well-qualified board members, including the former president of Poland, Aleksander Kwasniewski, a leading advocate of democratic principles in the region. President Kwasniewski, familiar with Hunter\u2019s work on behalf of Burisma, recommended that Hunter join the board.\n\nHunter joined the board as a non-executive director, meaning he was an independent board member and not a member of the management team. At no time was Hunter in charge of the company\u2019s legal affairs. Like all Burisma directors, Hunter was compensated for his board service.\n\nHunter focused his work on the principles of corporate transparency, governance and responsibility, which was based on his prior experience as a lawyer and director on other boards, including the Chair of World Food Program USA, which supports the largest humanitarian organization in the world, Vice-Chair of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (Amtrak), to which he was appointed by President George W. Bush, Center for National Policy, Truman National Security Project, and the U.S. Global Leadership Campaign.\n\nHunter stepped off Bursima\u2019s board in April, 2019. Despite extensive scrutiny, at no time has any law enforcement agency, either domestic or foreign, alleged that Hunter engaged in wrongdoing at any point during his five-year term.\n\nChina: BHR (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Company (\u201cBHR\u201d)\n\nFounded in 2013, BHR (Shanghai) Equity Investment Fund Management Company (\u201cBHR\u201d) is a Chinese limited liability company formed with the stated intent to invest Chinese capital outside of China. Hunter neither played a role in the formation or licensure of the company, nor owned any equity in it while his father was Vice President. He served only as a member of its board of directors, which he joined based on his interest in seeking ways to bring Chinese capital to international markets. It was an unpaid position.\n\nBHR was capitalized with 30 million renminbi (RMB), or approximately $4.2 million USD at today\u2019s currency exchange rates. In October 2017, Hunter committed to invest approximately $420,000 USD (as of 10/12/2019) to acquire a 10% equity position in BHR, which he still holds.\n\nTo date, Hunter has not received any compensation for being on BHR\u2019s board of directors. He has not received any return on his investment; there have been no distributions to BHR shareholders since Hunter obtained his equity interest. Moreover, Hunter played no role in directing or making BHR\u2019s investments. Hunter intends to resign from the BHR board of directors on or by October 31, 2019.\n\nConduct During a Biden Presidency\n\nHunter undertook these business activities independently. He did not believe it appropriate to discuss them with his father, nor did he. Hunter always understood that his father would be guided, entirely and unequivocally, by established U.S. policy, irrespective of its effects on Hunter\u2019s professional interests. This was the standard observed throughout Hunter\u2019s professional career. When Hunter engaged in his business pursuits, he believed that he was acting appropriately and in good faith. He never anticipated the barrage of false charges against both him and his father by the president of the United States.\n\nHunter makes the following commitment: Under a Biden Administration, Hunter will readily comply with any and all guidelines or standards a President Biden may issue to address purported conflicts of interest, or the appearance of such conflicts, including any restrictions related to overseas business interests. In any event, Hunter will agree not to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign owned companies.\n\nHe will continue to keep his father personally uninvolved in his business affairs, while availing himself as necessary and appropriate to the Office of the White House Counsel to help inform his application of the Biden Administration\u2019s guidelines or standards to his business decision-making.\n\n____\n\nfn 1. After graduating from Yale Law School, where Hunter served as an editor of both the Yale Law & Policy Review and the Yale Journal of Law & the Humanities, Hunter worked in numerous posts, including as a Senior Executive VP for a major U.S. bank, and as Executive Director of E-Commerce Policy Coordination for the United States Department of Commerce. Hunter also taught as an adjunct professor at Georgetown University School of Foreign Service Masters of Science program.", "description": "Hunter Biden\u2019s business activities have received significant press attention.
