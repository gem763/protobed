The provinces have a combined population of more than 23 million.\n\nRecord Indonesian forest fires in 2015 spread haze across a swath of Southeast Asia, and according to a study by Harvard and Columbia universities, hastened 100,000 deaths.", "description": "Haze from new deliberately set fires blankets parts of Indonesia's Sumatra island after days of improving air quality.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/14/f88221d0a7d3445ca3b24a8c764b33bc_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
