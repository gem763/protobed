I think the ACLU is clearly an organization which is out there fighting for people who need to be represented and I'm just proud to wear the ribbon and represent them.\u201d\n\nCheadle isn\u2019t the only Hollywood celebrity championing the organization. In July 2018, various other A-Listers teamed up with the ACLU to read a letter which was written by an asylum-seeking Honduran mother, identified only as Mirian, who was separated from her 18-month-old son in April.\n\nThe letter detailed how Mirian fled Honduras in January 2018 seeking protection from government violence after her home was tear-gassed. Mirian claimed Border Patrol officials \u201cdid not provide any reason\u201d for separating her from her son, who turned two on July 4, 2018.\n\nMAGGIE GYLLENHAAL, RYAN REYNOLDS, AND MORE STARS RALLY TO READ MOM'S LETTER AFTER SHE WAS SEPARATED FROM 2-YEAR-OLD SON\n\nOn Sunday evening, the outstanding lead actor in a comedy series nominee lost out to former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d funnyman Bill Hader for the honor as Hader would earn the nod for his role the HBO original series \u201cBarry.\u201d Ahead of the ceremony, Cheadle told Fox Entertainment All Stars and Fox News win or lose, he\u2019s simply happy the show has garnered such recognition in just its first season.\n\n\u201cI've been very fortunate to play a bunch of great characters and be involved in a lot of projects that I feel very close to and are very special to me,\u201d Cheadle said of which role is his all-time favorite. \u201cIt's hard to differentiate which would be 'the one or two.' I'm always sort of happy to be dancing with the one that rung me, you know.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Golden Globe-winner continued: \u201cAnd I'm happy to be in 'Black Monday' right now and I've done a bunch of different things and a bunch of different genres, which is great. But you know, these things are always a little bit interesting because we're competing against one another in ways that are \u2013 it's really hard to sort of quantify.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe're all here representing very different sort of characters doing very different things. But it's great for the attention it brings to the show and my castmates and the crew and production, so I'm just glad to be here to rep the show,\u201d Cheadle added.", "description": "Don Cheadle used television\u2019s brightest stage to make a point about the US border crisis.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/01/Don-Cheadle.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
