Ikea\u2019s here to slake that need for owners of Sonos speakers.\n\nThe Symfonisk Sound remote controls play / pause, next / previous, and volume of your Sonos-compatible Symfonisk speakers (sold only by Ikea) and regular Sonos speakers as well.\n\nIt\u2019s tiny, cheap, and wireless, but does it really work as advertised?\n\nOur review of Ikea Symfonisk Sound remote Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Inexpensive\n\nWorks with regular Sonos speakers, not just Ikea\u2019s\n\nFlexible mounting options Bad Stuff Requires an Ikea Tradfri gateway\n\nSetup is frustrating\n\nThat screw\n\nThe Symfonisk Sound remote is priced at just $19.99. That\u2019s nothing compared to the $299 you\u2019d have to pay to add a volume knob to your Sonos system previously. I tried the Senic Nuimo in the past, and frankly, it didn\u2019t work as well as the Ikea Sound remote, though it certainly has a more premium feel and design.\n\nThe Sound remote does require the $30 Tradfri gateway, the nondescript Ikea puck that acts as a hub for the company\u2019s inexpensive \u201cHome smart\u201d gear, including blinds, switches, dimmers, outlets, sensors, and lights that all work together.\n\nAbout those screws... I\u2019d like to rant about the tiny screws Ikea uses to secure the cover on many of its wireless controllers and sensors, including the Symfonisk Sound remote. The screw must be removed to pair the device, reset the device, and change the battery. It\u2019s an annoying decision because the screw can 1) easily be lost, 2) requires one of those super tiny screwdrivers I can never find, 3) sometimes comes over-tightened from the factory, making it hard to loosen with those tiny screwdrivers I can never find. At least the screw on the new Sound remote stays attached to the small panel when open, which isn\u2019t the case on Ikea\u2019s other Tradfri controllers and sensors. If setting up Ikea\u2019s smart devices was flawless I\u2019d be less annoyed. But right now, dealing with the Ikea Home smart app and Tradfri gateway is frustrating and these screws add insult to injury, especially when the sensor has to be reset \u2014 or worse \u2014 paired again to a gateway that had to be reset. Fortunately, the included coin batteries combined with the power-sipping Zigbee wireless protocol should last for several months \u2014 if not a year or more \u2014 before I have to unscrew the devices again. I just hope I can find the screwdriver then.\n\nSetting up the Symfonisk Sound remote requires the Ikea Home smart app. Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s not great, although I found the Android app to be more stable than the iOS app which would constantly lose connection to the gateway. In fact, my whole setup experience was mired in frustration, plagued by dropped connections (between the app and gateway) and pairing issues (between the remote and gateway). Things have gotten better since our first buggy experience with Ikea\u2019s smart gear from two years ago, but there\u2019s still plenty of room for improvement.\n\nNevertheless, after some trial and error, and just plain weirdness with the Home smart app, I was able to get the Sound remote connected to my Sonos speakers in the kitchen. The Sound remote can only be linked to one Sonos zone (or grouped zone) at a time. Changing zones can be done in the Home smart app.\n\nThe Sound remote is tiny and made of cheap plastic. A non-slip ring on the bottom of the dial prevents it from slipping under your touch when placed on a flat surface. The dial itself is magnetic. Mine\u2019s attached to the side of metal breadbox the sits on my kitchen counter, which means it\u2019s out of sight but also quickly accessible while preparing a meal. The dial also ships with a small metal mounting plate that can be attached via screws or the included double-sided adhesive sticker.\n\nPhysical controls bring the expectation of hard-wired immediacy. You don\u2019t quite get that with the Sound remote, but it\u2019s close.\n\nClicking the Sound remote the first time can, occasionally, result in a lag of about one to two seconds before the Sonos system responds. Presumably this has to do with the dial waking from sleep in order to conserve battery. After that, the Sonos responds in a split second. Clicking once will pause or resume music, twice skips forward, and three clicks will go back a track, although the triple-clicks can occasionally fail as demonstrated in the video above. You have to get the cadence just right.\n\nVolume control is managed by rotating the dial. A dimple on the face of the dial helps with one finger operation. Rotating the dial is a joyless experience, lacking any kind of friction or tactile feedback... but you can\u2019t expect more at this price.\n\nIn general, performance is on par with controlling music from the Sonos app.\n\nThere\u2019s something wonderful about a wireless dial that magically reaches out across the ether to control music playing in a room. My eleven-year-old daughter loves it, which, as anyone who\u2019s ever tried to automate a home knows, is the highest form of familial approval.\n\nIt\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s hard to find fault in a $19.99 Sonos remote control\n\nIt\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s hard to find fault in a $19.99 Sonos remote control that does what it says it will, and does it well after you get over the frustration of setting it up. Especially if you\u2019ve already bought into the Ikea smart home and own a Tradfri gateway.\n\nThe Symfonisk Sound remote is trickling out globally \u2014 you\u2019ll see it listed in the French and Australian stores \u2014 so check your local Ikea where it might already be available for in-store purchase.", "description": "The Symfonisk Sound remote controls play / pause, next / previous, and volume of your Sonos-compatible Symfonisk speakers (sold only by Ikea) and regular Sonos speakers as well.
