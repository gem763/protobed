They were able to capture the fascinating data thanks to the HiPERCAM instrument on the Gran Telescopio Canarias and in X-rays by NASA's NICER observatory on the International Space Station.\n\nThey could then recreate the stunning phenomenon in video form using the latest modeling software.\n\n\u201cThe movie was made using real data, but slowed down to one tenth of actual speed, to allow the most rapid flares to be discerned by the human eye,\u201d astronomer John Paice, of the University of Southampton and the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy & Astrophysics, explained.\n\nAs MAXI consumes the nearby star, the black hole is emitting not just a cacophony of x-rays but also visible light radiation, which literally caught the eye of astronomers.\n\nAlso on rt.com Astronomers discover most MASSIVE neutron star known to man\n\nThe material around the black hole is incredibly bright, with a light output of roughly one hundred suns, because it has been crushed and compressed by a combination of friction, magnetic and gravitational forces.\n\nBecause of this, the researchers think it may hint at a unifying characteristic of such black holes that might explain just how plasma is produced and maintained in space, a feat which has proven next to impossible for any meaningful amount of time here on Earth.\n\nLike this story?
