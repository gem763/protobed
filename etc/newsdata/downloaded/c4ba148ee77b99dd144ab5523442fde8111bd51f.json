Facebook said it hopes to ensure the panel's independence by paying the board through a trust, though that trust will be set up and funded by Facebook.\n\nA charter outlining how the board will operate was published on Tuesday, detailing the three main goals: providing oversight of Facebook\u2019s content decisions; reversing Facebook\u2019s decisions when necessary; acting as an independent authority outside of Facebook.\n\nCases will be sent to the oversight board only after all other moderation tools have been exhausted and it is anticipated that it will consider \u201cdozens\u201d of cases each year.\n\nFormer UK deputy prime minister Nick Clegg, who now serves as Facebook\u2019s head of communications, said the new charter and board could be adopted by other technology giants struggling with content moderation.\n\n\u201cThe content policies we write and the decisions we make every day matter to people. That\u2019s why we always have to strive to keep getting better,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe oversight board will make Facebook more accountable and improve our decision-making. This charter is a critical step towards what we hope will become a model for our industry.\u201d", "description": "Facebook has unveiled plans for an independent committee that will be responsible for overseeing and governing the content on the social network.
