No, he\u2019s a thug. I know him,\u201d Biden told about 100 people gathered at the Brentwood home of Paramount\u2019s Jim Gianopulos and his wife, Ann.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nAccording to a pool report, Biden continued, \u201cAnd the president is the most dishonorable president in American history. And folks, he picked the wrong guy to pick a fight with, because I\u2019ll tell you what. I\u2019m going to beat him like a drum.\u201d\n\nThe event at the Gianopulos home on Thursday evening was Biden\u2019s second fundraiser of the day. Earlier, he spoke at the home of producer Michael Lombardo and his husband, Sonny Ward, an architect.\n\nBiden\u2019s comments about Giuliani were in reference to the arrest of two of Giuliani\u2019s associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, on campaign finance violations.\n\nGianopulos introduced Biden, telling the donors gathered in his yard that \u201cI know of no one who is more appropriate, more right, more the right person to put us back on track than Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nBiden also noted the presence at the fundraiser of Jeffrey Katzenberg, who was there with his wife Marilyn. Other co-hosts included Sony Screen Gems\u2019 Eric Paquette and writer Jessica Postigo, Sony\u2019s Tom Rothman and actress Jessica Harper, Legendary Entertainment\u2019s Josh Grode, Cooper Hefner and Scarlett Byrne, Matt Rutler, and former ambassador James Costos and designer Michael Smith.\n\nOthers at the event included CBS\u2019s David Nevins and Showtime\u2019s David Nevins, Jim Wiatt, Disney/ ABC\u2019s Dana Walden, attorney Ted Boutrous and attorney Skip Brittenham, according to a source who was there.\n\nEarlier in the day, Biden also talked about the need to be more succinct in Democratic debates, a challenge given the time constraints. Some donors want Biden to hit Trump back harder in the face of the president\u2019s personal attacks on his family.\n\nBiden has fired off some punchy lines about Giuliani in the past.\n\nIn 2007, when Giuliani looked to be a front runner for the Republican nomination and Biden was running in the Democratic primary, he mocked the New York mayor\u2019s frequent invocation of his handling of the terrorist attacks on 9/11.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s only three things he mentions in a sentence \u2014 a noun, a verb, and 9/11. There\u2019s nothing else!\u201d Biden said in a debate that year.\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
