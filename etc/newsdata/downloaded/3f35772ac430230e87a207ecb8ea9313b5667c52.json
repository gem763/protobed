But critics say the concession is unlikely to bring an end to intensifying unrest, which has rocked the city for more than 13 consecutive weeks and is now driven by a host of other objections.\n\n\u201cThe government will formally withdraw the bill in order to fully allay public concerns,\u201d Lam said in a video address Wednesday evening after a closed-door meeting with pro-government lawmakers.\n\nThe contentious legislation would have allowed the extradition of fugitives to mainland China where the murky court system operates under the influence of the Communist Party. Popular backlash to the proposal prompted two million people to march in the streets in June according to organizers\u2019 estimates. In response, Lam declared work on the bill suspended. But her announcement, and later insistence that the bill was \u201cdead,\u201d did little to mollify the angry crowds, as many feared the measure could be revived at a later date.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

But the movement has swelled to encompass a growing list of demands, including an independent inquiry into perceived police brutality and direct elections for the city\u2019s leaders.\n\nReplying to the public\u2019s \u201cfive demands,\u201d Lam continued to insist her administration has \u201cin fact responded.\u201d\n\n\u201cI recognize that these may not be able to address all the grievances of people in society,\u201d she said, before presenting \u201cfour actions\u201d that she hoped will initiate a dialogue with the public, including agreeing to the formal withdrawal of the bill.\n\nShe also announced two additional members for the existing police review mechanism, but stopped short of agreeing to calls for an independent inquiry. The escalating use of force, frequent salvos of tear gas in residential neighborhoods and mass arrests\u2014announced at 1,183 Wednesday\u2014have contributed to hardening resentments against a police force that previously enjoyed widespread public trust.\n\nLam has steadfastly defended the police, and resisted calls for independent accountability measures.\n\nDemocratic legislator Claudia Mo agreed that Lam needed to go further if she is to placate the protesters.\n\n\u201cShe has created such havoc, a word she\u2019s used herself, and the damage is done,\u201d Mo tells TIME. \u201cI think the protestors will just carry on with their quest for democracy and human rights.\u201d\n\nNatalia Lee, a 24-year-old protester, says she doesn\u2019t think the Chief Executive\u2019s announcement will have much impact at this point.\n\n\u201cToo much has happened for the withdrawal of the bill to work as a solution. Only all five demands would appease the people,\u201d she says.\n\nIn at least one neighborhood, residents took to their rooftops after Lam\u2019s televised announcement and began a collective chorus of \u201cfreedom for Hong Kong!\u201d LIHKG, a reddit-like forum used by the protesters, buzzed with calls to reject any compromise.\n\nThe demonstrations, which have increasingly turned violent with protesters at various times ransacking the legislature, shutting down the city\u2019s airport, besieging police headquarters and turning Hong Kong\u2019s normally bustling retail and entertainment districts into battle fields, have snowballed far beyond the extradition bill. The rebellion against Lam\u2019s administration has become an all-out push for greater democracy, with many demanding self-determination or even independence from Beijing.\n\n\u201cThis is our final chance to win democracy and liberty so we can\u2019t step down now and we must march on,\u201d Ventus Lau, 25, who has organized a number of marches and rallies since June, tells TIME.\n\nHong Kong returned to Beijing\u2019s control in 1997 under a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework that grants the city semi-autonomy and protects civil liberties that are not exercised on the mainland, like the freedom to protest. Fears over Beijing\u2019s tightening hold on the former British colony have periodically spilled into protests, but the current, unrelenting summer of dissent has polarized the city and taken a toll on its reputation as Asia\u2019s international financial hub.\n\nExperts worry that travelers will now avoid Hong Kong, and businesses say the disruptions have prompted them to consider relocating.\n\nLam, in her televised address, said events in recent months have \u201cshocked and saddened Hong Kong people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should all think deeply whether escalating violence and disturbances is the answer,\u201d she said.\n\nSamson Yuen, assistant professor of political science at Hong Kong\u2019s Lingnan University, tells TIME that the bill\u2019s withdrawal \u201cwill take some steam, some violence off the streets, but it won\u2019t take people off the streets. In the medium term, protests will still continue, mainly because the protesters\u2019 focus has broadened.\u201d\n\n\u2014With reporting by Hillary Leung and Aria Hangyu Chen / Hong Kong\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Chief Executive Carrie Lam, is to formally withdraw a divisive bill that has caused 13 weeks of unrest, according to a local media report.", "authors": ["Time Staff"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/gettyimages-1165787734.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
