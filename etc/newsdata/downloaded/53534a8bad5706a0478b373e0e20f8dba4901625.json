Never met her,\" Trump tweeted, but immediately contradicted his feigned ignorance of the TV host, writing, \"she knows ZERO about me, has NO talent, and truly doesn't have the 'it' factor needed for success in showbiz.\"\n\n\"Had a bad reputation, and now works for the Comcast/NBC losers making up phony stories about me. Low ratings. Fake news!\" the president went on to write in the same tweet.\n\nRead more: Trump stunned US officials when he called Egyptian President el-Sisi 'my favorite dictator' at the G7\n\nReid has hosted \"AM Joy\" since 2016, and as of 2018 averages 1 million viewers per episode. She also frequently fills in for Hayes and Rachel Maddow and is one of the most prominent journalists on Twitter, being the \"most tweeted\" at MSNBC, which ranks fourth in the list of the \"most tweeted\" outlets, Poynter reported.\n\nOn \"All In\" Friday night, Reid discussed several matters related to Trump, including gun control legislation, the revived ethics lawsuit against his administration, and his Thursday trip to Baltimore, where he was greeted with protesters.\n\nIn addition to retweeting tweets about the Inspector General's office's investigation into whether the Department of Justice and the FBI violated the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in investigating Trump's administration's ties to Russia, Trump also tweeted Saturday morning about a call with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the possibility of moving forward with a Mutual Defense Treaty to further the US-Israel alliance.\n\nReid has not acknowledged or responded to the president's tweet online, and appeared in her usual slot Saturday morning for MSNBC's \"AM Joy\" show. She has not yet acknowledged the president's attack against her on air, either.", "description": "Joy-Ann Reid, who recently published a critical book about Donald Trump, was the target of the president's vitriol on Twitter Saturday morning.", "authors": ["Kat Tenbarge"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d7cf9e72e22af3833186cd4-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
