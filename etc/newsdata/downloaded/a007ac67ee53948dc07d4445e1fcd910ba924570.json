We are working with the club and the players to play under pressure.\n\n\"We are going to speak with him because the reaction was wrong. We are here because we have supporters. We work for them and need to have respect for them when they are applauding us and criticising us.\"\n\nHector Bellerin took to Twitter on Monday where he called for unity.\n\n(Image: ETIENNE LAURENT/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n\"We are all humans, we all have emotions, and sometimes it's not easy dealing with them,\" tweeted the Gunners right-back.\n\n\"It's time to lift each other up, not to push each other away. We only win when we are together.\"", "description": "The Gunners midfielder allegedly left the Emirates before the final whistle after being subbed off on Sunday", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Arsenal Fc Via Getty Images", "Visionhaus", "Etienne Laurent Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20741988.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arsenal-FC-v-Cardiff-City-Premier-League.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
