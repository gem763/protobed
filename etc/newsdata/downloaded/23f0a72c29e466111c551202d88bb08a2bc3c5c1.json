You know, those are the opposite roads. That happens. I won't say it ever happened to me, but it did. When you get used to driving on our system and then you're all of a sudden in the other system, where you're driving \u2014 it happens. Have to be careful.\"\n\nA home video of Dunn.

However, a photo of Trump's notes \u2014 marked \"SECRET,\" but shown in plain sight \u2014 showed that Pompeo told Raab that Sacoolas \"will not return to the United Kingdom.\" This US decision had not been reported before.\n\nHere's a photo of Trump's notes, as tweeted by Washington Post photographer Jabin Botsford:\n\nThe UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office has not yet responded to Insider's request for confirmation on Pompeo's conversation with Raab, and comment on Trump's remarks.\n\nSacoolas' legal right to claim diplomatic immunity came under scrutiny earlier this week as her husband's name does not appear on the UK's official list of diplomats in London.\n\nHowever, sources from the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Prime Minister's Office have told Insider that the family had the right to full immunity.", "description": "Anne Sacoolas is suspected of fatally crashing into Harry Dunn with her car in August.
