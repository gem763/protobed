They also formed a human chain as part of their action against the ICC decision,\u201d said Saiful Islam, police chief in the western town.\n\nProtesters carried placards saying that Shakib was the victim of a \u201cconspiracy\u201d.\n\nSmaller protests were held in the capital Dhaka, police said.\n\nThe Test and T20 captain accepted charges that he had failed to disclose details of approaches made over a tri-nation series between Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe in 2018 as well as the 2018 Indian Premier League (IPL).\n\nShakib will be eligible to return from October 29 next year but he is ruled out of the T20 World Cup in Australia which starts October 8.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Shocking\u2019 decision \u2013\n\n\u201cThose who have supported me over the years, I hope they, the fans, Bangladesh Cricket Board, the government, the journalists will continue to support me in my bad and good time,\u201d Shakib told reporters after the ban was announced.\n\n\u201cI am hopeful I will come back to cricket soon. I will be stronger and will perform my responsibilities with more sincerity,\u201d he said.\n\nShakib, who has played 56 Tests, 206 ODIs and 76 Twenty20 internationals, is Bangladesh\u2019s biggest sporting hero and has regularly topped the ICC rankings for all-rounders since 2009.\n\nAt this year\u2019s World Cup in England, Shakib scored more than 600 runs and picked up 11 wickets. He also became the fastest cricketer to reach 5,000 runs and 250 wickets in one-day internationals.\n\nAfter the ban, Shakib stepped down from the MCC World Cricket committee, which said it was \u201csorry\u201d to lose him but supported his resignation, which was \u201cthe right decision\u201d.\n\nBangladesh Cricket Board president Nazmul Hassan said Shakib\u2019s suspension was \u201cshocking\u201d as he is the centrepiece of the team.\n\n\u201cWe have no substitute (for Shakib)\u2026 I was angry when I first heard about it and asked why he didn\u2019t inform me. We planned our India tour keeping Shakib in the team,\u201d Nazmul told reporters.\n\nBangladesh will play two Tests and three T20 internationals in its Indian tour that starts November 3.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Hundreds of people staged a demonstration in a Bangladesh town Wednesday against a two-year ban on cricket captain Shakib Al Hasan for not declaring attempts to bribe him.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/878334-shakib-al-hasan-twitter.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
