Forget it, she\u2019s rolling. Or trolling. Take your pick, but Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t going to get a rematch now even if she wanted it. And especially since Donald Trump wants it:\n\nHillary Clinton coming down with a strong case of Stacey Abrams Syndrome and claiming she won the 2016 election. pic.twitter.com/uTSj72IMN0 \u2014 Zach Parkinson (@AZachParkinson) October 9, 2019\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Tuesday trolled President Trump after he suggested that she should run for president again, joking that \u201cmaybe there does need to be a rematch.\u201d \u201cObviously I can beat him again,\u201d Clinton joked on \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d in an apparent reference to her earning a majority of the popular vote in the 2016 election. Trump won the Electoral College vote, 304-227. The comments from Clinton, who has launched two White House bids, came as Trump continued to lash out at Democrats over a formal impeachment inquiry launched in the House. He targeted Clinton in an early-morning tweet Tuesday, saying that he thought she \u201cshould enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren.\u201d \u201cOnly one condition. The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors,\u201d Trump said, prompting Clinton to reply, \u201cdon\u2019t tempt me. Do your job.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cagain\u201d comment is Hillary Clinton\u2019s attempt at being cute about her loss in 2016. Since that shocking defeat, Hillary has offered any number of excuses for her poor performance in traditionally blue states, almost all of which focus on something other than Hillary Clinton herself: sexism, Russia, disinformation, James Comey, the heretofore-unknown existence of Wisconsin as a state, etc. That act is wearing thin, but that was true of The Clinton Act as a whole before 2016 too.\n\nHer appearance on PBS\u2019 NewsHour is ostensibly in support of her new book Gutsy Women, co-authored by daughter Chelsea. It does have the aroma of a pre-campaign, however, similar to the epic flop of a tour Hillary conducted in 2014 in support of her campaign-ready memoir Hard Choices, for which she received a stunning $14 million advance. This one seems to be going better, as Hillary has managed to avoid dropping bon mots such as $100 million not making one \u201ctruly well off,\u201d and lamenting the poverty into which she and Bill fell after his term ended in January 2001.\n\nHillary certainly sounds as if she\u2019s on the campaign trail more than the book-flacking tour:\n\nFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Tuesday slammed President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria, saying the move was a \u201cbetrayal\u201d of Kurdish allies and would lead to a \u201cresurgence of militancy\u201d in the region. \u2026 Clinton said Trump\u2019s latest Syria plan was playing into Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s hands, and represented another example of Trump allowing foreign leaders to influence U.S. foreign policy. Trump also announced an immediate withdrawal of thousands of troops from Syria last year after speaking to Erdogan, though he later said the drawdown would take place more slowly. \u201cWhy are we sitting silently by and watching him do Putin\u2019s bidding?\u201d Clinton said, adding, \u201cthere\u2019s no happier man in the world right now than Putin.\u201d Clinton, who served as the U.S.\u2019s top diplomat for four years, said Trump\u2019s foreign policy decisions damage the U.S.\u2019s standing overseas. The next president \u201cwill inherit shattered alliances, emboldened adversaries\u201d and \u201call kinds of internal divisions that are going to have to be addressed,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd, er \u2026 gutsy women, or something! Hillary sounds more like a gusty woman on this tour, one who resents having to talk about these (ahem) hard choices than being the one making them. That doesn\u2019t mean, however, that she and Trump are going to get their rematch. Democrats have too many other candidates clogging the path to yet another coronation attempt, candidates without Clinton\u2019s baggage and track record of failure against Trump. Unlike in 2016, Clinton didn\u2019t lock up all of the major institutional donors and no longer has a campaign staff on salary at her charitable foundation. Even with all of those advantages, she needed the DNC to cook the process to hold off a crank socialist from Vermont in the last cycle\u2019s Democratic primaries.\n\nHillary knows all this, even if she might secretly yearn for a rematch. The best she can do is a book tour and gust on from the sidelines.", "description": "Gusty woman.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/hillary-rematch.png", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
