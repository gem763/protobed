'He is probably in a better condition that he was last week at this stage. Immeasurably better.\n\n'Owen is a bit sore but he will be fine. We have got a few others carrying bumps and bruises because it was a tough old game.\n\n'We've had a day or two of recovery, we started doing a little bit of preparation today but the players understand that they haven't done anything yet. The most important week is coming up and we're excited to be here. The only thing I sense is excited about what the team can achieve this week.'\n\nSpencer was met at Tokyo airport on Monday morning and he is now on track to make his World Cup debut in the final.\n\nHe is being given a crash course in England's preparations - with Jones praising the assistance of Heinz to bring the newbie up to speed.\n\nMay receives a crunching tackle by two New Zealand players during the physical clash\n\n'It's tough for Willi, he's been a great contributor, a very well-liked member of the squad and he was in tears in the dressing room,' said Jones. 'It's tough for him but he's now collected himself, he now knows he's got another role to play for us and he'll fulfil that role really well this week. He's already started to mentor.\n\n'Ben has been in and around the squad consistently for the last couple of years so he knows the game, he knows the players. He is a fit guy and just fits in quite readily. We always said to those guys outside the 31 that they need to be ready, and he is ready to go.'\n\nAlongside the rest of the team, Spencer has a chance to write his name into the history books.\n\nTicket prices for the final have ramped up and an army of England fans are expected to descend on Tokyo.\n\nAnthony Watson (left) and Owen Farrell also picked up knocks but will be fit for South Africa\n\nJones is desperate to give them an extra special party - quipping that a victory would help lift the country from the doldrums of Brexit.\n\n'I think it's great to give the country something to cheer about,' said Jones.\n\n'And with Brexit at the moment they probably need something to cheer about. It's a job of the team to make the country happy, not as happy as they can be, because there is still a game to go.\n\n'The crowds here generally at the World Cup have been fantastic and I thought our supporters on Saturday night were massively instrumental in getting us home. Their singing, their general support of the team were fantastic and we urge them to keep doing that.'\n\nEngland head coach Eddie Jones says his squad are fit and firing ahead of Saturday's final\n\nAnd Jones also delivered a cutting riposte to Warren Gatland's suggestion that England might already have played their World Cup final last Saturday.\n\nThe Wales coach said: 'We have seen in previous World Cups that teams sometimes play their final in semi-finals and don't always turn up for a final. So it will be interesting to see how England are next week.'\n\nJones hit back: 'Send my best wishes to Warren, I hope he enjoys the third-fourth place match.'", "description": "Winger May was among a host of players - including Kyle Sinckler, Anthony Watson and Owen Farrell - to pick up knocks in the bruising victory over the All Blacks on Saturday.", "authors": ["Nik Simon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/28/11/20277094-0-image-a-78_1572263537560.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
