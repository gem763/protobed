(Leah Millis/Reuters)\n\nActing White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney attempted to clarify comments made during a Thursday press briefing in which he suggested that the White House actively withheld Ukrainian military aid in exchange for pressure on Ukraine to look into its involvement in corruption during the 2016 election.\n\nMulvaney released a statement saying, \u201cLet me be clear, there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election. The president never told me to withhold any money until the Ukrainians did anything related to the server.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid he also mention to me in the pass that the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely. No question about that. But that\u2019s it, that\u2019s why we held up the money,\u201d Mulvaney had said in the initial exchange earlier on Thursday. When ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl pressed Mulvaney on whether he was confirming that there had been a quid pro quo related to the Ukraine aid, Mulvaney stated, \u201cThe look-back to what happened in 2016 certainly was part of the thing that [Trump] was worried about, and that is absolutely appropriate.\u201d\n\nIn the midst of impeachment fervor over the Trump\u2019s handling of aid during discussions with the new Ukrainian administration under President Volodymyr Zelensky, Mulvaney\u2019s comments left the president\u2019s legal counsel \u201ca bit stunned.\u201d Trump\u2019s defense has centered around the argument that there was no quid pro quo planned or discussed between the White House and Kyiv.\n\nDemocrats on Capitol Hill said in the aftermath of the press conference that Mulvaney has only further incriminated Trump.\n\n\u201cThe fact that [acting] chief of staff Mulvaney, with his acknowledgement now that military aid to a vital ally, an ally battling Russia as we speak, was withheld in part out of desire by the president to have Ukraine investigate the DNC server or Democrats or 2016, things have just gone from very, very bad to much, much worse,\u201d House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) said.\n\n\u201cI guess having failed at discrediting the facts of this case, they\u2019ve decided on a new tactic, which is to admit them and basically say, \u2018So what?\u2019 And the answer to that is, \u2018Well, the \u201cso what\u201d is you\u2019re going to be impeached,\u2019\u201d House Oversight Committee member Gerry Connolly (D., Va.) commented.", "description": "Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney attempted to clarify comments made during a Thursday press briefing in which he suggested that the White House actively withheld Ukrainian military aid in exchange for pressure on Ukraine to look into its involvement in corruption during the 2016 election.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Jim Geraghty", "Kevin D.
