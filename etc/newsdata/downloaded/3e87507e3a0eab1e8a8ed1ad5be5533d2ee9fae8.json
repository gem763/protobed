We are neighbors with each other and not with the United States,\" he said.\n\nForeign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, elaborating on the idea at a UN Security Council session called by Russia, called for a summit among all countries along the Strait of Hormuz, the strategically vital gateway into the Gulf.\n\nThe countries will declare their zone free from weapons of mass destruction and form a pact of mutual non-aggression, Zarif said.\n\n\"The Islamic Republic of Iran stands ready to fully engage in dialogue with the regional countries to discuss all aspects of this initiative,\" Zarif said.\n\nProspects for a broad pact led by Tehran look unlikely as several of the Gulf Arab states have tense relations with Iran.", "description": "Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Wednesday demanded that Saudi Arabia end its offensive in Yemen after an attack in the oil-rich kingdom which Washington blamed on Tehran.  \"The security of Saudi Arabia will be guaranteed with the termination of aggression in Yemen, rather than by inviting foreigners", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JZtRCOwDnPEwWJGUXPQlcA--~B/aD01OTc7dz03Njg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/51ef37619862cb1a897b7a3ee9c80b4b6b4f2915.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
