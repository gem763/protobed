And that\u2019s precisely the issue here.\n\nMissouri, in fact, has been favored every single time it has kicked off this season, which is partially about the perception of how good this team and a lot about what a soft schedule the Tigers have played. And yet, the only real narrative fans have been able to grab onto through eight games is that Missouri is a decent team at home and an utter disaster any time it leaves the state.\n\nAt home, Missouri is 5-0 and has averaged 40.4 points a game. On the road, Missouri is 0-3 and has averaged 17.3 points.\n\nThough the Tigers are waiting to hear from the NCAA about whether a postseason ban for some years-ago academic violations will be rescinded, it\u2019s almost besides the point. The whole point for Missouri was to set itself up for meaningful games against the SEC East heavyweights in November, and instead we are talking about a team that trips all over itself at the sight of a visiting stadium.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to lose a season opener at Wyoming, where the altitude is tough and the environment is funky for a team playing its first game. But once you\u2019ve gotten rolling at 5-1 as Missouri did, there\u2019s absolutely no excuse to lose at Vanderbilt and Kentucky in back-to-back weeks.\n\nVanderbilt had been awful all season until Missouri came to town, and Kentucky is trying to reinvent itself with former receiver Lynn Bowden playing quarterback. This wasn\u2019t exactly facing LSU and Alabama at peak of their powers. And though Kentucky attempted just eight passes for the game in a driving rainstorm on Saturday, the Wildcats were able to rush for 297 yards in a 29-7 victory.\n\nIf that\u2019s all it takes for Missouri to fold up its tent on the road, it\u2019s an awful look for Barry Odom, an alum who has done a solid job overall but has underachieved spectacularly with this team. It\u2019s not always easy to win every game you\u2019re supposed to win in college football, but losing three ruins a season. And that\u2019s why the Tigers are No. 1 in the Misery Index, a weekly measurement of knee-jerk reactions based on what each fan base just watched.\n\nNot in misery:LSU up to No. 2 behind Alabama in Amway Coaches poll as Oklahoma, Notre Dame tumble\n\nFOUR MORE IN MISERY\n\nTexas: People who have spent significant time around Tom Herman will all tell you the same story. As intelligent and talented of a coach as he is, he doesn\u2019t wear particularly well. Football coaches do not need to be cuddly figures to succeed, but there is a baseline of likability that is necessary for players to respond the right way when it counts and for fans to excuse a run of less-than-stellar results. With Herman, it\u2019s worth wondering whether the most important people in this equation are already tiring of his act. Just this past week saw receiver Brennan Eagles no-show for a Tuesday practice without informing the coaches beforehand (and sat Saturday), freshman offensive lineman Javonne Shepherd enter the transfer portal and two four-star prospects announce decommitments. And all of that happened before a 37-27 loss to TCU on Saturday, which should raise some eyebrows. It\u2019s hard to be the smartest guy in the room when opposing quarterbacks are able to throw over the top of your defense again and again and again. It\u2019s hard to pull off adolescent arrogance when you\u2019ve got three losses heading into November. The biggest knock on Herman's record is clear: He is consistently able to coax high-level performances out of players when they're up against top opponents, but his teams are consistently flat and underwhelming in games where they have better personnel. If you\u2019re going to be good at Texas, the idea is to put a superior team on the field every week without needing to pull the emotional underdog card all the time.\n\nNebraska: If you root for a bad team college football, you see the disease before the symptoms. We\u2019ve known for awhile now that Nebraska is bad. It\u2019s been evident from the first week of the season, and fans have long since reached the acceptance stage. But it was only after the Huskers lost at home to Indiana, 38-31, that we heard second-year coach Scott Frost unload on his locker room for having too many players who don\u2019t care about being great and accept being \u201cjust OK.\u201d Oddly, he pointed to the fact that some of them came out for warmups at Minnesota two weeks ago wearing hoodies, claiming Nebraska players in his day would get \u201cridiculed or beat up\u201d for doing such a thing. \u201cI want guys who live and die for it and want to be great and are tough,\u201d Frost said. \u201cI don\u2019t want guys that go out at Minnesota with hoodies on and everything for warmups. That just says to me that just OK is enough.\u201d Well Scott, if you dislike your team so much, you better go recruit some new guys and get them on the field in a hurry. Because after the promising end to last season and all the hype that you helped feed into this year by talking about what a great offseason your team had, it\u2019s interesting how differently you view that locker room now that you\u2019re an unimpressive 4-4. Now that the truth is out there about the root cause of your problems, the finger is going to be pointed right back at you if you don\u2019t fix it soon.\n\nTulsa: After 59 minutes, 58 seconds, you could accurately say that Tulsa had outplayed Memphis on Saturday. Tulsa didn\u2019t lead on the scoreboard yet but had more yards (584 to 498), was plus-two in turnover margin and only needed a 29-yard field goal to pulling a big upset. But freshman kicker Jacob Rainey missed, hooking his kick left to preserve Memphis\u2019 42-41 win, which must be just an awful feeling no matter whether the stakes for a 2-6 Tulsa team are big or small at this point. And unfortunately for Tulsa, it\u2019s not the first time this season it\u2019s happened. Rainey also missed a 43-yarder in overtime against SMU a few weeks that would have ended the game, meaning Tulsa had it in their hands to beat the two AAC West favorites and improbably lost both. Coach Philip Montgomery said after the game he didn\u2019t second guess playing for the field goal rather than a touchdown, calling it a \u201cby the book\u201d situation given the time and score and position on the field. But at some point, you have to factor in scar tissue for the kicker \u2014 and maybe for the fanbase, too.\n\nMississippi State: When you\u2019re out of answers as a program, gimmicks are the last resort. And it sure looked gimmicky Saturday when the Bulldogs came out a half-hour before their game against Texas A&M, formed a circle at the goal line and appeared to perform a \u201cbull in the ring\" type drill where two players get in the middle and just go at each other. If that was intended to promote toughness, it sure didn\u2019t show up after kickoff as Mississippi State got thrashed 49-30 in College Station. Though freshman quarterback Garrett Shrader is an interesting prospect and an electric athlete, he was just 13-for-30 passing for 194 yards, collecting nine of those completions after the Bulldogs fell behind 35-10. The bottom line for Mississippi State fans, who got used to a certain standard of performance under Dan Mullen, is that Joe Moorhead hasn\u2019t lived up to his reputation as an offensive guru and is struggling to capitalize on the successful foundation his predecessor laid down. Mississippi State fans would love it if Rutgers brought Moorhead back to the Northeast where he\u2019s comfortable, but all the chatter about that possibility has faded noticeably the last couple weeks. More likely is Mississippi State looking at a 5-6 record heading into the Egg Bowl, which will be as pressurized a moment as he\u2019ll face in Starkville.\n\nTRENDING TOWARD MISERY\n\nMichigan State: At one point late in the first half against Penn State, ABC flashed a graphic that pointed out the Spartans hadn\u2019t scored a point since Oct. 5. While that maybe sounds worse than it is since it accounts for a bye week, it was still pretty bad \u2014 and continues to be bad for Michigan State, which was an offensive wreck again in a 28-7 loss at home. While horrible weather undoubtedly was a factor in the game, the Spartans committed four turnovers and had 265 yards of offense. That won\u2019t get it done against any opponent in any conditions, and we know it\u2019s not an anomaly because it's the same flavor of ineptitude we\u2019ve seen all season from the Spartans offense. It's not breaking news at this point that Mark Dantonio\u2019s decision not to make significant staff changes on offense has blown up on him, but it will continue to be a story as the season winds down and speculation ramps up about the uncertain future of this program.\n\nAuburn: Festivus has come early this year for Auburn fans. In the airing of grievances, they have many to choose from. It\u2019s Gus Malzahn\u2019s offense, which is letting down one of the best defensive units Auburn has ever put together. It's the punishing schedule, which doesn\u2019t allow for Auburn to catch its breath. It\u2019s the SEC officials, who missed some pretty blatant holding calls on the LSU offensive line in a 23-20 loss. It\u2019s the decision to play freshman quarterback Bo Nix rather than Joey Gatewood, who was the favorite to win the job coming into camp. Add it all up and you've got an Auburn team that might be top-10 in quality but has been reduced to spoiler coming down the stretch. The emotions of Auburn\u2019s fanbase run as hot and as cold as any in the country; so just as wins over Georgia and Alabama saved Malzahn's job two years ago, losses to those two teams this year to finish 8-4 could very well start the buyout rumors all over again.\n\nTexas Tech: No team in the country will lose in a more absurd manner this season than the Red Raiders against Kansas. Texas Tech had done the hard work necessary to keep the game going, blocking a 40-yard field goal with just a handful of seconds left that should have sent it to overtime. In fact, had Douglas Coleman just fallen on the ball when it landed in his arms, that's exactly what would have happened. But for some reason, Coleman tried to set up a return, saw that he wasn't going to get very far and pitched the ball backwards as if he expected a teammate to keep the play going. The only problem is that Texas Tech didn\u2019t have anyone in the area, so Kansas scooped up the fumble, got another chance and kicked a 32-yard field goal through as time expired for a 37-34 win. \u201cThe intentions were right,\u201d coach Matt Wells said. \u201cIt\u2019s a very, very unfortunate thing to see happen and to have to learn from.\u201d At least it\u2019s something nobody will ever forget.\n\nPurdue: Almost exactly a year ago, the Boilermakers experienced that magical night at Ross-Ade Stadium when everything came together for a 49-20 upset of Ohio State. It was a huge moment for a lot of reasons, but particularly because it intoxicated Purdue fans into believing anything was possible. That\u2019s why, when Louisville came after Jeff Brohm, Purdue ponied up for a seven-year, $36.8 million extension, making him one of the 10 highest-paid coaches in the country this season. But the only thing that money bought is financial security for Brohm, not any sustainable success at a traditionally difficult place to win. Purdue, in fact, is just 4-10 since that Ohio State game, proving how small the margin for error really is when you don\u2019t have the same advantages as other programs in the league. There\u2019s a lot of bad luck involved for Purdue, particularly on the injury front this season, but Saturday\u2019s 24-6 loss to Illinois pretty much ended any pretense that the Boilermakers could turn around their season.\n\nColorado: The week began with first-year coach Mel Tucker mangling a soundbite that went viral when he said, \u201cThere's no transfer portal in the real world\u201d in response to a couple of Colorado players deciding to leave the team. Of course, as many people subsequently pointed out, the entire professional world is one big transfer portal, including the coaching profession. As much as Tucker may have meant well in his other comments about the departures, that was an unnecessary misstep, and it brought national attention to Colorado for the wrong reasons. All that would have been forgotten had the Buffaloes been able to hold on against USC on Friday night in front of a national audience. Instead, they blew a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter and gave up a 37-yard touchdown with 2:15 left to lose, 35-31. After a 3-1 start, Colorado has lost four in a row.\n\nTOTALLY REAL AND IRRATIONAL MESSAGE BOARD THREADS\n\n\u201cAre we turning into a Maryland or Rutgers?\u201d - tigerboard.com (Missouri)\n\n\u201cMy family can not take another year of this\u201d - orangebloods.com (Texas)\n\n\u201cCan we notify Bama that we wish to forfeit the game on the 16th?\u201d - elitedawgs.com (Mississippi State)\n\n\u201cCall Tim Cook and get the 30 Mil ready\u201d - auburnundercover.com\n\n\u201cIn my 40 years as a Purdue fan, this is the worst football I\u2019ve ever seen\u201d - goldandblack.com", "description": "At home, Missouri's football team  is 5-0 and has averaged 40.4 points a\u00a0game.
