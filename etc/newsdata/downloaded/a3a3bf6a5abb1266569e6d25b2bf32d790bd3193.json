Bridgewater, Mass. native wasn\u2019t about to make any decisions to ride off into the sunset just yet.\n\nLauzon (28-15 MMA, 15-12 UFC) put on a clinic in the lightweight main-card bout, as he schooled the upstart before finishing him via TKO at 1:33 of the opening round.\n\n\u201cThis is my house,\u201d Lauzon told his adoring throng of fans. \u201cThis is my cage. I was not letting everyone come in here and push me around.\u201d\n\nIt was clear from the get-go Lauzon\u2019s striking was sharp. His jabs immediately found a home. He upped the tempo and eventually wobbled Pearce.\n\nLauzon clinched Pearce (9-4 MMA, 0-1 UFC), went for a trip, and got it after several attempts. From there, mounted on Pearce\u2019s back, he got his opponent into a half-nelson, where he rained down punches on his defenseless foe until referee Herb Dean waved things off.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s the last one, maybe it\u2019s not,\u201d Lauzon said. \u201cI\u2019m going to go home, be happy, and just kind of play with my kids.\u201d\n\nLauzon snapped a three-fight losing streak with his 26th career finish. Pearce, who was making his UFC debut, had a five-fight win streak snapped.\n\nGallery Joe Lauzon def.
