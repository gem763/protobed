But the havoc wrought by last decade\u2019s housing bubble has buyers wondering how to protect themselves if the market goes south.\n\nDrew and Jonathan Scott, co-hosts of the HGTV show \u201cProperty Brothers,\u201d offer simple real estate investment advice for the moment a market downturn approaches: Find the sweet spot between panic and patience.\n\n\u201cIf you are organized and you are keeping up on what's happening in the market and you're seeing indicators of what's going to happen, I think you can play it a little safer,\u201d Jonathan Scott told Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer.\n\n\u201cWhereas I think people all of a sudden freak out. They panic. They want to sell,\u201d he says.\n\nCautioning against the opposite miscalculation, Jonathan Scott adds: \u201cPeople who are affected the worst when something like that happens are the people who react too late.\u201d\n\nDrew and Jonathan Scott made the comments during a conversation that airs in an episode of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment.\n\nBorn in Vancouver, they came to prominence fixing up homes in HGTV reality series like \u201cProperty Brothers\u201d and \u201cBrother vs. Brother.\u201d Each week, 18 million people watch them in 160 countries; another 10 million follow them on social media. They\u2019ve capitalized with a line of home furnishings and a digital home-design service.\n\nDrew Scott, a co-host of HGTV's \"Property Brothers,\" appears on Influencers with Andy Serwer. More\n\nThe most precarious investors are those who stretch to afford a property outside of their budget, Jonathan Scott said.\n\n\u201cAnytime you make an excuse to buy a property, like, oh, well, maybe this isn't the best time, but I'm going to make it work, and you overleverage,\u201d he says. \u201cThat's when you lose your shirt.\u201d\n\nJonathan Scott\u2019s twin brother, Drew, offered similar warnings for those who overspend for a property that puts them in a tough financial position.\n\n\u201cWe work mainly with homeowners,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have their one big investment in their life, their home. But if they're not overleveraging to get into a new house, if the market's going up and down a little bit, well, you can protect yourself. You're only going to miss out if you're forced to sell.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, when the housing bubble burst, the Property Brothers escaped nearly unscathed, Jonathan Scott said.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of people who lost a lot of money,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were fortunate when the crash happened, at that time we only had one property left at the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe knew people who were picking up on housing and they lost out big, because they didn\u2019t have any of their own equity, it was all loans,\u201d he adds.\n\nYahoo Finance All Markets Summit More\n\nAndy Serwer is editor-in-chief of Yahoo Finance.
