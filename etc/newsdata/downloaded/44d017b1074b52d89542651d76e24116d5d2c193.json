In audio from the cockpit, the pilot explained that although the product is believed to be non-toxic, the crew required immediate assistance.\n\nHe said: \"We\u2019ve actually covered the container of the substance. It was a cleaning product that was used at London Heathrow, if you wait a moment I actually have a picture of the container that I have in a plastic bag.\n\n\"It was spilled and for some reason the container itself was left behind in the aircraft in one of the lavatories and continued to seep into the carpeting and produce what I\u2019m told is not, it is not a toxic substance.\n\n\"We require paramedics to come on board the airplane and render immediate assistance. We\u2019ve had two of our flight crew staff made, excuse me, the cabin staff have actually lost consciousness, but I think they\u2019re back to a state of consciousness just now and there are general complaints about burning eyes and skin problems.\"\n\nThe pilot added that the leaking product was an aircraft interior cleaner made by Callington, a leading specialty chemicals manufacturer.\n\nOne passenger told The Telegraph the plane had been delayed at Heathrow whilst reports of an \"unusual smell\" were investigated.\n\nHe said: \"Before take off the captain came on the loudspeaker saying the flight attendants had reported an unusual smell, and the flight was delayed while they investigated. They must've judged it safe because we flew out after, only to be rerouted to Dublin a short time later.\"\n\n@AmericanAir There aren't even chairs, we're not allowed to leave this area where we're penned in like cattle, and we've not been fed by the likes of you since boarding four plus hours ago. You're the worst. pic.twitter.com/PqnelJ2P2u \u2014 Philip Ott (@Blasphevism) October 21, 2019\n\nHe added that the flight's 287 passengers were \"penned in like cattle\" at Dublin airport before been taken by bus to stay overnight in a hotel. They have not been told when they can expect onward travel.\n\nAnother passenger expressed concern for others onboard, calling the incident a \"sickness outbreak\".\n\nOk, so this hasn\u2019t quite gone to plan. Chemical spillage has led to sickness outbreak and an emergency landing in Dublin. #firecrew#paramedics#police \u2014 Katie Phillips (@KatieHJP) October 21, 2019\n\nA statement released by American Airlines said: \"American Airlines flight 729 from London Heathrow to Philadelphia diverted to Dublin due to an odor caused by a spilled cleaning solution in the galley.\"\n\n\"The flight landed safely in Dublin at 1:15 p.m. local time, and taxied to the gate.\"\n\n\"Medical personnel have met the aircraft to evaluate any crew members or passengers who may need additional assistance.\"\n\nThe Telegraph has contacted Callington for comment.\n\nWant the best of The Telegraph direct to your email and WhatsApp?
