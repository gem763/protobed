October 10, 2019. (Mike Blake/Reuters)\n\nBilled an \"equality\" town hall, the CNN event was anything but.\n\nLGBT activists gathered last week for CNN\u2019s \u201cEquality\u201d town hall with the Democratic presidential candidates. The advocates present were, in the words of Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David, the \u201ctip of the spear in our fight for full equality.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cspear\u201d metaphor grew more apt as the night went on.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReligious freedom was the second-most-popular whipping post. The candidates talked about the concept with palpable derision, as if religion \u2014 save Islam, which they predictably if incoherently exempted \u2014 were a ruse used to cement old prejudices. No one actually believes those folksy things about God, heaven, and hell, right? Never considered was the notion that people hold earnest religious beliefs that in turn inform their views on sexual morality.\n\nThe town hall was also evidence that the LGBTQ movement has grown more jaded and contemptuous, even as it has achieved more and more of its ostensible aims. If conciliation was ever the preferred tone, it is no longer. Instead, it is now increasingly unashamed and vituperative scorn.\n\nHow would Elizabeth Warren, for instance, respond to someone on the campaign trail who said that they believed in the traditional definition of marriage? \u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna assume it\u2019s a guy who said that,\u201d she said. That elicited a laugh from the audience, men being the only acceptable punchline to the humorless scolds in the crowd. She continued, \u201cI\u2019m gonna say then just marry one woman. I\u2019m cool with that.\u201d Then, after a pause: \u201cIf you can find one.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Social science notwithstanding on that last jab.)\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke piled on further, affirming his belief that \u201cfreedom of religion is a fundamental right, but it should not be used to discriminate.\u201d\n\nYou are, in other words, \u201cfree\u201d to practice your religion, so long as you practice it in a manner that Beto O\u2019Rourke \u2014 the skateboard-wielding ex-congressman who posts videos of his dental visits on social media \u2014 sees fit. Some animals are more equal than others: O\u2019Rourke will be happy to \u201cdiscriminate\u201d against your church if it happens to hold an unpopular position on sexual ethics. He literally said so seconds later, when asked by Don Lemon if religious institutions should \u201close their tax-exempt status if they oppose same sex marriage.\u201d O\u2019Rourke\u2019s response:\n\nThere can be no reward, no benefit, no tax break for anyone, any institution, any organization in America that denies the full human rights and the full civil rights of every single one of us. And so as president, we are going to make that a priority and we are going to stop those who are infringing upon the human rights of our fellow Americans.\n\nWhat \u201chuman right\u201d are religious organizations \u201cinfringing upon\u201d when they \u201coppose\u201d same-sex marriage? Do people have a \u201ccivil right\u201d to have their sexual preferences validated by private religious organizations? Is there a \u201chuman right\u201d to have your particular sexual union baptized by religious traditions with centuries of contravening theological directives?\n\nPete Buttigieg took this same tack, insisting that \u201cthe right to religious freedom ends where religion is being used as an excuse to harm other people.\u201d Which of course depends entirely on what Buttigieg means by \u201charm.\u201d There is certainly \u201charm,\u201d for instance, in mutilating the genitals of a young girl \u2014 a more ecumenical venture than progressives care to admit \u2014 but does a baker\u2019s refusal to bake a cake that violates his religious convictions \u201charm other people\u201d? What if a church refuses to host a ceremony that offends its moral precepts? Does \u201creligious freedom end\u201d when someone refuses to grant moral approbation to someone else\u2019s choices and behavior?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, that was the Freudian subtext of the entire town hall. \u201cEquality?\u201d That has, even on activists\u2019 own terms, been long achieved. Notice, Alphonso David didn\u2019t simply want \u201cequality\u201d \u2014 whatever that means \u2014 but \u201cfull equality\u201d: your approval. Not simply your toleration, but your moral assent and your unhesitating affirmation. It\u2019s not enough to live and let live. You will, in Erick Erickson\u2019s words, \u201cbe made to care.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst, we were told that good sense held that we ought to allow two consenting adults to do as they wished in the privacy of their own bedroom. Fair enough \u2014 what business is it of ours? Next came civil unions. Fine. Then, marriage was redefined at a federal level on the basis of specious legal reasoning. Next, religious florists, bakers, and caterers were asked to violate their consciences and dragged before the courts if they declined. And now, at long last, the public exercise of religious faith, and the very belief itself, the very notion that one has rights to \u201coppose\u201d practices that violate their private conscience, are under siege.\n\nAll of which, we were told, would \u201cnever happen.\u201d As the town hall put on display, it\u2019s not for want of trying.", "description": "LGBT activists gathered last week for CNN\u2019s \u201cEquality\u201d town hall with the Democratic presidential candidates.", "authors": ["John Hirschauer", "John Mccormack", "Andrew C.
