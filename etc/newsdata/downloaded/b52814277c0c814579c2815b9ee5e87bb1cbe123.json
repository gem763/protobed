The fintech product has 20.5 million customers across a network of 176,000 agents.\n\nWhile these stats have put Safaricom in a coveted position, the company\u2019s former CEO Bob Collymore expressed concerns over the risk of too many eggs in one basket. For years, Collymore pressed his company to diversify product and revenue streams.\n\nThrough in-house development and partnerships, Safaricom added consumer and small business-based products, such as ride-hail app Little and website services, to its mobile and fintech network.\n\nIn 2017, Safaricom\u2019s Chief Innovation Officer and first head of Alpha, Kamal Bhattacharya echoed Collymore\u2019s mission to diversify the company\u2019s offerings.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d actually like to move beyond M-Pesa by leveraging its power as a social network to connect people to other product solutions,\u201d he told TechCrunch.\n\nBhattacharya \u2014 who\u2019d come to Safaricom after senior positions at IBM Research Africa and a stint restructuring Kenyan innovation center iHub \u2014 recruited a team for Alpha, led by founder and computer scientist Shikoh Gitau.\n\nFrom a market perspective, Alpha was something to watch since corporate incubators in Africa were (and continue to be) a relatively new component across the continent\u2019s tech ecosystem.\n\nIn a space purposely set up away from Safaricom\u2019s HQ, Alpha\u2019s team of innovators set to shaping new digital offerings.\n\nIn 2018, the incubator rolled out its first product, a social networking platform called Bonga, to augment M-Pesa.\n\nSince M-Pesa was already established as a commercial network, the idea was to amplify that by creating more social media type transactions around it \u2014 channeling Facebook, YouTube, iTunes, PayPal, and eBay in one platform.\n\nWith Bonga, Alpha appeared to have some momentum into 2018, before the innovation incubator lost two of its biggest backers.\n\nFirst, Kamal Bhattacharya, exited Safaricom and his position of lead of Alpha in October 2018. The reason given by the company was a bit of corporate say-nothing-speak: \u201cleaving to pursue other interests.\u201d\n\nThe real reasons for Bhattacharya\u2019s sudden exit were unclear. There was, however, plenty of scuttlebutt about powers within Safaricom \u2014 resistant to the brand of bureaucracy rattling change Alpha could bring \u2014 conspiring to push him out.\n\nAfter losing its head, Alpha lost another key ally in Bob Collymore when he passed away in July of this year after a fight with cancer.\n\nAlpha said farewell to another senior figure in August when Huston Malande left. It also rebranded Bonga to Zwuup this year \u2014 though Safaricom\u2019s last two annual reports don\u2019t indicate how the product has fared under either name, with no mention of Bonga, Zwuup, or Alpha.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for Alpha?\n\nSeveral sources close to Safaricom (speaking on background) expressed doubt that it would have the support within the company to continue with Collymore\u2019s passing.\n\nOne source suggested Alpha would more likely be morphed into the larger Safaricom bureaucracy rather than shut down completely, to avoid negative news that an abrupt closure would bring.\n\nTechCrunch asked Safaricom directly on the future of Alpha, and specifically if it would confirm or deny reports the innovation incubator could shutdown. A Safaricom spokesperson said it could not comment on anything related to Alpha\u2019s products or performance before Safaricom\u2019s next earnings reporting, scheduled for November 1.\n\nSo Kenya\u2019s tech community will have to wait a couple more weeks to see if Safaricom sticks to its experiment to spur inside innovation by creating an outside incubator \u2014 or not.", "description": "Safaricom\u2019s Nairobi based Alpha innovation incubator may have an uncertain future, according to sources.
