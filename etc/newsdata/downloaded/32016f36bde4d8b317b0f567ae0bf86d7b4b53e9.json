Back in June, Facebook announced that they would be playing their hand in the cryptocurrency field, stating that they would be working with financial services companies like Visa V, PayPal PYPL, and others. The news of the social media giant\u2019s latest endeavor was initially received with acclaim from Wall Street as some analysts even went as far as to say that Facebook\u2019s new initiative could become a worldwide currency. However, as of late, the project has decelerated as questions surrounding the continued participation of the financial services companies have surfaced.\n\nProject Libra Losing Steam\n\nA few days ago, news hit that Mastercard MA and other financial partners that agreed to help build and maintain project Libra\u2019s payment network were reconsidering their involvement in the project. The announcement comes on the heels of US and European countries taking more stringent measures against the development of the project. Bruno Le Maire, France\u2019s finance minister, said the Libra project would lead to \u201can eventual privatization of money, replacing weaker currencies in countries around the world and undermining states\u2019 sovereign independence.\u201d\n\nThe finance minister went on to comment that \u201cThese are serious concerns, and under these conditions, we can\u2019t authorize Libra\u2019s development on European soil.\u201d The financial companies who were signed on to help develop the project are now warry of attracting regulatory scrutiny. Major defections could hurt the project as Facebook\u2019s attempt to persuade consumers to swap their national currencies for a digital coin may become compromised. Regulatory scrutiny is the last thing Facebook needs as their reputation and practices have come under question as federal agencies investigate the company.\n\nPayPal announced that they would be withdrawing themselves from project Libra. The financial services firm stated, \u201cPayPal has made the decision to forgo further participation in the Libra Association at this time and to continue to focus on advancing our existing mission and business priorities as we strive to democratize access to financial services for underserved populations.\u201d This is definitely not a good look for Facebook as they are now scrambling to keep the remaining financial companies on board.\n\nTakeaway\n\nFor the time being it seems that Project Libra is in trouble of falling out with more of its corporate backers as it continues to face scrutiny from regulators. Regulators have serious concerns about the privacy of the project as well as the financial stability of the potential currency. Facebook has already said that investors had nothing to worry about as the company wouldn\u2019t have unilateral control of the currency but to no avail. Wall Street will have its eyes set on how the matter unfolds in the coming days.\n\nJust Released: Zacks\u2019 7 Best Stocks for Today\n\n\n\nExperts extracted 7 stocks from the list of 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys that has beaten the market more than 2X over with a stunning average gain of +24.6% per year.\n\n\n\nThese 7 were selected because of their superior potential for immediate breakout.\n\n\n\nSee these time-sensitive tickers now >>\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
