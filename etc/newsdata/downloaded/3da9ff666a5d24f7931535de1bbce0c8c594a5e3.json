Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley said Brooks was OK and was not seriously injured.\n\n\u201cKennedy Brooks is good,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWe're lucky because it was a bad, bad play. Coach Wells was classy about it. He felt about it what I would've felt about it. We were lucky he wasn't hurt worse, because he could've been.\u201d\n\nHoward recorded three tackles in the game, including a sack. He apologized for the hit in a post on social media.\n\nAUBURN TIGERS RUNNING BACK ACCIDENTALLY FALLS INTO MISSISSIPPI STATE DOG MASCOT\n\n\u201cObviously, my personal foul has been receiving a lot of attention through social media,\" he wrote. \"During the play, I thought my player (ball carrier) had the corner and I tried to help by laying down a block. However, I had already launched when the ball carrier had stepped out of bounds.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I truly felt like it was a \u2018bang bang\u2019 play. But it's easy to build your own perception with a remote in your hand. The block was illegal and could easily be viewed as \u2018dirty,\u2019 without a doubt. But I can assure you it wasn't intentional. There is a fine line between playing hard and playing safe. Sadly, I put another player in harms way and I accept full responsibility, this game is violent enough, let alone with an illegal hit.\"\n\nHe added: \u201cPlayers need to take care of each other. I was told he was able to walk off the field and I pray there isn't a significant injury. With this being said, I would like to apologize to Coach Wells and the rest of the Texas Tech program. This is not the playing style he coaches or accepts. I did not represent my university well. Also, I would like to apologize to the player I hit illegally and again I truly hope he is okay. I hope y'all can forgive me.
