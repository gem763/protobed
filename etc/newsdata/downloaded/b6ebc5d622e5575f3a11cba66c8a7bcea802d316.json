Although the Egyptian was just eating up the open space in front of him in that ominous manner that usually preludes a precise finish, Kante got around him, nicked the ball and won it.\n\nDanger averted. Again.\n\nThis might have been typical Kante, but it emphasises an untypical situation, and is now of far more importance than one missed opportunity.\n\nIt is because the way Chelsea play means they are going to offer up that specific opportunity a lot. It's already been repeatedly illustrated this season.\n\nAnd there\u2019s going to be a lot of onus on Kante to cut them out. It\u2019s just as well he\u2019s capable of it, but may have lead to a situation even he seemed incapable of.\n\nIt may well reflect how his importance to a team has actually only grown - and this isn\u2019t even down the fact he is the only prime world-class player left after the departure of Eden Hazard. It is because he is so fundamental to Lampard\u2019s entire tactical plan.\n\nThere is an argument that it would be impossible to properly apply without him.\n\nKante, after all, essentially represents the totality of his manager\u2019s defensive plan too.\n\nHe is certainly the sole truly defensive part in a midfield shape, that - just like at Derby County - is inevitably going to give up a lot of space in behind due to the emphasis on high pressing.\n\nKante, however, is pretty much the perfect player to fill that space. He\u2019s maybe the only player who can fill this space, or at least does it to that level.\n\nHis very presence just instantly solves so many problems.\n\nThat maybe even means that, relative to his team and how they play, he is now the most important player in the Premier League. Or at least the equal of Virgil van Dijk.\n\nThey are the only players who feel so uniquely crucial to their side\u2019s approach, where it just wouldn\u2019t work in the same way without them; where there is no possible alternative. They're that distinctive. That good.\n\nLampard\u2019s approach has thereby already emphasised Kante\u2019s qualities even more. That relentless running, harrying and ball-winning has somehow become even more important.\n\nAnd there was even more to his game here, because that running similarly set a greater tempo for Chelsea in the second half. It wasn\u2019t just that Kante was filling gaps, it was that he was forcing them in the opposition. The rest of the Chelsea team started to rise to his level. The pressing intensified. It was from that, and that improved spell, that he scored a deserved goal.\n\nEven for Kante, though, it\u2019s impossible to fill every gap. Chelsea still have problems at set-pieces, which basically lost them this game.\n\nWithout Kante, though, they could have lost by far more. He, more than anyone else, ensured they were still in it. That\u2019s what Lampard insisted at half-time.\n\nIt was partly based on the persistence of Kante.\n\nIt means he may somehow have become even more important than ever.", "description": "There was a particular moment in Chelsea\u2019s loss to Liverpool that made little different to the end result, but may end up reflecting a considerable difference in the former\u2019s season.", "authors": ["Miguel Delaney"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/23/07/kante-chelsea.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
