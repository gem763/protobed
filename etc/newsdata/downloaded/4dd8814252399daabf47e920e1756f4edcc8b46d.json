Guy,s please get down to the doctors and get tested, It's a rotten disease. Finger up the bum, no harm done.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nPenny said there was \"no slowing\" Rod down after thankfully being given the all clear.\n\nExplaining why they kept it quiet, Penny said: \"It was our choice to come out [with the news], as it were. Rod was performing at a prostate cancer event with the Faces.\n\n\"After a few songs he said, \u2018Hi everyone, thank you so much for coming and I have to just take this moment, I owe it to everyone, I\u2019m a survivor\u2019.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"In July he got the all clear, there\u2019s no trace at all \u2013 he just wanted to give a message out to all men, especially over 50, you can actually go and request to get a PSA blood test. Which will give you a little indication, it\u2019s not a sure result.\n\n\"But if there\u2019s a sign that the readings are elevated, and if it\u2019s the case you can have further examinations rectally, which is an awkward thing for men to talk about.\n\n\"Men don\u2019t get an offer to come in, you can request it. Really that should move.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nPenny explained that Rod have a few symptoms and moved quickly to go and see a specialist, who found a lump that could not be ignored.\n\nShe said: \"It was [quite aggressive]. It came on really quickly. With Rod it was an aggressive one. It left the gland and travelled to the outside tissues.\n\n\"So that was another scary moment where we had to have more invasive tests and scans to see if it was anywhere else secondary in his body, which was the most frightening test of all. But it hadn\u2019t gone.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nEmotional Penny then broke down in tears, admitting it was obvious she was going to get upset discussing her husband's cancer struggle.\n\nShe tearfully continued: \"It\u2019s emotional. We kept it quiet for two and a half years now. The positive news is we caught it early enough.\"\n\nOn telling their children, she said: \"We told the older ones\u2026 It would be too much for them [the younger ones] to understand.\n\n\"When daddy finally told everybody the good news, and to get the message out there for guys out there over 50 go and get the test, then we told the little ones.\"\n\n*Loose Women airs weekdays on ITV at 12.30pm", "description": "Emotional Penny had some positive news about Rod, who sent an inspiring video message in calling for men to get tested for prostate cancer", "authors": ["Kyle O'Sullivan", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20552662.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Loose-Women-Penny-and-Rod.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
