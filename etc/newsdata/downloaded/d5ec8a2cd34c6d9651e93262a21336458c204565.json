Responding to the backlash, Kmart then decided to pull the costume from its shelves.\n\nAsk Kmart to remove child bride costume from its shelves \u2013 Sign the Petition! https://t.co/2V4raCTcp3 via @ChangeAUS \u2014 David Hill (@davidmhill) October 22, 2019\n\nOn the Change.org petition, Sharon wrote: \u2018One-third of girls in the developing world are married before the age of 18 and 1 in 9 are married before the age of 15.\n\n\u2018Child marriage means child abuse and torture in its worst forms: pedophilia, child slavery, child sex trafficking. Kmart \u2014 take this child bride costume off your shelves.\u2019\n\nIn response, Kmart wrote: \u2018Kmart Australia regrets the decision to range the bride costume. It was not intended to cause offense and we sincerely apologize. We have made the decision to withdraw this product.\u2019\n\nBut some people on social media didn\u2019t see the fuss. One person wrote: \u2018What is wrong with a little girl wanting to dress up as a bride? Is it wrong for a girl to aspire to be a bride? I was under the impression that girls could be anything they wanted to be.\u2019\n\nAnother echoed the thoughts saying: \u2018It is sad those things happen, but my daughters used to dress up and pretend to get married all the time. There\u2019s NOTHING wrong with it.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome did agree with Shannon, saying: \u2018I agree on the recall for a child bride costume. It is not acceptable. How sad it is that society has become so desensitized that they can\u2019t see the forest for the trees.\u2019\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nMORE: \u2018Sexist\u2019 clothing line told boys to \u2018ride bikes\u2019 and girls to \u2018pick flowers\u2019\n\nMORE: Outrage at \u2018sexist\u2019 clothing line with rainbows for girls and trains for boys\n\nMORE: People aren\u2019t impressed by these \u2018sexist\u2019 cards that say flowers are for girls and sandwiches are for boys\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The white dress that comes with a veil is aimed at little girls aged between four and six was being sold at Kmart Australia for $6 (\u00a33.19).", "authors": ["Faima Bakar"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_93239824_1572277937.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
