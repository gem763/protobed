Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) speaks during a news conference. She recently sent a second letter to Jessie K. Liu, U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, to ask about a decline in hate-crime prosecutions. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post)\n\nIncensed by what she described as an inadequate response to a record number of hate crimes, Washington\u2019s lone member of Congress has doubled down in her attempt to find out why the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the District of Columbia isn\u2019t keeping pace.\n\nFor a second time this summer, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) sent a letter to Jessie K. Liu, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, demanding answers.\n\nIn both letters, the congresswoman asked for information on hate crime prosecutions with particular regard to attacks against the LGBTQ community.\n\n\u201cHer office, particularly when contrasted with U.S. attorney\u2019s offices before her, has been asleep on the job,\u201d Norton said in an interview Tuesday.\n\nAccording to a Washington Post analysis of police and court records, hate crime prosecutions in the nation\u2019s capital have plunged to their lowest point in more than 10 years \u2014 even as the number of people arrested on charges of hate-motivated attacks has skyrocketed.\n\n[Hate crime reports have soared in D.C. Prosecutions have plummeted.]\n\n\n\nU.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Jessie K. Liu answers questions from the media during a news conference on Feb. 6 in Washington. (Salwan Georges/The Washington Post)\n\nLast year in the District, police investigated 204 attacks as being bias-motivated and made arrests in 59 hate crime cases. But the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the District of Columbia, which handles most criminal cases in the city, only prosecuted three as hate crimes. One was ultimately dropped.\n\n\u201cI am concerned about the low prosecution rates by your office compared to those of other cities,\u201d Norton wrote in the letter sent Thursday. \u201cI would like an explanation for the very high declination rate for hate crime prosecutions by your office and whether these declination decisions stemmed from a lack of resources or from other causes.\u201d\n\nNorton initially contacted Liu in July, following a meeting with members of the LGBTQ community as residents told her they feel \u201cunder siege,\u201d she said.\n\n[D.C. hate crimes: Inside a record year of hatred in the nation\u2019s capital]\n\nWhen she didn\u2019t hear back, Norton said, she followed up with a phone call. Then, last week, she wrote another letter.\n\n\u201cApparently, the District has had more hate crimes than any other jurisdiction in the United States,\u201d Norton said Tuesday. \u201cWhat is happening here? Who are these people who are doing this? Why is it increasing at this time?\u201d\n\nLiu\u2019s office didn\u2019t respond Tuesday to a request for comment.\n\nLiu, who took office two years ago, promised local activists that \u201cas a woman of color,\u201d she would take hate crimes seriously. Last month, she released a statement defending her record: \u201cWe provide every potential case with a hate crimes enhancement with the careful attention and commitment it deserves.\u201d\n\nAt a community meeting last month, Liu announced her office had added a second hate crimes coordinator to ensure cases were appropriately prosecuted.\n\n\u201cThe fact that there are more reported hate-bias crimes has definitely not gone unnoticed in our office,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of conversations about it in recent weeks, thinking about how we can revamp our efforts and resources to address it.\u201d\n\nNorton said that\u2019s not good enough.\n\n\u201cAt this point the only thing to make them feel safer, I think, is to see some prosecutions,\u201d she said.\n\nThe District\u2019s Bias-Related Crime Act allows judges to enhance certain crimes by increasing their possible sentences up to 50 percent if the crime is found to have been committed based on a victim\u2019s age, race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability or political affiliation, among other factors.\n\nMembers of the D.C. area\u2019s \u00adLGBTQ community have felt vulnerable after a summer of violence that included transgender women being attacked and killed; a gun scare at the Capital Pride parade that sent hundreds running in a panic; a stabbing inside a gay bar in Dupont Circle that left three people wounded; and a gay couple leaving a bar on U Street being robbed and beaten by a group who hurled homophobic slurs at them.\n\nRead more:\n\nD.C. ranks No. 7 on list of the world\u2019s safest large cities\n\nRents are rising, and neighborhoods are changing.
