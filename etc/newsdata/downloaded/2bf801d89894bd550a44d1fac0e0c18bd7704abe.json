(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)\n\nAssociated Press\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump's decision to abandon the Kurds in Syria to a Turkish invasion sends a dangerous message to US allies.\n\nThe Kurds played a key role in the fight against ISIS, losing thousands of fighters in the process.\n\nBy withdrawing US troops from northeastern Syria, Trump has given a greenlight to Turkey to launch a military invasion in the region. Turkey views Kurdish forces as a threat.\n\nThe Trump administration made the announcement overnight and began withdrawing troops by Monday morning.\n\nPrior to this, it had urged Kurdish forces to dismantle defensive positions along the Syria-Turkey border with assurances it would not allow a Turkish military operation.\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle and former US officials say the decision tells allies the US does not have their back, even when they \"shed blood\" on its behalf.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's decision to abandon the Kurds by withdrawing US troops in northeastern Syria gives a greenlight to Turkey to launch a military operation there and sends a dangerous message to US allies that they could be abandoned at a moment's notice despite promises and sacrifices made.\n\nThe Trump administration abruptly made the announcement on Sunday after the president spoke with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the phone, and US troops began pulling out of the region by Monday morning, according to witnesses cited by The New York Times.\n\nThe Kurds have been a key ally and bore the brunt of the US-campaign against ISIS.\n\nAlong these lines, a spokesperson for the the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which occupies northeastern Syria, described the move as a \"stab in the back\" after previously receiving \"assurances from the US that it would not allow any Turkish military operations against the region.\"\n\nThe US urged the SDF it to dismantle defensive positions on the Syrian side of the border that served as a deterrent to a Turkish military operation, with the promise that the US would not greenlight any such incursion. The Kurds followed through on this, but the US did not.\n\nErdogan views the Kurdish forces as a threat \u2014 with a specific animus toward the leading fighting force in the SDF, the Syrian Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG). The YPG are a fierce group of warriors, but they're outmatched by Turkey's military.\n\nThe YPG has close ties to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which the Turkish government views as a terrorist organization. Since the mid-1980s, the PKK has waged a violent campaign against the Turkish government as part of a broader effort to establish an independent Kurdish state within Turkey. Based on its association with the PKK, the YPG is seen as a terrorist affiliate by the Turkish government, even as it played a central role in crushing ISIS's so-called caliphate.\n\nThe Kurds now face a potential massacre, and the SDF on its official Twitter account made clear how betrayed it feels. The SDF added that it lost 11,000 fighters in the campaign against ISIS, going on to say \"we are determined to defend our land at all costs.\"\n\nTweet Embed:\n\n//twitter.com/mims/statuses/1181047356009123840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\n(2)\n\nBut Erdogan's threats are aimed to change the security mechanism into a mechanism of death, displace our people & change the stable & secure region into a zone of conflict and permanent war.\n\nCorrespondingly, one Syrian Kurdish official told NBC News: \"The Americans are traitors. They have abandoned us to a Turkish massacre. We can no longer fight against ISIS and have to defend ourselves. This could allow ISIS to return to the region.\"\n\n'We must always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back'\n\nTrump's move to pull US troops from northeastern Syria falls in line with his isolationist \"America First\" philosophy, but goes against the advice of senior Pentagon and intelligence officials. When Trump in December announced plans to withdraw US troops from Syria, it prompted the resignation of James Mattis as secretary of defense and the widespread backlash ultimately led the president to pump the brakes on pulling out.\n\nHis decision to move forward now has catalyzed similar criticism and outcry, including from former administration officials who warn about the implications for other US partnerships.\n\nRead more: Trump defended his controversial decision to pull US forces out of Syria in a rambling tweetstorm\n\nTrump's former US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley on Monday tweeted, \"We must always have the backs of our allies, if we expect them to have our back. The Kurds were instrumental in our successful fight against ISIS in Syria. Leaving them to die is a big mistake. #TurkeyIsNotOurFriend.\"\n\nSimilarly, Trump's former top envoy in the fight against ISIS, Brett McGurk, excoriated Trump on the decision.\n\nMcGurk in a tweet said, \"Donald Trump is not a Commander-in-Chief. He makes impulsive decisions with no knowledge or deliberation. He sends military personnel into harm's way with no backing. He blusters and then leaves our allies exposed when adversaries call his bluff or he confronts a hard phone call.\"", "description": "President Donald Trump's decision to abandon the Kurds sends a dangerous message to US allies that they could be abandoned at a moment's notice.", "authors": ["John Haltiwanger"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/KOUyHvl2kmF6g035LNgKKQ--~B/aD0xMjAwO3c9MjQwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/18c339b8bc964739ff7705c2f2375deb", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
