That fault has been relatively quiet for 500 years, but now has begun slowly creeping, according to a new study released in the journal Science.\n\nRelated: Thirty years after devastating quake, is San Francisco ready for the next?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s surprising,\u201d Zachary Ross, assistant professor of geophysics at Caltech and lead author of the paper, said. \u201cIn California, we\u2019ve been monitoring earthquakes for a long time. We think we have a pretty good sense of what typical behavior is over long timescales \u2026 and then when something happens that\u2019s anomalous, that obviously stands out.\n\n\u201cWe just don\u2019t know what this could mean,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Ridgecrest earthquake sequence was the largest in two decades in southern California and began 4 July in the Mojave desert about 120 miles (190km) north of Los Angeles. After a magnitude 6.4 foreshock, there was a magnitude 7.1 mainshock the next day, followed by more than 100,000 aftershocks.\n\nThe Garlock fault is capable of producing a magnitude 8 quake and has slipped 0.8in (2cm) since July, the study by geophysicists from the California Institute of Technology and Nasa\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory found. It moved over a large enough length of the fault that radar satellite in space detected it, Ross said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen this fault do that before,\u201d Ross said, emphasizing that it was impossible to speculate what the movement could mean for future hazard.\n\nThe study also found that the Ridgecrest sequence involved ruptures on a web of interconnected faults. The researchers noted that while major earthquakes are commonly thought to be caused by the rupture of a single long fault, seismologists have since been rethinking that model.\n\nThe Ridgecrest sequence involved about 20 previously undiscovered faults crisscrossing, providing another example of how large earthquakes can be generated by a weblike network of smaller \u201cfaults that, when they rupture, trigger one another like falling dominoes\u201d, the authors said.\n\nThis means, seismologists may have to rethink how they quantify potential hazards and define faults, said Ross: \u201cIt injects a lot more uncertainty \u2026 It\u2019s hard to come up with all the different possible scenarios where tiny faults activate together to produce some event \u2026 There\u2019s an infinite number of combinations.\u201d\n\nThe study was published on the 30th anniversary of the deadly magnitude 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake that badly damaged the San Francisco Bay Area and the same day that California implemented a statewide earthquake early warning system for the public.\n\nAlerts previously were made available to schools, government agencies, industries and industries but not the general public, except in Los Angeles county, where an app-based system has been in use since January.", "description": "Ruptures in Ridgecrest sequence ended a few miles from the Garlock fault, which is slowly creeping, says studyA local resident inspects a fissure in the earth after an earthquake struck the area near Ridgecrest, California, on 4 July.
