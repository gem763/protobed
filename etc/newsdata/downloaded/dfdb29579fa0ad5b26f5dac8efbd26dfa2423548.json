However, it is laying the foundation to increase sales in China to two million vehicles per year, Reuters reported last year.\n\nToyota in April said it had started supplying fuel-cell parts to Chinese commercial vehicle makers Beiqi Foton Motor Co Ltd and Beijing SinoHytec Co Ltd. In July it said it would supply key hydrogen fuel-cell parts to Chinese automakers FAW and Higer Bus.\n\nToyota will also share resources and talent to develop \"intelligent connected\" vehicles with GAC and FAW.", "description": "Toyota to develop hydrogen fuel cars with Chinese partners FAW, GAC", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8P1AN_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
