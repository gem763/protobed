And I said no. I said listen you'd been there for, I believe it was 12 years, and I said no. And it has since been proven that I was right. Plus we have numerous witnesses to it. I interviewed numerous people that day and he was one of the numerous people,' Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\nMueller served as head of the bureau from September 2001 to September 2013. He was appointed to the job by President George W. Bush and President Barack Obama extended his 10-year term by two years.\n\n'Robert Mueller wanted the job to be director. I turned him - very nicely, very respectively - down,' Trump said.\n\nHe also said he had no idea Mueller would be appointed special counsel the next day.\n\n'Absolutely not. I had no idea he was doing that,' Trump said.\n\nTrump has argued such a conflict of interest should have prevented Mueller from heading up the investigation into him.\n\nDonald Trump claimed Robert Mueller 'absolutely wanted to become FBI director' when the two men met in the Oval Office in May 2017\n\nEarlier in the day, the president touted a claim that Mueller lied to Congress when he said he was not interviewed for FBI director amid claims he was going to be appointed special counsel in the Russia investigation.\n\nThe president cited a report from Fox News, which claimed that then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Mueller were having conversations about the special counsel position before Mueller met in the Oval Office with Trump.\n\n''Bob Mueller was pursuing the FBI Director job when he met with President Trump in 2017, Administration officials say.' @FoxNews Bret Baier and Jake Gibson @seanhannity This is true even though Mueller denied it!,' Trump tweeted on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe president has argued Mueller should have told him in their May 16, 2017 meeting that he was in discussions about being appointed special counsel.\n\nOther critics have gone further saying that it gave Mueller an opportunity to gather evidence against Trump in the Oval Office without the president knowing.\n\nDonald Trump touted a claim that Robert Mueller lied to Congress when he said he was not interviewed for FBI director\n\nTrump argues Robert Mueller was being interviewed for the FBI job during their Oval Office meeting but Mueller told lawmakers he was giving 'input' about the position. Fox News now reports that Rod Rosenstein had already asked him if he was willing to serve as special counsel\n\nTrump had fired James Comey as FBI director a week before, an event that would trigger an investigation into Russia's role in the 2016 election and whether the president obstructed that probe.\n\nMueller's final report cleared the Trump campaign of collusion with Russia but made no judgement on the obstruction charge.\n\nBut he noted his team worked with the understanding that long-standing Justice Department policy was not to indict a sitting president.\n\n'If we had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said that. We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime,' he said in his first public statement on his report. 'A president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office.'\n\nTimeline of special counsel appointment May 9, 2017: President Trump fires James Comey as FBI director May 10, 2017: Aide for Rod Rosenstein emails Robert Mueller's law firm, WilmerHale to arrange a meeting on May 12 'anytime before 10 a.m.' Mueller's assistant responds: 'Can we do it at 8 a.m.?' May 12, 2017: Rosenstein emails Mueller using the subject line 'I assume you realize': 'The boss and his staff do not know about our discussions' May 13, 2017: Mueller emails Rosenstein: 'Rod if you have a moment would you please give me a call.' May 16, 2017: Mueller meets Trump in the Oval Office. He also visits Rosenstein in the Department of Justice. Rosenstein emails Mark Filip, a former deputy attorney general and says: 'I am with Mueller. He shares my view. Duty calls. Sometimes the moment chooses us.' May 17, 2017: Rosenstein appoints Mueller special counsel. He informs the White House only a short time in advance. Officials there are said to be blindsided June 13, 2017: CNN report that a White House official says Mueller was interviewed to be FBI director June 7, 2017: Christopher Wray is appointed FBI Director June 14, 2017: First report that Mueller is investigating Trump personally for obstruction of justice\n\nAttorney General William Barr and Rosenstein decided not to pursue the charge, citing that DoJ policy.\n\nThe Fox News report that Trump referenced in his tweet cited emails from Rosenstein, which were released by the watchdog group Judicial Watch after it made a Freedom of Information Act request for Rosenstein's correspondence from May 8, 2017 to May 22, 2017 - the time frame when Trump fired Comey and Rosenstein appointed Mueller special counsel.\n\nOn May 12, after Comey was fired but before Mueller had met with Trump or was appointed special counsel, Rosenstein emailed Mueller using the subject line 'I assume you realize' and wrote: 'The boss and his staff do not know about our discussions.'\n\nThere was no context provided as to what the discussions were about and the tidbit appeared at the bottom of a chain of four emails between Mueller and Rosenstein.\n\nThe only response from Mueller show in the emails was his May 13 reply, where he wrote: 'Rod if you have a moment would you please give me a call.'\n\nThe two men arranged a time to talk. The emails do not make clear if they did or not.\n\nThe 'boss' that Rosenstein referred to is likely then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who had recused himself from the Russia investigation, leaving Rosenstein in charge.\n\nSessions was removed from his post after the 2018 election. His tenure was marked by his choppy relationship with Trump, who raged over the fact Sessions had recused himself from the Russia probe.\n\nOn May 10, an aide for Rosenstein emailed Mueller's law firm, WilmerHale to arrange a meeting on May 12 'anytime before 10 a.m.' Mueller's assistant responds: 'Can we do it at 8 a.m.?'\n\nThe meeting was set for that Friday - five days before Rosenstein named Mueller special counsel.\n\nFox News reported, citing a source close to Rosenstein, reported that the then-deputy attorney general had confidential conversations with Mueller about whether he would be willing to serve as special counsel in the event he needed to appoint one. The report also said that\n\nThese conversations began on May 12, 2017, prior to Mueller's Oval Office meeting with the president on May 16, 2017, the source told the network.\n\nOn May 16, Rosenstein emailed Mark Filip, a former deputy attorney general, and said: 'I am with Mueller. He shares my view. Duty calls. Sometimes the moment chooses us.'\n\nThat was the day Mueller met Trump. Mueller met Rosenstein that day too.\n\nTrump found out about Mueller's appointment the following day, May 17 just before it was publicly announced.\n\nHe was told by then-White House counsel Don McGahn that Rosenstein had signed a memo appointing Mueller to the position. Officials in the White House were said to be blindsided by the move.\n\nTrump claims the sit-down was a job interview for Mueller to head the FBI, a position he had held from September 2001 to September 2013.\n\nBut Mueller told the House Judiciary Committee in his July testimony he was giving 'input' about the position and not interviewing for it.\n\n'My understanding I was not applying for that job, I was asked to give my input on what it would take to do the job,' he said.\n\n'I interviewed with the president and it was about the job and not about me applying for the job,' he added.\n\nTrump, however, has repeatedly claimed it was a job interview and there were numerous witnesses to it.\n\n'It has been reported that Robert Mueller is saying that he did not apply and interview for the job of FBI Director (and get turned down) the day before he was wrongfully appointed Special Counsel' the president tweeted the day Mueller testified on Capitol Hill.\n\n'Hope he doesn't say that under oath in that we have numerous witnesses to the interview, including the Vice President of the United States!'\n\nNone of those alleged witnesses have spoken publicly about witnessing such an interview.\n\nTrump did interview other possible candidates for the FBI role. He appointed Christopher Wray, a former DOJ prosecutor, in June 2017.\n\nMueller's original charge was to investigate 'links and/or coordination' between officials from the Russia government and members of Trump's 2016 campaign but he was also given leeway to examine 'any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation' - which led to the obstruction of justice probe.\n\nA total of thirty-four individuals and three companies were indicted by Mueller's investigators. Eight have pleaded guilty to or been convicted of felonies, including five Trump associates.\n\nAdditionally, dozens of ongoing investigations originally handled by the special counsel's office were forwarded to district and state prosecutors.\n\nAfter concluding his work as special counsel, Mueller rejoined his old law firm WilmerHale earlier this month.\n\nROD ROSENSTEIN'S MUELLER EMAILS", "description": "Donald Trump claimed Robert Mueller 'absolutely wanted to become FBI director' when the two men met in the Oval Office in May 2017 but the president turned him down.", "authors": ["Emily Goodin", "U.S. Politcal Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/18/19502556-0-image-a-46_1570640969097.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
