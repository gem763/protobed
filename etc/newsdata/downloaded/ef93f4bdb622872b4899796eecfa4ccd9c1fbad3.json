That it's pretty much Halloween? That it basically has been since, like, September 1? Related: Disney has been ready for the holiday for weeks now and is really blowing it out of the water this year. Exhibit A: these darling, Halloween-themed dome cakes.\n\nAmorette's Patisserie has two of them, but let's start with the sweeter of the two. The Pumpkin Minnie Cake you see before you is more complex than she may seem. Bakers start by dousing a lemon chiffon cake (that holds white chocolate mousse) (and strawberry crisp pearls) (and strawberry pat de fruit) with vanilla Italian meringue buttercream. Once that's smoothed out and even more frosting is added, bakers go to town pouring a bright orange mirror glaze all over the entire dome.\n\nPhoto credit: Chelsea Lupkin More\n\nBlack fondant is rolled out and cut into jack-o-lantern-shaped features and placed gingerly to form her face. Voila! Pumpkin Minnie.\n\nPLAN A TRIP tripadvisor.com\n\nAs for your spookier option, Frankenstein Mickey is the scarier alternative. He's made very similarly, though, with buttercream covering a white chocolate ice cream mousse. Then, of course, comes the neon green mirror glaze.\n\nAs you can see, his decorations are a bit more complicated. More black fondant becomes his hair, and he has not only a crooked mouth, but also, white chocolate screws nailed in to either side of his head.\n\nFind it all only at Amorette's Patisserie in Orlando's Disney Springs.\n\n\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "They're mesmerizing to see come together.", "authors": ["Tess Koman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/wCQFYF73jj.X.mjQvFw5Zg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/delish_597/56e293b3acd369ebd9d55fca6e3a70e0", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
