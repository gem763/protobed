The money the banks borrow is not all secured at rates that go up or down in step with the RBA\u2019s announcements. In particular, some of it is borrowed from overseas. The Treasurer knows this.\n\nThe banks should make this clear every time they make rate changes.\n\nJohn Melville-Jones\n\nYanchep, WA\n\nSpare some thought for ignored deposit-holders\n\nIt\u2019s about time we stopped thinking that it is only those who are buying houses through debt who need our sympathy. In a table published yesterday (\u2018\u2018Morrison slams banks for not passing on cut\u2019\u2019), you showed that someone who took out a mortgage back in 2008 with the CBA has seen their interest rate cut by 7.14 percentage points. Assuming this person took out a mortgage of $300,000 in that year (the average price then for a house in Melbourne was $460,827), the annual cost of the interest has fallen by $21,400 \u2013 and all this in after-tax dollars. Not a bad pay rise over 11 years. And the average price of a Melbourne home is now almost double that of 2008, at $914,518. And that capital gain will be tax-free too.\n\nOn the other hand, savers in bank term deposits have been crucified; not that we read much about their plight. Perhaps your paper could look into that.\n\nAnthony Baird\n\nBrighton East, Vic\n\nRBA should be realistic about jobless numbers\n\nThe key reasons given for the interest rate cut are to kickstart the economy, reduce unemployment to about 4.5per cent and get inflation up to 2-3 per cent. However, there is nothing much the RBA can do to reduce the unemployment figure of \u2018\u2018officially\u2019\u2019 about 5.3 per cent unless it is honest and accepts that the real unemployment figure is 15 per cent plus 13 per cent underemployed, and has been for many years.\n\nWe would have to have another Industrial Revolution to have any hope of getting to 4.5 per cent. The massive understatement of Australia\u2019s monthly unemployment figures for so long has resulted in big distortions and wrong decisions being made by the RBA and governments.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarcus L\u2019Estrange\n\nSt Kilda West, Vic\n\nLower rates won\u2019t do much to lift spending\n\nThe idea that cheap money provides an excellent underpinning for a modern economy is a form of madness. The RBA\u2019s current strategy of lowering interest rates to almost nothing in an attempt to boost economic activity is clearly self-defeating.\n\nBusinesses and mortgage holders are unlikely to vigorously expand their spending or investment as interest rates fall from 1 to 0.75 per cent, especially as banks have been prudent enough to hold borrowing rates steady. However savers, who may live off interest income, are more likely to spend when interest rates are at least above the inflation rate. They are now cutting back spending as they are forced to eat into capital.\n\nBankers and the government need to re-imagine an economy that rewards savers, who actually provide funds that support investment.\n\nPeter Strachan\n\nCottesloe, WA", "description": "Neoliberalism, interest rates, employment numbers, banks.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2465%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a2f7e70623a8e191a7630a82063e2dc4fcd0363f", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
