It was customary for our ascendants to have an early dinner just before sunset or near about 6 pm in the evening. This would then conclusively be the last meal of the day; then they would break their fast only late next morning. This, then, is intermittent fasting which is to go without food for many hours in a day or a couple of days a week. There are multiple benefits: weight loss, detoxification, hormonal harmony, good digestion, metabolic well-being and it is also a cancer preventive. Intermittent fasting works in unique ways. When we forgo food, our good cells get to work and destroy diseased cells. So, what happens when we fast? Insulin levels drop and the body goes into fat-burn mode.\n\n\n\nMethod: You may practise intermittent fasting a few days a week. The fasting cycle can be between 14 to 18 hours a day. But stay well-hydrated; keep sipping water or lemonade at short intervals. Eat between a 6 to 8 hour window \u2018only during the day\u2019.\n\n\n\nAnd what you eat should be nutritious. Thus, lunch and dinner have to be over before 6pm. The next morning, breakfast late between 10 to 12 noon. You may drink tea or coffee early in the morning if you like.\n\n\n\nDespite a wealth of benefits, fasting is not for everyone. So, always consult your doctor first.\n\n\n\n\u25a0 Do you have a question for Surakshitji?
