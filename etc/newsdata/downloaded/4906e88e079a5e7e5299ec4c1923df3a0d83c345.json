But the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said there was no evidence the drones were launched in Yemen and accused Iran of \u201can unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply\u201d.\n\nIranian officials rejected those claims on Sunday and warned that US military assets in the region were within range of its missiles. \u201cHaving failed at \u2018max pressure\u2019, [Pompeo is] turning to \u2018max deceit\u2019,\u201d the Iranian foreign minister, Javad Zarif, wrote on Twitter.\n\nIran\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told state TV the American claim was \u201cpointless\u201d. A senior commander from Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards warned that the Islamic republic was ready for \u201cfull-fledged\u201d war.\n\n\u201cEverybody should know that all American bases and their aircraft carriers in a distance of up to 2,000km around Iran are within the range of our missiles,\u201d the head of the Revolutionary Guards Corps\u2019 aerospace force, Amirali Hajizadeh, was quoted as saying by the semi-official Tasnim news agency.\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s oilfields and pipelines have been targeted by rebels over the past year but never on such a scale and causing such disruption. Aramco said the attacks would cut output by 5.7m barrels a day, more than 5% of global crude supply.\n\nA Saudi-led military coalition has been fighting Houthi forces in Yemen for the past four years in a war viewed partly as a proxy for the wider battle for regional supremacy between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Both the Houthis and Iran deny allegations by Saudi and western leaders that Tehran is funding, arming and training the rebel group.\n\nThe attacks are the most damaging and deepest within Saudi territory that have yet been claimed by the Yemeni rebels, and demonstrate the vulnerability of the world\u2019s fossil fuel supply to attacks by low-tech, relatively cheap weapons.\n\nPlay Video 0:52 Saudi Arabia: major fire at world's largest oil refinery after drone attack - video\n\nSaudi Aramco is preparing for what Saudi Arabia hopes will be the world\u2019s largest-ever public listing and the fuel for crown prince Mohammad bin Salman\u2019s ambitious plan to transform the Saudi economy by 2030.\n\nBut achieving the $2tn evaluation it hopes for will require the market to shrug off concerns about weakening long-term demand for the fossil fuel, as well as the ongoing US-China trade war and the prospect of a global economic slowdown.\n\nAnalysts said Saturday\u2019s attack also exposed the vulnerability of the company to geopolitical strife. \u201cThe attacks could complicate Aramco\u2019s initial public offering (IPO) plans given rising security risks and potential impact on its valuation,\u201d said analysts led by Ayham Kamel, head of Middle East and North Africa research at the Eurasia Group.\n\n\u201cAbqaiq is the nerve centre of the Saudi energy system. Even if exports resume in the next 24 to 48 hours, the image of invulnerability has been altered,\u201d Helima Croft, the global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told Reuters.\n\nSome Iraqi media outlets claimed the attack originated from their country, where Iran-backed paramilitary groups are growing in capability. However, a spokesman for Iraq\u2019s ministry of defence dismissed this on Sunday. \u201cIraq calls on all parties to stop these attacks which cause great losses of life & facilities,\u201d Yehia Rasool wrote on Twitter.\n\nDonald Trump called Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman after the attack to express US support for Saudi security, the Saudi foreign ministry said. Andrew Murrison, the British foreign office minister responsible for the Middle East, called on the Houthis to stop threatening civilian areas and Saudi commercial infrastructure.\n\nRobert McNally, of the US-based Rapidan Energy Group, said: \u201cAbqaiq is perhaps the most critical facility in the world for oil supply. Oil prices will jump on this. If disruption to production is prolonged, a Strategic Petrol Reserves release from International Energy Agency (IEA) members seems both likely and sensible. If anything, the risk of tit-for-tat regional escalation, which pushes oil prices even higher, has just gone up significantly.\u201d\n\nThe IEA said it was \u201cmonitoring the situation closely\u201d. A spokesman added: \u201cWe are in contact with Saudi authorities as well as major producer and consumer nations. For now, markets are well supplied.\u201d", "description": "Foreign ministry counters accusations from US secretary of state with threats to US bases", "authors": ["Michael Safi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76fb86d9b002cecce40d2d13899e33fd2f737d9c/71_540_2805_1683/master/2805.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8f2c3ffe7f757d0d2e48c5203a4f3e6d", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
