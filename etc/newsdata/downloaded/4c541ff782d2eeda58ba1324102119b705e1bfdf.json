(AP) - Alvin Sharpe was a little leery when he heard there was a new television show set in Southern Kentucky.\n\n\u201cA lot of times they don\u2019t depict the area like it ought to be,\u201d said Sharpe, a former teacher at the University of the Cumberlands in Williamsburg.\n\nThat\u2019s a common sentiment in Southern and Eastern Kentucky. Many people feel like the area has often been smeared in media reports, television shows, documentaries and other coverage that trafficked in stereotypes or focused only on problems such as poverty and drug addiction, with no mention of anything positive.\n\n\u201cA lot of them depict Eastern Kentucky as basically being ignorant,\u201d said Sharpe, tourism director for Williamsburg. \u201cThat\u2019s not us.\u201d\n\nSo when Sharpe watched the new NBC show, \u201cPerfect Harmony,\u201d he was pleased to find not only that it was entertaining, but that he didn\u2019t see it portraying people in the area as \u201cdumb hicks.\u201d\n\nThe half-hour comedy, which airs on Thursdays at 8:30 p.m., is the creation of Lesley Wake Webster, daughter of Norrie Wake, a former Fayette County attorney.\n\nThe show is about an acerbic, elitist curmudgeon named Arthur Cochran, a former Princeton University music professor whose wife was from the Lake Cumberland region.\n\nCochran, played by Bradley Whitford, is bereft after his wife\u2019s death and burial in her homeplace, but then finds purpose in training a small church choir that needs some help.\n\nWendy Ball, a retired state police employee who has homes in Somerset and Madisonville, said the show is the best new comedy she\u2019s seen this fall.\n\n\u201cI thought it was really cute,\u201d Ball said. \u201cI found it to be well done and funny.\u201d\n\nBall said she enjoyed the Kentucky references in the show.\n\nThere have been plenty since it premiered Sept. 26.\n\nThe show is set in the fictional town of Conley Fork, but has mentioned a Methodist church in McCreary County; the Wildcats; and even Rick Pitino, the former basketball coach at the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville.\n\nThe pastor has a UK tattoo on his shoulder, and one of the main characters, played by Anna Camp, works at the Moonbow Dairy, a shout-out to the moonbow visible in the mist at Cumberland Falls.\n\nIn the first episode, there was a map of Lake Cumberland visible on the wall of the diner.\n\nWake said his daughter spent a lot of time around the lake growing up.\n\nThe family lived in Fayette County, but spent most weekends at their cabin in Wayne County, where Wake\u2019s wife, the former Nancy Dodson, grew up at Steubenville and played piano at the Baptist church there.\n\n\u201cOur two daughters didn\u2019t even know there was life in Lexington on the weekends,\u201d Wake said.\n\nThe diner in the TV show is modeled on the now-closed Cumberland Dairy in Monticello, said Wake, who owned a winery in Wayne County at one point.\n\nWake said he hopes there will be more music in the show.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll keep our fingers crossed that we\u2019ll hear \u2018On, On U of K\u2019 or \u2018My Old Kentucky Home,\u2019\u201d on the show, Wake said.\n\nThe show has another Kentucky connection in actor Laura Bell Bundy. Bundy, who grew up in Lexington, will have a recurring role.\n\nWebster also had plenty of examples of choirs from which to draw material.\n\nWake\u2019s father, Arthur Wake, was music minister at Central Christian Church in Lexington and taught at the Lexington Theological Seminary.\n\nAfter retiring to Wayne County in 1989, Wake\u2019s parents worked with community choirs, he said.\n\n\u201cLesley kind of grew up in that,\u201d Wake said.\n\nWebster has said in interviews that the Arthur Cochran character in the show is modeled on her grandfather, who was in a \u201cvery dark place\u201d after his wife died, leaving him alone in a place where he felt like a bit of an outsider.\n\n\u201cBut the thing that brought him sort of back to life and gave him meaning was directing this little choir and he was standing in a circle with people singing who had radically different beliefs and had been raised differently, but together they made something really beautiful and that\u2019s really what we want to bring to this,\u201d Webster said in a story carried by mynewsLA.com.\n\nWake said his daughter told him studio executives have been pleased with the show.\n\nThe rating site Rotten Tomatoes said 67 percent of critics gave the show a positive review, with a higher figure, 78 percent, among audience reviewers.\n\nThe show has been filmed in California, including an area \u201cwhich sort of looks like Kentucky if you don\u2019t look too closely,\u201d Webster said in one interview.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear that the show will do any filming in Kentucky.\n\nThe program makes much of the cultural mis-match between the professor, who sees himself as an urban sophisticate and calls the local people bumpkins, and the colorful, good-hearted church members, who assure him in one episode that the best way to make up with someone he\u2019s offended is with a casserole.\n\nOne character tells Cochran he has the only \u201cYankee\u201d car in town; he says the local speed limit is \u201cmosey\u201d and that he only cares about his reputation \u201camong people of intellect and refinement, so not here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou do have sarcasm here. What\u2019s next - bagels?\u201d he says in one scene.\n\nSeveral viewers said they saw Cochran\u2019s jibes in the spirit of having fun, not making fun of the region.\n\nThey weren\u2019t bothered in the same way many were, for instance, by a 2009 television report that included the term \u201cMountain Dew mouth\u201d to describe tooth decay among young people in Eastern Kentucky from drinking the soda, or an abortive effort in the early 2000s to stick a family from Appalachia in a mansion in California for a reality-show version of the \u201cBeverly Hillbillies.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing from Kentucky, it wasn\u2019t like I sat there and cringed\u201d watching \u201cPerfect Harmony,\u201d Ball said.\n\nGloria Sams of Somerset, who worked for the Kentucky Cancer Program at UK, said she liked how the characters have learned lessons and grown over the first several episodes.\n\nAnyone who has ever sung in a choir knows the potential for humor in it, she said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed it,\u201d Sams said. \u201cIt\u2019s off to a good start.\u201d\n\nSams said she hopes as the show develops, the writers won\u2019t feel the need to deal in stereotypes.\n\nWake said his daughter certainly doesn\u2019t intend to demean her home state.\n\n\u201cShe loves Kentucky,\u201d Wake said.\n\nTourism directors said the show could be a plus in raising the profile of the area.\n\n\u201cI feel it\u2019s a good thing for us,\u201d said Michelle Allen, executive director of Somerset-Pulaski County Convention & Visitors Bureau.\n\nJanette Marson, director of the Lake Cumberland Tourist Commission in Russell County, noted that the gritty FX drama \u201cJustified\u201d increased interest in Harlan County, where it was set.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a plus,\u201d she said of \u201cPerfect Harmony.\u201d \u201dIt\u2019ll be a benefit in some way, even if it\u2019s a seed planted.\u201d\n\nWake said the initial run of \u201cPerfect Harmony\u201d will extend through the end of the year. The show will take a hiatus early in 2020 while studio executives decide on the line-up for later, Wake said.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing that is certain about this stuff,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Lexington Herald-Leader, http://www.kentucky.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Alvin Sharpe was a little leery when he heard there was a new television show set in Southern Kentucky.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Bill Estep", "Lexington Herald-Leader"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
