The stock has lost 15.8% in the said period, comparing unfavorably with the industry\u2019s 15.7% decline. The underperformance was caused by soft earnings performance and weak industry prospects.\n\n\n\nRecently, the company reported weak fourth-quarter fiscal 2019 results. Both top and bottom lines missed the Zacks Consensus Estimates by 8.8% and 1.1%, respectively. On a year-over-year basis, the company\u2019s revenues declined 11.6%, while earnings grew just 2.6%. The company witnessed lower volumes, which mainly resulted from the prior year\u2019s shift in sales among key customers within the retail channel, elimination of a few products and soft market conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarnings estimates for fiscal 2020 have declined 1.1% over the past seven days, which is a concern for the company\u2019s growth prospects. The innate weakness of Acuity Brands is further ascertained by its Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s delve deeper and identify the factors affecting its performance.\n\n\n\nLackluster Performance & Bleak Views: In fiscal 2019, Acuity Brands revenues declined 0.2% year over year, due to significantly lower volumes. Adjusted gross margin contracted 20 basis points (bps) due to inflationary pressure, the U.S.- China trade war and increased tariffs. While the adjusted selling, distribution and administrative expenses were stable on the back of various cost-saving actions, the adjusted operating margin was under pressure, contracting 10 bps year over year.\n\n\n\nManagement does not expect any considerable rebound in luminaries' near-term demand. It remains cautiously optimistic for fiscal 2020 due to the escalating trade-war tensions. For fiscal first-quarter 2020, it projects net sales to decline year over year in the mid-to-high-single-digit range.\n\n\n\nWeakness in the Industry: Acuity Brands operates in a highly competitive industry, which is affected by volatility in the general economic factors like GDP growth, employment levels, credit availability, energy costs and commodity costs. Its business is based on residential and non-residential construction, which is highly sensitive to the above-mentioned factors.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, its products are majorly sold through various retail channels, which are highly sensitive to consumer spending and discretionary income along with construction spending. Moreover, the overall lighting industry is experiencing a tough time in the North American market as well as Europe and Asia.\n\n\n\nCurrent market conditions in the lighting industry continue to create a challenging environment for Acuity Brands, and other companies like LSI Industries Inc. LYTS, Orion Energy Systems, Inc. OESX and Energy Focus, Inc. EFOI.\n\n\n\nHigher Costs: Acuity Brands belongs to a highly fragmented industry, where ever-changing technology and innovation play vital roles in the competitive landscape. Energy-efficient lighting products like LED fixtures need extensive research and development and hence involve excessive costs. Higher spending on research and development poses a threat to the company\u2019s bottom-line performance.\n\n\n\nAgain, a shortage of skilled labor and higher input costs in electronic and certain oil-based components along with rising steel prices are pressing concerns.\n\n\n\nEstimates Trending Downward: Earnings estimates for the fiscal first quarter have declined 2.2% over the past seven days. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for fiscal first-quarter earnings is currently pegged at $2.25 per share, indicating a decrease of 3% year over year. Revenues are currently expected to fall 7.5% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s $932.6 million.\n\n\n\nOvervalued Compared to Peers: The company\u2019s stretched valuation is another concern. Its trailing 12-month price to earnings (P/E) ratio is 13.18, which is higher than the industry\u2019s 11.6. This implies that the stock is overvalued compared to its peers.\n\n\n\n5 Stocks Set to Double\n\n\n\nEach was hand-picked by a Zacks expert as the #1 favorite stock to gain +100% or more in 2020. Each comes from a different sector and has unique qualities and catalysts that could fuel exceptional growth.\n\n\n\nMost of the stocks in this report are flying under Wall Street radar, which provides a great opportunity to get in on the ground floor.\n\n\n\nToday, See These 5 Potential Home Runs >>\n\n\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
