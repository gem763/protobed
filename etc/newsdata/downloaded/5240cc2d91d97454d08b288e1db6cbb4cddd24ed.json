You're all giggling as if you didn't want to answer, or you thought it was a stupid question - not quite sure which one?, one reporter asked.\n\nTolu Latu (pictured on Monday) described one question about his coach as a 'complete joke'\n\nThe hooker fired back: 'Stupid question. To ask it, I don't know, it's different for you guys and different for us. For us, it comes across as a stupid question so that's why we're all laughing.\n\n'Obviously, you're asking us a question that we think is a complete joke so, if you're going to ask us questions like that, we'll take it as a joke and throw it back at you.'\n\nEarlier, Salakaia-Loto also snapped when asked if Australia can beat England.\n\n'Because we can, why not?' he said.\n\n'We all believe it, we're not just going to sit here and go, 'Oh, don't think we believe it,' of course we can. We all believe that we can do whatever we want to do, if we put our mind to it.'\n\nThe English journalists also tested the patience of Wallabies flanker Lukhan Salakaia-Loto\n\nSalakaia-Loto put the same question to the reporter, who replied 'not sure'.\n\n'Really? That's your problem then. We believe we can beat them,' Salakaia-Loto fired back.\n\nHe also defended Cheika's outspoken approach early in the tournament when he railed against a number of issues, mostly around high-tackle interpretation.\n\nWhen asked for an insight of Cheika and whether he was a 'caring sort of guy', Salakaia-Loto sarcastically replied: 'Nah, he's mean, he's a bully, bullies everyone. (No) He's good, man, good fella.'\n\nLatu added: 'To us, he's our head coach, of course he cares, he cares about each and every one of us. Simple as that.'\n\nThe Australian Wallabies take on England in a die or die Rugby World Cup quarter final\n\nThe press conference ended in stony silence shortly afterwards.\n\nThe Wallabies go into the match as underdogs, having not beaten England in their last six outings since 2016.\n\nAt the last Rugby World Cup four years, ago, the Wallabies caused a huge upset against England with a 33-13 win in the group pool stages to eliminate the host nation.", "description": "Australian Wallabies stars Lukhan Salakaia-Loto and Tolu Latu have clashed with English journalists in a fiery press conference ahead of their do or die Rugby World Cup quarter final in Japan.", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press", "Kylie Stevens For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/11/19687158-0-image-a-17_1571049024056.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
