Qualifying will start at 9am in Stuttgart. It's certainly the earliest start time I've known in a major competition and it takes time to adjust to.\n\nWe'd been practicing some early morning sessions before we arrived, but on Monday we had our first early start in the actual arena. We usually call this the 'podium' training as the apparatus is raised up on platforms.\n\nEveryone's alarms were set for 5am. I'm fine with getting up at that time. I'm quite a morning person so I don't mind waking up then. But it's different to getting up and doing a basic workout versus your biggest gymnastics at that time of the morning. We did a three-week preparation camp ahead of the championships just to prepare for the early starts. When it comes to our podium and competition day, we'll have our breakfast in a hotel suite which we've transformed into our team meeting room as we're up way too early for breakfast to be on in the hotel which is crazy!", "description": "The early morning starts have definitely been one of the biggest challenges for the team ahead of the World Championships.", "authors": ["Becky Downie", "Daniel Schofield", "Jonathan Kaplan", "Paul Hayward"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/gymnastics/2019/10/04/ALS_7053-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqjZCqkh21MTy1LvXE-PcUNXlS6YSfQWFkft4A8pSEFYM.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
