I was so freaked out, I barely slept,\" she wrote. \"I even tried creeping in there with a flashlight while my son was sleeping.\"\n\nAfter a rather restless night, Cibuls says she decided to get to the bottom of the purported haunting, which is when she discovered the origin of said \"ghost.\"\n\nHer husband had apparently changed the child's bedding and forgotten to replace the mattress protector. Because of this, a large mattress tag bearing the image of a grinning infant shone through her son's bedding, which the baby monitor picked up in a rather eerie fashion.\n\n\"Well, this morning I go to investigate a bit further,\" she wrote. \"It turns out my husband just forgot to put the mattress protector on when he changed the sheets.\"\n\n\"I could kill him,\" she jokingly added.\n\nSince being posted, Cibuls's story has racked up more than 490,000 reactions and 290,000 shares.\n\nCibuls later told Yahoo Style UK that although she never fully abandoned the idea of paranormal activity, she believed there had to be a simpler explanation for the friendly-looking visitor.\n\n\"Some part of me does believe in ghosts...but I just tried to tell myself there was some logical explanation,\" she told the outlet.", "description": "Maritza Cibuls took to Facebook on Oct. 18 to share an eerie image she captured through her son's baby monitor.", "authors": ["Alex Lasker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WfMmgIlo.LU2AQzjJ.NBkg--~B/aD05NDQ7dz0xNDMwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/c4bf2a10-f434-11e9-bfce-15427338f8bf", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
