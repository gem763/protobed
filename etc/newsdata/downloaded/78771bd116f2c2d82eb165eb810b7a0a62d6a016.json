And it\u2019s not just Chicago government. It\u2019s government generally. So, the only way to really have confidence, at least in this generation of things, is to put the information out there,\u201d Ferguson told the Sun-Times.\n\nFor years, Ferguson\u2019s reports on the police shooting of Laquan McDonald and the death of David Koschman have been kept under wraps because city laws required confidentiality.\n\nThat\u2019s about to change in Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s quest to deliver on her signature campaign promise to \u201cshine the light\u201d on wrongdoing.\n\nLate last month, the City Council approved a Lightfoot-championed ordinance giving Chicago\u2019s corporation counsel power to release Ferguson\u2019s reports when they involve \u201csustained findings regarding conduct that either is associated with a death or is, or may be, a felony as defined in the Illinois Criminal Code and is of a compelling public interest.\u201d\n\nThe ordinance widened the rift between the new mayor and the Fraternal Order of Police and may have opened the door to a court challenge.\n\n\u201cThe Fraternal Order of Police has articulated in several instances our strongly-held belief that the Inspector General\u2019s office, particularly under Joe Ferguson, is often little more than a political witch hunt of our members, none more so than the manner by which his office generated criminal indictments of the three officers in connection with the Laquan McDonald shooting. Those officers, tried by special prosecutor Patricia Holmes, were acquitted,\u201d the union said in a statement last month.\n\n\u201cThat the Ethics Committee and the mayor would increase the frequency and magnitude by which cases against the police will be tried in the media, and not in a courtroom, is shocking and disappointing, particularly since the Chicago media itself is so corrupt and so engrained in the anti-police movement.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Ferguson responded to the union\u2019s complaints of anti-police bias.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re advocates. They\u2019re representing the membership the way that they see fit. We gather the evidence. We report the facts. We make our recommendations. They disagree. They speak their minds. And sometimes, they speak it more colorfully than we do,\u201d he said.\n\nThe inspector general argued that the changes ordered by the City Council simply mirror reporting requirements already followed by the Civilian Office of Police Accountability.\n\nNow, Ferguson said, IG reports are in what he called a \u201ccomplete confidentiality cone,\u201d so when his office looks into police matters, \u201cless is known publicly,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThis just brings it into alignment\u201d with COPA, he said.\n\nFerguson disagreed with the union\u2019s claim that the ordinance violates the police contract.\n\nBut, he said, \u201cThe FOP has a right to take it to arbitration if they want. We\u2019ll just have to let the process bear itself out.\u201d\n\nAfter the City Council approved the ordinance, Lightfoot hinted strongly at the imminent release of Ferguson\u2019s reports on the police shooting of Laquan McDonald. Still, no reports have been released.\n\nFerguson said the delay has to do with the sheer number of reports.\n\nThere are 16 separate reports \u2014 one for each officer for whom he recommended disciplinary action for their role in covering for convicted former Police Officer Jason Van Dyke, who fired the 16 shots that killed the African-American teenager.\n\nFerguson recommended the firing of twelve of the officers and suspensions for the four others.\n\nThe Law Department is now \u201cgoing through a line-by-line review to make sure that there is nothing that the law prohibits disclosure of that\u2019s contained in the reports and make sure they\u2019re redacted properly,\u201d Ferguson said.\n\n\u201cMy understanding is, within a week or so, all sixteen of those reports will be\u201d released, he said.", "description": "Joe Ferguson says the only way to overcome mistrust of government is to release his most sensitive investigative reports, including those into the police shooting of Laquan McDonald and the death of David Koschman.", "authors": ["Fran Spielman", "Gordon Wittenmyer", "Dale Bowman", "Tom Schuba", "Sam Charles", "Matthew Hendrickson", "Jermaine Nolen", "Nancy Malitz - For The Sun-Times", "Sun-Times Wire", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1-IM715XQ3xpu5RCYL5hPNwkcqg=/0x294:5558x3204/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19267705/FRANSHOW_041319_12_1_.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
