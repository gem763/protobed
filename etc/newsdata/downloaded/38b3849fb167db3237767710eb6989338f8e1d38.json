Zero tolerance is zero tolerance and I think at UEFA we need to really address that.\n\n\u2018But to be perfectly frank we need to address racism in England. We still have it, we have it throughout the pyramid, we see examples of it every week from the professional game down to the grassroots game.\n\n\u2018We shouldn\u2019t join the moral high ground, we should join a movement to drive racism out of our game and have zero tolerance for it.\u2019\n\nFormer England striker Ian Wright slammed Clarke for these comments, telling ITV: \u2018Do you know what I\u2019d like to say, listening to Greg Clarke\u2019s interview, listening to him pander up to UEFA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He\u2019s the person that\u2019s supposed to be going into bat in respect of what\u2019s happening.\n\n\u2018Saying that \u2018I know that there\u2019s people at UEFA who have really strong feelings\u2019 \u2013 when have they shown any strong feelings about wanting to stamp out racism?\n\n\u2018That doesn\u2019t make me very confident in Greg Clarke and what he\u2019s going to try and do now. Not at all, really disappointed at that.\u2019\n\nUEFA president Aleksander Ceferin's statement on racism There were times, not long ago, when the football family thought that the scourge of racism was a distant memory. The last couple of years have taught us that such thinking was, at best, complacent. The rise of nationalism across the continent has fuelled some unacceptable behaviour and some have taken it upon themselves to think that a football crowd is the right place to give voice to their appalling views. As a governing body, I know we are not going to win any popularity contests. But some of the views expressed about UEFA\u2019s approach to fighting racism have been a long way off the mark. UEFA, in close cooperation with the FARE network (Football Against Racism Europe), instituted the three-stage protocol for identifying and tackling racist behaviour during games. UEFA\u2019s sanctions are among the toughest in sport for clubs and associations whose supporters are racist at our matches. The minimum sanction is a partial closure of the stadium \u2013 a move which costs the hosts at least hundreds of thousands in lost revenue and attaches a stigma to their supporters. UEFA is the only football body to ban a player for ten matches for racist behaviour \u2013 the most severe punishment level in the game. Believe me, UEFA is committed to doing everything it can to eliminate this disease from football. We cannot afford to be content with this; we must always strive to strengthen our resolve. More broadly, the football family \u2013 everyone from administrators to players, coaches and fans \u2013 needs to work with governments and NGOs to wage war on the racists and to marginalise their abhorrent views to the fringes of society. Football associations themselves cannot solve this problem. Governments too need to do more in this area. Only by working together in the name of decency and honour will we make progress.\n\nMORE: The racism in Bulgaria could easily have taken place at a football match in England\n\nMORE: Bulgaria goalkeeper Plamen Iliev says England overreacted to racial abuse and the fans \u2018behaved well\u2019", "description": "UEFA have charged Bulgaria with four offences and England with two following the match in Sofia on Monday night, marred by racist scenes.
