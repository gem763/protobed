The plant was a joint venture of the two republics when both were part of Yugoslavia.\n\n\u201cThe Una Nature Park is yet another defense mechanism against Croatia\u2019s nuclear waste disposal plans,\u201d said Srebrenka Golic, the environment minister of Bosnia\u2019s Serb Republic.\n\nSince the end of a conflict over the break up of Yugoslavia, Bosnia has been made up of two autonomous regions - the Serb Republic and the Bosniak-Croat Federation. The latter had already proclaimed the Una river a national nature park.\n\nCroatian Minister of Environment and Energy Tomislav Coric recently said a final decision on the landfill site would be made in October.\n\nBoth Bosnia and Croatia have seen a series of protests against the plan. Activists say over 300,000 citizens and wildlife along the Una could potentially suffer.\n\nIn 2016, Slovenia and Croatia agreed to extend NEK\u2019s lifespan by 20 years to 2043. It was built in cooperation with U.S. firm Westinghouse and started operating in 1984.", "description": "One of Bosnia's two regional governments on Thursday designated the Una river a nature park, seeking to head off plans being considered by Croatia to build a landfill site for radioactive waste near the border between the two countries.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
