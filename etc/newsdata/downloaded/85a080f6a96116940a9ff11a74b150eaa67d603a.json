Their attorney, Ron Austin, says the homes built by the foundation in the Lower Ninth Ward have infrastructural issues and residents have reported being sick.\n\nThe allegations: Brad Pitt's foundation is accused of building shoddy homes in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina\n\nAustin says Pitt and the board of the foundation, which Pitt formed in 2007 after raising $42 million, have known about the problems since at least 2009 but have failed to fix them despite mounting complaints.\n\n\"We want to make Brad Pitt make it right,\" Austin told USA TODAY. \"He can\u2019t leave these people helpless.\"\n\nAustin said the \"tragedy\" is that Pitt's effort to help the flooded Lower Ninth after Katrina showed his \"heart was in the right place\" but his foundation has been \"almost an epic failure.\"\n\nMore than 100 green Make It Right houses were built in 2008. The foundation sued the principal architect last year saying his designs were defective.\n\nPitt's rep declined to comment to USA TODAY on the recent development.\n\nContributing: Maria Puente\n\nMore: Brad Pitt's foundation is accused of building shoddy homes in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina", "description": "A judge denied Brad Pitt's request to be taken off a lawsuit that says his foundation built faulty homes in the New Orleans area hit hardest by Hurricane Katrina.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/25/USAT/f453d3e2-ba79-4746-9219-b418b5533e68-AP_Brad_Pitt_Make_It_Right.JPG?crop=3827,2153,x0,y120&width=3200&height=2009&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
