Military spokesmen in the past responded only in vague terms about it after at least six flight tests of the ultra-high-speed missile were carried out since 2014.\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies estimated that the DF-17 would not be deployed until next year. The missile is considered one of what Beijing calls \u201cassassin\u2019s mace\u201d weaponry \u2014 arms designed to give China\u2019s weaker military a strategic advantage over the U.S. military.\n\nThe DF-17 is the first deployed hypersonic strike weapon for the PLA and can travel at speeds of more than 7,000 miles per hour \u2014 enough to outrun current U.S. anti-missile interceptors. Additionally, the missile is said to be maneuverable, a feature that allows it to further avoid electronic detection.\n\nThe state-run Xinhua News Agency described the DF-17 as a conventionally armed missile, a possible deception because Pentagon officials in the past told Congress that the missile was expected to be outfitted with either conventional or nuclear warheads.\n\nUntil the unveiling this week, the DF-17 was known inside the Pentagon as the Wu-14 and DF-ZF hypersonic glide vehicle.\n\nCurrent U.S. missile interceptors, include the Navy\u2019s ship-based SM-3 and the Army\u2019s THAAD and Ground Based Interceptors (GBI), are said to be unable to counter the DF-17.\n\nThe 44 GBIs and related sensor systems are capable of stopping long-range missiles and their warheads that travel in non-maneuvering ways, but the high speeds of the DF-17 pose significant challenges for current defenses.\n\nIn response to the development of Chinese and Russian hypersonic missiles, the Pentagon is engaged in a crash program to develop hypersonic missile defenses and hypersonic offensive missiles. More than $1 billion is being appropriated for U.S. hypersonic missiles and defenses.\n\nA spending bill in Congress includes funds for a Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor and more than $230 million for speeding up development of hypersonic defenses. The Air Force could receive $576 million in the pending legislation for prototyping hypersonic missiles under a defense appropriations bill.\n\nChina\u2019s state-run Global Times said the DF-17 is \u201cvery recently developed\u201d and is designed to penetrate missile defenses.\n\n\u201cIt will play a vital role in safeguarding China\u2019s territorial integrity, as regions including the South China Sea, the Taiwan Strait and Northeast Asia are all within its striking range,\u201d said the paper, quoting Yang Chengjun, a Chinese missile expert.\n\nMr. Yang also said the DF-17 can change trajectories in midflight as a way to avoid interceptor missiles. He added that if U.S. defenses like THAAD and SM-3 can detect the launch, then interception is possible.\n\nHowever that would be difficult because the \u201claunch in actual combat will be done secretly,\u201d Mr. Yang said.\n\nOther major weapons shown off by the Chinese on Tuesday included the new 10-warhead DF-41 and new underwater drones with twin propellers indicating a long-range capability.\n\nCHINESE AGENT ARREST\n\nThe arrest this week in California of Edward Peng on charges of acting as a Chinese intelligence agent provides new details of Beijing\u2019s spy operations in the United States.\n\nMr. Peng, 56, is a naturalized U.S. citizen and resident of Hayward, California. He was arrested Monday after an FBI counterintelligence double agent operation.\n\nAccording to court papers, he was operating as an agent of the Ministry of State Security (MSS), China\u2019s civilian spy service, since at least June 2015. FBI video of the counterspy operation showed Mr. Peng passing classified information supplied by an FBI informant by taping it to the bottom of a drawer in a Georgia hotel room for later retrieval by another agent.\n\nAn FBI affidavit said the MSS provided their double agent with a new method for passing classified information to the Chinese spy service. Secrets supplied by the FBI as part of the sting were on a small, secure SD card placed inside a book and wrapped in a bag. The package was left at the front desk of a hotel in Newark, California.\n\nMr. Peng was later spotted picking up the package.\n\nAccording to the FBI document, an MSS officer told the double agent that Mr. Peng was reliable, had family in China and had done business in China. The officer said Mr. Peng \u201cdid not know what he was doing\u201d in acting as a courier.\n\nFBI officials stated that they doubted the MSS explanation and said they believed Mr. Peng was complicit in secret operations and knew it.\n\nThe FBI said evidence in the case shows Mr. Peng was schooled in conducting surreptitious dead drops, and then traveling to China to deliver to the MSS.\n\n\u201cI believe \u2018Ed\u2019 had been instructed in spycraft, practiced it, and knew that he was working for intelligence operatives of the PRC,\u201d stated FBI agent Spiro Fokas.\n\nThe MSS spy handler used several telephones to contact Mr. Peng, calls that were intercepted by the FBI.\n\nIn one coded conversation, the SD cards being supplied to the MSS were described as \u201cpills\u201d picked up from dead drops.\n\nOther dead drops were used by the MSS to send money to the double agent. In one case in 2017, Mr. Peng was given $10,000 in cash from the MSS and supplied the equivalent of Chinese renminbi currency in exchange. The money was to be paid to the double agent.\n\nThe affidavit said that exchange is \u201ca method employed by the MSS to pay their sources in the U.S. without having the funds transit through the U.S. banking system.\u201d\n\nThe arrest of Mr. Peng is the latest in a U.S. crackdown on Chinese intelligence operations, after years of largely ignoring the threat.\n\n\u201cThe charges announced today provide a rare glimpse into the secret efforts of the People\u2019s Republic of China to obtain classified national security information from the United States and the battle being waged by our intelligence and law enforcement communities to protect our people, our ideas and our national defense,\u201d said U.S. Attorney David L. Anderson of the Northern District of California.\n\nDisrupting Mr. Peng\u2019s activities is \u201ca significant step in dismantling the PRC\u2019s overall efforts against our country,\u201d said Special Agent in Charge John F. Bennett of the FBI San Francisco Division.\n\nDEFENSE SCIENCE BOARD ON 5G\n\nThe Pentagon\u2019s defense science board warned that China is seeking to control technical standards for the emerging advanced telecommunications technology known as 5G.\n\nThe executive summary of a report by the board concluded that the U.S. military will gain \u201csignificant benefits\u201d in using the advanced communications and networking system, including much-improved data transfer rates, shorter delays in information transfers and significant energy savings. But the improvements also come with risks, including cyberthreats.\n\nOther risks include supply chain, cyber, radio frequency (RF)/electronic warfare (EW) and virtual/physical vulnerabilities.\n\nThe challenges could \u201ccreate significant mission risk,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cAny deployment of 5G in DoD infrastructure must be measured against mission criticality and acceptable risk,\u201d the report said.\n\nMilitary operations are increasingly reliant on networked communications and quick data transfers. If those are disrupted, then the operations could be sabotaged.\n\nThe report stated that China, the Pentagon\u2019s most significant strategic competitor, is seeking to impose its standards for 5G infrastructure around the world.\n\n\u201cChina is known to influence/coordinate positions before major standards decisions and seeks to control future standards,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe report recommends adopting 5G for military use in lightly contested areas and develop a secure 5G system for contested environments and critical military applications. The Defense Department\u2019s acquisition office should develop hardened and secure 5G technologies and infrastructure with a focus on protecting supply chains.\n\nThe technology is expected to be a part of the military\u2019s autonomous vehicles.\n\nExercises should be held to identify vulnerabilities and attack methods from the use of 5G systems, the board said.\n\n\u2022 Contact Bill Gertz on Twitter at @BillGertz.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
