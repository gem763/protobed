In his debut marathon a year ago in Toronto, Levins clocked 2:09.25 to break Jerome Drayton's 43-year-old national record.\n\nYOUR 2019 CANADIAN MEN\u2019S MARATHON CHAMPION <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TrevorHofbauer?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@TrevorHofbauer</a> \ud83c\udfc6<br><br>Finishes with a time of 2:09:51 \ud83c\udf89 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TOwaterfront42k?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TOwaterfront42k</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/wTGbYtoZEj\">pic.twitter.com/wTGbYtoZEj</a> \u2014@AthleticsCanada\n\n\"My training going into this was absolutely perfect and I couldn't have done it without the support of everybody back at home,\" the 27-year-old told Athletics Canada. \"I knew there was the possibility of making the Olympic team today and I just left it all out here.\"\n\nThe 27-year-old Hofbauer started the 42.2-kilometre event in strong fashion and never looked back. As he approached the finish line, Hofbauer raised his hands to his head and said, 'Oh my God' before crossing in a personal-best 2:09:51.\n\n\"I'm just happy that I didn't screw it up,\" he told Athletics Canada. \"I was giving high-fives down the finish line, so for anybody who has been bashing me for that, I left it out there today so you can't take that away from me.\"\n\nHofbauer's previous best was 2:16:48, set on April 28 at the Hamburg Marathon in Germany while his winning time in Toronto two years ago was 2:18:05.\n\nFor the last five years I've continued to believe I could get myself to this position. \u2014 Canada's Trevor Hofbauer on clinching a spot in the 2020 Olympic marathon\n\nHofbauer received a $5,000 bonus for meeting the men's 2:11:30 Olympic standard. He was the lone Canadian male to do so as Tristan Woodfine of Cobden, Ont., finished more than three seconds back of Hofbauer in 2:13:16 as the second Canadian while two-time Olympian Reid Coolsaet clocked 2:15:23 and missed his goal of 2:13.\n\nHofbauer, who elected not to wear a watch to gauge his pace, went out with the 2:11:30 group and \"ran his guts out.\"\n\n\"For the last five years I've continued to believe I could get myself to this position,\" he added, \"and if everything went well I could do something special. The energy [from the fans] was electric.\"\n\nHofbauer prepared for Sunday's race by finishing sixth at the Edmonton half marathon (1:06:29) on Aug. 18 and a month later second at the Vancouver Eastside 10K (29:58).\n\nPidhoresky, 32, was the fastest Canadian woman finisher in 2:29:03, achieving the women's Olympic standard by 27 seconds.\n\nYOUR 2019 CANADIAN WOMEN\u2019S MARATHON CHAMPION, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DaynaPidhoresky?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DaynaPidhoresky</a> \ud83c\udfc6<br><br>Crosses the finish line in a time of 2:29:03 \ud83c\udf89<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TOwaterfront42k?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TOwaterfront42k</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/MdatHfRcTW\">pic.twitter.com/MdatHfRcTW</a> \u2014@AthleticsCanada\n\nIn May, the Vancouver resident was sixth at the Ottawa Marathon (2:37:19) and fell one place short of a top-five result and automatic Olympic berth.\n\n\"Honestly, I feel I've had that in me for years, and it just came together at the right time,\" said Pidhoresky of Sunday's 2:29:03 performance. \"I had probably [my] rockiest [marathon] build ever.\"\n\nPidhoresky's coach and husband, Josh Seifarth, reminded her to stay patient and it paid off. Pidhoresky was running at a 2:22 pace near the 50-minute mark and later said the fear of blowing up midway through the race motivated her to finish strong.\n\nEmily Setlack, who hails from Kingston, Ont., finished 18 seconds shy of standard.\n\nKinsey Middleton was unsuccessful in defending her Canadian women's title, stopping the clock in 2:34:36 for third place and 11th overall.\n\nPhilemon Rono won the men's race and $30,000 in a course-record 2:05:09 after fellow Kenyan Benson Kipruto ended his two-year title reign a year ago.
