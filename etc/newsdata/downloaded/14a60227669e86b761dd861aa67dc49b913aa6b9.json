When I was younger- the environmentalists told me- don\u2019t ever use paper bags, paper straws, use an iPad and no paper because we were cutting down trees. Use plastic they said- and then you can recycle. Now everyone is using paper in the supermarket for bags, they are using paper straws etc. I am being told use paper- don\u2019t use plastic- it is bad for the environment. So which is it? And although I do want to do good by the environment- you can see why there is frustration and confusion and ultimately where some people begin to question the validity of what environmentalists put out there. Again I want to help- but make sure the information is accurate", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
