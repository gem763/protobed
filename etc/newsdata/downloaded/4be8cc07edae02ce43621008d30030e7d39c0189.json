New York finished 11 games back of the first-place Atlanta Braves in the National League East and three games off the final wild-card spot.\n\nThere's no question the team has fallen short of expectations after a 77-win season in 2018. The team added Robinson Cano, Wilson Ramos, Jed Lowrie and Edwin Diaz in the offseason. Even though many of those moves haven't worked out as planned, they showed how the front office and ownership were setting their sights on a postseason run.\n\nCallaway didn't help himself when he and Mets starting pitcher Jason Vargas got into a verbal altercation with Newsday's Tim Healey in the clubhouse. Some thought that might have been a fireable offense, but he escaped with only a fine.\n\nAs much as Callaway might have gotten wrong this year, the team's struggles don't fall squarely on his shoulders.\n\nLowrie has yet to play a game for the Mets as a result of separate knee and hamstring injuries. And most of the team's other additions failed to meet their usual standards, which was a key reason New York wasn't able to keep pace in the deep NL East.\n\nThen there's the bullpen Diaz was supposed to solidify.\n\nThe New York Post's Joel Sherman argued Callaway was always going to be the one blamed in the event the Mets underperformed, describing him as \"a human shield for those most responsible.\"\n\nIt didn't help that general manager Van Wagenen arrived after Callaway was already brought aboard. Van Wagenen doesn't have to worry as much about how this affects his tenure since the manager was a holdover from the previous front-office regime.\n\nPerhaps having a different voice in the clubhouse will have a galvanizing effect for the Mets.\n\nBut Callaway's replacement can't wave a magic wand and vastly improve an offense that already ranked 11th in weighted on-base average (.325) and seventh in weighted runs created plus (104), per FanGraphs. And when the lineup does deliver, the bullpen is liable to squander the lead anyway.\n\nBy letting Callaway go, the Mets can say they're trying something\u2014anything\u2014to find future success. Absent improvements to the roster, this is largely window dressing to mask what remain larger problems.", "description": "The  New York Mets   announced  they fired manager  Mickey Callaway  on Thursday after two years in charge...", "authors": ["Joseph Zucker"], "top_image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/817/920/hi-res-d87d8ac84aa4b78ee453d1e243b42539_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75"}
