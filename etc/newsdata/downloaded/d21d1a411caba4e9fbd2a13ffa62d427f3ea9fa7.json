That\u2019s why I want to be really clear today \u2013 we do not submit speech by politicians to our independent fact-checkers, and we generally allow it on the platform even when it would otherwise breach our normal content rules.\u201d\n\nMs Warren has previously backed breaking Facebook up into smaller companies and has pushed for stronger antitrust laws to rein in the power of tech giants.\n\nLast week, audio leaked of Mr Zuckerberg giving an unusually terse response to Ms Warren\u2019s calls for greater regulation, saying in the face of an \u201cexistential\u201d threat he would \u201cgo to the mat and fight\u201d.\n\nHe said Facebook would likely sue the US government if Ms Warren brought in such reforms as president.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
