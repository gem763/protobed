I turned my phone on and saw 82 missed calls,\u201d he recalls.\n\nThat\u2019s when he knew that something was wrong.\n\n\u201cA friend who I had sex with told me that he tested for HIV and the result came back positive . . . I clutched at my chest, hoping that my heart would stop racing.\u201d\n\nWade, who\u2019s a cabin crew member, then raced to the hospital with a friend to do the blood tests.\n\nHe just recalls seeing two lines in the results and a nurse saying, \u201cWade your tests are reactive, you are now HIV-positive.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn 15 minutes my entire world had changed,\u201d he tells YOU.\n\nBut instead of wallowing in self-pity, Wade decided to forgive himself and the person who infected him with the virus.\n\n\u201cShortly after my diagnosis I made a promise that I was going to do something.\n\n\u201cI was going to challenge ignorant attitudes and speak up about living with HIV by sharing my personal story and hoping to break the stigma,\u201d he said.\n\nWade has since redefined his life, found a new purpose and is preaching positivity.\n\nThe people who saw him shine are now his chosen family, he says.\n\nHe\u2019s always spreading a positive message on social media and talks openly about his status and spreading the love.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to have strangers come up to me and say, \u2018I look up to you\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m so proud of you\u2019.\n\n\u201cThis is because I don\u2019t have the people that I wish for the most \u2013 saying, we are proud of you, we are posting about #UequalsU on our social media, we are walking this journey with you.\u201d\n\nIt hasn\u2019t been an easy journey but Wade also went through tough times as a teenager identifying as gay.\n\nBut 2018 was rather difficult for him.\n\n\u201cI experienced true ostracism when the South African Civil Aviation Authority (SACAA) grounded me.\u201d\n\nHe says he had to fight for his rights to work as cabin crew and to choose an ARV treatment regimen best suited for him.\n\n\u201cMy decision to disclose my HIV status to the SACAA saw me grounded for months, with a loss of income as a result,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cI was subjected to a battery of medical tests including a neuro-psychological examination that required me to draw shapes and memorise a sequence of numbers. It made me feel like I was in Grade 1 again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t hit my head, I have HIV,\u201d he stresses.\n\nWade believes there\u2019s a still stigma attached to the condition, often as a result of ignorance about how HIV is transmitted and what it\u2019s like to live with it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s truly a public health concern.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also passionate about raising awareness that \u201cundetectable = untransmittable\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt means that a person living with HIV who has an undetectable viral load can\u2019t transmit the virus to a sexual partner,\u201d he explains.\n\n\u201cFor many people living with HIV, the news that they can no longer transmit HIV to the people they love is life-changing and that\u2019s at least one step forward to overcoming stigma!\u201d\n\nHe also encourages people who are living with HIV to start and stay on ARV treatment.\n\n\u201cI post the results of my viral load blood tests on social media. It shows that the HIV virus can\u2019t be found in my blood, again proving the U=U message.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also an advocate of people getting tested regularly and starting ARV treatment immediately upon testing HIV-positive.\n\n\u201cI now manage a team of cabin crew on board the aircraft.\n\n\u201cI enjoy exploring my creative side. I enjoy community engagement activities and I also volunteer a couple of hours a month at a social service organisation.\u201d\n\nWade runs his social media, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram using the handle @PositiveVibesZA and will be launching his website soon.\n\nHe says he\u2019s met a lot of people through his activism.\n\n\u201cAnd they all had one thing in common: they all wanted validation. Every single person you\u2019ll ever meet shares that common desire.\u201d", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s strange how the worst day of your life often starts just like any other\"", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9524/27f10a668a8344cf9b4089580c58e878.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
