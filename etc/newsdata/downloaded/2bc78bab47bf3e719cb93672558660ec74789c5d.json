(AP Photo/Kin Cheung, File)\n\nCANBERRA, Australia (AP) \u2014 Australia\u2019s ban on Chinese telecoms giant Huawei\u2019s involvement in its future 5G networks and its crackdown on foreign covert interference are testing Beijing\u2019s efforts to project its power overseas.\n\nIn its latest maneuver, China sent three scholars to spell out in interviews with Australian media and other appearances steps to mend the deepening rift with Beijing _ a move that appears to have fallen flat.\n\nIn a recent press conference at the Chinese Embassy in Canberra, Chen Hong, the head of Australian studies at East China Normal University, accused Australia of acting as a \u201cpawn\u201d for the United States in lobbying other countries against Huawei\u2019s involvement in the nascent 5G networks.\n\n\u201cAustralia has been in one way or another, so to speak, pioneering this kind of anti-China campaign, even some kind of a scare and smear campaign against China,\u201d Chen said. \u201cThat is definitely not what China will be appreciating, and if other countries follow suit, that is going to be recognized as extremely unfriendly,\u201d he said.\n\nAfter meetings in Beijing last week, Richard Marles, the opposition\u2019s defense spokesman, assessed the relationship as \u201cterrible.\u201d\n\nA growing number of Australians are convinced that Beijing has been using inducements, threats, espionage and other clandestine tactics to influence their politics _ methods critics believe Beijing might be honing for use in other western democracies.\n\n\u201cAustralia is seen as a test bed for Beijing\u2019s high-pressure influence tactics,\u201d said Clive Hamilton, author of \u201cSilent Invasion,\u201d a best seller that focuses on Chinese influence in Australia.\n\n\u201cThey are testing the capacity of the Australian democratic system to resist,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, Australian officials have downplayed talk of a diplomatic freeze. They must balance a growing wariness toward China and their desire for strong ties with the U.S. with the need to keep relations with their resource-rich country\u2019s largest export market on an even keel.\n\nAustralia relies on China for one-third of its export earnings. Delays in processing of Australia exports of coal and wine at Chinese ports have raised suspicions of retaliation by Beijing.\n\nWhile Prime Minister Scott Morrison appeared to side with President Donald Trump on the issue of China\u2019s trade status during a recent visit to Washington, he sought to temper suggestions by Trump that he had expressed \u201cvery strong opinions on China\u201d in their closed-door meeting.\n\n\u201cWe have a comprehensive, strategic partnership with China. We work well with China,\u201d Morrison replied.\n\nTrump and Morrison did agree that China has outgrown trade rule concessions allowed to developing nations, advantages it insists it should still be able to claim.\n\nMorrison, the prime minister, has won praise from the Chinese Communist Party newspaper Global Times for standing up for Gladys Liu, the first Chinese-born lawmaker to be elected to Australia's Parliament, when she was attacked for her associations with the United Front Work Department of the Chinese Communist Party, whose mission is to exert influence overseas.\n\nLiu, who was born in Hong Kong in 1964, was elected to the conservative government in May to represent a Melbourne district with a large population of ethnic Chinese voters. She has said she had resigned from such organizations and any honorary positions she might have held, some possibly without her \u201cknowledge or consent.\u201d\n\nMorrison accused her critics of smearing the 1.2 million people who make up the Chinese diaspora in Australia.\n\nThat was a \u201cdecent gesture,\u201d the Global Times said.\n\nBut while it seeks to control damage from the tensions with Beijing, the Australian government has been moving to neutralize its influence by banning foreign political donations and all covert foreign interference in domestic politics.\n\nOpposition lawmakers likened Liu\u2019s situation to that of Sam Dastyari, who resigned as a senator in 2017 over his links to Chinese billionaire and political donor Huang Xiangmo.\n\nHuang successfully sued Australian media outlets for defamation over the allegations of his involvement in Chinese political interference. But he lost his Australian permanent residency after it was discovered that his company had paid Dastyari's personal legal bills and then appeared alongside him at a news conference for Chinese media where Dastyari supported Beijing's territorial claims in the South China Sea, contradicting Australia's bipartisan policy.", "description": "Australia\u2019s ban on Chinese telecoms giant Huawei\u2019s involvement in its future 5G networks and its crackdown on foreign covert interference are testing Beijing\u2019s efforts to project its power overseas.
