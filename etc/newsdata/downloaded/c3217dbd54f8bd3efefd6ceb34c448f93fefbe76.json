It wasn't. Maybe he made a mistake. Maybe he was confused. We don't know. But he was wrong.\"\n\nControversy over the path of the hurricane began on Sunday when Trump claimed that Dorian was forecast to hit Florida, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Alabama.\n\nAt the time, the first four states were in the hurricane's predicted path, but Alabama was not. Trump's message led to a swift correction from the National Weather Service's Alabama office.\n\nTrump then doubled down on his claims throughout the week, and on Wednesday produced an outdated version of a National Hurricane Centre map, altered via Sharpie marker pen to extend its predicted track to Alabama.\n\nOn Thursday, Smith called this \"fake news defined.\"\n\n\"That map was from the day the hurricane became a hurricane. Eight days ago. August 28. It was four days old at the precise time he said Alabama would likely be hit harder than anticipated,\" he told viewers. \"By then, it was fake news defined on a very serious subject.\"\n\nRead more: Trump seems to have altered an old map of Hurricane Dorian's path to make it look like the storm was headed toward Alabama\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump participates in a debate sponsored by Fox News at the Fox Theatre on March 3, 2016 in Detroit, Michigan Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nSmith's attack on Trump was the latest salvo in a growing war on words that has seen the president increasingly turn on his former favorite news network.\n\n\"Fox is a lot different than it used to be,\" Trump told reporters in August after the network produced a poll that found he had less national support than four Democratic contenders for the presidency in 2020.\n\n\"Fox has changed, and my worst polls have always been from Fox,\" he said. \"There's something going on at Fox, I'll tell you right now. And I'm not happy with it.\"\n\nRead more: Trump is reportedly worried that Fox News is being taken over by liberals trying to undermine him, as his war on the network escalates\n\nFox anchors have hit back at the president's criticisms, with host Neil Cavuto saying in late August that Fox News staff \"don't work for you.\"\n\n\"Well, first of all, Mr. President, we don't work for you. I don't work for you. My job is to cover you, not fawn over you or rip you, just report on you,\" Cavuto said on air.\n\nHurricane Dorian's trajectory appears to have been altered with black marker. White House/Twitter\n\nAlthough he did not respond directly to Smith's criticism, Trump continued to push his false claims about the trajectory of Hurricane Dorian, tweeting about it twice on Thursday.\n\nIn one tweet, he shared a message from the Alabama National Guard on August 30 saying that Dorian was \"projected to reach southern Alabama by the early part of the week.\"\n\nIn another tweet, Trump shared several hurricane trajectory projections from Thursday and Friday last week, saying: \"Just as I said, Alabama was originally projected to be hit. The Fake News denies it!\"", "description": "Speaking on his show Thursday night, Shephard Smith asked: \"Why would the president of the United States do this?\"", "authors": ["Will Martin"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d72158d2e22af1037751b43-1334-667.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
