Washington has lost five of six games since the big comeback 11-10 win at home Sept. 4 against the New York Mets.\n\nThis is the first time the Nationals have lost five of six since dropping five in a row from May 19-23. The good news is Washington (79-64) is ahead of the Chicago Cubs (77-67) and the Milwaukee Brewers (76-68) for the top spot in the wild-card chase.\n\nThe Brewers lost MVP candidate Christian Yelich (.329, 44 homers) for the season Tuesday when he fouled a ball off his kneecap. Milwaukee still won its fifth straight game, beating the Miami Marlins 4-3.\n\nThe Cubs lost 9-8 Tuesday in 10 innings at the San Diego Padres as the winning run scored on a bases-loaded walk.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
