Consequently, Cointelegraph has been unable to publish anything on the account for over a month now, unable to reach the audience. Cointelegraph has reached out to Facebook for additional comments regarding the reason why the page has been unpublished but received no response.\n\nEarlier, Cointelegraph\u2019s Facebook page was blocked during the period of Aug. 1 to Aug. 11, soon after we published a documentary on the use of cryptocurrencies in the adult entertainment industry titled \u201cSex & Crypto\u201d and shared it on Facebook, among other social media platforms. Again, Facebook did not specify the precise reason for unpublishing the page at the time nor whether the documentary was the reason for it. On Aug. 12, Cointelegraph was given access to the page back, but \u2014 given our current ban \u2014 not for long.\n\nMeanwhile, Cointelegraph\u2019s account on Instagram \u2014 a social media platform also controlled by Facebook \u2014 remains active. The social media company has yet to provide a clear explanation as to why the page was banned.\n\nAccording to Facebook\u2019s \u201cgeneral policies for pages, groups, and events,\u201d pages are prohibited from being \u201cmisleading, fraudulent or deceptive,\u201d none of which seem to describe the nature of Cointelegraph\u2019s coverage. Additionally, pages \u201cmust not facilitate or promote online gambling, online real money, games of skill or online lotteries without our prior written permission.\u201d\n\nAlthough we at Cointelegraph do consider digital assets to be a major part of the contemporary financial world \u2014 and, by extension, \u201cmoney\u201d \u2014 we\u2019re not certain that \u201conline real money\u201d implies \u201ccryptocurrencies\u201d in Facebook\u2019s terminology.\n\nNevertheless, Facebook does have a history with strictly cryptocurrency-focused content. In early 2018, the company became the first major social media platform to ban cryptocurrency-related ads. By doing so, it set a precedent for other big tech companies, namely Google and Twitter, which soon followed suit and introduced similar regulations on their platforms.\n\nThe social media giant is most recently in the news in the wake of Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s six-hour Congressional testimony yesterday, Oct. 23. The company is under fire for its joint effort to launch a new cryptocurrency called Libra \u2014 regulators are less than enthusiastic about it.\n\nRelated: Internet Authority: History of Centralized Companies Being Hostile Toward Crypto\n\nIn any case, Facebook announced that it would prohibit ads that use \u201cmisleading or deceptive promotional practices,\u201d referring specifically to initial coin offerings (ICOs) and cryptocurrencies. The accompanying blog post read:\n\n\u201cWe want people to continue to discover and learn about new products and services through Facebook ads without fear of scams or deception. That said, there are many companies who are advertising binary options, ICOs and cryptocurrencies that are not currently operating in good faith.\u201d\n\nThe ban was \u201cintentionally broad,\u201d meaning that the social media company chose to ban all cryptocurrency ads on its platforms first and then learn how to pick out the ones that are \u201cdeceptive.\u201d Cointelegraph experienced no problems covering cryptocurrencies and blockchain news on Facebook during that period.\n\nSix months later, in June 2018, Facebook partly backpedaled on the ban, once again allowing cryptocurrency ads on its platform \u2014 this time, however, only from preapproved parties \u2014 while the ban on ICOs was kept in full effect. Further, in May 2019, Facebook updated its advertising policy once again, loosening the crypto-ban to an even larger extent: Ads pertaining to blockchain tech, industry news, as well as events and educational materials for cryptocurrencies could now be displayed on the platform without prior approval.\n\nRelated: Crypto Advertisement Still Unwelcome, How Is the Industry Coping?\n\nAccording to the statement provided to Cointelegraph by a Facebook spokesperson last summer, the company took time to work on the policy:\n\n\u201cIn 2018, we made clear this policy was broad \u2014 along with our hope to refine it while working to better detect deceptive and misleading advertising practices. After a thorough review, the policy was narrowed to no longer require prior approval to run ads related to blockchain technology, industry news, education, and events related to cryptocurrency.\u201d\n\nGiven this \u2014 along with the fact that Cointelegraph does not promote any ICO as per its editorial policy nor do we run sponsored material without clearly labeling it as such and conducting thorough due diligence beforehand \u2014 none of this explains why our page was blocked.\n\nMoreover, despite Facebook\u2019s measures, actual fraud-related crypto ads still manage to find their way onto the platform. Select cases have even resulted in multimillion dollar lawsuits filed against the social media giant.\n\nCointelegraph has reached out to fellow cryptocurrency-focused publications to see if they have been experiencing problems with Facebook. Jonas Borchgrevink, director of CCN, said that they \u201chave been limited on Facebook to promote news stories.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have already decided to not use Facebook going forward.\u201d Kevin Worth, CEO of CoinDesk, said that his publication has not experienced similar problems \u201cin recent years.\u201d\n\nAs of press time, CCN's Facebook page has approximately 27,000 followers, while CoinDesk's has 82,000. Cointelegraph's page had 720,000 prior to being unpublished.", "description": "Cointelegraph has been locked out of its Facebook page for more than a month; the social media company offers no explanation...", "authors": ["Stephen O'Neal"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvOTA5OWRlYmRkYzMxOTMyNjFlOWMwNzM0MDcxOTc5YjcuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
