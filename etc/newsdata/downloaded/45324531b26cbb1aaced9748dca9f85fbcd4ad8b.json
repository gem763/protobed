That\u2019s how so many of us communicate these days. It may be more efficient in many cases, but some topics \u2014 including the future of agriculture \u2014 require a bit of a deeper dive.\n\nTake a newly released report from the United Nation\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Climate Change and Land, which paints a grim picture of agriculture\u2019s future, noting that we must completely transform how we use our land and grow our food. As head of a leading global agricultural company, I couldn\u2019t agree more. While it\u2019s important to acknowledge that agricultural innovation has been very successful in finding new ways to feed, clothe and shelter a rapidly growing world, it\u2019s also clear that we cannot continue to meet our future challenges by relying on our past practices.\n\nThe IPCC report takes a comprehensive look at land and climate as a dynamic, interrelated system. Each plays an important role in affecting the other. Agriculture, forestry and other land uses account for 23 percent of human greenhouse gas emissions, while simultaneously absorbing the equivalent of almost a third of the carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and industrial activities. The challenges are indeed immense, but the IPCC report provides a reason for hope. With the adoption of more sustainable and restorative land management practices, we can figuratively have our cake and eat it, too.\n\nSolving the formidable challenges facing us requires a serious examination of what is known as agriculture\u2019s paradox \u2014 how to safely feed a growing population while preserving precious natural resources on a dwindling amount of farmland.\n\nThere couldn\u2019t be more important time to tackle these challenges together. They can be solved only with collaboration, dialogue and a collection of voices at the table.\n\nEngaging in deeper conversations is the explicit purpose behind the Future of Farming Dialogue, an annual summit hosted by Bayer from September 30 to October 2 that brings together leading global industry experts and stakeholders to engage in a collaborative discussion on food production, which begins later this month.\n\nAgriculture must be part of the solution for a healthier planet as we recognize calls for producing food, fuel and fiber safely, sustainably and using fewer resources.\n\nAdditionally, I recently met with farmers, consumers, and public policy, NGO and food chain representatives at roundtable events held in the Netherlands, Berlin and New York to discuss how to work toward a more sustainable food system, and reduce agriculture\u2019s impact on the environment. We still have our differences, but there\u2019s a lot we agree on, too.\n\nNearly everyone agrees that we need a sufficient food supply that is safe and secure, but there is little agreement on how we can best accomplish this goal. At a time when so many social conversations occur in tweets and posts, a deeper dialogue is critically needed to bridge the differences that all too often divide producers and consumers.\n\nAgriculture must be part of the solution for a healthier planet as we recognize calls for producing food, fuel and fiber safely, sustainably and using fewer resources. Few people understand the importance of preserving the environment better than farmers, who are entirely dependent on the land for their livelihood. I believe that agriculture can meet this challenge the way it always has, by unlocking human ingenuity to spark the breakthroughs needed to make what was once unimaginable possible.\n\nWe know that innovation is the key to farming\u2019s future, and we are already seeing how new technologies \u2014 including digital farming, precision agriculture and plant breeding tools \u2014 are lessening agriculture\u2019s ecological footprint. For example, farmers in South America have planted millions of hectares of soybean seeds, which require fewer pesticides and allows them to adopt more sustainable practices. This has kept 6.8 billion kilograms of carbon \u2014 the equivalent of 3.3 million cars \u2014 in the ground where it belongs. In addition to carbon sequestration, by increasing productivity in a sustainable manner on available land, deforestation can be avoided and biodiversity protected. And today more farmers are using the latest in digital analytics to help them prevent problems before they start, so that they can grow more food while using less land, energy and water.\n\nWe are already seeing how new technologies \u2014 including digital farming, precision agriculture and plant breeding tools \u2014 are lessening agriculture\u2019s ecological footprint.\n\nWe believe every investment in innovation should also be an investment in sustainability. This is why, earlier this year, Bayer announced a three-pronged commitment to:\n\nReduce our environmental impact on crop production by 30 percent.\n\nWork toward a carbon-neutral future for agriculture in the main regions we serve.\n\nEmpower 100 million smallholder farmers around the world by providing more access to sustainable farming solutions \u2013 all by the year 2030.\n\nWhat I love about agriculture, one of the world\u2019s oldest industries, is that it must constantly reinvent itself to keep up with an ever-changing world. And while I\u2019m proud of agricultural innovation and what it has done for humanity, I recognize that people have different perspectives about food and farming. But I also believe we all share the same planet and we all want to leave the world a better place than where we found it. It\u2019s time to put aside our differences and find ways to work together to address our global food needs and our environmental challenges. It\u2019s not about of who is right or who is wrong. It\u2019s about ensuring there will be a tomorrow and a better life for generations to come.\n\nAuthors:", "description": "Solving agriculture\u2019s paradox of feeding the world and protecting the planet", "authors": ["Liam Condon", "Member Of The Board Of Management Of Bayer Ag", "President Of The Crop Science Division"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Children_running_in_a_field-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
