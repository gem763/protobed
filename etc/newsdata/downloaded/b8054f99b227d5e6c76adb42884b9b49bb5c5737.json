However, people testify before legislative bodies generally for a handful of reasons. The first and most obvious is that they have some kind of relevant expertise. They\u2019re knowledgable on a given topic and they need to share that knowledge with members of Congress so they can make a semi-informed decision. I say semi-informed because, well, it\u2019s Congress. Let\u2019s be real here.\n\nAnother popular reason is emotion. They bring in people who lawmakers think can elicit the proper emotions and force people to throw rationality out the window.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why the mayor of Dayton, Ohio was asked to come chat.\n\nDayton Mayor Nan Whaley testified Wednesday morning, Sept. 25, 2019, in front of the House Judiciary Committee. She spoke about the Aug. 4 mass shooting in the city\u2019s historic Oregon District, which killed nine and injured 17 others. \u201cThe entire incident was over in half as much time as I\u2019ve been speaking to you so far today,\u201d Whaley said. \u201cIn those 32 seconds, the shooter\u2019s weapon did exactly what it was designed to do: kill or injure as many people as possible in the shortest amount of time.\u201d The mayor said young people who were in the Oregon District that night talk about their new fear of crowds, and bartenders who work there are now consumed with anxiety at the sound of sirens. \u201cOur city is hurting. All because a young man with a history of violent ideas could get his hands on a weapon capable of such destruction,\u201d Whaley told the committee.\n\nAnd it was already illegal for him to do so due to the drugs he took already.\n\nDid you mention that, Mayor Whaley?\n\nNote that this quote includes very few facts. It\u2019s about fear and emotion. People are scared. They\u2019re anxious. They\u2019re suffering because of one person\u2019s actions. But there\u2019s no mention of how statistically improbable it is to be involved in a mass shooting so there\u2019s little reason for them to feel this way. There\u2019s no mention of how the shooter broke the law by lying on the Form 4473. None of that is included.\n\nThose would be facts, and Whaley wasn\u2019t brought in to testify about facts. Democrats brought her in to talk about feelings, to talk about fear because that\u2019s what they want everyone to feel. They want people to be scared, so scared that they simply demand action on so-called assault weapons. They want people terrified, so terrified that they\u2019ll willingly give up their liberty for the illusion of safety.\n\nHowever, let\u2019s talk a few facts.\n\nWhat happened in Dayton was horrific, but let\u2019s look at history. In recent history, the Santa Fe High School shooting killed 10 people, the same number as in Dayton. The weapons used were a shotgun and a revolver. No assault weapons.\n\nOne of the deadliest mass shootings in American history is the Virginia Tech shooting. The shooter there murdered 31 people before killing himself\u2026with a couple of handguns. The University of Texas shooting included no so-called assault rifles, but 15 people were killed, plus the shooter, in that incident. The Edmond Post Office shooting in claimed 13 lives plus the killer\u2019s, all with handguns.\n\nThese are just a handful of the mass shootings carried out with weapons other than so-called \u201cassault rifles.\u201d\n\nYet Whaley didn\u2019t testify about that. That\u2019s not why she was asked to testify. She had no relevant expertise on the topic. She wasn\u2019t even a witness. She\u2019s just an anti-gun voice who has some tie to a horrible event and is more than willing to try and offer up enough fear that reason goes right out the door.\n\nFrankly, it\u2019s disgusting, but then again, it\u2019s Congress.
