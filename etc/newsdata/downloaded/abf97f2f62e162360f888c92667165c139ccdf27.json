Four products were found to contain more than the daily limit in a single can.\n\n\"Excessive caffeine intake deters calcium absorption, negatively affecting adolescents' growth,\" the agency said.\n\nReflecting such concerns, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said that TV commercials for the drinks will be banned between the peak teenage viewing hours of 5 p.m. to 7 p.m. from next year.\n\nIn addition, the consumer rights watchdog plans to ask the nation's food and drug safety authority to limit the amount of caffeine per can, and ban the sale of energy drinks to minors.", "description": "Heavily Caffeinated Energy Drinks Stoke Fears", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2013-11-18"}
