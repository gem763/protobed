The spiritual stimulus each has provided has enabled human cooperation to extend from the clan and tribe to the city-state and nation. Each of these great teachers promised that, in time, another divine figure would appear, whose advent and influence would reform the world. No wonder, then, that the coming of the Bab, whose birth two centuries ago we now honour, gave rise to unprecedented ferment in the country where he was born. The moment of his appearance, like the appearance of all such figures, precipitated the release of powerful spiritual forces.\n\nThe Bab\u2019s influence spread rapidly, beyond Persia. Like a spring storm, the Bab came to purge and purify, to uproot the withered and spent customs of a wayward age, and to wash away the obscuring dust from the eyes of those blinded by illusion. But the Bab had a special object \u2013 to prepare people for the imminent appearance of Baha\u2019u\u2019llah, the second of the twin luminaries destined to bring new light to humankind. This was his most insistent theme. \u201cWhen the daystar of Baha will shine resplendent above the horizon of eternity,\u201d he instructed his followers, \u201cit is incumbent upon you to present yourselves before his throne.\u201d\n\nThus, did the Bab and Baha\u2019u\u2019llah, illuminate a society and an age shrouded in darkness. They inaugurated a new stage in social evolution: that of unification of the entire human family. The spiritual energies they released infused new life into every sphere of endeavour, the results of which are evident in the transformation that has occurred.\n\nMaterial civilisation has advanced immeasurably; astounding breakthroughs in science and technology have been achieved; the gates to the accumulated knowledge of humanity have been flung open. Nevertheless, arguments against these values, previously confined to the margins of serious thought, are also resurgent in society \u2013 a reminder that ideals require the force of spiritual commitment to cement them. For it is one thing to acknowledge something in principle; it is quite another to embrace it with all of one\u2019s heart, and harder still to refashion society in ways that give collective expression to it. Yet, this is the aim of communities emerging across the globe that are patterned on Baha\u2019u\u2019llah\u2019s teachings. These communities are striving to focus the light of those teachings on the chronic problems that afflict societies around them; they are devising programmes of practical action centred on spiritual precepts. They seek to bring about spiritual, social, and material progress simultaneously.\n\nAbove all, these are communities that define themselves by their commitment to the oneness of humanity. They value the rich diversity represented by all the world\u2019s kindreds, while maintaining that one\u2019s identity as a member of the human race has precedence before other identities and associations. They affirm the need for a global consciousness, arising from a shared concern for the well-being of humankind, and they count all the peoples of the earth as spiritual brothers and sisters. Not content with simply belonging to such communities, Baha\u2019u\u2019llah\u2019s followers are making constant effort to invite like-minded souls to join them in learning how to put his teachings into effect.\n\nToday is the bicentenary of the Bab\u2019s birth", "description": "The Baha\u2019i Community The appearance of every divine educator, as recorded in sacred texts of great faiths, is a pivotal event that propels the advancement of civilisation.
