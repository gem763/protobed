Yet at the same time, the undefeated UFC light heavyweight contender seemed so comfortable with the bright lights of his first main event.\n\nNo, he didn\u2019t get the same pop from the crowd as Chris Weidman or Jeremy Stephens, but his aura did have everyone paying attention.\n\nOn Friday night, Reyes (11-0 MMA, 5-0 UFC) takes on the most notable opponent of his career in Chris Weidman (14-4 MMA, 10-4 UFC) at UFC on ESPN 6.\n\nAs Reyes walked to the boxing ring, he began to feed off the energy from the music playing in the gym. When the opening beat for Joyner Lucas\u2019 \u201cI Love\u201d dropped, Reyes really began to feel it. Amped by the song selection, or maybe just the overall setting, Reyes smacked the pads with kicks and punches \u2013 and even accidentally split open his own brother and sparring partner.\n\nAt the conclusion of the workout, Reyes opened up on the feelings he\u2019s been experiencing as the fight nears.\n\n\u201cThis is my show. This is my main event. I\u2019m the red corner. Very excited about it,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cI got a little hyped, cut my brother real quick. It\u2019s a little cut, but still \u2026 this is exactly where I want to be. This is where I want to be. Riding with my loved ones.\u201d\n\nWhether he\u2019s enjoying the local sights in Boston with family and friends or reflecting on his journey to UFC headliner, Reyes appears comfortable this fight week.\n\n\u201cIn Boston, the city is beautiful,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cThe people here are super cool. Having my family around, my team, and my boys, it means a lot. It makes me feel at ease. I\u2019m in my element. I\u2019m in my zone, and when I\u2019m in my zone, it\u2019s a dangerous place for my opponent.\u201d\n\nFighting an opponent like Weidman, Reyes sees great upside if he does pull off the victory. While \u201cThe All American\u201d has great name recognition, Reyes believes he has the more convincing resume. Situationally, they are both each other\u2019s ideal opponent, according to Reyes.\n\n\u201cWhat he brings to the table is his name,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cI bring the rankings. I\u2019m ranked high in the rankings, so he thinks knocking me off is going to bring him closer to the title.\n\n\u201cMe taking him out with his big name brings me closer to the title. We\u2019re both bringing something to the table, and I look forward to knocking out my signature win.\u201d\n\nIn Reyes\u2019 eyes, who will get the victory boils down to one simple question: Can Chris Weidman\u2019s chin hold up at UFC on ESPN 6?\n\n\u201cThat remains to be seen,\u201d Reyes said. \u201cThat\u2019s the question we all have. Will his chin hold up? I don\u2019t think it will. He\u2019s been in some real wars, man \u2013 a lot of wars. These fights aren\u2019t just like quick fights. He\u2019s not getting quick knockouts.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s fighting, he\u2019s bleeding, he\u2019s getting shots. Every shot takes a little bit off your energy bar. \u2026 He\u2019s getting knocked out, so I\u2019m going to capitalize on that.\u201d", "description": "Dominick Reyes doesn't expect Chris Weidman's chin to hold up in their UFC Boston headliner.", "authors": ["Nolan King", "Simon Samano", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Head", "Farah Hannoun"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/dominick-reyes-ufc-london-ceremonial-weigh-ins.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
