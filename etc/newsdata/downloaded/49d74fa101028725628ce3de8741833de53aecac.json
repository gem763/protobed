REUTERS/Christian Hartmann\n\nHandke\u2019s prize has attracted criticism, including from survivors of the 1995 Srebrenica massacre who have called for the academy to revoke the 9 million Swedish crown ($930,000) award it announced last week.\n\nIn 2006, Handke spoke at the funeral of late Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, who died while in detention awaiting trial at the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague for his role in the wars in Balkans in the 1990s.\n\nHandke also voiced support for Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, who were convicted of genocide for the killing of more then 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the United Nations protected enclave of Srebrenica.\n\nIn an article published on Thursday in the Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter, Mats Malm, the head of the Swedish Academy, accepted that Handke had made \u201cprovocative, unsuitable and unclear comments in political questions\u201d.\n\nBut he said the author of \u201cThe Goalie\u2019s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick\u201d and \u201cSlow Homecoming\u201d had not glorified bloodshed and had clearly condemned the Srebrenica massacre.\n\n\u201cThe Academy ... has not found anything in his writing that constitutes an attack on civil society or on the respect for the equality of all people,\u201d Malm wrote.\n\nThe Academy quoted an article from 2006 in the German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung in which Handke said the Srebrenica massacre was the worst crime against humanity in Europe since Word War Two.\n\nThe Academy was forced to postpone the 2018 Literature prize after a scandal that led to the husband of one member being convicted of rape.\n\nAlbanian Prime Minister Edi Rama has accused the Academy of \u201cdiminishing the value of the prize\u201d by awarding it to Handke and \u201cwading into yet another scandal that will tarnish its reputation for decades to come.\u201d\n\nThe Academy\u2019s decision has been widely criticised in Albania and Kosovo, where an estimated 10,000 ethnic Albanians were killed and almost 1 million put to flight during a 1998-99 war waged by forces under Milosevic.\n\nMunira Subasic, president of the Mothers of Srebrenica association which represents survivors of the 1995 massacre, told Reuters the Swedish Academy\u2019s decision was \u201cshameful\u201d.", "description": "The Swedish Academy has defended its decision to award the 2019 Nobel Prize for Literature to Austrian writer Peter Handke, saying he had made provocative comments but had not supported bloodshed.", "authors": ["Simon Johnson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441862051&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G13J", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
