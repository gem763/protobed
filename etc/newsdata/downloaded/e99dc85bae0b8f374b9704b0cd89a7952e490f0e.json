The tech giant also said that Live Action, its links and Rose's page would now have reduced distribution and other restrictions because of repeatedly sharing false news.\n\n218 ALLEGED EMAIL SCAMMERS ARRESTED IN GLOBAL CRACKDOWN\n\nOne video, titled \u201cThe Pro-Life Reply to \u2018Abortion Can Be Medically Necessary\u2019,\u201d features neonatologist Dr. Kendra Kolb. The second video, titled \"Abortion is NEVER Medically Necessary,\" features a speech given by Rose.\n\nLive Action and Rose's Facebook page reach more than 3 million followers combined.\n\nThe senators' letter questions Facebook's fact checking operation, which is done in partnership with third parties that have been certified by the International Fact-Checking Network, claiming that two of the people involved in the fact check are \"biased\" against the pro-life group.\n\nAccording to Live Action, just today Facebook added another violation to the nonprofit group's page and sent an alert to over 2,000 of their followers that their content was \"false.\"\n\nHowever, on Wednesday afternoon Rose tweeted that Facebook will be updating its fact checking process and removing strikes from the group's accounts.\n\nDID THESE APPS TELL FACEBOOK ABOUT THE LAST TIME YOU HAD SEX?\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"If this isn't bias, what is?\" the senators wrote, before demanding an audit that allows the company's top executives to be grilled. \"The only thing more astonishing than your claim to nonpartisanship is your complete failure to back that claim with proof.\"\n\nOn Wednesday evening, the International Fact-Checking Network released a statement saying that it is investigating accusations against Science Feedback, which conducted the fact check of Live Action.\n\n\"Today, we were informed that one of our verified signatories is being accused of violating IFCN\u2019s Code of Principles on its first commitment to non-partisanship in one of the fact-checks it has published,\" Baybars Orsek, IFCN's director, said in the statement. \"Health Feedback, an arm of Science Feedback, rated a claim about abortion as inaccurate. The information was in a video posted by a publisher on Facebook. Some media outlets have published today that two of the scientists who contributed to that fact check are reported to be affiliated with advocacy groups within that policy area.\"\n\nThe IFCN has contacted the fact-checking platform with a list of case-specific questions and expects a response within one week. Once they have that information it will be reviewed to see if the group's Code of Principles was followed correctly -- but if Science Feedback is found to be in violation, they may be required to take steps to correct the mistake.\n\nFox News' James Rogers and Judson Berger contributed to this report.", "description": "Four Republican senators blasted Facebook for 'censorship' over the tech giant's recent fact check of pro-life organization Live Action.", "authors": ["Christopher Carbone"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/HarvardStudentFindsFlawLosesFacebookInternship.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
