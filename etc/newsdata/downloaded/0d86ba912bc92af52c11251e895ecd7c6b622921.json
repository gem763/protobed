I\u2019ve heard already that other women have been told to do the same, so the modus operandi of this guy is almost the same,\" Cele said.\n\n\"The young lady\u2026 indeed comes back, with all the innocence in the world but she begins to realise that there is a problem here. This guy attacks this young woman, this young woman fights, she fought back heavily, parents.
