REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nTrump, speaking alongside Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, questioned him about the request that the Chinese delay a trip to meet with U.S. farmers in Montana and Nebraska. Mnuchin had said the trip was delayed at the administration\u2019s request to avoid confusion over the talks.\n\n\u201cWhy was that our request, just out of curiosity?\u201d Trump asked.\n\nMnuchin explained again that the U.S. side \u201cdidn\u2019t want confusion around the trade issues.\u201d\n\nTrump then interjected: \u201cYeah, but I want them to buy farm products.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was no confusion,\u201d Mnuchin replied. \u201cWe want them to buy agriculture. They have committed to buy agriculture. And they\u2019re doing that\u201d\n\nTrump added that China had \u201ccommitted to buy a lot of agriculture\u201d and the United States should ship the products as fast as possible.\n\nThe exchange came after Chicago grain traders said Chinese importers on Monday had bought about 10 boatloads of U.S. soybeans - around 600,000 tonnes - to be shipped from Pacific Northwest ports from October through December. News of the deals sent soybean futures prices higher.\n\nCancellation of the planned trip cast a pall over the conclusion of two days of U.S.-China trade talks last week, sending U.S. stocks lower.\n\nPeople familiar with the talks said that there were no new substantive offers made, but both the U.S. and Chinese sides said the talks were productive, and that minister-level talks would take place in early October.\n\nMnuchin stressed that the Chinese purchases of U.S. agriculture were \u201cgood news\u201d in an interview with Fox Business Network and downplayed any significance to the delay of the Chinese officials\u2019 visit to U.S. farming regions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sign of good gesture that they are back at the table buying agriculture,\u201d Mnuchin told Fox Business Network.\n\n\u201cWe just decided the timing of the trip wasn\u2019t necessarily the perfect timing, so they\u2019ll be rescheduling that to after our trade meetings,\u201d he added.\n\nMnuchin said in the television interview that trade talks with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer were set to resume in two weeks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s actually, I think, it\u2019s not next week, but the following week we\u2019ll be having those talks,\u201d Mnuchin said.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Mnuchin told reporters at the United Nations General Assembly that the trade talks would resume next week.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday questioned a decision by his top trade negotiators to ask Chinese officials to delay a planned trip to U.S. farming regions after trade talks last week, saying he wanted China to buy more American farm products.", "authors": ["Steve Holland", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1433110798&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M25N", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
