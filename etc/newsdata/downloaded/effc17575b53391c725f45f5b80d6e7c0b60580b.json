The concerns are particularly acute in New Hampshire.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cSeeing the campaign not be able to outshine Warren with WFP progressives doesn\u2019t have me questioning WFP\u2019s process,\u201d said Rafael Shimunov, a former national creative director for WFP and 2016 Sanders volunteer. \u201cIt has me questioning where the Bernie campaign could have done better, because I want to make sure the strongest candidate unmasks Biden and unseats Trump.\u201d\n\nThe worries come as the campaign enters a critical, more urgent phase. After Labor Day, more voters typically tune in to an election and begin to make up their minds. Expectations for Sanders are sky-high, especially in New Hampshire, where he defeated Hillary Clinton in 2016 by 22 percentage points.\n\nBut Warren has jumped in the national polls to tie Sanders for second place, and Joe Biden has proved harder to knock off his first-place perch than his rivals expected.\n\n\u201cIn 2016, Bernie was the David who beat Goliath in New Hampshire \u2014 the expectations this time around are incomparable,\u201d said Andrew Feldman, a Democratic strategist with close ties to labor groups. \u201cIt would be a mistake to try to replicate the type of campaign that Sanders ran in New Hampshire in 2016 because the dynamics of this race are completely different. For Sanders to be successful, a professional operation is critical.\u201d\n\nJeff Weaver, a top Sanders adviser, told POLITICO that numerous rank-and-file members in the WFP support Sanders and that his ground game in New Hampshire and other early states is strong. The Sanders campaign says it has 14 times as many identified voters in the Granite State than it had at this time in 2016 and it is doubling his field staff there from 26 to 50 employees. He said the campaign\u2019s national and states staff are in daily contact, and that he has a regular \u201cstates call\u201d in which he asks his aides across the country to be honest about the problems they\u2019re seeing.\n\nIf some of Sanders\u2019 allies in New Hampshire have jitters, Weaver said, it is because they are wrongly comparing the 2020 campaign with his first bid for the White House, when he took the lead in the state by August and vastly out-organized Clinton.\n\n\u201cLast time, our field program was so far superior that I think it may color people\u2019s views,\u201d Weaver said. Now, \u201csome of our competitors do have good field programs \u2014 Elizabeth Warren is one of them.\u201d He added, \u201cSome people are trying to position themselves in quote-un-quote Bernie\u2019s lane. But as the campaign goes on, people who want a bold, progressive vision for the country will come back to Bernie Sanders.\u201d\n\nSanders has received good news in New Hampshire recently, including a Franklin Pierce University-Boston Herald poll last week that showed him in first place with 29 percent, Biden in second with 21 percent, and Warren in third with 17 percent. But that was quickly overtaken by bad press about the staff reorganization.\n\nSanders\u2019 top brass told Joe Caiazzo, his New Hampshire state director, that he was being reassigned on Thursday. Around the same time, the Sanders team also parted ways with Kurt Ehrenberg, a well-respected liberal activist in the state. Though the campaign had days to prepare a media rollout of the staff changes, the news broke on Sunday shortly after Sanders\u2019 aides told his state steering committee that Caiazzo would be shipped off to be Massachusetts state director.\n\nBy that point, members of the committee were going public with their concerns. POLITICO spoke with nearly a dozen current and former Sanders advisers and allies, some of whom declined to discuss internal dynamics on the record because of fear of retribution. Since Sunday, campaign staffers have been calling members of their steering committee, asking them not to speak to the media because stories about the internal shakeup were published, according to three people who received the calls.\n\nWeaver said Caiazzo was reassigned to Warren\u2019s home state because he has years of experience there, including as Sanders\u2019 political director in 2016, and the campaign is \u201cnot conceding Massachusetts to anyone.\u201d He said Caiazzo had done a \u201cgreat job\u201d building the team in New Hampshire and that the shift was part of a series of changes aimed at growing the campaign\u2019s operations in Super Tuesday states. Sanders' team said it also recently hired senior staff in Oklahoma, Colorado and Minnesota.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another example of the campaign bungling things,\u201d said a person with knowledge of the situation. Instead of talking about \u201cmaking aggressive moves here and building out Super Tuesday states \u2026 they\u2019re answering bad press about why they\u2019re moving their New Hampshire state director.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 allies have raised several concerns about New Hampshire in recent weeks. Caiazzo warned about the staff\u2019s productivity in the state, a source said. A former Sanders adviser said the campaign is \u201cboth physically and mentally based in Washington, D.C.,\u201d and therefore too disconnected from on-the-ground state operations. Members of Sanders\u2019 steering committee in New Hampshire said they worry Warren and others have a better ground game.\n\nCaiazzo and Ehrenberg had also clashed: \u201cThere was some personality rubs, frankly,\u201d Weaver acknowledged.\n\nAt the same time, some Sanders supporters are distressed that he didn\u2019t win WFP\u2019s endorsement. The loss especially stung because they believe he has the most progressive labor plan of any presidential candidate in history: His proposal calls for European-style collective bargaining across industries. Sanders has also stepped up his efforts to win more institutional support than in 2016, and his national political director, Analilia Mejia, previously was executive director of the New Jersey Working Families Alliance.\n\nMany Sanders\u2019 supporters blame WFP\u2019s leaders for making the wrong choice and knock them for not releasing their individual vote tally of online members. But some, like Shimunov, said they didn\u2019t question it and noted the campaign had agreed to abide by the rules ahead of time.\n\nSanders\u2019 team declined to share details about what it did to try to secure the endorsement.\n\nSome of Sanders\u2019 allies said his challenges are deeper than any staff or communication issues. Warren, like Sanders, is a left-wing populist \u2014 and though the two candidates had fairly different bases a few months ago, there are signs that\u2019s starting to change.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO.

Unlike Clinton\u2019s in 2016, Biden\u2019s campaign has proved more nimble in reading the primary electorate and has at times adopted more liberal proposals in response, they said.\n\nBiden\u2019s team also has borrowed some of Sanders\u2019 movement-building message, with the former vice president saying recently that he would rally voters in Kentucky to bring Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to heel.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Bernie\u2019s doing poorly, but not as well as some people would like,\u201d a Sanders ally said of his campaign in New Hampshire. \u201cSometimes personnel changes aren\u2019t to do with personnel having failed. ... But if the change energizes people, whether or not it was actually necessary, that\u2019s probably a good thing.\u201d\n\nEven some of Sanders\u2019 rivals said it would be unwise to discount him. Despite the concerns about his ground game in New Hampshire, his volunteer army remains formidable: A Boston Globe/Suffolk University poll released in August found that 35 percent of Democratic primary voters in the state who had heard directly from a campaign had been contacted by Sanders\u2019 team, more than any other candidate.\n\n\"I think he will do well here, frankly, but I'm a bit of a contrarian on that. Everyone seems to be in a big rush to write him off,\u201d said a top New Hampshire Democrat and veteran of many presidential primaries in the state. \u201cJohn McCain and John Kerry were both deemed 'dead men walking' at this stage, too, and came back to win the New Hampshire primary.\u201d", "description": "A staff shakeup and loss of an endorsement to Elizabeth Warren has allies warning of deeper problems.", "authors": ["Holly Otterbein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a6/f7/c0ab99d44ca69738dfddfe8cac14/190917-bernie-sanders-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
