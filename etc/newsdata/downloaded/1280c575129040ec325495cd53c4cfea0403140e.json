Imagine if Bobby Kennedy had resigned in protest after JFK\u2019s bad leadership in the Bay of Pigs disaster. That might be the closest hypothetical parallel to Jo Johnson\u2019s sudden resignation from his older brother Boris Johnson\u2019s Cabinet. Not only did Johnson the Younger quit, but he made it clear that he has no confidence in Johnson the Elder\u2019s leadership:\n\nAfter suffering a humiliating series of Brexit defeats in Parliament, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was dealt a new blow Thursday morning by an unlikely source: his little brother. Jo Johnson announced he was quitting the government and standing down as a member of Parliament, becoming the latest casualty in the war over whether and how the U.K. leaves the European Union. \u201cIn recent weeks I\u2019ve been torn between family loyalty and the national interest,\u201d Johnson, who was a minister in his brother Boris\u2019 Cabinet, said on Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s an unresolvable tension and time for others to take on my roles as MP and minister.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s killed him,\u201d the BBC reports as the reaction to JoJo\u2019s very public exit among other Conservatives. That may be wishful thinking, but it comes at a very difficult time for Boris, who has lost his parliamentary majority and a series of votes on Brexit this week. According to the BBC, JoJo got fed up with BoJo\u2019s purge of longstanding Tories after they refused to support his prorogation of Parliament and the race to an election. His resignation makes prospects for that election look less and less promising.\n\nSpeaking of which, the Guardian reports that JoJo\u2019s not the only Tory disgusted over the purge. Johnson may have split the party badly enough that they can\u2019t possibly get a majority on their own in the upcoming election:\n\nThere is mounting anger in the Conservative party at the expulsion of 21 anti no-deal rebels and the role played in the \u201cpurge\u201d by Dominic Cummings, the prime minister\u2019s de facto chief of staff. One Tory backbencher, Simon Hoare, said there was \u201cdeep disquiet\u201d in the party after the Tory whip was removed from the 21 rebels and they were barred from standing in the next election. \u2026 Damian Green, the former cabinet minister and leader of the One Nation group of Conservatives, called for the reinstatement of the expelled 21 rebels. Speaking to the BBC on Thursday, he said: \u201cI\u2019m afraid it does look as though somebody has decided that the moderate, progressive wing of the Conservative party is not wanted on voyage. \u201cThat\u2019s wrong in principle because there are many Conservative traditions, but it is terrible practical politics to narrow your appeal just before a general election.\u201d\n\nJoJo\u2019s abrupt abandonment of his brother underscores that problem. The familial connections allowed Johnson\u2019s critics to offer some wisecracks at his expense:\n\nThe opposition Labour party seized on his departure. Deputy leader Tom Watson tweeted: \u201cOnce again, the people who trust Boris Johnson least are the ones who know him best.\u201d Pollster Joe Twyman tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a hell of a Christmas lunch in the Johnson household\u201d. BBC journalist David Cornock quipped: \u201cA rare case of a politician resigning to spend less time with his family\u201d\n\nBefore JoJo hit the bricks and took a valedictory swipe at BoJo, Daniel Hannan tried to assure Americans that an election would take place and Brexit would indeed happen. Parliament isn\u2019t in the middle of a Brexit crisis, Hannan said, but in the middle of a democracy crisis. The real question, Hannan argues is whether Parliament will honor a referendum or not:\n\nWhat of the shenanigans at Westminster? Well, one thing that I can state definitively is that they are not a \u201cBrexit crisis.\u201d Brexit, as you must have noticed, has not happened. What we are seeing is the opposite of a Brexit crisis, an \u201cun-Brexit crisis,\u201d a crisis caused by the refusal of MPs to do what they promised to do when they last stood for election. As I write, the Opposition parties are seeking to overturn the referendum result. They don\u2019t exactly phrase it like that, of course. Instead, they say that they don\u2019t want to leave without a deal. But they know perfectly well that, if you rule out a \u201cno-deal Brexit,\u201d you rule out Brexit itself. If \u201cno-deal\u201d is off the table, then all Brussels has to do to keep Britain in the EU is continue to offer intolerable terms.\n\nThat cuts both ways, of course. Theresa May negotiated a withdrawal agreement with the EU that wasn\u2019t \u201cintolerable\u201d to a near-majority of Parliament, but Johnson and others wanted to leave on their own terms \u2014 and while disregarding their sovereign commitments in the Good Friday Agreement. To Ireland and the rest of the EU, that was intolerable. After three years, Johnson and his hard-Brexit allies have yet to float a serious proposal to deal with that situation. If Hannan wants to complain about bad-faith negotiations, the EU has a stronger case to make.\n\nOn the election question, Hannan\u2019s on better ground, but still not convincing:\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, MPs passed a motion obliging the government to seek as many extensions as the EU wanted. Boris Johnson, the prime minister, responded by calling for a general election. Whereupon Labour, which has been demanding an immediate poll for two years, suddenly went cold on the idea. Under legislation passed in 2010, two thirds of MPs must agree to an early dissolution of Parliament. On Wednesday evening, Labour and the other opposition parties, looking at the opinion polls, voted against such a dissolution. Yes, you read that correctly. The parties that have spent the past month accusing Johnson of mounting some sort of coup just voted to prevent him from subjecting his tenure to a national vote.\n\nThat is a rather perverse outcome, but that too is more or less of Boris Johnson\u2019s making. The UK should have held elections after the failure of May\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement to put the issue to voters in the normal democratic process. Instead, Johnson and the Brexiters insisted on keeping control of the government to push through a no-deal Brexit with the rump Tory coalition. Johnson then decided to prorogue Parliament to keep it from having any say at all in the final form of Brexit, which forced Parliament to react in the manner Hannan describes.\n\nHannan also says \u201cvoters are not stupid,\u201d and predicts a Tory majority in the next election as they re-endorse the referendum:\n\nNo one can say how it will turn out, obviously, though the betting markets and the money markets are both predicting a Conservative majority. Such a majority would at last allow Britain to square up to the EU without being undermined.\n\nAhem. Theresa May thought the same thing when she called for snap elections in 2017, and the Tories lost their majority instead. Even so, their coalition has held the majority ever since, and they\u2019ve been \u201csquaring up\u201d to the EU throughout. Hannan\u2019s prediction could well come true anyway, but it relies on the assumption that Leavers all back a crash-out from the EU rather than a negotiated deal that maintains the economic status quo, and that none of them have changed their minds about Brexit over the last three years of futility. That\u2019s a rather large assumption, given that Brexit only won by three points in 2016 and wasn\u2019t predicated on a crash-out but on a negotiated exit.\n\nAdded to that, Boris Johnson wants an election at the same time that his country will have to make disaster preparations for a no-deal Brexit \u2014 while purging his party of incumbents who might be badly needed to establish that majority. Frankly, it\u2019s tough to come up with a better scenario if one wanted to lose a national election on purpose. That might be why JoJo danced out of his big brother\u2019s Cabinet today.", "description": "\u201cA rare case of a politician resigning to spend less time with his family.\u201d", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/jojo-tweet.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
