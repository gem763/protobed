You also tracked Urtula and was nearby when he died in Boston on May 20, the day of his Boston College graduation.\n\nInyoung You, 21, was \"physically, verbally and psychologically abusive\" to fellow Boston College student Alexander Urtula during an 18-month relationship, Suffolk District Attorney Rachael Rollins said at a news conference. Both are pictured above\n\nDistrict Attorney Rachael Rollins acknowledged similarities between You's case and Carter's case but said there were significant differences as well, such as the complete control You had over Urtula\n\nThe case is reminiscent of that of Michelle Carter, the Massachusetts woman who was sentenced to 15 months in jail after she was convicted in 2017 of involuntary manslaughter for using text messages and phone calls to encourage her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, to kill himself in 2014.\n\nRollins acknowledged similarities between You's case and Carter's case but said there were significant differences as well, such as the complete control You had over Urtula.\n\n'Many of the messages display the power dynamic of the relationship, wherein Ms. You made demands and threats with the understanding that she had complete and total control over Mr. Urtula both mentally and emotionally,' Rollins said.\n\nYou isolated Urtula from friends and family and was aware of the depression and suicidal thoughts brought on by her abuse, the district attorney said.\n\nYou is in her native South Korea, and it is unclear when she will be arraigned. Prosecutors are in negotiations with You's counsel to get her to return to the US voluntarily, but if she does not, Rollins said, she will start extradition proceedings.\n\nRepresentatives who could speak for You could not immediately be located. A spokesman for Rollins said he could not disclose the name of You's counsel.\n\nUrtula was a biology major who had completed his course work and was working as a researcher at a hospital in New York at the time of his death, Boston College spokesman Jack Dunn said in an emailed statement. He was also active in the Philippine Society of Boston College, an organization of Filipino American students.\n\nYou studied economics at Boston College and had been scheduled to graduate next May but withdrew in August, Dunn said.\n\nCarter's lawyers maintained her texts were constitutionally protected free speech. Her conviction was upheld by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, but has been appealed to the US Supreme Court, which hasn't yet decided whether it will take up the case.\n\nThe case was likened to that of Michelle Carter, the Massachusetts woman who was sentenced to 15 months in jail after she was convicted in 2017 of involuntary manslaughter for using text messages and phone calls to encourage her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, him to kill himself in 2014", "description": "Inyoung You was", "authors": ["Ralph R.
