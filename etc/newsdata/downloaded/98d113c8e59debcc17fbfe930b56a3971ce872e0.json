Elizabeth Warren speaks to supporters in Memphis, Tenn., March 17, 2019. (Karen Pulfer Focht/Reuters)\n\nSuch a move would further incentivize populist politicians to work outside the system to cultivate celebrity and cults of personality.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren has reignited the debate over the Electoral College \u2014 she wants to get rid of it, naturally. I say \u201creignited\u201d because this is a very old argument. To paraphrase Billy Joel, Warren didn\u2019t start this fire; this debate\u2019s been burning since the world\u2019s been turning. But I\u2019m going to skip rehashing the usual \u2014 and to my mind, persuasive \u2014 arguments in favor of the Electoral College.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArguments against it tend to boil down to two gripes: It\u2019s very old-fashioned, and it\u2019s undemocratic.\n\nIn 2016, the last time we had this kerfuffle, Handbook of Electoral System Choice editor Josep Colomer wrote in the Washington Post: \u201cThe U.S. electoral college is a medieval relic. . . . The United States is the only country in the world to still use the system to elect a president.\u201d\n\nWarren says she wants to get rid of the Electoral College because she wants \u201cevery vote\u201d to matter. The widespread insinuation \u2014 or the assumption \u2014 is that this is how most enlightened democracies do it: a direct election of a single national leader.\n\nThat\u2019s nonsense.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFirst, most democracies don\u2019t have presidents like we do (or at all). We combine the head of state (the symbolic, generally weak representative of the nation) and the head of government (the person who actually calls the shots in politics).\n\nThe U.K. has a monarch (head of state), and a prime minister (head of government). Sometimes a legislative body picks the head of government or head of state. Sometimes voters pick one but not the other. In the Netherlands, the head of state is a monarch and the head of government is elected by the legislature (i.e., the majority party). In New Caledonia the head of government is elected by the legislature, and the head of state is the president of France. Go figure.\n\nThere are countries that combine both roles in one person \u2014 Argentina, Indonesia, Mexico, Ghana, Brazil, Benin, and a few others \u2014 but no Western European country has a unified leader directly elected by the people.\n\nEven this is misleading. As Elaine Kamarck of the Brookings Institution has observed, America is the only advanced democracy that has decided to strip its political parties of the power to select their own candidates. Until 1972 \u2014 through conventions, smoke-filled rooms, etc. \u2014 the parties, not the voters, determined who their presidential candidates would be. This function is among the informal checks and balances that make democracy workable around the globe; we scrapped it in favor of ever more open primaries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmerica now suffers from a political paradox: This is one of the most partisan times in American history, but the parties have never been weaker. Abolishing the Electoral College would make parties even weaker by further incentivizing populist politicians to work outside the system to cultivate celebrity and cults of personality.\n\nI think the way the Electoral College forces candidates to build broader coalitions across the nation is valuable. The way it minimizes the risks of interminable recounts and voter fraud (a single national tally would be a nightmare logistically) is important. But none of these things is essential by itself.\n\nWhat\u2019s essential is the ability to have some check on direct democracy and the centralization of power that comes with it. Our specific constitutional architecture isn\u2019t necessarily sacred, but the underlying idea behind it should be. The Founders understood that democracy depends on some undemocratic mechanisms to maintain liberty. For instance, the Bill of Rights and the Supreme Court are not purely democratic. You can\u2019t vote away my right to free speech, for instance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost of our political problems today are a result of our political gatekeepers surrendering to the mob. All extreme political movements are hostile to restraints on their will. This is what unites the progressives who want to pack the Supreme Court, abolish the Electoral College, and \u201creform\u201d the \u201cundemocratic\u201d Senate with those on the right who celebrate President Trump\u2019s emergency declaration and other attempts to rule by fiat.\n\nIn a healthy democracy, leaders are answerable not just to voters but to legislatures, the courts, the states, and parties. The decades-long trend has been to dismantle this arrangement to make presidents answerable to no one but the slice of electorate that voted for them. And even there, those voters are increasingly more interested in seeing their leader \u201cwin\u201d than in holding them accountable. Abolishing the Electoral College would be another step toward a kind of national absolutism, which is an even worse medieval relic.\n\n\u00a9 2019 Tribune Content Agency LLC", "description": "What\u2019s essential in the preservation of the Electoral College is the ability to have some check on direct democracy and the centralization of power that comes with it.", "authors": ["Jonah Goldberg", "Andrew C.
