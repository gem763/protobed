And it\u2019s perfectly safe in moderation, a nutritionist told Insider.\n\nVisit INSIDER\u2019s homepage for more.\n\nCheddar, brie, mozzarella, or Gouda? Some doctors say your choice of cheese should be none at all, especially if you\u2019re a woman.\n\nThe doctors, members of the nonprofit Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, have petitioned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to add a warning label to cheese made from cow\u2019s milk, cautioning consumers that the hormones it contains may be linked to an increased risk of breast cancer.\n\nThe organization, which is dedicated to promoting health through plant-based nutrition and reducing consumption of animal products, submitted the petition October 3, the start of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Its 12,000 members cited research that high-fat cheese products are linked with up to 53% increase in breast cancer risk.\n\nRead more: 8 foods to avoid if you want to reduce your chances of cancer, diabetes, and early death\n\nBut overall, the research on the health impact of cheese is very mixed \u2013 a 2017 analysis of available evidence found that cheese is linked to no additional risk of death from heart disease or fatal illness of any kind, including cancer.\n\nAnd, according to a nutritionist, it\u2019s perfectly safe for most people to enjoy some cheese as part of a balanced diet, and it may even have some benefits.\n\nSaturated fat and estrogenic hormones in cheese are linked to breast cancer risks\n\nBreast cancer is the second most common cause of death for American woman, with more than 240,000 new cases and more than 40,000 deaths annually, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nCheese is implicated in the problem because a lot of commercial dairy milk comes from cows treated with hormones, which can end up in the milk. The cheese-making process can concentrate some of these hormones like IGF-1, which research has linked to an increased risk of breast cancer.\n\nThe saturated fat in most cheese is also believed to play a role, since studies have found that specifically high-fat dairy raises the risk of breast cancer mortality.\n\n\u201cInstead of cheese manufacturers slapping a pink ribbon on products as they have done during previous Breast Cancer Awareness Months, they should be adding warning labels,\u201d Dr. Neal Barnard, the president of PCRM and author of \u201cThe Cheese Trap\u201d and \u201cYour Body in Balance,\u201d said in a press release. \u201cWe want women to be aware that dairy cheese could put them at risk of dying from breast cancer.\u201d\n\ncaption Diets like the Mediterranean both include cheese and are deemed exceptionally healthy. source Whole Foods/Facebook\n\nBut cheese (and other dairy) can still be part of a healthy diet\n\nLow-fat dairy products may actually have health benefits, the petition notes, citing research that general dairy consumption is linked to a lower risk of cancer overall. Some eating patterns that include cheese like the Mediterranean diet are widely believed to be some of the healthiest in the world.\n\nEven full-fat cheese can be completely safe in moderation, said nutritionist Keri Gans.\n\nRead more: Eating cheese may be associated with a lower risk of death \u2013 and scientists are zeroing in on why it might be a better choice than milk\n\n\u201cThere is no danger in cheese,\u201d Gans said. \u201cWe can\u2019t blame anything on one particular food, as much as we might like to. We need to look at a person\u2019s total diet.\u201d\n\nShe was skeptical of the research on hormones linked to breast cancer in cheese, explaining that the study had too many variables to conclusively point to cheese as the cause of cancer risks without controlling for other lifestyle and dietary factors.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not convinced and I\u2019m not sure the consumer should be either,\u201d she said.\n\nCheese does contain a lot of saturated fat, which is linked to heart disease risk, Gans added. But in that regard, moderation is key \u2013 most people will be just fine enjoying a serving of cheese, even every day, she said. More than two servings per day, over a long period time, may mean you\u2019re getting too much saturated fat, however.\n\n\u201cCheese can definitely be part of a person\u2019s well-balanced diet,\u201d Gans said. \u201cThe key word is \u2018part.'\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nThe health war against cheese may be completely misguided\n\nHow going vegan can affect your body and brain\n\nNew dietary guidelines suggest people should keep eating red meat and processed meat, but nutrition experts says the report is irresponsible", "description": "Business Insider - A nonprofit with 12,000 doctor members has petitioned the FDA.
