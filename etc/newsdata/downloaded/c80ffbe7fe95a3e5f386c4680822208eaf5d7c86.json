He is in Nepal to run the Golden Trail Series (GTS) final on Friday against some of the best mountain runners in the world.\n\nThe GTS has been fought over six races across Europe, and one in America. The top 10 men, and top 10 women, won a place in the final, a 42km race in the Annapurna region.\n\nCanaday\u2019s best result in the series came on his home turf, when he finished second in the Pikes Peak Marathon in Manitou Springs, Colorado. It is a two-hour drive from where he lives, and he was joined by his parents.\n\nIt was a contrast to the other races when he had to travel to Scotland for the Ring of Steall, where he came eighth, or to Sierre-Zinal in Switzerland, where he finished 11th.\n\nRunning in a series, rather than a one-off event, changes the experience for Canaday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely more pressure, but there\u2019s more incentive. I think that\u2019s part of the pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone wants to get that final trip to Nepal, there\u2019s also prize money at some of the races and travel support.\n\n\u201cBut for me, pressure\u2019s a privilege. It\u2019s fun competing against the best and when you have more pressure and competition, it brings out the best in your running. You\u2019re trying to get that maximum performance and improvement,\u201d he said.\n\nAs trail running has grown in popularity, so too has the monetary opportunities. Canaday has seen it change from a grass roots sport, to an employment opportunity.\n\n\u201cYou think of it as a job. I\u2019ve been lucky enough to get enough sponsors and make some prize money in races that if I do well, there\u2019s a livelihood and lifestyle change,\u201d he said. \u201cIt takes a lot of training and hard work, and there\u2019s a lot of risk if you get injured, or if you\u2019re sick or you have a couple of bad years.\u201d\n\nCanaday will be lining up against a field packed with talent. Famous Spaniard Kilian Jornet is competing, along with a host of other runners who could all push for the podium.\n\n\u201cThese guys are so competitive,\u201d he said. \u201cSo the competitive juices will be flowing when the race starts. I think when you\u2019re running in a beautiful mountain area, that\u2019s motivation enough \u2013 the challenge of the climb and of the altitude. I let that motivate me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s never going to be easy. You\u2019ll always have to push your limits,\u201d Canaday said. \u201cYou never know where that will be, but hopefully you can transcend your limits. It will be hard but you enjoy that pain, enjoy the fatigue and enjoy the challenge.\u201d", "description": "The American runner has seen prize money and sponsorship rise in the sport of trail running, adding more pressure, but privilege too, to run", "authors": ["Mark Agnew"], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/24/43773ce8-f585-11e9-87ad-fce8e65242a6_image_hires_094727.jpg?itok=ZyoMtGNI&v=1571881652", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
