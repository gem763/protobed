He also spoke at the 2006 funeral of former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, who at the time was facing war crimes charges. His selection as winner of the International Ibsen Award for drama in 2014 prompted protests from human rights groups.\n\nHandke, a novelist, essayist, playwright and screenwriter, was described by the academy as \"one of the most influential writers in Europe\" after the Second World War. He was praised for writing powerfully about catastrophe, notably in A Sorrow Beyond Dreams, his 1975 novel about his mother's suicide.\n\nHandke's work was described as exploring \"the periphery and the specificity of human experience\" with linguistic ingenuity.\n\nHandke has been described by the Swedish Academy as 'one of the most influential writers in Europe.' (Hugo Correia/Reuters)\n\nTokarczuk won for works that explore the \"crossing of boundaries as a form of life,\" the academy said.\n\nTokarczuk, 57, is one of Poland's best-known authors, with a fast-growing reputation in the English-speaking world. She has been criticized by Polish conservatives \u2014 and received death threats \u2014 for criticizing aspects of the country's past, including its episodes of anti-Semitism. She is also a strong critic of Poland's right-wing government.\n\nHer novel Flights, which won the Booker International Prize in 2018, combines tales of modern-day travel with the story of a 17th-century anatomist who dissected his own amputated leg and the journey of composer Frederic Chopin's heart from Paris to Warsaw after his death.\n\nPoland's Culture Minister Piotr Glinski, who said earlier this week he has not finished any of Tokarczuk's books, tweeted his congratulations to her and said he now felt obliged to go back and read her books all the way through.\n\nTokarczuk is only the 15th woman to win the literature prize in more than a century. Of the 11 Nobels awarded so far this week, all the other laureates had been men.\n\nTokarczuk is a known critic of Poland's right-wing government. Her novel Flights won the Booker International Prize in 2018. ( Krzysztof Cwik/Agencja Gazeta via Reuters)\n\nIn March, the foundation behind the Nobel Prize in Literature said the Swedish Academy had revamped itself and restored trust. The Nobel Foundation had warned another group could be picked to award the prize if the academy didn't improve its tarnished image.\n\nJean-Claude Arnault, the husband of a former academy member, was convicted last year of two rapes in 2011. Arnault allegedly also leaked the name of Nobel Prize literature winners seven times.\n\nThe 2018 and 2019 literature awards were chosen by the Swedish Academy's Nobel Committee, a new body made up of four academy members and five \"external specialists.\"\n\nNobel organizers say the committee suggests two names that then must be approved by the Swedish Academy. It's unclear whether the academy members simply rubber-stamped the experts' choice.\n\nThe coveted Nobel Peace Prize will be awarded Friday and the economics award winner will be announced on Monday.\n\nCanadian-born prof among this year's laureates\n\nThe chemistry prize went Wednesday to three scientists for their work leading to the development of lithium-ion batteries\n\nJohn B. Goodenough of the University of Texas.\n\nM. Stanley Whittingham of the State University of New York at Binghamton.\n\nAkira Yoshino of Asahi Kasei Corporation and Meijo University in Japan.\n\nOn Tuesday, Canadian-born James Peebles, 84, an emeritus professor at Princeton University in New Jersey, won half of the physics prize for his theoretical discoveries in cosmology. Swiss scientists Michel Mayor, 77, and Didier Queloz, 53, both of the University of Geneva, shared the other half of the prize, for finding an exoplanet \u2014 a planet outside our solar system \u2014 that orbits a solar-type star.\n\nA day earlier, two Americans and one British scientist \u2014 Doctors William G. Kaelin Jr. of Harvard Medical School and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Gregg L. Semenza of Johns Hopkins University and Peter J. Ratcliffe at the Francis Crick Institute in Britain and Oxford University \u2014 won the prize for advances in physiology or medicine. They were cited for their discoveries of \"how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability.\"\n\nEach prize comes with a $918,000 US cash award, a gold medal and a diploma. The laureates receive them at a elegant ceremony on Dec. 10 \u2014 the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896 \u2014 in Stockholm and in Oslo.\n\nIn his will, Swedish industrialist and dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel specifically designated the Swedish Academy as the institution responsible for the Nobel Prize in Literature. Other institutions in Sweden and Norway were given the task to find winners for the other Nobel Prizes.\n\nNobel decided the physics, chemistry and medicine should be awarded in Stockholm, and the peace prize in Oslo. His exact reasons for having an institution in Norway handing out the peace prize is unclear, but during his lifetime, Sweden and Norway were joined in a union, which was dissolved in 1905.", "description": "Austrian author Peter Handke\u00a0was awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Literature, while Polish author Olga Tokarczuk was announced as the 2018 winner after last year's\u00a0literature award was postponed following sex abuse allegations that rocked the Swedish Academy.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5315892.1570706005!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/nobel-prize-literature-2018-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
