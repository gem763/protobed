Ryan called Mayfield \u201coverrated as hell.\u201d\n\nODELL BECKHAM JR. REMOVED CHAIN BEFORE MATCHUP WITH LOS ANGELES RAMS' AQIB TALIB\n\n\u201cI don't get it. I'd love to be an offensive coordinator here,\u201d Ryan said on ESPN\u2019s \u201cGet Up.\u201d \u201cIf I have Odell Beckham, Jarvis Landry, Nick Chubb and there's Baker Mayfield -- yeah, I know he's overrated as hell.\n\nRyan added: \u201cLook, I bought into the dang hype. I'm like, 'Oh, yeah' -- not to the point where everyone's saying he's going to be the league MVP. What's he doing right? Here's a guy right now that's a one-read guy, and then he's going to improvise. He's gotta realize that you are one of the slowest guys on that field when you take off with it. The other thing, the ball's not coming out in rhythm. You're staring down guys, and you're not that accurate down the field.\u201d\n\nMayfield was asked about Ryan\u2019s comments during a press conference on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s whatever,\u201d Mayfield said. \u201cIn the wise words of Freddie Kitchens, if you don't wear orange and brown, you don't matter, and Rex Ryan doesn't have any colors right now for a reason.

The Browns\u2019 lone win came against the undermanned New York Jets.\n\nIn those three games, Mayfield has 805 passing yards, three touchdowns, five interceptions and a 56.9 completion percentage.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Browns will attempt to right the ship against the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday.", "description": "Cleveland Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield fired back at former NFL head coach-turned-ESPN analyst Rex Ryan on Wednesday after he called the second-year player \u201coverrated\u201d during a broadcast.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is A Sports Reporter For Foxnews.Com", "Foxbusiness.Com.
