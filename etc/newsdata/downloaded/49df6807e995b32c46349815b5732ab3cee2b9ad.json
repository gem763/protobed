(Joel Bernstein)\n\n\u201cSongs, they have to be recorded or they drive you crazy just being inside your head.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Graham Nash, summer 2019\n\nStephen Stills had the gift, the ability to reel off the entire side of a record without putting down his acoustic guitar. David Crosby was the teddy bear with a bad boy wink, an angelic tenor with a flair for going AWOL. Then there was Graham Nash, the lone Brit and Crosby, Stills and Nash\u2019s secret weapon. Whether writing early hits such as \u201cTeach Your Children\u201d or later top-10 hits, including \u201cJust a Song Before I Go\u201d and \u201cWasted on the Way,\u201d Nash held the fragile trio together.\n\nBut in the summer of 1970, Nash, then 28, decided to focus on himself for a change. He went into Wally Heider\u2019s studio in San Francisco to record his solo debut, \u201cSongs for Beginners.\u201d The album featured guests spots by Crosby, Neil Young, Jerry Garcia and Rita Coolidge, but its magic was in the spare arrangements and subject matter, from soul-baring ballads to fiery protest songs. For Nash, \u201cSongs for Beginners\u201d wasn\u2019t a choice. The Vietnam War was on and his intense relationship with Joni Mitchell was off. When the songs are coming, they have to be recorded.\n\nNow, nearly 50 years later, Nash will be performing for the first time the entirety of \u201cSongs for Beginners\u201d and his 1974 follow-up, \u201cWild Tales,\u201d in a special run of shows in South Orange, N.J., Manhattan, Albany, N.Y., and Boston. We spoke to the 77-year-old musician recently about what drove him to create his debut by focusing on some of the album highlights.\n\n'Wounded Bird'\n\n\u201cWe talked to each other through songs. \u2018Cowboy Movie\u2019 by Crosby [is] really his version of the breakup of CSNY in one of its earlier forms. I wrote \u2018Wounded Bird\u2019 for Stephen and Judy [Collins] about the pains he was going through in that relationship, just as Neil writing \u2018Only Love Can Break Your Heart\u2019 was for me because of what was going on with Joni. Sometimes it\u2019s easier to get your thoughts across in music, especially with this band.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt a June 1970 Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young concert at the Fillmore East in New York, Nash played \u201cSimple Man\u201d live for the first time, with Joni Mitchell in the audience. (Joel Bernstein)\n\n'Simple Man'\n\n\u201cGermaine Greer, who is one of the forerunners of the Me Too movement, thought there is an astoundingly profound line: \u2018I just want to hold you, I don\u2019t want to hold you down.\u2019 \u201d This photo shows Nash in June 1970 at the Fillmore East as Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young played a five-night run. He performed \u201cSimple Man\u201d live for the first time, with Mitchell in the audience. When Nash looks at the photo, he says, \u201cI see somebody having written a brand-new song about the end of the relationship having to sing it with the object of that relationship sitting in the third row. Which I didn\u2019t expect. I didn\u2019t know until I was standing onstage about to do the song.\u201d\n\n'Better Days'\n\n\u201cI met Rita during the recording of \u2018Love the One You\u2019re With,\u2019 Stephen\u2019s great song. Rita and I made a date to go to a swap meet, and Stephen called her and said I was sick and couldn\u2019t go and that she should go with him. And so she spent a couple of weeks with Stephen. But Rita and I were very attracted to each other. Being somewhat of an Englishman and a gentleman, I couldn\u2019t even kiss Rita without letting Stephen know we wanted to be together. And so I picked up Rita one morning and drove to Stephen\u2019s house in Laurel Canyon. I said that Rita and I wanted to spend time together and I wanted to let him know before anything sexually happened between Rita and I. He didn\u2019t take it well. As a matter of fact, he tried to spit on me and missed. Obviously, it was a very awkward moment and became an argument between Stephen and I for several years.\u201d\n\n'Military Madness'\n\nThe album opener tells the true story of Nash\u2019s birth in 1942 in Blackpool, England, during an evacuation, with his father away at war. \u201cWhen I wrote that there was only really one war \u2014 World War II. But now there\u2019s, what, 14 wars as we speak. There\u2019s Yemen, Syria. I was thinking about Vietnam and what I\u2019d gone through. You\u2019ve got to really understand. When you nearly have your entire country bombed out of existence twice within 80 years from the same enemy and you overcome that and you are alive after World War II, you have an attitude of, you know what, if we can face that, we can f----ing face anything. And don\u2019t give me a problem about your coffee being too cold.\u201d\n\n\n\nJoni Mitchell and Graham Nash backstage at the Fillmore East in April 1969. (Joel Bernstein)\n\n'I Used to Be a King'\n\nNash says that for this song, he was playing off \u201cKing Midas in Reverse,\u201d a song he wrote with the Hollies. He and Mitchell were breaking up, and she sent him a telegram from Greece. \u201cIt said, quite frankly, \u2018If you hold sand too tightly in your fist, it will run through your fingers.\u2019 That was Joni\u2019s way of telling me that whatever love affair we had together was over. . . . I loved being with Joan. I thought that Joni and I had the ability to light up a room. But I had just come out from a marriage that really soured me on marriage. . . . As a matter of fact, in her song \u2018Willy,\u2019 you can date [the breakup]. Because she says in one of the lines, \u2018At the face of the conquered moon.\u2019 And it was only the week before that the moon had been conquered by setting foot on the moon.\u201d\n\n'Chicago'\n\nThis song was inspired by the anti-Vietnam protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago and the trial of the Chicago Eight, who were arrested for their roles in the events. The song opens with a reference to Bobby Seale, who was gagged and chained in the courtroom. \u201cWhen you\u2019re being accused of what he was being accused of, no wonder he shouted. Maybe he was screaming, maybe he was out of it, but this was not a fair trial.\u201d In the chorus, Nash sings: \u201cWe can change the world/ rearrange the world.\u201d \u201cI thought we could change the world. And it\u2019s the same today. I think musicians can change the world. Now then, the momentum of this planet is so huge that to move it a millimeter takes years of energy sometimes and I realize that now. But then we thought, \u2018Hey, we can help stop the Vietnam War. We can entice all the people to write to their congressmen and their senators and their president. We can do this, we can change the world.\u2019 And I still believe it, too.\u201d\n\nOn Joel Bernstein, the photographer and Nash's friend\n\n\u201cJoel Bernstein has a brilliant mind, a magnificent memory, and is an archivist, but most of all, he\u2019s a brilliant photographer. He\u2019s one of those people like Jim Marshall and Gered Mankowitz and myself who like to be invisible and only take one click of the Leica and hope that it\u2019s not loud enough to disturb anybody. He doesn\u2019t want his personality to be in the photograph at all. I met him on February the 1st of 1969, which was Joni\u2019s first time playing Carnegie Hall, and we\u2019ve been best friends ever since.\u201d", "description": "\u201cSongs, they have to be recorded or they drive you crazy just being inside your head.\u201d", "authors": ["Geoff Edgers", "Reporter Covering Movies", "Museums", "Comedy", "Music", "Pop Culture", "September At Pm", "The Washington Post'S National Arts Reporter", "Covers Everything Fine Arts To Popular Culture.
