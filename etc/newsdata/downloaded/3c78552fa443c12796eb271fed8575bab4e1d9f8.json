The video with the ambassador was recorded Friday night, he said, and published Monday only after things were finalized.\n\nBukele said that it would directly benefit not only the 200,000 Salvadorans covered under TPS but some 200,000 children born to them who are U.S. citizens and faced the prospect of having their parents sent home, plus hundreds of thousands more in El Salvador who rely on money they send back home.\n\n\"I think (the U.S. decision) is a recognition also of the fact that these 200,000 TPSers are honest, hard-working people who pay their taxes, who have nearly 20 years of legal status living in the United States, who have 200,000 children who are U.S. citizens,\" Bukele said, \"and obviously taking away their protection and deporting them just like that, I think it would not have been fair.\"\n\nHe added that the goal remains getting permanent residence for TPS recipients, but the U.S. congress would have to pass legislation for that \u2014 otherwise it's up to the executive branch to consider renewals periodically.\n\nJos\u00e9 Palma, national coordinator for the TPS National Alliance, a group of TPS beneficiaries from across the U.S., told reporters that the lack of details on the extension could mean trouble for beneficiaries being able to keep their jobs.", "description": "The United States government said Monday it is extending protections for more than 200,000 citizens of El Salvador who have been living in the country under temporary protected status, in a boost for Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele.
