That meant the city\u2019s economic growth had contracted for two consecutive quarters.\n\nThe year-on-year decline in exports and imports widened further from August when they were down 6.3 per cent and 11.1 per cent respectively.\n\nHong Kong has already slipped into a recession.

Most major markets continued to show subdued performance,\u201d a government spokesman said.\n\n\u201cAs the strains on global trade flows arising from a slowing global economy and various uncertainties, including the development of US-mainland trade relations, will likely persist for some time, the near-term outlook for Hong Kong\u2019s merchandise exports remains challenging.\u201d\n\nIn the third quarter, the city\u2019s exports declined 0.4 per cent from the preceding quarter. The drop was 4.6 per cent in the first nine months of this year compared with the same period in 2018.\n\nChina and the United States are in the middle of drafting a deal after making \u201cconcrete progress\u201d in many areas during their latest round of talks to resolve the trade war earlier this month, according to Beijing\u2019s lead negotiator, Vice-Premier Liu He, and US President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump said earlier that he and his Chinese counterpart, President Xi Jinping, might ratify the deal during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders\u2019 meeting in Chile in mid-November.\n\nThis article Hong Kong exports shrink 7.3 per cent in September as US-China trade war continues to bite first appeared on South China Morning Post\n\nFor the latest news from the South China Morning Post download our mobile app. Copyright 2019.", "description": "Hong Kong exports shrank 7.3 per cent in September year on year amid the raging US-China trade war, ending the third quarter on a sour note.Exports dropped to HK$347.7 billion (US$44.2 billion) in September while imports slipped 10.3 per cent to HK$379.3 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of HK$31.6", "authors": ["Denise Tsang"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8jHdW.LuHpfMArzefa8a6A--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/south_china_morning_post_621/f499e76a095a558f417fe503c54d137f", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
