The Central Americans showing up these days on the southern border say they are also escaping poverty and violence, now inflicted mostly by street gangs called maras, which have transformed their countries into some of the most dangerous in the world.\n\nRestored by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Gregory Nava\u2019s \u201cEl Norte\u201d will be play on Sept. 15 at some 200 movie theaters nationwide. Showings will feature an introduction by Nava, whose other films include the hit \u201cSelena\u201d and \u201cMy Family.\u201d\n\nTickets are available through cinema distributor Fathom Events and participating movie theaters. The anniversary showing will be followed with the release of the restored version of the movie on digital formats by Lionsgate .\n\n\u201cI made \u2018El Norte\u2018 in large part because we needed a message of compassion and humanity\u201d about immigrants, said Nava, who directed the 1984 film from a screenplay co-written with Anna Thomas. The pair was nominated for the best screenplay Oscar.\n\n\u201cIt made the difference in helping legalize millions of people,\u201d said Nava. \u201cWe need that message again.\u201d\n\nTwo years after \u201cEl Norte\u201d was released, the Immigration Reform and Control Act was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan, legalizing most immigrants who arrived in the country before Jan. 1, 1982 without permission.\n\nMany of the several million people subsequently legalized were Mexicans. But migrants continued to flow into the U.S. from Mexico as well as Guatemala, where through most of the 1980s the U.S. supplied military training and materials to that country\u2019s army for a brutal counterinsurgency campaign.\n\nNava, 70, learned about the struggles of immigration growing up in San Diego in a family wounded by the early 1930s deportation of his Mexican American grandfather, one of many U.S. citizens and legal residents kicked out of the county during an anti-immigrant campaign by the administration of President Herbert Hoover. Nava\u2019s grandmother was left alone in California to raise seven children, including the filmmaker\u2019s father.\n\n\u201cMy family was ripped apart because of this, something we left hidden in a closet of shame,\u201d said Nava, who now lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\nNava said much of the film was made in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas because the civil war made working in Guatemala too dangerous. More than 200,000 people were killed or forcibly disappeared, many of them ethnic Mayans, during 36 years of hostilities that ended with 1996 peace accords between the government and leftist rebels.\n\n\u201cEl Norte\u201d tells the story of siblings Rosa and Enrique Xuncax, who flee Guatemala after the army slaughters or takes away almost everyone in their small rural community.\n\nThe siblings played by Mexican actors Zaide Silvia Guti\u00e9rrez and David Villalpando launch their dangerous trek through Mexico after Enrique gets advice from a family friend on how to convince \u201cla migra,\u201d or U.S. immigration authorities, he\u2019s a Mexican if he\u2019s detained.\n\nCurse like crazy, the friend says, and the agents will believe you are a Mexican and send you back over the border to Tijuana, Mexico rather than all the way to Guatemala.\n\nWhen they get to Tijuana, the siblings face a whole new set of challenges, including a terrifying journey crawling under the border through an old sewage tunnel into San Diego.\n\nIn another notable scene after they get to Los Angeles, Rosa becomes overwhelmed by the dizzying array of options on a modern washing machine. Nacha, a factory worker and maid played by the now-late Mexican American actress Lupe Ontiveros, befriends young Rosa as she adjusts to her new life.\n\nKathleen Staudt, the film review editor for the academic journal Borders in Globalization Review, said \u201cEl Norte\u201d was among the first movies to provide a human look at the risks migrants take during their journeys and in their work in the United States.\n\n\u201cThe film still resonates for viewers because the exodus from dangerous Central America countries continues,\u201d said Staudt, who screened \u201cEl Norte\u201d for multiple classes over several decades teaching at the University of Texas at El Paso.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very powerful movie,\u201d agreed Irasema Coronado, director of the School for Transborder Studies at Arizona State University in Tempe, a Phoenix suburb.\n\n\u201cWhen it was made in the 1980s, people were protesting the situation in Central America and the sanctuary movement was very vibrant in the U.S,\u201d said Coronado. \u201cI think it crystalized for many why people were leaving their villages and community for the United States.\n\n\u201cAnd today, people are still leaving. Things have not changed.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Anita Snow on Twitter: https://twitter.com/asnowreports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "\"El Norte,\" the seminal film about a brother and sister who flee violence in Guatemala to seek a new life in the United States, is returning to the big screen for one day this month to commemorate its 35th anniversary.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Anita Snow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/el_norte-anniversary_screening_48295_c0-51-1920-1170_s1770x1032.jpg?8bc9eafc3123d704b9915845d05b1df1d1369dc0", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
