Westerhout made comments about President Trump's relationships with his daughters, Ivanka and Tiffany, saying she had a better relationship with him than they did and that Trump avoiding pictures with Tiffany because he perceives her to be overweight, POLITICO reported.\n\nThe comments were reportedly made during an off-the-record event with White House press secretary Hogan Gidley. The two held a press conference for reporters covering Trump\u2019s vacation at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nAccording to a person at the event, Westerhout made the remarks after drinking too much.\n\n\u201cShe had a couple drinks and in an uncharacteristically unguarded moment, she opened up to the reporters,\u201d the person told POLITICO.\n\nPresident Trump took to Twitter on Saturday morning, saying Westerhout apologized and he accepts.\n\nWhile Madeleine Westerhout has a fully enforceable confidentiality agreement, she is a very good person and I don\u2019t think there would ever be reason to use it. She called me yesterday to apologize, had a bad night. I fully understood and forgave her! I love Tiffany, doing great! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 31, 2019\n\nAlthough Trump said he forgave Westerhout, he is currently suing various people who were part of his administration to keep their non-disclosure agreements intact.\n\n...Yes, I am currently suing various people for violating their confidentiality agreements. Disgusting and foul mouthed Omarosa is one. I gave her every break, despite the fact that she was despised by everyone, and she went for some cheap money from a book. Numerous others also! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 31, 2019\n\nTrump's tweet refutes the New York Times' report, saying Westerhout did not sign a non-disclosure agreement.", "description": "Uh oh..09/02/2019 3:11:30AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/238/09d61344-5075-4a64-b355-bf610063ab0c.png"}
