Treasuries slipped and the dollar gained.\n\nThe S&P 500 Index headed lower in the afternoon after veering between small gains and small losses for most of the day in light volume. Sentiment got a boost on speculation that China is ready to do a deal, while pessimists focused on a report that senior Chinese officials have indicated the range of topics they\u2019re willing to discuss at upcoming talks has narrowed considerably.\n\nThe index climbed as foodmaker and telecom companies advanced.

They\u2019ll search for new clues on the policy path when minutes from the latest Fed meeting are released in coming days.\n\n\u201cGiven the high level of uncertainty that\u2019s out there and the cross-currents -- the cross-currents being escalating geopolitical risks on the one hand and increased monetary easing on the part of the world\u2019s global central banks -- it\u2019s really difficult at this point to determine which force is going to gain the upper hand,\u201d said Ed Campbell, a portfolio manager and managing director at QMA.\n\nJapanese equities closed little changed, while Shanghai markets are yet to re-open after holidays. Hong Kong was also shuttered for a holiday, leaving traders with limited options to respond -- or not -- to escalating violence in the city, where protesters set fires and vandalized train stations and banks over the weekend. The yuan dropped in offshore trading by the most since late September.\n\nElsewhere, West Texas-grade oil steadied following its biggest weekly decline since July.\n\nHere are some key events coming up this week:\n\nChinese Vice Premier Liu He visits Washington for trade talks with his U.S. counterparts.\n\nFed Chair Jerome Powell speaks Tuesday on the final day of NABE\u2019s annual conference in Denver; on the following day, minutes are released on the last policy meeting of the Fed\u2019s rate-setting committee.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reportedly will meet at an unofficial summit.\n\nThe U.S. releases a key measure of inflation on Thursday.\n\nHere are the main moves in markets:\n\nThe slipped 0.4% as of 2:53 p.m. New York time.\n\nThe Index climbed 0.7%.\n\nJapan\u2019s index was little changed.", "description": "U.S. Equities Slump as China Trade Meeting Looms", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pice07609fa2eb81d97115615d5221010dd.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
