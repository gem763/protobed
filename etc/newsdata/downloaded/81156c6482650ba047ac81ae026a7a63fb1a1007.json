But for those planning to travel, the time to start searching for airfare is now \u2014 as in today \u2014 according to experts. That applies for Thanksgiving as well.\n\n\u201cIt may seem really early to start thinking about your holiday plans,\u201d says Jeanette Casselano, a spokeswoman for AAA. \u201cBut if you\u2019re going to be flying, Sept. 25 through the end of October is going to be the best time to start looking and buying those flights, because you\u2019re going to find some of the best options and best deals.\u201d\n\nShe said the months-early approach means there\u2019s still a lot of supply, or flight options and seats, available.\n\nTo be sure, the prices of flights will remain in flux as Thanksgiving and the winter holidays get closer. And there could even be some last-minute deals for those who wait until a week or two before their departure dates. But, experts say, those travelers will probably need to be willing to go at inconvenient times or under less-than-ideal circumstances.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to wait, be sure to be very, very flexible with both dates and time of day and layovers if you want to get a good deal,\u201d says Hayley Berg, an economist at the airfare prediction app Hopper.\n\nShe said Thanksgiving airline prices typically start out high, so those don\u2019t need to be booked quite as far in advance as Christmas flights. But for Christmas, prices tend to start lower and vary more, \u201cso if you can get the flights at the sweet spot, you\u2019re going to pay a lot less,\u201d she said in an email.\n\nThe company had some good news for the budget-conscious: Round-trip domestic airfare was expected to be down 3.9 percent for around Thanksgiving and 9.2 percent for Christmas.\n\n[Don\u2019t make these common holiday travel mistakes]\n\nVarious travel groups and companies have slightly different recommendations for the best time for holiday booking. AAA, for example, recommends that people start shopping now. Hopper suggests booking tickets in October for Thanksgiving and before Oct. 31 for Christmas. Booking site Skyscanner says Sunday is a great time to find deals for Thanksgiving.\n\nMost seem to agree, however, that there\u2019s no real downside to keeping an early eye out.\n\n\n\n(Washington Post illustration; iStock)\n\n\u201cOur best piece of advice is to start looking early \u2014 and snag a good deal the second you see one,\u201d Tracy Stewart, content editor at airfare deal site Airfarewatchdog, said in an email.\n\nStewart says consumers should sign up for multiple airfare alerts to get a heads-up when prices drop on specific routes. People hunting for a deal should also check alternative airports, settle for a middle seat, catch an early flight or fly on the holiday dates themselves.\n\nCasselano, of AAA, says that the Monday before Thanksgiving has the lowest average flight price, and that Thanksgiving Day has good deals. For Christmas Day, which falls on a Wednesday this year, it\u2019s best to avoid the weekend before the holiday.\n\n\u201cThat Sunday, we\u2019ve found prices to be very expensive,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re flexible and can travel on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day morning, you\u2019re going to probably find better deals.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nThe completely correct guide to getting off a plane\n\nCelebrities have a thing for sanitizing airplane seats.
