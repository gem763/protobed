The official opening is scheduled for the end of the first quarter next year, he said.\n\nTymeBank, controlled by Motsepe\u2019s investment vehicle African Rainbow Capital, joins at least two other companies seeking to challenge the country\u2019s top five lenders through digital business models. Discovery, the nation\u2019s largest health-insurance administrator, has said it plans to introduce its banking unit to the public next week.\n\nTyme\u2019s account does not charge a basic monthly fee. Instead clients pay for specific services as they use them, with the most expensive transaction in its fee structure, cash withdrawals at ATMs of other banks, costing R8.\n\n\"People normally don\u2019t understand bank charges, but this is simple to understand. There are no hidden fees,\" Shabalala said. \"What we are driving to the market is transparency.\" The bank isn\u2019t targeting a specific segment of the market, he said.\n\nClients will be able to download Tyme\u2019s mobile app for free at any of its 730 self-service kiosks, located in outlets of retailer Pick 'n Pay. The bank also pays for data costs related to the app, Shabalala said.\n\n\"The next step in the journey, obviously, is to get into the lending space and we want to take our time around that,\" Shabalala said. \"We don\u2019t have existing customers and first want to understand the profiles of the customers we want to lend to\" by offering them transactional accounts, he said.\n\nWhile the Prudential Authority of the South African Reserve Bank, which oversees the industry, may not have traditionally allowed a bank to operate solely online, it has permitted Tyme to move ahead with its plans, Shabalala said.\n\n\"Traditionally they would not even have considered for a bank to put its core banking platform on the cloud, that was a definite no-no,\" he said. \"But we are the first bank to be able to do it in South Africa.\"\n\n* Sign up to Fin24's top news in your inbox: SUBSCRIBE TO FIN24 NEWSLETTER", "description": "TymeBank, owned by billionaire Patrice Motsepe, has started signing up customers for its new online bank, one of several entrants planning to take clients from traditional lenders.", "authors": ["Roxanne Henderson"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4891/f3fd518554f648a0b2d1d39d2d5bdade.jpg", "published_at": "2018-11-09"}
