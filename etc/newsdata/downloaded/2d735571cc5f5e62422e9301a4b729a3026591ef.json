Climate Action Summit due to start on Sept. 23, with environmental groups hoping it will deliver more ambitious pledges to tackle global temperature rises.\n\nHowever, in a notice published on Tuesday, the country\u2019s Ministry of Ecology and Environment stopped short of making any fresh pledges to curb carbon dioxide emissions, promising to support the \u201cmultinational climate process\u201d and fulfil its pledges to the Paris Agreement in full.\n\nChina had previously concentrated on reducing emissions from its heavy industrial sectors, while maintaining high levels of economic growth, but the approach has been subject to diminishing returns.\n\nIt now plans to \u201cproactively promote\u201d nature-based solutions such as reforestation and the expansion of grasslands and wetlands. Total forest reserves in the country rose by 4.56 billion cubic metres between 2005 and 2018, and forests now account for just under 23% of total land.\n\nBeijing will also call on other countries at the U.N. meeting to \u201cfully consider the potential of the natural system to alleviate climate change and promote adaptation, while formulating climate change-related policies\u201d.\n\nBeijing also aims to expand carbon sinks capable of absorbing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, work to cap fertiliser use, raise waste utilisation rates at livestock farms and speed-up the usage of biomass energy, the report said.\n\nThe southwestern Chinese city of Kunming is set to host a major U.N. meeting next year to reach a new global post-2020 agreement to protect biodiversity, and the environment ministry wants to include \u201cnature-based solutions\u201d in any new deal.\n\nChina has been keen to connect the protection of natural ecosystems with the wider issues of climate change, said Li Shuo, a senior climate adviser with environmental group Greenpeace.\n\nCristiana Pasca-Palmer, executive secretary of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, told Reuters that unlocking financial support would be a major component of the new agreement, adding that \u201csignals are good\u201d for a strong deal to be finalised, with China set to play a leading role.", "description": "China said it will try to persuade other countries to support \"nature-based solutions\" to tackle the root causes of climate change, the country said in a position paper published ahead of a United Nations summit in New York.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
