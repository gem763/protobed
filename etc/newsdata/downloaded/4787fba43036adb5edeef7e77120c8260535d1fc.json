This is because globally, the focus will likely be on the U.S. Fed's FOMC meeting,\" analysts at Nedbank said in a note.\n\n\"Technically, support remains between 14.59 and 15.50. A break below 14.59 would test the trendline at 14.40, confirming a short-term reversal for a move to 13.84\"\n\nBonds were also firmer, with the yield on the benchmark paper due in 2026 ZAR186= down 0.5 basis points to 8.17%.", "description": "South Africa's rand firms as Fed rate cut bets offset budget fears", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/south_african_rand_800x533_L_1411971483.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
