She had endured back pain and abdominal pain (on her left side) for many months. My daughter is being treated with injections to encourage the menopause. The pain can be severe and is recurring. Can you advise?\n\nJean Sewell, Portavogie, Co. Down.\n\nBenefit of GnRH injections is that women will rapidly become pain-free as the endometrial tissue is reduced\n\nThe good news is that your daughter is very likely to soon be relieved of her pain completely. At the age of 48, the natural menopause is not far away, and in her case this is being hastened medically.\n\nWhether this happens naturally or is induced, the key point is that endometriosis resolves once oestrogen levels decline.\n\nFor the benefit of other readers, let me explain what's going on with this common condition. It affects between 10 and 30 per cent of women of reproductive age being checked for pelvic pain - usually after a laparoscopy, where the inside of the abdomen is examined using a tiny camera.\n\nIt is caused when endometrial tissue - the tissue that normally lines the womb - grows outside the womb, for instance, in the bladder, the ovaries and the other structures within the pelvic area, including the rectum.\n\nAs with the womb lining itself, this tissue breaks down and bleeds every month, But because there is no route for the blood to leave the body, it can trigger inflammation, which causes pain. The condition can also lead to problems with fertility.\n\nDrugs are used to suppress the ovaries' production of oestrogen and are effective in reducing pelvic pain\n\nThe tissue breakdown occurs as a result of the normal hormonal changes of the menstrual cycle. This is why the condition disappears in postmenopausal women, as long as they are not taking oestrogen (which stimulates the endometrium) by way of HRT.\n\nWhat triggers it is still unclear. One suggestion is that at some stage when the womb lining was shed during menstruation, some cells passed back through the fallopian tubes (this is known as retrograde menstruation) and then became implanted on pelvic structures.\n\nTreatment is aimed at eradicating all endometrial cells outside the womb. If the woman is still hoping for a pregnancy, at some stage treatment will involve careful attempts to remove all of the endometrial tissue at the abnormal sites - such as by using a laser as a keyhole procedure. For older patients such as your daughter, reducing oestrogen levels by hastening the menopause will cure the problem.\n\nIt is likely that she will be treated with a GnRH agonist - these drugs are widely used to suppress the ovaries' production of oestrogen and are highly effective in reducing pelvic pain.\n\nOne such drug is goserelin, given every few weeks by injection. There will be side-effects, such as hot flushes and accelerated bone loss, due to the onset of the menopause - though the latter can be kept at bay by the addition of calcium and vitamin D or even a weekly bisphosphonate tablet.\n\nHowever, the benefit of the GnRH injections is that your daughter will rapidly become pain-free as the endometrial tissue is reduced.\n\nI can't walk far without getting distressed - breathless with a heavy feeling all over my body. If I walk up a slight slope or steps, I can feel faint and sometimes nauseous. I do walk up stairs at home, mostly without feeling too distressed. In 2013, a heart specialist did a stress test and ECG - he said I performed well for my age and it must be a lung problem. Later, it was thought I might have asthma and I was given a puffer. I'm not convinced it's asthma. I am 80.\n\nJean Kilbey, by email.\n\nThe problem here is one of diagnosis. I simply do not believe your intolerance of exertion above a small limit can be put down to your age. There must be a cause and it is vital this is identified before you can take steps to put it right.\n\nAs you have explained, minimal exertion - the stairs at home, for example - is not enough to trigger the problem. I note that you are not suffering from breathlessness when at rest, such as when in bed at night.\n\nIn my opinion, the origins of the symptom must lie with your heart or lungs. Though a heart problem has already been considered and excluded, that was three years ago.\n\nYou tell me that you performed well on the exercise ECG (electro cardiogram). This measures the rhythm and electrical activity of the heart while you walk on a treadmill and may be performed when symptoms are triggered by physical activity.\n\nHowever, we know this test can be misleading and can produce false positive or false negative results. It may be that if you were to take the test again, the cause would reveal itself.\n\nIf your problem is down to a shortage of blood supply to the heart muscle, for example, this may not necessarily result in pain - known as angina - but as shortage of breath or weakness, because the heart isn't pumping efficiently. These symptoms are similar to those you describe.\n\nThe same symptoms can occur if your heart doesn't contract fully - which is when it pushes the blood around the body.\n\nThis is called 'heart failure', and may be apparent only with physical exertion.\n\nAnother thought is that it may be a heart rhythm disorder - when you are walking, with your heart working that bit harder, the rhythm becomes temporarily irregular, which can also lead to a drop in the amount of blood pumped out, causing the sort of symptoms that trouble you.\n\nAll of these possibilities should be investigated further.\n\nSome cardiologists might suggest an echocardiogram, an ultrasound scan of the heart, or an enhancement of that test, a stress echocardiogram, where the heart rate is increased with exercise or medication. This should be the next step.\n\nJean can't walk far without getting distressed - breathless with a heavy feeling all over her body (file photo)\n\nYour lungs have been thought about as a cause of the symptoms.\n\nSome people do become breathless on exertion because the physical stress triggers a form of asthma - but the puffer you were given didn't ease the symptom, which leads me to think a lung problem is a less likely cause.\n\nIn summary, I suggest that what is needed is a reassessment by a heart specialist. That should allow your doctors to think about the most appropriate treatment to bring you some relief.\n\nBy the way ... Overweight medics set a bad example\n\nDo as I say, not as I do. A dictum that was probably never so true about many of my medical colleagues.\n\nI was reminded of this recently when speaking at a literary festival about the evolution of medical practice during my career. I was on the stage with my son, Cosmo, an anaesthetist and Fellow of the Royal College of Anaesthetists. He is also a member of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine (he trained as an A&E doctor before moving into anaesthetics).\n\nCosmo and I reflected on how in recent years ambulance drivers have increased their professionalism in leaps and bounds, and are now trained as paramedics.\n\nWrite to Dr Scurr To contact Dr Scurr with a health query, write to him at Good Health Daily Mail, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TT or email drmartin@dailymail.co.uk - including contact details. Dr Scurr cannot enter into personal correspondence. His replies cannot apply to individual cases and should be taken in a general context. Always consult your own GP with any health worries.\n\nCosmo was at pains to explain to the audience that in the event of an accident, or many other health emergencies, he believes it would be far better to be treated by a paramedic rather than any doctor who just happens to be around.\n\nThe reason is that paramedics are the experts at crisis management in those situations, fully equipped and trained to cope with problems with the airways, major bleeding, serious multiple injuries and collapse from any cause, for this is their everyday task and they practise their skills constantly.\n\nTo my surprise, this week, on two occasions I have come across paramedics puffing away on cigarettes as they leant against their emergency vehicles.\n\nIt reminded me of an inspection of my general practice by the Care Quality Commission, a detailed probing to ensure all aspects of our work pass acceptable standards.\n\nBoth CQC inspectors were so obese that they were unable to sit in the two armchairs provided for my patients - they had to lean against the examination couch and I had constant misgivings about whether it could cope with a 50 st load.\n\nI was reminded, too, about a friend, now a dietician, who was taught at university by an academic nutritionist who was morbidly obese. The teacher was apparently oblivious to the irony of this.\n\nShould we insist that those engaged in healthcare set a good example?", "description": "Endometriosis has reared its ugly head in a family - now Jean's daughter, aged 48, has been diagnosed with it after a laparoscopy.
