Their governors will formulate programs specifying the quantity of vaccines and areas to be checked by the farm ministry before giving final approval.\n\nThe disease, also known as swine fever, only affects pigs and wild boars and has a high fatality rate. It does not affect humans, even if meat from an infected animal is consumed.\n\nThe experts at the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry also decided to boost inspections for African swine fever, which is spreading in Asia, allowing testing at the prefectural level.\n\nSo far, testing for the disease has only been conducted at state facilities.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "Vaccination of pigs in areas of Japan with confirmed cases of hog cholera could commence later this month after a panel of experts approved revised vaccination guidelines, a step necessary for inoculation.
