While all three phones introduce noteworthy updates when it comes to camera quality and performance \u2013 particularly for those upgrading from older models like the iPhone 6S or iPhone 7 \u2013 it\u2019s next year\u2019s iPhone that will signal a more significant change for Apple\u2019s mobile devices.\n\nThat\u2019s because Apple\u2019s 2020 flagship is expected to include technologies and features that will be about much more than just taking better photos in the dark or enhancing performance. If the current reports and rumors are to be believed, the next-generation iPhone will be more about setting the stage for what\u2019s to come for Apple\u2019s smartphones \u2013 and perhaps the industry at large \u2013 rather than new features that are immediately useful.\n\nAmong the biggest changes that\u2019s expected to come with Apple\u2019s 2020 iPhones is the introduction of a more sophisticated three-dimensional camera, according to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman and Debby Wu. Such a camera system would include a laser scanner to create 3D replicas of the real world, boosting the iPhone\u2019s augmented-reality capabilities. With the new 3D camera, the iPhone would be better at placing virtual objects in augmented reality and would offer enhanced depth perception, according to Bloomberg.\n\nRead more: All the new products Apple is expected to launch by the end of the year\n\nApple\u2019s iPhones have supported augmented-reality applications for years, and the company made its first big push into AR when it launched ARKit in 2016 \u2013 a set of tools to help mobile developers build high-quality AR apps.\n\nBut despite the advancements that Apple has implemented in recent years \u2013 such as advanced people occlusion in ARKit 3 to better account for the people and objects around you \u2013 the iPhone\u2019s augmented-reality performance will always be at least somewhat dictated by the hardware it runs on. As such, the iPhone could get a major performance boost when it comes to AR if Apple does indeed give it an upgraded 3D camera system.\n\nsource Crystal Cox/Business Insider\n\nLaying the foundation\n\nYou may be wondering why such an improvement would be a big deal for the next iPhone, especially considering the technology is still nascent. The answer is less about immediate practicality and more about what it could mean for Apple\u2019s product lineup in the future.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook has repeatedly voiced his interest in augmented reality, saying he views it as being more important in the long term than virtual reality. On the company\u2019s first-quarter earnings call in 2018, Cook said he sees AR as being \u201cprofound,\u201d adding that it has the potential to \u201camplify human performance\u201d rather than isolating people. He made similar remarks the prior year on an earnings call, saying that it could \u201cchange the way we use technology forever.\u201d\n\nRegardless of whether the rumors and reports about the next iPhone end up being true, it\u2019s clear that Apple views augmented reality as being a critical emerging technology. And if AR does become an increasingly important part of the iPhone in 2020, Apple\u2019s next smartphone could also help lay the foundation for what may be Apple\u2019s next big hardware product \u2013 an augmented-reality headset.\n\nApple could even release augmented-reality-headset accessories for the iPhone in the second quarter of next year, according to a recent report from TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo which 9to5Mac obtained. Kuo\u2019s report indicates that Apple could work with third-party companies on such accessories, while an earlier report from Bloomberg in 2017 shared details on Apple\u2019s plans for a standalone AR headset with its own screen, chip, and operating system. That device could launch sometime in 2020, the report said.\n\nBuilding more advanced augmented reality into the iPhone \u2013 a device that millions of people all over the world are already using \u2013 could help Apple drum up anticipation for a dedicated AR device.\n\nAugmented reality aside, Apple\u2019s 2020 iPhone is expected to come with another update that\u2019s critical to the iPhone\u2019s future: 5G support. While 5G compatibility isn\u2019t a must-have feature for today\u2019s smartphones considering it can only be found in a handful of cities in the US, it\u2019s only going to become more important over the next two to three years.\n\nOf course it\u2019s impossible to know exactly what Apple has planned for its next iPhone \u2013 or any other future products \u2013 until it publicly debuts them. But if Apple is betting on AR as being its next major computing platform, there\u2019s a chance the next iPhone may give us a preview of what that experience will be like.", "description": "Business Insider - Apple's new iPhone 11 and 11 Pro bring meaningful improvements, but next year's iPhone will set the stage for what's to come..
