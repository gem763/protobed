Republicans said his background in labor and employment law made him qualified for the post. Democrats said Scalia fought for corporations and against workers and was the wrong candidate for the Cabinet post.\n\nSen. Lamar Alexander, chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, said he received more than 30 letters of support for Scalia from small-business owners, workers, former career lawyers at the Labor Department, where Scalia once worked, and more.\n\n\u201cIt is important for the Department of Labor to create an environment to help employers and employees succeed in today\u2019s rapidly changing workplace,\u201d said Alexander, R-Tenn.\n\nScalia spent the bulk of his career as a partner in the Washington office of the Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher firm, where he rang up a string of victories in court cases on behalf of business interests challenging labor and financial regulations. He also served for a year as the Labor Department\u2019s top lawyer during the George W. Bush administration.\n\n\u201cThe president has sent us a corporate lawyer who\u2019s fought over and over to stop workplace protections, to undermine worker safety, to depress workers\u2019 wages over and over and over again,\u201d said Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio.\n\nThe AFL-CIO opposed the nomination, calling Scalia a union-busting lawyer who has eroded labor rights and consumer protections.\n\n\u201cWe will not forget this betrayal by the Trump administration, and we will never stop fighting to ensure all working people have the safety protections on the job they deserve,\u201d said AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka.\n\nBusiness interests viewed Scalia as a sturdy opponent of government overreach and backed his nomination.\n\nFreedomWorks, a conservative group that helped launch the tea party movement, said Scalia\u2019s confirmation \u201cis a victory in the fight against outdated, burdensome workplace regulations that neither protect employees nor encourage job and wage growth.\u201d\n\nScalia becomes the seventh former lobbyist to hold a Cabinet-level post in the Trump administration.\n\nOn his financial disclosure form filed with the Office of Government Ethics, Scalia listed 49 clients who paid him $5,000 or more for legal services, including e-cigarette manufacturer Juul Labs, Facebook, Ford, Walmart and Bank of America.\n\nDisclosure records show Scalia was registered in 2010 and 2011 to lobby for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\nTrump\u2019s previous labor secretary, Alexander Acosta, resigned in July after renewed criticism for his handling of a 2008 secret plea deal with financier Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein was found dead last month in his cell at a federal jail in Manhattan after his July arrest on sex trafficking charges.\n\nDeputy Labor Secretary Pat Pizzella has been serving as acting secretary.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Republican-led Senate on Thursday confirmed lawyer Eugene Scalia, a son of the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, as President Donald Trump's new labor secretary.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Richard Lardner"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/trump_labor_secretary_72182_c0-227-5444-3401_s1770x1032.jpg?e1c80e6a4299a0d50ce6e826ee367f6e80310c85", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
