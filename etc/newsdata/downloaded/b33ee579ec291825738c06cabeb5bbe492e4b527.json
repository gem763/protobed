A government environmental institute, that farmers say is responsible for publishing misinformation about nitrogen emissions, is located in Utrecht.\n\n\"Last year you didn't hear anything about nitrogen, and now suddenly it's a mortal question,\" farmer Micha Bouwer of the Farmers Defence Force told state broadcaster NOS.\n\n\"These are all people in the city who have two plants on their balcony and say 'nature is suffering'.\"\n\nLivestock farming is a major cause of nitrogen pollution, along with construction and transportation. Farmers argue they have made major efforts to reduce their emissions and say their role in providing food for the nation is under-appreciated.\n\nAlthough no concrete steps against the farmers have been announced, one political party has suggested the Netherlands reduce the number of live animals it produces, leading to an outcry from farming groups.
