Around the same time, Giuliani was drafted into the effort, believing it could help undercut special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s widening investigation into whether members of Trump\u2019s presidential campaign were coopted by Russian intelligence services.\n\n(MORE: President Trump rallies to flip Minnesota amid impeachment fight)\n\n\"I got information [at the time] that a lot of the explanations for how this whole phony investigation started will be in Ukraine,\" Giuliani later recalled to Fox News. \"And it stems around the ambassador and the embassy being used for political purposes. So I began getting some people that were coming forward and telling me about that. And then all of a sudden, they revealed the story about Burisma and Biden\u2019s son.\"\n\nOne of the people Giuliani spoke with was Viktor Shokin, the former prosecutor fired in 2016 at the behest of Biden and other officials around the world who viewed Shokin as deeply corrupt and ineffective. At the time, Biden even threatened to withhold $1 billion in financial assistance to Ukraine if its government didn\u2019t replace Shokin. The International Monetary Fund also threatened to withhold aid if reforms, such as Shokin's removal, weren't made.\n\nIn late January, Giuliani, Parnas, Fruman and others gathered in Giuliani\u2019s New York office to interview Shokin over the phone. Shokin suggested Biden may have wanted him fired to protect Biden\u2019s son, and he told the group that Yovanovitch was \"close to Biden,\" according to notes of the conversation reviewed by ABC News.\n\nPHOTO: Lev Parnas was arrested Thursday, Oct. 10, 2019, on campaign fiance-related charges.
