Police forces have often used non-lethal weapons such as rubber bullets, water cannons, and volleys of tear gas to disperse the immense crowds of protesters that have taken to the streets in recent months.\n\nImages of the tear gas canisters have circulated on social media, showing labels revealing that the weapons were manufactured in Homer City, Pennsylvania, by the company Nonlethal Technologies.\n\nSome US lawmakers have expressed outrage over the developments and announced a bill last week that would ban sales of riot-control equipment to Hong Kong authorities.\n\n\"In the last several weeks of protests, Hong Kong police have used tear gas extensively to disperse protesters.
