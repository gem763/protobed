Finally, Chega may have between 1 and 2 percent of the vote, that is, it may have one deputy.\n\nUnusually for present-day Europe, there was little mention in this election of populism or the far-right.\n\nOfficial estimates suggest the turnout was slightly lower than in previous elections. According to a poll by Cat\u00f3lica for RTP, abstention looks to be between 44% and 49%.\n\nAcross the European Union, radical new parties are reshaping the political landscape while traditional Socialist parties have lost ground, but that\u2019s not the case in Portugal.\n\nCosta, 58, hoped to secure an absolute majority. The wily operator previously held cabinet posts in three governments and served two consecutive terms as mayor of the capital, Lisbon.\n\nHe has overseen a strong economic recovery, with growth climbing from 0.2 per cent in 2014 to 2.1 per cent in 2018 and unemployment dropping by around half, to 6 per cent, over its term.\n\nImmigration off the agenda\n\nUnlike many other recent European elections, immigration has not been an election issue. That may be because the European Union\u2019s migrant surge has largely bypassed Portugal.\n\nHundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants have crossed the Mediterranean from North Africa to southern Europe, triggering a backlash in Italy and Spain. Portugal doesn\u2019t lie on those geographic routes, and as one of western Europe\u2019s financially poorest countries its appeal to migrants is muted.\n\nThe number of asylum-seekers in Germany and France, together numbering more than 300,000 last year, dwarf Portugal\u2019s total, which barely reached four figures.\n\nIf migration reached a similar scale in Portugal, the Portuguese could swiftly change their attitude, says Antonio Costa Pinto, a professor at Lisbon University's Social Sciences Institute.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing making Portugal immune\u201d to migrant controversies, he said.", "description": "Across the EU, radical new parties and far-right populists are reshaping the political landscape.
