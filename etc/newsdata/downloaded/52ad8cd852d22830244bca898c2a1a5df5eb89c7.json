The reality is that the current deal is only marginally better than the old deal\u2014if that. This agreement could have been achieved two years ago if it wasn\u2019t the reckless behavior of politicians. It has cost the UK\u2019s economy a tremendous cost.\n\nBoth the UK and the EU have agreed to scrap the controversial \u201cbackstop\u201d agreement. But the intriguing element is that Northern Ireland is still tied to the EU\u2019s tariffs and customs rules\u2014the only possible way to not have the physical border. Remember, this was the position of the EU from day one. Brexiters always opposed to this decision in the past because, for them, it was humility. In other words, the British lawmakers have made Brexit a complete circus\u2014something which we have pointed out repeatedly.\n\nThe reason that we think that the deal isn\u2019t going to go anywhere is that the DUP announced its disagreement soon after Boris said that a deal has been reached and Sterling soared on the back of this. In addition, the opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn also labeled it as a \u201csell-out\u201d and now we have a situation where both, the opposition leader and the DUP leaders, aren\u2019t going to support this in parliament. Basically, this deal is dead in water\u2014highly likely scenario\u2014and we are going to return to the drawing board.\n\nSadly, traders aren\u2019t going to get much pleasure to enjoy the Friday feeling or get any sleep over this weekend because of the chaotic Brexit situation. We think this could be a chance to go short on Sterling. If the deal is rejected in Parliament, Sterling is likely to fall off the cliff due to a no-deal Brexit threat. On the flip slide\u2014only if a miracle happens\u2014the deal gets green light in parliament, the Sterling-dollar is going to shoot above the 1.35 mark\u2014something we said yesterday.\n\nChinese GDP Growth Data Begins Halloween\n\nUS futures and European markets are trading sharply lower as traders are dismal because of the feeble number out of the second biggest economy of the world, China. Its economy grew 6% during the third quarter and missed the forecast of 6.1%. Something which has spooked investors is that they have not seen this sort of economic growth for China in nearly three decades (precisely, 27 years and half years). The print for the third quarter was also weaker than the previous one. This has anchored pessimism among traders that the world economy is marching towards a major disaster because China and the US are embroiled in a trade war. Sadly, there are still no signs of hope despite the noise around the so-called \u201cphase one deal\u201d by the President of the US.\n\nGDP Growth\n\nThe chart below shows that all the three critical numbers for the Chinese economy are in a clear downtrend and there seems to be no way out.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Naeem Aslam covering: GBP/USD.
