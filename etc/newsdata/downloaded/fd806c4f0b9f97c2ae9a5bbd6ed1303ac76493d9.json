Both figures are notable increases from our previous poll.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nOnly 30% of Americans say they oppose impeaching President Donald Trump, according to Insider's most recent poll.\n\nThe number is unchanged from the first time Insider polled on the subject in the wake of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement of a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump, resulting from a whistleblower complaint alleging that Trump had encouraged the president of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, for potential political gain leading up to the 2020 election.\n\nNow, two weeks later, the consistent numbers suggest that Trump has been unable to rally opposition among voters to House Democrats' investigation.\n\nBoth polls surveyed a sample of more than 1,000 adults nationwide. Conducted September 26-27 and October 3-4 respectively, they each asked \"Impeachment is the first step in the process of removing a president from office. Do you think the House of Representatives should impeach President Trump?\"\n\nResults from Insider's latest poll:\n\nI strongly support impeachment , 30.9%\n\n, 30.9% I support impeachment , 16.1%\n\n, 16.1% I neither support nor oppose impeachment , 13.5%\n\n, 13.5% I oppose impeachment , 9.1%\n\n, 9.1% I strongly oppose impeachment , 20.0%\n\n, 20.0% I don't know, 10.3%\n\nApproximately 20% of respondents from both polls said they \"strongly oppose impeachment,\" while 9 to 10% of respondents from both polls said they \"oppose impeachment.\"\n\nA plurality of respondents \u2014 47% \u2014 said they support impeachment, an amount of support that stayed steady across the two polls. Of that 47%, most said they \"strongly support impeachment.\"\n\nPartisanship has grown on impeachment\n\nIn the time that has elapsed since the outset of the impeachment inquiry, partisanship has increased by a considerable measure, Insider found. Our previous poll found that 73% of respondents who plan to vote in their state's Democratic primary or caucus were in support of impeachment. So were 15% of self-identified Republican voters. Sixty-four percent of those who plan to vote in their state's Republican primary or caucus said they opposed impeachment.\n\nTwo weeks later, 82% of Democratic voters polled said they support impeaching Trump \u2014 a nine percentage point increase. Opposition from Republican voters, meanwhile, increased by 11 percentage points, to 75% \u2014 and Republican support for impeachment decreased to 10%. The shifts suggest that impeachment is becoming an increasingly polarizing topic between the left and the right.\n\nBut polling by both Insider and other organizations has found that a majority of Americans are in favor of impeachment inquiry \u2014 the discovery process leading up to articles of impeachment, or official charges of unlawful behavior, being levied against the president \u2014 and that number is growing regardless of partisanship.\n\nRead more:\n\nA former Trump Organization vice president thinks Trump will resign before getting impeached, just like Nixon did\n\nTrump reportedly told allies that he's worried impeachment will ruin his resume\n\nSwing voters are on the fence about impeaching Trump, but are more inclined to favor it\n\nSurveyMonkey Audience polls from a national sample balanced by census data of age and gender.
