Hollis Johnson/Business Insider\n\nChick-fil-A has the best food, best customer service, and cleanest bathrooms in American fast food, according to Business Insider readers.\n\nThe chain's franchise model helps Chick-fil-A beat out the competition when it comes to service and cleanliness.\n\nChick-fil-A is the third largest chain in the US by sales, growing revenue by 16.7% in 2018 to reach nearly $10.5 billion.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nChick-fil-A customers are confident that the chain is the best in the business.\n\n44% of people who had visited Chick-fil-A in the last six months said the chain had the best food, far more than customers of any other chain.\n\n71% of people who went to Chick-fil-A in the last six months said Chick-fil-A had the best customer service.\n\n51% of people who visited McDonald's in the last six months said the chain had the best bathrooms.

To avoid penalizing Chick-fil-A and other smaller chains, we only considered responses from people who said they visited a chain in the last six months and who said the brand was the best in a category.\n\nIn-N-Out regularly snagged the No. 2 spot in most categories, including best food and cleanest restaurants. But, Chick-fil-A's dominance is clear.\n\nWhy is Chick-fil-A thriving in a way other chains cannot imitate?\n\nOne thing that sets Chick-fil-A apart from rivals is that franchisees are only allowed to open a single location.\n\nThey don't have to pay much \u2014 unlike other chains \u2014 but the process of getting approved is extremely drawn-out and difficult. Once these franchisees have fought to be a part of the system, they are hands-on in making sure their locations are clean and offering top-notch service, which helps explain Chick-fil-A's high scores.\n\nThis model and other aspects of Chick-fil-A's business have helped the chain become one of the most successful in fast food.\n\nThe chain is the third largest in the US by sales, growing revenue by 16.7% in 2018 to reach nearly $10.5 billion, according to Nation's Restaurant News.
