Oh well, maybe next time!\u201d the president tweeted.\n\nCan you imagine if these Do Nothing Democrat Savages, people like Nadler, Schiff, AOC Plus 3, and many more, had a Republican Party who would have done to Obama what the Do Nothings are doing to me.

Like when he calls immigrants an \u2018infestation\u2019 and says \u2018no human being\u2019 would want to live in Baltimore.
