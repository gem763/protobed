He walked Vladimir Guerrero leading off the second and gave up a two-run homer to Randal Grichuk, a 451-foot drive to centre that put Toronto ahead 2-1.\n\nWATCH | Blue Jays lose 7th straight:\n\nTampa Bay defeats Toronto 8-3, have won 10 of their past 11 games. 2:06\n\n\"It's really a step in the right direction,\" Rays manager Kevin Cash said.\n\nA 26-year-old right-hander, Glasnow threw 25 of 41 pitches for strikes, allowing the one hit and two walks. He had not pitched in the major leagues since May 10 and was 6-1 in eight starts with an AL-leading 1.86 ERA when he went on the injured list. Glasnow made a pair of minor league injury rehabilitation assignments for Triple-A Durham.\n\n\"Being able to sit back and watch, it was stressful for me not being there and just watching them do so well,\" Glasnow said. \"Now that I'm back and being able to contribute, it's a little better feeling.\"\n\nJays outscored 24-10 in series\n\nAustin Meadows and Avisail Garcia homered for the Rays, who remained one game ahead of Oakland for the top AL wild card. Tampa Bay, which has won 10 of 11, outscored Toronto 24-10 in the series.\n\nDespite being in contention for a post-season berth, the Rays drew just 14,071 to Tropicana Field for the finale of their next-to-last homestand.\n\nToronto has lost seven straight, its longest skid since April 2017 and 16 of its last 19. At 55-89, the Blue Jays are on pace to lose 100 games for the first time since 1977-79, their first three seasons. Detroit, Baltimore, Miami and Kansas City also are on pace to lose 100 games. The most teams to finish with 100 losses was four in 2002.\n\nTrevor Richards (5-12) allowed one hit in 2 2/3 innings scoreless innings.\n\nJacob Waguespack (4-4) gave up six runs in seven hits in 4 1/3 innings.\n\n\"You want to go out and give your team a chance to win, and it's frustrating how we haven't been able to string one together here,\" Waguespack said. \"I tried to go out and give us a spark today and wasn't able to do it.\"\n\nDaniel Robertson put the Rays ahead to stay with a two-run triple in the second, and Tampa Bay opened a 6-2 lead in the fifth when Garcia and Travis d'Arnaud hit RBI doubles and around Ji-Man Choi's sacrifice fly. Garcia added a two-run homer in the seventh against Sam Gaviglio, a 456-foot drive.\n\nMeadows homered in the fifth, his 28th this season and seventh off Toronto.", "description": "Tampa Bay beat the Blue Jays 8-3 Sunday to complete a four-game sweep that left Toronto as the fifth major league team on pace to lose 100 games.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5275432.1567972794!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/waguespack-jacob-190908-1180.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
