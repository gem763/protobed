BBC pundit Denise Lewis said \u201cthe governing body has let our athletes down\u201d, while her colleague Michael Johnson was caught off camera telling Logan that Coe was \u201cfull of shit\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very easy to sit there and make all sorts of Gabby Logan-type judgments over three or four days and clear off back to Match of the Day,\u201d Coe said of Logan, who is leading the BBC\u2019s athletics coverage in Doha and who sometimes presents the weekly football programme.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s really important that we see the long-term development of our sport. That\u2019s not going to be done because we have challenges over ticketing in a stadium for three days. The problem I\u2019ve got with that is it\u2019s the way our sport is being portrayed by some of the people in that studio.\u201d\n\nCoe called on the BBC to focus its attention on the sporting action, rather than wider political issues.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
