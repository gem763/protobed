They\u2019re all together for eight months, if they are lucky, and see each other more than their wives and children.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s why it often takes an outsider to see what\u2019s really going on. And that\u2019s why Hughes, who watches every opposing team come through Miami, had a worthwhile perspective. DiPuglia said Hughes leaned over and told him, \u201cThis is the best clubhouse I\u2019ve seen in probably the last five years.\u201d\n\n***\n\nHaving made four first-round exits in seven years, the Nationals typically spend October trying to figure out what went wrong, why the latest mix of personalities and talent didn\u2019t click.\n\nAD\n\nThis season\u2019s Nationals have a different feel, benefiting from a noticeable Latin American influence, from veterans such as Gerardo Parra and An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez, to budding stars in Juan Soto and Victor Robles. They were the oldest team in the majors this season, and therefore wise, helping them navigate a 19-31 start and not ditch hope. And their manager, Dave Martinez, has been a fountain of positivity throughout almost two years on the job.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been on teams where you get to the end of the year and say, \u2018I never even talked to that guy,\u2019\u201d reliever Sean Doolittle said. \u201cThat\u2019s natural. Players gravitate to who they can relate to or who plays their spot on the field. But not this team. It\u2019s something special.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOne member of the front office noted: \u201cThis team needed certain guys, Davey included, to realize that everything doesn\u2019t have to be so negative. This group broke that funk.\u201d Many players say Parra and S\u00e1nchez brought a looseness that didn\u2019t exist before. The Nationals dance in the dugout after every home run. They celebrate victories like milestones \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s hard to win in the majors,\u201d veteran Adam Eaton said with a grin \u2014 whether it\u2019s smashing cabbage heads, blowing whistles or staging the occasional conga line. They\u2019ve even gotten their most stoic players, namely pitcher Stephen Strasburg, to join in.\n\nAD\n\nThe result, in part, is that they\u2019ll play baseball into the final days of October. Their worst-kept secret is that they are having a lot of fun.\n\n\u201cThey have to be able to play,\u201d Rizzo said of how personality is considered during roster construction. \u201cThat\u2019s the first and foremost. But character guys that have had some experiences, successes and some failures, I think that all comes into play.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n***\n\nBuilding this team was always going to be different for Rizzo.\n\nIt became clear last winter, when the calendar was about to turn, that he\u2019d no longer have Bryce Harper as the franchise centerpiece. The Nationals offered Harper a 10-year, $300 million deal in September. A lot of the money was deferred for decades. A second offer was made around Christmas, after Harper met with Rizzo and Ted Lerner in Palm Springs, Calif., but it wasn\u2019t enough. And the Nationals already had begun pushing their money elsewhere.\n\nAD\n\nThey signed Patrick Corbin to a six-year, $140 million contract in early December. They knew their lineup would be led by holdovers \u2014 Anthony Rendon, Juan Soto, Trea Turner and so on \u2014 but padded it with two proven catchers, Yan Gomes and Kurt Suzuki, plus veteran Brian Dozier at second. A rotation of Max Scherzer, Strasburg, Corbin and S\u00e1nchez was their nucleus from the start. Newfound resources led to offensive depth. But Harper\u2019s departure is still a topic the team can\u2019t avoid.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBryce is a phenomenal player, one of the best players I\u2019ve ever played with,\u201d said Ryan Zimmerman, a Nationals lifer, after the team advanced to the World Series. \u201cThat\u2019s the business part of this game. You can\u2019t keep everybody. We would have loved to keep him. We would love to keep anybody who\u2019s been a really good player here. That\u2019s just how it works out. He\u2019s a big part of why we\u2019re here today, as well.\u201d\n\nZimmerman\u2019s thoughts are the company line among players. They don\u2019t paint Harper as having held them back for the past seven seasons. They focus on what was added in 2019 rather than what was lost. The simple math is that Harper signing with the Philadelphia Phillies, for 13 years and $330 million, added a ton of flexibility to their payroll.\n\nAD\n\nOnly nine players remain from the team that lost in the NLDS two years ago. This team has eight players of Latin American descent, up from five in 2017, including a few others who have bounced between the major and minor leagues, and Gomes is the first Brazilian-born player in major league history. Players feel the diversity in backgrounds and experiences has brought them closer. And there is frequent, and fond, mention that this is now a club without a star. Harper sucked up attention and, last season, his impending free agency hung over the franchise. Rendon is set to hit the open market in November, and that\u2019s cause for tension, too, yet he deflects the spotlight whenever possible. Strasburg, similarly quiet, has an opt-out clause he can exercise after the season. But winning has pushed aside those concerns.\n\nAD\n\nWhen discussing clubhouse dynamics recently, Eaton pointed to a mocking \u201cpassive aggression\u201d that keeps everyone on their toes. The 30-year-old was not tying any of his observations to Harper. He rather described an environment that welcomes constant ribbing and accountability. Scherzer, Eaton explained, is as much a target of jokes as middle relievers or minor league call-ups. But Scherzer also took Eaton aside in Atlanta in September, after Eaton didn\u2019t tag up from second to third, and told him he simply had to do better.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all on the same level,\u201d Eaton said, using a hand to motion around the clubhouse. \u201cNo one is safe.\u201d\n\n***\n\nMany of the Nationals\u2019 traditions began with S\u00e1nchez and Parra, who are both from Venezuela, and who were both cast off before landing here. Parra, 32, was designated for assignment by the San Francisco Giants in late April. S\u00e1nchez, 35, signed with Washington just a year after he considered retirement.\n\nAD\n\nWhen Parra joined the Nationals in Los Angeles in May, after they had been swept by the Milwaukee Brewers, the two hugged and jumped into a long conversation. Then they taught their teammates how to relax.\n\n\u201cIt was like a hamburger without any ketchup or salt, or mayonnaise, or mustard,\u201d DiPuglia said of the clubhouse before Parra arrived. \u201cHe put all of the condiments on top of the hamburger.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI never do nothing intentional,\u201d Parra said. \u201cEverything I do, I do from my heart because, if you don\u2019t do it from your heart, nothing happen like it will happen right now.\u201d\n\nIn just a few months, Parra and S\u00e1nchez have introduced the following routines to Washington: Parra wears pink-tinted sunglasses during games; S\u00e1nchez\u2019s pair has orange lenses. Parra uses \u201cBaby Shark\u201d as his walk-up music and now thousands of people clap in unison when he comes to the plate. They wrap Strasburg in group hugs after he exits strong outings \u2014 Strasburg describes himself as \u201cnot much of a hugger\u201d \u2014 and Strasburg and Parra were dancing together, hands clasped, during the World Series-clinching celebration. The dugout dance parties were Parra and S\u00e1nchez\u2019s brain child. Yet neither will take credit for the eased vibe.\n\nAD\n\nThey are, after all, just a part of the Latin American influence on this team. It has been 10 years since a scandal rocked the Nationals\u2019 operation in the Dominican Republic, leading general manager Jim Bowden and adviser Jose Rijo to lose their jobs. A federal probe found that 16-year-old prospect Esmailyn \u201cSmiley\u201d Gonzalez, a budding shortstop, was actually a 20-year-old named Carlos Alvarez. Their Dominican academy closed and had to be built back up from scratch.\n\nAD\n\nAll that is in the current outfield, where Soto and Robles have become pillars of the present and future. Soto, 20, is Washington\u2019s cleanup hitter and a premier slugger. Robles, 22, is a Gold Glove candidate in center. They are both from Santo Domingo and came through a revamped system run by DiPuglia. And now they are in a clubhouse that doesn\u2019t feel so different from home.\n\n\u201cWhen you have all of those kids, everyone's speaking Spanish and you have the music going, a lot of the Americans sometimes aren't very happy about it,\u201d DiPuglia said. \u201cAnd they accepted it and part of them became Latinos, too. It was one of the most unbelievable things I've ever seen.\u201d\n\nThat shows in Strasburg\u2019s rigid dance moves, whether in the dugout after a home run in July, or during any of the beer-soaked celebrations across the past month. It showed in St. Louis toward the end of the season, when Scherzer used broken Spanish to teach Robles how to play Sudoku. He told Robles to be absolutely sure before writing any numbers down. So Robles, not one for slow processes, attacked the page with a pen. Scherzer could only smile and sigh. Then there is Dozier, a near-fluent Spanish speaker from Mississippi, singing every word to Pedro Cap\u00f3\u2019s \u201cCalma\u201d with teammates gathered around.\n\nThe Nationals have four regular players from the Dominican Republic, three from Venezuela and another from Cuba. The atmosphere reminds DiPuglia of a bunch of teenagers in the Dominican Summer League. He quickly added that that\u2019s a compliment.\n\n\u201cYou see Latin players have a certain confidence, swagger, always having fun on the field,\u201d Dozier said. \u201cIt really feels like this entire team has adopted that.\u201d\n\n***\n\nNow comes the final push, starting in Houston on Tuesday night, sure to decide how the Nationals will remember this season. They got to the last weeks of the season, and that\u2019s an accomplishment in itself, but the Astros are a waiting giant. They have Gerrit Cole, Justin Verlander and Zack Greinke in their rotation. They have one of baseball\u2019s best offenses. They won the title two years ago, with a lot of the same faces, and that gives them the experience edge.\n\nThe Nationals\u2019 chemistry and character were engines all season, but neither should eclipse their talent and drive.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t mistake the fun we have for being content with just getting here,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cThat would be wrong. We\u2019re fully confident we can win the whole thing. It would be a big disappointment to come this far and not finish it off.\u201d\n\nThe disappointment, at first, was being 12 games below .500 in mid-May. It was the possibility that Martinez could be fired. It was the rumors that it would be smart to trade key veterans, such as Scherzer or Rendon, to stock up for the future. But the Nationals didn\u2019t wilt under the weight of their shortcomings. Instead, in a twist, because of their new complexions and camaraderie, they stuck together.\n\nThe most successful teams often do.", "description": "The secret to the Nationals' enviable clubhouse chemistry: They really do like each other.", "authors": ["Jesse Dougherty", "Reporter Covering The Washington Nationals."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/X-sTj9oH9AUCNMgxdM8QLck1HBA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/U3OWRQHAVYI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
