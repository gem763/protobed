I wouldn\u2019t be doing what I\u2019m doing if they didn\u2019t carve the way. They served as a source of inspiration, you can go all the way back to [Favreau\u2019s breakthrough film] Swingers.\u201d\n\nAs well as Iron Man, Favreau has directed its follow-up, Iron Man 2, the recent Disney remakes of The Jungle Book and The Lion King, and is the creator of the Star Wars spin-off TV show The Mandalorian coming out in the US next month.\n\nFavreau added: \u201cThey can express whatever opinion they like.\u201d\n\nScorsese and Coppola have both aimed barbs in recent days at blockbuster superhero films. Scorsese likened them to \u201ctheme parks\u201d, while Coppola described Marvel as \u201cdespicable\u201d. Their views were echoed by British director Ken Loach, who called superhero films \u201cboring\u201d and \u201ca cynical exercise [that] has nothing to do with the art of cinema\u201d.\n\nBut directors including James Gunn (Guardians of the Galaxy) and Joss Whedon (The Avengers) have defended the genre, with Gunn writing on social media: \u201cSuperheroes are simply today\u2019s gangsters/cowboys/outer space adventurers.\u201d", "description": "Veteran directors are still his heroes, says younger film-maker, despite dismissal of superhero fare such as his own Iron Man movies", "authors": ["Andrew Pulver"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/525bc49b3f9e4298b15e757ca33906de2194f804/0_184_3180_1908/master/3180.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1411dc71db95dc8bb9e7221abc3ed90f", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
