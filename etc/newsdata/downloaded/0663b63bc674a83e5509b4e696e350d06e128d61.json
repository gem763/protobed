That problem was overcome by using an underwater parachute anchor to slow the boom so it catches quicker moving trash.\n\nAlso, late last year, the barrier broke under the constant pummeling by wind and waves in the Pacific, requiring four months of repairs before being relaunched from Vancouver in June.\n\nThe system also experienced a problem with \u201covertopping\u201d _ waves that pushed the plastic over the line of floating corks that hold the screen. That was solved by using a line of larger corks to corral the plastic.\n\nThe organization wants to continue developing the plastic traps, scale them up and deploy more to the Pacific so they can gather thousands of tons of plastic each year. However, Slat did not say when the second version would be ready for launch.\n\nSlat\u2019s organization is one of a handful of groups working to collect trash from the open oceans.\n\nThere is more than enough to keep them busy.\n\nIt is estimated that between 600,000 and 800,000 metric tons of fishing gear is abandoned or lost during storms each year in the oceans, according to the Trash Free Seas Program at Ocean Conservancy, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group.\n\nAnother 9 million tons (8 million metric tons) of plastic waste, including plastic bottles, bags, toys and other items, flow annually into the ocean from beaches, rivers and creeks, according to experts.\n\nSlat said the next move is to scale up the device and make it stronger, so it can stay at sea for longer and hold onto all the plastic it collects for a year or more before a ship collects the trash.\n\nSummarizing, he said: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of work still ahead of us.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "The floating boom is catching waste ranging in size from a car wheel with tire to 1 millimeter chips of plastic, despite previous setbacks.", "authors": ["Mike Corder"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/the-ocean-cleanup.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}
