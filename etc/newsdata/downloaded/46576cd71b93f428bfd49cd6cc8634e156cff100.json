Hey! Hey!\u201d that sprang from the Washington Nationals\u2019 dugout and straight into everyone\u2019s ears.\n\nThese post-home run parties have seemed a bit quieter in recent weeks. Or maybe there have just been fewer of them. But now they showed how the Nationals narrowly beat the Marlins, 6-4, on Friday night. Trea Turner hit a solo home run in the third inning. That triggered the first round of chants and claps. Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera then smacked a three-run shot in the fourth, giving Washington a lead it never yielded, and the chants and claps were even louder. Turner\u2019s second solo homer came in the seventh, right as the game tightened, and that led his teammates into scattered screams.\n\nNationals starter An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez didn\u2019t have his best stuff. He gave up four runs, three of them earned, in five innings, but the offense was able to cover for him. Wander Suero allowed two inherited runners to score after S\u00e1nchez exited in the sixth. Then Tanner Rainey came in and wiggled away from additional danger, and the Marlins\u2019 bats went quiet from there.\n\nThree homers accounted for five of the Nationals\u2019 six runs. The victory, Washington\u2019s 14th in 17 meetings vs. Miami, kept the Nationals a game up on the Milwaukee Brewers for the National League\u2019s top wild-card spot. The Chicago Cubs dropped two behind the Brewers with another loss. The Nationals have 10 games remaining, in a stretch of nine days, and have regained control of their destiny.\n\n\u201cAll games right now are really tough for us,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cIt\u2019s not time for mistakes. It\u2019s not time for taking any game for granted. We need to play harder than normal. Always in baseball, it\u2019s not how you start, it\u2019s how you finish. And we need to finish really, really strong.\u201d\n\nWashington\u2019s day started with a welcome dose of familiarity. As players trickled into the clubhouse and turned two corners on the way to their lockers, Dave Martinez\u2019s voice could be heard in the manager\u2019s office. Martinez missed the past three games after undergoing a cardiac catheterization in Washington on Monday. Doctors decided on the procedure, used to assess a heart\u2019s condition, after Martinez felt chest pains during Sunday\u2019s win over the Atlanta Braves. Test results came back negative, Martinez was cleared to travel, and by Friday afternoon he was hugging players and making up for lost time.\n\nMartinez gripped the back of a black leather couch while his relievers came over to greet him. He didn\u2019t stop grinning while they did. Being away \u201cstunk,\u201d he expressed later, but it gave him a chance to review his players\u2019 individual seasons and plan for what lies ahead. It also made it near impossible to ignore the standings, a topic Martinez likes to avoid at all costs.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have to look, I heard it,\u201d Martinez said with a laugh. \u201cNow you hear it every day, you know? It\u2019s 24/7 every day. You can\u2019t go on Google without it popping up. But it\u2019s fun. We\u2019re playing for something.\u201d\n\nThe Cubs have been chasing the Nationals for weeks now, eyeing the front of the wild-card race, even after they slipped behind the Brewers on Thursday night. But a small skid has given Washington a bit of breathing room. The Nationals finished their previous game at 3:11 p.m. in St. Louis on Wednesday. They began their series opener with the Marlins at 7:11 p.m. Friday. In that span, exactly 52 hours, the Cubs suffered three losses while the Nationals rested. It was a rare break in what\u2019s been a hectic September. And it helped Washington put three full games between making the postseason and missing it altogether.\n\nThe Nationals started that process once Turner popped that solo homer with two outs in the top of the third. It was Washington\u2019s 216th of the season, a franchise record, and came off a full-count fastball from Marlins starter Robert Dugger. But the Marlins got that run right back in the bottom half. S\u00e1nchez yielded a leadoff double to Austin Dean, balked Dean to third and, with one out, gave up an RBI single to Jon Berti.\n\nBut the Nationals soon broke Dugger down. Cabrera came up with two on and one out in the fourth. Then he hunted a first-pitch fastball and punched it over the fence in right-center. That gave him 33 RBI in 30 games since joining the Nationals in early August. That created enough separation for the Nationals to grab a victory, regardless of S\u00e1nchez and Suero\u2019s mistakes in the sixth, rounded out by three scoreless innings from Fernando Rodney and Daniel Hudson out of the bullpen. Hudson finished it with his second six-out save in four days.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re all pretty much must-win,\u201d Hudson said. \u201cThey have been for a while.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals arrived in Miami having lost 10 of 16 games. That invited the Brewers into their personal space. That gave the Cubs a chance to get there, too. But playing the Marlins, now a 100-loss team, was always going to be a chance to get on track. They were the first team Washington beat when it turned its season around in late May. And here they were again, at the end of a rebuilding season, the perfect match for a Nationals team that needs every win it can get.", "description": "Trea Turner homers twice, Asdr\u00fabal Cabrera hits a three-run shot and Daniel Hudson collects a six-out save in 6-4 win.", "authors": ["Jesse Dougherty", "Reporter Covering The Washington Nationals.", "September At Pm", "Jesse Dougherty Covers The Washington Nationals."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_iCe12z6RexaDaiS7OU7zx1Wro4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/FYEVF2W4DEI6TJUIGA3JH62LBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
