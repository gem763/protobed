Photo by Kabelo Tlhabanelo.\n\nA MEMBER of the family was brutally murdered in his flat in 2015.\n\nNow, almost four years later, the Van Wyks of Heidedal in Mangaung, Free Statewant to know if they have to kill to see justice served.\n\nTheir story was published in Daily Sun under the headline: \u201cWe are not afraid!\u201d on 10 December 2018.\n\nThe family wanted closure. They believe a bribe was involved to stop 34-year-old Theo van Wyk\u2019s murder being probed.\n\nAnd when they started to ask questions, they received photos in the post of his bloodied body. That\u2019s when the cops allegedly stopped the murder probe.\n\nLeft with more questions than answers, the family took up the matter at police headquarters. But the new investigating officer allegedly also failed the family.\n\nThat was when a third cop was allocated to the case. But he, too, was allegedly unhelpful.\n\nTheo\u2019s sister, Theonie (40), said the matter, like Bafana Bafana captain Senzo Meyiwa\u2019s case, was suspiciously dragging on for far too long.\n\n\u201cShould I kill someone to get justice? I feel the police are failing us as a family. But at least the new investigating officer, the fourth, is doing more work than the previous ones,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHe started being flexible. That gave me hope. Unlike the others, he did visit our home for updates. But, suddenly, he went quiet like the others. He later told me he was awaiting the prosecutor\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cIt has been more than three years and eight months. I have had enough of the police! I don\u2019t think my brother is resting in peace. I want answers.\u201d\n\nShe said she didn\u2019t understand why the family has to follow up on the cops.\n\nFree State NPA spokesman Shuping Phaladi said there was no time frame for an investigation.\n\nPhaladi said: \u201cI advise the family to ask the investigating officer who the prosecutor is. Depending on their workload, the prosecutor will tell the family the estimated time for a decision.\u201d", "description": "A MEMBER of the family was brutally murdered in his flat in 2015.", "authors": ["Kabelo Tlhabanelo"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8415/10e5ec32814f458c8894e6e072601246.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-27"}
