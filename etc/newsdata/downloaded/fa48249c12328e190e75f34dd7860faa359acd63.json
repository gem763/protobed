(Photo: Michael Loccisano, Getty Images)\n\nMeghan McCain broke her silence about a \"horrendous\" miscarriage she suffered in an op-ed for the New York Times in July.\n\nNow, \"The View\" co-host is continuing to share her story in the hopes other women going through loss don't feel so alone.\n\nOctober is Pregnancy and Infant Loss Awareness Month, so McCain reflected on her experience for \"Good Morning America.\"\n\n\"I don't want to be the face of death and miscarriage, but I also feel like life throws things at you that are unexpected and you have to roll with the punches. And I would rather continue to open up dialogues and conversations,\" she told the outlet. \"I just hope that women out there know that they aren't alone and they haven't done anything wrong. And that the pain is real and it's totally understandable.\"\n\nMcCain, who married conservative pundit Ben Domenech in November 2017, shared in both an op-ed and to \"GMA\" that she blamed herself for the miscarriage. She blamed her \"stressful life,\" her age and even her personality.\n\nBut the co-host is learning now that those thoughts were not \"rational\" and since then she has tried to be easier on herself.\n\n\"It's not easy being a woman. It's just not. And I know how hard I was on myself and I'm sure a lot of women do the same thing. And you just feel really alone.\"\n\nMeghan McCain on husband Ben Domenech: 'Conservative men have better family values'\n\nVanna White: 'Wheel of Fortune' fans and family helped her through miscarriage, fiance's death\n\nMcCain also shared that she leaned on her friend and co-host Abby Huntsman, who at the time was pregnant with twins. She recognized that the dynamic could have been difficult, both for Hunstman to watch while pregnant, but also for McCain to be \"going through a miscarriage while she was pregnant.\"\n\n\"I think it's intense to give birth to twins too. And it's a very specific moment in time that was very, very hard for both of us that made us bond.\"\n\nMcCain also spoke about experiencing the miscarriage right around the 1-year anniversary of her father's death. The late Arizona Sen. John McCain died Aug. 25, 2018 from cancer.\n\n\"My dad was like, the ending of a beautiful long-lived life and I grieve that and the way I grieved having a miscarriage, and grieved my daughter was what could have been,\" she told \"GMA.\"\n\n\"It's hard. It's just really, really, really hard, and I empathize with all women who have gone through it and who may go through it. It's just horrific. And it doesn't really get easier either.\"\n\nThe co-host ended with a final message to women going through pregnancy loss.\n\n\"Whatever you feel is totally fine and totally where you're supposed to be. And I wish I had heard that.\"\n\nFollow the latest from USA TODAY Parenting at usatoday.com/life/parenting.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/30/meghan-mccain-abby-huntsman-bonded-miscarriage-the-view/4095239002/", "description": "\"The View\" co-host Meghan McCain continues to have an open dialogue about miscarriage and she hopes it helps others feel less alone.", "authors": ["Amy Haneline", "Published A.M.
