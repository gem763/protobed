[Laughter] We\u2019re trying to make AR and VR a big thing in the next five years to 10 years \u2026,' reads the transcript.\n\n'I don\u2019t know, you think Libra is hard to launch. \u201cFacebook wants to perform brain surgery,\u201d I don\u2019t want to see the congressional hearings on that one.'\n\nConversely, another player in the the world of brain-to-computer interfaces, Neuralink, which is owned by Elon musk, has been focusing more on invasive ways of meshing human brains and computers.", "description": "At an ongoing discussion series run by Facebook, Zuckerberg talked about the idea of technology that can translate a person's brain signals for use in augmented and virtual reality.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/23/14211300-0-image-a-6_1570746196854.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
