Unfortunately, when the man came home, he had no idea that his ex-girlfriend had been to the room and came home with his new girlfriend who helped herself to the yoghurt and collapsed shortly afterwards,\u201d he told DRUM.\n\nThe girlfriend was then rushed to the hospital and given treatment.\n\n\u201cAfter the woman collapsed, the man\u2019s landlord alerted the man that his ex-girlfriend had been around earlier and said she could have done something.
