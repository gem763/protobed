Reuters TV via REUTERS\n\nOliver Letwin, 63, is a former cabinet minister with a reputation as an unofficial fixer, using his affable manner and procedural knowledge to head off awkward disagreements in parliament. Brexit has given him notoriety as a rebel with a cause: to stop a no-deal Brexit.\n\nThe first Saturday sitting of parliament for 37 years was supposed to frame the approval of Johnson\u2019s EU divorce deal, but Letwin, expelled by Johnson from the Conservative Party, may have snared the prime minister in a legislative booby-trap.\n\nIn a move that indicates the level of suspected perfidy that runs through both sides of the Brexit schism, Letwin proposed a 26-word amendment that, he says, removes any chance of a no-deal Brexit by deferring a decision on Johnson\u2019s deal.\n\nThe Letwin amendment potentially turns Johnson\u2019s Brexit finale on its head by leaving the prime minister exposed to a humiliating obligation to ask the EU for a delay until the end of January 2020.\n\nThe tension between the two men was on display on the floor of parliament, a 19th-century gothic palace.\n\nFixing his eyes on Letwin, Johnson said: \u201cThis is a momentous occasion for our country and our parliament, and it would be a great shame if the opportunity to have a meaningful vote ... were to be taken away from us.\u201d\n\nLetwin, standing in the debating chamber clutching a sheaf of parliamentary papers, looked on impassively.\n\nLawmakers will vote on Letwin\u2019s proposal later on Saturday. If approved, Johnson\u2019s deal will not be voted upon, and he will be obliged by a law passed by his opponents to write to the EU to request a delay.\n\n\u2018SIMPLE AS THAT!\u2019\n\nLetwin was one of 21 Conservatives expelled from the party in September for not supporting Johnson\u2019s pledge to leave the EU on Oct. 31 with or without a deal, and he has focused his parliamentary acumen on preventing a no-deal Brexit.\n\nLetwin said he supports Johnson\u2019s deal but wants to close a loophole whereby hardline Brexit supporters could support the deal on Saturday but then block the legislation needed to implement it, leaving Britain on course for a disorderly exit at the end of the month.\n\n\u201cMy aim is to ensure that Boris\u2019s deal succeeds, but that we have an insurance policy which prevents the UK from crashing out on 31 October by mistake if something goes wrong during the passage of the implementing legislation,\u201d Letwin said in a note explaining his proposal.\n\n\u201cSimple as that!\u201d\n\nLetwin says parliamentary approval for the deal, required in order to ratify it, should be withheld until the government has passed the legislation needed to implement the exit agreement.\n\nThe proposal is so dangerous for Johnson because it unites a diverse section of lawmakers who oppose Brexit altogether or want a second referendum with those who support leaving with a deal, but not without a deal - a coalition that looks likely to command majority support.\n\nWhile the motivation of the amendment is fear of Brexit betrayal, the proposal has stoked a similar mistrust among supporters of Brexit who see a plot to sink it in a legislative quagmire.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wrecking amendment, hiding behind the transparent veneer of opposing a no-deal outcome in the hope of giving the Remain Parliament an opportunity to force through a second referendum,\u201d Conservative Brexit supporter Andrew Bridgen said.", "description": "Fearing Britain could drop out of the European Union without a deal by design or default, one British lawmaker has threatened to deny Prime Minister Boris Johnson his day of Brexit glory by delaying a vote on a last-minute divorce deal.", "authors": ["William James", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442658753&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I0AL", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
