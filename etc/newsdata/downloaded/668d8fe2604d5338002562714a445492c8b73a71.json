The inaugural hosting of the competition has been awarded to China in reward to the nation's commitment to investing in their own football project over recent years.\n\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino had reportedly wanted to include 12 European teams in the inaugural event, but this was reduced on request of UEFA.\n\nThe top two European competitions - the Champions League and the Europa League, would take two of the eight allocated slots over each four year period.\n\nAs reported, the likes of Liverpool and Chelsea would be included, along with Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid.", "description": "Liverpool and Chelsea look set for trips to China, after FIFA granted the nation the\u00a0rights to host the inaugural version of its expanded Club World Cup.", "authors": ["Danny Gallagher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/12/19987974-0-image-a-6_1571657019889.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
