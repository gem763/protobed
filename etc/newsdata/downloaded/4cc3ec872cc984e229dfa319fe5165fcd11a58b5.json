The Islamic republic has denied being behind the raids which were claimed by Yemen\u2019s Iran-aligned Houthi group.\n\nPirouz Mousavi, head of the Pars Special Economic Energy Zone (PSEEZ), inspected the area and met senior managers, including those in charge of cyber security and emergency response, SHANA said on Wednesday.\n\nThe PSEEZ was set up in 1998 to develop the oil and gas resources in the South Pars field, the world\u2019s largest natural gas reservoir. The offshore field is shared between Iran and Qatar, which calls it North Field.\n\nSeparately, Gholamreza Jalali, head of civil defense which is in charge of cyber security, called for beefing up security at industrial installations and said: \u201cOur enemies consider the cyber domain as one of the main areas of threat against nations, especially Iran,\u201d the semi-official news agency Fars reported.\n\nAfter reports on social media last Friday of a cyber attack on some petrochemical and other companies in Iran, a state body in charge of cyber security denied there had been a successful attack.\n\nNetBlocks, an organization that monitors internet connectivity, earlier reported \u201cintermittent disruptions\u201d to some internet services in Iran.\n\nIran said in June U.S. cyber attacks against Iranian targets had not been successful, after reports the Pentagon had launched a cyber attack to disable the country\u2019s rocket launch systems following the downing of a U.S. military drone.\n\nIran has long been on alert over the threat of cyber attacks by foreign countries. The United States and Israel covertly sabotaged Iran\u2019s nuclear program in 2009 and 2010 with the now-famous Stuxnet computer virus, which destroyed Iranian centrifuges that were enriching uranium.", "description": "Iran has launched an inspection of security at its key Gulf oil and gas facilities, including preparedness for cyber attacks, the Oil Ministry news agency SHANA said, following media reports of Washington weighing possible cyber attacks on Tehran.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
