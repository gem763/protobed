Today marks THREE ENTIRE YEARS of sobriety for me! Y\u2019all already know, but allow me to recap,\u201d she wrote on Oct. 22. \u201cThree years ago I was receiving Narcan to bring me back to life after I had overdosed on heroin; all while my son, my mom and her wife stood and watched. While those are such emotional moments for my family to recall, that\u2019s really not what is MOST important today. What is really important today, is the fact that Narcan saved my life! Narcan kept me alive until I wanted to live! While I can admit that my son was unfortunately NOT enough to keep me sober then, he is my motivation today.\u201d\n\nHurt wrote that had Narcan not been available to her, or \u201chad someone who felt that I DIDN\u2019T DESERVE Narcan been there that day,\u201d she would have never had the chance to get sober and \u201cmy son would be growing up without ever knowing his mom.\u201d\n\nHurt said she \u201ctruly enjoyed sharing my 3 years of recovery with you all,\u201d and thanked her photographer for being open to booking her photo shoot. In some of the pics, Hurt is even seen holding a sign that says \u201cNarcan saved my life,\u201d while her son holds one that says \u201cAnd now I get to have my mommy.\u201d\n\nMOM HEARTBROKEN BY DAUGHTER'S HEROIN DEATH WARNS IT COULD HAPPEN TO ANYONE: LEXI WAS NOT 'A JUNKIE'\n\nHurt\u2019s personal post received over 5,000 likes and was shared more than 4,200 times.
