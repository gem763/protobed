There was a lot of severe swearing.'\n\nThe 27-year-old also said he wasn't shocked to have played in an empty stadium.\n\nChoi Young-il, the vice president of the Korea Football Association, also criticised how North Korea conducted themselves during the goalless encounter.\n\n'It was like war. I've never seen such [aggression] in football until now,' he said.\n\nMeanwhile, South Korea's coach Paulo Bento hit out at his own side's performance.\n\nSon (right) and his South Korea team-mates arrive at Incheon airport early on Thursday\n\n'It wasn't a good match at all. We didn't execute what we'd prepared,' Bento told reporters.\n\n'We didn't have a great first half in particular, and the opponents held us in check. We got better in the second half, but there were too many stoppages of play because of the referee.'\n\nThe game was the first competitive meeting between the national men's teams in the North Korean capital, although the North hosted the South for a friendly in 1990.\n\nThe second match between the Koreas is scheduled for June 4 next year in South Korea.", "description": "The historic encounter at the Kim\u00a0II-Sung Stadium in Pyongyang saw South Korean spectators and journalists banned from attending the game, while there was also no live broadcast of the match.", "authors": ["Sam Mcevoy For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/07/19823174-0-image-a-43_1571293310474.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
