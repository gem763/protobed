This feature, as opposed to just suggesting tags, will recognize you, and notify you, if your profile photo is used by someone else or if you appear in photos where you haven\u2019t been tagged.\n\n\u201cPeople who newly join Facebook or who previously had the tag-suggestions setting will have the face-recognition setting,\u201d the company said.\n\nBut users will be able to opt out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you don\u2019t currently have the facial-identification tool on and do nothing, Facebook won\u2019t use facial recognition to identify you or suggest tags. Plus, features like Photo Review, which notifies you when you appear in photos you aren\u2019t tagged, won\u2019t be activated.\n\nPeople will still be able to tag friends manually, the company explained, but it won\u2019t suggest that you to be tagged in photos if you do not have face recognition turned on. Facebook\u2019s face-I.D. tool still does not recognize you to strangers. And the company said it doesn\u2019t sell its technology or share your face-recognition information with third parties.\n\nTicker Security Last Change %Chg FB FACEBOOK INC. 187.16 +4.77 +2.62%\n\nThe social media company said it would notify account holders of the updates Tuesday, and that the \u201cnotice will include information about the new features and options to learn more about how we use face recognition, along with a button to turn it on or keep it off.\u201d\n\nThe changes are part of an effort to make privacy settings clearer, Facebook said. The company stated it\u2019s providing users with more \u201copportunity to review information about our technology and the features it powers so you can make the choice that\u2019s right for you.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve continued to engage with privacy experts, academics, regulators and people on Facebook about how we use face recognition and the options you have to control it.\u201d\n\nData privacy has been in the public eye for some time, with a spotlight on social media giants like Facebook. An Illinois lawsuit accused Facebook of violating the state\u2019s Biometric Information Privacy Act by illegally collecting and storing data of millions users.\n\nAnd Facebook is still dealing with the fallout from the 2016 presidential campaign, in which experts argued Russian hackers used Facebook user data to interfere in the election.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "\u201cWe\u2019ve continued to engage with privacy experts, academics, regulators and people on Facebook about how we use face recognition and the options you have to control it,\" the company said in a statement.", "authors": ["Shawn M.
