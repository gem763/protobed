REUTERS/Ivan Alvarado/File Photo/File Photo\n\nSANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile is making a renewed push for battery technology investment in return for access to its lithium deposits, piquing interest from China, Japan and Europe as global firms look to tie up supply of the metal vital for the shift to electric vehicles.\n\nThe South American country, the world\u2019s No. 2 lithium producer, has held global road shows ahead of a second lithium-for-investment tender, according to officials and Chilean government documents seen by Reuters.\n\nThese have attracted dozens of firms in China, Japanese battery makers like Toshiba Corp (6502.T) and Russia\u2019s state nuclear agency Rosatom, the documents show, lured by potential access to Chile\u2019s huge deposits of the \u201cwhite gold\u201d under the arid salt flats in the Atacama desert.\n\nAn auction - slated for early 2020 - offers a guaranteed supply of discounted Chilean lithium in exchange for a commitment to build battery parts plants in Chile as the government looks to move up the value chain.\n\nOversupply and plummeting lithium prices, however, have made the deal a tough sell. In a previous tender in 2018, all three winners, including electronics giant Samsung SDI (006400.KS) and Korean steelmaker Posco, subsequently dropped out.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see this ending any better than the previous auction,\u201d said Jaime Alee, a Chilean lithium consultant who has advised foreign investors in the country. He noted that the global trend was for supply chains closer to home.\n\n\u201cGiven this, I just don\u2019t see the logic in installing (a plant) in Chile.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, Chile\u2019s huge deposits are a lure amid a sharpening race to lock in supplies, which will be key to a future of electrified transport and smart devices.\n\nChile\u2019s investment and development agencies InvestChile and CORFO held events in China, France, Japan and South Korea this year to drum up interest. They say issues from the first auction have since been resolved.\n\nThe road shows attracted interest in China from dozens of firms, including China Development Bank, energy firm TBEA, chemicals giant Sinochem and aluminium producer Chinalco, the document dated Aug. 29 showed.\n\nJapanese banks and miners, South Korea\u2019s overseas infrastructure body, Belgium\u2019s Umicore (UMI.BR) and French transportation conglomerate Bollore (BOLL.PA) attended other global shows, an official for InvestChile confirmed.\n\nA statement from Rosatom Group confirmed its companies were weighing their options in Chile.\n\n\u201cRosatom\u00b4s organizations are still considering Chile as a potential partner for implementation of lithium projects and supporting local government\u00b4s initiatives aimed to attract foreign companies to participate in joint projects in this area,\u201d it said.\n\nBollore declined to comment, as did Japan\u2019s Toshiba, with spokesman Ryoji Shinohara adding: \u201cWe are not disclosing business-related information, including participation in such road shows, unless an official decision is made.\u201d\n\nSinochem said in an emailed response it does \u201cnot have a plan to build a plant in Chile in the near future\u201d.\n\nA Chinalco spokesman said he was unaware of the matter, while China Development Bank, TBEA and Umicore did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLITTLE BY LITTLE\n\nChinese interest in Chilean lithium in particular has grown as the Asian giant ramps up production of electric vehicles. Last year, China\u2019s Tianqi (002466.SZ) clinched a $4 billion deal to purchase a quarter stake in top Chilean lithium miner SQM (SQMa.SN).\n\nChile is home to half of the world\u2019s lithium reserves, with both SQM and U.S-based Albemarle (ALB.N), the world\u2019s top producer, extracting the coveted metal from bright blue brine pools on the desert\u2019s vast white salt flats.\n\nHowever, a Reuters investigation in July found Chile has struggled to capitalise fully on the tenders, failing to make clear both how much lithium it could provide, as well as how deeply it would be discounted.\n\nChilean producers currently export mostly unrefined lithium, not the higher-value battery parts Chile hopes will someday generate added earnings for its export-oriented economy.\n\nDespite the renewed interest, the administration of centre-right President Sebastian Pinera has tempered expectations for this second round.\n\nFalling lithium prices and Chile\u2019s distance from consumer markets increase costs and make it difficult to entice foreign manufacturers.\n\nPablo Terrazas, head of the Corfo development agency, which oversees the auction, told lawmakers this month that the offered deal was perhaps not as sweet as anticipated.\n\n\u201cIf the battery-making companies are not interested... we can\u2019t obligate them to set up in Chile,\u201d he told lawmakers. \u201cThis can still succeed or fail.\u201d\n\nTerrazas said he hoped to entice companies that make parts for batteries used in tools, electric scooters and storage devices.\n\n\u201cWe started out wanting to sell the most sophisticated batteries to the likes of BMW or Volkswagen. But I think we need to go little by little... and work our way up,\u201d he said.", "description": "Chile is making a renewed push for battery technology investment in return for access to its lithium deposits, piquing interest from China, Japan and Europe as global firms look to tie up supply of the metal vital for the shift to electric vehicles.", "authors": ["Dave Sherwood", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430948816&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G1M9", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
