The value of that management company is likely far in excess of $4.2 M if they are managing $2 B.\u201d\n\nFactCheck.org cited Kaplan estimating that Hunter Biden\u2019s share in the investment company could be valued at around $20 million and up to \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d over the investment lifetime.\n\nHunter Biden\u2019s lawyer said that if Joe Biden won the race for president, he would agree \u201cnot to serve on boards of, or work on behalf of, foreign-owned companies,\u201d but did not mention his current foreign investments in BHR.\n\nPresident Donald Trump continues to target Hunter Biden\u2019s foreign investments as corrupt, questioning Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s knowledge of his son capitalizing on his father\u2019s specific diplomacy with China and Ukraine on behalf of former President Barack Obama\u2019s administration.", "description": "Hunter Biden announced Sunday that he was stepping down from his board position at the BHR Equity Investment Fund Management.", "authors": ["Charlie Spiering"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/Hunter-Biden-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
