I said no. We had a huge row, I went anyway.\n\n\u2018The next morning, David called and we had a row that made the previous day\u2019s row look like a light-hearted disagreement over what to have for lunch: the kind of argument where you come off the phone teary and reeling, where things are said that make you wonder whether the next time you communicate it\u2019ll be through lawyers.\n\n\u2018In fact, the next time I heard from David, he had checked himself into a rehab clinic in Malibu. I was pleased he was getting treatment.\u2019\n\nHe then noted that after David finished his treatment, he accompanied him to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElsewhere in the book, the Your Song singer \u2013 who, along with David, is a dad to sons Zachary and Elijah \u2013 wrote: \u2018I spent 16 years getting f***** up and 29 years getting better.\u2019\n\nWorried about drugs?
