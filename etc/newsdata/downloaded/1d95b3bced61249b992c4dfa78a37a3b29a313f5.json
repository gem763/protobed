Inside Lincoln\u2019s crib was the face of another baby, she said.\n\nCourtesy Maritza Dominguez\n\n\u201cI was trying to figure out what it could possibly be and I couldn\u2019t stop staring it,\u201d Dominguez told \"GMA.\" \u201cI kept thinking maybe I\u2019m making something out of something that\u2019s not there.\u201d\n\nDominguez texted her husband Corey, who was at work at the time, to get his input. He suggested maybe it was a drool pattern that looked strange on the baby monitors.\n\n\u201cWe have a very drooly baby,\u201d Dominguez said. \u201cHe\u2019s like a St. Bernard.\u201d\n\nCourtesy Maritza Dominguez\n\nDominguez went in to try to investigate, but Lincoln had been sick and she didn\u2019t want to wake him.\n\nShe then posted the picture in a mommy Facebook group she was a part of, asking if other people saw the ghost baby too because it was creeping her out.\n\n\u201cSome of the moms were joking that crib might be haunted and asked if I got it secondhand \u2013 which we did,\u201d Dominguez said. \u201cThankfully my husband is rational and was helping me think more clearly.\u201d\n\nDominguez decided that it was probably a stain and went to go to sleep, but said she kept opening her eyes every couple of seconds, waiting the mysterious baby face to move.\n\nCourtesy Maritza Dominguez\n\n\u201cI had the monitor in front of my face all night and the brightness and volume all the way up,\u201d Dominguez said. \u201cEvery time my son moved I\u2019d be freaking out all over again.\u201d\n\nIn the morning Dominguez went to investigate the situation after noticing that her phone was blowing up with notifications on her post from her mommy group.\n\n\u201cA lot of them were joking writing things like, \u2018The ghost baby got her!\u2019\u201d Dominguez said. \u201cThere were so many comments that I couldn\u2019t even read them all.\u201d\n\nShe went up to Lincoln\u2019s room to investigate and that\u2019s when she saw the giant baby sticker on the mattress underneath Lincoln\u2019s sheet. Dominguez said her husband forgot to put the mattress protector on the bed when he changed Lincoln\u2019s sheets, so the face appeared more clearly without the extra layer.\n\nCourtesy Maritza Dominguez\n\n\u201cI should have been relieved, but I was so embarrassed,\u201d Dominguez said. \u201cI was like \u2018I can\u2019t tell the ladies in my mom group this.\u2019 But I felt like I owed it to them since they were with me on it since the beginning.\u201d\n\nDominguez took a quick picture and sent the hilarious update to her mom Facebook group. The comments kept coming and several moms asked her to make the post public so they could share it.\n\nShe did and was amazed by how many people responded. To date, the post has been shared over 300,000 times on Facebook.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t even believe the response and couldn\u2019t have imaged that it would spread so far beyond my friends,\u201d Dominguez said.\n\nShe said she thinks her \u201clighthearted, silly parenting story\u201d resonates with a lot of parents.\n\nAnother thing that may resonate with a lot of parents?\n\n\u201cIt was my husband\u2019s fault,\u201d Dominguez joked. \u201cI still blame my husband.\u201d", "description": "An Illinois mom was given quite the fright when she thought she saw a \u201cbaby ghost\u201d in her son\u2019s crib, but it was all laughs when she discovered what the paranormal activi", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/ghost-baby-ht-aa-191023_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
