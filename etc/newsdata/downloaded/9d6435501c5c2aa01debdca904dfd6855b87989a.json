General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said more details about the deployment will be determined in the coming days, but it would not involve thousands of US troops.\n\nOther officials said the US deployment would probably be in the hundreds and the defensive equipment heading to the Middle East would probably include Patriot missile batteries and possibly enhanced radars.\n\nThe announcement reflected Trump\u2019s comments earlier in the day when he told reporters that showing restraint \u201cshows far more strength\u201d than launching military strikes and he wanted to avoid an all-out war with Iran, which has denied responsibility for the attack.\n\nInstead, he laid out new sanctions on the Iranian central bank.\n\n\u201cI think the strong person\u2019s approach and the thing that does show strength would be showing a little bit of restraint,\u201d Trump told reporters during a meeting with the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison. \u201cMuch easier to do it the other way, and Iran knows that if they misbehave, they are on borrowed time.\u201d\n\nUS dials back Iran rhetoric and seeks 'peaceful resolution' over Saudi attack Read more\n\nDunford told reporters the extra equipment and troops would give Saudi Arabia a better chance of defending against unconventional aerial attacks.\n\n\u201cNo single system is going to be able to defend against a threat like that,\u201d he said, \u201cbut a layered system of defensive capabilities would mitigate the risk of swarms of drones or other attacks that may come from Iran.\u201d\n\nThe US has not provided any hard evidence that Iran was responsible for the attacks, while insisting the investigation continues, but Esper on Friday said the drones and cruise missiles used in the attack were produced by Iran.\n\n\u201cThe attack on 14 September against Saudi Arabian oil facilities represents a dramatic escalation of Iranian aggression,\u201d Esper said, adding that the US has thus far shown \u201cgreat restraint\u201d.\n\nIran has denied involvement and warned the US that any attack will spark an \u201call-out war\u201d with immediate retaliation from Tehran.\n\nIn deciding against an immediate US strike, Trump for the second time in recent months pulled back from a major military action against Iran that many Pentagon and other advisers fear could trigger a new Middle East war. In June, after Iran shot down an American surveillance drone, Trump initially endorsed a retaliatory military strike then abruptly called it off because he said it would have killed dozens of Iranians.\n\nOn Friday, he left the door open a bit for a later military response, saying people thought he\u2019d attack Iran \u201cwithin two seconds\u201d, but he has \u201cplenty of time\u201d.", "description": "Trump has for now decided not to authorize an immediate military strike on Iran in response to attack", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/177c07009a8cc6272663f0de6ea350b480e71a47/0_11_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7fa924c5a34787184b4412bfeb549d44", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
