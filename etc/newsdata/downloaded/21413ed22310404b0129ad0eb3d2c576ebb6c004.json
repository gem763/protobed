Gavin Newsom Signs Vaccine Bill Restricting Medical Exemptions", "language": "en", "text": "Although immunization rates for children entering kindergarten in California are high \u2015 currently about 95% statewide, according to data from the California Department of Public Health \u2015 the rate of medical exemptions has risen in recent years, and public health officials are on high alert.\n\nThe bill\u2019s passage comes amid the worst measles outbreak in the country in decades, with over 1,240 cases of the highly-contagious disease confirmed this year across 30 states, according to the CDC. California has confirmed at least 67 measles cases this year.\n\nThe anti-vaccine movement has grown in recent years, often fueled by misconceptions about the safety of immunizations. One popular conspiracy theory about a supposed link between the MMR vaccine and childhood autism stems from a debunked 1998 study and has been exhaustively proven false in numerous medical studies.", "description": "The new law is expected to make it more difficult for parents to opt their children out of immunizations.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d6814522500003200744d08.jpeg?cache=x1uumzh7m2&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
