She Did Not,\u201d focused on Kavanaugh accuser Deborah Ramirez. The article was built around an investigation into an incident from her first year at Yale University: \u201cShe and some classmates had been drinking heavily when, she says, a freshman named Brett Kavanaugh pulled down his pants and thrust his penis at her, prompting her to swat it away and inadvertently touch it.\u201c\n\nTrump, who nominated Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in July 2018 and fought hard for his confirmation by the Senate, tweeted: \u201cThe lies being told about him are unbelievable. False Accusations without recrimination. When does it stop? They are trying to influence his opinions. Can\u2019t let that happen!\u201c\n\nHe added: \u201cHe is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY. Such lies about him. They want to scare him into turning Liberal!\u201c\n\nRamirez had gone public with her allegations about Kavanaugh\u2019s behavior at college during his confirmation hearings, following in the footsteps of Christine Blasey Ford, who recounted a sexual assault from her high school days. Kavanaugh was confirmed in a 50-48 vote.\n\n", "description": "The president added: \u201cThey want to scare him into turning Liberal!\u201c", "authors": ["David Cohen"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/eb/b8/011276ea4f53a8641966453e8e9a/190915-donald-trump-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
