If the game is cancelled, Japan, which leads Scotland by four points in the Pool A standings, will advance to its first quarterfinal and Scotland will miss out.\n\n\"We are in regular dialogue with World Rugby at all levels to work to ensure our fixture against Japan on Sunday can be played as planned. Public safety is the clear priority,\" Scottish Rugby said in a statement.\n\n\"With potential impact on our last Pool A fixture, Scottish Rugby fully expects contingency plans to be put in place to enable Scotland to contest for a place in the quarterfinals on the pitch, and will be flexible to accommodate this.\"\n\nBut the rules state that if a pool game can't be played on its scheduled date, it will be cancelled and logged as a draw with two points each to the teams.\n\nWorld Rugby said: \"Every effort is being made to ensure Sunday's matches will be played as scheduled. A thorough assessment of venues will take place after the typhoon has passed before a final decision is made on Sunday morning.\"\n\nScotland is scheduled to move to its Yokohama hotel on Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, England is leaving Tokyo for Miyazaki on the southern island of Kyushu to avoid Typhoon Hagibis.\n\nThe England-France pool match scheduled for Saturday in Yokohama was cancelled by Rugby World Cup organizers because that is when and where the approaching storm, the most powerful this year, is expected to make landfall.\n\nMiyazaki hosted England's pre-tournament training camp.\n\nIt's also not far from Oita, where England's quarterfinal against Wales or Australia is scheduled next week.\n\n\"We'll have a short camp in Miyazaki and then we're off to Oita,\" Jones said. \"We have an exceptional record in two-week preparations.\"\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2019 The Associated Press.
