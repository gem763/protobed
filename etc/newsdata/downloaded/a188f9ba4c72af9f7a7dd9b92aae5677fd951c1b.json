With that pre-blitz session and then three hours of finding places to work (cafes, libraries, sometimes the attic) \u2013 well, the day is very full. I\u2019m aware that dropping the c-bomb is an incendiary act. One of the aspects of trying to \u201chave it all\u201d as a modern feminist blowhard is that another woman ends up lint-rollering cat hair off your sofa and harshly judging your slapdash method of Q-tip disposal. I hired my first cleaner 10 years ago, when I realised that I was only ever two back-to-back deadlines away from living in Dr Terrible\u2019s House of Horrible. What I needed, I realised, sadly, was a wife. I said this many times to my former husband, although I\u2019m not certain he ever got the gist. I meant that, as I worked harder and harder, there was no 1950s-style, fragrant wife-type magically decrumbing the patch around the toaster, or noticing that the vegetable tray in the fridge had flooded.\n\nWhat I settled for, though it pained me, was a cleaner who could come in and notice these things, and restore life roughly to factory settings. And here I am, a decade later, grateful as hell, stacking everything into piles beforehand and bleaching the toilet bowl myself, and still fearing the key in the door.\n\nA painful attitude to domestic help is, I think, a fundamental aspect of being working class made good. Obviously, many will feel that having a cleaner means I can\u2019t talk about being working class with a straight face. I would argue that due to a childhood full of risible 80s working-class NHS dentistry, I can\u2019t do very much at all with a straight face, especially not eat a Granny Smith apple. But, more pressingly, it\u2019s during my emotional tangles with \u201cstaff\u201d \u2013 cough \u2013 that my true beginnings are writ large.\n\nWhen I was small, my mother worked, among other things, as a cleaner, sloshing a mop over shop floors, with me sitting, sometimes, on the counter. Her female ancestors only made the jump from working on farms in the Cumberland hills to the big city of Carlisle by signing up for a long life of \u201cservice\u201d in posh houses.\n\nAll the same, in the early 1980s, I saw the middle-class life of Ria in the sitcom Butterflies and thought it fantastic: her big house in Cheltenham, a park romance with a man called Leonard and, importantly, her deadpan cleaner Ruby, who loitered omnipresently with a bucket and a tube of BBC prop-department Vim. Ruby, the cleaner, fitted seamlessly into Ria\u2019s world, acting as a home-help, sounding board, mother and marriage-guidance counsellor. Their exchange of cold hard cash for elbow grease appeared seamless.\n\nIn comparison, I hide on cleaning days, lurking in a nearby cafe, fretting that I could have at least pre-loaded the dishwasher; worrying that the Turin shroud face imprints I leave on pillowcases after every spray tan mark me out, in my mother\u2019s words, as \u201ca dirty slut\u201d. Incidentally, this phrase used to mean something quite different up north in the 1970s. Being a slut in 2019 is seen as empowering, because you get to bang constantly, and even march down the road in your thong railing against \u201cshaming\u201d. At one point, however, \u201ca slut\u201d described a woman who didn\u2019t wash her net curtains. A slut was the type who would hide in a cafe and let another woman fold her knickers. It does not feel so good to be this type of slut.\n\nMy mother found my jump to hiring my own cleaner semi-outrageous. Brass-necked, even. This was not the natural order. Neither will she hear of help herself, although she is in her 80s. Because what would people say? She softened a bit to my \u201cLondon life\u201d eventually. If I was determined to have a career \u2013 and I don\u2019t make life easy for myself, do I? \u2013 at least someone would, once a week, chuck out an old vase of flowers and pour the putrid water down the sink. Someone might defuzz my blinds and sort my teaspoons. Someone could do the stuff she would do, had I not fled the north.\n\nMy cleaner\u2019s mother, who doesn\u2019t live in London, probably worries about who is looking after her so far away. Maybe she wonders who is doing her mopping, if she is so busy doing mine. All of the above things flood my mind every Wednesday as I flee the sound of my own vacuum cleaner. My kitchen surfaces have never been less smeary, but my conscience remains besmirched.", "description": "My mother found my jump to hiring help outrageous.
