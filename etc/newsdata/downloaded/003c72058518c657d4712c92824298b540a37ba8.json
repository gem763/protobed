Until now visitor visas were issued for specific reasons such as for Muslim religious pilgrimages, to visit family or for business.\n\nThe visa information website indicated an easing of strict dress codes for visiting women, requiring shoulders and knees to be covered but not demanding they wear the full-body abaya.\n\n\u201cFrom this historic place and during this special day - Tourism Day - we are pleased to announce that we will receive tourists from several places of the world. We are a people of hospitality,\u201d said Ahmed Al-Khateeb, chairman of the Saudi Commission for Tourism and Heritage, speaking from in Ad-Diriyah, which houses a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\nSaudi Arabia saw profound change last year as part of reforms by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, including opening the first movie theater and lifting the world\u2019s only ban on women driving.\n\nBut there is a hard limit to the reforms, as revealed by last year\u2019s killing of Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey by Saudi agents and the reported torture of several detained women\u2019s rights activists.\n\nFor the launch of its new visa, the country was highlighting five UNESCO World Heritage sites, contemporary art sites and natural beauties including the Red Sea, desert and mountains.\n\nVisitors from 49 eligible countries will be able to apply for the tourist visas online or on arrival at airport visa kiosks, while those from other countries will have to apply via Saudi consulates or embassies before travel.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Saudi Arabia has announced a new tourist visa scheme, as part of efforts to open up the ultraconservative Muslim kingdom to foreign visitors and diversify its oil-reliant economy.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/28/saudi_tourist_visas_93440_c0-146-3500-2186_s1770x1032.jpg?28e1112a076ec7fecf74d701fc168de288d8a301", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
