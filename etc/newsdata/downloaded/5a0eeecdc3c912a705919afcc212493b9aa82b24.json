When it is presented in a gesture of protest, not as a gracious welcome.\n\nAmerica\u2019s top diplomat, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in Rome. As he and Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte went through the motions of a standard photo opportunity, shaking hands and smiling for the cameras from the press, a woman approached the two men. The woman held a large wedge of Parmesan-Reggiano in her hands. She extended the cheese to Pompeo, who smiled at her and accepted it. The prime minister, however, scowled.\n\n\u201cI have a present for you \u2014 an Italian present. The prime minister knows what I am talking about. This is Parmigiano-Reggiano, and this is what we make best in Italy,\u201d video footage of the event shows Alice Martinelli saying, as Pompeo beams and graciously accepts the pound and a half of authentic Italian cheese. But Conte appears entirely unamused. \u201cMay I ask the lady to step aside, please?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d be grateful if you could also help,\u201d she appears to say back to him. \u201cDon\u2019t you worry, I\u2019m doing my job,\u201d Conte replies. \u201cTake it to Mr. Trump, please, and tell [him] that we make it with our hearts, please,\u201d she calls out to Pompeo, as security agents intervene to escort her offstage.\n\n\ud83e\uddc0Parmesan diplomacy: A woman crashed Pompeo\u2019s photo op with Italian PM Giuseppe Conte to give him a block of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese for Trump. \u201cTake it to Mr. Trump please, and tell him we make it from our heart,\" she said before Conte had her removed pic.twitter.com/rSa8ZmpZzk \u2014 Bloomberg TicToc (@tictoc) October 1, 2019\n\nThe cheese was used as a symbol of the possible tariffs President Trump and his administration may levy on European food products. Tariffs on Italian cheese and wine that may be coming down the road are, naturally, a concern for Italians who will feel the pinch. Martinelli was speaking up for the country\u2019s dairies, apparently. There are 330 Italian dairies.\n\nMartinelli, it should be noted, is a journalist with Italy\u2019s satirical \u201cLe Iene\u201d show. Satire. The show began in 1997 and it is a comedy/satirical show. The show uses sketches and reports to comment on political affairs and consumer issues. Should she be taken seriously over an economic issue? Probably not any more seriously than anyone takes Stephen Colbert in America.\n\nHer bid for international attention didn\u2019t sit well with Prime Minister Conte. As soon as she approached him and Pompeo, his smile turned to a scowl. As soon as Pompeo took the cheese from her, Conte had her escorted away by the security detail. When she instructed Pompeo to deliver the cheese to President Trump and told Conte to do his job, Conte snapped back, \u201cDon\u2019t you worry, I\u2019m doing my job.\u201d He took the cheese from Pompeo and gave it to an aide.\n\nHe grabbed the 30-month-old cheese from Pompeo and handed it off to an aide. \u201cLet me explain, this is the way to prove you\u2019re Italian,\u201d he said, as Pompeo giggled in the background. \u201cLet me do the work of the president of the council. \u2026 You, step outside,\u201d he called after Martinelli in Italian.\n\nProtesters met Pompeo as he arrived to meet with Conte.\n\nAs Pompeo drove up to the presidential palace, he was greeted by members of Italy\u2019s largest agricultural union Coldiretti who held up banners saying \u201cDon\u2019t kill Italian food\u201d and \u201cMr Pompeo, we are friends\u201d. They brandished bottles of olive oil, Parma ham and other Italian specialities under a banner reading \u201cA present for Trump\u201d.\n\nItalian Agriculture Minister Teresa Bellanova noted, \u201cThe Americans import $4.5 billion worth of Italian food products, or 10 percent of our total exports.\u201d\n\nShe told La Stampa newspaper that a hike in tariffs would \u201cseriously endanger jobs, companies and families\u201d across the country, adding that Parmesan and olive oil exports brought in more than $1 billion.\n\nThe U.S. is one of the world\u2019s biggest importers of olive oil. The same is true for prosecco and other wines. If tariffs are levied, Italian cheesemakers think that consumption will fall off in America by 80%-90%. That sounds like an exaggeration to me. Tariffs of up to 100 percent on the value of food products exported to the US are discussed. The tariffs are in reaction to subsidies received by aircraft maker Airbus.\n\nWatch Pompeo\u2019s eyes follow the cheese out of shot. I too would be furious to have parmigiano snatched away from me https://t.co/NhNnX74g49 \u2014 Jessica Phelan (@JessicaLPhelan) October 1, 2019\n\nEDIT: The name Conte was incorrectly referenced in the fourth paragraph and was corrected to Martinelli.", "description": "Tariffs", "authors": ["Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pompeo-israel.png"}
