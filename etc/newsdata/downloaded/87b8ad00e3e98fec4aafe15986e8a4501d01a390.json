Here, Dr Bennet Omalu, a world expert who first identified chronic brain trauma in American footballers, makes an impassioned call for the authorities to outlaw players under 18 heading footballs . . .\n\nA large, heavy object is hurtling towards you \u2014 so what do you do to block it? Use your hands, maybe, or your feet? But why would you use your head?\n\nYet that\u2019s what happens on playing fields up and down this country on a daily basis. Children are encouraged to head footballs \u2014 sometimes weighing up to a couple of pounds.\n\nI am not given to dramatic language but sometimes situations call for it \u2014 and to my mind the need to ban heading footballs among the under 18s, when their fragile brains are not yet fully developed and are most prone to damage, is an urgent situation.\n\nEach time a child guides the ball into the net with their head, it can cause microscopic injuries to the brain. This isn\u2019t idle speculation, it is scientific fact.\n\nEach time a child guides the ball into the net with their head, it can cause microscopic injuries to the brain (stock image)\n\nAs the head hits the ball, the brain, which floats freely around the skull, will be shaken about, potentially causing sub-concussive injury, damage to brain cells that is not severe enough to cause symptoms instantly but which cumulatively, as the heading is repeated, can be devastating.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the brain is a post-mitotic organ \u2014 meaning it doesn\u2019t have any reasonable capacity to regenerate itself.\n\nWhich is why heading the ball could lead to a devastating diagnosis of, say, dementia in years ahead \u2014 and at an earlier age than it might normally strike. My eyes were opened to this risk, when, in 2002 I was assigned to perform an autopsy on the legendary American football player Mike Webster, who had died at 50.\n\nThe cause of death was a heart attack, but as a neuropathologist, I was naturally interested in any changes to the brain.\n\nDuring the autopsy I made an astounding discovery \u2014 finding changes that shouldn\u2019t have been present in the brain of a man of his age.\n\nI found signs of a disease never previously identified in football players \u2014 chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, a neurodegenerative disease caused by repeated head injuries. As such it was the first hard evidence that playing football could cause permanent brain damage.\n\nDepsite findings like this, the Football Association in the UK does not currently believe there is sufficient evidence to remove heading from children\u2019s football, but in the U.S., the authorities take a different view.\n\nIn 2015 the United States Soccer Federation announced a pioneering ban on headers for children aged ten and under, and a limit on the same practice for children aged 11 to 13. It was an admirable safety initiative but in my view it isn\u2019t enough.\n\nThe ban should extend to 18, when the brain becomes fully developed and therefore more able to withstand damage.\n\nIn 2015 the United States Soccer Federation announced a pioneering ban on headers for children aged ten and under, and a limit on the same practice for children aged 11 to 13 (stock image)\n\nI also believe younger children should play a modified type of football where there is less contact and the football is bigger and lighter, so reducing the amount of impact when it hits them.\n\nAs for adults \u2014 well, I can\u2019t tell anyone what to do. But it is my duty as a physician to highlight the inherent risk.\n\nThe more you hit your head, the greater the chance you will damage your brain whatever age you are.\n\nSome will argue that if we remove heading it will spoil football as a sport. I disagree. It\u2019s just about adapting techniques to ensure safety without discouraging participation.\n\nIn 1976, The Lancet journal published an editorial saying it was foolhardy for mankind to intentionally cause brain damage in sport when it could be avoidable. Of course, accidents happen. But to intentionally and foolishly make people suffer brain damage makes no sense at all.\n\nFootball, or soccer as we call it in the U.S., is the biggest sport in the world and the UK is the pace-setter. We need to embrace the truth no matter how inconvenient.\n\nNo one wants to ban sport. This is about managing the risk. Heading simply shouldn\u2019t have a place in soccer.\n\nDr Omalu is an associate clinical professor of medical pathology at the University of California.\n\nINTERVIEW: ANGELA EPSTEIN", "description": "DR BENNET OMALU: A large, heavy object is hurtling towards you - so what do you do to block it?
