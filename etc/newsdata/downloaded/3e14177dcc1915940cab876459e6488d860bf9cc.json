Photo: Paramount Pictures\n\nThis Month\u2019s Highlights\n\nElection\n\nAlexander Payne\u2019s 1999 satire is just as biting and brilliant as it was two decades ago. Anchored by an excellent performance from Reese Witherspoon (arguably her best), Payne\u2019s adaptation of the Tom Perrotta novel uses a contentious high-school election to expose the thin line that separates adults from teenagers when it comes to maturity and to interrogate what we consider good behavior. It\u2019s hysterical, smart, and insightful in ways we don\u2019t see that often in modern cinema.\n\nFull List of What\u2019s New on Amazon Prime \u2014 September 2019\n\nNoteworthy titles in bold.\n\nAvailable September 3\n\nVictori\ufeffa, season three\n\nAvailable September 13\n\nEl Coraz\u00f3n de Sergio Ramos (Amazon Original series)\n\n\ufeffUndone (Amazon Original series)\n\nAvailable September 24\n\nAmerican Horror Story: Apocalypse\n\nAvailable September 27\n\nRango (2011)\n\nTransparent Musicale Finale (Amazon Original series)\n\nAvailable September 30\n\nA Night at the Roxbury (1998)\n\nAir Force One (1997)\n\nBe Cool (2005)\n\nBehave Yourself (1951)\n\nBig Top Pee-wee (1988)\n\nBolden (2019)\n\nBulldog Courage (1935)\n\nBuried Alive (1990)\n\nChained for Life (1952)\n\nChi to suna no kett\u00f4 / Duel of Blood and Sand (1963)\n\nCloverfield (2008)\n\nCowboy and the Senorita (1944)\n\nDarkness Falls (2003)\n\nDaughter of the Tong (1939)\n\nDays of Thunder (1990)\n\nDead Heat (1988)\n\nDiana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel (2011)\n\nDreamcatcher (2003)\n\nDreaming Out Loud (1940)\n\nElection (1999)\n\nEvent Horizon (1997)\n\nFace/Off (1997)\n\nForces of Nature (1999)\n\nGet Shorty (1995)\n\nGhost Town (2008)\n\nGhost World (2001)\n\nGothika (2003)\n\nHarlem Nights (1989)\n\nHearts in Bondage (1936)\n\nHere\u2019s Flash Casey (1938)\n\nHi De Ho (1947)\n\nHigh Noon (1952)\n\nHollywood My Home Town (1965)\n\nHunting (2015)\n\nInsomnia (2002)\n\nKalifornia (1993)\n\nKicking and Screaming (1995)\n\nLegally Blonde (2001)\n\nMad Max 2: The Road Warrior (1981)\n\nMad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985)\n\nMatriarch (2018)\n\nMousehunt (1997)\n\nMuch Ado About Nothing (2012)\n\nNaked Gun 33 1/3: The Final Insult (1994)\n\nNo Way Out (1987)\n\nPermanent Midnight (1998)\n\nPlatoon (1986)\n\nPlatoon 4K (1986)\n\nPlay It Again, Sam (1972)\n\nProject Nim (2011)\n\nRegression (2015)\n\nSaturday Night Fever (1977)\n\nSetup (2011)\n\nStargate (1994)\n\nTales From the Darkside: The Movie (1990)\n\nThe Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension (1990)\n\nThe Cotton Club (1984)\n\nThe Deadly Companions (1961)\n\nThe Klansman (1974)\n\nThe Life of David Gale (2003)\n\nThe Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear (1991)\n\nThe Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!
