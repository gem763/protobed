Trump has brought the #1 terrorist leader to justice.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut eight years ago, Trump was highly critical of what he described as President Barack Obama\u2019s undeserved \u201cbragging\u201d about the killing of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Trump spent months insisting that Obama did not deserve credit for the May 2011 raid that ended with bin Laden\u2019s death.\n\nAD\n\nIn a December 2011 CNN interview about the 2012 presidential candidates, Trump repeatedly rejected Wolf Blitzer\u2019s statement crediting Obama for bin Laden\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cBut anybody sitting in that office, Wolf, would have \u2014 I keep hearing about, oh, bin Laden, the military did an incredible job and they called and they said, we have him. And he said, go get him,\u201d Trump said, according to a transcript of the conversation. \u201cWhat\u2019s he going to say, don\u2019t get him? And he gets all this credit? It\u2019s a lot of crap.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump returned to that grievance multiple times. In April 2012, he tweeted an article that conservative commentator Ben Shapiro wrote for Breitbart, which claimed that Adm. William McRaven \u2014 not Obama \u2014 was \u201cthe hero here.\u201d Above a link to the story, Trump wrote that Obama merely \u201cgave vague directions.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAdmiral McRaven had full operational control of the Bin Laden mission http://t.co/ccoFmRm9 @BarackObama gave vague directions. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 27, 2012\n\nDays later, Trump called in to CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box\u201d to talk about Rupert Murdoch, the White House correspondents\u2019 dinner, his disdain for wind farms \u2014 and Obama\u2019s \u201cuse\u201d of bin Laden\u2019s death in his reelection campaign. Trump said the then-president had to \u201cuse whatever he can use,\u201d adding that he \u201ccan\u2019t use the economy.\u201d\n\nTrump suggested that the Obama administration should have known of bin Laden\u2019s whereabouts \u201cyears before,\u201d then added that anyone in Obama\u2019s position would have been able to do what he did.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAny president sitting there when the generals come in and say we have him, who\u2019s going to say, oh, let\u2019s leave him alone?\u201d Trump asked. \u201cNo person that I know of.\u201d\n\nIn August 2012, Trump tweeted more criticism of Obama\u2019s handling of the bin Laden matter, this time suggesting that he was using the al-Qaeda leader\u2019s death for his own benefit.\n\nAD\n\nMilitary reps have attacked @BarackObama over Bin Laden leaks--they believe he's just using this for his benefit. Not a big surprise... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 16, 2012\n\nTrump again insisted in October that Obama was not deserving of credit on that front, writing in a tweet that the praise should instead go to \u201cour brave military and intelligence officers.\u201d\n\nObama deserves much less credit for the killing of Bin Laden. The praise goes to our brave military and intelligence officers. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2012\n\nAs Obama debated Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney later in the month, Trump opined on Twitter that the sitting president was \u201can easy target on foreign policy.\u201d He also suggested that Obama would start \u201cbragging about Bin Laden.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nObama is an easy target on foreign policy.@MittRomney has many openings to attack, especially when Obama starts bragging about Bin Laden. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2012\n\nIn a second tweet posted 34 minutes later, he said that all Obama had done with regard to the raid was \u201csay O.K.,\u201d once again asserting that the Navy SEALs who carried it out were the ones deserving of credit.\n\nWhy don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden? They don't seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit. All he did is say O.K. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2012\n\nTrump was seemingly fixated on the topic that night. He returned to it a third time a few hours later, demanding that people \u201cstop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nStop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden. #debate \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2012\n\nFour more tweets about Obama\u2019s allegedly undeserved credit for the raid followed over the next morning and afternoon. Trump said Obama \u201cworks hard to take all the credit away\u201d from the military and Navy SEALs. He also claimed \u2014 incorrectly \u2014 that the debate was the first time that Obama had used the term \u201cwe\u201d instead of \u201cI\u201d in describing the terrorist leader\u2019s killing.\n\nAD\n\nWhen the military informed Obama that they had Bin Laden, is there anyone with a brain that would not have said \"Ok, go get him\"? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2012\n\nThe military and Navy Seals should be given more credit for Bin Laden's death, not Obama, who works hard to take (cont) http://t.co/Awn3F7tS \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2012\n\nBarack Obama said absolutely not 3 times before he agreed to go after Bin Laden--- now he wants all of the credit! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2012\n\nLast night was the first time Obama said \"we\" instead of \"I\" in respect to Bin Laden's killing. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2012\n\nDuring his Sunday announcement about Baghdadi, Trump apparently still had the killing of bin Laden on his mind. He inaccurately claimed \u2014 not for the first time \u2014 that he had warned before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that the al-Qaeda leader was plotting terrorist strikes. Trump also suggested that Baghdadi\u2019s death was more significant than bin Laden\u2019s.\n\n\u201cThis is the biggest there is. This is the worst ever,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOsama bin Laden was very big, but Osama bin Laden became big with the World Trade Center. This is a man who built a whole, as he would like to call it, a country, a caliphate, and was trying to do it again.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Trump touted his role in the apparent death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
