But the level of stress may vary based on the airline you choose.\n\nA new report from The Points Guy (TPG) ranks the best and worst domestic airlines for families in 2019. According to TPG\u2019s findings, JetBlue Airways is the most family-friendly airline, overtaking last year\u2019s winner, Southwest Airlines. Allegiant Air took the last-place spot.\n\nThe Best Airlines for Families\n\nJetBlue Airways Southwest Airlines Hawaiian Airlines Alaska Airlines Delta Air Lines United Airlines American Airlines Frontier Spirit Allegiant Air\n\n\u201cFamilies have slightly different priorities when they travel compared to the average traveler,\u201d TPG\u2019s director of travel, Summer Hull, told HuffPost. Hull noted that these rankings differ from the website\u2019s general best airlines rankings because the criteria is not the same. The report draws data from government statistics, published airline policies and procedures, TPG\u2019s team research and other sources.\n\n\u201cWe emphasized factors that are important to families \u2015 how easy the airline makes it to get seats together in advance without having to pay extra, availability of built-in entertainment, kid-friendly snack and meal offerings and early boarding procedures, like \u2018Do families get to board early?\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nAccording to the report, JetBlue reigned supreme because of its seat options, free entertainment and Wi-Fi, snack basket and ability for families to pool miles together at no extra charge.\n\nThe airline ranked down at No. 7 out of 10 in the overall airline study, however. \u201cTheir on-time arrival stats aren\u2019t great. They could do better there.\u201d said Hull.\n\nJose Luis Pelaez Inc via Getty Images This is the second year TPG has ranked airlines in terms of family-friendliness.\n\nSouthwest dropped to second place in part because it became harder to book travel far in advance, which many families prefer to do for their vacations.\n\nThis is the second year TPG has released family-friendly rankings. In addition to JetBlue\u2019s ascent, Hawaiian and Alaska also rose, pushing Delta down to No. 5. The bottom five airlines remain unchanged.\n\nAlthough the rankings can help families pick a carrier for their next trip, Hull believes the report serves other purposes by breaking down the family-friendly features of each airline.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t always have a choice of carrier. Sometimes price or route will make that choice for you,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope it helps families know what to expect for different airlines they\u2019re not familiar with. And it can prepare them for some things the airline may make easier and help them figure out things they may have to prepare for on their own because the airline won\u2019t be helpful.\u201d\n\nHull also hopes the report can act as a wish list for airlines to see the ways they may make flying better for families. \u201cFor example, American Airlines lags when it comes to offering early boarding for families with young children, but it wouldn\u2019t cost them that much to do what other airlines do and board families early in the process,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI just hope our study is a chance for an airline to get some non-biased feedback,\u201d she added. \u201cHere are some actionable changes we\u2019d love to see you make.\u201d", "description": "The Points Guy released its annual rankings based on family-friendly features.", "authors": ["Culture", "Amp", "Parenting Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5da638802100004c0fad0f83.jpeg?cache=ymhKOc5xcJ&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
