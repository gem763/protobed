It was quite logical that after Islamic State (IS) emerged in Iraq and Syria in 2014 that the US would take on the mission of helping to destroy Islamic State in Iraq.\n\nWashington felt guilty having removed all combat troops from Iraq before it was really stabilised and Islamic State had brutally murdered American journalists. But rather than do it all ourselves, we partnered with the Iraqi army and amplified its power and ground forces with our advisers and air power.\n\nThat approach led not only to the defeat of IS in Iraq, it also produced some unanticipated positive effects in Iraqi politics. The IS war became a kind of national war of liberation for Iraqis that brought moderate Iraqi Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds closer together \u2014 and gave them dignity that the US invasion of Iraq had unintentionally stolen. And this paved the way for more stable and sustainable power-sharing among Sunnis, Kurds and Shiites in Iraq.\n\nFrail democracy\n\nIraq today remains a very frail democracy \u2014 with huge challenges in employment, energy, corruption and governing. But \"Iraq today is a different country\", noted Linda Robinson in a recent essay in Foreign Affairs titled Winning the Peace in Iraq: Don't Give Up on Baghdad's Fragile Democracy.\n\n\"Few Americans understand the remarkable success\" that has been achieved in bringing Iraq back from the depth of the IS war.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis doesn't mean that the original Iraq invasion was worth it or that we would do it again. But it does mean we found the right way to help Iraqis help themselves. It is now up to them to make the most of it.\n\nUnfortunately, we kept the war on Islamic State on autopilot. Once Iraq was liberated we tried to produce the same result in Syria using Syrian Kurdish fighters. We failed to make some important distinctions, though. Islamic State in Syria was operating in a completely different context than in Iraq.\n\nIn Iraq, IS was the enemy of multisectarian democracy. In Syria, IS was the enemy of multisectarian democracy, and so were Russia, Shiite Iran, Shiite Hezbollah and the Shiite-Alawite Bashar Assad regime. And they and IS all deserved one another.\n\n\"If we defeat territorial ISIS in Syria now,\" I wrote in 2017, \"we will only reduce the pressure on Assad, Iran, Russia and Hezbollah and enable them to devote all their resources to crushing the last moderate rebels in Idlib, not sharing power with them.\" And that's basically what happened.\n\n\"ISIS was always two problems \u2014 Syria and Iraq \u2014 not one problem, and we should have treated them differently,\" explained John Arquilla, a professor of strategy at the US Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey. \"In Iraq, ISIS had to be defeated, because once we broke Saddam's regime, Iraq would either emerge as a liberal counterweight to Iran\" \u2014 one where power was stably shared among Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds \u2014 \"or Iraq would become an Iranian puppet.\"\n\nReflexive not reflective\n\nIn Syria, though, Arquilla added, \"we could have protected the Kurds\" and forced the Russians, Iranians, Hezbollah and Assad to have to keep ISIS bottled up there. But we were reflexive in just continuing the fight with ISIS into Syria, and not reflective.\n\nIn taking responsibility with the Kurds for defeating Islamic State in Syria, we relieved Russia, Iran, Hezbollah and Assad of a huge burden, enabling them to crush the regime's domestic rivals. And what's really crazy is that \u2014 we did it free! We didn't even demand autonomy for our Syrian Kurdish allies or power-sharing with moderate Sunni Syrian rebels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI feel terrible for the Kurds, but at least America might get the last laugh on Putin. Trump let Putin win Syria \u2014 and the indefinite task of propping up Assad's genocidal regime and managing Iran's attempts to use Syria as a platform to attack Israel. What's second prize?\n\nBut even if you argue that walking away from the Kurds in Syria was the right, cold-blooded, strategic thing to do, how a president does things matters. By just pulling out of Syria without advance planning or co-ordination with our allies \u2014 and dumping the Syrian Kurds after they sacrificed 11,000 men and women in the fight against IS \u2014 we sent a message to every American ally: \"You'd better start making plans to take care of yourselves, because if Russia, China or Iran decides to come after you or bully you, America does not have your back \u2014 unless you've paid cash in advance.\"\n\nWatch out. Over time, that will not make for a more stable world or a cheaper US foreign policy.\n\nWhat makes America unique as a global power is that we have allies who share our interests and values \u2014 and amplify our power at a low cost to us \u2014 while Russia and China have only client states, like Syria, and customers.\n\n\"When we suddenly withdraw our support for an ally in one place \u2014 with no warning \u2014 we call into question our credibility everywhere,\" argued Michael Mandelbaum, author of the book The Rise and Fall of Peace on Earth.\n\nThat is not an argument for sustaining bad wars forever, he added, like Vietnam. But it is an argument for ending them in ways that don't unnerve your allies: \"If the Germans and Japanese conclude that America's security guarantees are no longer valid, they will each get nuclear weapons \u2014 which we don't want and they don't want.\"\n\nFinally, almost everyone now understands (I certainly do) that we don't have the time, patience, energy or know-how to create democracy in the Middle East. But what we can do and should do is amplify decency wherever we see it in hopes that the islands of decency there might one day connect up and flower into democracy.\n\nFor instance, Iraqi Kurdistan and the Syrian Kurdish regions, while they have plenty of corruption and tribalism, are nevertheless islands of decency where women tend to be more empowered, Islam is practised in more moderate forms and Western liberal education is promoted in American-style universities.\n\nIn just walking away from the Syrian Kurds, Trump has weakened their island of decency, rather than amplified it.\n\nAmerica is better than that, even if our current president is not.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw US forces from Syria without any planning or advance warning for its allies sets a dangerous precedent.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1947%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_32/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a7d43ebd96aa82614ea2e2128e4c8294bd3defd5", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
