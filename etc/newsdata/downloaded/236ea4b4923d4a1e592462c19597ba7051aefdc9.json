A river is a sleek, writhing being, and even the verbs we use to describe it evoke animation. A river runs through it. A river climbs its banks. A river empties itself into the sea.\n\nRivers and creeks run through the American South as bountifully as veins and arteries run through the human body, and are just as necessary for life. For the peoples native to this part of the world, these rivers were a source of food, water and transport, and almost all the early white settlements in the South were founded next to rivers, too, and for the same reasons. The rich soil of a river floodplain is ideal for planting, and in times of drought, the river is the farmer\u2019s savior. For enslaved people, and later for the tenant farmers who were effectively enslaved, access to a river could mean the difference between living and starving: Anyone who could catch a fish would not go hungry.\n\nThe great river of my own life is the Tennessee, which separates the place where I live from the place where I grew up. The river is more than 650 miles long, and its watershed is the fifth-largest in the nation, encompassing parts of six bordering states as well as Tennessee. Crossing the Tennessee River in northern Alabama means I am heading home, no matter which direction I\u2019m driving.\n\nThe last three months have been an uncommon season of travels for me, and this river has often been my companion. I have seen it from the sky on the way to St. Louis and again on the way to Minneapolis. I have driven alongside it in Chattanooga and Knoxville. I have crossed it in Alabama and crossed it again, without seeing it all, while driving white-knuckled through the remnants of Hurricane Barry in west Tennessee.", "description": "The Tennessee River is one of the most ecologically diverse rivers in the world.
