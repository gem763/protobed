(Scott Morgan/Reuters)\n\nThe Martin Center likes to highlight instances where leftist administrators have become drunk on power and abuse it to suit their own desires. That\u2019s not just a leftist failing, however. As we read in today\u2019s Martin Center article by Reason writer Christian Barnard, Liberty University shows that conservatives are just as prone to this human weakness as leftists are.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarnard notes that Jerry Falwell Sr. had a rather grand vision for his university, but following his death and his son\u2019s succession to power, that abuse of power has set in. Barnard writes, \u201cCritics argue that Falwell has created a culture of fear where people are unable to speak out. They point to examples such as how faculty outside of the law school cannot obtain tenure and the routine use of non-disclosure agreements that stop current and former staff and board members from discussing sensitive matters around Falwell\u2019s leadership.\u201d\n\nTrue, Falwell Jr. has substantially increased the university\u2019s budget, but apparently some of that money has gone into the pockets of cronies.\n\nCriticism is not tolerated and campus groups that don\u2019t adhere to \u201cMoral Majority\u201d precepts find themselves kicked out. Shades of your typical \u201cprogressive\u201d university administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBarnard concludes, \u201cThere are many factors coming together to make Liberty\u2019s governance problems unique. The distinct religious and political vision, the influence over the community in which it resides and the leadership style of the man at the helm all combine to form a distinct challenge. If the university is going to change course and live up to its own standards, the campus dissenters need to make a bold move and speak truth to power.\u201d", "description": "A look at Liberty University.", "authors": ["George Leef", "Ilya Shapiro", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Kevin D.
