The board said Huffman was \"released from the custody of the BOP on October 25, 2019,\" citing a provision that allows certain inmates to be released early.\n\nHuffman, 56, had reported to the federal prison in Dublin, California on Tuesday, October 15. She also received one year of probation, 250 hours of community service and a $30,000 fine.\n\nThe popular television actress has admitted to paying $15,000 in an effort to boost her eldest daughter's SAT score. In 2017, she paid the $15,000 to William Singer, an admissions consultant who allegedly bribed a test proctor to make corrections on her daughter's SAT. Her daughter received a score of 1420, approximately 400 points over her PSAT score from the year prior, according to a federal indictment.\n\nHuffman pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy and fraud in May.\n\nBefore being sentenced last month, Huffman tearfully apologized to U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani, saying she was \"deeply sorry\" for her actions. She also apologized directly to her daughter, Sophia.\n\n\"I can only say I'm so sorry, Sophia. I was frightened and stupid. I now see all the things I knew was wrong. I realize now that love and truth must go hand in hand. I take full responsibility for my actions,\" she said.", "description": "The popular actress was sentenced after admitting to paying $15,000 in an effort to boost her eldest daughter's SAT score", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/13/7b64bec1-c415-4d68-a912-d9a7b4000f34/thumbnail/1200x630/ccd9a287f09f6096d0b748e77e39f1bc/cbsn-fusion-felicity-huffman-to-be-sentenced-in-college-admissions-scandal-thumbnail-343883-640x360.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
