It ended on Saturday, October 26.\n\nAlthough GM was unable to build any cars at American factories during the strike, it had built up an inventory of vehicles ahead of the walkout to give its dealers the supply of cars and trucks they needed to keep selling during the strike.\n\nBut GM still lost money because factories in the United States, as well as some in Canada and Mexico, were idled during the walkout. The strike directly affected 31 GM factories and 21 other facilities, spread across nine states, mostly in the center of the country.\n\nThe strike's cost in the final two weeks of the third quarter came to just under $750 million. GM will account for the rest of the loss this quarter, but it estimates the total loss will come to about $2 per share, the company said Tuesday.\n\nRead More", "description": "The six-week strike at General Motors will end up costing the automaker about $2.9 billion, the company said Tuesday.", "authors": ["Chris Isidore", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191025072611-01-gm-strike-1023-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
