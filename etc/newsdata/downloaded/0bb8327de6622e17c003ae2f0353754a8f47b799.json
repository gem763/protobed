The company beat its 4% organic-sales growth target for the fiscal year by a full percentage point.\n\nWhat\u2019s fueling these share price gains is the company\u2019s success in its turnaround strategy to cope with changing consumer needs and smaller competitors. The demand for P&G shares also rose this year as investors shifted their funds to stocks that provide safety in turbulent economic times.\n\nUnder Chief Executive Officer David Taylor, Cincinnati-based P&G has cut its roster of brands from 175 to 65, focusing on the 10 product categories where the margin is highest. During the course of that process the company has also eliminated 34,000 jobs through a combination of brand sales and buyouts, as well as plant closures\u2014slashing more than $10 billion in costs.\n\nVulnerable to Sell-Off?\n\nFrom a big consumer staple giant like P&G it wouldn\u2019t be fair to expect a blow-out quarter every time, and the risk of underperformance makes its stock vulnerable to some level of sell-off on any negative earnings surprise.\n\nAnother factor that could take some of the steam out of P&G shares is that, because of its defensive nature, it attracted a lot of cash this year as fear of a global recession grew amid the U.S.-China trade war. Once that dispute settles, or the risks to growth recede, investors might again shift their funds to riskier assets, hurting P&G stock.\n\nThat being said, we still find P&G a great long-term investment for income-seeking investors, given the company\u2019s successful response to dwindling consumer brand loyalty. For example, the beauty segment saw organic sales rise 8% on strong results from its SK-II and Olay skin care brands.\n\nThe other reason to be optimistic about P&G\u2019s next fiscal year outlook is that consumers are willing to pay more for the company\u2019s products. P&G started implementing phased price increases last summer after failing to revive growth by doing the opposite. The shift in pricing strategy will be completed by February, which could boost prices between 4%-10% on products including its Pampers, Bounty, Charmin and Puffs brands.\n\nBottom Line\n\nP&G stock remains our favorite pick for income-seeking investors. It's one of the largest dividend payers in the U.S. \u2014 distributing $2.98 per share annual dividend for a yield of 2.6% \u2014 and a track-record that's hard to match. The maker of Pampers diapers has hiked its payout for 62 consecutive years.\n\nNow that growth is back on track, investors should expect more hefty dividend hikes and we see little reason to abandon this consumer powerhouse, even if its stock goes through some weakness.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Investing.com (Haris Anwar/Investing.com) covering: S&P 500, Procter & Gamble Company.
