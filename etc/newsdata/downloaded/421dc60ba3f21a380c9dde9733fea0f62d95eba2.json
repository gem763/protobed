I don't do more than three weeks because I start losing my head.'\n\nHowever Vicky said she is lucky that Jonny, who starred in UK version of Shameless and appeared with her in This Is England '90, understands her hectic schedule.\n\nCosy: Vicky said she doesn't spend more than three weeks away from her fianc\u00e9 Jonny Owen, pictured at the Loyalty & Love Rankin exhibition in London on Wednesday, while filming\n\nShe added: 'Jonny is in the industry so he understands.

I came off the phone and I just knew. I absolutely know.'\n\nVicky went on: 'We literally lived together from a week of meeting. We have basically stayed together from that time until now. We've never lived apart. Seven years in March. I am not sure about fate but I couldn't see my life without him.\n\n'I've never loved anyone more than I've loved Jonny. It sounds cheesy but I love him more and more every day. Things get better and better. Seven years with someone - I feel really lucky. I've had relationships where I didn't have that.'\n\nThe couple worked together on This Is England '90, and Vicky said that the series is still relevant today.\n\nShe said: 'People still contact me on social media and come up to me in the street, it\u2019s a timeless piece.\n\nHit show: Vicky and Martin, pictured, both star in the show and a sixth series is in the works\n\n'It\u2019s called This is England, not this was. Abuse, race and all the issues in it are still here they haven\u2019t changed. And now Lol\u2019s style is bang on trend.'\n\nDespite the long hours and work away from home, Vicky said she is determined to keep working in the 'fickle industry'.\n\nShe said: 'I don't know when this will end, my career. I wait until the contract lands in my hand then it's real.\n\n'I've had so much rejection and been so close. They say they love you, they really want you and I think, that means they don't. It can be a fickle business.'", "description": "Vicky McClure, 36, (main) revealed that while filming the hit police drama in Belfast she ran into Adrian Dunbar (together inset), who plays Ted Hastings, and he told her she looked 'green'.", "authors": ["Bryony Jewell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/20/19312796-0-image-a-70_1570218105632.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
