I am doing everything to have a deal because I don't like the idea of a no-deal because I think this would have catastrophic consequences for at least one year,\" Juncker said in an interview segment released Thursday. \"We are prepared for no deal, and I hope Britain is prepared as well \u2014 but I'm not so sure.\"\n\nAsked if he had received proposals from the British government for doing away with the Irish backstop, Juncker said they had arrived but he hadn't had an opportunity to read them.\n\nThe Commission president said he asked Johnson \"to make concrete proposals as far as so-called alternative arrangements are concerned, allowing us and Britain to achieve the main objectives of the backstop. I don't have an emotional relationship to the backstop. If the results are there, I don't care about it.\"\n\nAsked if that meant that the backstop could be removed, he said: \"If the objectives are met \u2014 all of them \u2014 then we don't need the backstop. It was a guarantee, not an aim by itself.\"\n\nJuncker also said he thinks \"Brexit will happen.\"\n\nThe full interview with Juncker will air on Sunday.", "description": "Commission chief says \u2018if the objectives are met \u2014 all of them \u2014 then we don\u2019t need the backstop.\u2019", "authors": ["Paul Dallison"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1169020417-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
