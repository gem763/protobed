Oliver Laughland reports from the rubble of Grand Bahama\n\nAs Erica Roberts clung to a tall mango tree, the winds and sea water churned up by Hurricane Dorian pounding her face, a single thought ran through her head: \u201cI will not die like this.\u201d\n\n'I thought no one was coming to rescue us': Abaco Islanders flee Dorian's destruction Read more\n\nHer home, in the small town of High Rock on the eastern side of Grand Bahama, had been swept away. Her 24-year-old daughter Natori survived too, clinging to branches beside her.\n\nRoberts\u2019 face and arms still bore dry, bloody cuts. The pair eventually lost their grip, she said, but they were swept close to a home that still stood. They got inside.\n\n\u201cBy the grace of God, we made it,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are survivors.\u201d\n\nThe 41-year-old had not heard from seven close family members: two sons, a sister, two nephews, cousins, uncles. All were still missing. In a community of about 600, two were confirmed dead. At least 20 had not been heard from since Dorian spent two days destroying almost every building in sight.\n\n\u201cWe need aid,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cWe have nothing. Everyone is doing this self-sufficiently.\u201d\n\nThe hurricane\u2019s devastating 185mph winds brought destruction to Grand Bahama and the Abaco Islands and left at least 30 people dead \u2013 a toll that is sure to rise as emergency crews search for survivors.\n\nParts of the road just outside town had been stripped of tarmac, leaving rubble, exposed pipework and pools of bronzed water where trapped fish still swam. Broken pylons dangled in the street. Palms were bent at 45 degrees, leaves shaved off by the wind.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A woman looks through a broken window into a destroyed house in the High Rock community in the eastern side of Grand Bahama.

Many who have lived here for generations said the brutality of the storm was something they had never seen or even heard of before.\n\nFor Roberts, who works at a nearby casino \u2013 also obliterated \u2013 the unprecedented intensity of Dorian, the way it strengthened so quickly to category 5 and stood over the island for more than 24 hours, had a simple explanation.\n\n\u201cI think the climate is playing a big role in all of this,\u201d she said, starring at the muddy tiled floor of a partially destroyed home in which she had taken shelter. \u201cThe severity of this \u2026 it\u2019s global warming.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve recycled all my life. I use less plastic. And think about less emissions. I\u2019ve always been committed. But the world is not.\u201d\n\nAs residents of High Rock began to assess the damage, the global climate crisis was on the minds of many.\n\nEuridice Kemp, a 40-year-old resident of Freeport, had returned to help salvage what she could from her grandparents\u2019 home. All that was left of the building were the concrete foundations. Belongings \u2013 crockery, family photos, clothes, wooden furniture \u2013 were strewn on the muddy grass. She pointed to the horizon where six coconut trees once stood, where she played as a child.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Car tossed into the trees in the section called Freetown on the eastern side of Grand Bahama.

Never \u2026 never in my life. My heart is broken. I\u2019m in shock.\u201d\n\nDid she consider herself a victim of the climate crisis?\n\n\u201cWe are the biggest victims of climate change. But how can we fight for ourselves against bigger, global countries? How do we move forward?\u201d\n\nAt the shoreline, the sea still churned. A lighthouse was partially destroyed, its light blown away, leaving only a red-and-white striped tower.\n\nPastor Joey Saunders, 61, was counting his blessings. The storm surge crept up to the roof of his house. He spent two days clinging to the branches of a tree, waiting for the water to recede, terrified that sharks might lurk below. The wind lashed him so hard, he began to feel numb.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t feel anything any more,\u201d he said. \u201cI was just so afraid.\u201d\n\nLimited aid has recently arrived in Grand Bahama and the Abaco Islands \u2013 with officials battling flooding and poor weather conditions for days.\n\nOn Grand Abaco, the Royal Bahamas Defense force assisted around 160 evacuees to leave the island via ferry. The British navy is also assisting aid operations in the region and private vessels have begun to arrive as well.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Crew members from Royal Caribbean Cruise Line\u2019s Symphony of the Seas load humanitarian aid for residents of Grand Bahama.

The food will be distributed by local NGOs and the Bahamian government.\n\nThe United Nations has announced the purchase of eight tons in ready to eat meals and is aiming to provide other assistance including satellite communications and generators.\n\nThe UN has said since Wednesday that around 70,000 people in the northern archipelagos of the Bahamas are in need of life-saving assistance.", "description": "Lashing rain, 185mph winds \u2013 the ferocious storm has left 30 dead and hundreds missing.
