Even till a decade ago, every teenager did not have a smartphone or even a personal mobile phone. We used to remember eight-digit numbers of more than 15 people, all landline, because we did not not have the luxury of saving numbers on our phones (fine, we used to write them in diaries, but you get the drift). Anyway, so when I think of landline, no other name comes to mind but MTNL and BSNL. Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited (MTNL) was founded in 1986 and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) in 1980.\n\nAnd even though its was not the best WiFi connection I ever had, MTNL was the first and it did a decent job, until private broadbands leveled up the competition.\n\nQuora\n\nAs you might know by now, owing to the loss these state-run services are running into, the finance ministry has suggested that these be shut down. Not only will this move jeopardise the jobs of about 2 lakh people, but it will also be the end of an era. We already remember the days of the landline in nostalgia as we increasingly become technologically advanced.\n\nMTNL and BSNL broadband connections stand as a reminder of simpler days. MTNL with its 1000 minutes free recharge was a boon for a teenager like me, who reached home later, and dialled the number of my best friend first.\n\nDon't Miss 1.9 K SHARES 13.1 K SHARES 1.4 K SHARES\n\nMTNL\n\nIn the 90s, things were different; when telephone came to India it was a luxury. If a neighbour did not have a landline connection they gave their acquaintances and relatives your landline number. Basically, if you were someone who owned a landline in a village, it was public property.\n\nThe phones with rings in them (that\u2019s the only way I can describe them as, for reference look at the image below) are now counted as antiques, but people who used them are still very much alive. MTNL and BSNL made it possible for the people of the country to communicate long distances for decent charges, for the first time.\n\nTwitter\n\nI still remember my 8-digit landline number even though it has long been out of use, such is the value of that time in my life and I am not alone in that. I am sure crores of people out there feel the same.\n\nOver the years, these broadbands might have been falling behind in providing the best services, but one cannot forget their contribution in making communication over phone, easy in India.\n\nLet us hope that government find some solution to keep the two companies in business, otherwise there will be a looming suspense over the fate of lakhs of people.", "description": "90s kids know what talking for hours and hours on a wired landline felt like.
