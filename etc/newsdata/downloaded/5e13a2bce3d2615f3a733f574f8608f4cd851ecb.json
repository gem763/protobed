But the partisan antics of John Bercow over Brexit have changed all that.\n\nThe Deputy Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing has publicly attacked Bercow \u2014 who is finally standing down at the end of the month \u2014 without quite mentioning him by name.\n\nLaing, a front-runner to replace the insufferably pompous Bercow, told me on my LBC radio show: \u2018He rightly says the Speaker\u2019s job is to protect minorities. Who is the significant minority in the Commons? The answer: MPs who voted Leave.\n\nDeputy Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing has publicly attacked Bercow \u2014 who is finally standing down at the end of the month \u2014 without quite mentioning him by name\n\n\u2018We are in a situation where the minority in the Commons is the same as the majority in the rest of the country. That is why we have this imbalance.\u2019\n\nLaing added that many MPs believed \u2018impartiality has been diminished\u2019.\n\nThe Tory MP for Epping Forest said that after six years in the deputy role she\u2019d learned an important lesson: \u2018Your duty to the chair is far greater than your urge to get into an argument. You have got to learn to keep your mouth shut.\u2019\n\nAnd that\u2019s something that blaring, bombastic John Bercow never understood.\n\nYou won't better Betty, Harriet\n\nAnother contender for the Speaker\u2019s chair, Labour\u2019s Harriet Harman, 69, says that electing her would show that women in their 60s are not past it.\n\nEr... Betty Boothroyd\u2019s been there and done that, Harriet.\n\nIn 1992, when she became Speaker, the great lady was 62.\n\nAnother contender for the Speaker\u2019s chair, Labour\u2019s Harriet Harman, 69, says that electing her would show that women in their 60s are not past it\n\nLife loses spice for sporty Mims\n\nFormer sports minister Mims Davies clearly enjoyed her whirlwind nine-month stint at the Department for Culture.\n\nHer most recent entry in the Register of Members\u2019 Financial Interests reveals she snaffled free tickets to Royal Ascot\u2019s royal box, concerts by Hugh Jackman, and the Spice Girls, Capital FM\u2019s Summertime Ball and the Victoria & Albert Museum\u2019s Dior exhibition (with three guests), as well as a trip to Nice to attend the Women\u2019s Football World Cup.\n\nI suspect the perks associated with her new role as employment Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Work and Pensions are not quite as alluring.\n\nSince he saw off the attempt to replace him as Labour\u2019s deputy leader at the party conference, Tom Watson has been keeping a low profile.\n\nSo low in fact that he rarely bothers to attend Shadow Cabinet any more.\n\n\u2018He can\u2019t see the point,\u2019 said a friend.\n\n\u2018Corbyn never wants him to say anything . . . so he can make his points more effectively in the media than in the Shadow Cabinet.\u2019\n\nSince he saw off the attempt to replace him as Labour\u2019s deputy leader at the party conference, Tom Watson has been keeping a low profile. So low in fact that he rarely bothers to attend Shadow Cabinet any more\n\nInvited to choose her favourite LP for National Album Day last Saturday, Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan plumped for Robbie Williams\u2019s 1998 record I\u2019ve Been Expecting You.\n\n\u2018My favourite song is No Regrets because it reminds me of my youth,\u2019 added Morgan, hinting at more exciting activities than running through a wheat field (as a certain Theresa May once claimed to have done).\n\nClearly, Morgan has no regrets about reneging on her previously stated refusal to serve in a Boris Johnson Cabinet.\n\nMeanwhile, Jezza is calling for a public inquiry into arms sales to Saudi Arabia, saying: \u2018UK advice, assistance and arms supplies to Saudi\u2019s war in Yemen is a moral stain on our country. Arms sales to Saudi must stop now.\u2019\n\nImran Hussain, the Shadow Minister of State for Justice, is no fan either, declaring: \u2018I think Saudi have public beheadings. So not much justice there then.\u2019\n\nOdd then that, in August, Hussain accepted \u00a320,000 from the Saudi UK embassy for a two-week trip for two to Mecca.\n\nMeanwhile, Jezza is calling for a public inquiry into arms sales to Saudi Arabia, saying: \u2018UK advice, assistance and arms supplies to Saudi\u2019s war in Yemen is a moral stain on our country. Arms sales to Saudi must stop now'\n\nGeoffrey Cox is letting the good times roll since becoming Attorney General.\n\nA parliamentary answer reveals that his ascetic predecessor, Jeremy Wright, spent precisely zero on \u2018refreshments\u2019 in 2017.\n\nUnder treacle-voiced Cox, the figure rose to a more respectable \u00a3603.44. Not enough to crack open a bottle of Chateau Margaux 1787, perhaps, but getting there.", "description": "ANDREW PIERCE: The Deputy Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing has publicly attacked Bercow - who is finally standing down at the end of the month - without quite mentioning him by name.", "authors": ["Andrew Pierce For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/00/19671086-0-image-a-27_1571010630423.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
