Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party does not have a majority in the House of Commons.\n\nBelow are reactions from key players in Britain to the new deal:\n\nARLENE FOSTER AND NIGEL DODDS, LEADERS OF NORTHERN IRELAND\u2019S DUP PARTY:\n\n\u201cAs things stand, we could not support what is being suggested on customs and consent issues and there is a lack of clarity on VAT.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work with the government to try and get a sensible deal that works for Northern Ireland and protects the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom.\u201d\n\nJEREMY CORBYN, LEADER OF THE MAIN OPPOSITION LABOUR PARTY:\n\n\u201cThis sell-out deal won\u2019t bring the country together and should be rejected. The best way to get Brexit sorted is to give the people the final say in a public vote.\u201d He said Labour would not vote for the deal in parliament.\n\nNICOLA STURGEON, LEADER OF THE SCOTTISH NATIONAL PARTY:\n\n\u201cThe Brexit envisaged by Boris Johnson is one which sees a much looser relationship with the EU when it comes to issues like food standards, environmental protections and workers\u2019 rights.\n\n\u201cScotland did not vote for Brexit in any form, and SNP MPs (lawmakers) will not vote for Brexit in any form.\u201d\n\nJO SWINSON, LEADER OF THE PRO-EU LIBERAL DEMOCRATS:\n\n\u201cThe fight to stop Brexit is far from over. This Brexit deal would be bad for our economy, bad for our public services and bad for our environment.\u201d\n\nNIGEL FARAGE, LEADER OF THE BREXIT PARTY:\n\n\u201cIt binds us into so many other commitments on foreign policy, military policy - a list as long as your arm, and I frankly think it should be rejected.\n\n\u201cWould I rather accept a new European treaty that is, frankly, very bad for us, or would I prefer to have an extension, and a general election? I would always go for the latter option. I genuinely believe that a clean break and being able to be competitive is the absolute key to our future economic success. We cannot do that with this new treaty.\u201d", "description": "The European Union and the British government have finally clinched a new deal setting the terms of Britain's exit from the bloc.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441853077&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G0ZO", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
