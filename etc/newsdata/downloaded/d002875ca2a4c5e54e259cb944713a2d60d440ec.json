Called the Libra Association, it will control the blockchain and collect the seigniorage income. Libra Association members include Mastercard MA, +0.00%, PayPal PYPL, -0.15%, eBay EBAY, -0.25% and Uber UBER, -0.58%.\n\n\u201cWith such a setup, it is difficult to discern the foundational promises of decentralization and disintermediation normally associated with cryptocurrencies and other digital currencies. On the contrary, similarly to public money, Libra will actually be highly centralized, with Facebook and its partners acting as quasi-sovereign issuers of currency,\u201d he said.\n\nPublic money also is centralized, but unlike Libra, has a \u201csovereign entity and a central issuance authority.\u201d The corporate entities, by contrast, are accountable to their shareholders and will \u201cget privileged access to private data that they can abusively monetize.\u201d\n\nLibra also lacks a global lender of last resort and is devoid of the equivalent of a depository guarantee scheme, he said.\n\nLibra has faced a mostly hostile reception from regulators and politicians, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and President Donald Trump. However, Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney envisioned Libra as a possible alternative to the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency.\n\nFacebook is planning on a 2020 launch for Libra.\n\nRelated: Facebook\u2019s Libra cryptocurrency project gets hostile reception from Senate", "description": "A high-ranking European Central Bank official on Monday outlined problems with the planned cryptocurrency, the latest in a series of warnings from government...", "authors": ["Steve Goldstein", "European Markets Editor"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ530_mersch_ZG_20190902060143.jpg"}
