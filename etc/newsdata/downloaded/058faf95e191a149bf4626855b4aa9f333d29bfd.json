REUTERS/Fabian Bimmer\n\nThe export-reliant economy has been hurt by a global slowdown, trade disputes caused by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s \u2018America First\u2019 policies and business uncertainty linked to Britain\u2019s planned but delayed departure from the European Union.\n\n\u201cFor our economy, with its strong industrial core, this is a huge challenge,\u201d DIHK President Eric Schweitzer said when presenting the association\u2019s latest business sentiment survey of more than 28,000 managers.\n\nDIHK said it expects Germany\u2019s annual export growth to wither to 0.3% this year from 2.1% in 2018, adding that exports are likely to shrink by 0.5% next year.\n\n\u201cSince the financial crisis of 2008/2009, the DIHK has not received such pessimistic replies from the companies,\u201d Schweitzer said. He pointed out that Germany\u2019s average export growth rate was normally around 5.5 percent.\n\nDue to the bleak trade outlook, the DIHK cut its 2019 gross domestic product growth forecast for the German economy to 0.4% from 0.6% previously.\n\nIt forecasts GDP growth of 0.5% for 2020, adding that the increase was mainly due to an unusual high number of working days next year.\n\nIn a further sign of economic trouble, German unemployment rose more than expected in October, separate data showed on Wednesday, suggesting that the manufacturing crisis is spilling over to the labor market and could slow consumer spending.\n\nData from the Federal Labour Office showed the number of people out of work increased by 6,000 to 2.287 million in seasonally adjusted terms. That compared with the Reuters consensus forecast for a rise of 2,000.\n\nThe jobless rate held steady at 5.0% - slightly above the record low of 4.9% reached earlier this year.\n\n\u201cThe recent economic weakness is leaving its marks on the job market. But all in all, it still proves to be robust,\u201d said Labour Office head Detlef Scheele.", "description": "German exports will shrink next year for the first time since the global financial crisis over a decade ago, the DIHK Chambers of Industry and Commerce said on Wednesday, as Europe's largest economy struggles to eke out growth in a slowing global market.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446439679&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0DC", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
