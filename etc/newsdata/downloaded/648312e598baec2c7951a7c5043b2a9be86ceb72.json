The Straits Times\n\nJust four months after announcing an MOU to expand their code-share arrangement, Singapore Airlines (SIA) and Malaysia Airlines Berhad (MAB) have revealed plans to share revenue on flights between Singapore and Malaysia.\n\nThe agreement signed on October 30 also includes SIA subsidiaries SilkAir and Scoot, as well as Firefly, the sister airline of MAB.\n\nAs part of the agreement, which is still subject to approval from competition authorities, the carriers will expand their code-share routes to include more destinations on each other\u2019s networks, and participate in joint marketing activities to develop tourism in each other\u2019s homecountries.\n\nThe airlines already operate code-share on flights between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, Kota Kinabalu, Kuching and Penang.\n\nWith the expansion, SIA and SilkAir plan to code-share on MAB\u2019s domestic flights so that the two Singapore carriers will serve a total of 16 destinations in Malaysia, the companies said in a joint statement.\n\nIn turn, MAB will progressively code-share on flights between Singapore and Malaysia, Europe, South Africa and other destinations, giving MAB more opportunities to expand connectivity to and from Malaysia. Once approved, this will be implemented in phases, the statement said.\n\nIf approved, the airlines intend to coordinate flight schedules to provide customers with more flight choices and increased frequency.\n\nThey will also offer joint fare products, align corporate programmes to enhance the value proposition to customers, and explore tie-ups between their frequent-flyer programmes.\n\nIf all goes to plan, the airlines will also explore the potential development of airpasses, which will enable customers travelling to Malaysia through Kuala Lumpur and Singapore \u201cmore choices\u201d to visit other parts of the country on a single ticket.\n\nThe airlines did not specify the details these airpasses would entail, but said that travellers can expect a \u201cseamless experience of convenience and flexibility while enjoying multi-stop itineraries\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis will be a win-win for both our airline groups, and provide new benefits for our customers, SIA CEO, Goh Choon Phong said.\n\n\u201cIn particular, the expanded scope of our partnership has the potential to provide a significant boost to the tourism industries in both Malaysia and Singapore, as well as the wider Southeast Asia region,\u201d he added.\n\nMAB CEO, Captain Izham Ismail said the agreement would provide customers with a \u201cmore competitive product between Malaysia and Singapore and the opportunity to travel to more global destinations\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis partnership is more than a conventional partnership and we believe in the mutual benefits for both airline groups and countries,\u201d he said.\n\nEarlier this year, SIA came in second on a Skytrax ranking of the world\u2019s best airlines. MAB came in 36th place.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - The agreement will also include SilkAir and Scoot, as well as Firefly..
