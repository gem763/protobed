The plan was to watch the sunset together \u2014 but that didn't end up happening.\n\nInstead, Davis was also attacked by a bison, launched 15 feet into the air and gored in her thigh and ankle. She had to be airlifted to the hospital.\n\nKyler Bourgeous on his first hike after his injury, still with a drain in his hip wound. (Submitted by Kyler Bourgeous)\n\nUtah State Parks Lt. Eric Stucki doesn't believe either victim \"did anything out of the ordinary\" to antagonize the bison.\n\nBourgeous spoke with As It Happens host Carol Off about the attacks. Here's part of that conversation.\n\nWhat happened to you back in June at Antelope Island?\n\nI was running up the Frary Peak Trail, which is a favourite trail of mine that I've done almost 150 times before.\n\nAs I crested a ridge below one of the peaks on the way to the main peak \u2014 because of the angle of the trail \u2014 I couldn't see the bison until I was way too close to them.\n\nI turned around immediately and started walking away. But I looked back and saw one of them was charging me right away.\n\nI tried to run, but there's no way I was going to outrun a bison.\n\nWhat kind of an impact do you get when a bison hits you?\n\nIt's like getting hit by a very precise car because they can weigh up to 2,000 pounds. They can go to like 35 to 40 miles an hour, and it has got sharp horns that pierced me in the armpit and hip and made a good sized hole in my hip.\n\nIt sent me flying through the air, rotating before I hit the ground.\n\nDid it come back then after that?\n\nThe impact sent me flying and it came and trampled me while on the ground for a minute, so I'm just in this whirlwind of hooves.\n\nIt moved off a bit and just stood on the side waiting to see if I was going to move again, so I was just kind of side glancing at it, you know watching it, but not moving too much.\n\nIs that what you're supposed to do \u2026 you just lay still?\n\nYeah. Don't give it any reason to think you're still a threat. And Kayleigh actually said that's what was echoing in her mind when she got hit.\n\nKayleigh Davis on her first date with Kyler Bourgeous. (Submitted by Kyler Bourgeous)\n\n[Despite] that encounter, you were anxious to get back out and to get under the big sky again I understand?\n\nI don't know if you've been to Utah, but it is a beautiful place.\n\nI would just pace my yard every day and then started walking to the corner.\n\nIt was only eleven days after when I went back hiking again. It hurt quite a bit, but I just like being outside too much to sit down.\n\nGoing back to Antelope Island was a whole other deal. I waited a while on that one.\n\nBut you didn't just go back to Antelope Island, you took a date. \u2026 How did you convince her that it was a good idea to go to Antelope Island?\n\nWe'd actually gone running out there on a different trail one week earlier and she lives in this area. She has been out there before and she's also an avid hiker.\n\nWhen I had called her Friday to go out there, she was already headed out there alone. So I didn't actually have to convince her.\n\nA bison is pictured during the annual bison roundup on Antelope Island, Utah in Oct. 2016. (Rick Bowmer/The Associated Press)\n\nSo you were out there with Kayleigh. She started up the trail before you, right?\n\nYeah. I had just gone for a run up on a different trail on a different mountain range and she wanted to run. She has been training to do a half-marathon.\n\nSo I brought my dogs along and she said, \"You just go ahead and take off.\" We had a designated spot we were going to meet to watch the sunset.\n\nI was probably a quarter mile behind her when her incident occurred.\n\nAt what point did you realize or learn that something serious had happened to Kayleigh?\n\nThere are a couple of small hills between us and I see a bison pretty far off that was now right by the trail. So I just stopped there and waited because there was a group of bikers that had passed me and half of them had passed her.\n\nThey were up ahead near the bison, so I just stood really far back watching and I see the bison bluff charge.\n\nIt was a scout troop. So it bluff-charged the scout leader, [who] I came to find out was actually helping [Kayleigh].\n\nShe was lying on the ground next to that bison but I couldn't see her in the grass there. He was distracting it, trying to get it away from her.\n\nSo I saw it charge him. Thankfully it stopped short and didn't hit him too.\n\nAS IT HAPPENS: Canadian who put baby bison in SUV defends his decision after court order\n\nHow is her recovery going \u2014 is she OK?\n\nShe is actually.\n\nEven though she got flung in the air, she didn't get any spine or head injuries.\n\nHer [recovery] is going to be quite a bit longer than mine was because of her foot injury.\n\nIt will be about six weeks before she can walk on it properly, so she's able to get around with crutches.\n\nApparently there have only been two bison attacks at Antelope Island State Park this year. So are you taking this personally?\n\nIt's kind of hard not to \u2014 and I'm often reminded that I'm probably cursed.\n\nI don't know how to take it. I know everybody kind of thinks that it was probably your fault if you got attacked by a bison because they hear stories of people deliberately getting too close to take a picture or whatever.\n\nSo that's the common first reaction.\n\nBut we talked to the rangers and they'll say, \"It sounds like you didn't do anything \u2026 It is just a really unlucky accident.\"\n\nWill Kayleigh go out with you again?\n\nWe have been hanging out still, yeah.\n\nWritten by Katie Geleff with files from The Associated Press.
