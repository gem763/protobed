It\u2019s commendable on the merits, in that Trump\u2019s reluctance to wage war is a welcome corrective to the McCain/Graham-style of hyperinterventionism that ruled the GOP for years. But it\u2019s also gratifying on a gut level, even as a Trump skeptic. \u201cOne of Trump\u2019s more likable qualities is his penchant for publicly humiliating all the lickspittle Republicans who try and ride his coattails,\u201d writes C.J. Ciaramella of Reason, remembering how Chris Christie was treated during the 2016 campaign. It\u2019s true! What could be more enjoyable than watching Graham toady to the president day and night after dismissing him as a \u201ckook\u201d and a national security threat in 2016, believing that it will buy him influence over foreign policy, and as his reward having him endure daily reminders that Trump is far more inclined towards Rand Paul\u2019s fopo views than Lindsey\u2019s?\n\nThis exchange last night on Twitter was especially humiliating for Graham, and thus especially enjoyable.\n\nThis is literally an act of war and the goal should be to restore deterrence against Iranian aggression which has clearly been lost. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 17, 2019\n\nThe measured response by President @realDonaldTrump regarding the shooting down of an American drone was clearly seen by the Iranian regime as a sign of weakness. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 17, 2019\n\nNo Lindsey, it was a sign of strength that some people just don\u2019t understand! https://t.co/EU8AvfH7j9 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 18, 2019\n\nMy first thought when I saw Trump\u2019s tweet was that he meant it was Iran, not Graham, that didn\u2019t understand his decision not to attack several months ago was a show of strength. They should have come to the table then, Trump was saying (I thought). Instead they went and attacked Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities, destabilizing energy markets, and now they\u2019ll have to absorb some pain.\n\nBut no, he was definitely talking about Graham.\n\nTrump reacts to Sen. Lindsey Graham's criticism of his Iranian response: \"I actually think it's a sign of strength. \u2026 If you ask Lindsey, ask him, 'How did going into the Middle East, how did that work out?' \u2026 We have a disagreement on that\" https://t.co/4QcXQ1SA6w pic.twitter.com/Je9zSLIukc \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 18, 2019\n\nYou will not be surprised to learn that Graham\u2019s preferred course of action is to start bombing Iranian oil refineries. You also won\u2019t be surprised to learn that Trump is reluctant to order military action, dispatching Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia instead to \u201ccoordinate\u201d an international response \u2014 whatever that means. U.S. intelligence sounds confident that the attack on the Kingdom did indeed come from Iran, partly because Saudi missile defenses were trained on Yemen and the Strait of Hormuz in the belief that any potential attack would originate there. Instead the missiles and drones that struck the oil sites came from southwestern Iran, evading detection. The Saudis could take the evidence to the UN Security Council with U.S. support and demand action, but Iran\u2019s friends in Russia are likely to block any resolution imposing consequences. Trump could attack unilaterally, of course, either with conventional military action or cyberwarfare like that mysterious incident with the Iranian missile launch a few months ago.\n\nOr he could back off and let the Saudis handle this, which would be dangerous.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little concerned that he\u2019ll go full Trumpian and greenlight a Saudi retaliation,\u201d said Mark Dubowitz, head of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a think tank that advocates a hard line against Iran. Dubowitz said such a \u201cworst case scenario\u201d could lead Riyadh to act with impunity if Trump kept the U.S. out of the fray, and that could prompt a serious Iranian retaliation that leads to an escalating cycle of violence. \u201cI\u2019m of the view, based on decades of [Iranian] revolutionary response to American power, that if the United States uses military power, the regime is likely to back down, not escalate. If the Saudis use military power, the regime is likely to escalate,\u201d Dubowitz said.\n\nA Saudi attack rather than a U.S. attack might be a recipe for protracted regional war. Where does that leave the \u201crealist\u201d view on this? Realists sneer at neoconservatives that their regime-change fantasies never work as planned and are in fact based on the foolish conviction that democracy will somehow liberalize fundamentally illiberal cultures. We should only use military force when it serves a concrete American interest, they warn. Well, there\u2019s a looming Sunni/Shiite war in the region right now that\u2019ll disrupt global oil supplies for God knows how long if it gets hot. Does that mean the \u201crealist\u201d view is to hit Iran ourselves, expecting \u2014 fingers crossed! \u2014 that they\u2019ll absorb the blow and not dare retaliate? Or is the realist view to eschew bombs and tighten sanctions further even though our current sanctions are already onerous and the marginal utility in increasing them is diminishing? Further, Graham is certainly right that *at some point* inaction in the face of provocation signals weakness, which will invite further provocation. If Trump decides to slap Iran on the wrist for the Saudi attack and then Iran hits more oil facilities next month, what\u2019s the move then? America\u2019s posture can\u2019t be \u201cplease, please sit down with us and talk!\u201d in response to every move Iran makes.\n\nExit quotation from Pompeo, speaking in the Kingdom today: \u201cThe Saudis were the nation that were attacked. It was on their soil. It was an act of war against them directly.\u201d Gulp.\n\nUpdate: Well, here we go. Nothing\u2019s going to get an all-out war of hawks versus doves going like a standoff with Iran.\n\nJohn Bolton, President Donald Trump\u2019s fired national security adviser, harshly criticized Trump\u2019s foreign policy on Wednesday at a private lunch, saying inviting the Taliban to Camp David sent a \u201cterrible signal\u201d and that it was \u201cdisrespectful\u201d to the victims of 9/11 because the Taliban had harbored al Qaeda\u2026 Bolton also said more than once that Trump\u2019s failure to respond to the Iranian attack on an American drone earlier this summer set the stage for the Islamic Republic\u2019s aggression in recent months. At one point, Bolton, a previous chairman of Gatestone who has resumed his title at the think tank, suggested that had the U.S. retaliated for the drone shootdown, Iran might not have damaged the Saudi oil fields.\n\nI trust the president will receive this news with his characteristic good cheer. An interesting detail to the story: Bolton was introduced as \u201cthe best national security adviser our country could have hoped for\u201d by \u2026 Rebekah Mercer, one of Trump\u2019s top patrons in 2016 and one of Breitbart\u2019s top patrons to this day (as far as I know). Is Mercer siding with the hawkish establishment against the dovish populists on this one?", "description": "Hawks.", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/t-9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
