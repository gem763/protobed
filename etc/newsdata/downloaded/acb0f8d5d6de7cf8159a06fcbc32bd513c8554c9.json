They\u2019re grown men. I\u2019m not going to get in the middle of their disagreements.\u201d\n\nCavuto, meanwhile, reminded McDaniel that one of the men was her uncle and the president \u201ccalled him an ass.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gone both ways,\u201d McDaniel deflected. \u201cI\u2019m not getting in the middle, they are perfectly capable of conveying what they think to each other.\u201d\n\nShe went on to applaud Trump\u2019s approval rating among Republican voters, adding that the president\u2019s base wants to see him re-elected.\n\nThe Fox host concluded the interview by pressing the RNC chief on the issue one more time, asking her whether she\u2019d talked to her uncle since Trump went on the attack against him.\n\n\u201cNo, I have not,\u201d McDaniel said.", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s gone both ways,\u201d McDaniel deflected. \u201cI\u2019m not getting in the middle, they are perfectly capable of conveying what they think to each other.\u201d", "authors": ["Justin Baragona"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570658112/your-world-neil-cavuto_11_futone", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
