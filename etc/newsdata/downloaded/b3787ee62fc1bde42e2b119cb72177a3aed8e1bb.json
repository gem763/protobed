Aldrich on Saturday at UFC on ESPN+ 19.\n\nAfter starting her career with five consecutive wins, Mueller (5-2 MMA, 1-2 UFC) has dropped two in a row heading into her women\u2019s flyweight showdown with Aldrich (7-3 MMA, 3-2 UFC).\n\nAlthough not particularly happy with her current position, Mueller has the utmost confidence she will burst out of her slump and show that her previous two bouts don\u2019t define her.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no pressure on me,\u201d Mueller told MMA Junkie. \u201cI don\u2019t really hang on to that kind of stuff. But in the same sense with saying that, I do let it fuel me because I am coming off two losses. I do know what I\u2019m capable of. Those performances are nothing of who I am as a fighter. This fight, I\u2019m definitely going out very dominant, and I\u2019m definitely going to show who I am and why I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\nMueller hasn\u2019t had her hand raised after a fight since April 2018. However, she intends to change that this weekend.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to unleash on this girl,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cI feel ready. I feel absolutely ready.\u201d\n\nUFC on ESPN+ 19 takes place at Amalie Arena, and the entire event is set to stream on ESPN+.\n\nTo hear more from Mueller on her preparation, the fight with Aldrich and her championship goals, watch the video above.", "description": "Lauren Mueller plans to show how much she's learned from back-to-back losses with a big win against J.J.
