A vote on the plan could come as soon as this week.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t back this deal, then the risk is that the European Council may not grant an extension,\u201d Gove, who is in charge of no-deal Brexit preparations, told Sky TV\u2019s \u201cSophy Ridge on Sunday\u201d show. \u201cWe can\u2019t bet on that. It\u2019s not a sure thing.\u201d\n\nBound by a law he opposed, Johnson on Saturday formally asked the EU to delay Brexit until Jan. 31. But he made clear that he\u2019d rather Britain leave without delay and refused to sign the letter requesting an extension to his Oct. 31 target. European Council President Donald Tusk will now start consulting EU leaders on how to react.\n\nThe move came after a day of drama in a rare Saturday sitting of the House of Commons, where lawmakers denied Johnson the chance of putting his newly minted deal to the test by voting 322 to 306 in favor of an amendment by former Tory minister Oliver Letwin that basically required him to ask the EU for the delay.\n\nEU Reaction\n\nHours after the vote, French President Emmanuel Macron made it clear the deal had been negotiated and that further delay in Britain\u2019s departure was \u201cin no one\u2019s interest.\u201d However, Finnish Prime Minister Antti Rinne said Sunday that it would be \u201csensible\u201d to grant an extension. A unanimous agreement among EU nations is needed to approve a delay.\n\nJohnson now plans to push through the legislation needed to take Britain out of the EU at the end of the month, and the slender margin of Saturday\u2019s vote suggests he could succeed.\n\nThe Withdrawal Agreement Bill could begin its journey as soon as Tuesday, after Johnson makes another attempt on Monday to get Parliament to sign off on the principle of his deal. If a vote is permitted tomorrow and Johnson wins, he could withdraw the request for an extension.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to deliver by the 31st of October,\u201d Gove said. \u201cWe are going to ensure that we get this deal done and I\u2019m confident that with the support of good people with whom we may have disagreed in the past, but who respect democracy, we will get this deal done.\u201d\n\nForeign Secretary Dominic Raab also expressed optimism, telling BBC TV\u2019s \u201cAndrew Marr\u201d show that \u201cwe appear to have the numbers to get this through.\u201d\n\nJohnson received a boost earlier Sunday when former cabinet minister Amber Rudd, who walked out of the government and the Tory party in protest at the expulsion of 21 colleagues, said she and many among those kicked out are ready to support his deal.\n\n\u201cWe do want to leave with a deal and this deal from the prime minister is good enough for me,\u201d said Rudd, who backed the Letwin amendment that forced the delay.\n\nPound Braced\n\nJohnson also has the support of a small number of Labour MPs, though he may struggle to win over many more with the party calculating that a wounded Johnson would be easier to take on in the likely general to come. Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership is seeking safeguards over issues from the environment to workers\u2019 rights, and crucially wants any deal to be put to another referendum with an option to stay in the EU.\n\nHis key problem could lie in wooing back his allies in the Democratic Unionist Party, whose 10 votes on Saturday made the difference between defeat and victory. The Northern Irish party has deep reservations about anything that creates any kind of border between Britain and Northern Ireland, such as customs checks in the Irish Sea, and wants a stronger consent mechanism that hands a greater say to the regional assembly.\n\nJohnson\u2019s setback on Saturday could hit the pound when trading resumes, though any weakness in the currency may be short lived, analysts at Credit Agricole and Natwest Markets wrote in research notes. Even though political uncertainty remains, both banks see a diminishing risk of the U.K. crashing out of the bloc without a deal, with Credit Agricole predicting the pound reaching $1.36 and Natwest forecasting $1.35.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Andrew Atkinson in London at a.atkinson@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Fergal O'Brien at fobrien@bloomberg.net, Andrew Davis, James Amott\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up to our\u00a0Brexit\u00a0Bulletin, follow us @Brexit\u00a0and\u00a0subscribe to our podcast.Great Britain could crash out of the European Union on Oct. 31 if Parliament rejects Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal, a leading cabinet minister warned.Michael Gove said he was confident the prime minister had enough", "authors": ["Andrew Atkinson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MB4QLGcKy3qVhcFSJb.cSw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/bloomberg_politics_video_969/7c043bb9ece1144d6761c1fb4cf6d740", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
