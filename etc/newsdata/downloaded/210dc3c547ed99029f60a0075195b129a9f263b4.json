Photo: Getty Images\n\nThere was full summer sunshine in London when I arrived \u2014 not to stoop to clich\u00e9, but it was about as un-London a day as one could hope for. And for 24 hours, everything glittered like a JW Anderson bra, which is to say, like a bit of oversize jewelry you wear outside your clothes if you\u2019re brave enough. At his spring 2020 show at Yeomanry House, Jonathan Anderson reenvisioned the bra as a kind of necklace for your chest, a M\u00f6bius strip of sparkle, turning a small, tucked-away underthing into a maximum, unmissable overthing. Go on, then! he seemed to say. Why not?\n\n\u201cGo on, then!\u201d could be the tagline for all of London Fashion Week if it\u2019s in the market for a new one. There\u2019s a brio here that fashion weeks in the other cities \u2014 New York, Milan, Paris \u2014 don\u2019t always share. The designers of London Fashion Week aren\u2019t afraid to dig in.\n\nJW Anderson Photo: Getty Images\n\nAdmittedly, that can make London a mixed bag; sometimes labels go all in and miss. That has lately befallen Burberry. A year ago, Riccardo Tisci took over Britain\u2019s biggest heritage brand, and at his show on Monday he went big: Inside a big West London theater, guests were ushered onto bleachers facing a big, mirrored box that slowly levitated as the show began, to reveal a big \u2026 something? The something was a set of pneumatic tubes that looked sort of like a blown-up pipe-fitting Victrola, and it was there to blast out the soundtrack as the models marched around it. They were the big models: Gigi, Bella, Kendall, Freja, even Agyness \u2014 as in Deyn, who was once a Burberry discovery but was then dispensed with, the rumor ran, because her overnight fame and sudden omnipresence had rendered her too big for the brand. Now she\u2019d been welcomed back into the fold for the first time in years. Aggy might\u2019ve been big, but Burbs is bigger.\n\nBurberry Photo: Getty Images\n\nFor his third collection at Burberry, Tisci pulled together the disparate parts of his repertoire. Last season, there were separate rooms for, essentially, Posh and Street. (My words, not his \u2014 I was seated in Posh; Street had cage fencing.) Now the two have been brought together in both staging and design. Unfortunately, that ended up weighing down what might have been elegant pieces with pockets, zips, and elasticated pulls \u2014 the aim was lordly, but the effect was rather labo(u)red. Where was the ease? At least the hats, megabrimmed caps trailing scrims of crystal mesh, were fun. They weren\u2019t subtle, but you could imagine them being photographed six ways from Sunday.\n\nSupriya Photo: Getty Images\n\nMaybe subtlety isn\u2019t the point (Go on, then!). Maybe the picture is. I woke up early on Monday morning to see the first runway show by Supriya Lele, a rising talent I\u2019ve been following for a while. Her collection was focused and sexy \u2014 everything trailed loose ties and strings. Clambering into the car afterward with my car mate, the stylist Patti Wilson, who has worked with everyone from David LaChapelle to Billie Eilish, I worried that those loose ends would be instantly caught in the subway doors. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re for the subway,\u201d she said seriously.\n\nMolly Goddard Photo: Getty Images\n\nAnd there wasn\u2019t anything subtle about the handful of shows that were the week\u2019s standouts. Molly Goddard\u2019s was one, with her layers of crenellated tulle skirts and dresses so big they brushed the audience as the models went by. I saw them in her showroom (I flew in too late for the show), and even on their hangers they seemed to puff up with life.\n\nSimone Rocha\u2019s was another: She lured everyone to top of the world, or at least one of the highest elevations in London, the concert venue Alexandra Palace, Ally Pally to the Brits. Rocha likes a spectral kind of femininity \u2014 all those peekaboo-ing girly frocks \u2014 but showed them pragmatically layered over tomboyish trousers and clomping brogues, making them fit for a broader swath of humanity than many other collections this week and modeling them on a broader swath of humanity, too. A rumor went around right after the show that Margaret Atwood had been in it \u2014 Simone casts a wide enough net that you could believe it possible \u2014 but no, though the great Lesley Manville (Phantom Thread\u2019s Cyril Woodcock) had been.\n\nSimone Rocha Photo: Getty Images\n\nAnd then there was JW Anderson. Those bra-encrusted dresses. Subtle? You couldn\u2019t miss \u2019em. I leave it to the ladies to decide if they\u2019ll buy and wear them. But his bravado \u2014 he spoke backstage about exaggeration, \u201ckind of a bit Antoinette,\u201d as in Marie \u2014 was winning. He plays with clothes in an appealing, almost na\u00efve manner, asking why a suit can\u2019t be blown up so that it floats around the body like a chandelier, or why a dress shouldn\u2019t have a sleeve that swoops like a cape. He takes familiar things and makes you look at them afresh. It\u2019s an approach he shares with Liz Magor, the Canadian artist whose work decorated the runway. Magor collects ephemera (kids\u2019 toys, junk) and enshrines it in vitrines. It\u2019s the mundane made magical. \u201cThere was something I liked about this idea of how do we take the things we no longer want and reposition them?\u201d Anderson said. \u201cWhat we make today can actually last for a long time \u2014 if we do not become bored of it.\u201d", "description": "Cut features writer Matthew Schneier describes his impressions of the shows at London Fashion Week Spring 2020, including Burberry, Simone Rocha, JW Anderson, and more.", "authors": ["Matthew Schneier"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/17/17-london-fashion-week-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
