Now that is love.\u201d\n\nThe snap shows a man standing in the aircraft aisle and leaning on the tops of two plane seats while a woman lies across all three seats.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

The man allegedly tried to tuck his arms in, but \u201cwas overhanging over the armrest about a quarter into my seat even when squeezing his arms in.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told the guy, \u2018Look, I\u2019ll put up with this if you give me $150 (\u00a3113) \u2013 that\u2019s half the cost of this flight and that would compensate me enough for the circumstances\u2019.\u201d\n\nThere were strong reactions to the story on both sides of the argument, with some condemning Bigbawluh\u2019s actions as \u201cfatshaming\u201d while others were convinced it was a good compromise.", "description": "One man\u2019s \u201cromantic\u201d gesture has divided opinion online after he reportedly opted to stand for six hours on a flight so his wife could lie across a row of three seats and sleep.", "authors": ["Helen Coffey"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/09/14/flight-man-standing.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
