It\u2019s very dangerous for \u2014 you know, we had 28 troops, as it turned out. People said 50. It was 28. And you had an army on both sides of those troops. Those troops could have been wiped out.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt was Trump that had said 50 troops. But these tiny numbers belie the fact that Trump ordered the withdrawal of about 1,000 U.S. troops from northeastern Syria from about a dozen bases and outposts scattered across the region, where they worked alongside Syrian Kurdish partners. The hasty withdrawal, prompted by Trump\u2019s decision to let Turkey invade, meant many of these bases had to be quickly abandoned.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI always thought if you\u2019re going in, keep the oil. Same thing here. Keep the oil. \u2026We\u2019ve secured the oil.\u201d\n\nTrump appears to be talking about a plan to leave a few hundred troops along the Iraqi border area, to prevent the Islamic State from reestablishing its caliphate in the area. That would also help the Kurds keep control on oil fields in the region. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper hinted at such a move when he told reporters over the weekend that all forces would be removed from Syria in the coming weeks \u201cexcept for \u2014 the president has approved the \u2014 keeping some forces at Tanf garrison in the south.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut the plan still has to be put into action. Trump\u2019s language suggests the United States is taking control of the oil. But the U.S. military does not seize foreign oil because it\u2019s against international law \u201cto destroy or seize the enemy\u2019s property.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have a good relationship with the Kurds. But we never agreed to, you know, protect the Kurds. We fought with them for 3\u00bd to four years. We never agreed to protect the Kurds for the rest of their lives.\u201d\n\nTrump misleadingly frames the agreement as the \u201crest of their lives.\u201d But the United States had certainly made a deal with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which lost 11,000 soldiers in defeating the Islamic State, after being trained and equipped by the United States. (Turkey considers elements of this force to be a terrorist threat.) To prevent a Turkish invasion, the United States persuaded the SDF to pull back up to nine miles from the Turkish border. In August, the SDF destroyed its own military posts after assurances the United States would not let thousands of Turkish troops invade. But then Trump tossed that aside.\n\nAD\n\nFor context, here\u2019s how Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke of the Kurds in 2018.\n\nAD\n\nSecretary of State Pompeo: \"\u2026Syrian Kurds have been great partners. We are now driving to make sure that they have a seat at the table..\" @jinsadc pic.twitter.com/GKQKRraoqY \u2014 Mutlu Civiroglu (@mutludc) October 11, 2018\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been fighting for 300 years that we know of, 300 years.\u201d\n\nTrump frequently and misleadingly frames this as a \u201chundreds of years\u201d conflict between the Turks and the Kurds. There has been a hundred-year effort to create a Kurdish state in the aftermath of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, with the Kurds frequently manipulated by great powers seeking to flex their muscles against a particular nation, such as Iraq. The United States, for instance, spent $16 million promoting a rebellion in Iraqi Kurdistan in the early 1970s, only to step aside when the Shah of Iran (then a U.S. ally) decided to cut a border deal in 1975 with Iraq. \"There is confusion and dismay among our people and force,\u201d the Kurdish leadership cabled the CIA. \u201cOur people\u2019s fate in unprecedented danger. Complete destruction hanging over our head. No explanation for all of this.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe whistleblower gave a false account. Now we have to say, well, do we have to protect somebody that gave a false account?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump says this repeatedly \u2014 he\u2019s already earned a Bottomless Pinocchio \u2014 but it\u2019s simply not true. Our line-by-line look at the whistleblower complaint, compared to the rough transcript of the July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and other information, shows that it was fairly accurate.\n\n\u201cSo was there actually an informant? Maybe the informant was Schiff. It could be Shifty Schiff. In my opinion, it\u2019s possibly Schiff. He and his staff, or his staff or a whole group.\u201d\n\nThis is ridiculous speculation. Rep Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) is not the informant. The whistleblower complaint was investigated by the inspector general for the Intelligence Community, found to be credible and then submitted to Congress.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI gave away my salary. It\u2019s, I guess, close to $450,000. I give it away. Nobody ever said, \u2018He gives away his salary.\u2019 Now it comes up because of this. But I give away my presidential salary. They say that no other president has done it. \u2026 They actually say that George Washington may \u2014 may have been the only other president to do \u2014 but see whether or not Obama gave up his salary.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe president\u2019s annual salary is currently $400,000 \u2014 and Trump is the third president to give away his salary. Herbert Hoover and John F. Kennedy, both very wealthy at the time, gave their salaries to charity. Obama gave about $1.1 million to charity during the eight years he was president, according to a Forbes analysis. His presidential salary during that period was $3.1 million, though he made millions more from book sales.\n\n\u201cBest location, right next to the airport, Miami International, one of the biggest airports in the world. Some people say it\u2019s the biggest, but one of the biggest airports in the world.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nTrump defended his now-abandoned decision to hold the Group of Seven summit at the Trump National Doral resort, but he needs to get his airport rankings straight. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is No. 1 in the world by passenger volume, with more than 100 million passengers, but Miami does not even rank in the top 20. In 2017, it ranked 40th, according to the Airports Council International.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cDoral was setting records when I bought it, because I owned it for a period of time. Setting records. It was going to \u2014 there was nothing like it. It was making a fortune. And then what happened? I announce I\u2019m going to run for office, right? And all of a \u2014 and I say we gotta build a wall, we got to have borders, we\u2019ve got to have this, we\u2019ve got to have that. All of a sudden, people \u2014 some people didn\u2019t like it. They thought the rhetoric was too tough. And it went from doing great to doing fine. It does very nicely now. It\u2019s actually coming back, I understand, very strongly. But Doral was setting records.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s Doral resort has been in sharp decline in recent years, according to the Trump Organization\u2019s own records. Its net operating income fell 69 percent from 2015 to 2017; a Trump Organization representative testified last year that the reason was Trump\u2019s damaged brand since he became president. Trump bought it in 2012, spent several years renovating it, and so it\u2019s possible 2015 was the resort\u2019s best year. There is no evidence as yet that it is coming back \u201cvery strongly.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you know George Washington, he ran his business simultaneously while he was president. \u2026 George Washington, they say, had two desks. He had a presidential desk and a business desk.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWe will leave it to readers to decide if the practices at the nation\u2019s founding are relevant today. Washington was one of the nation\u2019s largest landowners when he became president, though they were of dubious value, and he was a shareholder in the Patowmack Company, which aimed to build canals that would have given his land more value. Some historians have been critical \u2014 one wrote Washington \u201cbetrayed private trusts in pursuit of private gain\u201d \u2014 but our colleague Joel Achenbach, in his 2005 book \u201cThe Grand Idea: George Washington\u2019s Potomac and the Rise of the West,\u201d concluded: \u201cThere is remarkably little tarnish to be mined in the Washington archive. We can be confident that his reputation as an honest man is not the product of a historical whitewash.\u201d\n\nAchenbach told The Fact Checker: \u201cMy thinking is that he did remotely run Mount Vernon as a going concern during his presidency, via letters to his farm manager, but it was a completely different era. Back then he had to borrow cash just to make the trip to get inaugurated.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHey, Obama made a deal for a book. Is that running a business? I\u2019m sure he didn\u2019t even discuss it while he was president, yeah. He has a deal with Netflix. When did they start talking about that? That\u2019s only, you know, a couple of examples.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIn defending the Doral deal, Trump mentions deals that Obama arranged after he left office, speculating without evidence that Obama started negotiating them when he was president.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you people, with this phony emoluments clause \u2014 and by the way, I would say that it\u2019s cost me anywhere from $2 billion to $5 billion to be president \u2014 and that\u2019s okay \u2014 between what I lose and what I could have made.\u201d\n\nThe emoluments clause is not phony; it\u2019s right in the Constitution (Article I, Section 9, Paragraph 8): No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\n\nTrump\u2019s net worth is valued at $3 billion, so it\u2019s difficult to see how being president could cost him even more than his net worth. Bloomberg recently estimated that his net worth grew 5 percent in 2018, following two years of declines, bringing it back to the level calculated in 2016. Forbes calculated that as of September, his net worth is $3.1 billion.\n\n\u201cYou could end up in a war. President Obama told me that. He said, \u2018The biggest problem, I don\u2019t know how to solve it.\u2019 He told me he doesn\u2019t know how to solve it. I said, \u2018Did you ever call him?\u2019 \u2018No.\u2019 Actually, he tried 11 times, but the man on the other side, the gentleman on the other side, did not take his calls, okay? Lack of respect. But he takes my call.\u201d\n\nWe gave this claim Four Pinocchios in July. There is absolutely no evidence that Obama tried to call North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, let alone meet him.\n\n\u201cI see this guy, Congressman Al Green, say, \u2018We have to impeach him, otherwise he\u2019s going to win the election.\u2019 What\u2019s that all about? But that\u2019s exactly what they\u2019re saying. \u2018We have to impeach him, because otherwise he\u2019s going to win.\u2019 I\u2019m going to win the election.\u201d\n\nOne problem with this complaint: Rep. Al Green (D-Tex.) says he never said that. The Texas congressman noted that on Twitter, writing, \u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that @realDonaldTrump, who promoted birther conspiracies about President Obama, who claimed there were nice people among the bigots and racists in Charlottesville, and who consistently engages in perfidy, would tweet another untruth. I never said that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re interviewing ambassadors who I\u2019d never heard of. I don\u2019t know who these people are. I\u2019ve never heard of them.\u201d\n\nThis is false. Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union and a big donor to Trump\u2019s inauguration, testified to Congress on Oct. 17 that Trump in an Oval Office meeting on May 23 directed him, special envoy Kurt Volker and Energy Secretary Rick Perry to talk to his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani about Ukraine issues.\n\n\u201cWe asked the White House to arrange a working phone call from President Trump and a working Oval Office visit,\u201d Sondland said. \u201cHowever, President Trump was skeptical that Ukraine was serious about reforms and anti-corruption, and he directed those of us present at the meeting to talk to Mr. Giuliani, his personal attorney, about his concerns. It was apparent to all of us that the key to changing the President\u2019s mind on Ukraine was Mr. Giuliani.\u201d\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter", "description": "The president kept gabbing and gabbing -- and getting many things wrong.", "authors": ["Glenn Kessler", "The Fact Checker"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/N66fygxOT40IWq36Ouacw90Ejz0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/34TKR7HUKEI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
