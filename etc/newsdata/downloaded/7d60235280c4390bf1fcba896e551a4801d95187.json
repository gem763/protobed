REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo\n\n(Reuters) - Apple Inc on Friday confirmed that China\u2019s Uighurs, a mostly Muslim minority group considered a security threat by Beijing, had been the target of attacks due to iPhone security flaws, but disputed rival Alphabet Inc\u2019s description of the effort to track users of the smartphone in real time.\n\nGoogle Project Zero researchers said last week that five security flaws led to a \u201csustained effort to hack the users of iPhones in certain communities over a period of at least two years.\u201d\n\nThe researchers did not specify the communities, but CNN, TechCrunch and other news organizations reported that the attacks had been aimed at monitoring Uighurs. Reuters recently reported that China hacked Asian telecommunications companies to spy on Uighur travelers.\n\nApple said on Friday the attack \u201cwas narrowly focused\u201d and affected \u201cfewer than a dozen websites that focus on content related to the Uighur community\u201d rather than the \u201cen masse\u201d hack of iPhone users described by Google researchers. Apple also said it fixed the issue in February, within 10 days of being notified by Google.\n\nApple said evidence suggested that the website attacks lasted only two months, rather than the two years that Google researchers had suggested.\n\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s post, issued six months after iOS patches were released, creates the false impression of \u201cmass exploitation\u201d to \u201cmonitor the private activities of entire populations in real time,\u201d stoking fear among all iPhone users that their devices had been compromised,\u201d Apple said in a newsroom post. \u201cThis was never the case.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Google said it stood by its findings and would continue to work with Apple and other companies to find and fix flaws.\n\n\u201cProject Zero posts technical research that is designed to advance the understanding of security vulnerabilities, which leads to better defensive strategies,\u201d Google said in statement. \u201cWe stand by our in-depth research which was written to focus on the technical aspects of these vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\nGoogle and Apple are rivals in the smartphone market, where their iOS and Android operating systems vie for users. But Google\u2019s Project Zero team of researchers is focused on finding serious security flaws from a wide range of software and hardware firms, not solely Apple.
