Wednesday\u2019s GDP print comes on the heels of a slew of disappointing recent economic data reports across various areas of the economy, from retail sales to manufacturing and service sector activity.\n\nGDP is anticipated to have grown at a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 1.6% quarter-on-quarter, from the second quarter\u2019s 2.0% pace, according to Bloomberg-compiled consensus data. If realized, that would be the slowest quarterly pace of growth since fourth quarter of 2018, when GDP rose 1.1%.\n\nThe BEA\u2019s GDP report is also one the last major pieces of economic data Federal Open Market Committee officials will see before delivering their latest rate decision at 2 p.m. ET Wednesday. Investors have priced in with all but certainty that central bankers will cut benchmark interest rates by a quarter-point for a third consecutive time this year.\n\nTraders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., October 18, 2019.

But after this expected rate cut, the central bank\u2019s next move is much more opaque.\n\nSo far, markets have priced in an about 20% probability of a fourth rate cut in December \u2013 a relatively low percentage when compared to the high odds placed ahead of the past several cuts. At the conclusion of its September meeting, the Fed released its \u201cdot plot\u201d of projections for where rates were headed, showing that seven of the FOMC\u2019s 17 participants saw at least one more quarter-point rate cut by the end of 2019.\n\nWhile economic data releases Wednesday have pulled focus, corporate earnings season also continued to chug along.\n\nAhead of the opening bell, General Electric (GE) topped consensus expectations for quarterly sales and profit and boosted its guidance for closely watched industrial free cash flow for the year. The conglomerate, which is about a year into a turnaround plan led by CEO Larry Culp \u2013 said it expects as much as $2 billion in free cash flow this year, after previously projecting anywhere from negative to positive $1.0 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, Airbus (AIR.PA) beat bottom-line expectations for the quarter, but the better-than-expected profit was overshadowed after the French plane-maker lowered full-year cash flow guidance. It said it expected to deliver about 20 fewer planes this year, as production challenges hit development of its A320neo aircraft, which competes directly with Boeing\u2019s (BA) narrow-body jets.\n\nCompanies including Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL) and newly public ride-share company Lyft (LYFT) are set to report quarterly results after market close Wednesday.\n\nCatch up on what you missed More\n\n\u2014\n\nEmily McCormick is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.
