It rides on 22-inch billet aluminum wheels designed to look like steelies and wears a candy red and cream color combination.\n\nRam retained the original bench seat but reupholstered it in distressed leather, which is also featured on the doors, sunvisors and headliner. A machined aluminum instrument panel and translucent red shift knob with metal flake and a vintage Cummins logo complete the look.\n\nThe Lowrider will be on display at the industry-only event Nov. 5-9.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "Realistic custom build.", "authors": ["Gary Gastelu", "Gary Gastelu Is Foxnews.Com'S Automotive Editor.
