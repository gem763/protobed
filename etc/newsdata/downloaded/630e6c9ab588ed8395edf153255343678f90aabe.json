(Picture: BBC)\n\nRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK fans saw the brilliant Sum Ting Wong to sashay away on Thursday after failing to impress the judges with her David Attenborough impression for Snatch Game.\n\nStill, as the queen tells Metro.co.uk, she\u2019s glad she went out on a high \u2013 namely, meeting guest judge Geri Horner.\n\n\u2018It was the most iconic thing to ever happen in my life,\u2019 says Sum Ting, \u2018it was the perfect episode, such a nice way to go\u2019.\n\n\u2018Geri coming in at the end was the icing on the cake I didn\u2019t need, the doughnut you have after dinner even when you don\u2019t need it!\u2019\n\nSpice Girls star Geri has reinvented her image in recent years, making a somewhat unusual guest judge for the sweary innuendo fest that is Drag Race, with a number of fans calling her \u2018dull\u2019 in comparison to her fellow judges.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut Sum Ting reckons that Geri was \u2018iconic\u2019 and the perfect judge.\n\n\u2018I was fine until she came in, and when she came in I thought \u201cwhat is happening, is this a joke?\u201d\n\n\u2018She said so many lovely things and I don\u2019t cry normally so when she said \u201cyou are the embodiment of drag and everything I love about drag\u201d, she said I give off this warmth and loving energy and \u201cyou don\u2019t know how special that is\u201d, and I was like \u201c[random noise] I love you!\u2019\n\nSum Ting has left the competition (Picture: BBC)\n\nIn a surprising move, the show revealed that after Sum Ting was asked to sashay away, Geri re-joined Sum Ting in the Werk Room to congratulate her for getting this far in the competition.\n\n\u2018I just wanted to come and say hello to you because I thought you had such a great energy and it really came across, for me it did. I really connected with that,\u2019 Geri said.\n\n\u2018I thought you brought a lot of joy, so well done,\u2019 she continued to the teary drag queen, who could only get out the words: \u2018Geri Horner made me cry.\u2019\n\nSum Ting Wong (Picture: PA)\n\nThe episode was criticised by fans for having a marked lack of British celebrities impersonated by the queens for Snatch Game, but Sum Ting defended their choices saying that \u2018snatch game has to be a character you love, it has to be who you can do\u2019.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s pop culture and people you know,\u2019 she says.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nAs for whether she regrets doing David Attenborough? No way.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, there\u2019s a high probability he may end up seeing the moment if Sum Ting\u2019s friends have their way.\n\n\u2018I have been watching David since I was 10, I listen to him as I fall asleep, I have watched Planet Earth and Deep Sea, all of them, I love classic David Attenborough, I just love him,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018The point is to embody the character and be funny and I think he is funny. I have watched him be interviewed by Graham Norton and he is hilarious but in a very sweet way.\n\n\u2018A lot of friends of mine don\u2019t watch Drag Race but are scientists and ecologists \u2013 they call him Sir David \u2013 and they said they will send it around their next EU ecology meeting and \u201cSir David will see this\u201d, and I am like \u201cwhaaaat!\u201d\n\n\u2018If I ever meet him I would die.\u2019\n\nSum Ting Wong decided to impersonate David Attenborough on Snatch Game (Picture: BBC)\n\nSum Ting lives in London but is \u2018first-generation born Chinese-Vietnamese heritage\u2019 and originally from Birmingham.\n\nIn the first episode of the season, she told her fellow queens that her parents did not know she was gay, nor that she had made drag a career.\n\nHowever, since appearing on the show, she has come out to them \u2013 and revealed that it was the \u2018fairytale coming out\u2019 of which she had always dreamed.\n\n\u2018I called my dad and said \u201cI am bringing my boyfriend back this weekend\u201d and he said \u201cwhat, you mean girlfriend?\u201d and then he said \u201cok see you this weekend\u201d. For me, we come out every day as LGBT people, in new jobs, at the bus stop \u2013 we come out all the time \u2013 so I didn\u2019t want it to be a whole moment. I wanted it to be nothing so I gave it as nothing,\u2019 she reveals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I called my mum and told her I was bringing home my boyfriend and she was like \u201cyeah you said twice, what food do you want?\u201d\u2018\n\nA queen (Picture: Getty)\n\nWhen Sum Ting\u2019s father finally met the boyfriend though, she admits he was brutally honest: \u2018My dad told him \u201cI always wanted a daughter-in-law\u201d, completely honest, \u201cbut I guess now I have four sons instead of three\u201d.\n\n\u2018And that was the fairytale I could have asked for. They didn\u2019t have to accept it straight away but the fact he said that proves he is trying his best.\u2019\n\nThe response to the show, and her appearance has also made her reevaluate the importance of representation on the screen.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t want to be on the show because I was Asian, I don\u2019t want to be just a box ticked \u2013 we were cast for our own merits,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018But then being on it, as first-generation born Chinese-Vietnamese heritage it does mean a lot and I\u2019ve only realised now watching it back\u2026 the messages and support form people, young kids from Birmingham with religious or ethnic backgrounds all saying \u201cI am in the same situation as you, you are me\u201d, and it\u2019s nice to hear, it makes me feel incredible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I never went on [the show] to become a role model so having people reach out if really touching, it\u2019s beautiful.\n\n\u2018And I am not saying everyone needs to come out or stay in the closet but even if my parents didn\u2019t accept me, I had an LGBT family I picked myself who will always love me.\u2019\n\nRuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK continues on Thursday nights on BBC Three.\n\nMORE: Mum saves over \u00a3400 on LEGO table for son by making it herself for just \u00a316\n\nMORE: Rebekah Vardy thanks husband Jamie for \u2018faith, trust and loyalty\u2019 amid Coleen Rooney drama", "description": "RuPaul's Drag Race UK: Sum Ting Wong praises Geri Horner amid criticism.", "authors": ["Rebecca Lewis"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRI_88188931-e1572024859346_1572026013.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
