Well, if that's the case, then the creator of Octopus Pie has something for you.\n\nOctopus Pie is a webcomic from Meredith Gran that ran from 2007 to 2017, focusing mostly on the lives of two women living in Brooklyn, New York. In 2018, Gran branched out into the world of video games with a Kickstarter for Perfect Tides, which hit its funding goal and has since launched its first proper trailer.\n\nPerfect Tides is fundamentally about the complications of teenage life, but its artstyle \u2014 done by Soren Hughes \u2014 has this LucasArts-esque retro quality to it. It's really eye-catching, as you'll see in the trailer below.\n\nThe game is due out on PC sometime next year.", "description": "Does the complications of teenage life, the misery of broken homes, and a rough childhood sound like your kind of story?
