Adam Schiff, the Intelligence Committee chairman, Eliot Engel, the Foreign Affairs Committee chairman, and Carolyn Maloney, the acting chairwoman of the Oversight Committee, said that if Kupperman didn't appear, \u201chis absence will constitute evidence that may be used against him in a contempt proceeding.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, after Kupperman failed to show up, Schiff told reporters that \"are not going to allow the White House to engage us in a lengthy game of rope-a-dope in the courts,\" adding that the White House's move to try and block officials from testifying could be used as evidence of obstruction of justice in potential articles of impeachment.\n\nCongressional committees have yet to act against Trump administration officials who aren\u2019t complying with subpoenas, but there are several options that Congress could take if members want to escalate the battle between the two branches.\n\nMargaret Taylor, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and senior editor at the national security and legal blog Lawfare, called the executive branch\u2019s stonewalling of Congress\u2019 inquiry \u201creally extraordinary.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not politics as usual, it\u2019s not how these things are traditionally played out and I think it\u2019s quite worrying and troublesome for the integrity of our constitutional democracy that there\u2019s not some amount of \u2026 recognition and accommodation by the executive branch of the legitimate prerogatives of the legislative branch,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nAccording to a Congressional Research Service Report, \u201cCongress currently relies on two formal legal mechanisms to enforce subpoenas: criminal contempt of Congress and civil enforcement of subpoenas in the federal courts.\u201d\n\nThe report, titled \u201cCongressional Subpoenas: Enforcing Executive Branch Compliance,\u201d said that criminal contempt statute can lead to \u201ccriminal punishment of the witness in the form of incarceration, a fine, or both.\u201d\n\nHowever, the report states that since this option is considered \u201cpunitive,\u201d its used \u201cmainly as a deterrent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn other words, while the threat of criminal contempt can be used as leverage to encourage compliance with a specific request, a conviction does not necessarily lead to release of the information to Congress,\u201d the report said.\n\nTaylor also noted that its generally the executive branch that decides about the enforcement of criminal law.\n\n\u201cIf your executive branch is telling you not to testify, then they\u2019re not going to be punishing you criminally,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nCongress also has the option to file a lawsuit in federal district court as part of a process called \u201ccivil enforcement,\u201d the report said.\n\nThis route calls on the courts to try and force an individual to comply, however, this option could take a long time to be adjudicated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very time consuming, it doesn\u2019t always result in a timely judgement so that\u2019s sort of one avenue,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nCongress also has a third option on how to enforce its power using what\u2019s called \u201cinherent contempt power,\u201d Taylor said.\n\n\u201cThis is this idea that the congress pursuant to its constitutional authorities can essentially send out the sergeant at arms and detain people,\u201d she explained.\n\nAlthough this is something that could technically happen, and has happened historically, Taylor said, \u201cit\u2019s just not a feature of our current ... democracy right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI view it as like a very aggressive type of move that I don\u2019t, I personally think Americans are not quite ready for,\u201d she added.\n\nAccording to Taylor, fines have also been explored as a way to enforce the inherent contempt power, but she said \u201cthere\u2019s no precedent for it as far as I\u2019m aware.\u201d\n\n\"There's a lot to be worked out in terms of like, logistically how'd you do it, how you would sort of pass muster on sort of due process, it's again, uncharted territory,\" she said. \"I think it probably could be done pursuant to the Congress' inherent contempt power.''\n\nABC News' Benjamin Siegel contributed to this report.", "description": "As the Democratic-led House investigates President Donald Trump for its ongoing impeachment inquiry \u2013 his administration continues to push back.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/capitol-building-washington-file-rt-jef-191028_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
