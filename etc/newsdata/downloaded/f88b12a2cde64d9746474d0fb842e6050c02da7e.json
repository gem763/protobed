The concrete and logistics-focused technology group posted a 16 per cent year on year increase in revenue from its concrete and cement business on stronger sales volume growth and higher selling prices of ready-mix concrete in Singapore.\n\nOf the 10 construction stocks, four saw net institutional inflows in the first nine months of 2019: International Cement Group, Lum Chang Holdings, Lian Beng and Hock Lian Seng Holdings.\n\nThe 10 also averaged a 4 per cent indicative dividend yield. The stock with the highest indicative yield is Chip Eng Seng at 6 per cent, based on its annual S$0.04 per share dividend distributed in May and its closing share price of S$0.625 on Friday.\n\nMeanwhile, Boustead Projects, Chip Eng Seng and Lian Beng maintained the lowest 12-month volatility among the 10 stocks.\n\nThe average 11 per cent total return of the 10 stocks in 2019 YTD is in contrast to the 28 per cent decline in their average total returns in 2018 and after the 43 per cent gain in 2017.\n\nThese trends were likewise observed across the world and region, SGX noted. Of the approximate 3000 stocks in the Asia-Pacific that involved in both real estate development and construction, their YTD median total return was a one per cent decline, following a 20 per cent decline in 2018 and a median total return of 7 per cent in 2017, SGX added.\n\nIn Singapore, the construction sector has posted three straight quarters of growth, after 10 quarters of declines. Based on advance estimates for Q3 2019, the sector grew by 2.7 per cent year on year in July to September, extending Q1\u2019s and Q2\u2019s expansions of 2.8 per cent and 2.7 per cent respectively. This was supported by a pick-up in both public and private sector construction activities, according to the Ministry of Trade and Industry.\n\nMeanwhile, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) also estimates the city-state\u2019s construction demand \u2013 measured by the value of awarded contracts \u2013 to total around S$27-32 billion this year, comparable to the S$30.5 billion in 2018.\n\nKey ongoing or upcoming transportation construction projects in Singapore include MRT line extensions and new stations, the North-South Corridor expressway, Changi Airport Terminal 5, and the Tuas Mega Port.", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Companies & Markets - THE 10 most actively traded stocks with a construction focus on the Singapore bourse generated an average total return of 11 per cent in the year till Oct 11, amid growth in the sector. .
