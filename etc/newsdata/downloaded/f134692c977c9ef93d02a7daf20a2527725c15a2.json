Illustration: George Cruikshank\n\nEarlier this month, Verizon managed to offload Tumblr, taking what was essentially a billion-dollar write-down on a blogging platform. That might make you think that Tumblr is effectively dead. But Tumblr still has signs of life, even if its perceived economic value has cratered. Where other platforms have users that jump from trend to trend all in the interest of maximizing engagement, Tumblr can often skew more esoteric and impenetrable. While Twitter obsesses over the new Star Wars trailer or whatever, Tumblr has become enamored with a certain French mystery man.\n\nHere\u2019s the new meme.\n\nPerhaps you are wondering what this post is about. \u201ccant stop thinking about this post,\u201d one user replied. \u201ci dont think any \u2018that face you make when\u2019 type posts has prompted over 20 minutes of research in me before.\u201d I\u2019ll save you some time: The post is referencing a French man known as Tarrare, who lived around the end of the 18th century.\n\nI highly recommend you Google Tarrare and let your instincts guide you. The Wikipedia entry is very good. It\u2019s tough to sum up Tarrare in a handful of sentences, but: He was this French guy who had a medical condition known as polyphagia that caused him to always be hungry. He was constantly hungry and could and would eat literally anything and apparently he smelled like crap. His is the most egregious case of polyphagia in recorded history. According to legend, he was caught eating corpses and at one point was suspected of eating a 14-month-old.\n\nAnyway, the Squidward Tarrare post appears to have set off a small wave of renewed Tarrare learning. Everyone loves learning weird stuff about history! Tarrare\u2019s story is wild. He was a human garbage disposal who smelled terrible and confounded doctors and, I can\u2019t stress this enough, was suspected of eating a baby and when that happened the hospital staff was just like, \u201cPlease leave. We think you ate a baby. Just go.\u201d The past was different, is what I\u2019m saying. I feel richer for possessing this knowledge, and I learned about it from a bunch of memes.\n\nIn terms of meme fodder, Tarrare\u2019s got it all. There\u2019s a medical mystery that can never be solved, a potential murder that can never be solved, body horror, the risqu\u00e9 subject of masticated children, historical value so you feel like you\u2019re learning through shitposting. All of these combine for an end-of-summer online treat. Eventually someone will unlock an optimized Tarrare shitpost that will balance all of these elements and, one assumes, create a wormhole that sucks me into another dimension much like Tarrare (allegedly) scarfed down the baby.\n\nAnyway, that\u2019s what\u2019s up with all the Tarrare memes lately.", "description": "Tarrare was a French man in the late 18th century who had an insatiable appetite and is suspected of eating a baby.
