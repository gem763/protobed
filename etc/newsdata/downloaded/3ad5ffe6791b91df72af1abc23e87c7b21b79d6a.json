But EU diplomats were pessimistic about the chances of Johnson\u2019s hybrid customs proposal for the Irish border riddle.\n\n\u201cWe are not very optimistic,\u201d a senior EU diplomat told Reuters.\n\nAfter more than three years of Brexit crisis and tortuous negotiations that have claimed the scalps of two British prime ministers, Johnson will have to ratify any last-minute deal in parliament which will sit in an extraordinary session on Sunday for the first time since the 1982 Falklands War.\n\nAs EU ministers meet in Luxembourg ahead of the leaders\u2019 summit, Johnson\u2019s planned legislative agenda will be read out by Queen Elizabeth at the state opening of parliament.\n\nIf Johnson is unable to clinch a deal, an acrimonious divorce could follow that would divide the West, roil financial markets and test the cohesion of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe pound was down 0.6% at $1.2568, the day\u2019s low. Against the euro, the British currency was also 0.6% weaker at 87.76 pence. Britain will hold a budget on Nov. 6.\n\nThe main sticking point remains the border between EU member Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland: how to prevent it becoming a backdoor into the EU after Brexit without erecting controls that could undermine the 1998 peace agreement that largely ended three decades of sectarian violence.\n\nBREXIT HANGS IN BALANCE\n\nTo get a done deal, Johnson must master the complexities of the Irish border before getting the approval of Europe\u2019s biggest powers and then sell any deal to the parliament in which he has no majority and which he suspended unlawfully last month\n\nThe details of Johnson\u2019s proposals have not been published but are essentially a compromise in which Northern Ireland is formally in the United Kingdom\u2019s customs union but also informally in the EU\u2019s customs union.\n\nThe main sticking point from the EU side is customs. The EU is worried it would be impossible to ensure goods entering Northern Ireland do not end up in the EU and is concerned about the complexity of a system for charging tariffs on goods moved between Britain and Northern Ireland.\n\n\u201cSuch a hybrid customs territory like the British are proposing for Northern Ireland does not work anywhere in the world, it seems,\u201d the EU diplomat said.\n\n\u201cWith this kind of system, with two sets of rules for the same goods crossing the same border, there is more possibility for fraud and it\u2019s extremely complicated to distinguish between goods heading for Northern Ireland, or further to Ireland and the single market.\u201d\n\nIn a sign that the Brexit optimism which followed Johnson\u2019s meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar last week may have been premature, EU diplomats now say the best chance of a deal would be to keep Northern Ireland in the EU\u2019s customs union.\n\nThat would be a step too far for Johnson\u2019s Northern Irish allies, the Democratic Unionist Party, and many Brexit supporters in his party.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Ireland's Tanaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney during a press conference in London Britain May 8, 2019. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nIf he fails to strike a deal with the EU, a law passed by his opponents obliges him to seek a delay - the scenario that EU diplomats think is most likely.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s up to the Brits do decide if they will ask for an extension,\u201d European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker said in an interview with Austrian media outlet Kurier.\n\nExtension options range from as short as an extra month to half a year or longer and the other EU states would need to agree unanimously to grant it.", "description": "A deal to smooth Britain's departure from the European Union hung in the balance on Monday after diplomats indicated the bloc wanted more concessions from Prime Minister Boris Johnson and said a full agreement was unlikely this week.", "authors": ["Guy Faulconbridge", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440650395&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0MC", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
