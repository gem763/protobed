It is the last place you might expect to be dominated by cramped rental apartments, more likely associated with dense cities like New York and San Francisco.\n\nBut Ferrelview, which is just about 4 miles outside the Kansas City International Airport, has a new claim to fame: It is home to the tiniest studio apartments in the country. It also ranks No. 3 in the nation for smallest one-bedrooms, according to a new Apartment Guide analysis of all U.S. cities where the company lists apartments for rent.\n\nA \"micro-unit\" at the Museum of the City of New York is pictured in New York, N.Y. in this January 2013 photo.

CLARY/AFP/Getty Images More\n\nThe average studio apartments in the village are sized a bit larger than a school bus, at 342 square-feet, while one-bedrooms average 588 square feet \u2014 smaller than most subway cars.\n\nBehind Ferrelview, the nation\u2019s second smallest studios averaged at 345 square feet and they can be found in Shreveport, Louisiana. Ferrelview\u2019s one-bedrooms ranked behind Iowa City\u2019s 549-square-foot one-bedroom average and East Lansing, Michigan\u2019s 578-square-foot average.\n\nNew York City, meanwhile, ranked No. 7 for smallest studios, measuring at an average 444 square feet, and No. 30 for one-bedrooms, at a 666-square-foot average. San Francisco ranked No. 49 for studios, and it didn\u2019t even make the top 50 list for tiny one-bedrooms.\n\n# Smallest Studios Square Feet Average Rent Smallest One-Bedrooms Square Feet Average Rent 1 Ferrelview, MO 342 $445 Iowa City, IA 549 $945 2 Shreveport, LA 345 $745 East Lansing, MI 578 $773 3 Tucson, AZ 397 $618 Ferrelview, MO 588 $571 4 Los Vegas, NV 421 $948 Clute, TX 591 $713 5 Albuquerque, NM 422 $790 Brooklyn, NY 593 $3,115 6 Grand Rapids, MI 444 $1,020 Metairie, LA 601 $881 7 New York, NY 444 $3,424 Texarkana, AR 605 $722 8 Burbank, CA 459 $2,167 Murray, UT 606 $1,251 9 Quincy, MA 466 $2,017 Bentonville, AT 616 $822 10 Phoenix, AZ 473 $1,007 Tucson, AZ 616 $814\n\nData provided by Apartment Guide\n\nFerrelview is a hub for singles, commuters\n\nThe tiny apartments have made Ferrelview a haven for singles. More than 40% of Ferrelview adults have never been married, whereas only 30% in the state of Missouri have never been married.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Ferrelview draws a lot of young people \u2014 the village\u2019s median age is 39.2, not far from the state average of 38.4 and U.S. average age of 37.8, U.S. Census Bureau data shows.\n\nOver one-fifth of Ferrelview adults are divorced, almost double the state average, and more than one-tenth of Ferrelview residents are widowed, compared to 6.4% in Missouri. Only 25% of adults in the village are married.\n\n\u201cWe offer small, affordable apartments, which can be a draw for people getting divorced,\u201d said Tina Jackson, co-owner of Unicorn Apartments, the town\u2019s biggest rental complex boasting 152 of Ferrelview\u2019s less-than-300 rental units.\n\nApartments in town are pretty cheap\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, less than 6% of residents paid over $1,000 in monthly rent in 2017. The average monthly rent for studios is $445, $300 cheaper than studios in Shreveport, Louisiana, the runner-up for the tiniest studio.\n\n\u201cThe average rent in Ferrelview is about half of what it would be on a national average basis, so that certainly would make it attractive,\u201d said Leo Sebus, a RE/MAX Results agent in Ferrelview\u2019s Platte County.\n\nMore than 40% of Ferrelview residents live in studios or one-bedroom apartments.\n\nAnd one-bedrooms in Ferrelview cost only $571 a month on average, well below prices for one-bedrooms in Iowa City, at $945 per month on average, according to the Apartment Guide study. Iowa City holds the title of being home to the smallest one-bedrooms in the U.S.\n\nThe Unicorn Apartments, with its 246-square-foot efficiency studios, play a big part in this small village\u2019s mini-apartment ranking. Anderson House, the other large rental apartment complex in Ferrelview, offers 108 rental units, according to Redfin. One-bedrooms are 642 square feet and ask $750 a month, according to Anderson House\u2019s website.\n\nIn 2017, about 65% of Ferrelview residents were renters, while elsewhere in Missouri, only 33% rented, according to census data.", "description": "Ferrelview is home to the tiniest studio apartments in the country.", "authors": ["Sarah Paynter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Z.09wfrMRXzOuFeEZvW0nA--~B/aD0zMjgwO3c9NDkyODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/17b38d60-ec51-11e9-bfe7-17177d773a74", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
