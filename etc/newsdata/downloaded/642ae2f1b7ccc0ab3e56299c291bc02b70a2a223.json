Elizabeth Warren has inched in front of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden in the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released on Wednesday.\n\nMs. Warren of Massachusetts was the top choice of 27% of Democratic voters and independents who lean Democrat, followed by Mr. Biden at 25%.\n\nThe 2-point gap is within the survey\u2019s margin of error, but the Wednesday poll marked the first time any Democratic presidential candidate other than Mr. Biden was in front since Quinnipiac started asking the question in March.\n\n\u201cAfter trailing Biden by double digits since March in the race for the Democratic nomination, Warren catches Biden,\u201d said Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy. \u201cWe now have a race with two candidates at the top of the field, and they\u2019re leaving the rest of the pack behind.\u201d\n\nSen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont was next at 16%, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, at 7% and Sen. Kamala D. Harris of California at 3%.\n\nFormer Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former housing secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and entrepreneur Andrew Yang were all at 2%.\n\nSeven in 10 Democrats and leaners said they would be excited if Ms. Warren was the nominee, compared to 56% for Mr. Biden and 55% for Mr. Sanders.\n\nFifty percent also said they want to see the party\u2019s nominee support policies that would result in big changes but be more difficult to pass, compared to 42% who preferred that the nominee back policies with more minor changes that would be easier to pass.\n\nAnd 49% said the best way to handle health care is to implement a \u201cMedicare for All\u201d system championed by Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, compared to 44% who said the best way is to keep private insurance in place and build on Obamacare, as Mr. Biden has advocated.\n\n\u201cDig a little deeper, and the reasons behind Warren\u2019s rise become more clear. She generates a lot of excitement as a potential nominee,\u201d Mr. Malloy said. \u201cOn top of that, half of Democrats want a presidential candidate that supports big changes \u2014 even if it means things are harder along the way.\u201d\n\nAs for President Trump, 40% of registered voters overall say they approve of how he\u2019s handling his job, compared to 55% who said they disapprove.\n\nBut only 37% say he should be impeached and removed from office, compared to 57% who said he should not be impeached.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced on Tuesday that the House would formally open an inquiry that could lead to impeachment. Still, it\u2019s unclear how much has changed, other than that the committees already investigating the president will now be able to do so under the \u201cumbrella\u201d of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe survey of 1,337 registered voters nationwide was taken from Sept. 19-23 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.\n\nThe survey includes 561 Democratic voters and independents who lean Democrat, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points for that group.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
