He spoke with Mr Zelensky the day after former special counsel Robert Mueller spoke in public testimony about his report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cI will say that we do a lot for Ukraine,\u201d Mr Trump said on the phone call, according to the memorandum. \u201cWe spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are. Germany does almost nothing for you. All they do is talk and I think it\u2019s something that should really ask them about.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of the European countries are the same way so I think it\u2019s something you want to look at but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine,\u201d he continued. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s reciprocal necessarily because things are happening that are not good but the United States has been very very good to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nMr Trump then asks Mr Zelensky \u201cto do us a favour\u201d.\n\nHe begins by immediately asking for an investigation surrounding the origins of the Russia investigation that clouded the first years of his presidency, commenting on the former special counsel\u2019s \u201cincompetent performance\u201d the day prior.\n\n\u201cWhatever you can do, it\u2019s very important that you do it if that\u2019s possible,\u201d he said.\n\nThe White House released a highly edited memo (it says it\u2019s not a transcript) which shows that Trump did indeed bring up US aid to Ukraine and then asked their leader to investigate his political opponent.\n\n\n\nThis document not exculpatory, it is a smoking gun. pic.twitter.com/k6c93MRP4G \u2014 Rep.
