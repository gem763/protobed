Seven crew members are still missing.", "description": "Weather warnings are in place across Ireland and the UK for the parts of the weekend as the remnants of a former Category 5 hurricane make landfall.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/20/70/72/1000x563_cmsv2_70cc1bba-fd14-59f3-bf83-35fc2894a2b4-4207072.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
