According to it, compared to the Lok Sabha election Congress vote share has increased from 28.4% to 32% but what is more significant is that BJP vote share has sunk from 58% to 33%, a dramatic drop of 25 percentage points. If these figures hold, it is an anti-incumbency vote that has spoken loud at the ballot box.\n\nThen the question will be whether the anti-incumbency has been triggered more by the caste factor or the economy. On the former front, one problem with the anti-BJP Jat consolidation theory is that the party had got this vote as recently as in the Lok Sabha election.
