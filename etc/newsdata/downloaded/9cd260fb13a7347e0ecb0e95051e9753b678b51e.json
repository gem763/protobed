Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) on Capitol Hill, July 16, 2019. (Erin Scott/Reuters)\n\nIn a recent interview with Politico, Democratic senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona said that she\u2019d oppose nuking the Senate\u2019s legislative filibuster if Democrats were to retake the upper chamber. Not only that, but Sinema says she\u2019d like to undo what Democrats did last time they held the Senate, when they removed the supermajority requirement for confirming presidential nominees.\n\n\u201cThey will not get my vote,\u201d Sinema told Politico. \u201cIn fact, whether I\u2019m in the majority or the minority I would always vote to reinstate the protections for the minority.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s just the latest example of how Sinema isn\u2019t afraid to buck the party line and vote against her Democratic colleagues. Here\u2019s more from Politico:\n\nShe voted for [attorney general nominee William] Barr and Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and opposed attempts to roll back the Trump administration\u2019s coal deregulation regime earlier this month. It\u2019s an approach that has the potential to revive the Senate\u2019s moribund middle but has left her something of a mystery to her Democratic colleagues, even fellow moderates. . . . \u201cEveryone knows that I am very independent-minded,\u201d [Sinema] said. \u201cAnd that it\u2019s not super useful to try and convince me otherwise.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s also been willing to work across the aisle. Earlier this summer, she introduced a paid-parental-leave plan with Louisiana Republican Bill Cassidy, which would allow parents to draw forward up to $5000 from their child tax credit in the first year after the birth or adoption of a child. Many of her fellow Senate Democrats, meanwhile, are backing the FAMILY Act, which would create a new entitlement program and raise the payroll tax to fund paid-family leave, paid-parental leave, and paid personal medical leave.\n\nThe first Democrat elected to national office in Arizona in more than three decades, Sinema seems to know it makes sense to carve out a moderate path, much like West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin. But it has earned her the ire of some Democrats in Arizona, and the state\u2019s progressive caucus came close to formally censuring her last month, claiming that she\u2019s aligned herself too closely with President Trump\u2019s positions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor now, her heterodoxy hasn\u2019t seemed to cost her much. In fact, given voting patterns and public opinion in Arizona, Sinema is likely doing exactly what she needs to in order to retain support.", "description": "In a <em>Politico</em> interview, the Arizona Democrat said she also supports restoring the supermajority requirement for confirming presidential nominees.", "authors": ["Alexandra Desanctis", "Zachary Evans", "Kevin D.
