That compares favorably to an overall growth of 3.5% in jobs annually, with total open jobs nearing 6 million. Pay, however, continues to rise at a rate of approximately 2.1% annually.\n\n\u2018Today\u2019s [jobs] growth is a far cry from the blockbuster job market in 2018. Growth in job openings slowed to 3.5% in September.\u2019 \u2014Glassdoor senior economist Daniel Zhao\n\nThe top cities for pay growth are San Francisco (up 3% on the year with a $73,861 median base pay), Atlanta (also up 3% on the year with a $56,059 median base pay) and Los Angeles (up 2.8% with a $63,526 median base pay). Warehouse associates saw the fastest pay growth in September (up 6.3% on the year with a $42,864 median base pay). Glassdoor\u2019s analysis is based on millions of online jobs and salaries in major metro areas across the U.S.\n\nThe latest government snapshot of the labor market will be released Friday. The economy likely added 140,000 new jobs in September, up from 130,000 in the prior month, which should keep the U.S. unemployment rate at or near 3.7%.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s growth is a far cry from the blockbuster job market in 2018,\u201d said Glassdoor senior economist Daniel Zhao. \u201cGrowth in job openings slowed to 3.5% in September, continuing a long-running trend of modest growth in 2019.\u201d That compares to more than 10% this time last year. \u201cJob openings on Glassdoor remain just shy of the 6 million mark, indicating a tight labor market with employers still looking for increasingly scarce workers to fill their open roles,\u201d Zhao said.\n\nRead MarketWatch\u2019s Moneyist advice column on the etiquette and ethics of your financial affairs.\n\n\u201cDespite a rocky August with recession chatter near fever pitch, the labor market continues to sustain the economic expansion,\u201d the report said. \u201cCrucially, the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision in September to cut interest rates was in spite of, and not because of, the labor market. Additionally, while the trade war has negatively impacted sectors like manufacturing, consumer spending has been resilient.\u201d\n\nSoftware developers, physical therapists and physician assistants crop up frequently among the highest-paid and fastest-growing jobs in every U.S. state.\n\n\u201cThe risk, however, is that the latest and forthcoming rounds of tariffs on consumer goods could extend the trade war\u2019s impacts to the broader economy,\u201d it added. \u201cFor the time being, Glassdoor data suggests that the labor market is shrugging off trade uncertainty and continuing to plow forward and sustain the economic expansion.\u201d\n\nSoftware developers, physical therapists and physician assistants crop up frequently among the highest-paid and fastest-growing jobs in every U.S. state, according to a separate analysis by CareerBuilder, a jobs and careers site. The site analyzed government data to project the careers most likely to be lucrative and in demand. Most of these jobs require some level of college education.\n\nDon\u2019t miss: One reason wages aren\u2019t rising faster: The gutting of middle-manager positions\n\nSoftware developers had a median pay of $105,590 per year or $50.77 per hour last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics; it says there\u2019s a higher-than-average outlook for job growth (up 24% nationwide between 2016 and 2026). Physical therapists had a median pay of $87,930 per year or $42.27 per hour last year, the BLS said, and also have a higher-than-average outlook for job growth (a projected 28% increase nationwide between 2016 and 2026).\n\nHome-health and personal-care aides were among the lowest paid and fastest growing jobs in every U.S. state and Washington, D.C., and require a high-school diploma or equivalent. The median pay for these jobs was $24,060 per year or $11.57 per hour, according to the BLS. But the demand for these jobs is projected to increase by 41% between 2016 and 2026.\n\nA separate report by the U.S. News & World Report on the best jobs of the year lists software developers as No. 1.
