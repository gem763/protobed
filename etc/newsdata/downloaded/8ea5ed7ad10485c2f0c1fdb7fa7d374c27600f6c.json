Power lines have been downed. Cars have been smashed and overturned. Floodwaters are rushing through the streets of an unidentified town at nearly the height of a car roof. This is just the beginning of the storm damage in the Bahamas.\n\nHurricane Dorian, with nearly unprecedented strength, struck the northern Bahamas as a catastrophic Category 5 storm Sunday, as hundreds hunkered down in schools, churches and shelters.\n\nThe 185 mph winds have made it the second-strongest storm in the Atlantic Ocean since 1950.\n\nDorian slammed into Elbow Cay in the Abaco Islands at 12:40 p.m., and then made a second landfall near Marsh Harbour on Great Abaco Island at 2 p.m., after officials made last-minute pleas for those in low-lying areas to evacuate.\n\n\u201cCatastrophic conditions\u201d were reported in the Abaco Islands, with a storm surge of 18-23 feet, and Dorian was expected to cross Grand Bahama later in the day \u201cwith all its fury,\u201d hurricane officials said.\n\nCONTINUING COVERAGE OF HURRICANE DORIAN ON FOX NEWS CHANNEL\n\nThe hurricane was moving to the west at 5 mph.\n\nIn some parts of Abaco, \u201cyou cannot tell the difference as to the beginning of the street versus where the ocean begins,\u201d Prime Minister Hubert Minnis said.\n\nHe called it \u201cprobably the most sad and worst day of my life to address the Bahamian people,\u201d as the Nassau Guardian reported.\n\nEarlier, Minnis had warned that anyone who did not evacuate was \u201cin extreme danger and can expect a catastrophic consequence.\u201d\n\nThe government opened 14 shelters across the Bahamas. Dozens ignored evacuation orders, officials said.\n\n\u201cThe end could be fatal,\u201d Assistant Police Commissioner Samuel Butler said. \u201cWe ask you, we beg you, we plead with you to get to a place of safety.\u201d\n\nDorian could affect as many as 73,000 residents and 21,000 homes.\n\nThe archipelago has been no stranger to hurricanes. Homes are required to have metal reinforcements for roof beams to withstand winds into the upper limits of a Category 4 hurricane, and compliance is generally tight for those who can afford it. Risks are higher in poorer neighborhoods, with wooden homes in low-lying areas.\n\nAfter the Bahamas, the slow-crawling storm is forecast to turn sharply and skirt toward the U.S. coast, staying just off Florida and Georgia on Tuesday and Wednesday and then buffeting South Carolina and North Carolina on Thursday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch for Florida\u2019s East Coast from Deerfield Beach north to the Volusia and Brevard county line.\n\nThe same area was put under a storm surge watch. Lake Okeechobee was under a tropical storm watch.", "description": "Homes are missing parts of their roofs. Power lines have been downed. Cars have been smashed and overturned.
