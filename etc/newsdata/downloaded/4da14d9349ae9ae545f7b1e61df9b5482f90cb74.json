At the end of the term the parents are repaid their loan and 10 per cent of any increase in the property\u2019s value. If the property has lost money, they get back a percentage of their original contribution.\n\nThe children retain full ownership of the property and are eligible for any first-home buyer incentive or stamp duty concessions.\n\nSafe way to gift money\n\nThe parents, who have the option of gifting their loan, are able to protect their contribution against unforeseen developments, such as a child's relationship breakdown.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a safe way for parents to gift money,\u201d says Torelli, who adds the structure has been stress-tested by lawyers to cover different scenarios.\n\nCBA has a scheme that allows multiple borrowers to purchase a property while keeping their finances separate. It involves a maximum of two applications per property but each loan can be for different amounts, with different loan types, duration and payment structures.\n\nAll applicants must be owners of the property, demonstrate they can manage repayments for their loan and guarantee each other\u2019s loans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther popular ways of parents helping their children include:\n\nGifting: This is the most popular way for parents to help their children with deposits or other costs. Lawyers advise both parties put in writing the transaction in case of any future tax or legal complications.\n\n\u201cThe gift has to be carefully documented and should be cross-referenced in the will,\u201d says Anna Hacker, national manager of estate planning for Australian Unity Trustees.\n\nHacker warns most gifts causing legal problems have been on a handwritten note or a message on an iPhone.\n\n\u201cIt must clearly show that every party to the agreement knew what they were doing. Otherwise there is the potential for huge arguments,\" she says.\n\nPitfalls of joint ownership\n\nLoans: Parents and children need to set out terms and conditions for repayment, including length of loan, repayment date, amount of repayments, what happens if there is a default and any other agreed terms. Banks will assess a parental loan to be a financial liability when considering how much it will lend to the child.\n\nRegistering a loan against a property turns an unsecured loan into a secured, which means the property could be sold to repay the debt.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cMake sure it is carefully documented so that the \u2018mum and dad\u2019 loan is not second fiddle to some more formal loan with a bank,\u201d says Hacker.\n\n\u201cIf the child is in a relationship that breaks down, it will be very hard to establish there was a formal loan unless there is an agreement setting out terms and conditions for it to be paid back,\u201d she says.\n\nJoint ownership: Parents need to consider potential capital gains implications and any impact on their eligibility for social security.\n\nA property purchased by home-owning parents will be considered their investment and subject to tax when sold. It could also force parents to postpone retirement unless they can prove to the lender that they can afford repayments from their retirement income.\n\n\u201cThis offers a lot more protection for parents because their name is on the property title,\u201d Hacker says. \"But parents need to seek legal and financial advice, set out terms and consider all the implications.\"\n\nActing as a guarantor: This means in the event of non-payment the parents become liable for the mortgage payment or settlement of any outstanding debt . This could affect the parents\u2019 future borrowing capacity as it needs to be declared as a liability on any future loan application.\n\nAgreements can include a term removing the parents from the loan when the child reaches a certain income level.\n\n\u201cIt is far less common than lending money,\" says Hacker. That\u2019s because parents are concerned about what happens if there is a big interest rate rise or someone loses their job and struggles to meet repayments.\n\nShe says this does not require parents to offer anything upfront. It's particularly attractive to well-heeled parents who could easily cover any losses.\n\nParents and their children should update their wills to prevent any potential problems. For example, does the contribution to a property constitute an early inheritance? Is the deal fair to other children in the family?\n\nThe child should also make a will so that in the event of their death, the money can be returned to the parent.", "description": "Want to help your offspring into their own home?
