Ralph Foster\n\n\u201cA combination of climate change and over-abstraction to supply our ever-rising demand for water has left chalk streams like the River Misbourne in a dire state.\u201d\n\nBob Olden, founder of the Misbourne River Action group, told The Independent: \u201cThe Misbourne is dry for an exceptional amount of its length at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe same thing happened in 2017, he said, though not to the same extent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unusual, and possibly getting to be more frequent.\u201d\n\nHe said that a generation ago, several sections of the river were regularly used as swimming spots, but also added that low water levels had been a problem centuries ago.\n\n\u201cMill owners in 1774 were complaining it had dried up on one occasion,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we also have plenty of records of floods. The river couldn\u2019t possibly sustain mills today.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an indication climate change is making things worse.\n\n\u201cFlash floods are no good. We need the water to settle down through the soil to reach the aquifer. Lots of rain doesn\u2019t necessarily help. We really need the rain to come during the winter recharge period rather than the summer because otherwise the grass and the trees mop it all up.\u201d\n\nHe also said since the 1990s water abstraction had decreased substantially, indicating the river could be getting drier despite less water being taken from it.\n\nCalling for a long-term water strategy for the southeast, Mr Olden said the threat of the river\u2019s disappearance represented the \u201closs of something nice to have. It\u2019s the difference between a ditch that\u2019s overgrown and full of Tesco trollies, or a nice stream full of fish.\u201d\n\nConservationists have called for government action to avoid \u201cirreparable damage\u201d to Britain\u2019s surviving chalk streams, and avoid taking any further water from them.\n\nMr Beechey said: \u201cThese rare rivers have suffered at the hands of abstraction, which has increased significantly ever since the end of the Second World War to supply water to an ever-growing population.\n\n\u201cCoupled with the impacts of climate change, many of the Chilterns\u2019 chalk streams have become progressively smaller, shorter and have dried up more and more frequently since the 1990s.\n\n\u201cThis trend is likely to continue and our chalk streams sacrificed unless something can be done to reduce the pressure they are under.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cWith the government\u2019s growth agenda set to significantly drive up overall demand for water in the southeast in future, there is an urgent need to for new strategic water resources to be developed in the south to meet this demand but also so damaging levels of abstraction can be brought to an end.\u201d\n\nAn Environment Agency spokesperson said: \u201cWe had a member of staff visit sections of the Misbourne and we\u2019re planning on attempting to relocate fish from the pools of water that remain in sections of the river today.\u201d\n\nThe plight of the UK\u2019s chalk streams has an unlikely hero in punk star Feargal Sharkey of The Undertones.\n\nSharkey has tweeted numerous photographs of the UK\u2019s drying waterways, including the Misbourne, and criticised the government\u2019s failure to take stronger action to address the problems.\n\nAdditional reporting by SWNS", "description": "A picturesque small river in the Chilterns has dried up, leaving hundreds of fish and shrimp dead, with experts and local action groups blaming climate change for reduced water levels.
