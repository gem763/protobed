In 2018, the country imported about 5.2 million tons of seafood, rising nearly 7 percent year-on-year.\n\nIn the first eight months of this year, the country's seafood imports surged more than 24 percent year-on-year in terms of value, Yu noted.\n\n\"The increase indicated rapid growth in demand for high-quality seafood,\" Yu said. \"On the other hand, it shows China's commitment to the multilateral trade system and firm stance toward free trade.\"\n\nFounded in 1996, the CFSE is held annually and is one of the world's largest fishery expos. The expo this year attracted about 1,600 exhibiting enterprises from 53 countries and regions around the world.", "description": "China will continue to open its fast-growing seafood sector to the world and support free trade in the industry, an official said Wednesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/30/5db94b86a310cf3e97a39210.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
