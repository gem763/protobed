Last quarter, the Large Cap Growth style ranked sixth. It gets our Neutral rating, which is based on an aggregation of ratings of 24 ETFs and 675 mutual funds in the Large Cap Growth style as of July 15, 2019. See a recap of our 2Q19 Style Ratings here.\n\nFigures 1 and 2 show the five best and worst rated ETFs and mutual funds in the style. Not all Large Cap Growth style ETFs and mutual funds are created the same. The number of holdings varies widely (from 21 to 576). This variation creates drastically different investment implications and, therefore, ratings.\n\nGet the best fundamental research\n\nInvestors seeking exposure to the Large Cap Growth style should buy one of the Attractive-or-better rated ETFs or mutual funds from Figures 1 and 2.\n\nOur Robo-Analyst technology[1] empowers our unique ETF and mutual fund rating methodology, which leverages our rigorous analysis of each fund\u2019s holdings.[2] We think advisors and investors focused on prudent investment decisions should include analysis of fund holdings in their research process for ETFs and mutual funds.\n\nFigure 1: ETFs with the Best & Worst Ratings \u2013 Top 5\n\n* Best ETFs exclude ETFs with TNAs less than $100 million for inadequate liquidity.\n\nSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings\n\nFive ETFs , JQUA, BERN, , ) are excluded from Figure 1 because their total net assets (TNA) are below $100 million and do not meet our liquidity minimums.\n\nFigure 2: Mutual Funds with the Best & Worst Ratings \u2013 Top 5\n\n* Best mutual funds exclude funds with TNAs less than $100 million for inadequate liquidity.\n\nSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings\n\nInvesco Dynamic Large Cap Growth ETF (PWB) is the top-rated Large Cap Growth ETF and Fidelity SAI U.S. Quality Index Fund (FUQIX) is the top-rated Large Cap Growth mutual fund. PWB earns an Attractive rating and FUQIX earns a Very Attractive rating.\n\nClearBridge Large Cap Growth ESG ETF (LRGE) is the worst rated Large Cap Growth ETF and PACE Large Company Growth Equity Investments (PLAAX) is the worst rated Large Cap Growth mutual fund. LRGE earns a Neutral rating and PLAAX earns a Very Unattractive rating.\n\nThe Danger Within\n\nBuying a fund without analyzing its holdings is like buying a stock without analyzing its business and finances. Put another way, research on fund holdings is necessary due diligence because a fund\u2019s performance is only as good as its holdings\u2019 performance. Don\u2019t just take our word for it, see what Barron\u2019s says on this matter.\n\nPERFORMANCE OF HOLDINGs = PERFORMANCE OF FUND\n\nAnalyzing each holding within funds is no small task. Our Robo-Analyst technology enables us to perform this diligence with scale and provide the research needed to fulfill the fiduciary duty of care. More of the biggest names in the financial industry (see At BlackRock (NYSE: ), Machines Are Rising Over Managers to Pick Stocks) are now embracing technology to leverage machines in the investment research process. Technology may be the only solution to the dual mandate for research: cut costs and fulfill the fiduciary duty of care. Investors, clients, advisors and analysts deserve the latest in technology to get the diligence required to make prudent investment decisions.\n\nFigures 3 and 4 show the rating landscape of all Large Cap Growth ETFs and mutual funds.\n\nFigure 3: Separating the Best ETFs from the Worst Funds\n\nSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings\n\nFigure 4: Separating the Best Mutual Funds from the Worst Funds\n\nSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Kyle Guske II covering: BlackRock Inc, SPDR MFS Systematic Growth Equity, VictoryShares Dividend Accelerator, Oppenheimer Russell 1000 Quality Factor.
