He has variously been described as a \u201cstupid, sanctimonious dwarf\u201d (Conservative MP Simon Burns) to \u201cone of the great Speakers\u201d (Tom Watson, deputy leader of the Labour party).\n\nBercow was born in 1963 in Edgware to Jewish parents. His father was a taxi driver and he attended Finchley Manorhill comprehensive school in North Finchley before going to Essex University to study government.\n\nPlay Video 8:09 Tearful John Bercow reveals he will step down as Speaker by 31 October \u2013 video\n\nAt university he was a member of the far-right Conservative pressure group the Monday Club and secretary of its immigration and repatriation committee. He had left the group by the age of 20 and has since described his views at the time as \u201cboneheaded\u201d. (He later led calls for Tory MPs to be banned from being members of the group.)\n\nBercow graduated with first-class honours and worked in banking before entering politics \u2013 first as a councillor in Lambeth and then as a special adviser to chief secretary to the Treasury, Jonathan Aitken. After standing for parliament twice unsuccessfully, Bercow was finally elected a Conservative MP for Buckingham in 1997.\n\nHe joined the Tory frontbench two years later as a spokesman for education and employment under Theresa May and later a spokesman for home affairs under Ann Widdecombe. He arrived in the shadow cabinet in 2001 when Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith made him shadow chief secretary to the Treasury.\n\nAround the early 2000s, Bercow\u2019s politics began to become more socially liberal. In 2002 he married his wife Sally Illman, a Labour supporter, who stood to be a Labour councillor in Westminster in 2010. The same year as his marriage, Bercow resigned from the front bench after rebelling to vote for Labour plans to allow unmarried gay and heterosexual couples to adopt children. He told his constituency association in his new year\u2019s message that year that voters saw the Tories as \u201cracist, sexist, homophobic and anti-youth\u201d.\n\nPlay Video 2:58 MPs praise John Bercow for his service as Speaker \u2013 video\n\nBercow was elected as Speaker of the House of Commons in 2009 and quickly provoked accusations of anti-Tory bias. In 2011, the Tory MP Rob Wilson calculated that Conservatives had been slapped down by Bercow 257 times, compared with 107 for Labour since the 2010 election.\n\nPrior to the 2015 general election, Bercow was applauded by Labour MPs in the House of Commons after he survived an attempt by his own party to oust him. A motion for there to be a secret ballot to reselect a Speaker when parliament returned, tabled by then leader of the House of Commons, William Hague, was defeated by 228 to 202.\n\nDespite Bercow\u2019s historic Euroscepticism \u2013 he has been a supporter of the Bruges Group \u2013 allegations of bias quickly turned to accusations of wilful obstruction following the Brexit vote. In 2017 the Sunday Telegraph reported that he had admitted to students that in the EU referendum he had voted to remain, although Bercow insisted he would be \u201cscrupulous in ensuring that both sides of the argument are always heard\u201d.\n\nThe Speaker was accused of being \u201chugely political and out of line\u201d when he said Donald Trump was unfit to address MPs in Westminster because the House of Commons was opposed to \u201cracism and to sexism and our support for equality before the law and an independent judiciary\u201d.\n\nBercow\u2019s decisions have been key obstacles to Conservative government attempts to push through Brexit. In March this year Bercow pre-empted an attempt by Theresa May to bring a third vote on her withdrawal deal to parliament, citing a convention which dates back to 1604 that says a vote on a motion that is \u201csubstantially the same\u201d as a rejected motion should not be permitted. Last month he described Boris Johnson\u2019s decision to prorogue parliament as a \u201cconstitutional outrage\u201d.\n\nSuggestions by friends that Bercow would resign this summer \u2013 after he had served 10 years in office \u2013 first came in the wake of a damning report by Dame Laura Cox, which said bullying and harassment in parliament were being ignored due to a tradition of \u201cdeference and silence\u201d. The report followed a Newsnight investigation that claimed Bercow bullied his former private secretaries, Angus Sinclair and Kate Emms, something he denied.\n\nBercow made no public confirmation that he planned to leave and then changed his mind after the UK failed to leave the EU in March. He told the Guardian it was not \u201csensible to vacate the chair\u201d while there were major issues before parliament.\n\nIt is not clear what Bercow plans for his life after the Speaker\u2019s chair. Asked in 2011 when he planned to stand down, Bercow said he\u2019d do the job for a maximum of another nine years. \u201cI\u2019m enjoying the role and trying to make a difference \u2013 and then I will disappear,\u201d he said.", "description": "The Speaker has enraged former Conservative colleagues by drifting to the left during his political career", "authors": ["Frances Perraudin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3fd0d4c607cfc8738f4e04ff3952911b13ca65f/0_181_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bcfd0f302ae4acd02ede6c56ff52c5d1", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
