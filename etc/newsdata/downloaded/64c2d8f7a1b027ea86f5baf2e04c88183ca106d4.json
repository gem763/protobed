So what do you need if \"the job\" is win a ceremonial cake plate and get crowned Canada's best home baker? Great question. We asked the bakers of The Great Canadian Baking Show Season 3 for the one kitchen tool they can't live without.\n\nLiam\n\nI can't live without a spatula and food processor. It just makes life so much easier.\n\nMary Lou\n\nThe one kitchen tool I cannot live without is probably my mixer. It's big and it makes everything that I want.\n\nIf there's one thing this GCBS bakers love, it's a stand mixer. (The Great Canadian Baking Show)\n\nAndrea\n\nThe one kitchen tool I can't live without is my mixer. I love my mixer so much, I actually have two of them. I have my big red and my baby grey.\n\nJodi\n\nThe one kitchen tool I can't live without is my wooden spoon. And also my whisk.\n\nColin\n\nI can't live without a French-tipped rolling pin. I feel like I have more control with it, and I like that it's French. It sounds fancy.\n\nNever underestimate the value of a good spatula.

Sometimes when I'm making batters and doughs I double them, and it's hard to do by hand. I'm kind of big and strong, but after a while, your arm still gets tired, so that's when a stand mixer really comes in handy.\n\nChris\n\nI can't live without my trusty spatula. I use that thing for everything.\n\nIs it fancier than a regular rolling pin? Well it has French right in the name, so...

One that's got a connected body to the top rubber part. If it comes apart when you're baking, that's just a mess, so that's something that it's really important for me to have.", "description": "What\u2019s better than a stand mixer?
