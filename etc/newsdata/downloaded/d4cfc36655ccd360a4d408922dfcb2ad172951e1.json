I don\u2019t know what better way to frame it. I can try in Spanish, but I ain\u2019t really that good at Spanish.\u201d pic.twitter.com/itJIROvLG1 \u2014 Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) October 27, 2019\n\n\u201cThe reality is, we f---ing suck right now,\u201d Green said, via The Athletic. \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll get better. We\u2019ll continue working at it and trying to get better, but we\u2019re just not that good right now. I don\u2019t know what better way to frame it for you or how to tell it. I can try in Spanish, but I ain\u2019t really that good at Spanish. That\u2019s really the best way I can tell it to you right now.\u201d\n\nNow, it\u2019s easy to understand why the Warriors are struggling. The team this year looks nothing like the one that reached the NBA Finals five years in a row. Kevin Durant is now with the Brooklyn Nets, and Klay Thompson is likely out for the season after suffering an ACL injury in the Finals. The team is full of new and inexperienced players, led essentially by only Green and Stephen Curry \u2014 who is now suddenly the oldest player in their locker room.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat turnover, Warriors coach Steve Kerr said, has definitely been an adjustment.\n\nSteve Kerr has been ramping down expectations and warning of what will likely be a jarring new reality for the rebuilding Warriors this season: \u201cI realize I\u2019m making plenty of excuses. But they\u2019re real.\u201d pic.twitter.com/04GpDXldNk \u2014 Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) October 27, 2019\n\n\u201cAs I said, we don\u2019t have a sense of who we are as a team yet,\u201d Kerr said, via The Athletic. \u201cWe haven\u2019t established much. We\u2019re playing without centers, and we\u2019re playing with nine players. I realize I\u2019m making plenty of excuses, but they\u2019re real. We had just an incredible amount of roster turnover and lost guys who had years and years of service in this league and institutional knowledge.\n\n\u201cWe have to build that back up with these young guys, and it takes time. This is not easy.\u201d\n\nSunday, though, was particularly rough.\n\nThe Thunder led the entire game and mounted a 33-point lead at halftime \u2014 the largest deficit for the Warriors organization since 1997. Golden State shot just 32.6 percent from the field and went 5 of 33 from the 3-point line, too. Guard D\u2019Angelo Russell was even ejected in the third quarter, picking up two technical fouls after arguing with an official after he felt he should have drawn a foul.\n\nIt was a mess all around.\n\nNow, the Warriors still have plenty of time to turn things around. There are still 80 games left on their schedule, starting with a matchup against the Pelicans in New Orleans on Monday night.\n\nStill, the rebuild mode the team has been forced to shift into isn\u2019t any fun, Green said.\n\nDraymond Green on the Warriors rebuild: \u201cI guess just about everybody except Tim Duncan have been through it. But it sucks.\u201d pic.twitter.com/MryZOPU9es \u2014 Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) October 27, 2019\n\n\u201cIt sucks,\u201d Green said, via The Athletic. \u201cBut, I guess just about everybody except Tim Duncan have been through it. But it sucks, pretty bad.\u201d\n\nAnd, he said, it\u2019s far worse than he could have imagined.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have this feeling that it would be like this,\u201d Green said, via The Athletic. \u201cYou have to figure s--t wouldn\u2019t be the same, but I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d be getting our a-- kicked like this. It\u2019s pretty bad.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Warriors suffered their second straight blowout loss of the season on Sunday, leaving Draymond Green with only one way to describe the state of the organization.", "authors": ["Ryan Young"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5Asdm4aGZP1mA1F3tlPbxQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JsVwOyouq8u6BC_P4JHMYw--~B/aD0yMTE3O3c9MzE3NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/1f4288e0-f91e-11e9-b9dd-16720774245d", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
