In an initial statement, Gillis sort of tried to apologise. \u201cI\u2019m a comedian who pushes boundaries,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cI sometimes miss ... My intention is never to hurt anyone but I am trying to be the best comedian I can be and sometimes that requires risks.\u201d\n\nAfter facing further criticism, and his eventual firing, Gillis doubled-down on his non-apology. \u201cIt feels ridiculous for comedians to be making public statements but here we are. I\u2019m a comedian who was funny enough to get SNL. That can\u2019t be taken away.\u201d While some people have accepted Gillis\u2019 statement, sometimes, a bad apology warrants correction.\n\nWhen you receive a shitty apology from someone, whether it be for a small accident or the use of inappropriate language justified as \u201ccomedy,\u201d it\u2019s important to make your point clear \u2014 and realise that not everyone is deserving of forgiveness.\n\nPoint out the flaw in their apology\n\nIf you\u2019ve just received an apology\u2060, and still believe that your feelings haven\u2019t been heard or acknowledged, let the person know exactly why you feel unresolved. Perhaps you felt like they qualified the apology (\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but..\u201d) or that it felt mostly insincere (\u201cI\u2019m sorry that you felt this way\u201d). If you hear any language like this \u2014 or a flimsy excuse for their behaviour (\u201cI\u2019m a comedian who pushes boundaries\u201d) \u2014 calmly state why their apology feels unsatisfactory and reiterate your point.\n\nA genuine apology should feel straightforward and express that person\u2019s responsibility for their actions and a commitment not to make the same mistake in the future. (\u201cI fucked up\u201d is a good start.) And be careful to listen for an explanation that doesn\u2019t absolve them of responsibility.\n\n\u201cI always explain when I apologise, how else is my apology supposed to be genuine?\u201d one user on a recent Reddit thread writes. \u201cI want you to understand why I did what I did, what led me to it, and why/how I understand that I was wrong. Intent matters with mistakes.\u201d\n\nYou should never experience any doubt about its authenticity, either. Their tone during an apology should convey its sincerity; if it feels robotic, it\u2019s probably not the apology you want. If it feels remorseful and expresses regret, perhaps it\u2019s genuine, but only you can be the judge of that.\n\nAllow them an opportunity to apologise again\n\nPerhaps the person who owes you an apology wasn\u2019t aware of how they hurt or offended you or they didn\u2019t hear everything you expressed. Once you\u2019ve reiterated your point, you\u2019ll have to afford them the chance to actually apologise (and perhaps, better understand how and why you feel unresolved).\n\nOf course, some mistakes shouldn\u2019t be that hard for a person to understand (ie. racist jokes), but if someone genuinely seems clueless about what they did wrong, give them a chance to learn, if you\u2019re feeling generous.\n\nOn the flip side, keep in mind that you should also be provided time to consider forgiving them; it doesn\u2019t always happen overnight or within a single phone call, so don\u2019t allow someone to pressure you to resolve a dispute immediately.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to forgive them\n\nLet\u2019s keep in mind one thing: Whether it\u2019s a bad apology or a heartfelt, genuine one, you are not obliged to forgive anyone. If it\u2019s a small accident, however, like a stranger bumped into you and spilled your coffee, a quick, sincere apology should suffice.\n\n\u201cIf someone goes through the trouble to actually, sincerely apologise, don\u2019t be a douche about it forever and never forgive them,\u201d u/elaphros writes. \u201cGetting pissed off ok. Holding onto a grudge is not.\u201d Forgiveness in this example should be immediate, or if they\u2019re a total dick, a middle finger is effective, too.\n\nOn the other hand, you do not have to accept someone\u2019s apology for a larger transgression, like a record of comedic jokes that use racial slurs or mock accents, for example. You\u2019re entitled to decide when something that bothers you crosses the line, particularly when you feel that a person\u2019s apology stops short of real remorse (or that their history doesn\u2019t provide enough evidence that they won\u2019t make a similar mistake in the future).\n\nDoes this mean they should be scorned from society forever? Probably not, but forgiveness should be earned. And it\u2019s your decision when to give it.", "description": "In the span of five days, Saturday Night Live hired and fired comedian Shane Gillis after his use of sexist, homophobic, racist language \u2014 including comments that incorporated racial slurs and mocking a Chinese accent \u2014 all came to light on social media.
