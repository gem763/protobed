I think the ground had a lot to do with it,\" a clearly devastated Dettori, 48, told a scrum of reporters after dismounting Enable in the parade ring.\n\nJUST WATCHED Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe: Europe's richest horse race Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH\n\n'Unbelievable filly'\n\nBred by Saudi prince Khalid Abdullah's Juddmonte Farms bloodstock operation, Enable has also won the Epsom Oaks, the Irish Oaks, two runnings of the prestigious King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot and the Breeders' Cup Turf at Churchill Downs in Kentucky\n\nComing into the Arc she was unbeaten in her previous 12 races -- all under Dettori -- and is widely expected to be retired with a record of 13 wins from 15 races.\n\n\"We don't love her any less,\" said Teddy Grimthorpe, racing manager to owner Khalid Abdullah, who will make the final decision on Enable's future.\n\n\"The expectation is so enormous with these things, there is a wave of goodwill, and the good wishes that we all had was just unbelievable really and therefore it was not quite what we hoped, we've got to be honest about.\n\n\"But how can we complain? She's been an unbelievable filly.\"\n\nGosden told Aly Vance for CNN's Winning Post: \"I'm very proud of her. Things don't always go like clockwork. I was disappointed when the rain came in the night, I just thought, 'oh, pity.' I knew it would tap her stamina but she was beaten by a very good horse on the day.\"\n\nWaldgeist, who has won a number of big races in France including this year's Prix Ganay, is co-owned by German Dietrich von Boetticher.\n\n\"We didn't expect any horses to beat Enable, she's so superior but all you can do is try,\" he told a news conference at Longchamp.\n\n\"But Andre believed so we believed.\"\n\nIt was a record eighth Arc title for the Chantilly-based Fabre, 73, and a first for the 26-year-old Boudot.\n\nFrench Derby winner Sottsass was third under jockey Cristian Demuro for trainer Jean-Claude Rouget.\n\nThe Arc is Europe's richest horse race with a purse of about $5.5 million and a first prize of $3.1 million, but its history and status as a test of speed and stamina for the best middle-distance horses over three years of age makes it an icon of the sport.", "description": "Shock and a large dose of disappointment fell on Longchamp as favorite Enable came up agonizingly short in her quest for an historic third straight Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe title.", "authors": ["Rob Hodgetts At Longchamp"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191006103409-waldgeist-wins-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
