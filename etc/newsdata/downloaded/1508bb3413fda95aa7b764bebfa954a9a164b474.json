but the Irish government said it would support another extension.\n\nAhead of the meeting, Mr Varadkar said he would be asking Boris Johnson how he plans to get a Brexit deal through Parliament when he does not have a majority in the House of Commons.\n\nBut Mr Johnson told reporters in Dublin that he was \"absolutely undaunted\" about what might happen in Parliament in the coming days.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Leo Varadkar: \"The stakes are high\"\n\nHe also said he had looked at the consequences of a no-deal Brexit, and \"wanted to find a deal\".\n\n\"There are two tasks we simply have to do - we must restore Stormont and we must come out [of the EU] on 31 October, or else permanent damage will be done in the UK to trust in our democratic system,\" he added.\n\nMr Varadkar said the Irish government \"cannot and will not replace legal guarantee with a promise\".\n\nWhy is the meeting taking place?\n\nThe taoiseach invited Mr Johnson to Dublin two months ago, shortly after he was installed in Downing Street, to discuss Brexit.\n\nThe two leaders have very different views on how the deadlock should be resolved.\n\nThe Irish government maintains that the backstop - the mechanism to avoid an Irish hard border - is needed in any withdrawal agreement, because of decisions made by the UK.\n\nBut Mr Johnson has said he will not sign up to a deal unless the backstop is removed, because it is \"anti-democratic\".\n\nAhead of the visit to Dublin, the prime minister said he would use the meeting to raise potential alternatives with Mr Varadkar.\n\nHe said he wanted to discuss the possibility of an all-Ireland food standards zone as part of a solution to replace the Brexit backstop.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption BBC News NI's political reporter Jayne McCormack explains why the border is an issue\n\nThere is also speculation that the government could propose returning to a backstop that would only apply to Northern Ireland, with the possibility of a role for the Stormont assembly before it could be triggered or new EU rules would take effect.\n\nIt was offered by the EU at an early stage in the Brexit negotiations, but it was dismissed by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP).\n\nHowever, Mr Johnson has lost his working majority in the Commons, meaning the influence the DUP wields in Westminster is vastly reduced.\n\nThe two leaders are holding a private meeting first before their officials join for further discussions, before Mr Johnson heads back to Westminster.\n\nMeanwhile, Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith has denied speculation that he would leave his position, following the resignation of Amber Rudd at the weekend.\n\nIn a tweet, on Monday morning, he said he intended to continue to \"work flat out\" for Northern Ireland.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @JulianSmithUK Media speculation about me doing anything other than continuing to represent & work flat out for Northern Ireland is v wide of mark @NIOgov \u2014 Julian Smith MP (@JulianSmithUK) September 9, 2019 Report\n\nWill Parliament be suspended this week?\n\nIt is due to happen at some stage between Monday and Thursday and MPs are not set to return until mid-October.\n\nBefore Parliament is prorogued, MPs will debate progress reports updating them on efforts to restore the Stormont assembly, which collapsed more than two years ago.\n\nThe government has said it is planning to intensify efforts to kick start power-sharing, because there are concerns about the impact of prorogation on Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith has said unless power-sharing talks succeed before Brexit happens, direct rule powers from Westminster will need to be implemented at pace.\n\nMeanwhile, legislation designed to delay a no-deal Brexit and force the prime minister to request an extension to the deadline from the EU will receive royal assent later.\n\nHowever, the prime minister has said he will not ask the EU for another extension, so it is unclear what might happen next.\n\nThe government will move another motion asking MPs to vote for a general election on Monday too, but it is unlikely to pass because opposition parties have agreed to reject the demand, saying Mr Johnson is trying to force through a no-deal exit.\n\nWhat is the backstop?\n\nThe backstop is a key piece of the Brexit deal dictating what will happen to the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\n\nIt is a last resort that guarantees a frictionless border if no better solution is devised in time - by maintaining close ties between the UK and the EU until such a solution is found.\n\nThe Irish government has insisted if it took effect it would only be temporary, but Boris Johnson has said he will not sign up to a deal unless the backstop is removed from the withdrawal agreement.\n\nRead more here.", "description": "Leo Varadkar says his meeting in Dublin with Boris Johnson is a chance to find \"common ground\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07mvhy8.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
