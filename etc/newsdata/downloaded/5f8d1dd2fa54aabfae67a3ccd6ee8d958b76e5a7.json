I was hoping to travel to China this year as I worked hard. I thought a runner up this year was also going to travel like last year, but unfortunately it was changed,\" he said.\n\n\"Hopefully next year I will make it,\" he added.\n\nZhang Fan, director of the Confucius Institute at the University of Namibia, told Xinhua that this year's competition was tough as most of the students came up with different acts signaling they are evolving and venturing into other Chinese cultural acts.\n\n\"This year we saw a number of students feel comfortable playing different instruments and also perform the lion dance, which had not been done before,\" he added.\n\nWith the Chinese language learning continuously growing in leaps and bounds in Namibia, Chinese ambassador Zhang Yiming earlier in May told Xinhua that the Confucius Institute is planning to introduce the Chinese language to more schools in Namibia.\n\nThe Confucius Institute at the UNAM annually hosts the Chinese proficiency competitions both in college and secondary school level, with summer camps to China.\n\nThe 12th Chinese Bridge proficiency competition for secondary school students in Windhoek was held on Sept 12. Nine talented students from different secondary schools participated in the event, where they had to undergo three rounds of the competition so as to be crowned the overall winner.\n\nXinhua", "description": "An emotional, 16-year-old Eva Kahili, with tears smudging her makeup, had her dream come true to represent Namibia in China, following her triumph at the 12th Chinese Bridge proficiency competition for secondary school students held in Windhoek recently.", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
