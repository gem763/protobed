But with no supervision to speak of, these off-label uses are creating controversy and wreaking havoc on the health of those unlucky enough to be within earshot.\n\nThe LRAD (generally pronounced \u201cL-rad,\u201d short for Long Range Acoustic Device) is a brand-name targeted loudspeaker that sends clear announcements and warnings as far as 5,500 meters\u2014about the width of the Hudson River plus Manhattan in some places.\n\nFor the U.S. Army, this is a boon to communication in the field. But others regard it as a dangerous sonic weapon.\n\nAccording to Steve Elliott, project officer of Combat Armaments and Protection Systems of the U.S. Army, soldiers can use LRADs to warn people away from base perimeters in Afghanistan, or to ward off potential car bombers in Iraq. During Haiti\u2019s 2010 earthquake-relief efforts, LRADs were used to direct ships in and out of the main port, said Jeff Drobik, engineering team lead at the Army\u2019s Combat Capabilities Development Command Armament Center.\n\n\u201cThe big capability is\u2026 communication at some standoff distance where neither side\u2014neither the Army nor the people they\u2019re trying to communicate with\u2014feel like they present a heightened threat to one another,\u201d Elliott said in an interview with The Daily Beast.\n\nThe Army is a repeat customer of the San Diego-based LRAD Corp. In August, Elliott\u2019s team put in a $14.8 million contract for devices, which is the company\u2019s largest domestic order since the system was invented in 2003. By next year, the Army is hoping to send 2,434 LRADs abroad, according to Elliott. The devices start at $30,000 apiece for smaller models.\n\n\u201cThe Army would like us to issue them faster than we can buy them,\u201d said Elliott.\n\nMILITARY ROOTS\n\nLRAD Corp.\u2019s other clients include the U.S. Navy, the National Guard, and the U.S. Air Force. FEMA once used the device during an infrastructure project. Miners have used the warning system to deter birds from endangering themselves on work sites. In Mill Valley, California, the fire chief recently installed LRADs and a cloud-based software system so that in the event of a disaster, warnings won\u2019t depend on standard communication lines.\n\nYet, as LRADs flood the market and trickle down from the U.S. Army to municipal law-enforcement agencies across the country, they\u2019ve made headlines as devices used to control people\u2014a use case that can come with some dangerous side effects.\n\nMuch to its creator\u2019s chagrin, the media coined the term \u201csound cannon\u201d to capture the device\u2019s non-military applications. Despite assurances from its creator and police departments that the LRAD is not a weapon, misusing these devices can result in serious hearing damage\u2014and there is nothing stopping law enforcement in many municipalities from doing so.\n\nThe LRAD\u2014which looks like a speaker typically mounted on an armored vehicle\u2014directs acoustic energy toward a target. According to the manufacturer\u2019s white paper, sound is deployed in a conical field emanating from the device, and is optimized to the 1 to 5 kHz range, where human hearing is most sensitive. Once you\u2019re within the cone of sound, the closer you get to the device, the louder and more dangerous the situation becomes, according to independent studies and lawsuits.\n\n\u201cWe give [soldiers] publications, operating manuals, and training materials and make sure they understand the hazards,\u201d said Elliott. \u201cWe don\u2019t allow anyone to come within 75 meters of the \u2018red zone.\u2019 We specify when to wear hearing protection, and that behind the speaker you\u2019re in the green zone\u2014we verify those performance characteristics through specific safety testing and measure against published Army standards for sound exposure\u2026 [soldiers] are not indiscriminately exposing bystanders. They point it at the intended audience.\u201d\n\nUsers can engage two main modes on the LRAD: the \u201cvoice\u201d function, which allows speakers to communicate at 20-30 decibels higher than an average loudspeaker, and the \u201calert\u201d function, which emits high-decibel, highly focused, narrow frequency chirping sounds. LRADs cut through background noise of 88 decibels, according to the manufacturer website, which is about the volume of a freight train 15 meters away.", "description": "David McNew/GettyOriginally developed to ward off pirates at sea, one powerful military-grade device has become a favorite tool for U.S. law enforcement.
