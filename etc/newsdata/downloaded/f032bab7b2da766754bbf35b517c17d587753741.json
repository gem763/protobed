REUTERS/Toby Melville/Files\n\nDunkerton, Superdry\u2019s biggest shareholder with an 18.5% stake, rejoined its board in April after narrowly winning a shareholder vote, prompting the existing directors, including CEO Euan Sutherland, to resign en masse.\n\nThe 54-year-old\u2019s return followed a string of profit warnings as the Superdry brand struggled to expand beyond sweatshirts, hoodies and jackets adorned with random Japanese text and as wholesale and e-commerce demand fell.\n\nShares in Superdry, which in July reported a pretax loss of 85.4 million pounds for the 2018-19 year, were up 0.6% at 436.1 pence at 1031 GMT, although the group\u2019s stock price is still down 57% over the last year.\n\n\u201cDespite some grumbles, shareholders largely seem willing to give Dunkerton time to get Superdry back on track. But his task won\u2019t be made any easier by the tricky retail backdrop,\u201d analysts at AJ Bell said of Dunkerton\u2019s appointment.\n\nDunkerton and former design and brand director James Holder founded the firm in 2003 and listed it in London in 2010. Holder left the business in 2016. Dunkerton then followed in March 2018 because he could not \u201cput his name to the strategy\u201d.\n\nSuperdry\u2019s new board said Dunkerton, who was named interim CEO on April 2, will have a contract as CEO until April 2021 and his base salary will remain at 600,000 pounds ($753,960).\n\nIt said Dunkerton would oversee his strategy of restoring the brand to its design-led roots and lead the business back to growth.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement reflects the board\u2019s unanimous view that he is the right person to lead the business through this initial crucial phase of the turnaround,\u201d it said.\n\nDunkerton said his strategy was already seeing early signs of progress, although it would take time.\n\nHis initial focus has been on getting Superdry\u2019s product ranges right and improving e-commerce. He has increased the number of products sold online, put more stock into flagship stores and cut back discounts to improve profit margins.\n\nSuperdry has forecast a slight decline in 2019-20 revenue and only a \u201cmodest\u201d increase in underlying profitability.\n\nThe board\u2019s nomination committee will continue the process to find a long-term CEO successor, it added.", "description": "Superdry put its faith in Julian Dunkerton to get the British fashion group back on track on Monday, confirming him as chief executive until 2021, after the co-founder returned in a boardroom coup earlier this year.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440692319&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D0FO", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
