Based on its second quarter 2019 earnings, Alphabet averages more than $400 million in revenue daily.\n\nIf this sounds familiar, that's because the FTC went through a similar cycle with Facebook less than two months ago. The agency imposed a $5 billion fine, its largest ever on a tech company, over alleged violations of a previous privacy agreement. That's less than one month's worth of revenue for Facebook based on its second quarter earnings report, which showed revenue of $16.9 billion for the three-month period. By the end of trading the day of the fine's announcement, Facebook had gained $6 billion in value. Despite the penalties and noise from politicians about cracking down, its stock is up more than 40% so far this year.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Google pointed to its earlier blog post on the settlement. The FTC declined to comment for this story.\n\nHowever, in an interview on \"Closing Bell,\" Andrew Smith, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, told CNBC's Ylan Mui, \"I don't concede that the punishment here was inadequate. I think that it is consistent with our prior cases, with our prior COPPA [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act] cases, it's consistent with the penalties we've sought and obtained in those cases. It just happens to be so much larger because YouTube is so much larger. But I do think that this is a penalty that sends a strong message to the marketplace and I have to respectfully disagree with the detractors.\"", "description": "The $170 million YouTube settlement marks a fraction of the revenue its parent company made in the last quarter.", "authors": ["Lauren Feiner"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/102862252-Various-July-130.jpg?v=1565986072"}
