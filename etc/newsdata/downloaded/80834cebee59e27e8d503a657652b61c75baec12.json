While Mr. Liu would continue to lead talks on trade issues, a separate team would be assigned to manage the other geopolitical matters, they said.\n\nDeputy-level Chinese trade officials plan to head to Washington next week to pave the way for the high-level meeting, according to another person familiar with the matter.\n\nIn Washington on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he was cautiously optimistic the two sides could make meaningful progress with Chinese negotiators.\n\nHe said the U.S.\u2019s top concern remains intellectual-property rights and forced joint ventures, as well as currency issues. Unrest in Hong Kong isn\u2019t under discussion as part of the trade talks, he said, but didn\u2019t address whether negotiators would discuss Huawei Technologies Co. Mr. Mnuchin also dismissed speculation that the administration would accept a watered-down trade deal ahead of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe president \u201cis prepared to keep these tariffs in place. He is prepared to raise tariffs if we need to raise tariffs,\u201d Mr. Mnuchin said, insisting, \u201cThis isn\u2019t an election issue. He\u2019s trying to do the right thing for American companies and the American public.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump, in a brief morning tweet, said: \u201cIt is expected that China will be buying large amounts of our agricultural products!\u201d The White House didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for further elaboration on that tweet.\n\nBeijing\u2019s attempt to separate trade from broader concerns about geopolitical competition will likely be a hard sell for the Trump administration, which has linked trade negotiations with other issues, including Huawei, which Washington has put on an export blacklist.\n\nThe U.S. regards the Chinese company as a security threat amid a global shift to next-generation wireless networks. Huawei is a leader in 5G network equipment, which U.S. officials say could allow it to spy on behalf of the Chinese government, allegations that Beijing rejects.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping has made relief for the company a precondition for reaching a trade agreement. Chinese officials are hoping Mr. Trump will keep his word on lifting a U.S. ban on purchases of Huawei products that aren\u2019t tied to national security.\n\nWashington and Beijing will also likely disagree on what gets categorized as a trade issue as opposed to a national security issue. In earlier rounds of discussions, Chinese officials had sought to treat data transfers and cloud computing as related to national security, while the U.S. pushed Beijing to address those issues in the negotiations over trade and investment.", "description": "Beijing is looking to put thornier national-security issues on a separate track.", "authors": ["Dow Jones Newswires"], "top_image": "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HA919_barron_NS_20181226134502.png", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
