California\n\n\u201cThe plan for this year was three fights and it doesn\u2019t look like that\u2019s going to be the case now. That doesn\u2019t mean that anything has changed in regard to me getting to where I want to be, but I did fully intend to have a busy 2019.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, KSI and Paul meet for the first time as professionals after their amateur fight in August last year, which saw over 18,000 in attendance at the Manchester Arena and 1,300,000 pay-per-view buys online.\n\nAnd speaking to the Daily Mirror, Eubank Jr gave his take on their professional debuts.\n\n\u201cListen, these guys are doing great things.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not your typical professional boxers, obviously, but they\u2019re still shining a light on the great sport, the sport that we all love.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re bringing it to a whole new audience. Some people say they shouldn\u2019t be doing this, they shouldn\u2019t be doing that, it\u2019s not fair that they\u2019re making a lot of money out of the sport.\n\n\u201cBut at the end of the day, they\u2019re bringing new fans, new subscribers and shining a new light on the sport and for that I\u2019m fully behind them.\u201d\n\nSo, who does Eubank Jr think is going to win when the pair meet at Staples Centre in November?\n\n\u201cKSI is one of my good friends.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve trained with him on and off and I\u2019ve seen some good things. I\u2019m rooting for him and I think that he\u2019ll do the business.\u201d", "description": "Chris Eubank Jr has had his say on the highly anticipated rematch between YouTube sensations KSI and Logan Paul.", "authors": ["Adam Hamdani"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/05/16/ksi-vs-logan-paul-48.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
