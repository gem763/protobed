Later today, President Trump will meet with China\u2019s Vice Premier, Liu He, and dealers are optimistic as Trump tweeted that \u2018good things are happening\u2019 at the trade talks. Dealers have been taking their cues from the US president, so hopes are running high.\n\nIn a nice change of pace, we heard positive mood music yesterday from the meeting between Prime Minister Johnson, and Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar. The politicians said there is a \u2018pathway\u2019 for an agreement being struck, but both sides have been guarded when it comes to the finer details.

The fear of a disorderly Brexit has been hanging over the property sector. In light of the upbeat sentiment, traders are snapping up Bovis Homes (LON: ), Persimmon PLC (LON: ), Taylor Wimpey (LON: ), in addition to Berkeley (LON: ).\n\nSAP (LON: ) shares rallied today as the group posted solid quarterly figures last night.

The University of jumped to 96 in October from 93.2 in October, so consumers are clearly keen to spend.\n\nThe trade spat, combined with an economic slowdown in China has hurt Ford, as the group said that third-quarter vehicle deliveries to that country dropped by 30%. Keep in mind, the US car manufacturer saw first-quarter and second-quarter sales fall by 36% and 22% respectively.
