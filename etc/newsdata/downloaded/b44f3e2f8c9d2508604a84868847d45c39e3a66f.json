For soybeans, additional tariffs of 25% in July 2018 and 5% this month lifted the total duty from 3% to 33%.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if some or all of the additional tariffs would be suspended.\n\n\u201cChina supports relevant enterprises buying certain amounts of soybeans, pork and other agricultural products from today in accordance with market principles and WTO rules,\u201d Xinhua said, adding that the Customs Tariff Commission of China\u2019s State Council would exclude additional tariffs on those items.\n\nChina has \u201cbroad prospects\u201d for importing high-quality U.S. agricultural goods, Xinhua reported, citing unidentified authorities.\n\nU.S. farm groups cheered the goodwill gesture by the world\u2019s largest pork consumer and top soybean buyer - though they hoped for more clarity from China on exactly what tariffs would be lifted.\n\n\u201cThe importance of this market to U.S. pork producers is clear,\u201d said National Pork Producers Council President and North Carolina hog farmer David Herring. \u201cU.S. pork exports could single handedly make a huge dent in the trade imbalance with China.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: Young pigs in a pen at a hog farm in Ryan, Iowa, U.S., May 18, 2019.

U.S. pork exports to China so far this year have largely fallen short of expectations.\n\n(Graphic: China buyers set to eye more U.S. soybeans and pork purchases after tariff freeze, here)\n\nChina is also expected to step up purchases of soybeans, historically the most valuable U.S. farm export, which China has largely avoided buying since the trade war began last year. Exports valued at more than $12 billion in 2017 crashed by 74% last year.\n\n(Graphic: U.S. soybean exports to China vs the rest of the world, here)\n\nBefore the announcement of additional tariff exemptions, Chinese firms bought at least 10 boatloads of U.S. soybeans on Thursday, the country\u2019s most significant purchases since at least June.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture on Friday said private exporters had sold 204,000 tonnes of U.S. soybeans to China, confirming a portion of the sales reported by Reuters.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Vanessa Kummer checks the quality of their 2018 soybean crops on the family farm near Colfax, North Dakota, U.S., August 6, 2019.
