She was even spotted holding a crystal ashtray as her brother took an early morning smoke break.\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Kim Yo Jong has made headlines \u2013 she traveled to South Korea during the 2018 Winter Olympics, becoming the first member of North Korea\u2019s ruling family to visit the south since the Korean War in the 1950s.\n\nSome speculated that Kim Yo Jong was kicked out of North Korea\u2019s high-profile ruling politburo, NK News reported in April, suggesting a fall from favor. But she was spotted for the first time in 52 days on Monday, standing alongside her brother and his wife at a propaganda event.\n\nLike her brother, and much of the rest of their family, few details are known about Kim Yo Jong and the life she lived before reaching a prime leadership role in the North Korean government.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about her so far.\n\nLike many of Kim\u2019s family members, Kim Yo Jong\u2019s exact age is difficult to pin down. But she\u2019s believed to be between 29 and 31.\n\nShe\u2019s the youngest child of former North Korean leader Kim Jong Il and his consort Ko Yong Hui, a former dancer.\n\ncaption The Kim family tree. source Business Insider/Samantha Lee\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nShe was partly educated in Switzerland, at the same school Kim Jong Un attended.

Kim Jong Il once bragged to foreign interlocutors in 2002 that his youngest daughter was interested in politics and eager to work in North Korea\u2019s government.\n\nSource: North Korea Leadership Watch\n\nIt\u2019s completely unclear where she was or what she was up to between 2000 and 2007.\n\nSource: North Korea Leadership Watch\n\nIn the following years, she conducted a lot of behind-the-scenes work for her father, Kim Jong Il, and brother, Kim Jong Un. She played a particularly significant role in helping Kim Jong Un take over instead of his older brothers.\n\ncaption North Korean leader Kim Jong Un guides the launch of a Hwasong-12 missile in this undated photo released by North Korea\u2019s Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on September 16, 2017. source KCNA via REUTERS\n\nSource: North Korea Leadership Watch\n\nHer first public appearance was in 2011 at Kim Jong Il\u2019s funeral.\n\ncaption The funeral procession for Kim Jong Il, which took place on December 28, 2011.

While she\u2019s out of the line of succession, some believe she could take over the country\u2019s leadership if something happens to Kim Jong Un before his kids are old enough to rule.\n\ncaption North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang on October 8, 2017. source KCNA/via REUTERS\n\nSources: The New York Times, Washington Post\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be an unprecedented role for her, either.
