In his testimony, Zuckerberg tried to reassure Congress that Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency would square the circle between financial inclusion and regulatory adherence, consumer privacy and proactive fraud detection. The one thing he didn't manage to address is whether the world really wants a crypto offering from the social media giant.\n\nCryptocurrency has acquired an unseemly status where any use is automatically assumed to have nefarious ends. It doesn't help that the most prominent example, Bitcoin, has been implicated in some horrific criminal conduct. At the same time, a lack of mainstream adoption gives cryptocurrency few redeeming advocates. No surprise, then, that regulators regard Facebook's proposal with suspicion.\n\nIt's not that legitimate businesses don't want crypto; it's that their customers don't want to use it for payment. When buying stuff on the internet, consumers will choose the payment method that imposes the lowest transaction cost on themselves - that's generally the credit card option, which allows deferred payment as well as the accrual of miles or points. An online business that refuses to accept credit cards will always lose out to a competitor that does.\n\nBut what if you don't have any competitors? Facebook enjoys quasi-monopoly status when it comes to consumer attention, controlling the reach and distribution of content across its network of users. (So far, 46 attorneys general have joined a New York-led antitrust investigation of the company and its dominance as a social media platform.)\n\nAs the driver of over one-fourth of web traffic, Facebook has a lot of influence over who sees what on the internet. And with over 2.3 billion monthly active users around the world, it's not a stretch to imagine that the company could have similar influence over who pays whom, and how.", "description": "Global regulators are so worried about preserving their own monopoly status that they've forgotten that monopolies have victims.
