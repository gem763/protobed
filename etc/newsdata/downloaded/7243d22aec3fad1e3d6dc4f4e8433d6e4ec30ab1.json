Within hours of meeting Lee, the managing director of Altos Ventures Han Kim, wanted in.\n\nAltos Ventures was the first investor in Lee's now-$2 billion money transfer app, Toss. The South Korean venture capital firm initially invested 1 billion Korean won (around $1 million at that time) in the business five years ago, when Toss was barely off the ground. Altos has since topped up that funding with a further $27 million.\n\nAt that time, in 2014, such peer-to-peer (P2P) transfer services lacked regulatory approval in South Korea, which meant they were effectively illegal.\n\nBut, in Lee, Altos Ventures saw an entrepreneur who was determined to fight the fight to reinvent the system.\n\n\"We saw a large opportunity and a trend that was happening outside of Korea.
