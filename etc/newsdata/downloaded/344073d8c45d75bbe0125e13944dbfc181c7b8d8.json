When asked if his advice was for people in Trump\u2019s inner circle to quit, Conway answered affirmatively.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t have a positive effect on him and I don\u2019t think anybody can, yeah,\u201d Conway told Bharara. \u201cI think the calculation they should be making is [that] he\u2019s going to be gone at some point and there\u2019s going to be a reckoning and history isn\u2019t going to be kind to people who said nothing or stood up for Trump.\u201d\n\nConway has been a vocal critic of President Trump in the past. In March, Trump responded in kind, labeling Conway as \u201cVERY jealous\u201d of his wife Kellyanne Conway\u2019s success, and a \u201chusband from hell\u201d in a tweet.\n\nWhen Bharara sounded like he was getting to ask specifically about his wife\u2019s role in the administration, Conway quickly shut it down.\n\n\u201cNot going there,\u201d Conway said. \u201cBut I think my position is clear.\u201d\n\nKellyanne Conway speaks to members of the media outside the West Wing of the White House September 12, 2019 in Washington, D.C. Alex Wong\u2014Getty Images\n\nConway also spoke specifically to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone\u2019s response to the impeachment inquiry currently underway in the House, with 225 members saying they support the proceedings. In a letter sent to Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Oct. 8, Cipollone said that the White House would block any cooperation with the House\u2019s impeachment inquiry. Conway called the letter \u201ctrash.\u201d\n\nThe White House is alleging that the inquiry \u201clacks any legitimate constitutional foundation, any pretense of fairness or even the most elementary due process protections\u201d and that the Democrats have no basis for their inquiry.\n\n\u201cBasically the thrust of it is that there are some kind of constitutional obligations that the House has failed to meet that therefore render its impeachment inquiry illegitimate and unconstitutional, which is complete nonsense,\u201d Conway explained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just an excuse to prevent evidence, damning evidence, from reaching the public,\u201d Conway alleged.\n\nWrite to Josiah Bates at josiah.bates@time.com.", "description": "Attorney George Conway, husband of President Trump's counselor Kellyanne Conway, suggested that Trump's closest advisers should step down", "authors": ["Josiah Bates"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/george-conway-trump-accusations-e1570736426372.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C50px%2C752px%2C394px&resize=1200%2C628&strip", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
