REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\nAmerican Alberto Salazar, who has coached some of the world\u2019s top distance runners, including the marathon\u2019s two most recent men\u2019s champions, was handed a four-year ban less than two weeks ago for doping violations.\n\nThe head coach of the elite Nike Oregon Project (NOP) was sanctioned for \u201corchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct\u201d, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) said.\n\nSalazar said he plans to appeal against the ruling.\n\nAlthough he faced years of suspicion and allegations, his suspension nonetheless shocked the sport, with 2018 and 2017 Chicago Marathon Champions Mo Farah and Galen Rupp among his most decorated pupils.\n\nReigning champion Farah, who won Olympic gold in the 5,000- and 10,000 metres at both the 2012 and 2016 Games, worked with Salazar from 2011 to 2017.\n\nJordan Hasay, a top contender on the women\u2019s side, was still working with Salazar at the time of his suspension, as was 2017 Chicago winner Rupp.\n\nFarah said after Salazar\u2019s suspension was announced that he has no tolerance for rule breakers. Neither he, Rupp nor Hasay were accused of wrongdoing in the USADA report.\n\nChicago Marathon Director Carey Pinkowski told Reuters on Thursday that he and the event embraced the announcement about Salazar.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is the emotion of not only that announcement but it\u2019s been many years of frustration and challenge and it\u2019s been brought out in the light of day,\u201d said Pinkowski, who is celebrating his 30th year overseeing the marathon.\n\n\u201cFor us as leaders of the industry, I think it\u2019s an opportunity for us to move forward.\u201d\n\nThe 42nd running of the race sees an elite field stacked with talent, with this year\u2019s Boston Marathon champion Lawrence Cherono of Kenya joining American Rupp and Briton Farah among the top contenders.\n\nOn the women\u2019s side, Hasay is on the hunt for her first-ever major marathon title, while reigning Chicago winner Brigid Kosgei of Kenya will look to build on her momentum after claiming victory at the London Marathon in April.\n\nIn the men\u2019s wheelchair division, veteran 10-times Boston Marathon champion Ernst Van Dyk will battle against 21-year-old Dan Romanchuk, who last year won in Chicago and became the youngest athlete to win the New York Marathon.\n\nEight-times Chicago winner Tatyana McFadden will look to add to her formidable pile of medals in the women\u2019s wheelchair field.", "description": "The winds of change are roiling through the sport of endurance running as athletes descend on the Windy City for Sunday's Chicago Marathon, with one of the sport's longstanding figureheads conspicuously out of the picture.", "authors": ["Amy Tennery", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439435240&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF992BO-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
