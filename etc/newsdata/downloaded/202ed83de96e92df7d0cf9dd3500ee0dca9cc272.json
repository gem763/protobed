Legal processes have begun to recover losses incurred as a result of wrongdoing, the statement said.\n\n\"Following the release of the interim update on the forensic investigation by ENSafrica on 16 July 2019, the board has now substantially completed the investigation into the R1.2bn of suspicious transactions which were identified during the investigation,\" EOH said.\n\n\"The ENSafrica investigation found evidence of a number of governance failings and wrongdoing at EOH, including unsubstantiated payments, tender irregularities and other unethical business practices which are primarily limited to the public sector business centralised in EOH Mthombo (Pty) Ltd and to a limited number of EOH employees.\"\n\nAccording to EOH, it has assessed the current financial impact of the investigation's findings, and will provide details on October 15, in its results announcement for the year ended July 31.\n\nEarlier this year, EOH was barred from reselling Microsoft software licences amid reports that a whistleblower filed a complaint with the US Securities & Exchange Commission about alleged EOH corruption in a department of defence software deal. Three top executives have since announced their resignations.\n\nThe group has previously warned of heavy losses even without the anticipated costs of any wrongdoing found, Fin24 previously reported. It recently said it anticipated earnings per share to show a loss of at least 2 700c in the year to end July, versus a profit of 202c per share in the same period last year.\n\nCompiled by Marelise van der Merwe", "description": "ICT group EOH's board has \"substantially completed\" an investigation into R1.2bn of suspicious transactions, the group said on Thursday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6880/48ec4b6445804daeb26d85ca8a01718a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
