It is the insult to our intelligence.\n\nFor three years, Labour and Lib Dem MPs have twisted and turned, seeking to wriggle out of the promises they had given in advance to accept the referendum result.\n\nIn the process, they have smashed up our constitution. They have ignored the norms on which our democracy rests. They have torn precedent to shreds.\n\nThey have politicised the Speaker\u2019s chair. They have turned us against one another. They have made our country a laughing stock abroad.\n\nSo how did Opposition MPs respond to Mr Johnson securing the thing they had said they wanted? By immediately moving the goalposts. Determined to force him into a delay, they passed an amendment to prevent him from meeting the October 19 deadline\n\nYet still they carry on, telling us their unconstitutional schemes are somehow all about upholding our constitution, claiming that their contempt for democracy is about trusting the people.\n\nOn Saturday, they reached their lowest point yet. Having gone to court to demand that MPs have a \u2018meaningful vote\u2019 on the Brexit terms, they chose, when the moment came, to avoid that vote.\n\nHaving spent two years claiming that their chief aim was to avoid a \u2018no deal\u2019 Brexit, they rejected the one certain mechanism to prevent such an outcome, namely to vote for a deal. Do they really imagine that voters can\u2019t see what is going on?\n\nAt the beginning of September, Opposition MPs passed a measure that required the Prime Minister to ask the EU to extend Britain\u2019s membership unless an agreement had been reached by October 19.\n\nThey have ignored the norms on which our democracy rests. They have torn precedent to shreds. They have politicised the Speaker\u2019s chair. They have turned us against one another. They have made our country a laughing stock abroad. Speaker John Bercow is seen above\n\nThe MPs who passed that act \u2013 they get cross when Boris Johnson calls it the Surrender Act, so let\u2019s instead go with Abject National Capitulation Act \u2013 plainly expected the PM to fail.\n\nWhy, after all, should the EU have granted Britain any concessions once such a law was on the books?\n\nInstead, to general astonishment, Mr Johnson came back with a deal. And not just any deal: a deal which met the supposed concerns of his domestic opponents.\n\nUnder the terms he secured, Britain would recover its sovereignty, taking back control of its laws, taxes, farming and fishing, its industrial and regional policy, its immigration rules and criminal justice system and, not least, its ability to sign trade deals.\n\nIt would do all these things with the approval of the EU, paving the way for a close and cordial relationship after Brexit.\n\nSo how did Opposition MPs respond to Mr Johnson securing the thing they had said they wanted? By immediately moving the goalposts.\n\nThe MPs who passed that act \u2013 they get cross when Boris Johnson calls it the Surrender Act, so let\u2019s instead go with Abject National Capitulation Act \u2013 plainly expected the PM to fail. Sir Oliver Letwin is pictured above\n\nDetermined to force him into a delay, they passed an amendment to prevent him from meeting the October 19 deadline.\n\nAs Caroline Flint, the Labour MP for Don Valley, put it: \u2018This was a panic measure to reinsert the three-month delay for one reason only, to thwart a deal. The public want an orderly Brexit. This doesn\u2019t help.\u2019\n\nIt is worth noting that Miss Flint is one of the few Labour MPs to have stuck to her party\u2019s 2017 general election manifesto.\n\nLike most of her Labour colleagues, she voted Remain, but fought the subsequent election on a promise to implement the referendum result.\n\nShe is now being fiercely criticised by her own side because she is sticking to the promise that they also made.\n\nIt would have been less damaging to our democracy if Opposition MPs had at least been upfront.\n\nLabour and Lib Dem MPs demand a general election while constantly voting to prevent one. They demand a \u2018people\u2019s vote\u2019 while overtly working to overturn the actual people\u2019s vote. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson is pictured above\n\nIf, in the aftermath of the referendum, they had simply rejected the outcome and refused to trigger the withdrawal process, there would have been an almighty row but at least the legitimacy of our democratic institutions would not have been wrecked.\n\nInstead, they treated voters like idiots. Again and again, they sought to prevent Brexit while pretending that their only real purpose was to allow parliamentary scrutiny.\n\nTheir claim to be defending the rules is beyond absurd.\n\nAs Vernon Bogdanor, arguably the country\u2019s leading constitutional expert, puts it, this latest manoeuvre is unconstitutional twice over, violating both the convention that government business must have priority in the Commons and the rule, dating from 1713, that only the government can authorise spending.\n\nIn Professor Bogdanor\u2019s words: \u2018If MPs disagree with a flagship policy of the government, their right course, instead of hiding behind procedural devices, is to replace the government, either through a vote of no confidence or a general election.\u2019\n\nQuite. But the Opposition parties are now democracy dodgers twice over. They refuse to implement the referendum result as promised and, at the same time, they also refuse to let the country vote in a general election.\n\nDo they think we can\u2019t see through them? Labour and Lib Dem MPs demand a general election while constantly voting to prevent one.\n\nThey demand a \u2018people\u2019s vote\u2019 while overtly working to overturn the actual people\u2019s vote.\n\nAnd to what end? Suppose that they somehow got their way and cancelled Brexit. What would that achieve? Britain would be kept in the EU as a snarling, subjugated member.\n\nLook at what these repeated postponements have already done to us: MPs needed to be escorted from Parliament by the police on Saturday.\n\nOpposition MPs had plainly hoped that, if they strung things out, people would blame the Government. But Leave voters are not the elderly, working-class thickos that Europhile MPs take them for.\n\nAs Caroline Flint, the Labour MP for Don Valley, put it: \u2018This was a panic measure to reinsert the three-month delay for one reason only, to thwart a deal. The public want an orderly Brexit. This doesn\u2019t help\n\nThey don\u2019t blame the PM for sending a photocopy of the letter mandated by Parliament; they blame the MPs who voted to keep Britain in.\n\nPolls show a growing Conservative lead \u2013 a lead that will surely stretch as Brexit Party voters digest the U-turn by Nigel Farage, who last week lined up with the Remain parties to demand an extension.\n\nPushing the exit date further into the future would mean that a general election was likelier to take place while we are still in the process of leaving \u2013 which, contrary to what Remainers had originally hoped, would make Mr Johnson\u2019s majority even larger.\n\nAs for the hope that a second referendum might overturn the first, that now looks utterly absurd. Given a choice between cancelling the referendum and leaving on these terms, people would vote to leave.\n\nThe war is almost over. The only question for our MPs is how much more damage they do to Parliament on their way out.\n\nDaniel Hannan is a Conservative MEP.", "description": "DANIEL HANNAN: For three years, Labour and Lib Dem MPs have twisted and turned, seeking to wriggle out of the promises they had given in advance to accept the referendum result.", "authors": ["Daniel Hannan For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/00/19969576-0-image-a-23_1571613356475.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
