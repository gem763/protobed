After talks with the indigenous groups allegedly behind the riots, lawmakers reached an accord that saw Moreno \u2013 elected as a socialist but governing since 2017 largely to the right of center \u2013 abandon several major economic reforms meant to embolden the nation\u2019s financial state. The United Nations joined the Vatican in mediating the talks.\n\nSeven people died during the Quito riots, and rioters held more than 50 members of the military hostage. Hundreds of demonstrators have been arrested and well over a thousand injured.\n\nAs previously reported, protests began this month against President Moreno\u2019s \u201cDecree 883,\u201d which ended a decades-old government oil subsidy that paid a portion of fuel costs to keep prices low. In addition, Ecuador withdrew from the Organization of Petroleum-Exporting Countries (OPEC), which limits member nations\u2019 oil production to keep prices high. Moreno contended that increasing oil output would force prices down naturally, saving the government money it spends on the subsidy while consumers would still pay relatively low prices.\n\nAfter fuel prices initially skyrocketed, bus and taxi drivers directly affected took to the streets. The transportation workers rapidly found an agreement with Quito, but alleged \u201cindigenous activists\u201d continued to protest. Indigenous communities account for roughly a quarter of Ecuador\u2019s overall populace.\n\nPresident Moreno repeatedly pressed for talks with indigenous leadership, but the opposition refused all communication up until Sunday\u2019s meeting. Following the settlement agreed upon, the fuel subsidies will be reinstated, and a commission \u2013 mediated by the same organizations \u2013 will be established to repair damaged relations with indigenous people of the Andean nation.\n\nIn its place, a new law will be written to help curb fuel smuggling and other exploitation of the subsidies. Government official Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Rold\u00e1n characterized the result as a concession, rather than defeat. \u201cConceding is not losing,\u201d he said. \u201cHere we are all conceding.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith this agreement, the mobilizations \u2026 across Ecuador are terminated and we commit ourselves to restoring peace in the country,\u201d said a joint statement released after the talks were concluded.", "description": "The United Nations announced on Sunday that Ecuador will reinstate fuel subsidies to end the violent protests in its capital.", "authors": ["Nate Church"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1175969777-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
