They can carry up to 16 Bulava missiles, which are designed for use on these submarines.\n\nThe global arms-control architecture erected during the Cold War to keep Washington and Moscow in check has come under strain since the demise earlier this year of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.\n\nThe last major nuclear arms control treaty between Russia and the US, the New START treaty, is due to expire in 2021.\n\nIt limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads the world's two biggest nuclear powers can deploy.", "description": "Borei-class vessel's test comes amid arms control tensions between Moscow and West following demise of key nuclear pact.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/30/527b04e7f8e14d088146b62a232f89aa_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
