We know this story, sir. We know what\u2019s going on. We know, and we\u2019re scared.\n\nThe series, based on the classic HG Wells novel, is in development for the BBC and doesn\u2019t yet have a firm release date.", "description": "Oh, dear me, it\u2019s the aliens.", "authors": ["Zack Zwiezen", "Alex Walker"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/olqdxsrc4r2hvaptt1dt.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
