Check it out:\n\nAt just 4.1 inches on a side and 2.7 inches tall, I like how small these are. I think they look way cooler than the Orbi oval towers or the multi-antenna TP-Link I\u2019ve got mounted on my wall. That said, the smaller size means the new Orbis aren\u2019t as powerful as Netgear\u2019s recently-introduced $699.99 Orbi Wi-Fi 6 mesh network, not least of which because they don\u2019t have the new Wi-Fi 6 capabilities.\n\nThere\u2019s not a lot in the spec sheet to tell us how powerful the new Orbis are. Netgear says they have max speeds of 400Mbps over the 2.4GHz band, and 866 Mbps over 5GHz. With one router and one satellite, Netgear says you can cover 3,000 square feet with Wi-Fi.\n\nThe main router has two Ethernet ports, but you\u2019ll be using one to connect your modem, so if you need to plug a lot of devices directly into your router, this may not be the system for you. And if you you like the idea of controlling your network settings by chatting with Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant, these routers will let you do that.\n\nThey don\u2019t have Wi-Fi 6\n\nBut the new Orbis are much more affordable than Netgear\u2019s flagship Wi-Fi 6 package: as little as $149 for a two-pack (RBK12) at Walmart (which seems to be the only place you can buy it right now) or a three-pack (RBK13) elsewhere for $229 (RBK13). There\u2019s also a four-pack (RBK14) with three satellites on Netgear\u2019s website listed only as \u201ccoming soon.\u201d\n\nYou may want to wait at least a single day, though, to see what Google\u2019s rumored new Nest Wifi has to offer \u2014 and we just reviewed Amazon\u2019s latest Eero mesh Wi-Fi system that\u2019s just slightly more expensive at $99 per access point, with a three-pack for $249.", "description": "Many of Netgear\u2019s Orbi Wi-Fi routers seem to look like strange oval towers, but its newest mesh router system changes up that look with a new, boxy design.", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M0Tsx-KN8jJqUJUAZpkfr9JFPzQ=/0x4:902x476/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19287214/Screen_Shot_2019_10_14_at_2.49.12_PM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
