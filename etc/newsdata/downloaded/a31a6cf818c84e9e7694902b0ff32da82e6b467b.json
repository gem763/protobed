They put Alexa in your ear. They include Bose\u2019s proprietary noise reduction technology to help eliminate outside noises. And the most surprising part is just how good they sound. The Echo Buds cost $129.99, which is a remarkably aggressive price compared to what manufacturers like Sony, Jaybird, Google, Microsoft, and other earbud makers are charging \u2014 especially if you want noise reduction.\n\nApple has managed to steal some of Amazon\u2019s thunder with the new $249 AirPods Pro, which offer active noise cancellation, a customizable fit, and upgraded audio, plus all of the usual AirPod features. But the Echo Buds have exceeded my expectations and definitely warrant some excitement. They don\u2019t offer every bell and whistle (like wireless charging), but I\u2019ve been using them for a little under a week, and even if you never bother using any of the Alexa functionality, these are worth serious consideration.\n\nOur review of Amazon Echo Buds Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Excellent sound quality\n\nGood, comfortable fit\n\nBose\u2019s noise reduction makes a difference Bad Stuff Micro USB. UGH.\n\nNo wireless charging\n\nSome early bugs Buy for $129.99 from Amazon\n\nThe Echo Buds are nondescript, come in only black, and lack the signature blue LED that you might expect from an Echo / Alexa product. When worn, they don\u2019t look much different from Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Buds, just slightly larger. There are no physical buttons on the buds \u2014 just a touch-sensitive circle on each one that\u2019s easy to find with a finger. Depending on how you want to customize the tap controls, you can change tracks, activate Siri / Google Assistant, or enable noise reduction with a tap, two taps, or by tapping and holding. Unfortunately, you can\u2019t control volume directly on the buds; you\u2019ll have to ask Alexa to crank it up or adjust volume on your phone directly.\n\nThree sizes of silicone tips come in the box (with custom-fit Comply foam tips available separately), and Amazon also includes wing tips that might be useful if you plan to run or exercise with the buds. I noticed that using the largest wing tips could sometimes prevent the Echo Buds from fully docking in their case if I wasn\u2019t paying attention. Even when I followed Amazon\u2019s instructions to carefully line up the wing tip with its respective Echo Bud. This isn\u2019t a problem with the medium and small wing tips. In my case, the largest ear tips kept the Echo Buds in snugly without needing the help of the wings, and they didn\u2019t start to slip out or dislodge while eating or talking, which can sometimes happen if you\u2019ve got an imperfect fit.\n\nThe Echo Buds are IPX4 water and sweat resistant, and Amazon says they can last for up to five hours of continuous listening before needing a recharge. The carrying case, which is neither the largest nor the smallest I\u2019ve seen, has enough power to give the buds 20 hours of total listening time.\n\nBy far the worst part of the Echo Buds is found on the case, however. Amazon made the very unfortunate decision to use an ancient Micro USB charging port instead of USB-C or wireless charging. In late 2019. I\u2019d managed to go all USB-C before reviewing these earbuds, but Amazon isn\u2019t ready to let go of the past. This company has shown an extreme reluctance to change connectors; the new Fire HD 10 tablet is Amazon\u2019s first USB-C device. I\u2019m sure Amazon\u2019s decision is backed by customer data, but it still comes off as stubborn when competitors are all using USB-C (or Lightning in Apple\u2019s case).\n\nI think it\u2019d be easier to overlook the Micro USB annoyance if the Echo Buds case was capable of wireless charging and you could just ignore cables altogether. But it\u2019s not, so you can\u2019t. Here\u2019s hoping that Amazon eventually releases a USB-C case with wireless charging \u2014 ideally before these buds get refreshed a year from now, but we\u2019ll see. This one also scratches and gets scuffed if you look at it wrong.\n\nHaving Alexa in your ear is convenient, but unlike the rest of the Echo lineup, it\u2019s not a headline feature. It\u2019s easy to use these earbuds and pay no mind to Amazon\u2019s voice assistant whatsoever. I think that\u2019s a good thing because, in large part, Alexa feels redundant in this particular use case. If you do want to avoid Alexa completely, you can disable the wake word in Amazon\u2019s Alexa app. The earbuds also let you mute the microphones, but that affects phone calls, too. I think there\u2019s ample reason to be wary of wearing Alexa everywhere you go. To that point, Amazon says it has several privacy protections in place to keep the Echo Buds from spying on you:\n\nThe Voice Activity Detector senses when you\u2019re talking, enabling wake word detection. We then use near-field beamforming technology to focus the microphones on your mouth to detect your speech and reject any background noise. Echo Buds were designed such that Alexa wake word functionality is only available when at least one earbud has been connected via Bluetooth to a compatible mobile device with the Alexa app open and detected in-ear by an on-device sensor. Additionally, there are multiple ways to mute wake word functionality on Echo Buds. In the app, the home screen will allow you to mute or unmute Alexa with just a click. You can also set up an on-device gesture that mutes the microphones when you press and hold either earbud. And finally, if you take both earbuds out of your ears Alexa will be muted. When Alexa is muted, no audio is streaming to the cloud and Alexa will not be able to process your request.\n\nI\u2019ve mostly used Alexa to add items to my grocery store shopping list and check the weather. Everything I do with it is already possible one way or another with Siri or Google Assistant. Triggering Alexa with my voice isn\u2019t any faster than Apple\u2019s \u201cHey Siri\u201d or saying \u201cOK Google\u201d on headphones with Assistant built in.\n\nAside from the basics, the Echo Buds let you instantly Drop In on Echo speakers \u2014 either your own or those belonging to friends / family \u2014 with an audio call. Or you can record announcements that\u2019ll be played back on your speakers at home. But as long as you\u2019ve got the Alexa app on your phone, you can already do all of this with any set of earbuds \u2014 albeit not hands-free. It\u2019s nice to be able to check whether your smart lock is latched without pulling out your phone, but I don\u2019t think Alexa will be what sells the Echo Buds.\n\nBut their noise reduction and sound quality definitely will.\n\nAmazon collaborated with Bose on the Echo Buds, which feature the latter company\u2019s noise reduction technology. This is very much a case where words matter; noise reduction is different and less extensive than active noise cancellation. The Bose system used by the Echo Buds will eliminate annoying hums and cut down on street noise, but it\u2019s not the same kind of isolated feeling you get when wearing over-ear noise-canceling headphones. Even Bose itself says its upcoming wireless earbuds (due sometime next year) will outperform the Echo Buds in this regard.\n\nAGREE TO CONTINUE: AMAZON ECHO BUDS Every smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we\u2019re going to start counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate. Like any other set of earbuds, the Echo Buds can be used via traditional Bluetooth pairing without you agreeing to any terms and conditions in software. But the preferred way of setting them up is through the Alexa app for iOS and Android, which means you\u2019ll have to give the thumbs-up to the Alexa terms of use, Amazon\u2019s conditions of use, privacy policy, and Amazon\u2019s terms of service for its hardware devices, among others. You\u2019ll also have to agree to the company\u2019s conditions of use for Amazon services. And remember the inherent trust that you\u2019re putting in Amazon when using Alexa. Humans will potentially review your Alexa voice recordings unless you opt out of this process, and you\u2019ve always got the ability to manually delete your Alexa interactions. Final tally: No agreements are mandatory if you\u2019re using the Echo Buds as basic Bluetooth earbuds with reduced functionality. But there are at least five mandatory agreements and several optional ones if you want to use Alexa or configure the earbuds with the Alexa app.\n\nBut don\u2019t let that put a damper on your own experience. I\u2019m still quite satisfied with what the Echo Buds can do. You can definitely tell the difference between the noise isolation you get just from wearing the buds and the increased peace and quiet that comes with enabling noise reduction. By default, you can switch between noise reduction and pass-through ambient audio mode with a double tap of either earbud.\n\nIn the Alexa app, you\u2019re able to adjust the volume of the piped-in pass-through audio, but noise reduction is an on / off affair. Amazon\u2019s ambient mode isn\u2019t as natural-sounding as I\u2019ve recently heard from Bose\u2019s Noise Canceling Headphones 700 or the Beats Solo Pros. There\u2019s a distinctly digital quality to everything, and pass-through can get almost disorienting if you turn it on in a loud restaurant or bar. But it gets the job done fine if you need to have a quick chat with someone or hear an announcement.\n\nMuch to my surprise, the Echo Buds sound wonderful and are leaps and bounds better than the expectations I had coming in. The low end packs a wallop with strong, bumping bass. But it\u2019s not bloated, and the overall tonal balance put out by the dual-balanced Knowles armature drivers is very pleasing. I like them considerably more than Sony\u2019s expensive noise-canceling earbuds. More than the Galaxy Buds. I like them more than Jaybird\u2019s Vista earbuds, which were my general recommendation at this price point \u2014 until now. The Echo Buds aren\u2019t flawless, and I\u2019m sure some self-described audiophiles will say the sound signature is too blatantly tailored for modern music. And it is a perfect fit for Taylor Swift\u2019s Lover album. But the Echo Buds competently handle music spanning decades and genres, from Paul Simon to Post Malone. They deliver a lively listen that makes the debut album by The Highwomen shine, with nice separation between the four vocalists and a wide placement of instruments. The buds support AAC and SBC Bluetooth codecs, and you can make basic EQ adjustments in the Alexa app. If there\u2019s one weakness, it\u2019s that the Echo Buds never get super loud \u2014 if that\u2019s your thing \u2014 but they offered more than enough volume for my liking.\n\nThe other half to the sound quality equation is how the microphones handle voice calls. I\u2019ve had no complaints and people said I sounded clear when talking to them with the Echo Buds, so Amazon\u2019s beamforming mics and speech detection seem to produce good results. This is an area where Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Buds and even the Powerbeats Pro really struggle.\n\nLike any version 1.0 product, the Echo Buds aren\u2019t without their bugs. I\u2019ve had more than a few instances where saying \u201cAlexa\u201d got no response. (You\u2019ve got to speak up when using voice commands in general.) Occasionally, I\u2019ve heard a notification sound / chime while music is playing for no obvious reason. And you\u2019ll notice that when you adjust volume with noise reduction enabled, your music will sound different for a second or two before everything levels back out. (Amazon says that one is by design and a side effect of the noise reduction tech.) And I must mention that on my iPhone, I\u2019ve noticed some audio / video delay when watching select apps \u2014 but not all \u2014 including YouTube. This shouldn\u2019t be the case, according to Amazon.\n\nThose minor issues and the curse of Micro USB aside, I\u2019m downright impressed with the Echo Buds. They\u2019re Amazon\u2019s first earbuds, yes, but their fantastic sound quality shows the strides Amazon has made in audio. The upcoming Echo Studio speaker is another testament to Amazon\u2019s determination to make high-quality listening devices.\n\nApple\u2019s noise-canceling AirPods Pro are no doubt going to have a huge impact on the wireless earbuds category, but Amazon has managed to do a lot right on its first time out. And I think the $130 price is going to hit the right buttons for a lot of people when they\u2019re comparing the Echo Buds against $200 and $250 options from other brands.\n\nPhotography by Chris Welch / The Verge", "description": "Amazon\u2019s first truly wireless earbuds, the Echo Buds, exceed expectations with fantastic sound quality and effective Bose noise reduction.
