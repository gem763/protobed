Now I feel for Polly because she's going to have a dad in prison.\n\n'I don't want it to be embarrassing for her. It's such a small area so people will know Brad and I don't want that for her.'\n\nDevoted mother: The former TOWIE star is a parent to two-year old Polly, the younger of her two children, with former partner Bradley Wright\n\nIt was in 2014 that Bradley, while dating Amy, was originally sentenced to 18-months behind bars for handling stolen goods.\n\nThat conviction followed previous prison terms, including 16-months for theft in 2013 and a spell at a young offenders institute for burglary, handling stolen goods and driving offences in 2010.\n\nThe couple reunited following his release, and subsequently welcomed daughter Polly - their only child together - in April 2017.\n\nBehind bars: The builder, who has previously served time for similar offences, is now awaiting another spell at Her Majesty\u2019s pleasure after pleading guilty at Basildon Crown Court\n\nBut just six weeks after her birth they separated, with Amy eventually embarking on a new relationship with businessman Ritchie.\n\nThe pair welcomed a son together in September 2018, but the former TV personality has since revealed she is now single.\n\n'Any break-up is hard, let alone with a baby involved,' she said of their split. 'Of course I've been upset. There have been times I've cried, definitely. This isn't the life I'd dreamed I'd have, being a single mum. But we're happy and healthy.'\n\nAmy also revealed she won't be taking Polly to visit her father in prison, because he has only seen her 'about four times' throughout her young life.\n\n'If he was an amazing dad, then yes,' she said. 'But as he's only been in her life for six months I definitely wouldn't.'", "description": "She worked hard to lose two stone in six months.\u00a0 And Amy Childs showed off her incredible transformation in a stunning bikini selfie as she took to Instagram on Thursday.", "authors": ["Rebecca Lawrence For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/11/19483390-0-image-a-4_1570616013042.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
