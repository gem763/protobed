I behaved badly recently, and I\u2019m just going to admit it.\n\nAs a guest at a dinner party in Georgetown, I stormed in and started bossing everyone around. First, I demanded that the foyer be painted a different color and wainscoting be added to the dining room. Then I had my hosts assemble their children so I could give them all different names. Before making my exit, I grabbed two legs of turkey off the entree platter and stuffed them in my purse.\n\nI have a second confession. None of that happened. But if it had, I would be exactly like Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman.\n\nHe was born in Ukraine and raised there until age 3 1/2, when he was invited to our country. As you\u2019ve no doubt heard, he served in our military. Thank you for your service, Colonel!\n\nNow he is the top Ukrainian adviser on the National Security Council. Of all the people who could look out for the U.S.\u2019s interests vis-a-vis Ukraine, we got someone who was born there.\n\nAs such, Vindman was permitted to listen to a phone call the president of the United States made to the president of Ukraine -- a completely unnecessary, pro forma task.\n\nSo, naturally, when he had a policy disagreement with President Trump pertaining to the country he was born in, he thought he had a responsibility to agitate for removal proceedings against the duly elected U.S. president, just as I might have taken issue with the carpets in the Georgetown townhouse.\n\nFor some reason, we keep hearing about Col. Vindman\u2019s valor and patriotism. I don\u2019t doubt that he\u2019s a super swell guy. But unless I missed it in the newspapers at the time, I don't believe he was elected president in 2016. In fact, there's a specific constitutional provision that prevents Col. Vindman from ever being president: He wasn\u2019t born here.\n\nStudy question: Why might the framers have added that clause?\n\nIt would be bad enough if Col. Vindman\u2019s policy disagreement with the president had to do with U.S. policy on Mexico or North Korea. But it was about the country where Col. Vindman was born.\n\nWe\u2019re always told that Democrats don\u2019t have to prove wrongdoing by Trump -- for example, under the emoluments clause, in his foreign policy negotiations or when he fired his FBI director. Rather, it\u2019s claimed that Trump's conduct creates the appearance of impropriety.\n\nWell, having a Ukrainian-born analyst butt in to ensure U.S. foreign aid flows effortlessly to the country of his birth gives the appearance that he\u2019s concerned about fairness to Ukraine. That\u2019s not what this is supposed to be about. It\u2019s supposed to be about what\u2019s in the best interests of the United States.\n\nWorse, Vindman was dealing with the U.S.\u2019s Ukrainian policy versus Russia, which Ukrainians hate because Stalin murdered millions of them. It's like having an Armenian advise on whether we should be hostile to Turkey.\n\nThis is not the usual dual loyalty claim insultingly attributed to Irish or Jewish Americans who were born in this country. Lots of us have admixtures of other nationalities.\n\nBut when you were actually born in another country and that\u2019s the precise policy matter you\u2019re sticking your nose into, people are going to wonder if it\u2019s really our national interests you\u2019re looking out for.\n\nProposed Constitutional Amendment No. 1: Immigrants are required to wait a minimum of two (2) generations before bossing around the most successful, prosperous, free country on Earth, and fully three (3) generations before advising on our government\u2019s policy toward the countries of their forefathers.\n\nWe also need a constitutional amendment directed at 10th-generation Americans who fancy themselves foreign policy experts. Foreign policy is the idiot\u2019s shortcut to imagined erudition, the last refuge of the insufferable.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham was on TV last week, bragging about how he\u2019d been to Syria -- Afghanistan? Iraq? Who cares! -- 75 times.\n\nNot one person who voted for Graham has the peace and contentment of Syrians on his Top Ten Concerns list. Like everyone else, South Carolinians care about their jobs, their safety, their neighborhoods, their country.\n\nBut Sen. Graham wouldn\u2019t sound like a deep intellectual if he went on TV and started talking about water treatment plants, despite the fact that clean drinking water is of far greater interest to his constituents.\n\nIt\u2019s very romantic to think of yourself as a geopolitical chess player, jetting around the globe and staying in five-star hotels in Riyadh and Paris, chatting with dictators and reporting back your impressions as a Master of the Universe -- I\u2019m very concerned about the leadership of the Kurds ... Richard Haas wrote a fascinating treatise about how our policy has been deficient in the following nine ways ... I\u2019ll be sure to bring that up next week when I\u2019m meeting with the E.U.\n\nThese are the kinds of people who would join Mensa.\n\nIt would be annoying enough if government officials, whose salaries we pay, spent all their time working on the betterment of other nations, but at least everything turned out GREAT. In fact, however, they\u2019re never right, they always make things worse, and they never pay a price because, again, no one cares.\n\nProposed Constitutional Amendment No. 2: Elected officials may take one government-funded boondoggle abroad for every three (3) trips they make to our southern border.", "description": "I have a confession.
