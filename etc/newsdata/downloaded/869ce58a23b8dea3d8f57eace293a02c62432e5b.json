Biden says such claims are unfounded.\n\nFacebook didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from FOX Business about Legum's report, which showed \u201cI Love America\u201d posting content from Russia\u2019s Internet Research Agency. U.S. intelligence agencies say fake Facebook pages from the Kremlin-linked organization buoyed Trump's campaign in 2016.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver the past 90 days, the pages have garnered 30 million interactions with people who liked, shared or commented -- more than The Washington Post and The New York TImes, some of Facebook\u2019s top publishers.\n\nAlthough Facebook initially told Legum the page didn't violate its policies -- including one against \u201ccoordinated inauthentic behavior\u201d -- the social media behemoth later took the page down, citing rules against spam accounts.\n\nThe company is \u201ccontinuing to investigate for any further violations,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson told MarketWatch.\n\nAlthough CEO Mark Zuckerberg initially resisted accusations that misinformation posted on Facebook affected 2016 election, he changed tack in 2017.\n\nRussian Facebook groups spent $100,000 that year to purchase political ads, many of which focused on controversial topics such as immigration and race.\n\nBy the end of the year, Zuckerberg was vowing to \u201cfix\u201d Facebook, acknowledging the company made \u201ctoo many errors\" enforcing its policies and preventing misues of its tools.\n\n\"The world feels anxious and divided, and Facebook has a lot of work to do -- whether it's protecting our community from abuse and hate, defending against interference by nation states, or making sure that time spent on Facebook is time well spent,\" Zuckerberg wrote.\n\nIn 2018, the company strengthened efforts to identify inauthentic posts, particularly during elections, adding a \"war room\" and introducing new artificial-intelligence tools to bolster monitoring.\n\nThe initiatives have yet to alleviate government scrutiny, and some Republicans have accused Facebook of using them as a cover for suppressing conservative opinions.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "in recent weeks, the page, run by 10 Ukrainians, began circulating more positive content about President Trump.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/c5929da2-facebook-engineering_large-2116c6d70711c510VgnVCM100000d7c1a8c0____.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
