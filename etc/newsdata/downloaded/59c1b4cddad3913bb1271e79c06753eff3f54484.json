It\u2019s going to be weird. It\u2019s going to be funny. And it\u2019s going to wear its heart on its sleeve. With his latest film, Jojo Rabbit, all of those things are once again true but, of all Waititi\u2019s previous movies, it\u2019s probably has the biggest heart of them all. And the fact Waititi found that in the middle of comedy where he plays Adolf Fucking Hitler seems just about right.\n\nSet in Germany at the very end of World War II, a 10-year-old boy named Jojo (Robert Griffin Davis) is excited to be a Nazi. He doesn\u2019t really understand the ramifications of what being a Nazi actually means, but he\u2019s so excited to be part of something that he has Adolf Hitler himself, played with joyous idiocy by Waititi, as his imaginary friend.\n\nJojo goes off to a Nazi training camp for little kids and quickly realises he may not have what it takes to be a Nazi. This crushes him, because he sees being a Nazi as something powerful and cool. He soon gets another opportunity to prove himself when, at home, he finds a surprise. His mother (played by Scarlett Johansson) has hidden a young Jewish girl named Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) in their house in hopes of saving her from a fate that Jojo doesn\u2019t quite comprehend.\n\nJojo is torn. Does he turn this girl in? What could that do to his family? To himself? And what does his best friend Hitler have to say about it? Waititi, who also wrote the script based on the book Caging Skies by Christine Leunens (and whose mother is of Jewish heritage), begins that story by putting the humour forward. Jojo and Elsa each scheme for ways to best each other and more often than not, Jojo\u2019s ideas come from Hitler. This results in all manner of wildly over-the-top, supernatural stereotypes about Jewish people, Hitler acting all wacky, and the audience laughing at the absurdity of it all.\n\nYou\u2019ll fall for Scarlett Johansson all over again in Jojo Rabbit. (Photo: Fox Searchlight)\n\nThe ridiculousness begins to give way to the film\u2019s emotional centre, mainly through Jojo\u2019s relationship with his mother. Jojo eventually begins to understand why his mother would risk everything to keep this girl safe, even though it goes against everything he thinks he believes in. He learns about trust, compassion, and what it means to be human. All things incompatible with being a Nazi.\n\nThese are heavy concepts for a 10-year-old boy to deal with, but Griffin Davis balances them beautifully. As Jojo, he plays things a little goofy, a little confident, a little nervous, and a little brave, all rolled into one.\n\nWhether he\u2019s facing off with truly despicable Nazis (played by the likes of Sam Rockwell, Stephen Merchant, Rebel Wilson and Alfie Allen, all of whom are great, even as their roles require championing such a foul ideology) or warming up to Elsa, Jojo is always believable and heartwarming. That\u2019s especially true later in the film when things turn much worse for Jojo, and Germany, as the end of the war approaches.\n\nWhile Griffin Davis may be the standout, because he\u2019s the lead, all the young people in the film are excellent. As Elsa, McKenzie goes from scary to scared, and from strong to vulnerable, in the blink of an eye. She gives a much more nuanced performance than her counterpart, but it\u2019s warranted, as she\u2019s the older character and tasked with a much more nuanced role playing someone, unlike Jojo for much of the film, all too aware of the horrors of Nazism. Then there\u2019s Jojo\u2019s best friend Yorki, played by Archie Yates, who is so absolutely incredible with his quick wit and perfect comedic timing, that he effectively steals the whole movie.\n\nWhat happens after this is too funny. (Photo: Fox Searchlight)\n\nThe problem with Jojo Rabbit, and it\u2019s a small but significant one, is at the film\u2019s core, despite its omnipresent satire, its messages are rather basic. War is bad. Love is good. Obviously, telling that story by blending humour and heart, told through the point of view of two young children, with an imaginary characterisation of Hitler along for the ride, is absolutely not basic. It\u2019s also manic and constantly entertaining.\n\nBut in the end, while Jojo Rabbit seems set on making its audience think and feel, rather than just laugh, the film\u2019s takeaways are fairly ordinary, even as a sadly all-too-pertinent reminder that the Nazis perpetuated a monstrous set of beliefs.\n\nStill, the reason themes become common is because they are worthy and true. War is bad. Love is good. And getting a chance to be reminded of that through the genius mind of Taika Waititi is not a bad thing. And neither is Jojo Rabbit. It\u2019ll make you smile, it\u2019ll make you sad, and it\u2019ll make you believe in the best of us.\n\nJojo Rabbit opens in Australian theatres on December 26.", "description": "After films like What We Do in the Shadows, Hunt for the Wilderpeople, and even Thor: Ragnarok, we have a pretty good idea of what a Taika Waititi movie is going to be.
