Gee, separately blocked the Trump administration from implementing rules vastly expanding its ability to detain migrant children with their parents for indefinite periods.\n\nNearly 300,000 of the approximately 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States could be subject to expedited removal, according to the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. The typical undocumented immigrant has lived in the United States for 15 years, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nIn announcing the policy in July, acting Department of Homeland Security chief Kevin McAleenan said \u201cthe implementation of additional measures is a necessary response to the ongoing immigration crisis.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Saturday, a Justice Department spokesman said, \u201cCongress expressly authorized the Secretary of Homeland Security to act with dispatch to remove from the country aliens who have no right to be here. The district court\u2019s decision squarely conflicts with that express grant of authority and vastly exceeds the district court\u2019s own authority.\u201d\n\nOfficials said the new strategy responds to an influx of Central Americans and others across the southern border. The change allows the U.S. government to crank up deportations despite huge backlogs in understaffed immigration courts and the high cost of prisonlike detention centers run by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\n[ICE\u2019s chief called family detention \u2018summer camp.\u2019 Here\u2019s what it looks like inside.]\n\nUnder the new policy, any immigrants apprehended in the United States would have to prove to immigration officials that they have lived inside the country continuously for the past two years, or they could end up in immigration jails, facing summary expulsion.\n\nImmigration lawyers said the unprecedented expansion effectively would make U.S. agents both \u201cjudge and prosecutor,\u201d denying immigrants due process before the court or access to lawyers.\n\n\u201cUnder this unlawful plan, immigrants who have lived here for years would be deported with less due process than people get in traffic court,\u201d said ACLU Immigrant\u2019s Rights Project director Omar Jadwat.\n\nMcAleenan, in a federal notice, wrote that the new rule \u201cwill reduce incentives\u201d for migrants to enter the United States without authorization and swiftly move away from the border to avoid the faster deportation process.\n\nFederal officials said they could make exceptions for people with serious medical conditions or \u201csubstantial connections\u201d to the United States, and they said deportation would not necessarily be immediate. Officials said they have safeguards for migrants who might be U.S. citizens or legal residents.\n\nAsylum officers will interview immigrants who fear returning to their home countries, to determine whether they qualify for asylum or another form of protection, and officers potentially could refer them to full deportation proceedings. Unaccompanied minors from non-neighboring countries are not eligible for speedy deportations under federal law.\n\nThe U.S. government invoked its authority to fast-track deportations of undocumented immigrants who arrived by sea in 2002, after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. President George W. Bush expanded the program in 2004 to apply to all undocumented immigrants, however they entered the country, who are caught within 14 days within 100 miles of the border. The Bush administration said that issuing removal orders deterred migrants from trying to reenter the United States because that provision made it easier to charge them criminally if they were caught again.\n\nExpedited deportations soared from about 50,000 in 2004 to 193,000 in 2013, about 44 percent of the total number of people deported that year, according to the American Immigration Council.\n\nSince 2017, the caseload in immigration courts has soared to more than 900,000 cases, and ICE has more than 50,000 migrants in custody each day, a record.\n\nIn her opinion, Jackson noted that DHS implemented its \u201cNew Designation policy\u201d about 2\u00bd years after Trump signed an executive order to expand expedited removals to the fullest extent possible, which he did shortly after his swearing-in, without ever issuing a proposed rule or notice or soliciting public comment.\n\nThe Trump administration argued that its new program is exempt from the Administrative Procedure Act\u2019s public-comment requirements and that DHS sought comments on the change when announcing its launch. It said the policy would have taken effect Sept. 1 but told the court it has not yet been applied.\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump administration to expand its power to deport undocumented immigrants\n\nFederal judge blocks Trump administration from detaining migrant children for indefinite periods\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The administration was seeking to remove more undocumented immigrants without court review or access to lawyers.", "authors": ["Spencer S.
