You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cOn this gut issue, we know what president Obama did. We can\u2019t say for certain what governor Romney would have done,\u201d Biden, who is among those wanting to take on Donald Trump in 2020, said in a speech, suggesting their re-election slogan should have been \u201cBin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive\u201d.\n\nThe circumstances of Trump\u2019s declaration that Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had been killed in US military raid in Syria bore many similarities to Obama\u2019s announcement.\n\nStylistically, there were some points of divergence; Obama did not use the word \u201cwhimpering\u201d six times, and it was a different supposed ally, Pakistan rather than Turkey, that could not be trusted to keep secret the operation. Bin Laden was shot dead by Navy SEALs, while Baghdadi killed himself as Delta force soldiers closed in on him.\n\nWhat is also similar is that Trump will use the death of the Isis chief to boost his re-election chances, just as Obama did with the killing of the Al-Qaeda leader. Already, the White House has released an image of Trump watching stern-faced with his top generals as the operation unfolded, just as Obama did.\n\n\u201cThe United States has been searching for Baghdadi for many years,\u201d Trump said on Sunday morning, from the White House\u2019s Diplomatic Reception Room. \u201cCapturing or killing Baghdadi has been the top national security priority of my administration.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cBaghdadi has been on the run for many years, long before I took office. But at my direction, as commander-in-chief of the United States, we obliterated his caliphate, 100 per cent, in March of this year.\u201d\n\nThe killing of Baghdadi undoubtedly helps Trump\u2019s re-election bid. A tough, military-led counterterrorism stance is something that appeals to many Americans, especially one that results in the death of a man whose organisation executed four US hostages and posted the horror on the internet.\n\nIn a nod to the large number of evangelicals who voted for him in 2016, Trump was careful in his speech to point out that Isis was responsible for the deaths of large numbers of Christians, and other religious minorities, in the Middle East.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

(He also praised the governments of Russia, Syria, Turkey and Iraq. Moscow said on Monday the operation will be an asset to Trump.)\n\nWhat is less clear, is how much Baghdadi\u2019s death helps Trump\u2019s 2020 fortunes. His approval rating, as collated by Real Clear Politics, stands at just 41 points, which is perilously low for a president seeking re-election. We can expect that to push up a few points in the coming days, as new polling is reflected.\n\nThe trouble for the president is that most Americans have already made their mind up about him, and that the number of independent voters left to be won over is small.\n\nYet, Trump won his way to the narrowest of victories by around 70,000 votes spread over three states in the upper midwest \u2013 Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. He and his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, are using hundreds of millions of dollars to try and win every vote, and the death of Baghdadi will likely be featured heavily in that campaign.\n\nIn that sense, the comparison to watch may be less Obama\u2019s re-election strategy in 2012, than George W Bush in 2004. In that case, the Republicans had a candidate whose mangling of foreign names made Trump\u2019s rendering of \"Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi\" sound like that of a BBC newsreader.\n\nBush was a deeply divisive president who had just launched an unpopular war in the Middle East, and who, in John Kerry faced a Democrat challenger, who unlike the president, had a record of active duty in the military. Under the direction of political adviser Karl Rove, Bush and his vow of capturing Bin Laden \u201cdead or alive\u201d, made it over the finishing line with a popular vote victory of 51-48.\n\nTrump too will be hoping he can do the same, and that some of Rove\u2019s magic rubs off on him.\n\n\u201cLast night was a great night for the United States and for the world,\u201d he said on Sunday.\n\n\u201cA brutal killer, one who has caused so much hardship and death, has violently been eliminated. He will never again harm another innocent man, woman, or child. He died like a dog. He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place.\u201d", "description": "In the spring of 2011, an American president announced the killing of the world\u2019s most wanted man.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/27/14/eh48omcwoaelabe.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
