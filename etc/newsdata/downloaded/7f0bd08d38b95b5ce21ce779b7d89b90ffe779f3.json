The incident has put the region on edge and led to fears of a military confrontation that could involve Iran, Saudi Arabia, the U.S., and other nations.\n\nThe Pentagon late Friday announced that more U.S. troops will head to the region to deter Iran. But Mr. Pompeo said the Trump administration remains focused on diplomacy and is pinning its hopes on this week\u2019s United Nations General Assembly meeting in New York.\n\n\u201cThe whole world understands that Iran is the bad actor, they are the evil force in the region,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I hope this week here in New York the world will come together to push back against this and convince the Iranian leadership this behavior is unacceptable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the world\u2019s responsibility to respond [to] these state-on-state acts of war that took place in Saudi Arabia this past week,\u201d Mr. Pompeo added.\n\nThe administration late last week also announced another round of economic sanctions on Iran in response to the oil attack in Saudi Arabia. While the U.S. and Saudi Arabia made clear that they believe Iran is responsible for the attacks, neither country has explicitly said that the rockets and drones used to target the oil facilities were fired from inside Iran.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
