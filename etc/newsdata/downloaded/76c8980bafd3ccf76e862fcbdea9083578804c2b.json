SCHW, -3.86% on Tuesday said it was planning to eliminate commissions on U.S. stocks, exchange-traded funds and options trades, effective Oct. 7., with rivals TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. AMTD, -2.06% and E-Trade Financial Corp. ETFC, +1.28% announcing plans to follow suit, marking a fresh skirmish in the brokerage war for greater market share, particularly among coveted millennial investors.\n\nInteractive Brokers Group Inc. IBKR, -0.88% also announced last week that it is rolling out a new \u201clite\u201d version of its trading platform with free, unlimited trading for U.S. equities.\n\nRead: Stocktwits set to launch commission-free trading platform to rival Robinhood, others\n\nFor Stocktwits\u2019s part, executives of the social-media outfit founded in 2008, don\u2019t view it as stepping into a discount-brokerage donnybrook with the giants of the industry but delivering an opportunity for its community to act on some of the ideas that emerge during their numerous exchanges.\n\n\u201cBrokers are now realizing that free equity trading is now table stakes, especially for people just getting started in investing,\u201d Ian Rosen, CEO of Stocktwits, told MarketWatch in a recent interview.\n\n\u201cFree may help people start, but it takes a social and community aspect to keep the next generation of investors engaged,\u201d he said. Stocktwits members exchange some 150,000 messages daily on average, with 45% of the platform\u2019s roughly 350,000 monthly active users on the site every day, Rosen said.\n\nStill, competition in the realm of offering trading services to personal investors has been brisk, even before Schwab and others lowered fees.\n\nA number of nontraditional brokerage platforms, including Robinhood Markets Inc., already are enticing young investors with some level of free trading.\n\n\u201cThe changes taking place across the brokerage industry reflect a focus on the customer that\u2018s been inherent to Robinhood since the beginning,\u201d said Robinhood spokesman Jack Randall in emailed comments after Schwab\u2019s zero-fee announcement. \u201cWe remain focused on offering intuitively designed products that reduce barriers to our financial system, including account minimums and commission fees.\u201d\n\nRosen said Stocktwits\u2019s Trade App intends to facilitate real-time sharing and learning about investing, which he feels may be lost in the scramble to zero fees by some of the larger competitors and other rivals.\n\n\u201cWe also offer the ability to buy fractional shares in dollar amounts so newer investors,\u201d can afford to buy shares of companies like Amazon and Google-parent Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, +0.98% at $1,188 a share and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.65%, which has seen its shares trade at around $1,720 on Thursday.\n\nTrade App, will operate as a registered broker-dealer and Stocktwits subsidiary, overseen by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. In addition to whole shares, the company will let clients buy and sell fractional stocks.\n\nCheck out: The downside of Charles Schwab free-commission trading\n\nRosen says the platform will roll out on Apple Inc.\u2019s IOS and eventually expand to other platforms.\n\n\u201cWe think when we look at other platforms out there, we actually have a deep committed community,\u201d the Stocktwits CEO said. \u201cPeople want to commiserate the lows and celebrate the highs,\u201d he said about his users's desire to interact on the Trade App platform.\n\nCertainly, highs and lows have been front and center for investors, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.47%, the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.80% and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.12% producing their worst start to a quarter on Wednesday since the 2008-09 financial crisis.", "description": "Social-media platform Stocktwits officially kicks off commission-free trading on Thursday, with the debut of a mobile-focused brokerage unit that is aimed at...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS616_trade__MG_20191003143142.jpg"}
