But the good news came with a steep bill, and it wasn\u2019t for tuition.\n\nThat April, court records show, Semprevivo used a family trust to pay $400,000 to a charity run by the consultant who had advised the son on his college search.\n\nAD\n\nSemprevivo acknowledged this year in federal court that the check represented something else: a payoff for getting his son into the highly selective university through an athletic recruiting ruse.\n\nAD\n\nHis son, it turned out, was just a recreational tennis player and never swung a racket in intercollegiate competition for the Hoyas.\n\n\u2018Three spots\u2019: Alleged bribery of tennis coach stings Georgetown admissions\n\nSemprevivo pleaded guilty in May to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. In addition to the prison term, U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani sentenced him Thursday to two years of supervised release, 500 hours of community service and a $100,000 fine. Talwani indicated that a further hearing will be held on questions about restitution for Georgetown\u2019s legal expenses.\n\nAD\n\nOn Sept. 13, Talwani sentenced actress Felicity Huffman to two weeks of incarceration for her role in the scandal. On Tuesday, the judge sentenced businessman Devin Sloane to four months.\n\nWith the three sentences, the judge signaled that punishment will vary depending on the scheme each parent pursued. Huffman arranged to purchase a fraudulent admission test score for one of her daughters. Sloane and Semprevivo both conspired to subvert the admissions process at specific universities, which the judge noted had the effect of depriving other applicants of a spot at those schools.\n\nAD\n\nNineteen other parents accused in the scandal are fighting charges, while a 20th was detained last week in Spain and awaits extradition to Boston.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI am mortified that I have done this and take full responsibility,\u201d Semprevivo wrote in August in a letter to Talwani. \u201cIt is something I will regret for the rest of my life. \u2026 It brings me great shame that I have now set a terrible example for college bound students and their parents across the nation.\u201d\n\nIn the courtroom, Semprevivo reiterated his regret. At one point he turned to look at and apologize to his wife, who was sitting on a bench. He paused to collect himself, then choked up again when he apologized for bringing shame to his family and friends. \u201cI\u2019ve let you all down,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the first and only crime, and certainly the last crime, I\u2019ll ever commit.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nProsecutors had sought 13 months in prison for Semprevivo, plus a year of supervised release, a $95,000 fine and a restitution payment to Georgetown of $105,342 that the university incurred in legal fees. Semprevivo\u2019s attorneys asked Talwani for a sentence of probation and community service.\n\nAD\n\nThe consultant at the center of the scandal, William \u201cRick\u201d Singer, has pleaded guilty to racketeering conspiracy and other crimes and is cooperating with federal investigators. Singer sought in various ways to help the children of wealthy clients obtain fake admission test scores and use phony athletics credentials to get into universities through what he called a \u201cside door.\u201d\n\nDuring the hearing, Talwani lectured parents who sought special treatment for children who already had many advantages. \u201cI think the question you need to ask is what makes your children entitled to a side door?\u201d the judge said.\n\nAD\n\nGeorgetown officials declined to comment after the sentence.\n\nAD\n\nFor the prestigious Jesuit university in the nation\u2019s capital, the scandal exposed weaknesses in its oversight of athletics. The university quietly ousted its tennis coach, Gordon Ernst, after learning in late 2017 of irregularities in his recruiting.\n\nWhen federal authorities disclosed the admissions scandal in March 2019, they charged Ernst with racketeering conspiracy. They alleged that Singer paid Ernst more than $2.7 million in bribes over several years in exchange for the coach\u2019s designating at least 12 applicants as recruits. One was Semprevivo\u2019s elder son. (The son was not charged with a crime.) In the year the son was admitted, Georgetown rejected about 84 percent of applicants.\n\nErnst has pleaded not guilty. His trial date has not been set. Georgetown officials this year announced tighter protocols for reviewing credentials of athletics recruits. They also dismissed two students and are reviewing the records of former students who may be connected to the scandal. Georgetown did not identify the expelled students, but court records indicate that Adam Semprevivo, Stephen Semprevivo\u2019s elder son, was one of them.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn May, Adam Semprevivo filed a federal lawsuit seeking to block his dismissal. He said in the suit that he had been unaware of the steps his father took in 2015 and 2016, working with Singer, that gave rise to questions about his Georgetown application. He said he had been a student at Georgetown in good standing with a 3.18 grade-point average, and he accused the university of an unfair disciplinary process.\n\nAdam Semprevivo dropped the suit in July.\n\nStephen Semprevivo, a father of two, holds a bachelor\u2019s degree and master\u2019s degree in business administration from Harvard University. He was a successful executive at numerous companies, according to court records. His most recent employer fired him in May.\n\nAD\n\nSheila Balkan, a criminologist who submitted a letter to the court for Semprevivo, said the businessman fell prey to a corrupt admissions consultant who knew the insecurities of affluent parents.\n\n\u201cThe man was adept at finding blind spots in successful people where others saw strengths,\u201d she wrote. \u201cStephen was, in many ways, an ideal mark for Singer. Harvard had played such a key role early in Stephen\u2019s career that he understood, perhaps better than most people, how seminal the choice of a university can be.\u201d\n\nAnderson reported from Washington.\n\nAD", "description": "Stephen Semprevivo pleaded guilty to fraud conspiracy after paying $400,000 to help his son get into Georgetown as a phony tennis recruit.", "authors": ["Karen Weintraub", "Nick Anderson", "Reporter Covering Higher Education", "National Education Policy", "The Global Education Market"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/3AfE1E7MnM1D9_qhFLe5Od36PFA=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NNAWTFHANMI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg"}
