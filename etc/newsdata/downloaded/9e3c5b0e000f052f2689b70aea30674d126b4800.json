UPDATE 2-Brexit rally fizzles as deal faces parliamentary hurdle\n\n* Brexit deal agreement initially boosts pound\n\n* Deal still needs parliamentary approval, doubts linger\n\n* Domestic stocks come off highs, UK yields fall\n\n\n\n(Adds details)\n\nBy Olga Cotaga and Thyagaraju Adinarayan\n\nLONDON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - The surge in sterling and the\n\nrally in Britain's domestically-exposed stocks fizzled on\n\nThursday as investors braced for a showdown in the UK parliament\n\nover the new Brexit deal agreed between Brussels and London.\n\nEuropean Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said\n\nBritain and the European Union had, after a week of intense\n\ntalks, sealed a new Brexit agreement.\n\nBoth sides had found a \"legally operative solution\" to avoid\n\na hard border in Ireland - a key sticking point, EU chief\n\nnegotiator Michel Barnier told reporters.\n\nThat sent the pound up as much as 1.1% to a five-month high\n\nand within a whisker of $1.30, while UK stocks that make most of\n\ntheir money at home surged.\n\nBut the gains were temporary as the Northern Irish\n\nDemocratic Unionist Party (DUP) that British Prime Minister\n\nBoris Johnson relies on in parliament said it would vote against\n\nthe deal at an extraordinary session on Saturday. That revived fears that Johnson will suffer the same fate as\n\nhis predecessor: a failure to get British lawmakers to support\n\nthe plan for the departure, plunging the country into another\n\nround of uncertainty.\n\n\"Amid the optimism about a deal, it is important to remember\n\nthat the agreement still has to be agreed by the EU27 heads of\n\nstate as well as the UK parliament. As things stand,\n\nparliamentary ratification is far from certain,\" Dean Turner, an\n\neconomist at UBS, said.\n\nThe pound was down 0.2% by 1235 GMT, hitting $1.2793\n\nGBP=D3 - far below the $1.2988 level touched earlier in the\n\nday.\n\nSterling has been on a rollercoaster ride recently, and is\n\nup 7% since early September when it hit the lowest since October\n\n2016 at $1.19.\n\nVolatility expectations for sterling over the next week have\n\njumped to their highest since the 2016 Brexit referendum,\n\nunderlying investors' nerves.\n\nAgainst the euro, sterling dropped 0.7% to 87 pence, having\n\nearlier reached 85.77 pence EURGBP=D3 .\n\nThe euro was buoyed by news of a deal and was last up 0.4%\n\nat $1.1116 EUR=EBS while the dollar index fell 0.3% .\n\nThe UK's FTSE mid-cap stocks index was well off its\n\nday's high and was last trading up 0.3%. The blue-chip\n\nexporter-heavy FTSE 100 index rose 0.8% on sterling's\n\nreversal.\n\nBritish government bond yields initially surged, with\n\n10-year yields hitting 0.79%, their highest since July\n\n, before falling slightly on the day to 0.69%.\n\n\"It looks like we've got something that would be the basis\n\nfor a vote,\" said Kit Juckes, macro strategist at Societe\n\nGenerale. \"Now we will try to scramble up if he (Johnson) has\n\ngot enough votes to pass the deal through the parliament.\"\n\nSTOCKS AND RATE CUTS\n\nThe agreement on a deal, while still to face a parliamentary\n\ntest, has triggered a rethink on the outlook for UK stocks.\n\nJPMorgan's basket of London-listed companies .JPDEUKDM\n\nthat make their cash at home has enjoyed a meteoric rally in the\n\npast week.\n\nIn this period it has vastly outperformed the FTSE 100 and\n\nFTSE 250 . The benchmark is considered a barometer of\n\nBrexit worries.\n\n\"While Parliament approval is still required, the news today\n\nshould provide legs to the rotation from UK exporters to\n\ndomestic plays,\" Barclays Capital European equities strategist\n\nEmmanuel Cau.\n\n\n\nOptimism that a Brexit deal would be finalised saw money\n\nmarkets reduce expectations of rate cuts from the Bank of\n\nEngland.
