The two sides recently settled, and Davis charged that Buttigieg tried to sweep the case under the rug by including a gag order in that agreement.\n\nPete Buttigieg: police killing exposes mayor's troubled history with minorities Read more\n\nSeparately, community leaders and the family of Eric Logan, a black man killed by white officers in South Bend in March, are questioning why the city\u2019s police and fire departments aren\u2019t conducting a criminal investigation into two separate incidents in which cars belonging to Logan\u2019s mother caught fire.\n\nThe fire department determined both were caused by engine fires, but the family\u2019s supporters say both cars were turned off, and they suspect foul play.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d expect this kind of stuff to happen in the 50s, 60s,\u201d said Mario Sims, a South Bend activist and pastor. \u201cThis is racism at best and corruption at worst. How do you have a police department that does not investigate crimes?\u201d\n\nThe new round of questions come after the Logan tragedy and the Buttigieg administration\u2019s handling of it put a national spotlight on the 37-year-old mayor\u2019s strained relationship with South Bend\u2019s black residents. It exposed frustration over racial and economic inequality, and was only the latest in a long succession of flashpoints between the city\u2019s minorities and its police department.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Pete Buttigieg addresses a crowd in Galivants Ferry, South Carolina, 16 September 2019.

Prior to the Logan killing, Buttigieg\u2019s poll numbers steadily climbed and peaked in June, but they have since slipped.\n\nHis numbers fell despite attempts to address some of the concerns, including new plans focused on racism and police reform. But Sims said Buttigieg\u2019s plans and comments on race from the campaign are galling as questions around the Logan case persist and new controversies materialize.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had to endure all of this and the ridiculous statements and professions of a mayor who is now a candidate saying \u2018I believe in transparency\u2019, but if you look at his record, no he doesn\u2019t,\u201d Sims said.\n\nThe lawsuits grew out of a controversy over a 2012 letter that then-South Bend council member Davis sent a letter to Obama\u2019s justice department asking it to investigate accusations of racial bias and brutality in the South Bend police department.\n\nDavis said he penned the letter after four white officers were recorded by the department\u2019s spokesperson making what she characterized as racist comments about the city\u2019s black police chief. As part of its response, the Buttigieg administration demoted the police chief, fired the spokesperson and \u2013 so far \u2013 have successfully fought to keep the tapes from being released.\n\nIn his letter to the justice department, Davis, who is once again running for council and likely to win a seat in November, also noted that an unarmed black man died in police custody in 2012. Davis said he was harassed by the department\u2019s white officers after sending the letter, including one incident in which police pulled him over and drew guns on him.\n\nIn 2014, the four officers caught on tape sued Davis for libel, arguing he didn\u2019t have the authority to send the request on council letterhead and the Buttigieg administration informed Davis the city\u2019s attorneys wouldn\u2019t represent him. Davis said he believes city attorneys were obligated to defend him, and claimed the suit was a clear attempt to intimidate and silence him.\n\nDavis sued the city and Buttigieg administration for refusing to defend him.\n\nA judge in June tossed out the officers\u2019 lawsuit, and Davis said the city in August approached him with a proposed settlement. However, the settlement included a gag order, Davis said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A police shooting in South Bend put a national spotlight on the 37-year-old mayor\u2019s strained relationship with the city\u2019s black residents.

The city offered a second deal that allows him to talk about the case, though he still can\u2019t discuss the settlement\u2019s particulars. A Buttigieg spokesperson declined to comment on the gag order, and Davis said he remains frustrated with the administration.\n\n\u201cThe same guy who\u2019s on a national stage asking to have the Sandra Bland case reopened, calling out Trump for not being transparent and talking about police brutality is the same guy that is ordering his legal staff to kill the free speech of an African-American elected official,\u201d Davis said.\n\nThat issue simmers as suspicion grows over June and August fires that destroyed cars belonging to Shirely Newbill, Eric Logan\u2019s mother. The first fire occurred before police killed Logan, and the South Bend fire department assessed both as engine fires, so police did not open a criminal investigation. Supporters say they believe an investigation was quashed. A Buttigieg spokesperson said that was not the case, but declined to comment further.\n\nThe Logan family attorney Brian Coffman, who is also acting as the family\u2019s spokesperson, said he is skeptical of the fire department\u2019s conclusion, especially \u201cgiven the temperature of South Bend\u201d.\n\n\u201cCars don\u2019t catch on fire if they\u2019re turned off and sitting in the street unless there\u2019s some sort of incendiary device,\u201d Coffman said. \u201cI think it\u2019s arson. The problem is, just like in the Eric Logan case, the police and city don\u2019t want to disclose any information and are keeping everything under wraps.\u201d", "description": "Amid new policing-related controversies, black leaders in South Bend say the mayor\u2019s record conflicts with his campaign rhetoric", "authors": ["Tom Perkins"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32d8c07ca732826d7f107a766840040f6b4eea58/0_155_4385_2631/master/4385.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8eda2763cdd97ea15f06d2291ac453b3", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
