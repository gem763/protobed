They are merely part of the parade of witnesses that Democrats have assembled in a pantomime apparently aimed at convincing the public Trump did something wrong.\n\nAccording to NPR, Croft in particular will testify about her \u201cbelief in the importance of Ukraine\u2019s future to U.S. national interests\u201d and her concern at attempts to fire Obama holdovers. She did not hear the Ukraine call first-hand.\n\nThe closed-door sessions are proceeding in spite of the fact that Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) has scheduled a full House vote on whether to authorize the hearings as an \u201cimpeachment inquiry,\u201d and providing the rules to guide it going forward. Republicans have called her capitulation on that point a tacit admission that the process, until now, has been unauthorized and arbitrary. Yet it continues nonetheless, with ongoing one-sided leaks.\n\nJoel B. Pollak is Senior Editor-at-Large at Breitbart News.
