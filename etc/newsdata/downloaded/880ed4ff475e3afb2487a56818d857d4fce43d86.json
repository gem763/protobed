On the third, the president on Saturday made the rare move of reversing course in response to outcry \u2014 both public and private \u2014 from some of the same Republicans who have typically defended him.\n\nThe GOP opposition came from multiple fronts.\n\nOn Fox News, the president\u2019s go-to news outlet, legal analysts, including former Judge Andrew Napolitano Andrew Peter NapolitanoTrump urges GOP to fight for him Pelosi promotes video of Fox News legal analyst slamming Trump's Doral location for G-7 meeting Fox News legal analyst: Trump's move to host G-7 at Doral resort 'direct' and 'profound' violation of Constitution MORE, charged the president with flagrant violations of the constitutional ban on accepting foreign gifts.\n\nThose criticisms were echoed by a handful of centrist Republicans who voiced public concerns that the Doral decision, if not illegal, created unflattering perceptions that the president was using the office to boost his business interests.\n\nPrivately, a group of moderate Republican lawmakers, including Reps.

I think it hit their attention because it wasn\u2019t the typical anti-Trump crowd,\u201d said one moderate House Republican who reached out to express concerns to the White House.\n\n\u201cEven if there was no profiting, the appearance of impropriety caused major heartburn,\u201d the GOP lawmaker added. \u201cMany of us viewed it as an unforced error even though I believe Trump when he says he was trying to limit costs and go to a secure location.\u201d\n\nThe pushback arrives as Trump has become increasingly isolated on a handful of issues churning headlines this month \u2014 and creating new headaches for the president and his allies on Capitol Hill.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLast week, after Trump pulled U.S. troops from northern Syria, House lawmakers voted overwhelmingly on a resolution rebuking the decision. The absence of U.S. forces had led to an immediate invasion by Turkish troops that threatened to obliterate the Kurdish rebels who have fought against ISIS on behalf of the United States for years. Almost 130 Republicans voted with Democrats to condemn the move \u2014 joining prominent Senate critics like Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Addison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellTrump urges GOP to fight for him Senate Dems signal they'll support domestic spending package Trump's top picks for Homeland Security chief are ineligible for job: reports MORE (R-Ky.) and Sen.

Those dealings have become the focus of the Democrats\u2019 month-old impeachment inquiry into the president, and several Republicans haven\u2019t ruled out the possibility that they\u2019d vote for impeachment articles, if the process evolves that far.\n\nBoth Kinzinger and Rep. Francis Rooney Laurence (Francis) Francis RooneyTrump urges GOP to fight for him Bill Press: Mulvaney proves need for daily briefings Trump urges GOP to defend him more strongly on impeachment MORE (R-Fla.), who represents a deeply conservative district which Trump carried by 20 points in 2016, are now leaving open the possibility of joining the Democrats\u2019 impeachment push. A third Republican, a moderate, also told The Hill he can\u2019t rule out backing impeachment until he sees all the evidence of the Ukraine probe.\n\n\u201cWhatever might have been gray and unclear before is certainly quite clear right now that the actions were related to getting \u2026 Ukraine to do some of these things,\u201d Rooney, a former ambassador under former President George W. Bush, told CNN over the weekend.\n\nRooney is a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, one of the three panels leading the\u2019 impeachment inquiry. As part of that effort, the committees have deposed a series of witnesses \u2014 both inside and outside the administration \u2014 with firsthand knowledge of Trump\u2019s pressure campaign on Ukrainian leaders.\n\nMost Republicans participating in those depositions have remained fiercely faithful to Trump, saying the president has done nothing wrong and accusing Democrats of conducting a counterfeit impeachment process that denies the public a window into the proceedings.\n\nIn fact, Trump\u2019s House Freedom Caucus allies on Monday night forced a vote on a resolution to censure Democrats\u2019 point person on impeachment, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff Adam Bennett SchiffSchiff punches back after GOP censure resolution fails Trump urges GOP to fight for him House rejects GOP measure censuring Schiff MORE (D-Calif.).\n\n\u201cThis is about impeaching the president of the United States 13 months before an election because they\u2019re afraid that he\u2019s going to win in 2020,\u201d former Freedom Caucus Chairman Jim Jordan James (Jim) Daniel JordanTrump urges GOP to fight for him Trump embarks on Twitter spree amid impeachment inquiry, Syria outrage Testimony from GOP diplomat complicates Trump defense MORE (Ohio), the top Republican on the House Oversight and Reform Committee, told Fox on Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s what this is about.\u201d\n\nDespite the fact that GOP leaders are rallying behind Trump, at Monday\u2019s Cabinet meeting the president \u2014 famous for demanding loyalty \u2014 decried what he views as treachery within the GOP ranks as the impeachment drum grows louder.

They don\u2019t have people like that.\u201d\n\nBrett Samuels contributed.", "description": "President Trump delivered a pointed message Monday to Republicans beginning to break from their White House ally amid Democrats\u2019 escalating impeachment investigation: Fight harder for me.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpdonald_102119getty_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
