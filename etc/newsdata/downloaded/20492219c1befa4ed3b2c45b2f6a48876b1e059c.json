Harris, has received glowing reviews from critics at The New York Times, The Wrap and the Washington Post.\n\nBut its theme was inflammatory enough to launch a Change.org petition for the play to be shut down, racking up nearly 6,000 signatures as of Monday.\n\nPetition maker Ashley B slammed the production as 'one of most disrespectful displays of anti-Black sentiment disguised as art that I have ever seen.'\n\nThe play follows three interracial couples through sex therapy on a Southern plantation where they work out their issues through slavery role play. The work includes graphic opening sex scenes and explores how racial dynamics from the past affect relationships, identity, sexuality.\n\nThe highly-anticipated and controversial production Slave Play opened on Sunday on Broadway, but has received a bag of mixed reviews for its story line that focuses on interracial couples and sprinkles in racial stereotypes, graphic sex, and a jarring rape scene\n\nThe play, written by black queer playwright Jeremy O. Harris, first appeared at New York Theater Workshop last December and officially opened on Broadway on Sunday at the Golden Theatre\n\nA Change.org petition was created to shut down the production when it first played at the New York Theater Workshop and has racked up nearly 6,000 signatures. The petition slams the show as a 'disrespectful display of anti-Black sentiment disguised as art'\n\nThe play is written by Jeremy O. Harris and directed by Robert O'Hara, both are black and queer\n\nThe Change.org petition slams the director Robert O'Hara, and writer Jeremy O. Harris - both queer black men - saying they were 'vicious in their depictions of slavery, Black sexuality, and specifically targets black women.'\n\n'I am extremely disappointed that all involved thought this was an appropriate tool to challenge that status quo on race relations,' petition maker Ashley B. said.\n\nIt adds: 'As a Black woman I was terribly offended and traumatized by the graphic imagery mixed with laughter from a predominantly white audience.'\n\nSo far over 5,900 people have signed that petition that was started 10 months ago when the play was first shown at the New York Theater Workshop last December.\n\nThe New York Post slammed the piece as a 'thoughtful mess' that starts with three pornographic scenes, uses 'blatantly offensive stereotypes' for laughs and 'lags' in its production.\n\nDespite the criticism, the show has been praised as a 'funny, scaling, walk along the boundary between black and white in America' by the Washington Post\n\nTheaterMania slammed the piece saying: 'It explores the fetishizing of domination and submission along racial lines. It disturbs our sense of propriety by making the horrific comical'\n\nSome critics have slammed the piece for making comedy out of the darkest parts of racism.\n\n'The play contains startling depictions of rape. It explores the fetishizing of domination and submission along racial lines. It disturbs our sense of propriety by making the horrific comical,' TheaterMania's Pete Heampstead said.\n\nOthers have reamed the play for being underdeveloped, noting that Slave Play is the fruit of Harris' first year in Yale's School of Drama.\n\n'The ideas are sophomoric, and once you get over the coarse sex talk and associated depictions, Slave Play sounds like something being worked out in a college class. Or a parody of one,' critic Roger Friedman said on the piece.\n\nStill the piece has been highly acclaimed and praised as a work of genius for pushing the boundaries.\n\n'I know the prospect of seeing slavery depicted in this way is a turn off for many black people \u2014 their hesitation and dubiousness is understandable,' New York Time's Aisha Harris said. 'But for those of us who choose to endure it, we might just find a new way of living in that uncomfortable space, and reimagine the possibilities of what theater can give us.'\n\nTwitter's two cents: Twitter users said many disturbed viewers kept quiet about their critique of Slave Play, because they wanted to support the work of art as a whole\n\nThis Twitter user said that some black viewers found the work traumatizing\n\nComedian Rae Sanni criticized playwright Harris for 'using the black female body and rape/sexual trauma to work out his weird fixation on white romantic partners'\n\nShe said the play was 'weird' and she was in disbelief with the raving reviews\n\nThis Twitter user declared 'We DO not need another slave movie nor slave play'\n\nThe Washington Post praised the piece as a 'funny, scaling, walk along the boundary between black and white in America'. Writer Peter Marks said he left the show feeling that it 'opened my eyes and ears more fully, and gratefully.'\n\n'Jeremy O. Harris' broad send-up of race and sex in America, Slave Play, isn\u2019t outrageously funny. But it does have its funny moments \u2014 and it certainly is outrageous,' Variety's Marilyn Stasio noted.\n\nSome Twitter user who have seen the show were critical of the play.\n\nComedian Rae Sanni took to Twitter asking for honest opinions of the production.\n\n'A gay black man using the black female body and rape/sexual trauma to work out his weird fixation on white romantic partners when there was a perfectly good gay couple he could have worked his personal issues out through etc,' she said critiquing Harris.\n\n'The s**t was weird and I can\u2019t believe the reviews are of the same show I saw FIN,' she added.\n\n'Broadway is now debuting a show called, Slave Play, written by some Lee Daniels wannabe. And yes it's about exactly what the name implies. Abusing black people is all fun & games,' another Twitter user wrote.\n\n'The white supremacist puppets have been praising this garbage, but as far as ticket sales...well let's just say, the proof is in the pudding. Nobody cares to break their neck to see it,' another added.\n\n'Disgusting,' another Twitter user slammed.\n\nThe New York Times praised the piece but acknowledged it could be 'unsettling'\n\nThe Wrap praised the piece calling it a 'satire about race relations' but said it could be triggering\n\nThe Washington Post praised the piece as a 'funny, scaling, walk along the boundary between black and white in America'. Writer Peter Marks said he left the show feeling that it 'opened my eyes and ears more fully, and gratefully'\n\nTwitter user Nissyiam tweeted: 'I think there are so many conversations about Slave Play not happening. The most tragic is there are valid and salient critiques that are being silenced/folx are silencing themselves because this play is a cultural moment.'\n\nShe criticized play critics for their raving reviews that ignored the voice of the black community.\n\n'Their commentary shouldn't be seen as unwanted or invalid. It is Black Folx (BLACK FOLX) saying \"Hey you thought you did something but actually no and here's why this is still traumatizing. I may have giggled but I am not healed. Let's talk,\"' she said.\n\n'For some, Slave Play is transformative and exactly what they needed to get by, exactly the words they needed. For others, it is basic, saying (not necessarily doing but saying) nothing new and the mirror, the music, the theories behind it ain't enough to cosign,' she added.\n\nThe play's writer Harris says that he's been criticized for his 'boldness' in the play, but argues it's also what makes it unique.\n\nHe said members of the black community felt he had a 'recklessness or boldness' in putting the play 'onstage in front of white people'.\n\nSlave Play is playing at the Golden Theater on Broadway.", "description": "Slave Play opened on Broadway on Sunday and it has sparked outrage for its 'blatantly offensive racial stereotypes', 'abuse' of black people, graphic rape scene that left some 'disgusted'.", "authors": ["Marlene Lenthang For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/19/19409054-0-image-a-69_1570473686573.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
