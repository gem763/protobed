Mr. Mitchill would replace Akhil Johri, who plans to step down from United Technologies on Nov. 1, after nearly five years in the role, Chief Executive Greg Hayes said on a call with analysts.\n\nThe Raytheon deal is expected to close next year. When it does, the top finance role at Raytheon Technologies, the combined company, will be taken over by Raytheon CFO Anthony F. O\u2019Brien, Raytheon said in September.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nMr. Mitchill\u2019s experience as an interim could set him up for a permanent executive role under Mr. O\u2019Brien, analysts said. \u201cOne could imagine them promoting him to a deputy CFO role at the combined entity,\u201d said Josh Sullivan, a managing director at Seaport Global Securities LLC, an investment bank.\n\nEstablishing Mr. Mitchill as a potential contender for future finance roles at the combined company would be in line with previous internal promotions at United Technologies, Mr. Sullivan said. Mr. Johri, the outgoing CFO, served in various finance positions before he was promoted to the top job in January 2015.\n\nThe role as acting CFO would give Mr. Mitchill more exposure to analysts and investors and make him more familiar with a bigger finance role, Mr. Sullivan said.\n\nUnited Technologies declined to comment beyond Mr. Hayes\u2019s remarks during the company\u2019s earnings call.\n\nIt isn't unusual for companies to use interim positions as training ground for executives, recruiters said. CSX Corp. this month made its interim CFO permanent, while eBay Inc. in September appointed its finance head as interim CEO following the departure of Devin Wenig.\n\nThe departure of Mr. Johri ahead of the completion of the Raytheon merger could point toward him preparing for a new role at another industrial company, said Nick Heymann, co-head of the global industrial infrastructure group at William Blair & Co., an investment bank.\n\nAs an interim CFO at United Technologies, Mr. Mitchill is expected to be involved in completing the planned spinoff of Carrier Global Corp., a heating-and-cooling systems business, and of Otis Elevator Co., a maker of elevators and escalators, analysts said.\n\n\u201cA lot of what Mr. Mitchill will be doing is predetermined,\u201d said Carter Copeland, president at Melius Research LLC, a research company.\n\nWrite to Nina Trentmann at Nina.Trentmann@wsj.com", "description": "United Technologies hired an acting finance chief ahead of its planned $135 billion merger with Raytheon, an appointment that could be an audition for an executive role at the combined company.", "authors": ["Nina Trentmann", "Nina.Trentmann Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-119567/social", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
