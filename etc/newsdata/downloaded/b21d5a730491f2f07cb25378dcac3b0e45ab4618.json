Jim Jordan (Ohio), who is the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee. The panel\u2019s chairman, former congressman Trey Gowdy (S.C.), will serve as an outside lawyer for Trump.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe notion that you can withhold information and documents from Congress no matter whether you are the party in power or not in power is wrong,\u201d Gowdy said in 2012, as a House panel moved to hold then-attorney general Eric Holder in contempt for failing to cooperate with its probe of a botched gunrunning operation. \u201cRespect for the rule of law must mean something, irrespective of the vicissitudes of political cycles.\u201d\n\nGowdy did not respond to requests for comment but criticized the House investigation last week in Fox News Channel appearances \u2014 calling its leader, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), \u201cdeeply partisan\u201d and accusing him of leaking information \u201clike a sieve.\u201d\n\nIn a 2016 addendum to the House Benghazi probe\u2019s findings, Pompeo and Jordan thrashed Democrats, saying they \u201cshowed little interest in seeking the truth\u201d and \u201cspent the bulk of their time trying to discredit the Republican-led committee and leveling baseless personal attacks.\u201d But in past weeks, the two have used similar tactics to undermine the House impeachment probe by, in Pompeo\u2019s case, accusing Democrats of \u201cbullying and intimidating State Department employees\u201d in justifying a decision to block testimony and, in Jordan\u2019s case, accusing the probe\u2019s leader of misconduct and disqualifying political bias.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere is obviously a massive hypocrisy here,\u201d said Jen Psaki, an Obama administration veteran who served as State Department spokeswoman during the Benghazi probe.\n\nPompeo, she added, \u201cwas one of the ringleaders of a massive political circus around Benghazi; he was responsible for dragging countless Foreign Service officers, civil servants \u2014 people who had been serving Democrats and Republicans for decades \u2014 in front of Congress, through the mud. Now he\u2019s claiming that he\u2019s defending the institution? That irony is not lost.\u201d\n\nThe State Department had no immediate comment.\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 fealty to Trump just a few years after their steadfast defense of congressional oversight has cast a spotlight on their words and actions in the Benghazi probe as well as GOP investigations into the Justice Department and Internal Revenue Service.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThose probes uncovered serious lapses inside the government that led to grave and sometimes deadly consequences, but they did not reveal misconduct at the highest levels of the Obama administration, as many Republicans had suggested they would. And while Republicans tussled with the White House for months over access to evidence, they ultimately obtained tens of thousands of pages of documents and dozens of witnesses for each probe.\n\nThe Benghazi probe culminated in an 11-hour October 2015 hearing featuring former secretary of state and presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, a made-for-TV spectacle that failed to elicit significant new information about the attacks that killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens.\n\nThe Trump administration has thus far refused to cooperate in any way with the impeachment investigation after months of stonewalling other probes launched by House Democrats.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nExperts are warning of a potential breakdown of the constitutional checks and balances on the presidency if the bipartisan consensus on executive oversight is eroded.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always had a system of government in which there were houses of Congress and committees of Congress where the majority and minority simultaneously looked after their own interests yet cooperated with each other,\u201d said Charles Tiefer, a University of Baltimore law professor who served as Democratic counsel on several high-profile congressional investigations. \u201cIf we have a situation where the president can command noncooperation, he will effectively shut down the system of checks and balances.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWe could have presidential abuses in the future that would make what [Richard] Nixon did look like finger-painting in a nursery school.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nDemocrats viewed the appointment of a special Benghazi committee in 2014 as a political witch hunt aimed at damaging Clinton, and they debated whether to even participate after five other House committees had already reviewed the episode. Those suspicions were borne out the next year when then-House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) credited the panel with lowering Clinton\u2019s approval ratings.\n\nOne Republican who served on the Benghazi panel, retired congressman Lynn A. Westmoreland of Georgia, argued that the situations are \u201cdifferent\u201d because the panel was investigating an event rather than a person. And despite the ultimate scale of cooperation \u2014 running to 107 witnesses and more than 100,000 pages of documents by the panel\u2019s own statistics \u2014 Westmoreland maintained that \u201cObama stonewalled\u201d the Benghazi investigation.\n\n\u201cWe were just trying to investigate what happened,\u201d he said. \u201cThere wouldn\u2019t have been any criminal charges. I don\u2019t think there would have been any consequence to anybody for any of their testimony.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWestmoreland also argued \u2014 as have Gowdy, Jordan and Pompeo, as well as the Trump administration \u2014 that Democrats are upending precedent and sidelining Republicans by moving for a lightning-fast impeachment: \u201cI just have a problem with the fact that it just doesn\u2019t seem like they\u2019re following the process. And when you have a bad process, you have a flawed product.\u201d\n\nJordan was not available for an interview but told reporters Monday that he agreed with the Trump administration\u2019s decision, later detailed in a letter, not to cooperate because of the \u201cillegitimate\u201d nature of the impeachment probe.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s going to be this kind of process . . . we understand why they made this decision at this moment,\u201d Jordan told reporters Monday after a State Department official, Gordon Sondland, failed to appear for a House deposition.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut it remains unclear if the White House would cooperate with the impeachment investigation even if the House took a formal vote authorizing one, as Republicans are demanding, and there are a wealth of instances where Trump\u2019s defenders lambasted the White House for refusing to comply with Congress.\n\n\u201cThe only route to the truth is through the House of Representatives,\u201d Jordan said in 2014, as the House voted to hold IRS official Lois Lerner in contempt of Congress for declining to answer lawmakers\u2019 questions about allegations of political bias in the handling of tax exemptions for nonprofit groups.\n\nAnother Republican close with the Benghazi investigation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly called the turnabout \u201cjust part of the irony of the inevitable twists and turns of Washington, in that different people are playing different hands and different roles.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe investigator compared the situation to the about-face former congressman Mick Mulvaney (S.C.) did when he joined the Trump administration as budget director: Famous for his refusal to raise the debt ceiling when he was in Congress, Mulvaney asked his former GOP colleagues to do just that after assuming his new role in 2017.\n\nKurt Bardella, a former spokesman and senior adviser for Republicans on the House Oversight Committee who is now an outspoken critic of Trump and his GOP supporters, called the oversight turnabout \u201ca complete betrayal of everything that they claimed to stand for during the Obama years,\u201d and said Democrats should stand ready to confront Trump\u2019s congressional allies with their own words.", "description": "Several Republicans \u2014 Gowdy, Pompeo and Jordan \u2014 have joined President Trump in endorsing resistance to the House impeachment probe.", "authors": ["Mike Debonis", "Congressional Reporter Covering The House Of Representatives", "Rachael Bade", "Congressional Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HDlqvA3AU1JvbEDySf8ERJAZCuU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ABV7ZCXKZUI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
