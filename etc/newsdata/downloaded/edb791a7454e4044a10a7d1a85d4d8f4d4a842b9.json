However, there are no employment guarantees.\n\nSantander's coding scholarship program follows the bank's announcement of a large recruitment exercise earlier in 2019 to significantly boost its own IT workforce in Brazil with Java developers, Android and iOS developers, artificial intelligence engineers, data engineers and other functions.\n\nThe plan is part of a $2 billion investment plan to drive digital transformation across the Spanish bank's operations globally. Brazil represents 30 percent of that budget, according to the company.\n\nA survey suggested that most in-demand skills in Brazil are digital marketing analyst, data scientist, customer experience specialist as well as UX/UI designer and data analyst. In addition to technical competencies, firms also want people to be \"innovative, easily adaptable and focused on continued learning.\"\n\nHowever, only 29 percent of these companies offer digital training, be it in terms of internal training or incentives for employees to seek training elsewhere.", "description": "The bank is accelerating its plan to boost its tech workforce and address the local skills gap", "authors": ["Angelica Mari"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/18/c1718541-a615-4881-a0f3-722eea7f0bd7/thumbnail/770x578/422a0004c9681df719a2e8509fd00a0e/skills.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
