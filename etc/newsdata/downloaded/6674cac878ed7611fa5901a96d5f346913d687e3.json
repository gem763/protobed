It is one of the company\u2019s main mines in Siberia and contains mixed ores.\n\nAt 1630 local time three workers were found dead at a depth of 1,345 metres (0.8 miles), Nornickel said, adding that there had not been a fire, or a rockslide.\n\nNornickel, part-owned by Russian businessman Vladimir Potanin and aluminium giant Rusal, is also a major producer of platinum and copper.\n\nShares in Nornickel fell quickly in Moscow when the company reported the accident but recovered after it clarified that the mine was unaffected. The shares were up 0.6% as of 1413 GMT.\n\nThe deaths could have been caused by methane gas poisoning, TASS news agency reported, citing an unnamed source.\n\n\u201cThree people died, no one is injured,\u201d TASS quoted the deputy prime minister of the Krasnoaysk region, Anatoly Tsykalov, as saying. \u201cThe reasons for the situation are being investigated. There were no technological violations at the mine.\u201d\n\nAccording to Tsykalov, two miners were initially missed at the mine, with a third disappearing after going in search of them.\n\nAll three were found dead with unopened self-protective breathing equipment, which is supposed to be used in case of emergency, on them, he added.\n\n\u201cNornickel is conducting an internal investigation into the incident and will provide new information as it becomes available,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nThe mine, launched in 1982, is one of the deepest in Europe. In 2015 Nornickel said the Taimyr facility produced 35% of the company\u2019s total nickel output, 21% of its copper, 38% of its cobalt and 15% of its platinum group metals.", "description": "Three people were killed on Tuesday in an accident at Norilsk Nickel's Taimyr underground mine in Siberia, the Russian mining giant said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
