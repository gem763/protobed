Although he has increasingly clashed with opinion hosts in their at-times sycophantic rationalizations of President Trump\u2019s conduct, he did not indicate Friday that the friction contributed to his decision.\n\nIn a statement announcing Smith\u2019s departure, President and Executive Editor of Fox News Media Jay Wallace called the anchor \u201cone of the premier newscasters of his generation.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis integrity and outstanding reporting put Fox News on the map and there is simply no better breaking news anchor who has the ability to transport a viewer to a place of conflict, tragedy, despair, or elation through his masterful delivery,\u201d Wallace added.\n\nSmith started with Fox News the year it launched, in 1996, and his star rose after he tore into the Bush administration\u2019s response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005. He earned the respect of staunchly conservative Fox News boss Roger Ailes for his reporting. And he continued broadcasting as an openly gay man despite the network\u2019s conservative lean.\n\nThe anchor\u2019s announcement appears to have caught some of his colleagues at Fox News off guard. On his own program on Friday afternoon, Fox News host Neil Cavuto was visibly shaken, telling viewers, \u201cI\u2019m a little stunned and a little heartbroken.\u201d\n\n\u201cA better newsman you probably cannot find,\u201d Cavuto added. \u201cShepard, I don\u2019t know what the heck you\u2019re planning to do, or where you go, but I just know you\u2019ll be great at doing it. And you deserve the best that life has to offer. So I\u2019m sorry if I\u201dm a little shell-shocked here, but I\u2019m going to miss my buddy.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhen Cavuto threw his show to a segment about trade with Fox News Chief White House Correspondent John Roberts, Roberts also seemed floored by the news.\n\n\u201cNeil, I walked out to do the hit and suddenly got hit by a subway train,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cHoly mackerel!\u201d\n\nHere's his final sign-off:\n\n\n\nCover: In this Wednesday, Sept. 5, 2018 photo, Shepard Smith talks to his crew before a taping of the Shepard Smith Reporting program on the Fox News Channel in New York.
