In fact, it\u2019s something millions of us say when tragedy strikes.\n\nSome would criticize people of faith when we offer our thoughts and especially our prayers at times like these. They instead say we should do something \u2013 as if praying was useless and just a waste of time.\n\nHURRICANE DORIAN'S DEVASTATION IN THE BAHAMAS REVEALED\n\nCertainly, our response to tragedies can\u2019t be limited to only thoughts and prayers and nothing else. But those of us who pray know that prayer is important, in addition to taking other actions. I know this personally from my own very sad experience.\n\nOur son Christopher was killed in a tragic automobile accident 11 years ago. My world as I knew it seemed to end. But suddenly, I was surrounded by people praying for me and for my wife Cathe.\n\nWe were made aware of thousands of prayers directed toward heaven on behalf of our family, many of them posted on social media. And so many kindhearted people helped us and our son\u2019s widow, Brittany, in other ways as well.\n\nNo, it did not take the terrible pain of losing our son for us to realize the power of prayer, but it buoyed us above the raging waters of grief and helped us to make it through another day.\n\nPeople who sneer at the idea of praying do not understand the power of prayer and more importantly the power of the one we are praying to \u2013 God Himself. But the fact is, as important as it is, we don\u2019t just pray. We are always \u201cdoing something\u201d in addition to praying.\n\nI have found that people of faith are at the forefront of doing many things in addition to praying whenever a crisis hits. You will often see church vans filled with supplies like food and drinking water arriving on the scene of a hurricane or tornado before help from the government has arrived. People of faith donate their time and money generously to those in need.\n\nOur son Christopher was killed in a tragic automobile accident 11 years ago. My world as I knew it seemed to end. But suddenly, I was surrounded by people praying for me and for my wife Cathe.\n\nYou see organizations founded or led by people who believe in prayer, such as the two my friend Franklin Graham leads. These are Samaritan\u2019s Purse and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Organization, providing whatever relief is necessary \u2013 including food, rebuilding homes. and sending in chaplains to provide counseling and assurance in places where tragedy has hit.\n\nThis life is hard. And bad things happen to good people. We know this well. And we know there is an afterlife and that dramatically affects what we do in this life.\n\nAs C.S. Lewis once said: \u201cIf you read history you will find that the Christians who did most for the present world were precisely those who thought most of the next.\u201d\n\nSo, \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d have their place \u2013 now and for all time.\n\nNow, if we flippantly say we will pray and not do so, that is of no value. But if we really pray it can change circumstances, and it can change us.\n\nIn the Bible, the Prophet Daniel prayed and he was freed from a den of lions. In the gospels, a man with a sick child called out to Jesus, and his little one was healed.\n\nPrayer matters and prayers change things.\n\nWhat is prayer?\n\nPrayer is talking to God. For Christians, this is a privilege given to us through our relationship with the Father through his son Jesus. People of other faiths pray in different ways. And God loves to hear our prayers.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe Lord Himself says: \u201cCall to Me and I will answer you, and I will tell you great and mighty things, which you do not know.\u201d (Jeremiah 33:3 NASB)\n\nSo, yes, offer your thoughts but more importantly your prayers for those who are hurting today. And if you are having a relatively problem-free day remember to shoot up a prayer of thanks to God.\n\nIt\u2019s important that we remember that our lives are a gift from God. Everything we have comes from Him as well.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Bible says: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done. Then you will experience God\u2019s peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus.\u201d (Philippians 4:6)\n\nWe live in such a scary time, with so many things that frighten us and give us deep anxiety.\n\nBut God can give us that supernatural peace and strength to go on another day.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY GREG LAURIE", "description": "Prayer is an important response to tragedy, in addition to action people of faith take to help those in need.", "authors": ["Greg Laurie", "Greg Laurie Is An Author", "Evangelist", "Pastor", "Founder Of The Harvest Churches In California", "Hawaii", "Harvest Crusades.
