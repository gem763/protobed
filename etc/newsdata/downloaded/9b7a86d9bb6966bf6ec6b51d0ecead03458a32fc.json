REUTERS/Ints Kalnins\n\nANKARA (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s announcement of his intention to annex areas of the West Bank following next week\u2019s elections shows Israel is becoming a \u201cracist, apartheid regime\u201d, Turkey\u2019s foreign minister was quoted as saying on Sunday.\n\nNetanyahu said on Tuesday he would annex the Jordan Valley, a swathe of the occupied West Bank that Israel captured in 1967 and which Palestinians want as part of a future state. The move alarmed Middle Eastern nations, European powers and Arab foreign ministers.\n\nOn Saturday, Turkey\u2019s foreign ministry said the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) would convene in Jeddah on Sunday to discuss Netanyahu\u2019s statement.\n\nSpeaking in Jeddah, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Netanyahu\u2019s \u201cembarrassing\u201d plan was a \u201cdespicable\u201d attempt to earn votes ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election, and criticized what he called a lack of reaction from other Muslim countries.\n\n\u201cIsrael, encouraged by the support of certain countries, is continuing its aggressive policies that are turning it into a racist, apartheid regime,\u201d Cavusoglu was quoted as saying by the state-run Anadolu news agency.\n\n\u201cIf the whole Muslim community had reacted together, the reckless plans, policies and behavior of the United States and Israel would never have reached this point,\u201d Cavusoglu said.\n\nAround 65,000 Palestinians and 11,000 Israeli settlers live in the Jordan Valley and northern Dead Sea area, the Israeli human rights group B\u2019Tselem says. The main Palestinian city is Jericho, with some 28 villages and smaller Bedouin communities.\n\nTurkey and Israel, former allies, have long been at odds over Israel\u2019s policy toward the Palestinians and Jerusalem\u2019s status. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan called for a summit of the OIC twice last year after U.S. President Donald Trump decided to recognize Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital.\n\nTurkey and Israel also expelled each other\u2019s top diplomats last year during a dispute over clashes when dozens of Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces on the Gaza border. The two sides continue to trade with one another.", "description": "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of his intention to annex areas of the West Bank following next week's elections shows Israel is becoming a \"racist, apartheid regime\", Turkey's foreign minister was quoted as saying on Sunday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190915&t=2&i=1430104034&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8E0C3", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
