I was the first to write about them in a national paper, and gave them most of their early publicity.\n\nI became quite close to their manager Brian Epstein. At one time, he had three of his groups in the Top 10, The Beatles, Billy J. Kramer and The Dakotas, and Gerry and the Pacemakers.\n\nI asked him to get them all together for me for one big picture. It became quite a classic photograph, which was later flogged around the world.\n\nIt was the very first picture of the three top groups together.\n\n(Image: Daily Mirror)\n\nBacon, eggs and cocaine\n\nLulu, the little girl from Glasgow with the big voice, was always great fun to be with.\n\nOne time, she invited me over to do an interview, she suddenly said: \u201cKen, you don\u2019t half remind me of my Maurice. You could almost be his double.\u201d\n\nMaurice was her first husband, one of the Bee Gees\u2019 Gibb brothers. I had a beard, and long hair. And I did have a toothy grin, just like Maurice.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nI remember Lulu talking about the days when the Bee Gees used to hang out with the Beatles and other rock stars. Lulu never took drugs, she said, but told me that when they had overnight parties, she was the one who would be making breakfast for hungover guests.\n\n\u201cAnd with some of them, they were taking cocaine together with their egg and bacon,\u201d she said.\n\nMartha's tears over Coronation Street axe\n\n(Image: ITV/Rex Features)\n\nLynne Carol spent nearly four years on the Street as busybody Martha Longhurst, who sat with Ena Sharples and Minnie Caldwell in the Rovers\u2019 snug gossiping.\n\nWhen they killed Martha off in 1964, Violet Carson, who played Ena, was so upset she marched upstairs and told Granada boss Sidney Bernstein they\u2019d regret it.\n\nThey got rid of Martha anyway. She had a heart attack over her glass of stout in the Rovers, her spectacles falling on to the table.\n\nThe night she was due to die on screen, Lynne was determined to watch. I suggested we could watch the last episode together.\n\nAt first, she thought it was a good idea, but changed her mind and told me: \u201cNo, I think I am going to be too upset.\u201d\n\nShe would watch it at home In Blackpool with husband Bert Palmer, also an actor, she said.\n\nI phoned her afterwards. Bert answered and said: \u201cShe\u2019s really very upset.\u201d Lynne was close to tears. Later, she admitted: \u201cI cried when I watched my own funeral.\u201d\n\nWhy Kojak gave me his lollipops\n\n(Image: rex)\n\nTelly Savalas, the tough-guy actor who played TV detective Kojak, was larger than life.\n\nI once had to interview him at London\u2019s Savoy Hotel, and we had a few drinks together. I found him to be a really intelligent and articulate man.\n\nBut he said: \u201cWherever I go, people seem afraid of me. I\u2019m really a big pussycat.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the interview, he reached over to a box and produced half a dozen lollipops. He said: \u201cHere, take some of these. I hate the damn things. But because Kojak is always sucking a lollipop, the TV people give me these by the bagful and insist I should always suck them in public.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I hate the taste of them.\u201d\n\nSo I went back to the office with a pocket full of Kojak lollipops and gave them to colleagues.\n\nBernard Manning in his underwear\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nI was invited to the comedian\u2019s home quite a few times.\n\nThere he\u2019d be, sitting quite unashamedly on the sofa in vest and underpants, gazing at a giant fish tank the length of one wall.\n\nOr else he was watching horse racing. Gambling was his only real hobby. He would think nothing of betting \u00a35,000 on a horse.\n\nBut he once told me: \u201cI never gamble more than I can afford. I\u2019ll never lose more than I can earn working the next week.\u201d\n\nGentleman Terry does me a favour\n\nWhen it comes to nice guys in showbusiness, they didn\u2019t come any nicer than Terry Wogan.\n\nI knew him from the day he joined that motley crew of DJs launching Radio 1.\n\nTerry once did me a very special favour which involved my lovely young sister Joan, who lived in Upton, Wirral, but was staying with us in London on a training course.\n\nI agreed to drive her every morning to her work and knew she\u2019d listened to the Wogan show for years, so I dropped Terry a line.\n\nI was driving Joan in the car, when Terry announced: \u201cThis is a special greeting for Mrs Joan Jones. I understand you are probably on your way to Kenton right now. Probably stuck in traffic. Here\u2019s a song especially for you.\u201d\n\nJoan\u2019s face was a mix of surprise and horror. Then she thumped my arm and said: \u201cThis is you isn\u2019t it?\u2019\u201d Sadly, our Joan died a few years later, a brain haemorrhage brought her life to a tragic end.\n\nTippi's Hollywood Wild Life\n\nOne of the most amazing interviews I\u2019ve ever done was with Hollywood actress Tippi Hedren, the star of the classic Alfred Hitchcock horror film The Birds.\n\nIn 1982 , Tippi welcomed us into her house in LA, and said: \u201cThere are some animals around.\"\n\n(Image: Rex)\n\nI was sitting in the lounge interviewing Tippi, when suddenly there was this terrific roar, and a giant, fully grown Siberian Tiger leapt through the kitchen window and ran into the room. To my horror, it jumped over my head and leapt on top of Tippi. She then started stroking and playing with it.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he won\u2019t harm you,\u201d she said.\n\nThe tiger then jumped up at my photographer Eddie Sanderson. I could see he was terrified.\n\nWe went outside and Tippi introduced me to various lions, tigers and leopards. She then invited me to sit down with her in the grass while this massive tigress came over and jumped on top of me. Tippi lay there alongside me and encouraged the animal to play with us. I was petrified.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: 'I partied with Lulu, met the Birds star's pet tiger and got Wogan to surprise my sister' - Ex-Mirror showbiz writer Ken Irwin's amazing life", "authors": ["Ken Irwin", "Image", "Mirrorpix", "Daily Mirror", "Getty", "Itv Rex Features", "Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20681526.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_20-BOTTOM-STRIP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
