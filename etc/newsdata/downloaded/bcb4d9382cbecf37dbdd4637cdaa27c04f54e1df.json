Say \u2018woo-hoo!\u2019 (quietly, if you need to, depending on where you\u2019re reading this),\u201d Warren campaign manager Roger Lau wrote in an email to supporters Friday sharing the fundraising numbers. \u201cClose your eyes and picture Wall Street bankers scowling into their catered breakfast.\"\n\nWarren\u2019s strong fundraising comes as she has risen to the top of many national early-state and national polls after a slow start, topping both Biden and Sanders in some recent surveys. The Warren campaign also recently announced a $10 million-plus TV and digital ad buy in the coming months in the four early primary and caucus states.\n\nLau wrote that Warren added over 300,000 new donors in the third quarter, bringing her total to about 750,000 donors over the course of the campaign. Sanders' campaign said in September that it had accrued more than 1 million donors.\n\nWarren and Sanders out-fundraising rivals \u2014 without holding traditional fundraisers \u2014 has disrupted the traditional presidential campaign model heading into 2020 and defied expectations of many political strategists.
