Sometimes you can get a great player who's in a slump for a real bargain. Stocks can be that way, too, according to Jim Cramer.\n\nOn Cramer's hot list from his \" Mad Money \" program is cloud analytics provider Splunk Inc. ( SPLK ) , which trades for far less than its worth. We looked at SPLK two weeks ago and concluded that, \"SPLK is in a position to test and probably break the early June low. A break of this low is likely to precipitate further declines and a test of the December low around $90. Get defensive.\"\n\nLet's drop in on the charts again.\n\nIn this updated daily bar chart of SPLK, below, we can see that prices have been testing the early June lows. The slope of the 50-day moving average line is bearish now but the slower-to-react 200-day average line is still rising. The On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line is still pointed down from late February suggesting a weakening trend. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator crossed to the upside from below the zero line for a cover shorts buy signal - a buy signal when the stock is still in a downtrend.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of SPLK, below, we can see a bearish set-up. Prices are below the cresting 40-week moving average line. The weekly OBV line is pointed down and the MACD oscillator is close to crossing below the zero-line for an outright sell signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of SPLK, below, we can see a potential upside price target of $134 projected. A trade at $106.54 will be a new low for the move down and probably weaken this chart.\n\nBottom line strategy: Two of our three charts on SPLK are weak, so even though prices have improved a little in recent days, the risk still exists for a deeper decline. Remain defensive for now.", "description": "Even though prices have improved a little in recent days, risk still exists for a deeper decline for Splunk...SPLK", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Splunk Is No Slam Dunk For Investors", "Even Though Prices Have Improved A Little In Recent Days", "Risk Still Exists For A Deeper Decline For Splk.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Timothy Collins", "Stephen Guilfoyle", "Guy Ortmann"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/dcb7f92f-0397-11e9-86d7-0f3a395c3013.jpg"}
