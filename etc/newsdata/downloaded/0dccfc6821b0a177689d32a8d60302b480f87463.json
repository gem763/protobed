If you type the numbers \"11 146 15 62 google maps\" in Google and click the first link, you get a street view of a crab rave.

Elon Musk has not bought Fortnite (we have no idea where that rumour came from).\n\nThe https://t.co/0TDeMk7Bda code was updated so the the-end thing has its end_time as Thursday at 4am EST i really doubt they really going to make people not play for 4 days or whatever straight but its epic lmao take it as you will pic.twitter.com/P6gYB7lWHw \u2014 Lucas7yoshi \u2013 FNBR Leaks/News (@Lucas7yoshi) October 14, 2019\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Fortnite down as 4.2 million watch The End and wait for Fortnite 2\n\nMORE: Fortnite Chapter 2 leaked with brand new map and\u2026 boats!\n\nMORE: Fortnite season 11 start date delayed, as Fortnite sales drop 52% in a year", "description": "It might be longer than you think before you can play Fortnite again, as fan theories and datamining suggest the outage could last for days.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screenshot_5-d91d_1571042625.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
