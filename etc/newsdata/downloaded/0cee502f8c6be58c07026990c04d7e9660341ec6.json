The recommendations have not been finalised.\u201d\n\nHowever, The Daily Telegraph today published 40 draft recommendations, which had already been sent to NSW government departments and police.\n\nBoth authorities, as well as anti-drug groups, have taken issue with some of the recommendations.\n\nAs well as scrapping drug dogs, the leaked draft recommendations called for allowing pill testing at festivals and asked the Government to consider decriminalising personal use of drugs \u201cas a mechanism to reduce the harm caused by drug use\u201d.\n\nIt also recommends it consider \u201credefining illicit drugs as primarily health and social issue rather than primarily a law enforcement issue\u201d.\n\nIn a statement this afternoon, Drug Free Australia spokesman Gary Christian said the group \u201ccondemned the recommendations as misguided\u201d.\n\nThe coroner observed a pill-testing demonstration at Splendour in the Grass music festival in Byron Bay in July and was accompanied by Jennie Ross-King.\n\nHer daughter, Alex Ross-King, 19, died after ingesting multiple MDMA pills ahead of the FOMO festival earlier this year that the inquest heard was \u201cto avoid the risk of detection\u201d.\n\nMs Ross-King told The Sydney Morning Heraldshe thought the draft recommendations were \u201cgreat\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very comprehensive and common sense,\u201d she said today.\n\n\u201cFrom everything we heard, it\u2019s based on the facts, the evidence, the information that was brought to the coroner. I think we have been listened to with our concerns.\u201d\n\nHer daughter\u2019s death was one of six being considered by the inquest, along with Diana Nguyen, Joseph Pham, Callum Brosnan, Joshua Tam and Nathan Tran who were all aged between 18 and 23 and also died after ingesting illicit drugs at NSW music festivals.\n\nNSW frontbencher Andrew Constance maintains pill testing is not the solution to the spate of deaths and said nothing could guarantee the safety of illicit drugs.\n\n\u201cIf the pure form of the drug is tested and found not to be laced and people still take it, they can still lose their life,\u201d he told reporters in Sydney today.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing is young people at these festivals \u2026 dehydrated, overdosing, and they\u2019re losing their lives. So I don\u2019t see pill testing as the answer.\u201d\n\nNSW frontbencher Sarah Mitchell suggested pill testing could create additional safety problems.\n\n\u201cPill testing might lead people to have a false sense of security when it comes to using drugs and it\u2019s risky,\u201d Ms Mitchell told reporters.\n\nRELATED: Young man\u2019s final moments after festival drug overdose\n\nNSW Greens MP Cate Faehrmann, in a statement, said the recommendations \u201cappear to confirm that the Government\u2019s zero tolerance approach is doing nothing to save lives\u201d.\n\n\u201cNo government in the world has been able to stop people taking drugs,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMore and more countries are recognising that the war on drugs has been a colossal failure and are adopting harm-reduction measures and saving lives.\u201d\n\nOn Channel 9\u2019s Today show this morning, federal Labor MP Tanya Plibersek said she believed \u201cwe have to proceed very cautiously\u201d with these debates and should listen to experts.\n\n\u201cTo the doctors, and to emergency services personnel, to police and of course to parents,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere are sadly too many parents who have lost their children in this way. We need to hear their voices in this debate as well.\u201d\n\nMs Plibersek said it was correct that \u201cyou can\u2019t safely take drugs\u201d and she supported the efforts of police to disrupt criminal trade in drugs.\n\n\u201cSomething that\u2019s made in a bikie\u2019s bathroom isn\u2019t likely to be good for you,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut I think we have to take a sensible look at the coroner\u2019s recommendations because as well as policing, (we) need to look at health interventions that keep people alive.\u201d\n\nFellow guest, Nationals deputy leader Bridget McKenzie acknowledged it was a tragedy when any young person died, especially while they were on a day out or enjoying music with mates.\n\n\u201cThere is a reason drugs are illegal, it is because they do you great harm,\u201d she said on Today.\n\n\u201cObviously, this is a matter for the coroner and the NSW Government, but we can\u2019t \u2014 my personal belief is \u2014 we can\u2019t have places in our community where the law doesn\u2019t apply.\n\n\u201cAnd making sure that young people, in particular, can\u2019t be taking drugs and therefore having those devastating effects and losing their life needs to be something we need to ensure can\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nSenator McKenzie said the NSW Government, as it considers the coroner\u2019s draft recommendations and findings, needed to make the decision \u201cin the best interests of the community\u201d going forward.\n\nKevin Morton, acting president of the Police Association of New South Wales (PANSW), told news.com.au his organisation was reserving any substantive comments until the findings were public.\n\nBut he said the association\u2019s primary concern throughout the inquest had been \u201cthat our members \u2014 who are simply enforcing the law and responsibly conducting reasonable policing duties at festivals \u2014 should not be caught up in a form of baseless and biased blame game\u201d.\n\nHe said PANSW would be \u201cextremely concerned\u201d if officers \u201cmaintaining and ensuring public safety\u201d were criticised any further for duties such as conducting strip-searches at festivals.\n\nWith AAP", "description": "Anti-drug campaigners and politicians have rejected leaked recommendations from a NSW coroner\u2019s report suggesting scrapping drug detection dogs after finding a link between their presence and \u201charmful\u201d drug use.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/3403996c72da7414e9c3f261d1d59eee?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
