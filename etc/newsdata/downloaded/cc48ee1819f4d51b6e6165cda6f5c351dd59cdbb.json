Brian Kemp, makes exceptions in the case of rape and incest, as long as the pregnant person files a police report first. It also allows for abortions when the life of the pregnant person is at risk or when a fetus is determined not to be viable because of a serious medical condition.\n\nAdditionally, it declares that an embryo or fetus is a \u201cnatural person\u201d once cardiac activity can be detected, saying that is the point where \u201cthe full value of a child begins.\u201d That would make the fetus a dependent minor for tax purposes and trigger child support obligations.\n\nTalcott Camp, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, argued that the Supreme Court has held that states must respect a woman\u2019s right to choose to have an abortion at any point before viability and that Georgia\u2019s law violates that by banning many pre-viability abortions.\n\nViability is defined as the point when the fetus can live outside the womb without artificial support, generally from 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy.\n\n\u201cThe main purpose of this law is to ban abortion,\u201d Mr. Camp said.\n\nThe Georgia ban is set to take effect Jan. 1.\n\nIn Nashville, Tennessee, a federal trial began Monday over the state\u2019s mandatory 48-hour waiting period before a woman can receive an abortion, a law enacted in 2015.\n\nAlex Rieger, representing the state attorney general\u2019s office, said in opening statements that Tennessee\u2019s law \u201coffers women a chance to make a different choice\u201d and is similar to laws in other states that have been upheld by the courts.\n\nDr. Sarah Wallet, the former medical director of Planned Parenthood of Tennessee and North Mississippi, testified that the mandatory waiting period actually delays the abortion by up to a month.\n\nTennessee is 1 of 27 states that require some sort of mandatory waiting period, ranging from 18 to 72 hours.\n\nAttorneys for five of the seven abortion clinics in Tennessee must prove that the mandatory waiting period imposes \u201can undue burden\u201d on those who are seeking an abortion, the standard established with the 1992 Supreme Court decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\n\n\u201cSince Tennessee\u2019s law was enacted, more than 2,000 women have declined to obtain abortions after completing their initial informed consent visits,\u201d attorneys for the clinics argue in court filings.\n\nAttorneys for Tennessee argued in court filings that the law \u201chelps to ensure that abortion decisions are made knowingly, competently, and voluntarily.\u201d\n\nThe court challenges are emerging against the backdrop of a Supreme Court with a conservative majority, with both sides anticipating it would overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion.\n\n\u2022 This article is based in part on wire service reports.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
