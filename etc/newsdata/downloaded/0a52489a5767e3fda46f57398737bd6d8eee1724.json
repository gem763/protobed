Well, anything new? Actually, of course, just about everything is new since last we gathered. For one thing, impeachment is happening, which seems worthy of notice. As I pointed out in today's column, the most damaging witness against President Trump, by far, is President Trump himself. To many eyes, including mine -- and, apparently, those of a majority of the House of Representatives -- the rough transcript of his July 25 phone call with the president of Ukraine clearly records the commission of an impeachable offense. The president and his defenders are combining attacks on the whistleblower with nothing-to-see-here bluster, but they can't get past that transcript. \"I would like you to do us a favor though.\" Stonewalling the House on witnesses and documents doesn't erase that pesky sentence, doesn't change its clear meaning. Trump still seems to think there's some way he can tweet and threaten his way out of this, but he's wrong. This is real.
