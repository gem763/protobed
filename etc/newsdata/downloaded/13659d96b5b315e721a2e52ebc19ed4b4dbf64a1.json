Hurricane Dorian has stalled as it continues to pummel the northwestern Bahamas, but it will track dangerously close to a large portion of the East Coast from Florida to Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and southeastern Virginia this week. Hurricane watches have been extended northward to include the entire Georgia coastline and South Carolina's Lowcountry.\n\nOuter rainbands have already moved ashore in South Florida, where winds over 40 mph have been clocked in a few locations near the coast, including at Opa Locka Airport near Miami.\n\nDorian's intensity has backed off a bit from Sunday's peak and is now a strong Category 4 . It will remain a formidable hurricane over the next several days.\n\n(INTERACTIVE: Current Bahamas Winds, Satellite)\n\n<img class=\"styles__noscript__2rw2y\" src=\"https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/MAX_WEB_TROP_ATL5_storm_info_1280x720.jpg\" srcset=\"https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/MAX_WEB_TROP_ATL5_storm_info_1280x720.jpg 400w, https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/MAX_WEB_TROP_ATL5_storm_info_1280x720.jpg 800w\" > Current Storm Status (The highest cloud tops, corresponding to the most vigorous convection, are shown in the brightest red colors. Clustering, deep convection around the center is a sign of a healthy tropical cyclone.)\n\nDorian's forward speed has slowed to a virtual stall near Grand Bahama Island.\n\nUnfortunately, that means the northwestern Bahamas \u2013 particularly Grand Bahama Island \u2013 are taking an extended pummeling from destructive winds and catastrophic storm-surge flooding.\n\n<img class=\"styles__noscript__2rw2y\" src=\"https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/DCT_SPECIAL7_1280x720.jpg\" srcset=\"https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/DCT_SPECIAL7_1280x720.jpg 400w, https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/DCT_SPECIAL7_1280x720.jpg 800w\" > Current Winds\n\nSqualls from the outer periphery of Dorian have also reached the southern Florida Peninsula. Sustained tropical-storm-force winds (39-plus mph) arrived at Juno Beach, Florida , Monday afternoon.\n\nOuter rainbands are pivoting into Florida, each with the potential to produce wind gusts up to 50 mph. These rainbands will also be capable of spawning isolated tornadoes along the east coast of Florida through Tuesday.\n\n<img class=\"styles__noscript__2rw2y\" src=\"https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/DCT_SPECIAL2_1280x720.jpg\" srcset=\"https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/DCT_SPECIAL2_1280x720.jpg 400w, https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/DCT_SPECIAL2_1280x720.jpg 800w\" > Current Radar, Watches and Warnings (Watches and warnings are issued by the National Weather Service.)\n\nWatches and Warnings\n\nA hurricane warning has been posted along the east coast of Florida from Jupiter Inlet to Ponte Vedra Beach. A storm surge warning has also been issued from Lantana, Florida, to the Altamaha Sound in Georgia. These warnings include Melbourne and Daytona Beach.\n\nA hurricane warning remains in effect for Grand Bahama and the Abacos Islands in the northwestern Bahamas, including Freeport, Grand Bahama.\n\nHurricane warnings mean that hurricane-force winds (74-plus mph) are expected somewhere within the warning area, generally within 36 hours. Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion.\n\nStorm surge warnings mean there is a danger of life-threatening inundation, from rising water moving inland from the coastline, within the warning area during the next 36 hours. If you live in an area prone to storm surge, be sure to follow the advice of local officials if evacuations are ordered.\n\nA hurricane watch has been posted along the southeastern U.S. coast from north of Deerfield Beach, Florida, to Jupiter Inlet, Florida, and from north of Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, to the South Santee River in South Carolina. A storm surge watch has also been posted from north of Deerfield Beach, Florida, to south of Lantana, Florida, and from the Altamaha Sound in Georgia to the South Santee River in South Carolina. These watches include Jacksonville, Florida; Brunswick, Georgia; Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nHurricane watches are issued when hurricane-force winds are possible within the watch area. They are posted 48 hours before the first tropical-storm-force winds (39-plus mph) are expected. A storm surge watch means that a life-threatening inundation is possible within the watch area during the next 48 hours.\n\nA tropical storm warning has been posted along the east coast of Florida from north of Deerfield Beach to Jupiter Inlet, meaning tropical-storm-force winds are expected within 36 hours. This warning includes West Palm Beach.\n\nA tropical storm watch is in effect for portions of Florida's east coast from north of Golden Beach to Deerfield Beach, as well as for Lake Okeechobee. This watch includes Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood, Florida.\n\nTropical storm watches mean winds of 39 mph or greater are possible within 48 hours.\n\n<img class=\"styles__noscript__2rw2y\" src=\"https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/MAX_WEB_TROP_ATL5_ww1_1280x720.jpg\" srcset=\"https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/MAX_WEB_TROP_ATL5_ww1_1280x720.jpg 400w, https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/MAX_WEB_TROP_ATL5_ww1_1280x720.jpg 800w\" > Watches and Warnings (A watch is issued when tropical storm or hurricane conditions are possible within 48 hours. A warning is issued when those conditions are expected within 36 hours.)\n\nBelow is the latest on Dorian's timing and what we know about potential forecast impacts right now.\n\nDorian's Forecast Timing\n\nInto Monday Night: Dorian will still be hammering the northwestern Bahamas as it crawls slowly. Bands of rain and strong winds may affect parts of Florida. Tropical-storm-force winds (39-plus mph) are expected in the tropical storm and hurricane warning areas of eastern Florida, with hurricane-force winds (74-plus mph) possible as soon as late Monday night in the hurricane warning area. How strong the winds will be depends on how close the center of Dorian is to the Florida coast, which is still uncertain at this time. Battering waves, coastal flooding and beach erosion will increase along the southeastern coast of Florida.\n\nTuesday: Dorian will still be hammering the northwestern Bahamas, but conditions should slowly improve by Tuesday night. Bands of rain and strong winds will still affect parts of Florida. Hurricane-force winds are expected in the hurricane warning area of eastern Florida. Coastal flooding and beach erosion will spread northward along the Florida coast.\n\nWednesday: Dorian is expected to move north, then northeastward near the coasts of northeastern Florida, Georgia and southern South Carolina. The exact track is very uncertain, ranging from a track far enough offshore to keep hurricane-force winds away from land to a landfall anywhere in this zone. Storm-surge flooding, damaging winds and flooding rain are all possible in these areas.\n\nThursday: Dorian is expected to pass near the coasts of northeastern South Carolina and North Carolina. The exact track is very uncertain, ranging from a track far enough offshore to keep hurricane-force winds away from land to a landfall anywhere in this zone. Storm-surge flooding, damaging winds and flooding rain are all possible in these areas. Some impacts from wind and coastal flooding could spread as far north as the Virginia Tidewater and the southern Delmarva Peninsula late Thursday.\n\nFriday-Saturday: Dorian is then expected to race off the Northeast Seaboard but could track close enough to bring rain and some wind to the Virginia Tidewater, Delmarva Peninsula, Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod before it heads toward the Canadian Maritimes by this weekend.\n\n(MORE: Potential Northeast Impacts From Dorian)\n\n<img class=\"styles__noscript__2rw2y\" src=\"https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/MAX_WEB_TROP_ATL5_swath_1280x720.jpg\" srcset=\"https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/MAX_WEB_TROP_ATL5_swath_1280x720.jpg 400w, https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/MAX_WEB_TROP_ATL5_swath_1280x720.jpg 800w\" > Projected Path (The red-shaded area denotes the potential path of the center of Dorian. It's important to note that impacts \u2013 heavy rain, high surf, coastal flooding and winds \u2013 with any tropical cyclone usually spread beyond its forecast path.)\n\nDorian's Track Uncertainty\n\nDorian's forecast track continues to be the razor's edge between more severe hurricane impacts reaching land, compared to those impacts staying barely offshore.\n\nThe reason for this is the upper-level high-pressure system that had been steering Dorian westward has fizzled, stalling Dorian temporarily in an environment without a steering wheel.\n\nOver the next day or so, a gap between upper-level highs east of Dorian and over the southern Plains of the United States should allow Dorian to turn northward. Late in the week, a southward dip in the jet stream approaching from the Great Lakes should grab Dorian and accelerate it toward the Canadian Maritimes.\n\n<img class=\"styles__noscript__2rw2y\" src=\"https://s.w-x.co/util/image/w/0831_dorian-steering.png?v=at&w=485&h=273\" srcset=\"https://s.w-x.co/util/image/w/0831_dorian-steering.png?v=at&w=485&h=273 400w, https://s.w-x.co/util/image/w/0831_dorian-steering.png?v=ap&w=980&h=551 800w\" > High pressure aloft has now fizzled north of Dorian, leading to its stall. A turn to the north is then expected as a break between high-pressure systems opens up. Where that northerly turn occurs is uncertain and critical for impacts.\n\nExactly when it makes those north and northeastward turns is critical. If those turns occur later, it's more of a landfall danger \u2013 or at least an eyewall strike \u2013 for parts of the Southeast coast. If it makes those turns sooner, the threat of a landfall is less, particularly in Florida and Georgia.\n\nThe myriad of track possibilities ranges from a Florida landfall and track northward through parts of the Florida Peninsula to a landfall somewhere in the Carolinas to a long scrape of the Southeast coast without the center ever moving ashore to a sharper northeastward turn well offshore.\n\nRegardless of its exact track, Dorian is likely to be a dangerous hurricane this week near the Southeast coast. Residents should have their hurricane plans ready to go and follow the directions of local emergency management.\n\nAs we saw with Hurricane Matthew in 2016, a hurricane doesn't have to make landfall in an area to produce significant impacts.\n\nDorian's Storm Surge, Wind and Rain Impacts\n\nBahamas\n\nOn Grand Bahama Island, a life-threatening storm surge may cause water levels to be as much as 12 to 18 feet above normal tide levels in areas of onshore winds. Near the coast, that storm surge will be accompanied by large, destructive waves.\n\nDamaging hurricane-force winds will persist into Tuesday in the northwestern Bahamas.\n\nAn additional 6 to 12 inches of rain is expected in the northwestern Bahamas, with isolated storm totals up to 30 inches, which may cause life-threatening flash flooding, the National Hurricane Center said. The central Bahamas can expect an additional 1 to 3 inches, with isolated totals up to 6 inches.\n\nSoutheastern U.S.\n\nLarger swells and increased battering waves generated by Dorian are beginning to arrive along the Southeast coast from North Carolina to eastern Florida and will persist for several days.\n\nThis will lead to increasing beach erosion and coastal flooding, particularly around times of high tides, which are generally around 10 to 11 a.m. and p.m. each day.\n\nThese impacts will occur regardless of how close Dorian's center tracks or whether it ever moves ashore in any part of Florida, Georgia or the Carolinas.\n\n(MAS: Dorian en Espa\u00f1ol)\n\nThe National Hurricane Center says water could reach the following heights above ground level if the peak surge coincides with high tide.\n\n-Lantana, Florida, to the South Santee River in South Carolina: 4 to 7 feet\n\n-North of Deerfield Beach, Florida, to Lantana, Florida: 2 to 4 feet\n\nThat said, this storm-surge forecast will likely change depending on how close Dorian tracks to Florida and other parts of the Southeast coast.\n\n(MAP: Potential Storm-Surge Inundation)\n\n<img class=\"styles__noscript__2rw2y\" src=\"https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/DCT_SPECIAL35_1280x720.jpg\" srcset=\"https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/DCT_SPECIAL35_1280x720.jpg 400w, https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/DCT_SPECIAL35_1280x720.jpg 800w\" > Storm-Surge Forecast (From the National Hurricane Center.)\n\nIt is too soon to determine storm-surge forecast heights farther up the coast. Check back with us for updates.\n\nThe worst wind impacts will occur within the hurricane's eyewall, while the highest storm surge will occur immediately to the east or north of where the center makes landfall, assuming it does at all. Again, it is not possible to determine exactly where these will occur at this time.\n\nIn Florida, tropical-storm-force winds (39-plus mph) will arrive along the coast well ahead of Dorian's closest pass, making preparations difficult.\n\nUse the times listed below as the time you need have preparations completed.\n\n<img class=\"styles__noscript__2rw2y\" src=\"https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/DCT_SPECIAL25_1280x720.jpg\" srcset=\"https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/DCT_SPECIAL25_1280x720.jpg 400w, https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/DCT_SPECIAL25_1280x720.jpg 800w\" > Chance and Likely Timing of Tropical-Storm-Force Winds (Tropical-storm-force winds are winds of at least 39 mph.)\n\nThese winds will be capable of taking down trees and power lines across the Southeast, leading to power outages that could last for several days.\n\nPower outages are most likely along the immediate coastline from Florida to North Carolina, where winds will be stronger than areas farther inland. However, outages are still possible from eastern Florida to southeastern Virginia inland from the coast.\n\n<img class=\"styles__noscript__2rw2y\" src=\"https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/DCT_SPECIAL27_1280x720.jpg\" srcset=\"https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/DCT_SPECIAL27_1280x720.jpg 400w, https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/DCT_SPECIAL27_1280x720.jpg 800w\" > Power Outage Forecast\n\nHere are the latest rainfall projections from the National Hurricane Center and NOAA's Weather Prediction Center:\n\n-Coastal South Carolina and North Carolina: 5 to 10 inches, locally up to 15 inches.\n\n-Near the coast from eastern Florida through eastern Georgia: 4 to 8 inches, locally up to 10 inches.\n\nShould the storm track farther offshore, these rain amounts will be less. And if the track is more inland, this rain footprint would also include areas farther inland.\n\n<img class=\"styles__noscript__2rw2y\" src=\"https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/DCT_SPECIAL49_1280x720.jpg\" srcset=\"https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/DCT_SPECIAL49_1280x720.jpg 400w, https://s.w-x.co/staticmaps/DCT_SPECIAL49_1280x720.jpg 800w\" > Rainfall Outlook (This should be interpreted as a broad outlook of where the heaviest rain may fall. Higher amounts may occur where bands or clusters of thunderstorms stall for over a period of a few hours.)\n\nThe entire Florida Peninsula and the Southeast coast as far north as southeastern Virginia need to be on alert this week.\n\nCheck back to weather.com for the latest on Hurricane Dorian.\n\nDorian's Historic Landfall in the Northern Bahamas\n\nDorian was upgraded to Category 5 status Sunday morning.\n\nDorian became the first hurricane of that intensity to make landfall on Grand Bahama Island, after first making a pair of landfalls in the Abacos Islands of the northwestern Bahamas earlier in the day.\n\nMaximum sustained winds topped out at 185 mph on Sunday, putting Dorian in a tie for the second-highest sustained wind speed among all Atlantic hurricanes. It also tied the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane in the Florida Keys as the strongest landfalling hurricane in the Atlantic Basin.\n\n(MORE: The Rarity of Category 5 Hurricanes)", "description": "Here's the latest forecast of Dorian's impacts along the East Coast.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.w-x.co/Dorian_5pm_0902.jpg"}
