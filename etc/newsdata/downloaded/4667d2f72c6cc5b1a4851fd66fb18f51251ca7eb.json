Dan Reehil, a Catholic priest, ordered the removal of all Harry Potter books from the parish school\u2019s library, the St. Edward community demanded an explanation. Father Reehil responded by email, noting that he had \u201cconsulted several exorcists, both in the United States and in Rome,\u201d and had been assured that the \u201ccurses and spells used in the books are actual curses and spells; which when read by a human being risk conjuring evil spirits into the presence of the person reading the text.\u201d\n\nI read all seven Harry Potter books aloud to all three of my children, one at a time, as they became old enough to understand the books\u2019 complicated plots, so I understand why Father Reehil\u2019s explanation assuaged no parental concerns. Exorcists? Real spells? No wonder the story became international news almost as soon as The Tennessean broke it. Articles about the incident have appeared in outlets as diverse as The Washington Post, CBS News, Entertainment Weekly, The Independent in Britain, and Forbes, among many others.\n\nBefore I heard this story, I would not have thought it necessary to point out that Harry Potter is a fictional character and that these books are not spellbooks. They are novels, tales J.K. Rowling made up out of her prodigious imagination.\n\nHarry Potter and his friends don\u2019t exist in real life, but they wrestle with real-life challenges: bullies, rejection, loneliness, fear, grief \u2014 and, yes, with clueless adults whose behavior is patently ludicrous. Nashville\u2019s St. Edward School might as well be Harry Potter\u2019s Hogwarts, for the story of Father Rehill sounds very much like the story of Delores Umbridge, a Ministry of Magic bureaucrat-turned-school-inquisitor.", "description": "It\u2019s Banned Books Week \u2014 more evidence that banning books is about as useless as trying to ban air.", "authors": ["Margaret Renkl"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/23/opinion/23renklWeb/23renklWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
