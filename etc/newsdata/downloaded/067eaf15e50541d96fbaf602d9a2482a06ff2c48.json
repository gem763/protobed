The size \u2013 about 500g each (17\u00beoz) \u2013 is plenty for one person, and the meat is tender and moist. They\u2019re more expensive than fully grown chickens, so I reserve them for dinner parties.\n\nStart marinating the birds on the morning of the day you're going to cook them. Because they're so small, the chickens take only about 30 minutes to cook (assuming they are 500g; adjust the time if the birds are larger). Try to buy birds that are about the same weight. You can cook them in the oven, using the grill setting (with convection, if your oven has this option), or outside on the barbecue.\n\nI learned to make nam jim jaew from a friend who was from Isaan, Thailand. The sauce is addictive, and I sometimes make a double batch so I have a supply in the fridge, ready to perk up other types of grilled meat.\n\nKhao khua is glutinous rice that's been toasted, then ground to a grainy powder. It's also called roasted (or toasted) rice powder. If you can't find it in the Thai shops, make your own.", "description": "I love the small baby chickens that producers label spring chickens, poussins or coquelettes.
