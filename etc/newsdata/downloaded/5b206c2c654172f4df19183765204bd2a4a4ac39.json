Some knocked back Venezuelan beers while chatting about news from their country. Here and there, the yellow, blue and red of the Venezuelan flag adorned the walls.\n\n\u201cVenezuelans come even from far away because they feel at home here,\u201d said Kelthvyn Mart\u00ednez, 29 years old, while preparing food for sale.\n\nMore than 320,000 Venezuelans now live in Spain, nearly double the 2015 number, part of a growing exodus as the country slides further into poverty and authoritarian rule under President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\nMore than 3.6 million people have left Venezuela since 2015, reducing its population to about 28 million. The poorest cross the border to Colombia, where their arrival is straining the economy. The wealthier make their way to the U.S., especially Miami. Others, if they have the means, fly to Spain, where they rely on cultural and linguistic ties to get a foothold in Europe.\n\nIn some instances, \u00e9migr\u00e9s such as former Caracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma use the country as a base to lobby Madrid and other European capitals to take a hard line on Mr. Maduro\u2019s regime. But most are simply trying to escape. Thousands of Venezuelans gathered in Madrid in January to recognize opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the new president.\n\nCustomers recently ate at Mr. Mart\u00ednez\u2019s El Punto Criollo cafe at the Mercado de Maravillas in Madrid.\n\nA few days later, Spain recognized Mr. Guaid\u00f3 as caretaker president until new elections are held, joining dozens of other countries.\n\nThe ties between Venezuelans and Spaniards run deep. Almost half the Venezuelans in Spain already hold a Spanish passport, according to the latest data from Spain\u2019s National Statistics Institute, often through grandparents who fled Spain during the civil war and the Franco dictatorship.\n\nMany of the rest tap into existing Venezuelan networks to negotiate their way through the Spanish bureaucracy or share tips on where to find off-the-books jobs or cheap accommodation until their work permits arrive.\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Do you think Spain is doing the right thing in embracing Venezuelan immigrants? Join the conversation below.\n\nGetting established in Spain isn\u2019t necessarily smooth or easy. The process to claim asylum or permanent right to stay can take years. But Spain\u2019s government this year began providing temporary protection and work permits to Venezuelans on humanitarian grounds as their applications percolate through the system.\n\nSome experts say Spain could gain from the influx. Its population is quickly graying, with the proportion of the population over 60 years of age projected to rise from around a quarter to 42% by 2050, according to a United Nations study.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to dispute that qualified immigrants, younger than Spaniards and with a similar culture, have a positive effect on society in the long run,\u201d said Jorge Galindo, a Spanish sociologist based in Colombia. \u201cIn this respect, Venezuelan immigration is the best you could think of.\u201d\n\nRicardo Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, a former opposition town councilor in northern Venezuela, moved to Spain after receiving death threats. He now lives there with his wife and two daughters.\n\nFelipe Costales, for instance, applied for asylum in 2016, alleging he was a victim of political persecution. After he received temporary protection from Venezuelan authorities, which entitles him to a work permit, he quickly landed a job as programmer at a company developing control systems for air navigation equipment.\n\n\u201cAs soon as I got the permit I found this job,\u201d Mr. Costales said. \u201cBefore, I felt like a nobody, like I was totally vulnerable to everything.\u201d\n\nVenezuelans also face little of the animosity directed toward migrants from, say, Africa or the Middle East.\n\n\u201cA migrant coming from a Latin American brother-country, with the same culture, same language, with the same worldview, isn\u2019t the same as an immigrant coming from an Islamic country,\u201d said Santiago Abascal, leader of Spain\u2019s far-right Vox party, at an election rally earlier this year.\n\nMore Venezuelans appear set to arrive as Mr. Maduro\u2019s government steps up political persecution and supplies of food, medicine and electricity run low. In the first half of this year, around 20,000 Venezuelans sought international protection in Spain, or the same number for the whole of last year and double the figure for 2017.\n\nLuisa Marcano, 50, recalled the food shortages and street gangs that preyed on her and her family in Ciudad Bol\u00edvar before she reached Spain. Other family members followed her.\n\nMs. Marcano\u2019s family recently played dominoes in their Madrid home.\n\nLuisa Marcano, 50, recalled the food shortages and street gangs that preyed on her and her family in Ciudad Bol\u00edvar before she reached Spain 2 1/2 years ago. \u201cWe used to line up for eight hours to buy food, sometimes even more than one day,\u201d she said while having some food with her son at Mr. Mart\u00ednez\u2019s stall at the Maravillas market.\n\nA kindergarten teacher back in Venezuela, she now washes dishes in a restaurant. Her husband is a courier, while in Venezuela he was a taxi driver.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum are wealthy Venezuelans making sizable investments in Spain, snapping up properties in prime locations such as the Salamanca neighborhood, a couple of miles from the Maravillas market.\n\nPatricio Palomar, head of alternative investments at AIRE Partners in Madrid, calculates that Venezuelan investments in real estate have totaled some \u20ac700 million ($775 million) over the past 10 years.\n\nOther Venezuelans are simply relieved to be alive.\n\nRicardo Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, who was a town councilor in northern Venezuela, left his home after a receiving a series of death threats. He said he feared for his life, but found peace in Madrid.\n\n\u201cSpain opened its doors to Venezuelans and welcomed us with open arms,\u201d he said.\n\nMadrid after sunset from El Cerro del T\u00edo P\u00edo Park, where many Venezuelans go to enjoy the views.\n\nWrite to Giovanni Legorano at giovanni.legorano@wsj.com", "description": "The number of Venezuelans in Spain has nearly doubled to 320,000 in four years, part of a growing exodus as their country slides further into poverty and authoritarian rule under President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.", "authors": ["Giovanni Legorano", "Photographs Maysun For The Wall Street Journal"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107557/social", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
