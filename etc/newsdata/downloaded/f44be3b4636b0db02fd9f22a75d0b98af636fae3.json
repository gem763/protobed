NBC News has reported that Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, \u201cbutt-dialed\u201d one of the network\u2019s reporters, Rich Schapiro, and inadvertently left a voicemail mentioning Bahrain and a need for money.\n\nGiuliani and Shapiro had spoken on the phone on Oct. 16 about Giuliani\u2019s ties to an Iranian opposition group. Then, the next morning, Schapiro found the message on his voicemail, and it seemed clear that the call was accidental.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nGiuliani can be heard talking to someone else:\n\n\u201cThe problem is we need some money,\u201d Giuliani says on the recording. \u201cWe need a few hundred thousand.\u201d\n\nAt the start of the call, Giuliani can be heard saying, \u201cYou know. Charles would have a hard time with a fraud case \u2018cause he didn\u2019t do any due diligence.\u201d\n\nSchapiro, in a story for NBC News, wrote that it wasn\u2019t clear what the exact context was for portions of the conversation. But he tried to reconstruct some of its meaning, including Giuliani\u2019s ties to Bahrain.\n\nGiuliani also made an accidental call to Schapiro on Sept. 28. In that three-minute voicemail, Giuliani can be heard \u201crailing against the Bidens,\u201d as Schapiro described it. That is nothing new: Giuliani has appeared frequently on TV making unfounded allegations against Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nGiuliani reportedly is the subject of a federal investigation related to his efforts to seek information about the Bidens from sources in Ukraine. Giuliani has denied wrongdoing.\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
