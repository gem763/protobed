He won\u2019t make tomorrow... we won\u2019t know how severe it is until the next couple of days,\u201d Bruce told reporters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those freak ones which unfortunately happen. We were disappointed for him that we\u2019ve lost a player to a freak accident. That\u2019s what happens in football unfortunately.\u201d\n\nAndy Carroll has not played for Newcastle since rejoining them on transfer deadline day due to a niggling ankle injury, although Bruce said the striker was back in training.\n\n\u201cI think for everybody to see him joining in with training was good for him, good for the group... we need now positive news from his specialist,\u201d Bruce added.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always difficult to put a timescale on someone like Andy, he\u2019s fit when he\u2019s fit... when you\u2019ve got an ankle like he\u2019s got, it\u2019s always the reaction to the work put in. At the moment it\u2019s all very good.\u201d\n\nMatt Ritchie is ahead of schedule in his recovery after the winger suffered ankle ligament damage in a League Cup defeat by Leicester City last month.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting to see him for at least a couple of months... but the way he trained yesterday and the day before, as long as he doesn\u2019t have a reaction I don\u2019t think he\u2019s very far away... still a couple of weeks.\u201d", "description": "Newcastle United midfielder Sean Longstaff will miss Saturday's Premier League clash with leaders Liverpool due to a freak ankle injury in training, manager Steve Bruce said on Friday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429392879&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0R4", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
