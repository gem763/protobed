(Illustration: Dave Johnson/Valiant Entertainment)\n\nBlood. Shot. You know, those two words together conjure up an image. So, when scrolling down, you can probably imagine what you\u2019re going to see.\n\nAnd what you\u2019re going to see is Vin Diesel getting shot in the face. But it\u2019s fine! It\u2019s fine! We\u2019re all fine, here. This is Bloodshot, after all, the upcoming adaptation of the comic, which features a soldier named Raymond Garrison who has fancy nanites in his blood. They can heal his injuries and even help him shapeshift!\n\nSo it\u2019s cool. When producer Dinesh Shamdasani released this clip, a short gif teasing the later release of the film\u2019s first trailer, he knew it might be alarming. But it\u2019s totally, totally cool. He can heal himself. Garrison is fine, and his actor Vin Diesel is doing great, and director Dave Wilson, who did VFX supervision for Age of Ultron, is also probably doing spectacular.\n\nEverything\u2019s doing wonderful, here, and it will be even better when Bloodshot hits theatres, presumably with a gruesome slap, on February 21, 2020 in the U.S. There is currently no Australian release date.", "description": "Blood.
