Guess what happened next...", "language": "en", "text": "Daniel Jones had a lot of doubters to prove wrong. When the New York Giants selected the Duke quarterback to be Eli Manning\u2019s heir apparent with the sixth pick in this year\u2019s draft, experts \u2013 actually pretty much everyone \u2013 accused them of reaching for someone who was not seen as a future NFL star during his college career. Even with Manning in decline, it was a controversial decision when the Giants decided to make Jones the starter after two games \u2013 and two losses \u2013 this season. Jones, to put it mildly, failed to give his critics any ammunition on Sunday.\n\nIt didn\u2019t look like that was going to be the case early on against Jameis Winston and the Buccaneers on Sunday, as Tampa Bay took a 28-10 half-time lead over the Giants, scoring on every single possession. Jones looked like a rookie as an early fumble led to a Tampa Bay touchdown. Worse yet: 2018\u2019s Offensive Rookie of the Year Saquon Barkley went down with what was later diagnosed as a high ankle sprain. The only highlight for the Giants in the first-half was Jones rushing for his first NFL touchdown, showing off an entirely different skill set than the notoriously immobile Manning.\n\nBut something clicked for Jones during half-time, as he threw for two touchdowns, cutting the Tampa Bay lead to three points. The Giants defense also woke up as they held the Buccaneers to a single field goal, which eventually set up the game-deciding moment. In a fourth-down situation, with 1:16 left in the game and the Giants needing a touchdown to win, Jones scrambled for a seven-yard touchdown that gave them a slim 32-31 lead.\n\nAnd yet the perfect ending for the Giants \u2013 and Jones \u2013 almost didn\u2019t happen. The Buccaneers had a chance to win the game in the closing seconds, but kicker Matt Gay missed a 34-yard field goal as time expired. It was a heartbreaker of a loss for the Buccaneers, who fell to 1-2, and a much-needed lift for the Giants who were facing an uncertain future without Manning, who had been the team\u2019s starter since 2004 and won two Super Bowls with New York.\n\nNew York Giants (@Giants) Dual Threat!!\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udf9e\ufe0fDaniel Jones Highlights: https://t.co/nZGL3OUltn pic.twitter.com/bFVlgek6gG\n\nSure, the Giants needed luck to pull off the win, but even if the Buccaneers had won the game (as they really should have) it still would have been a moral victory. Jones wasn\u2019t perfect \u2013 he lost the ball twice during the game \u2013 but his balanced approach to the game showed exactly why the Giants defied conventional wisdom by using their first-round pick on him (there\u2019s still validity in the argument that the Giants, who had two first-round picks this year, could have waited for Jones to fall to them at No17 and picked a defensive player at No6). Jones went 23-for-36 and threw for 336 yards in the game to go along with his two passing and two rushing touchdowns. In the process, he neatly sidestepped comparisons to the Giants legend he had abruptly replaced by revealing himself as an altogether different playmaker. We can\u2019t get ahead of ourselves about what this may mean for Jones\u2019s future with the team, it was only one game after all. But it was some game.\n\nMVP of the week\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kyle Allen threw four touchdowns in the Panthers\u2019 victory on Sunday. Photograph: Ross D Franklin/AP\n\nKyle Allen, QB, Carolina Panthers. Kyle Allen\u2019s first half? He only went 13-for-16, picked up 173 yards and threw for two touchdowns without a pick. Allen\u2019s second-half wasn\u2019t that bad either, as he added an additional two touchdowns and padded his stats to 261 yards on the day. Allen, who went undrafted in 2018, was in for Cam Newton, who is dealing with a foot sprain. Allen, alongside Jones, is one of the young quarterbacks who have taken the place of an injured or otherwise ineffective starter this week and he may have impressed more than anybody during the 38-20 win over the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nQuote of the week\n\n\u201cWe sit at 0-3, living a world of suck\u201d \u2013 Denver Broncos receiver Emmanuel Sanders on his team\u2019s performance.\n\nSanders wasn\u2019t misquoting Full Metal Jacket\u2019s Pvt Pyle, he was instead correctly describing his team\u2019s misery-filled existence. With Sunday\u2019s 27-16 loss to the Green Bay Packers, the Broncos have gone seven regular-season games without a win. Their offense hasn\u2019t scored more than 20 points in that streak and their defense hasn\u2019t finagled a single sack this season.\n\nVideo of the week\n\n\n\nNFL Update (@MySportsUpdate) Mecole Hardman 83 yards to the HOUSE. Speed kills.pic.twitter.com/Dkq0F3Cgcu\n\nKansas City Chiefs\u2019 wide receiver Mecole Hardman went off for 83 yards in this touchdown reception against the Baltimore Ravens. He wasn\u2019t even the most impressive offensive player of the game, as Ravens running back Mark Ingram had three rushing touchdowns and the ever superb Patrick Mahomes threw for three of his own as he led the Chiefs to a 33-28 victory.\n\nStat of the week\n\nTwo. That\u2019s the number of defensive touchdowns that the New York Jets have scored this season, which doesn\u2019t sound like a bad stat considering it is only Week 3. But it\u2019s twice as many offensive touchdowns as they have managed. The Jets have some excuses, as starter Sam Darnold is infamously \u201cout indefinitely with mononucleosis\u201d and his backup Trevor Siemian is done for the season. The Patriots beat the Jets 30-14, and New England could have scored many more.\n\n\u201cObviously, we were atrocious,\u201d Jets head coach Adam Gase said after the game, \u201cwe\u2019ve got a lot to fix going into the bye.\u201d He wasn\u2019t quite as eloquent as Sanders, but the point was made just the same.\n\nElsewhere around the league\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Baker Mayfield and the Browns are off to a slower start that they had hoped for. Photograph: David Dermer/AP\n\n-- This is the season that the Cleveland Browns, packed with No1 draft picks and high-profile stars such as Odell Beckham Jr, are supposed to make the leap to a playoff team. So far their only victory has come against a bad team, the Jets. On Sunday they lost to the LA Rams, 20-13. That\u2019s no disgrace \u2013 the Rams are 3-0 this season, reached the Super Bowl in February and have one of the best defenses in the league. And yet the offense \u2013 led by Baker Mayfield and Beckham \u2013 aren\u2019t clicking as some expected. Mayfield in particular has been a concern and has five interceptions to three touchdowns after three games. The Browns still have plenty of time to turn things around but their next four games are against very tough teams \u2013 the Ravens, 49ers, Seahawks and Patriots. We\u2019ll have a better idea of who the Browns really are once those games have been played.\n\n-- The Atlanta Falcons lost starting free safety Keanu Neal to an achilles injury. It\u2019s another brutal piece of misfortune for Neal, who suffered a season-ending ACL tear last year. The Falcon, meanwhile ,nearly pulled off an impressive comeback over the Colts in the game\u2019s final minutes, but Indianapolis were able to hold onto the ball and secure the victory, 27-24.\n\n-- It was an impressive finish in San Francisco. The 49ers were down 20-17 to the Pittsburgh Steelers with just two minutes remaining. With time running down, quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo connected with Dante Pettis for the game-winning touchdown in what ended up being a 24-20 victory. The 49ers remain perfect while the Steelers, still reeling after Ben Roethlisberger\u2019s season-ending injury, are still winless.\n\n-- The Detroit Lions upset the Philadelphia Eagles 27-24, thanks, in part, to Jamal Agnew\u2019s 100-yard kickoff return for a touchdown and improved their record to 2-0-1. The Eagles managed to block a Matt Prater field goal to give them a shot at pulling off a last-minute win, but Detroit were able to prevent Philadelphia from capitalizing.\n\n-- The Dallas Cowboys dismantled Miami for a 31-6 victory, dropping the Dolphins\u2019 record to 0-3. It most situations this would be a disastrous beginning to the season but since Miami are in the midst of one of the most blatant tank jobs in the history of the NFL, it means that they\u2019re one step closer to winning their own personal Super Bowl (aka snagging the top pick in next year\u2019s draft).\n\n\n\n", "description": "The Giants chose a quarterback with a middling reputation to succeed Eli Manning.
