Stabilisation in the business was expected during the second quarter after a \u201cchallenging\u201d first quarter, he said.\n\nWhile the amount of travel transactions flowing through Flight Centre were increasing in Australia, he reaffirmed that the company had \u201cnot yet seen any tangible benefits flowing from recent interest rate cuts and tax refunds\u201d.\n\nAny benefits were more likely to be seen later in [this financial year], \u201cassuming consumer confidence improved ahead of the year\u2019s peak booking periods for longer haul holidays\u201d, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFlight Centre confirmed that the UK collapse of travel outfit Thomas Cook had had minimal impact on the company.\n\nMr Turner at the conference highlighted that online leisure sales were increasing rapidly in Australia. One example was its flightcentre.com.au site notching 65 per cent growth in the first quarter in terms of total transactions, which includes money Flight Centre passes on to other companies such as airlines.\n\n\u201cThis growth is predominantly coming from domestic travellers who are new to the Flight Centre brand, rather than from existing customers who are moving between sales channels, pointing to increased market share over the period,\u201d Mr Turner said.\n\nFlight Centre recorded underlying 12-month profits of $343 million last year.", "description": "Travel outfit warns that the good times in early 2019 are unlikely to be repeated in first-half earnings.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2172%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_2%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/0af506adeab975a5b36db92c80df70f10f060463", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
