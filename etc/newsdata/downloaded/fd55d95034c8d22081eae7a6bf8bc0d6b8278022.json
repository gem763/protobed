It is what turned me on to horror in general, just the idea of the campfire setting with the kids telling stories felt really authentic and genuine,\u201d Grabinski told TheWrap.\n\n\u201cWatching something scary together is one of the last group experiences we have where you can feel really feel a communal energy,\u201d he said, but \u201cfor a while, I don\u2019t think people were making horror content that felt authentic to kids,\u201d Grabinski explained.\n\nAlso Read: Watch Rob Gronkowski and Lindsey Vonn's Slime Showdown at Nickelodeon 'Kids' Choice Sports 2019' (Exclusive Video)\n\nKaplan also grew up devouring horror stories. \u201cMy favorite show as a kid was \u2018Are You Afraid of the Dark?\u2019 \u2026 it was very scary but safely so at that age. When you were 12, it was the scariest thing that ever existed, but when you\u2019re an adult it\u2019s a little different.\u201d Working on the reboot, \u201cI felt like I got to tap into all my nostalgia for the show but also make it new and modern,\u201d he added.\n\nWith children today being bombarded by adult content on TV, streaming services and over the internet, parents naturally worry about what is suitable for young viewers.\n\n\u201cFor me, it was important that the show is OK for the nine-to-12 year range, and that the adults who grew up with the original still enjoy it,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cSo I tried to remember what scared me at that age, I also have a feeling that as a kid, a happy ending is required. The older you get, I think you can deal better with darker turns. As a kid, you want something that is scary but that the good guys win and everything is OK as it is a little less traumatizing. Whereas the stuff I enjoy as an adult may have the darkest ending imaginable,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI think it would be a great thing for parents to watch with their kids. Most kids will be OK but everyone has a different line and it is always subjective,\u201d Kaplan advised.\n\nAlso Read: Nickelodeon Lands New 'LEGO Jurassic World' Animated Miniseries -- Watch First Teaser (Video)\n\nSeries star and \u201cIt\u201d alum Taylor said the reboot achieves \u201can amazing balance between scary stories and showing the chemistry between all the kids \u2014 keeping a good balance of the scary while also making a heartwarming story.\u201d\n\nThe new \u201cAre You Afraid of the Dark?\u201d is produced by ACE Entertainment (\u201cTo All The Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before,\u201d \u201cThe Perfect Date\u201d) with ACE founder Kaplan and Spencer Berman serving as executive producers.\n\nThe series is written by Grabinski (\u201cSkiptrace\u201d) and directed by Dean Israelite (\u201cPower Rangers\u201d movie, \u201cProject Almanac\u201d), both of whom will also executive produce.
