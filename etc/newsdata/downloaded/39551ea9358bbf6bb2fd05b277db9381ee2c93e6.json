And the early numbers suggest they can actually do just that.\n\nSmileDirectClub opened down about 14% Thursday on its debut at the Nasdaq after pricing at the top of its $19 to $23 range Wednesday evening. The stock fell 16% to $19.23 by early afternoon trading.\n\nSmileDirectClub Chief Financial Officer Kyle Wailes tells Yahoo Finance the company isn\u2019t getting caught up in the first day response, emphasizing the long-term potential for the company.\n\nSmileDirectClub was founded in 2014 by one-time metal braces wearers \u2014 and longtime pals \u2014 Alex Fenkel and Jordan Katzman. Since their debut, SmileDirectClub has expanded into new products such as teeth whitening, overnight retailers and lip balm.\n\nDavid Katzman, CEO of SmileDirectClub stands with founders Jordan Katzman (R) and Alex Fenkell as the company debuts its IPO at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York, U.S. September 12, 2019.

Fenkel says he is particularly upbeat on the prospect to open close to 1,500 stores inside CVS over time. Wailes says the company is in talks with other retailers for similar relationships.\n\nThose expansion efforts have taken SmileDirectClub to the cusp of profitability unlike other hot IPOs this year such as Uber (UBER), Lyft (LYFT) and Slack (WORK).\n\nFor the six months ended June 30, SmileDirectClub\u2019s sales surged 113% to $373 million. Operating losses tallied $15.7 million down from $19 million a year ago. But on an adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) basis, the company eked out a $2.3 million profit versus a $8.5 million loss a year earlier.\n\nDavid Katzman, Jordan\u2019s father, is chairman and CEO. Following the IPO, David Katzman \u2014 who oversees 15 other businesses (excluding SmileDirectClub) as managing partner of Camelot Venture Group \u2014 will have majority voting control over decisions at the company.\n\nBrian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and co-host of The First Trade at Yahoo Finance.
