When I started Katie and I spoke at length about what the right ending would be.\n\n\"Life does sometimes take an unbelievably cruel turn, we both felt that was the most responsible way to end the story rather than, as sometimes happens in soap, people miraculously recover[ing] from a terrible illness as if it never happened.\n\n\"Telling the tough version was the right version to tell.\"\n\nReferring to how her death lasts for an hour and a half over two episodes, he added: \"After two and a half years of telling a story it would be remiss of us to gallop through the end.\n\n\"I feel like it\u2019s something we tend to short circuit on TV \u2013 as Ken says at one point, we\u2019re used to seeing death on TV but usually an array of bad guys being mowed down by Bruce Willis - we are immune to the realities of it and scared of looking at it.\n\n\"The right thing to do was to spend a lot of time in that one room and see how it transpires.\"\n\n*Sinead's final scenes air on Coronation Street for half an hour on Thursday 24 October and Friday 25 October for an hour", "description": "Coronation Street's executive producer Iain said that he had always intended for the factory worker to die ever since she first discovered she had cancer", "authors": ["Rose Hill"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20582603.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS195887499.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
