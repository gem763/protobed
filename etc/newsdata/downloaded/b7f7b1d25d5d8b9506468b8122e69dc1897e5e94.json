If you look at the new Q3 next to its predecessor, you notice how much more \u2018grown-up\u2019 it is.\n\nDRIVEN | 2019 Audi Q3 Sportback\n\nThe interior also looks and feels a lot more premium thanks to the array of features borrowed straight from higher class models.\n\nAt launch, there is only one engine available in the Audi Q3, which is the 1.4-litre turbocharged petrol engine that powers the 35TFSI model.\n\nImage: Motorpress\n\nThe unit produces 110kW of power and 250Nm of torque and sends it all to the front wheels through a 6-speed S-Tronic automatic transmission.\n\nStrong characteristics\n\nThere are also quite a few driver aids to make the Audi Q3 a bit easier and safer to drive. Features like lane departure warning, park assist, rearview camera and a 360-degree camera are all available on the compact SUV, however, I did find the exclusion of adaptive cruise control to be rather counter-intuitive for the Audi Q3, especially considering that it will most likely be geared toward long-distance road trips and cruising.\n\nDuring our time with it on national roads, the Audi Q3 proved to be a pleasant car to live with. It accelerates quick enough to overtake and the handling was even better.\n\nImage: Motorpress\n\nThe Audi Q3 was also good at tackling dirt roads, mostly thanks to the sensible tyres that come equipped on it. You can feel that Audi is investing time and effort into reducing the understeer of their cars and the Q3 is a prime example of this.\n\n\n\nRead the full review here.\n\n\n\nWheels24's Janine Van der Post says: \"I am battling to get used to the new nomenclature of Audi's new models, but just like we had to adapt to Mercedes-Benz new naming structure, I am sure we will get used to it quickly.\n\n\n\nThe Q3 is a striking vehicle, both inside and out. Audi has always been a brand that seems to believe in minimalism in terms of clutter on the interior, and it always works.\n\n\n\nThe 1.4-litre engine is incredible and the 110kW/250Nm power figures are impressive from such a small-capacity unit. Throttle response and gear changes are super-smooth, and it drives a charm. There's not an ounce of turbo lag and it's so easy to drive, but that's Audi for you.\n\n\n\nThe chronos grey unit we recently had on test has a standard price tag of R585 000, but our was packed with optional goodies to the value of R163 050 which included the metallic paint, 19\" cast alloy wheels, Audi drive select, Audi phone box, comfort package (electric tailgate, parking aid plus, seat heating, storage and luggage package, etc), rearview camera, technology package, and trailer hitch... to name a few.\n\n\n\nAll of this takes the price up to R748 050. Worth it, yes, but it does then make one think twice about the options. I also wished the legroom in the rear was a bit more flexible for passengers, and that's a box I would want ticked on my list of requirements. It also immediately makes me want to look at other options in the price range.\n\n\n\nBut, if you're looking for a compact SUV which sufficient space, and no compromise on great handling and dynamics, this could very well be a perfect fit for you.\n\n", "description": "Audi added the latest version of one of its best-selling SUVs, the Q3.
