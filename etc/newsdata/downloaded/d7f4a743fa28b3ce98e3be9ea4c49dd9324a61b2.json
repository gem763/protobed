To raise funds, Malaysia will sell samurai bonds early next year, and continue its pursuit of assets lost in the 1MDB state investment-fund scandal, he said.\n\nThe government remains committed to reducing the fiscal deficit in the medium term, and could reach a balanced budget in five years if trade tensions between the U.S. and China are resolved, Lim said.\n\nThe government widened its deficit target for 2020 to 3.2% of gross domestic product, from a previous target of 3%, to get the fiscal space it needs to support economic growth. On Friday, Lim announced larger development spending for next year and offered a slew of incentives to win over investors amid the trade war, which he described as a unique opportunity for Malaysia to attract investment.\n\nSpecial Channel\n\nA special channel aims to make it easier for Chinese investors to enter the Malaysian market starting next year, Lim said in the interview Monday in Kuala Lumpur. He expects foreign-direct investment from China to reach levels of investment from the U.S. and Europe in coming years.\n\nSoon after Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad returned to power last year, Malaysia halted or canceled major projects and slashed spending to rein in debt. That tone has changed since Lim said in February that he was nearly done cleaning house. The government raised next year\u2019s transport allocation by 8.8% to fund a Kuala Lumpur mass rapid transit project and the Pan-Borneo Highway, while allocating 10 billion ringgit ($2.4 billion) to help Malaysians buy homes.\n\nMalaysia will raise funds by selling yen-denominated bonds in the first quarter of next year, with the size to be determined after talks with Japan, Lim said. The government raised 200 billion yen ($1.85 billion) this year at a coupon of 0.53%, lower than the 0.65% he indicated before the sale. Lim said he\u2019s open to other types of bonds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a pricing issue.\u201d he said. \u201cWe are willing to consider all issues provided the price is right.\u201d\n\nReparation Payments\n\nMahathir has made it a mission to bring back money believed to be lost through 1MDB. Lim reiterated that he wants Goldman Sachs Group Inc (NYSE: ). to make \u201creparation payments\u201d amounting to $7.5 billion for the bank\u2019s role in arranging bond sales for the troubled state fund. Until then, Malaysia will continue legal proceedings against the U.S. bank and its 17 current and former directors, Lim said.\n\n\u201cI hope they back up their words with deeds,\u201d he said, referring to comments from Goldman President and Chief Operating Officer John Waldron, who said last month the bank wants to get the Malaysian people the money they deserve.\n\n\u201cIf they want to make Malaysians happy, then back it up with reparation payments,\u201d Lim said.\n\n(Updates with details from interview throughout.)", "description": "Malaysia Won\u2019t Raise Tax Even as Trade War Halts Fiscal Plan", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic48bc492b25da92e4d5d7d7e3eb97bdb0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
