The president has a long record of disavowing the intel community's findings, distorting its conclusions to suit his narrative, and siding with hostile foreign powers over the US.\n\nOn the other hand, the stark implications of this development \u2014 that a US spy had to be extracted in part because the President of the United States could not be trusted to protect their identity \u2014 floored intelligence veterans because it confirmed some of the worst fears about Trump.\n\nRobert Deitz, a former top lawyer at the CIA and the National Security Agency, told Insider his first reaction to the news was, \"I told you so. Loose lips sink ships, and Trump has the loosest lips.\"\n\nStill, he said, \"it's difficult to fathom.\"\n\n\"For most of us, in order to gain access to this kind of information, we go through countless briefings in which desk tops are pounded saying how important and how dangerous these secrets are,\" Deitz said. \"By contrast, the president is provided with this by virtue of his election, and this president in particular has no understanding how dangerous it is to share this information with the bad guys.\"\n\nRead more: The US had to extract a top spy from Russia after Trump revealed classified information to the Russians in an Oval Office meeting\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump meets with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, left, next to Russian Ambassador to the U.S. Sergei Kislyak at the White House in Washington, Wednesday, May 10, 2017.

Eventually, the report said, the source became invaluable after they \"landed an influential position\" that included access to Russian President Vladimir Putin himself.\n\nBut as the US learned the extent to which Russia was interfering in the 2016 election, and as the media reported on it and the existence of the CIA's sources in the Kremlin, US officials reportedly worried about the source's safety and decided to offer to extract them in late 2016. Their concerns were compounded when, in May 2017, Trump disclosed top-secret intelligence to senior Russian officials during an Oval Office meeting.\n\nAt the meeting, Trump shared intelligence connected to the Islamic State in Syria. The information came from Israel, which had not given the US permission to share it with the Russians because it could have compromised an Israeli source in the region.\n\nTrump's disclosure at the meeting was not specifically related to the Russian spy. But his disregard of strict intelligence-sharing rules to protect highly placed sources \"prompted intelligence officials to renew earlier discussions about the potential risk\" that the source in Russia would be exposed, CNN reported.\n\nRead more:'He's losing his s---': Trump's advisers are increasingly worried about his mental state following days of erratic behavior\n\nU.S. President Trump presents Presidential Medal of Freedom to NBA Hall of Famer West at the White House in Washington Reuters\n\nMike Pompeo, then the director of the CIA, also told senior Trump administration officials that too much information about the source was leaking out. The source was extracted soon after.\n\nDeitz said the episode highlighted the irony of Trump's tendency to \"degrade and devalue\" the intel community's work and his simultaneous fascination with sharing its product with others.\n\n\"He constantly disparages the work and the information he gets from the intel community, but in a moment of preening he disclosed that information to the Russians in a one-on-one meeting,\" Deitz said. \"He clearly knows it's important enough, or cool enough, to share with them.\"\n\nMoreover, he added, \"the Russians aren't stupid. They're going to track down how Trump learned that information and where it came from, and that's the kind of thing that costs lives.\"\n\nAlmost as critically, he said, it could compromise an important channel of information.\n\nThis isn't the first time the president has publicly revealed sensitive information. Late last month, Trump stunned experts when he tweeted out a photo taken by one of the US's most secretive spy satellites that was provided to him during a classified intelligence briefing.\n\nRead more: The photo Trump tweeted out from a classified briefing likely came from one of the US's most secretive spy satellites\n\nAnd in early 2018, the president declassified a highly controversial memo by Rep. Devin Nunes, then the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, for political purposes. Trump's action went against the advice of senior intelligence officials who warned that its release could compromise sources and methods.\n\nRep. Devin Nunes. AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File\n\n'Do you not inform the President of the United States of sensitive information because he might compromise it?'\n\nFrank Montoya Jr., a recently retired FBI special agent, told Insider it \"would not surprise me at all\" if Trump's actions, both public and private, had forced the US to extract other sources for their own protection.\n\n\"Not only was there this particular meeting with the Russians, but what about his one-on-one encounters with Putin?\" Montoya said. \"What did Trump give up in those meetings that could have compromised sources and methods?\"\n\nThe former agent also pointed to the myriad contacts that members of the Trump campaign had with Russians during the 2016 election and after.\n\n\"I don't think any of the professionals are running their mouths, but what of the Trump family members?\" Montoya said. \"All the unreported contacts outlined in the Mueller report have relevance in situations like this.\"\n\nGlenn Carle, a longtime former CIA covert operative and vocal Trump critic, told Insider it's been \"obvious\" to him since before Trump was elected that his approach to handling intelligence would endanger \"sources and methods ... and lives of officers.\"\n\nFormer officials also pointed to Trump's frequent and puzzling defenses of Putin and Russia over the last several years.\n\nTaken together, Carle said he believes there's \"overwhelming\" evidence that the US president is \"at least compromised by Russian intelligence.\"\n\nMontoya said he sees the president more as \"useful idiot\" but that the end result is still the same.\n\nRead more: US spies say Trump's G7 performance suggests he's either a 'Russian asset' or a 'useful idiot' for Putin\n\nNational security officials also stressed the time, energy, and resources that go into cultivating human intelligence sources, or HUMINT.\n\nHUMINT is the most expensive to develop compared to other forms of intelligence like signals intelligence (SIGINT), imagery intelligence (IMINT), and others. It's also typically the most fragile because it relies on individuals rather than technology.\n\nThe \"tooth-to-tail ratio\" for developing HUMINT is \"terrible,\" Deitz said. Tooth-to-tail ratio is military jargon that refers to the amount of support (tail) it takes to protect an asset (tooth). \"For every person in a country, there's a huge tail of support that's needed. You actually have to give a s--- about your spies.\"\n\nThen there's the risk of additional consequences down the road.\n\n\"If an asset was extracted, what does that mean for those who remained behind?\" Montoya said. \"Are they rethinking their relationships with the US? Are they refusing to talk to us anymore? Are others rejecting our approaches because we can't be trusted?\"\n\n\"And what kind of position does that put our agencies in who run these assets?\" he added. \"Especially if those assets are run jointly with a friendly foreign [intelligence service]? Do you not inform the President of the United States of sensitive information because he might compromise it? It's a hell of a spot to be in if you're in the intelligence business.\"\n\nIn response to CNN's story about the spy's extraction, Brittany Bramell, the CIA's director of public affairs, told the outlet in a statement that \"misguided speculation that the President's handling of our nation's most sensitive intelligence \u2014 which he has access to each and every day \u2014 drove an alleged exfiltration operation is inaccurate.\"\n\nThe White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement to CNN that its \"reporting is not only incorrect, it has the potential to put lives in danger.\"", "description": "\"We go through countless briefings in which desk tops are pounded saying how important and how dangerous these secrets are,\" said one intel vet.", "authors": ["Sonam Sheth"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d76bd912e22af059e2ac9bd-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
