Is that what we say to vulnerable kids? It's irresponsible and elitist.\u201d\n\nThe foreign secretary also claimed the government had failed to put forward new proposals to secure a Brexit deal for fear the EU would leak them.\n\n\u201cWhat we are slightly reticent about doing, given past experience, is putting pieces of paper that will get leaked and rubbished by the other side,\u201d he said.\n\nIt is now clear that, regardless of the law to command a request to delay Brexit, the prime minister will not ask for it at the crucial EU summit on 17 October.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
