Trump said: \"[The Russians] were very cooperative, they really were good... Russia treated us great. They opened up, we had to fly over certain Russia areas, Russia-held areas. Russia was great.\"\n\nRussia didn\u2019t seem to see it the same way.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry\u2019s spokesman, Major General Igor Konashenkov, refuted President Trump\u2019s statement, stating in part: \u201cThe Russian Defense Ministry has no reliable information about U.S. servicemen conducting an operation for \u2018yet another\u2019 elimination of the former Daesh leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in the Turkish-controlled part of the Idlib de-escalation zone.\u201d\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry also disputed President Trump\u2019s claim that Russia provided access to U.S. air units entering the airspace over the Idlib de-escalation zone during that mission in Syria. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to provide a comment about President Trump\u2019s announcement, directing everyone to General Konashenkov\u2019s statement.\n\nKremlin-controlled Russian state media shot down President Trump\u2019s announcement, with headlines that read: \u201cThe Russian Defense Ministry does not believe in al-Baghdadi\u2019s liquidation.\u201d Major General Igor Konashenkov scoffed at the changing details of the operation, with Trump adding alleged participants and various countries that supposedly took part in the raid, \u201ceach with completely contradictory details,\u201d which Konashenkov said \u201craises reasonable questions and doubts about [the operation\u2019s] veracity, not to mention success.\u201d\n\nKonashenkov said that the entire territory of the Idlib de-escalation zone that is not under control of the Assad government is in the grip of the Syrian branch of Al-Qaeda\u2014the terrorist group Jebhat al-Nusra\u2014which he argued \u201calways uncompromisingly exterminated any ISIS representatives on the spot as the main rivals for power in Syria.\u201d Therefore, Konashenkov does not believe President Trump\u2019s claims that the former ISIS leader could be quietly hiding in the territory controlled by Syrian Al-Qaeda, demanding \u201cat least some direct evidence from the United States or other participants in the operation.\"\n\nKonashenkov skeptically pointed out that al-Baghdadi was already supposedly \u201celiminated\u201d multiple times, with such claims being later disproven. In fact, Russia itself, as well as the Assad regime, have falsely claimed to have killed the ISIS leader multiple times.\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry\u2019s spokesman further emphasized that even if al-Baghdadi were to be eliminated, that wouldn\u2019t change facts on the ground in Syria or make any difference with respect to the multiple escaped ISIS fighters.\n\nIn his Sunday show, the infamous state TV propagandist Dmitry Kiselyov took another jab at the United States, exclaiming that \u201cexcept for Russia and Syria, no one has ever seriously fought against ISIS.\u201d Kiselyov made fun of Trump\u2019s claim that America is \u201cprotecting the oil fields in Syria,\u201d stating that \u201cAmericans are in Syria illegally. Sooner or later, they will have to get out of there completely. Let them guard their oil\u2014in another hemisphere.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov made the similar point to U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a call reportedly initiated by the American side. Lavrov decried President Trump\u2019s stated goal of \u201cprotecting the local oilfields from ISIS\u201d as a violation of international law and told Pompeo that all natural resources in Syria belong to Damascus. Lavrov and Pompeo also reportedly discussed other unspecified issues with respect to relations between Moscow and Washington.\n\nRussia is not only skeptical of President Trump\u2019s claims with respect to the killing of al-Baghdadi, but openly refers to his announcement as mere \u201cpropaganda,\u201d designed to appease his electorate and help him get re-elected. Denis Davydov, Russian state TV correspondent in the United States, told Rossiya-24 that \u201cTrump has elections coming up in a year and this announcement of al-Baghdadi\u2019s liquidation will add some points for the Commander-in-Chief.\u201d", "description": "The Russian Defense Ministry also disputed claims that Russia provided access to U.S. air units entering airspace it controls.", "authors": ["Julia Davis"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1968,w_3500,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1572198433/RTR2H63U_rnrnq5", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
