REUTERS/Bobby Yip/File Photo\n\nThe proposed deal aims to create an exchange powerhouse spanning Asia and Europe which would be better able to compete with U.S. rivals such as Intercontinental Exchange Inc (ICE.N) and CME Group inc (CME.O).\n\nHong Kong Exchanges and Clearing\u2019s (HKEX) (0388.HK) indicative offer, made public after the close of the city\u2019s markets on Wednesday, also got a cool response in London, where LSE shares finished up 5.9%, far short of the implied premium.\n\nTough political and technical challenges to the deal have already surfaced and HKEX shares were off 3.3% in Hong Kong, underperforming the blue-chip Hang Seng Index .HSI.\n\nHKEX\u2019s proposal is conditional on LSE abandoning a $27 billion acquisition of financial information provider Refinitiv from U.S. private equity firm Blackstone (BX.N) and Thomson Reuters (TRI.TO), the parent of Reuters News.\n\nThat deal, which went public in late July, caused LSE\u2019s shares to leap 15% on hopes Refinitiv\u2019s financial data business would boost its long-term profitability. LSE said in a statement on Wednesday that it remained committed to the Refinitiv deal.\n\nHKEX has 28 days to make a firm bid for the LSE, whose shares were down 0.2% at 7,194 pence at 0809 GMT on Thursday, or walk away for six months.\n\nA source close to the LSE said HKEX executives met with LSE Chief Executive David Schwimmer in London on Monday, just two days before they made the proposal public.\n\nThe LSE board will meet within days to decide if it will engage with HKEX and thereby effectively ditch the Refinitiv takeover, the source added.\n\nAn LSE spokeswoman had no comment on Thursday.\n\nAnalysts said the perception of Beijing\u2019s growing influence over Hong Kong could become a key sticking point for an LSE takeover given the government\u2019s close links with the HKEX.\n\nFitch Ratings said that \u201cincreasing control by Chinese authorities over Hong Kong\u201d could raise regulatory concerns in Britain and the United States about data and information security.\n\nHong Kong is entering a fourth month of sometimes violent protests sparked by legislation that would have drawn the former British colony closer to the Chinese legal system.\n\nThe government\u2019s handling of the protests has been criticized internationally, as has the political pressure applied by Beijing to Hong Kong companies not to support the pro-democracy movement.\n\nCathay Pacific Airways (0293.HK) was ordered to suspend staff who were involved in or supported the demonstrations.\n\nThe Hong Kong government holds a 6% stake in the HKEX, approves six of the 13 board members and can also stop any other shareholding rising above 5%.\n\n\u201cThe transaction will require various regulatory approvals, which will stress-test the world\u2019s understanding of Hong Kong\u2019s \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 constitution,\u201d said David Blennerhassett, an independent analyst writing on the SmartKarma research platform.\n\n\u201cIt will be politically tough now and in the near-term to get this through various regulatory channels,\u201d he added.\n\nHKEX DOWNGRADE\n\nAnalysts said HKEX\u2019s share price fall reflected investor concern about the dilutive impact of the cash-and-shares offer, and scepticism the offer would succeed.\n\n\u201cIf the market thought the deal was going to go ahead, I would have expected the shares to have fallen by more than 3%, typically that\u2019s what we\u2019d expect for an acquirer in a deal like this,\u201d said Michael Wu, analyst at Morningstar.\n\nUnder the terms of the offer, LSE shareholders would receive 2,045 pence in cash and 2.495 newly issued HKEX shares. HKEX said it intended to apply for a secondary listing of its shares on the LSE if the deal went through.\n\nCitigroup downgraded HKEX to \u2018sell\u2019 from \u2018buy\u2019, saying the acquisition price was high and could \u201cadd downward pressure\u201d to the exchange\u2019s shares and valuation. Regulatory hurdles for the deal were also high, it said in its research note.\n\nAnalysts however said they could see strategic logic in HKEX\u2019s move.\n\n\u201cWe believe that bringing the largest listed exchanges in Asia and Europe together could create new revenue streams and a lot depends on how well HKEX can capitalise on this,\u201d Daiwa Capital Markets analyst Jonas Kan wrote in a research report.", "description": "Hong Kong stock exchange shares fell more than 3% on Thursday as investors raised concerns about the political and regulatory risks involved in its $39 billion approach to take over London Stock Exchange (LSE) .", "authors": ["Jennifer Hughes", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1428886879&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B02U", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
