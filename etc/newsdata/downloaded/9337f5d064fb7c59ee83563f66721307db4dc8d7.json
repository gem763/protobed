No one is above the law.\u201d\n\nThe rhetorical stakes of that comment are high; the material stakes are not so clear. Pelosi\u2019s announcement came after months in which she worked to put the brakes on impeachment, even as a growing number of Democrats began to support launching a formal inquiry. But over the past few days, more members of the caucus joined them. That included a group of moderate Democratic freshmen, whom Pelosi feared she would be endangering politically by moving forward, and Representative John Lewis, a respected elder statesman.\n\nBut although Pelosi called it an \u201cofficial impeachment inquiry,\u201d she didn\u2019t offer any indication of what that would mean in practice. She said she is directing chairs of committees to work together \u201cunder that umbrella of impeachment inquiry.\u201d She did not announce plans for a separate impeachment inquiry, nor for new appropriations or hiring. That creates the possibility that business will continue in the House as usual, only with the speaker herself now labeling that business an impeachment inquiry.\n\nYoni Appelbaum: Impeach Donald Trump\n\n\u201cIf we have to honor our oath of office to support and defend the Constitution of the United States, from all enemies, foreign and domestic, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll have to do,\u201d Pelosi told The Atlantic\u2019s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, today at The Atlantic Festival in Washington. \u201cBut we have to have the facts.\u201d\n\nThe protean nature of impeachment inquiries became apparent in the first attempt to remove a president. The House began considering impeaching Andrew Johnson in early 1867. As my colleague Yoni Appelbaum has written, the initial charges against Johnson included a host of substanceless rumors, including the allegation that he\u2019d been involved in the plot to assassinate Abraham Lincoln. As the investigation proceeded, a number of rumors were exposed as baseless. \u201cMany of the claims against Johnson failed to survive the journey,\u201d Appelbaum writes. \u201cThose that did eventually helped form the basis for his impeachment.\u201d\n\nThe act that ultimately led to Johnson\u2019s impeachment, the firing of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, had not yet occurred when the impeachment inquiry began. But once an inquiry was open, it took on a life of its own, and ultimately brought the president to within a single vote of removal from office.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Trump admits everything\n\nRichard Nixon was not impeached, because he resigned from office before the House had a chance to act, realizing he would probably be convicted and removed from office. Still, the events that led up to his resignation demonstrate the same unpredictability. Some House Democrats had been toying with impeachment even before the Watergate break-in. There were new calls, again unsuccessful, after the break-in. Only after the Saturday Night Massacre did the House Judiciary Committee open an impeachment inquiry. Meanwhile, the Senate Watergate Committee, which had been created to investigate the break-in but did not assume there had been presidential wrongdoing, turned up extensive evidence of Nixon\u2019s personal involvement in a cover-up. One of the three articles of impeachment passed against Nixon concerned his refusal to comply with subpoenas by the committee after the impeachment inquiry had begun.", "description": "The House opens its impeachment inquiry, and there\u2019s no telling where it will lead.", "authors": ["David A.
