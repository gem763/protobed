Great actor, instant integrity, loads of warmth, intelligence, complexity and gravitas,\u201d Mr. Ray said in a statement released by the network on Monday. \u201cWe talked backstage after I saw him in \u2018To Kill a Mockingbird\u2019 on Broadway, and I knew I was looking at the only person who could play Jim Comey. Lucky for me, he said yes.\u201d\n\nMr. Daniels, like Mr. Comey, is a staunch critic of President Trump.\n\n\u201cWho are the heroes going to be?\u201d Mr. Daniels asked an MSNBC panel in May regarding leaks in the Trump administration. \u201cIs it going to be the Daniel Ellsberg \u2018Pentagon Papers\u2019 guy? Whose the guy the Justice Department is going to go, \u2018Here, Washington Post. Here\u2019s the unredacted. Go. I\u2019m waiting for that guy. I need people to stand up and be heroic. Who are you? Because democracy is at stake.\u201d\n\nSome of Mr. Daniels\u2018 awards include a Best Lead Actor Emmy for \u201cThe Newsroom\u201d and Best Supporting Actor for \u201cGodless.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
