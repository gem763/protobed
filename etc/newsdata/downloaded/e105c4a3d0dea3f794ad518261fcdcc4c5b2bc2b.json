Gen. Paul Van Riper\u2019s own hodgepodge of troops, ships and planes was similar in organization and capability to Iran\u2019s actual forces. Van Riper\u2019s success in blunting a simulated American assault could reveal how Tehran might fight in the real world.\n\n\u201cThe exercise was called Millennium Challenge 2002,\u201d Blake Stilwell wrote for We Are the Mighty.\n\nIt was designed by the Joint Forces Command over the course of two years. It had 13,500 participants, numerous live and simulated training sites, and was supposed to pit an Iran-like Middle Eastern country against the U.S. military, which would be fielding advanced technology it didn't plan to implement until five years later. The war game would begin with a forced-entry exercise that included the 82nd Airborne and the 1st Marine Division. When the blue forces issued a surrender ultimatum, Van Riper, commanding the red forces, turned them down. Since the Bush Doctrine of the period included preemptive strikes against perceived enemies, Van Riper knew the blue forces would be coming for him. And they did. But the three-star general didn't spend 41 years in the Marine Corps by being timid. As soon as the Navy was beyond the point of no return, he hit them and hit them hard. Missiles from land-based units, civilian boats, and low-flying planes tore through the fleet as explosive-ladened speedboats decimated the Navy using suicide tactics. His code to initiate the attack was a coded message sent from the minarets of mosques at the call to prayer. In less than 10 minutes, the whole thing was over and Lt. Gen. Paul Van Riper was victorious.\n\nMicah Zenko provided some context in a piece for War on the Rocks. \u201cThe impact of the [opposing force\u2019s] ability to render a U.S. carrier battle group \u2014 the centerpiece of the U.S. Navy \u2014 militarily worthless stunned most of the MC \u201902 participants.\u201d\n\nThe shock compelled exercise planners to rig the rest of the war game for U.S. forces.\n\n[Joint Forces Command commander Gen. Buck] Kernan received an urgent phone call from [exercise planner, retired Army general Gary] Luck: \u201cSir, Van Riper just slimed all of the ships.\u201d Kernan recognized that this was bad news because it placed at risk [Joint Forces Command\u2019s] ability to fulfill the remaining live-fire, forced-entry component of the exercise \u2014 a central component of MC \u201902. The actual forces were awaiting orders at Fort Bragg, off the coast of San Diego, and at the Fort Irwin National Training Center. Kernan recalled, \u201cI didn\u2019t have a lot of choice. I had to do the forcible entry piece.\u201d He directed the white cell [exercise planners] to simply refloat the virtual ships to the surface. [Army general B. B.] Bell and his blue team \u2014 now including the live-fire forces operating under his direction \u2014 applied the lessons from the initial attack and fended off subsequent engagements from the red team.\n\nThat and other interference by exercise planners made Van Riper \u201cfurious,\u201d Zenko wrote.", "description": "How would this play out in real life?", "authors": ["David Axe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mn63MpAWl5yXnFTo6n0YhA--~B/aD0xMDQ0O3c9MTQ0MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_national_interest_705/59afea3189f49242fed3e3943fd30f9c", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
