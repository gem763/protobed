In June, a 22-year-old man was arrested on a murder charge in the death of a transgender woman Chynal Lindsey, whose body was found in a Dallas lake. The same month, 33-year-old Kendrell Lavar Lyles was arrested on murder charges in the deaths of three other women in Dallas, including 23-year-old transgender woman Muhlaysia Booker in May.

Dallas Police Major Vincent Weddington said in May that Booker's slaying, the shooting death of a transgender woman in a car in October 2018 and a stabbing attack on a transgender woman in April all have \"similarities,\" but said investigators haven't determined definitive links between them.\n\nDallas police couldn't immediately provide answers to a series of questions from CBS News, including whether or not they believe the latest attack may be linked to any of the others.\n\nAdvocacy groups say attacks on transgender people in the U.S. are on the rise, \"CBS This Morning\" reported. Last year, the Human Rights Campaign tracked at least 26 deaths due to fatal violence. The majority of victims were black transgender women.\n\nHate crime statutes in Texas allow for more stringent penalties for crimes motivated by sexual orientation bias, but not for crimes motivated by bias against someone's gender identity or expression, leading equality advocates to call for change.", "description": "Friday night incident comes amid community concern over a series of attacks on transgender women in the Texas city", "authors": ["Erin Donaghue", "Erin Donaghue Reports", "Writes For Cbsnews.Com On Topics Including Criminal Justice", "Social Justice", "Culture.
