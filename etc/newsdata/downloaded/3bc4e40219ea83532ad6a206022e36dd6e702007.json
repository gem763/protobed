Before anyone starts imagining a totally meatless future (speaking of horror shows), we should figure out why so many people are flocking to plant-based \u201cmeat\u201d like the Impossible Whopper and its cousins. Since experts are quickly concluding that these products are no healthier for you (or for the environment) than their traditional animal-based counterparts, what\u2019s the attraction making these offerings sustainable?\n\n(Insert record scratch sound effect here.) Whoa! Hold on one second. Did someone just say that these \u201cimpossible\u201d foods aren\u2019t any better for you? Wasn\u2019t that supposed to be the whole idea? As it turns out, they\u2019re not. So the people peddling them had better figure out another market hook if they want their businesses to continue booming.\n\nThe latest \u201cwoke\u201d take on vegan fast food, like the Impossible Whopper and Del Taco Beyond Meats tacos, is this: They\u2019re not any healthier than the standard meat versions of those items. Outlets from NBC News to Fox Business to CNBC are all sounding the alarm that these menu items often contain roughly the same amount of calories than their beefy counterparts\u2014and often pack in more sodium. But is health even the real reason customers are ordering these Impossible and Beyond options in the first place? A July 2019 report from NPD Group found that 95% of the customers who order faux-meat fast food options aren\u2019t strictly vegan or vegetarian. They\u2019re people who do regularly eat meat\u2014\u201cflexatarian\u201d, if you will\u2014but perhaps are trying to reduce the percentage of red meat in their diets by incorporating more plant-based ingredients.\n\nRead it for yourself. Here\u2019s NBC News. \u201cThe Impossible Burger and Beyond Meat aren\u2019t healthier. Fast food\u2019s meatless marvels are just P.R.\u201d\n\nHow about Fox Business? \u201cPlant-based burgers may not be as healthy as you think.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s hear from Julieanna Hever, a plant-based dietician at CNBC: \u201cThey\u2019re not much healthier than a meat-based burger. I\u2019m concerned about the saturated fat levels as well as the excessive amounts of amino acids.\u201d\n\nThe author offers up four possible reasons people are eating these laboratory experiments if we include the mistaken belief that they are healthier for you. But since you\u2019re usually taking in the same amount of calories or more, plus more salt, that\u2019s kind of out the window. Some may be doing it because it\u2019s a novelty\u2026 something new and cool to talk about. They might also be doing it in the belief that it\u2019s more friendly to the environment, or because of worries over animal welfare in the beef industry.\n\nIf those really are the main drivers of sales, this may turn out to be a fad that doesn\u2019t last very long. If that many people were all that concerned about the impact of the cattle industry on the environment or the conditions the animals are raised under, beef sales would have plummeted long ago.\n\nThe only one that might stick is the stated reason the founders of these companies have been telling us all along. They want to drive the livestock industry out of business and get rid of the cows to save the planet. And if they can make the sale to enough of this emerging fast-food market, we might be in trouble. But somehow I don\u2019t think so. Call me a starry-eyed optimist, but I think people will tire of the novelty quickly enough and realize that they miss eating good old reliable beef, just as nature intended.\n\nAlso, I suspect that more information will eventually get out to the general public about the \u201cheme\u201d that\u2019s used in the manufacturing process and the other substances they produce. I\u2019d be willing to bet that a lot of people eating these burgers are under the impression that \u201cplant-based\u201d just means it\u2019s a new type of veggie burger. But that\u2019s not what this is at all. These burgers are a mad scientist\u2019s chemistry experiment running off the rails. And if all of you out there who are scarfing them down suddenly start growing tails in a couple of months, don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t try to warn you.", "description": "Good question", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/ImpossibleWhopper.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
