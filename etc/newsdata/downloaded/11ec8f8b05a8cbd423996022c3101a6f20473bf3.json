For Emery, it was a chance to lead a revolution at a club which gradually slipped away from Europe\u2019s elite and an opportunity to mastermind their rise back to the top.\n\n\u201cNow is the time for us to turn a new page and look forward with confidence,\u201d Emery declared at his first press conference. \u201cThere\u2019s a special feeling here and we need to recapture this and push this club forward.\u201d\n\n(Image: Arsenal FC via Getty Images)\n\nFast forward 17 months, and for many, the jury is still out on Emery. Monday\u2019s tame draw with Manchester United highlighted the decline of a rivalry which was at the forefront of the Premier League title race not so long ago.\n\nArsenal came within a whisker of returning to Champions League football last season but, ultimately, fell short of their ambitions in Emery's first season in charge.\n\nSo what has changed? Here\u2019s a statistical breakdown of Unai Emery\u2019s tactical revolution at Arsenal and the ways he has tried to change a club which was rooted in Wenger's philosophy.\n\nNew attacking philosophy\n\nWhen Emery took over at Arsenal, he commented on the importance of possession-based football, which became a staple under Wenger.\n\n\u201cArsenal play \u00adpossession football and throughout my career, I\u2019ve \u00adalways been a coach who wants \u00adpossession,\u201d he said.\n\nBut it has become clear Emery values a different type of possession, instead focusing on the intent of passes rather than simply keeping the ball.\n\nThe Spaniard has instilled a new attacking philosophy, introducing club-record signing Nicolas Pepe in a bid to create a front-three which could mirror Liverpool\u2019s fearsome trio.\n\nFeeding Pepe, Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang more directly is now a focus, even if they run the risk of losing possession.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nIn Wenger\u2019s last season in charge, the Gunners averaged 59.06% possession each game, completing nearly 600 accurate passes. Those numbers have dramatically dropped under Emery, with just 531 accurate passes per game last season and just over 500 so far this season.\n\nArsenal currently average 55.53% possession each game - but they have seemingly cut out the short, backwards passes which saw them regularly keep things ticking over and maintain control under Wenger.\n\nFor instance, the Gunners used to pass laterally over 225 times per game under Wenger, and over 80 times backwards. Under Emery, lateral passes are down to just 182 per game, with 73 backwards balls.\n\nInstead, the likes of Aubameyang and Pepe are given more licence to attack their men with the ball at their feet in order to work openings.\n\n(Image: Wyscout SPA)\n\n(Image: Wyscout SPA)\n\nThe result of a more direct approach? Arsenal are averaging over two goals per game and have rarely looked short of goals.\n\nBut many believe the knock-on effect is being left in less control of the tempo of the game, leading to defensive exposure which has failed to conquer their concerns at the back.\n\nDefensive uncertainty\n\nThe main criticism of Unai Emery since taking over at Arsenal comes defensively.\n\nFor years, the Gunners were mocked for their weaknesses at the back under Wenger.\n\nEmery has been unable to change that - but it has not been through the want of trying.\n\nIt is Emery\u2019s efforts to solve their defensive woes which highlights how he is still learning about his side.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nLast season, he opted to play five at the back over the second half of the season, but this campaign, the arrival of David Luiz has seen him revert to a four.\n\nThe result? A more fragile defensive setup, allowing an average of 15.38 shots per game and conceding 1.25 goals. By contrast, Wenger\u2019s Arsenal, in his final season, allowed just under 11 shots per game, conceding slightly fewer goals per game.\n\nThe only consistency in Emery\u2019s defensive philosophy is simple - his players press, but stand off. They allow more passes per defensive action - 11.3 this season and 9.41 in Wenger\u2019s last season - and look to push their attackers into safe areas without jumping in.\n\n(Image: Wyscout SPA)\n\n(Image: Wyscout SPA)\n\nEmery\u2019s side are involved in around 60 defensive duels each game, with Wenger\u2019s Arsenal involved in 70 and showing more success in winning back possession.\n\nIt is clear Emery's side view defending in a different way, focused on carefully-considered pressing rather than jumping in for tackles.\n\nWill this eventually work and solve Arsenal\u2019s defensive problems? We\u2019ll have to wait and see\u2026\n\nTweaking tactics\n\nA key difference between Wenger and Emery appears to be the Spaniard\u2019s desire to tweak his tactics.\n\n\u201cThe system for me isn\u2019t the most important,\u201d Emery has previously stated. \u201cFor me, the most important thing is to be and to create one competitive team. And then, we have the quality.\"\n\nUnder Wenger, the Gunners largely had faith in their philosophy and would not alter their game plan drastically for individual opponents.\n\nIn the 2016/17 season, they lined up in a 4-3-2-1 formation 72% of the time, and it was similar the previous year.\n\n(Image: Wyscout SPA)\n\n(Image: Wyscout SPA)\n\nBy contrast, Emery regularly changed his setup last season, often playing only one of Aubameyang or Lacazette away from home and looking to tailor his plans for what they were up against.\n\nAgainst Manchester United, Emery opted for three defensive-minded midfielders, who largely helped keep their opponents quiet. Against lesser teams, especially at home, he has offered the creativity of Dani Ceballos to give them greater options going forward.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nWenger\u2019s big-game record was often criticised late in his Arsenal career. For Emery, the jury is still out - but tactical tweaks such as against local rivals Tottenham last year have suggested his willingness to change approach on the fly can pay dividends.\n\nVerdict\n\nUnai Emery clearly had a big task to change Arsene Wenger\u2019s deep-rooted Arsenal philosophy.\n\nIn some ways, it appears his own plan is not clear, and a flexible philosophy to adapt to what is put in front of him might well be what Arsenal needs at this moment in time.\n\nResults have been mixed and performances inconsistent, but flashes of Arsenal\u2019s potential under Emery still show cause for optimism.\n\nArsenal fans - and maybe even Emery himself - are learning that change takes time. But they are now beginning to see Emery\u2019s vision take shape as he continues to learn about the club and his players.\n\nA return to Champions League football is the ultimate goal this season, and if that can be achieved during a season of transition, even if not always pretty, it will signal his Arsenal revolution being on track.", "description": "How Unai Emery is changing Arsenal's tactical philosophy nearly 18 months after succeeding Arsene Wenger", "authors": ["Rich Jones", "Image", "Arsenal Fc Via Getty Images", "Pa", "Wyscout Spa", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20329699.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arsenal-Training-Session.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
