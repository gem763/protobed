The source added that those who hoped that German Chancellor Angela Merkel would help London were \u201cdeluded\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis government will not negotiate further so any delay would be totally pointless,\u201d the source was quoted as saying. \u201cWe\u2019ll either leave with no deal on 31 October or there will be an election and then we will leave with no deal.\u201d\n\nAmber Rudd, the former pensions secretary who quit her job and the Conservative party last month over Johnson\u2019s Brexit strategy told BBC radio the source appeared to be his senior adviser, Dominic Cummings.\n\n\u201cIt sounds angry and desperate,\u201d she said. \u201cSince it hasn\u2019t been denied by Number 10 ... one can only assume it\u2019s come from the centre, from the prime minister\u2019s adviser. It reveals that there doesn\u2019t appear an actual plan at all.\u201d\n\nThe source was cited as making it clear that defence and security cooperation will be affected if the EU tries to keep Britain in the EU. The source also said that any EU states that oppose a delay would be granted good cooperation.\n\nJohnson has consistently said the United Kingdom will leave the EU on Oct. 31 with or without a deal, though a law passed by his opponents demands he write a letter to the EU asking for a delay if he cannot strike an exit deal by Oct. 19.\n\nHe said he would abide by the law but Britain would leave the EU by the end of the month without explaining that contradictions. He has also repeatedly demanded an election but parliament has refused to grant one.\n\nThe source quoted by the Spectator appeared to have two views about a delay: that the government could frustrate a delay but that if it was forced to extend Brexit then it would fight an election calling for an immediate no-deal exit.\n\n\u201cOur legal advice is clear that we can do all sorts of things to scupper delay which for obvious reasons we aren\u2019t going into details about,\u201d the Spectator\u2019s source said.\n\n\u201cWe will focus on winning the election on a manifesto of immediately revoking the entire EU legal order without further talks, and then we will leave,\u201d the source was quoted as saying.\n\nThe source said that EU support for a delay would be seen by the British government as hostile interference in domestic politics \u201cand over half of the public will agree with us.\u201d\n\nUnless the European Union compromises and does a Brexit deal shortly, then the United Kingdom will leave without a deal, a senior Downing Street source told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIf the EU doesn\u2019t do a deal shortly, then we leave without a deal,\u201d the source said. \u201cWe are leaving the European Union.\u201d", "description": "Britain will take an aggressive stance towards the European Union if Brexit talks break down, threatening to withhold security cooperation to convince the bloc not to allow any further delay, a British source was quoted as saying.", "authors": ["Guy Faulconbridge", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191008&t=2&i=1438360516&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF970DT", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
