In my opinion no,\" said Gray on beIN SPORT.\n\n\"Mo Salah endangered his well-being when he pushed him over, but there was no foul given there. You cannot say 'did he endanger the well-being of an opponent?'\n\n(Image: PETER POWELL/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\n\"Everyone who does something to an opponent [endangers their well-being].\n\n\"That tackle is not good - it's definitely not good - and he's picked up an injury, and it's unfortunate that he's picked up an injury.\n\n\"But when that happened I bet there were a few Leicester players that said 'Well done son'.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"They were hanging on at 1-1, they had the chance of getting a fantastic result, he [Salah] was breaking away, he probably felt hard done by that they didn't get the free-kick when Salah pushed the kid over.\n\n\"And he's thought 'we didn't get the free-kick' and he's launched at him and you can just see his ankle going under his leg.\"", "description": "The Leicester City midfielder was subjected to disgraceful racist abuse on social media", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Getty Images", "Peter Powell Epa-Efe Rex", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20470831.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Newcastle-United-v-Leicester-City-Carabao-Cup-Second-Round.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
