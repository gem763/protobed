On those kinds of numbers, the Tories might expect a comfortable majority \u2014 enough to pass the Brexit deal the government negotiated with the EU earlier this month.\n\nThe trouble for the Tories is that support in the polls today doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to votes in December. Whether the party can maintain its lead in the next five weeks \u2014 and how that lead will translate into seats \u2014 is far from certain.\n\nThere are several reasons why no one should claim to be able to confidently predict the result of the coming election.\n\nWhile the 2017 election saw the Conservative and Labour parties winning 84 percent of the vote, the latest polls suggest these two parties would now win just over 60 percent of the vote.\n\nFirst, voters are now more likely to switch parties than at any previous point in post-war British history. The British Election Study team has shown that in the last two general elections \u2014 in 2015 and 2017 \u2014 between one-third and two-fifths of voters switched parties between elections.\n\nOften, it\u2019s hard to predict who these switching voters will be. In 2010, the Labour Party counted Scotland as one of its heartlands, for example. In 2015, a very large proportion of its voters switched to the SNP. It\u2019s not guaranteed that the next election will see as many voters switch again \u2014 but over the past four years many voting habits have been broken, and new habits take time to establish.\n\nCurrent polls show a high rate of switching voters. While the 2017 election saw the Conservative and Labour parties winning 84 percent of the vote \u2014 a combined share they had not reached since the \u201cgood old days\u201d of two-party politics \u2014 the latest polls suggest these two parties would now win just over 60 percent of the vote. The remaining 40 percent is taken up by the resurgent Liberal Democrats and a Brexit Party born from the ashes of the U.K. Independence Party.\n\nBecause voters are more willing to switch parties, they\u2019re also likely to be more susceptible to political campaigning. In the 2017 election, the Conservatives had a disastrous campaign: Over six weeks, a 20-point lead dwindled to just 2 points. In Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the Conservatives have found a better campaigner than former Tory leader Theresa May. But as Johnson\u2019s Withdrawal Agreement Bill comes under greater scrutiny in the weeks ahead, he\u2019s likely to find he\u2019s given the opposition plenty of ways in which to attack his plans.\n\nIf it is difficult to say how many votes each party will get on the day of the election, it is even more difficult to say where they will get those votes.\n\nBritons elect their members of parliament in single-member districts where the candidate with the most votes wins the seat. A party can get a large share of the vote but win no seats because that vote is spread evenly across the whole country. This looks to be the fate of the Brexit Party, a party that is polling between 11 percent and 13 percent, but is unlikely to win a single seat.\n\nThis means that forecasting the distribution of votes is critically important to predicting the share of seats each party will get. But again, there are serious difficulties here.\n\nFor most of the post-war period, political scientists have assumed that constituencies behave roughly the same. When a party improves its vote share by 2 percent or 3 percent, its vote share goes up by 2 percent or 3 percent in every constituency. This is something called uniform national swing, or UNS.\n\nUNS has often worked well, but it didn\u2019t work well in 2017. In that election, the Conservatives did much better in areas that voted to leave the EU. Labour did much better in areas which voted to Remain. That trend might continue in 2019, as British party politics reconstitutes itself around Brexit \u2014 or maybe it\u2019ll be back to business as usual.\n\nThe proliferation of polls during the campaign \u2014 and their effect on voter behavior \u2014 will add yet another complicating factor.\n\nUK NATIONAL PARLIAMENT ELECTION POLL OF POLLS\n\nFor more polling data from across Europe visit POLITICO Poll of Polls.\n\nBecause more voters identify with their vote to Leave or Remain than with a political party \u2014 and because no single party captures all of the Leave or Remain vote \u2014 they are likely to vote \u201ctactically,\u201d and look for the party that stands the best chance of winning in their area.\n\nParties will attempt to capitalize on this. The Brexit Party will try to retake Leave voters from the Conservatives. The Liberal Democrats will try to convince Remain voters that Labour\u2019s policy on Brexit merely mimics that of the Conservatives.\n\nVoters tempted by these smaller parties will want to know whether they stand a realistic chance of winning their seat, or whether they should vote tactically for the second-best option.\n\nBecause the last election is a poor guide to what will happen now, seat-level polling or seat models can fill that gap. Some voters will lap up this new information. For others, the result of all this data and rhetoric will be confusion: Estimates of \u201ctactical voting\u201d in previous elections suggest that up to a third of voters make an \u201cincorrect\u201d tactical vote, by voting for their second-best party even when their preferred party stands a better chance of winning.\n\nFar from providing the U.K. with a sense of stability, this new election will introduce yet another source of uncertainty into a political landscape already convulsed by Brexit.\n\nChris Hanretty is a professor of politics at Royal Holloway, University of London.", "description": "The Brexit landscape makes it far from clear Boris Johnson can turn a lead in the polls into more seats.", "authors": ["Chris Hanretty", "Eleni Courea", "Emilio Casalicchio", "David M.
