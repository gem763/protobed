Human hair wigs can be expensive but you can always opt instead for synthetic or fibre hair wigs. It depends on if you want the wig just for fun, a natural look or for a night out.\n\n'If you want a more natural look then you want human hair. You should try different ones on. If you want it for fun or a change of colour, fibre wigs are great.\n\n'I feel like wigs used to look wiggy and were frowned upon, but now there's so many talented people, techniques and brands around. You'd be surprised to find out whose wearing them. I got into wigs because I loved the fact that you could go from black to blonde or short to long without it looking like a wig.\n\n'I've been hairdressing for 13 years and styling wigs for around three to four. Kylie Jenner and Cardie B's wig maker, Tokyo Stylez came to the UK and I did a masterclass with him and ever since then I've been making hair headlines with my celebrity clients. There's been an increase in people wearing wigs because you get the wow factor and it's another part of your outfit. We all love a new lipstick or dress, it's a new hair and another accessory.'\n\nCarl Bembridge: 'For Hayley I wanted to show contrast because she's got naturally blonde hair. I went for a nice brown just to show that you can change your look with a wig.\n\n'It makes you look so different, when going from short to long or blonde to brown. I wanted to show a change in colour can be a quick and easy way to change up your look.\n\nHayleys verdict on Carl Bembridge's wig: 'I think I have an unusually large head for a woman, and a rather large mane to fit underneath it, so having not had a proper fitting which I know is a service Carl provides, the wig felt a little snug, as if it was pulling back from my hairline.\n\n'I thought the parting looked very realistic, and it was fun to see myself with dark hair, having never been brave enough to go brunette. The hair itself was nicely styled, though I struggled to adapt to seeing myself without a fringe!\n\n'There was certainly a lot of hair in this wig \u2013 it came right down to my hips \u2013 so I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d go for this for an everyday look as I feel it would have looked more realistic and been more manageable if it was a little shorter. I also wasn\u2019t as keen on the lighter low-lights.'\n\nPrice: \u00a31000+ (human hair)\n\nEniola who specialises in wigs for hair loss, chose a brown wig with highlights to give Hayley (pictured wearing a wig by Eniola) a sun-kissed look\n\nEniola's advice for buying wigs: 'It depends if you're buying natural hair or synthetics, things to look out for include the lace material and the lace colour.\n\n'Make sure you get a lace that matches your skin tone and isn't too thick. That helps it to blend in with your skin tone.'\n\nEniola of Nuola wigs: 'The style I've chosen for Hayley is an ash blonde wig with highlights to show the diversity in colours that can be worn.\n\n'It's a very modern style that gives her a natural sun-kissed look.'\n\nVerdict on Eniola of Nuola wigs: 'This was closer to my natural colour, but a very different style to my normal hair as, again, it was a severe centre parting with no fringe.\n\n'I was pleasantly surprised once this wig was on, as the ash/silvery tones were more flattering than I expected, however I wasn\u2019t as keen on the grown-out dark roots.\n\n'I also didn\u2019t like how high this one sat \u2013 it was right on my hairline, which I felt accentuated my forehead a bit.\n\n'It felt lighter than the previous wig, due to there being less hair, and I liked the way it was styled, but the ends were a bit thin \u2013 I felt like it needed a good trim!'\n\nPrice: \u00a3600 +\n\nHayley who was styled in a brown wig with dark roots, ordered from Lulla Bellz, said she would be tempted to shop from the budget-friendly online store in the future\n\nOnline store Lulla Bellz, specialises in glamorous hair extensions and lace front wigs.\n\nThe brand which has been operating for the past five years starts prices at around \u00a350 and has thousands of views on YouTube for their wig tutorials.\n\nVerdict on Lulla Bellz wig: 'This one definitely didn\u2019t feel as luxurious as the other two \u2013 the hair was synthetic, and you could tell. I felt like, particularly from a side-on view, it was a bit bulbous on my head.\n\n'Again I wasn\u2019t keen on the colour when it was off, but once it was on I was pleasantly surprised and I think, from more of a distance, it did still look quite realistic.\n\n'Given this is a much cheaper option at \u00a355, I\u2019d be tempted to have a look on the website to see if there are any shorter, choppier brunette wigs, as it would be fun to mix up my style now and again! Though if I was feeling flush, I\u2019d probably give Carl a call!'\n\nPrice: \u00a355\n\nCHLOE\n\nChloe (pictured before) who has naturally blonde hair was given the opportunity to try different shades and lengths using the wigs\n\nChloe (pictured wearing a wig by Carl Bembridge) says she was shocked by Carl Bembridge's fibre hair wig and felt comfortable wearing it\n\nCarl Bembridge: 'I chose this wig for Chloe because I wanted to show how realistic a fibre wig can look. She's naturally blonde but I wanted to change the tone, as we're all curious about going platinum or honey blonde.\n\n'This one is a honey blonde and she's got quite light blonde hair naturally.\n\n'I wanted to show her how different she could look with length. The wig's changed the warmth with just colour and length. It can make her look and feel so different.'\n\nVerdict on Carl Bembridge's wig: 'I was shocked at just how natural and real wig number one felt and looked. I loved the loose wave style as that is what I would normally go for so I felt super comfortable in it.\n\n'I\u2019ve opted for the same blonde highlights for as long as I can remember so it was great seeing what my hair would look like if I\u2019m ever brave enough to take the plunge.\n\n'It\u2019s a much warmer colour for winter and not something I would be opposed to. If I fancied mixing up my look for a special occasion, I would definitely consider this wig.'\n\nPrice: \u00a395+ (fibre hair)\n\nChloe (pictured wearing a wig by Eniola) says although she loved the white blonde colour chosen by Eniola, the length of the hair felt too long\n\nEniola of Nuola wigs: 'I chose Chloe's wig because she already has naturally blonde hair and I thought a different shade of blonde would really suite her.\n\n'I also thought about her blonde hair being mid-length, adding length would add more volume than her natural hair.'\n\nVerdict on Eniola's wig: 'I\u2019ve always been too scared to go a white blonde as my root regrowth comes through quite strong, so this wig was a great way for me to make that transformation in a matter of minutes \u2013 without the pricey maintenance.\n\n'Again, I loved the style but if I was to really tailor it to my preference, I\u2019d cut a few inches off.\n\n'Saying that, I\u2019ve always been disappointed that my hair refuses to grow any longer than shoulder-length, so just like wig one, it did enable me to feel like Rapunzel \u2013 even if just for a few moments!'\n\nPrice: \u00a3675+ (excluding VAT)\n\nChloe (pictured wearing a wig by Lulla Bellz) says that she felt out of her comfort zone wearing a straight style by Lulla Bellz, whose wigs are priced from \u00a350 +\n\nTips for wig maintenance Eniola and Carl (pictured) both recommend treating human hair wigs in the same way as your natural hair Treat human hair wigs like your natural hair, using conditioners and treatments\n\nAvoid using a lot of heat\n\nUse heat protecting spray if using hot styling tools\n\nWigs can last one to two years, depending on how often their worn\n\nDon't sleep wearing wigs as this can make the hair become tangled\n\nPre-styled fibre wigs should be brushed, but don't need to be washed\n\nChloe's verdict on Lulla Bellz wig: 'Unfortunately number three was my least favourite, but that\u2019s purely because I never wear my hair straight.\n\n'I have naturally curly hair which has gradually become wavy over time, so I felt quite out of my comfort zone.\n\n'This wig also felt a lot more wiry than the other more natural-looking two.\n\n'I wouldn\u2019t be surprise if people picked up on the fact this one was a wig, whereas the other two could pass for my real hair.'\n\nPrice: \u00a365\n\nDEBORAH\n\nDeborah (pictured before) whose hair is naturally black, was given a range of colours and lengths to try by each stylist\n\nDeborah (pictured wearing a selection of wigs by Carl Bembridge) says she preferred the black wig Carl chose to the icy bob as it's perfect for everyday\n\nCarl Bembridge: 'I chose this icy wig for Deborah because it's completely different to her natural hair and I wanted to show how crazy and different the looks can be.\n\n'The white icy bob completely changes up her look. I also chose a long black fibre wig to show contrast.'\n\nVerdict on Carl Bembridge's icy wig: 'I love the fit of this wig, however the colour didn\u2019t seem to fit my complexion as well as the other wigs.\n\n'Despite that, the cut and the style of this wig was very complementary to my features. It\u2019s definitely a wig I would opt for during the colder months, because it gives off a winter look.'\n\nVerdict on Carl Bembridge's black wig: 'I loved this wig because it\u2019s straightforward and perfect for an every day wear no matter the season.\n\n'It\u2019s the type of wig that never goes out of style and goes with every outfit.\n\n'However the length was not my favourite and would\u2019ve preferred if it was cut and styled differently however the jet black wig gets a yes from me.'\n\nDeborah (pictured wearing a wig by Eniola) says the wig chosen by Eniola was her favourite as the colour perfectly complimented her complexion\n\nEniola of Nuola wigs: 'For Deborah I chose a brown wig with lots of dimensions in the colours, also face framing highlights.\n\n'I went for some layers in the wigs to give it some bounce and the colouring style is called balayage.'\n\nVerdict on Eniola's wig: 'This wig was by far my favourite one, the colour of the wig and the golden toned highlights went so well with my complexion.\n\n'The length and style was perfect, so I would probably reach for this wig all year round. However, I do see myself wearing this wig more during the summer months.'\n\nVerdict on Lulla Bellz wig: 'I really enjoyed this wig because it\u2019s a complementary colour for every skin tone, so it can be worn all year round, however I would prefer looser curls on the wig but aside from that the length and colour are beautiful.'\n\nPrice: \u00a355\n\nDeborah (pictured wearing a wig by Lulla Bellz) says she would wear the wig by Lulla Bellz all year round, but would prefer looser curls\n\nCelebrity hair stylist Carl Bembridge, has recently launched his own fibre collection in addition to his range of human hair wigs.
