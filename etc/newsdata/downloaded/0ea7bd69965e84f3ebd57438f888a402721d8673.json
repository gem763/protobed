Get a credit card and pay it off right away\n\nThe earlier you can get a credit card, the better, because it helps you establish a strong credit history as soon as possible.\n\n\"But in order to [establish a strong credit history], you need to be really thoughtful about how you're using it and also what credit card you sign up for,\" Jarvis said.\n\nOne important factor that Jarvis advises students to consider when looking at credit cards is the cost.\n\n(MORE: How this 26-year-old paid off $36K of college debt in 20 months)\n\n\"A lot of these companies are going to charge an annual fee, but you don't have to pay that annual fee because there are a number of credit cards that have a zero-dollar,\" she said. \"That means no cost to annual fees, and those are the cards you should be looking for as a college student.\"\n\nJarvis' rule of thumb when it comes to using a credit card while in college: \"You shouldn't spend more than 20% of the limit in a month on your balance ... If the limit on your credit card is $1,000, you shouldn't be putting more than $200 on that credit card.\"\n\nAnother important note to keep in mind: Get into the habit of paying off your full balance every single month.\n\nJarvis suggests that a good way to do this is to set your credit card account to auto-pay.\n\n\"If your objective is to create good credit based on having a credit card, you need to be paying off your credit card every single month to get that good credit,\" Jarvis said.\n\n2. Choose your major wisely\n\n\"The average student is now graduating with almost $30,000 in debt,\" Jarvis said. \"It's important to think about how you're going to be paying that debt off in the future.\"\n\n\"STEM majors -- science, technology, engineering, math -- they tend to be some of the highest paid majors post-graduation, as do business majors,\" she said. \"Humanity majors, on the other hand, don't necessarily have jobs that will ultimately help you pay for that education.\"\n\n(MORE: How one couple paid off $120K debt in under 3 years)\n\nHiring managers have told Jarvis, however, that the most important traits that they look for in candidates are \"a good bedside manner [and] communication.\"\n\n\"Bringing that sound communication to the table, both in person and in writing, will really set you apart,\" Jarvis shared.\n\n3. Consider your fixed costs when creating a budget\n\nLet's face it: budgeting can be difficult when you're simultaneously trying to save for the future and live your best life with your friends.\n\nJarvis strongly urges students to focus on the fixed costs in their daily lives when building a budget.\n\n\"For example, if you're paying rent, if you're paying utilities, if you're paying [for] groceries, these are, generally speaking, fixed costs,\" she said. \"Add them all together and when you know exactly what your spending is, then you know what you have available to either save or spend money on things like entertainment, having fun.\"\n\n(MORE: First-generation college grad shares how she paid off $20,000 debt in 1 year)\n\nAnother pro tip that Jarvis has to offer: Put those fixed expenses on your credit card.\n\n\"If you already know the amount of money that you're spending, it's a great way to start building credit as long as you're paying off the bill every single month in full.\"\n\n4. Complete prerequisites at a community college\n\n\"If you are budget-constrained, a very good thing you could do for yourself is finish some of the introductory courses at a community college,\" Jarvis said. \"Check with your dream school and make sure they will accept those credits.\"\n\nAnother way you can save money is by living at home.\n\n(MORE: Student debt crisis: This 28-year-old mom is 'drowning' in $80,000 of debt)\n\n\"Think about it as, 'I'm going to set a foundation for myself, financially I'll be in a better situation and, in the future, if I do all of these things correctly, I will be able to take even more advantage of spending time in a great college experience, spending time on that first job,'\" Jarvis said.", "description": "The earlier you can get a credit card, the better, because it helps you establish a strong credit history as soon as possible.  \"But in order to [establish a strong credit history], you need to be really thoughtful about how you're using it and also what credit card you sign up for,\" Jarvis", "authors": ["Elisa Tang", "Faith Bernstein", "Chris Cirillo"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ZeDrqAyiDQP4TwrGcweLZg--~B/aD01NTg7dz05OTI7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/gma/us.abcnews.gma.com/CollegeStudentFinance_v01_DP_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
