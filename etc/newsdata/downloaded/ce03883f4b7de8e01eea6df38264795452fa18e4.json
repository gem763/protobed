Someone from Covington\u2019s team proceeded to call police, and Abdelaziz allegedly is scheduled for a court date in the near future.\n\nAbdelaziz will make sure to not get involved in the buildup of this fight that has certainly become personal. He\u2019d rather let Usman (15-1 MMA, 10-0 UFC) handle business.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to give this guy more of my time because he have a problem in his hands,\u201d Abdelaziz said. \u201cHe have a Nigerian nightmare in his hands. They can promote this fight. The reason he\u2019s using my name, I got more Instagram followers than he does. I\u2019m sorry, I do. All he does is try to separate this great, beautiful country. Americans, they don\u2019t do that.\n\n\u201cIf you want to talk bad about me, go ahead. I\u2019m not going to get mad anymore. If I see you again, I\u2019m not going to swing at you because he\u2019s going to do two things: He\u2019s not going to hit back, and he\u2019s going to call the cops. I\u2019m in a lose-lose situation.\u201d\n\nHaving already predicted certain outcomes for his clients, Abdelaziz went on to say that Usman is destined for greatnesss, which will be on display at UFC 245 in his first title defense against Covington.\n\n\u201cI said it before, Henry Cejudo is going to beat Demetrious (Johnson), he\u2019s going to beat T.J. (Dillashaw), everybody said \u2018Oh no, Khabib (Nurmagomedov).\u2019 I said he\u2019s going to beat Conor (McGregor)\u2019s (expletive). \u2018Oh, Conor\u2019s going to knock him out\u2019. I\u2019m saying this today: Kamaru Usman will go down as one of the greatest welterweights of all time.\u201d\n\nYou can watch the Dominance MMA CEO dish on numerous topics in the video above, including Covington, Conor McGregor, Anthony Johnson, fighter unionization, and more.", "description": "Dominance MMA CEO Ali Abdelaziz is going to bat for his fighter in a big way ahead of UFC 245.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "John Morgan", "Mike Bohn", "Christian Stein", "Dave Doyle", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/kamaru-usman-ufc-fight-night-129-1.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
