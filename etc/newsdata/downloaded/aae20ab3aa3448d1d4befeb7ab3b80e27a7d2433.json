REUTERS/ Christian Hartmann NO RESALES. NO ARCHIVES\n\nPARIS (Reuters) - A painting by French post-impressionist painter Paul Gauguin is to be sold in Paris in December in an auction expected to fetch at least 5 million euros ($5.48 million).\n\nThe oil on canvas titled \u201cTe Bourao II\u201d and believed to have been created in 1897 when Gauguin was living in Tahiti, French Polynesia, is one of a series of nine paintings produced by the artist while working on a much larger scale project later titled: \u201cWhere Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?\u201d\n\nThe current owner of \u201cTe Bourao II\u201d, whose name is not public, loaned the painting to the Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York City between 2007 and 2017.\n\nOut of the nine paintings of the Tahiti series, \u201cTe Bourao II\u201d stands as the only work still in private hands, the others hanging on the walls of prestigious museums around the globe.\n\n\u201cI think high-level institutions and art collectors will be interested in this painting. Why? Because there are very few works of Gauguin from his \u2018Tahitian period\u2019 on the market,\u201d Bruno Jaubert, a director with auction house Artcurial, told Reuters.\n\nBorn in Paris in 1848 and gaining in fame after his death in 1903, Gauguin was influential in the symbolist movement as a painter, sculptor and ceramist. He also influenced artists like Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse.", "description": "A painting by French post-impressionist painter Paul Gauguin is to be sold in Paris in December in an auction expected to fetch at least 5 million euros ($5.48 million).", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436719311&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF921ES"}
