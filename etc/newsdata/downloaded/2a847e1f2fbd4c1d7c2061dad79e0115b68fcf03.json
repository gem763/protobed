Here is a story. I looked at it. The bulb we are being forced to use, number one, to me, most importantly, the light\u2019s no good. I always look orange, and so do you. The light is the worst,\u201d the president said.\n\n\u201cFrankly, the light is not as good. We are going to sell that, but we are going to sell incandescent bulbs, and people are happy, it has been amazing,\u201d he continued.\n\nThe regulations, which were set to go into effect in January 2020, were formulated during the Bush administration and implemented under the Obama administration to gradually remove more energy-inefficient halogen and incandescent bulbs from the market and replace them with LED versions.\n\nMr. Trump claimed the incandescent bulbs \u201cworked very well,\u201d alleging the new bulbs were \u201cmore expensive\u201d to make and could be dangerous.\n\n\u201cNumber two, it is many times more expensive than that old incandescent bulb,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you know this, they have warnings. If it breaks, it is considered a hazardous waste \u2014 waste site. It has gases inside. Read what they say. If it breaks, bring it to your local whatever, have it wrapped \u2014 what are we doing?\u201d\n\nMr. Trump is likely referring to fluorescent CFL lights, which contain mercury but have been steadily replaced with the more efficient and safer LED versions.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
