Here are some ways to fight back", "language": "en", "text": "I\u2019ll bet at some point last night you got a robo or spam call. Maybe at Perhaps when you were watching TV or putting the kids to bed.\n\nLand lines, mobile phones, it makes no difference: These calls are so ubiquitous that the Federal Communications Commission cited a study earlier this year estimating that 45% of all calls to cellphones alone this year will be scams.\n\nAnd 90% of those calls will be \u201cspoofing\u201d\u2014when scammers use phone numbers that make it look like you\u2019re getting a local call\u2014thus making you more trusting and likely to give them money or valuable personal information.\n\nBecause scammers seem to operate and adapt faster than lawmakers and regulators who are trying to put them out of business, don\u2019t hold your breath waiting for this problem to go away. Instead, take action. A few weeks ago I asked readers for advice on how to combat this scourge. My inbox filled up immediately. Here are some responses that might help\u2014though some solutions may require a bit of work on your part. I\u2019ve added a few funny ideas at the end.\n\n\u2022 \u201cI created a silent ring tone and made that my default. I then recorded instructions on my voice mail to leave a message if you are a legitimate caller. I assign an audible ring tone to everyone in my contacts. Took a lot of time, but it has been worth it.\u201d \u2014Judy S.\n\n\u2022 \u201cWe have a landline with blocking capabilities. If you have a newer wireless handset phone, read your instructions.\u201d \u2014Arthur P.\n\n\u2022 Clare B. offers the advice I\u2019m always giving: \u201cWhy answer your phone at all? You know the numbers of those near and dear to you, the rest you can get back to when you feel like it. Mostly robot/scammers don\u2019t leave a message, but if they do, delete it as soon as you recognize it for what it is. You won\u2019t have to engage in any conversation ever.\u201d\n\nFor iPhone and Android users\n\n\u2022 If you have a iPhone AAPL, +0.59%, Eric R. says:\n\nIn Settings, select \u201cDo Not Disturb (DND)\u201d\n\nSchedule the DND from 5:02 a.m. to 5 a.m. (basically, 24 hours)\n\nThe trick is to allow calls from \u201cAll Contacts\u201d.\n\nBy allowing calls from \u201cAll Contacts\u201d, only your known contacts will ring.\n\nAll others calls go to voice mail.\n\nNot 100% ideal, but it cuts down on a ton of interruptions and let\u2019s you focus on people you know.\n\n\u2022 If you have an Android GOOG, +0.52% GOOGL, +0.51%, Marc says:\n\n\u201cI keep my Android phone on \u2018Do not disturb.\u2019 This way only phone numbers in my contact list ring. So when it rings, it\u2019s someone i know. Plus I live in North Carolina but still have an Oklahoma area code, so most of the time its easy to see spam since they do not know where I live.\u201d\n\nApps and blocking services\n\nI think by using features on your landlines and cellphones, you can control the problem pretty well. That being said, at least two people recommended each of the following:\n\n\u2022 \u201cI use Nomorobo. Seems to work quite well. Any calls that don\u2019t leave a message, I block.\u201d \u2014Patrick S.\n\n\u2022 \u201cMy favorite app for blocking robocalls on my iPhone is Number Shield, just $0.99 and no subscription.\u201d \u2014David W.\n\n\u2022 \u201cI have used Privacy Star for years. It\u2019s $2.99 a month, but you have unlimited number blocking. It also blocks area codes and has a section for reporting.\u201d -Marc\n\nFinally, want to have some fun with the scammers, or turn the tables?\n\n\u2022 Sam S. gives them a taste of their own medicine: \u201cI answer with \u2018federal fraud division\u2019 or \u2018mortuary,\u2019 he says. \u201cThey hang up quick.\u201d\n\n\u2022 John has a unique solution, though it would probably bug anyone close by: \u201cI bought a small air horn. When I get a call not from my contact list I\u2019ll answer it with the horn. The robo software doesn\u2019t recognize the tone and drops the call. Your number is added to \u201cDon\u2019t bother list\u201d that is shared by scammers. Then I block the number. Went from getting 10 to 15 calls a day to maybe two a week.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Ron\u2019s idea seems extreme: \u201cI answered one by mistake. I told them, \u2018I can\u2019t talk now, police are coming, blood\u2019s all over floor,\u2019 then hang up.\u201d\n\nThanks to all for your terrific feedback.\n\nMy next question for you is on a different subject: If you are in or nearing retirement, what\u2019s the one best piece of financial advice you\u2019ve ever gotten about preparing for it?
