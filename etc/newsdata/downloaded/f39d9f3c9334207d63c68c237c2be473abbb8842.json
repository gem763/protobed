The leadership campaign has so far been defined by candidates' views on Brexit as it will decide who will lead the next attempt to reach a deal \u2014 or not \u2014 for the U.K. to leave the EU.\n\nThe results from the fifth ballot (change from the fourth):\n\nBoris Johnson: 160 (+3)\n\n160 (+3) Jeremy Hunt: 77 (+18)\n\n77 (+18) Michael Gove: 75 (+14, eliminated)\n\nWho's still in:\n\nJeremy Hunt: He serves as May's foreign secretary and is widely considered the favorite as a moderate alternative to Boris Johnson. He believes he can renegotiate May's Brexit deal with the EU to stave off a no-deal Brexit.\n\nHe serves as May's foreign secretary and is widely considered the favorite as a moderate alternative to Boris Johnson. He believes he can renegotiate May's Brexit deal with the EU to stave off a no-deal Brexit. Boris Johnson: He is the clear frontrunner in the race, having previously served as May's foreign secretary and the mayor of London. Known as a leading voice for the 2016 campaign to leave the EU, Johnson has promised he'd leave with or without a deal on Oct. 31 \u2014 but his bombastic, gaffe-ridden nature can be equally appealing and off-putting to certain sectors of the electorate.\n\nWhat's next: The formal leadership campaign between Johnson and Hunt kicks off in earnest on June 22. Registered Conservative Party members will then choose their favorite via a mail-in ballot with the winner set to be announced during the week of July 22.\n\nGiven Johnson's overwhelming lead, it's always possible that Hunt could drop out early in the name of party unity, giving the new government more time to take on Brexit.\n\nGo deeper: Everything you need to know about Brexit", "description": "Boris is the clear favorite in the race.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/7JQw3Cl0_4B6wrABCSn250rYhAo=/0x0:4339x2441/1920x1080/2019/06/10/1560187887668.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-10"}
