Lo with glasses and a big fake mustache, you\u2019re right to be suspicious. The ladies from Hustlers would make a mint playing ABC\u2019s newest game show The Hustler. Hosted by Craig Ferguson, the series reportedly \u201cbreaks the game show mold by featuring one player who secretly knows the answers.\u201d So they obviously have a much easier time winning, right? \u201cDon\u2019t be fooled,\u201d the network says in The Hustler\u2019s press release Monday. \u201cJust because they have a leg up doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll be taking home the prize.\u201d Which leaves us with just one question: what does that mean?\n\nIn case you immediately pictured a super-confusing Homonym!-type comedy of errors like we did, ABC describes the game more in-depth: five contestants must work together to answer trivia questions and accrue a collective prize. One of them, the \u201cHustler,\u201d must hide their identity and anonymously eliminate two fellow contestants, narrowing the pool of possible Hustlers. Once only two contestants and the Hustler are left, the trio must decide who amongst them is the Hustler. If the two non-Hustlers correctly pick the Hustler, the trio splits the prize. If they fail, the Hustler takes home every cent. Will this game actually make sense in practice, or will we all be scammed out of our precious, precious TV watching time? Looks like we\u2019ll have to wait to find out. Production on The Hustler begins this fall.", "description": "Craig Ferguson will host the new ABC game show The Hustler, in which one of the game\u2019s contestants knows the answers to the questions.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/15-Craig-Ferguson.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
