They range from one month each for Felicity Huffman and Peter Jan Sartorio to 15 months each for Stephen Semprevivo and Agustin Huneeus Jr. Ms. Huffman, an actress, is the first to be scheduled for sentencing, on Sept. 13.\n\nFifteen parents have pleaded guilty in the sprawling admissions-fraud case.\n\nThe defendants have their own opportunity to request leniency, filing letters of support to the judge from friends and family.\n\nMs. Huffman\u2019s legal team submitted a memo Friday, saying she is \u201cremorseful\u201d and \u201cashamed,\u201d and that her behavior was \u201ccompletely out of character.\u201d\n\nA lawyer for Mr. Semprevivo, Steven Boozang, had no comment, and a lawyer for Mr. Huneeus didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\n\u201cPerched at the apex of wealth, privilege and, in some instances, fame, these defendants were not content with the distinct advantages they already enjoyed in the admissions process,\u201d said a memo submitted by U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling to the court Friday afternoon.\n\nIn total, 51 individuals have been criminally charged, accused of working with college counselor William \u201cRick\u201d Singer to fraudulently secure spots at top colleges for wealthy teens. Some parents admitted to using Mr. Singer to secure diagnoses of learning disabilities for their kids, allowing them to cheat on SAT or ACT exams with the help of Mr. Singer\u2019s paid proctors. Others bribed coaches or administrators to flag their teens as recruited athletes, regardless of athletic ability. Some participated in both prongs of the scheme.\n\nThe memo, written by Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Rosen and other prosecutors, said parents showed \u201can astonishing degree of self-entitlement and moral insularity\u201d and corrupted the admissions system, shutting out other qualified candidates. Calling home confinement \u201ca penological joke,\u201d prosecutors said jail is \u201ca particularly meaningful response to this kind of offense. For wrongdoing that is predicated on wealth and rationalized by a sense of privilege, incarceration is the only leveler: in prison everyone is treated the same, dressed the same, and intermingled regardless of affluence, position or fame.\u201d\n\nThere is an unusually public dispute between prosecutors and the federal probation office, which advises the court on sentences for defendants. In guilty plea agreements hammered out in recent months, prosecutors tied punishments to financial loss, using the money parents paid to Mr. Singer as a proxy for loss. The government has portrayed colleges, testing agencies and other qualified applicants who didn\u2019t get in as victims.\n\nProbation officials have so far found no direct financial loss, however, for the victims, which could mean parents receive lighter punishments than the government wants. Findings of no financial loss often result in guidelines of zero to six months in prison, which judges often reduce to probation for first-time defenders. A federal judge has called a hearing for Tuesday on the dispute.\n\nFrom the Archives Federal prosecutors charged dozens of people, including actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, in an alleged scheme to help students get admitted to elite colleges under false pretenses.

One reason for the relatively light sentence, they said, is that Ms. Huffman chose not to hire Mr. Singer for a second child, after agreeing to pay $15,000 to participate in the exam-cheating scheme for her older daughter.\n\nMs. Huffman\u2019s legal team asked in a separate legal filing Friday for one year of probation, 250 hours of community service and a fine. They noted that hers was the smallest payment to Mr. Singer and that her daughter had longstanding, legitimate learning disabilities.\n\nProsecutors said repeat usage of Mr. Singer\u2019s illegal services and parents\u2019 efforts to obfuscate their actions, including by paying Mr. Singer in cash, should be considered when determining appropriate sentences for the parents.\n\nProsecutors recommended another parent, Marjorie Klapper, receive four months prison time, also at the bottom of her four-to-10-month range.\n\nMs. Klapper, they say, participated in the scheme for her younger son even after the College Board invalidated her older child\u2019s test score based on the suspicion of cheating, \u201cand after she enlisted Singer in a fraudulent attempt to cover it up.\u201d\n\nProsecutors say she also agreed to falsely represent her son in college applications as a Mexican and African-American first-generation college student.\n\n\u201cIn short, Klapper pursued a more sophisticated cheating scheme that would reduce the odds of detection,\u201d they wrote Friday. Lawyers for Ms. Klapper didn\u2019t immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nProsecutors recommended a sentence of eight months in prison for Gordon Caplan, the former co-chairman of global law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP, who has pleaded guilty to participating in the scheme by paying Mr. Singer $75,000 to fix his daughter\u2019s ACT score. They initially recommended eight to 14 months.\n\nThey said that when the ACT determined it would retract the daughter\u2019s extra-time allowance and cancel her test score, Mr. Caplan retained a lawyer to pressure the agency to release the score.\n\n\u201cAttorneys who flagrantly disregard the law\u2014as underscored by Caplan\u2019s private admission that he was \u2018not worried about the moral issue\u2019 of committing fraud\u2014merit particular sanction,\u201d they said.\n\nAttorneys for Mr. Caplan didn\u2019t immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nMr. Caplan said in April, \u201cMy immediate goal is to focus on making amends for my actions to try to win back the trust and respect of my daughter, my family, and my community.\u201d\n\nWrite to Melissa Korn at melissa.korn@wsj.com and Jennifer Levitz at jennifer.levitz@wsj.com", "description": "Parents in the college-admissions scandal should get prison time, at the low end of guidelines, prosecutors said in a court filing.", "authors": ["Melissa Korn", "Jennifer Levitz", "Melissa.Korn Wsj.Com", "Jennifer.Levitz Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104983/social", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
