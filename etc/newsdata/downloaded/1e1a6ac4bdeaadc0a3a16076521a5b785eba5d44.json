Panel Halts Release of Mueller Documents at DOJ\u2019s Request", "language": "en", "text": "The D.C. Circuit for the U.S. Court of Appeals on Tuesday night halted the scheduled release of grand-jury materials from Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, just hours ahead of the scheduled distribution.\n\nThe decision came after a federal judge ruled last Friday that the Justice Department must release unredacted material from the original Mueller investigation, a move House Democrats have clamored for in the midst of the ongoing impeachment inquiry.\n\nJudge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointee, wrote that the committee \u201chas shown that it needs the grand jury material referenced and cited in the Mueller Report to avoid a possible injustice in the impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\nThe DOJ contested Howell\u2019s ruling and issued an emergency appeal, saying a quick release \u201cthreatens an irreparable loss of grand-jury secrecy before this court even has a chance to act on the Department\u2019s stay motion.\u201d The government also noted that Howell gave no explanation for her seemingly arbitrary deadline of Wednesday, which was not offered by Democrats.\n\nThe three-judge D.C. panel \u2014 made up of judges appointed by Barack Obama \u2014 decided on an administrative stay in order \u201cto give the court sufficient opportunity to consider the emergency motion for stay pending appeal and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits of that motion,\u201d according to the decision.\n\nThe debate centers around the validity of redactions to a grand-jury deposition, which is usually kept secret. The DOJ argues that materials in the report are squarely protected by federal evidence regulations, while others point to ongoing criminal matters involved, including a probe by Connecticut U.S attorney John Durham the origins of the investigation. House Democrats counter that secrecy rules do not apply to the impeachment inquiry, which is a judicial proceeding.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "The D.C.
