The event is part of Georgetown\u2019s \u201cDemocracy in a Digital Age\u201d series.\n\nFacebook\u2019s (FB) new policy for political ads has sparked outrage among the Democratic party. The company has publicly battled with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), after she posted an ad falsely claiming Zuckerberg endorsed President Donald Trump, in order to prove her point.\n\nBanning political ads\n\nWarren argues Facebook has the power to influence elections and affect national debate and by allowing lies in political ads, Facebook is promoting the spread of misinformation and choosing profit over protecting democracy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing people across the spectrum try to define more speech as dangerous because it may lead to political outcomes they see as unacceptable. Some hold the view that since the stakes are now so high, they can no longer trust their fellow citizens with the power to communicate and decide what to believe for themselves,\u201d said Zuckerberg. \u201cI personally believe that this is more dangerous for democracy over the long term than almost any speech.\u201d\n\nZuckerberg told the students he has considered banning all political ads on the social media platform because the controversy isn\u2019t worth it from a financial perspective. But he argued banning political ads would favor incumbents and hurts up-and-coming challengers who might not get significant mainstream media coverage. He made the case that if he wanted to ban political ads, it would still be difficult to figure out how to do that because there are more ads about issues than specific elections.\n\n\u201cDo we ban ads about health care or immigration or women\u2019s empowerment? And if you\u2019re not going to ban those, does it really make sense to give everyone a voice in the political debates except for the candidates themselves?,\u201d said Zuckerberg. \u201cI believe when it\u2019s not absolutely clear what to do, we should err on the side of greater expression.\u201d\n\n\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign has asked Facebook to remove a political ad it says contains false information about Biden. In a statement a Biden spokesperson rejected Zuckerberg\u2019s explanation for the policy.\n\n\u201cFacebook has chosen to sell Americans\u2019 personal data to politicians looking to target them with disproven lies and conspiracy theories, crowding out the voices of working Americans,\u201d said Bill Russo, Deputy Communications Director, Biden for President. \u201cZuckerberg attempted to use the Constitution as a shield for his company\u2019s bottom line, and his choice to cloak Facebook\u2019s policy in a feigned concern for free expression demonstrates how unprepared his company is for this unique moment in our history and how little it has learned over the past few years.\u201d\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg leads a conversation on free expression at Georgetown University on October 17, 2019 in Washington, DC. The event was hosted by the university\u2019s McCourt School of Public Policy and its Institute of Politics and Public Service.

After his prepared remarks, a moderator asked Zuckerberg a few of the student questions. Students were not allowed to ask questions live and reporters were kept from asking Zuckerberg questions.\n\nJohn Scieff, a sophomore at Georgetown, told Yahoo Finance he\u2019s not a Zuckerberg fan and doesn\u2019t really use Facebook, but wanted to be able to tell his children he saw \u201csuch a notable villain\u201d in person.\n\n\u201cFacebook has just become this like massive media platform \u2014 we\u2019ve seen it be used in such horrible ways, to skew the 2016 election and Brexit,\u201d Scieff said.", "description": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg defended his company\u2019s policy to allow politicians to lie in political ads at an event in Washington on Thursday.", "authors": ["Jessica Smith"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ujfmG.fdcmBKNntsW4cjkw--~B/aD00MDAwO3c9NjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/2e4e9ff0-f116-11e9-bfff-0442a6cf5dcf", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
