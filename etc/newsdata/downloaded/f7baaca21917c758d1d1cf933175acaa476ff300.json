One of its components is seen falling away as the missile's third stage, its warhead deployment stage, advances on its westward course.\n\nTrident missiles are fired from surfaced submarines and they shoot into space before fragmenting into multiple separate explosive warheads, which can each fall within 100 yards of their designated target.\n\nThe disbursement of multiple warheads makes it harder for enemy combatants to focus their anti-missile defense systems on a single target, making it more likely the intended target will be destroyed.\n\nThe USS Nebraska submarine - stationed off the coast of southern California - launched at least four Trident II ballistic missiles between September 4-6\n\nAn unarmed Trident II D5 missile launches from the Ohio-class ballistic missile submarine USS Nebraska off the coast of San Diego, California, on September 4\n\nThe D5 is the sixth generation in the Trident submarine-launched ballistic missile series. Each D5 Trident missile costs $30.9 million to make. Currently, they're only deployed on U.S. and UK submarines\n\nThe U.S. has been preparing to field a new version of the Trident II with more targeted, less destructive warheads amid the nation's renewed arms race with Russia.\n\nWhat's unique about this missile is its reduced destructive force, aka yield or yield - designed to make a more targeted impact while delivering nuclear armaments.\n\nThe new missile's depressed, low-altitude flight path may also help it survive potential enemy anti-ballistic missile defense tactics and increase the missile's accuracy at the sacrifice of damage, according to The Drive.\n\nThe D5 is the sixth generation in the Trident submarine-launched ballistic missile series, which was created 60 years ago, according to the U.S. Navy.\n\nEach D5 Trident missile costs $30.9 million to make. Currently, they're only deployed on U.S. and UK submarines, according to the Navy.\n\nNorth Korea and China have also been testing and showcasing their nuclear arsenals in recent weeks.", "description": "A Mexican airbus flight crew shot video from their plane's cockpit as a D5 Trident II Ballistic Missile launched from a submarine flew across the horizon in front of them in September.", "authors": ["Chauncey Alcorn For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/03/19376980-0-image-a-38_1570414113012.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
