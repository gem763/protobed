PRECIOUS-Gold steady ahead of crucial Brexit talks\n\nOct 15 (Reuters) - Gold prices held steady below the $1,500\n\nper ounce level on Tuesday as markets braced for talks between\n\nBritain and the European Union that will determine how smooth\n\nBritain's departure will be from the trading bloc.\n\nFUNDAMENTALS\n\n* Spot gold were flat at $1,492.83 per ounce, as of\n\n0105 GMT. U.S. gold futures GCcv1 were a shade lower at\n\n$1,496.90.\n\n* Asian shares edged higher on hopes that Britain could\n\nclinch a deal to smooth its departure from the European Union\n\nbefore the scheduled date of Oct. 31. MKTS/GLOB\n\n* Officials from Britain and the EU will meet at a\n\nmake-or-break summit on Thursday and Friday that will determine\n\nwhether or not Britain is headed for a so-called no-deal Brexit.\n\n* However, diplomats indicated the bloc wanted more\n\nconcessions from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and said a\n\nfull agreement was unlikely this week. * Dearth of fresh news on U.S.-China trade talks kept\n\nmarkets on the edge.\n\n* U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Monday that\n\nan additional round of tariffs on Chinese imports will likely be\n\nimposed if a trade deal with China has not been reached by\n\nDecember, but added that he expected the agreement to go\n\nthrough. * Late on Friday, the United States outlined the first phase\n\nof a trade deal and suspended this week's scheduled tariff hikes\n\non Chinese goods, but existing tariffs remained in place and\n\nofficials on both sides said much more work was needed before an\n\naccord could be agreed.\n\n* Markets also look for signs the U.S. Federal Reserve will\n\ncut interest rates at its next meeting later in the month.\n\n* Elsewhere, Australia's Newcrest Mining Ltd , the\n\ncountry's biggest gold producer, said on Tuesday it will go\n\nahead with a $685 million first-stage expansion of its flagship\n\nCadia mine in New South Wales. * Zimbabwe expects to increase diamond production to 11\n\nmillion carats by 2023 from 3.2 million carats last year, the\n\nmines minister said on Monday, part of an ambitious plan to\n\nraise mining output and earn the country $12 billion a year.\n\nAHEAD (GMT)\n\n0130 China PPI YY Sept\n\n0130 China CPI YY Sept\n\n0400 Indonesia Trade Balance Sept\n\n0645 France CPI (EU Norm) Final MM, YY Sept\n\n0830 UK Claimant Count Unemployment Change Sept\n\n0830 UK ILO Unemployment Rate Aug\n\n0830 UK Bank of England publishes record of October\n\nFinancial Policy Committee meeting\n\n0900 Germany ZEW Economic Sentiment Oct\n\n0900 Germany ZEW Current Conditions Oct\n\n1800 EU Reserve Assets Total Sept\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold steady ahead of crucial Brexit talks", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEB880JW_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
