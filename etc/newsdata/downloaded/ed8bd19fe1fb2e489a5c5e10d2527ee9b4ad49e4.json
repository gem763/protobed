This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the year Reuters\n\nSimon Peters, an analyst at online trading platform eToro, explained that the recent dip may simply be as a result of a batch of bitcoin futures contracts that were set to expire.\n\n\u201cChicago Mercantile Exchange Bitcoin futures contracts are set to expire tomorrow, which historically has prompted trading activity within the cash market,\" he told The Independent.\n\n\"It\u2019s possible that investors are selling off now to insulate themselves from greater losses in the coming days. Furthermore, this downward momentum has been exacerbated by low trading volumes over the last week, which has meant that a relatively small number of big trades have been able to move the needle sharply.\u201d\n\nSeveral prominent figures within the cryptocurrency community have stood by their previous positive predictions, with cyber security pioneer John McAfee continuing to stand by his bold bet that bitcoin will hit $500,000 in 2020.\n\nSuch a claim seems modest when compared to other historic predictions. Computer scientist Hal Finney, who some believe may be the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto, was perhaps the most bullish about bitcoin\u2019s price potential.\n\nOne week after the first ever genesis block of bitcoin was created in January 2009, Finney published his thoughts on what the value of bitcoin would be if it went on to replace the US dollar as the main global currency.\n\n\u201cImagine that bitcoin is successful and becomes the dominant payment system in use throughout the world,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThen the total value of the currency should be equal to the total value of all the wealth in the world. Current estimates of total worldwide household wealth that I have found range from $100 trillion to $300 trillion. With 20 million [bitcoin], that gives each coin a value of about $10 million.\u201d", "description": "A tumultuous few weeks for bitcoin may be coming to an end after cryptocurrency markets experienced an exceptionally quiet day of trading.
