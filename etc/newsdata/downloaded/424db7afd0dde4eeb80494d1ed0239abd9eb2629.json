Now, he said, \u201cI\u2019m back to holding the phone to my ear, which seems primitive. But, hey, it works.\u201d\n\nAirPods, the $159 wireless headphones from Apple Inc., are sold as an airy, liberating, wire-free experience. But like other modern gadgets, they have for some become an emotional burden and pain in the wallet.\n\nThe devices of modern life deliver connectivity and constant pressure. Smartphones, beyond incessant demands for attention, must be synced, silenced or charged. Careful, don\u2019t drop it! Where\u2019s my phone?!\n\nShare Your Thoughts Do you have an AirPod rescue story?Join the conversation below.\n\nAirPods add to the jitters. The sleek white apostrophes that resemble electric toothbrush heads are slippery, small and easily pop out of ears. Popularity is finally skyrocketing, three years after their launch. So are the losses.\n\nAn Apple spokeswoman said AirPods can be located using the iPhone app, Find my iPhone. Yet knowing where they are isn\u2019t always good enough.\n\nTerri Gerstein will never go back to wearing a tether between her ear and phone. That\u2019s why she fashioned a tool from a broom and duct tape to retrieve one of her AirPods that plunged through a Brooklyn sidewalk grate.\n\nThe pod hunt was successful but left her shaken. \u201cI felt like I don\u2019t deserve them. I\u2019m not careful enough. I don\u2019t deserve something so nice,\u201d said Ms. Gerstein, who directs a workplace-law program at Harvard Law School.\n\nAnna Madison, a 23-year-old server, conducted a salvage operation this year using dental floss and a magnetic Juul electronic cigarette charger.\n\nAnna Madison fashioned a fishing line from dental floss and a magnetic Juul charger to retrieve an AirPod that had slipped through a storm drain. Photo: Anna Madison\n\n\u201cI could see it looking at me, like taunting me,\u201d she said of her fallen AirPod, also trapped beneath a sidewalk grate. Feeling a mix of \u201cstupidity and despair,\u201d Ms. Madison, who lives in Queens, looked up the cost of a single replacement AirPod, $69, and vowed to recover hers.\n\nShe looped a length of floss through holes in the e-cig charger, lowered it into the grate and retrieved the earbud with magnetic force.\n\nSometimes, it takes a village. As many as 25 workers from New York City\u2019s Metropolitan Transportation Authority comb subway tracks for lost objects each weekday. For years, they picked up baby pacifiers, mail, even dentures. Then everybody got AirPods for Christmas.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re tiny. They\u2019re hard to find,\u201d said Steven Dluginski, an MTA maintenance supervisor. Given the darkened tracks where they drop, he said, \u201cthe only saving grace is that they\u2019re white.\u201d\n\nAirPod rescues from New York City subway tracks ramped up in March, when Apple released a new version, Mr. Dluginski said. This summer has been the worst, possibly because the heat and humidity on subway platforms makes the ears and hands of New Yorkers pretty sweaty, he guessed.\n\nThe grabber used by transit workers in New York City to retrieve fallen objects from subway tracks. Photo: Steven Dluginski\n\nTransit workers use a pole that extends to about 8 feet and has two rubber cups on the end that can be squeezed together to grab small objects. The \u201cpicker-upper thing,\u201d Mr. Dluginski called it.\n\nAround noon on a recent Thursday, Mr. Dluginski\u2019s team had received 18 requests to fetch lost items. Six were for AirPods. \u201cIt\u2019s job security, as far as we\u2019re concerned,\u201d the maintenance boss said.\n\nRiders who try to retrieve earbuds from subway tracks can cause annoying delays. Such rogue missions also can be dangerous. The MTA is weighing a public service announcement urging commuters to refrain from taking AirPods on or off while entering or exiting trains, said Sarah Meyer, chief customer officer for New York City\u2019s transit system.\n\nPassenger Ashley Mayer recently live-tweeted a track rescue in a lull between passing trains. One photo, featuring the caption \u201cgame on,\u201d showed her purchasing a broom and duct tape. She used the contraption to nab the AirPod from the tracks, which can be dotted with rats. After cleaning the earbud, she polled Twitter followers about putting it back in her ear. Half said, Sure, go ahead.\n\nApple Chief Tim Cook announced \u201cphenomenal demand\u201d for AirPods during the company\u2019s recent investor call. Apple doesn\u2019t break out profitability for the ear pieces, which are lumped with sales of Apple watches and other wearable accessories.\n\n\u201cWhen you tally up the last four quarters, our wearables business is now bigger than 60% of the companies in the Fortune 500,\u201d Mr. Cook said.\n\nYour loss is their gain. Gene Munster, founding partner at investment and research firm Loup Ventures, estimated that 50 million AirPods would be sold in 2019, up from 28 million last year. A key sales driver is that they are so easy to lose, Mr. Munster said. He has gone through 10 pairs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve already lost the charging case\u201d of his latest set, he said.\n\nDow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Apple services.\n\nMeghan Biernacki hasn\u2019t taken her AirPods out of the charging case since recovering them in July. She had tried to adjust an earbud while watching \u201cThe Price is Right\u201d on a Delta flight, and away it bounced.\n\nAfter the plane landed, a five-person cleaning crew, a flight attendant and a pilot worked to extricate the ear piece from beneath a seat cushion. Ms. Biernacki said it was hidden among candy wrappers, ChapStick tubes and some \u201creally gross stuff.\u201d\n\nOn a flight from Atlanta to New York, Troy Merritt was listening to music on his old-school Bose headphones when an AirPod from a neighboring passenger plopped into his lap.\n\nTwice more the man\u2019s AirPod fell from his ear, prompting the passenger to search on hands and knees during descent, defying orders to stay seated.\n\n\u201cThe look on the guy\u2019s face was pure panic,\u201d Mr. Merritt said.\n\nWrite to Rachel Feintzeig at rachel.feintzeig@wsj.com", "description": "For some, anxiety over losing the wireless earphones clouds the liberating, wire-free experience.
