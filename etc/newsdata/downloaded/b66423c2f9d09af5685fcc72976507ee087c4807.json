Turkish Lira Swats Away Jumbo Rate Cut to Live Another Day\n\n(Bloomberg) -- It almost feels as if Turkey\u2019s can survive anything.\n\nSince the end of June, the currency endured three bigger-than-expected interest-rate cuts, the ouster of the country\u2019s former central bank governor by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and a military incursion into northern Syria that ran the danger of provoking American sanctions.\n\nBut the lira has come through it all more or less unscathed, eking out a 0.3% advance over the second half of the year. That\u2019s pretty much in line with emerging-market currencies as a whole.\n\nWhile it slipped 0.7% to just over 5.77 per dollar on Thursday, it was still close to its strongest level in more than two weeks despite another 250 basis-point interest-rate cut. That reduction took the total since July to 10 percentage points.\n\nErdogan can take credit for some of the currency\u2019s resilience. He managed to persuade the White House to back down from imposing new sanctions on Syria and scrap ones that were already in place, removing a key drag on the currency.\n\nBut other fundamental factors have been instrumental in supporting the lira. The sharp slowdown in Turkish inflation and global investors\u2019 hunger for higher-yielding assets have boosted the currency\u2019s real return and helped it stand out amid the turmoil.\n\nTurkey Surprises With a Big Rate Cut Again as Syria Storm Abates\n\nThat\u2019s why the central bank\u2019s future actions will be key. Thursday\u2019s cut brings Turkey\u2019s interest rate adjusted for inflation to 4.7%, still high relative to other emerging markets. But if it\u2019s reduced much more -- either because of further easing by the central bank or a pickup in inflation -- the lira\u2019s resilience might finally start to wane.", "description": "Turkish Lira Swats Away Jumbo Rate Cut to Live Another Day", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE790C5_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
