But when President Trump asks Ukraine to investigate corruption, the Democrats want to impeach him, the ad continues over footage of House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).\n\nAnd their media lapdogs fall in line, the narrator continues over footage of CNN stars Don Lemon, Chris Cuomo, and Jim Acosta, along with MSNBC primetime host Rachel Maddow.\n\nCNN is rejecting the ad, as it does not meet our advertising standards, a network spokesperson told The Daily Beast. Specifically, in addition to disparaging CNN and its journalists, the ad makes assertions that have been proven demonstrably false by various news outlets, including CNN.\n\nCNN spends all day protecting Joe Biden in their programming, so its not surprising that theyre shielding him from truthful advertising too, and then talking to other media outlets about it, Trump 2020 communications director Tim Murtaugh responded in a statement. Our ad is entirely accurate and was reviewed by counsel, and CNN wouldnt even describe to us what they found objectionable.This isnt a cable news channel anymore, its a Democrat public relations firm.\n\nIn reality, the Ukrainian prosecutor in question, Viktor Shokin, was viewed by multiple international bodies and the Obama administration as deeply ineffective in fighting corruption. The U.S. embassy in 2016 suggested $1 billion in loan guarantees as a way to push the Ukrainian government to enforce stricter anti-corruption policies, including the removal of officials like Shokin.\n\nBiden publicly took credit for the ideaas seen in the clips the Trump campaign now weaponizes in the adbut international organizations like the G7, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) all reportedly wanted Shokin ousted.\n\nThis is not the first time CNN has rejected a Trump ad from airing during its broadcasts. Several months into the Trump presidency, in May 2017, the network refused to air a spot titled 100 Days, which targeted alleged fake news networks, including CNN, for not properly giving the president credit for making America great again.\n\nCNN requested that the advertiser remove the false graphic that says the mainstream media is fake news. The mainstream media is not fake news, and therefore the ad is false, the network said at the time. Per our policy, it will be accepted only if that graphic is deleted.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGet our top stories in your inbox every day.
