The main U.S. stock indexes closed slightly below breakeven as optimism surrounding a partial trade deal between the U.S. and China continued to wane. Boeing (ticker: BA) got a new chairman. WeWork is seeking for new cash after the planned IPO was pushed off. In today\u2019s After the Bell, we...\n\nNot Good Enough\n\nStocks were largely flat on Monday, as the market\u2019s reaction to a partial trade deal\u2014touted by President Donald Trump last Friday\u2014stayed lukewarm. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 29.23 points, or 0.11%, to close at 26787.36. The S&P 500 lost 4.12 points, or 0.14%, to finish at 2966.15, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 8.39 points, or 0.10%, to close at 8048.65.\n\nDespite an upbeat meeting with China\u2019s top trade negotiator and the announcement of a \u201cphase one\u201d trade agreement, investors still have many questions unanswered, and many concerns unresolved.\n\nThe new agreement reportedly involved China\u2019s commitments on its currency, financial services, intellectual property practices, as well as purchases of American farm products. In return, the U.S. won\u2019t increase the tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese imports from 25% to 30% this week.\n\nStill, the details of the deal haven\u2019t been hammered out yet, the key structural issues remained off the table, existing tariffs on billions worth of goods are still in effect, and China doesn\u2019t have a good record of following its promises. After all, Chinese media didn\u2019t refer to last week\u2019s negotiation as a \u201cdeal\u201d to \u201cavoid fueling expectations too fast, too soon,\u201d wrote Ipek Ozkardeskaya of London Capital Group in a Monday note.\n\nEditor's Choice\n\n\u201cThe progress in US-China trade negotiations should improve the investor sentiment across the board. But given how fast the wind can change direction, investors will likely prevent from crying victory too soon,\u201d wrote Ozkardeskaya.\n\nBut one thing is clear: The U.S.-China trade tensions have continued to take a toll on Chinese trade data. Chinese exports fell 3.2% in September from the same period last year, coming well below the consensus of a 2.8% decline and the 1.0% drop in August. This marks a contraction for the fifth straight month. Shipments to the U. S.\u2014the main driver of the decline\u2014fell 21.9% in September. Total imports fell an even sharper 8.5%, as compared to the 5.6% decline in the prior month and economists\u2019 consensus for a 6.0% drop. \u201cIf Beijing wants to blow off some steam, it should do its best to sign a partial and even a comprehensive trade deal with the U.S.,\u201d wrote Ozkardeskaya.\n\nDespite the many uncertainties around the \u201cmini deal,\u201d investors may shift their focus to Corporate America for some time, as U.S. companies kick off the third-quarter earnings season this week.\n\nMajor banks will announce their results in the coming days, including JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs Group (GS), Citigroup (C), and Wells Fargo (WFC) on Tuesday, Bank of America (BAC) on Wednesday, and Morgan Stanley (MS) on Thursday. As the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates for a third time by the end of October, banks\u2019 income will likely stay under pressure. Investors will focus on their ability to manage operating costs and stay disciplined in a low-rate environment.\n\nInvestors will also watch earnings from Netflix (NFLX), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), International Business Machines (IBM), Philip Morris International (PM), and Coca-Cola (KO) this week.\n\nWrite to Evie Liu at evie.liu@barrons.com", "description": "The main U.S. stock indexes closed slightly below breakeven as optimism surrounding a partial trade deal between the U.S. and China continued to wane.", "authors": ["Evie Liu"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-72094/social", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
