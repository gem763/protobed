In her 2017 short fiction collection Only the Animals, Ceridwen Dovey took inspiration from a true story about a bear at the Sarajevo zoo, which had been abandoned by zookeepers amid the city\u2019s long and bloody siege during the Balkan Wars. The zoo was littered with the corpses of giraffes and big cats, but the bear had survived due to the efforts of a former bank-teller who dashed through the night to feed him. Dovey told that story from the perspective of the bear, who in turn tells a visiting human witch the story of his marriage. One day, the witch asks him about that bear he\u2019d loved. \u201cI can\u2019t remember,\u201d the bear replies, while \u201csucking contemplatively on the brown bear\u2019s thighbone.\u201d He\u2019d eaten his cage-mate, having forgotten that she was his wife.\n\nLike the trapped humans of Sarajevo, the bear and his co-prisoners slip one notch down the scale of \u201ccivilization,\u201d and turn on one another. Their fates presage those of their human keepers\u2014we\u2019re fools to think we\u2019re any smarter. Dovey grants her animal narrators speech with a twist of magic that calls to mind every other unheard voice from history: children, women, and those otherwise silenced by louder people\u2019s wars.\n\nThe camel in Inland is the subject addressed by one of the novel\u2019s two main characters, Lurie, a wayward orphan of apparently Serbian origin living in the Southwest. The reader doesn\u2019t know the \u201cyou\u201d Lurie has been talking to is a camel named Burke until the novel is well underway.
