(TSXV:GPM) (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cGPM\u201d) provides an update to its Walker Gossan Project, Arnhem Land, Australia.\n\nGPM Metals is pleased to announce that the company has completed the field work program on Exploration License (EL) 24305 & 385 that was proposed to the Northern Land Council (NLC) and The Traditional Owners of the land at the meeting held at Gapuwiyak on the 13th May 2019.\n\nGPM personnel mobilized and set a camp at EL 24305 on 10 September 2019 and conducted a two week mapping and sampling program. Peter Mullens, CEO; and Greg Duncan, Australian Manager were both present during this field program. Two community members of the Local Traditional Landowners were also present as monitors. This work confirmed the belief that GPM during its 2016 drill program drilled into a large iron rich zone within dolomitic sediments which potentially forms the siderite rich outer halo to a large \u201cSEDEX style\u201d base metal deposit.\n\nGPM will further review this field work before planning further field work and discussing the results with the NLC and The Local Traditional landowners.\n\nThe Project is the subject of farm-in and joint venture agreement between GPM (and its Australian subsidiary) and Rio Tinto Exploration Pty Limited(\u201cRTX\u201d) executed in January 2014, pursuant to which GPM can earn a 75% interest in the Project through meeting staged exploration expenditure requirements. The Project tenure is held by RTX with GPM acting as the operator and manager of exploration, community relations and title grant (see January 27, 2014 press release of the Company available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com ).\n\nTitle Deed, Work Program and Exploration License (EL 24305) approval was granted in November 2015 by the NLC after a series of meetings and consultations with the TLO\u2019s and GPM Metals in Numbulwar and Darwin.\n\nThe Project lies within one of the great metallogenic provinces of the world, the North Australian Zinc Province (NAZP); which currently provides 30% of the world zinc production from a number of significant silver, lead, zinc deposits; including the Mt. Isa, George Fisher, McArthur River and Century Mines.\n\nThe exploration target is a large, strata bound, sediment hosted lead \u2013 zinc deposit. Field work planned for 2019 will consist of geological mapping, geochemical sampling and prospecting with the view of identifying vectors towards the center of the mineralized system. To date GPM geologists believe they previously identified and drilled into the iron rich, siderite, outer halo to potentially a major mineralized strata bound Lead Zinc deposit.\n\nAbout GPM Metals Inc.\n\nGPM Metals is a zinc focused exploration company with offices in Toronto and Brisbane.\n\nThe Company\u2019s current holdings include the district scale Walker Gossan Project, NT, Australia, a joint venture with Rio Tinto Exploration Pty Limited.\n\nThe Walker Gossan exploration properties have considerable potential to host significant zinc resources.\n\nAll scientific and technical information in this press release has been prepared under the supervision of Dan Noone, (Chairman of GPM), a \u201cqualified person\u201d within the meaning of National Instrument 43-101. Mr. Noone (B.Sc Geology, MBA) is a member of the Australian Institute of Geoscientists.\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\n\nFor further information contact:\n\nGPM Metals Inc.\n\nPeter Mullens, CEO\n\nSuite 1101 \u2013 141 Adelaide Street West,\n\nToronto, Ontario M5H 3L5\n\nTelephone : + 416 628-5904\n\nEmail: info@gpmmetals.ca\n\nForward Looking Statements\n\nThis news release contains certain forward-looking information and statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws.
