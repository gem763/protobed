Really not cool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s their choice if they wanna stick beak up their nose, but why would someone use that as a snorting table?\n\n\u2018It\u2019s beyond belief.\u2019\n\nChris had gone to the pub to treat his friend Ben to a birthday breakfast (MEN Media)\n\nChris, who runs furniture removal firm Second Time Round, suspects the note had been left on Friday night.\n\nHe said: \u2018They [staff] ain\u2019t cleaned it otherwise cash would have been gone.\n\n\u2018Someone said to me before \u2018name and shame\u2019 the pub, but how can you blame the pub?\n\n\u2018It\u2019s the idiot who did it to be honest, unless it\u2019s been there all night, then it\u2019s their issue as well then.\n\n\u2018With a bit of luck the little b****** might see [the story] and rethink.\n\n\u2018A Wetherspoon\u2019s baby changing table is not the place to be doing lines of coke folks.\u2019\n\nAs soon as he walked in the disabled toilet, he noticed the rolled-up \u00a320 note (MEN Media)\n\nHomeless charity volunteer Chris admits he kept the money to pay for his breakfast, adding: \u2018Sorry, no angel-like charity thing, but I do enough of that stuff as is well known.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m human all the same. Half the notes in circulation are known to carry traces of coke these days.\u2019\n\nA Wetherspoon spokesperson said: \u2018We apologise to the gentleman concerned.\n\n\u2018Wetherspoon has zero tolerance to the use of drugs in its pubs.\n\n\u2018It is impossible to monitor what goes on in a toilet cubicle once the door has been locked.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018However, we fully appreciate that the discovery of cocaine in the toilet is unacceptable.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
