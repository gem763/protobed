But if anyone has any grand plans to take the Best Costume crown later this week, you might already be too late thanks to one intrepid bloke and the gentle art of karaoke.\n\nAnyone who\u2019s ever been near a K-Box or a Ding Dong Dang will undoubtedly be at least tangentially familiar with the Sunfly Karaoke Bug, the cursed blue bug doomed to wander in a constant mid-song state with both arms contorted horribly into crude arcs.\n\nBloated, rotund belly shoved outwards in clear distress, mouth wailing in pain into whatever half-baked version of a microphone he was given. The Sunfly Bug is unwell, frozen in time, and in dire need of assistance.\n\nSo you bet your ass someone dressed up as it for Halloween and it rules.\n\nREAD MORE Sorry To All Other Costumes 'Cuz Everyone Was Billie Eilish This Halloween\n\nUS comedian Chris Stephens posted his bang-on bug homage onto Twitter, much to the delight of anyone who has tinny MIDI drums beating away in their soul or strangely incorrect subtitled lyrics running through their head.\n\nIf I have any qualms at all \u2013 and really, they\u2019re minor \u2013 it\u2019s that there\u2019s simply not enough hip-thrusting in the posed picture. All Sunfly Bug poses must be at full thrust, feet barely keeping contact with the earth. The power of the awful, off-key karaoke track propelling you forward. The key change flinging you violently off-balance.\n\nBelieve it or not, Stephens appears to have been not the only Sunfly Karaoke Bug getting about on that same very night.\n\nMore social media posts reveal the existence of at least one other bug. This one at an actual karaoke bar performing actual karaoke.\n\nomg walked into karaoke bar and sunfly himself was on stage pic.twitter.com/aer0knkJPp \u2014 KYK (@kristenyoonsoo) October 27, 2019\n\nAll praise be to the Sunfly Karaoke Bug: The awful bug who loves to sing.", "description": "The race for Best - or maybe Deepest Cut - Halloween Costume may be done already thanks to one bloke and a Sunfly Karaoke Bug homage.", "authors": ["Cam Tyeson"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/sunfly-costume.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
