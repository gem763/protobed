(Our first impression is that you should wait to buy one, for one very specific reason.) Automotive outlets have generally been positive, but they\u2019re bound by at least a semblance of journalistic ethics. The public, or at least the social-media-using public, are not bound by such constraints.\n\nWhen it comes to the consumers who will ultimately decide whether or not the 2020 Defender lives up to its name (and is worth purchasing), the response has run the gamut from elated to gutted, to borrow a phrase from the British.\n\nOf course, almost all of the people commenting on Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, etc. haven\u2019t driven the new Defender yet. And chances are many of them haven\u2019t read through the all the specs yet (though, to be fair, there\u2019s a lot to digest). Much of the initial response is about one thing: the exterior design. While that might seem superficial in other cases, we aren\u2019t talking about books here. We\u2019re talking about automobiles, which live and die by their lines \u2014 and the redesigned Defender, more than most modern vehicles, had a greater chance of dying.\n\nAs Adventure Journal rightly puts it, \u201cThe looks of this new one will be polarizing. No matter what Land Rover did, they would be.\u201d That\u2019s because over the lifetime of the vehicle \u2014 which went uninterrupted from the first Land Rover Series model in 1948 to the supposed end of the Defender in 2016 \u2014 it was more or less the same. It was two boxes stuck together. It was a squarish, battle-hardened, off-road legend. It was solid axles and body-on-frame brutishness. Now, it\u2019s softer around the edges, more technologically advanced, and more like other modern SUVs.\n\nThose changes have led to many, many unflattering comparisons, like the Fiat 500X \u2026\n\nMaybe I've had too many pumpkin-spiced lattes but does the #Defender look a little bit\u2026 Fiat 500-y? \ud83d\ude48 pic.twitter.com/B1w1WB7Q3K \u2014 Becky (@BeckyyAdele) September 10, 2019\n\n\u2026 and the Honda Element \u2026\n\nReally @LandRover? THIS is the best #Defender you could come up with after all this time!?!?! pic.twitter.com/DUmgEaPNqX \u2014 Sam Herren (@realSamHerren) September 10, 2019\n\n\u2026 and, well, the original.\n\nWell Land Rover, this is the 8th Land Rover 90/110/defender we\u2019ve owned and will likely be the last. That new thing you have produced will be no good for what I do and the prices are insane \ud83e\udd23 #newdefender pic.twitter.com/k2Jg2Jq0Uc \u2014 The Phoenix (@The_Phoenixbird) September 10, 2019\n\nThis is just a sampling of the curmudgeons you\u2019ll find out there, but they\u2019re all misguided \u2026 and months late. While this is the first time we\u2019ve officially seen the design of the new Defender, we basically knew what it was going to look like from the first camouflaged model.\n\n\n\nDays after Santa came down the chimney in 2018, Land Rover announced the Defender would be sold in the U.S. and teased us with a model in disguise. Even in those photos, you can tell it was going to be closer to a Discovery or Range Rover than a Series II. But those who were really paying attention knew it even earlier, when the automaker announced it\u2019d be redesigning the vehicle.\n\nThe dissidents \u2014 and I\u2019m talking about the people who legitimately want to go back to the old-school design, not people who are just looking for likes and retweets \u2014 are simply people who have no respect for history and automotive development. Do you remember why the Defender left the North American market after 1997? It\u2019s because our country started requiring certain safety features \u2014 like, uh, front airbags for the driver and passenger \u2014 and the Defender apparently couldn\u2019t meet them without a major redesign. Well, now we\u2019ve got a major redesign, and it\u2019s much, much safer for most drivers. Admittedly, we haven\u2019t personally done bomb tests to compare the models.\n\nIf you want the new Defender to look like the old one, just add a lot of accessories. (Land Rover)\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that Land Rover is shielded from all criticism. There are plenty of reasons to be skeptical of the continuation of the Defender name, not least of which is the fact that production has moved from the long-time Solihull factory in England to Slovakia. And its off-road chops will certainly come under scrutiny once third parties have a chance to test it out. (For what it\u2019s worth, as Consumer Reports wrote in its initial review, \u201cIn some ways the Defender doesn\u2019t have any competition, particularly when its off-road capabilities are taken into consideration.\u201d) But when it comes to design, you can\u2019t fault the company for combining heritage with common sense.\n\nGerry McGovern, Chief Design Officer at Land Rover, puts it this way in the press release, \u201cThe new Defender is respectful of its past but is not harnessed by it.\u201d You can clearly tell this is a Defender, but their focus was making an off-road-capable vehicle that would appeal to drivers around the globe, not paying homage to a dead design.\n\nAll that to say, while much of the design criticism is unwarranted, we do understand it. At its core, the Defender is an icon for Brits, just as, say, the Corvette is for Americans.\n\nThat\u2019s why there was so much fanfare when the C8 Corvette made its debut. Despite being radically different from its predecessors \u2014 the first mid-engine Corvette \u2014 it was something new, something radical, something to be proud of again. So if there are Brits still lumbering around the countryside in Defenders and Series Land Rovers who take offense at the gentrification, or globalization, of what they see as a national symbol, we\u2019re not going to begrudge them.\n\nAs for all the trolls who\u2019ve never stepped foot in an old-school Defender, sorry, but Land Rover wins this round.", "description": "The brand new, redesigned 2020 Land Rover Defender was unveiled Tuesday.
