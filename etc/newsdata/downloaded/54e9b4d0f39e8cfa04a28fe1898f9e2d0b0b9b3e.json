Which small task would you outsource?\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that being the Queen is very time-consuming, so much so that her official dressmaker \u2013 she has revealed in a new book \u2013 wears in the monarch\u2019s new shoes for her. \u201cThe Queen has very little time to herself and no time to wear in her own shoes, and as we share the same shoe size it makes the most sense this way,\u201d she writes. What small tasks would people love to outsource to add hours back into their week and make their lives easier? We took to the streets to find out.\n\nRyan Hand, 32, presenter and DJ\n\nI hate emptying the bins. They stink, absolutely stink. Making the bed, too, because my girlfriend leaves the house before me, so it\u2019s up to me to do it every single morning. I really carry the household.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Marie Brice.

At the end of the evening, when I\u2019m tired, it\u2019s just such a faff standing there trying to get them out.\n\nJack Sheard, 26, PhD student\n\nSomeone making my coffee for me would be nice. If I make four big cups each day it takes up an hour. Also, small talk. Someone else to do that for me would be great.\n\nBen Gordon, 41, advertising consultant\n\nI would love not having the stress of doing the school run in the mornings. In fact, while we\u2019re at it, the commute in general could go.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jess Cole.

I work 12-hour shifts and have to take a train, two tubes and a bus to get to work \u2013 on a good day, I\u2019ll get four hours sleep. When I get home, my food prep takes up an hour and a half to two hours of my time, as I like to make healthy meals and enough for the next day, too.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hanan Sultan.

I\u2019ve got a lot of hair \u2013 at the moment it comes down to my lower back, but it used to reach my thighs.\n\nVeronica Quinzi, 24, chef\n\nI\u2019m a chef, so the last thing I want to do when I get home is to cook for myself. I would love to come home after a morning shift to find food ready for me and be able to just sit, relax and enjoy it.\n\nClara Kane, 31, events co-ordinator\n\nIt would be good if I could get someone to come around with me and take notes of people\u2019s names because I\u2019m always forgetting them.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest David Milward.

I would also like someone to remind me to put trousers on every day because I have an irrational fear of leaving the house without them on.\n\nNeil Leitch, 65, CEO of a children\u2019s charity\n\nI don\u2019t think I would outsource anything \u2013 if it\u2019s important enough for someone else to do, then I can do it myself.", "description": "Elizabeth II has her dressmaker help soften her shoe leather.
