Many shouted, \u201cResign!\u201d\n\nAs protesters on the streets outside Parliament denounced a \u201ccoup,\u201d the lawmakers turned to a key piece of legislation that would prevent an immediate no-deal Brexit. If it passes this week, Johnson\u2019s Downing Street office said he\u2019ll call an early election \u2014 taking his argument directly to the people for a third general election in four years.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThe country wants this done and they want the referendum respected. We are negotiating a deal and I am confident of getting a deal.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s tenuous position became clear even as spoke in Parliament for the first time since it reconvened. Lawmaker Phillip Lee rose from his chair on the Conservative benches and sat down with the Liberal Democrats, a defection that meant Johnson lost his slim working majority.\n\nThat makes Johnson vulnerable should lawmakers opt to try to oust him in a vote of no confidence and will complicate passage of legislation.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, two other prominent Conservatives signaled their intention not to seek re-election rather than bend to Johnson\u2019s will. Former Cabinet minister Justine Greening and former Foreign Office Minister Alistair Burt also signaled their intention to stand down.\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the main opposition Labour Party, lambasted the weakened Johnson, accusing him of \u201criding roughshod\u201d over the constitution in order to crash Britain out of the EU without a deal.\n\n\u201cHe isn\u2019t winning friends in Europe. He\u2019s losing friends at home. His is a government with no mandate, no morals and, as of today, no majority,\u201d Corbyn said.\n\nJohnson, who became prime minister in July, has tried to crack down on members of his Conservative Party who oppose his Brexit plans, warning they would be expelled from the party if they supported parliamentary efforts to block or delay the withdrawal.\n\nDominic Grieve, who was attorney general in David Cameron\u2019s government, says the expulsion threats demonstrate Johnson\u2019s \u201cruthlessness.\u201d Greening said she feared her beloved party was \u201cmorphing into Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party.\u201d\n\nFormer Treasury chief Philip Hammond warned of the \u201cfight of a lifetime\u201d if officials tried to prevent him from running in the next election.\n\nAll three oppose Johnson, with Hammond saying he expected a procedural motion to take control of business. If it passed, a vote to block a no-deal would be considered Wednesday.\n\nChanging the government would not be so simple, however. A no-confidence vote would spark a 14-day period in which Johnson could try to overturn the result. If he failed, there would be a general election.\n\nDuring that key 14-day period, another lawmaker could try to win Parliament\u2019s backing in a vote. If they succeeded, Johnson should, in theory, have to step down and let the winner form a government.\n\nBut these rules were introduced in a 2011 law and have never been tested.\n\nAs Brexit faces crucial days, international investors are showing concern. The pound sterling fell as low as $1.1960 on Tuesday, down about a cent on the day before, stabilizing around $1.1990.\n\nThat was its lowest level since a \u201cflash crash\u201d in October 2016, when uncertainty after the Brexit referendum was particularly high. Not counting that brief plunge \u2014 in which the currency fell to $1.1789 for about two minutes before recovering \u2014 the pound is now at its lowest level in 34 years.\n\nA no-deal Brexit is considered dangerous because it will sever decades of seamless trade with Europe\u2019s single market of 500 million people. Economists warn that trade would be disrupted by tariffs and customs checks between Britain and the bloc. Leaked government documents predicted disruptions to the supply of drugs and medicine, a decrease in the availability of fresh food and even potential fresh water shortages because of disruption to supplies of water treatment chemicals.\n\nJohnson insists the potential for leaving without a deal must remain as a bargaining chip in negotiations with the EU.\n\nThough the EU is Britain\u2019s biggest trading partner, a no-deal Brexit would also be disruptive to Europe \u2014 a fact not lost on Brussels. Johnson\u2019s supporters said lawmakers were weakening the government\u2019s negotiating position with the EU.\n\n\u201cThe one thing that has helped focus minds in the EU is that we\u2019re leaving come what may and we\u2019ve got a very focused task of what a good deal would look like,\u201d Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told ITV. \u201cBut the lingering doubt they\u2019ve got is: Will the shenanigans in Parliament somehow lead to the cancellation or the delay of Brexit?\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s encouraging them, and weakening our position to actually get the deal we all want.\u201d\n\nThe bloc is adamant it will not renegotiate the agreement struck with former Prime Minister Theresa May, which Johnson considers unacceptable.\n\nJohnson has told French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel he could come up with a better alternative to the main sticking point in the stalled Brexit negotiations \u2014 the deadlock on the Irish border question.\n\nBut with the clock ticking, the EU said Tuesday it had received no proposals from the British government aimed at overcoming the impasse in Brexit talks.\n\nEuropean Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said the EU\u2019s executive body, which supervises Brexit negotiations on behalf of Britain\u2019s 27 European partners, is operating on the \u201cworking assumption\u201d that Britain will leave the bloc on Oct. 31.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press Writer Lorne Cook contributed.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson suffered key defections from his party Tuesday, losing a working majority in Parliament and weakening his position as he tried to prevent lawmakers from blocking his Brexit plans.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Danica Kirka"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/03/Britain_Brexit_35659.jpg-7794f_c0-0-3500-2040_s1770x1032.jpg?b0161dc565e13cabf46548a71443391c628067cb"}
