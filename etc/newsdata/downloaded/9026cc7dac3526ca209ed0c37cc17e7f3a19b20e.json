The cup did not stay in place, and the coffee spilled onto the pilot\u2019s lap and on the audio control panels.\n\nAn image from the AAIB report shows the two audio control panels (ACP) that were damaged in the spill (Screenshot: Air Accidents Investigation Branch)\n\nThe spill \u201cresulted in immediate malfunction.\u201d And about 40 minutes after the spill, one audio control \u201cunit became very hot and failed and there was an electrical burning smell in the cockpit,\u201d according to the report.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later the audio control unit on the co-pilot side \u201cbecame hot enough to start melting one of its buttons, and failed\u201d and a \u201csmall amount of smoke was observed coming from\u201d the control unit that had failed first.\n\nAt that point, the pilot made the decision to divert the flight to Ireland. The flight crew used supplementary oxygen for the rest of the flight, and the pilots had difficulty sending or receiving transmissions due to the audio control panels being damaged.\n\n\u201cFlight DE2116 from Frankfurt to Cancun on February 6, 2019, diverted to Shannon airport as a precautionary measure due to a minor amount of smoke in the cockpit after a liquid spillage,\u201d a Condor spokesperson told Gizmodo, in a statement. \u201cAfter the aircraft was fully inspected and repaired by our team of engineers, the flight continued via Manchester due to the legal operating hours of the crew. As safety is always our top priority, we have comprehensively investigated this incident and reviewed the procedures of liquids in the cockpit.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson continued, \u201cOur crews were reminded of careful handling as well as to use appropriate containers for their water or coffee.\u201d", "description": "An aeroplane flying across the Atlantic Ocean had to reroute after a pilot spilled his coffee in the cockpit and damaged the audio control panel....", "authors": ["Chris Jager", "James Whitbrook"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/bo5t7tyedvqmzq8fd5ed.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
