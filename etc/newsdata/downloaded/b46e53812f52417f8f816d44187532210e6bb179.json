Threats of violence against political leaders have absolutely no place in our democracy.\u201d\n\nScheer is Trudeau\u2019s main rival in the federal election on 21 October and the two are in a statistical tie nationally, according to polls. But the left-leaning New Democratic party is gaining and could end up with the balance of power.\n\nThe NDP leader, Jagmeet Singh, said: \u201cAny threat made against Justin Trudeau, or any leader, is troubling to all of us. No matter how you vote or believe, no one should face threats of violence.\u201d\n\nTrudeau was going ahead with plans to campaign in York, Ontario, on Sunday, said a Liberal official who declined to be named.\n\nAt the Saturday rally, Trudeau still plunged into the crowd to shake hands and pose for photos as he usually does, but unlike in the past he was surrounded by bodyguards wearing large backpacks.", "description": "Canadian PM forced to wear bulletproof vest at campaign rally after security fears", "authors": ["Moustafa Bayoumi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef4fd0a6095a26ee692c1c6655ab63e805e4e4da/329_0_2784_1670/master/2784.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6d137207f79724954eba0f0dc5a4b956", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
