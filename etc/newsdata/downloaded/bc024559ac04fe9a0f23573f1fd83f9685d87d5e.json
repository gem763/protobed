Mr. Obama either knew about everything going on around him or at the very least created an atmosphere that enabled unelected officials to run amok and destroy the fundamentals of our democracy.\n\nThe Democrats are pushing for all correspondence from the Trump administration but nothing has been said about Mr. Obama. What did he know and when? Also, how about the failure to take action when wrongdoing was uncovered (the IRS and Department of Justice scandals), which set the stage for future unchecked lawlessness?\n\nIt is looking more probable that the Obama legacy is going to be one of unbridled use of political power to the detriment of the American society. The mainstream media will undoubtedly cover up the truth, and the left will continue to reinterpret history and paint Mr. Obama as a mythical god.\n\nTHOMAS WINTHROP\n\nFairfax, Va.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
