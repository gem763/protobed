Morey apologized, as did Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta and star player James Harden. Other basketball stars, like Stephen Curry and Giannis Antetokounmpo, have avoided making political statements when commenting on the situation.\n\nThe NBA has spent decades cultivating an audience among China\u2019s nearly 1.4 billion citizens. Several Chinese businesses, including the state television network, have said they\u2019re suspending their relationships with the Rockets in response to Morey\u2019s tweet.\n\nThe furor erupted at the same time the NBA was holding preseason events in China. Some festivities were canceled, but an exhibition game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets was allowed to go forward on Thursday.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate:\n\nThe NBA has come under criticism for allowing an authoritarian government to impose censorship on its players and executives in the interest of protecting its bottom line. Others have accused the league of hypocrisy for embracing a progressive image when players and coaches express opinions on domestic political issues, only to stifle them when powerful business interests become upset.\n\nAs many as 800 million Chinese citizens watched the NBA last year and some players have cultlike fanbases, giving the league unparalleled power to draw attention to human rights abuses in China, some argue.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s defenders say the league has far too much invested in China to risk its business in the country. NBA commissioner Adam Silver said the situation has already had \u201cfairly dramatic consequences\u201d on the league\u2019s finances. More provocation could further damage the partnership in a way that hurts not only the league\u2019s profits, but player salaries as well. Others argue it\u2019s unfair to single out the NBA when many of America\u2019s biggest corporations also fall in line with China\u2019s policies in order to gain access to the market.\n\nWhat\u2019s next:\n\nAccording to reports from the arena, the scene at Thursday\u2019s exhibition game in Shanghai felt like a \u201cshift back toward normalcy,\u201d suggesting that on-the-court action might serve to temper tensions. The NBA\u2019s regular season begins Oct. 22.\n\nPerspectives\n\nPush back\n\nThe NBA\u2019s popularity in China gives it power most businesses don\u2019t have\n\n\u201cFar from being vulnerable in this fight, the NBA holds all the leverage. It should take stock of basketball\u2019s long history in China, its own enduring popularity there, and the 800 million Chinese who watched its broadcasts last year. The government won\u2019t be keen to pick a fight that tempts so many fans to defy it, and the NBA should be able to safely stand its ground.\u201d \u2014 Adam Minter, Bloomberg\n\nCompanies need to stop trying to have it both ways when doing business with China\n\n\u201cBusinesses are not supposed to be this brittle, but American companies continue to approach the mirage of the Chinese economy as if it is open for the taking, and that the American consumer (and their representatives in Washington) are going to continue to ignore the \u2018authoritarian straddle\u2019 these companies have to undertake to appease Beijing while trying to not displease Washington.\u201d \u2014 Danny Crichton, TechCrunch\n\nChina risks prompting protests from NBA stars by overplaying its hand\n\n\u201cThe Chinese can limit or stop a lot of information, but if star players \u2014 or celebrities in any walk of life who are now clued in on this \u2014 start, say, writing \u2018Hong Kong\u2019 on their shoes or relentlessly supporting the protests, that can break through the wall. If those same stars are banned, or limited, from doing business in China, then they may be even more motivated to do it.\u201d \u2014 Dan Wetzel, Yahoo Sports\n\nThe NBA should end all business with China\n\n\u201cThe only way for the NBA to wash its hands of these issues is to completely move out of China altogether.\u201d \u2014 Rohan Nadkarni, Sports Illustrated", "description": "A tweet from an NBA executive set off a backlash from China that has caused players and league officials to backtrack.
