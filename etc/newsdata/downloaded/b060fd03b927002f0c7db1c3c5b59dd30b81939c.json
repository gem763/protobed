The woman gave him about $400 and some jewelry before Dove, in an hour-long discussion over vodka, told her of his escape and detailed his criminal history before asking the woman to drive him to a farm where he grew up in Poolesville, according to the documents.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe woman agreed, the documents said, and afterward convinced Dove to get something to eat. She took him to a Poolesville restaurant where they encountered several of Dove\u2019s friends and family, and Dove complimented the woman\u2019s appearance.\n\nAfter dinner, Dove suggested he and the woman return to her house, but the woman instead paid for him to spend the night at a hotel, according to prosecutors. After she dropped him off, she went to a family friend\u2019s house, where she stayed the night before contacting police the next day.\n\nDove was arrested on Oct. 15 while leaving the hotel and confessed his crimes, prosecutors said. He was sentenced to 25 years for home invasion Friday, with all but 14 years suspended, and an added three years for escape, according to prosecutors. He faces additional charges for parole violations, and is likely to receive additional time, prosecutors said.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn a statement, Montgomery County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office spokesman Ram\u00f3n V. Korionoff said the woman\u2019s \u201cquick thinking\u201d prevented a worse outcome.\n\n\u201cIt is important to hold accountable those who would break the community\u2019s trust by escaping GPS monitoring and supervision to commit a crime such as home invasion,\u201d he said. \u201cThank goodness this \u2026 woman was not physically harmed.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The victim, who was 79 at the time, sought to defuse the situation, prosecutors said.", "authors": ["Justin Wm.
