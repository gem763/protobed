But Owen said utility crews had to be pulled off the roads in the Portage la Prairie and Neepawa areas because of near-blizzard conditions.\n\nHydro crews need roads cleared\n\nHe expects the crews to be back up and running as soon as they're able to drive where they need to go.\n\n\"We're working with Manitoba Infrastructure right now and at first light in those areas they're going to be firing up their graders,\" he said. \"They're going to be working with us, not to open roads for the public, but to open roads for us so we can get into problem areas so we can begin restoration efforts.\"\n\nOwen said Manitoba Hydro and the contracted crews prioritize certain areas first.\n\nLane Gibson sent this photo to CBC of an oak tree that fell onto his home on Winnipeg's Kingston Crescent. (Submitted by Lane Gibson)\n\n\"We try to restore the greatest number of people first,\" he said. \"People in more isolated areas, smaller outages, we will get to them next.\"\n\nAt the height in Winnipeg, 27,000 households were without power. Owen said that number is now down to about 7,000.\n\nThe storm arrived so early this fall that most trees are still loaded with leaves, which are now supporting the snow and causing the branches to bear more weight than normal.\n\n\"And they are coming down on our [power] lines,\" said Owen, urging the public to be careful.\n\nHeavy damage to trees\n\nMatt Vinet, a manager at Green Drop, one of the yard maintenance companies contracted to do the work, called the situation \"a tree apocalypse\" on Friday.\n\n\"I don't mean to be so alarmist, but it looks pretty grim at this point,\" he said. \"We're going to see a lot of damage to a lot of trees.\"\n\nTrees weighed down by wet, heavy snow have fallen in the city, including in Winnipeg's Wildwood neighbourhood. (Jeff Stapleton/CBC)\n\nThe City of Winnipeg is expected to speak to media later this morning to give an update on the conditions in Winnipeg.\n\nA number of highways in the southwest are still closed due to weather conditions.\n\nNo estimates on power being restored\n\nOn Friday, Manitoba Hydro tweeted it wouldn't be able to provide estimated times for power restoration.\n\nThat's still the case Saturday, and Owen said timing depends on each scenario, including whether there's damage to a power line, whether a tree is involved, and on weather and road conditions.\n\nDue to worsening weather conditions, we are no longer able to provide estimated restoration times. We thank all our customers for their patience as we work to get everyone up and running again. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/mboutage?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#mboutage</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/mbstorm?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#mbstorm</a><br><br>See media release here: <a href=\"https://t.co/CtA4AChkv4\">https://t.co/CtA4AChkv4</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/kaISqniYH8\">pic.twitter.com/kaISqniYH8</a> \u2014@manitobahydro\n\n\"It takes time, not only to get there, but to do the work,\" he said.\n\nFor those who don't like the snow, a bit of a reprieve is coming.\n\n\"It should be moving on later today, if not already, but we still have to fix all the damage that it's left in its wake,\" Owen said.\n\nHe added Manitoba Hydro is fully capable of fixing the problems associated with the storm, the storm just hasn't let up to allow crews to attend to it all.\n\n\"We do have the staff available to do this, we do have the equipment, and we do have all the support people behind our field crews to make sure the trucks are gassed up,\" Owen said. \"Our issue has been the weather.\"\n\nWatch: Manitoba's early snowstorm brings down trees with leaves still attached\n\nResidents reeling after wet dump of snow takes down power lines, snaps trees like twigs. 1:47\n\nHighway closures\n\nDozens of highways and roads throughout southern Manitoba to the U.S. border and the Saskatchewan border are closed to traffic due to poor winter driving conditions.\n\nIt's not known when they will reopen.\n\nSome highways have been closed for over 24 hours.", "description": "Manitoba Hydro says it's working around the clock to restore power after a snowstorm walloped the southwestern\u00a0part of the province over the last two days.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5319376.1570885917!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/winnipeg-storm.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
