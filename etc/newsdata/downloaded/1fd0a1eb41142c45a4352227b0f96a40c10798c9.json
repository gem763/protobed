Photo: HBO\n\nSpoilers below for Succession season two.\n\nFellow Gerri-Roman shippers (Gerri-Romanderers?), we have much to discuss. On the fifth episode of Succession\u2019s second season, the Roys decamp to the Gold Coast of Long Island to convince the blue-blooded Pierce family to sell their media empire \u2014 but more importantly, to also engage in some old-fashioned bedroom farce. Yes, the sleaziest Roy child and Waystar Royco\u2019s general counsel escalated last week\u2019s phone sex into an in-person (though not quite physical) interaction.\n\nA drunken Roman (Kieran Culkin) wanders into Gerri\u2019s (J. Smith-Cameron) room late at night, depressed over the news that Shiv is the heir apparent to the Waystar throne, then drinks her liquor and asks if they can schedule one of their \u201cspecial conference calls.\u201d Gerri starts to berate him in disgust \u2026 then locks him in her bathroom, says he has a \u201crevolting problem,\u201d and calls him a \u201cclassic fuck-up\u201d as he jacks off on the other side of the door.\n\n\u201cWe did almost every one of those beats in a variety of ways,\u201d J. Smith-Cameron told Vulture. \u201cWe would do ones where I was very sharp with him \u2014 not quite dominatrix, but very sharp \u2014 and then there\u2019d be ones where you\u2019d almost be like, Is Gerri being actually seductive or is she flirting with him there? It was very moment-to-moment, as if both characters were walking through a minefield of not knowing where to set their foot.\u201d\n\nWhen they filmed at the end of a late-night shoot, Smith-Cameron said she and Culkin tried so many versions of the scene with director Mark Mylod, she even wasn\u2019t sure which tone would actually be used in the final cut. \u201cA lot of the feeling on set is very collaborative and very playful and very improv-y,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey might not go with your idea. They might not know what to do with it at a certain moment, but they\u2019re always interested, which is really fun for the actor.\u201d\n\nSo, what\u2019s Gerri thinking in the moment? Smith-Cameron said that her character was unsure of what to make of Roman\u2019s \u201cdelightfully confounding\u201d advances. \u201cIf I really didn\u2019t want him in the room, I\u2019d just kick him out, right? I don\u2019t think she\u2019d be scared to do that. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s like sexual harassment by your boss, because it\u2019s Roman. He\u2019s like a kid to Gerri,\u201d she said. \u201cOne moment she might be amused and another moment she might be horrified and shocked.\u201d", "description": "Succession star J. Smith-Cameron doesn\u2019t know what to think of Gerri and Roman\u2019s bizarre budding relationship. But she\u2019s got plenty of thoughts about Gerri berating Roman while he jacks off in a bathroom.", "authors": ["Jackson Mchenry"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/06/06-succession-culkin-smith-cameron.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
