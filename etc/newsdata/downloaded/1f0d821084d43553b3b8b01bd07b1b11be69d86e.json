But faced with so many other calls on the public purse and with little idea of the medium-term direction of the economy, they will have to prepare to play Scrooge instead.\n\n\u201cBadly spent money might do more harm than good, propping up unviable companies and hurting competition.\u201d\n\nThe report said that any industrial rescue effort after a no-deal departure would come against \u201ca backdrop of steeply deteriorating public finances\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe government will be forced into impossible choices about which businesses and industries to save,\u201d it said. \u201cWithout clear principles, the fight over subsidies will be swamped by politics.\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

But it can also be expected to receive appeals for support from companies rendered uncompetitive by changes in trading conditions that could be temporary or long-term, said the report.\n\nFinance might be provided in the form of tax relief, grants, loan, bank guarantees or even direct equity stakes.\n\nHowever, the IFG said: \u201cWith the scope of the effects of no deal being limitless, the first key decision for government is where it draws the line, so as to stop it being government\u2019s job to support everyone.\u201d\n\nGiven the \u201cmultiple sources of harm\u201d to business in a no-deal scenario, it is \u201cnot even a theoretical possibility\u201d to determine how many firms are at risk, said the think tank. And it warned that any attempt to draw up a list would inevitably favour big businesses over smaller enterprises.\n\n\u201cA great many businesses themselves do not yet know their own vulnerability and many would not know until after Brexit happened,\u201d said the IFG. \u201cThe government cannot expect to either. There are over 200,000 UK businesses who trade internationally, and many more that might be indirectly affected.\u201d\n\nThe IFG said the major conclusion of its study was that it would be \u201coptimistic\u201d to assume that the impact of no deal can be softened by making preparations for a finite period of turmoil.\n\n\u201cThe ongoing costs of a no-deal Brexit are so large that to talk of ameliorating them is often quite fruitless,\u201d it said, citing the expected \u00a32bn-a-year cost of export tariffs to the motor industry and the \u201cmuch larger\u201d hit to service exporters.\n\nBecause the length of time during which the UK would have to endure no-deal conditions is hard to know, the government \u201crisks subjecting itself to an open-ended, financially ruinous commitment\u201d if it seeks to cushion blows to these industries.\n\nThe IFG said ministers should draw up clear principles to identify the companies it will want to keep afloat and the requests for help that are not worth pursuing. It should hold back from a radical redesign of its industrial strategy at a time of disruption and financial constraint.\n\nAnd it warned that \u201csevere affordability constraints\u201d will mean that measures used in the 2008 financial crisis \u2013 such as deferring tax payments and providing an enterprise finance guarantee for bank loans \u2013 may not be available.\n\n\u201cFor some companies, the disruption brought about by a no-deal Brexit will be merely a passing inconvenience, or even an opportunity,\u201d said the report. \u201cFor some others, it may signal an unavoidable need to exit a market altogether. Between these extremes lie the situations where the case for support is strongest.\u201d", "description": "If the UK crashes out of the European Union without a deal at the end of the month, the government will be flooded by so many appeals for help from affected businesses that it will have to decide \u201cwho to save and who to let go\u201d, a new report has warned.", "authors": ["Andrew Woodcock"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/16/12/city-of-london.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
