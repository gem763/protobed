PA/Bali Boo/Amazon\n\nMyriam Shingleton, vice president group for development at Carlsberg Group, said the fibre bottles are better for the environment than aluminium or glass because they are sourced in a sustainable way, and because the material has a \u201cvery low impact on production process\u201d.\n\nWhile the final product is still a few years from completion, Shingleton added that she was pleased with the progress made so far.\n\n\u201cWhile we are not completely there yet, the two prototypes are an important step towards realising our ultimate ambition of bringing this breakthrough to market,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cInnovation takes time and we will continue to collaborate with leading experts in order to overcome remaining technical challenges.\u201d\n\nCarlsberg has been working on the paper bottle designs since 2015 alongside tech firm ecoXpac, packaging company BillerudKorsn\u00e4s, and researchers from Danish Technical University.\n\nThe beer company has also joined forces with a number of other companies, including Absolut, Coca-Cola and L'Or\u00e9al to create a new \u201cpaper bottle community\u201d aimed at further developing green packaging.\n\n\"Partnerships such as these, ones that are united by a desire to create sustainable innovations, are the best way to bring about real change,\" Shingleton said.\n\nCarlsberg is not the only company looking to make its packaging more sustainable.\n\nIn recent years, Unilever has launched soap-like shampoo bars and bamboo toothbrushes to help meet its sustainability goals.\n\nSimilarly, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola have shared plans to start selling water in aluminium cans to cut down their use of plastic, while Procter & Gamble has trialled refillable packages for Olay moisturiser.\n\nLast year, Carlsberg eradicated the plastic rings used to hold its six packs of beer.\n\nThe new packs feature cans that are glued together, instead of held together by plastic rings that often end up polluting the ocean and can harm animal life.", "description": "Beer brand Carlsberg is in the development stages of creating a range of beer bottles made from paper.
