Trump released the call\u2019s transcript Wednesday, which showed he asked Ukraine to look into CrowdStrike, a private security group the Democratic National Committee hired to look into Russian interference in its servers. Trump also asked Zelensky to look into the firing of a prosecutor who was looking into Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nCNN, MSNBC and NPR, among the news outlets, edited out the CrowdStrike portion of the transcript, making it seem as though Trump\u2019s focus of the phone call was to have Joe Biden\u2019s son investigated. In fact, the request begins by asking Ukraine to look into meddling in the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cAnd then he says, quote, \u2018I would like you to do us a favor,'\u201d CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar said on \u201cCNN Right Now\u201d Wednesday. \u201cThe president asks Zelensky to dig up dirt on Biden and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his dad was vice president.\u201d\n\nWATCH:\n\n\u201cQuote, \u2018There\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat CNN failed to mention was that in between Trump saying, \u201cI would like you to do us a favor,\u201d is over 500 words of conversation, part of which talks about Ukraine looking into election meddling.\n\nMSNBC peddled similar news, with correspondent Katy Tur saying Trump said, \u201cWill you do me a favor and investigate Vice President Biden\u2019s son?\u201d (RELATED: What Is The Process For Impeaching A President?)\n\nWATCH:\n\nIn an NPR article titled \u201cTrump Asked Ukrainian President For \u2018A Favor\u2019 On Biden; DOJ Says No Charges,\u201d the same altered transcript is peddled. The article included the \u201cfavor\u201d sentence from Trump and immediately jumps to the portion where Joe Biden\u2019s son is brought up.\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cfavor\u201d is regarding CrowdStrike. He said according to the transcript:\n\nI would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it. I would like you to find out what happened with this whole situation with Ukraine, they say CrowdStrike \u2026 I guess you have one of your wealthy people. \u2026 The server, they say Ukraine has it. There are a lot of things that went on, the whole situation. I think you\u2019re surrounding yourself with some of the same people. I would like to have the attorney general call you or your people and I would like you to get to the bottom of it. Later on, Trump asked Ukraine about Joe Biden\u2019s son. Multiple outlets have reported it as though Trump asked about Hunter Biden immediately following his request for a \u201cfavor.\u201d \u201cThe other thing, there\u2019s a lot of talk about Biden\u2019s son, that Biden stopped the prosecution and a lot of people want to find out about that so whatever you can do with the attorney general would be great,\u201d Trump said over 500 words after asking for a favor about looking into election meddling. \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it. \u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.
