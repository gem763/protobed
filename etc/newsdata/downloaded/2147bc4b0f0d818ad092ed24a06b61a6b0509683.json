It will be Verlander's second career start on short rest \u2014 the other came after a one-inning, rain-shortened appearance in the 2011 ALDS. Houston won the first two games of the series with a pair of dominant pitching performances from Verlander and Gerrit Cole, who combined to limit the Rays to one unearned run and five hits over 14 2/3 innings. Houston's other pitchers have allowed 12 earned runs in 11 1/3 innings, an ERA of 9.53.\n\n\"The thought process is five-game series are pretty crazy and we've got to win. Never know what can happen,\" Verlander said after the Astros' 10-3 loss in Game 3 on Monday. \"You can't put all your eggs in one basket and say if we lose tomorrow, we've got Justin and Gerrit (Cole) for Game 5. It's a crazy game.\"\n\nTampa Bay will use Diego Castillo as an opener, and manager Kevin Cash said he'll play matchups with his bullpen after that.\n\nBIG BIRD\n\nThe Cardinals and Braves are off before Wednesday's decisive Game 5 in Atlanta. Yadier Molina rallied St. Louis in Game 4, poking a tying single in the eighth inning and lifting a sacrifice fly to end it in the 10th. Molina slung his bat far into the outfield after his winning swing, and the crowd at Busch Stadium roared with the longtime heart of the franchise. Molina has 10 tying or go-ahead RBIs in his postseason career, tied with Sandy Alomar, Yogi Berra and Johnny Bench for most by a catcher.\n\n\"I like those moments,\" Molina said.\n\nSt. Louis will have ace Jack Flaherty on the mound Wednesday, and the Braves will go with Mike Foltynewicz.\n\nEMPTY SEATS\n\nMajor League Baseball failed to sell out at least three of four postseason games Monday, leaving lots of empty seats at Tampa Bay, St. Louis and Washington. Sub-capacity crowds have become an expectation at Tropicana Field \u2014 even in October \u2014 but they were more striking elsewhere. The Cardinals, whose fans tout themselves as the best in baseball, hosted the Braves in front of 42,203 supporters, about 2,000 fewer than Busch Stadium's listed capacity. Meanwhile, entire sections in the upper deck were nearly empty as Max Scherzer pitched for Washington against the Dodgers. Prior to Monday, the only 2019 playoff games that failed to sell out were NLDS Games 1 and 2 at Dodger Stadium. Attendance during the regular season fell 1.7% this year for its fourth straight decline.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
