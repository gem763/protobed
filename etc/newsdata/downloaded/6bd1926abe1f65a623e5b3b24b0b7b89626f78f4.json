And, even if one is not entirely persuaded by every conclusion drawn by the film, it raises enough questions to make the viewer unsure where a dark reality ends and a wildly speculative scenario begins. Given our current misinformation-riddled culture, with its immersion in Trumpian doublespeak, Cold Case resonates in an eerie fashion well beyond its immediate orbit.\n\nBr\u00fcgger and Bj\u00f6rkdahl, who collaborated on the investigation, at first focus on the crash itself, making use of eyewitness testimony that was disregarded at the time (mainly because it came from black townspeople) and of a hole-riddled piece of metal in Bj\u00f6rkdahl\u2019s possession, assumed to have been taken from the wreckage of the plane. They manage to establish, or at the very least credibly suggest, that the plane was brought down by \u201cthe Lone Ranger,\u201d the code name for Jan van Risseghem, a Belgian mercenary who was piloting a small jet fighter from which he shot at Hammarskj\u00f6ld\u2019s plane. According to the film, the pilot was part of a rogue military group called the South African Institute for Maritime Research (SAIMR), which ran covert operations at the behest of the CIA and MI5. SAIMR was headed by an unhinged white supremacist named Keith Maxwell, who liked to dress up either in all-white or in full eighteenth-century naval regalia, including a tricorn hat and a sword. Hammarskj\u00f6ld was purportedly found with a playing card\u2014the ace of spades\u2014tucked inside his shirt collar. It is a death card, and presented here as a signature of the CIA.\n\nThe film\u2019s shocking revelations about SAIMR\u2014which include an attempt by Maxwell to infect the black population of Africa with the HIV virus so that the whites will eventually outnumber them\u2014are the most disturbing part of the film, if not apparently the most sound. After Cold Case opened at Sundance earlier this year, The New York Times did a news story looking into the veracity of the AIDS conspiracy angle of the story, and found it to be unsubstantiated. Likewise, the two investigators discover a cache of secret papers, named \u201cOperation Celeste\u201d and ostensibly written by SAIMR members or Maxwell himself, outlining the conspiracy to take down Hammarskj\u00f6ld\u2019s plane. Although these papers were released by South Africa\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1998, no firm conclusions were drawn.\n\nBr\u00fcgger toys with the viewer like a postmodern Hitchcock, musing on his own lack of efficacy.\n\nWhile the film eventually bites off more than it can chew, its cinematic style is one of its most provocative features. The film is framed by scenes of Br\u00fcgger dictating the script to one of two female African secretaries who work for him. The point of the doubling is not clear, except to heighten the sense of an arbitrarily skewered narrative. Both secretaries tap away\u2014somewhat curiously, in this age of computers\u2014on loudly clacking manual typewriters and ask comically leading, na\u00efve questions, such as: \u201cDid you already summarize the whole story?\u201d Or, \u201cIs it bad for the story?\u201d\n\nOn the office wall, there are yellow post-it notes inscribed with typed reminders, which, like storyboards, delineate the plot. There is also a subtly ominous soundtrack, which signals without trumpeting them what are likely to be dire developments up ahead, and is among the touches that add an inescapably noirish element to the film. As if this were not enough, Br\u00fcgger also toys with the viewer like a postmodern Hitchcock, musing on his own lack of efficacy at spinning a propulsive and taut thriller and wondering if he has produced, instead, a rambling and wildly speculative, not to mention amateurish venture. At one point, Br\u00fcgger goes so far as to admit that he is unsure whether SAIMR is a real organization or if, rather, it might not all be \u201can elaborate hoax embedded in reality by Keith Maxwell.\u201d", "description": "How do you investigate a vast international intrigue in a culture that is overloaded with conspiracy theories?", "authors": ["Daphne Merkin"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/3be9f136dc6f9a6ea02f941dbe36c5d34f32dcbb.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg"}
