The party leader has said that if the party won a majority they would revoke article 50, effectively cancelling Brexit.\n\nShe welcomed Allen\u2019s move, saying: \u201cShe has long been an ally in the fight to stop Brexit, and having worked with her I know the energy and passion she will bring to our party. This once again proves that the Liberal Democrats are the strongest party of remain.\u201d\n\nChange UK, which has been renamed again and is now called the Independent Group for Change, is led by the former Conservative MP Anna Soubry and now has just five MPs.", "description": "MP said Tories and Labour have \u2018turned their backs on the liberal, progressive centre ground\u2019", "authors": ["Heather Stewart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/630bf1c71ad0be0060cccb6e7027acdbcb29d10b/0_235_6334_3801/master/6334.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=08d72b875579cbeda85dd74e24302f06", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
