The electric car division employs more than 500 people, and Sir James said the company would try to find them positions on other projects.\n\nThe company had already invested vast amounts of money into the project, including building testing tracks in the UK that were already in use. Those will now be used for other projects, Sir James said.\n\nDyson's electric vehicle was announced in 2017 and the cars were expected to be completed next year.\n\nSir James stressed that the decision was not a \"product failure\" but a consequence of failing to find a buyer.\n\n\"We have tried very hard throughout the development process, we simply can no longer see a way to make it commercially viable,\" he wrote in an email by the BBC.\n\n\"The Dyson automotive team has developed a fantastic car; they have been ingenious in their approach while remaining faithful to our philosophies.\"\n\nThe battery technology developed by the car would go on to help other projects he wrote.\n\n\"Our battery will benefit Dyson in a profound way and take us in exciting new directions,\" he claimed in the email.\n\nAlmost exactly a year ago, Dyson caused controversy when it announced that the car would be built in Singapore, despite Sir James' very public backing of Brexit. At the time it claimed decision was not related to Brexit but had been a \u201ccomplex\u201d one based on \u201csupply chains, access to markets and the availability of the expertise\u201d.\n\nRead more\n\nDyson to build new electric car in Singapore", "description": "Dyson has cancelled its plans to build an electric car.The company had built a \"fantastic\" vehicle, founder James Dyson wrote in an email, but the project is not \"commercially viable\".", "authors": ["Andrew Griffin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/frGZy5SuU3w97tEEraRnPg--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/73d8aebb6e8eb62fbd58bdb39ea760cc", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
