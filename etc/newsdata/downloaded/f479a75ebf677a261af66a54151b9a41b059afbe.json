California power lines spark wildfires and prompt blackouts.\n\nIn its filing on the Kincade Fire, PG&E said a worker noted that a CAL FIRE team battling the blaze had taped off the area around one transmission tower. Fire workers directed PG&E to what appeared to be a broken jumper wire on the same tower. A jumper is the wire that carries the electrical current.\n\nPG&E CEO Bill Johnson said it was too soon to know if the faulty equipment ignited the fire. He said the tower had been inspected four times in the past two years and appeared to have been in excellent condition.\n\nCAL FIRE says that the cause of the fire is \u201cunder investigation.\u201d\n\nCalifornia governor slams PG&E: 'Greed' and 'mismangement' led to widespread power cuts\n\nIn May, PG&E agreed with fire officials who determined that equipment operated by the utility caused last November's Camp Fire, the most destructive wildfire in California's history.\n\nThe fire killed 85 people and destroyed more than 150,000 acres. Investigators found that the fire started from electrical transmission lines controlled by PG&E near the community of Pulga. The fire, driven by strong winds, quickly spread in the dry vegetation, destroying the communities of Concow, Paradise and Magalia.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Kincade Fire: PG&E transmission tower had broken wire near wildfire", "description": "While the cause of the Kincade Fire is under investigation, PG&E; says there was a faulty wire on a transmission tower near the blaze near Geyserville", "authors": ["Doug Stanglin", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/JmCPJ3wO6_q6XcgtQYhQfw--~B/aD0zNjQ4O3c9NTQ3MjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/ea83aa030a5aea30ca865976ea1286c8", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
