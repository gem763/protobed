The V-sign was used.\n\n'Christopher Gadd got out of the vehicle and shouted at the defendant.'\n\nHiggins drove away with his girlfriend Nia Bailey in the passenger seat.\n\nCardiff Crown Court heard Mr Gadd walked across car park carriageways to 'continue remonstrating' with Higgins.\n\nMr Williams said: 'As he approached Mr Higgins car he deliberately swerved the motor vehicle to the right in order to drive at Christopher Gadd.\n\n'As a result the Land Rover Freelander collided with Mr Gadd in a glancing blow.\n\n'Despite the best efforts of members of the public, members of staff at the supermarket, police and paramedics he lost his life at 4pm that afternoon.'\n\nA woman shopper saw Higgins 'turn into the man' at the supermarket car park at Pontllanfraith, Caerphilly, South Wales, the jury was told.\n\nThe court heard window fitter Higgins only had a provisional license at the time of the accident and was uninsured to drive the Freelander.\n\nShoppers and supermarket workers ran to give first aid but he died at the scene. Pictured is an air ambulance that landed nearby\n\nMr Williams said: 'The prosecution do not contend that the defendant deliberately meant to kill Mr Gadd but he deliberately drove the vehicle in an unlawful act.'\n\nThe jury was warned that the CCTV from the supermarket car park would not be 'an easy watch'.\n\nMr Gadd suffered blunt force injuries and complex fractures of the skull and brain haemorrhages.\n\nHiggins of Wyllie, Blackwood, Caerphilly, denies manslaughter, causing death by driving while uninsured and not having a valid license.\n\nIn police interviews Higgins denied any wrong-doing saying he had not deliberately driven at Mr Gadd.\n\nHe said two males in the car behind him were swearing and sticking their fingers up at him.\n\nHiggins said the men were 'aggressive, shouting and screaming' and he feared for the safety of his girlfriend.\n\nHe claims he saw Mr Gadd jogging towards him but he continued driving in a straight line when he heard a 'thud'.\n\nThe prosecution said Higgins later made a significant admission that he deliberately swerved at him to 's*** him up'.\n\nMr Williams said: 'By that he meant to put the s***s up him, to scare him.'\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Timothy Higgins (pictured), 22, wanted to 'scare' Christopher Gadd, 48, after his car blocked him from leaving his parking space in Pontllanfraith, Wales, on March 4.", "authors": ["Tom Bedford", "Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/14/19992714-0-image-a-83_1571665882626.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
