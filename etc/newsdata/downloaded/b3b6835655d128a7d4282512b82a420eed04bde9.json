Argentine women took to the streets with the same intention on Friday.\n\nAccording to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that supports abortion rights, 97% of women in Latin America and the Caribbean live in countries with restrictive abortion laws. Six countries - the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua and Suriname - do not allow abortion under any circumstances.\n\nEfforts to ease restrictions on abortions have emerged across the region in recent years as societies become more liberal and the Roman Catholic Church loses sway amid a wave of clerical sex abuse cases. Only two countries permit abortions for all pregnancies under 12 weeks. Some countries permit abortions in cases of serious fetal anomalies or rape, while others jail women who have experienced miscarriages, accusing them of deliberating terminating their pregnancies.\n\nDuring 2010-2014, the Guttmacher Institute estimates that 6.5 million induced abortions occurred in Latin America and the Caribbean. That translates to a rate of 44 per 1,000 women of reproductive age. About 760,000 women in the region are treated each year for complications from unsafe abortions.\n\nHere are some key facts and figures for specific countries:\n\nCARIBBEAN\n\nCuba decriminalized abortion in 1965, offering the procedure for free in government hospitals. These days, amid widespread shortages of contraception, an estimated two out of five pregnancies in Cuba are terminated. Young Cubans are reluctant to start families on meager salaries, and birth rates how been on the decline on the island for decades.\n\nElsewhere in the Caribbean, the Dominican Republic and Haiti forbid all abortions. Haiti, the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere, also has one of the highest fertility rates in the Americas with 2.9 births per woman.\n\nMEXICO\n\nIn Mexico, the southern state of Oaxaca on Wednesday became the second jurisdiction - joining Mexico City - to allow elective abortions during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Only abortion in case of rape is legal in all of Mexico. Some states make exceptions for unviable fetuses, or when the mother\u2019s life is in danger, but women who miscarry or intentionally terminate pregnancies have sometimes been jailed for murder.\n\nThe majority of abortions practiced in Mexico are clandestine. Since 2007, women in Mexico City may opt for abortions within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. The Mexico City Health Ministry says more than 200,000 legal abortions have been performed in the capital over the past 12 years.\n\nCENTRAL AMERICA\n\nThree Central American countries have total bans on abortion: El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras. Women in these countries also face a high incidence of sexual assault and unwanted pregnancies.\n\nEl Salvador stands out for its aggressive prosecution for suspected abortions. More than a dozen women are in jail for abortion, some serving sentences of up to 40 years. Such punishments often fall on poor, young women and victims of rape. The country also prosecutes health service providers believed to have assisted in abortions. Women who show up to hospitals following miscarriages or botched abortions are sometimes turned over by health care providers for investigation and prosecution.\n\nEarlier in September, Salvadoran prosecutors said they would seek a third trial against Evelyn Beatr\u00edz Hern\u00e1ndez, who says she didn\u2019t realize she was pregnant as a result of a rape when she was a teenager. Her mother says she found Hern\u00e1ndez passed out after her daughter birthed a likely stillborn baby into an outdoor toilet. The hospital where she was treated reported the missing baby to investigators.\n\nSOUTH AMERICA\n\nArgentina came close to decriminalizing abortion last year for any pregnancy up to 14 weeks after a measure passed in the lower house of Congress. The Senate voted it down under heavy opposition from conservative groups.\n\nPope Francis, who is from Argentina, says abortion can never be condoned, even when the fetus stands little chance of survival outside the womb. The homeland of Pope Francis is also home to some of the most widely attended and vocal protests in favor of legalizing abortion, with thousands of women taking to the streets of Buenos Aires each year with green scarves around their necks.\n\nThe green scarves symbolize support for decriminalizing abortion and were inspired by the white scarves carried by mothers whose children disappeared during Argentina\u2019s dictatorship.\n\nIn 2017, Chile became the last country in South America to drop a total ban on abortion.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mexican women are marching Saturday for greater reproductive rights, including access to abortions, in one of the world's most restrictive regions for reproductive choice.
