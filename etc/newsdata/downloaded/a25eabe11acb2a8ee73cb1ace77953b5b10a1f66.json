Formed amid a feud between Bernier and the Conservative party, its platform is defined by restrictive immigration politics and climate change denial. Activist groups had protested against his presence on stage, arguing it was wrong to give his policies a highly visible platform. But the Leaders\u2019 Debates Commission found Bernier \u2013 once a foreign minister under the Conservatives \u2013 had a \u201clegitimate chance\u201d of electing more than one candidate in the election.\n\nThroughout the evening he played the spoiler, frequently interrupting each candidate as they spoke.\u201cI think, within a few minutes tonight, Canadians can see why I didn\u2019t think you had a place on this stage,\u201d Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic party, told Bernier.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh speaks.

Scheer also accused the prime minister of wearing a \u201cmask\u201d when it comes to his feminist credentials and attempts at reconciliation with indigenous peoples.\n\n\u201cMr Trudeau, you are a phoney and you\u2019re a fraud and you do not deserve to govern this country,\u201d said Scheer in his opening remarks.\n\nTrudeau repeatedly attacked Scheer on perceptions of credibility, accusing the Conservative leader of dishonesty and obfuscation on taxes and abortion.\n\nDespite running a largely gaffe-free campaign, Scheer was put on the defensive last week after the Globe and Mail reported he held dual citizenship with the United States. Scheer\u2019s troubles were exacerbated given his history \u2013 as well as his party\u2019s \u2013 of criticising elected representatives who are dual nationals, including the former governor general Micha\u00eblle Jean.\n\nSingh, the first non-white leader of a major political party in the country\u2019s history, worked to cast himself as a third option for Canadian voters, accusing both Conservatives and Liberals of kowtowing to affluent donors and corporate interests.\n\n\u201cYou vote New Democrats, we\u2019re going to make sure we\u2019re going to make these things happen because we don\u2019t work for the powerful and wealthy,\u201d said Singh. \u201cWe work for you.\u201d\n\nIn a debate that often became confusing with its numerous formats and moderators, Singh scored moments of levity. After candidates \u2013 and a moderator \u2013 repeatedly called him \u201cScheer\u201d by mistake, Singh objected in mock protest. \u201cC\u2019mon! I wore bright orange turban today. What will it take?\u201d he said, prompting laughter from the room.\n\nEven before the debate began, the event was shrouded in controversy. The Leaders\u2019 Debates Commission declined to accredit two rightwing organisations, Rebel Media and True North Centre for Public Policy. Opponents to the two organisations have argued they are far-right groups that do not produce journalism. But a last-minute injunction, ordered by a federal court only two hours before the debate, granted the two organisations access.\n\nCandidates will debate once more, in French, on Friday.", "description": "PM immediately targeted over blackface scandal but says choice is about two parties with \u2018very different views\u2019 on global heating", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9ff85a2ae9962b8f049b5738b45f764ef2c1aa0/104_0_3281_1969/master/3281.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=86200aa6f92993a6c7cdb964d218308a", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
