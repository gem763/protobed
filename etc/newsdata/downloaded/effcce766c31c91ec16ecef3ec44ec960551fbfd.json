It\u2019s basically your previously established hot girl summer activities, except you get to wear head-to-toe plaid and buy matching vests with your dog, played in the video by Megan\u2019s real dog 4oe. So don\u2019t give up your cut-offs and your body glitter just because the temperature is dropping. Enjoy them simultaneously with your multiple pies and jack-o-lantern full of wine. Use this time to prepare yourself for the savageness of Hot Girl Winter.\n\nRelated", "description": "Rapper Megan the Stallion stopped by The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon to duet with Jimmy Fallon on \u201cHot Girl Fall,\u201d a parody of her song \u201cHot Girl Summer.\u201d", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/24-Hot-Girl-Fall-Megan-Thee-Stallion.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
