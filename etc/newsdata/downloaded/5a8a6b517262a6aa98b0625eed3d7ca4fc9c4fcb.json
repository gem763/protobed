You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cOur approach to creating social change is to raise up the work non-profits are doing on the ground,\u201d said co-founder Ben Cohen. \u201cWe bring every resource we have to support them\u2014our business voice, our connection with fans, our Scoop Shop community and of course, ice cream. Somehow, it\u2019s easier to talk about difficult issues over a scoop or two.\u201d\n\nBen & Jerry\u2019s created the new flavour in partnership with Advancement Project National Office, a multi-racial civil rights organisation that works with local grassroots organisers on racial justice issues.\n\n\u201cOur country needs to invest in services that build up communities rather than those that tear them down,\u201d said Advancement Project National Office executive director Judith Browne Dianis. \u201cThat means ending a wealth-based pre-trial detention system that locks people up because they are poor, black or brown. It means dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline, divesting from criminalising students, and investing in the creation of high-quality education and services. It\u2019s time to reimagine safety and justice.\u201d\n\nThe company says a portion of proceeds from sales of \u201cJustice ReMix\u2019d\u201d will go to the Advancement Project National Office to support its work advocating for criminal justice reform.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

In May, Ben & Jerry\u2019s spent more than $80,000 on Facebook ads promoting criminal justice and in October 2018, the company released a new flavour called \u201cPecan Resist\u201d in protest of President Trump.\n\n\u201cJustice ReMix\u2019d\u201d is available in stores and in Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream shops.", "description": "Ben & Jerry\u2019s is making a statement about the need for criminal justice reform with the launch of its newest flavour, \u201cJustice ReMix\u2019d\u201d.", "authors": ["Chelsea Ritschel"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/04/15/drv-justiceremix-dflavor-hero-3-779x400.jpg"}
