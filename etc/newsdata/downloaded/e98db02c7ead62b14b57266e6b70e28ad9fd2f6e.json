An unspoiled island group located in the Red Sea near Massawa, it boasts an archipelago that consists of two large and 124 small islands.\n\nA few years ago, I had a friend who lived in Asmara, the capital of Eritrea, for two years. She visited the Dahlak Archipelago Islands for a weekend with her friends and described her experience to me, saying, \"It's like the ultimate dream island holiday, minus all the luxury.\"\n\nREAD: Okavango Delta safari or deep-sea diving off Zanzibar?

She said they camped on the beach, and paid their local guide - who transferred them there and back in a traditional sambuk boat - to provide them with essentials and meals.

Apparently, the watching stars here at night is something wild to experience, as there is absolutely zero light-pollution.\n\nJourney By Design says that the weather is hot all year-round at 25\u00b0C between November and April, jumping to a high of 45\u00b0C between June and September.\n\nPerfect for snorkelling and, undoubtedly, a diver's paradise, the marine life in the archipelago is apparently unparalleled. Also expect larger animals like dolphins, dugongs, sharks and turtles.\n\nWATCH: Faroe Islands lets you explore on land, on water and in the air\n\nThe islands also play host to pearl fisheries, which still produce a substantial number of pearls.\n\nSo really, it has A LOT going for it.\n\nBut why is it so unknown?\n\nEritrea has a very tumultuous history. From border war to its current totalitarian political climate, it is not particularly open to visitors.\n\nIt has been called the 'North Korea of Africa', which doesn't exactly scream \"Welcome!\"\n\nVisas are difficult to obtain and even then, you need travel permits for certain areas. You can't even leave the capital without one, says Unusual Traveller. South Africans can apply for a visa and pick up a pre-approved one on arrival.\n\nSaying that, there are more and more flights to Eritrea, particularly from Dubai with carriers like Turkish Airlines flying there more frequently. Plus, as of last year there are more cross-border flights between Eritrea and Ethiopia, which could see a boost in tourism in the area.\n\nFind Your Escape by searching and comparing flight prices here.
