Min Dhariwal is spending his summer getting to know ordinary people doing remarkable things. Do you have a story that should be told? Let us know by email at whatsyourstory@CBC.ca\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt six feet two inches, Adut Bulgak commands respect when she steps onto the court.\n\nIn the gym of her old high school, Archbishop O\u2019Leary in north-central Edmonton, the lanky player with a smooth release is working up a sweat, draining three-point shots with deadly precision.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t always like this for the South Sudanese refugee, who was selected by the WNBA\u2019s New York Liberty in 2016 as a first-round draft pick.\n\nAnd she is the first one to admit it.\n\n\u201cKutney used to make fun of me,\u201d said Bulgak, grinning as she talked about her former high school coach Ron Kutney who used to tease her about her challenges with co-ordination.\n\n\u201cHe used to say I couldn\u2019t walk, talk and chew gum at the same time,\u201d she added.\n\nBulgak had to overcome a lot of obstacles to realize her dream of playing pro basketball.

Another member of the team, assistant coach Kayla Smart, was instrumental in helping her get back on track, Bulgak said.\n\n\u201cMy mom used to come and talk to coach Smart and tell her, \u2018No! She has to be home cooking and cleaning!\u2019 and so I\u2019m really glad that Kayla had my back and told her to allow me to continue playing the game,\u201d she said.\n\nBasketball became an escape for Bulgak in 2007, when her oldest brother, Deng Atem Bulgak, was murdered in the family\u2019s backyard, and again two years later when another brother was killed in a car crash.\n\nLosing herself in the sport helped Bulgak keep on track.\n\nBasketball allowed Bulgak to pursue her dreams of playing and getting her university degree.

While there, Bulgak was named the NJCAA Division player of the year.\n\nThen came a transfer to Florida State University, where her game kept getting better. She won numerous accolades and became one of just three players to earn All-America status multiple times.\n\nMore importantly for her mom, she graduated with a degree in sociology and criminology.\n\n\u201cIt was so important for my mom \u2014 coming as refugees \u2014 to get that education,\u201d said Bulgak. \u201cI was the first one to graduate from university in my family out of the kids. That just gave her a lot of hope.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, Bulgak was drafted 12th overall by the New York Liberty. She played with them for one season then joined the Chicago Sky in 2017.\n\nNow she\u2019s pursuing her dream in the Middle East with Ramat Chen, a professional team in Israel.\n\n\"Don't get distracted\": That's the message Bulgak shares with the kids looking at getting into professional sports.

She returns to Edmonton to be with her family every off-season.\n\nShe also takes time to talk to younger players about their focus on the game \u2014 and the importance of education.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get distracted is the main message,\u201d Bulgak told a group of young men after a practice session. \u201cIf you have a goal, don\u2019t let outside forces distract you.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a message that isn\u2019t lost on O\u2019Leary star basketball player Innocent Pebalo. He is heading into Grade 12 this fall with hopes of securing a post-secondary scholarship.\n\nInnocent Pebalo is motivated by Bulgak's story.

He said his sister has a signed Bulgak jersey hanging on her wall.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s mind-blowing because not many Sudanese girls get to the level she\u2019s at,\u201d said Pebalo, who is also from South Sudan.\n\n\u201cIt motivates me to be like her because she\u2019s somewhere that I want to be, too,\u201d he said..\n\nHaving someone like Bulgak come back to the school is invaluable.\n\n\u201cThe academic part of it is huge,\u201d said Josh McJannet, the men\u2019s senior basketball coach at Archbishop O\u2019Leary.\n\n\u201cShe definitely got that message.\u201d\n\nMcJannet continually reminds students how lucky they are to have a former student come back to mentor them.\n\nBulgak speaks with a group of young men who were shooting hoops at Archbishop O'Leary High School.

The Queen of O\u2019Leary is here!\u2019\u201d\n\nHe said the message of academics over sports holds more weight when it comes from someone like Bulgak, who he calls the \u201cone per cent of the one per cent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about so much more than the 90 feet on the basketball court,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s everything else \u2014 whether it be family, whether it be academics, whether it\u2019s all the support you have from the community. Like that\u2019s all part of it and that\u2019s a message Adut gives every time she comes back,\u201d said McJannet.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to foster that idea of \u2018student athlete,\u2019 because at the end of the day all of us at some point in our life are no longer going to be an athlete,\u201d he said.\n\nBulgak is already thinking about the next phase.\n\nShe wants to return to the WNBA, possibly Toronto, where there\u2019s talk of a new expansion team coming north of the border.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to try and play at home, if the opportunity is there. That\u2019s my number one.\u201d", "description": "Adut Bulgak is following her dreams of playing professional basketball, getting her start on Edmonton's north side.", "authors": ["Min Dhariwal"], "top_image": "https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/craft-assets/images/social/WYS-090-1-1.jpg"}
