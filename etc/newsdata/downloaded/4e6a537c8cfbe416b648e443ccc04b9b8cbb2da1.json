Carson\u2019s back foot inadvertently kicked Matthews in the face while Carson evaded the tackle.\n\nRams coach Sean McVay revealed the injury to his club\u2019s sacks leader Friday after the team\u2019s return to California.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not good for us,\u201d McVay said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big injury. He is going to require surgery on that, so he is going to be out for an extended period of time. At least a month.\u201d\n\nThe Rams (3-2) have three more games before their bye.\n\nThe 33-year-old Matthews is off to an excellent start in his first season with his hometown team following 10 years with the Green Bay Packers.\n\nHe has six sacks in his first five games, including the only sack by either team in the Rams\u2019 loss at Seattle. Matthews also has a team-leading nine tackles for loss among his 19 total tackles, and he has forced two fumbles.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a tough guy, but it was a physical game,\u201d McVay said. \u201cIt was something that you just hate for him because of how productive he\u2019s been for us and what he\u2019s meant to our team and all the things that he\u2019s done. It\u2019s going to be a big loss. Guys are going to be asked to step up in his absence.\u201d\n\nSamson Ebukam is likely to step into Matthews\u2019 starting role as an edge rusher, McVay said.\n\nEbukam has played in every game for the Rams during his 2\u00bd seasons with the club, excelling on special teams and playing a supporting role on defense. He famously scored touchdowns on a fumble return and an interception return during the Rams\u2019 epic 54-51 victory over Kansas City last season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Los Angeles Rams linebacker Clay Matthews will be out for several weeks after breaking his jaw during their loss to the Seattle Seahawks.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Greg Beacham"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/buccaneers_rams_football_85696_c0-123-2941-1837_s1770x1032.jpg?fe257baaa694a7a4de1c6b5fee7a4bec3fc49276", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
