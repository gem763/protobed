Giuliani and former U.S. attorney Joseph E. diGenova on \"The Ingraham Angle\" on Tuesday. (Screengrab via Fox News/\"The Ingraham Angle\")\n\nFormer U.S. attorney Joseph E. diGenova turned to European history Tuesday night to describe the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry into President Trump, calling their efforts \u201cregicide,\u201d the act of killing a king.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is regicide,\u201d diGenova, a frequent Trump defender, told Fox News host Laura Ingraham. \u201cThis is regicide by another name, fake impeachment. The Democrats in the House want to destroy the president.\"\n\nBut diGenova, a conspiracy theorist Trump wanted on his legal team during the Russia probe, wasn\u2019t finished. In a lengthy interview on \u201cThe Ingraham Angle,\u201d the lawyer, who was joined by Trump\u2019s personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, blasted the two anonymous whistleblowers as \u201csuicide bombers\u201d and accused Democrats of \u201csedition.\u201d\n\nThe fiery rhetoric marks the latest escalation in language used by Trump\u2019s supporters, and even the president himself, to complain about the ongoing impeachment inquiry, a tactic that has prompted some to express concern about the safety of the whistleblowers and top Democrats.\n\nDiGenova\u2019s comments were also notably made on Fox News, which has recently given similar claims increasing airtime, The Washington Post reported. Additionally, Ingraham has faced advertiser boycotts for making controversial statements on social media and while hosting her show. Fox News did not respond to a request for comment about diGenova\u2019s remarks late Tuesday.\n\n[Trump\u2019s rhetoric will have a chilling effect on whistleblowing, legal experts say]\n\nIngraham invited diGenova and Giuliani onto her Tuesday show to discuss the latest impeachment developments. Earlier in the day, the White House issued an eight-page letter in which it refused to cooperate with the Ukraine inquiry, slamming it as \u201cpartisan and unconstitutional.\u201d\n\n[Letter from White House counsel Pat Cipollone to House leaders]\n\nBoth Giuliani and diGenova were reportedly involved in Trump\u2019s Ukraine dealings, which are at the center of the whistleblower complaint that prompted Democrats to launch their investigation.\n\nGiuliani, who was identified as a key player in Trump\u2019s attempts to get Ukraine to look into his political opponent, former vice president Joe Biden, has since been subpoenaed by three House committees. Late last month, Fox News reported that diGenova and his wife, Victoria Toensing, helped Giuliani and that only Trump knew about their involvement. DiGenova refuted the report as \u201cabsolutely false,\u201d though the New York Times has published similar details. Trump hired the couple last year, but the offer was rescinded days later due to undisclosed conflicts, the Times reported at the time.\n\n\u201cHowever, those conflicts do not prevent them from assisting the president in other legal matters,\u201d Trump attorney Jay Sekulow told the Times in a statement. \u201cThe president looks forward to working with them.\u201d\n\nWhile it remains unclear in what capacity diGenova and Toensing have assisted Trump, the pair often appear on Fox News to defend the president and attack his critics.\n\nOn Tuesday, for example, when diGenova discussed the two people who have come forward with information about Trump, he said, \u201cI refuse to call them whistleblowers.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese two nonentities are suicide bombers that the Democrats have unleashed on the democratic process,\u201d he said. \u201cThey actually think that the American people are going to accept having people testify secretly without anyone knowing who they are, where they worked, what their party affiliation was, who they conspired with.\"\n\nHe continued: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious that this first suicide bomber who sent that complaint to the inspector general was a paid Democratic operative of the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nIngraham quickly interjected to clarify diGenova\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cYou mean political suicide bomber obviously, before we get people messaging us, \u2018Oh he really meant \u2026,\u2019\u201d Ingraham said, drawing a boisterous laugh from Giuliani.\n\nThe host went on to suggest that anyone who interpreted diGenova\u2019s comment otherwise needed to \u201cget a sense of humor.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you still think that, then you should really watch another show where we have to spell it all out for you,\u201d Ingraham said.\n\nLater in the show, diGenova echoed Trump\u2019s repeated claims that top Democrats are committing treason by investigating him.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats who used to just love process and procedure and the rule of law, they are literally subverting the law in what really amounts to a seditious attack on the government,\u201d diGenova said. \u201cIt really is sedition what they\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nSedition, though related to treason, is conduct or language inciting rebellion against the authority of a state. Treason is the more serious crime of actively levying war against one\u2019s country or giving aid to its enemies.\n\nMeanwhile, Giuliani shifted the blame to the media.\n\n\u201cDo you know why they get away with this? Why they do this?\u201d he said of Democrats. \u201cIt really is the fault of the press. The press enables them. They can say anything they want.\u201d\n\nLate Tuesday night, Trump also added his voice to the mix, firing off tweets again decrying the impeachment probe as a \u201cwitch hunt,\u201d a classification Giuliani disputed on Fox News.\n\n\u201cThis is now worse than a witch hunt,\u201d Giuliani said, adding that he has read books about the Salem witch trials. \u201cThey had more rights.\u201d", "description": "\u201cThis is regicide by another name, fake impeachment,\" the former U.S. attorney said Tuesday night. \"The Democrats in the House want to destroy the president.\"", "authors": ["Allyson Chiu", "Reporter With The Morning Mix Team", "October At Am", "Allyson Chiu Is A Reporter With The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
