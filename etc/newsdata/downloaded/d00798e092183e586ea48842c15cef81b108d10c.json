And so the speculation is that he is applying some of its main principles and insights to inform the actions taken \u2013 and strategies adopted \u2013 by Boris Johnson as the country jolts and lurches towards Brexit. But is Cummings \u201cplaying the game\u201d correctly?\n\nOne fundamental principle of game theory is that you know what the game is in the first place. You must know who the players are, what their objectives are, and the potential actions they have at their disposal.\n\nSo where does that leave us on Brexit? In the recent negotiations, it would be reasonable to identify the UK government and EU as the two players. As such, under game theory, everything Johnson has done since becoming prime minister is formulated with the EU in mind as the other player.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

This was aimed at persuading the other player of the game \u2013 the EU \u2013 to make concessions and give the UK a \u201cbetter\u201d, or at least different deal.\n\nHowever, there has been one clear oversight in the Cummings strategy.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \u2018Brexit is like...\u2019 The Top 20 Twitter analogies Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

Strategic reasoning \u2013 as emphasised and developed in game theory \u2013 is about putting oneself in the shoes of the other players in the game being played. That is, before deciding on what actions to take, and before selecting one\u2019s strategy, it is critical to first think through how other players in the game \u2013 be it the EU, the leader of the opposition or other MPs \u2013 would react to the several alternative actions that one could choose from.\n\nIt is this \u201cwhat if\u201d style of reasoning that lies at the heart of game theory: determining the \u201cwhat if\u201d, as if you were the other player.\n\nOne recent example which has, arguably, shown a lack of strategic reasoning from Johnson and Cummings is their attempt to suspend parliament \u2013 thereby blocking MPs from averting a no deal Brexit.\n\nFirst, the move to prorogue was widely publicised and provided MPs with a full week to take action, prior to its suspension. This failure to recognise that MPs would/could act decisively, intensely and very likely successfully (as they were in the end), is a failure to appreciate this second fundamental principle of game theory: as in physics, any action will invite a reaction.\n\nNot only were MPs missed as key players in the Brexit game, their capacity for disruptive action was also misjudged.\n\nThe need to anticipate the different and responsive moves of your fellow players, before they have happened, and then make decisions informed by such a \u201cwhat if\u201d analysis, lies at the heart of game theory. It is known as the \u201clook forward and reason backward\u201d principle. To succeed in the game, you must be able to look ahead to all possible future outcomes \u2013 and use this foresight to establish the most suitable immediate choice.\n\nIt is not clear to me that this principle was applied by the government in their recent actions, or at least not as meticulously as it should have been. Had it been deployed, the timing of the decision to suspend parliament would have been later than it was \u2013 pre-empting the defensive manoeuvres from MPs.\n\nAnother core part of the strategy employed by Cummings et al in Brexit negotiations thus far appears to be brinkmanship \u2013 another key concept in game theory. The core idea is the deliberate creation of risk. The risk should be sufficiently intolerable to the other player \u2013 in this case the EU \u2013 to induce the player to back down and make concessions. Johnson\u2019s \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge may be read as an attempt to create this \u201cintolerable risk\u201d.\n\nAnd so it is like cars playing \u201cchicken\u201d: two people drive towards each other and one driver wins by not swerving out of the way of the oncoming opponent. The longer you wait the more the other believes you won\u2019t yield. So it is possible to imagine that Cummings has conceptualised Brexit\u2019s \u201cdeal or no deal\u201d decision as a game of chicken, played in real time, with Johnson at the wheel.\n\nThe catch, of course, is that such brinkmanship has to be credible, and so needs to be backed up with random acts of madness \u2013 behaviour that is not typically desirable from a prime minister within a democratic political system.\n\nThe UK government is now waiting for the UK Supreme Court to decide Tuesday on its prorogation of parliament was unlawful. But in the meantime there have been reports that the government may seek to circumvent legislation requiring an extension to be requested if a deal is not reached by the deadline of 31 October. These actions may be read as brinkmanship, and part of Johnson\u2019s attempt to establish his credentials as irresponsible to the point of lunacy in order to incite the EU to action.\n\nThe question is, and the crucial point when it comes to game theory, is when the risk of his strategy becomes intolerable for the fourth player in the game, the one who fired the starting pistol, but has yet to make another move \u2013 the UK people.\n\nAbhinay Muthoo is Dean of Warwick in London.
