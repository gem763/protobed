But wages actually fell, manufacturing jobs shrank (a casualty of trade conflict and maybe some late-in-the-economic-cycle shrinkage), and retail fell off a cliff, cutting 11,400 positions, including 13,000 in clothing stores.\n\nThe gains were probably not in industries where you\u2019d like them to be \u2014 indeed, some are, at a glance, hard to believe. And they are smaller than the 157,000 average monthly gain over the last six months.\n\nWage gains softening\n\n\u201cA 50-year low unemployment rate is nice, but wage gains are softening and that does not bode well for income growth or consumer spending,\u201d Naroff Economic Advisors president Joel Naroff said after the report.\n\nBut the important news remains that the president and his administration committed so many felonies we\u2019ve learned about this week and last that it\u2019s plausible to examine whether the White House \u2014 the White House! \u2014 meets the elements of a Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act prosecution.\n\nCorruption is bad for economies, usually sooner rather than later. We see it already.\n\nHead scratchers\n\nIt\u2019s a funny jobs report, riddled with head scratchers, many of them candidates for revision next month. Some of them include:\n\n\u2022 The economy only added 114,000 private sector jobs, a distinctly weak performance. The other 22,000 were in government, with a small shrinkage in federal hiring and 24,000 new state and local hires.\n\n\u2022 Wage growth turned negative, if only by a penny per hour. The 2.9% year-over-year wage gain was the weakest in a year. \u201cA Fed cut in October is squarely in play given the weaker trend in job growth and limited inflationary pressure,\u201d economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote.\n\nAlso read: One puzzle in the jobs report: a wage slowdown as unemployment rate falls to a near-50-year low\n\n\u2022 According to the report, 10,000 new jobs in September were for school teachers. Yes, it\u2019s September, but seasonal adjustments are supposed to correct for that effect. The notion that we\u2019re suddenly spending more to hire more teachers isn\u2019t backed up by much more evidence.\n\n\u2022 More than new 13,000 jobs were in amusements, gambling and recreation? Don\u2019t believe it, and a wave of casino hiring isn\u2019t a great sign anyway. It\u2019s also dubious that the half-million job \u201ctransit and ground transportation\u201d industry added 10,500 jobs \u2014 unless Uber UBER, -1.26% went on a hiring spree (Uber\u2019s actually eyeing layoffs).\n\nThe most bullish economic news is that hiring in industries that depend on discretionary consumer spending is mostly strong. Restaurants added 1,500 workers, home-improvement contractors added nearly 4,000, and car dealers added almost 5,000, even as auto manufacturers cut back.\n\nInvestors who think consumers will prevent a 2020 recession got some ammunition.\n\nAs pure short-term economics, not a lot changed. The basic picture holds: Growth is slowing, manufacturing appears to be heading into a downturn, and more evidence points away from a 2020 recession than toward one.\n\nThe durability of consumers is pretty palpable right now. The warning sign on consumers is the wage number. If that pattern sustains, consumers will slow down spending.\n\nIt\u2019s corruption\n\nPull the camera back, and the jobs report isn\u2019t close to the week\u2019s most important news.\n\nIt\u2019s Ukraine, stupid. And China. Maybe Italy and Australia, too.\n\nRead in English, the edited memo of Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president is extortion, plain and simple. Texts between American diplomats that became public on Thursday also make clear that they, at least, believed that the president was conditioning military aid to help Ukraine resist Russian aggression on finding allegations, false or not, to make about former Vice President Joe Biden, a candidate to replace Trump. That\u2019s illegal. On its face.\n\nThe same is true for the president\u2019s public urging of China to investigate Biden and his son, who have not been accused of any crime, at a time when the U.S. and China are engaged in trade talks. There are also published reports that the president has leaned on Australia, and that Attorney General William Barr has been in Italy trying to dig up dirt on Biden.\n\nThe RICO Act labels as a corrupt enterprise any group or association that commits two or more criminal acts in a specified period of time. (A 2016 Justice Department manual explicitly includes government agencies). Extortion is specifically included. So is wire fraud, including, potentially, the text sent by Trump\u2019s ambassador to the European Union (and million-dollar donor) telling other diplomats to stop talking about Ukraine via text, and asserting the president was not tying Ukraine aid to illegal campaign interference.\n\nThe economic point\n\nLawyers will figure out impeachment later. The economic point is this:\n\nThe wobbliest part of the U.S. economy, manufacturing, is the one most affected by trade, the area where our corrupt president has the most leeway to act autonomously.\n\nThe markets\u2019 biggest problem is that they don\u2019t trust Trump. They wobble when he makes pronouncements about trade. Companies trim investment in capital spending, and slow hiring in manufacturing, because of their inability to predict what he\u2019ll do next.\n\nThe jobs report shows signs of what a breakdown in the rule of law does.
