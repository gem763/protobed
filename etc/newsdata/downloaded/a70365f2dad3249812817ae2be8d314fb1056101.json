I think that he is restoring the steady professionalism that\u2019s been a hallmark of the FBI. I really appreciate his leadership there.\u201d\n\nWhen it was first reported that Durham\u2019s investigation had evolved into a criminal probe, Democrats claimed the DOJ was essentially being weaponized against Trump\u2019s political opponents.\n\n\u201cThese reports, if true, raise profound new concerns that the Department of Justice under AG Barr has lost its independence and become a vehicle for President Trump\u2019s political revenge,\u201d said a joint statement by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., released last Thursday. \u201cIf the Department of Justice may be used as a tool of political retribution, or to help the President with a political narrative for the next election, the rule of law will suffer new and irreparable damage.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Sen. Mark Warner also spoke out against Durham\u2019s probe, saying Friday that the Senate Intelligence Committee \u201cis wrapping up a three-year bipartisan investigation, and we\u2019ve found nothing remotely justifying this.\u201d\n\nHe called on Barr to testify before Congress.\n\nIn response to such criticism, Barr said, \"It wouldn't be appropriate at this stage for me to discuss the Durham investigation.\" He said he'd \"certainly inform the public and Congress\" when possible.\n\nAs for the direction of the investigation, he said: \"We\u2019ll let the chips fall where they may.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe also responded to questions about a recent trip to Italy he took in relation to Durham\u2019s investigation, explaining that they visited to help Durham establish ties with countries that might have helpful information.\n\n\u201cWell, some of the countries that John Durham thought might have some information that would be helpful to the investigation wanted preliminarily to talk to me about the scope of the investigation, the nature of the investigation, and how I intended to handle confidential information, and so forth,\u201d Barr said. \u201cSo I initially discussed these matters with those countries and introduced them to John Durham and established a channel by which Mr. Durham can obtain assistance from those countries.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE -- Attorney General Bill Barr, in an interview with Fox News, defended the independence and integrity of the politically contentious probe being led by U.S. Attorney John Durham into the handling of the Russia investigation \u2013 while taking a swipe at James Comey\u2019s past leadership of the FBI.", "authors": ["Jake Gibson", "Jake Gibson Is A Producer Working At The Fox News Washington Bureau Who Covers Politics", "Law Enforcement", "Intelligence Issues."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/10/28/694940094001_6098475697001_6098477609001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
