He finished with three TD passes and completed 23-of-33 pass attempts for 305 yards.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\nStory continues\n\n\n\n", "description": "Aaron Rodgers has made many ridiculous throws in his career, but his go-ahead TD throw against the Chiefs will go down as one of his finest.", "authors": ["Terez Paylor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wsZ3zhv_6iStD7ggXlD8Ag--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/ROVrIFN9eCYnPxjDad.KsA--~B/aD0xOTEwO3c9Mjg2NTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/005f1040-f92f-11e9-b2ee-3be8ae0aa42d", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
