Flynn has been awaiting sentencing since then, and even told the sentencing judge in 2018 that he would not claim FBI misconduct, despite growing evidence that they had departed from normal practice in interviewing him and had only completed their \u201c302\u201d \u2014 the report of their meeting \u2014 after he had already been forced to resign from his position in the administration over the allegations.\n\nThe new defense filing alleges that the government is refusing to turn over a mountain of potentially exculpatory evidence, some of which has begun to emerge in the media \u2014 either through leaks or through ongoing inquiries into the origins of the probe into alleged Russia \u201ccollusion\u201d with the Trump campaign, later found not to exist.\n\nThat evidence, Flynn\u2019s legal team alleges, includes an apparent admission by former FBI lawyer Lisa Page \u2014 who resigned after being discovered having an affair with agent Peter Strzok, with whom she shared anti-trump texts \u2014 that she had edited the 302 \u2014 something that she allegedly told FBI investigators she did not recall, the filing states.\n\nThe edits, the filing alleges, were substantive: they included a claim that Flynn said he did not discuss any sanctions with the Russian ambassador. Flynn\u2019s lawyers allege he merely told the FBI he did not recall, and that the claim he said otherwise was added only after a transcript of his discussion with the ambassador had been leaked to the media.\n\nIn a footnote, the filing adds that former FBI general counsel James Baker \u201cis believed to be the person who illegally leaked the transcript of Mr. Flynn\u2019s calls to [Washington Post reporter David] Ignatius.\u201d It also alleges that former National Intelligence Director James Clapper told Ignatius to \u201ctake the kill shot on Flynn.\u201d\n\nThe filing emerged hours after reports that the Department of Justice had shifted its investigation of the origins of the Russia probe to become a criminal investigation under the supervision of prosecutor John H. Durham.\n\nFlynn was subject to surveillance \u2014 allegedly in response to claims that he might have violated the Logan Act, an archaic and rarely-enforced law barring private citizens from diplomacy \u2014 during President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition to office. Flynn\u2019s name was then unmasked in the transcript of his telephone conversation with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, which was then leaked illegally.\n\nFlynn\u2019s subsequent prosecution for lying to the FBI was key to the \u201cRussia collusion\u201d theory, later found to have no substance after a lengthy investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller that took nearly two years to complete.\n\nCritics have alleged that Mueller may have induced Flynn to plead guilty by suggesting that the government had more evidence of \u201cRussia collusion\u201d than it actually did.\n\nThis story is developing.\n\nJoel B.
