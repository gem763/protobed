Deloitte partners are expected to retire at 62, while PwC partners understand they will have to step down from as young as 55.\n\nMr Bowd, who has long experience in dealing with retiring and retired partners, said they could have an inflated sense of their worth to the market and that reality was often a shock.\n\n\"When partners are forced to retire from professional services firms due to age restrictions they still have much to offer,\" he said.\n\nMany don\u2019t start their preparation ... until too close to their retirement date. \u2014 Warick Bowd, Derwent executive search specialist\n\n\"Many seek board roles and expect they will find these roles relatively quickly, but the reality is that this can take significant time and many don\u2019t start their preparation to transition until too close to their retirement date.\n\n\"Although they have expertise in their particular fields, some also lack a contemporary knowledge of the things boards now often look for in non-executive directors, such as digital awareness and how to oversee a healthy corporate culture.\"\n\nThe firms all run programs to assist retiring partners with the transition, where the variety of options are discussed. Former big four partners have moved into corporate roles, joined another firm or boutique outfit or even become independent consultants. In some cases firms will allow a retiring partner to retain clients after they have left.\n\nMr Bowd recommended that partners seeking board positions begin preparing years before they retire by looking for directorships at not-for-profit outfits, and completing the company director's course at the Australian Institute of Company Directors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Partners in the big four typically can\u2019t sit on publicly listed boards while still in the partnership, so our advice to those aspiring for future board roles is to try and get involved with not-for-profit boards and advisory boards for private companies where this is permitted,\" he said.\n\n\"Aside from board roles, we also encourage retiring partners to think about the concept of a portfolio career, where board roles may be a part of a broad range of things they can do including contract consulting, mentoring others [and so on].\"", "description": "High-end consultants think they'll easily find lucrative new roles such as directorships, but many are lacking digital and cultural skills.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.16%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e4c7e62de35b9d9d78a21575f9001afe4b052d8e", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
