He called Hispanics \u201cincredible people\u201d and said they supported a border wall. (Tom Brenner/Reuters)\n\nPresident Trump, whose crackdown on illegal immigration and incendiary rhetoric about Latinos have been hallmarks of his first term, made a direct appeal here Monday night to Hispanic voters to secure him a second term.\n\nAt a rollicking rally in New Mexico, his first visit as president to this border state controlled by Democrats, Trump infused his typical campaign rally attacks on political opponents and the media with sweeping declarations of Latino support for his reelection.\n\n\u201cYesterday marked the beginning of the Hispanic Heritage Month \u2014 who\u2019s Hispanic here?\u201d Trump asked the cheering crowd of several thousand supporters at the Santa Ana Star Center on the outskirts of Albuquerque, many of whom waved \u201cLatinos for Trump\u201d signs. \u201cIncredible people . . . we have much to celebrate.\u201d\n\nAfter touting the low unemployment rate for Hispanic Americans as well as for all Americans, Trump said, \u201cWe\u2019re working night and day to deliver a future of limitless opportunity for our nation\u2019s Hispanic American citizens, including many extraordinary Mexican Americans.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s proclamations belie the reality measured in public-opinion surveys, which show overwhelming majorities of Hispanic Americans disapproving of his job performance. Trump\u2019s approval rating among Hispanic adults nationally stood at 25 percent in a Washington Post-ABC News poll this month, with 67 percent disapproving. That is 13 points lower than Trump\u2019s overall job approval rating of 38 percent.\n\nIn head-to-head matchups with Democratic front-runner Joe Biden, combined Post-ABC polls in September and early July found Trump trailing 71 percent to 26 percent, which is similar to his losing margin among Hispanics in his 2016 race against Hillary Clinton, according to exit polling.\n\nHispanics make up almost half of the population in New Mexico, the highest share of any state, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nTrump lost New Mexico to Clinton by eight percentage points, and since 1992 a Republican has won the state only once in a presidential election.\n\nTrump\u2019s advisers insist that he is serious about contesting the state and expanding his appeal with minority voters, in part on the strength of the economy.\n\n\u201cWe will campaign for every vote, and we will win the great state of New Mexico,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe Democrats want to completely annihilate New Mexico\u2019s economy. . . . The Democrats will never get the chance because New Mexico will never give them that chance.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats here say that is nonsense.\n\n\u201cNew Mexicans certainly don\u2019t approve of pulling families apart or putting kids in cages,\u201d New Mexico Democratic Party Chairwoman Marg Elliston said. \u201cWe\u2019re ready for leadership that celebrates our immigrant communities, not demonizes them.\u201d\n\nIn his rally remarks here, Trump hit familiar notes, including a pledge to uphold Second Amendment gun rights, which drew some of the most sustained applause of the night.\n\n\u201cI will never, ever allow [Democrats] to take away your sacred right to keep and bear arms,\u201d Trump said, overstating the gun policy proposals of most Democrats.\n\nTrump also forcefully defended the character and integrity of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, calling him \u201ca great, brilliant man\u201d and urging resignations at the New York Times, which reported over the weekend a new accusation of sexual abuse against Kavanaugh.\n\nTrump predicted that he would win a far greater share of the Hispanic vote than polls currently suggest because of, not in spite of, his hard-line immigration policies.\n\n\u201cThe Hispanic Americans understand they don\u2019t want criminals going across the border, they don\u2019t want people taking their jobs, they want security, and they want the wall,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey want the wall.\u201d\n\nTrump singled out in the audience one of his higher-profile television boosters, Steve Cortes, complimenting him on his CNN appearances. \u201cHe happens to be Hispanic, but I\u2019ve never quite figured it out because he looks more like a WASP than I do. . . . But I\u2019ll tell you what, there is nobody that loves this country more or Hispanics more than Steve Cortes.\u201d\n\nTrump then addressed Cortes and asked: \u201cWho do you like more: The country or Hispanics? He says the country. I don\u2019t know, I may have to go for the Hispanics, to be honest. We love our Hispanics!\u201d\n\nThebault reported from Washington.
