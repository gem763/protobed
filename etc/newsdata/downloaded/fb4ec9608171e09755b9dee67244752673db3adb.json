The trial is part of DOT's UAS Integration Pilot Program.\n\nWing, which is running the project with Virginia Tech's Mid-Atlantic Aviation Partnership, is collaborating with FedEx Express, Walgreens and the local Virginia retailer Sugar Magnolia. The project is the first to receive approval from the FAA for commercial drone package delivery in the United States.\n\nChristiansburg resident Paul Sensmeier ordered a pink vest from Dick's Sporting Goods as a birthday gift for his wife. The last mile of that FedEx Express delivery, which would normally be via truck, was done with a Wing drone. Michael and Kelly Collver ordered tissues, water, Tylenol and cough drops from Walgreens.\n\nThe trial will continue in the coming months, and Wing and MAAP plan to keep working with Christiansburg.\n\n\"As exciting as this launch is, what\u2019s going to be most rewarding is seeing how the community responds to this technology as it becomes part of the fabric of everyday life,\" said MAAP director Mark Blanks in a statement.", "description": "Residents in Christiansburg, Virginia had a birthday present and Tylenol dropped on their lawns via drone this afternoon, the first deliveries of their kind in the United States.
