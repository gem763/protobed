In the most recent quarter, Rep. Ryan only raised $425,000 and ended the quarter with less than $160,000 cash on hand.\n\nThe combination of the low fundraising and polling kept Ryan off the debate stages over the last several months, having failed to qualify for the third and fourth debates.\n\nRyan said he was \"proud of this campaign\" and thanked his wife and children \"for picking up the slack while I've been on the campaign trail.\"\n\nRyan will seek re-election for his congressional seat instead.", "description": "Rep.
