She took off her shoes and socks before entering the water.\n\nBy the time her mother and the others realized she was gone, she was already in the water and completely submerged.\n\nThis is the man-made pond the girl drowned in on Sunday after wandering out of the temple. She took off her socks and shoes then got in the water and was found around 15 minutes later, unresponsive\n\nThey waded into the water and searched for her for several minutes before pulling her body out.\n\nThey pulled her out and, on the way to the hospital, the child regained her pulse but she was pronounced dead later.\n\nThere were confused reports initially that the girl was part of a 'class' and that she'd fallen into a man-made well.\n\nHarris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said the girl had autism. He also said it is common for children with autism to be drawn to water.\n\nThe child's family has not been identified.\n\nAccording to The Houston Chronicle, she and her family moved to Texas last year from California.\n\nShe had been in the water for 15 minutes before she was found.\n\nThe congregation was a mix of worshipers from Cambodia, Laos and Thailand.\n\n'Everyone was crying,' one told The Chronicle.", "description": "The child, who has not been named, had gone to the Wat Angkorchum Cambodian Buddhist Temple in Houston, Texas, with her mother on Sunday.", "authors": ["Jennifer Smith For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/19/19705160-0-image-a-41_1571077593115.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
