The doctors can't believe I can walk, let alone ride my motorbike, so I am glad I can walk,' Mr Ballard told the Brisbane Times.\n\nRussell suffered multiple fractures to his hips, spine and ribs in a workplace accident in 2017\n\n'I have no sexual function any more, well it is very, very reduced. Lucky I have a very understanding wife.\n\n'I get flashbacks pretty well every day, my head ... everything goes back to it, just seeing myself squashed and thinking 'this isn't good'.\n\nThe court judgement published online this week states Culverthorpe Pty had no formal protocol for trenching and pipe laying.\n\n'The risk of trench collapse was foreseeable and the risk of serious injury or death as a result was also foreseeable,' the judgement states.\n\nThe former cotton farm worker (pictured) recently returned to work as a school bus driver\n\n'Mr Ballard, inexperienced in trench excavations, sustained serious injuries requiring surgery and hospitalisation for a month. He was supervised by persons who had received no specific training in trench excavations.'\n\nNo conviction was recorded.\n\n'In this case, while the offence is serious, it is not so serious as to warrant the recording of a conviction for a first offence committed by the defendant who is a good corporate citizen and otherwise of good character,' the judgement concluded.", "description": "Russell Ballard, then 48, was laying irrigation pipes for a closed railway line on a farm near Toowoomba in Queensland's south east in May 2017 when a wall  fell on him.", "authors": ["Kylie Stevens For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/05/20362054-0-image-a-2_1572415184144.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
