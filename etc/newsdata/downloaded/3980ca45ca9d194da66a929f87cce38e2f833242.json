He helped Poe Dameron escape the First Order \u2013 picking up the nickname Finn in doing so \u2013 and then sought his own freedom alongside Rey and BB-8. Finn helped the Resistance destroy Starkiller Base, but had to decide his true loyalties: Would he continue to fight alongside the Resistance\u2019s soldiers, or seek to reunite with Rey and flee the galactic conflict? At first Finn tried to flee the war, but a mission alongside Rose Tico convinced him that he had to commit himself to the Resistance\u2019s cause.", "description": "No one's ever really gone...
