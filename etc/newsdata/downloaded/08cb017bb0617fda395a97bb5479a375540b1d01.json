He told a parable to those who had been invited, noticing how they were choosing the places of honor at the table. \u201cWhen you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet, do not recline at table in the place of honor. A more distinguished guest than you may have been invited by him, and the host who invited both of you may approach you and say, \u2018Give your place to this man,\u2019 and then you would proceed with embarrassment to take the lowest place. Rather, when you are invited, go and take the lowest place so that when the host comes to you he may say, \u2018My friend, move up to a higher position.\u2019 Then you will enjoy the esteem of your companions at the table. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.\u201d Then he said to the host who invited him, \u201cWhen you hold a lunch or a dinner, do not invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or your wealthy neighbors, in case they may invite you back and you have repayment. Rather, when you hold a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind; blessed indeed will you be because of their inability to repay you. For you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.\u201d\n\nOne of my favorite novelty songs of my youth was Mac Davis\u2019 It\u2019s Hard to Be Humble. The hilarious lyrics as well as his folksy delivery exposed the vanity of pride and the absolute blindness it produces. \u201cSome folks say that I\u2019m egotistical,\u201d Davis sings at one point, \u201chell, I don\u2019t even know what that means! I guess it has something to do with the way that I fill out my skin-tight blue jeans.\u201d Davis\u2019 live audience roars with laughter throughout the song as its over-the-top depiction of useless pride resonates with everyone. It\u2019s perhaps one of the quintessential human experiences.\n\nUsually, though, it\u2019s much more difficult to identify than in the first-person voice of Davis\u2019 song. We all struggle with pride, even the least self-assuming of us. Human society was for millennia organized on the principle of nobility, and even in this egalitarian era still organized somewhat on the basis of pride. That is useful to an extent, as long as it\u2019s based on accomplishment and capability more than reputation and popularity \u2014 and is not used to exalt one\u2019s existence at the expense of others.\n\nIn The Screwtape Letters, C.S. Lewis noted the subtle nuances of pride. There is no danger in acknowledging good work done by one\u2019s self as long as one does not set himself apart for having accomplished it, Lewis notes in Letter 14:\n\nThe Enemy wants to bring the man to a state of mind in which he could design the best cathedral in the world, and know it to be the best, and rejoice in the fact, without being any more (or less) or otherwise glad at having done it than he would be if it had been done by another. The Enemy wants him, in the end, to be so free from any bias in his own favour that he can rejoice in his own talents as frankly and gratefully as in his neighbour\u2019s talents\u2014or in a sunrise, an elephant, or a waterfall. He wants each man, in the long run, to be able to recognise all creatures (even himself) as glorious and excellent things.\n\nThat\u2019s no easy feat in today\u2019s social-media-driven self-promoting world. Our culture craves rank just as earlier cultures strove to be added to the nobility. The pursuit of rank descends into absurdity and twists values as well, promoting the inconsequential at the expense of the truly necessary. It\u2019s no longer enough to build the world\u2019s best cathedral, but taking the world\u2019s best selfie within the cathedral is what brings fame and rank these days.\n\nAnd yes, I\u2019m well aware of my Twitter bio.\n\nThis was just as true in Jesus\u2019 day, and as He explains in this Gospel reading, equally vacuous in the end. Man\u2019s judgment is not God\u2019s judgment, Jesus repeatedly preaches, and uses this teaching as a way to emphasize the point. The problem of pride goes beyond self-regard but also in how we commoditize those around us in order to maintain or increase our self-love.\n\nJesus starts off with a humorous situation in which a guest at a wedding assumes a place of honor without having been invited to it. How embarrassing will it be, Jesus teaches, when the host has to tell you to go to Table 19 in front of everyone else? That\u2019s the Mac Davis example, if you will; a person who is so full of himself that he can\u2019t possibly perceive of anyone more important than himself. He\u2019s a buffoon, a figure of ridicule who will serve as an example in novelty songs for millennia.\n\nThe second example is more insidious, however. Jesus speaks of those who use pride and rank for aggrandizement. They invite people to their parties in order to oblige them into reciprocity, thereby increasing their own social rank. They are seeking payback \u2014 a kind of social extortion by which they can manipulate people for their own selfish benefits.\n\nAll of this \u2014 all of it \u2014 rests on human judgment of worth, not the Lord\u2019s. It mainly has to do with material benefits, not spiritual. And in the end, Jesus teaches, it\u2019s all utter nonsense. God does not value celebrity nor wealth; He values faith and virtue. Our ability to judge others is so limited by our own sin and limited perspective that we cannot possibly rank ourselves rationally, let alone others. It is that realization that represents the true basis of humility, rather than any knee-jerk false self-disparagement that attempts to pretend at humility.\n\nLewis also has Screwtape\u2019s perspective on that impulse, and on the true nature of vanity and pride:\n\nThe Enemy will also try to render real in the patient\u2019s mind a doctrine which they all profess but find it difficult to bring home to their feelings\u2014the doctrine that they did not create themselves, that their talents were given them, and that they might as well be proud of the colour of their hair. But always and by all methods the Enemy\u2019s aim will be to get the patient\u2019s mind off such questions, and yours will be to fix it on them. Even of his sins the Enemy does not want him to think too much: once they are repented, the sooner the man turns his attention outward, the better the Enemy is pleased[.]\n\nVanity and pride put us at the center of the universe rather than the Lord. False humility does the same. That makes us the man who attends the feast by first sitting at the place of honor, until the host has to remind him that he\u2019s not the center of the universe. Jesus exhorts disciples to look outside the circle of those who we might exploit to maintain our delusion of grandeur, in order to ground ourselves in the reality of a fallen world that this delusion creates.\n\nOnly then can we open our eyes to the Lord as the center of all things, and only then can we experience true humility \u2014 and offer whatever gifts we have to His purpose. Stripping away that self-deception is among the most difficult tasks we have on the path to salvation, but a great welcome of equals at the Feast awaits us when we succeed.\n\nThe front-page image is \u201cSupper in Emmaus,\u201d c. 1560 by Paolo Veronese.
