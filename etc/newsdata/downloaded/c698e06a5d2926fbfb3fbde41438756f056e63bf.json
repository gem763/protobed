The 56-year-old actress released the tell-all on Tuesday after several weeks of candid promotion.\n\nIn the 272-page memoir, Moore opens up about her marriage to actor Ashton Kutcher. The pair got together in 2003 and married in 2005. Eventually, Kutcher filed for divorce in late 2012, finalizing it in 2013.\n\nIn her book, Moore doesn\u2019t hold back, telling the good, the bad and the ugly about her relationship with Kutcher. Here are the highlights:\n\nOn Meeting Kutcher:\n\n\u201cHe was 25. I was 40. But I\u2019m telling you: we couldn\u2019t feel it. we were totally in sync, from our very first conversation\u2026 When I met Ashton it almost felt like a do-over, like I could just go back in time and experience what it was like to be young, with him -- much more so than I\u2019d ever been able to experience it when I was actually in my twenties.\u201d\n\nOn Her Sex Life With Kutcher:\n\n\u201cI felt completely safe with Ashton, which made it possible to connect sexually in a way I\u2019d never experienced before.\u201d\n\nView photos Gregg DeGuire/FilmMagic More\n\nOn How Public Their Relationship Became:\n\n\u201c[Ashton] later confessed that if he\u2019d fully grasped what it would be like, he might never have gotten involved with me.\u201d\n\nOn His Involvement in Her Relapse:\n\n\u201cOne night, we put some clothes on and went out to dinner. Ashton was enjoying a glass of good red wine when he said, \u2018I don\u2019t know if alcoholism is a real thing. I think it\u2019s all about moderation.\u2019 I wanted to be that girl. The girl who could have a glass of wine at dinner, or do a tequila shot at a party. In my mind, Ashton wanted that too. So I tried to become that: a fun, normal girl. I didn\u2019t think, This is a kid in his 20s who has no idea what he\u2019s talking about. I didn\u2019t think, I have nearly two decades of sobriety under my belt, and that\u2019s a huge accomplishment. Instead, I cast about for justifications for his argument. Plenty of people party too much in their youth and then develop a perfectly healthy relationship with alcohol, I told myself\u2026 Back in our room, I took a beer from the minibar.\u201d\n\nView photos Victor Boyko/GC/Getty Images More\n\nOn His Proposal Six Weeks After Finding Out She Was Pregnant:\n\n\u201cHe asked me to go down to the beach to watch the sunset, and then he got down on one knee and presented me with a beautiful vintage Cartier ring. I was overwhelmed. I told him I needed to think about it. I didn\u2019t want him to feel he had to marry me just because I was pregnant. But I loved him. And I knew he loved me. And I knew this baby would cement our family, bond us all on the deepest level. By the end of the night, I\u2019d said yes.\u201d\n\nOn Her Miscarriage:\n\n\u201cAlmost six months into my pregnancy, right at the moment when we were going to start telling everyone, we went to the doctor\u2019s office. He did his usual ultrasound, but this time, there was no heartbeat. I registered the deadly silence -- instead of the now-familiar thumpthump!thumpthump! Of Chaplin\u2019s little heart -- and saw the look on my doctor\u2019s face. If you have never lost a baby, you may think of a miscarriage as not that big a deal. It\u2019s hard to remember, but I\u2019m sure I used to feel that way too: like it was a bit of medical misfortune, a disappointing but not devastating setback. But when it is your baby, who you already love and think of as a member of your immediate family, it doesn\u2019t feel like a minor defeat. It feels like your child has died. I was decimated. I shifted into survival mode\u2026 Ashton did his best to connect with me in my grief. He tried to be there for me during the miscarriage, but he couldn\u2019t really understand what I was feeling. First of all, he hadn\u2019t carried this baby. And second, he was in his twenties at the time: he wasn\u2019t remotely late to the game of fatherhood. His possibilities were not running out, far from it. I was suddenly acutely aware that mine were.\u201d", "description": "The 56-year-old actress opens up about her complicated relationship with her ex-husband.", "authors": ["Rachel Mcrady"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.9VaW1DhsEu07K8WC8WvGw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/bc4c9bf389fb1af09d128a72e72cf31c", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
