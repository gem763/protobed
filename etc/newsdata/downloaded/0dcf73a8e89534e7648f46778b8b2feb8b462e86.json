But until Blizzard reverses their decision on @blitzchungHS I am giving up playing Classic WoW, which I helped make and helped convince Blizzard to relaunch. There will be no Mark of Kern guild after all. Let me explain why I am #BoycottBlizzard \u2014 Mark Kern (@Grummz) October 9, 2019\n\nIn the messages that followed, the ethnically Chinese original World of Warcraft developer laid out his reason for joining the Blizzard boycott. He said that he \u201cwatched China slowly take over as the dominant investing force in gaming and movies over the years,\u201d citing U.S. reluctance to invest in the gaming industry as the reason why China has gained \u201cunprecedented influence\u201d over entertainment media.\n\nKern also spoke publicly for the first time regarding a \u201c2 million dollar kickback bribe to take an investment from China\u201d he claimed to have refused just before \u201cremoved from a company I founded (after Blizzard).\u201d He further said that he has witnessed other \u201cAmerican company reps in China [offered] similar bribes to get licenses for large AAA titles.\u201d\n\nHis conclusion was bleak:\n\n\u2026We are in a situation where unlimited Communist money dictates our American values. We censor our games for China, we censor our movies for China. Now, game companies are silencing voices for freedom and democracy. China is dictating that the world be authoritarian.\n\n\u201cBut enough is enough,\u201d Kern said. \u201cI stand with Hong Kong, and I oppose Blizzard\u2019s obvious and laughably transparent fear of China,\u201d calling for the entertainment behemoth to \u201cgrow the spine it used to have.\u201d Unfortunately, that possibility seems remote for the communist-owned video game corporation.\n\nKern is not alone. In fact, even a few brave current employees of the company, which is partially owned by Chinese entertainment company Tencent, have decided to take a stand. Less than 24 hours after unidentified personnel reportedly covered the \u201cThink Globally\u201d and \u201cEvery Voice Matters\u201d from a corporate display at the company\u2019s offices, a small group of employees held an \u201cumbrella protest\u201d in support of the Hong Kong protesters.\n\nA picture of the protest, uploaded to image site \u201cimgur\u201d was posted to the r/Hearthstone fan subreddit, after Blizzard shut down their own official community on popular content aggregation platform Reddit. While Blizzard later brought r/Blizzard back online, moderators restricted all discussion of the \u201cBlitzchung\u201d controversy to a single thread.\n\nSupport for the protesters among commenters on the r/Hearthstone thread was immediate and vociferous. \u201cI fully respect this,\u201d user \u201cisthisdutch\u201d proclaimed on the top-voted comment. \u201cStanding up against the company which pays your bills takes some serious courage. It\u2019s important you do this. Thank you for stepping up.\u201d\n\nAmong those comments were words from those even closer to the situation. \u201cI would like to express a heart-felt thank you from Hong Kong,\u201d said one commenter. \u201cI wish everyone who believes in freedom and democracy can live without fear and exercise their freedom of speech.\u201d", "description": "Mark Kern published a long, sad thread to Twitter on Tuesday, calling out their decisions -- and their Chinese owner, Tencent.", "authors": ["Nate Church"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/cosplayers-from-Blizzards-World-of-Warcraft-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
