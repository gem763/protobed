Get caught up and ready to get on with the weekend, because it\u2019s hard keeping pace in a digital traffic jam.\n\nHere\u2019s what you missed while you were away.\n\nUpcoming electric crate engines promise plug-and-play installation\n\nIt\u2019s been some time coming, but it seems automotive DIY-ers may finally be getting some viable options for electric crate engines. The V8-shaped single- and dual-motor EV conversion kits on the way from the California-based startup Electric GT (EGT) will make 140 horsepower and 240 lb.-ft., and 240 horsepower and 340 lb.-ft., respectively.\n\nSwindon Powertrain in the U.K., meanwhile, is putting out another electric crate option that makes 110 horsepower and is small enough to fit in a Mini. You just have to find someplace to put the batteries.\n\nVolvo, Audi and Mercedes-Benz won\u2019t be attending the Montreal auto show\n\nEven with the Detroit auto show officially moving its time slot from January to June, Montreal\u2019s appeal is not strong enough for some European automakers to justify the winter journey to the City of Saints.\n\nFollowing the lead of Mercedes-Benz \u2013 which is abstaining from all North American auto shows this year \u2013 Volvo and Audi are also pulling out of appearances at 2020\u2019s LeSalon International de Montr\u00e9al. Volvo is also allegedly pulling the chute for Toronto\u2019s CIAS 2020.\n\nTesla\u2019s hideaway handles blamed in fiery fatal crash\n\n\u201cInaccessible door handles\u201d and \u201cno other ways to open the doors\u201d are what\u2019s being blamed in the death of a Florida resident and Tesla Model S owner. The 48-year-old man allegedly died of smoke inhalation when his vehicle caught fire following an accident, leaving him trapped inside. According to Consumer Reports, door handles are among the most commonly reported issues from Model S owners.\n\nLiberal\u2019s proposed luxury car tax stresses B.C. dealers\n\nThe recently re-elected Liberal government is proposing a new 10-per-cent luxury tax on vehicles, boats and aircraft priced over $100,000. The little-on-the-top will add yet another line to the price tag of luxury vehicles in British Columbia, which are already subject to a 15-per-cent provincial sales tax on vehicles from $125,000 to $149,999; and a 20-per-cent tax on those over $150,000.\n\nBlair Qualey, head of the New Car Dealers Association of B.C., told Automotive News Canada the luxury tax is \u201cvery concerning\u201d and the burden on buyers getting \u201cpretty difficult.\u201d\n\nMazda\u2019s first EV gets a touch of RX-8 throwback\n\nThe first electric mass-production Mazda, the MX-30, has arrived, with a smaller battery than most (likely good for about 200 km of range) and a gasoline-powered rotary range-extender \u2013 similar to that last found in the RX-8 \u2013 for trips beyond city limits.\n\nInside, it\u2019s some of Mazda\u2019s best work yet, with a clean dash and touchscreens for everything that could possibly use one. Look for the Mazda MX-30 in the second half of 2020, and look for the other hot debuts from this year\u2019s Tokyo auto show right here.\n\n", "description": "Volvo and Audi pull out of Montreal, two brands announce electric crate engines and the Liberals intro another luxury car tax", "authors": ["Hours Ago"], "top_image": "https://postmediadriving.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/img2.jpg?quality=80", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
