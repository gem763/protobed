Filing A Fraud Complaint", "language": "en", "text": "Photo: Shutterstock\n\nAs soon as you spot a transaction that doesn\u2019t seem to belong on your credit or debit card, your pulse starts to quicken, right? Your bank account balance is supposed to be predictable, your credit tab fluctuating only because you decided to swipe your card.\n\nBut when your account activity doesn\u2019t match up with what you expected, you should quickly determine what kind of problem you have on your hands. Knowing which type of problem you need to report can expedite the process of getting your account straightened out.\n\nWhen to dispute a charge\n\nWe have more payment options than ever before, but none of them are error-proof. You should file a dispute in the event of a billing mistake that you can\u2019t manage to resolve with the retailer directly.\n\nHere are some common examples of activity you can dispute if necessary:\n\nYou were overcharged\n\nYou were charged multiple times for the same purchase\n\nThe product or service you received wasn\u2019t what was advertised, or your order never arrived\n\nYou returned an item, but haven\u2019t received the refund you were promised\n\nYou might be able to do this while logged in to your account. If not, you may need to notify your financial institution in writing. Your bank or credit card issuer should confirm it received your dispute within 30 days, and provide a resolution within two billing cycles.\n\nFiling a dispute requires some patience, so if you can tell that a billing error is just a fluke or you\u2019ve already battled a company\u2019s returns department, be prepared to wait for your bank or card issuer to investigate the problem.\n\nWhen to file a fraud complaint\n\nIf you notice charges you didn\u2019t make, then it\u2019s time to fast-track the process and head to the fraud department. Because thieves can act quickly, you want to shut down any potential for your accounts to be further compromised. If you notice unexplained charges before your card issuer or bank\u2019s fraud department detects them, pick up the phone as soon as you can and give them a call to flag the purchase.\n\nThe faster you can stop the fraudsters, the faster you can deal with locking down your financial accounts and your overall identity by checking your credit reports, freezing your credit and alerting your other financial institutions to potential fraud.", "description": "As soon as you spot a transaction that doesn\u2019t seem to belong on your credit or debit card, your pulse starts to quicken, right?
