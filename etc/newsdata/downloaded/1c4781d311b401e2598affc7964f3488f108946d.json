It\u2019s all just impact, impact, impact. It is painful to say the least.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get hit when I\u2019m boxing really. I would say there is 100 times more impact than in boxing because I\u2019m actually getting picked up and slammed onto a hard floor. I don\u2019t ever get that in boxing, ever.\n\n\u201cI can honestly tell you that if I spar for 10 or 12 rounds, I might get hit five times. In this you\u2019re getting impacted every day you train.\n\n(Image: WWE)\n\n\u201cAnyone who says wrestling is easier than boxing is full of s***. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.\n\n\u201cI thought I had a hard schedule boxing twice a year, being away in training camp for 10 weeks. These guys are away every day and wrestle five nights a week.\u201d\n\nA highly anticipated rematch with Deontay Wilder has been pencilled in for February 22 in Las Vegas, provided the WBC champion beats Luis Ortiz on November 23.\n\nAnd Fury has now confirmed that his wrestling career will not get in the way of him boxing on that suggested date, regardless of what happens to the big-punching American.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\nFury added: \u201cIf Wilder loses we will have to look for a new opponent for February 22nd.\n\n\u201cEither way, I\u2019ll be boxing on February 22 in Vegas, whether it\u2019s Wilder or not.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s for sure, providing I don\u2019t get run over in the meantime. Whether the cut is ok or not, I will still be fighting February 22 because that\u2019s what I do.\u201d", "description": "Tyson Fury has laughed off suggestions he has taken an easy route out of boxing by facing Braun Strowman", "authors": ["Declan Taylor", "Image", "Getty Images", "Wwe", "Action Images Via Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20586546.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_CKP_CHP_Tyson-Fury_5408JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
