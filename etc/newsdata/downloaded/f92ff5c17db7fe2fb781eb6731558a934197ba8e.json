This is a victory for a functioning judiciary and the rule of law, no matter who is President.\n\nTo review: On July 15, the Trump Administration moved to bar asylum claims from refugees who transited a third country, such as Mexico, without trying to stay there first.\n\nOn July 24, Judge Jon Tigar in Oakland, Calif., issued a sweeping injunction that blocked the asylum policy\u2019s enforcement nationwide.\n\nOn Aug. 16, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals narrowed that order to apply in its jurisdiction alone, saying Judge Tigar had \u201cfailed to discuss whether a nationwide injunction is necessary to remedy Plaintiffs\u2019 alleged harm.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 9, Judge Tigar reinstated his original order\u2019s unlimited scope, saying the plaintiffs in the case could get \u201ccomplete relief\u201d only if the policy were blocked entirely.\n\nOn Sept. 10, the Ninth Circuit reversed that reversal, issuing a stay of Judge Tigar\u2019s renewed injunction, pending further review.\n\nThis is no way to run a judiciary. In seven weeks, federal officials got five different directives: implement, stay, implement, stay, implement. The Ninth Circuit covers California and Arizona, but the other end of the Mexican border is 1,000 highway miles away, in Texas.\n\nNationwide injunctions are supposed to be extraordinary measures to prevent irreparable harm. Judge Tigar couldn\u2019t make a convincing argument. The plaintiffs are aid groups that help migrants. If the asylum rules took effect in Texas and New Mexico, what permanent injury would befall them? Judge Tigar\u2019s first example was that one of the nonprofits would have to \u201credesign its workshops and templates.\u201d\n\nHe also cited \u201cthe need to maintain uniform immigration policy,\u201d saying that bifurcated asylum rules would \u201ccreate major administrability issues.\u201d The executive branch didn\u2019t agree.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s intercession isn\u2019t about Mr. Trump\u2019s policy choices. It\u2019s about the proper operation of the lower courts. The Justices\u2019 unsigned order puts Judge Tigar\u2019s overdrawn injunctions on hold, awaiting Ninth Circuit and perhaps High Court consideration. Courts may eventually rule that Mr. Trump\u2019s asylum rules contravene the law. But until then the Supreme Court is right to rein in a judge who blocks the policy nationwide, with little evidence of irreparable harm and no respect for the President\u2019s authority or duty to protect the border.", "description": "A victory for the rule of law, no matter who is President.", "authors": ["The Editorial Board"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-106743/social", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
