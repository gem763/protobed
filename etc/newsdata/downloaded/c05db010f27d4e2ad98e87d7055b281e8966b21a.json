In it, McCabe claimed that his ouster last March \u2014 on the day he planned to retire after a 21-year career \u2014 was politically motivated retaliation driven by President Donald Trump, who was angry at McCabe\u2019s role in the investigation of his campaign\u2019s links to Russia.\n\n\u201cAndrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy,\u201d Trump tweeted on March 17, just two hours after then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions officially fired McCabe. \u201cSanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!\u201d\n\nMcCabe \u2014 who launched a counterintelligence investigation into Trump after he fired FBI Director James Comey in 2017 \u2014 said in an interview earlier this year that he believed his firing over \u201clack of candor\u201d was \u201ca perfect way to undermine my ability to, who knows, provide testimony against\u201d the president.\n\n\u201cI never, ever intentionally misled the FBI inspection division, the office of the inspector general, or any director of the FBI, ever,\u201d McCabe said at the time. \u201cNot ever. I completely reject the findings, the conclusions and the recommendations in that [inspector general] report.\u201d", "description": "The former FBI deputy director launched a counterintelligence probe into President Donald Trump after he fired James Comey in 2017.", "authors": ["Natasha Bertrand"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/9c/ce/05bd66644a0b87b6b9756214f60c/190912-andrew-mccabe-getty-773.jpg"}
