In total, GM is closing four plants in the U.S., in Maryland, Ohio and Michigan.\n\nThe automaker is currently in talks with the United Auto Workers union as a Sept. 14 contract expiration looms.\n\nMeanwhile, Thursday\u2019s meeting will also touch upon Trump\u2019s efforts to reverse fuel efficiency regulations put in place by former President Obama such as lowering gas prices and changing market conditions that have changed the landscape for both automotive consumers and makers alike.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nJust last month, Trump called executives at GM and Ford \u201cfoolish\u201d for not supporting his plans to repeal said Obama-era regulations.\n\nBoth GM and the White House declined to comment Wednesday on Thursday\u2019s upcoming meeting.", "description": "President Trump is meeting with General Motors CEO Mary Barra on Thursday to discuss a number of pressing issues within the auto industry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/c7d6f5d6e4904f2aa4065ec6822ee259-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
