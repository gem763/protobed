Care showed confidence and cheek to get the first try, catching Wales off guard when back pedalling in defence. His buzz is infectious. Long may it last.\n\nToo quick: Danny Care celebrates his early try for England after a quick tap penalty\n\nHIBBARD HOWLER\n\nRichard Hibbard will have nightmares about the throw which handed England the initiative for Luther Burrell\u2019s try. England forced the hooker to throw long because of their pressure on the Welsh line. It went so far that England stole possession and set up the attack which led to the try.\n\nCRYING SHAME\n\nMiss of the match came from Wales on 50 minutes. In a rare decent counter-attack, Jamie Roberts had George North outside in space. Perhaps he tried to copy Billy Twelvetrees\u2019 delicate try-making kick but North\u2019s anguished cry said it all.\n\nMissed opportunity: Jamie Roberts is wrapped up by Luther Burrell and Joe Launchbury\n\nFANTASTIC FARRELL\n\nIt may be boring but those downfield punts by Owen Farrell helped England\u2019s game management in that first half when Wales stayed in the match through Leigh Halfpenny\u2019s place kicking.\n\n\n\nThe pair did not miss a shot at goal but Farrell\u2019s overall kicking game was a key factor.\n\nOn the money: Owen Farrell's kicking display helped England on their way to victory at Twickenham\n\nLANCASTER'S BUILDING\n\nStuart Lancaster\u2019s triumphant punch said it all. His squad delivered and even late substitutions held up unlike in the Paris defeat by France.\n\n\n\nThis gives him something tangible \u2014 a first Triple Crown since 2003 \u2014 to show his team are making strides. Warren Gatland is too canny to be fazed by this, but Wales failed to spark. He took off Rhys Priestland for the last 18 minutes but did not have the same strength in depth.", "description": "Danny Care showed confidence and cheek to get the first try, catching Wales off guard when back pedalling in defence.
