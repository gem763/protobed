The deal, which was announced in July, was seen as a possible victory in the fight to manufacture less polluting cars in the face of a worsening climate crisis.\n\nUnder the deal, automakers will have to increase the fuel economy of their new vehicle fleets to nearly 50 miles per gallon by model year 2026 by reducing their greenhouse gas emissions by 3.7 percent each year. Automakers will also have flexibility in how they meet each year\u2019s emissions goal. The deal leaves room for other automakers to adopt the standards.\n\nThe deal reportedly \u201cenraged\u201d President Trump, who responded by summoning other automakers \u2014 General Motors, Fiat Chrysler, and Toyota \u2014 to the White House to pressure them to stick with the administration\u2019s plan. GM CEO Mary Barra met with Trump on Thursday, calling the meeting \u201cproductive and valuable.\u201d\n\nThe news of the antitrust probe is sure to ratchet up pressure on the entire auto industry that has been caught between the Trump administration, which wants to allow car companies to make dirtier vehicles, and California, which has the ability to set its own air standards since the Clean Air Act was established in 1970.\n\nThe White House has been trying to revoke California\u2019s right to establish its own rules alongside its attempt to lower the national emissions standards, which is part of a larger (and, so far, losing) fight with the state. A dozen states follow California\u2019s lead on emissions rules, and Canada has recently agreed as well. The EPA has called California\u2019s side deal with the four automakers \u201ca stunt.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for BMW confirmed that it received a letter from the Justice Department\u2019s antitrust division requesting information concerning the proposed agreement with California. \u201cWe look forward to responding to the Department of Justice to explain the planned CARB framework agreement and its benefits to consumers and the environment,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Justice Department declined to comment. Spokespersons for Ford, Honda, and Volkswagen did not immediately respond.\n\nUpdated September 6, 2019, 1:22 pm ET: Added comments from BMW.", "description": "The Justice Department has launched an antitrust investigation into four major automakers that struck an independent deal with California to reduce vehicle emissions.
