Joseph Comings, founder of the Art of Boardgaming, adds that the game is suitable for both introverts and extroverts alike and can be \u201clearned in a matter of minutes.\u201d The game recently won the prestigious 2019 Spiel des Jahres, or German Game of the Year, which evaluates board games based on their game concept, rule structure, layout, and design. The main objective, as the title suggests, is for players to help their teammates guess a word by suggesting \u201cjust one\u201d word as a hint. Which sounds easy enough, but, as Matthews warns: \u201cWatch out, duplicate words cancel each other out,\u201d so you need to be creative. A right answer scores your team one point, while a wrong answer docks two points, with the ultimate goal being to get as many points out of 13 as possible. This game takes about 20 minutes to play and is suitable for up to seven players.", "description": "We asked experts about the best board games for parties, including Just One, Monikers, Telestrations, Concept Kids: Animals, The Resistance, Codenames, Wits & Wagers, Spaceteam , Werewords, Junk Art Board Game: Plastic Edition and Funemployed.", "authors": ["Dominique Pariso"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/09/12/12-party-board-games-2.w1200.h630.jpg"}
