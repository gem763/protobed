Smart pajamas", "language": "en", "text": "Scientists at the University of Massachusetts have some exciting news to wake up the sleepy world of slumberwear.\n\n\u201cSmart pajamas\u201d \u2014 the ultimate in wearable night-time tech.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to bring this to market in the next couple of years,\u201d says UMass Professor Trisha Andrew, one of the scientists behind the product. \u201cIf Apple wants to contact us, we\u2019re certainly open to that. We\u2019ve been talking to a couple of companies.\u201d\n\nAndrew and her colleagues have just unveiled their new \u201cphysiological-sensing textiles\u201d and published the research behind them.\n\nThe idea of technology that monitors you even when you\u2019re asleep may sound Orwellian to some. But this could be a major health breakthrough, the researchers say.\n\nThe so-called smart pajamas \u00ador \u201cPhyjamas\u201d will be able to monitor your sleep in ways that the current generation of wearables can only imagine. The jammies can track not just your breathing and heart rates, but even the position in which you are sleeping.\n\n\u201cMore than half of the population entering middle age is likely to suffer some form of sleep disorder,\u201d says Andrew. Current \u201cwearables,\u201d such as the FitBit FIT, -2.65% and Apple AAPL, -0.81% Watch, are designed to track sleep, but the UMass technology will make it possible to monitor sleep quality without a wristband, researchers say, because the pajama fabric itself is woven with sensors that can track vital signs and body movements.\n\nSleep apnea, which means your breathing gets interrupted while you\u2019re asleep, is a major problem for adults but you can\u2019t track it from anyone\u2019s wrist, Andrew says. Until now the only ways to track someone\u2019s sleep properly was by watching them or filming them while they slept, she noted. It\u2019s costly and time consuming to do per person.\n\nThat also means we don\u2019t have much research data on how people are sleeping and why so many of us aren\u2019t getting a good night\u2019s sleep. Widespread use of \u201cPhyjamas\u201d could give researchers massive amounts of data to crunch.\n\nHigh-tech wearable materials aren\u2019t completely new, but it\u2019s a challenge making them as wearable as regular clothes, and making them adapt to real life. The key breakthrough at UMass was to develop materials that feel like regular clothes, and are so sensitive that they can monitor your vital signs even when worn loose.\n\nThe \u201cPhyjamas\u201d are made of a medium-weave \u201cmetallized cotton.\u201d \u201cIt feels just like a [regular] pajama,\u201d says Andrew. Meanwhile it can monitor your heart rate through your chest wall, even while resting lightly on your skin. The material could also lead to \u201csmart shirts\u201d and all the rest.\n\nThe process of manufacturing the materials is not very expensive, and the main cost of the prototypes was \u201cthe cost of the cotton,\u201d says Andrew.\n\nSee also: 5 ways lack of sleep could alter the course of your life\n\nSleep quality plays a significant role in people\u2019s health and even affects the overall economy. People who sleep less than six hours per night on average have a 13% higher mortality risk than those who sleeps between seven and nine hours, a RAND study found. Poor sleep leads to a less productive work day, costing the U.S. an estimated $411 billion each year, RAND found.\n\nThe \u201cPhyjamas\u201d development is just yet another breakthrough in a \u201chealth tech\u201d phenomenon that is transforming lives, and is very big business. Critics scoffed when Apple\u2019s Tim Cook unveiled the company\u2019s first Apple Watch four years ago, but the product has become steadily more popular, and it\u2019s a key part of the company\u2019s push into healthcare services.\n\nThe Apple Watch is arguably more of a healthcare product than a recreational gadget. It competes with a wave of rivals, from companies such as FitBit, Garmin GRMN, -0.51%, and Samsung SSNLF, +0.00% .\n\nPopulations are aging. Baby Boomers are retiring. Meanwhile society is grappling with the rocketing costs of healthcare. Smart devices that help us identify health issues early, so we can treat them before they get worse, are likely to play a big role in the fight.
