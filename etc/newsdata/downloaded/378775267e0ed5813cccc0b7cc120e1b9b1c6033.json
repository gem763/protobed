But there are already signs the economy is buckling under the weight of Trump's trade war.\n\nAs Axios' Dion Rabouin notes:\n\nThe U.S. manufacturing sector has been in recession all year, and the latest reading showed the industry falling into an outright contraction and at its weakest point since the financial crisis.\n\nU.S. services have been following manufacturing lower this year, with this week's data showing the sector at its weakest in 3 years.\n\nThe U.S. Treasury yield curve has been inverted since May \u2014 a near-perfect recession indicator economists at the Federal Reserve recently called \"the best summary measure\" of a looming economic downturn.\n\nIncome inequality in the U.S. grew last year to its highest level in more than 50 years, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures released this week.\n\nThough Trump has touted \"tremendous\" growth in the U.S. stock market since he became president, the S&P 500 is within spitting distance of where it traded around 2 years ago.\n\nBe smart: Trump already plans to blame Democrats and impeachment \u2014 and minimize his own responsibility \u2014 if legislation on trade, prescription drug prices, gun safety and infrastructure stalls this fall.", "description": "Smart, efficient news worthy of your time, attention, and trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
