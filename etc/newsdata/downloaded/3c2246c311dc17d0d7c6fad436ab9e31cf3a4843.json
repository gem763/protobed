But within 24 hours of the raid being announced, the president\u2019s penchant for embellishment had complicated the victory lap he was hoping to take.\n\nAnnouncing Baghdadi\u2019s death, Trump claimed that the ISIS leader was \u201cwhimpering\u201d and likened him to a \u201cdog\u201d in his attempt to escape U.S. forces. Five senior Trump administration officials who watched in real time as the president spoke on Sunday morning each told The Daily Beast that they had no idea where the president got the \u201cwhimpering and crying and screaming\u201d detail. Two officials recounted how after they heard that on Sunday, they immediately began messaging each other questions and comments like, \u201cuh where is he getting that?\u201d\n\nThe comments confused officials in the Pentagon as well, some who told The Daily Beast that there was no way Trump could have heard Baghdadi\u2019s voice on the Situation Room live stream Saturday night because it did not have audio. Two senior officials said while President Trump could have spoken to commandos on the ground who carried out the raid but said that has not often been the case in past operations.\n\nAnd on Monday, questions about where the president got his information continued to make its way to administration officials. At a press briefing Monday afternoon reporter peppered Acting Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley with questions about Trump\u2019s remarks about Baghdadi \u201cwhimpering\u201d and \u201ccrying\u201d. Asked whether he too had heard the whimpering and crying from Bagdadi, Esper said: \u201cI don\u2019t have those details.\u201d Milley said the president had planned to talk to unit members involved in the raid but that he didn\u2019t know the source of the Baghdadi description Trump used.\n\nBaghdadi had commanded forces from hideouts in both Syria and Iraq and was responsible for the killing of thousands of individuals in both those countries. He also inspired the kidnapping and killing of American aid workers and journalists as well as spectacular attacks overseas. His death was celebrated as a major breakthrough in a years-long effort to limit ISIS\u2019 reach and operational capacity; and, as such, questions over the validity of Trump\u2019s account of the raid mounted were dismissed by his supporters and Republican operatives as the gripings of a press corps determined to find superficial ways to ding him.\n\nBut if history is any guide, those questions could pose real headaches in the weeks and months ahead. In 2011 then Deputy National Security Advisor John Brennan told reporters Osama Bin Laden was armed during a U.S. special operations raid and when White House Press Secretary Jay Carney later had to reverse that account the Obama administration was criticized with trying to embellish the specifics of that similarly historic raid.\n\nTrump has made similar overstatements before. Two people close to the president say that when they heard about his comments on the \u201ccrying\u201d late ISIS leader, it reminded them of how Trump privately, as well as publicly, enjoys reflexively insulting his enemies in situations much less weighty than an anti-Islamic State raid. \u201cWhether they\u2019re actually crying or not, [Trump] will very often accuse some person he\u2019s in a fight with, like a celebrity or a politician, of being weak and just crying all over the place,\u201d one of the sources said. \u201cIt\u2019s a favorite insult of his.\u201d\n\nWhen it came to Baghdadi\u2019s death, the president wasn\u2019t the only one who seemed to get over his skis. On Sunday, President Barack Obama\u2019s White House photographer Pete Souza suggested that a picture from the situation room featuring Trump had been staged after the attack had concluded based on an erroneous belief of when the raid took place. Souza wasn\u2019t alone either. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-TX) retweeted a tweet declaring that the picture took place 95 minutes after the raid.\n\nBut Trump wasn\u2019t hampered on Monday by a fondness for hyperbole alone. He also seemed incapable of stopping himself from quickly veering back into the familiar territories of personal and cultural grievance. In his first visit to Chicago since he was sworn in as president, Trump delivered a speech on Monday blasting the city as a national embarrassment for its gang violence, crime stats, and immigration policies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s embarrassing to us as a nation,\u201d Trump said at a convention for police chiefs. \u201cAll over the world they\u2019re talking about Chicago. Afghanistan is a safe place by comparison.\u201d\n\nDuring the speech, the president took a shot at Jussie Smollett, the Empire actor who Chicago police said faked a violent hate crime on himself and then tried to pin it on nameless Trump supporters.\n\nEddie Johnson, the city\u2019s police superintendent, made a point of boycotting Trump\u2019s speech, and Mayor Lori Lightfoot posted to Twitter on Monday: \u201cRather than belittle Chicago\u2019s communities with hateful and dishonest rhetoric, he needs to go back to D.C. and face his fate\u201d during the ongoing impeachment inquiry.\n\nRight after trashing Chicago within its city limits, President Trump headed back to D.C. to attend a Halloween event for trick-or-treaters at the White House. He also resumed a preferred pastime: hate-posting on Twitter.\n\n\u201cCan you believe that Shifty Adam Schiff, the biggest leaker in D.C., and a corrupt politician, is upset that we didn\u2019t inform him before we raided and killed the #1 terrorist in the WORLD!? Wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the Do Nothing Democrats Impeach me over that! DRAIN THE SWAMP!!\u201d he tweeted on Monday evening.\n\nThat was sent minutes after he retweeted a December 2015 post by \u201cSteph,\u201d detailing why she called herself a devoted Trump follower: \u201cI'm an American citizen, sick of being pillaged & endangered by my government for every faction, race, religion and cause other than my own.\u201d\n\n\u2014With additional reporting by Sam Stein", "description": "Five officials told The Daily Beast that they were perplexed watching Trump\u2019s Sunday morning victory lap.
