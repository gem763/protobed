For a proper house with four bedrooms and a garden.\n\nLet us weep.\n\nRent is just \u00a3650 a month (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/metro.co.uk)\n\nHi, Carmel! How much do you pay to live here?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRent is \u00a3650 per month, bills are \u00a3270 per month. Council tax is the biggest part of these at \u00a3177 per month. We pay as we go with a smart meter. Then it\u2019s just the TV license and Sky.\n\nAnd what do you get for what you pay?\n\nFour bedrooms, three bathrooms, a large kitchen/diner, a utility room, and a living room.\n\nDo you think you have a good deal?\n\nAbsolutely. Our rent has never gone up since we moved in. Looking at similar properties to let now local to where we are, We would never get a house like ours for less than about \u00a31,000 per month.\n\nAs you\u2019ll see, Carmel is a big fan of cute quotes (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/metro.co.uk)\n\nWhereabouts is your home?\n\nCentral Scotland. It\u2019s a village along the Hillfoots in Clackmannanshire called Tillicoultry.\n\nOur home is also right between Glasgow and Edinburgh so it\u2019s an easy commute. But it\u2019s also very rural because of the hills all around us.\n\nThe only time I have ever been delayed on the road to work is when there are sheep or swans in my way! A bit different to being stuck in a traffic jam in a city.\n\nHow did you find the house?\n\nWe will have been here for nine years next April. We found it by chance. My landlady was a work colleague and she posted on our works electronic notice board that it was available.\n\nThe previous house we were in was not ideal (I actually hated it). So we snapped at the chance to rent it\u2026 Best move ever!\n\nOh, and Cookie the cat and Molly the pug live here, too (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/metro.co.uk)\n\nAre you happy where you live?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI love the area. It\u2019s right in the middle of the Ochil Hills and its a lovely village community. My landlady is amazing too and we have free reign to change whatever we want with the decor. We have made our home personal to us as a family.\n\nDo you feel like you have enough space?\n\nWe do. It\u2019s actually a really big house.\n\nHow have you made the house feel like home?\n\nFrom day one it has always felt like our home. We put our own stamp on it. It\u2019s more about the family in it, though, and the memories we have made. It\u2019s been a very happy home and still is.\n\nAnd you have a new dog! Have you had to make any adjustments to the house for her?\n\nWe thought we would but apart from her bed (which she never sleeps in\u2026 she sleeps with us) she has slotted in like a pro. She has been a dream to train. She is great for going outside in the garden. She has the run of the whole house now. We can\u2019t imagine a time when she wasn\u2019t a part of our wee family.\n\nThis isn\u2019t entirely true, but don\u2019t question it (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/metro.co.uk)\n\nAre there any issues with the house you have to put up with?\n\nAbsolutely none. Our landlady is amazing if anything goes wrong and gets it sorted immediately. She even sends us a lovely Christmas bouquet every year with a card addressed to the best tenants ever\u2026 Cute!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you have plans to move again?\n\nWe are realistic in that we know a time will come when we may have to move if the landlady decides to sell the place.\n\nI also know we should maybe downsize as our children are living away from home now. We have three spare rooms!\n\nBut we love living here and will stay as long as we can. We would probably look at something smaller if we had to.\n\nHave you thought about buying a place?\n\nUp until the last 10 years we always owned our own properties. During the recession we had financial difficulties and decided to sell up and rent for a while. We have never looked back.\n\nThere is so much pressure when you own your own home\u2026 maintenance and repairs, etc.\n\nI bask in the fact that if anything goes wrong, I just need to make a call and it\u2019s magically put right at no extra expense to me. We are thinking of moving back to my old home in Ireland when we retire so we may buy a small place then. But right now, renting is perfect for us.\n\nAnd when you can rent a four-bed house for \u00a3650 a month, why on earth wouldn\u2019t you? Shall we have a look around?\n\nBehold the garden (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/metro.co.uk)\n\nThere (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/metro.co.uk)\n\nAre (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/metro.co.uk)\n\nMany (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/metro.co.uk)\n\nGnomes (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/metro.co.uk)\n\nAnd there\u2019s the house (Picture: Katielee Arrowsmith/SWNS/metro.co.uk)\n\nHere\u2019s the living room.
