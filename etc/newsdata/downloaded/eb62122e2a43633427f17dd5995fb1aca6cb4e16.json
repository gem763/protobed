REUTERS/Shannon VanRaes\n\nWithin hours, the magazine would publish a picture that could doom his bid to win another four years in power. The 2001 image showed a 29-year-old Trudeau at an Arabian Nights party, his face covered in dark makeup, evoking racial stereotypes that seemed contrary to everything he stood for.\n\nParked on the Halifax airport tarmac that Wednesday, as campaign planners pushed for a timely departure to Winnipeg, Trudeau\u2019s closest aides nixed the idea of spending the next four hours in the air. Then and there, they would scramble to get ahead of the explosive story.\n\nThe election was a month away.\n\nWhile some aides prepared a contrite message for Trudeau to deliver to the media, the 47-year-old prime minister began calling as many Liberal legislators and cabinet ministers from ethnic minorities as he could, hoping to beat the news on Twitter. One was Omar Alghabra, a Liberal parliamentarian of Syrian descent, who said that Trudeau\u2019s heads-up came with rofuse apologies.\n\nStill on the plane, Trudeau called a nationally televised media conference at which he not only apologized repeatedly but also admitted to another incident of donning dark make-up.\n\nInterviews with that confidant and five other aides and strategists show how a hastily but carefully choreographed strategy over the ensuing week aimed to quickly rehabilitate the prime minister\u2019s image before the damage gelled. None of the six who spoke to Reuters agreed to be named, citing the sensitivity of the situation. No one connected to the campaign would speak on the record.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t dodge, you can\u2019t spin. You just have to put him out there and let people shout at him if they want to,\u201d said one Liberal aide who helped craft the strategy.\n\nWhether the strategy to quickly apologize was the right one remains to be seen: Polls showed Trudeau\u2019s popularity dipping in the immediate aftermath of the revelations before recovering. Since then, however, surveys of public opinion show the Liberals will be lucky to eke out even a weak minority government and could lose to the official opposition Conservatives led by Andrew Scheer.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t know the effect of the pictures until election day,\u201d said a senior Trudeau adviser. \u201cPeople might decide that however much they support us, they can\u2019t vote Liberal because of this.\u201d\n\nLiberal officials say lower voter turnout among Trudeau\u2019s supporters is a major risk.\n\nIn response to questions for this article, Conservative campaign spokesman Daniel Schow said the Liberal\u2019s campaign strategy hasn\u2019t worked.\n\n\u201cJustin Trudeau has spent the last four years lecturing Canadians about social and diversity issues with a holier-than- thou attitude. There\u2019s no way to spin hypocrisy. Canadians now realize that Justin Trudeau is not as advertised.\u201d\n\nScheer, the Conservative leader, said at a news conference on Sept 19 that Trudeau had not been sincere in his apology or fully truthful about his past. He cited a video in which Trudeau was captured dancing in black face. Trudeau told reporters he had not remembered the 1990s incident.\n\n\u201cI think Canadians might have accepted Justin Trudeau\u2019s apology if he hadn\u2019t lied about it,\u201d Sheer said at the news conference. \u201cI think he has lost the moral authority to govern.\u201d\n\nTOSSING ASIDE THE PLAY BOOK\n\nInside the Trudeau camp, three people took charge of damage control: Former journalist Ben Chin, who had been chief of staff to the finance minister and was now in charge of messaging; Cyrus Reporter, a long-time Trudeau ally and former chief of staff when Trudeau was in opposition; and current chief of staff Katie Telford, one of his closest confidants.\n\nWorking with Ottawa-based officials, the trio were crucial in devising the response in the hours and days to come, the sources told Reuters. Chin and Reporter, brought on a few months earlier, both were experienced in crisis management.\n\nThe approach: Be open, remorseful and solicitous of questions from the public and the media. Take a break from campaigning-as-usual. And draw the air out of the issue as early as possible ahead of the Oct 21 election.\n\nScott Reid, chief spokesman for former Liberal prime minister Paul Martin, said the quick apology was the right tack: \u201cWaiting to compose your thoughts and seeing how the dust settles is evidence of people who are perhaps not thoroughly motivated by the right instincts.\u201d\n\nCabinet ministers \u2013 including those from ethnic minorities \u2013 expressed disappointment with the revelations but pledged loyalty to Trudeau. Aides dismissed the idea that he was racist, noting he had been the driving force behind a decision to welcome around 40,000 Syrian refugees since taking power in November 2015.\n\nBut the crisis meant the Liberals had to temporarily toss their general-election play book to the side. It had called for an aggressive campaign that painted the Conservative Party of Canada as a haven for racist, anti-gay and anti-abortion candidates while stressing measures to make life more affordable for Canadians.\n\nThat approach, the aides who spoke to Reuters said, had been intended to help the Liberals get around another obstacle: voter distrust after Canada\u2019s ethics watchdog formally reprimanded Trudeau and his top officials in August for inappropriately interfering in a corporate corruption case.\n\nTWO DAYS OF CONTRITION, THEN A PIVOT\n\nTrudeau\u2019s plane took off for Winnipeg later that Wednesday, and according to one observer, he remained locked in conversation with Cyrus Reporter for much of the flight. Upon arrival, the prime minister and his team decamped to a different hotel than the traveling press corps and, unusually, had no communication with accompanying media for 12 hours.\n\nFor much of that time, Trudeau was in a room calling more Liberal parliamentarians and community leaders, said a Liberal aide familiar with the matter.\n\nThe aides decided to cancel a planned announcement on education that had been scheduled for the next day. Trudeau told aides he did not want to immediately pivot to a campaign announcement. \u201cI don\u2019t want (speech) lines that say, \u2018I am very sorry for what happened, but here\u2019s something even more important,\u2019\u201d one person who helped draw up Trudeau\u2019s strategy recalled the prime minister saying.\n\nHis campaign news conferences usually run for 15 to 20 minutes, but that first day in Winnipeg, Trudeau overruled advisers, opting to speak at length in the middle of a public square \u201cwhere we had no way of controlling who was present,\u201d according to one aide.\n\nFor nearly an hour, reporters aggressively quizzed Trudeau on his thinking when he wore black face, on whether there were other similar incidents and if he planned to resign.\n\nStanding in front of hundreds of spectators, Trudeau again apologized for his \u201cmassive blind spot\u201d and appealed for forgiveness.\n\nBack on the campaign plane, he headed to the western city of Saskatoon, a planned nighttime rally of Liberal supporters was canceled and replaced by a town hall where anyone could ask whatever they wanted.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t do a triumphant rally that night. We didn\u2019t know how people felt,\u201d said one campaign team member.\n\n\u201cA rally would have been highly inappropriate \u2013 he was in the penalty box,\u2019 said another Liberal directly involved with the campaign, referring to the temporary punishment meted out to ice hockey players.\n\nAfter two days of apologies, however, Trudeau was ready to go back on the offensive. He rattled off four major policies in just three days, including an announcement Sept. 20 on gun control in Toronto.\n\nThe next day, the front page of the Globe and Mail national newspaper led on the guns measure rather than the black-face images.\n\nNanos Research pollster Nik Nanos, who describes himself as unaffiliated with any political party, said the Liberals were lucky that there was still time for their poll numbers to rise.\n\n\u201cIf this had happened in the last week of the campaign, we\u2019d be saying Prime Minister Andrew Scheer,\u201d Nanos said.", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his election campaign team were on the way to the airport in Nova Scotia on Sept. 18 when Time magazine journalists called with alarming news.", "authors": ["David Ljunggren", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436597792&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920Q1-OCADN"}
