They\u2019re well drilled, they\u2019re very efficient in how many times they get the ball in to the box.\u201d\n\nChelsea will again be without N\u2019Golo Kante, Andreas Christensen, Antonio Rudiger and Ross Barkley through injury.\n\nKante\u2019s season has been beset by injury troubles and Lampard is keen for the French midfielder to take his time in coming back to action.\n\n\u201cWe need to get him right now because he\u2019s been in and out through the season as we all know,\u201d added Lampard.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no real timeframe on it. I just want him fit. He\u2019s played a lot of football for four years, he\u2019s had a big injury off the back of last season, and maybe he\u2019s suffering from that big injury and the fallout from that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s maybe now time to take a small step back to get his fitness up and be confident we won\u2019t have a domino effect of small injuries.\u201d", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Frank Lampard said Friday that he is wary of Chelsea suffering a European hangover during their trip to battling Burnley after", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/26/f4d572_frank-lampard-has-guided-chelsea-six-straight-wins-in-all-competitions-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
