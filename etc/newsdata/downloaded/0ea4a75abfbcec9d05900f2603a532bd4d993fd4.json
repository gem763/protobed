Even if he wins, Gayle, his whole life has been ruined, toppled, damaged,\u201d Donna Rotunno told \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d host Gayle King in an interview that aired Tuesday. \u201cAnd whether it\u2019s by his own doing or others, that\u2019s the fact. And the fact is that no matter what we do \u2015 and we can walk out of that courtroom with a \u2018not guilty\u2019 and walk him out onto those courtroom steps, and he never gets to be Harvey Weinstein ever again.\u201d\n\n\"His whole life has been ruined, toppled, damaged... And the fact is that no matter what we do, and we can walk out of that courtroom with a not guilty and walk him out onto those courtroom steps, and he never gets to be Harvey Weinstein ever again.\" -- Donna Rotunno pic.twitter.com/l1i2fDeBjM \u2014 CBS This Morning (@CBSThisMorning) September 17, 2019\n\nRotunno is defending Weinstein in a pending criminal case against him, involving two of the scores of women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, with allegations stretching over several decades. He pleaded not guilty to the charges and is awaiting a trial scheduled for early next year.\n\nShe also went on to attack the credibility of the accusers, suggesting that they had it coming and that the alleged abuse was just a matter of interpretation.\n\n\u201cAnytime we talk about men and women in sexual circumstances, I think we have to look at the fact that there\u2019s always an area of gray,\u201d Rotunno said. \u201cSo there\u2019s these blurred lines, and then sometimes, one side walks away from an event feeling different than the other.\u201d\n\nWhen King pointed out that in many cases of sexual abuse, survivors can\u2019t simply leave their abusers, Rotunno claimed they \u201chad a choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a choice. And if a woman makes that choice, she makes that choice. But then I think years later to come forward and then say \u2015 and who knows years later if your memory is exactly the way something happened at the time that you\u2019re claiming that it did?\u201d she said. \u201cI get frustrated when I listen to these types of situations, and I hear women say, \u2018Well, I didn\u2019t have a choice.\u2019 Well, no, you had a choice and you made a choice.\u201d\n\nYet, when King asked if \u201cyou\u2019re making it harder for women who have been sexually harassed, assaulted, raped to come forward,\u201d Rotunno said she believes \u201cI\u2019m making it easier for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they really are in a position that they feel uncomfortable, then the first thing they should do is report it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey should go to the police, and I think that that sort of weeding out the cases that don\u2019t rise to the level of real assaults should help real victims. So no, I think I\u2019m helping them, actually.\u201d\n\nRotunno also took issue with the Me Too movement at large, which has helped shed light on sexual abuse as a societal problem, enabled by people and institutions in power \u2014 such as Weinstein and the influential figures in his orbit. Instead, she claimed it\u2019s unfair to accused abusers.\n\n\u201cWhat bothers me about Me Too \u2014 it allows the court of public opinion to take over the narrative,\u201d Rotunno said. \u201cAnd when you can\u2019t come out and then either correct or challenge that narrative, it puts you in a position where you\u2019re stripped of your rights.\u201d", "description": "Donna Rotunno, who is defending the accused serial sexual abuser and disgraced movie mogul, claims Me Too has \"stripped\" Weinstein \"of [his] rights.\"", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d80d3d2240000c92b7c8626.jpeg?cache=vbuvaimvov&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
