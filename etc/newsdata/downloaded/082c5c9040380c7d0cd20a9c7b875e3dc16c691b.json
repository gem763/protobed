The machines were doing the job of his lungs, which had stopped working.\n\n\u201cI was basically on the verge of death,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Rodriguez, 22, a college student, is one of the nearly 1,300 people in the United States who have become seriously ill because of vaping. Like him, about 70 percent are young men. And also like him, many vaped THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.\n\nVaping is odorless and easy to hide, and Mr. Rodriguez slipped into doing it constantly, inhaling enormous amounts of THC and craving more. He decided to talk about it in the hope that his story might be a warning to other people under the false impression that vaping is safe.", "description": "He thought vaping THC would be safer than smoking marijuana, but the fumes shut down his lungs.", "authors": ["Denise Grady"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/10/science/00VAPEMAN1/00VAPEMAN1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
