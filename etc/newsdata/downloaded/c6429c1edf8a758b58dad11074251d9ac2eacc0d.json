Some are buying bitcoin futures as a way to gain exposure without risking the hacks and heists that have plagued the digital currency sector.\n\nThe shares, under the VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust, will provide institutional investors access to a physically backed bitcoin product tradable through traditional and prime brokerage accounts, VanEck and SolidX said in a statement.\n\nThe shares will be sold under Rule 144A of the Securities Act. The rule modifies the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission restrictions on trades of privately placed securities, allowing these investments to be traded among qualified institutional buyers.\n\nThe shares can be quoted on OTC Link ATS, an SEC-regulated alternative trading system, starting this Thursday. An ATS, which matches orders for buyers and sellers of securities, is not a national securities exchange, but may apply to the SEC to become such.\n\nThe bitcoin-based asset is similar to an exchange-traded fund.\n\n\u201cThe offering allows for shares to be created and redeemed like ETFs, but it is not an ETF,\u201d Ed Lopez, head of ETF Product for VanEck, said in an emailed statement to Reuters. \u201cUnlike an ETF it isn\u2019t listed on a national exchange, rather it is quoted on the OTC Link ATS platform.\u201d\n\nVanEck and SolidX together with financial markets exchange Cboe filed a proposal with U.S. regulators to list a bitcoin-based ETF product in January. An SEC decision on that has been delayed. Meanwhile, the two companies said they continue to work on launching a registered product.\n\nIn the event the SEC approves the earlier bitcoin ETF registration, the 144A issued shares may benefit from public market resales, the companies said.\n\n\u201cInstitutional demand for bitcoin exposure is uncertain, because institutional quality vehicles simply have not, to this point, been readily available,\u201d said Jan van Eck, chief executive officer at VanEck.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re introducing a solution for institutions that fits within their operational processes and the current regulatory framework.\u201d", "description": "Investment firm VanEck and financial technology company SolidX Management LLC will sell shares in their bitcoin trust to \"qualified institutional buyers,\" the companies said on Tuesday, in a move aimed at further attracting institutional money into the cryptocurrency segment.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
