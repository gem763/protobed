Zip it!\"\n\nPiers seemed delighted with her anger, quipping: \"Ooh, finally!\"\n\n\"Stop butting it!\" Charlotte exclaimed. \"I'm trying to tell people about breaking news!\"\n\nPiers wasn't too happy earlier after a poll revealed that viewers want him to be axed from the programme.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nOver the last week, Piers has been faced with a petition to get him booted off the ITV show after ranting about gender and claiming he identified as a penguin.\n\nToday, GMB decided to run a poll to see what viewers thought - and it didn't look good for Piers.\n\nOnly 41 per cent want Piers to stay while 59 per cent are desperate for him to leave.\n\nUpon seeing the results, Piers was unimpressed and shook his head before making another plea for people to save his jobe.\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"We cannot let the snowflakes win!\" he exclaimed. \"We need you to get voting! Let's get these numbers up, let's get this vote back on track.\n\n\"Let's put the snowflakes firmly back in their box.\"\n\nAn hour later, however, the result didn't look much different, prompting Piers to say: \"I'm in trouble folks, snowflakes are driving me out!\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nPiers was then involved in a fiery debate about whether he was transphobic and revealed that he had received the most \"foul\" abuse following the petition.\n\n\"Most people that consider the 100 genders thing is utterly ridiculous,\" he seethed as he hit out at an activist who had signed the petition to get him fired.\n\nThe presenter was left even more fuming when he was accused of being 'bigoted' for his views.\n\nHe added: \"These are important issues we need to cover without being screamed at for having a different opinion.\"\n\n*Good Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV", "description": "The Good Morning Britain presenter, 44, had enough today when Piers interrupted her news segment", "authors": ["Rose Hill", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20582283.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GMB-Charlotte-Hawkins-tells-Piers-Morgan-to-zip-it.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
