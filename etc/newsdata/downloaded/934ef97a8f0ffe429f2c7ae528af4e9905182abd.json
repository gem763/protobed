The investigation is over, there's no investigation of collusion, he's won and he should take that victory and move forward.\"\n\nBossert previously served as deputy homeland security adviser to President George W. Bush and was known in his year with the Trump administration as a firm defender of Trump and a trusted advisor on terrorism, cybersecurity issues, and natural disasters.\n\nHis recent comments come as something of a surprise for the former loyal Trump adviser who was even at the center of some of the president's well-known controversies, as he was criticized for defending the president's comments on issues like white supremacist protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia in 2017 and Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nSome of Bossert's comments made while he was in the administration seemed in contrast to his sharp dismissal of the president's concerns about the 2016 election, including when he said in 2018 that \"no voter in this country was influenced\" by Russian bots during the election.\n\n\"I honestly do believe that there is a large degree of misunderstanding in the reporting and there's a whole lot of attempted politicking going on meant to try to undermine the legitimacy of the election,\" he told NBC News in April 2018.\n\nThe presidents' inner circle has come under harsher scrutiny as House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said last week that his committee is mapping out potential hearings, depositions, and subpoenas ahead of an impeachment probe.\n\nMultiple polls have indicated growing public support for impeachment, adding a swell of support as Democratic lawmakers take aim at key figures in Trump's circle.", "description": "Bossert slammed Trump and his longtime lawyer Rudy Giuliani's repeated echoing of debunked conspiracy theories about the 2016 presidential election.", "authors": ["Ellen Cranley"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d90bddd2e22af3874044b63-960-480.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
