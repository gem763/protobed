It could have an impact on your career.\"\n\nMusic to their ears, and hands and minds... We talk to one of the people behind a new wellness centre at the University of Ottawa, devoted to the health and wellbeing of musicians. 10:05\n\nCoping with pain, anxiety\n\nThe centre opened Saturday, on the 50th anniversary of the founding of the university's music school.\n\nComeau said historically, musicians have either taken medication and simply played through their pain or searched fruitlessly for treatment to meet their needs.\n\n\"They just hope that [the pain] will not reach the stage where it becomes an injury, or that it does not reach a stage where it will impact on the quality of their performance,\" he said.\n\nThat's a problem, Comeau added, because when that pain or anxiety becomes difficult to cope with, many musicians end up putting away their instruments.\n\nSome also self-medicate.\n\n\"They resort to drugs [or] alcohol. The number of musicians that have to use those in order to cope with the performance that they do is quite high,\" Comeau said.\n\n\"What happens sometimes [is that anxiety puts] an end to a career, because you reach a point where you just can no longer cope with that amount of anxiety.\"\n\nThe University of Ottawa's new wellness centre will treat both stress injuries and performance anxiety in musicians. (The Associated Press)\n\nEducation and research components\n\nThe centre will offer its users access to medical practitioners like chiropractors and physiotherapists, Comeau said.\n\nThere will also be education and research components, with one of the centre's goals being the development of a master's program in musicians' wellness.\n\nWhile there's been a lot of research into sports injuries and psychology, similar research into music-related injuries hasn't kept up, Comeau said.\n\n\"Musicians are a particular kind of people with specific needs, specific difficulties and it's important now that people understand that.\"", "description": "The centre's clinic, which opened Saturday, will both treat musicians' physical injuries and help them cope with mental health issues like performance anxiety.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5309846.1570221831!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/gilles-comeau-university-ottawa-wellness-centre-director.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
