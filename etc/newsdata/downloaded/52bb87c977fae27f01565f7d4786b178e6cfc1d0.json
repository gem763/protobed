The legendary pliosaur is believed to be the top predator of all time - and could have had eaten a T Rex for breakfast. More than twice the size of a killer whale, the pliosaur's 8ft long jaw was 4.5 times more powerful than a T-Rex. They measured over 10 meters in length and could weigh up to several dozen tons. It could easily swallow a human whole or bite a car in two if around today.\n\nIn addition to the pliosaur bones, the palaeontologists also discovered several other animal species from the same era.\n\nThese include plesiosaurs (long-necked cousins of pliosaurs), giant turtles and ancestors of modern-day crocodiles reaching six meters in length.\n\nDr Tyborowski said: 'Sea turtles ate large snails, while they themselves fell prey to large crocodiles.\n\n'We know this because we found teeth marks left by those reptiles on turtle shells.\n\n'The pliosaurs hunted all the animals whose fossils we discovered at this site.'\n\nIn total, several hundred bones were discovered.\n\nDr Tyborowski said the discovery of the fossilised remains was the just the beginning.\n\n'We hope that the next months and years will bring even richer material in the form of bones of large reptiles,' he said.", "description": "The Jurassic-era bones belonging to a terrifying creature called pliosaurs, were discovered by palaeontologists in a field of corn in the village of Krzyzanowice, close to the Swietokrzyskie Mountains.", "authors": ["Ed Wight In Poland For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/10/20367638-0-image-a-27_1572430265457.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
