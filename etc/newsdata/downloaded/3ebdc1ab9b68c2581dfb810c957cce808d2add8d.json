They were closed following a court order in 2016.\n\nAnnouncing the review in a press conference on Friday, Ukraine's new chief prosecutor Ruslan Riaboshapka said he had launched an audit into approximately 15 historic cases that may have been closed improperly.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his associates have claimed that Biden Senior, then vice-president with responsibility for Ukraine, shut down the investigations by forcing the resignation ofViktor Shokin, the former general prosecutor.\n\nThere is no evidence to support these claims. Paper trails and the testimony of those involved in the case at the time suggest that, on the contrary, Mr Shokin stood in the way of any investigation into Burisma. There were no active investigations at the time of the former chief prosecutor's departure in 2016.\n\nBut these discredited claims now lie at the heart of a US Congress impeachment inquiry into possible abuse of power by the US president.\n\nThe inquiry was set up in late September, following a whistleblower complaint that Mr Trump tried to strong-arm his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, into announcing an investigation against the Bidens. On Thursday evening, that inquiry released numerous text messages that appeared to document how State Department officials coordinated with Ukraine to secure such an investigation.\n\nProsecutor Riaboshapka's Friday announcement gave an impression of giving the Trump administration part of what they demanded. But it also stopped short of offering a full investigation into the company or either of the Bidens. The new chief prosecutor also said he had seen no evidence of wrongdoing by the vice-president's son, Hunter.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Mr Riaboshapka said his review had nothing to do with the scandal in Washington, saying that his office was \"outside of politics.\"\n\nWhile the move was initially interpreted in as an overture to Mr Trump's entreaties to investigate, legal experts said it did not necessarily represent a shift in position by Ukrainian authorities.\n\nWriting on Twitter, the anti-corruption campaigned Daria Kaleniuk said the review was happening ahead of a planned reform, due next month, which will see investigative powers removed from the Prosecutor General's Office.\n\n\"They are doing audits of all investigations ... including cases against Yanukovych associates,\" she said. \"He is not promising to reopen the case against Burisma, Biden or Zlochevksy.\"", "description": "Ukraine has announced it is\u00a0reviewing the closure of\u00a0criminal investigations concerning a gas company which former US Vice President\u00a0Joe Biden\u2019s son worked for.
