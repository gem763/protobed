Also contributing to that decline, however, is the near-complete eradication of Christians in some areas. Clancy discussed the aid group\u2019s findings with Breitbart News in a conversation last week.\n\nDiscussing northeastern Syria, Clancy noted, \u201cthat was a very well-established Christian community there. There were 30-35 towns and cities along the [Khabur] river banks where Christian communities live.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere had been a renaissance of sorts there. There had been a regrowth of the Christian culture because they were living, there was a place to work, there were good, arable fields,\u201d he noted. \u201cThat\u2019s being, in a sense, wiped away now in that all of these towns along the river are becoming targeted by the Turkish incursion, or whatever happens between Turkey, the Kurds, and Syria, so those are the people who will be forced to go into Kurdish Iraq.\u201d\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced \u201cOperation Peace Spring,\u201d an invasion of northern Syria to eradicate the indigenous, mostly Kurdish population and replace them with mostly Arab refugees currently in Turkey, this month. The operation officially ended following a ceasefire agreement brokered by Russia, but that agreement requires the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), the mostly Kurdish U.S.-backed militia responsible for defeating the Islamic State in its \u201ccapital\u201d of Raqqa, to evacuate the Syrian regions near the Turkish border. The SDF has repeatedly accused the Turkish military and its allied Free Syrian Army (FSA) militia of violating the ceasefire.\n\nErdogan, who has referred to the Armenian genocide as \u201cthe most reasonable action that could be taken\u201d at the time, attempted to reassure ethnic and religious minorities in Syria upon announcing the invasion by falsely alleging, \u201cTurkey has never committed any civilian massacre in its history and it never will.\u201d\n\nChristian community leaders expressed concern immediately following the announcement of Turkey\u2019s operation.\n\n\u201cThey are targeting residential areas in Qamishli, where people of all religious backgrounds live,\u201d Bassam Ishak, a Syriac Christian leader, told NPR this month, referring to a Syrian city with an ancient Christian population. \u201cWe think this is a message to the Kurds and Christians there to leave, so Turkey can move refugees there. We think it\u2019s a form of ethnic cleansing.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish attack reportedly damaged Christian churches in towns near Qamishli in the region as well as the city\u2019s Christian neighborhoods.\n\nThe presence of recovering Christian communities in Kurdish areas highlights a general tendency for Kurdish leaders to tolerate their presence in a way that other regional factions \u2013 and, of course, the Islamic State \u2013 did not. Clancy noted that Kurdish leaders in Iraq and Syria have taken in Christians in part because of Western concern for them, and the West \u201cunderstands that in each Christian community, you have what represents people who act as agents of dialogue, in that their presence allows more [Arab] Sunni and Shia and Kurds to interact and address problems with less battling.\u201d\n\nHe adds that Christians benefit Kurdish communities by \u201csupport[ing] institutions that help society.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey tend to support more educational institutions. We see this in Archbishop [Bashar] Warda [of Erbil] building the Catholic University of Erbil \u2013 during a time of war and destruction, what is he doing? He\u2019s building a university and he is going to start training future leaders and future professionals,\u201d Clancy noted.\n\n\u201cYou see the institution of education being important to Christians, that is one of the foundation stones,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou see the philosophy of living in a multicultural society being expressed. You don\u2019t hear about any of the major churches preaching \u2018we need to have walls around us and we\u2019re never going to interact with them and they are our enemy,\u2019 you hear the opposite.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the Christian communities disappear, there is a good chance that these catalysts go away and the more bellicose, problematic people become more powerful and more active and more potent,\u201d Clancy predicted.\n\nKurdish leaders are under pressure \u2013 in Syria, from the Turkish invasion, and in Iraq, from growing refugee flows \u2013 that also trickles down to Christian communities, however. Clancy noted that the Christians slowly rebuilding in the area Turkey invaded will likely be the ones to flee across the border to Iraqi Kurdistan, where reports indicate a boom in human trafficking following the launch of \u201cOperation Peace Spring.\u201d The capital of Iraqi Kurdistan, Erbil, has already taken in over half of the 229,000 Syrian refugees in Iraq, according to the United Nations. While Christian populations already in Erbil have helped absorb the large refugee flows, Clancy said, \u201cit\u2019s like a branch that is bent \u2026 how much more tension can you put on different communities?\u201d\n\nClancy added that in Erbil, following the initial attacks on Iraqi Christian communities by the Islamic State, Kurdish officials bristled at having to accommodate thousands of Christian children in Kurdish schools. But those pressures differ significantly from what Christians returning to non-Kurdish former ISIS strongholds are facing.\n\n\u201cIn some of the newly returning communities of Christians, you hear about this Shia movement to place mosques or other things in front of Christian places of worship that use PA systems or loudspeakers to blast Muslim prayer and try to dishearten the Christian population,\u201d Clancy noted, \u201cand you hear about the effort to, say, buy up Christian land or to try to take over Christian properties.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always going to be upset because even in Kurdish Iraq, in the area where the Christians are in the Erbil region, they are a minority, they are subject to the rule of someone else and they always have to live very tentatively in a sense even though there is establishment,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Christian communities under Kurdish control are some of the only ones remaining in Syria and Iraq. Aid to the Church in Need\u2019s recent report, titled Persecuted and Forgotten?, estimated that Iraq has lost 90 percent of its Christian population. Syria, Clancy said, had lost about \u201cat least 75 percent.\u201d\n\nChristianity may be at the peak of extinction, but Clancy noted there was still hope in the small but determined group of Christians who insist on maintaining a presence in a region converted to their religion by the first generation of followers of Jesus.\n\n\u201cOf course there is hope, and the hope is [in] people who don\u2019t leave, they stay there,\u201d he said. \u201cThese people always offer hope, they do things that are superhuman, some people may say crazy, but they truly believe that they should be there and they should stay.\u201d\n\nAid to the Church in Need is actively helping Christians rebuild their churches in former ISIS strongholds throughout Iraq and Syria.\n\nFollow Frances Martel on Facebook and Twitter.", "description": "Turkey's invasion of Syria is a threat to Christian communities rebuilding in a country that lost the majority of its Christian population.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1155117050-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
