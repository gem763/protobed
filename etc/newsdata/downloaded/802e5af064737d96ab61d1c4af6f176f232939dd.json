In But Not the Hippopotamus, the title character does not partake in other animals\u2019 activities: \u201cA hog and a frog cavort in a bog. But not the hippopotamus.\u201d At the end, the group invites her to join and she agrees: \u201cBut YES the hippopotamus!\u201d Joy and comfort seem assured. Yet, just then, on the final page: \u201cBut not the armadillo.\u201d Like all good literature, it leaves interpretation to the reader.\n\nRead: The importance of scaring children\n\nThe ambiguity disturbs some parents. My child is very upset, they complain. He wants to know what happened. \u201cThe armadillo is fine,\u201d Boynton always reassures them. For years, readers begged for a follow-up that would resolve the matter. Last year, she finally gave in and published But Not the Armadillo. After pages of gratifying, mostly solitary activities\u2014napping, strolling, picking cranberries\u2014the book invokes the earlier story\u2019s ending: \u201cA happy hippo dashes by. She wants to run and play. But not the armadillo. No. He goes the other way.\u201d Don\u2019t sit out if you want to join in\u2014that\u2019s the hippo\u2019s lesson. But equally valuable is the armadillo\u2019s: You don\u2019t have to take part if you don\u2019t want to. It\u2019s a profound message for a parent, let alone a toddler. As Jon Anderson, the president and publisher of Simon & Schuster Children\u2019s Publishing, put it to me: \u201cThere\u2019s something almost Samuel Beckett about it.\u201d\n\nI had traveled to Boynton\u2019s studio to find out how she makes a board book. She took me upstairs, where we perched on stools in front of her computer, whose desktop featured a phalanx of pop-eyed chickens against a black backdrop.\n\nShe opened a folder of Word files containing the text for Dinosnores. She had set up the book\u2019s 11 spreads on a single page, each numbered, like stanzas of poetry or song lyrics. Most of Boynton\u2019s work is bite-size: A greeting card is an image and a line of text; a book is a dozen of them. That makes every element crucial.\n\nBoynton obsesses over details. She pointed to the edges of a few board books nearby. They looked distinctly orange next to the white ones. \u201cChina,\u201d she said disdainfully. Whenever possible, instead of printing offshore, she insists on using Terry Ortolani, who runs the only board-book printer left in the United States. He\u2019s developed his own methods, including steps to ensure the thick pages don\u2019t crack when folded and scored during the production process. But most of all, after 25 years of collaboration, he knows how to meet Boynton\u2019s expectations.\n\nShe tends to get her way, and everyone who works with Boynton says that\u2019s because she\u2019s right, not because she\u2019s truculent. The translator for her Spanish editions wanted baile for \u201cdance\u201d in Barnyard Dance!, but Boynton didn\u2019t like it: \u201cDanza sounds better.\u201d It\u2019s true; the lumbering D and the brusque Z better suit a square dance for livestock. They didn\u2019t get past the title\u2014Boynton fired the baile guy and did the translations herself.\n\nTimothy O\u2019Connell\n\nShe has also completely redrawn many of her books, in some cases more than once. In part, this is because technological changes have allowed her to sharpen the thin outlines around her cows and pigs. (Today, she draws both on paper and on her computer, where she composes her work in Photoshop.) But mostly, Boynton wanted her characters \u201cto look the way they should look.\u201d A green bathing suit switched to purple. A textured paint style became more solid. Most readers wouldn\u2019t notice the changes, but they foster longevity. \u201cIt kind of blew my mind how she has this ability to maintain the original look yet give them a freshness that makes them pop anew,\u201d Anderson told me.", "description": "Sandra Boynton\u2019s picture books have sold 75 million copies, captivating children and the adults who read to them.
