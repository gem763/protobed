There are pairs that bring unfettered flexibility and cushioning; shoes that really shine on long distances; and ones kitted out with flash, both of the speedy and sartorial variety. Whether you're diving into half-marathon training, or lacing up for a round-the-block jaunt, we sourced fall's hotly anticipated drops for the running set. Come claim your pair.\n\nFor a cushy foot feel: Nike Joyride Run Flyknit\n\nSeeking some ease in your next run? Thousands of squishy little foam beads built into this pair (you can actually see them through the transparent heel) form to the foot as you move, so your outing will feel as low impact as it gets. It's like stepping on a spring-y bean bag. Ideal for recovery runs or for those who are dipping their toes into the sport, these supportive sneaks keep your legs fresh, taking a literal load off when you hit the pavement.\n\nNike Joyride Run Flyknit, $235, Nike\n\nFor a springy step: New Balance FuelCell Propel\n\nPersonal best-chasers rejoice: this innovative pair boasts added acceleration and propulsion for your speediest run yet. The velocity improving tech is found in its innovative construction. The midsole's responsive foam offers 65% more energy return than the standard foam on the market. Translation: this shoe does some of the heavy lifting for you. Combined with its light-on-the-foot feel, you'll finally get as much out of your run as you put in.\n\nNew Balance FuelCell Propel, $130, New Balance\n\nFor slick style points: Adidas Ultraboost 19\n\nYes, running is about pushing your limits, but who says you can't look good doing it? Adidas' most anticipated launch of 2019 \u2014 coming in hot with a whole host of performance-driven newness \u2014 also happens to be its best looking. There's the cool colour story (the icy blues, the muted aubergine, the pop of electric orange), but the sharp silhouette with a second-skin fit is also worth mentioning. Nevermind the track \u2014 you'll be sporting these on the streets, too.\n\nAdidas Ultraboost 19, $250, Adidas\n\nFor long distances: Asics Gel-Kayano 26\n\nWhen you're putting down your base mileage, footwear durability is a necessity. This pair, souped up with high-density shock absorption at the heel, takes on a whole lot of the impact. It's also equipped to encourage proper running technique: a firmer foam along the inside of the shoe prevents excessive inward roll once the foot hits the ground. Clocking a ton of kilometres never felt so comfy.\n\nAsics Gel-Kayano 26, $220, Asics\n\nFor newbie runners: Under Armour HOVR Infinite\n\nJust starting out? The HOVR Infinite is choice among distance runners and novices alike. Thanks to its thoughtful design, which aims to improve energy return, users experience a \"zero gravity feel\" with every step \u2014 pretty ideal when you're giving running a go for the first time. Bonus: this pair doubles as your personal running coach. UA's Record Sensor technology tracks and analyzes a bunch of running metrics so you learn exactly where you could improve.\n\nUnder Armour HOVR Infinite, $150, Under Armour\n\nFor max breathability: Reebok Forever Floatride Energy\n\nMuch like its airy name suggests, Reebok's latest launch offers a lightweight road ride right until the finish line. Outfitted with extra-bouncy foam that's 30% lighter than the typical material, you'll get a leg up on your speed trial times. Plus, the engineered mesh upper feels extra breezy on the foot, so you can actually run like the wind.\n\nReebok Forever Floatride Energy, $130, Reebok\n\nJillian Vieira is a Toronto-based writer and stylist.
