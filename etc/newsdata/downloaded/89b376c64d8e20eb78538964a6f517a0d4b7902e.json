What was its true intention?\u201d\n\nThe article went on: \u201cBusiness is business, and politics is politics. Nobody wants to drag Apple into the lingering unrest in Hong Kong. But people have reason to assume that Apple is mixing business with politics, and even illegal acts.\u201d\n\nThere was no immediate response from the U.S. tech giant, although U.S.-based analysts and former U.S. officials quickly seized on the development on social media Wednesday, with many arguing the People\u2019s Daily article was as clear warning by the Communist Party in Beijing that Apple could face repercussions and possibly even Chinese government restrictive measures going forward.\n\nAnalysts say Chinese authorities are increasingly wary that the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous global financial hub on China\u2019s southern coast, could spread into mainland China and challenge the government in Beijing.\n\nThe protests in Hong Kong were sparked in June when a Beijing-appointed city administrator moved to enact an extradition law that opponents said would put residents of the territory at risk of being sent to China, where they could face politically motivated trials.\n\nSome saw the law as an open threat by China \u2014 which is under increasing economic strain from its trade war with Washington \u2014 to the autonomy of private banks and other businesses run from Hong Kong because extradition could potentially be used to coerce the heads of such firms.\n\nThe proposed law has been withdrawn in the face of widespread popular outrage, but the protest movement has increased its momentum. Demonstrations have taken on a wider, pro-democracy scope with demands for free elections in Hong Kong. Adding a pro-American strain, some protesters wave U.S. flags and even sing \u201cThe Star- Spangled Banner.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
