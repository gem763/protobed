I'll admit there are times where private valuations have overshot their public peers but Canva isn't one of them,\" Baker said.\n\nCanva's last published results declared a $1.8 million after-tax profit for the six months to December 31, 2017, and although the company declined to reveal subsequent earnings, co-founder Melanie Perkins said last week it remained profitable.\n\n\"The fact it's profitable at all at the multi-unicorn stage is very special,\" Baker said.\n\n\"Compared to its SAAS peers in the US who are burning money on sales and customer acquisition, the VCs over there look at Canva and can't believe it.\"\n\nAirTree Ventures partner Craig Blair, who has backed Canva in every round since its Series A in 2015, said the start-up had not even touched its previous raising of $70 million in May, which had valued it at $3.6 billion.\n\n\"They've got this wonderful community of freemium users who do all their advertising for them, and they're converting them to paid as well as anybody I've seen in 15 years of investing,\" Blair says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Their control over profitability is very rare.\"\n\nHowever value investor Steve Johnson of Forager Funds said he would want to know exactly what profit margins were before investing.\n\n\"A multiple of revenue is meaningless by itself,\" he said.\n\n\"Canva may turn out to be one of the great ones that are undoubtedly there \u2013 it's why there's a bubble in tech valuations \u2013 but would I rather pay $US3 billion for something that's still mostly promises, or $US30 billion for something like [engineering software provider] Autodesk that is established, profitable and owns its space? I'll take the latter.\"\n\nOf Canva's 20 million active monthly users, 850,000 are paid subscribers to its 'Pro' premium tier, which in Australia costs $18 for a single month.\n\nHowever Canva's spokesman said subscriptions had only just become available on Canva's mobile app, which is how half its users access the service, while a new enterprise service priced at $US30 per user per month was only launched last week.\n\n\"There's one Fortune 500 company where 7000 employees are using us either for free or in teams on Pro,\" the spokesman said.\n\n\"With Enterprise there's an opportunity to sell them on using Canva to lock down all their branding and templates, with no worries when it comes to copyright.\"", "description": "After yet another valuation increase last week, the graphic design scale-up has revealed its revenue figures to convince doubters that it is worth the big numbers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.1779%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9924fa7645f33db1dbd5723c8ca826010c6406d5", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
