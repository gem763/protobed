(AP) - It will be the end of an era of sorts this weekend in Oakland.\n\nNot that anyone figures to be mourning what should be the final NFL game ever played on a field with infield dirt, especially the players who have had to deal with the bad footing, ripped jerseys, scraped arms and legs and hard falls onto a surface with no cushion.\n\nThe Raiders are set to host the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday at the Oakland Coliseum in their final home game before the end of the World Series. With the Coliseum the last stadium left that hosts an NFL and baseball team and the Raiders set to move to fancy new digs in Las Vegas next year, no more players will have to deal with the travails of infield dirt the way greats like Joe Namath, Joe Montana and Eric Dickerson once had to in their careers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like running full speed and then when you get to full speed, belly flopping on pavement,\u201d Raiders quarterback Derek Carr said. \u201cThat\u2019s about what it feels like when you hit. If you look around it, our guys are all patched up. Stuff on their knees, tapped up today and things like that. That stuff is like road rash, for real. I wish they\u2019d soften it up, but I guess it needs to be a fast track.\u201d\n\nTeams over the years have been moving from the multipurpose stadiums that were all the rage in the 1960s and \u201870s to football-only palaces with price tags in the billions.\n\nBack in 1981 when the Raiders played their final season of their first stint in Oakland, 16 of the 28 teams in the NFL shared stadiums with baseball teams, including 10 that played on grass fields often featured infield dirt on parts of the field at least until the end of the baseball season.\n\nBut over the years, famous baseball venues from Yankee Stadium to Fenway Park to Wrigley Field to Tiger Stadium all hosted professional football teams as well, giving this game Sunday a throwback look.\n\n\u201cYou know what, I like the old elements of football, I\u2019ve been accused of being old school,\u201d Raiders coach Jon Gruden said. \u201cI know a lot of friends like me that like watching a football game on the dirt. I used to like to play in the yard, but it\u2019s going to be pretty neat, Chiefs-Raiders on the dirt one more time.\u201d\n\nBut the Coliseum has outlived its usefulness to the Raiders, who decided to move to Las Vegas when they couldn\u2019t reach a deal with local officials on plans for a new stadium in Oakland.\n\nBeyond the dirt infield, there are the cramped locker rooms designed for 25-man baseball teams rather than 53-man football rosters. There are press conferences held in weight rooms and batting cages. There are floods and other mishaps teams have to dodge.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just something about that place that\u2019s crazy,\u201d Chiefs coach Andy Reid said. \u201cLast year, the sewage system flooded, and it simplifies the game for you. You got to work through a few things to get out there, and then you still have the baseball infield. These guys can tell their grandkids that they used to play baseball there and we\u2019d go out and during the baseball season and play in the dirt, literally. I think there\u2019s something to that.\u201d\n\nThe venue has special meaning to Chiefs quarterback Pat Mahomes, since it\u2019s the only stadium he will play in as an NFL player that his father Pat Mahomes Sr. pitched in as a major leaguer.\n\nThe younger Mahomes threw for 295 yards and four TDs in his only appearance here last year on an all-grass field in December, but now will get to do it on the dirt.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019ll be different,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen how other teams have attacked. But until you get out there we\u2019ll just go with the flow \u2026 It could be the last time we get to play on something like that.\u201d\n\nIt might not be so enjoyable if he asks those who have done it before.\n\nRaiders rookie running back Josh Jacobs had his first dirt experience on Monday night when he gained 113 yards from scrimmage and scored two touchdowns. Those memories will be more enjoyable than playing on the unusual surface.\n\n\u201cIt rips jerseys. It literally goes through anything. You leave the game with a lot of scratches and stuff like that,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cThe ground hurt more than the tackles.\u201d\n\nWhile Raiders players don\u2019t like it and won\u2019t miss it, there has been perhaps a little advantage to playing on a surface opponents aren\u2019t used to. It\u2019s more difficult for kickers, to make cuts and for pass rushers to get off on the snap.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s why the Raiders have fared better at home early in the season when the dirt is still there than they have later on after the A\u2019s season is done. Since 2010, the Raiders are 9-6 at home when playing with the infield dirt compared to 24-30 without it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big advantage. Our guys love it so much,\u201d Gruden said sarcastically. \u201cIt\u2019s like I used to play when we were in Tampa and it was a 120-degree heat index, and everybody said it was an advantage to us.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Dave Skretta in Kansas City, Missouri, contributed to this report\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It will be the end of an era of sorts this weekend in Oakland.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Josh Dubow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/raiders_goodbye_dirt_football_15921_c0-55-2274-1380_s1770x1032.jpg?de7dfee5b959067bf9f441c2261155cd38f137e3", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
