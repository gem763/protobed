Giuliani in recent months has consulted several times with Manafort through the federal prisoner\u2019s lawyer in pursuit of information about a disputed ledger that would bolster his theory that the real story of 2016 is not Russian interference to elect Trump, but Ukrainian efforts to support Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe relationship, which Giuliani acknowledged in an interview this week with The Washington Post, stems from a shared interest in a narrative that undermines the rationale for the special counsel investigation. That inquiry led to Manafort\u2019s imprisonment on tax and financial fraud allegations related to his work in Kiev for the political party of former president Viktor Yanukovych\u2026\n\nGiuliani joined Trump\u2019s legal team in April 2018 to help defend the president against special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s probe, and the former mayor said he launched his own investigation into Ukraine late last year, which led him to consult with Manafort. He said he has not spoken directly to Manafort in two years.\n\n\u201cIt was that I believed there was a lot of evidence that the [Democratic National Committee] and the Clinton campaign had a close connection to Ukrainian officials,\u201d Giuliani said, noting that he was never advocating for a pardon of Manafort. \u201cIt was all about Trump. I don\u2019t think I could exonerate Manafort.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com World National-Security Giuliani-Consulted-On-Ukraine-With-Imprisoned-Paul-Manafort-Via-A-Lawyer"], "top_image": ""}
