She added that \u201che\u2019s well within his authority to act in that manner\u201d, because \u201ceach pastor has canonical authority to make such decisions for his parish school\u201d.\n\nAccording to the paper, the books were on shelves until the end of the previous term, but the school has just opened a new library from which they were removed.\n\n\u201cI know that in the process they were going through and kind of weeding out some of the content in hopes of sprucing it up and improving the circulation,\u201d said Hammel, adding that if parents deemed the stories \u201cto be appropriate we would hope that they would just guide their sons and daughters to understand the content through the lens of our faith\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cWe really don\u2019t get into censorship in such selections other than making sure that what we put in our school libraries are age-appropriate materials for our classrooms.\u201d\n\nThe Harry Potter books have drawn censure from Christians ever since the first in the series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, was released in 1997. In 1999, it was the most challenged book in the US, and the series topped the American Library Association\u2019s list of the most frequently challenged books of 2000-2009.\n\nChallengers asserted that the books \u201cglorified magic and the occult, confusing children and leading them to attempt to emulate the spells and curses they read about\u201d, said the ALA. In 2001, the pastor of Christ Community Church in Alamogordo, New Mexico oversaw a book burning of the Potter books, and a local library responded with a dedicated display, telling the public that \u201cHarry is alive and well at their library\u201d.\n\nWhile he was still a cardinal in 2003, the future Pope Benedict XVI described the books as \u201csubtle seductions which act unnoticed and by this deeply distort Christianity in the soul before it can grow properly\u201d.", "description": "Pastor at St Edward junior school in Nashville says JK Rowling\u2019s use of \u2018actual spells\u2019 risks conjuring evil spirits", "authors": ["Alison Flood"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25955f8af9788cfecdaed683a910003bd0752613/0_138_2460_1476/master/2460.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3c75fa905ef53b98c5ca8e25607e4cdc"}
