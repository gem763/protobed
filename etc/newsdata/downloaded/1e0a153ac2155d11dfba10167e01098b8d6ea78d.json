She rocketed to international fame in 2006 with her single Hips Don't Lie.\n\nLopez, an actress and singer, is known for hits such as \"Love Don't Cost a Thing\" and stars in the movie Hustlers, which is tipped for an Oscar.\n\nShe said that in a statement that she \"couldn't wait to show what us girls can do on the world's biggest stage\".\n\nShakira, meanwhile, called the opportunity \"a true American dream\".\n\nThe concert comes as the NFL seeks to rebuild its image after a public backlash over the treatment of Colin Kaepernick, a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nMr Kaepernick started kneeling during pre-game renditions of the US national anthem, as a sign of protest against racial injustice.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Colin Kaepernick (centre) hasn't played in the NFL since 2017\n\nThe protest developed into a movement as many other players followed suit.\n\nIt caught the attention of US President Trump, who suggested kneeling players should be fired, and last year the NFL said it would fine the teams of any players who knelt. Mr Kaepernick opted out of his contract in March 2017 and has not played since.\n\nFollowing the controversy, several big-name artists - including Rihanna, P!nk and Cardi B - reportedly turned down offers to perform at last year's half-time show.\n\nThe concert was eventually headlined by pop band Maroon 5 and rappers Travis Scott and Big Boi.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Maroon 5 performed at last year's Superbowl half-time show with Travis Scott and Big Boi\n\nTo counter criticism, Maroon 5 teamed up with the NFL and their record label Interscope to donate $500,000 (\u00a3382,000) to educational charity Big Brother Big Sister.\n\nTheir gesture echoed that of Travis Scott, who agreed to perform on condition that the NFL contributed towards a $500,000 joint donation to the social justice organisation Dream Corps.\n\nThe most-watched Super Bowl show of all time was Katy Perry's shark-infested spectacular in 2015, which drew 120.7 million viewers.", "description": "The concert will be the first to be produced by Roc Nation, Jay Z's entertainment company.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D186/production/_108983635_nflconcertpicturetop.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
