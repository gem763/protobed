A senior officer from Road Policing Command will reach out to the person involved to review the matter.\n\n'Anyone who may have information that may substantiate the claims is urged to come forward.\n\n'Distractions while driving can have serious consequences and attract significant penalties.\n\n'Drivers should avoid distractions, including use of their mobile phone or responding to passengers and children in the vehicle where it diverts their attention away from the primary responsibility of ensuring a safe journey on our roads.'\n\nMr Harris said he was just trying to keep his fluids up on a scorcher of a day in south east Queensland.\n\n'If it is against the law then I'll pay the fine, but it's not compassionate to fine someone on a 39-degree day for trying to stay hydrated,' he told the ABC.\n\nDistractions while driving can have serious consequences\n\nMr Harris protested after he was pulled over but the police officer told him he was just doing his job.\n\nQueensland Police Superintendent David Johnson of Road Policing Command said drinking water while behind the wheel can be illegal if the driver loses control of the car.\n\n'There are many people who consume drinks while driving and do it safely in a safe manner,' Supt Johnson told the ABC.\n\n'For us to issue a fine we have to look at the circumstances to see if the driver's actions are causing risks to themselves or others.'\n\nMr Harris' fine comes after a messy motorist was heavily fined for driving a car brimming with garbage.\n\nQueensland Police caught the man, 57, driving on Mount Gravatt Capalaba Road in Brisbane at midday on August 17.\n\nThe footage released by police showed the old Ford Falcon sedan was loaded with shopping bags, empty cans, water bottles and cardboard boxes.\n\nPapers and catalogues were strewn all over the dashboard and the rear of the car.\n\nThe trash in the car was obstructing front, back and side visibility.\n\n'The car is full of rubbish,' a woman officer was heard on video as she inspected the car with a male colleague.\n\n'As you can see the gentleman inside the car can't see anything.\n\n'We have got serious concerns about his visibility. He's got no visibility on sides, no visibility off the rear at all.'\n\nOfficers then handed the man a traffic infringement notice for two offences.\n\nHe was fined $311 for driving a vehicle without clear view in all directions.", "description": "Brock Harris, from Beaudesert, west of the Gold Coast, said he was pulled over as he was approaching his house after working 12 hours in 39C heat.", "authors": ["Charlie Moore For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/23/19562184-0-image-a-32_1570746378176.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
