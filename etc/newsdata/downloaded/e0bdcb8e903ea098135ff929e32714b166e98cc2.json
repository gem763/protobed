It\u2019s not really getting anxious about anything. It\u2019s about being grateful we have this opportunity to go down there and play a great football team.\u201d\n\nOf course, the Fighting Irish have been through this before.\n\nOver and over again, they\u2019ve faced a momentous game with a shot at proving their relevance to college football beyond an iconic place in the history books, a chance to talk about something other than Rockne and Parseghian, Rudy and the Four Horsemen, the Gipper and Touchdown Jesus.\n\nMore times than Irish fans care to count, Notre Dame landed flat on its face.\n\nMore times than not, it was downright ugly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we focus on what other people think,\u201d senior defensive end Adetokunbo Ogundeji insisted. \u201cWe\u2019re Notre Dame. Everyone knows about us. We\u2019re just focused on what we have to do.\u201d\n\nWell, what they have to do is win a big game.\n\nSince the departure of Lou Holtz, who guided Notre Dame to its last national championship way back in 1988, the Irish are just 36-51 against ranked opponents and a putrid 8-28 when facing top 10 teams.\n\nTaking this era of big-game futility to an even deeper level, Notre Dame has beaten exactly two teams over the last 22 seasons - Stanford in 2012, Michigan in 2002 - that went on to finish in The Associated Press top 10.\n\nMost telling of all is the way the Irish have lost:\n\n- With a national title on the line at the end of the 2012 season, top-ranked and unbeaten Notre Dame was blown out by Alabama 42-14.\n\n- Facing Ohio State in the 2016 Fiesta Bowl, the result was a 44-28 drubbing.\n\n- Ranked third late in the 2017 season and eyeing a possible College Football Playoff berth, the Irish were routed at Miami 41-8.\n\n- After earning their first playoff appearance a year ago with an undefeated regular season, they were carved up 30-3 by eventual national champion Clemson in the Cotton Bowl semifinal game.\n\nThe average margin in those 28 setbacks to top 10 opponents is a whopping 35-15. Fourteen times, Notre Dame has lost by at least 20 points. Nine times, the margin was at least 30 points.\n\nNo wonder Georgia is a hefty two-touchdown favorite between the hedges.\n\nAs strange as it may sound for a program of this stature - and, yes, the Fighting Irish still have a ton of cachet - this team desperately needs a signature win.\n\nCoach Brian Kelly brushed off any talk about the larger ramifications.\n\nThat\u2019s probably for the best.\n\nNo need to worry a group of players who weren\u2019t even born the last time Notre Dame won a truly meaningful contest.\n\n\u201cIt is not even part of what we do for preparation,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s about our players, it\u2019s about our coaches giving them a great game plan, it\u2019s about my job to make sure we put together the best possible preparation for our team.\n\n\u201cThe rest of that stuff,\u201d he added, \u201cI really couldn\u2019t care less about.\u201d\n\nThere has long been a perception that Notre Dame is stuck in the past, relying on lumbering players and old-fashioned offensive schemes that no longer work in a fast-paced game built around speed and quickness and spread formations.\n\nBut Georgia coach Kirby Smart scoffs at those who cling to stereotypes.\n\n\u201cYou lost me there,\u201d he said. \u201cThey recruit the same players we do. When we go knocking on doors, we\u2019re all going after the same guys. So, they have a really good football team.\u201d\n\nIndeed, let\u2019s stop making excuses for the Fighting Irish.\n\nMaybe their classroom standards are tougher than many schools. Maybe it would help to be in a conference instead of going it alone. None of that should be a significant hindrance to a program that has a nationwide following, can play any team it wants, reaps the financial windfall of its own network television contract and revels in a grander legacy than any other school.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anyone is too worried about what anyone is saying outside this building,\u201d Book said. \u201cWe\u2019re supposed to lose by double digits? It\u2019s kind of a chip on our shoulder. We\u2019re going to use that as motivation. I think it\u2019s great. The pressure isn\u2019t on us. We\u2019re going to go down there and do what we have to do. We believe in ourselves. Everyone in this building is one family. We know our potential. We\u2019re confident.\u201d\n\nActually, the pressure is on.\n\nLike everyone else, Notre Dame is part of a what-have-you-done-for-me-lately world.\n\nForget the echoes.\n\nIt\u2019s time to live in the present.\n\n___\n\nPaul Newberry is a sports columnist for The Associated Press.
