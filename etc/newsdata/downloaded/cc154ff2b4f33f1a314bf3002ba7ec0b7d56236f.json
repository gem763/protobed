The lower the ratio, the more efficient a railroad.\n\nCanada\u2019s second-largest railroad operator said average fuel price fell 10 per cent to $2.41 per gallon in the third quarter, leading to a 7.1 per cent fall in fuel expenses.\n\nTotal carloads, the amount of freight loaded into cars during a specified period, rose 1.4 per cent, while rail freight revenue per carload increased nearly 3 per cent, CP said.\n\nRevenue in the energy, chemicals and plastics segment, which also contains its crude-by-rail (CBR) shipments, rose about 13 per cent to $382 million in the quarter.\n\nWhile CBR shipments fell short of the company\u2019s expectations, CP remained optimistic that the new Alberta government will come to a resolution on the transfer of its crude contract.\n\nThe current government is trying to offload onto the private sector nearly $4 billion of crude-by-rail contracts that were signed by the previous government, amounting to 120,000 barrels-per-day of crude.\n\nThe company expects crude volumes to increase in the fourth from the third, it said on a post-earnings call.\n\nLarger rival Canadian National Railway Co also beat quarterly profit estimates but cut its adjusted earnings forecast for the year, citing declining freight demand in North America.\n\nCP, which maintained its full-year adjusted profit outlook, reduced its volume expectations to low-single digit revenue ton-mile (RTM) growth from mid-single digit RTM on delays in the Canadian grain harvest and export potash volumes.\n\nRTM measures the relative weight and distance of freight transported by a railroad.\n\nCanadian railway operators have been hit by a slew of problems, including lower-than-expected crude shipments and a late harvest of grains due to wet weather.\n\nCP said adjusted net income rose 8.7 per cent to $640 million, or $4.61 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30.\n\nAnalysts on average had estimated earnings of $4.52, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4.3 per cent to $1.98 billion but fell short of analysts\u2019 estimates of $1.99 billion.\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019", "description": "The company expects crude volumes to increase in the fourth from the third, it said on a post-earnings call", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/cprail2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
