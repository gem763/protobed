Ur tripping because I want a specific kind of cat? U weren't tripping when I got my dog Oscar and he wasn't a rescue.. every pet we get must be a rescue?\n\n\"I believe in adopting rescues but also think there are preferences and that's what breeders are for.\"\n\nTagging the Instagram account for his kittens, Bieber wrote: \"PETA go help with all of the plastic in the ocean and leave my beautiful cats alone @kittysushiandtuna.\"\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
