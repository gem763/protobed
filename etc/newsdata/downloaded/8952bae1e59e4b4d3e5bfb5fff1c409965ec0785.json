If we get a move on. Now. Right now. And miss lunch,\u2019 I intoned looking at my watch.\n\nSome wag with a sense of humour at Ferrari had clearly thought it would be a wheeze to pair up yours truly \u2013 not exactly the fastest performance car driver in the parish \u2013 with \u2018Captain Slow\u2019, aka James May, formerly of BBC\u2019s Top Gear and now the Grand Tour for Amazon Prime.\n\nFerrari teamed up Ray Massey, right, with Grand Tour and ex-Top Gear star James May, left, to test drive the new 488 Pista\n\nJames had taken a break from shooting to have a spin in the new 488 Pista, before heading off to Detroit \u2013 the US motor industry\u2019s original Motown.\n\nHe and his colleagues Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond are currently filming the third series of the Grand Tour. Will it be the last? He was diplomatically tight-lipped on that.\n\nOur own miniature grand tour on winding Italian roads proved to be a rather fun, entertaining and quite leisurely cruise, before we both rather nervously returned for a blood-and-guts drive around Ferrari\u2019s famous Fiorano race-track test circuit.\n\nThis is the track opposite the firm\u2019s factory in Maranello, in northern Italy, where all civilian and F1 cars are put through their paces.\n\nAnd this would be after hours of dilly-dallying in a car starting at a cool \u00a3250,000 that will sprint to 62mph in under three seconds.\n\nSo we got a move on. Sort of. But sadly we did miss lunch \u2013 a near criminal offence in Italy.\n\nHow far away is it and how long have we got? With neither renowned for their speed, Ray Massey, left, and James May, right, found themselves running out of time to get to the track\n\nWhat rubbed salt into the wound was that it was at Ferrari\u2019s legendary works canteen \u2013 the Cavallino restaurant near the factory gates in Maranello and the Fiorano test-track circuit from which we\u2019d set off.\n\nNamed after Ferrari\u2019s prancing horse logo and festooned with memorabilia, this near shrine to food and Ferrari is where the firm\u2019s founder Enzo Ferrari ate and where employees, drivers, executives and fans still go today.\n\nBut I was in good company. Engaging Mr May \u2013 the \u2018nice one\u2019 of the Top Gear trio - is already the owner- after much self-confessed wavering \u2013 of a \u00a3250,000 limited edition Ferrari 458 Speciale.\n\nHe secured the very last one. Or rather Ferrari built an extra one for him.\n\nHe bought it just as what he calls the infamous \u2018punchgate\u2019 affair led to the canning of their much-loved version of the BBC Top Gear programme, after Clarkson got into an altercation with a producer over a steak dinner.\n\nSo May sold a few motor bikes at auction to help keep his finances in balance, before Amazon Prime waved some large cheques in the trio\u2019s direction to recreate their on-screen chemistry with the lavishly filmed Grand Tour.\n\nNow he is pondering whether to trade in his 458 Speciale, which is growing in value as a collectors\u2019 car, for the new and improved 488 Pista.\n\nHis nickname from fellow presenters Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond is Captain Slow, but James May is not really a slouch behind the wheel, says Ray Massey\n\nThe Pista is not a limited edition, though bosses told me the first two years\u2019 production run of around 2,000 cars is already sold out to largely long-standing Ferrari customers.\n\nIt would be ungentlemanly and churlish to apportion any blame for our tardy progress.\n\nThis involved a fair bit of faffing about, including: looking for a licensed tobacco shops for my chain-smoking companion, stopping for a well-earned coffee in a rather cool motor bike themed caf\u00e9, shooting the breeze about life and everything from Lego to Zeppelins, and getting \u2018lost\u2019 down some beautiful if diverting Italian country lanes when the sat-nav threw a bit off a wobbly and took us \u2018off pista\u2019.\n\nThe 488 Pista is pretty phenomenal to drive, says Ray, especially for a self-confessed \u2018ordinary driver' for whom it makes light work of piloting a supercar\n\nStopping en route for that espresso at a roadside bikers\u2019 caf\u00e9, we parked next to a tiny but similarly red liveried Piaggio mini-van and caused a mini-sensation. Italians male and female of every age and shape busied around the Ferrari, debating the 488 Pista\u2019s finer points, taking photographs and engaging in heated debate as we looked on. Such passion. About a car.\n\nFerrari is at pains to point out that this phenomenally high performance car with racing pedigree is designed to be as easy and fulfilling to drive on the road by \u2018drivers of all types', whether race-track pros or high net-worth petrolheads.\n\nAnd you will need deep pockets, of course. The price for a 488 Pista starts at \u00a3252,765 before you add any of the potentially very expensive extras. That includes \u00a32,112 for the four-point harness, \u00a38,640 for the go faster racing stripe, and \u00a314,208 for the carbon-fibre wheels alone.\n\nThe new supercar\u2019s Pista name means track and Ferrari claims it can be both a racer out there and civilised for the road\n\nThe new supercar\u2019s Pista name may not translate so well into English from the Italian, but simply means track. When you arrive at the circuit you see above you in giant letters alongside a prancing horse on a Ferrari red banner the words Pista di Fiorano.\n\nSo what\u2019s it actually like to drive? Pretty phenomenal, as you might expect. Especially for a self-confessed \u2018ordinary driver' for whom it makes light work of piloting a supercar.\n\nFerrari say the new 488 Pista builds and improves upon the earlier 488 GTB iteration and the previous 458 Speciale model, and is lighter, faster and more \u2018extreme\u2019.\n\nIt is powered by a mighty 4.0 litre (3,902cc) V8 engine developing 720 horsepower linked to a slick 7-speed dual clutch automatic gearbox with manual override, via paddles on the steering wheel.\n\nIt accelerates at blistering speed from rest to 0-62mph in just 2.85 seconds \u2013 and up to 124mph in just 7.6 seconds \u2013 reaching a potential top speed of 211mph. The vitally powerful brakes will bring you to a complete stop from 62mph in 29.6 metres.\n\nSome comfort elements have been stripped out \u2013 such as the glovebox \u2013 in favour of open cubby holes.\n\nAerodynamic tweaks mean the Ferrari 488 Pista also has up to 20% more \u2018downforce\u2019 to help keep it rooted to the tarmac\n\nFerrari says the 488 Pista has the highest amount of transfer of racing tech to one of its roadgoing cars.\n\nIt\u2019s 90kg lighter, about the weight of a man, than its predecessor 488 GTB, and has 50 more horsepower (and 115hp more than my driving companion\u2019s 458 Speciale).\n\nIt also has 50 per cent more new parts in the improved engine and virtually no turbo-lag when you floor the throttle.\n\nAerodynamic tweaks mean the Pista also has up to 20 per cent more downforce to help keep it rooted to the tarmac. This is helped by a clever S-Duct used for the first time on a road-going car. It\u2019s basically a gap behind the front bumper that forces air between the bumper and the bonnet and then over the front windscreen, boosting downforce over the front axle.\n\nThere are sharper gear-shifts and lashings of lightweight carbon-fibre in the functional racing-style interior.\n\nIt still had room for my hefty laptop bag in the under-the-bonnet \u2018boot\u2019. And there\u2019s that satisfying Ferrari roar, which has been further tuned and enhanced, when you open her up.\n\nFerrari 488 Pista Price: \u00a3252,765 First deliveries: September 2018 First two years\u2019 production sold out. Top speed: 211mph Acceleration: 0-62mph: 2.85 seconds 0-124mph: 7.6 seconds Braking distance: 62mph to 0 mph: 29.6m Engine: 3,902cc V8 twin-tubo Power: 720 horsepower (CV) Length: 4,605mm Width: 1,975mm Height: 1,206mm Kerb weight: 1,385kg Transmission: F1 7-speed dual clutch gearbox. Automatic with manual override. Lap time around Fiorano circuit: 1 minute 21.5 seconds. Fuel consumption: 25 mpg (11.5 litres per 100km) CO2 emissions: 263g/km Boot capacity: 170 litre\n\nInstead of conventional seat-belts, Ferrari had fitted our car with a racing harness which proved a proper faff to put on.\n\nStrapped in like a trussed up turkey or the client of some dodgy dominatrix, it then proved impossible to lean forward to adjust things like one\u2019s seat.\n\nThe reversing chimes were louder than Big Ben, too.\n\nThe Italian supercar maker makes this bold claim: \u2019The Ferrari 488 Pista offers drivers of all abilities an exceptional and exhilarating experience that normally only a competition car could deliver, setting a whole new benchmark in terms of driving pleasure for the Ferrari range.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s certainly managed that.\n\nAnd you can forget all the insouciant on-screen clowning. Trust me, Mr May is a pretty capable driver of performance cars.\n\nArriving back at the Pista di Fiorano test track just in time for our allotted time slot, it was straight on with the helmet and out onto the circuit with Ferrari\u2019s imposing chief tester Raffaele De Simone.\n\nCompact, wiry and intensely focussed, he proved a master tutor: \u2018Eez a Ferrari. You have to drive it like a Ferrari,\u2019 he said sternly after my first lap.\n\nNot, I took to be the implied message, like a complete wuss.\n\nAs my confidence and feel for the car grew, the succeeding laps proved better with a satisfying bit of twitch on the tight corners and much faster acceleration out of them. The new specially created Michelin Pilot Sport Cup K2 tyres \u2013 tested on a TameTire simulator and promising extra grip - and solid brakes were doing their stuff.\n\nA run with a Ferrari test driver in full track mode was the automotive equivalent of a virtuoso violinist playing a Stradivarius, says Ray Massey\n\nA masterclass by Raffaele behind the wheel with me strapped into the passenger seat was awesome and awe-inspiring.\n\nIn full track mode with all the safety key settings off, it was the automotive equivalent of a virtuoso violinist playing a Stradivarius.\n\nMy faffy racing harness came into its own and kept me wedded firmly to my seat during a roller-coaster ride. Few if any drivers will be able to take this car to the limit in the manner of the man who fine-tuned its performance handling.\n\nIt\u2019s a far better car than I am a driver and I couldn\u2019t scratch the surface of its capabilities \u2013 though Raffaela\u2019s full-blooded no-prisoners circuits did give me a seat-of-the pants insight.\n\nBut it\u2019s easy enough to drive for yourself if you don\u2019t feel compelled to push it to the limit\n\nI wonder if James May will buy one?", "description": "Ferrari paired up Ray Massey \u2013 not the fastest performance car driver \u2013 with \u2018Captain Slow\u2019, aka James  May, formerly of BBC\u2019s Top Gear and now the Grand Tour, to test the new 488 Pista.", "authors": ["Ray Massey For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
