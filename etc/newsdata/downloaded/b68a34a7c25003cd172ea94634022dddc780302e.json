Software and cloud computing suffered the brunt of the damage. The IBD 50 Fund exchange-traded fund (FFTY) , which is comprised of high momentum stocks, lost nearly 5%.\n\nMuch of this money flowed into small-cap names. The Russell 2000 exchange-trade fund (IWM) gained almost exactly the same amount that the IBD 50 lost, which was just under 5%.\n\nThis rotation didn't have any obvious catalyst, but it is an indication that fund managers are repositioning ahead of the Fed's interest-rate announcement next week. It was not an event that was well anticipated and caught both bulls and bears by surprise.\n\nThe other drama this week occurred in bonds. Bonds made a parabolic move starting in early August and that seemed to have been fueled by a move to a safe haven as signs of an economic recession became more apparently. It was an extreme move and many market players characterized it as a bubble.\n\nThis week the iShares Barclays 20+ Year Bond Fund (TLT) sold off each day and finished the weak with a loss of 6.3%. It is still above the levels at the end of July, but many market players were comparing the action as similar to the bubble and collapse that occurred in stocks in 2000.\n\nThese two big events created quite a bit of instability and randomness, but headlines about the potential for a trade deal with China and some dovish action by the European Central Bank kept a bid under equities.\n\nThe charts of the major indexes are in a good position if you ignore the rotation and bonds, and it creates a very interesting setup into the Fed decision on Wednesday. I'll be discussing that in-depth, but the important thing to keep in mind is that the market seems to celebrate a dovish Fed, regardless of how anticipated the news might be.\n\nIt is a very unusual market environment right now, and that is likely to continue. The action is not easy to trade, but there is some movement and that always offers opportunities.\n\nHave a great weekend. I'll see you on Monday.", "description": "The S&amp;P 500 gained nearly 1% and the Dow Jones industrial average is up about 1.5%, but look at all that went on under the hood this week.", "authors": ["James", "Rev Shark", "Market'S Pretty Face Hides All The Week'S Drama Underneath", "The S P Gained Nearly", "The Dow Jones Industrial Average Is Up About", "But Look At All That Went On Under The Hood This Week.", "Mark Sebastian", "Bob Ciura", "Timothy Collins", "Carolyn Boroden"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/c12f5968-b781-11e8-b0bf-c5b67c8e39cf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
