Nope. Not a chance. Won\u2019t see the light of day. Ever.\n\nStill, looks fantastic doesn\u2019t it? It\u2019s clearly just a design exercise to blend a few modern features with some vintage style, but we can fully get behind that.\n\nThere\u2019s a hefty nod to Merc\u2019s history here too. The Simplex pays homage to the first ever car to wear the Mercedes name \u2013 the Mercedes 35 HP (or 35 PS in German) from 1901.\n\nThe 35 was developed at the request of wealthy businessman and occasional racer Emil Jellinek, and was the first car to move away from the traditional high-riding motorised carriage design.\n\nLooking at the new Simplex concept will give you a pretty strong idea of how the 35 looked. The surfaces might not have been quite as rounded \u2013 or as rose gold \u2013 but the 21st century interpretation does actually reflect the original rather well in our eyes.\n\nThe concept also features a 3D display with superimposed Mercedes lettering in place of a grille \u2013 so presumably it would need to be an EV. That display would apparently provide information on the vehicle status as you drive along. Hmmmm.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just the shape that\u2019s retro though. The bonnet straps, Chesterfield quilting and leather bag at the rear are all smart touches (if a little glitzy), and isn\u2019t that nautically-inspired steering wheel just lovely?\n\nMerc describes the Simplex as a \u2018sculpture embodying the heritage and future of the luxury brand Mercedes-Benz\u2019. We reckon it\u2019s just a cool-looking thing and thought you might like to see it\u2026\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.topgear.com/sites/default/files/styles/16x9_1280w/public/images/news-article/2019/09/4fc4e7171409d0480e417bd35bb670b4/19c0762_013.jpg?itok=saIAn7_u", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
