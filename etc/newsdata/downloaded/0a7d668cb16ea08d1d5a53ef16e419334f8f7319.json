For both teams, their exuberance on and off the field has been propelled by the joy often seen in Latin baseball culture. USA TODAY\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Houston Astros looked like a homeless guy begging for loose change on a street corner when they arrived into the nation\u2019s capital, and by the time they leave Sunday evening, may be asking Donald Trump what\u2019s a good time to pop back into town for their celebratory White House visit.\n\nThe Astros, after losing the first two games of the World Series in Houston with talk they may be swept, suddenly evened the series with an 8-1 rout over the Washington Nationals, assuring the series is returning to Minute Park in Houston.\n\nThis whacky Series, in which the visiting team has won all four games for the first time since 1996, is now a best-of-three series with four of the finest pitchers in the game going mano a mano, and all of the mojo headed out West with the Astros.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty damn good,\u2019\u2019 Astros veteran reliever Joe Smith said. \u201cWe knew we were going to win some games here.\n\nAlex Bregman slugs a grand slam home run in the seventh inning for the Astros. (Photo: Brad Mills, USA TODAY Sports)\n\n\u201cWe like where we\u2019re at.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re confident.\u2019\u2019\n\nHey, can you blame them?\n\nThey\u2019ve got Gerrit Cole, who is 19-1 since May 22, in Game 5.\n\nThey\u2019ve got Cy Young favorite Justin Verlander in Game 6.\n\nWhy wouldn\u2019t you feel good?\n\nThen again, before the Astros start ordering the champagne, the way this zany series has gone, they may want to remember that they happened to each lose Games 1 and 2 in Houston.\n\nAnd the Nats will be pitching Max Scherzer in Game 5 and Stephen Strasburg in Game 6, yep, the two guys who were dominant in the first two games of the Series, and had folks believing this series could be over in a hurry.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think we\u2019d sweep,\u2019\u2019 Smith said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think they\u2019d sweep. We\u2019re in the World Series. These are the two best teams playing against each other.\n\n\u201cNow, things will start to get a little interesting.\u2019\u2019\n\nThen again, considering what we\u2019ve seen this series, who can predict a thing?\n\nHow can a team beat Verlander and Cole, who will finish 1-2 in the American League Cy Young award balloting, scoring 19 runs, and then manage only two mealy hits in five innings against 24-year-old Jose Urquidy, joining Fernando Valenzuela as only the second Mexican rookie to start a World Series game?\n\nThe Nats even got a huge break when Astros manager A.J. Hinch pulled Urquidy after only 67 pitches, and nearly paid the price when the bullpen faltered, and the Nats made it 4-1 and had the tying run at the plate in the sixth inning.\n\nYet, Alex Bregman, put away any thoughts of a comeback dancing in the Nats\u2019 heads to sleep. Bregman, the MVP candidate who was hitting just .129 (4-for-31) since the AL Division Series, swatted a four-seam fastball off Fernando Rodney 392 feet into the left-field seats for a grand slam. It was the first grand slam by third baseman in a World Series game since Ken Boyer of the St. Louis Cardinals in 1964.\n\nJust like that, this series has turned upside down.\n\nIf there\u2019s any pressure, considering the Astros didn\u2019t feel any after being down 0-2, they sure don\u2019t feel a darn thing now.\n\n\u201cPutting pressure on yourself,\u2019\u2019 Smith said, \u201cwhere does that get you at the end of the day? We play loose. We have a ton of fun over here. Us getting nervous and stuff, that doesn\u2019t help nobody.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to stay where we\u2019re at.\u2019\u2019\n\nLet the Nats do all the sweating.\n\nThis is a team that was rolling, winning eight consecutive postseason games, and trailing a total of 12 innings the entire streak.\n\nThey have now trailed 17 consecutive innings, and have lost back-to-back games for the first time since Sept. 13-14.\n\nOSUNA: Firestorm puts Astros closer back in spotlight\n\nGAME 5: Trump plans to arrive late for game\n\nMeanwhile, the Astros are looking more formidable by the day. It\u2019s not just Bregman shaking his slump. It\u2019s catcher Robinson Chirinos, hitting his second home run in two nights, becoming the first catcher to hit homers in back-to-back World Series games since Ted Simmons for Milwaukee in 1982.\n\n\u201cThey threw a big punch at the beginning of this series,\u2019\u2019 Hinch said. \u201cNow, we get a little mojo back on our side, get a little bit of momentum.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe Nationals, meanwhile, have to find their offense in a hurry, scoring just two runs the last two nights. They were hitting .355 with runners in scoring position during their streak, and now are one-for-19 the last two games.\n\n\u201cNobody,\u2019\u2019 said Nats third baseman Ryan Zimmerman, their longest-tenured player, \u201cthought this was going to be easy.\"\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale", "description": "Alex Bregman slugged a grand slam in the seventh inning to break Game 4 open for Houston, who evened the series with the Nationals after an 8-1 win.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published P.M.
