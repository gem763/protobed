But according to a letter the Oversight Committee sent the Pentagon in June, the military has spent $11 million on fuel at the Prestwick Airport \u2014 the closest to Trump Turnberry \u2014 since October 2017.\n\nThe committee\u2019s investigation, which began in April of this year, is probing whether the stops pose a conflict of interest for the president and whether the military is helping to prop up Trump\u2019s resort, which had been losing money. An aide for the committee told POLITICO that the Pentagon has not responded to their inquiries as part of the probe.\n\nThough Air Force officials have insisted that the crews' stops to refuel at the Prestwick Airport appeared to adhere to existing guidelines for military stopovers, the agency has also said it will determine whether it is appropriate for members to stay at properties owned by the commander in chief.\n\nOfficials also said that in the case of an April stay by a crew at Turnberry, which sparked the Oversight investigation, the members \"used the closest available and least expensive accommodations to the airfield within the crews\u2019 allowable hotel rates.\"\n\nThe crew, which was headed to Kuwait on a routine trip to deliver supplies, stopped in Glasgow, which has no U.S. military base. On similar trips to the Middle East, crews more frequently landed at U.S. air bases in Germany and Spain to refuel, according to one person familiar with the trips, with occasional stops in the Azores and once in Sigonella, Italy.\n\nThe revelations sparked immediate backlash, and they come as the Trump administration has already come under fire for attempting to divert Pentagon funding to build the president\u2019s long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nAccusations that Trump\u2019s properties are unfairly profiting off of his administration have dogged the president since entering office. Trump still owns his business but placed his holdings in a trust designed to hold assets for his benefit. He can receive money from the trust at any time.\n\nEthics officials and lawmakers have raised concerns about foreign officials staying at Trump hotels, noting that Trump supporters and industry groups regularly hold events at Trump-owned locations. Trump is also considering hosting next year\u2019s G-7 summit of world leaders at his Doral resort in Miami, a potential financial boon for the property, and has previously stayed at the Turnberry property during an official visit to the United Kingdom.\n\nRevenue increased by $3.1 million at Trump Turnberry in 2018, which Trump visited in July of that year, according to Trump\u2019s most recent personal financial disclosure forms.\n\nLast week, Vice President Mike Pence raised eyebrows when he stayed at Trump\u2019s resort in Doonbeg, Ireland, during a visit there, despite its location hundreds of miles away from his meetings in Dublin. The Oversight Committee is investigating that stay as well.\n\nTrump on Monday defended Pence\u2019s stay at Doonbeg, writing on Twitter that he played no role in Pence\u2019s decision to stay there despite Pence\u2019s chief of staff telling reporters originally that Trump had suggested it.\n\n\u201cI had nothing to do with the decision of our great @VP Mike Pence to stay overnight at one of the Trump owned resorts in Doonbeg, Ireland,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cMike\u2019s family has lived in Doonbeg for many years, and he thought that during his very busy European visit, he would stop and see his family!\u201d\n\nAnita Kumar contributed to this report.", "description": "Typically, Air Force crews will stop at military bases elsewhere in Europe to refuel, where it would be cheaper to do so.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko", "Natasha Bertrand", "Bryan Bender"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/a1/75/b97fcb3d4dd9a66ee50a5a5f9b8f/1994-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
