The 37 year-old First Daughter has a new hairstyle. What was once long is now short\u2014and it moves.\n\nTrump first sported the short, side-parted bob at an airbase in Maryland on Monday, pairing it with a navy maxi dress belted at the waist. She stared purposefully off into the distance while cameras snapped, as if playing \u201cCome Fly With Me\u201d in her head.\n\nWhen Ivanka de-boarded in Bogat\u00e1, Colombia with Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan at her side, she had changed into a white mini dress with a brash lapel pin.\n\nIn a more simple era, back when Ivanka was a mere \u201cWoman Who Works\u201d running her eponymous fashion label, she may have posted about the cut on Instagram tagging some variance of the phrase, \u201cnew hair, new me.\u201d\n\nBut Ivanka kept things professional on Monday, captioning the photos with, \u201cThank you Vice President Marta Lucia Ram\u00edrez for the warm welcome. Looking forward to a great trip!\u201d\n\nThough Trump-friendly outlets like the MailOnline (often stationed outside Ivanka's actual home to capture what she is wearing that day) and The Daily Caller raved about the look, calling it \u201csleek\u201d and \u201cterrific,\u201d hairstylists who spoke with The Daily Beast had a more measured response.\n\n\u201cHer bob strikes me as very 2002,\u201d Devin Toth, a stylist at Salon SCK on New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue, told The Daily Beast. He noted that Ivanka may not have gotten a haircut, just taken out longer extensions, as he saw in her bob what looks like the track line that would clip in artificial hair.\n\n\u201cI think that anytime someone does this chop, it gives off a \u2018take me more seriously\u2019 vibe,\u201d Toth continued. \u201cYou appear more intentional, precise, and discerning. Just think of Anna Wintour.\u201d\n\nDhiran Mistry, who takes clients at David Mallet\u2019s Soho salon, also said that the cropped cut conjured images of the inimitable Vogue editor-in-chief. \u201cI love bobs, but the look went from being a cool, Vidal Sassoon, Anna Wintour sharp look to the Stepford Wives. It\u2019s one of those guilty-by-association things.\u201d\n\n\u201c She looks like an anchor from Fox News, and that\u2019s probably the next job she\u2019ll get anyway \u201d \u2014 Stephanie Brown\n\nStephanie Brown, a master colorist at Soho\u2019s IGK Salon, put it bluntly: \u201cShe looks like an anchor from Fox News, and that\u2019s probably the next job she\u2019ll get anyway.\u201d\n\nThe jaw-grazing bob has roots as an expression of freedom for women in the 1920s, with flappers like Louise Brooks eschewing the tradition of long hair in favor of a cropped cut.\n\nThough famed British stylist Vidal Sassoon re-popularized the bob in the 60s, earning ultra-stylish fans like Mia Farrow and Goldie Hawn, the style became a symbol of Boomer resignation in the 80s and 90s when female yuppies cut their hair as sharply as possible as statements of professional seriousness.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, Victoria Beckham kicked off third wave bob fever with her asymmetrical chop. Tabloids dubbed Posh\u2019s preferred cut the \u201cPob,\u201d and women across the America brought her photo to the salon for inspiration, as a sort of mid-aughts version of a \u201cRachel.\u201d\n\nWhich brings us to Ivanka\u2019s bob, which could be an optics ploy to communicate control in a derailed administration. After all, as a colleague noted, this is the efficient hairstyle of a suburb-dwelling, multi-tasking working mother who commands respect at the office, school gate, Starbucks line, yoga class, and Lululemon dressing room.\n\nIt is also an echo of the best bob on the best show on TV right now\u2014that belonging to Shiv Roy (Sarah Snook) in Succession; a bob that signals intelligence, wit, and brisk ruthlessness.\n\nIt is also perhaps a hair-appeal to the type of middle or upper middle-class woman Ivanka desperately hopes to relate to, even if that target demographic dutifully donates to Planned Parenthood every month in protest of her father's proposed abortion restrictions.\n\nBrown believes bobs can look stylish today, just not the one that currently lives on Ivanka's head. \u201cTo liven hers up, I would probably make the hair super straight and a bit dirty, or very loose waves, so there\u2019s some movement in it,\u201d she said.\n\nBut Ivanka has already had her fun as a New York cool girl and may be content to leave those bedhead days behind. As Refinery29 reported last year, Ivanka has only gone this short once before at the 2005 Met Gala, during the peak of Pob-mania.\n\n\u201c Short hair is easier to style, control, and maintain\u2014and bobs, as their time-spanning ubiquity shows, are popular because they can be pretty and practical \u201d\n\nOther than that instance, the socialite-turned-whatever-she-is-now has kept her blowouts long and bouncy, like a sorority sister attempting to copy a Kate Middleton Pinterest board. While working in her father's administration, Ivanka has shifted to stick-straight, center-parted, chest-length hair. It may be gone now, but don't cry\u2014the look is only one extension appointment away.\n\nIt could also be\u2014you know\u2014just a haircut. Short hair is easier to style, control, and maintain\u2014and bobs, as their time-spanning ubiquity shows, are popular because they can be pretty and practical. The bob does its job, so you can get on with yours.\n\n\u201cShe wants to mean business now,\u201d Brown mused. \u201cSince no one is taking her dad seriously.\u201d", "description": "Ivanka Trump's new bob gives off a \u201cTake me more seriously\u201d vibe, one hairdresser told The Daily Beast. \u201cYou appear more intentional, precise.
