So the North Carolina lawman encouraged another man to kill the officer, according to a felony indictment revealed late Tuesday night.\n\n\u201cThe only way you gonna stop him is kill him,\u201d Wilkins allegedly told the would-be shooter in a 2014 recorded phone call about a plan to kill former deputy Joshua Freeman. The plot was not carried out.\n\nWilkins is charged with two felony counts of obstruction of justice charges for his failure to arrest the unnamed person or report the threat on Freeman\u2019s life, and for also allegedly giving the man advice about how to get away with the murder.\n\nWilkins has been sheriff of the small county in northern North Carolina, where the biggest town is home to about 8,400 people, since 2009 and was most recently reelected in 2018. Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman, who brought the charges, told the News & Observer that Wilkins is still the sheriff.\n\n\u201cTechnically,\u201d the prosecutor said, \u201che can continue to serve if he chooses to until convicted.\u201d\n\nAccording to the indictment, Wilkins found out in 2014 that Freeman claimed to have a recording of the sheriff using \u201cracially offensive language,\u201d and that the deputy planned to publicly reveal the tape and turn it over to authorities in Raleigh. It\u2019s unclear what Wilkins might have said on that alleged tape or what became of the recording.\n\nIn the August 2014 phone call, prosecutors said, Wilkins\u2019s \u201cpersonal animosity\u201d toward Freeman led him to go along with the plan to kill the deputy. The recorded call makes it clear the sheriff had no intention to protect Freeman or intervene, according to the indictment.\n\nOn the call, the sheriff advised the unnamed man, whom Wilkins knew, that \u201cif you need to take care of somethin', just take care of something,\u201d according to the indictment.\n\nThe man gave Wilkins a specific time and location detailing when he planned to kill Freeman, plus described the firearm he planned to use in the shooting, the indictment says.\n\nWilkins then \u201ccounseled the individual how to commit the murder in a manner as to avoid identification,\" the indictment says.\n\nHe had two major pieces of advice for the would-be gunman. First, don\u2019t let police find the murder weapon. \u201cYou ain\u2019t got the weapon, you ain\u2019t got nothing to go on,\u201d Wilkins allegedly said.\n\nAnd second, don\u2019t talk. \u201cThe only way we find out these murder things is people talk,\u201d Wilkins allegedly said. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell nobody nothin', not a thing.\u201d\n\nWilkins assured the man that if he followed through on the killing, Wilkins would not reveal anything to authorities about having any prior knowledge of the plot, according to the indictment.\n\nThe indictment describes the person\u2019s threat as \u201ccredible.\u201d\n\nWilkins \u201cfailed to make reasonable and professional efforts to help prevent harm to victim Joshua Freeman, including failing to immediately warn Joshua Freeman of the credible threat ... or failing to effectuate an arrest of this individual,\u201d the indictment states. Wilkins \u201cfailed to properly execute his duties because of his personal animosity towards Joshua Freeman, who [Wilkins] was told had expressed an intention to publicly disclose to authorities a purported audio recording of the defendant using racially offensive language.\u201d\n\nWilkins did not immediately respond to a request for comment late Monday night.\n\nWilkins\u2019s indictment in Granville County comes after a 10-month investigation by the FBI and N.C. State Bureau of Investigation, although authorities were aware of the phone call since 2014, according to a news release from Freeman.\n\nThe Wake County prosecutor took over the investigation in 2018 after Granville County District Attorney Mike Waters disclosed a conflict of interest in the case, according to the news release. Waters may also be a witness in the case, because he represented Freeman in his private practice in 2014. At that time, Waters obtained a copy of the recording of Wilkins allegedly encouraging Freeman\u2019s killing. Waters contacted the FBI and handed over the recording in August 2014, he wrote in a letter to the Wake County district attorney.\n\nIn January 2017, Waters said he met with leaders of the State Bureau of Investigation and gave them the recording as well. After nothing appeared to be happening, he provided the recording to a different agent in October 2018 and also wrote to Freeman, asking her to take over and advise the state agency on whether to open an investigation due to his conflict. Freeman agreed.\n\n\u201cI have reviewed this recording,\u201d Freeman wrote to SBI agents, requesting help. \u201cIt contains a conversation between two individuals, one of whom appears to be the Granville County Sheriff, about a former deputy sheriff and culminates in a discussion about committing a homicide.\u201d\n\nWilkins appeared before a Granville County magistrate Monday and was released on a $20,000 bond.\n\nWilkins\u2019s office is also under investigation for its accounting practices and its drug interdiction unit, according to the Wake County district attorney. Freeman worked at the sheriff\u2019s office as a K-9 narcotics interdiction officer between 2011 and 2014, according to his LinkedIn profile, although it\u2019s unclear when he left the sheriff\u2019s office.\n\nFollowing Wilkins\u2019s indictment, the Granville Board of Commissioners called an emergency meeting for Tuesday morning, CBS17 reported.", "description": "\u201cThe only way we find out these murder things is people talk,\u201d the sheriff allegedly told the would-be shooter. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell nobody nothin', not a thing.\u201d", "authors": ["Meagan Flynn", "Morning Mix Reporter", "September At Am", "Meagan Flynn Is A Reporter On The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
