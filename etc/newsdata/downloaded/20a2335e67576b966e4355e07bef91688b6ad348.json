The then 460-centre outfit had launched a takeover of rival Affinity Education. The hearing is testing evidence about how another businessman, Nigel Elias, acquired $8.5 million shares in Affinity.\n\nThe court has heard allegations that Ms Hutson arranged for G8\u2019s finances to be used to fund the purchases. Mr Elias has not been charged.\n\nMs Greaves was general counsel for Wellington Capital, Ms Hutson\u2019s merchant bank.\n\nASIC had been investigating the matter and conducted Section 19 examinations in June 2016. Two months later, they raided Ms Greaves\u2019s Brisbane home and found items, the court heard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe raid came as Ms Greaves was leaving to go to work. An ASIC officer left her a card and asked her to come in for a voluntary interview.\n\nNeil Clelland, representing Ms Hutson, asked if Ms Greaves had been fearful of being charged with criminal offences. \u201cI guess I was. My house had just been raided,\u201d she said.\n\nMs Greaves later gave statements to ASIC, pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a two-year good behaviour bond, the court heard.\n\nMs Greaves maintained on Tuesday she had tried to be truthful with ASIC in the initial interrogation.\n\nThat included Ms Greaves initially indicating to ASIC officers that the first she had known about Mr Elias acquiring Affinity Education shares was when she read newspaper reports.\n\nBut her subsequent statements to ASIC detailed an alleged conversation she had with Ms Hutson about Mr Elias\u2019s ability to purchase shares, and another discussion in which Ms Hutson allegedly told her to relay that Mr Elias should not put certain details in an email.\n\nMr Clelland went through \u201cnumerous\u201d examples of differences in Ms Greaves 2016 answers and in subsequent statements.\n\n\u201dYou say to her Honour, on your oath, that this nonetheless, [is] simply a case of you having been afflicted by memory loss at the time of your Section 19 examination [in 2016], being unable to remember certain things, and then by the time March [2017] rolls around, you have acquired \u2013 not just a recollection of some matters \u2013 but a very detailed recollection of matters that is quite inconsistent with the answers you gave in your section 19 examination,\u201d he said.\n\nMs Greaves agreed.", "description": "Former general counsel tells she believed she had been rattled by the raid and eventually sought indemnity from any prosecution.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.3208%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_636%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f4087138988f289ed085d0a643497bdca2d84544", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
