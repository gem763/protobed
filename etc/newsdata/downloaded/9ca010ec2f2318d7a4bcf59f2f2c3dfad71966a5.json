But their final pool match against France was called off and it remains to be seen whether two weeks without a game will have a positive or negative on them.\n\nAs for Australia, they nearly lost to Fiji - and probably would have done had Reece Hodge been correctly sent off - and were beaten by main pool rivals Wales. A second-half comeback in that match gave them hope and they've followed that up with comfortable wins over Uruguay and Georgia.\n\nManu Tuilagi (left) will start alongside Farrell in England's revamped midfield on Saturday\n\nWhat can we expect?\n\nA very physical, fast-paced contest. Eddie Jones has moved away from the George Ford-Owen Farrell axis at 10-12 to pit Manu Tuilagi up against another wrecking ball of Pacific Island origin in Samu Kerevi at inside centre. Both sides also have two breakdown specialists in the back row with England picking Tom Curry and Sam Underhill to go up against David Pocock and Michael Hooper. The gameplan for both sides seems clear - bash it up the middle and get fast ball out to the backs.\n\nAny interesting sub-plots?\n\nCoaches Eddie Jones and Michael Cheika know each other very well from their days playing together at Randwick in Sydney in the 1980s. Both men went on to coach Randwick but avoided each other in their post-playing careers until Jones took the England job. Their record since then is Jones 6 Cheika 0 and the Wallabies boss will be desperate to change that.\n\nPrediction: England to win by 10 points in a high-scoring match\n\nNEW ZEALAND vs IRELAND\n\nKick-off: Saturday, 11.15am, Tokyo\n\nHow have they fared so far?\n\nLike England, New Zealand will have gone nearly two weeks without a match come kick-off after their final pool match against Italy was postponed because of Typhoon Hagibis. Recovered from a slow start to beat South Africa comfortably in their opener and ran riot against weak opposition in Canada and Namibia.\n\nIreland started brilliantly against Scotland, appearing to quash any questions about their form as they beat who were supposed to be their nearest rivals without conceding a try. Then came the seismic defeat against Japan which nearly knocked them out and has left them facing the favourites in the quarter-final.\n\nNew Zealand superstar Beauden Barrett will start at full-back against Ireland on Saturday\n\nWhat can we expect?\n\nIt would be naive to expect anything other than a comfortable New Zealand win but Ireland do have a chance if they can rediscover their 2018 form. Everything goes through half-backs Conor Murray and Johnny Sexton for Ireland but they may think twice about kicking so much with Beauden Barrett lurking at full-back for the All Blacks. Ireland will try and squeeze New Zealand into playing a compact match but the All Blacks can win in many different ways - expect them to find one that works.\n\nAny interesting sub-plots?\n\nDespite being out of form for most of 2019 and big outsiders with the bookies, Ireland have won two of their last three matches against New Zealand. So often the All Blacks have teams beaten in the tunnel but will find themselves in the rare position of being at a psychological disadvantage.\n\nPrediction: New Zealand to win by 14 points or more\n\nWALES vs FRANCE\n\nKick-off: Sunday, 8.15am, Oita\n\nHow have they fared so far?\n\nWales couldn't have hoped for much better, having won all four pool matches. The second half against Australia was tough but coming through it will have served them well. The first half against Uruguay demonstrated that they do not possess the depth of the likes of New Zealand and England but they have avoided injuries so far.\n\nFrance, as ever, seem to be teetering on the brink of disaster but have kept up their 100 per cent record of reaching World Cup knockout stages by squeaking past Argentina and Tonga. Dressing room is said to be unsettled after a row between coach Jacques Brunel and captain Guilhem Guirado.\n\nWales captain Alun Wyn Jones is integral to a pack who will expect to dominate France\n\nWhat can we expect?\n\nWales to have the upper hand in every department. The cliche tells us that France are unpredictable and can beat anyone on their day but the truth is they have been predictably average for some time now. The main exception to that, however, was their first-half display against Wales in the Six Nations, but they have shown no signs of repeating that form since. They will need to, and for 80 minutes, to win.\n\nAny interesting sub-plots?\n\nWales' defence guru for the past 12 years, Shaun Edwards, will join France in a similar role once the World Cup is over on a four-year deal. It's hard to believe that a man who has been the best in the business for so long will take his eye off the ball though - in fact he may know even more about the French now than most other sides.\n\nPrediction: Wales to win by 14 points or more\n\nJAPAN vs SOUTH AFRICA\n\nKick-off: Sunday, 11.15am, Tokyo\n\nHow have they fared so far?\n\nJapan have set the World Cup alight with their full-throttle brand of rugby, stunning both Ireland and Scotland to win their pool against the odds. More comfortable wins over Samoa and Russia ensure that they have a 100 per cent record.\n\nSouth Africa will be satisfied with their World Cup so far, though they have not really got out of third gear yet. The start against the All Blacks promised much but a failure to convert chances left them frustrated, and not much can be read into their wins over inferior opposition in the final three pool matches.\n\nJapan captain Michael Leitch (right) shares a joke with Kazuki Himeno in training\n\nWhat can we expect?\n\nA fascinating clash of styles. Japan are super-fit, super-fast and keep the ball moving, avoiding matches turning into arm-wrestles and keeping the ball in play with their exhilirating offloading game. South Africa are the complete opposite. They are the most physical side in world rugby and though they possess exciting talent behind the scrum in the likes of Cheslin Kolbe and Willie le Roux, they will be hoping to keep the game in the forward and starve Japan of the ball.\n\nAny interesting sub-plots?\n\nJapan's defeat of South Africa in Brighton in 2015 remains the greatest shock in Rugby World Cup history. Although South Africa went on to reach the semi-finals and Eddie Jones' Japan were knocked out at the pool stage, many of the Springboks' current squad are still scarred by the humiliation.\n\nPrediction: South Africa to win by less than seven points", "description": "The Rugby World Cup kicked off four weeks ago today and now, via 50 pool stage matches, we are down to eight teams.
