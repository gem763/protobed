Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang said Ms Payne's comments ignored the facts and were politically motivated. In a speech on Tuesday, Ms Payne said Australia would continue to challenge China's record of human rights violations. She pointed to China's alleged detention of at least one million members of the Uygur Muslim minority, and the arrest of a Chinese-Australian writer on espionage charges. Mr Shuang said the comments damaged relations between the two countries.
