But now that Medicare telehealth regulations are loosening, its popularity will only increase.\n\nThe aging population isn't the only group that stands to benefit from telehealth programs: Healthcare organizations that offer them are already earning early dividends, including cost avoidance, lowered readmission rates, and a greater number of patients served.\n\nAnd as technological advancements enable a prevention and wellness-based model, and consumer preferences shift in favor of more personalized care, consumers are opening up to these virtual solutions. In fact, 57% said they'd use telehealth for a remote general consultation if given the option, according to the 2018 Business Insider Intelligence Insurance Technology Study.\n\nWhat is telehealth?\n\nTelehealth \u2014 the use of mobile technology including video doctor visits and remote patient monitoring tools \u2014 extends the reach of physicians and healthcare providers beyond traditional clinical settings. Telehealth enables a constant relationship between patients and caregivers, and offers providers a continuous stream of real-time patient health data.\n\nWhat are telehealth services?\n\nTelehealth services leverage technology to provide long distance care health-related education for improved patient outcomes. Telehealth services can be delivered through a variety of methods including telecommunications, remote patient monitoring tools such as wearable technology, live video chatting, electronic record transmittal, and mobile health (mHealth) apps for mobile devices.

Telemedicine is a direct line \u2014 whether it's a phone call, video chat, or text message \u2014 to a physician or care provider via telecommunication. This is what most consumers think of when they think of telehealth.\n\nTelemonitoring\n\nTelemonitoring, also known as remote patient monitoring, is a healthcare delivery method within telehealth that uses technology to monitor patient health data outside of clinical settings. Telemonitoring refers to the specific technologies used to electronically transmit information between patients and physicians.\n\nTelehealth nursing\n\nTelehealth nursing, also called telenursing and nursing telepractice, is the use of telemedicine and technology for nurses to deliver care remotely. Telehealth nursing allows nurses to interact with patients and monitor their conditions through mobile devices, computers, audio and video technology, and remote patient monitoring tools.\n\nTelehealth physical therapy\n\nTelehealth physical therapy, also known as telePT, telemedicine PT, or virtual PT, enables physical therapists to deliver remote care to their patients through technology-based sessions, rather than a hospital or outpatient clinic. Common telehealth physical therapy practices include orthopedic physical therapy, geriatric physical therapy, and neurological physical therapy.\n\nTelepsychiatry\n\nTelepsychiatry, also called telehealth mental health or teletherapy, can involve direct interactions \u2014 whether texting, talking, or video-chatting \u2014 between patients and psychiatrists, as well as psychiatrists supporting primary care providers with mental health consultations and expertise. There are a number of telepsychiatry apps available including LARKR, Talkspace, and Pacifica.\n\nTelehealth reimbursement for Medicare and private insurance\n\nVirta is an online specialty medical clinic that uses telehealth programs to reverse type 2 diabetes Virta Health\n\nPrivate telehealth insurance coverage and reimbursement varies, though many states have \"parity\" laws requiring private insurers to reimburse healthcare providers for services delivered through telemedicine.

Telehealth enables providers to reduce admissions by extending physicians' reach, facilitating a constant relationship between patients and caregivers, and offering providers a continuous stream of real-time health data.\n\nTelehealth tools are helping to augment physician decision-making, tap into new revenue streams, and deliver more personalized care. Virtual doctor visits grant hospitals and clinics a broader reach, faster consultations, and improved patient engagement and loyalty.\n\nIn general, telehealth could supplant a big chunk of in-person healthcare interactions. Business Insider Intelligence estimates that existing telehealth tools and solutions can serve anywhere between 42% and 45% of the 1.2 billion instances of outpatient medical care that occur every year, per the CDC.\n\nWhat is the future of telehealth?\n\nThe Digital Health Ecosystem report from Business Insider Intelligence discusses how providers are turning to digital tech \u2014 including telehealth \u2014 to combat health systems' labor shortages and shrinking revenue.\n\nSome of the key takeaways from the report include how tech-focused entrants are acting as catalysts for change and threatening legacy players' bottom lines, as well as how key digital health solutions like EHRs, digital therapeutics, telehealth, AI, wearables, and blockchain are the foundation of the industry's digital awakening.\n\nWant to learn more about the fast-moving world of digital health?
