You\u2019ve written \u2018Nice to Melt Ya!\u2019 on my leg! You\u2019re calling my mum!\"\n\nThe stunt was held to raise funds for No Money Road trip across the UK, with all proceeds going to Global's charity.\n\nNext week, Roman will embark on the 1,000-mile journey, hosting five shows in five different locations.\n\nThe catch is that he has to complete the epic cycling trip without the use of his phone or any money.\n\n(Image: YouTube)\n\n(Image: YouTube)\n\nStarting on Monday, Roman will travel from Scotland to Wales and then eventually back to London in time for Global\u2019s Make Some Noise Day on Friday.\n\nRoman's route is set to be decided by his fellow Capital presenters and celebrity friends.\n\nHe\u2019ll have to complete challenges and he\u2019ll be calling on listeners as he attempts to make it to his next radio show in time.\n\n(Image: YouTube)\n\nRoman's charity challenge comes as the DJ is reportedly set to star in the 2019 series of I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!\n\nThe airwaves host, who is the son of Spandau Ballet's Martin Kemp and Wham! star Shirley and the godson of the late George Michael, has told his employers that he is using his annual leave to appear on I'm A Celebrity.\n\nAccording to The Sun , Roman's celebrity connections is what is thought to have made him an attractive camp mate to ITV bosses.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
