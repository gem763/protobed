Quarterly losses for Amazon AMZN, +0.33% , Netflix NFLX, -2.47% and Facebook FB, +0.02% probably haven\u2019t helped the index. One Netflix bull came out with a pretty bearish assessment of the video streamer Tuesday.\n\nOpinion: Amazon, Netflix and Apple shares are no longer beloved by the average investor\n\nHowever, Apple AAPL, +1.37% \u2014 is up 10% for the quarter so far at $218, and 38% year-to-date, likely getting some help from the iPhone 11 rollout. But Tim Cook\u2019s company is under-appreciated says our call of the day from Jefferies analysts.\n\nEquity analysts Kyle McNealy and George Notter have just come out with a recommendation for investors to buy Apple, and a target for shares to rise to $260. They say Wall Street fails to appreciate how much the company stands to benefit from fifth generation cellular network technology, which basically promises faster data connection for consumers.\n\n\u201cIn our view, current expectations for Apple\u2019s first 5G iPhone lineup are too low. They underestimate Apple\u2019s competitive position for 5G devices,\u201d they said.\n\nThey expect better iPhone sales than Wall Street, where current consensus forecasts call for 190 million iPhone units sold in fiscal year 2021 \u2014 seen as a big year for 5G devices. That\u2019s 9% below the 6-year unit shipment average for iPhone product cycles, said the analysts, who expect sales of 208 million for 2021.\n\nThey list a few reasons for their optimism: Most Apple customers will need a 5G upgraded device; the industry marketing push behind 5G will be huge with more product differentiation versus prior cycles; world-wide smartphone penetration will get higher and Apple has also expanded its own mid-range offerings.\n\nRead: Loss-averse investment managers help you cut risk by diversifying away from index funds\n\nThe market\n\nThe Dow DJIA, +0.41% , S&P SPX, +0.45% and Nasdaq COMP, +0.48% are moving higher on trade-talk hopes.

That helps explain the 19% year-to-date gain we\u2019ve seen for the index.\n\nUsing that percentage-of-days metric, the S&P is now on pace for the fourth best performance over more than 30 years, where the average is 54%. \u201cTo find a year with a higher percentage of days positive, one needs to go back to 1995\u2019s 62% and 1989s 60%,\u201d he says.\n\nThe quote\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see kids landing in the ICU, super sick, lungs whited-out very often.
