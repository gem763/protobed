We are such a good, close team, and we glued together so well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so pleased with that pommel routine and I\u2019m looking forward to the final. There\u2019s an upgrade I have on the start score that I can do, but I\u2019m just focusing on my job and hopefully producing some more clean routines.\n\n\u201cI said before coming in that this isn\u2019t just a World Championships.
