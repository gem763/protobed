Typically, I missed this 24-hour window of sweetness and light. I was off Twitter at the time, possibly because so much scorn has been poured on my head for tweeting \u201cI\u2019m really disappointed in the Queen\u201d in a sort of tongue-in-cheek reaction to her granting Boris Johnson permission to prorogue parliament a couple of days before.\n\nYes, I know NOW she didn\u2019t have a choice, but up until what shall now be known as the official Twitter \u201cprorogue day\u201d, I didn\u2019t really know what it meant. But as soon as I tweeted my naive reaction to Her Majesty giving the go ahead, the Twitter floodgates opened and suddenly many, many people on my Twitter timeline were instant experts in the fine art of proroguing, a word which to me still sounds like something unseemly one might do to a pig.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nListen, I don\u2019t blame these instant experts, I do it myself. Every time there\u2019s a World Cup, I\u2019m suddenly more knowledgeable about football than \u2013\u201dinsert name of someone who knows a lot about football\u201d. But I refuse to feel foolish about being in the political dark re: proroguing. No, I wasn\u2019t taught about it at school (I wouldn\u2019t have listened anyway) and no, I hadn\u2019t really picked up on the finer details of the process over the summer when the possibility of it happening started being bandied about, because it wasn\u2019t going to happen, was it? Until last Tuesday, even Johnson\u2019s uber-Brexit mates had pooh-poohed the idea and mentally, I\u2019d dismissed it. After all, Amber Rudd, Michael Gove et al said it was a daft idea. So I might be gullible, but I refuse to be labelled stupid and people who immediately leap down the throats of those of us who cheerfully expose our patchy political education need to check how patronising they\u2019re being, because sneering isn\u2019t ever helpful.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Getty\n\nThat said, at least thanks to Twitter I think I\u2019ve now grasped the proroguing basics, though I still maintain my right to imagine a The Crown-esque version of recent events in which Olivia Colman, she of the left-wing face (according to a journalist in The Telegraph) boots Johnson up the backside and thwacks him around the head with her handbag, whilst screeching \u201cprorogue my arse\u201d.\n\nAhem \u2013 this is possibly why I am a writer of fiction and have mercifully had the good sense to turn down Question Time on numerous occasions. I know my limits. And when I forget them, Twitter is always there to remind me. Phew, and yet, despite having had a week of being told on Twitter how thick I am, I\u2019m still on it, scrolling and commenting, \u201cliking\u201d and occasionally muting.\n\nTwitter has opened my eyes to a great many things over the decade or so since I first signed up, and I mostly find it an informative and friendly platform. But that\u2019s possibly because I follow nice people who are pretty like-minded, the arty, novel-reading Remainers, happy to swap HRT experiences and top coleslaw tips, tweeting pictures of butterflies and dahlias.\n\nSo while Twitter has taught me a great deal, it has also lulled me into a false sense of security. It\u2019s cocooned me among my own kind, because on the whole, like finds like and \u201clikes\u201d it. My Twitter is slap bang middle of the road, it\u2019s indie easy listening, it\u2019s this summer\u2019s non-Booker \u201cmust-read\u201d and what do you think of the new Bake Off contestants?\n\nWhat I enjoy most about Twitter is the massive, shared-over-the-garden-fence chat that everyone is welcome to join. What I don\u2019t like is when that chat goes sour and the experience turns into something dark and furious and I have a horrible feeling this is happening more frequently. Twitter has turned into a toxic family on Boxing Day and it doesn\u2019t take much for the whole thing to blow.\n\nOf course, there are still corners of social media where it\u2019s possible to believe that all really is well and where the dreaded \u201cB-word\u201d never gets a mention, if I want to feel really safe, I trawl through horticultural accounts of famous gardens, plant emporiums and flower specialists, these are the Twitter accounts for whom every day is positive and they are a balm to the soul.\n\nThe internet can both inform and protect you against political unrest, no wonder so many young people are glued to YouTube clips of shopping and eyebrow shaping, the real world at the moment is so very difficult and it\u2019s likely to get even trickier over the next few months. So for those of us who muck about on social media, I know not every day can be a \u201cPositive Twitter Day\u201d, but let\u2019s all make a concerted effort not to make things worse; let\u2019s promise to play as nicely as we possibly can and walk away when we can\u2019t.", "description": "Last Friday was apparently \u201cPositive Twitter Day\u201d with even the likes of\u00a0Julia Hartley-Brewer, aka\u00a0one of\u00a0Greta Thunberg\u2019s many adult antagonists, tweeting a picture of a sunrise before she cracked under the strain and resumed normal slagging-everyone-off service.
