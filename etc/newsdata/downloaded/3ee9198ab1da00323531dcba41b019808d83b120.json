That was where a worshipper made a grim discovery on Sunday evening\n\nMosque spokesman Syed Hasan said the incident was a 'very sad thing' and 'it's just a shock', and confirmed it had offered Mr Biswas shelter.\n\nMr Hasan said about 30 worshippers had attended the centre for prayers that evening.\n\nA New South Wales police spokesman confirmed Mr Biswas' death was 'non-suspicious' and that a report is being prepared for the Coroner.\n\nDaily Mail Australia contacted the Department of Home Affairs for comment on Tuesday, seeking to clarify Mr Biswas's legal status at the time of his death.\n\nFor confidential crisis support, call Lifeline on 13 11 14.", "description": "An asylum seeker has taken his own life at a mosque in Sydney's south-west, with worshippers making the grim discovery as they gathered for evening prayers.", "authors": ["Daniel Piotrowski For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/11/20022558-0-image-a-2_1571741724139.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
