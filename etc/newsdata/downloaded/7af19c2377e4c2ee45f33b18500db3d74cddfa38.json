There are government ministers who are evading scrutiny in this process.\n\n'People will be baffled why people haven't already been prosecuted for doing that a building which led to the deaths of 72 people and yet the individual actions of firefighters on the night of a fire are being subjected to scrutiny.'\n\n'Firefighters put their lives in danger all through that night. The real causes of what happened to Grenfell tower and why flammable cladding was wrapped around the building, that hasn't been addressed.'\n\nThe report also accuses LFB commissioner Dany Cotton of 'remarkable insensitivity' after she gave testimony insisting she would have done nothing differently.\n\nSurvivors are angry that Miss Cotton, Britain's most senior firefighter, is being allowed to retire next year at the age of 50 on a full pension estimated to be worth as much as \u00a32million.\n\nThe report, which leaked last night, found that fire chiefs' slavish adherence to the controversial 'stay put' policy prevented residents from escaping\n\nSir Martin Moore-Bick's scathing conclusions over 1,000 pages Cause of blaze It started due to an electrical fault in a fridge-freezer in flat 16 on the fourth floor. Flat owner Behailu Kebede will be absolved of any blame. More than 200 survivors and bereaved families are suing Whirlpool, which supplied the Hotpoint model in the flat. Brigade training The London Fire Brigade's preparation and planning for such a fire was 'gravely inadequate'. Experienced incident commanders had 'no training' on the dangers of combustible cladding or on how to evacuate a high-rise block. At the scene Firefighters displayed 'extraordinary bravery' but incident commanders failed to recognise that a full evacuation may have been necessary. If the decision to evacuate had been made it would have 'resulted in fewer fatalities'. Crucial information was not shared by senior officers. Control room There were 'shortcomings in practice, policy and training'. Call handlers did not always obtain the necessary information and were unaware of when to tell residents to evacuate. Commissioner The report criticises the London Fire Brigade's commissioner for her 'remarkable insensitivity' after she told a hearing in September 2018 she would change nothing about its response to the fire. Inferno's spread The 'principle reason' that the flames spread so quickly up the tower block was due to the rain screen panels which 'acted as a source of fuel'. The insulation boards behind the cladding panels also accelerated the fire's spread. These features were added during a refurbishment several months before the fire. Building design The failures of the building's safety design were 'rapid'. Many lobbies filled with fire 26 minutes after it started. But Sir Martin Moore-Bick said stairs were 'not absolutely impassable' over an hour into it. Regulations The tower's external walls failed to comply with building regulations. There is 'compelling evidence' the walls did not 'accurately resist the spread of fire' but 'actively promoted it'.\n\nIn her evidence to the inquiry in September last year, Miss Cotton said: 'I wouldn't change anything we did on the night.'\n\nShe also claimed no training could have prepared the fire crews, saying: 'I wouldn't develop a training package for a space shuttle to land in front of the Shard.'\n\nMr Wrack said he did not agree with Miss Cotton's assessment, adding: 'On my first day at training school, I was taught that you learn something from every incident that you attend and you adapt your knowledge based on those experiences.'\n\nSir Martin Moore-Bick, the retired judge who chaired the public inquiry, found that a full evacuation should have been implemented at least an hour before the order was given.\n\nThe report will fuel demands for the fire brigade to be prosecuted for corporate manslaughter.\n\nFire chiefs have already been interviewed under caution by police over possible breaches of health and safety regulations.\n\nThe blaze broke out at 12.54am and was out of control within minutes.\n\nBut the 'stay put' strategy \u2013 designed for tower block fires where the blaze is contained to a single flat \u2013 was only rescinded at 2.47am.\n\nToday on Good Morning Britain, former firefighter Jim Fitzpatrick MP claimed that on the night of the fire the building had not behaved as it was expected to.\n\nHe said: 'Nobody is hiding from this, all I was saying is there has been failure right across the piece in terms of the regulations the Government has laid down.\n\n'The materials, construction methods, the design aren't as safe as they ought to be and that's a failure of Government in terms of regulation, it's a failure of architects, designer engineers, construction companies\u2026 and in that instance there is failure right across the piece.'\n\nHe added: 'It was an absolutely horrendous night, many of them risked their lives to rescue people in the tower\u2026 every firefighter will be feeling guilty today.\n\n'Nobody is going to take anything from this other than guilt.'\n\nSir Martin states in his report: 'That decision could and should have been made between 1.30am and 1.50am and would be likely to have resulted in fewer fatalities.\n\nThe best part of an hour was lost before Assistant Commissioner (Andy) Roe revoked the 'stay put' advice.'\n\nSir Martin said there were 'a number of serious shortcomings in the response of the LFB' and found that these were 'for the most part systemic in nature'.\n\nSurvivors of the Grenfell Tower disaster joined by firefighters and supporters on the monthly silent march at Grenfell Tower on August 14, 2019 in London\n\nThe revelation comes ahead of the publication on Wednesday of the long-awaited first report from the inquiry in which the LFB is likely to be heavily criticised\n\nSpeaking this morning, former firefighter and MP Jim Fitzpatrick said that every firefighter would be 'feeling guilty today' following criticism from the inquiry\n\nWhen could people or firms face criminal action over Grenfell? One of the biggest investigations in the history of the Metropolitan Police is being carried out into the 2017 disaster, which killed 72 people including 18 children. But the force has been told to wait until the public inquiry into the blaze has published its final report before passing evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service to consider any criminal charges. This could mean that a decision will not be made until 2022, five years on from the disaster. The investigation, called Operation Northleigh, is looking at the construction, refurbishment and management of the tower, as well as the emergency response on the night of the fire. A team of 180 police officers and staff are working on the probe, which is looking at potential gross negligence manslaughter, corporate manslaughter and health and safety offences. Around 200 companies that had some involvement with the tower are of relevance to the investigation, which cost \u00a34.2 million last year, not including staff costs.\n\nHe added: 'The 'stay put' concept had become an article of faith within the LFB so powerful that to depart from it was to all intents and purposes unthinkable.'\n\nIn his 1,000-page report, which was leaked to The Daily Telegraph last night, Sir Martin makes 46 recommendations following a two-year investigation into how the fire in the west London tower block unfolded on June 14, 2017.\n\nHe says the 'principal reason' why the flames shot up the 24-storey high-rise at such speed was the combustible aluminium cladding used in the refurbishment of the tower.\n\nThe report also concludes the fire started as the result of an 'electrical fault in a large fridge-freezer' in a fourth-floor flat.\n\nThat finding is likely to bolster a multi-million-pound lawsuit being brought in the US against the corporation Whirlpool, manufacturers of the Hotpoint model that caught fire.\n\nBut Sir Martin reserves his most damning criticism for the fire service.\n\nHe praises the heroics and bravery of individual firefighters but says a relatively junior commander, Michael Dowden, was left in charge for far too long as the tragedy unfolded.\n\nSir Martin describes the lack of training at the fire services as an 'institutional' failure.\n\nHe concludes: 'Quite apart from its remarkable insensitivity to the families of the deceased and to those who escaped from their burning homes with their lives, the commissioner's evidence that she would not change anything about the response of the LFB on the night, even with the benefit of hindsight, only serves to demonstrate that the LFB is an institution at risk of not learning the lessons of the Grenfell Tower fire.'\n\nHe also says Miss Cotton's evidence 'betrayed an unwillingness to confront the fact that by 2017 the LFB knew (even if she personally did not) that there was a more than negligible risk of a serious fire in a high-rise building with a cladding system.'\n\nA graphic showing the people who died on the various floors of Grenfell Tower\n\nNabil Choucair, who lost six members of his family in the blaze, said: 'Dany Cotton is a disgrace to say she would not change anything.\n\n'She should in no way be given her pension until she is 65.'\n\nAnnouncing her retirement at the time Miss Cotton said: 'The utter devastation of the Grenfell Tower fire and its impact on so many people will never leave me.\n\n'I want to reassure my staff and all those affected by the tragedy that I will remain dedicated to leading London Fire Brigade through any findings from phase one of the Public Inquiry and into phase two which is expected to begin next January.\n\nThe report also accuses LFB commissioner Dany Cotton (pictured) of 'remarkable insensitivity' after she gave testimony insisting she would have done nothing differently\n\nThe report will be officially published tomorrow morning.\n\nPart two of the inquiry \u2013 examining the circumstances and causes of the disaster \u2013 begins in January.\n\nA London Fire Brigade spokesperson said: 'The Inquiry's findings are not being published until Wednesday morning and it would be inappropriate for us to comment on them until then.'\n\nAn inquiry spokeswoman said the chairman and whole team were 'dismayed and disappointed' that media had 'chosen to deprive those most affected by the fire - the bereaved, survivors and residents - the opportunity to read the report at their own pace and without the distraction of public discussion and commentary ahead of publication'.\n\nShe added: 'The inquiry has no further comment to make at this time.'\n\nYesterday MPs urged that the Home Office must 'look again' and increase the resources allocated to fire and rescue services.\n\nTory Philip Davies said fire and rescue services across the UK were 'extremely stretched' and 'need extra resources in the way that the police do'.\n\nThe report covers the first phase of the Grenfell inquiry and was due to be published in Easter, before several delays\n\nThe Grenfell Tower Inquiry have been critical of the release of information from the report prior to the official release on Wednesday\n\nHome Office Minister Kit Malthouse said he is 'confident fire and rescue services have the resources they need' to do their job effectively.\n\nHe added that the Government will 'have to learn lessons' about fire safety from the Grenfell inquiry, which is due to be published shortly.\n\nFire chiefs had 'no Plan B' after the 'Stay Put' advice failed Fire chiefs tackling the Grenfell Tower blaze have been accused of having no 'Plan B' when the infamous 'Stay Put' advice failed. Firefighters told residents to remain in their homes as flames consumed the 24-storey block in June 2017, but strict rules meant there should have been an alternative written plan to help families escape. Instead, people were forced to flee the building 'sporadically' as it became clear it was too dangerous to remain inside. Firefighters tackling blazes in high-rise buildings were advised that 'contingency plans for particular premises should cover: an operational evacuation plan being required in the event the 'Stay Put' policy becomes untenable', according to Government rules. But the London Fire Brigade's so-called Operational Risk Database (ORD) for Grenfell Tower, which was submitted to the inquiry into the disaster, makes no mention of a contingency plan. In evidence at the inquiry, Grenfell Tower's fire risk assessor Carl Stokes said: 'There can be no doubt that GRA 3.2 [a section of the Generic Risk Assessment] required the LFB to have an operational contingency plan in the event that the Stay Put policy became untenable\u2026 the ORD template has a space for the 'Operational Contingency Plan', which it seems, for the Tower, was not completed. 'No evidence about the existence of an Operation Contingency Plan has been given.' He added: 'On one view of the evidence, when Stay Put was changed, the alternative employed was a sporadic call to self-evacuation which relied on residents calling into the LFB, rather than the LFB having an operational means of contacting them.'\n\nConservative MP Philip Davies (Shipley) said: 'I certainly support the Government in their recruiting of an extra 20,000 police officers, but could I ask the minister to look again at the resources for the fire service?\n\n'Because they certainly are, in West Yorkshire and I suspect in other parts of the country too, extremely stretched at the moment.\n\n'The number of people on a fire engine is going down to try and mask over these stretched resources, so can I ask (Mr Malthouse) to look again, because the fire service need extra resources in the way that the police do too.'\n\nIn response, Mr Malthouse said: 'We have instituted recently, and had the results of, the first inspection regime of fire and rescue services for some time, which has been reassuring in parts, but does point towards particular areas that we need to address.\n\n'As I say, we had a good settlement from the Treasury this year from a financial point of view, and it will be for local fire and service chiefs to decide how they invest that extra money.'\n\nLabour's Vicky Foxcroft (Lewisham, Deptford) asked what the Government is doing to ensure the recruitment and retention of fire officers, particularly those who specialise in inspecting high-rise buildings in light of the Grenfell tragedy.\n\nAsking a departmental question to Home Office Ministers in the Commons, Ms Foxcroft said: 'Since Grenfell, London Fire Brigade has undertaken focused and enhanced visits to high-rise buildings using both station based crews and fire safety inspecting officers.\n\n'Inspecting officers are highly skilled individuals who ensure that those with responsibility for buildings are taking the necessary steps to uphold fire safety standards.\n\n'So what is the Minister doing to support brigades in recruiting and retaining officers in these essential, specialist roles?'\n\nMr Malthouse said: 'The Grenfell inquiry is due to be published shortly, we'll all have to learn lessons from the conclusions of that inquiry when it arises.'\n\nHe continued: 'We have secured an extremely good financial settlement for the fire service across the country this year, and I would urge fire chiefs, not least in light of the first ever set of inspections for some time, to invest in prevention.'", "description": "Matt Wrack (pictured), general secretary of the Fire Brigade Union, said those responsible for wrapping the London tower block in cladding should have faced scrutiny before 'brave' firefighters.", "authors": ["Alexander Robertson", "Joe Middleton For Mailonline", "Arthur Martin For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/29/11/20321848-0-image-a-2_1572348289441.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
