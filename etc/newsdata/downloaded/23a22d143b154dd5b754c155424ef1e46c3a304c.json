From population control to declaring war on hamburgers, the Democratic Party is now no longer hiding their far-left extremism when it comes to so-called climate change. South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg says that tackling this issue is a greater challenge than World War II. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) even threatened to suspend the filibuster to enact the Green New Deal, a policy initiative pushed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-NY) that seeks to transition the U.S. away from all fossil fuels in a decade, retrofit all buildings to energy-efficient standards, and pretty much bans the internal combustion engine. Yeah, it\u2019s another way of saying huge government. Andrew Yang suggested a car buy-back program and wants to ban all commercial air travel.\n\nYang says \u201cI love\u201d the Green New Deal, backs eliminating commercial air travelhttps://t.co/d3yjtlSzxv pic.twitter.com/5yHYQlbIl2 \u2014 RNC Research (@RNCResearch) September 4, 2019\n\nKamala Harris says Americans need to be \"educated about the effect of our eating habits on our environment,\" and says she would change the dietary guidelines to reduce the amount of red meat you can eat. #ClimateTownHall pic.twitter.com/XqcFzLv479 \u2014 Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) September 4, 2019\n\nJoe Biden says \"We've got to shut down\" all coal-fueled power plants, which provided 27% of all electricity in the United States last year.\n\n\n\nGet ready for higher electric bills! pic.twitter.com/hShAc6iwoo \u2014 Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) September 5, 2019\n\nButtigieg: if you eat hamburgers or use straws, you are \"part of the problem\"https://t.co/4Bms5bydAQ pic.twitter.com/vHuGVc3Mrj \u2014 RNC Research (@RNCResearch) September 5, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nEmperor Harris is also going after red meat, so Fourth of July and Labor Day are now canceled. But more disturbingly, these policies are aimed at attacking the daily lives of Americans. Former Vice President Joe Biden virtually repeated Hillary Clinton\u2019s war cry of wanting to put coal workers out of a job. How did that turn out for her in 2016? This is a backdoor maneuver for the Left\u2019s larger socialist agenda. We all know this. It\u2019s intrusive. This is big government shacking up inside the American home in perpetuity. This agenda dictates what you can eat, what you can drink, what mode of transportation you can use, and, like most far-left agendas, has an authoritarian ethos. If you divert off the path, you\u2019re part of the problem. And this project will cost trillions on top of the $30+ trillion for the Medicare for All initiative that will destroy private health insurance. As the RNC noted, it\u2019s \u2018ban all the things.\u2019 You don\u2019t know how to care for yourselves, or worse, you just don\u2019t know how says the government. We will show you how to live the right way...under penalty of jail. That\u2019s what Democrats want to enact when fighting so-called global warming. They want to maximize government control over all spheres of socio-political life.", "description": ".09/06/2019 8:02:33AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/212/1879fb9a-6b08-4f99-98b1-202a1c3227ae.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
