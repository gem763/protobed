From the front, you could see the sparks and the fire burning quite high,\" she said.\n\nUniversity spokesperson Martin Viljoen confirmed that students at the residence had all been safely evacuated.\n\n\"It\u2019s not only our res, but [our] home which we had to watch on fire,\" K\u00f6hler said.\n\nShe added that the extent of the damage was well contained and was not as bad as they had expected, given the size of the blaze.\n\nThe cause of the fire is not yet known.\n\nDetermination on safety\n\nOne student was treated for burn wounds, while another was treated for smoke inhalation. Both students were doing well, according to Viljoen.\n\nAn assessor is expected to make an inspection on Tuesday. Together with the university\u2019s facilities management, they will make a determination on when the residence is safe for entry.\n\nEight rooms on the top floor of the residence were damaged.\n\nZo\u00eb Human, journalist at student publication MatieMedia, who stays at a residence not far from Huis ten Bosch, said upon hearing about the fire, students at her residence had started organising donations for affected students at Huis ten Bosch.\n\n\"We were also asked to check whether there were any available rooms to accommodate some of the students. It was really cool seeing people come together in such a trying time,\" she added.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
