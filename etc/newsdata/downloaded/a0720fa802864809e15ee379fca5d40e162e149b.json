The suit, filed Monday against First Access Entertainment and its associates, alleges the tour company encouraged drug use and began providing drugs for Peep beginning early 2017, according to TMZ. The amount of damages is unspecified. The lawsuit notes one early instance in London, when a manager gave Peep a bottle of pills at a dinner. By May 2017, in Los Angeles for the Come Over When You\u2019re Sober tour, Peep was \u201cbarely able to communicate, let alone perform, due to his use of drugs,\u201d his mom alleges, specifically citing an availability of Xanax and ketamine on the tour. As the tour went on, management forced Peep to perform despite his desires to quit, Womack says, until a final tour stop in El Paso, when a manager told him to make himself sick with \u201can excessive amount of Xanax\u201d \u2014 that way, insurance could cover a canceled show. Peep was found dead shortly afterward, on November 15, 2017, on his tour bus, having overdosed on Xanax and fentanyl.\n\nMeanwhile, Peep\u2019s legacy will live on in a new documentary, which released a trailer last week. It\u2019s executive produced by Womack, along with Terrence Malick and Sarah Stennett. Called Everybody\u2019s Everything, it debuted at South by Southwest in March, and will hit theaters in November. Watch the trailer below, which features interviews with Post Malone and iLoveMakonnen along with Womack and Peep.", "description": "Liza Womack, mother of the late emo rapper Lil Peep, alleges her son\u2019s management and touring company provided and promoted drugs that led to his overdose in a new lawsuit.
