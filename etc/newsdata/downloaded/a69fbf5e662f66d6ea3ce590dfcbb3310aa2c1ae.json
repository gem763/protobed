You see other ladies who have been through traumatic situations take time off work, but I just wasn\u2019t willing to do that,\u201d she said.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

I didn\u2019t want to miss this journey that the Roses were on because, in a way \u2013 and it\u2019s awful to say \u2013 the Roses were my priority.\u201d\n\nNeville, who suffered another miscarriage at Christmas, then made the decision to leave the Roses as head coach to focus on family, a choice she described as \u201cone of the most difficult of my life\u201d.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

We know that I\u2019m 42 and the risks are high, but it creates a fearful environment,\u201d she said.\n\nInstead, Neville wants the conversation on older mothers to be more positive.\n\n\u201c[The doctors] go down the route of, \u2018Well, we\u2019re preparing you for the fail\u2019. I don\u2019t prepare my team for the fail.\n\n\u201cWhy is pregnancy not targeted like that? Why is it not given that positivity?\u201d\n\nRuth Bender-Atik, national director of the Miscarriage Association, which offers support to those affected by miscarriage, told The Independent: \u201cEmotional recovery after miscarriage varies.\n\n\u201cFor some people it helps to get back to routine as soon as possible and maybe to try for another pregnancy quite quickly. Others need more time, not only to grieve but also to think about when, or even whether, to try again. It can really help to talk to others who understand,\u201d she said.\n\nFor advice and support on miscarriage, contact The Miscarriage Association at www.miscarriageassociation.org.uk", "description": "Tracey Neville has revealed she suffered a miscarriage one day after leading the England netball team to Commonwealth gold.", "authors": ["Joanna Whitehead"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/24/11/gettyimages-1163359307.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
