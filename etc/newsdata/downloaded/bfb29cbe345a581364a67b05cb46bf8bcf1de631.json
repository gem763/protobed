By the time the call was over 30 minutes later, it quickly became clear that it was anything but.\n\nSoon after President Trump put the phone down that summer day, the red flags began to go up. Rather than just one head of state offering another pro forma congratulations for recent elections, the call turned into a bid by Mr. Trump to press a Ukrainian leader in need of additional American aid to \u201cdo us a favor\u201d and investigate Democrats.\n\nThe alarm among officials who heard the exchange led to an extraordinary effort to keep too many more people from learning about it. In the days to come, according to a whistle-blower complaint released on Thursday, White House officials embarked on a campaign to \u201clock down\u201d the record of the call, removing it from the usual electronic file and hiding it away in a separate system normally used for classified information.\n\nBut word began to spread anyway, kicking off a succession of events that would eventually reveal details of the call to the public and has now put Mr. Trump at risk of being impeached by a Democrat-led House for abusing his power and betraying his office. The story of the past two months is one of a White House scrambling to keep secrets to protect a president willing to cross lines others would not, only to find the very government he frequently disparages expose him.", "description": "The alarm among officials who heard the exchange between President Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart led to an extraordinary effort to keep many more people from learning about it.", "authors": ["Peter Baker"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/us/politics/26dc-tictoc1/26dc-tictoc1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
