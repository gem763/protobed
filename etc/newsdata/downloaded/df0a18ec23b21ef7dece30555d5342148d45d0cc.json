Biden was mentally fit to be president, pulling back the curtain on a debate that has been raging inside the Democratic Party since the former vice president entered the race.\n\nFor Carlos Cardona, chairman of the Laconia New Hampshire Democrats, it was an uncomfortable subject that nevertheless had to be broached.\n\n\u201cHe is like our Uncle Joe. People love Joe. Joe is a good person,\u201d Mr. Cardona said. \u201cIt is just more and more we are seeing a different Joe, and when you love somebody and they are changing, mentally or physically, and they are aging in a way you are not excited about, it is bittersweet.\u201d\n\nMr. Cardona was among the 14 million viewers that tuned into the third presidential debate and watched Mr. Castro passionately challenge Mr. Biden to come clean on whether he was having memory lapses on stage.\n\nThe line of attack generated groans from the audience and an immediate backlash from talking heads in the mainstream media \u2014 and even some of the other Democratic 2020 presidential hopefuls \u2014 who accused Mr. Castro of playing the age card against Mr. Biden, 76.\n\nBut Mr. Cardona, who is backing 78-year-old Sen. Bernard Sanders, said he doesn\u2019t didn\u2019t see it that way.\n\n\u201cI know plenty of 70-year-olds who can run a marathon better than me, and probably outscore me on an SAT test,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t play the age game. I think it is about the capability [of a candidate] for me more than anything.\u201d\n\nSen. Cory Booker of New Jersey raised similar concerns in a post-debate interview, telling CNN \u201cthere are definitely moments when you listen to Joe Biden and you just wonder.\u201d\n\nBut Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota took Mr. Biden\u2019s side, invoking the \u201cT-word\u201d against Mr. Castro. \u201cWhen a statement like that is made \u2026 it feels like something Donald Trump might tweet out,\u201d she said.\n\nFor his part, Mr. Biden is making light of the situation. Asked over the weekend whether he would disclose his medical records, he said,\u201dYou wanna wrestle?\u201d\n\nMr. Biden\u2019s mental fitness has been a big question mark hanging over the race.\n\nPresident Trump has tried to stoke the uncertainty by nicknaming him \u201csleepy Joe,\u201d and describing him as \u201ccrazy\u201d and a \u201clow IQ individual.\u201d\n\nWhile nobody suggested that Mr. Biden is feeble or suffering from dimentia, the most common assessment was that he is not at the top of his game. His performance in the debates this year were a mere shadow of his debate stage prowess in years past, such as with Republican Paul Ryan in the 2012 vice presidential debate. After the Ryan bout, The Guardian described Mr. Biden as putting on an \u201calpha-male display,\u201d and Rolling Stone magazine said he \u201csteamrolled\u201d Mr. Ryan.\n\nNone of those descriptions are being applied to Mr. Biden\u2019s performances these days. After last week\u2019s debate, the Washington Post graciously gave him a B+.\n\nJim McLaughlin, a Republican pollster working with the Trump re-election campaign, said they were not polling about Mr. Biden\u2019s mental acuity but Democrats and news organizations were asking the question.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it is already showing up in surveys and I\u2019m sure it is being asked,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is going to come. It\u2019s out there.\u201d\n\nHe said questions about age and fitness for a successful campaign cut to the heart of Mr. Biden\u2019s chief argument for his candidacy: that he is the candidate best able to defeat Mr. Trump.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s his message: \u2018I am the guy who can beat Trump.\u2019 But I don\u2019t think at the end that\u2019s going to be enough for the Democratic primary voters,\u201d Mr. McLaughlin said.\n\nMr. Biden has suffered from a series of self-inflicted wounds. There have been verbal gaffes, well-documented memory woes on the stump, and recently blood pooling in his eye during a town hall-style forum on CNN. Things got tougher in the debate. His teeth appeared to almost shake loose. Mr. Castro passionately said, \u201cAre you forgetting what you said just two minutes ago?\u201d\n\nThe Biden camp later correctly pointed out that Mr. Castro had misconstrued the former veep\u2019s comments.\n\nStill, the clip of the exchange went viral and dominated debate coverage, forcing Democrats to ponder whether Mr. Biden is the best equipped to not only defeat Mr. Trump but also lead the nation.\n\nThom Hart, former chairman of the Scott County Iowa Democrats, said he thought Mr. Castro\u2019s attack smacked of desperation from a long-shot candidate.\n\nHe predicted it won\u2019t have a lasting impact on the race, comparing it to when Sen. Kamala Harris of California jabbed at Mr. Biden in the June debate for opposing federal busing to desegregate public schools in the 1970s.\n\nThe feisty confrontation gave Ms. Harris a temporary bounce in the polls but didn\u2019t knock Mr. Biden from the front-runner position or alter the long-term shape of the race.\n\n\u201cThe more minor folks try to have their come-out moment by peeling one of the frontrunners and I think people are not real keen on that Trumpian approach to the nomination,\u201d said Mr. Hart.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, he said people are missing Mr. Biden\u2019s meandering style.\n\n\u201cI have known Biden for 40 years and I think that has always been part of his makeup,\u201d said Mr. Hart. \u201cI would put him kind of in the category of a smart-aleck who is good with the quips, and I don\u2019t see that as mental acuity thing. I think that is the personality and I think a lot of people are really focusing on that. I also think if that were a disqualifier Trump would not be president.\u201d\n\nMr. Castro on Sunday lost one of his highest-profile endorsement with Rep. Vicente Gonzalez saying he is switching his support to Mr. Biden, though the Texas Democrat said his switch wasn\u2019t a direct result of, or backlash from, the Thursday night debate moment.\n\nMr. Gonzalez, who endorsed Mr. Castro back in March, said the former San Antonio mayor wasn\u2019t performing well in the polls.\n\n\u201cI think at this point in time we need to narrow the field and unite as Democrats to defeat Trump in November 2020,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d\n\nWith Mr. Gonzalez gone, Mr. Castro now has two endorsements by sitting members of Congress, one of them being brother Joaquin Castro. The other is Rep. Colin Allred of Texas.\n\n\u2981 Gabriella Mu\u00f1oz contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
