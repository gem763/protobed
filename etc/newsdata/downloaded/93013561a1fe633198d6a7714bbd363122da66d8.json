Jim Banks Slams Reddit: \u2018Admission of Political Prejudice\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN), who recently sent a letter to Reddit CEO Steve Huffman urging the company to stop meddling in the 2020 election by censoring its largest pro-Trump community, \u201cr/The_Donald\u201d, responded to Reddit\u2019s decision, reported earlier today, not to lift the sitewide \u201cquarantine\u201d of the community.\n\nRep. Banks drew attention to Reddit\u2019s refusal to offer r/The_Donald, a user-created \u201csubreddit\u201d of over 700,000 Trump supporters, a clear methodology behind the site\u2019s decision to censor them.\n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t Reddit \u2018share the methodology\u2019 used to make their decision to quarantine r/The_Donald? Because they don\u2019t have one,\u201d said Rep. Banks in a statement, provided exclusively to Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cThis is an admission of political prejudice. The world\u2019s third-largest social media site should not make politically motivated publishing decisions.\u201d\n\nReddit decided to \u201cquarantine\u201d r/The_Donald in June this year, citing violent threats made by users that were not removed with sufficient speed by the community\u2019s moderators. Following the decision, users of r/The_Donald compiled a report showing that far-left communities on Reddit routinely feature even more extreme violent threats, sometimes failing to take them down altogether, without facing any top-down censorship from Reddit\u2019s leadership.\n\nRep. Banks called out the site\u2019s double standards earlier this week, in a letter provided exclusively to Breitbart News.\n\n\u201cThe same content-policy violations that led to r/The_Donald\u2019s quarantine take place regularly and egregiously in numerous left-wing subreddits,\u201d wrote Banks.\n\n\u201cAfter the controversy in Oregon, a commenter in the liberal subreddit r/Politics had the following to say about Republican legislators: \u2018Shoot these f*ckers. In the knees. For running like pieces of sh*t.\u2019 Not one of the comments that led to r/The_Donald\u2019s ban reached such a staggering level of vitriol.\u201d\n\nRep. Banks cited a 2018 interview in which Huffman boasted of Reddit\u2019s ability to \u201csway elections,\u201d coupled with a promise not to do it. Reddit is one of the most popular websites on the internet, with a userbase approximating that of Twitter.\n\nR/The_Donald is one of the web\u2019s most active communities of Trump supporters, and played a crucial role as a center of pro-Trump online grassroots activity in the 2016 election. Censorship of the community represents a major attack on the Trump campaign\u2019s online grassroots power in 2020.\n\nAre you an insider at Reddit or any other tech company who wants to confidentially reveal wrongdoing or political bias at your company?
