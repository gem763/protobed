I think this administration truly might help us. I don\u2019t think they are as closed about what happened.\"\n\nShe added: \"He [Mr Trump] knows her story. He's been briefed on it, and he knows, and that\u2019s important to me. I don\u2019t think anything would have stopped him from getting this guy.\"\n\nBaghdadi killed himself by detonating a suicide vest during a US raid named after Kayla Mueller Credit: AP More\n\nMrs Mueller added to CNN: \"I just want to say how grateful we are to this administration, to the military, and to the special forces that went in.\n\n\"We were deeply touched by what he [Mr Trump] said. We were grateful that they didn't mess around and went right in.\"\n\nMiss Mueller, an aid worker, was taken hostage in 2013. Her death was announced in 2015 but her body has not been recovered.\n\nDuring her captivity her family was encouraged by the US government not to make the situation public or to pay a ransom.\n\nFollowing their daughter's death the Muellers became critics of how the US government had handled hostage situations. Carl Mueller, her father, became a vocal supporter of Mr Trump, speaking at his rallies.\n\nAfter Baghdadi's death Mr Mueller told the Arizona Republic: \"What this man [Baghdadi] did to Kayla - he kidnapped her. She was held in many prisons. She was held in solitary confinement. She was tortured. She was intimidated. She was ultimately raped by al-Baghdadi himself.\n\n\"He either killed her or he was complicit in her murder. I\u2019ll let people who read this article make up their own mind how a parent should feel.\"", "description": "The parents of Kayla Mueller, who died while being held hostage by Islamic State, praised Donald Trump's \"decisiveness\" and criticised Barack Obama's handling of their daughter's captivity.", "authors": ["Nick Allen"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SG76uecEbx2zVnTkCebKog--~B/aD0xMjUwO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_telegraph_818/94fd0ce22e8979c9d4be1902c190f73d", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
