They bled and died because they believed in the partnership they had established with the United States and we just threw them under the bus in 24 hours. It\u2019s appalling, it\u2019s disgraceful,\u201d Rice explained.\n\n\u201cAnd then today, when the Turks quite predictably are bombing the bejeezus out of Syria and Trump allegedly orders the U.S. military not to come to their defense, not to protect them, we\u2019ve crossed a rubicon here of the trail that I think is going to haunt us for decades to come,\u201d she continued. \u201cWe are handing over our Kurdish allies to slaughter, and that blood is going to be on Donald Trump\u2019s hands.\u201d\n\nRice had earlier accused Trump of making U.S. foreign policy all about himself.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s appalling. It is so much worse than I imagined. Every day a lie, a disparagement and a trashing of the institutions and the norms that we all believe have held us together,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what is so extraordinary is it\u2019s all about him. We talk about foreign policy, and he said his doctrine is America first, but I think we\u2019re seeing it is really me first. And that\u2019s how he is governing. Everything is about him.\u201d\n\nCheck out the full interview here:", "description": "\"We\u2019ve crossed a rubicon here [...] that I think is going to haunt us for decades to come,\" said the Obama-era national security adviser.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9eda58210000c008acc313.jpeg?cache=0hiuuq1it6&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
