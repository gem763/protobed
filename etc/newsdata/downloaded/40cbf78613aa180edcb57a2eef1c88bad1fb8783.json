Payroll processor ADP reported that companies added 135,000 employees in September, down from the year-ago period and falling short of forecasts.\n\n\"Worries over the global slowdown continue to build. Then throw in impeachment discussions and protests in Hong Kong, and we have a 'sell first and ask questions later' market on our hands,\" said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial.\n\nA ruling by a world trade body allowing the U.S. to impose tariffs on European goods as retaliation for illegal subsidies to Airbus also raised fears that global trade tensions could get worse.\n\nOther signs show that the U.S. economy is weakening.
