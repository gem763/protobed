Inouye International Airport in Honolulu as the worst among 62 airports in North America, according to the J.D. Power 2019 North America Airport Satisfaction Study.\n\nLaGuardia\u2019s satisfaction score was 662 out of a possible 1,000, while Newark\u2019s was 695. Honolulu, meanwhile, scored a 719.\n\nThe annual study, conducted from October 2018 through September, was based on responses from more than 32,200 American or Canadian residents who traveled through at least one North American airport. The survey scored airports several different factors, including: terminal facilities, airport accessibility, baggage claim, security check, check-in and baggage check, food, beverage and retail.\n\nDetroit\u2019s airport ranked as the highest in passenger satisfaction, with a score of 786. It was followed by the Minneaopolis-Saint Paul International Airport, Las Vegas McCarran International Airport and the Orlando International Airport.\n\nThe common theme among those top-performing airports were relatively new facilities that helped to accommodate a surge in passenger volume, the incorporation of local food and drink offerings, and easier access for passengers.\n\nOverall, the study found that after several years of growth, traveler satisfaction stagnated as North American airports struggled to handle more passengers amid a swath of construction-related delays.\n\n\u201cWhile these projects are absolutely necessary to address surging demand, they are currently causing passenger delays and confusion,\u201d said Michael Taylor, J.D. Power\u2019s travel intelligence lead. \u201cThis translates into a rushed passenger experience and less money spent on food, beverage and retail\u2014and it\u2019s slowing the progress of the airport satisfaction we\u2019ve seen in the past several years.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Traveler satisfaction stagnated as North American airports struggled to handle more passengers amid a swath of construction-related delays.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/08/0/0/iStock-Ft-Lauderdale.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
