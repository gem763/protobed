He could have had a hat-trick but was hauled down by some desperate defence late on.\n\nIn a World Cup of shocks this looked one of the most predictable of pools and Rassie Erasmus\u2019 side are primed to join the All Blacks in the last eight.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

He might not be the only one to have his collar felt.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. Rugby World Cup 2019 best pictures Show all 35 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe replacement prop Nicola Quaglio, a loose head playing tight head in extremis, was lucky to stay on the field as he and Lovotti combined to dump South African No.8 Duane Vermueulen on his head. Lovotti gave Wayne Barnes no choice but Italy could have easily have been down to 13 men.\n\nWith the Eben Etzebeth allegations of racism and assault swirling around and awaiting and inquiry from the Equality Court, at the recommendation of the South African Human Rights Commission, a game was just what the Boks needed.\n\nIt is unclear if Etzebeth will have his tournament interrupted by the furore but he was on duty here as South Africa went to the break 17-3.\n\nItaly had actually come into this game as leaders of Pool B after wins over Namibia and Canada but a quarter-final place looks beyond them with the All Blacks to come. They beat the Boks in Florence in 2016 but they were never going to beat them here.\n\nKolbe, 25, exposed the folly of Italy picking a centre, in the shape of Michele Campagnaro, to mark him when he went through his opposite number and Luca Morisi to score in the sixth minute off Willie le Roux\u2019s long pass.\n\nBy then the Italian tight head prop Simone Ferrari had gone off with what looked like a hamstring injury and been replaced by Marco Riccione.\n\nBy the 19th minute, Riccione, who had already had his ribs strapped, was off for a Head Injury Assessment and the uncontested scrums started with Quaglio not able to play tight-head.\n\nThat should have suited Italy who had a Tommasso Allen on the board and they actual got some go forward off the set piece a couple of times.\n\nThe Springboks second try came from a driving maul after they had turned down a penalty shot to kick touch with hooker Mbongeni Mbonambi crashing over and the writing looked on the wall for the Italians.\n\nThen came the red card and South Africa looked to apply their foot to the throat of the Italians. Flanker Pieter-Steph du Toit had a try chalked off for obstruction by captain Siya Kolisi and Conor O\u2019Shea\u2019s side were in finger-in-the-dam territory.\n\nHendre Pollard\u2019s second penalty made it 20-3 and in the 53rd minute Kolbe scooted over for his second from the fly-half\u2019s chip. Game, set and match then centre Lukhanyo Am\u2019s interception and run in nailed the bonus point.\n\nKolbe\u2019s opposite wing Makazole Mapimpi got in the act on the 66th minute rounding off a fine move and the Italians looked out on their feet when Louis Snyman and Malcom Marx made it seven tries. They are as good as out of the World Cup.", "description": "Cheslin Kolbe proved that being big is not the only way to be beautiful on a rugby pitch with two tries as South Africa\u00a0moved to the top of Pool B and put one foot in the World Cup\u00a0quarter-finals.", "authors": ["Adam Hathaway"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/04/12/south-africa-italy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
