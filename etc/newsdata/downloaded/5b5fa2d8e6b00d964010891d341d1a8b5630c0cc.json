(Picture: Getty)\n\nLucifer\u2019s writing team know how to tease the fans and keep them on edge as we wait patiently (well\u2026 a little patiently) for season 5 to finally come our way.\n\nDropping episode titles one-by-one, things have been getting more difficult to figure out \u2013 but episode four title hint is literally driving us mad.\n\nI$ N#### E&&& W*** F\u201d\u201d T__ C@@@@@@\u2019 is all we\u2019ve got to go on at the moment, alongside a couple of emojis including a thinking face, a devil and\u2026 a chicken.\n\nSo this could be something either incredibly hilarious, or incredibly worrying for one of our detective squad.\n\nAs Lucifans put their own detective skills to work, in efforts that would make Chloe Decker (Lauren German) proud, they reckon they\u2019ve cracked it\u2026almost.\n\nIt could be \u2018It Never Ends Well For The Captain\u2019 or \u2018It Never Ends Well For The Chicken\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the realms of the weird and wonderful world of Lucifer, both are completely plausible \u2013 with Captain\u2019s at the precinct never exactly faring well on the series.\n\nBut if that\u2019s the correct version\u2026could it suggest that Marcus Pierce (Tom Welling) aka original sinner Cain, aka the Captain who fell in love with Decker, be coming back?\n\nWhat\u2019s the little devil up to now? (Picture: Netflix)\n\nShow bosses Joe Henderson and Ildy Modrovich previously said in a Q&A that a familiar face will be returning to the show now that Lucifer (Tom Ellis) is back on his throne in Hell.\n\nQuestion would be who though.\n\nAlternatively, we could be getting an answer/throwback to jokes from previous seasons involving the ultimate question in the universe\u2026 \u201cwhy did the chicken cross the road?\u201d\n\nChloe previously joked to Lucifer about chickens, and Ella Lopez (Aimee Garcia) also owned a chicken at one point. Throw in a chicken emoji and things are getting complicated.\n\nIn the meantime, we know the title of the first three episodes.\n\nEpisode one will be named Really Sad Devil Guy \u2013 which is appropriate seeing as he\u2019s been forced back down to look over Hell despite just admitting his love for Decker.\n\nIn the second, Lucifer! Lucifer! Lucifer!, it seems that someone is, at the very least, going to call him out, but that means nothing really when he can conjure up pretty much anything he wants.\n\nMore: Lucifer Lucifer's Trixie returns to set for season 5 and now we feel seriously old Lucifer season 5 episode 3 title tease could see devil's reunion with Chloe Decker Lucifer final season: Episode 2 title has been confirmed and reveals a hefty spoiler\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd the third, despite fans being convinced that it was going to be a reunion episode centred on and titled Decker, it was actually Diablo\u2026which is just another Devil reference.\n\nCome on gang\u2026we need some answers immediately!\n\nLucifer seasons 1 to 3 are on Amazon Prime Video and season 4 is available on Netflix.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
