REUTERS/Ronen Zvulun\n\nGantz, a former armed forces chief who heads the centrist Blue and White Party, planned to make a statement at 2 p.m. (1100 GMT), a spokesman said.\n\nMaking the surprise offer, Netanyahu, head of the right-wing Likud party and Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader, said in a video clip that in the run-up to Tuesday\u2019s election, he had pledged to form a right-wing government.\n\n\u201cBut to my regret, the election results show that this is impossible,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cBenny, we must set up a broad unity government, as soon as today. The nation expects us, both of us, to demonstrate responsibility and that we pursue cooperation.\u201d\n\nIn subsequent comments, at a ceremony - which Gantz also attended - marking the third anniversary of the death of Israeli statesman Shimon Peres, Netanyahu said his offer came with no preconditions. A smiling Netanyahu and Gantz warmly shook hands at the event.\n\nNetanyahu hinted at a possible rotating premiership deal with Gantz, noting that Peres, a left-wing leader, had forged a coalition with conservative Yitzhak Shamir in which they rotated top office between 1984 and 1988.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s comments reflected his heightened political vulnerability after again failing to security a parliamentary majority, following an inconclusive election in April.\n\nPresident Reuven Rivlin, who commands wide respect in Israel in his largely ceremonial position, said he welcomed Netanyahu\u2019s unity call. Under Israeli law, Rivlin taps a party leader to try to form a government after the final vote tally is in.\n\nThe campaigns run by Netanyahu, 69, and Gantz, 60, pointed to only narrow differences on many important issues, and an end to the Netanyahu era would be unlikely to bring about significant changes in policy on relations with the United States, the regional struggle against Iran or the Palestinian conflict.\n\nWith Israeli media reporting more than 95 percent of votes counted in Tuesday\u2019s election, a Likud-led right-wing, religious bloc looked poised to control 55 of parliament\u2019s 120 seats, with 56 going to a centre-left alliance.\n\nOn Wednesday, Gantz said he hoped for a \u201cgood, desirable unity government\u201d. But he has also ruled out forming one with a Netanyahu-led Likud, citing looming corruption charges against the prime minister. Netanyahu denies any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cMR CLEAN\u201d\n\nGantz is a newcomer to politics. Many voters saw him as a \u201cMr Clean\u201d, an alternative to Netanyahu and the cloud of alleged criminal misdeeds hanging over him.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s call for a broad government preceded a scheduled visit later on Thursday by Jason Greenblatt, an architect of U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s as-yet unveiled plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace.\n\nIsraeli cabinet minister Tzachi Hanegbi, a senior Likud member, said he believed Greenblatt was coming to discuss the peace blueprint.\n\nPalestinians, who seek a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as its capital, have rejected the Trump plan out of hand, accusing the president of pro-Israeli bias.\n\n\u201cAs to whether he (Greenblatt) will be presenting the plan, I have no idea,\u201d Hanegbi said on Army Radio.\n\nWith Israeli politics in flux, Netanyahu cancelled his annual speech at the U.N. General Assembly next week, a spokesman said on Wednesday about a visit that might have provided an opportunity to meet with Trump.\n\nNetanyahu highlighted his close ties with Trump in his election campaign. But in Los Angeles on Wednesday, Trump appeared to distance himself from Netanyahu, amid political stalemate in Israel.\n\nHe told reporters he had not spoken to Netanyahu since Tuesday\u2019s ballot and said: \u201cOur relationship is with Israel\u201d.", "description": "Israel's weakened Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu invited his main rival, Benny Gantz, on Thursday to join him in a broad coalition government -- an abrupt change of strategy after failing to win a ruling majority in election.", "authors": ["Jeffrey Heller", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431548098&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I0H4", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
