We crave it, we desire it. As St. Augustine would describe, our hearts are restless for it.\n\nWe recognize persons who have touched such a loving union as a \u201cmystic,\u201d and many of them have a gift to be able to witness to us the transcendent beauty and wisdom that flows from such an encounter.\n\nAngelus contributing editor Kathryn Jean Lopez\u2019 \u201cA Year with the Mystics: Visionary Wisdom for Daily Living\u201d (Saint Benedict Press, $28.99), offers a much-needed road map drawn up by ordinary Christians to assist us on our spiritual journey. Here, Lopez talks about her new book with Kris McGregor.\n\nKris McGregor: \u201cA Year with the Mystics\u201d is the work that I\u2019ve been waiting for, for a long time.\n\nKathryn Jean Lopez: And I\u2019ve been waiting for it for a long time, too. It took me forever to write it while I was doing my other work. When I suggested that Saint Benedict Press publish it, I wasn\u2019t volunteering myself.\n\nAt the time, I was reading a lot of mystics. I was always ripping a quote from Magnificat to save for later. In my huge purse I was lugging around books from the Classics of Western Spirituality Series by Paulist Press. Now I have one convenient volume with all of my favorite saints and other holy people, and I can give my back a rest.\n\nMcGregor: All the mystics in your book communicate God\u2019s love, don\u2019t they?\n\nLopez: Yes. And the reason I included Father Donald Haggerty and another person alive today is because I want people to know that this love is not something in the past. We are still called, each one of us, to union with God.\n\nBut we need to pray more. So much is going on in the Church and in the world. Every time there\u2019s a mass shooting or a tragedy, everyone does the \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d thing. And now there\u2019s pushback. People are saying that God\u2019s not listening or that prayers aren\u2019t working.\n\nI think this calls for an examination of conscience. We should be asking ourselves, \u201cWhat more could I be doing to live in an intimate relationship with God?\u201d\n\nMcGregor: Wouldn\u2019t you say that because we\u2019re not praying, we\u2019re in this period of chaos? And all the saints you have in this book lived through a period of chaos, didn\u2019t they?\n\nLopez: Yes. And what you see in so many of the people I selected, if not all of them, is that the passion of Christ became real to them because they saw that was what they were living, and that was what was making them more like Christ.\n\nI do hope the book demystifies mysticism a little bit. When people hear the word \u201cmysticism\u201d they think of stigmata and all these strange things. But in reality, these writings are about getting to know God from people who really spent time with him, who really, truly prayed.\n\nMcGregor: You\u2019re talking about demystifying mysticism, but we all, when we said yes to God like Our Lady, walked through the door into mystery, \u201cmysterium\u201d in Greek. The Latin term for it is sacrament, essentially. So as you say, we all are called to union with God.\n\nIt drives me nuts when people make it sound as though the mystics are on some mountaintop. Take Caryll Houselander. She suffered from depression and had all kinds of struggles. She lived through both world wars. She was trying to figure out what was going on, and so she tapped into the mystery that had been given to her because of her yes. Is that what you found when you were reading the mystics?\n\nLopez: Yes, absolutely. These were people who knew the realities of life, like Caryll Houselander. This book gives a little taste of her love for God and his love for her. And once you start having that experience of God\u2019s love, you see that it isn\u2019t a nice thought; it\u2019s real, and it really transforms your life.\n\nMcGregor: The mystics are very practical people. What do you see them doing, when you really look at their lives? They\u2019re feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, helping the poor. Even in the cloister or the monastery they are taking care of others. They\u2019re always responding because they\u2019re always seeing a need.\n\nLopez: That\u2019s why I thought it was important to include people who, like Mother Teresa, were very practical in the world. But everything that she did, she did because she loved Jesus, you know?\n\nThat was who she went back to, and stayed with, and had just the deepest relationship you could ever imagine, right? But you don\u2019t have to imagine it. You\u2019re being invited to go deeper into it.\n\nI\u2019m forever seeing people on the street \u2014 some who are asking for money or food, some who are just passed out \u2014 and God is constantly inviting me to show them his love. Showing God\u2019s love is not just about throwing a dollar at a person. It\u2019s about looking him in the eye, shaking his hand, or asking his name.\n\nIt\u2019s hard, but I think it\u2019s part of our ongoing conversion. Obviously, we have to be safe and prudent, but the more I pray and ask the Holy Spirit\u2019s guidance, the more I experience what Mother Teresa and so many other saints have said about seeing God in the poor.\n\nMcGregor: Even in the Catholic Church right now, many are homeless. You mention this in the introduction of your book, where you quote Pope Benedict XVI asking Catholics, \u201cDo you even know Jesus Christ?\u201d\n\nJesus is the person who, when you meet him, brings you home. He\u2019s the person who tells us, \u201cYou are not alone.\u201d People are isolated. Whether they\u2019re on the street or in a Wall Street banking office, people are crying out for a home, aren\u2019t they?\n\nLopez: Yes, frequently the person in need of God\u2019s love is the person next to you or even the person you\u2019re married to. Pope Benedict said that after a meeting on the Americas that I attended.\n\nI was shocked by his question because I didn\u2019t expect to be rebuked by the pope. At the time, a lot of people were talking about New Evangelization projects, and so was I. And the pope said that all that stuff is worthless if you\u2019re not praying constantly and having that encounter with Christ.\n\nChrist is real, yet there is a real danger, especially if you work in the Church, or do something Catholic, to become someone who talks about the Church and the faith without really keeping your eyes on the cross. That was striking to me, when I really started to read the mystics in a more serious way, how many of them literally gaze on the cross.\n\nI try to make sure I always have a cross somewhere near me, because it keeps me focused. You don\u2019t need to physically have a cross. You can meditate on the cross in your mind, but it doesn\u2019t hurt.\n\nMcGregor: No, that is the thing we need. We have senses and one of them is touch. Sometimes we have to grasp something, we have to hold on to something. That\u2019s partly why your book is so nice, because it\u2019s such a beautiful book to hold. It\u2019s a leather-bound journal, but not of empty pages. It\u2019s a journal of the heart, isn\u2019t it?\n\nLopez: Oh, absolutely. Sometimes we think of saints as legends, as too good to be true. But when you actually read them, you discover that they\u2019re journaling their heart, the fruit of their prayers, and you realize, \u201cOh, they\u2019re not that different from me. I can do this, too.\u201d", "description": "A conversation on what it takes to demystify one of the most fascinating areas of the Catholic experience: mysticism.", "authors": ["Kris Mcgregor", "Evan Holguin", "Angelus Staff", "Robert Brennan"], "top_image": "https://angelusnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/mcgregor1-e1571330952158-1024x576.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
