But one pregnancy center leader recently received praise \u2013 at the White House.\n\nOn September 27, President Trump made remarks celebrating a pregnancy center founder during a Hispanic Heritage Month reception held at the White House. His comments went largely unnoticed by the media, many of whom condemn pregnancy centers \u2013 places pregnant women and new moms can turn to for free help \u2013 as \u201cfake.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, the reception aimed to recognize the \u201cexceptional achievements of our incredible Hispanic American community,\u201d President Trump said. That included the work of Martha Avila, president and co-founder of Heartbeat of Miami Pregnancy Health Medical Clinics.\n\nPresident Trump commended Avila for \u201cdoing an incredible job\u201d by helping \u201cthousands of mothers choose life.\u201d\n\nAccording to Heartbeat of Miami\u2019s website, the nonprofit has saved more than 40,000 babies while pursuing its mission to \u201chelp to women and couples with an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy through the gospel of life and the message of hope.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump invited Avila to use her own words to describe her work.\n\n\u201cLet us know about the great job you\u2019ve done,\u201d President Trump said. \u201cI already know, but they don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nA Cuban American, Avila began by stressing that while \u201cHispanics and African Americans are the minority,\u201d they \u201cform the majority of abortions in our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne out of two pregnancies of African Americans ends up in abortion, and one out of three Hispanic pregnancies ends up in abortion,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that saddens me.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s right about a discrepancy. For the year 2014, a report by the Guttmacher Institute, a research group once affiliated with Planned Parenthood, calculated an abortion index, or \u201cthe proportion of abortion patients in a given subgroup (e.g., a particular age-group) relative to the proportion of all U.S. women aged 15\u201344 who are in that same subgroup.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf these proportions are the same\u2014indicated by an index of 1.0\u2014the subgroup\u2019s relative abortion rate is the same as the overall national rate,\u201d it reported.\n\nIt found that while \u201cWhite women were slightly underrepresented among abortion patients in 2014, having an abortion index of 0.7\u201d \u201cblack women were substantially overrepresented, with a relative abortion rate of 1.9.\u201d Hispanic women were also overrepresented (1.2).\n\nThe most recently released Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Abortion Surveillance report for 2015 confirmed similar findings, even though, unlike the Guttmacher Institute, it misses data from certain states.\n\n\u201cNon-Hispanic white women had the lowest abortion rate (6.8 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15\u201344 years) and ratio (111 abortions per 1,000 live births),\u201d it read, while \u201cnon-Hispanic black women had the highest abortion rate (25.1 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15\u201344 years) and ratio (390 abortions per 1,000 live births).\u201d\n\nAvila continued her speech after thanking President Trump.\n\n\u201cWe \u2014 over 3,000 pregnancy clinics throughout the nation, with very limited resources \u2014 are doing this labor of love for those that don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d she urged. \u201cThey\u2019re confused. They don\u2019t have a way out, and they think that abortion is the only solution.\u201d\n\nPregnancy centers, she said, allow them \u201cthe opportunity to parent their babies, and the opportunity of a plan of adoption.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is what we do,\u201d she urged. \u201cSo pregnancy clinics are good for America. And one day, abortion will be unthinkable \u2014 unthinkable in our country.\u201d\n\nAmong other things, pregnancy centers provide pregnant women and new moms with free housing, medical supplies, clothing, and educational classes. Heartbeat of Miami is no exception. According to its website, its services include, \u201cinclude pregnancy tests, sonograms, peer counseling, parenting education, adoption referrals, and opportunities to learn about healthy sexual values and personal growth.\u201d\n\nThose services make a difference. The website shares stories and pictures of babies saved through Heartbeat of Miami\u2019s work. There\u2019s Baby Abigail, who survived an attempted abortion after her 19-year-old mother found out she was pregnant. Baby Genesis\u2019 mom had a change of heart after seeing her ultrasound. There\u2019s also Baby Daniella, who was prenatally diagnosed with Down syndrome. Her mom chose life \u2013 and after giving birth discovered that her baby didn\u2019t have Down syndrome after all.\n\nAbortion supporters and the media might call them \u201cfake,\u201d but pregnancy centers do real work \u2013 from offering women choices to saving human lives.", "description": "Pregnancy centers are routinely mocked and attacked while providing aid .09/30/2019 20:09:50PM EST.", "authors": ["Katie Yoder", "Beth Baumann", "Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/269/41724fc8-1a25-4051-aed9-4d70fd822625.png", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
