Even the poorest of the poor on this planet deserve to have their dignity protected.\n\nJust because you wanted your act of empathy to be seen by the world for whatever the reason, it need not be done at the cost of someone\u2019s dignity.\n\nSo, on the New Year Day, if nothing else, let us gift dignity to the poor of India with all the sweets and kindness that we should be gifting to them.\n\nWhile social media is covered with faces of street kids, let us, as a society, recognise the horror that India has 2.5 crore stray dogs and just as many street kids, and a lot of these kids are orphans with no real home but the street.\n\nThe real irony of our nation is that we have social media pages full of pleas to give a \u201cpoor darling puppy a home\u201d almost every day and a lot of street dogs finding a home, out of the 2.5 crore orphan humans of India, less than 8000 find a home each year.\n\nAs a human society we have failed our street kids completely, so let us not make it worse by using their innocent faces to build a fake identity of us being a society that really cares.", "description": "Cometh Diwali and the social media bots collecting information about human faces must be getting ecstatic because they would be experiencing a sudden increase in new faces popping up on social media platforms.
