Ron Wyden (D-OR) questions a witness during hearing on March 28, 2019 in Washington, DC. (Photo: Zach Gibson / Getty)\n\nThe U.S. Senate\u2019s top privacy hawk is once again calling on Facebook to voluntarily suspend the use of micro-targeting to push political and issue-based advertisements, warning that foreign governments could take advantage of the tool to influence American elections.\n\nU.S. Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, previously called on Facebook and Google to suspend micro-targeting for political ads in August, saying such tools may be used to dissuade minority groups from voting, CNN reported. Wyden renewed his call in remarks attached to a bipartisan report, released Wednesday by the Senate Intelligence Committee, related to the electoral interference by Russian operatives in 2016. Wyden warned that Facebook\u2019s ad-targeting tools allow for custom-tailored manipulation of U.S. voters.\n\nThe 84-page report speaks to the scope and scale of the Russian campaign to spread disinformation and sow division among American voters carried out by the St. Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency (IRA). \u201cMasquerading as Americans, these operatives used targeted advertisements, intentionally falsified news articles, self-generated content, and social media platform tools to interact with and attempt to deceive tens of millions of social media users in the United States,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe IRA targeted swing states with \u201csocially incendiary and divisive subjects,\u201d it says, noting that a certain Facebook ad micro-targeting tool \u2014 had it actually been employed by the IRA \u2014 would have allowed the operatives to target specific American voters with even greater efficiency.\n\nAccording to Facebook\u2019s own estimates, 11.4 million people in the United States saw at least one of the ads placed by the IRA. Facebook pages run by the IRA are also said to have generated some 76.5 million user interactions, including 30.4 million shares and 37.6 million likes. Around 126 million Americans are estimated to have come in contact with IRA-generated content, which was also unwittingly shared by a number of high-profile figures, such as Fox News host Sean Hannity and former U.S. ambassador Michael McFaul.\n\n\u201cBy flooding social media with false reports, conspiracy theories, and trolls, and by exploiting existing divisions, Russia is trying to breed distrust of our democratic institutions and our fellow Americans,\u201d Sen. Richard Burr, the committee\u2019s chairman, said in a statement. \u201cWhile Russia may have been the first to hone the modern disinformation tactics outlined in this report, other adversaries, including China, North Korea, and Iran, are following suit.\u201d\n\nIn a section of the report authored by Wyden, the senator paints targeted ads as a far more sophisticated threat than the blanket propaganda largely relied upon by the IRA in 2016. Foreign actors could potentially \u201cweaponise\u201d hacked databases comprised of Americans\u2019 personal information, he says, and use that information to target voters with tailored content, \u201cnot just to manipulate how, or whether they vote, but to identify and use real individuals to amplify content and influence like-minded followers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the Committee\u201ds description of Russia\u2019s 2016 influence campaign is deeply troubling, even more sophisticated and effective options are available to adversaries who buy, steal, or otherwise obtain information about the Americans they are seeking to influence,\u201d Wyden wrote. \u201cThis threat is increased due to the available of ad micro-targeting services offered by social media and online advertising companies, particularly those that deliver ads to specific Americans based on a list of email addresses or telephone numbers provided by an advertiser.\u201d\n\nWyden specifically refers to Facebook\u2019s \u201ccustom audience\u201d tool, which allows advertisers to upload their own lists of emails, phone numbers or Facebook User IDs to target its users with ads. Facebook stated last year that it does not keep track of the custom data used to direct the ads and that it deletes it \u201cas soon as we complete the match.\u201d\n\nFacebook told a separate Senate committee that Cambridge Analytica \u2014 the data-mining firm that worked for the Trump campaign and illegally accessed data of millions of Facebook users \u2014 utilised its \u201ccustom audiences\u201d tool by generating \u201ccontact lists and other identifiers\u201d that were uploaded to Facebook.\n\n\u201cIn the wake of the 2016 influence campaign by Russia, the social media companies announced transparency measures that allow the recipients of target ads to understand how they were selected to see the ads,\u201d Wyden continued. \u201cHowever, these transparency measures only apply when the tech companies are doing the targeting on behalf of the advertiser, for example when an advertiser asks Facebook to deliver its ads to a particular age and gender demographic.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe companies\u2019 ad transparency systems do not apply to services like Custom Audiences through which the platform merely serves as a messenger for ads directed according to a list of targets obtained by the malign influence from a data broker or a hacked database,\u201d he adds.\n\nFacebook did not respond to Gizmodo\u2019s request for comment. The company has previously said that while Russian operatives did use its \u201ccustom audiences\u201d tool, they did not upload their own identifiers and relied instead on Facebook\u2019s own ad-targeting system. The report states that uploading outside data would have \u201cpermitted more advanced micro-targeting of their advertisements.\u201d\n\nIn August, Wyden asked both Facebook and Google to suspend the use of micro-targeting, saying it posed a unique threat to American voters and that he\u2019d \u201crather have them do it voluntarily than requiring a law.\u201d\n\nFacebook has come under fire in recent weeks over its decision not to fact check or remove content posted by politicians, even if the posts contain flagrantly false information or violate the company\u2019s rules.\n\n\u201cWe have a responsibility to protect the platform from outside interference, and to make sure that when people pay us for political ads we make it as transparent as possible,\u201d Nick Clegg, Facebook\u2019s vice president of global affairs and communications, wrote in September, adding: \u201cBut it is not our role to intervene when politicians speak.\u201d\n\nIn a series of tweets Tuesday, presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren demanded to know if Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg altered its policies on political ads in response to pressure from the White House.\n\n\u201cFacebook has incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. Mark Zuckerberg is telling employees that he views a Warren administration as an \u2018existential\u2019 threat to Facebook,\u201d the Democrat of Massachusetts tweeted, referencing comments made by Zuckerberg during an internal meeting, audio of which recently leaked. \u201cThe public deserves to know how Facebook intends to use their influence in this election.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor instance, Trump and Zuckerberg met at the White House two weeks ago. What did they talk about?\u201d she added.", "description": "The U.S. Senate\u2019s top privacy hawk is once again calling on Facebook to voluntarily suspend the use of micro-targeting to push political and issue-based advertisements, warning that foreign governments could take advantage of the tool to influence American elections....", "authors": ["Alex Cranz", "Tegan Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/fzobvuppwo8svhn5s2kl.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
