Since he can no longer pay the loan with proceeds from selling WeWork shares publicly (it yanked its S-1 filing earlier this week), he may have to put up some of his properties or other assets as collateral for the loan, according to one of BI\u2019s sources.\n\n\u201cNo terms have been set,\u201d a spokeswoman for Neumann tells the outlet.\n\nPer earlier reports, Neumann has plenty to offload if it comes to it, having acquired numerous residential and commercial properties over the years.\n\nAmong his reported investments is a $10.5 million Greenwich Village townhouse; a farm in Westchester, New York; a home in the Hamptons where he reportedly weathered the storm with his family ahead of resigning as CEO last week; and a $21 million, 13,000-square-foot house in the Bay Area with a guitar-shaped room.\n\nAccording to an earlier WSJ report, Neumann has also bought several commercial properties through investor groups that he had leased back, in some cases, to WeWork.\n\nWeWork, and Neumann, have both enjoyed a close relationship with JPMorgan in recent years. As recently reported in the NYTimes, JPMorgan \u201clent Mr. Neumann money personally (with his inflated shares as collateral), provided equity and debt for the company, served as a corporate adviser for the I.P.O. and secured nearly $6 billion in financing as part of the now scotched offering.\u201d", "description": "Adam Neumann may be out of the daily flow of WeWork, but he seemingly remains top of mind to some of the company\u2019s bankers.
