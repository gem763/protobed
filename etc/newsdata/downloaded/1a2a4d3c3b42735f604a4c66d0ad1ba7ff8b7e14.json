He hopes it didn\u2019t also end his tenure with the Cleveland Indians.\n\nKipnis has spent his entire professional career with the organization since being drafted in 2009, but the Indians are unlikely to pick up his $16.5 million option for next year, which would make him a free agent for the first time at age 32.\n\n\u201cGoing into the unknown can be a little frightening at first, but most players go through it eventually,\u201d Kipnis said Wednesday at Progressive Field. \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky enough to play this long for the same organization - and even luckier that it\u2019s been Cleveland.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a thrill to be here. I\u2019ve loved this city from Day One. It will be missed. It will be hard to part ways. There will always be part of me here. But the unknown can also be exciting, too.\u201d\n\nThe two-time All-Star second baseman spoke with the media three days after fracturing his right hamate bone while batting against Minnesota. He doubled in his final at-bat, completing his year with a .245 average, 17 homers and 65 RBIs in 121 games.\n\nKipnis will remain with the Indians for the remainder of their series against Detroit before undergoing surgery next week in New York with Dr. Thomas Graham, who performed a similar operation on Cleveland third baseman Jose Ramirez on Aug. 26.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the ride off into the sunset you hope for when you\u2019ve been with a team for a long time, but right now, it\u2019s all I can do,\u201d said Kipnis, who has a .261 career average, 123 homers, 529 RBIs, 135 stolen bases in 1,121 games over nine seasons.\n\n\u201cBut from where we started, I\u2019m proud of the way that I didn\u2019t pack it in or give up. I refused to be a non-factor because I knew it was my last year and I knew this team needed me to step up.\u201d\n\nKipnis has played a key role on all four of Cleveland\u2019s playoff teams over the past decade, appearing in 24 games, including all seven during its 2016 World Series loss to the Chicago Cubs.\n\nThe Indians are competing with Oakland and Tampa Bay for the two AL wild-card spots, but would need to advance to at least the AL Championship Series for Kipnis to have a chance on returning this postseason.\n\n\u201cOne of the most unfortunate parts of this is I don\u2019t get to finish what I started eight years ago here, the mission,\u201d said Kipnis, a Chicago native who made his MLB debut on July 22, 2011, at the White Sox. \u201cI think we turned around a franchise and turned around an organization. We raised the bar here. Part of me likes to think I played a part in that.\u201d\n\nThere is a chance Kipnis could play a part in Cleveland\u2019s future, as well. There isn\u2019t an obvious heir apparent in its farm system and he remains a favorite of longtime Indians manager Terry Francona.\n\nIf team president Chris Antonetti is interested in bringing him back at a lower salary, Kipnis would eagerly answer the phone. His 1,050 regular season games at second base rank third in franchise history.\n\n\u201cNo talks have been had, but if Cleveland thinks that\u2019s something that we can agree on a number, I don\u2019t think it would be too hard to get something done,\u201d Kipnis said. \u201cI think I have plenty of good years of good baseball left in me and I can move around positions. In my case, I don\u2019t think the price is going to be too hard to negotiate.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A broken right wrist ended Jason Kipnis' regular season.
