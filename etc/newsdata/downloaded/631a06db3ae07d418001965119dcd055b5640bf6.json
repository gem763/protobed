She also shared how the professional skateboarder helped her during her own struggle with sobriety nearly 12 years ago.\n\nOn Monday, the 37-year-old tattoo artist shared on Instagram that becoming sober was \"not easy.\"\n\n\"Even though it\u2019s gonna be 12 years in July that I celebrate being clean from drinking and drugs, I still clearly remember the physical pain from withdrawals, the profound desire to die, and the overwhelming sense of loneliness I felt that day I decided to quit,\" she wrote. \"You quickly realize who your real friends are when you make such big changes. And to be honest, I was left with almost no one.\"\n\nVon D candidly shared that on the second day of her detoxing she was experiencing suicidal thoughts when Margera visited and \"found the most pathetic/vulnerable version of me on my apartment floor.\" He suggested that the two draw \u2014 a hobby that Von D credits with saving her life in the past.\n\n\"Looking back, I realize he was just helping me put one foot in front of the other,\" Von D wrote. \"Maybe it was just a distraction, or maybe it was his way of helping me refocus on the one thing that has always saved me from myself.\"\n\nOn Sunday, the artist revealed that she visited Margera during his current attempt at rehabilitation. In August, Margera was arrested for trespassing after refusing to leave the Luxe Hotel in Los Angeles. According to TMZ, the former MTV star pled no contest to the one-count of trespassing and entered a plea deal in which he must successfully complete 90 days in a substance abuse program and avoid contact with the hotel during his three-year-long probation period in order to avoid jail time.\n\nIn January, Margera left treatment just 10 days after entering. It was his third time attending rehab for alcohol addiction, according to CNN. The former \u201cJackass\u201d star has addressed his attempts at sobriety publicly, both on social media and in interviews.\n\nVon D has also often talked openly about her struggle with substance abuse in the past.\n\nIn 2016, speaking with LA's KROQ-FM, Von D said, \u201cI am a believer that we\u2019re all human and we\u2019re all capable of making mistakes... I think if I were to be crucified for my drug addiction three years ago now, it would be hard to live with that. I\u2019m sober now, and it\u2019s awesome. But I have made mistakes, too.\"\n\nOn Instagram, Von D wrote: \"I\u2019m so proud to see Bam sincerely trying to make such meaningful changes \u2014 as hard as it is being away from family and home. Thank you, Bam for always being there for me. I\u2019m so [f******] proud of you, and can\u2019t wait to see all the amazing things you\u2019re gonna do.\"\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Kat Von D took to Instagram to show support for her friend, Bam Margera, while he attends a 90-day substance abuse program.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QS6fz6vPjdnXy47WmnRBJA--~B/aD0yMjE1O3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/9d5920b0-e945-11e9-bfee-91c5b1a06d93", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
