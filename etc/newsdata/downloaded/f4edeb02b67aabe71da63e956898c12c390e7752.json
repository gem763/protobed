(NOV) rose 12.4% Tuesday after the company on Monday posted its third-quarter results.\n\nFor the quarter ended Sept. 30, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortization were $262 million, up from $245 million in the prior year. Analysts polled by FactSet were looking for $213 million.\n\n\"In the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA improved significantly relative to second quarter results due to accelerating cost reductions, a favorable revenue shift towards higher-margin offshore and aftermarket businesses, and positive project close-out variances,\" Chief Executive Clay Williams said in prepared remarks Monday.\n\nHowever, the oil-field service company reported a loss of $244 million, or 64 cents a share, compared with a profit of $1 million, or breakeven on a per-share basis, in the same quarter last year. Analysts were looking for a profit of 12 cents a share.\n\nRevenue ticked down to $2.13 billion from $2.15 billion in the previous year. Analysts were expecting $2.17 billion.\n\nWrite to Dave Sebastian at dave.sebastian@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 29, 2019 10:08 ET (14:08 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
