Reflecting on his career as a polemicist, Hitchens also once said: \u201cThe cause of self-determination for Kurdistan was high on the list of principles and priorities.\u201d\n\nHitchens died eight years ago this December, but that hasn\u2019t stopped people from wondering what he would thought about Trump. Surely, the thinking goes, the verbose and urbane Hitchens would have rejected vulgarian populism. Surely, the thinking also goes, the professional contrarian couldn\u2019t have resisted the great political arsonist of our young century.\n\nHere\u2019s something for sure: Hitchens would have fumed at the latest moves out of the White House, a slapdash but justified retreat in Syria that saw Kurdish partners of Washington pelting U.S. convoys with rotten vegetables. It\u2019s striking that perhaps no move made by President Trump in his three years in office has engendered more opprobrium in official Washington, with a supermajority rebuke in the House last week the latest evidence of how steep a climb it will be for the president to do something, anything, to recalibrate America in the Middle East.\n\nThe neoconservatives and their allies are now smelling blood. The Trump-era trajectory of the ideologues who ruled under George W. Bush is complicated. Some neocons, such as writers Max Boot, Jennifer Rubin, David Frum and William Kristol, have flown the coop, effectively or explicitly abandoning the Republican Party. Other neocons have thrived, serving in the Trump administration while the 45th president pursues the hawkish line on Iran that the 43th president actually flinched from. If populist-nationalism could be discredited in the process, that is is just the cherry on top.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn Nikki Haley, the former U.N. ambassador, Trump inadvertently credentialed a major, conservative successor who would be broadly hostile his legacy. And by feuding so openly with Senator Mitt Romney, Trump has in some ways done what he says Barack Obama did for Joe Biden, now a leading Democratic candidate for president\u2014that is, rescuing Mitt from the political \u201dtrash heap\u201d Neocons and their fellow travelers who have grown more weary of POTUS in recent weeks, such as the influential Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, would doubtless welcome a primary challenge by the 2012 Republican nominee against the 2016 standard-bearer.\n\nAt the very least, the thinking goes, a serious, finger-wagging challenge from the establishment Right would snap Trump back to the model of 2017 and 2018: more airstrikes against Bashar Assad\u2019s Syria, less Iran \u201ccan do what they want\u2026 frankly\u201d in Syria. More presidential stiff arms, rhetorical, financial and otherwise, toward a regime in Tehran that has overseen a \u201clong reign of chaos and terror,\u201d as Trump emphasized in spring 2018, but less campaign-style lamentations about \u201cendless wars\u201d from the arriviste in the Oval. As neocon-friendly journalist Eli Lake argued earlier this month, Trump with his sea legs is poised to preside over an \u201cAmerican unexceptionalism\u201d and \u201cchose\u201d chaos and collapse.\n\nBut a more tender open wound has been supplied: impeachment. It\u2019s rarely stated so openly, but for the president\u2019s leading Democratic and neocon critics, Trump\u2019s dealings with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are a feature, not a bug. The incident that has landed him the hottest waters yet, his bullying of the Ukranian president, ex-comedian Volodymyr Zelensky, is merely part and parcel of a broader tendency. His critics wail that Trump is a would-be strongman who prefers to deal with strongmen and treat small-d democrats as chumps. Abandoning the Kurds because of a clubby relationship with Erdogan, in whose country he may build Trump Towers after he leaves office, is just the coup de grace.\n\nPerhaps the most serious obstacle for Trump\u2019s Syria course is that it appears to have seriously ruptured the conservative consensus of Trump\u2019s first years in Washington, an understanding that make the great hijacker of the Republican Party at least tolerable to his fellow partisans. In particular, Trump\u2019s foreign policy has been called \u201cJacksonian,\u201d in opposition to the crusading democracy promotion of the neocons, yes, but still open to bellicose action overseas.\n\n\u201cJacksonianism\u201d is a perspective most commonly associated with former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, the uberhawk former national security advisor John Bolton and the leading foreign policy columnist of the Trump era, The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Walter Russel Mead. Mead backed the Syria withdrawal, writing: \u201cThe U.S. may be the most powerful actor in the region, but it can\u2019t resolve the economic and social conflicts that destabilize the Middle East.\u201d But outside Mead, the bench is thin for the chastened neocons that once served as Trump\u2019s rump. Senator Ted Cruz, a johnny-come-lately \u201crealist,\u201d joined a senatorial pile-on with Romney, Trump\u2019s intermitted ally Senator Lindsey Graham, and the so-called \u201cheir to Trumpism,\u201d Senator Tom Cotton.\n\nTrump\u2019s future\u2014and fate\u2014may lie, instead, with the \u201cJeffersonians\u201d Mead once insisted, with dubious elaboration, that Trump was not. In Meadian terminology, disciples of the third president are those who realists \u201cmore inward-looking, less globally engaged U.S.\u201d That churlish characterization aside, Mead wrote last fall that Trump had broadly disappointed this contingent. If he had, he is no longer. In the president\u2019s ear: Senator Rand Paul, Congressman Matt Gaetz, the Fox host Tucker Carlson, and the billionaire kingmaker Peter Thiel, all of whom favor a less counterproductive footprint abroad.\n\nBut if Trump is going to succeed in turning the page on a tragic era in American foreign policy, as he appears newly interested in doing late into his third year of office, he\u2019ll have to do more than lament this situation. Trump has already seized the commanding heights; he is the president of the United States. If he wants to end the era of endless wars, he\u2019ll have to also take the countryside\u2014that is, the bureaucracy and his own staff. Less complaints about the \u201cdeep state,\u201d more remaking the state, lest politics be recaptured by the neocons.\n\nCurt Mills is senior writer for The American Conservative.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/shutterstock_1190031703.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
