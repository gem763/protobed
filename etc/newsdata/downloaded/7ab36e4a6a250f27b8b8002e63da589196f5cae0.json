Reports say Ford will divulge new details in November, likely at the Los Angeles Auto Show. But, we probably won\u2019t see the final product until 2020 before the SUV goes on sale for the 2021 model year. To hold us over until then, new spy photos show glimpses of the Ford EV\u2019s near-production bodywork hiding under camo.\n\nAll You Need To Know: Ford's Electric Mustang SUV: Everything We Know\n\nYou might not be able to tell given the extensive camouflage, but this is our first look at Ford\u2019s Mustang-inspired electric SUV in its near-final form on road. Our spy photographers captured it testing near the Blue Oval\u2019s headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan. At first glance, there\u2019s not much to look at outside of the obvious cladding \u2013 but dig a little deeper and there are some interesting details to point out.\n\nGallery: Ford Mach E Spy Photos\n\n11 Photos\n\nFirst off, ignore the Ford Flex-shaped greenhouse in the rear. The black camouflage is clearly a facade designed to hide a much sleeker, coupe-like shape. Ignore the bland five-spoke wheels and taillights, too. Neither of those features is likely to reach production. But, there are some things to note on the front end.\n\nIt appears all that camo on the prototype\u2019s front fascia hides near-production cues like to the ones teased previously. The LED headlights and bulging \"grille\" piece show up most prominently behind the covering. Though, based solely on these photos, we can\u2019t find any \"Mustang-inspired\" cues to note. Maybe more spy photos will reveal the final shape closer to a debut.\n\nWhen it debuts in full, sometime in 2020, expect Ford\u2019s Mustang-inspired electric SUV (likely dubbed the Mach E) to feature a 300-mile (482-kilometer) driving range. Things like price and trim levels are still unknown, but the Blue Oval\u2019s EV will compete directly with the Tesla Model Y, which itself goes on sale next year and starts at less than $40,000. We should know more about the Ford closer to the crossover\u2019s preview in just a few months.", "description": "Ahead of Ford\u2019s preview of its Mustang-inspired electric SUV in November, spy photographers captured the crossover wearing near-production sheet metal.", "authors": ["Jeff Perez"], "top_image": "https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/kJYvP/s3/ford-mach-e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-21"}
