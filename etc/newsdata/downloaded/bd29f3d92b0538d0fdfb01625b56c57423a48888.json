He said he was in there for about 20 seconds.\n\n'He saw what looked like a tyre at the bottom so he put his foot on that to push him up a bit.\n\nLuckily his two friends and a passer by pulled him out, my son can't swim.' The mother-of-two, who lives in Darlaston, said when her son was 'soaked' when he arrived home.\n\nShe continued: 'I thought he was joking when he first told me. It gave him such a shock, it has left us all feeling shocked about what happened.\n\n'This could happen to anyone, something needs to be done \u2013 or are they waiting for someone to fall in and die. I just thank God he came out with the help of friends and a passer by. It's horrible thinking about what could have happened.'\n\nThe teen's fall would have happened a matter of minutes before Steve Worthington and his 11-year-old son, Lewis, stepped straight into the water \u2013 also believing the weeds were grass .\n\nThe 41-year-old had to battle to keep his lad's head above the water as they desperately tried to clamber to safety. 'We just stepped straight in and went straight under the water,' he said.\n\n'We have never been down there and we couldn't see any warning signs in place. The whole area is thick green weeds \u2013 it looks just like grass.\n\nA 19-year-old man plunged into the icy Walsall Canal on October 5 after enjoying a meal at Nando's nearby and mistaking overgrown algae for a path\n\nA spokesman for the Canal & River Trust, which oversees the waterway near to the site, said: 'We are aware that there is a problem with an overgrowth of weed in the basin, which can make it seem as though the area is covered in thick grass, hiding the water underneath.\n\n'Safety signs have been installed at the basin warning people of the danger.\n\n'Removing the weed is an ongoing battle and there will be a team from Canal & River Trust out in the basin to clear sections of the weed in the next few days.'", "description": "A 19-year-old man and a father and his son plunged into the icy Walsall Canal on October 5 after mistaking overgrown algae for a path.", "authors": ["Lara Keay For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/14/13/19691868-0-image-a-6_1571056039278.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
