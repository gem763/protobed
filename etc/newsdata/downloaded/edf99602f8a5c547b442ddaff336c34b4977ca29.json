The company blamed its latest misfire on churn, or the rate of cancellations, which rose slightly after Netflix hiked prices in the US earlier this year.\n\nThe streaming giant squeezed in one last big price hike in 2019 before forthcoming streaming services like Disney Plus, Apple TV Plus, HBO Max, Peacock, and Quibi try to eat its lunch. It announced rate increases of $1 to $2 in January across its US plans, which were still rolling out to existing subscribers through the second quarter.\n\nNetflix's struggles since, in its largest single market, has Wall Street analysts and investors questioning how much the service can continue growing domestically and what the limits are to its pricing power.\n\nRead more: Netflix could be forced to rethink its pricing strategy as new competitors like Disney Plus and HBO Max launch\n\n\"It basically says they have some limits on their pricing power, at least for now,\" James Wang, an analyst at investment manager ARK Invest, which runs two exchange-traded funds that include Netflix, told Business Insider. \"That's what caught me on the more cautious side,\" he said, adding that the report was quite strong overall.\n\nNetflix's frequent price hikes may evoke the worst of cable TV for some customers\n\nNetflix's pricing power will be tested more during the fourth quarter and into 2020, when its new competitors take hold.\n\nSo far, none are positioning themselves as direct threats. Disney, Apple, and WarnerMedia are all tiptoeing around \"800-pound gorilla in OTT,\" Brett Sappington at the entertainment-research firm Parks Associates said. \"Those other services have content that's unique and are seen as an add-ons,\" he said.\n\nDisney Plus, for example, will be more family oriented. Apple TV Plus is launching with nine original series and no licensed or library content.\n\nNetflix, meanwhile, is still trying to be the home for nearly everything. It wants to make your favorite show, be it a guilty pleasure or prestige drama, and movie, from indies to blockbusters, and have your beloved TV repeats like \"Seinfeld.\" In that sense, Netflix has become the equivalent of broadcast or cable TV to some cord cutters.\n\nIt's also the only major streaming service that is profiting entirely from subscriptions. Amazon, Apple, and the Disney-controlled Hulu can afford to undercut Netflix on price because their streaming services are backed by other profitable businesses, such as Apple's iPhones and Disney's movies and parks.\n\nAs such, Netflix has had to raise prices in the US more regularly than most of its peers \u2014 about every two years or less. Hulu, by contrast, lowered the price of its cheapest plan this year, right after Netflix raised rates. And HBO Now, which charges more than Netflix does for its standard plan, hasn't raised prices since its 2015 launch.\n\nBut people in the US, scared by the constantly rising rates of cable TV, worry about being tied to services with ever-rising rates. Netflix's pricing power may be limited not by its actual prices but the frequency with which it's raising them.\n\n\"I don't think the price itself is the issue,\" Eric Haggstrom, the forecasting analyst at eMarketer, said. \"It's purely psychological. The main reason people cut the cord in the first place is the consistent price increases they're subject to ... Netflix is the one streaming service that has been consistently raising prices so far.\"\n\nThe streaming giant is hoping higher-caliber films and other new content will make its service more valuable\n\nMany industry watchers still agree Netflix is a good value at $13 per month for its standard plan. But the company is also looking at other ways to round out its content lineup and make itself indispensable to streaming users. Netflix has been spending heavily on animated originals, ostensibly to replace some of the movies and shows it is losing as Disney shifts its library to its own streaming service.\n\nNetflix has also been investing in big-budget movies, the kind you'd expect to watch in theaters or ignite Oscar buzz. The company called out during earnings movies such as Martin Scorsese's \"The Irishman\"; \"Marriage Story\" with Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson; and Michael Bay's \"6 Underground\" that will hit the service later this year.\n\n\"What we have to do is just give it a pause and really focus on the value,\" Reed Hastings, the CEO of Netflix, said in the third-quarter earnings interview when asked about pricing and churn. \"If you think about it, we haven't had many big movies in the past, and movies are very valuable. People are used to paying for a lot of that.\"\n\nIntroducing a greater caliber and breadth of movies on top of the indies and so-called TV movies on Netflix now may also help replace some of the content from outside studios that the streaming company can no longer rely on licensing year after year.\n\nBut it's harder to tell how films, a newer endeavor for Netflix, will drive or retain subscribers. Netflix lowered its subscriber forecast for the upcoming fourth quarter, in part because of new releases that are harder to predict the audience for than returning seasons of existing series.\n\nWhether Netflix will be able to match the hit ratio of movie studios that have been releasing films for decades also remains to be seen.\n\n\"If you think about how long Disney has been doing this compared to Netflix as a studio, Netflix is a startup,\" Jeff Galak, an associate professor of marketing at Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business, said. \"They're still figuring out the right formula.\"", "description": "Netflix's recent struggles in the US has Wall Street questioning how much the service can grow domestically, and the limits to its pricing power.", "authors": ["Ashley Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5daa055fcc4a0a34686925f6?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
