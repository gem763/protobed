No, I do research, goddammit,\u201d he tells the crowd. \u201cI asked Wanda Sykes.\u201d\n\nThe bit is meant to be a comment on \u201ccancel culture,\u201d which Cole, who has been performing stand-up for 26 years, says he worries about \u201call the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this new era, man, everyone wants to take you down,\u201d he adds, pointing to Kevin Hart, who stepped down as host of the Oscars after years-old homophobic jokes and tweets came to light. He has somewhat less sympathy for comedian Shane Gillis, who was hired and then quickly fired by Saturday Night Live last month after much more recent racist commentary emerged.\n\n\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then he has to be held accountable for that,\u201d Cole says of Gillis. \u201cHe should know better.\u201d But with Hart, he says, they \u201cwent back eight years for something,\u201d adding, \u201cThat\u2019s sad when they are searching and fishing for something like that.\u201d\n\nWe talk about all of this and a lot more on this week\u2019s episode, including how Cole started doing stand-up on a $50 bet in his hometown of Chicago, how he ended up getting hired as a writer for Conan O\u2019Brien after performing stand-up on The Tonight Show and what it has meant for him to break out as an actor, first on ABC\u2019s Black-ish and now on the spinoff Grown-ish.\n\n\u201cFor us to have that platform, to not only be a black face, but to be a black voice, is very important,\u201d he says.\n\nHighlights from our conversation are below and you can listen to the whole thing right now by subscribing to The Last Laugh on Apple Podcasts, the Himalaya app or wherever you listen to podcasts.\n\nOn moving from Comedy Central to Netflix for his new special\n\n\u201cThe way Comedy Central handled my special, I wasn\u2019t extremely happy with it, but it was the powers that be at the time, so I was like, OK, whatever. I loved the special, the special was great to me, I just didn\u2019t like the way it was promoted. They told me one thing and it was another. It just fell by the wayside. It was exactly what I was scared it was going to be. I was like, if it\u2019s going to be a special, let\u2019s make it special. I don\u2019t want to do it if it\u2019s not special. I had a few billboards and that was cool, but when it aired, it aired that one time and that was it. I mean, it aired a few times after that, but I don\u2019t think it got the love it deserved. So I was bummed about that.\u201d\n\nWhy he can\u2019t stand \u2018cancel culture\u2019\n\n\u201cCancel culture is horrendous. For you to pinpoint something like that, you want to crush me, you want to cancel me, you want to ruin me. And it\u2019s really fucked up that we live in this era where you cannot make mistakes. Because I know that growing up, that\u2019s how I learned. I learned from mistakes. If I ride my bike and I don\u2019t hold the handlebars and I fall, I know to hold them next time. So I should be allowed to make mistakes and learn from them, but this culture nowadays, they\u2019re like, man, if you mess up it\u2019s off with your head. And it\u2019s sad because I don\u2019t trust that you really know what you\u2019re doing, if you\u2019re that perfect and you don\u2019t make no mistakes. You have to allow someone to grow with the times. The way things were then aren\u2019t the way they are now. And the way things are now won\u2019t be the way they are in the future.\u201d\n\nOn performing stand-up on college campuses\n\n\u201cIf I decide to do a college, which is very, very, very rare, I just stay as P.C. as possible. My point of view really isn\u2019t important. Let me just make them laugh the best way I can, but I\u2019m not trying to change the world. I\u2019m not trying to give my point of view on anything at any college at all. I\u2019m in and out. I just don\u2019t know about that generation being able to handle what I have to say. It\u2019s about me protecting their feelings and protecting myself.\u201d\n\nOn working at \u2018The Tonight Show\u2019 during the Conan O\u2019Brien-Jay Leno drama\n\n\u201cIt was crazy. I didn\u2019t even really realize at the moment how monumental this was. Because I had just come on board so I was still learning the lay of the land. And we were rocking and rolling too. He had me coming out, doing bits on the show. It happened overnight, right after I got there. It was [O\u2019Brien\u2019s] decision [to leave NBC] and we were behind him 100 percent. Everybody was getting their affairs in order depending on what he wanted to do. But he took care of everybody. He took me on tour with him. It was insane. We were like true bonafide rock stars going from city to city and I was like, \u2018What is going on?\u2019\u201d\n\nNext week on The Last Laugh podcast: Creator and star of ABC\u2019s Bless This Mess, Lake Bell.", "description": "On this week\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Last Laugh\u201d podcast, the stand-up comic and co-star of \u201cBlack-ish\u201d and \u201cGrown-ish\u201d defends his right to \u201cmake mistakes.\u201d", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570502501/191007-Wilstein-Deon-Cole-last-laugh-tease_u3k6p5", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
