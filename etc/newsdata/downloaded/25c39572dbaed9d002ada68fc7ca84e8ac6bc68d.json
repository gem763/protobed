Unofficially, the 61-year-old telecom veteran has another title.\n\nHe is, hands down, the world\u2019s most relentless corporate pugilist.\n\nSince he arrived at T-Mobile in 2012, Mr. Legere has used every public forum at his disposal to bash and belittle his company\u2019s chief rivals, AT&T and Verizon; or as he likes to call them, \u201cDumb and Dumber.\u201d\n\nHe once bankrolled a Super Bowl ad to mock Verizon\u2019s taxes and fees. On another occasion, he posted a doctored version of Verizon\u2019s logo with a few alternative slogans, such as: \u201cscrews over customers.\u201d He not only does impressions of AT&T\u2019s Randall Stephenson, he once compared his rival CEO to Batman\u2019s evil nemesis, the Riddler.\n\nOperationally, Mr. Legere\u2019s favorite bludgeon is speed: T-Mobile has tried to run the competition ragged by cranking out new service plans and promotions at a dizzying pace.\n\nIn 2015, Mr. Legere spent several months loudly lobbying federal officials to slap stricter limits on how much low-frequency spectrum AT&T and Verizon could purchase in an upcoming auction.\n\nIt might be tempting to dismiss Mr. Legere\u2019s aggressive leadership style and occasionally profane language (he describes his attacks as \u201cjabs\u201d and \u201cgood-natured ribbing\u201d) as the product of one man\u2019s singular personality.After all, most CEOs don\u2019t sport shoulder-length hair, or wear motorcycle jackets to work, or have 6.4 million Twitter followers.\n\nJohn Legere, who savages business rivals, high-fives fans before an episode of his goofy, low-budget cooking show.

His opponents may loathe him\u2014but a large majority of his employees seem to genuinely like the guy.\n\nAt T-Mobile events, the marathon-running bachelor often enjoys receptions befitting a rock star, complete with the occasional marriage proposal. While Glassdoor\u2019s annual employee surveys aren\u2019t scientific, the 2019 edition gave Mr. Legere a 99% internal approval rating\u2014No. 4 overall among his CEO peers.\n\nMr. Legere\u2019s intensely tribal approach to management may seem new\u2014but in a sense, it harkens all the way back to the Old Testament.\n\nShare Your Thoughts How do you think leaders can balance a ruthless attitude when it comes to competition and a nurturing one within their own teams? Share your ideas below.\n\nThe four most famous words in the Book of Deuteronomy are \u201cthou shalt not kill.\u201d It\u2019s a commandment of mercy meant to regulate the way all people, leaders included, treat one another.\n\nAt the same time, Deuteronomy also includes one notable exception to that rule. If some neighboring community chooses to worship false idols, it says, \u201cThou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly.\u201d\n\nExamples of \u201cDeuteronomy management\u201d are rare in modern business, but they do exist. Facebook \u2019s Mark Zuckerberg isn\u2019t as publicly vitriolic, but like Mr. Legere, he\u2019s received consistently positive reviews from his own employees while earning a reputation as a formidable and ruthless competitor.\n\nThis mindset is more prevalent in team sports\u2014where one of the most prominent examples is Bill Russell, the former captain of the Boston Celtics who won a record 11 NBA titles in 13 seasons. Mr. Russell could be thoroughly nasty and arrogant toward opponents but was also selfless, caring and wholeheartedly loved inside the team. \u201cOne thing we\u2019ve always had on the Celtics is mutual respect,\u201d he once said.\n\nThe military has a strong tradition of Deuteronomy managers, including James Mattis, a longtime U.S. Marine Corps general and former defense secretary. Gen. Mattis was renowned for showing both toughness in battle and extraordinary kindness to his charges. In March 2003, on the eve of the Iraq War, he urged his troops to show the world \u201cthere is no better friend, no worse enemy than a U.S. Marine.\u201d\n\nMr. Legere\u2019s initial plan to turn T-Mobile around had nothing to do with Deuteronomy.\n\nEarly on, he hoped to distinguish T-Mobile from its larger rivals by rebranding it as the \u201cun-carrier.\u201d Ditching his former buttoned-down look was a calculated move to bolster that renegade image. He also figured that any good narrative needs a villain, and that throwing lots of jabs at AT&T and Verizon might energize his employees. \u201cThey just needed an advocate and something to rally around,\u201d he says.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to measure the precise value of a CEO\u2019s leadership, but so far, Mr. Legere\u2019s tenure at T-Mobile has been a ripping success. The company turned profitable during his first full year and has been in the black ever since. Revenue has soared and its share price has risen nearly fivefold since 2013. T-Mobile leapfrogged Sprint to become the nation\u2019s No. 3 carrier.\n\nDespite all of this, Mr. Legere hasn\u2019t inspired a wave of copycats. In fact, as I wrote in November, many major companies have gone the other direction\u2014hiring low-key CEOs who make very little public noise.\n\nMr. Legere\u2019s sharp-elbowed style sometimes invites comparisons to another polarizing leader, President Donald Trump. Mr. Legere knows this, and doesn\u2019t seem to mind. In a 2017 interview, he said he admires the president\u2019s determination to communicate frankly and directly with voters. \u201cHe is ignoring norms that I ignored as a CEO,\u201d Mr. Legere said. \u201cI don\u2019t know where it goes, but he\u2019s got game.\u201d\n\nScientists who\u2019ve studied \u201csocial-dominance theory,\u201d or the shared belief inside a group that it\u2019s only natural for one tribe to prevail over others, haven\u2019t painted a rosy picture. People who forcefully advocate for their own kind are more likely to disregard the rights and wellbeing of others. Historically, they say, groups that adopt an \u201cus-against-them\u201d mindset are more likely to tolerate oppression and discrimination.\n\nRunning a wireless carrier is nothing like leading a nation, of course\u2014Mr. Legere\u2019s attacks are relatively victimless. Besides, as the CEO of an upstart company battling for retail customers against large, incumbent players, it\u2019s not his job to be a unifier.\n\nThe larger question is whether his bellicose style is sustainable.\n\nT-Mobile\u2019s John Legere gives Marcelo Claure, chairman of Sprint Corp., \u2018bunny ears\u2019 before a House Judiciary Subcommittee hearing on the two companies\u2019 planned merger. Photo: Bloomberg\n\nMr. Legere\u2019s legacy may ultimately hinge on the outcome of his biggest, most controversial initiative: T-Mobile\u2019s proposed $26 billion-plus merger with Sprint. Although regulators approved the merger in July, a coalition of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit to block it on grounds that it will harm consumers.\n\nOn Thursday, New York City dialed up the pressure with another lawsuit. It alleges that one of T-Mobile\u2019s brands sold used phones as new devices and overcharged customers. T-Mobile said it\u2019s still investigating, but the suit\u2019s allegations are \u201ccompletely at odds\u201d with its team\u2019s integrity and commitment to customers.\n\nThe story of T-Mobile\u2019s CEO points to a couple of truths about combative leaders. For one thing, they\u2019re probably better off being nice to their own people. For business leaders, the larger lesson may be this: Throwing punches at rivals is only an effective strategy if it helps you connect with ordinary people.\n\nIf nothing else, the rise of social media has sharpened the public\u2019s radar for what\u2019s authentic and what\u2019s phony. People have grown suspicious of leaders who seem overly polished and scripted. We wonder what they might be hiding.\n\nMr. Legere uses social media to fire rockets, of course, but also to communicate with customers and invite them into his personal world. On Sundays, he uses his kitchen as the set for a goofy, low-budget online cooking show.\n\nIf Mr. Legere is playing a role, it\u2019s clearly one that suits him. To some extent, he simply decided to unmask himself at T-Mobile, jagged edges and all. It was a bet, really, that his customers, employees and shareholders would rather follow a three-dimensional human being than some cardboard stranger.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m outspoken and loud\u2014and yes, sometimes I call out the other guys and point out their bad behavior,\u201d Mr. Legere says. \u201cEverything I do is about one thing: inspiring people to be better and constantly pushing for innovation. It\u2019s been that way from day one, and I won\u2019t change.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Mr. Walker, a former reporter and editor at The Wall Street Journal, is the author of \u201cThe Captain Class: A New Theory of Leadership\u201d (Random House).\n\nWrite to Sam Walker at sam.walker@wsj.com", "description": "John Legere savages T-Mobile\u2019s competitors in a singular approach that has won him the devotion of his employees.", "authors": ["Sam Walker", "Facebook.Com Bysamwalker", "Sam.Walker Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-103858/social", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
