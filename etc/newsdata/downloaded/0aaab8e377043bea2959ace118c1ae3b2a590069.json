It\u2019s hard to pinpoint how the MBA helps, but I\u2019m sure I\u2019m better equipped for having done it.\u201d\n\nLight-bulb moment\n\nCameron Mudge can pinpoint exactly how his MBA helps in his role as Network Ten\u2019s Adelaide sales director. He started his MBA at the University of Adelaide in 2008, about 10 years into his career, to build his financial skills after focusing on marketing and operations in his undergraduate degree. He finished his MBA in 2012 with a much better understanding of people.\n\nHis first lecture, on the fundamentals of leadership, was the first Saturday in many years he was not playing sport, following an injury-induced sporting retirement.\n\n\u201cI was wishing I was playing footy \u2013 but within five minutes I thought, \u2018Wow, this is amazing. This is probably the real reason I\u2019m doing an MBA\u2019,\u201d says Mudge, who was then 31 and a client executive at DMG Radio (now Nova Entertainment Group), responsible for a group of advertisers but not managing an internal team.\n\nNetwork Ten's Cameron Mudge says his MBA changed his thinking and improved his people skills. Ben Searcy\n\n\u201cIt was a light-bulb moment for me, thinking about how humans interact. It changed my thinking quite substantially. It made me not be as quick to pass judgment or jump to conclusions without all the information at hand.\u201d\n\nHis people skills were further enhanced, he believes, by doing the degree face-to-face rather than online, interacting with engineers, lawyers, doctors and others from diverse industries.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe now oversees a team of 12, and says he adjusts his management style slightly for each person.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s been the greatest learning from the MBA for me, thinking about leadership and what it means. Being right doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 it can be a matter of opinion.\u201d\n\nMudge, who is aiming for a general manager or chief executive role in the future, says success is about performance rather than a piece of paper. \u201cBut the MBA has prepared me for when opportunities come along. And it\u2019s helped me cope and thrive in uncertain times, especially in the media.\u201d\n\nTicket out of the lab\n\nAnne Collins saw an MBA as a ticket out of the science lab. With a science degree from Oxford Brookes University, a master\u2019s degree and doctorate from University College London, and more than 10 years working in medical science, she wanted to beef up her commercial and management skills.\n\n\u201cYou learn a lot \u2013 about who am I, about how organisations work, about grey rather than black and white.,\" says Anne Collins. Supplied\n\n\u201cI felt I was being pigeon-holed as a scientist and I didn\u2019t want a career in the lab. I needed to diversify,\u201d says Collins, who started her MBA in 2006 at the University of Adelaide. She was in her late 30s and working full-time at the Adelaide subsidiary of global pharmaceutical company Hospira (now part of Pfizer). She travelled frequently to Hospira\u2019s US headquarters and was the single mother of a two-year-old daughter.\n\n\u201cIt took me six years, juggling work, family, travel and study,\u201d says Collins, who had been to a Hospira leadership course in the US and found that every job she aspired to in that company required an MBA. Despite the juggle, she preferred learning face-to-face rather than online, and spent 4pm-7pm most Wednesdays at a lecture on campus, close to her office and home. She also did a few subjects as summer intensives, taking 10 days off work.\n\nIn 2015, three years after finishing her MBA, she landed a role as general manager of microsampling at Trajan Scientific and Medical, developing devices to collect biological samples such as blood and skin. While the MBA was not a prerequisite, as it was for many US jobs, she says the skills it gave her \u201cto tackle problems and drive decisions\u201d were a factor in her success.\n\n\u201cYou learn a lot \u2013 about who am I, about how organisations work, about grey rather than black and white. I use [the finance stuff] every day without thinking about it. And the course in knowledge management \u2013 how you drive knowledge transfer and create value \u2013 was very helpful.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecovering the cost\n\nGeorge Ujvary does not hesitate when asked about the most helpful aspect of his MBA. For a project on business performance improvement, his study group analysed Ujvary\u2019s family business, Olga\u2019s Fine Foods, and came up with manufacturing improvements that in the first year saved the $38,000 cost of the MBA.\n\nGeorge Ujvary's MBA studies had an immediate impact on the family business, Olga's Fine Foods. Ben Searcy\n\nAnother benefit was a broader understanding of all aspects of business. Unlike others from the University of Adelaide\u2019s class of 2012, Ujvary hasn\u2019t used his MBA to change industries or jobs. He had been the managing director of Olga\u2019s, a meat and smallgoods producer founded by his father in 1978, for four years before he began the MBA in 2010, aged 35. And he already had a physiology degree and PhD from Oxford University, as well as two master\u2019s degrees from the University of Adelaide.\n\n\u201cI had a good understanding of the food manufacturing industry, but I knew nothing about marketing, finance \u2013 there were lots of gaps. If you are taking over a family-run business, you have an obligation to formalise your understanding of all aspects of business; I think it\u2019s negligent not to,\u201d he says, adding that he doesn\u2019t need to be an expert in everything, but he needs to be able to critically analyse if the expert he is talking to is any good.\n\nThe broader perspective has also been useful in a couple of board appointments \u2013 something Ujvary hopes to expand on in the future. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d be in a position to do the board work without the MBA,\u201d says Ujvary, who chairs Master Butchers Co-Operative and is a director of Food South Australia.\n\nUjvary\u2019s wife, Helen, was another factor in his decision to do an MBA. She had begun an international technology innovation consultancy after working as an investment banker in London and urged her husband to join her doing an MBA. \u201cShe kind of got me into it; I really didn\u2019t want to do more study. She said: \u2018I think it would be really romantic if we did an MBA together\u2019.\u201d\n\nImproved marketability\n\nLike Ujvary, Matthew Walsh has the same employer from before his MBA. But he has climbed a couple of management rungs, from relationship manager at Bendigo and Adelaide Bank when he began his MBA in 2010, aged 32, to his current position as a senior manager, risk and assessment, in the bank\u2019s portfolio funding division.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalsh was already a chartered accountant, but he was keen to broaden his technical knowledge in areas such as leadership, management, negotiation and entrepreneurship.\n\n\u201cIn 2010, the GFC was in full swing and I was thinking about ways to improve my marketability and make myself a bit more recession proof,\u201d he says.\n\nMatthew Walsh wanted to broaden his technical knowledge in areas such as leadership, management, negotiation and entrepreneurship. Ben Searcy\n\nHe believes the MBA delivered on that front, improving his problem-solving skills and self-awareness, and giving him a better understanding of how people work in groups and in different ways.\n\nThe highlight? Interviewing Bendigo and Adelaide Bank\u2019s then managing director Mike Hirst for a group assignment.\n\n\u201cIt gave me a much broader view of what he did and how some of the MBA theory was put into practice,\u201d says Walsh, who completed his MBA in 2012, three weeks before the birth of his first child.\n\nThe 2019 BOSS MBA Rankings will be published in AFR BOSS magazine on Friday.", "description": "Five alumni from the class of 2012 reflect on how their Adelaide University MBA helped them think differently and get ahead.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.173%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_88/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/9376ada4aae91bd7854c09095b8c5143d82b7ca9", "published_at": "2019-08-12"}
