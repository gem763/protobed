This new movement, which we are calling \u201cBe Brave. Do Something\u201d is enabling citizens to become catalysts for reform. It is the modern incarnation of what Jack Anderson once described as \u201cthe sirens of Greek mythology, who, by their seductive singing, enticed unknowing wayfarers to abandon the cramped boredom of safe passage for a hazardous try at strange excitements and gratifications.\u201d\n\nIf Project Veritas is the siren, the wayfarers this year have included two Google employees, a Facebook subcontractor and a Pinterest engineer who gave up their salaries and careers for the public\u2019s right to know. We\u2019ve had the privilege to entice these angels, knowing full well an army of grateful citizens are behind them. Project Veritas supporters have their backs no matter what as long as they stand up for what is true and important for the public to know.\n\n\u201cThis was an act of atonement. An attempt to make my conscience clear,\u201d said Zach Vorhies, who leaked us the \u201cAlgorithmic Unfairness\u2019 document inside Google.\n\n\u201cAre we going to just let the biggest tech companies decide who wins every election from now on?\u201d said Greg Coppola, who lost his job inside Google speaking out.\n\n\u201cI felt the public had a right to know,\u201d said the Facebook insider who was fired for taking screenshots of them \u201cDeboosting\u201d videos for political reasons.\n\n\u201cFor me there was no other option. I could go through the comforts of life, but what are we saving our ammo for,\u201d said Eric Cochran, the Pinterest engineer, who was escorted out the building. \u201cThey can stop one man, but they can\u2019t stop all of us.\n\nAnd so it was destiny that the CNN wayfarer met me in the Spring by a happenstance, inspired by the actions of the others who came before him, I received a simple answer as to why: \u201cI started at CNN with a dream to work in media, but my dream had become a nightmare,\u201d With that, a hidden camera began to record\u2026well\u2026everything.\n\nIn our current media landscape, people are famous figures for notoriety. Celebrity is a big name. Hero is a big man. So there is a new breed of heroes \u2013 the sort that Daniel Boorstin spoke about in his book The Image: \u201cIn our world of big names, our true heroes tend to be anonymous. In this life of illusion and quasi-illusion, the person of solid virtues who can be admired for something more substantial than his well-knowness often proves to be the unsung hero: the teacher, the nurse, the mother, the honest cop, the hard worker at lonely, underpaid, unglamorous, unpublicized jobs.\n\n\u201cThese anonymous heroes become part of the Veritas army.\u201d\n\nAnd then there is the act of investigating the media itself. Critics and political marketing industry operatives will rush to condemn this series of tapes with broad platitudes on how any efforts are \u201canti-journalist.\u201d We\u2019ve heard \u201cThe truth is more important than ever,\u201d \u201cDemocracy Dies in Darkness,\u201d and so forth. But behind the veneer of \u201cholier than thou\u201d sanctimonious attitudes are some ugly truths about the 4th estate.\n\nBut they are not new gathering. And our press isn\u2019t truly free.\n\nIn fact, based upon what the people in these tapes say, it\u2019s no longer even doing legitimate news gathering.\n\nThe media has become an industrial system of production that manufactures consent. This is true whether said by Noam Chomsky, James O\u2019Keefe, or Glenn Greenwald. Political implications aside, the media has become an organ of propaganda that is only about commercialism, clicks, ratings, power and influence and political advocacy. All the while, the press evades scrutiny by appealing to rights afforded by the 1st amendment, while adhering to none the accompanying duties.\n\nBig Tech and Big Media Corporations have more power than all three branches of government, but who holds them accountable? Who watches the watchmen? And why is it so important somebody holds them to account? Because doing their jobs is required in a Democracy.\n\nThe public\u2019s right to know make all other rights in our society possible, because our government exists with the consent of the governed, and this consent must be informed. People will make their own decisions when they are properly informed.\n\nReal journalism shouldn\u2019t only be discourse, moral judgments, and conclusions. It shouldn\u2019t have to engage in relentless speculation, punditry and stenography, opining to the masses. It should not abuse participation in advocacy work for anonymous leakers where sources in government get to set the agenda.\n\nInvestigative reporters (the real ones) have the duty to go beyond what somebody wants us to publish. What journalists ought to do is simply engage in the empirical method \u2014 to a degree so real \u2014 that the resulting truths transfix and anesthetize. When people are able to see what is happening, it becomes more real. We show that transgressions are in fact transgressions. The way to achieve proper reforms is to precisely capture reality.\n\nOn the Economic side, there is no question that much of corruption is due to economic pressures. Real truth finding often is a loss-leader in any business sense, and that\u2019s why it is almost completely extinct from commercial news gathering. Being \u201cthe tip of the spear\u201d often puts us in an exposed position where the results of our work reverberates into embarrassment, resignations, deeply penetrates the fabric of people\u2019s lives and violates social boundaries. That means litigation, retaliation and economic pressures. \u201cMany of the large media companies are fully integrated into the market, and for the others, too. The pressures of stockholders, directors, and bankers to focus on the bottom line are powerful.\u201d\n\nThe first step towards reforming the system is accurately reporting reality that shakes people awake with moral indignation. But in the digital era, with streaming visuals, hard to refute, we\u2019re able to cut through propaganda like a hot knife through butter, trusting the power of free people to make the best policy decisions if they are equipped with the truth. We break down the barrier between the realms of how public officials behave in public and private, and therefore tackle the great lie.\n\nIt seems like most of the people who are supposed to govern are busy staring into a TV camera. \u201cOne correspondent with one cameraman [can] become as important as twenty senators,\u201d as David Halberstam once wrote. They are protected from any public scrutiny. They demonstrate Sanctimonious, holier-than-thou smugness. Journalists are no longer about public service, and in private, they will change the subject if you talk about democracy dying in darkness. It\u2019s really about commercialism, clicks, ratings, power and influence.\n\nIt\u2019s not just politicians who kowtow to the cable news order and to the power it yields, it\u2019s the wealthiest man in the world saying that his most proud accomplishment was purchasing his woke, clickbait farm.\n\nJeff Bezos wrote on the Medium: \u201cEven though The Post is a complexifier for me, I do not at all regret my investment. The Post is a critical institution with a critical mission. My stewardship of The Post and my support of its mission, which will remain unswerving, is something I will be most proud of.\u201d\n\nThis man who has built the most powerful company on earth is most proud of the fact he bought a newspaper which isn\u2019t going to earn him any money.\n\nBut make no mistake: for Bezos, this isn\u2019t about informing the masses, it\u2019s about power and influence.\n\nSo, in a country governed by public opinion, and where public opinion is largely governed by the press, isn\u2019t it critical to understand what governs the press?\n\nAnd this is why Project Veritas will be exposing CNN this week.\n\nBE FIRST TO SEE THE DROP\n\nCLICK HERE TO SUPPORT OUR WORK", "description": "", "authors": ["Eric Spracklen"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
