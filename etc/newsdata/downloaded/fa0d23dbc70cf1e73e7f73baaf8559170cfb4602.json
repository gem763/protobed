All student athletes could receive sponsorships or payment for the use of their name, image and likeness rights, and they also could hire an agent or business manager without being penalized for doing so.\n\nGive student athletes more medical care\n\nColleges would be expected to comply with standards governing the health, safety and wellness of student athletes, and required to provide college athletes with the right to seek a second medical opinion without out-of-pocket expenses. Colleges would also be required to cover athletes\u2019 medical expenses for the treatment of injuries sustained or exacerbated during college competition for at least 10 years after eligibility.\n\nOn top of that, colleges would have to provide \u201clifetime scholarships\u201d to scholarship athletes who complete at least two years as a member of their respective teams \u2014 an idea previously supported by National Collegiate Athletic Association President Mark Emmert.\n\nStrengthen Title IX and gender pay equity\n\nBooker said he would strengthen Title IX compliance by requiring that spending for athletes, including financial aid, post-season awards, stipends and school-mediated group licensing funds, be \u201csubstantially proportionate\u201d to a college's male-female participation ratio.\n\nBooker would also sign into law the Athletics Fair Pay Act, which would require national governing bodies, including the United States Soccer Federation, to treat and compensate female athletes fairly and equally.\n\nAdditionally, his plan would improve pay and working conditions for minor league baseball players, and also advocate for the labor rights of cheerleaders and dancers.\n\nHow would it work?\n\nBooker would establish a new federal commission \u2014 dubbed the U.S. Commission on Integrity in Sports \u2014 to provide ongoing oversight of college athletics, the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee and national governing bodies. It would be charged with submitting policy recommendations to Congress.\n\nThe commission would be made up of current and former athletes, policy experts, academics and key administration officials from the departments of Justice, Labor, Health and Human Services and Education; the National Labor Relations Board; and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nTo improve college athlete academic performance, Booker\u2019s plan also calls on accrediting agencies and all NCAA-participating colleges to submit plans to the Department of Education for how they will support athletes. Specifically, the colleges would have to say how they would support athlete engagement and the formation of college athlete-run organizations, and how they would incorporate college athletes into the formation and review of policies and practices.\n\nThe Education Department would then be required to annually report data on athletes\u2019 educational outcomes, health and safety and freedom to choose their desired course of study.\n\nWhat have other candidates proposed?\n\nBooker's plan jumps off of California's \"Fair Pay to Play\" Act. Illinois, Florida and New York have pre-filed legislation mirroring California's law for the 2020 state legislative sessions, and lawmakers in another half-dozen states are considering introducing legislation.\n\nOf those vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, only entrepreneur Andrew Yang has a formal plan for paying college athletes. Though smaller in scale, the plan is similar to Booker's and the California law. The main difference is that Yang proposed creating a new type of athlete called a \u201cperformer athlete.\u201d\n\nWhile Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke have both taken to Twitter to say they are in favor of paying student athletes, neither has unveiled a formal plan.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/31/22/7ed1c5904ba4b34f56fcd628b98b/191009-booker-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
