For me, it was James Beacham\u2019s talk about the mysteries of time and space at TNW2019. His perfect blend of vivid descriptions, powerful visuals, and spine-tingling foresight about the universe left me completely captivated.\n\nEvery year, we handpick the best minds in tech, like Beacham, to leave our attendees radiating with inspiration. As we gear up for TNW2020, we think it\u2019s about time to reveal some big names you won\u2019t want to miss. But before we get ahead of ourselves, here\u2019s some essential info about our next flagship event:\n\nSave the date: TNW2020 is on June 18 and 19\n\nNext year will be the 15th edition of our annual tech event \u2014 pretty crazy, huh? And once again, we\u2019re thrilled to host it at NDSM in Amsterdam. The industrial waterside terrain truly made it feel like a festival. We can\u2019t wait to transform the 40,000 square meters into a tech playground all over again.\n\nWhile we pride ourselves on delivering goosebump-worthy content, the reasons to attend don\u2019t stop there.

Throughout his books and talks, Fried thinks deeply about collaboration, productivity, and the nature of work.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for revolutionary ways to keep your workplace happy and healthy, then Jason Fried is a must-see.\n\nChris Messina, inventor of the hashtag\n\nIn 2007, Chris Messina accidentally changed the world by inventing the hashtag. Who would\u2019ve thought the below tweet could have such an impact on the way we group messages and important events\u2026\n\nhow do you feel about using # (pound) for groups. As in #barcamp [msg]? \u2014 Chris Messina \u2933 SF (@chrismessina) August 23, 2007\n\nSince then, Messina has designed many powerful products and experiences for Google and Uber and founded several innovative startups.
