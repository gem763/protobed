Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday to review a three-judge panel's decision earlier this month upholding the Oversight Committee's demand for the president's finances.\n\nThey also filed a separate motion to stay the circuit court's decision, saying that they intend to \"ask the Supreme Court to review whether the Mazars subpoena exceeds the Committee\u2019s constitutional and statutory authority.\"\n\nThe president's lawyers argued that because there's a reasonable chance that the Supreme Court will take up their petition, the appeals court should hold off on expediting last week's order. The Hill\u2019s Harper Neidig explains why here.\n\nLEADING THE DAY\n\n2019 deficit nears $1 trillion, highest since 2012: Treasury: The federal deficit for fiscal 2019 reached close to $1 trillion for the first time since 2012, according to final Treasury Department figures released Friday.\n\nIn the final accounting, the deficit came in at $984 billion, more than $200 billion, or 25 percent, higher than last year and the same figure the Congressional Budget Office projected earlier in the month.\n\nThe deficit, which is projected to grow in 2020, has only surpassed $1 trillion four times in the nation's history, during the four-year stretch following the 2008 global financial crisis.\n\nWhile President Trump as a candidate had promised to wipe out the nation's debt altogether, it now stands above $22 trillion. The annual deficit, which adds to the nation's overall debt burden, was $587 billion in the last full fiscal year before Trump took office.\n\nThe Hill\u2019s Niv Elis tells us how we got here.\n\nON TAP NEXT WEEK\n\nTuesday:\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) begins its two-day meeting in Washington, D.C.\n\nA House Financial Services subcommittee holds a hearing on LGBTQ+ discrimination within the housing and lending industries, 10 a.m.\n\nA House Judiciary subcommittee holds a hearing entitled \"Antitrust and Economic Opportunity: Competition in Labor Markets,\u201d 10 a.m.\n\nThe House Financial Services Committee holds a markup of pending legislation related to the Export-Import Bank, terrorism risk insurance, 1 p.m.\n\nWednesday:\n\nThe House Financial Services Committee continues its Tuesday markup , 10 a.m.\n\nThe FOMC announces its October interest rate decision at 2 p.m., followed by a press conference with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell at 2:30 p.m.\n\nThe Senate Budget Committee holds a hearing on the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, 2:30 p.m.\n\nThursday:\n\nThe Senate Homeland Security Committee holds a hearing entitled \u201cSupply Chain Security, Global Competitiveness, and 5G,\u201d 9:30 a.m.\n\nNEXT WEEK\u2019S NEWS, NOW\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to cut interest rates Wednesday for the third consecutive month as the economy continues to slow under the weight of fading global demand and rising trade tensions.
