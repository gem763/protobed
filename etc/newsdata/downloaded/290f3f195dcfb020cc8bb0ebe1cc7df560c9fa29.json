Usually, she would be forced to settle for vanilla, Jesse's favourite.\n\nBut this year, there was no birthday girl for her to argue with about the flavour of the ici\n\nng, or to wish well for the year ahead.\n\nTwo months after Jesse and her 85-year-old grandfather Chris Lategan were found dead in the family\u2019s Parow flat on August 30, no one has been arrested.\n\nThe first-year University of the Western Cape theology student \u2013 a youth leader who dreamt of becoming a preacher - was found on a bed, while Chris was discovered tied up in the toilet.\n\nThe family moved out of the one-bedroom council unit that same day. They took only their clothes, not wanting anything else in the once happy home that had become a crime scene.\n\n\"What was important to us \u2013 Jesse and her oupa Chris - was taken. They were gone. Everything else, the furniture, the possessions, doesn't mean anything. I didn't care what happened to it after it was dusted for prints, whether it was sold or burnt. Every item reminded us of what had happened.\"\n\nJesse Hess and her grandfather were murdered during what is thought to be a robbery. Only a TV set, two cellphones and Jesse\u2019s backpack were taken. (Facebook, Jesse Hess)\n\nOn Friday, the remaining members of their household \u2013 ouma Cathy, Sandy, her son, as well as Jesse's brother \u2013 celebrated the teenager's birthday with a family dinner.\n\nFriends and family visited her graveside over the weekend to spruce it up and lay fresh flowers.\n\n\"Jesse loved her birthday and all the presents and attention she would get. My mother would wake up at 04:30 to get ready for work and start singing for her in those early hours. Jesse would be wide awake. I would have to force her to go back to sleep because she wanted to be up, that time of the morning, to enjoy her day.\"\n\nThis year, 67-year-old grandma Cathy had no one to sing to.\n\n\"She lost her granddaughter and her husband. She doesn't sleep at night \u2013 she can't, not without a sleeping tablet,\" Sandy said.\n\nHer mother, who had been in retirement, has since started working as a Grade R teacher to keep herself occupied.\n\n\"Last Sunday was their wedding anniversary. She was so heartbroken. She only wants to know why they did it. Those two wouldn't even have hurt a fly. Why them?\n\n\"They had been in their home. She was studying, he was watching soccer. Why did they come in here? Why did they do this?\"\n\nJesse Hess was only 18 when she and her grandfather Chris Lategan were found dead in their Parow home on August 30. (Facebook, Jesse Hess)\n\nThought to be a robbery, only a TV set, two cellphones and Jesse's backpack were stolen from the house.\n\nSandy is convinced there is more to the murders than meets the eye.\n\n\"The music system had been unplugged, but wasn't taken. There were three laptops in the house. Why was that all they took? It doesn't make sense to me,\" she said.\n\nHours before her murder, Jesse had won R5 000 in a competition on Heart 104.9FM.\n\nIn a clip which the radio station shared, Hess said she had been saving money to do something special for her relatives at the end of the year.\n\nShe had sounded excited about winning, saying she could spoil her grandparents and aunt who had taken her in. Her mother worked as a hairdresser on a cruise ship and Jesse and her brother had lived with their extended family for years.\n\nSandy said the station had since doubled the prize money.\n\n\"She had planned to take us for spa and relaxation treatments, so I think that is what we'll do. I think we truly need it.\"\n\nThe first year theology student dreamt of becoming a preacher. (Facebook, Jesse Hess)\n\nSandy on Monday praised the police officers investigating the case. Despite no one being arrested, she had been kept abreast of all developments, she said.\n\nA private investigator was also probing the murders. This after more than R66 000 was raised through crowdfunding.\n\nPolice spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk on Monday said the investigation was still underway.\n\nSandy is hopeful that a breakthrough will be made.\n\n\"I want closure. We all do. But first I need to know what happened, why they came in and did this. I can't deal with it until someone is arrested. Only then I can grieve.\"", "description": "When Sandy Hess tucked into her slice of chocolate cake on her niece Jesse\u2019s 19th birthday, the treat was bittersweet.
