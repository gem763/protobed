(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The general who oversaw the U.S. raid on Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi provided the most detailed account yet of the operation Wednesday and said the U.S. is on alert for possible \"retribution attacks\" by extremists.\n\nGen. Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, said al-Baghdadi's remains were buried at sea within 24 hours of his death inside an underground tunnel where he fled as special operations soldiers closed in on him.\n\nThe Pentagon released the first government photos and video clips of the nighttime operation, including one showing Delta Force commandos approaching the walls of the compound in which al-Baghdadi and others were found.\n\nAnother video showed American airstrikes on other militants who fired at helicopters carrying soldiers to the compound. The U.S. also bombed the compound after the soldiers completed the mission so that it would not stand as a shrine to al-Baghdadi.\n\n\"It looks pretty much like a parking lot with large potholes right now,\" McKenzie said.\n\nThe attacking American force launched from an undisclosed location inside Syria for the one-hour helicopter ride to the compound, McKenzie said.\n\nTwo children died with al-Baghdadi when he detonated a bomb vest, McKenzie said, adding that this was one fewer than originally reported. He said the children appeared to be under the age of 12. Eleven other children were escorted from the site unharmed. Four women and two men who were wearing suicide vests and refused to surrender inside the compound were killed, McKenzie said.\n\nThe general said the military dog that was injured during the raid is a four-year veteran with U.S. Special Operations Command and had been on approximately 50 combat missions.\n\nThe dog, a male whose name has not been released because the mission was classified, was injured when he came in contact with exposed live electrical cables in the tunnel after al-Baghdadi detonated his vest, McKenzie said. He said the dog has returned to duty.\n\nBaghdadi was identified by comparing his DNA to a sample collected in 2004 by U.S. forces in Iraq, where he had been detained.\n\nThe U.S. managed to collect \"substantial\" amounts of documentation and electronics during the rain, McKenzie said, but he would not elaborate. Such efforts are a standard feature of raids against high-level extremist targets and can be useful in learning more about the group's plans.\n\nAlthough the raid was successful, McKenzie said it would be a mistake to conclude that the Islamic State has been defeated.\n\n\"It will take them some time to re-establish someone to lead the organization, and during that period of time their actions may be a little bit disjointed,\" the general said. \"They will be dangerous. We suspect they will try some form of retribution attack, and we are postured and prepared for that.\"\n\nIn outlining the operation, McKenzie said al-Baghdadi had been at the compound in Syria's northwest Idlib province for \"a considerable period,\" but he was not specific.\n\nHe said the raid was briefed to President Donald Trump on Friday, and McKenzie made the decision to go ahead on Saturday morning.\n\nMcKenzie offered no new details about al-Baghdadi's final moments.\n\n\"He crawled into a hole with two small children and blew himself up while his people stayed on the grounds,\" he said when asked by a reporter about al-Baghdadi's last moments and Trump's description of the Islamic State leader as \"whimpering and crying and screaming all the way\" to his death.\n\nOther senior Pentagon officials, including Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have said they could not confirm Trump's description.\n\nSeveral times this month, President Donald Trump has said he is withdrawing from Syria and that the troops are \"coming home.\" But, in fact, the U.S. military remains in the country, shifting positions and gearing up to execute Trump's order to secure Syria's oil fields \u2014 not for the Syrian government but for the Kurds. Trump also has said he wants to \"keep\" the oil, although it's unclear what he means.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, the acting homeland security secretary, Kevin McAleenan, told a congressional hearing that U.S. security agencies have been reminded of the potential for al-Baghdadi's death to inspire his followers to launch an attack \"in the immediate aftermath.\"", "description": "A U.S. counterterrorism official said Wednesday he expects a new Islamic State leader to emerge after the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and warned that the extremist group's planning of major attacks probably will go on as before.  \"The ideology continues, the resonance continues, and that is", "authors": ["Lolita C.
