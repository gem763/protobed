The White House promoted Doral as the single best venue in the United States to host the G-7 summit in June, and the meeting would have brought thousands of guests in the offseason to a resort that is struggling financially.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFor months, Trump had touted Doral as an ideal venue to host visiting dignitaries, and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney made the choice official at a news conference Thursday.\n\nBut in a rare reversal in the face of public pressure for a president who prides himself in rarely folding or admitting failure, Trump said Saturday that he and his administration would search for a new location. He attributed the concession to \u201cIrrational Hostility\u201d from Democrats as well as the media, although the revolt among some Republicans may well have been the trigger.\n\nIn a trio of tweets late Saturday, Trump wrote, \u201cI thought I was doing something very good for our Country by using Trump National Doral, in Miami, for hosting the G-7 Leaders. It is big, grand, on hundreds of acres, next to MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, has tremendous ballrooms & meeting rooms, and each delegation would have . . . its own 50 to 70 unit building. Would set up better than other alternatives. I announced that I would be willing to do it at NO PROFIT or, if legally permissible, at ZERO COST to the USA. But, as usual, the Hostile Media & their Democrat Partners went CRAZY!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe president added: \u201cTherefore, based on both Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility, we will no longer consider Trump National Doral, Miami, as the Host Site for the G-7 in 2020. We will begin the search for another site, including the possibility of Camp David, immediately. Thank you!\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Mulvaney trumpeted Doral as the best property in the country to host a gathering of this nature. He said that after the president first recommended that the resort near Miami be considered, an advance team from the White House scouted it along with other sites. After considering locations in California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Michigan, North Carolina, Tennessee and Utah, Doral was selected, Mulvaney said.\n\n\u201cI was aware of the political, sort of, criticism that we\u2019d come under for doing it at Doral, which is why I was so surprised when the advance team called back and said that this is the perfect physical location to do this,\u201d Mulvaney told reporters.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMulvaney\u2019s announcement sparked immediate criticism \u2014 not only from Democrats but also from some Republican lawmakers who ordinarily defend the president\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s not a good thing to have the appearance \u2014 you know, in the law, there\u2019s a canon that says, \u2018Avoid the appearance of impropriety,\u2019 \u201d said Rep. Francis Rooney (R-Fla.). \u201cI think that would be better if he would not use his hotel for this kind of stuff.\u201d\n\nDoral has been struggling in recent years. The property saw its net operating income decline 69 percent from 2015 to 2017, according to documents the Trump Organization filed with Miami-Dade County.\n\nHosting the G-7 summit would have been a major boon for the company, filling the hotel in June, a month when the resort is typically less than 40 percent full. Tourism in South Florida generally is not as high in the summer as it is in the winter, in part because of the region\u2019s heat and humidity.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe White House had said Trump\u2019s resort would only present an \u201cat cost\u201d charge for the summit, but never spelled out what that cost would be. The questions were still unanswered Saturday, when Trump pulled the plug.\n\nBeyond questions about the ethics of a president awarding a gigantic summit to himself, there were also security questions: How could anyone seal off a sprawling resort set among neighborhoods and office parks?\n\nThe White House had said that 11 other sites were examined as possible locations but never gave details about them. In his tweet, Trump seemed to indicate he might hold a summit at a site that wasn\u2019t on that list: Camp David, the famous presidential retreat in rural Maryland. President Barack Obama held the G-7 meeting there in 2012, the last time the leaders gathered in the United States.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTrump\u2019s suggestion of Camp David was especially odd considering Mulvaney dismissed the site at his Thursday news briefing as a poor summit location.\n\n\u201cI understand the folks who participated in it hated it and thought it was a miserable place to have the G-7,\u201d Mulvaney told reporters. \u201cIt was way too small. It was way too remote. My understanding is this media didn\u2019t like it because you had to drive an hour on a bus to get there either way.\u201d\n\nTrump has been publicly pitching Doral as a G-7 summit site since at least this past summer. At a news conference during this year\u2019s G-7 in Biarritz, France, Trump bragged at length about Doral. He cited its location near Miami International Airport, ample parking space, restaurants, spacious ballrooms, \u201cbungalows\u201d and \u201cvery luxurious rooms with magnificent views.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like such a natural,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s about getting the right location. I think it\u2019s very important.\u201d\n\nMike DeBonis contributed to this report.\n\nAD", "description": "President Trump was buffeted by two straight days of allegations of self-dealing and exasperation from lawmakers on Capitol Hill, including some Republican allies who said the selection of Doral as the venue for a gathering of world leaders was indefensible.", "authors": ["Philip Rucker", "White House Bureau Chief", "David A.
