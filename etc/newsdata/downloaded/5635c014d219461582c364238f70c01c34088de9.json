I'm so grateful we have one another.\"\n\nAccording to the New York Times, she also expressed, \"It\u2019s a funny thing to say, but I\u2019m very proud of our divorce.\"\n\n\"I think Bruce was fearful at the beginning that I was going to make our split difficult, and that I would express my anger and whatever baggage that I had from our marriage by obstructing his access to the kids -- that I\u2019d turn to all of those ploys divorcing couples use as weapons. But I didn\u2019t, and neither did he,\" she writes. \"[The split] wasn\u2019t easy at first, but we managed to move the heart of our relationship, the heart of what created out family, into something new that gave the girls a loving, supportive environment with both parents.\"\n\n\"We felt more connected than we did before the divorce,\" Moore adds.\n\nOrder \"Inside Out: A Memoir\" by Demi Moore here.", "description": "Demi Moore, Bruce Willis and their daughters were all smiles at the book launch party for Moore's memoir, 'Inside Out.'", "authors": ["Aol.Com Editors"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/22AiaU9u_cebdp_vhJARBw--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/1442x945+807+388/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-09/82d639b0-dfab-11e9-be71-4f86546be0f9", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
