This went on for over two miles.\n\nA violent obsession\n\nJaymes appeared to be a normal teenager.\n\nHe lived at home with his parents and was training for a job in hospitality.\n\nBut he had secrets.\n\n(Image: AAP/PA Images)\n\nFor over a year he\u2019d been obsessed with watching pornography and scoured the internet to satisfy his growing lust for sexual violence.\n\nHis searches revealed an interest in \u2018emo\u2019 women \u2013 a style Eurydice was known for \u2013 and a horrific desire to watch content that featured rape.\n\nAlthough Jaymes was clean and well dressed in public, the home he shared with his family was squalid.\n\nThere was rubbish piled outside, and inside was a mess.\n\nThat afternoon, he\u2019d been out drinking and smoking drugs with friends.\n\nIn the darkness, Eurydice reached the city\u2019s tranquil Princes Park, and she slipped off her shoes.\n\nShe loved to feel the grass between her toes as she walked.\n\nAfter crossing the fields, she messaged Tony at around midnight.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m almost home HBU [how about you?]\u2019.\n\nShe was less than a mile from home.\n\nJaymes had been following her for around an hour.\n\nWhen Eurydice reached a football field, Jaymes struck.\n\nHe attacked her from behind and she fought back, scratching his face.\n\nBut he overpowered Eurydice by sitting on her chest.\n\nJaymes raped her and held down her windpipe until she choked to death.\n\nThen he walked away into the night.\n\nJaymes watched more violent porn on his phone, had a sleep on a bench, then bought a pie and a coffee.\n\nHe tried to return to the scene, but police were already there.\n\nIn the early hours of 13 June, a member of the public had found Eurydice on his way back from work.\n\nHe\u2019d called 911 and desperately tried to revive her with CPR, but it was too late.\n\nWhen word of Eurydice\u2019s murder was made public, the city was in shock.\n\nFlowers were left at the scene and other comedians paid tribute to a lost talent and held events in her honour.\n\nCCTV help\n\nAt home, Jaymes was busy searching Princes Park on Google to read more about his crime and coverage of his victim.\n\nBut then he started to get messages from a friend who said his face was all over the news.\n\nCCTV footage of a man seen following Eurydice had been released by the police \u2013 it was clearly Jaymes.\n\nHe had no choice but to hand himself in.\n\nAt first, he denied attacking Eurydice and said the scratches on his face were from his cat.\n\nThen after a few hours he confessed, but gave several different versions of what happened.\n\nHis DNA was found at the scene, so Jaymes was charged with the murder.\n\nIn November, he pleaded guilty.\n\n(Image: AAP/PA Images)\n\nMeanwhile, a vigil took place at Princes Park with the aim to \u2018take it back\u2019 from the horror that had happened there, and to restore it to the peaceful space the locals loved.\n\nOver 10,000 people came.\n\nAt hearings this year, Jaymes Todd, now 20, yawned through proceedings.\n\nHis lawyers said he had autism and social problems that might have lead to his actions, but the judge said he was simply a sexual deviant who had no excuse for his crime.\n\nThe trial\n\nEurydice\u2019s sister, Polly Cotton, cried as she spoke of her grief.\n\n\u2018I want to see her, hear her, be with her, have coffee with her, but because she was murdered I will never see her again,\u2019 she wept.\n\n\u2018I wish regularly over the course of my day that I could have saved her\u2026 this has shattered and destroyed my family.\u2019\n\nEurydice\u2019s heartbroken boyfriend Tony said he suffers constant flashbacks and is plagued by the sound of screaming.\n\n\u2018I will never look at the human race the same way again,\u2019 he said.\n\nJaymes was diagnosed with sexual sadism disorder while in custody and it was agreed he was a threat to the public.\n\nHis obsession with violent rape had left an innocent woman dead.\n\nIn September this year, Justice Stephen Kaye sentenced Jaymes to life in prison wth a minimum of 35 years before being eligible for parole.\n\nHe called his crimes \u2018totally and categorically evil\u2019.\n\n(Image: AAP/PA Images)\n\n\u2018You waited until Eurydice was well into the dark reaches of Princes Park,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018The sheer terror that Eurydice must have experienced\u2026 is unimaginable.\u2019\n\nHer legacy\n\nOutside court, Eurydice\u2019s father showed incredible compassion in his statement, saying that a killer was off the streets and it was a terrible tragedy for all involved.\n\n\u2018What I wish for Jaymes Todd, and what I believe Eurydice would wish, is that he gets better, and realises what he\u2019s done,\u2019 he said.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u2018Eurydice herself should be remembered, as her friends will remember her, for her wit and her courage and for her kindness, not for her death.\u2019\n\nThe government in Victoria has announced Stand Up! grants to be given to rising female comedians in her memory.\n\nWhile Jaymes was a coward, lurking in the darkness, Eurydice was courageous and was never afraid to make her voice heard.\n\nWith her legacy growing stronger and brighter every day, Eurydice will never be forgotten. \u25a0", "description": "As comedian Eurydice Dixon, 22, walked home alone after a stand-up gig, evil predator Jaymes Todd was waiting to strike\u2026", "authors": ["Gail Shortland", "Image", "Aap Pa Images", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20386658.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Eurydice-Dixon-3JPGa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
