I can\u2019t think properly,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how this is equitable. This superpower had 10 years to prepare for this case and I can\u2019t access my writings. It\u2019s very difficult where I am to do anything but these people have unlimited resources.\n\n\u201cThey are saying journalists and whistleblowers are enemies of the people. They have unfair advantages dealing with documents. They [know] the interior of my life with my psychologist. They steal my children\u2019s DNA. This is not equitable what is happening here.\u201d\n\nMark Sommers, defending Assange, claimed the US had been spying on Assange. \u201cThis is part of an avowed war on whistleblowers to include investigative journalists and publishers,\u201d Sommers said. \u201cThe American state has been actively engaged in intruding on privileged discussions between Mr Assange and his lawyer.\u201d\n\nAssange, 48, the founder of WikiLeaks, faces extradition to the US over allegations he conspired to break into a classified Pentagon computer. He faces 17 charges of spying and one of computer hacking, meaning he could face a 175-year sentence in a US jail if convicted.\n\nIn his third public appearance since his arrest in April, Assange wore a dark suit and a blue jumper and was clean-shaven. As he entered the dock, people in the public gallery raised their fists in solidarity with him.\n\nThe prosecutor James Lewis QC, representing the government, said he strongly opposed Assange being given more time to prepare evidence, pre-empting a request from Assange\u2019s team.\n\nSommers said: \u201cBeing realistic, we need another three months.\u201d\n\nThe proceedings in court went on while a protest outside organised by the Socialist Equality party took place, attended by dozens of activists chanting \u201cFree Julian Assange\u201d and \u201cNo extradition, there\u2019s only one decision\u201d.\n\nAmong those in the packed public gallery were the former London mayor Ken Livingstone and the journalist John Pilger.\n\nOutside court there was a protest organised by the Socialist Equality party. Dozens of activists chanted \u201cFree Julian Assange\u201d and \u201cNo extradition, there\u2019s only one decision\u201d.\n\nAssange last appeared in court in May when he was jailed for 50 weeks for skipping bail by going into hiding in the Ecuadorian embassy in London in 2012. He had done so to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he was wanted in connection with sexual offence allegations.\n\nIn his previous hearing at Westminster magistrates court, on 11 April, the day he was dragged out of the embassy by police after Ecuador revoked his political asylum, Assange was remanded in custody.\n\nIn June the then home secretary, Sajid Javid, signed an order allowing Assange to be extradited to the US over the allegations.\n\nInformation released by Wikileaks revealed the extent of state surveillance in western countries and the conduct of the US troops in the Middle East, which Assange alleged proved war crimes had been perpetrated.\n\nThe case was adjourned until 18 November for a \u201ccall over date\u201d by videolink, since Assange must present himself every 28 days.\n\nThe final hearing in his extradition case is now due to take place on 25 February.", "description": "WikiLeaks founder\u2019s legal team wanted an extra three months to submit evidence", "authors": ["Mattha Busby"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2d99c07dcae1182f8b125a5d3129444f8618929/0_0_2016_1210/master/2016.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4d782b4665a964f8c0c6cd2be25f70d7", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
