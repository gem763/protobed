We believe the government\u2019s proposed withdrawal agreement is contrary to section 55 of the Taxation (Cross-border Trade) Act 2018.\n\n\u201cWe do not understand how the government might have come to negotiate a withdrawal agreement in terms that breach amendments tabled by its own European Research Group.\n\n\u201cUnless and until section 55 is repealed by the UK parliament, it is simply not open, as a matter of law, for the United Kingdom to enter into such an agreement.\n\n\u201cIf the proposed withdrawal agreement is unlawful, the government will be obliged to request an extension as mandated by the Benn act and in accordance with undertakings given to the court of session in Vince, Maugham, Cherry v Boris Johnson.\u201d", "description": "Legal action to be lodged in Scotland on basis withdrawal agreement contravenes law", "authors": ["Pa Media"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ac3e7c820965149bc29e7ea6eb116f3c45179f5/0_28_5260_3156/master/5260.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bf7a4b63f44c9a00a23b631b4d463bea", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
