Nicklas Backstrom added three assists, while Braden Holtby made 27 stops.\n\nAuston Matthews, with two goals and an assist, and Andreas Johnsson replied for Toronto (6-5-3), which got 30 saves from Frederik Andersen.\n\nThe Capitals went on the man advantage 21 seconds into the extra period when William Nylander tripped Tom Wilson.\n\nWashington set up camp in Toronto's zone, with Ovechkin, Backstrom and Carlson all firing away, but couldn't find a winner.\n\nMitch Marner then high-sticked Carlson one second before Nylander's penalty expired, keeping the Leafs on the penalty kill.\n\nOvechkin scored his 11th on a bullet one-timer from his patented spot in the left face-off circle at the four-minute mark of the extra period.\n\nSpecial teams struggles\n\nToronto got a power play \u2014 its eighth of the night \u2014 with three minutes to go in the third period when Capitals defenceman Radko Gudas was whistled for delay of game after driving Alexander Kerfoot into the Washington goal.\n\nMatthews, Nylander and Kasperi Kapanen all had good chances with man advantage, but Holtby was there at every turn to force overtime.\n\nTied 2-2 after 40 minutes, Matthews put Toronto ahead early in the third when the Leafs centre buried his 11th overall. Toronto's power play had been 0 for 6 before finally connecting when he took a pass from Nylander and ripped a shot upstairs at 1:46 of the third.\n\nAuston Matthews celebrates his second-period goal with William Nylander and Andreas Johnsson. (Hans Deryk/The Canadian Press)\n\nThe goal came after Wilson took a run at Toronto defenceman Tyson Barrie, drawing a response from Leafs fourth-liner Frederik Gauthier.\n\nBut the Capitals tied things at 4:10 when T.J. Oshie stepped past Leafs blue-liner Morgan Rielly \u2014 who logged big minutes with his team down to five defencemen after Wilson took Jake Muzzin out with a hit in the first \u2014 and fed Ovechkin for his 10th.\n\nThe Capitals entered 5-0-1 over their last six \u2014 including 3-0-1 on a season-long five-game road trip that took them through western Canada before wrapping up at Scotiabank Arena \u2014 and an NHL-best 6-1-1 mark away from home.\n\nStruggling to find traction early in the season, Toronto was coming off Saturday's 5-2 loss at Montreal in second half of a back-to-back following Friday's 4-1 home win against San Jose. Washington, meanwhile, rebounded from a 5-1 deficit late in the second period to beat Vancouver 6-5 in a shootout Friday.\n\nOvechkin walks the walk\n\nOvechkin, who endured repeated playoff failures before finally breaking through with his franchise's first Stanley Cup in 2018, called the Leafs out for their approach in what has overall been a sputtering start to the season after Tuesday's morning skate.\n\n\"They're still a young group of guys, hopefully they're going to learn,\" said Washington's 34-year-old captain. \"But it's up to them how they want to do it. If they want to play for themselves or if they want to win the Stanley Cup, they have to play differently.\"\n\nThe Leafs, who played their league-leading ninth home game, responded by opening the scoring just 40 seconds into the first when Matthews found Johnsson in front and he ripped his fourth upstairs on Holtby.\n\nThe Capitals got level at 10:47 after the Leafs were caught running around in their own zone. Ovechkin whipped a pass across the ice that Carlson let bounce off the boards before one-timing a laser beam into the top corner on Andersen from the right face-off dot for his sixth goal and eye-popping 22nd point of October.\n\nJohn Carlson celebrates his first-period goal. He finishes October with 22 points, the second-most points ever in the month among defencemen. (Hans Deryk/The Canadian Press)\n\nToronto had a great opportunity on a 5-on-3 power play for 43 seconds, but couldn't connect after using its timeout to keep the No. 1 unit fresh.\n\nWashington got a two-man advantage of its own in the second and made it count when Carlson took a feed from Ovechkin and blasted his seventh \u2014 and 23rd point \u2014 past a helpless Andersen to make it 2-1 at 7:59.\n\nThe 29-year-old Carlson finished the month two points shy of the record of 25 by a defenceman in October set by Al MacInnis in 1990.\n\nWashington, which beat Toronto 4-3 at home on Oct. 16, appeared set to head to intermission up a goal, but Matthews tied it seemingly out of nowhere with 32.9 on a slick deflection of Barrie's shot between the legs and into the top corner.\n\nToronto defenceman Travis Dermott played his first game of 2019-20 after shoulder surgery for an injury sustained in the Leafs' first-round loss to Boston last spring. Head coach Mike Babcock said he expects captain John Tavares, who broke a finger late in that earlier loss to Washington, to make his return before winger and linemate Zach Hyman (knee).", "description": "Alex Ovechkin scored his second goal of the game as part of a four-point night while on the power play in overtime as the Washington Capitals defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs 4-3 on Tuesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5340534.1572401846!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ovi-alex-102919.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
