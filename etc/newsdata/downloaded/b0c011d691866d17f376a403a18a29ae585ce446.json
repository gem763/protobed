Rupert, who had recently had open-heart surgery, jumped in to try to protect her and fell down.\n\nWildlife experts say bobcats are quite common in urban areas but attacks are extremely rare. Most humans never lay eyes on the animal.\n\nThe attack occurred around 6:15 a.m. near the couple\u2019s apartment and both were transported to the hospital. Elsen suffered puncture wounds to her face and arm and lost part of her finger. Rupert had been discharged from the hospital by Friday evening.\n\nLauderhill police issued a warning for people in the Fort Lauderdale suburb to be on alert. \"The animal involved in the attack is still on the loose. Officials are still combing the area in search of it,\" the police statement read.\n\nFIFTH PARENT RECEIVES SENTENCE IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL AND IT'S THE STIFFEST ONE YET\n\nBobcats are common throughout North America, but bobcat attacks are not. The elusive critters typically weigh between 25 and 35 pounds and are usually shy around humans. They can be drawn to apartment complexes because they love to eat the rodents that can be found near the trash.\n\n\"I have never heard of anything like this,\" said Carole Baskin, founder and CEO of Big Cat Rescue in Tampa, which houses 20 bobcats among other animals. \"Any wild bobcat is not going to walk up to a human. They are extremely shy.\"\n\n21-YEAR-OLD FLORIDA JUROR JAILED FOR OVERSLEEPING AND MISSING TRIAL\n\nAuthorities have not said the attacker was definitively a bobcat, but both Ruperts are certain of it. \u201cWe have no confirmation that it was a bobcat,\u201d Lauderhill Assistant Fire Chief Jeff Levy told 7 News Miami. \"If indeed it was a bobcat attack ... that would be an unusual event in a metropolitan area like this.\u201d\n\n\"I saw a lot of blood,\" neighbor Victoria Wong, who was among the first to find the injured couple, told news outlets. \"She was sitting down and I asked her, 'What happened?' and she said, 'Bobcat.'\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nOther residents were just as astounded. \u201cWe\u2019re in Florida, so we expect the animals -- but a bobcat or something that can attack like that? Maybe it was owned by someone? Domestic? It just doesn\u2019t make sense, you know,\u201d said resident Nancy Parisiem.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "An animal believed to be a bobcat attacked a couple out on their morning walk in an urban area of\u00a0South Florida on\u00a0Friday.", "authors": ["Morgan Phillips"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/04/bobcat-iStock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
