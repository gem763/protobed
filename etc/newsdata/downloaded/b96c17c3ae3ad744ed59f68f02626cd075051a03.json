The front-month contract was at $66.20 per barrel, up $5.98, or 9.9%, from their previous close, at by 0343 GMT.\n\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures climbed by as much as 15.5% to $63.34 a barrel, the biggest intra-day percentage gain since June 22, 1998. The front-month contract was at $59.73 a barrel, up $4.88, or 8.9%, at 0343 GMT.\n\nSaudi Arabia is the world\u2019s biggest oil exporter and the attack on the state-owned producer Saudi Aramco\u2019s processing facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais has cut output by 5.7 million barrels per day. The company has not given a timeline for the resumption of full output.\n\nA source close to the matter told Reuters the return to full oil capacity could take \u201cweeks, not days.\u201d\n\nSaudi Arabia\u2019s oil exports will continue as normal this week as the kingdom taps into stocks from its large storage facilities, an industry source briefed on the developments told Reuters on Sunday.\n\n\u201cHow the United States and Saudi Arabia deal with the situation will be closely watched,\u201d said Margaret Yang, market analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore.\n\n\u201cIf higher oil prices are here to stay, Asia\u2019s oil reliant economies such as China, Japan, India, South Korea and the Philippines will start to feel the pain as higher energy and raw material prices add on the cost burden,\u201d Yang added.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said he approved the release of oil from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) if needed in a quantity to be determined due to the attack.\n\nThe attack on plants in the heartland of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil industry, including the world\u2019s biggest petroleum-processing facility at Abqaiq, came from the direction of Iran, and cruise missiles may have been used, according to a senior U.S. official. Initial reports indicated the attack came from Yemen.\n\nTrump also said the United States was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d for a potential response to the attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil facilities.\n\nRISK PREMIUM\n\nANZ Research said in a note that the market would price in \u201ca sizable global geopolitical risk premium\u201d.\n\n\u201cAny expectation that the market had about the U.S. easing sanctions on Iran following President Trump\u2019s dismissal of John Bolton will quickly dissipate. This should see Brent crude test the $70 per barrel mark in the short term,\u201d ANZ Research said.\n\nSaudi Arabia is set to become a significant buyer of refined products after the attacks, consultancy Energy Aspects said in a note.\n\nSaudi Aramco will likely buy significant quantities of gasoline, diesel and possibly fuel oil while cutting liquefied petroleum gas exports.\n\nU.S. gasoline futures rose as much 12.9%, while U.S. heating oil futures rose by as much as 10.8%. China\u2019s Shanghai crude oil futures rose to its trading limit, gaining 8% at the open.\n\nMeanwhile, Saudi Aramco has told one Indian refinery there will be no immediate impact on oil supplies as it will deliver crude from other sources and has adequate inventory, a source with the refinery said.\n\nOther Asian buyers such as Thailand have also said the attack would have no immediate impact on oil imports.", "description": "Oil prices surged on Monday, with Brent crude posting its biggest intra-day percentage gain since the start of the Gulf War in 1991, after an attack on Saudi Arabian oil facilities on Saturday shut in the equivalent of 5% of global supply.", "authors": ["Jane Chung", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190916&t=2&i=1430303734&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8F03E", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
