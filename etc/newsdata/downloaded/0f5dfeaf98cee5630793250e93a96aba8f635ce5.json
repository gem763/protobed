REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw\n\nJoaquin Phoenix, who won rave reviews at the festival, plays DC Comics superhero Batman\u2019s nemesis, and the story follows his transformation from vulnerable loner to confident villain.\n\n\u201cJoker\u201d distances itself from typical superhero films, with somber lighting and dark music throughout.\n\n\u201cI want to thank Warner Bros and DC for stepping out of their comfort zone and taking such a bold swing on me and this movie,\u201d director Todd Phillips said in his acceptance speech, also thanking Phoenix for trusting him with his \u201cinsane talent\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is no movie without Joaquin Phoenix ... Joaquin is the fiercest and bravest and most open-minded lion that I know.\u201d\n\nThe film was generating awards buzz even before Venice. The festival is considered a launch pad for the awards season, having premiered Oscar winners like \u201cRoma\u201d and \u201cBirdman\u201d.\n\nIn a surprise move, Polanski\u2019s \u201cAn Officer and a Spy\u201d took the Silver Lion Grand Jury Prize.\n\nAt a time of #MeToo and with only two female directors out of 21 in the competition line-up, festival organizers had faced criticism for including Polanski\u2019s work in the program due to renewed controversy over his conviction for a sex crime.\n\nThey defended the move, saying it was the film, not the man, being judged. Jury member Paolo Virzi told a news conference the judges had solely focused on the movie in their discussions.\n\nPolanski pleaded guilty in 1977 to having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl in Los Angeles. He fled the United States in 1978 for fear a deal for leniency with prosecutors would be overruled and he would get a lengthy prison term. Aged 86, he now lives in Europe.\n\nThe French-Polish director, who was expelled from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences last year, did not travel to Venice. His wife Emmanuelle Seigner, who stars in the film, collected the award on his behalf.\n\n\u201cHe is very happy and I am convinced this is a very important movie for him, it will give him a lot,\u201d she told reporters.\n\nAsked how she felt about those critical of the film\u2019s festival inclusion, Seigner told Reuters: \u201cWe won, that\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d\n\nMIGRANT CRISIS\n\nItalian actor Luca Marinelli won best actor for his portrayal of a poor, aspiring writer in \u201cMartin Eden\u201d. France\u2019s Ariane Ascaride won best actress for \u201cGloria Mundi\u201d in which she plays a mother desperate to help her cash-strapped family.\n\nBoth referenced the migrant crisis in their speeches.\n\n\u201cThis prize is for all who sleep for eternity at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea,\u201d Ascaride said.\n\nMarinelli dedicated his to \u201cthe incredible people who are at sea rescuing other humans fleeing unimaginable situations\u201d.\n\nBest director went to Sweden\u2019s Roy Andersson for \u201cAbout Endlessness\u201d, a mix of short stories of kindness and cruelty.\n\nItalian director Franco Maresca won the Special Jury Prize for satirical documentary film \u201cMafia Is No Longer What It Used to Be\u201d.\n\nBest screenplay went to Chinese filmmaker Yonfan for the animation \u201cNo. 7 Cherry Lane\u201d, a romance set in 1960s Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cI am really excited ... people always complain that my movies (have a) lack of drama and the writing is not good. Today I got the best script (award),\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAmerican Skin\u201d by Nate Parker, whose inclusion in the festival was also a talking point, triumphed outside the official competition, taking the Filming Italy Award for Best Film of the Sconfini Section.\n\nParker\u2019s 2016 movie \u201cBirth of a Nation\u201d, stumbled after renewed public interest in a 1999 rape charge against the filmmaker, of which he was acquitted.", "description": "Dark drama \"Joker\" about the origins of the villainous character won the Golden Lion award at the Venice Film Festival on Saturday, while Roman Polanski's military drama about France's notorious Dreyfus affair took the runner-up prize.", "authors": ["Marie-Louise Gumuchian", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427347862&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF860Y2-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
