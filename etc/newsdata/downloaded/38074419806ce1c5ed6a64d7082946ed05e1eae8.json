And I miss him already.\n\nPeople like Elijah do not come like grapes in bunches; he was the rarest of breeds. He walked and worked with queens, kings, speakers and presidents, yet he treasured traversing and conversing with his Baltimore family the most. In the best of times, as well as during the most challenging of times, Elijah Cummings remained steadfast in his love for, his belief in and his presence among his community.
