There is never any serious debate about continued NATO expansion. It is simply taken for granted as something that the alliance will keep doing for as long as it can get away with it. The lopsided vote in the Senate is proof that this alliance commitment has been made automatically and unthinkingly. Almost nothing in our foreign policy debates commands near-unanimous support like this, and when that happens it is a good sign that no real debate has occurred. Sens. Paul and Lee deserve credit for voting against the measure. It is telling that the supposedly NATO-skeptic Trump has expressed no opposition to bringing in Montenegro or North Macedonia. Ben Friedman remarks on this:\n\nNATO is expanding pointlessly, but neither the Trump administration occasionally skeptical of the alliance or the all the people denouncing their isolationism seem to have noticed. The triumph of the blobby status quo does\u2019t fit their narrative. https://t.co/BRhbGusLtA \u2014 Ben Friedman (@BH_Friedman) October 23, 2019\n\nNorth Macedonia\u2019s accession doesn\u2019t risk dragging the alliance into a war, unlike some other current and prospective members, but it also serves no purpose for the alliance or U.S. security. The U.S. has far too many security commitments as it is, so if we are going to add another one there had better be a compelling reason for it. But there is no compelling reason to bring this country into the alliance. It is treating membership in a military alliance as a cookie to reward their government for good behavior. That is the wrong reason to extend a serious security guarantee, and it paves the way for making the same mistake again in the future.\n\nIf this were the end of NATO expansion, it would still be the wrong move, but at least it wouldn\u2019t leave the door open to more mistakes. Unfortunately, the alliance insists on keeping that door open indefinitely. This won\u2019t be the last time the alliance expands, but it should be.", "description": "", "authors": ["Daniel Larison"], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NATO-Trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
