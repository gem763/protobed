He made good copy. He knew how to manipulate the press and dictate stories to the New York tabloids. He surrounded himself with gorgeous women. There was always something of a nefarious nature going on. He was like a caged animal who would go after you the minute the cage door was opened.\n\nMr. Trump, Mr. Tyrnauer said, \u201cswallowed Roy Cohn whole.\u201d (Or, as new resistance fighter Anthony Scaramucci put it, it\u2019s \u201cas if Roy Cohn and Joe McCarthy got together and had a baby and it ended up being Donald Trump.\u201d)The flashy developer loved Mr. Cohn\u2019s unapologetic defiance. When the federal government sued the Trumps in 1973 under the Fair Housing Act for refusing to rent apartments to black people, they hired Mr. Cohn, who filed a countersuit for $100 million for defamation.\n\nMr. Cohn eventually slipped from his perch of dark allure and became embroiled in an embezzlement scandal and the seamy case of a death connected to a mysterious fire on a yacht. In his final months, when he was decimated by AIDS, Mr. Trump dropped him.\n\nMr. Cohn may have emanated \u201cthe presence of evil,\u201d as someone says in the movie, but he was loyal to his friends. He learned the hard way that his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was not. \u201cDonald pisses ice water,\u201d Mr. Cohn reportedly said before his death.\n\nI asked Mr. Tyrnauer why there has not been a moment with President Trump, as there was with Senator McCarthy (Mr. Cohn cleaved to his side) when the bully definitively gets called out for having no decency, sir, and the giant out-of-control balloon is punctured.\n\n\u201cThere were only three networks at that time, so that moment could really land,\u201d Mr. Tyrnauer said. \u201cI think Mueller was the closest thing to Joseph Welch that we have because he\u2019s a straight shooter and looks the part. But his delivery didn\u2019t land. And the media landscape is so fractured now.\u201d", "description": "A Vanity Fair correspondent turned documentarian with a fascination for figures of the late 20th century.", "authors": ["Maureen Dowd"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/01/fashion/01WITH-TYRNAUER2/01WITH-TYRNAUER2-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
