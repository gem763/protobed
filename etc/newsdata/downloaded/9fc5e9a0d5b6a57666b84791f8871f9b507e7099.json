That and more in Trysta Krick's Week 7 overreactions. USA TODAY\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. \u2014 The New England Patriots were already up 24 points.\n\nIt was the middle of the second quarter and the defense had just picked off New York Jets quarterback Sam Darnold for the second time in the red zone. At that point, it was New England\u2019s third turnover, overall. The game, even this early on, was all but over.\n\nBut Patriots coach Bill Belichick called over his entire defense for a rare in-game meeting of the entire unit. They huddled around him on the bench. Belichick kneeled. Then, for about a minute and a half, Belichick drilled into the defense. The message was clear.\n\nClean it up.\n\nThe Patriots, before safety Duron Harmon leapt and cradled Darnold\u2019s wayward pass, had committed three penalties in the series \u2014 a defensive holding, a defensive pass interference, and a roughing the passer \u2014 that gifted New York first downs.\n\nWhen you\u2019re one of the best teams in the NFL and dismantling your opponents the way New England is, it\u2019s all about fine-tuning and the pursuit of perfection.\n\n\u201cIt don\u2019t matter the score on the board, he\u2019s out there trying to make us better,\u201d cornerback Stephon Gilmore told USA TODAY Sports. \u201cThat\u2019s why he is who he is. That\u2019s what makes him so great. We adjust and get better on the next play. He\u2019s a great coach for a reason and I\u2019m just happy that he\u2019s my coach.\u201d\n\nJETS QB STRUGGLES: Sam Darnold said he was 'seeing ghosts' against Patriots\n\nWINNERS, LOSERS: Aaron Rodgers now in MVP race\n\nFOOTBALL FIX: NFL news delivered to your inbox\n\nIt was a rough night for Jets QB Sam Darnold against the Patriots defense. (Photo: Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThe Patriots embarrassed the Jets on Monday night, 33-0, to improve to 7-0 and remain one of the two undefeated squads in the NFL. And while the offense capitalized on New York\u2019s six turnovers, five of them by Darnold, it is this defense that makes the squad a Super Bowl contender and arguably the strongest team in the AFC \u2014 if not the league.\n\nNew England relentlessly blitzed Darnold, making him uncomfortable, and clamped down on Jet targets with man coverage. They disguised their coverages, often flashing blitzes, only to drop back seven players.\n\nDarnold finished the game 11 of 32 for 86 yards, no touchdowns, four interceptions, one fumble, and a QB rating of 3.6. The yardage and QB rating were career lows. The five turnovers were a career high.\n\n\u201cThose guys, man, they work hard, they have fun, and we feed off of that,\u201d receiver Julian Edelman said. \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable to watch. We just try to do adjustments (on the sideline), and then you peek over and see one of the 15 or 17 playmakers they have making a play. It\u2019s awesome to see. And it helps us.\u201d\n\nDuring the ESPN broadcast, Darnold wore a microphone that caught him saying, \u201cI\u2019m seeing ghosts\u201d in reference to the pressure the Patriots brought.\n\nIt\u2019s fitting, considering the Patriots linebackers have a nickname they\u2019ve given themselves.\n\n\u201cOooh, he did?\u201d linebacker Kyle Van Noy said. \u201cOooh, man, that\u2019s the boogeyman.\u201d\n\nDarnold was never comfortable. The disguising of the pressure often had him retreating, throwing off of his back foot. He also appeared to struggle making adjustments at the line of scrimmage, seeming to shift the protection of the offensive line in the wrong direction.\n\n\u201cIt gets tough when they go with all their little guys and try to figure out who\u2019s doing what and who\u2019s covering who,\u201d Jets coach Adam Gase said. \u201cWho has the tight end? Who has the back? It can get tough sometimes.\u201d\n\nAs Jets running back Le\u2019Veon Bell lamented: \u201cThey had one more person than we could block.\u201d\n\nThe Jets had 154 yards of total offense, went two of 11 on third-down tries, and didn\u2019t convert either of their two trips into the red zone.\n\nThe Patriots, sitting at plus-175, have the largest point differential after seven games in the Super Bowl era. They\u2019ve allowed 48 points, or 6.9 per game, which puts them on pace for 110 for the season. That would shatter the NFL record of 165 by the 2000 Baltimore Ravens.\n\nWhat\u2019s almost incredible is that of those 48 points allowed, 21 came off of turnovers that were returned for touchdowns.\n\nNew England\u2019s secondary has forced 18 interceptions and has given up just one passing touchdown. Those 18 are most for a team through seven games in a season since the 1996 Packers had 20.\n\nThe criticism of the Patriots so far this season wasn\u2019t so much about them, but about their schedule and the teams they\u2019ve played. To be sure, the schedule has had its share of weaker opponents, including the 1-5 Jets twice. New England\u2019s opponents so far this season have combined for a 12-32 record (.272).\n\nThe Patriots, however, don\u2019t set their schedule. It\u2019s not their fault that they\u2019ve taken advantage of their opponents.\n\nThat will change in the coming weeks.\n\nThe Patriots will now face the Browns (2-4) and the Ravens (5-2) before their Week 10 bye, and then will play the Eagles (3-4), the Cowboys (4-3), the Texans (4-3), and the Chiefs (5-2). It\u2019s a stretch that will define New England\u2019s season and will determine whether the Patriot defense will truly be historic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the blueprint of coming out each week, each day in practice, putting in the work, studying film (and) getting on the same page,\u201d McCourty said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about adjustments right after the coin toss of something that might come in a game. These guys are that locked in. We have to keep doing it because for the rest of the season, we\u2019re going to get every offense\u2019s best shot. They\u2019re going to be ready to go. We\u2019re not a surprise anymore, we just have to keep being locked in.\u201d\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.
