I'm proud of my scar and totally in love with it.\u201d\n\nTrina has also urged women to get checked out \"as soon as you feel something is unusual,\" after she waited five months before visiting a GP.\n\nTrina admits while she found the lump in early 2018 she initially put it to the back of her mind, \u201cI ignored it. I figured \u201cit\u2019s just girl thing\u201d and it would just go\u201d she admits.\n\nShe said: \u201cIt felt just like a bit of grizzle or a fatty lump. It was movable. At times it was painful \u2013 usually around \u201cthat time of the month\u201d and it grew as time went on. I was worried but didn\u2019t really speak to anyone about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs the months went by it grew and I had a sinking feeling that something was wrong yet still put off going to the doctor out of embarrassment mostly and fear of what may come of it.\u201d\n\nAfter she went to the GP she was diagnosed with Stage 2 breast cancer. The lump which was originally pea sized was now something which could no longer be ignored.\n\n(Image: Tri Cleary/Instagram)\n\nShe said: \u201cVisibly you could see a difference in the size of both my breasts, my bra was tighter on that breast.\"\n\n\u201cWhenever I done my self examination I had that sinking feeling in my gut and I just knew. That gut feeling is rarely wrong.\u201d\n\nWhile initially doctors believed the lump was most likely a cyst, a mammogram showed it was cancer, by the time Trina was diagnosed, the cancer had spread to my lymph nodes in my arm pit.\n\nHowever, she also urges other women to know the importance of checking your breasts and taking action as early as possible, even if they think any changes are harmless.\n\n(Image: Tri Cleary/Instagram)\n\n(Image: Tri Cleary/Instagram)\n\nShe said: \u201cI wasn't too young, I wasn't too healthy , I wasn't too fit, cancer doesn't discriminate on these factors so if any young girl (or boy) feels something is unusual, I would urge them to be seen. Minding yourself is nothing to be ashamed of.\n\n\u201cIf I could go back and give myself advice it would be to go to the doctor sooner, if I had if I feel this journey would have been a very different one.\u201d\n\nHowever she admits that she has changed as a person and learned a great deal from her experience, revealing: \u201cYes, the journey I have been on wasn't a great one, but I feel like a new person now I have come out the other side. Almost like a new lease of life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't sweat the small stuff anymore because life really is too short. I learned that I am stronger than I give myself credit for.\u201d", "description": "\u201cIf I could go back and give myself advice it would be to go to the doctor sooner, if I had if I feel this journey would have been a very different one.\u201d", "authors": ["Blanthin De Paor", "Image", "Tri Cleary Instagram"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20470745.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_THP_CHPP_051019Slug_2425JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
