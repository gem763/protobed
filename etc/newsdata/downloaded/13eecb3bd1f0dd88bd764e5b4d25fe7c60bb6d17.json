Although he was not the leader of Al-Qaeda, he quickly followed in his father's footsteps and climbed the ranks of the Islamic State, a rival terrorist organization.\n\nHamza bin Laden's father, Osama, the mastermind behind the September 11th attacks, was killed during a United States' military raid in 2011.\n\nThis is a breaking news story. As more information comes in, this post will be updated.", "description": "This just in..09/14/2019 19:56:50PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2017/305/1b453f61-82ec-49d1-8d88-3eaacff2e471.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
