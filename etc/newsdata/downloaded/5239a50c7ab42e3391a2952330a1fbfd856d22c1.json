REUTERS/Stephen Lam\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Tim Cook on Thursday defended the iPhone maker\u2019s decision to remove from its app store a police-tracking app used by protesters in Hong Kong, according to a copy of a letter to employees seen by Reuters and confirmed by Apple.\n\nIn the message on an internal Apple website, Cook said the information in the app, including crowdsourced locations of police checkpoints and protest hotspots, was on its own \u201cbenign.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is no secret that technology can be used for good or for ill. This case is no different,\u201d Cook wrote.\n\nCook wrote that Apple based its decision on \u201ccredible information\u201d from both Hong Kong police and Apple users in Hong Kong that the app was used \u201cmaliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimize individuals and property where no police are present.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis use put the app in violation of Hong Kong law,\u201d Cook said. \u201cSimilarly, widespread abuse clearly violates our App Store guidelines barring personal harm.\u201d\n\nApple made the decision a day after a Chinese state newspaper wrote a commentary criticizing the company for approving the app.\n\n\u201cNational and international debates will outlive us all, and, while important, they do not govern the facts,\u201d Cook wrote in his letter. \u201cIn this case, we thoroughly reviewed them, and we believe this decision best protects our users.\u201d", "description": "Apple Inc Chief Executive Tim Cook on Thursday defended the iPhone maker's decision to remove from its app store a police-tracking app used by protesters in Hong Kong, according to a copy of a letter to employees seen by Reuters and confirmed by Apple.", "authors": ["Stephen Nellis", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439397902&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991ZP", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
