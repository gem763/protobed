At least, for another four hours.\n\nThe line of t-shirts, hoodies, sweatpants, hats, and shorts coincides with the release of the Scott / Air Jordan collab.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how much those Jordans will cost ya, but you can register on Scott\u2019s website to get updates. Oh yeah: you also have less than four hours to do so.\n\nThe rest of the merch will set you back a pretty penny, with shirts setting you back $55 USD and hoodies $95. The gear\u2019s colour swatch revolves around browns, greens, and yellow, and is all adorned with the iconic Michael Jordan logo, too.\n\nA previous batch of Highest in the Room merch has already sold out, so if you\u2019re really keen it\u2019s probably best not to hesitate.", "description": "", "authors": ["Brad Esposito"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/10/hfdhdfjdj.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
