Photo: Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nAs the Trump administration continues its silly little dance around the possibility of openly supporting the common-sense gun-sales restrictions that Americans overwhelmingly support, the low comedy is intensifying, as this Politico report indicates:\n\nThe White House this week began circulating a much-anticipated gun background check proposal to Republicans on Capitol Hill, though it\u2019s unclear if President Donald Trump supports it.\n\nThe punchline came pretty early in this story. But in case you missed it, there\u2019s more:\n\nThe plan is narrower than a universal background checks bill passed by the House and pushed by top Democrats like Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.\n\nThe administration, however, is distancing itself from the proposal and the president is not aggressively pushing it.\n\n\u201cThe President has not signed off on anything yet but has been clear he wants meaningful solutions that actually protect the American people and could potentially prevent these tragedies from ever happening again,\u201d said Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman.\n\nAs far as the document circulating on the Hill, he added: \u201cThat is not a White House document, and any suggestion to the contrary is completely false.\u201d\n\nIs the document circulating itself? No, it doesn\u2019t appear so:\n\nThe document was circulated Tuesday to Republicans by Attorney General William Barr and White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear, to put it mildly, why the attorney general of the United States and the White House\u2019s chief congressional liaison would be shopping around a proposal that they might denounce at any moment. But then again, they work for Donald J. Trump, who is apparently trying to stay on the good side of an organization whose leaders are nearly as sinister and prone to shouting as he is:\n\n\u201cThis missive is a non-starter with the NRA and our 5 million members because it burdens law-abiding gun owners while ignoring what actually matters: fixing the broken mental-health system and the prosecution of violent criminals,\u201d said Jason Ouimet, executive director of the NRA\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action.\n\nAnd as it happens, reports Politico, the gun lobby has its own point man, former NRA staffer Michael Williams, inside the White House fighting the background-check loophole proposal. You don\u2019t have to be psychic to predict how this is going to turn out after somebody\u2019s \u2014 not Trump\u2019s! \u2014 gun proposal is fully circulated. It adds to the fun that the president could flip and flop in every which direction before the deal goes down, all the while angrily attacking anyone who guesses wrong about where he is at any given moment.", "description": "The White House is circulating a very modest universal gun background check bill while disclaiming any support or responsibility for it, probably because the NRA is already denouncing it, and also because Trump could repudiate it.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/18/18-trump-bushes.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
