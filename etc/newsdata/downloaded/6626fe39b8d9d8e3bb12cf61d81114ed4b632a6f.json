It doesn't require ageing, unlike other spirits, meaning it is relatively quick and inexpensive to produce. A search for \"gin\" on Amazon's U.K. website produces more than 10,000 results.\n\nAmazon has been expanding its own range of goods, listed under \"Our Brands\", which are created by Amazon or its partners and sold exclusively on the site. These benefit Amazon by offering better margins and can be used to help persuade big brands to cut prices.", "description": "Amazon is adding to its own-label product line with its first spirit brand in the U.K. called Tovess Gin.
