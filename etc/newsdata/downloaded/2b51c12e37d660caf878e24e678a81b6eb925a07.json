They were accused. And they lost their right to work.\u201d\n\nAt issue is Ms. Messing\u2019s response to an Aug. 29 piece by The Hollywood Reporter detailing an upcoming fundraiser in Beverly Hills for the president.\n\n\u201cPlease print a list of all attendees please,\u201d the \u201cWill & Grace\u201d star tweeted. \u201cThe public has a right to know.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a good idea, okay?\u201d Ms. Goldberg said, Mediaite reported. \u201cYour idea of who you don\u2019t want to work with is your personal business. Do not encourage people to print out lists because the next list that comes out, your name will be on, and then people will be coming after you! \u2026 You don\u2019t have to like it, but we don\u2019t go after people because we don\u2019t like who they voted for. We don\u2019t go after them that way. We can talk about issues and stuff, but we don\u2019t print out lists.\u201d\n\nCo-host Joy Behar concurred, saying that a distinct difference should be made between publicizing the political leanings of corporations and individuals.\n\n\u201cWhen it\u2019s individuals, I think that then you\u2019re stalking and you\u2019re starting to endanger a person\u2019s life, so I don\u2019t approve of that.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s fundraiser is scheduled to take place on Sept. 17, THR reported.\n\nPlease print a list of all attendees please. The public has a right to know. https://t.co/YV4UoxrPHI \u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) August 31, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
