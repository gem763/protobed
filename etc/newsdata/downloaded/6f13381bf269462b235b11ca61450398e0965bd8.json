Center for Medical Progress (CMP), the jury for the first time viewed a clip of the initial CMP video featuring Dr. Deborah Nucatola, eating salad and drinking wine as she appeared to be discussing how she performs abortions in order to harvest the best unborn baby body parts.\n\nAs a result of CMP\u2019s video series that purports to show Planned Parenthood\u2019s involvement in the illegal sale of the body parts of aborted babies, the abortion industry giant brought a lawsuit against the pro-life activists at CMP, accusing them of violating the Federal Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).\n\nAs the trial proceeds in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in San Francisco, CMP project lead David Daleiden has been posting daily summaries of the trial at CMP\u2019s website. He wrote regarding the jury\u2019s first viewing of a clip from the video, released in July 2015, featuring Nucatola, former Medical Director for Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA):\n\nFor the first time in open court, the Defense played for the jury approximately 4 and a half minutes of Dr. Nucatola\u2019s conversation with CMP undercover investigators at a public restaurant in Los Angeles, in which she described using ultrasound guidance to flip a baby in the womb to feet-first breech position, in order to extract the baby intact and harvest whole, fresh organs. On the clip, Dr. Nucatola states, \u201cWe\u2019ve been pretty successful with that, I\u2019d say.\u201d Dr. Nucatola testified under oath that when this video was released in 2015, she \u201cfelt the content was no big deal\u201d and that she didn\u2019t think she said anything inappropriate on the video.\n\nAt issue during the trial are reported inconsistencies in Nucatola\u2019s statements, including concerning the vetting procedures for vendors at the National Abortion Federation (NAF) conferences. Daleiden and his CMP colleagues were able to gain access to Planned Parenthood officials, abortionists, and biomedical procurement executives to conduct their undercover videos at NAF conferences when they posed as representatives from the fictitious \u201cBioMax\u201d biomedical company.\n\nDaleiden wrote:\n\nDr. Nucatola also testified that she relied on the National Abortion Federation\u2019s alleged \u201cvetting\u201d of conference exhibitors to engage with CMP undercover actors representing BioMax Procurement Services, because she believed NAF was the \u201cgold standard\u201d for security in the abortion industry. However, Dr. Nucatola testified that to this day she has no knowledge of what if anything NAF actually does to \u201cvet\u201d exhibitors at its trade shows.\n\nAccording to a report at pro-life organization Live Action:\n\nNucatola took the stand and admitted she didn\u2019t know the vetting procedures for exhibitors at the National Abortion Federation conferences. According to Pro-life San Francisco\u2019s [Terrisa] Bukovinac, Nucatola also stated she could see the people at other tables near her during her lunch with Daleiden when she spoke of fetal tissue procurement and that \u201cthey could have heard what I was saying at the time.\u201d She also said that she didn\u2019t share \u201cconfidential information\u201d during the meeting. She said she did nothing wrong.\n\nNucatola also testified, according to the report, that, after CMP released its video of her lunch with Daleiden, she received a threatening voicemail and grew worried for her family\u2019s safety. Subsequently, she screened her phone messages and hired an armed bodyguard at various times for the next six months.\n\n\u201cShe also admitted that she has never kept her identity as an abortionist a secret and said she commits 50 to 500 abortions a month up to 24 weeks \u2014 or after, if necessary,\u201d Live Action noted.\n\nBukovinac told Live Action that, at one point, defense attorney Paul Jonna reportedly brought to the attention of the court an email thread between Nucatola and Melissa Farrell, research director for Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast. In the email, Farrell reportedly said she was suspicious Daleiden \u201cwas a fraud who could \u2018put affiliates at risk,\u2019 but Nucatola said that he could be trusted.\u201d\n\nThe Live Action report continued on the point of Nucatola\u2019s previous statements regarding the effect of the video on her:\n\nJonna played a video of Nucatola\u2019s deposition from March in which she testified that Daleiden should be held responsible \u201cto those they damaged.\u201d But when asked if she wanted Daleiden and the other defendants to be held responsible to her, she smiled and said, \u201cThey didn\u2019t damage me.\u201d These contradictory claims caused her to be impeached as a witness, her credibility lost, because in her deposition she testified to not having been damaged by the investigation, but in the trial stated that she and her family were damaged by it. She tried to spin it, said Bukovinac, by stating that she meant they didn\u2019t damage her spirit.\n\n\u201cThis completely impeached Nucatola\u2019s testimony and destroyed her credibility,\u201d also wrote Cheryl Sullenger, senior vice president at pro-life activist organization Operation Rescue.\n\n\u201cNucatola was supposed to be Planned Parenthood\u2019s star witness,\u201d Sullenger continued. \u201cThat moment may have provided a turning point for the defense.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood initially sought over $20 million in damages in the case, but those damages have since been reduced to several hundred thousands of dollars, in addition to legal and attorney fees, which could yet run into millions of dollars.\n\nIn a separate criminal case against Daleiden and his CMP colleague Sandra Merritt, they are the first undercover journalists to be criminally prosecuted in the history of the state of California.", "description": "The jury in the Planned Parenthood video trial viewed a clip of Dr. Nucatola lunching while discussing harvesting baby body parts.", "authors": ["Dr. Susan Berry"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Dr.-Nucatola-Center-for-Medical-Progress-640x480-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
