Formidable feminist campaigners had fought, hustled and campaigned to establish the UK\u2019s first residential college that allowed women through its gates. Five of them, possessing considerable intelligence, began their first term at university \u2013 and changed the very nature of women\u2019s education. One hundred and fifty years later, it\u2019s hard to imagine not being able to access a decent education simply because you were born the wrong sex.\n\nIn 2018, women were storming their way across university. Data shows that 57 per cent of all students in higher education were female. Statistics from Ucas revealed that 98,000 more women than men applied to university. However, this road has been long, complicated and defined by the unwavering resilience of the women who recognised their right to learn. \u201cIn a way, the opening of Girton changed everything,\u201d says Professor Susan Smith, who has been the mistress of Girton since 2009: \u201cIt opened a doorway and was part of an unstoppable movement across the UK whereby women were seeking to improve their participation in wider society.\u201d\n\nOriginally named the College for Women at Benslow House, Girton was an experiment in how far women with a desire for knowledge could go. The University of Cambridge, which had been founded more than 600 years earlier, was known for its prestige and renowned worldwide but remained woefully sexist. To get women into this institution had the potential to change women\u2019s lives forever.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Sixteen of them would pass, despite many originating from poor educational backgrounds. When term first started three months later, five women entered the grounds and began their education. The impact was significant. Between October 1869 and June 1900, at least 725 students attended the college, setting a precedent for women everywhere.\n\nSo who exactly where the Girton girls? Emily Gibson (1849-1934) was the first applicant to start at the college, having intellectually outgrown the limited education that had been previously available to girls. Next was the slightly older student, Anna Lloyd, who ended up dropping out before her residency ended. Like many female students, she faced considerable scorn from her sisters for pursuing an education and eschewing the domestic activities that were expected of her. Isabella Townshend \u2013 Gibson\u2019s sister-in-law \u2013 also dropped out in 1872. She was described by fellow students as being \u201cartistic\u201d and was perhaps better suited to the arts.\n\nInspired by the pioneering legacy of Girton, Dame Louisa Innes Lumsden (1840-1935) was particularly gifted. She originally attended the Edinburgh Ladies Education Association, where she took part in lectures but was not allowed to go further. After being a student at Girton until 1872, she became a tutor for 1873-74. Beyond Girton, Lumsden\u2019s reach was significant. A stint as a headmistress at the progressive St Leonards School in Fife, from 1877-82, and a job as warden of University Hall, Scotland\u2019s first residential hall for women, followed. If this wasn\u2019t enough, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree by St Andrews University in 1911 and was made a dame in 1925.\n\nFinally, we come to Sarah Woodhead (1851-1912), who was the first women to sit and pass the prestigious Tripos examinations. A Tripos refers to the examinations that would qualify a student to gain a bachelor\u2019s degree \u2013 initially the only way to obtain one was to complete a mathematics Tripos. Woodhead did exactly that, gaining the equivalent to a first-class honours in the subject. To say she was a trailblazer would be accurate.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. The 25 best books by women Show all 25 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. The 25 best books by women 1/25 Pride and Prejudice \u2013 Jane Austen Austen remains one of history\u2019s greatest masters in two tricky literary fields: the world of romance and the world of social satire. Pride and Prejudice, then, sees her at the peak of her powers. Through the eyes of Elizabeth Bennet, her sharp-witted protagonist, we witness upper-class Regency England as both a dream and a farce. Not all is as it seems, and society betrays its holloweness when it deems that money should trump love. 2/25 Their Eyes Were Watching God - Zora Neale Hurston Despite the fact that Hurston was a key figure in the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, Their Eyes Were Watching God was largely rejected by her peers. It was during the 1970s and 1980s that her novel was essentially rediscovered, with many contemporary black feminists heralding the genius of her work. The novel focuses on Janie Crawford, a black woman who refuses to give in to bitterness or sorrow, as she navigates three marriages and a life marked by poverty. It\u2019s a story bursting with passion and soulfulness. 3/25 The Lottery and Other Stories \u2013 Shirley Jackson Jackson probed the darkest corners of the American psyche during the 1940s and 1950s, all thanks to her collections of ghost stories, including 1959\u2019s The Haunting of Hill House, which was recently adapted into a Netflix series. With several novels and over 200 short stories for readers to get lost in, there are very few horror writers like her. That\u2019s especially true when it comes to (arguably) her greatest work, 1948\u2019s The Lottery, which traces a small town\u2019s annual tradition to its sinister conclusion. 4/25 To Kill a Mockingbird \u2013 Harper Lee A Pulitzer Prize winner, To Kill a Mockingbird has carved its place in history. Its depiction of racial injustice in the American Deep South was startling frank for the 1960s, in a way that undeniably had a social impact at the time \u2013 it became an instant sensation and is now widely taught in American schools. Lee writes about the world\u2019s cruelties with an honesty and compassion that still resonates, with the character of Atticus Finch becoming a enduring model of integrity for the legal profession. 5/25 Kindred - Octavia E Butler Butler was a key figure in sci-fi history, expanding the boundaries of what the genre could achieve and what it could come to represent. First published in 1979, the book still feels as fresh as ever in its first-person account of a young black writer, Dana, who through strange circumstances, finds herself travelling between her own reality and a pre-Civil War Maryland plantation. It\u2019s through this unusual theme that Butler can explore the lasting trauma of America\u2019s history on African-Americans today. 6/25 Jane Eyre \u2013 Charlotte Bront\u00eb Jane Eyre feels, in many ways, thoroughly modern today. Although originally published under the pen name \u201cCurrer Bell\u201d, it feels likes a dive into the mind of Bront\u00eb herself. The story is told through a first-person narrative that feels so psychologically intimate, it\u2019s as if she\u2019s sharing the secrets of her own world with us. We follow Jane through her school years, all the way to her later employment by Mr Rochester, a tortured soul who she falls madly in love with, with many aspects of her journey reflecting elements of Bront\u00eb\u2019s own life. 7/25 Half of a Yellow Sun \u2013 Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie Adichie, who was born in Nigeria, is considered one of the most original literary voices of her generation. You can see why this is when reading Half of a Yellow Sun, which depicts the brutality of the Nigerian Civil War of the late 1960s, as seen through four different perspectives: twin daughters of a wealthy businessman, a British citizen, a professor, and a houseboy. It\u2019s history via an achingly human lens. 8/25 White Teeth \u2013 Zadie Smith Smith remains a modern titan of the British literary scene, thanks partially to White Teeth, which is considered one of the most sensational fiction debuts of all time, becoming an immediate bestseller and sweeping up multiple awards. It\u2019s a tale of two men \u2013 Bangladeshi Samad Iqbal and Englishman Archie Jones \u2013 who become friends after being stationed together during WWII. Their return to London sees the book examine British post-war attitudes to those from formerly colonised countries, although Smith ensures the subject is approached with both heart and a sense of humour. 9/25 The Hour of the Star - Clarice Lispector Lispector was a literary innovator. The Hour of the Star, published posthumously in 1977, invents a narrator named Rodrigo SM, who in turns tells the story of Macab\u00e9a, a poor young woman who hails from Alagoas, where Lispector\u2019s family first settled when they immigrated to Brazil. However, the way Rodrigo perceives Macab\u00e9a, and reckons with her story, itself creates a dialogue between the two characters, calling into question notions of identity and authorship. 10/25 Mrs Dalloway \u2013 Virginia Woolf One of literature\u2019s sharpest minds and inspiration to the feminist movement in the 1970s, Woolf not only helped pioneer the use of the stream of consciousness as a narrative device, but utilised it to speak openly about sexuality, mental illness, and gender roles. The novel largely follows the inner thoughts of two characters, Clarissa Dalloway and Septimus Smith, one a high-society woman in post-WWI England and the other a veteran suffering from shell shock. 11/25 A Good Man Is Hard to Find and Other Stories \u2013 Flannery O\u2019Connor O\u2019Connor wrote hard stories for a hard world. Her unsentimental, sardonic use of the Southern Gothic style helped weave her own take on the parable, in which the morally weak often face violent, painful punishment for their misdeeds. That said, the door is always open for transformation and spiritual awakening by the story\u2019s conclusion, with her work frequently confronting ideas of morality and ethics through the lens of her own Catholic faith. 12/25 Persepolis \u2013 Marjane Satrapi At times, it seems less like Persepolis is a story. Satrapi\u2019s graphic novel, published in two volumes in 2000 and 2004, feels more like an invitation, as she takes our hand and leads us through her childhood and early adult years, so that we can see through the eyes of a curious, funny, smart young girl who must face the personal repercussions of war and religious extremism in Iran during and after the Islamic Revolution. It\u2019s the political seen through the personal, but it\u2019s always Satrapi\u2019s own spirit that shines the brightest. 13/25 Frankenstein \u2013 Mary Shelley Many have now come to consider Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein as the first pure work of science-fiction, with a central narrative driven a character\u2019s exploration of a world beyond what we already know. Not only is it significant for its later influence on culture, but Shelley\u2019s work, initially published anonymously, is astonishing in both its emotional vitality and its philosophical implications. It\u2019s a work where we both feel the anguish of the misunderstood, while also reckoning with the concept of man\u2019s unbridled power. 14/25 Beloved \u2013 Toni Morrison Beloved takes its inspiration from the true story of Margaret Garner, who escaped slavery in Kentucky in 1856 and fled to Ohio, a free state. However, the story itself focuses on a protagonist named Sethe, a former slave, whose home is haunted by a malevolent presence that she believes is her eldest daughter. It\u2019s through this vivid sense of magical realism that Morrison can confront the unfathomable trauma that slavery has inflicted on the African-American collective memory. 15/25 The Handmaid\u2019s Tale \u2013 Margaret Atwood Although the book has received increased attention thanks to Hulu\u2019s critically acclaimed TV adaptation, it\u2019s all thanks to the fierceness of Atwood\u2019s critical analysis of gender politics. Her 1985 book, which imagines a near-future New England controlled by a totalitarian state, in which women are completely subjugated to men, has only become increasingly relevant \u2013 and prescient. Her work provides a continued reminder that it doesn\u2019t take much for our world to slip into complete dystopia. 16/25 Middlemarch - George Eliot Mary Anne Evans, amongst other concerns, feared that her work, Middlemarch, would be dismissed entirely due to the notion that women\u2019s writing was strictly light and romantic. And so, instead, it was published in eight instalments across 1871 and 1872 under the name George Eliot. The book is far from light; set in the fictitious Midlands town of Middlemarch, it follows a vast, sweeping narrative that encompasses subjects of religion, idealism, and political reform. 17/25 Little Fires Everywhere \u2013 Celeste Ng Ng writes about American suburbia with an astounding clarity, perhaps partially because she considers the act of writing about one\u2019s hometown as a little like \u201cwriting about a relative\u201d, with an attachment that perceives both their greatest attributes and their flaws. Little Fires Everywhere is her second novel to take place in Shaker Heights, Ohio, where she grew up, and focuses on a new arrival to the town, who sense of mystery disrupts its residents\u2019s obsession with structure and rules. 18/25 The Bell Jar \u2013 Sylvia Plath Famous for its popularity with teenage girls, Plath\u2019s work speaks to clearly to an adolescent precisely because it makes no attempt to sugar-coat the prospect of the entrance into adulthood. The book\u2019s protagonist, Esther, a young woman attempting to establish herself in New York, feels more like a front for Plath to discuss her own experiences of struggling with mental health, especially in the context of the 1950s, when women\u2019s concerns were so rarely paid attention to. There is an honesty to Esther\u2019s frustration that has been a comfort to many. 19/25 My Brilliant Friend - Elena Ferrante My Brilliant Friend is only one part of Ferrante\u2019s four-book series, known as the Neapolitan Novels. As the first chapter, it is, de facto, the most well known of the series, but it\u2019s also an invitation to such raw intimacy that readers will be unable to resist delving into the rest. Ferrante serves as a pseudonym, allowing the books to illuminate with candor the friendship between two women, born in Naples in 1944, who try to find peace in a world of violence and misogyny. 20/25 The Age of Innocence \u2013 Edith Wharton Edith Wharton captures with vigour both the opulence and the suffocating claustrophobia of New York\u2019s Gilded Age, as two future newlyweds \u2013 in every other way society\u2019s perfect vision of man and woman \u2013 find their union disrupted by the arrival of a cousin shrouded in scandal. The Age of Innocence is a wistful, romantic novel that still succeeds in treating society\u2019s hypocrisy with an acute sense of disdain. 21/25 The Color Purple \u2013 Alice Walker Marking a rare mastery of the epistolary novel, The Color Purple focuses on the experiences of black women living in the US South during the 1930s. Although it deals with themes of abuse and violence, the honesty in Walker\u2019s voice is disarming in a way that opens us up to her protagonist\u2019s journey towards self-realisation and personal freedom. It\u2019s no wonder that the book\u2019s continued relevance saw it both adapted into 1985 film, directed by Steven Spielberg, and a Broadway musical. 22/25 Rebecca \u2013 Daphne du Maurier Rebecca remains one the finest examples of Gothic literature, despite the fact that du Maurier wasn\u2019t writing within the confines of some drafty Victorian castle; rather, she was examining the world of spirits during the interwar period. In its story of a woman whose whirlwind courtship with a widower turns sour when she becomes haunted by the lingering presence of her husband\u2019s first wife, Rebecca is a book filled with suppressed desires, loss, and a looming sense of threat. 23/25 The God of Small Things - Arundhati Roy As Roy\u2019s debut novel, it\u2019s an extraordinary first outing. Roy contrasts the innocence of childhood, as seen in the book\u2019s protagonists, fraternal twins Rahel and Estha, with the rising political turmoil in Kerala during 1969. It also features a non-sequential approach to narrative, with the novel intricately weaving between the twins\u2019s reunion in 1993 and the lengthy flashback and sidetracks, all painted with a massive sense of scope and imagination. 24/25 Murder on the Orient Express - Agatha Christie We may know every twist and turn of Christie\u2019s best works by now, but there\u2019s still a frisson to how intricately and confidently she pulls the rug from underneath readers. Murder on the Orient Express still feels like her most enthralling work, as famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot finds himself in the midst of a murder scene, after his train is blocked by the heavy snowfall and a passenger is found dead, making the rest of those on board all instant suspects. 25/25 The Tale of Genji \u2013 Murasaki Shikibu The oldest book on this list, this classic of Japanese literature was written by Shikibu, a noblewoman and lady-in-waiting, in the early 11th century. Although the original manuscript no longer exists, what\u2019s been passed down to us now was translated initially into modern Japanese, with English translations being published at a later time. An account of the life Hikaru Genji, the son of the emperor, it\u2019s a masterful work of psychological portraiture, which offers a rare glimpse into the cultural customs of post-classical Japan. 1/25 Pride and Prejudice \u2013 Jane Austen Austen remains one of history\u2019s greatest masters in two tricky literary fields: the world of romance and the world of social satire. Pride and Prejudice, then, sees her at the peak of her powers. Through the eyes of Elizabeth Bennet, her sharp-witted protagonist, we witness upper-class Regency England as both a dream and a farce. Not all is as it seems, and society betrays its holloweness when it deems that money should trump love. 2/25 Their Eyes Were Watching God - Zora Neale Hurston Despite the fact that Hurston was a key figure in the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, Their Eyes Were Watching God was largely rejected by her peers.

The novel focuses on Janie Crawford, a black woman who refuses to give in to bitterness or sorrow, as she navigates three marriages and a life marked by poverty. It\u2019s a story bursting with passion and soulfulness. 3/25 The Lottery and Other Stories \u2013 Shirley Jackson Jackson probed the darkest corners of the American psyche during the 1940s and 1950s, all thanks to her collections of ghost stories, including 1959\u2019s The Haunting of Hill House, which was recently adapted into a Netflix series. With several novels and over 200 short stories for readers to get lost in, there are very few horror writers like her. That\u2019s especially true when it comes to (arguably) her greatest work, 1948\u2019s The Lottery, which traces a small town\u2019s annual tradition to its sinister conclusion. 4/25 To Kill a Mockingbird \u2013 Harper Lee A Pulitzer Prize winner, To Kill a Mockingbird has carved its place in history. Its depiction of racial injustice in the American Deep South was startling frank for the 1960s, in a way that undeniably had a social impact at the time \u2013 it became an instant sensation and is now widely taught in American schools. Lee writes about the world\u2019s cruelties with an honesty and compassion that still resonates, with the character of Atticus Finch becoming a enduring model of integrity for the legal profession. 5/25 Kindred - Octavia E Butler Butler was a key figure in sci-fi history, expanding the boundaries of what the genre could achieve and what it could come to represent. First published in 1979, the book still feels as fresh as ever in its first-person account of a young black writer, Dana, who through strange circumstances, finds herself travelling between her own reality and a pre-Civil War Maryland plantation. It\u2019s through this unusual theme that Butler can explore the lasting trauma of America\u2019s history on African-Americans today. 6/25 Jane Eyre \u2013 Charlotte Bront\u00eb Jane Eyre feels, in many ways, thoroughly modern today. Although originally published under the pen name \u201cCurrer Bell\u201d, it feels likes a dive into the mind of Bront\u00eb herself. The story is told through a first-person narrative that feels so psychologically intimate, it\u2019s as if she\u2019s sharing the secrets of her own world with us. We follow Jane through her school years, all the way to her later employment by Mr Rochester, a tortured soul who she falls madly in love with, with many aspects of her journey reflecting elements of Bront\u00eb\u2019s own life. 7/25 Half of a Yellow Sun \u2013 Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie Adichie, who was born in Nigeria, is considered one of the most original literary voices of her generation. You can see why this is when reading Half of a Yellow Sun, which depicts the brutality of the Nigerian Civil War of the late 1960s, as seen through four different perspectives: twin daughters of a wealthy businessman, a British citizen, a professor, and a houseboy. It\u2019s history via an achingly human lens. 8/25 White Teeth \u2013 Zadie Smith Smith remains a modern titan of the British literary scene, thanks partially to White Teeth, which is considered one of the most sensational fiction debuts of all time, becoming an immediate bestseller and sweeping up multiple awards. It\u2019s a tale of two men \u2013 Bangladeshi Samad Iqbal and Englishman Archie Jones \u2013 who become friends after being stationed together during WWII. Their return to London sees the book examine British post-war attitudes to those from formerly colonised countries, although Smith ensures the subject is approached with both heart and a sense of humour. 9/25 The Hour of the Star - Clarice Lispector Lispector was a literary innovator. The Hour of the Star, published posthumously in 1977, invents a narrator named Rodrigo SM, who in turns tells the story of Macab\u00e9a, a poor young woman who hails from Alagoas, where Lispector\u2019s family first settled when they immigrated to Brazil.

The novel largely follows the inner thoughts of two characters, Clarissa Dalloway and Septimus Smith, one a high-society woman in post-WWI England and the other a veteran suffering from shell shock. 11/25 A Good Man Is Hard to Find and Other Stories \u2013 Flannery O\u2019Connor O\u2019Connor wrote hard stories for a hard world. Her unsentimental, sardonic use of the Southern Gothic style helped weave her own take on the parable, in which the morally weak often face violent, painful punishment for their misdeeds. That said, the door is always open for transformation and spiritual awakening by the story\u2019s conclusion, with her work frequently confronting ideas of morality and ethics through the lens of her own Catholic faith. 12/25 Persepolis \u2013 Marjane Satrapi At times, it seems less like Persepolis is a story. Satrapi\u2019s graphic novel, published in two volumes in 2000 and 2004, feels more like an invitation, as she takes our hand and leads us through her childhood and early adult years, so that we can see through the eyes of a curious, funny, smart young girl who must face the personal repercussions of war and religious extremism in Iran during and after the Islamic Revolution. It\u2019s the political seen through the personal, but it\u2019s always Satrapi\u2019s own spirit that shines the brightest. 13/25 Frankenstein \u2013 Mary Shelley Many have now come to consider Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein as the first pure work of science-fiction, with a central narrative driven a character\u2019s exploration of a world beyond what we already know. Not only is it significant for its later influence on culture, but Shelley\u2019s work, initially published anonymously, is astonishing in both its emotional vitality and its philosophical implications. It\u2019s a work where we both feel the anguish of the misunderstood, while also reckoning with the concept of man\u2019s unbridled power. 14/25 Beloved \u2013 Toni Morrison Beloved takes its inspiration from the true story of Margaret Garner, who escaped slavery in Kentucky in 1856 and fled to Ohio, a free state. However, the story itself focuses on a protagonist named Sethe, a former slave, whose home is haunted by a malevolent presence that she believes is her eldest daughter.

The book\u2019s protagonist, Esther, a young woman attempting to establish herself in New York, feels more like a front for Plath to discuss her own experiences of struggling with mental health, especially in the context of the 1950s, when women\u2019s concerns were so rarely paid attention to. There is an honesty to Esther\u2019s frustration that has been a comfort to many. 19/25 My Brilliant Friend - Elena Ferrante My Brilliant Friend is only one part of Ferrante\u2019s four-book series, known as the Neapolitan Novels. As the first chapter, it is, de facto, the most well known of the series, but it\u2019s also an invitation to such raw intimacy that readers will be unable to resist delving into the rest. Ferrante serves as a pseudonym, allowing the books to illuminate with candor the friendship between two women, born in Naples in 1944, who try to find peace in a world of violence and misogyny. 20/25 The Age of Innocence \u2013 Edith Wharton Edith Wharton captures with vigour both the opulence and the suffocating claustrophobia of New York\u2019s Gilded Age, as two future newlyweds \u2013 in every other way society\u2019s perfect vision of man and woman \u2013 find their union disrupted by the arrival of a cousin shrouded in scandal. The Age of Innocence is a wistful, romantic novel that still succeeds in treating society\u2019s hypocrisy with an acute sense of disdain. 21/25 The Color Purple \u2013 Alice Walker Marking a rare mastery of the epistolary novel, The Color Purple focuses on the experiences of black women living in the US South during the 1930s. Although it deals with themes of abuse and violence, the honesty in Walker\u2019s voice is disarming in a way that opens us up to her protagonist\u2019s journey towards self-realisation and personal freedom. It\u2019s no wonder that the book\u2019s continued relevance saw it both adapted into 1985 film, directed by Steven Spielberg, and a Broadway musical. 22/25 Rebecca \u2013 Daphne du Maurier Rebecca remains one the finest examples of Gothic literature, despite the fact that du Maurier wasn\u2019t writing within the confines of some drafty Victorian castle; rather, she was examining the world of spirits during the interwar period.

Roy contrasts the innocence of childhood, as seen in the book\u2019s protagonists, fraternal twins Rahel and Estha, with the rising political turmoil in Kerala during 1969. It also features a non-sequential approach to narrative, with the novel intricately weaving between the twins\u2019s reunion in 1993 and the lengthy flashback and sidetracks, all painted with a massive sense of scope and imagination. 24/25 Murder on the Orient Express - Agatha Christie We may know every twist and turn of Christie\u2019s best works by now, but there\u2019s still a frisson to how intricately and confidently she pulls the rug from underneath readers.

Although the original manuscript no longer exists, what\u2019s been passed down to us now was translated initially into modern Japanese, with English translations being published at a later time. An account of the life Hikaru Genji, the son of the emperor, it\u2019s a masterful work of psychological portraiture, which offers a rare glimpse into the cultural customs of post-classical Japan.\n\nWoodhead, Lumsden and Rachel Scott (1848-1905) became the first three to complete a Cambridge Tripos at the same level as their male counterparts. At a time when women were seen as intellectually inferior to men, such academic achievements were unprecedented. The three became known as the \u201cGirton Pioneers\u201d. Between 1869 and 1900 there were as many as 10 different subjects in which at least one student had passed Tripos examinations. This was of particular significance \u2013 women were able to take the same subjects as men, even if they were still unable to officially get a degree.\n\n\u201cThe insistence of Emily Davies [one of the founders of Girton] that women should study the same subjects as men was an important principle,\u201d says June Purvis, an emeritus professor of women\u2019s and gender history at the University of Portsmouth. \u201cCreating \u2018separate\u2019 and \u2018different\u2019 education for women could always be seen as second-rate. Also, by not studying the same subjects as men, they would not be able to compete for a professional career. The founding principle of Girton was that different education can never be the same as equal education.\u201d\n\nThe insistence of Emily Davies that women should study the same subjects as men was an important principle. The founding principle of Girton was that different education can never be the same as equal education June Purvis, emeritus professor\n\nThe college was established following a tiresome joint effort from aforementioned suffragist Emily Davies (1830-1921) and Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon (1827-1891). Inspired by the same goal, their aim was to create an institution in Cambridge that allowed women to study full-time at degree level, just like the opportunities that were given to men. Before managing to secure \u00a37,000 in funding in 1871, the college was originally based in Hitchin, Hertfordshire. The location was strategic \u2013 it was still close as to make clear that the founders were gunning for female participation, but not so close as to scare the male chauvinists who feared women \u201ctainting\u201d the good masculine name of Cambridge.\n\nBoth women were heavyweights in the fight for female emancipation. Bodichon was the daughter of radical politician Benjamin Leigh Smith (1783-1860), a son of radical abolitionist William Smith. From a young age she was exposed to the world of radicals and political campaigners, so the transition into feminist pioneer was natural. Davies came from a humbler background as the daughter of an evangelical clergyman. She was drawn to the fight after spending time with the Ladies of Langham Place, a social group that Bodichon frequented often to discuss women\u2019s rights.\n\nEven before Girton, these women had made considerable waves to advance women\u2019s position in society. Bodichon established the first ever Women\u2019s Suffrage Committee in 1866, which was a precursor to the movement spearheaded by the Pankhursts and many other female activists. She also worked tirelessly to challenge stringent divorce laws, campaigned for greater working rights and helped develop the English Woman\u2019s Journal.\n\nDavies, on the other hand, built her activism around learning. \u201cEducation was a constant struggle for her,\u201d says Susan Smith. \u201cShe forged on in the wake of opposition and simply wouldn\u2019t compromise. She wasn\u2019t just about lectures for ladies. Formal education had to be on the same terms as men.\u201d Whether this was taking the same examinations or accessing the same curriculum, educational equality was something Davies pursued doggedly.\n\nShe forged on in the wake of opposition and simply wouldn\u2019t compromise. She wasn\u2019t just about lectures for ladies. Formal education had to be on the same terms as men Susan Smith, Girton mistress\n\nHer work on the London School Board and in the Schools Inquiry Commission was instrumental in obtaining the admission of girls into local secondary school examinations, something which transitioned further into fighting at degree level.\n\nBodichon and Davies met through the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women, an organisation set up by the former alongside Jessie Boucherett and Adelaide Anne Proctor. Together, they lamented that they could not go to Cambridge and set out to do something about it. Their start came in 1865 when Cambridge officially opened local examinations to girls. Why should this not extend to obtaining degrees?\n\nThe long, slow journey for greater education continued. By 1871, land had been acquired and the college moved to the village of Girton where it stands today. Costing \u00a312,000, the college finally had a home and has earned its position as a pivotal part of women\u2019s education.\n\nThe push for access to Oxbridge institutions was largely spearheaded by women from the middle and upper classes, who were concerned about future economic struggles. \u201cThe push for women to get into universities was intimately linked with their desire to earn a living,\u201d Carol Dyhouse, an emeritus professor and social historian from the University of Sussex, tells me. \u201cIronically, industrialisation gave working-class women more professional \u2013 although often exploitative \u2013 work opportunities.\u201d\n\nBy the 1840s, many young middle-class women found themselves unmarried and needing to earn a living. An 1851 census found that 26 per cent (nearly three million) of women over the age of 25 were unmarried; by 1871 this figure had risen to more than three million. This demographic became known as \u201csurplus women\u201d and suffered from the stifling effect that traditional Victorian gender roles caused.\n\nWomen were not deemed marriageable if they tried to find work. It would not be wrong to say that they were essentially trapped.\n\n\u201cApart from the poorly paid overstocked job of being a governess, the range of occupations opened to them was very limited,\u201d says Purvis. \u201cMany were motivated by the desire to learn and to enter other professions, but their education, which put emphasis on social priorities, prevented this.\u201d\n\nTeaching at schools and institutions became a particular area of campaigning for women, but in order to get the same opportunities as men, they had to pursue a more formal education. \u201cWomen in the 19th century were very much second-class citizens,\u201d says Purvis \u2013 and it was essential that women proved they were not just going to sit in the background.\n\nThe path to gaining higher education was plagued by obstacles. \u201cThere was a prevailing separate spheres ideology that caused significant resistance to women entering university,\u201d Purvis says. It was expected that middle-class women should remain \u201cladylike homemakers\u201d and stay as \u201ccreatures who were relative to men rather than individual beings in their own right\u201d. This pervasive notion, of women as simply domestic homemakers had an oppressive effect upon nearly every facet of Victorian society. The fight for education was a severe blow to this deeply rooted ideology, and thus faced resistance at nearly every opportunity.\n\n\u201cIt was a common belief that an educated woman would not be able to manage a household or have knowledge, as one commentator put it, about \u2018pies and puddings\u2019,\u201d Purvis continues. \u201cThere were some who argued that the energy spent studying would shrink women\u2019s breasts so that they would be unable to breastfeed a baby, even if they were lucky enough to catch a husband.\u201d\n\nWomen who dared seek an education were vilified and often had to make significant sacrifices to their social reputation. The derogatory term \u201cbluestocking\u201d entered the cultural vocabulary and was used to disparage intellectual women. They were depicted as \u201cfrumpy\u201d and not beautiful enough to be graced with a husband.\n\nThose who found themselves at Girton \u2013 or at any of the other institutions that were slowly allowing women in \u2013 also found that their experiences were vastly different to their male counterparts. The idea of universities as places where you could let off steam or engage in activities that could be called hedonistic was different in reality.\n\n\u201cSlight deviations from good behaviour could blow up into nasty affairs,\u201d Dyhouse says. \u201cTowards the end of the century there were many scandals when women didn\u2019t behave in the modest and constrained way they had been burdened with in Victorian society.\u201d\n\nWomen were chaperoned to lectures that were taught by men and were forced to adhere to strict regulations about how they could socialise with men. Davies was particularly aware of the scrutiny that Girton was under and sought to control outside opinion at all costs. Dancing into the early hours of the morning wasn\u2019t an option for the first Girton students. \u201cIf a student showed herself to be a \u2018women of the world\u2019 she was out on her ear because of the double standard within education,\u201d Dyhouse says.\n\nThere were some who argued that the energy spent studying would shrink women\u2019s breasts so that they would be unable to breastfeed a baby, even if they were lucky enough to catch a husband June Purvis\n\nHowever, for all of Girton\u2019s pioneering, Purvis asserts that \u201cuniversities were still strongholds of masculine privilege\u201d in England. Despite fierce campaigning, Oxford and Cambridge dug their heels in and refused to award women the same degrees as men. Female students were only granted this right at Cambridge in 1947 \u2013 nearly eight decades after Girton opened its doors.\n\nOxford did however relent earlier in 1920, and women were allowed to officially be matriculated and graduate. However, they were only granted this because Oxford believed that Cambridge would do the same. What followed was an institution that desperately tried to backpedal out of fear of being viewed as less masculine \u2013 and therefore less prestigious. Oxford ended up voting in favour of a statute that limited the quota of women students.\n\nThe subject of degrees at Cambridge was debated fiercely, and \u201cevery time women pushed to have full entitlement to degrees, there were terrible scenes\u201d, Dyhouse explains. The most notorious incident occurred in 1897 after a motion for full membership was defeated with 1051 against it. In scenes that would shock feminists today, male chauvinists, elated by success, took to the city\u2019s Market Street with an effigy of an aforementioned \u201cbluestocking\u201d. After hearing the result, they mutilated and burnt the effigy.\n\nOther universities also capitulated way before Cambridge did: the University of London in 1878, Durham University in 1895 and the Scottish universities in 1892 all offered degrees.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the original site of Girton was chosen by Davies and Bodichon as it carried less risk and was less likely to cause controversy. \u201cIn a sense [campaigners] were originally hedging their bets because they didn\u2019t actually know whether they would gain access to Cambridge,\u201d Smith points out. \u201cThey were pushing on all the doors and it was ultimately a question of which door would open first.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, in 150 years of standing, more than 15,000 students have walked through the doors of Girton College. Notable alumni include Arianna Huffington, co-founder of The Huffington Post; and Margrethe II, the queen of Denmark. What started out as a notion that women should receive an education equal to men proved that a powerful idea can change what people thought was possible.\n\nThe education we have the privilege of accessing today would not exist without the relentless effort of women in the 19th century, who fought doggedly and often at great sacrifice. The legacy of Girton, which proved that women were every bit as intelligent as men, will be remembered.\n\n\u201cGirton put the idea of a women\u2019s college into popular imagination,\u201d Dyhouse asserts. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just a pioneer for opening up opportunities for women, it was actually an important move to change what people thought was possible in a culture. In building Girton, it gave weight to that image in the cultural imagination.\u201d", "description": "On 16 October 1869, the doors of Girton College, Cambridge, opened wide for the first time.
