But the protesters who have been out in force for 17 straight weeks in Hong Kong had other ideas.\n\nIn an ominous first during the weeks of civil unrest, a protester in Tseun Wan in the Western New Territories was shot in the chest by police, according to The South China Morning Post.\n\nVideo on local media shows a young man, blood on his chest, dressed in black with goggles and helmet. He's slumped on the ground complaining of chest pain and asking to be taken to a hospital. Another video circulated on social media purports to show the protester being shot by police at close range.\n\nThe hospital authority of Hong Kong confirmed to NPR that a male protester was hospitalized and is in critical condition. Police say they are trying to confirm local media reports that the man was hit in the chest with a live round.\n\nOne of the protesters' key demands has been for an independent investigation into police handling of the protests, where demonstrators have been subjected to what they call excessive force. The apparent shooting is likely to further inflame tensions.\n\nEarlier, in Kowloon, the peninsular part of Hong Kong that adjoins mainland China, police also used live ammunition for warning shots to ward off protesters.\n\nPeaceful demonstrators on the main Hong Kong island devolved into confrontations with police, who fired tear gas in hopes of subduing the crowd.\n\nRounds of tear gas are fired at Hennessy Road in Wan Chai. Protesters have set fire to a tram stop\n\n\n\nVideo: SCMP/Chris Lau pic.twitter.com/a9wFQCQiTR \u2014 SCMP Hong Kong (@SCMPHongKong) October 1, 2019\n\nIn an apparent effort to restrict the movement of protesters, authorities shut down nearly 20 subway stations, a vital transit link in the sprawling territory.\n\nEarlier in the day, Hong Kong officials assembled at the Convention and Exhibition Centre in Wan Chai to witness a flag-raising ceremony meant to show fealty to China. But Lam, was not present. Instead, she sat with dignitaries at the military parade in Beijing.\n\nAlthough the protests have been largely sustained by young, university-aged activists, many of the largest peaceful demonstrations in recent months \u2013 some that drew hundreds of thousands of people \u2013 have shown that a cross-section of Hong Kong people support the call for greater freedoms.\n\n\"They are squeezing our necks so we don't breathe the air of freedom,\" King Chan, a 57-year-old homemaker who came out to protest with her husband, told The Associated Press.\n\n\"If the people of Hong Kong win against dictatorship then it's also a lesson for the world,\" former Hong Kong lawmaker Lee Cheuk Yan told NPR. \"You know people think the regime is so powerful that it's impossible, but we can do the impossible if we continue to fight.\"", "description": "In an ominous first during weeks of protests, a demonstrator was shot in the chest, according to local media.
