The only difference was the timing of the food intake.\u201d\n\nThe researchers suggest that this effect may be down to insulin levels first thing in the morning - when people have fasted overnight, their insulin levels are low meaning they can use more fat as a fuel.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nHowever, the researchers note that this effect has only been tested in men, and further studies including women are needed to verify the findings.\n\nDr Gareth Wallis, co-author of the study, said: \u201cThis work suggests that performing exercise in the overnight-fasted state can increase the health benefits of exercise for individuals, without changing the intensity, duration or perception of their effort.\n\n\u201cWe now need to explore the longer-term effects of this type of exercise and whether women benefit in the same way as men.\"", "description": "Researchers from the Universities of Bath and Birmingham have revealed that exercising before breakfast can help you to burn more fat", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20649101.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Sportswoman-during-jogging-in-the-morning.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
