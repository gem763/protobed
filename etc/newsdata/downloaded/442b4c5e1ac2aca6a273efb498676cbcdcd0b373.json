They forced me to take off my clothes [and] held a knife to my neck,\u201d said one of the men.\n\n\u201cThen they forced me to squat with my fingers on my knees\u2026 They told me if I moved they would cut off my fingers\u2026 They put a grenade in my mouth\u2026 I was afraid if I moved it would explode.\u201d\n\nCivilian witnesses told Amnesty that the military\u2019s notorious 99th Light Infantry Division were involved in many violations.\n\nThe battle-hardened counter-insurgency force has a reputation for ruthlessness and its units were implicated in some of the worst atrocities that drove over 700,000 Rohingya across the border into Bangladesh, where they now languish in squalid refugee camps.\n\nThe report also accuses ethnic armed groups of \u201cheinous abuses\u201d including abduction and forced labour. Thousands of civilians have been forced to flee their homes over the last year as fighting moves closer to villages, it said.\n\nThe Myanmar government did not respond to a request for comment.", "description": "The Myanmar military is continuing to wage fresh atrocities against ethnic minorities in the conflict-riven north of the country, according to a new report by human rights group Amnesty International.", "authors": ["Nicola Smith", "Asia Correspondent", "Rupert Christiansen", "Allister Heath"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/23/TELEMMGLPICT000161761885-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
