The woman, identified as Erramatti Mangayamma, and her husband, 80-year-old Rajarao, hail from a small Indian village in the Eastern Godavari district, SWNS reported.\n\nThe couple welcomed two girls after undergoing one round of IVF in January, her doctor claims, ending their 60-year wait to be parents. Mangayamma\u2019s alleged feat surpasses that of 70-year-old Daljinder Kaur, who previously held the record for oldest recorded age at birth, SWNS reported.\n\nBABY BORN 117 DAYS AFTER MOM WAS DECLARED BRAIN DEAD\n\nThe couple\u2019s daughters were born via C-section, with doctors reporting no complications.\n\n\u201cIt was smooth, as there were no health complications,\u201d Dr. Umasankar, of the Ahalya Hospital, told SWNS. \u201cEach baby is weighing approximately 2 kgs (4.4 pounds) and both babies are healthy.\u201d\n\nMangayamma\u2019s doctor does not predict any major issues for his patient.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think she will have any major health issues in the post-delivery period,\u201d he told SWNS.\n\nThis spring, a 61-year-old woman from Nebraska made headlines when she gave birth to her own granddaughter through IVF after acting as a surrogate for her son and his husband. Cecile Eledge had acted as a surrogate for Matthew Eledge and Elliot Dougherty, using a donated egg from Doughtery\u2019s sister and Eledge\u2019s sperm.\n\nShe gave birth to a healthy baby girl named Uma Louise Dougherty-Eledge in March. At the time, her doctor said age was not a factor due to her outstanding health.\n\n'EXTREME' GROOMING, STD LINK IS UNFOUNDED, RESEARCHERS CLAIM\n\n\u201cShe has the body of a 40-year-old and is actually in better shape than some 20-year-olds,\u201d Dr. Carolyn Maud Doherty, the family\u2019s reproductive endocrinologist, told PEOPLE at the time. \u201cI\u2019m pretty conservative about these sorts of things but Cecile really turned out to be their best option. She\u2019s genetically blessed.\u201d", "description": "The title was previously held by a 70-year-old woman.", "authors": ["Alexandria Hein"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/miracle-mum-wor-406718.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
