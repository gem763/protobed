It comes after a separate legal action was launched by the duchess against the Mail on Sunday for alleged breach of privacy and copyright infringement over the newspaper\u2019s decision to publish a private letter she sent to her estranged father.\n\nIt is not known precisely which period the alleged hacking relates to, although it is likely to be historical. It is understood there is a six-year limit on claims, which begins when the claimant first learns about the offence.\n\nA source with knowledge of the case said it was part of the round of phone-hacking claims being put together by solicitors for this autumn. Newspaper groups will now be required to provide any evidence that indicates Harry could have been a victim.\n\nThe lengthy legal process means any potential trial involving Harry would be unlikely to take place before October 2020. Court listings show he has issued two claims: one against News Group, which published the News of the World until its closure, as well as the Sun; and the second against Mirror Group Newspapers, which owns the Daily Mirror and Sunday Mirror.\n\nExperts said the prince\u2019s attempts to take on elements of Fleet Street risked backfiring.\n\nThe PR specialist Mark Borkowski said Harry was backing himself into a corner with the media. \u201cI think this was a very tactical ploy yesterday,\u201d he said of the latest legal action. \u201cWhat he\u2019s hoping, what he\u2019s demonstrating is, \u2018You want to take me on, mate, I\u2019m a different breed to other people, I\u2019m a fighter, I\u2019m not going to play to any rules and I\u2019m going to come and get you.\u2019\n\n\u201cEither he\u2019s buying time [or] sending a message and trying to frighten newspaper proprietors who are deeply scared of Leveson [the inquiry into press ethics]. It\u2019s a really, really dangerous game. You\u2019re going to make a lot of lawyers rich, they\u2019ll be rubbing their hands from both sides.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a tactic to put the frighteners on people, it\u2019s definitely a tactic to say: \u2018I\u2019m a different type of royal, come for me if you will,\u2019 a different tactic in the sense: \u2018I\u2019m going to protect my wife whatever happens; if you\u2019re going to get a story about me you\u2019re going to have to make sure it\u2019s absolutely robust.\u2019\u201d\n\nIngrid Seward, the editor-in-chief of Majesty magazine and a royal biographer, said: \u201cHarry seems to be conducting an all-out war with some parts of the media, which can be difficult. Even if he wins both cases, which I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll win the phone hacking, I simply don\u2019t understand, why now?\n\n\u201cProbably Harry\u2019s just had enough and he\u2019s not going to sit back and take the flak any more and this is his way of flexing his royal muscles.\u201d\n\nIn his statement released during the royal couple\u2019s tour of South Africa, Harry accused parts of the media of \u201cwaging campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cThough [my] action may not be the safe one, it is the right one \u2026 I\u2019ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u201d\n\nSeward said: \u201cThat was a very personal and angry and inflamed attack. I don\u2019t think it achieved anything apart from detract from the success of their South African tour. That was far too vitriolic and personal. He has the right to compare himself to his mother if he wishes to, but his mother\u2019s situation was very different.\u201d\n\nSeward said she suspected Prince Harry\u2019s stand against the media was being urged by his wife. \u201cAmericans are historically extremely litigious and it\u2019s their way of dealing with things. We do it differently, especially members of the royal family who historically have very seldomly sued because it\u2019s just more attention on them. And it drags up dirty washing.\n\n\u201cHarry is very volatile, he doesn\u2019t always think the consequences of his actions through. So far, certainly in the first instance [in releasing the statement], the consequence of his actions have been very derogatory and negative.\u201d\n\nAsked what her advice would be to the prince in dealing with the press, she said: \u201cI\u2019d say, take a leaf out of his mother\u2019s book and make friends with your enemies. If Diana didn\u2019t like something somebody had written she would get on to them, certainly I\u2019ve experienced that. Then she\u2019d have them round to KP [Kensington Palace] then they\u2019re putty in her hands. But Harry is certainly not going to do that.\u201d\n\nThe costs of dealing with historical phone-hacking claims, many of them relating to stories published 15 years ago when the British tabloid industry was far more popular and financially successful, now weigh heavily on the already struggling finances of publishers of the Sun and the Mirror, as they deal with payouts and lawyers\u2019 fees costing tens of millions of pounds.", "description": "Duke of Sussex\u2019s legal action against Sun and Daily Mirror over alleged phone hacking takes attack on press up a level", "authors": ["Simon Murphy", "Jim Waterson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/112c3acf9acf626c025ef6f4a0fbcbfb79554b09/0_153_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=13ee7afaaab075b82e91caf5f8dfedcb", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
