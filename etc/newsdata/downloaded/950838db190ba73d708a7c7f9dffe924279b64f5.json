REUTERS/Umit Bektas\n\nThe protests in Spain\u2019s wealthiest region of Catalonia bear some resemblances to the demonstrations in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, where millions have taken to the streets for five months to vent their anger over what they see as Beijing\u2019s tightening grip on the city.\n\nMost protesters in Hong Kong want greater democracy, among other demands, although a small minority is calling for independence, a red line for Communist Party leaders in Beijing.\n\n\u201cIt has become more and more clear that it is not a peaceful demonstration in Hong Kong at all, but a violent crime that is mad,\u201d Xie Feng, the Commissioner for the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong, said in a speech on Thursday.\n\n\u201c...The real purpose of the Hong Kong opposition and the foreign forces behind it is to disrupt Hong Kong, overthrow the legitimate government, and seize the power of governance. It is to turn Hong Kong into an independent or semi-independent political entity and subvert \u2018one country, two systems\u2019. This is a delusion. Hong Kong is China\u2019s Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nUnder the terms of the 1997 handover from Britain, Hong Kong was allowed to retain extensive freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula, including an independent judiciary and right to protest.\n\nBut many Hong Kong residents are angry at what they see as a relentless march towards mainland control.\n\nA poster advertising Thursday\u2019s demonstration of solidarity with protesters in Catalonia featured the slogan; \u201cUnited We Stand Against Tyranny\u201d.\n\nOrganizers have called on people to rally from 11:00 GMT at Chater Garden in the heart of the financial center. Their rally is one of the few to have obtained a permit from authorities in recent weeks.\n\nIndependence is a highly divisive issue in Catalonia, which, like Hong Kong, has more than 7 million inhabitants, its own language, parliament and flag.\n\nSome demonstrators waved the Catalan flag at a protest in Hong Kong on Sunday. Students in Catalonia have boycotted classes and protesters have focused on strategic targets to cause maximum disruption, including the airport serving Barcelona - similar to strategies used by Hong Kong activists.\n\nDemonstrators in Catalonia, who protested for nine consecutive nights from Oct. 14, are angry over the conviction of their leaders for sedition and at what they see as attempts to thwart their ambition for greater autonomy from the rest of Spain.\n\nSome Hong Kong protesters went online to urge people not to attend Thursday\u2019s show of support for the Catalan movement, saying it was too provocative and risked denting international support for their own cause.\n\nHong Kong authorities formally banned a group promoting independence from China in September last year, the first time a political organization has been outlawed since the 1997 handover.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s legislature on Wednesday formally withdrew planned legislation that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, a bill that triggered the unrest, but the move was unlikely to end the protests because it met just one of the pro-democracy demonstrators\u2019 five demands, which include universal suffrage.", "description": "Hong Kong protesters plan to rally on Thursday in support of demonstrators pushing for a separate Catalonia in northeastern Spain as a Chinese official denounced months of \"mad violence\" in Hong Kong and forces pushing for independence.", "authors": ["Anne Marie Roantree", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444344486&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N06U", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
