Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) was \u201ca favorite of the Russians\u201d in the 2020 presidential race.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s playing a very dangerous game,\u201d Jones said during a segment on \u201cErin Burnett Out Front\u201d on Friday.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton, if you\u2019re concerned about disinformation \u2015 what the Russians do, is they spread disinformation and get us divided against each other \u2015 that is what just happened. Just throw out some information ... disinformation, smear somebody,\u201d he continued.\n\nJones\u2019 remarks were in response to Clinton\u2019s Thursday appearance on the podcast \u201cCampaign HQ With David Plouffe.\u201d\n\nDuring a conversation about the 2020 election with Plouffe, former senior adviser to Barack Obama, Clinton appeared to single out Gabbard, before unleashing accusations about Jill Stein\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign and Russia. (Stein slammed Clinton\u2019s comments on Twitter.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not making any predictions, but I think they\u2019ve got their eye on somebody who\u2019s currently in the Democratic primary ... and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate,\u201d Clinton said during the interview.\n\nShe continued, \u201cShe\u2019s a favorite of the Russians, they have a bunch of sites and bots and other ways of supporting her so far.\u201d\n\nThough many interpreted Clinton\u2019s \u201cgrooming\u201d comment as referring to the Russians, Clinton spokesperson Nick Merrill said on Twitter on Friday that the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee was referencing the Republican Party.\n\nBefore making her \u201cgrooming\u201d remarks, Clinton and Plouffe were sharing their thoughts on President Donald Trump\u2019s election strategy.\n\nThe former secretary of state did not reference Gabbard by name in that conversation, but when Merrill was asked by NBC News this week to confirm Gabbard was her target, he replied: \u201cIf the nesting doll fits.\u201d\n\nGabbard, who has repeatedly said she would not run as a third-party candidate if she loses the Democratic nomination, fired back at Clinton\u2019s claims in a series of tweets on Friday.\n\nThe presidential hopeful and Iraq War veteran similarly criticized The New York Times on Tuesday\u2019s Ohio debate stage after it reported that Russian news media had frequently mentioned her.\n\nGreat! Thank you @HillaryClinton. You, the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long, have finally come out from behind the curtain. From the day I announced my candidacy, there has been a ... \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 18, 2019\n\nElsewhere in the CNN segment with Burnett, Jones, who referred to Clinton as a\n\n\u201dlegend,\u201d suggested there was a \u201cbackstory\u201d to the Gabbard-Clinton-Russia debacle.\n\nHe pointed to Gabbard\u2019s decision to resign as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee in 2016 to endorse Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) for president.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been payback hell ever since,\u201d Jones charged.\n\nHe later added, \u201cI do not want somebody of her [Clinton\u2019s] stature to legitimate these kind of attacks against anybody \u2015 if you\u2019ve got real evidence, come forward with it, but if you\u2019re just going to smear people casually on podcast, you\u2019re playing right into the Russians\u2019 hands.\u201d\n\nWatch the entire CNN segment here.", "description": "The CNN host said he doesn't want Clinton's comments on Gabbard and Russia to \"legitimate these kind of attacks against anybody.\"", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5dab235b200000f4155062ca.jpeg?cache=5pzumzmmkd&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
