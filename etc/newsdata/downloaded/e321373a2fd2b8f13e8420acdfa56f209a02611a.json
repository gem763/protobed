However, the standout performer was index, which spurted up by more than 2% in today\u2019s trade. The index got a boost from a speech from Road transport and highways union minister Nitin Gadkari, who spoke at the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM).\n\nHe mentioned that the government is looking to cut taxes on hybrid vehicles after it has already announced cuts on electric cars. He also assured that petrol and diesel vehicles will not be banned in the future and even said that the tax rates on these vehicles need to come down.\n\nHis speech provided a shot in the arm to the auto stocks which has been under tremendous pressure over the last few months. Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (NS: ) was up 2.5% while Tata Motors (NS: ) stock jumped by 8% in today\u2019s trade. Despite this relief today, the Nifty Auto index has experienced a steep fall of 36% in the last one year. The main reason for this decline is the extraordinary fall in the sales of automakers. Maruti and Tata Motors recently announced a 33% and 58% decline in their vehicle sales for August on a year-over-year basis. Maruti even announced a two-day no-production at its Manesar and Gurugram plants on 7th and 9th September.\n\nThe government has acknowledged the troubles that the auto industry is finding itself in. A few days back, some relief to the auto sector in the form of lifting the ban on the purchase of new government vehicles to replace old vehicles. She also announced that the BS-IV vehicles bought before March 2020 would be allowed to remain operational for their registration period. However, the auto industry is desperately waiting for some decision from the government in the form of GST rate cuts on vehicles sales.", "description": "Shares Analysis by Investing.com (Puneet Sikka/Investing.com) covering: Nifty 50, Nifty Auto, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd., Tata Motors Ltd.
