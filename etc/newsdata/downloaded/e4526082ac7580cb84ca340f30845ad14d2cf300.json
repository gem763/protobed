Inventor adds a GUN to his Iron Man jet pack that aims where he looks", "language": "en", "text": "This is the action packed moment a British inventor successfully mounts an airsoft gun to a jet pack and sets it to fire in whichever direction he looks.\n\nThe Iron Man-esque jet suit was created by maverick Richard Browning in 2017 and was the first of its kind to be granted a patent earlier this year.\n\nAnd now the wacky inventors at Gravity jet packs have added a new accessory - a shoulder mounted 'head tracking turret' for an airsoft or BB gun.\n\nAlthough Mr Browning has only fitted a harmless toy gun, the set up looks feasible for it to be swapped with a real weapon.\n\nA sensor built into the helmet detects which way the pilot is looking and points the gun in the same direction. Richard Browning wears the suit\n\nThe terrifying addition to the suit was engineered by robotics engineer and former children's toy designer James Bruton, who was approached by Mr Browning's company Gravity.\n\nA sensor built into the helmet detects which way the pilot is looking and points the gun in the same direction - a trigger is located in the left hand.\n\nJames Bruton shared the video with the caption: 'The jet suit guys from Gravity asked me if I could build a head tracking shoulder turret.'\n\nMr Browning (pictured) has only fitted a harmless toy gun, the set up looks feasible for it to be swapped with a real weapon. The pilot fires the gun in the direction he's looking (left)\n\nInventors say they originally intended for the gun to pivot on a two-axis turret that would 'pitch and yaw however they encountered some potentially deadly problems.\n\nMr Bruton said: 'We discovered there were some issues clearance around the pilot's head. This was simplified to a one-axis turret with a heavy duty actuator.'\n\nImmediately after landing Mr Browning says: 'That feels amazing, you can feel the whole suit shake.'\n\nInventor Richard Browning, who has been dubbed 'the real life Iron Man', broke the record for the fastest speed in a body-controlled jet engine power suit\n\nThe incredible jet suit allowed the British inventor to reach speeds of up to 32mph over Lagoona Park in Reading, Berkshire, In November 2017\n\nDubbed the \u2018real life Iron Man\u2019, Mr Browning broke the Guinness world record for the fastest speed in a body-controlled jet engine power suit in 2017 - wearing the \u00a340,000 suit, which he designed himself, and reaching 32.02mph.\n\nThe suit takes off vertically and can be controlled by moving the arms, while a display screen inside the helmet gives updates on fuel consumption.\n\nA patent issued to Gravity for the suit by the UK's Intellectual Property Office, covers 'A wearable flight system with a number of propulsion assemblies including a left-hand propulsion assembly and a right-hand propulsion assembly worn on a user's hands and/or forearm'.\n\nMr Browning has since become a worldwide hit, appearing at 35 events in 12 countries to share his design with others\n\n'Preferably a body propulsion assembly is provided with support for a user's waist or torso. Leg propulsion systems may also be provided.'\n\nTwitter users commented on the new addition with amusement and horror.\n\nLee Ghandi said: 'They want dat military contract money.'\n\nWhile another commented: 'Nothing like the barrel of a gun next to your ear.....or when it shoots you in the head.'\n\nMr Browning said at the time of breaking the world record: \u2018I am delighted we have set the record, and I have no doubt that this is just the beginning'\n\n\n\n", "description": "The wacky inventors at Gravity jet packs have added a new accessory to their \u00a340,000 suit - a shoulder mounted 'head tracking turret' for an airsoft or BB gun that shoots as you look around.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/15/19544694-0-image-a-7_1570719313309.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
