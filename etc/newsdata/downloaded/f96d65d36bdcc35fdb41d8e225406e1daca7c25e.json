Now he\u2019s marooned in Belize. It\u2019s quite a story.", "language": "en", "text": "SAN IGNACIO, BELIZE \u2014 It sounded like death made airborne in those brutal days in Raqqa.\n\nBullets screamed across the ruined streets in swarms thicker than flies on roadkill. Machine guns rattled.\n\nAnd the rocket-propelled grenades. Those were the worst. They hammered down with awful concussive thuds, smashing cinder block into choking clouds of powder\n\nFor days in that sweltering October of 2017, Michael Enright crouched in an apartment building turned battle station, staring into the maw of the last Islamic State stronghold in Syria. Enright was the most unlikely of soldiers, pinned down there alongside his Kurdish and expat militia brothers, dodging bullets, blasting away with his Kalashnikov rifle, wondering whether these might be his last moments on earth.\n\n\u201cIt felt like the devil himself was breathing fire on me,\u201d Enright says.\n\nLess than two years earlier, Enright \u2014 a Hollywood actor by way of Britain \u2014 had been tooling around Los Angeles in an aging black Porsche 911 and hobnobbing with movie stars at awards ceremony after-parties. Enright, who bears a passing resemblance to actor Russell Crowe, had appeared with Tom Cruise in the movie \u201cKnight and Day.\u201d He was guest starring as a bad guy on the television series \u201cAgents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\u201d Since the 1980s he had been living the working actor\u2019s dream-life in the entertainment capital of the world.\n\nYet, one day in 2015, in defiance of common sense and the tearful urgings of his friends, he decided to leave all that behind. Never having fired a gun at another human being, he embarked on an odyssey at the age of 51 that could have sprung straight from the imagination of a Hollywood scriptwriter.\n\nHis strange, sinuous meanderings have taken him on two harrowing tours of battle in Syria as a volunteer with the formerly U.S.-backed Kurdish militia. They also have thrust him into the byzantine pathways and switchbacks of the U.S. immigration system and, by his account, the wilds of international spy networks. His decision to overstay a U.S. tourist visa three decades ago and start a new life as an American has now made him unwelcome to come back to the only nation he considers home. So far, it hasn\u2019t mattered that he risked his life fighting an American enemy.\n\n\n\nEnright, here in the 2013 film \"Elegy for a Revolutionary,\" often played the bad guy on screen. In real life, he yearned to be a good guy. (Courtesy Paul van Zyl)\n\nBecause he fears returning to the United Kingdom, where some British volunteers with the Kurdish militia have been arrested and accused of consorting with terrorists, he finds himself, essentially, a man without a country. Unable to work, his money dwindling, he wanders, flopping for the past two years in slum apartments or couch-surfing in Belize and elsewhere in Latin America in the homes of people he meets in the streets or online. He hauls a thin pad to sleep on, a backpack, a handful of tank tops and shorts, and a clunky, old laptop, hoping against hope that someone, anyone, will help him get back to Los Angeles.\n\nThrough more than two dozen interviews with his friends, fellow soldiers and others, as well as video and other documentation of Enright\u2019s battlefield exploits, The Washington Post has been able to confirm nearly every aspect of the actor\u2019s account. His saga has now captured the attention of Washington power players and veterans advocates who have been agitating to end Enright\u2019s exile and bring him home.\n\nThe details of his trajectory offer an unusually intimate glimpse into the forces that motivate men and women from around the world to throw themselves into conflicts not their own. Unlike mercenaries who flood into war zones for profit, Enright joined the fight for no pay, a throwback to the storied dramas of yore when the famed British writer George Orwell and others fought in the Spanish Civil War.\n\nI don\u2019t regret a thing, mate. I\u2019d do it all over again. Michael Enright\n\nAs Enright tells it, his war experiences were all about balancing an account. The ledger he holds in his head is particular to that of some successful immigrants \u2014 he says he wanted to repay America by helping to vanquish one of its terrorist enemies.\n\nOn screen, he\u2019d often played the bad guy, leveraging his ability to shoot a menacing stare at the camera. In real-life, he yearned to be a good guy.\n\nEnright envisions a final scene yet to be shot, one in which this master of small character roles steals the show by unlocking the secrets of a murderous, fanatical cabal: He\u2019s gathered intelligence about the Islamic State on the battlefields of Syria \u2014 computer memory cards, IDs, letters \u2014 that he hopes will unlock clues about the movements of the group in the Middle East and in the United States, he says. The improbable warrior-spy just needs the U.S. government to validate and value what he\u2019s found \u2014 enough to look past his immigration-law transgressions.\n\nDespite his frustration, Enright, now 56, his hair cropped short and graying, has repeated the same phrase over and over in hours of interviews with The Post: \u201cI don\u2019t regret a thing, mate. I\u2019d do it all over again.\u201d\n\n\n\nVolunteer fighter Michael Enright, providing overwatch during the battle of Raqqa, then an Islamic State redoubt in Syria. (Adam R. Wood)\n\nComing to America\n\nHe\u2019d grown up hard in a hard section of Manchester, where he says his father, a roughneck with a temper, committed suicide while battling cancer. Enright was 18.\n\nHe scraped together a living driving a taxi, he says, and a Pakistani immigrant taxi man named Mustafa became a kind of surrogate father. Mustafa \u2014 he\u2019d never forget that man or that man\u2019s name.\n\nAll Enright wanted to do was go to America. He wanted to make American money. He wanted to kiss American girls. He wanted to be an American, for it was here that he thought he could not just reinvent himself \u2014 but also invent himself.\n\nWhen he was 19, he says, he boarded a plane and went to New York, entering the country on the first of several tourist visas that he would overstay for his entire adult life.\n\nArriving in New York, he got a job as a busboy at a restaurant near the World Trade Center. The actor Kirk Douglas came in once, and one of the famed actor\u2019s companions gave Enright a $5 tip.\n\nHe\u2019d gotten the acting bug as a teenager in England, and perhaps it was inevitable that he would find his way to Hollywood. His Manchester accent had marked him as a member of the lower classes in Britain, cutting off possibilities, but in Los Angeles it was the opposite. It opened doors, especially in auditions.\n\nWhile trying to get himself established, he ran a youth hostel in Venice Beach. Carefree tourist girls came and went, looking for fun. There were plenty of girls to kiss.\n\n\u201cI was living this very hedonistic life,\u201d Enright says during an interview in the remote town of San Ignacio in Belize, where he\u2019s lived for months.\n\nHis first break as an actor came when he auditioned for the role of a boxer in a soft drink commercial. His competition couldn\u2019t punch; Enright, who had been pounding a speed bag at a boxing gym in Watts, got the part. The residuals paid his rent for months.\n\nTelevision roles trickled in. He played an Irish Republican Army soldier on the television series \u201cJAG.\u201d He picked up more commercials.\n\nEnright always has been impulsive, his friends say. In the 1990s, he flew to Rwanda after the genocide there, volunteering at an orphanage. The work appealed to his Christian notion of obligation, that human beings are commanded to alleviate suffering. He slipped back into the United States, once again, on a tourist visa.\n\nA few years later, the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, set him on a course that eventually took him to Syria. For days, Enright and his friends say, he couldn\u2019t stop watching the news.\n\n\u201cI cried every day,\u201d Enright says.\n\nHe told his friends that he wanted to join the U.S. Army and fight terrorists in Afghanistan. Here, he reasoned, was a chance to make a payment toward the debt he felt he owed to the United States. His friends talked him out of it.\n\nIt became the biggest regret of his life.\n\n\n\nEnright, center, in \"Elegy for a Revolutionary.\" (Courtesy of Paul van Zyl)\n\nIn movies\n\nIn Hollywood, Enright wasn\u2019t getting rich, but he made a modest living. He got a gig as a Russian mobster on the television series \u201cKitchen Confidential.\u201d He played a deckhand in the film \u201cPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man\u2019s Chest,\u201d appearing in a scene with Orlando Bloom.\n\n\u201cOn \u2018Law & Order,\u2019 I was once dissolved in a vat of acid!\u201d he says, his eyes twinkling.\n\nFor Russian roles, his r\u00e9sum\u00e9 said he was Mikael Enrightski. For French roles, he was Michel Henright. His accents were so convincing that casting directors wouldn\u2019t figure out he wasn\u2019t French or Russian or German until his scenes were already in the can.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Enright deadpans, \u201cI speak 32 languages. Only a few words in most of them. But 32 nonetheless.\u201d\n\nOn \u2018Law & Order,\u2019 I was once dissolved in a vat of acid! Michael Enright\n\nHe lived in a part of West Los Angeles known for gang violence. He had his own brush with the law in 2003 when he was charged with assault with a deadly weapon after the car he was driving struck and injured a man who Enright says threatened him during a traffic incident. Enright was exonerated, according to court records.\n\nPeople have a tendency to want to adopt Enright. Mike Chapman, who met him while working with a spirituality group for Hollywood professionals, started taking him home to spend time with his family.\n\n\u201cHe was kind of like an uncle to our small children,\u201d Chapman says in a recent interview.\n\nOrna Cohen, one of Enright\u2019s workout clients, folded Enright into her family, as well. At a Passover dinner at her house one year, she looked up and saw Enright, whom friends describe as a nondenominational spiritual seeker, in tears. She walked outside with him.\n\n\u201cHe was sobbing like a baby,\u201d Cohen recalls. \u201cHe looked at me and said, \u2018Orna, I feel God.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\n\nEnright in exile in San Ignacio, Belize, in July 2019. (Jeffery A. Salter / for The Washington Post)\n\nRighting a wrong\n\nIn August 2014, Islamic State troops swept into the Sinjar district in northern Iraq, an area that was home to the Yazidi, an ethnic Kurdish minority. Hundreds of men were killed in a genocidal massacre. Women were taken captive and subjected to rape and forced marriages.\n\nHalf a world away, Enright once again found himself obsessed with news: \u201cI sort of became an ISIS junkie.\u201d\n\nThat same month an Islamic State terrorist beheaded the American freelance journalist James Foley, boasting of the killing in a gruesome video. The killer was later identified as a British man of Arab descent who became known as \u201cJihadi John.\u201d\n\nEnright sought out a British friend in Los Angeles, a dashing, globe-trotting sort who goes by the professional name Rob Lancaster, who has worked as an operative in the shadows of international conflicts and danger zones.\n\nAt a Santa Monica bar where their favorite football team, Manchester City, was playing, Enright told Lancaster that he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about the atrocities at Sinjar and the beheading of Foley.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to right that wrong,\u201d Enright declared.\n\nLancaster had heard this sort of thing from Enright before, but he\u2019d always dismissed it as a transitory emotional reaction. He\u2019d tell him, \u201cDon\u2019t go, you silly sot.\u201d\n\nBut Enright was insistent, and Lancaster concluded there was nothing he could do \u2014 except help.\n\nSoon thereafter, Lancaster pointed his friend to a Facebook page.\n\n\u2018Are you willing to die?\u2019\n\nAt his Los Angeles apartment, Enright signed on to a Facebook page associated with the YPG, the initials used for the People\u2019s Protection Units, a mainly Kurdish militia.\n\nHe sent a straightforward message: \u201cI\u2019d like to go fight for you in Syria.\u201d\n\nHe waited four days before a message notification popped onto his screen.\n\n\u201cAre you willing to die for this fight?\u201d\n\nHe did not know the real name of the person with whom he was communicating. But he knew how he would answer.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he typed.\n\nThe person who was messaging him didn\u2019t want him to have any illusions. The militia had very little equipment. No helmets. No body armor. It was fighting an enemy that had tanks and armored personnel carriers. If he were injured, the only painkiller they could provide was aspirin.\n\nNothing could dissuade him.\n\n\u201cMy feeling was that I was going to go there, I\u2019m going to suffer, and I\u2019m going to die,\u201d Enright says.\n\nHe sold his Porsche to pay for a one-way ticket to Iraq.\n\nMy feeling was that I was going to go there, I\u2019m going to suffer, and I\u2019m going to die. Michael Enright\n\nHe told almost no one except Lancaster. Enright had no family obligations to hold him back \u2014 he\u2019d been married briefly years ago but was now habitually single. He had no children.\n\nEnright had once shot a prop assault weapon in a TV commercial for Norton antivirus software. The only time he\u2019d shot a real weapon was when he\u2019d fired a couple of pistol rounds for fun in the woods during a long-ago Christian retreat.\n\nThe day before his departure, he went to a firing range in the L.A. area. It would be the sum total of his military training before leaving.\n\n\n\nEnright in Belize, where he landed after two tours as a volunteer fighter for the Kurds against the Islamic State. (Jeffery A. Salter / for The Washington Post)\n\nFording the Tigris\n\nAn odd calm settled over Enright. He felt no fear, he says. Knowing that he would probably perish in Syria gave him inner peace.\n\nHe flew to the United Kingdom, and there he began assembling gear. Boots. A jacket for the cold desert nights.\n\nAs his departure date approached, he sent a stream of messages to the person with whom he\u2019d been communicating via Facebook. Days passed with no response.\n\nHe called Lancaster, wondering whether he should fly to Iraq anyway.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t chance it,\u201d Lancaster said.\n\nInstead, Enright headed for London\u2019s Heathrow Airport. He landed in Sulaymaniyah, a city in Iraqi Kurdistan, around 3 in the morning. No one was there to pick him up. He checked into a low-cost hotel. He started sending more Facebook messages.\n\nFinally someone responded.\n\n\u201cWhen do you arrive?\u201d the message said, according to an image reviewed by The Post.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m already here!\u201d Enright wrote back.\n\nThat afternoon, a man called the hotel asking for him.\n\n\u201cYou want to join the YPG?\u201d the voice on the other end of the line asked.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nThen, a familiar query: \u201cAre you willing to die?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nBang, bang\n\nA man arrived at the hotel the next day. Enright had no way of knowing whether he was walking into a trap: \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m shaking hands with YPG or ISIS.\u201d\n\nEnright got into a car pointed toward the Iraqi-Syrian border. They drove deep into the mountains of Iraq, eventually hopping into an inflatable rubber dinghy and crossing into Syria via a narrow stretch of the Tigris River, its waters illuminated by a full moon.\n\nThere was no going back now.\n\nIn Syria, Enright says, he was led to a remote desert camp that the YPG fighters called \u201cthe academy.\u201d He\u2019d spend six weeks there learning how to fire an AK-47 and other arts of war. Some of the expat volunteers he met at the academy and elsewhere were suspicious of his motives, Enright says, thinking he was out for publicity to generate better parts in the movies.\n\n\u201cWhy would I risk my life for a role?\u201d he would say.\n\nEnright chose \u201cMustafa\u201d as his nom de guerre to honor the Pakistani taxi driver who\u2019d mentored him so long ago.\n\nWhen Enright\u2019s new Kurdish colleagues found out he was an actor, they pressed a head-cam into his hand. They wanted him to collect footage that would document their struggle.\n\nEnright resisted.\n\n\u201cI came to shoot, but not with a camera,\u201d Enright told them.\n\nBut he changed his mind when he found out that his camera would allow him to join up with any unit. The militia wanted \u201cbang, bang\u201d footage to promote its cause and demonstrate its commitment to eradicating the Islamic State. Enright wanted action.\n\nHe took the camera.\n\nHe got action fast. Within days, his unit was ordered to clear a village that had been bombed by U.S. forces supporting the YPG, he says.\n\n\u201cI was going to be coming face-to-face with a terrorist,\u201d Enright says.\n\nHe went charging into the town of Suluk. Heart pumping. Pure adrenaline.\n\nI was going to be coming face-to-face with a terrorist. Michael Enright\n\nThen he went flying. Not from a bullet, but from his own clumsiness and inexperience. Loaded down with gear, he face-planted, scraping long patches of skin from his leg and arm. His first foray as a soldier and he already felt like a klutz.\n\nHe\u2019d get better at it. Head-cam footage shows Enright engaged in heavy fighting in the months to come. He took to fighting like a natural, say fellow soldiers interviewed by The Post. In the videos, machine-gun fire and explosions can be heard. Enright looks like a killer.\n\nThey tore a path through Syria, clearing villages where he\u2019d sometimes encounter dozens of rotting corpses of Islamic State fighters in the streets. Stray dogs would eat the heads first. Enright had such contempt for his enemy that he watched with a sense of satisfaction.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s funny,\u201d he says, looking back. \u201cIn life, they would take our heads off. In death, the dogs would take their heads.\u201d\n\nEnright spent six months fighting alongside the YPG, completing a standard tour of duty for foreign volunteers. But his life was about to become as bizarre and baffling as anything he\u2019d encountered in the deserts of Syria.\n\n\n\nEnright with a captured Islamic State flag. (Adam R. Wood)\n\nThe border\n\nEnright had left Los Angeles for Syria in a tornado of emotion. He\u2019s not prone to sit and calculate risks and contingencies. But as he prepared to return to the United States, it weighed heavily on him that he had a problem.\n\nHis epic tourist visa overstays, 30 years of living in the United States without legal permission, were going to make things hard for him \u2014 to say the least. He developed a plan: attempt to cross from Mexico into California through the San Ysidro border crossing south of San Diego, the busiest in the United States. Maybe he\u2019d blend in with the hordes and get across, he thought.\n\nIn November 2015, Enright was stopped at the border by U.S. immigration officials and sent to a detention center in Otay Mesa, according to passport records and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement corroboration.\n\nEnright\u2019s account of his six weeks of detention is similar to those of Central American migrants who have been detained during the recent surge of apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border. Blasting air conditioning turned the cells into iceboxes. The lights were never turned off. He was stuffed into a cell where there was no room to lie down.\n\nAt this point, Enright\u2019s account becomes harder to pin down. While detained, he says, he met with officials who he believes were working for the Department of Homeland Security. He describes one of them as \u201cLaura, the Blond Lady.\u201d\n\nIn his mind\u2019s eye, the Blond Lady became an all-powerful being capable of offering salvation from his immigration hell. He\u2019s forgotten her last name, but remembers that she was \u201cquite pretty.\u201d Over the course of several meetings, Enright says, he reviewed maps of Syria with the officials and described his encounters with Islamic State fighters.\n\nEnright asserts that Laura eventually made an extraordinary offer: If he were able to return to Syria and gather intelligence about the Islamic State that would be useful to the U.S. government, she would make his immigration problem disappear.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Okay, I\u2019ll get intelligence for you,\u2019\u201d Enright recalls.\n\nEnright says he has no documentation of the offer and it was not witnessed by anyone. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman said that the agency could not comment on investigative methods and that it could not confirm the accuracy of Enright\u2019s account.\n\nThe Post has interviewed four people who say Enright called them about the putative offer while he was detained and believe he was being truthful about his understanding of the arrangement. A fifth person \u2014 filmmaker Adam Wood, now working on a documentary about Enright \u2014 says he learned about it from Enright shortly after the actor was released.\n\nMichael Hecht, a psychotherapist who\u2019d befriended Enright in Los Angeles and also received a call from him while he was detained, said in an interview that Enright might have been coping with his dilemma by hearing what he wanted to hear.\n\n\u201cI think in that situation you grasp at straws,\u201d Hecht said.\n\nHecht referred Enright to a Los Angeles lawyer, James Kajtoch, who traveled to Otay Mesa to meet the actor. Kajtoch would later send an email to Enright, saying: \u201cIf you want me to provide terrorist information from Syria to our government, I am NOT the person to assist you. As much as I am interested in contributing to the fight against terrorism, I do not have time to do this.\u201d\n\nIn mid-December, Enright says, he was deported to England, still believing he\u2019d made a deal with the U.S. government. Three U.S. deportation officers flew with him to London based on the results of a threat assessment that an ICE spokeswoman declined to detail.\n\nEnright knew where he needed to go next. He wanted to hold up his end of a deal that he believed would restore his life in the United States.\n\nHe packed, one more time, for war.\n\n\n\nEnright, an Englishman by birth, takes tea at a typical small restaurant in San Ignacio, Belize. (Jeffery A. Salter / for The Washington Post)\n\nThe Angelman cometh\n\nIn June 2016, Enright landed again in Sulaymaniyah. He\u2019d arrived there more than a year earlier as a neophyte soldier. Now he felt like a veteran.\n\nBefore plunging back into battle, he says, he traveled to the U.S. Consulate in Irbil, Iraq, and met with an FBI agent. Enright says he handed over a data card from an Islamic State soldier\u2019s computer that he\u2019d seized during his first tour. He wanted to give the U.S. government a taste of what he might be able to offer.\n\nThat fall, Enright reached out to the consulate again, this time via a message he sent to the consulate\u2019s Facebook page. He explained that he no longer had the agent\u2019s contact information. The consulate responded by giving him the email of the agent he\u2019d met.\n\nAs Enright fought his way across Syria, trudging slowly toward Raqqa, an Islamic State stronghold, he kept thinking of Laura, the Blond Lady, whom he saw as the key to his ticket back home.\n\nVideo from that time shows him riffling through the pockets of a dead Islamic State soldier, the man\u2019s right arm cocked in the air, stiff with rigor mortis. He filmed images of any documents he could find that might help ingratiate him with U.S. immigration authorities.\n\nIn late December that year, Enright says, a friend introduced him by email to a woman who is a well-connected political insider in Virginia. She connected him to a man he believed to be a U.S. intelligence official based in Texas, Enright says.\n\nThey exchanged text messages using code names: the presumptive officer was \u201cAngelman\u201d and Enright would go by the handle \u201cLight Saber.\u201d (Images of their communication include messages to Enright from someone identifying himself as \u201cAngelman,\u201d but his identity and association could not be confirmed by The Post.)\n\nEnright was determined to make Angelman happy. He stepped up his efforts to gather evidence. Video from that period shows him interrogating Islamic State fighters.\n\nOn one man\u2019s phone was a video of one of Enright\u2019s fellow militiamen being beheaded, Enright says.\n\nEnright also gathered letters written by Islamic State soldiers, he says. They might offer clues, he thought. He sent what he\u2019d found to Angelman.\n\nEnright\u2019s zeal to gather intelligence placed him in constant danger. In January 2017 \u2014 the same day that Donald Trump was being inaugurated as president in Washington \u2014 his unit was ambushed by a large Islamic State force, Enright says. The enemy were howling \u201cKafir, Kafir\u201d \u2014 an Arabic term that means \u201cnonbeliever\u201d \u2014 because they did not consider the militia soldiers to be true Muslims.\n\n(On Sunday, Trump made the surprise decision to withdraw U.S. forces who had been stationed alongside Kurdish soldiers. Critics said it would leave the Kurds vulnerable to attacks by the more heavily armed Turkish government, which has condemned the militia groups for ties to a separatist party labeled a terrorist organization by Turkey and the United States.)\n\nEnright was trapped inside a building behind the Islamic State front, separated from his gun. For the next 19 hours, he says, he lay beneath a mattress while Islamic State fighters roamed the area, firing at his fellow militia soldiers. He didn\u2019t dare make a noise. He urinated where he lay so that they wouldn\u2019t detect movement. He clutched a grenade in his hand and a knife. He imagined being burned to death if he were captured or dragged through the streets until he died or was beheaded. He resolved to kill himself if Islamic State soldiers found him.\n\n\u201cI was ready to go to Jesus,\u201d he says.\n\n\n\nEnright stands behind a wall while on lookout in Raqqa. (Adam R. Wood)\n\nTo pass the tension-filled hours, Enright, says he kept thinking about what was happening in Washington. He had high hopes that Trump would step up U.S. support for the Kurdish militia. Now that Trump had taken the oath of office, Enright considered him his commander in chief.\n\nAfter a restless night, Enright decided to make a run for it during a lull in the shooting. He disguised himself as an Arab villager using clothes he found in the house. But as he emerged, he was spotted. When he kept running, bullets whizzed past him. Something seemed strange. Suddenly he realized it was one of his fellow militiamen mistakenly firing at him.\n\nLater, they had a laugh about it. Enright told the man he was a terrible shot \u2014 thankfully.\n\nThat spring, the war became even more personal. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for bombing the crowd at an Ariana Grande concert in Enright\u2019s hometown of Manchester, killing more than 20 people.\n\n\u201cApart from being heartbroken, part of me is a little bit pissed,\u201d Enright, dressed in camouflage, says in a video he recorded from Syria, lamenting what he described as the apathetic attitudes about the Islamic State and Syria that he\u2019d encountered in Manchester after his first tour of duty.\n\nIt would take months for Enright and his colleagues to make it to Raqqa, the final redoubt of the Islamic State. Videos and interviews with fellow soldiers confirm his presence there.\n\nWhen Raqqa fell in October 2017, Enright pulled out his phone. He cranked a song as loudly as his device could go, and started dancing.\n\nThe tune was by Ariana Grande.\n\nThe title: \u201cBang Bang.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter trying to find a place to stay in various locales in Belize, Enright settled in San Ignacio, where he is well-known to locals. (Jeffery A. Salter / for The Washington Post)\n\nA tropical purgatory\n\nIn November 2017, Enright was ready to cash in on the deal he thought he\u2019d made with Laura, the Blond Lady. For months, he says, he\u2019d been sending material to Angelman and also sharing it with his YPG compatriots. Now he wanted Angelman to deliver; he just needed someplace to wait while his immigration problem disappeared.\n\nThe Kurds had paid for him to fly anywhere in the world, he says. He settled on Belize. They speak English there. It\u2019s very inexpensive. The perfect place, he thought.\n\nFrom Belize, he started flinging text messages at Angelman, who eventually suggested Enright meet with the embassy there.\n\nIn early 2018, Enright reached a U.S. diplomat in Belize\u2019s capital, Belmopan, who insisted on talking with Angelman before meeting with him, according to Enright. Once they\u2019d spoken, the staffer invited him for a meeting.\n\n\u201cPlease bring anything that would be helpful to explain your situation,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe staffer was encouraging, he says, but hasn\u2019t been able to get him home. (The embassy did not respond to emails requesting comment.)\n\nEnright and his immigration attorney have been working on trying to get him an S visa, which is granted to people who assist law enforcement. Eventually, Enright says, he learned through diplomatic contacts that Angelman wasn\u2019t senior enough to request an S visa.\n\nNow, Enright holds close the intelligence material he claims to have gathered: Identification cards for Islamic State fighters. A letter written by an English-speaking Islamic State soldier to his superiors. Video images of rental car receipts with photos of men who identified themselves as Islamic State soldiers.\n\nStuck in Belize, Enright was ever in desperate need of a place to stay. For a time, he says, he lived in the dormitory of a Christian organization that counseled prisoners, then rented floor space in a new acquaintance\u2019s home. Another offer led him to San Ignacio, a dusty town in western Belize.\n\nA recent evening found Enright strolling down a sleepy street lined with restaurants in the center of San Ignacio. Settling into an outdoor table, Enright\u2019s conversation is constantly interrupted. No one, it seems, doesn\u2019t know him.\n\nA woman in a full-length red gown enters the restaurant, her attire standing out among the casually dressed locals and backpacking tourists.\n\n\u201cOh, my!\u201d Enright calls out. \u201cThe Oscar goes to . . . !\u201d\n\nThe woman, a former neighbor who\u2019d dressed up for a night out with her husband, smiles and rushes over the table. Like his friends in Los Angeles, they\u2019d folded him into their family. The woman and her husband were so happy to see him that they sent a soda over to Enright\u2019s table \u2014 he doesn\u2019t drink alcohol.\n\nHis days and nights spool out this way, one bleeding into the next. His U.S. friends have taken to pleading for help bringing him back. On a website they\u2019ve created, BringMichaelHome.com, an eclectic mix of film professionals and a retired U.S. Army Reserves major general offer testimonials.\n\nGreg Martin, a deputy district attorney in Los Angeles who filmed a testimonial, told The Post that his longtime friend \u201cnot only should be given a pass but should be celebrated for what he\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nIn Washington, influential power players have taken up Enright\u2019s cause, including Jim Dornan, a political consultant and distant cousin of former Republican congressman Robert K. Dornan, of California. William Scott, who heads the group Veterans in Defense of Liberty, spoke to his senator, Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), about Enright, Scott said in an interview. Blunt has sought to help untangle Enright\u2019s immigration quandary, Scott said, but has yet to get results. (Blunt did not respond to an interview request.)\n\nAnd so, Enright waits with no sign that his purgatory will end. Baffled about why he can\u2019t come home, holding close materials he gathered in Syria that he has yet to turn over to U.S. authorities.\n\nWondering whatever happened to a blond lady named Laura.\n\nmanuel.roig-franzia@washpost.com\n\nAlice Crites and Magda Jean-Louis contributed to this report.
