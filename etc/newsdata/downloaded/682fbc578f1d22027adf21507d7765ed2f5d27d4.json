Business Insider Intelligence\n\nTwo announcements on Friday indicate that Apple is looking to become a studio in its own right, capable of producing high-quality content for its SVOD offering:\n\nTalent : Apple struck a five-year overall content TV production deal with Oscar-winning director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n (\"Roma\" and \"Gravity\"), which will have the filmmaker develop TV series exclusively for Apple TV+ through his production company Esperanto Filmoj, per Deadline. He's also expected to collaborate with the indie studio Anonymous Content where he has a non-exclusive deal. The deal marks Cuar\u00f3n's first major foray into TV production.\n\n: Apple struck a five-year overall content TV production deal with Oscar-winning director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n (\"Roma\" and \"Gravity\"), which will have the filmmaker develop TV series exclusively for Apple TV+ through his production company Esperanto Filmoj, per Deadline. He's also expected to collaborate with the indie studio Anonymous Content where he has a non-exclusive deal. The deal marks Cuar\u00f3n's first major foray into TV production. Content: Apple is set to produce its first in-house TV series, a limited drama series called \"Masters of the Air,\" which will be executive produced by Steven Spielberg (through his production company Amblin Television) and Tom Hanks.\n\nBecause Apple is cash-rich, it's in a stronger position to invest in becoming a studio and become self-sufficient over the long term. By developing its own content for distribution on its service and devices, Apple can gain the advantage of being vertically integrated \u2014 meaning that it will control both distribution, the customer relationship, and content. En route to long-term self-sufficiency, we could also see Apple open studio spaces, as Netflix has done.\n\nAlthough Netflix continues to license content from rival studios, it has also invested in expanding its span of permanent production spaces around the world as it looks to ramp up original productions as a share of overall platform content. Earlier this year, Netflix spent $100 million to open a production hub in NYC; following similar hubs in various cities including Los Angeles, Albuquerque, Toronto , and Madrid.\n\nApple has a distinct advantage over its rivals with such a strategy \u2014 its deep pockets. Apple has $210.6 billion in cash on hand, compared with $25 billion in free cash flow at Amazon, and expected negative free cash flow of about $3.5 billion at Netflix.\n\nApple's advantage in terms of cash could give it an especially meaningful advantage as the cost of talent rises. The entry of SVOD giants and tech companies into the talent arms race has already inflated talent costs because these companies pay talent upfront, based on their perceived value to the service in terms of how many subscribers they can attract, as opposed to backend residuals.\n\nThis has made top talent an increasingly scarce, and therefore expensive, commodity. Further, some A-list producers are cobbling together multiple separate deals with various companies \u2014 rather than exclusively signing to a single company. Historically, overall deals have been exclusive because they deliver the most value to the company. But as the market for content has become more competitive, A-list creators have realized that they have greater leverage in negotiations.\n\nThat could have two effects: One, the relative value of deals could decline as exclusivity becomes less common; Two, exclusive deals could rise in cost as producers enter them only for high-value amounts. For example, WarnerMedia signed an overall deal valued at $250 million with J.J. Abrams in September, after he'd reportedly walked from a $500 million all-encompassing deal with Apple, likely because under the WarnerMedia deal he retains the ability to sell TV shows to \"external outlets.\"\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
