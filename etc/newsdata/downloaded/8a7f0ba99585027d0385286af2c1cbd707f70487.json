Nestl\u00e9 on Thursday launched hand-crafted \"luxury\" versions of the chocolate-covered wafer bars in shops throughout the United Kingdom for around $17 each. A typical \"four-finger\" candy bar costs about $1 in the U.S.\n\nThe Swiss food giant said it will launch the specialty confections, which it calls the KitKat Chocolatory, in York's Chocolate Story and in 30 John Lewis and Partners stores, a high-end department chain. Customers not living in the U.K. can also order them online at Nestl\u00e9 in November.\n\nIn the flagship John Lewis department store in London, KitKat fans can also customize their own \"eight-finger\" bars with different combinations of milk, dark, white and ruby chocolate varieties. They can also add 14 different ingredients like shortbread pieces, salted caramel chunks, honeycomb and rose petals.\n\nKitKat Chocolatory is available in the U.K. through December 24.", "description": "Chocolate lovers can make their own version of the bar with ingredients like shortbread, honeycomb and rose petals", "authors": ["Sarah Min"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/27/5664b8a2-057d-4460-87e7-2c8f757e8e5d/thumbnail/1200x630g8/9f6006a5af465313ed62643dc96ed020/createyourgiftbox-under-barry-calabaut-pr-cover.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
