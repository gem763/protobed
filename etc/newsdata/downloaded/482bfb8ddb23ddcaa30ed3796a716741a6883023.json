Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, and Joe Pesci have teamed up with the Taxi Driver director for a crime epic based on Charles Brandt\u2019s mafia memoir I Heard You Paint Houses.\n\nDe Niro plays Frank Sheeran, a mob hitman and Second World War veteran who, in his old age, reflects on a lifetime in the mafia, particularly his involvement in the disappearance of labour leader Jimmy Hoffa (Pacino), who was his friend, and his time with the Bufalino crime family.\n\nThe film is long, at a whopping three-and-a-half hours, which is a big ask for those potentially watching it on their iPhones via Netflix. But it is also, the first critics to see it say, a triumph. After a screening in New York, the first verdicts are out \u2013 and they have amounted to an impressive 100 per cent on Rotten Tomatoes\u2019 scale. Here\u2019s why:\n\nAs one might expect from a director of such loving precision, The Irishman is exquisitely made, every detail carefully considered, every location perfectly picked and with such a gargantuan budget at hand, it feels utterly transporting, a film to be savoured on a big, crisp screen rather than half-watched on a smartphone. De-ageing quibbles aside, the craftsmanship contained here is flawless and my main reservation about its Netflix availability is that not enough people will get to appreciate the delicacy of Scorsese and his team\u2019s work in theatres.", "description": "There\u2019s been so much fuss about the extraordinary \u2013 and somewhat baffling \u2013 de-ageing in The Irishman, Martin Scorsese\u2019s first film for Netflix, that it\u2019s almost eclipsed the potential it had for being a very good film.", "authors": ["Telegraph Reporters"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/on-demand/2019/08/01/irishman-still-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqPw6h6usEMXF3qdE5C2AFDgn5-mF14fjZexYGfPn71xg.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-08-01"}
