This latest threat cites reports from a conservative group that obtained tapes of CNN employees discussing coverage of the president.\n\nThe complaint is the latest salvo in the long-running war between him and the news media, particularly CNN.\n\n\"But CNN is a voice that really seems to be the voice out there,\" Trump said before signing a health care executive order in Florida this month. \"And it\u2019s a terrible thing for our country. And we ought to start our network and put some real news out there because they are so bad.\"\n\nAfter a Trump attack in August of 2018, CNN said in a statement: \"Make no mistake, Mr. President, CNN does not lie. We report the news. And we report when people in power tell lies. CNN stands by our reporting and our reporters.\"\n\nJim Mattis:'I guess I'm the Meryl Streep of generals,' Mattis jokes after Trump's insult\n\nLegal analysts pointed out that this would not be a libel suit. Trump's attorneys cite alleged violations of the Lanham Act, which is designed to prohibit trademark infringement and \u201cfalse advertising\u201d\n\n\"Trump suing CNN isn't about winning in court,\" Moss said. \"The case will go nowhere. It's about appealing to his base with a PR stunt.\"\n\nContributing: John Fritze", "description": "Donald Trump's campaign threatened to sue CNN over allegedly biased reporting, a move opponents denounced as an attempt to intimidate the media.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2019/10/18/USAT/1a0aea24-25c9-4f4c-8f26-357af07a1462-AP_Trump_41.JPG?crop=5309,2986,x0,y0&width=3200&height=2134&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
