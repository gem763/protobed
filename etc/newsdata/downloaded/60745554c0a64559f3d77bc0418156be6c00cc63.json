A lawyer for Mr Sarpong did not respond for comment.\n\nThe case also comes amid growing scrutiny of the proliferation of this type of fraud and struggles by tech companies and the military to stop them.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Facebook has said it blocked billions of fake accounts over the past year, though its estimate for the number of active fakes has continued to increase to roughly 120 million.\n\nA Facebook spokeswoman did not immediately respond for comment.\n\nMr Sarpong\u2019s arrest this week comes on the heels of a separate case last month in which federal authorities charged 80 people, accusing them of involvement in a Nigerian crime ring that stole at least $6 (\u00a34.88) million via email, romance and other internet swindles.\n\nFourteen people were arrested in the United States, but scores of other suspects are not in the country.\n\nThe two recent cases are unusual because scammers are often able to stay out of reach of US law enforcement since they are based abroad, often in West Africa, said Patrick Peterson, chief executive of Agari, a cybersecurity firm that tracks internet fraud.\n\n\u201cWhat makes this very unique,\u201d he said, \u201cis Mr Sarpong lives in New Jersey, and his co-conspirators are still safe and sound in Ghana, with hundreds of thousands of dollars in proceeds.\u201d\n\nMr Peterson said the two cases suggested that US authorities were trying to do more to combat such romance frauds, which data shows are increasing.\n\nThe FBI said it received nearly 18,500 complaints from victims of romance or similar internet frauds last year, with reported losses exceeding $362 (\u00a3294.5) million, up 71 per cent from 2017.\n\nLaw enforcement is \u201cstarting to crack the code on how to do this repeatedly and at scale, and they\u2019re trying to invest more because the losses are so high\u201d, Mr Peterson said.\n\nThe New York Times", "description": "It often started with a hope for love, then quickly turned into a promise of gold.
