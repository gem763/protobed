Today we requested Hong Kong's assistance for our personnel to go to Hong Kong to bring back Chan and relevant evidence in order to actively demonstrate our jurisdiction,\" Chiu added.\n\nThe now-scrapped extradition proposal sparked a massive public backlash with record-breaking crowds hitting the streets in Hong Kong.\n\nThe protests have since snow-balled as the movement seeks greater democracy and police accountability after Beijing and Hong Kong leaders took a hard line and violence escalated.\n\nNow the man who set off this tumultuous chain of events has indicated he is willing to go to Taiwan to stand trial, according to a clergyman who has visited him regularly in prison.\n\nChan is currently serving a short jail sentence in Hong Kong after he was convicted earlier this year of stealing his girlfriend's possessions during a trial in which he did not dispute murdering Poon Hiu-wing.\n\nThe Hong Kong government said in a statement late Monday that Chan had decided to surrender himself \"voluntarily\" to Taiwan and that his case could be handled independently without a judicial assistance deal.", "description": "Taiwan said Tuesday it had asked Hong Kong for help in collecting a murder suspect who has agreed to return to the island to face trial for killing his girlfriend in a case which inadvertently triggered massive democracy protests.
