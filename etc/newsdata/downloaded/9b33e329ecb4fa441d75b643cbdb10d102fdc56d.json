Designers are speaking up against the \u2018tyranny\u2019 of the woke", "language": "en", "text": "The fashion industry has come under increasing pressure to be as politically correct and \u201cwoke\u201d as possible in recent years, but some designers have had enough and are speaking out against social \u201ctyranny.\u201d\n\nScandals have rocked the fashion world, with brands like Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci, Prada, and Saint Laurent all coming under fire for varying social sins; too sexy, too racist, too white, too colonial, too skinny, too much cultural appropriation. Too much sensitivity?\n\n\u201cDemagogic political correctness has become a kind of tragic tyranny of the literal,\u201d Hedi Slimane of luxury French brand Celine said in an interview last month. Slimane described the movement as \u201cdisguised neo-conservatism\u201d and said \u201cit feels [like] tolerance has switched sides.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Internet loses its mind over \u2018racist\u2019 Dior perfume ad featuring Johnny Depp & Native American dancer\n\nAdmittedly, some of the fashion industry\u2019s biggest controversies have been avoidable and self-inflicted. D&G, for instance, should have been able to predict the backlash at having an Asian woman clumsily attempt to eat pasta and spaghetti with chopsticks. Gucci could also have anticipated the uproar sparked over its \u201cblackface\u201d sweater this year.\n\nBut the demands go much further than simply avoiding outright racism. Some have called for racial quotas on the catwalks. Others have called for more body shapes and sizes to be represented in \u201creal\u201d fashion shows. Brands have faced uproar online for expressing the \u2018wrong\u2019 political views; D&G, for example, felt the wrath of the \u2018Resistance\u2019 when it endorsed Melania Trump as a #DGWoman in 2017. Then there\u2019s Saint Laurent, which was slammed for its apparently overly sexy ads, dubbed \u201cporno chic.\u201d Slimane\u2019s fashion at Celine has been described by the Financial Times as \u201csuper-skinny and near exclusively white.\u201d\n\nIn this culture war, it seems there are two camps, those who believe fashion has a deep responsibility to espouse the edicts of modern liberal society, always furthering the \u2018correct\u2019 political causes with slogans and awareness campaigns, and those who believe that fashion should be more frivolous and, similar to comedy and art, should not be afraid to offend or find itself constrained by the boundaries of modern political correctness.\n\nAlso on rt.com Gucci to focus on 'cultural sensitivity' drills for employees after 'blackface' sweater fallout\n\nSaint Laurent\u2019s Anthony Vaccarello told AFP on the eve of Paris fashion week that a \u201cwitch-hunt atmosphere\u201d has taken over the industry, making it \u201cimpossible\u201d to even have an opinion that goes against the mainstream.\n\nIndeed, there\u2019s even a full-time Instagram watchdog account just waiting to pounce on any brand that makes an unacceptable fashion faux pas or political misstep. Dubbed \u201cthe most feared Instagram account in fashion,\u201d by Business of Fashion, Diet Prada was founded by Tony Liu and Lindsey Schuyler and began with the goal of calling out copycat designs in the industry. Yet, Diet Prada quickly appointed itself arbiter of right and wrong in the fashion world and now polices the industry for real or perceived sexism, racism, and cultural appropriation. The account boasts 1.6 million followers and while some hail the founding duo as modern-day heroes, others say they are promoting censorship.\n\nRight or wrong, Diet Prada fits perfectly into the \u201ccancel culture\u201d world where one professional misstep or questionable comment made ten years ago can threaten to ruin a public figure\u2019s career today.\n\nDior was recently forced to pull an ad for its \u2018Sauvage\u2019 perfume which featured Native Americans performing a traditional dance. Critics jumped on the brand, accusing it of promoting the idea that Native Americans are \u201csavages\u201d only to discover that \u2018sauvage\u2019 in French actually means \u201cwild.\u201d The outrage police also accused the brand of \u201ccultural appropriation\u201d and harmful stereotyping. The ad only survived a few hours on social media before Dior chopped it. Diet Prada called it \u201ctriggering imagery.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Fashion victims: 5 times clothing giants profited from cultural appropriation\n\nSo, is all of this PC pressure stifling creativity and innovation? Italian fashion journalist Angelo Flaccavento recently slammed the suffocating nature of these \u201cviolently moralistic times\u201d which he said are \u201cdestroying freedom of expression and invention.\u201d\n\nHe is clearly not alone in his assessment. More and more fashion industry figures are daring to challenge the liberal authoritarianism of the mainstream. \u201cYou can\u2019t say or do anything anymore,\u201d Richard Rene of Guy Laroche told AFP after his show last week during Paris fashion week.\n\nNot everyone feels totally stifled by the demands of these woke times, however.\n\nSome brands have capitalized on the latest social trends. Michael Kors, Coach, Chanel, Gucci, and Burberry, among others, have all gone fur-free. Stella McCartney and Vivienne Westwood have also won fans for their eco-conscious stances and promotion of climate activism. McCartney even hosted a roundtable discussion on climate change before her recent Paris show.\n\nWestwood\u2019s husband and design partner, Andreas Kronthaler, told AFP that he includes male models in all his shows because men \u201ccan be just as beautiful as women in a dress.\u201d Meanwhile, male model Leon Dame became a viral internet meme after he dramatically strutted down the catwalk in black shiny high-heeled boots last week.\n\nThat kind of thing might not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, but that\u2019s the point really, isn\u2019t it?\n\nEach fashion statement does not need to be universally loved and appreciated by everyone. While woke, eco-conscious, liberal designers will appeal to some, others will be drawn to the anti-PC types who take bigger social risks.\n\nThat\u2019s diversity, after all.\n\nThink your friends would be interested?
