Gabriel Jesus shaped to head the ball but it came off his shoulder and crept into the net off the far post past a rooted Wayne Hennessey.\n\nThey doubled their lead just two minutes later following a speedy counter-attack.\n\nWhen the ball came to Raheem Sterling he produced a delightful chip from just inside the area into the path of David Silva, who watched it drop over his left shoulder before guiding it into the net.\n\nPalace occasionally looked threatening, with Wilfried Zaha a flickering menace, but failed to make the most of their few opportunities to test City\u2019s back four.\n\nJesus was preferred to Sergio Aguero while Riyad Mahrez was also missing from the starting side, with Fernandinho and Rodri at the heart of defence.\n\nThe second half followed a similar pattern to the first, with City in charge. Kevin De Bruyne was denied a penalty after a VAR check backed up the referee\u2019s original decision not to award a spot-kick.\n\nJesus forced a smart save from Hennessey before Bernardo Silva forced Hennessey into a one-handed save with a curling left-foot shot from the angle.\n\nHodgson threw on Christian Benteke for Luka Milivojevic with about 15 minutes to go and the Belgian almost scored with his first touch, rising highest to head the ball goalwards from a corner only to see Ederson push the ball onto the crossbar.\n\nCity should have killed the game off moments later but Jesus failed to square the ball to the unmarked De Bruyne.\n\nJurgen Klopp\u2019s Liverpool, who have a perfect record of eight wins out of eight games, can restore their eight-point lead if they beat Manchester United on Sunday.\n\nCity\u2019s next two Premier League games against Aston Villa and Southampton look winnable but they face a crucial match against Liverpool at Anfield on November 10.", "description": "London (AFP) \u2013 Manchester City brushed aside in-form Crystal Palace 2-0 on Saturday to narrow the gap to Premier League leaders Liverpool to five", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/19/a9c60a_manchester-city-celebrate-goal-crystal-palace-selhurst-park-man-city-on-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
