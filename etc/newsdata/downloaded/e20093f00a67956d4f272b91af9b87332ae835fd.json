I have so many questions.\n\nTrue or not, we hear about folks wanting to go plant-based for health reasons. As it has been outlined many times, the Beyond Meat burgers don't appear to be much healthier compared to traditional meat. Of course, preparation can have a part in that, but let's assume for the moment McDonald's using similar preparation steps as it does with traditional burgers.\n\nNow, before you fault me for making an assumption, McDonald's is a huge company that needs efficiency to make the bottom line work. Like many fast-food chains, virtually all the restaurants follow the same procedures as other restaurants. Re-inventing the wheel on prep for a specific menu item will likely result in the company dropping the product or it having a drag impact on net margins. McDonald's did not become so successful by reinventing its OWN wheel.\n\nBusiness Insider posted a simple chart from Barclays research. If we look at the base nutrition, they found similar protein amounts with the removal of cholesterol but much higher sodium in the plant-based patty. For those thinking consumers who may begin eating a McDonald's Beyond Meat burger for health reasons, I don't see it happening.\n\nIt does give vegetarians another option to consider, but that brings up a question of preparation. If McDonald's grills the Beyond Burger patty, will they use a dedicated grill? There's no mention of it in the press release. If that doesn't occur, how are vegetarians going to feel about their plant-based burger being cooked on the same grill and even next to a beef burger? Beef grease splatters, anyone? I can see the outrage now. It's a greased powder keg waiting to be lit.\n\nMcDonald's already has plant-based burgers in Europe via a partnership with Nestle (NSRGY) , therefore, it is hard to believe Beyond Meat would get exclusivity or even access to McDonald's franchises worldwide. Granted, gaining a foothold in North America would be huge, but we're still talking limited scope and competition. Price points for a fast food restaurant are more sensitive than a dog's paw on cement in the one-hundred degree heat of the summer. This will no doubt be a premium product.\n\nIs it okay to be a little excited if you a lover of plant-based burgers? Absolutely. Is it a reason to buy a company already pushing every known boundary of valuation versus the current total addressable market? No. Not one bit. We're back in the $145 to $170 trading range, but the gap today saved bulls from what looked to be a technical breakdown yesterday. I expect us to retrace to at least $145. From there, I'd make a decision based on what comes next. If we start to bounce, then I'd understand a long side swing trade. If we break below $142, then I'm looking for $115, if not $100.", "description": "For those thinking consumers who may begin eating a McDonald's Beyond Meat burger for health reasons, I don't see it happening....MCD", "authors": ["Timothy Collins", "Many Questions About The Beyond Meat", "Mcdonald'S Experiment", "For Those Thinking Consumers Who May Begin Eating A Mcdonald'S Beyond Meat Burger For Health Reasons", "I Don'T See It Happening.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Bruce Kamich", "Ed Ponsi", "James", "Rev Shark"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/f3680562-8c55-11e9-9035-83c0d8a3f3dc.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
