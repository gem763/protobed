After the show was completed, Trump invited me to a hotel room under the guise of working for him. He had a different agenda. Please contact me to speak further as I have tried to make contact,\u201d the email reads, according to CNN.\n\nZervos\u2019 lawyers also allege in the filing that Trump\u2019s own calendar entries align with her claims, placing him in Los Angeles at the Beverly Hills Hotel at the same time Zervos claims to have been assaulted by him there.\n\nTrump\u2019s defense team told CNN it rejects the new filing, with lawyer Marc Kasowitz saying, \u201cMs. Zervos\u2019 claims are entirely meritless and not corroborated by any documents.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Trump Sexual Assault Accuser Summer Zervos Tears Up During Press Conference: \u2018I Refuse to Be Intimidated Into Silence\u2019\n\nZervos\u2019 team contended that additional documents could further prove her case, but those papers are redacted as the Trump Organization withholds them due to their inclusion of his private phone number.\n\nWang did not immediately return PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nWhen she announced her plans to sue Trump in January 2017, Zervos\u2019 lawyer at the time, Gloria Allred, said in a press conference: \u201cEnough is enough. Truth matters. Women matter. Those who allege that there were victims of sexual misconduct or sexual assault by Donald Trump matter.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the White House did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nIf you or someone you know has been sexually assaulted, please contact the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673) or go to online.rainn.org.", "description": "Apprentice Star Says She Has Evidence to Back Up Claims Trump Sexually Assaulted Her", "authors": ["Benjamin Vanhoose"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tlzxCzJf7qM17EO1xGQ0lA--~B/aD0xODAwO3c9MjcwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/3dd3a122ffec10d89339b54a400564e2", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
