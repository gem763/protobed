Kamala Harris got caught up in this very conundrum when she made the rather unfortunate \u2014 for her campaign \u2014 mistake of laughing at an audience member\u2019s characterization of President Donald Trump as \u201cmentally retarded.\u201d\n\nBut let\u2019s be clear here: Harris did nothing wrong.\n\nHer politics may be detestable.\n\nHer politics are decidedly detestable.\n\nBut if principles are what runs this country, if principles should indeed be what guides this country \u2014 and they should \u2014 then even conservatives who hate all that Harris stands for have to stand by her on this one.\n\nThe scandal is this: A guy in the audience asked a somewhat long-winded question of Harris, wrapping with criticism of Trump and the \u201cmentally retarded actions of this guy.\u201d\n\nThe crowd cheered, and Harris chuckled and said, \u201cwell said, well said.\u201d\n\nWell and good. Moving on.\n\nNot so fast.\n\nShortly after, on CBS with Caitlin Huey-Burns, Harris was asked about that moment. And Harris, apparently chastised by her handlers, or simply frightened at the question, first tried to claim she didn\u2019t hear the \u201cmentally retarded\u201d phrase. She must have caught wind of her own disingenuousness, though, because she then went into defense mode and called the phrase \u201cincredibly offensive,\u201d before launching into a lecture about all the ways the phrase was indeed \u201cincredibly offensive.\u201d\n\nThe temptation here is to slam Harris as a hypocrite. And why not? She self-identifies as a social justice warrior, as a gate-guard of dignity for the downtrodden. She deserves the hypocrisy label for sure.\n\nBut somewhere in the middle of blasting Harris for talking against her walk, or walking against her talk \u2014 whatever, whichever \u2014 should come this thought: What\u2019s so wrong with the phrase mental retardation, after all?\n\n\u201cMental retardation,\u201d Emory University School of Medicine\u2019s Department of Pediatrics writes, after citing the American Association on Mental Retardation, \u201crefers to substantial limitations in present functioning.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an actual medical term.\n\nIt\u2019s broken into five categories; it\u2019s diagnosed with actual tests; it\u2019s characterized by genuine mental limitations.\n\nIt\u2019s a real thing.\n\nAnd seriously, it\u2019s not to be confused with its blatantly offensive offshoot \u2014 the shortened \u201c\u2018tard.\u201d\n\nJust because the speech police have decided it\u2019s much nicer to call someone with limited mental capacities \u2014 with mental retardation \u2014 a \u201cgifted\u201d person, or a person with ID, for intellectual disability, does not mean the rest of America has to play along.\n\nBut this is where the Democratic Party has brought us. Tripping and stumbling over ourselves, trying to stay on the right side of ever-changing rules of rhetoric.\n\nLiberals think that if they change the words, they can change the reality \u2014 or, at the least, that they can shame everyone into walking this same delusional path. Today\u2019s \u201cmental retardation\u201d is tomorrow\u2019s \u201cboys can have periods, too.\u201d It\u2019s getting to the point of ridiculous. Beyond ridiculous.\n\nIt\u2019s not that the Harris campaign rally guy characterizing Trump as \u201cmentally retarded\u201d wasn\u2019t using the phrase to offend.\n\nIt\u2019s not that Harris wasn\u2019t showing her hypocritical, hyper-politically correct cowardly self by first agreeing and laughing with this guy, then flopping to the other side on CBS and lecturing us all on the offensiveness of the phrase.\n\nBut it\u2019s this: The left has too much power to control speech in this country \u2014 to decide what\u2019s fitting, what\u2019s not, to set the rules and then change the rules, at whim, even when it means turning on one of their own.\n\nWhat\u2019s so wrong with characterizing someone as \u201cmentally retarded\u201d if you indeed think they\u2019re mentally retarded?\n\nThe fact is Harris shouldn\u2019t be president. She shouldn\u2019t be senator. Heck, she shouldn\u2019t be allowed a seat at any political table in America, given her far-left policies that are decidedly out of sync with the Constitution.\n\nBut by gosh, she should be allowed to laugh when a campaign supporter calls the president \u201cmentally retarded.\u201d She should even be allowed to agree, if that\u2019s her view. Even conservatives ought to back her on that.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
