It\u2019s easy to message against him.\u201d\n\nDetails: Over the next few months, Pelosi will be hyper-focused on McConnell and \u201chis refusal to pass meaningful legislation,\u201d per the Democratic leadership aides. The Senate\u2019s inaction on gun violence is a particularly effective example, they add.\n\nAnother benefit of the strategy, in their view, is that it creates a fresher way for the caucus to pivot to their own legislative achievements: \u201cTheir message of \u2018look at all the things we\u2019re passing\u2019 was falling flat,\u201d a Democratic congressional aide said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
