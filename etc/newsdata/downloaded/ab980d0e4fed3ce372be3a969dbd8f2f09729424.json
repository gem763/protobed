Francklyn, an heir to the Cunard shipping fortune.\n\nIn the Hamptons, a recently redesigned English manor-style property is going back on the market for about $28 million.\n\nThe home was initially listed in 2016 for $31.7 million, but it didn\u2019t find a buyer and was rented for a time instead, according to Michael Raynes, the seller.\n\nKnown as Redcraft, the home was built around 1870 for Charles G. Francklyn, an heir to the Cunard shipping fortune, according to listing agent Harald Grant of Sotheby\u2019s International Realty. The home dates back to before the village of Southampton, an enclave known for attracting wealthy residents, was formally incorporated as a village.\n\nThe seven-bedroom, 6,700-square-foot main house was reconfigured with the help of designer Steven Gambrel, who is known for several high-profile projects including a number of suites at the Plaza Hotel. It includes a large living area with a fireplace and a black mahogany ceiling, a formal dining room, an enclosed sunroom and a series of open patios accessed via french doors. The master suite has its own dressing room and a private terrace. Outside, there is a pool and a separate, newly built pool house.\n\nThe property sits on about 3\u00bd acres. The garden, designed by a previous owner to resemble the Sissinghurst Castle Garden in England, includes hedgerows fashioned from copper beech trees.\n\nMr. Raynes, the seller, is a real-estate investor and the founder of a company that specializes in historic home renovations in Miami Beach. He bought the property for about $9 million in 2008, records show, and spent several years restoring and renovating it for his own family. After moving to Florida from New York a few years ago, he found that they rarely used it, and decided to sell.\n\nMr. Grant is co-listing the property with his son Bruce Grant.\n\nWrite to Katherine Clarke at katherine.clarke@wsj.com", "description": "Known as Redcraft, the 6,700-square-foot home set on roughly 3.5 acres was built around 1870 for an heir to the Cunard shipping fortune.", "authors": ["Katherine Clarke", "Katherine.Clarke Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104022/social", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
