This evening, Trevor Noah got in on the\n\n\u201cNow, whether you like Trump or not, you have to admit this is a big win in the fight against ISIS. But Trump is the only person who can turn a unifying occasion into a dick-measuring contest,\u201d offered Noah.\n\nJohn Oliver Pours Cold Water on Trump\u2019s Baghdadi Victory Lap\n\nLouis C.K. Is Going on a Big \u2018Comeback\u2019 Tour. He Hasn\u2019t Earned His Forgiveness.\n\nThe Daily Show host then threw to Trump\u2019s Baghdadi presser, wherein the president bragged, \u201cThis is the biggest there is. This is the worst ever.

I go on vacation, and my skin is dry as fuck. That\u2019s how bad of a terrorist bin Laden was! We all ashy in these streets because of bin Laden!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole thing is ridiculous,\u201d Noah added, \u201cbecause we all know who really made this thing happen. It was that K-9,\u201d referring to the hero dog who aided (and was subsequently injured in) the Baghdadi raid. \u201cOr as I call it, a dog. That dog deserves the highest honor America has to offer, which is its own movie.\u201d\n\nNoah then aired a trailer for a saccharine comedy film starring the heroic K-9, giving him the fake-Hollywood love he so richly deserves.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
