Some stronger-than-expected economic data results from the U.K. and Germany also helped encourage investors to turn to risk assets early during Monday\u2019s session.\n\nThe U.K. economy expanded at a rate of 0.3% between June and July, according to the Office of National Statistics (ONS). This exceeded expectations of just a 0.1% monthly gain, from 0% in June, with results driven by strength in the services sector. The return to growth in July \u2013 the first month of the third quarter \u2013 suggested the country would dodge a recession, which is defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction. The U.K. economy had contracted by 0.2% in the second quarter of 2019.\n\nIn Germany, stronger-than-expected export data from July provided a brief respite after months of weak data from the eurozone\u2019s largest economy. Exports rose 0.7% month-over-month in July, on a seasonally adjusted basis, the Federal Statistical office reported, while a decline of 0.5% had been expected, according to Bloomberg-compiled expectations. However, many market pundits pointed out that ongoing trade disputes and Brexit uncertainty continue to threaten the export-reliant German economy.\n\nTraders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., September 5, 2019.

ECB President Mario Draghi earlier in the summer had said he was considering deploying stimulus measures to help boost the eurozone economy amid anemic growth and low inflation. Plus, the ECB had said in its latest policy statement that it expected to keep key interest rates at \u201ctheir present or lower levels\u201d at least through the first half of 2020. Consensus economists polled by Bloomberg expect a 10 basis point cut to the ECB deposit facility rate at the close of Thursday\u2019s meeting, bringing this down to -0.500%.\n\nSuch a move by the ECB would parallel the global monetary policy easing and stimulus measures recently unleashed by central bank around the world.\n\nOn Friday, China\u2019s central bank cut its reserve requirements for a seventh time since the start of 2018, reducing the level of reserves banks are mandated to hold and thereby freeing up funds for lending. On the heels of this decision, Chinese exports were shown to have unexpectedly declined in August, underscoring the hit taken by the world\u2019s second largest economy amid ongoing trade disputes with the U.S. Chinese exports to the U.S. fell 16% over last year in August, after declining 6.5% in July.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut benchmark interest rates by a quarter percentage point at its own meeting, marking a second consecutive rate cut after the Fed\u2019s July meeting.
