It may mean it's just a bit delayed.\"\n\n\"If people pay off their mortgages more quickly, their balance sheets get to a position they are a bit more comfortable with and then they start spending.\"", "description": "Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe has repudiated former treasurers Paul Keating and Peter Costello's view that monetary policy has \"run its race\" and is no longer effective.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2656%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_317%2C$y_192/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/e5e41a625724439021e650b43a23e6c211311eee", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
