Among those critical of Trump\u2019s decision was Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican who is often aligned with the president. He called it a \u201cdisaster in the making\u201d and \u201cshortsighted.\u201d\n\nThe Turkish lira TRYUSD, -2.4991% fell about 2.1% against the U.S. dollar on Monday. Trump in August 2018 sanctioned Turkey over the detention of an American pastor, causing the lira to slide to a record low at the time. The pastor was later released.\n\nNow see: U.S. troops start pullout from along Turkey\u2019s border in Syria.\n\nTAX CASE\n\nTrump got a reprieve Monday as a judge put on hold an order that his accounting firm must turn over eight years of his personal and business tax returns sought by Manhattan\u2019s district attorney.\n\n\u201cThe Radical Left Democrats have failed on all fronts, so now they are pushing local New York City and State Democrat prosecutors to go get President Trump,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nEarly Monday, a federal judge rejected Trump\u2019s claim to be immune from all criminal investigations and dismissed his lawsuit challenging a state grand jury subpoena for his tax returns sought by Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr., a Democrat.\n\nRead: Trump challenge to release of tax returns rejected by federal judge.\n\nAs the Associated Press writes, Trump\u2019s lawyers have said the investigation is politically motivated and the request for his tax records should be stopped because he is immune from any criminal probe as long as he is president.\n\nSign up for Trump Today and more MarketWatch newsletters.", "description": "President Donald Trump on Monday threatened Turkey\u2019s economy if the country takes what he called \u201coff limits\u201d actions, and blasted Democrats amid the latest...", "authors": ["Robert Schroeder", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HP800_trump__ZG_20190820145918.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
