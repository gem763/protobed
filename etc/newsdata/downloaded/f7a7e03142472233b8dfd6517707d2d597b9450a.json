It reminds us how small the world has become. Four implications follow from that event, and they are all important.\n\nFirst, a decision is coming for Iran, the United States and allies. The present \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign, involving sanctions against Iran, cannot be indefinite. \u201cMaximum pressure\u201d will end in one of three ways: Iran capitulating on nuclear weapons development, followed by constructive diplomacy; Iran growing more strident, violent and detached from global expectations, resulting in strikes on Iran; or regime change within. Which outcome depends on Iran, not the United States or our allies. Iran\u2019s time for decision is short. Iranians need to make up their mind.\n\nSecond, use of armed UAVs with a range of up to 900 miles to destroy Saudi critical infrastructure and impair global oil is a wake-up call for Western defense establishments. Whether this attack came from Iran, Iranian QUDs forces in Iraq or Iranian supported Yemeni rebels is academic.\n\nIt happened. What was theoretical \u2014 use of armed UAVs at great distance \u2014 is now actual. If not the V-1 or V-2 rockets of Nazi Germany, armed UAVs are a new and serious threat to civilized nations. If not hypersonic, they are still lethal.\n\nAs a result, new efforts to refine and deploy directed energy weapons, or at a minimum the equivalent of Israel\u2019s Iron Dome, will likely be accelerated regionally and globally. That layered system \u2014 not widely used outside Israel \u2014 triangulates radars, electro-optical sensors and interceptors to disable incoming projectiles; it can be used against UAVs and would be more effective with directed energy weapons.\n\nIsrael\u2019s Iron Dome \u2014 heavily financed by the United States \u2014 has destroyed 90 percent of missiles launched on Israel since 2011, more than 1,200. The likelihood is that this technology will gain currency on a wider scale \u2014 and should. Iran has turned another page, again elevating global insecurity.\n\nThird, this attack on the world\u2019s largest oil processing facility \u2014 disabling half of Saudi oil production and 5 percent of global supply \u2013 drives another point home. Whether from state-sponsors of terrorism or rogue terrorists, the world\u2019s energy supplies are vulnerable.\n\nExpanding that observation, global energy sources \u2014 oil production and refinement, shipping lanes, power grids \u2014 are an open invitation for rogue nations and actors if not prioritized, protected, hardened and made redundant.\n\nIf a handful of UAVs can knock out 5 percent of the world\u2019s oil, mining the Persian Gulf\u2019s Strait of Hormuz 20 percent, and attacks on Western power grids more, protecting critical energy infrastructure must become a top security priority.\n\nThe corollary: President Trump and Republicans in Congress are correct. U.S. energy independence has never been more important. National security \u2014 defending the nation and warfighting \u2014 are always energy dependent. The less we depend on others, the safer we are.\n\nFinally, this attack reminds us that ethnic violence \u2014 particularly in the Middle East, and more particularly between Shia and Sunni adherents, as between Arabs and Israelis \u2014 looks intractable, interminable and unstoppable. It is not.\n\nMiddle East conflict is intergenerational, integrated with geopolitics, enervating and increasingly dangerous. But it is the product of human dysfunction; humans can also undo it. That is why more attention should be given to the Trump administration\u2019s regional peace plan, rooted in the president\u2019s well-received May 2017 speech to Middle East leaders in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. It was a good speech. It is a thoughtful plan. Time is short for Iran. Time may be short for others. Iran\u2019s attack on Saudi Arabia reminds us how small the world is.\n\n\u2022 Robert B.
