Getting three new candidates through the whole vetting process could take weeks.\n\n\"We cannot longer take for granted that Ursula von der Leyen will become the next president of the European Commission and her team need an approval by a clear solid majority of the Parliament. As of today, Ursula von der Leyen has not a team, she does not have a majority supporting her political agenda,\" remarks Alberto Alemanno, Jean Monnet Professor of European Union Law and Policy, HEC Paris.\n\nAll views\n\nThis week here at Euronews we sat with a renowned Ukrainian author Andrei Kurkov to talk, Trump, Zelensky and 30 years on since the Fall of the Iron Curtain.\n\nNext week\n\nWe will have the fallout from the Polish elections, Foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg and of course that Brexit EU council meeting - tune in for the latest coverage live on TV and online in your choice of nine languages.\n\nHowever before we go, politics is normally quite a serious business - but as the Danish PM proved this week, that\u2019s not always the case.", "description": "Brexit enters a new urgent phase, while the EU slammed Turkey's offensive in Northern Syria, we round up the week in Brussels and beyond.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/40/32/1000x563_cmsv2_4b94ec61-a622-5f91-be9d-3403c13ec300-4224032.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
