The New York Federal Reserve said (link) late Tuesday that it would carry out a second overnight repo operation on Wednesday ($75 billion in repos), after Tuesday's $53 billion funding.\n\nThe actions come ahead of an important policy decision by the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee at 2 p.m. Eastern Wednesday and raises some questions about the state of Wall Street's financial plumbing, as the central bank is expected to reduce rates by a quarter of a percentage point and communicate its future monetary-policy plans to stave off the harmful effects of a Sino-American trade war and a creeping global economic slowdown.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell is slated to host a news conference a half-hour after the policy makers's decision is released.\n\n\"The Fed are tipped to lower rates, but given the US economy is broadly in good health, there is an argument the central bank should hold fire on lowering interest rates,\" wrote David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, in a daily research note. \"The US employment rate is close to a 50-year low, core [consumer-price index, a key inflation measure] is rising, plus wages are robust, so the Fed have justification for keeping rates on hold,\" he said.\n\nInvestors also have been keyed in on Middle East developments after Saudi Arabia's key oil-processing hub was momentarily hobbled over the weekend by reported drone and missile attacks.\n\nThe attack initially caused the Brent price , the international benchmark, to rise 15% on Monday, the biggest single-session rise on record dating back to 1988, but U.S. benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate grade traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, and Brent oil have been giving up much of their historic gains as Riyadh has signaled that its plans will come back on line sooner than originally feared.\n\nAnxieties around the attacks in the Arabian Peninsula have elevated tensions between the U.S. and Iran, where the drones and missiles are believed to have originated, but markets likely will focus on central bank moves over the next 24 hours absent any fresh escalation.\n\nOutside of Fed updates, investors are looking out for data on August housing starts-- the number of new homes on which construction has begun -- due at 8:30 a.m.\n\nWhich stocks are in focus?\n\nShares of FedEx Corp.(FDX) are down after the logistics group missed profit expectations (link)and cut its outlook, citing \"increasing trade tensions,\" and global economic sluggishness. Shares were down 12% in premarket action.\n\nChewy Inc.'s stock (CHWY) was off nearly 4% ahead of the bell on Wednesday after the pet retailer reported results (link).\n\nCDW Corp.'s shares (CDW) are climbing by 6% premarket on news the tech group will join the S&P 500 this month.\n\nAT&T Inc.'s stock (T)was in focus amid reports that bankers were pushing the telecom giant to unload its DirecTV unit. Shares of AT&T were off by about 0.6% in premarket trading.\n\nHow are other markets trading?\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell to 1.77% early Wednesday from 1.805% on Tuesday.\n\nRead: Saudi oil attack shows bond traders are worrying more about growth than inflation (link)\n\nGold prices gave up 0.3% to trade at $1,508.50 an ounce ahead of the Fed decision, while the U.S. dollar, as measured by the ICE U.S. Dollar Index , a gauge of the buck against a basket of leading rivals, was up 0.2%.\n\nIn Asia overnight Monday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 0.1%. China's CSI 300 Index gained 0.5% after a 1.7% drop on Tuesday, and Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 0.2%.\n\nIn Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 was trading up by 0.1%.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 18, 2019 07:22 ET (11:22 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
