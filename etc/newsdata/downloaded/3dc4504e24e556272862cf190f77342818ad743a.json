But boy did they leave it late. It was a penalty, one in added time when Sadio Mane fell theatrically under a challenge from Marc Albrighton, that preserved their unsullied start. The delighted bellow from their manager Jurgen Klopp as James Milner stroked the ball home was the very definition of what relief sounds like.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n\u201cIf winning eight games in a row is easy, people would do it all the time. It isn\u2019t easy,\u201d Klopp insisted.\n\nFor Brendan Rodgers, this represented a horrible sense of deja vu. He had stood on this very touchline in 2014 watching his chances of becoming the first Liverpool manager to win the Premier League disappear as Steven Gerrard slipped to the ground. Now he was obliged to watch another Liverpool player falling at a critical moment undermine him again.\n\n\u201cTo concede a 95th minute penalty was difficult to take. I thought we deserved something,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cIt was a very soft penalty, not clear and obvious. I think he made the most of it.\u201d\n\nLeicester had flattered to deceive on their recent trip to Old Trafford. But here was a chance for their manager to remind Liverpool supporters that he was more than just a walking endorsement for cosmetic dentistry. He arrived back on Merseyside to generous applause from the Kop, before taking a moment to shake hands with Klopp, who is his tenant at the very home on the Wirral he assumed he would be occupying for some time after taking Liverpool to second place.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut for all his self-satisfaction, Rodgers has clearly had an effect on this Leicester side. Bereft of confidence and lacking in adventure under Claude Puel, they now look organised, coherent, fluent. Particularly at the back.\n\nIn Ben Chilwell and the excellent Ricardo Pereira, they boast the second best pair of full-backs in the Premier League after Liverpool\u2019s own. And inside them, Jonny Evans provides a one-man indictment of Manchester United\u2019s recruitment and retention programme. This is the player Louis van Gaal let go to make room for Marcos Rojo which, on the evidence here at Anfield, was like trading in a Rolls Royce for a Skoda with a defective carburetor.\n\nFor nearly half an hour, this backline did what few others have managed at Anfield this season: they kept Liverpool at arms' length. A Mane shot in Kasper Schmeichel\u2019s midriff and Firmino shooting over was the closest the home side came in the early exchanges. Indeed, Mane was obliged twice to scramble back to block out Chilwell\u2019s incursions. And Dejan Lovren had to head over his own bar as a dangerous cross came in from Dennis Praet.\n\nRodgers, though, has sufficient knowledge of this place that he must have known what was coming, not least because a loud and persistent announcement arrived over the public address system: \u201cStand by for Operation Anfield\u201d. The operation consisted of Milner\u2019s superb ball down the line that put Evans in two minds. He hesitated just long enough for Mane to charge in behind him. With clear space ahead, Liverpool\u2019s number ten was not going to waver. He galloped on and fired beyond Schmeichel. It was a telling suggestion that however well you keep out Liverpool, they will find a way.\n\nBut this Leicester team were not going to be easily brushed aside. Throughout the second half, they kept pushing, kept probing, kept trying. Jamie Vardy was played in by the substitute Albrighton but Adrian reached the ball first; Praet then put a fizzing shot just wide; and then James Maddison, who could find space in a Central Line train at rush hour, conjured up the best of their opportunities, putting in a superb cross which somehow evaded the leaping Vardy.\n\nOne of the few Premier League players beyond the confines of Manchester City who would not look out of place in a Liverpool shirt, Maddison finally made the difference for the visitors. The substitute Ayoze Perez played him in behind the Liverpool back line; he took a stride and fired beyond Adrian\u2019s legs. Calm, certain, precise, the England playmaker applied a finish of the most confident sort. The noise you heard as the ball hit the back of the net was the sound of Gareth Southgate purring.\n\nLiverpool, sensing their record of victories, stretching back to last season, was about to be spoiled, poured forward. Corner after corner was won. The Leicester substitute Hamza Choudhury then brought down Salah with a tackle that enraged Klopp. (\u201cIt was dangerous as hell. The boy has to calm down.\u201d) But Alexander-Arnold\u2019s free-kick went too long. Even with Salah hobbling into injury time, Liverpool kept trying, kept probing. In the crowd, the nerves were beginning sound. But eventually reward came, albeit in the most fortunate of circumstance. Albrighton stole the ball off the substitute Divock Origi in midfield but it span back into the Leicester box. Mane charged onto it, Albrighton seeking to make amends had dashed back and seemed to make contact, encouraging the Liverpool man to fly to the turf. After the obligatory VAR delay, Milner stepped up, and sent Schmeichel the wrong way.\n\nMoments later, the whistle went and Liverpool\u2019s exuberent celebrations seemed to atagonise their opponents, not least Perez who sought to confront Andy Robertson in a lengthy scuffle. Not that the Liverpool manager dialled down his own reactions. Klopp couldn\u2019t have looked happier if he had just been let off the rent on his mansion, though judging by the look on his landlord\u2019s face, that wasn\u2019t about to happen.\n\nMeanwhile, Leicester have said they are \"appalled\" at racist comments directed towards midfielder Choudhury on social media on Saturday evening.\n\nThe 22-year-old has been hit with a torrent of racist abuse following a tackle that injured Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah during the Foxes' 2-1 defeat at Anfield.\n\nA Leicester spokesman said: \"We are appalled by these comments, which the club has reported to the police and to the social media platform on which they were made.\n\n\"Discriminatory behaviour has no place in football or in society and we will seek the strongest possible course of action to be taken against those responsible.\"\n\n4:57PM\n\nFT: Liverpool 2 Leicester 1\n\nLeicester throw a few crosses into the box, but Liverpool deal with it and that's the final whistle! It's all kicking off on the pitch, looked like Perez and Lallana were at the centre off some argie bargie but Liverpool will not give a stuff. They win again and pile the pressure on City. A sickener for Leicester but they were competitive.\n\n4:55PM\n\nMilner scores!\n\nJames Milner steps up and buries the penalty - surely 17 wins in a row for Liverpool! He gives it the arms crossed Mbappe celebration and Klopp and the rest of Anfield are going mental. 2-1 Liverpool in the 94th minute.\n\nCredit: Reuters\n\n4:53PM\n\nPenalty Liverpool\n\nShort stoppage here as Salah is down holding his shin. He limps to the sidelines and Lallana is on now.\n\nOrigi charges forward and the ball breaks free in the box.....PENALTY LIVERPOOL! The referee points to the spot after Albrighton clips the heels of Mane. There was contact but he threw himself forward. VAR checks it, but it is not a clear and obvious mistake and Liverpool have the chance to win it.\n\nCredit: Getty Images\n\n4:49PM\n\n89 minutes: Liverpool 1 Leicester 1\n\nChoudhury's turn this time to give away a needless foul, hacks Salah down from behind. 30 yards out, level with the right-hand side of the box. Poor delivery by Alexander-Arnold this time though, as the ball runs out fro a goal kick. 90 minutes almost up....four minutes of added time.\n\n4:47PM\n\n87 minutes: Liverpool 1 Leicester 1\n\nRicardo gets too tight to Origi and conceded a free kick wide on the left flank, level with the edge of the penalty area. Very good delivery again by Robertson but Ndidi stands firm to head clear.\n\n4:45PM\n\n85 minutes: Liverpool 1 Leicester 1\n\nOrigi, who has had a real impact off the bench in recent weeks, dribbles down the left and wins a corner. Lovren almost gets his head to it, but Ricardo nods it behind for another corner.\n\nAnother wicked TAA delivery but then Van Dijk heads over. Maddison off for Leicester, Choudhury on. That's a signal of their intentions, a draw is a great result.\n\n4:42PM\n\n82 minutes: Liverpool 1 Leicester 1\n\nWhat a finale we are in for now. That Leicester goal was the apotheosis of their new philosophy under Rodgers, they kept the ball so well and probed patiently.\n\n4:41PM\n\nLeicester jubilant\n\nGreat work from Ayoze P\u00e9rez to play Madders in and he fired past Adri\u00e1n!\n\n\n\n\ufffd\ufffd minutes to go at Anfield.#LivLeipic.twitter.com/TNAxNP4sFd\n\n\n\n\u2014 Leicester City (@LCFC) October 5, 2019\n\n4:40PM\n\nGOAL! Leicester equalise through Maddison\n\nWhat a fantastic move that was, even if its conclusion involved a goalkeeping error. Leicester kept the ball for almost two minutes, a few dozen passes right from the back, and Perez finds a pocket of space between the lines. Slips a ball down the sides of the centre-backs and Maddison drives one low, underneath Adrian.\n\n4:38PM\n\n77 minutes: Liverpool 1 Leicester 0\n\nLeicester starting to see more and more off the ball and there is tension at Anfield, but no clear cut chances. Two changes from Klopp, Origi and Henderson replace Firmino and Wijnaldum.\n\n4:32PM\n\n73 minutes: Liverpool 1 Leicester 0\n\nGame starting to get stretched now as Leicester commit bodies forward. Nice feet from Firmino to feed Salah at the edge of the penalty area but the ball does not come under his spell and Evans wins it again.\n\nLeicester on the front foot down the left, cross comes in, Fabinho stabs it clear but Praet meets it with a rasping strike from 25 yards. Low and whistles past the far post. That was his final act - Ayoze Perez on.\n\n4:30PM\n\n70 minutes: Liverpool 1 Leicester 0\n\nGood industry and silk from Maddison but he goes down to easily looking for a penalty in the Liverpool box. Chilweel swings a cross in but Adrian takes it with ease.\n\n4:27PM\n\n67 minutes: Liverpool 1 Leicester 0\n\nSchmeichel gathers a long diagonal from Robertson. Oooooh, was that the moment for Leicester? Much like Milner for Liverpool's goal, Albrighton curls a 40 yard pass in behind the Liverpool defence for Vardy to gallop on to but his second touch is just too heavy and Adrian smothers at his feet. Better touch and he would have had a shot from 10 yards, one on one with the 'keeper.\n\nLiverpool threaten at the other end, Robertson shoots from a tight angle but Schmeichel beats it away.\n\n4:24PM\n\n64 minutes: Liverpool 1 Leicester 0\n\nSuch great tracking from Milner with Robertson caught up field and Liverpool snuff out another Leicester break.\n\nSalah and Robertson link up well but Jonny Evans stands firm to clear. Back it comes, and Firmino shoots narrowly wide of the far post after an exquisite first touch.\n\n4:20PM\n\n61 minutes: Liverpool 1 Leicester 0\n\nExcellent cross from Maddison from the right, and Alexander-Arnold skews behind while facing his own goal. Van Dijk heads the corner away and TAA leads the counter-attacking charge down the left.\n\nComes to nothing, but Liverpool are camped in the Leicester half again.\n\n4:17PM\n\n59 minutes: Liverpool 1 Leicester 0\n\nLeicester took a while to get going in the first half, they might warm to their task as the game wears on. Rare bad touch from Mane enables Leicester to attack through Maddison but another moves breaks down at the edfe of the box. Alrbighton wins a corner off Robertson though in the next phase of play.\n\n4:16PM\n\n56 minutes: Liverpool 1 Leicester 0\n\nFabinho is really growing in influence here, stopping Leicester attacks at source. Not that it's proving too difficult, the visitors are yet to have a shot on goal.\n\nOooooh, that's brilliant from Mane and Salah, one-twoing their way into the box in a way reminiscent of Yorke and Cole at the Nou Camp for Man Utd. Evans just gets a toe in to prevent a near-certain goal.\n\n4:13PM\n\n54 minutes: Liverpool 1 Leicester 0\n\nAlexander-Arnold hooks a long ball forward for Salah, who shows bullish strength to pack into Soyuncu. Turns him inside out and wins a free kick close to the edge of the box after the Leicester defenders holds on to his shirt. Similar to David Luiz against Salah a few games back, but outside the box.\n\nSalah takes the free kick but it clips the top of the wall.\n\n4:11PM\n\n52 minutes: Liverpool 1 Leicester 0\n\nLeicester playing out of pressure in their own box, but the cannot build the game through midfield. Story of their afternoon so far, Rodgers will be thinking about changes.\n\nRobertson pulled up for a foul on Albrighton but Liverpool defend the cross well.\n\nFabinho stops a Pereira foray forward before Van Dijk has a dribble through midfield and Ndidi is penalised. That was harsh. The Liverpool man had overrun it and he stood on Ndidi.\n\n4:07PM\n\n49 minutes: Liverpool 1 Leicester 0\n\nLiverpool on the break again with Mane on the right who switches the play to Firmino on the left. Good challenge by Evans but Liverpool have it back.\n\nAlmost a mix-up between Schmeichel and Soyuncu at the edge of the box, but the keeper clears at the second attempt after a brief fumble.\n\n4:05PM\n\n47 minutes: Liverpool 1 Leicester 0\n\nTerrific save by Schmeichel to keep Leicester in the game - Alexander-Arnold's cross was met by Salah on the stretch at pointblank range but the 'keeper got a hand to it. Great reflexes.\n\n4:04PM\n\nBack under way!\n\nLiverpool kick off for the second half.\n\n3:52PM\n\nGreat picture that...\n\nCredit: Reuters\n\n3:50PM\n\nHT: Liverpool 1 Leicester 0\n\nMane's goal the difference at the end of a fairly even first period.\n\n3:50PM\n\n45+1 minutes: Liverpool 1 Leicester 0\n\nThat could be a big moment in this game, Vardy looked to have found a yard for a shot in the Liverpool area - in the left channel about eight yards out but he tried to check back on his right. Lovren got the block in. Leicester have one final chance to counter, but Robertson beats Praet in a foot race.\n\n3:47PM\n\n45 minutes: Liverpool 1 Leicester 0\n\nDangerous, dangerous times for Leicester. Milner gets down the left and finds the goalscorer Mane with a cut-back, but he was reaching for it with his right foot and his stabbed shot rolls straight to Schmeichel. Perhaps he could have overed it for Salah to run on to.\n\nA minute or so later, Salah lays one off for Milner to strike from 25 yards but he cannot keep it down. Two minutes added on.\n\n3:46PM\n\n43 minutes: Liverpool 1 Leicester 0\n\nNow the spaces might start to open for Liverpool. Leicester have not played badly, they have defended as well as any team will at Anfield this season. But you feel they needed the first goal to throw the game into some chaos. Liverpool are so strong with their noses in front, especially at home.\n\n3:44PM\n\nGOAL! Liverpool lead\n\nJust as Leicester were starting to look comfortable. That's a fantastic pass from Milner - with Ricardo high up the pitch he curls one with his left foot in behind Evans who cannot reach it on the stretch. Mane can though, and clean through, one on one with Schmeichel he rolls it into the far corner. Such composure, great goal.\n\n3:42PM\n\n40 minutes: Liverpool 0 Leicester 0\n\nLeicester getting back behind the ball and defending in numbers, Tielemans in particular working really hard.\n\nAll aboard the show-boat....Maddison nutmegs Fabinho who cynically brings him down to prevent a Leicester counter. Yellow card.\n\n3:41PM\n\n38 minutes: Liverpool 0 Leicester 0\n\nMaddison over it, and he picks out Soyuncu who has a free header eight yards out! Great save by Adrian, but the flag was up anyway. Liverpool disciplined in holding a high line from that free kick.\n\n3:39PM\n\n36 minutes: Liverpool 0 Leicester 0\n\nLeicester's best passage of the game. Tielemans finds a pocket in the left-half space to play in Chilwell on the overlap but his low cross is cleared by Alexander-Arnold. Leicester have a corner. The Liverpool defender's studs caught Tielemans on the achilles...that looked nasty. VAR checking. Not sure it was intentional but it was a heavy blow. No red card.\n\nCorner bounces all over the place and Leicester then win a free kick around 30 yards out, left of centre. Great spell by Leicester.\n\n3:36PM\n\n34 minutes: Liverpool 0 Leicester 0\n\nThey looked to have swapped back again now. Ooooh, what a great chance for Firmino! Alexander-Arnold wastes not time whipping in a brilliant cross from deep, sent in with pace and dip, but on the bounce Firmino cannot keep his effort down. No more than six yards out.\n\n3:34PM\n\n32 minutes: Liverpool 0 Leicester 0\n\nLooks like Liverpool have done something different today, with Mane playing on the right. Is it to keep tabs of Chilwell's bursts forward? Mane is certainly a better defender than Salah. The Egyptian is operating in the left half-space at present and he wins a free kick near halfway from Evans.\n\n3:32PM\n\n30 minutes: Liverpool 0 Leicester 0\n\nGood advantage played after Ndidi flattened Milner in the middle of the park because Mane is running straight at the Leicester back four. They back off, and he lets fly from 25 yards or so but his shot is straight at Schmeichel. Referee goes back and books Ndidi.\n\n3:31PM\n\n28 minutes: Liverpool 0 Leicester 0\n\nThis time is is Evans' turn to head over his own goal after Alexander-Arnold chases a lost cause and hooks a cross in on the stretch. He has been impressive so far, as he tends to be.\n\nDangerous delivery but Periera heads away. Good defending from Evans up against Salah, touch tonight and preventing the forward from gathering the ball.\n\n3:28PM\n\n26 minutes: Liverpool 0 Leicester 0\n\nMaddison finds room to wriggle free, but another move breaks down. Precious little goal mouth action so far. Good persistence from Praet to counter-press Milner and win Leicester a corner.\n\nBoth centre-halves up, but the corner is cleared. Much more danger on the second phase as Liverpool push out, Praet whips in the cross and Lovren heads over his crossbar. Leicester work a short one, but Mane makes a crunching tackle on Chilwell to end the move. Brilliantly timed.\n\n3:25PM\n\n23 minutes: Liverpool 0 Leicester 0\n\nOne thing this Leicester team lack compared to the 2016 side is a secondary goal threat to support Vardy. Riyad Mahrez was unbelievable that year, and they do not quite have anyone of that calibre. Gray and Barnes are still learning the game, Perez is decent but not quite tip top. When you think they are competing against teams with Aubameyang-Lacazette, Kane-Son, Rashford-Martial, it might be where they just fall short.\n\nTielemans takes a chance dwelling on the ball on the edge of his own box with Mane lurking, but wins the foul.\n\n3:22PM\n\n20 minutes: Liverpool 0 Leicester 0\n\nGreat pressing from Liverpool and Chilwell can only hack it out for a throw in but they survive again.\n\nEvans also mis-places a long diagonal, their quality on the ball has not been great so far Leicester. But they are looking fairly solid.\n\n3:19PM\n\n18 minutes: Liverpool 0 Leicester 0\n\nFabinho goes all the way back to Adrian, and then a moment of sloppiness as Milner's pass in midfield is cut out by Maddison. Lots of space for Vardy to run into and Maddison looked for him with one of those outside of the foot through balls but intercepted by Lovren.\n\nLiverpool get back on the front foot, but Soyuncu and Evans are dropping off and reading things well. Not getting sucked in trying to nick the ball.\n\n3:17PM\n\n16 minutes: Liverpool 0 Leicester 0\n\nLeicester keeping it better between Ndidi and the centre-backs, enables Pereira time to get forward down the right. He picks out Vardy inside who fires a first time pass around the corner for Barnes, whose cross is cleared by Alexander-Arnold. Nice move, but no shot on the end of it.\n\n3:15PM\n\n14 minutes: Liverpool 0 Leicester 0\n\nOooooh, that's the first chance of the game and it falls to Milner. A strange move, Ndidi's clearance bounces off the corner flag back into Alexander-Arnold's path who throws in a nutmeg and stands a ball up to the back stick. Milner meets it on the volley but it flies over the bar.\n\n13' Fantastic from @trentaa98 who takes on Chilwell before crossing deep towards the back post. @JamesMilner arrives but his volley is high over the crossbar.\n\n\n\n[0-0]#LIVLEIpic.twitter.com/1tvFK6qZTs\n\n\n\n\u2014 Liverpool FC (@LFC) October 5, 2019\n\n3:14PM\n\n12 minutes: Liverpool 0 Leicester 0\n\nThat was better from the visitors, even if the move did not go anywhere. Their first real spell of the game keeping the ball in Liverpool territory. Some good defending from Van Dijk brought it to an end.\n\n3:12PM\n\n10 minutes: Liverpool 0 Leicester 0\n\nLiverpool in control of possession and getting Robertson and TAA into good areas. Nothing is sticking for Leicester and the ball keeps coming right back at them. Need Maddison to just put his foot on it and slow things down.\n\nSoyuncu with another loose pass into midfield that is cut out. He was under no pressure there, that should have been a chance for Leicester to take a breather.\n\n3:10PM\n\n8 minutes: Liverpool 0 Leicester 0\n\nKeep things tight and get through the first 20 minutes unscathed will be the idea from Leicester and they do look in a good defensive shape in the early stages.\n\nGreat work from Robertson to drive past Pereira, but Soyuncu heads away before the cross reaches Salah. Then it's the other full-back Alexander-Arnold getting to the line and winning a corner. Lovren flicks on to no one at the near post. Evans clears.\n\n3:07PM\n\n6 minutes: Liverpool 0 Leicester 0\n\nSalah flagged for offside, but he has been the most involved of Liverpool's front three. Like many a visiting team at Anfield, Leicester are struggling to sustain spells of possession. This time Evans is the offender with an aimless long ball. Schmeichel comes and claims a poor Alexander-Arnold cross.\n\n3:06PM\n\n4 minutes: Liverpool 0 Leicester 0\n\nMaddison tries to release Vardy with a backheel but it does not quite come off, before Liverpool try to send Salah over the top. Soyuncu shows a good turn of foot to cut it out, but Liverpool regain possession and attack again - this time Salah cuts in on his left foot but his shot is straight at Schmeichel.\n\n3:04PM\n\n2 minutes: Liverpool 0 Leicester 0\n\nIt is a 4-1-4-1 shape for Leicester early on with Ndidi the defensive screen. Commentators suggest Leicester might just be a top six team, rather than top four, but I'm not really sure why they need to distinguish? Below City and Liverpool it's a rabble and everything is up for grabs.\n\nLiverpool's defenders getting some early touches but not much of note in the first few minutes.\n\n3:02PM\n\nKICK OFF!\n\nGreat reception for Rodgers from the Liverpool fans. You can afford magnanimity when the next guy in post takes you to the Champions League final.\n\nLiverpool get us under way, kicking towards the Kop.\n\n2:58PM\n\nTeams on their way out at Anfield\n\nHere we ago, almost time for the highlight of the Premier League weekend. Really hoping this has all the tension and weightiness of a proper top-four meeting. Much will depend on how Leicester start.\n\n2:41PM\n\nWarm-ups\n\nCredit: Reuters\n\n2:36PM\n\nKlopp full of praise for Rodgers before the game\n\n\"If one day the club has to make a decision that would not say anything about me at that moment. Brendan reached the level he reached - Chelsea assistant, Swansea manager, Liverpool manager - very young, then going to Celtic and being very successful. Going to Leicester just proves what I thought. I am not a bit surprised.\u201d\n\n2:22PM\n\nTeam news analysed\n\nKlopp likes to keep things fresh by rotating his No 8s, so James Milner comes in for Jordan Henderson to try and maintain the intensity levels. More surprising is his decision to favour Dejan Lovren over Joe Gomez after a public show of support for the young defender. The classic tactic of protection in public and something sterner behind closed doors, perhaps.\n\nRodgers looks to be approaching this one positively with Youri Tielemans starting in a deeper midfield role with ball-winner Hamza Choudhury on the bench. He might sit next to Ndidi, or it might be Tielemans and Maddison in front of the Nigerian in more of a 4-1-4-1. Barnes and Praet start on the flanks.\n\n2:02PM\n\nLeicester team news: An attacking midfield with Hamza Choudhury on the bench\n\n#LivLei team news brought to you by @eToro \ufffd\ufffd \u2014 Leicester City (@LCFC) October 5, 2019\n\n2:01PM\n\nLiverpool team news: Lovren replaces Joe Gomez\n\n1:57PM\n\nThe fortress...\n\n12:58PM\n\nThe game of the weekend...\n\nIs this the biggest test Liverpool have faced this season? Certainly the bookmakers are assessing Leicester City as a genuine top six team, making them the same price as Arsenal when they visited Anfield in August.\n\nIts also Brendan Rodgers back at Liverpool, and he returns a wiser, more self-aware and generally well-respected manager who is building a very solid and balanced side.\n\nLeicester are buoyant after vanquishing Spurs and hammering Newcastle 5-0, but perhaps their attack is not as potent as many assume. They sit 15th in the division for shots on target and eight for Expected Goals mustered so the doubt over them today is whether they can sufficiently trouble Liverpool's defence.\n\nJurgen Klopp's team might just be a touch more circumspect after conceding three at home to Red Bull Salzburg, although first-choice centre-back Joel Matip is out through injury. Joe Gomez has looked suspect so far this season, relying too much on his athleticism at the expense of a sound starting position which might be something Jamie Vardy looks to prey on.\n\nLeicester do look a sounder defensive unit than Arsenal, Chelsea and Spurs currently with a back four of Ricardo Perreira, Jonny Evans, \u00c7a\u011flar S\u00f6y\u00fcnc\u00fc and Ben Chilwell well protected by Wilfred Ndidi. Liverpool's effervescent front three will stretch them though.\n\nSpeaking of Rodgers' return, Klopp said: \"I hope the fans will be OK with [Rodgers].\n\n\"It is brilliant living there [in Rodgers' house]. I am not sure he has to work. He is doing really well. I am not surprised about that. An incredible job at Celtic, rebuilding at Leicester. Good signings and brilliant team.\"\n\nRodgers added: \"I am the type of person who is happy for the club and especially happy for players like Jordan [Henderson] and James Milner - players I worked with and had a strong relationship with.\n\n\"I was so happy for Jordan when he lifted the Champions League trophy because I know how much he has developed and worked for it.\"\n\nTeam news on the way shortly.", "description": "Liverpool march on, reaching the second international break still in retention of the only 100 per cent record in the top four divisions.
