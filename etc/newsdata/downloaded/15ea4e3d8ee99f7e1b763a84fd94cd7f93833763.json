The law was revised in 2013 to include \u201ccookies,\u201d used to track a person\u2019s internet viewing habits.\n\nIt is also small compared with the company\u2019s revenues. Alphabet, which generates about 85% of its revenue from sales of ad space and ad technology, in July reported total second-quarter revenue of $38.9 billion.\n\nYouTube said in a statement on Wednesday that in four months it would begin treating all data collected from people watching children\u2019s content as if it came from a child. \u201cThis means that we will limit data collection and use on videos made for kids only to what is needed to support the operation of the service,\u201d YouTube said on its blog.\n\nIn addition to the monetary fine, the proposed settlement requires the company to create a system for identifying content aimed at children and to notify channel owners about their obligations to get consent from parents before collecting information on children.\n\nFTC Chairman Joe Simons noted at a news conference on Wednesday what he said were important changes to YouTube business practices. \u201cNo other company in America is subject to these types of requirements and they will impose significant costs on YouTube,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nFTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection director Andrew Smith told reporters that the $170 million settlement was based on revenues from data collected, times a multiplier. \u201cIt happens that $170 million is roughly the budget of the Bureau of Consumer Protection for one year,\u201d he added.\n\nOnce the settlement takes effect, the FTC plans to \u201cconduct a sweep of the YouTube platform to determine whether there remains child-directed content\u201d in which personal information is being collected, Smith said.\n\nThe FTC could take actions against individual content creators or channel owners as a result.\n\nIn late August, YouTube announced it would launch YouTube Kids with separate niches for children depending on their ages and designed to exclude disturbing videos. It has no behavioral advertising.\n\nYouTube allows companies to create channels, which include advertisements that create revenue for both the company and YouTube.\n\nIn its complaint, the government said that YouTube touted its popularity with children in marketing itself to companies like Mattel and Hasbro. It told Mattel that \u201cYouTube is today\u2019s leader in reaching children age 6-11 against top TV channels,\u201d according to the complaint.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James said the companies \u201cabused their power.\u201d\n\n\u201cGoogle and YouTube knowingly and illegally monitored, tracked, and served targeted ads to young children just to keep advertising dollars rolling in,\u201d said James.\n\nSilhouettes of mobile device users are seen next to a screen projection of Youtube logo in this picture illustration taken March 28, 2018. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\n\nThe two Democrats on the FTC, Rebecca Slaughter and Rohit Chopra, dissented from the settlement. Slaughter, who called the violations \u201cwidespread and brazen,\u201d said the settlement fails to require YouTube to police channels that provide children\u2019s content but do not designate it as such, thus allowing more lucrative behavioral advertising, which relies on tracking viewers through cookies.\n\nSenators Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal, both Democrats active in online privacy matters, criticized the settlement in separate statements.\n\n\u201cA financial settlement is no substitute for strict reforms that will stop Google and other tech companies from invading our privacy,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cI continue to be alarmed by Big Tech\u2019s policies and practices that invade children\u2019s lives.\u201d", "description": "Google, which is owned by Alphabet Inc, and its YouTube video service will pay $170 million to settle allegations that it broke federal law by collecting personal information about children, the Federal Trade Commission said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Diane Bartz", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426153775&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8317W"}
