Both teams are relying on their heavyweights to settle it.\n\nRealistically, South Africa and Italy both need to win to stay in contention at the World Cup when they play in Pool B on Friday.\n\nTwo-time winner South Africa will be heading for a group-stage exit for the first time ever if it loses. An Italy win would put the Azzurri through to the quarterfinals for the first time.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret it\u2019s all on the line.\n\nGone is any talk of open, running rugby. The focus is on what\u2019s expected to be an attritional forward contest. And the dropped goal is back in the reckoning, as it often is in high-stakes games at the Rugby World Cup.\n\nSouth Africa and Italy will take a win any way they can in Shizuoka.\n\n\u201cFor us, this is a crunch game,\u201d Springboks coach Rassie Erasmus said. \u201cAnd if we have to grind it out, this is a do-or-die game. Just beat Italy no matter how, even if it\u2019s just a drop goal.\n\n\u201cWe want to get out of the pool. The win is the ultimate.\u201d\n\nThe Italians have the same philosophy.\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t front up physically against South Africa, you\u2019ve already lost the match,\u201d Italy coach Conor O\u2019Shea said. \u201cYou must take them on in the forwards. We must treat it like the last match we\u2019ll ever play.\u201d\n\nThe weather, with rain a possibility around Shizuoka Prefecture on Japan\u2019s Pacific coast, only nails down the theory that this meeting will be won in the tight exchanges.\n\nErasmus and O\u2019Shea can\u2019t have been clearer on their matching approaches. Of course, that could just be talk and there may be some misdirection. But they have both put their money where their mouth is.\n\nBoth coaches loaded their benches with big men. Both have six forwards and just two backs in the reserves to underline how decisive the heavy artillery may be. Italy nearly went for more big units.\n\n\u201cWe did think about going with an 8-0 split (on the bench) but that would have been a bit over the top,\u201d O\u2019Shea said.\n\nBut that forward focus has also left both lineups light in backline options, and that will require some juggling if either team has injuries there. It\u2019s a risk both are willing to take to get the advantage up front.\n\nSouth Africa has just scrumhalf Herschel Jantjies and utility Frans Steyn as its backs on the bench. Italy has scrumhalf Callum Braley and flyhalf Carlo Canna as backup.\n\nO\u2019Shea did select center Michele Campagnaro on the wing to give his team some versatility if needed. Erasmus said he\u2019d have to get \u201ccreative\u201d if he had issues in the backs. He even raised the possibility of scrumhalf Faf de Klerk playing flyhalf in an emergency.\n\nNo. 8 Sergio Parisse is back to captain Italy in the most significant team news after missing the victory over Canada. He\u2019ll scoop up another record. Parisse is already playing in a record-equaling fifth Rugby World Cup. He\u2019ll become the most capped northern hemisphere player when he runs out at Shizuoka Stadium, overtaking Ireland center Brian O\u2019Driscoll\u2019s 141 test caps. Only former New Zealand captain Richie McCaw (148) has played more tests.\n\nThis is the 36-year-old Parisse\u2019s last World Cup, so expect everything from the inspirational skipper in an effort to get Italy to the quarterfinals for the first time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve thought about this (game) for four years,\u201d Parisse said. \u201cWe want to be competitive to the end. We don\u2019t have the pressure on us. They are the ones who will be feeling the pressure \u2026 We just want to go out and not finish the match with any regrets.\u201d\n\n___\n\nLineups:\n\nSouth Africa: Willie le Roux, Cheslin Kolbe, Lukhanyo Am, Damian de Allende, Makazole Mapimpi, Handr\u00e9 Pollard, Faf de Klerk; Duane Vermeulen, Pieter-Steph du Toit, Siya Kolisi (captain), Lood de Jager, Eben Etzebeth, Frans Malherbe, Bongi Mbonambi, Tendai Mtawarira.
