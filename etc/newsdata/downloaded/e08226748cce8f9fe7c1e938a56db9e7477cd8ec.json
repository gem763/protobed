The hours in which we work, rest, and socialize are becoming ever more desynchronized.\n\nWhereas we once shared the same temporal rhythms\u2014five days on, two days off, federal holidays, thank-God-it\u2019s-Fridays\u2014our weeks are now shaped by the unpredictable dictates of our employers. Nearly a fifth of Americans hold jobs with nonstandard or variable hours. They may work seasonally, on rotating shifts, or in the gig economy driving for Uber or delivering for Postmates. Meanwhile, more people on the upper end of the pay scale are working long hours. Combine the people who have unpredictable workweeks with those who have prolonged ones, and you get a good third of the American labor force.\n\nThe personalization of time may seem like a petty concern, and indeed some people consider it liberating to set their own hours or spend their \u201cfree\u201d time reaching for the brass ring. But the consequences could be debilitating for the U.S. in the same way they once were for the U.S.S.R. A calendar is more than the organization of days and months. It\u2019s the blueprint for a shared life.", "description": "", "authors": ["Judith Shulevitz", "Theatlantic.Com Magazine Archive Why-Dont-I-See-You-Anymore"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
