But Turkey considers some of them to be militants linked to outlawed Kurdish rebels within Turkey who have for years waged a campaign of terror aimed at securing their autonomy from Ankara.\n\nWho are the Kurds?: A Middle Eastern people with 'no friends but the mountains'\n\nTrump has threatened to punish Turkey economically if it does \"anything outside of what we think is humane.\" However, both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have condemned Trump's actions, arguing that it not only poses a threat to a key U.S. ally but endangers the campaign against the Islamic State.\n\nSyria's Kurds have also been running detention centers in the region that are holding thousands of former Islamic State militants and their families.\n\nIn a statement late Tuesday, the General Command of the Syrian Defense Forces \u2014 the group that's been working with U.S. troops \u2014 said the border areas of northeast Syria \"are on the edge of a possible humanitarian catastrophe ... This attack will spill the blood of thousands of innocent civilians because our border areas are overcrowded.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Turkey's Syria offensive imminent after Trump pulls U.S. troops back", "description": "Turkey was on the brink of launching an offensive into\u00a0Kurdish parts of Syria, days after\u00a0President Donald Trump announced U.S. troops would withdraw.", "authors": ["Kim Hjelmgaard", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/lGkA.8RqInd96HkJq3LQeA--~B/aD0zNDU2O3c9NTE4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/bf54b857522d80a193190a428b7cfa22", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
