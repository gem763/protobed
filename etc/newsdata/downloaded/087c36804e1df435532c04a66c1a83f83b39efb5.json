Could Trump be different?", "language": "en", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nThe U.S. trade war with China. Growing fears of recession. A feeble global economy.\n\nAnd now \u2014 impeachment?\n\nThe Sept. 24 launch of an impeachment inquiry into President Trump tosses another wildcard into a volatile stock market that lost ground last week on the deepening troubles of American manufacturers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the cocktail that gets everybody on edge,\u201d says Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial. \u201cThe market hates uncertainty.\u201d\n\nWhen Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the start of an impeachment inquiry against Trump, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index fell 0.8% but partly recovered the following day. Detrick says the investigation likely contributed to the initial dip. But other news also may have played a role, including a pullback in consumer confidence and Trump\u2019s United Nations speech, which adopted a tougher stance on a U.S.-China trade deal.\n\nSince then, stocks tumbled early last week on signs that U.S. manufacturing has slumped amid Trump's trade war with China and sluggish growth overseas. The market climbed back Friday after a report revealed slowing but still solid job growth in September while preserving hopes the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates again this month to head off a recession.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with the president doesn\u2019t seem to be affecting markets,\u201d says Art Hogan, chief market strategist for National Securities. \u201cIt\u2019s the economy\u201d that matters.\n\nYet will the specter of impeachment become another downer for stocks as the House investigation and hearings play out in the coming months?\n\nIf the two most recent impeachment probes of U.S. presidents offer a guide, the answer is probably not. In both cases, the economy \u2014 one dismal, one robust \u2014 steered markets.\n\nSimmer down:Fall's here, and so is the struggle to control your heating bill. Here's how you can try.\n\nYet this time may be different because Trump has rooted his agenda in pro-business policies that could be rolled back if he\u2019s removed from office or if impeachment damages his reelection chances, says Michael Reynolds, investment strategy officer for Glenmede, an investment and wealth management firm.\n\nThere have been three impeachment probes of U.S. presidents \u2013 Andrew Johnson in 1868, Richard Nixon in 1973-74 and Bill Clinton in 1998-99. Both Johnson and Clinton were impeached by the House but not removed from office by the Senate. Nixon resigned before his near-certain impeachment and removal.\n\nStock data from 1868 is sketchy and, in any case, show little impact from Johnson\u2019s impeachment in February, according to Stock Trader\u2019s Almanac and Schroders, an asset management firm.\n\nSo let\u2019s focus on the Nixon and Clinton scenarios:\n\nNixon\n\nAt first blush, the Nixon impeachment proceedings appear to have moved markets. The inquiry, tied to the break-in of the Democratic national headquarters at the Watergate hotel, was announced Oct. 30, 1973. The Standard & Poor's 500 fell 11% the following month, 15.6% in six months and 33.4% over 12 months, according to LPL Financial.\n\nBut wait. The Arab oil embargo also began in October, driving crude and gasoline prices higher. Inflation was rampant. A recession began in November. And the Federal Reserve was sharply raising interest rates to rein in inflation \u2013 a surefire wet blanket for markets.\n\n\u201cThe economy was just dreadful,\u201d Hogan says. That, he says \u2014 not the travails of Nixon, who resigned in August 1974 \u2014 is what sent stocks lower.\n\nBig bucks:Forbes 400: Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett remain the richest people in the US\n\nClinton\n\nClinton\u2019s troubles, based on charges that he lied under oath to hide an affair, similarly seemed to douse stocks. In the two months leading up to independent counsel Ken Starr\u2019s report to Congress in September 1998, the S&P 500 fell as much as 20%. But again, other forces were roiling markets in that period, particularly a Russian currency meltdown and the near-collapse of Long-term Capital Management, a massive hedge fund whose demise could have set off a global financial crisis.\n\nThose developments, not the Clinton scandal, were the culprits, Hogan and Reynolds say.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, after the Clinton impeachment inquiry began on October 8, 1998, the S&P 500 rose 18.9% within a month, 41.6% in six months and 39.2% in a year, LPL figures show. Don\u2019t credit Clinton\u2019s acquittal by the Senate on February 12, 1999. Rather, stocks were riding a long bull market juiced by the late 1990s technology and productivity booms, the analysts say.\n\nTrump\n\nMarkets today have swung wildly in response to developments in the trade war, Federal Reserve interest rate cuts and the prospects of a recession. That dynamic is likely to persist, Detrick says, with the impeachment drama adding to some market volatility on certain days but playing a relatively minor role.\n\nReynolds believes the impact of the Trump impeachment inquiry could be bigger because his tax cuts and sweeping deregulation have had a significant impact on the economy and corporate earnings. Investors could worry that some of those changes may be reversed if Trump is removed from office, paving the way for a Democratic victory in the 2020 election.\n\nEven if Trump is impeached but acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate, the proceedings could doom his re-election bid, Reynolds says. That prospect, he says, may spook some investors, particularly if the Democratic nominee is Elizabeth Warren, who has called for tax hikes on businesses and the wealthy as well as Medicare for all and free tuition at public universities.\n\n\"You have to start pricing in that an alternative political paradigm could be a real possibility,\" Reynolds says.\n\nAt the same time, an impeachment viewed by Republican and independent voters as unfair could help propel Trump to victory.\n\nOverall, Hogan and Detrick are less concerned about the impact a Democrat in the White House may have on markets. Investors dreaded the possibility of a Trump presidency until he won and ignited a market boom, Hogan says. And Warren\u2019s agenda likely would be tempered by a politically divided Congress, the analysts say.\n\nHogan, however, worries that a Trump impeachment may further embolden China to stall trade negotiations and hope for a less combative U.S. president in 2021, a scenario that would hurt stocks in the medium term.\n\nHot job market:Top companies offer perks like free gym memberships, meals and unlimited paid time off\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my greatest fear,\u201d he says. \u201cThat (impeachment) has a deterrent effect on our ability to negotiate with China.\u201d", "description": "Here's how stocks fared when Nixon and Clinton faced impeachment.
