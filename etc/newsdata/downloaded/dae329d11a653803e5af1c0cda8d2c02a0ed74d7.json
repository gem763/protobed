The award ceremony will be broadcast on TNT. Andrews joins a cohort of other AFI Life Achievement Award winners including George Clooney, Diane Keaton, John Williams, and Jane Fonda. Andrews is an Oscar winner and three-time nominee, for Mary Poppins, The Sound of Music, and Victor/Victoria. She is also a five-time Golden Globe winner, three time Grammy winner, and all-around living legend of stage and screen. And, because legends always hustle, she is set to star in a Shonda Rhimes show in 2020. Startlingly, Andrews is not an EGOT winner, because although she has been nominated for a Tony three times, she has never won. I will repeat that: Julie Andrews has never won a Tony award. We will all have to sit with this unsettling information until the AFI Life Achievement Award broadcast, on April 25.", "description": "Julie Andrews is set to receive an AFI Life Achievement Award for her work on stage and on screen, joining other life achievement award winners such as Steve Martin and Denzel Washington.", "authors": ["Charu Sinha"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/21/julieandrews_21.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
