She's wearing a ring that looks like semen on her ring finger.\n\nThe Texas -based woman's ring bears a squiggly, backwards S white shape in its centre, on top of 14k gold .\n\nOne commenter wrote: \"It looks like a squirt of mayo!\"\n\nWhile another wrote: \"Looks like a squirt of aioli.\"\n\nToothpaste was another, gentle comparison, but another commenter ruined it all by simply stating it looks like \"semen\".\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nA more beautiful - and kind - comparison was that it resembled a \"swan\".\n\nAnd another person, clearly lacking all imagination, simply labelled it a \"blob ring\".\n\nThis unfortunate woman is not the first to have been ruined by brutal 'ring shaming'.\n\nA bride-to-be was mocked for her 'tall' wedding ring that people are saying will be a 'nightmare with jumpers'.\n\n(Image: Facebook)\n\nThe woman, known only as Stacey, shared a picture of her ring to Facebook group 'That's it, I'm ring shaming'.\n\nStacey asked for the group's opinions on her \"classic but boring\" ring.\n\nMany were quick to comment on the height of the diamond - jokingly asking if the ring hits its head on a door frame as she walks through.\n\nAnother commented: \"You'll take someones eye out with that\".\n\nWhile another bride-to-be's unusual engagement ring received widespread backlash on social media, with users comparing it to a \"pair of tweezers\" and a \"taser gun\".\n\n(Image: That's It, I'm Ring Shaming/Facebook)\n\nClose up photos of the ring were shared in 'That's It, I'm Ring Shaming', with the caption \"A ring only 'slightly acceptable' from one angle'\".\n\nThe ring features an emerald green jewel centrepiece with two green jewels on the sides, embellished in a ring of diamonds with accompanying blue stones along its band.\n\nThe unusual 'V' angle design has garnered mixed reactions from users, and many were quick to lash out at the piece.\n\nUsers were quick to slam the ring's angled layout, with one saying: \"Oh no. Its colors don\u2019t even match!\"\n\nAnother added: \"Ew I would only accept this if my neck my neck was crooked.\"", "description": "The beloved engagement ring was handed down through the generations but Facebook users compared it to mayonnaise in a brutal takedown", "authors": ["Joseph Wilkes", "Image", "Brentwood Gazette", "Facebook", "That'S It", "I'M Ring Shaming Facebook"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20379483.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Bride-holding-a-glass-of-champagne.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
