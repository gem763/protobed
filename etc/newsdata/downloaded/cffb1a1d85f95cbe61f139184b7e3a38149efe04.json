So I have been avoiding penetrative sex for all these years. I have never been confident with my sexuality, even though I experienced a short period of happy sex before getting ill. I also have a lot of difficulties getting aroused because I know I will experience pain.\n\nMy friends say that I am a special person with so many other qualities. I am sure that with the right person I could slowly get my confidence back but I find it hard to believe that I will find a man who can be understanding about this aspect of me. Sometimes I see myself being lonely for ever. I would like you to let other people know of this condition that is ruining many young women\u2019s lives.\n\nI am happy to educate others, but are you aware that a skilled and accredited sex therapist can help you with this issue? There are treatments specifically for vulvodynia and vulvar vestibulitis, and a trained professional can also help you being comfortable having non-penetrative sex with another person. Sex involves so much more than penetration, and it is important to learn to be open to a wide variety of erotic connections.\n\nRemember that the central physical focus of your sexual pleasure \u2013 where most sexually relevant nerve endings are \u2013 is your clitoris, which is presumably unaffected by your vulvar issues. If a lover does not understand that clitoral stimulation is the best way to please you, to lubricate your vagina well in order to make comfortable penetration possible and to bring you to orgasm, then you need to teach that person. And \u201cteaching\u201d frequently involves showing them specifically how, by guiding their fingers to the right spot and motion. You never need to feel guilty about advising a partner that during lovemaking you may prefer solely clitoral stimulation; many women feel this way \u2013 even those who do not experience vulvar pain. To reciprocate, practise bringing a partner to orgasm orally, manually or in other non-penetrative styles.\n\n\u2022 Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a US-based psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.\n\n\u2022 If you would like advice from Pamela on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to private.lives@theguardian.com (please don\u2019t send attachments).
