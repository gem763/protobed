The Trump administration has agreed to a paced expansion of the OECD, which means Brazil will have to wait it turn.\n\nIn December, a Brazilian government report said the main obstacle to its request to join the OECD, first made in May 2017, was opposition by the United States and the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office in particular.\n\nIn Latin America, only Chile and Mexico are in the club, while Colombia is on track to join soon.", "description": "The U.S. government said on Thursday that it supported Brazil's taking steps toward joining the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), though it is first backing accession by Argentina.", "authors": ["Marcela Ayres", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
