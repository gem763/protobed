The album on which the song is featured, \u201cA Legendary Christmas: The Deluxe Edition,\u201d will be released Nov. 8.\n\nDespite considerable clamoring for \"Baby, It's Cold Outside's\" lyrics to be changed or the song be pulled off the radio altogether, some have pushed back, lamenting that it is a casualty of political correctness.\n\nLast holiday season, Susan Loesser, Frank Loesser's daughter, told NBC News that her father would be \"furious\" that radio stations were pulling the song from their holiday rotations.\n\n\u201cWay before #Me Too, I would hear from time to time people call it a date rape song,\u201d she told the network. \u201cI would get annoyed because it\u2019s a song my father wrote for him and my mother to sing at parties.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople used to say \u2018what\u2019s in this drink\u2019 as a joke,\u201d she argued. \u201cYou know, this drink is going straight to my head so what\u2019s in this drink? Back then it didn\u2019t mean you drugged me.\u201d", "description": "Singer John Legend is reportedly revamping\u00a0the Christmas song \"Baby, It's Cold Outside\" on his new\u00a0holiday album amid ongoing criticism of the duet's lyrics in the #MeToo era.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/legendjohn_clarksonkelly_10302019getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
