Democrats always liked that position, until I took it. Democrats always liked Walls, until I built them. Do you see what's happening here?'\n\nThe tweets served as the culmination of a bruising day for the President.\n\nDuring a meeting on Wednesday, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi told reporters at the White House she thought the president was shaken by a vote in the House of Representatives that saw the President lose support over the Syrian situation.\n\nPresident Trump ended up having a bruising day after many normally loyal Republicans crossed party lines over the issue of America's pullout of Syria and leaving the Kurds behind\n\nPresident Trump ended up venting his frustration on Twitter in a late-night tweet\n\nThe vote saw 129 Republicans join Democrats to condemn Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria in a 354 to 60 vote.\n\nIn a second tweet sent after midnight Eastern time, President Trump continued to pour fuel on the fire.\n\n''About 500,000 human beings were killed in Syria while Barack Obama was president & leading for a 'political settlement' to that civil war. Media has been more outraged in the last 72 hours over our Syria policy than they were at any point during 7 years of slaughter,'' Trump tweeted, appearing to quote conservative radio host Buck Sexton, as he attempted to focus some of the blame on the former administration.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, he lashed out at Democrats during a closed-door White House meeting before sparring publicly with Republican allies.\n\nThe President's twitter rant continued well past midnight as he attempted to shift blame onto the previous administration\n\nChuck Schumer, left, and Pelosi told reporters at the White House that Trump 'had a meltdown,' and called the speaker either a 'third-rate' politician of a 'third-grade' politician\n\nCongressional Democrats say the president ended up using the meeting to vent his fury at Democrats and former administration officials.\n\nAt one point he is said to have called Speaker Pelosi a 'third-rate politician' and former Defense Secretary James Mattis 'the world's most overrated general.'\n\n'What we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown, sad to say,' Pelosi went on to tell reporters after she left the meeting with Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer.\n\n'We have to pray for his health because this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president,' she added after returning to the Capitol.\n\nTrump ended up infuriating Republicans after he dismissed the Kurds during an Oval Office meeting by saying they were 'no angels.'\n\nHe then went onto downplay the need for the U.S. to become involved with Turkey's military invasion of Syria, saying 'it's not our border.'\n\nEven the usually loyal Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Trump's decision to pull back troops was a 'mistake'.\n\nThe House voted 354 to 60 for a resolution opposing Trump's moves in Syria - with 129 Republicans rebuking Trump\n\n'I don't know how many times I need to say it, and I think I'm speaking for most members of my conference, that this was a mistake and I hope it can be repaired,' McConnell said.\n\n'Abandoning them was a very dark moment in American history,' Utah Senator Mitt Romney added. 'The door was opened for what is occurring by the decision taken by the administration. So for us to be shocked and to look at Turkey and say, 'My goodness, we can't believe what you're doing' \u2014 we were the ones who opened that door.'\n\nThe Republican pushback is quite the U-turn from Tuesday when Republicans looked to be attempting to make more of an effort to align themselves with the President.", "description": "President Trump ended up venting his frustration on Twitter in late-night tweets.
