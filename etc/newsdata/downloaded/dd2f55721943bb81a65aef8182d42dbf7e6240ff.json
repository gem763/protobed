Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci all went under the CGI knife to play their characters when they were young. We\u2019ve been disappointed by CGI mustaches and CGI lions. Can CGI film icons do us wrong? The official trailer for the 209 minute film (over 3 hours!) premiered on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, giving us a real good look at Robert De Niro\u2019s computer face as he gets more and more involved with the mob and as his scowl gets more and more ingrained. \u201cIt was like the army,\u201d he says in a voice-over. \u201cYou follow orders, you get rewarded.\u201d Is that the case for when you\u2019re asked to assassinate a union leader? We\u2019re not so confident, but at least he can make jokes about it. The Netflix film is an epic look at organized crime throughout history; it took on a massive visual-effects project, and soon enough, you\u2019ll get to watch it on your 13-inch laptop screen. Netflix is releasing The Irishman in theaters for an obligatory 26 days before sharing it online\u2013just enough time to make the Oscars requirements, but not enough time for a wide release.\n\nWhat Netflix does with The Irishman will probably affect its other buzzy movies from big-name directors that could have awards-season play: Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Panama Papers movie The Laundromat, David Mich\u00f4d\u2019s Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet drama The King, Dee Rees\u2019s Anne Hathaway\u2013Willem Dafoe adaptation The Last Thing He Wanted, Fernando Meirelles\u2019s The Pope, and Noah Baumbach\u2019s A Marriage Story starring Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver.", "description": "Martin Scorsese\u2019s star-studded \u201cThe Irishman\u201d gets its first official trailer, featuring stars Joe Pesci, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, all CGI de-aged and ready to fight.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola", "Zoe Haylock"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/07/31/31-the-irishman-new.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
