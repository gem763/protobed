As always, I compared Big Pharma\u2019s \u201csolutions\u201d to nature\u2019s home-grown gifts. Two years of testing and study recently gave us scorecards. Mission accomplished? Not at all\u2026but sort of. It gets complicated sometimes. Both new drugs, Repatha and Praluent, got similar, exciting results in their various trials and tests. To keep this simple, we\u2019ll focus here on just Repatha\n\nMimicking a mutant gene\n\nExtraordinary results\n\nThe Repatha team found people who had naturally low LDL levels. They traced the cause first to a gene known as PCSK9, then to a mutant version of the gene. That turned out to be a very helpful mutation. In its normal state, PCSK9 is a bad actor. It inhibits receptors in the liver that detect LDL and help sweep it out of the body. What does PCSK9\u2019s mutant twin do? Well, instead of inhibiting, it helps the liver do its LDL-cleansing job. The result was a drug that caused the same action as the mutant PCSK9\u2014helping, instead of preventing, the liver from ridding the body of LDL cholesterol. The result? PCSK9 inhibitors\u2014a brand new class of drug.In early lab tests measuring Prematha\u2019s ability to reduce LDL , the drug did a fantastic job\u2014a 60 percent reduction. Such a steep reduction in LDL had rarely been seen before. Would it dramatically reduce the number of heart attacks and the number, especially, of fatal heart attacks\u2014current 50 percent? Would it mean, as many believed, the end of fatal heart attacks altogether? Hopes were high that with such a reduction in LDL, a similarly dramatic reduction in heart disease and resulting fatalities would be a slam dunk. Of course, many believed that heart health isn\u2019t only about cholesterol. So many other factors are involved. And lurking in the not-far-back background was the fact that another drug reduced LDL levels by a dramatic 25 percent, but the death rate increased. High drama, yes?\n\nTime for more tests\n\nRepatha reduced LDL, but fell well short of high hopes and expectations\n\nRepatha reduced the risk of several bad outcomes, but not dramatically\n\nRepatha did not reduce the risk of death\n\nTo review: Initial research found the way to reduce cholesterol\u2014the PCSK9 inhibitor. The lab tests found that it did exactly that\u2014and powerfully. It was time to move out of the lab and into the population, to see whether dramatically reduced cholesterol was a death-defying silver bullet. Around 27,000 people with cardiovascular disease, and who were responding well to their cholesterol-managing statin therapy, signed up. They had an average LDL level of about 90 mg/dl when they entered the study. They were given either Repatha or a placebo, and then monitored over time to determine the effects on heart health\u2014how many heart attacks, strokes, deaths, hospitalizations for blocked blood flow to the heart, and stents or bypasses. After two years of study, the Repatha group showed LDL levels reduced from the baseline 90 mg/dl to around 30 mg/dl. That's huge. More results? 9.8 percent of patients in the treatment group experienced one or more of those heart events vs. 11.3 percent in the placebo group. This amounts to a 15 percent reduction in risk in the Repatha group. Crunching the numbers showed that a physician would need to treat about 150 patients with Repatha in a year to prevent one of these unwanted events. Statistically speaking, there was no real reduction in the risk of death in either group. Conclusion:\n\nAre these cholesterol drugs worth the cost?\n\nReality check\n\nSo is Repatha ready for prime time? Should we physicians bring it into our toolkit? I agree with one expert who called the Repatha results, \u201cMeaningful and substantial, although not overwhelming.\u201d And I agree with another expert, who calls Repatha an important confirmation that relatively new genomics-based therapies show tremendous promise. And if any intervention improves, or even saves, just one life, without doing harm, why would we not go with it?Back in the real world, Repatha\u2019s proposed cost for treatment was set at about $14,000/year\u2014steep on a per-life-saved basis. It seems that was based on those pre-study expectations of dramatic reductions of risk and fatalities. Now, I may be wrong, and I\u2019m not an MBA, but decoding this, if I\u2019m right, shows us Big Pharma at its worst, making a breakthrough, lifesaving, high-demand new drug unreachable to all but a few, instead of within reach to the many in need. Shame. So\u2014is this \u201cnot overwhelming\u201d new drug worth the price? What is this amount of risk reduction worth, especially among those already successfully managing LDL with statins? And especially when it won\u2019t put off mortality? My position? I applaud any and all attempts to keep us healthy, and this new, gene-informed approach seems tremendously promising. Let the research continue. Give us a better tool. But I regard Big Pharma\u2019s \u201csolutions,\u201d including statins, with skepticism and concern. A look at the side effects of so many of their costly blockbuster products can only raise the question: Isn\u2019t there a better, safer, more affordable way?\n\nBetter, safer, affordable ways\n\nHeart-healthy diet\n\nWhole, fresh, organic, vitamin-and mineral-rich foods\u2014lean meats and poultry, fiber-rich organic fruits and vegetables, unsalted nuts and seeds, legumes, whole grains\n\nHealthy fats like avocado, olive, and sesame oils\n\nOmega-3 essential fatty acids\n\nCelery, garlic, raw cacao, cayenne pepper, and eggs\n\nAvoiding high-sodium foods, fast food, sugar, processed snacks and meals, and trans fats\n\nI\u2019m happy to assure you that there are plenty of alternative solutions. I\u2019ve had significant success treating any and all of our most threatening health conditions with dietary and lifestyle changes. No drugs. That meansIf you have a hard time getting enough of any nutrients from your diet, you can ensure sufficiency by taking a good quality supplement. And many natural, herbal remedies are especially effective in managing cholesterol. Read on, with delight, about 3 that I highly recommend:This remarkable citrus fruit has a molecular structure similar to statins, and similarly reduces cholesterol, but without statin-like side effects. I recommend 500 to 1,000 mg of bergamot daily. Be sure you\u2019ve cleared that with your doctor, and don\u2019t discontinue using statins without supervision. I also recommend bergamot essential oil. It relieves digestive difficulties, heals infectious wounds, repells insects, and more. And it\u2019s a lovely,calming fragrance.\n\nReduces LDL cholesterol levels\n\nReduces triglycerides\n\nIncreases good cholesterol levels\n\nHeart-healthy lifestyle\n\nMinimum 7\u20138 hours sleep\n\nNo smoking, moderate alcohol, limited caffeinated and sugary drinks\n\n15\u201320 minutes daily of direct, vitamin-D producing sunlight, more in northern climes\n\nWater\u2014half an ounce per pound of body weight per day, so at 140 pounds, 70 ounces of water, paced through the day.

Or find these tart green berries and drink blended, strained, Indian gooseberry juice. The name amla, by the way, comes from the Sanskrit word for \u201cthe sustainer.\u201d Bring it into your life and it will do a wonderful job helping to sustain you. Look for a supplement with 500 mg Indian Gooseberry and take as directed.Now that you know you can take matters into your own hands, I leave the decision to look into Prematha or Praluent up to you and your doctors.* As always, before making any diet and lifestyle changes, make sure your doctor says they\u2019re OK. Take good care. *Praluent, the drug similar to Repatha, might not be available. Their parent companies are battling in court over patent issues.
