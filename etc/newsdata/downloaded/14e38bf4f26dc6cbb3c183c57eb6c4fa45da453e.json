While I\u2019ll happily throw myself at the same set of ridiculous jumps in a hard Mario level for days, if I\u2019m not feeling a sense of progression in a puzzle, frustration sets in quickly.\n\nAs a result, I have, gosh, such a frustrating love/hate relationship with puzzle games, and it\u2019s tough for me to articulate exactly why some work, while others don\u2019t. The Talos Principle is one of my favorites of the last few years, but I couldn\u2019t stand The Witness. It actively made me feel upset, because the way The Witness communicated was going right over my head. The Room, Gunpoint, World of Goo? Loved \u2018em. In a given year, some of my favorite experiences inevitably revolve around puzzles. The problem with these games is my brain.\n\nI have infinite confidence in my fingers to decipher a set of complex platforms, which is why you can toss me at a game with absurd dexterity-based difficulty and I\u2019ll be fine, but I have so little confidence in my ability to tease out a solution requiring the same level of intensity from my head. In many instances, a \u201chard\u201d game is putting your fingers in the right order. With a puzzle, it\u2019s abstract, and your inability to figure out how to piece it together more nakedly reveals a personal inadequacy that quickly pushes me to stop playing altogether.\n\nThis is such a long windup because when I turn to you and say Manifold Garden is a puzzle game that works me for me, that I\u2019m sticking with it despite everything in my bones saying I should run away\u2014that means something. Manifold Garden reminds me of a spiritual successor to Antichamber, another one of those rare moments I stuck with a puzzle game from start to finish because even in the moments where I was tearing my hair out or was forced to look up the solution to a puzzle, the overall experience was worth it.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably seen a screenshot or video from Manifold Garden before; it\u2019s an indie game that\u2019s been kicking around for years under the guise of a playable M.C. Escher painting, with endlessly repeating geometry and intertwined staircases leading into the heavens. If you\u2019re wondering how you didn\u2019t hear about the game coming out, it\u2019s because Manifold Garden went from game-that-was-in-development-forever to \u201coops, it\u2019s out\u201d in record time; its release date was announced only two days before the game showed up on Apple Arcade and the Epic Game Store. (It\u2019s coming to PlayStation 4 at a later, currently unknown date.)\n\nHow Manifold Garden works is tough to describe in words, but in short, it\u2019s about realizing what you see in front of you is just one way to look at an image, and purposely distorting that perception in order to accomplish what\u2019s being asked. Sometimes, that can be as simple as getting a block from one side of the room to another. But simple tasks here are complicated. There is a reason Manifold Garden is the first time I\u2019ve been searching the phrase \u201cnon-Euclidian\u201d since I was playing Antichamber in 2013. It\u2019s playing with very similar ideas.\n\nLike I said, it\u2019s hard to describe, but let\u2019s try. Imagine walking into a room and you see two objects on the walls: a block on the wall to the left and a locked door on the right. On the left wall, there\u2019s also a hole where the block could presumably be dropped in, and a line connecting that hole to the locked door. The block is out of reach, and in Manifold Garden, you cannot jump. Your only interactions are to pick up objects, drop objects, and...bend gravity. When you approach a wall, your cursor will change color\u2014red, orange, blue, etc. That color corresponds to that wall and that wall\u2019s sense of gravity, and when you interact with a wall, it now becomes the gravitational source for the entire world. Up becomes down, left becomes, right, and so on.\n\nThat process, which you\u2019ll be doing a lot in Manifold Garden, looks like this:\n\nThe wall on the left, let\u2019s say, turns your cursor blue. By interacting with it, gravity now corresponds to the blue wall. The blue wall is now the ground, which means you can walk over to the block and pick it up! Now, drop the block in the hole, and voila, the door is open. You now have a few different ways of getting over to that door. You can walk on the ceiling, head back to the \u201coriginal\u201d ground, etc. Every wall in Manifold Garden can be manipulated, meaning the presented design of an area is A) purely aesthetic and B) deeply misleading.\n\nHere\u2019s how a short puzzle plays out, which should help all this make a little more sense. Have fun watching my brain slowly try to work through what the game is asking in real-time:\n\nIn playing Manifold Garden, there are so many moments where I truly had no idea what I was doing. I was trying things, but it didn\u2019t always feel like the experiments were leading towards a result. And this is usually the moment where a puzzle game starts to grate on me, where I can\u2019t get a sense of progress. But over and over again, this seemingly mindless toying around in Manifold Garden would, in fact, lead to progress and the solution would arrive.\n\nAt times, it felt like I was cheating. Is this the intended solution? Boy, this doesn\u2019t feel like the intended solution! But such reactions may also be the sign of a good puzzle game, when the player feels empowered by their own actions to the point of skirting up to and beyond the edges of reality. But in a game where reality itself is constantly falling apart, that feels right?\n\nYou\u2019re often rewarded for such wild experimentation, too, because Manifold Garden is a game where the next step is rarely obvious. There are no dialogue trees, no hint systems. It\u2019s a game that relies entirely on the player to suss out what\u2019s next, which, again, is usually a recipe for disaster for yours truly. But Manifold Garden and I consistently found ourselves on the same wavelength. I\u2019d take a breath, look around, and say \u201cOK, what am I missing here?\u201d Then, it would appear.\n\nLet me walk you through another example. After completing a puzzle, the player escapes to this massive open area, filled with parallel stairs. You can walk up the stairs, you can walk down the stairs. It doesn\u2019t lead anywhere. There\u2019s nothing to do except stare in the distance.\n\nThis is one of those great moments, when the game is waiting for it to dawn upon you how much control you truly have in Manifold Garden, how much the game can be hiding in plain sight, and how much you can manipulate everything around you to reach the unreachable.\n\nSee that door in the distance?\n\nHow the...how the hell do you get there? Again, you can't jump. You do not have a grappling hook. But you do have the ability to change the will of gravity. And so:\n\nThat\u2019s how. The rush I felt is why I\u2019m still playing (and still loving) Manifold Garden. It\u2019s because I want to chase moments like that, and so far, it\u2019s proving to be a game full of them.\n\nFollow Patrick on Twitter.
