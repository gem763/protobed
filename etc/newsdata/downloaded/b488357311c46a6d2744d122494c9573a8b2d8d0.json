Tickets for the first two shows go on sale Friday.\n\n\u201cThis is something that\u2019s so fun an idea for us that if this winds up just being two shows, it still would have been an incredible experience. I\u2019m just excited to get in there and do this,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it\u2019s something people love to see, I\u2019ll keep coming back.\u201d\n\nWhile details are still being worked out, the show will have an orchestra, band and choir - \u201call the bells and whistles that go into a regular \u2018me\u2019 show,\u201d Groban said - plus guests and impromptu interactions with fans. He promised that no two shows will be the same.\n\n\u201cEverything that we have up our sleeve is still completely in development,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a 100 ideas and we are going to, from now until Feb. 14, whittle them down,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe key was to make it loose, to make it impromptu. My fans have seen 18 years of touring where they\u2019ve seen a very well-rehearsed show but then there have been these glimpses of really improvisational, fun moments that can occur even in the arenas. And those are the moments where the room just lights up.\u201d\n\nGroban has been nominated for a Grammy, Emmy and Tony. His latest album is 2018\u2019s \u201cBridges,\u201d his eighth studio album, and he was on Broadway in 2017 for a run in \u201cNatasha, Pierre & The Great Comet of 1812.\u201d\n\nHe compared Radio City to places like Yankee Stadium and Madison Square Garden. \u201cThere\u2019s something holy about those places. You walk into a space that has so much energy from past performances, the history that\u2019s in the walls.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s also a more personal element to picking the venue. Groban early in his career played three nights at Radio City Music Hall. \u201cThe first time I felt the love and support of a New York audience was at that theater,\u201d he said.\n\nHe\u2019s returned for concerts and co-hosted the Tony Awards there with Sara Bareilles in 2018. \u201cIt\u2019s been a good-luck venue for me,\u201d he said, though he also called it the \u201cmost challenging venue\u201d because he needs to find the intimacy in such a large space.\n\n___\n\nMark Kennedy is at http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Josh Groban has a date for Valentine's Day - with 6,000 or so of his fans.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mark Kennedy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/08/theater-josh_groban_58598_c0-202-2422-1614_s1770x1032.jpg?ddec1239159e4f7caa6884c99360b73fd0416542", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
