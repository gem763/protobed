Speaking of things not aging well, Biden\u2019s brain is not having a good decade. From his claims of intimate involvement with the civil rights movement to his opposition to the Iraq War from its start, Joe is very creative with his own history. In that vein, I thought I\u2019d help him by clarifying a few parts of his biography before he makes the mistake of thinking these things happened to him.\n\nBiden did not team up with his dance partners and a group of teenagers to save a community center from an unscrupulous developer, that was Breakin\u2019 2: Electric Boogaloo.\n\nAs a child, Joe was not forgotten by his family as they left on a vacation. He also didn\u2019t fight off clumsy burglars called the \u201cWet Bandits.\u201d As much as his family may have wanted to leave him behind, that was Home Alone.\n\nHe also wasn\u2019t involved in an attempt with his buddies to lose their virginity that involved a floating brothel and an overzealous guy teacher, that was the Porky\u2019s movies.\n\nJoe Biden also didn\u2019t get a merit-based scholarship to law school, nor did he graduate in the top half of his class, both of which are things he\u2019s claimed.\n\nOur former vice president is a lot of things \u2013 goofy, enjoys sniffing women\u2019s hair, a little too touchy. He might even be corrupt, who knows? What he\u2019s not is a sexist pig.\n\nFor all the handsy, hair sniffing stuff that\u2019s been seen in public, there aren\u2019t any rumors of Biden cheating on his wife. Lord knows Congress is littered with people sleeping with staff, lobbyists, and pretty much anyone willing. In Biden\u2019s decades on the Senate, his name wasn\u2019t floated in those terms.\n\nKnowing that, Biden\u2019s name is still facing accusations of sexism. Not real sexism, \u201cwoke\u201d sexism.\n\nWhat is woke sexism? Like everything else that is \u201cwoke,\u201d it\u2019s whatever the person making the charge wants it to be.\n\nLast weekend, woke sexism was a woman named Lyz Lenz being offended Biden called her \u201csweetheart\u201d after she interviewed him at a candidate forum on LGBTQ issues.\n\nVox described the \u201coffense\u201d by writing, \u201cLenz wrote on Twitter afterwards that Biden also called her \u2018a real sweetheart\u2019 backstage. She later called these interactions \u2018a little condescending,\u2019 and told the USA Today, \u2018It\u2019s 2019, you shouldn\u2019t be calling women sweethearts.\u2019\u201d\n\nI could think of a lot of things to call someone who considers a 76-year-old man calling them \u201csweetheart\u201d to be \u201ccondescending,\u201d but none of them are suitable for print.\n\nCan you image being such a miserable person? Joe Biden can\u2019t. And that he can\u2019t while still scrambling to win the support of people who are is why he\u2019s not likely to win the Democratic nomination.\n\nAt the start of the campaign, Biden had his best shot to put the fight away. As he was getting into the race, the woke-set was doing what they do \u2013 calling everyone and everything racist/sexist/homophobic/etc. Rather than stand up to it, call it out, and separate himself from the herd of candidates actively trying to appeal to the angry, protest everything wing of the party, Biden hopped in the crazy conga line and tried to join them.\n\nThe only problem is, Joe Biden can\u2019t appeal to that crowd. He\u2019s too old, too white for it. No one on his staff seems to realize that simple fact.\n\nWhat Biden should have done is stood up to the mob; have his own Sister Souljah moment. A speech from Joe about how everything is not racist, how this is not a horrible country founded to protect the white patriarchy, how the \u201csystem\u201d is not designed to keep people down, would have catapulted him into an insurmountable lead.\n\nBelieve it or not, there are Democratic voters yearning for a sane voice to speak up within the party leadership, to shun the radicals. In the current field, the only person with the ability to do it was Joe Biden. He went the pander route.\n\nBiden\u2019s lead in the polls is based on name recognition, it\u2019s a mile-wide and an inch deep. Why would anyone get excited about a candidate running on slightly different versions of the things everyone else is running on? Especially when the party activists are conditioned to prefer what someone looks like more than what they stand for.\n\nFor all his gaffes, this was Biden\u2019s biggest mistake.\n\nJoe could have separated himself from the crowd, become the adult in the room to the blue-collar, non-taking-to-the-streets-over-everything Democratic voters. Now he\u2019s just the old guy saying things like, \u201cIn prison, the determination should be that your sexual identity is defined by what you say it is, not what in fact the prison says it is.\u201d Who\u2019s that appealing to?\n\nBiden\u2019s moment has passed. As has been the case throughout his entire career, he brought it down himself. Like many of the Democrats running, it\u2019s unclear what he truly believes; the only thing that\u2019s clear is he will do or say anything to win.\n\nAfter 50 years in politics, all he had to do was stand up and be the adult in the room, and the second oldest man in the race couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it. He may still squeak out the nomination (third time is the charm), but in winning it how he'd win it, he will lose more general election voters than he can replace. Maybe he can wrap a chain around his arm and intimidate his way to victory, like he did with Corn Pop.\n\nDerek is the host of a free daily podcast (subscribe!) and author of the book, Outrage, INC., which exposes how liberals use fear and hatred to manipulate the masses.", "description": "Joe Biden\u2019s now famous run-in with notorious gangster \u201cCorn Pop\u201d .09/24/2019 9:33:22AM EST.", "authors": ["Derek Hunter", "Beth Baumann", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/255/a4770fca-5d4e-4f5b-803d-b612eb4a9712.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
