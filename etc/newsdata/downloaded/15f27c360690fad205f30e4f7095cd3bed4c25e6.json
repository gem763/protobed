Several months ago, Walker was released on a $100,000 surety bond and ordered to wear the GPS monitor, provided by a company called Guarding Public Safety.\n\nMAN'S 'HOW TO' VIDEO FOR REMOVING ANKLE MONITOR LEADS TO FELONY CHARGE, AUTHORITIES SAY\n\nBut Walker, according to KHOU, \"failed to pay the company his monthly monitoring fee\" that was reportedly a condition of his bond, and therefore the company removed the device \u2014 leaving authorities unable to track the murder suspect.\n\nHarris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said the company sent \"a representative to physically remove his ankle monitor\" on Sept. 19, and Walker wasn't re-arrested until Oct. 2, according to jail records, which meant he was not monitored for a nearly two-week period.\n\nOgg described the situation as a \"troubling loophole,\" and the Harris County Community Supervision & Corrections Department, which didn't respond to Fox News' request for comment, said the bizarre technicality had not led to any widespread issues \u2014 and placed blame in the Walker case on Guarding Public Safety.\n\nMOM USES GPS TO LOCATE DAUGHTER, 17, TRAPPED UNDER CAR 25 FEET DOWN MOUNTAINSIDE\n\n\u201cThe vendor was immediately terminated because of serious violations of the memorandum of understanding,\u201d Teresa May, department of director, told the news outlet, noting other defendants monitored by the company have been transferred elsewhere.\n\nMay said the company was supposed to gain permission from the department in the event they had to remove Walker's ankle monitor, but they allegedly never contacted the department about the issue.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nGuarding Public Safety, which also did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment, told KTRK in a statement that the company \"sent several violations on Clint Walker to the Harris County Pretrial Supervision Dept. including his failure to charge his device as instructed resulting in no location and no communication.\"\n\n\"His device went dead several times and we had no location and no communication with this defendant,\" the statement read. \"Immediate notification was sent upon removal of his device.\"", "description": "A\u00a0capital murder suspect in\u00a0Texas\u00a0had a court-ordered\u00a0ankle monitor removed by\u00a0the device's operators because\u00a0the company reportedly said he didn't pay them a\u00a0monitoring fee to wear the tracker.", "authors": ["Nicole Darrah", "Nicole Darrah Covers Breaking", "Trending News For Foxnews.Com.
