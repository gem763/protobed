Whenever I couldn't sell all (the roses), I would be beaten,\" the 15-year-old told the Thomson Reuters Foundation by phone from Thailand's western region of Mae Sot, where he lives with his grandmother and aunt.\n\nIn May, judges upheld a lower court ruling convicting a man and woman of trafficking, jailing them for 12 years. They were then ordered to pay 1.26 million baht in compensation to Bo Soe.\n\n\"I don't know whether or not I will receive the money ... but I'm happy to be back with my family,\" said Bo Soe, whose name has been changed to protect his identity as a minor.\n\nPapop Siamhan, a lawyer who has followed the case, said Bo Soe was unlikely to ever receive the money, since the traffickers could not afford the compensation, and the long prison sentence meant they would not be able to gather the cash.\n\nLawyers and charities, which are often hired by trafficking victims to trace offenders' assets and enforce compensation orders, say seizures by AMLO can actually thwart survivors' efforts to obtain restitution.\n\n\"If it's a case involving the fishing sector, for instance, AMLO will seize the vessels and freeze the bank accounts of offenders,\" said Siamhan. \"(This) means the victims' lawyer will have to track down other assets.\"\n\n\"OUR LIVES ARE CHEAP\"\n\nSugunya Rattananakintr, a public prosecutor who focuses on human trafficking cases, said court rules should be amended to require offenders who were ordered to pay compensation to do so before they were allowed to appeal their sentences and fines.\n\n\"The problem is the enforcement of compensation orders since the ministry doesn't have knowledge in this area,\" she said.\n\n\"If you wait until the case reaches the highest court, the offenders will transfer all their assets, leaving them with nothing left to pay (in compensation to victims).\"\n\nManeelek from the anti-trafficking division said the Ministry of Social Development and Human Security and other related government agencies signed an agreement last year to help victims with their cases and track down offenders' assets.\n\n\"We are in the process of looking for ways to cooperate (within government), which might take some time,\" he said.\n\nHowever, time is not a luxury that many victims can afford.\n\nHaving been trafficked at 22 and forced to work on a fishing boat for three years without pay, Aung Aung was hopeful when the six traffickers were jailed for 10 years in July and ordered to pay about 2 million baht in compensation to their victims.\n\nBut Aung Aung does not know when he will receive the 65,000 baht he was awarded - if at all - and is looking for work at sea again in southern Thailand despite knowing the risks involved.\n\n\"It was like hell, working so hard ... for more than three years. Our lives are so cheap on the boat,\" he said.\n\n\"I hope I will get the compensation money some day.\" ($1 = 30.3800 baht) (Reporting by Nanchanok Wongsamuth @nanchanokw; Editing by Kieran Guilbert and Katy Migiro.
