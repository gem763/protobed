Also making a return appearance, in a slightly more polished version than in 1996, is \u201cGet Me Away from Here I\u2019m Dying,\u201d which, what a coincidence, fits seamlessly with the rest new songs.\n\nTurning to more conventional soundtrack norms, there are four instrumentals, from melancholic opener \u201cSister Buddha (Intro)\u201d to closer \u201cWe Were Never Glorious,\u201d which incorporates dialogue from the film.\n\nHighlights among the new songs include the gently thump of \u201cSister Buddha\u201d and \u201cDid the Day Go Just Like You Wanted?\u201d whose second line is \u201cOr did you hold on with your fingernails?\u201d and which offers keen insight into realistic parent-child dynamics.\n\nBandleader Stuart Murdoch says most of the ideas came to him quickly after reading the book and Bird also had a voice in the song selection, so the paring of sound and vision should be a good match.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve heard the music, you can wait for the film - or read the book.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Belle & Sebastian, \"Days of the Bangold Summer\" (Matador)", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Pablo Gorondi"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/music_review_-_belle_and_sebastian_34406_c0-313-1500-1187_s1770x1032.jpg?5f70a814906c1c77d956ef85b4cea176216c3523", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
