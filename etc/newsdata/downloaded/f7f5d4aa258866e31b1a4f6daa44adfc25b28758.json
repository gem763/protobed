Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official overseeing Ukraine policy, plans to tell investigators, referring to Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to look into Joe Biden and his son.\n\nVindman, who will become the first White House official to testify as part of the impeachment inquiry, also plans to say that he reported Trump\u2019s July 25 phone call with Zelenskiy to the NSC\u2019s top lawyer after listening in on the conversation from the White House situation room alongside other U.S. national security officials.\n\nIt was the second time Vindman had raised concerns to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel about a campaign by Trump, his associates and some U.S. officials to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations intended to benefit Trump politically.\n\n\u201cI realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma, it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained,\u201d Vindman plans to say. (Burisma is a Ukrainian energy company of which Biden\u2019s son Hunter was previously a board member.)\n\n\u201cThis would all undermine U.S. national security,\u201d Vindman adds. \u201cFollowing the call, I again reported my concerns to NSC\u2019s lead counsel.\u201d\n\nVindman, an Army combat veteran who served in Iraq, will become the first official who listened in on Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelenskiy to speak with investigators, providing a firsthand account of what House Democrats have said is a blatant abuse of power by the president. His opening statement leans heavily on his military service and a \u201csense of duty\u201d to his country.\n\n\u201cI am a patriot, and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend our country, irrespective of party or politics,\u201d Vindman writes in his opening statement, adding that his family fled the Soviet Union when he was just 3\u00bd years old. Vindman was also wounded in an IED attack while serving in Iraq and later received a Purple Heart.\n\n\u201cAs an active duty military officer, the command structure is extremely important to me,\u201d Vindman plans to say, defending his decisions to express his concerns about Trump to his higher-ups. \u201cOn many occasions I have been told I should express my views and share my concerns with my chain of command and proper authorities.\u201d\n\nThe Trump-Zelenskiy phone call is at the center of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. Investigators have gathered evidence that Trump sought to withhold nearly $400 million of critical military aid to Ukraine and refuse a White House meeting with Zelenskiy until the Ukrainian leader publicly stated his intention to launch Trump\u2019s desired investigations.\n\nVindman also says in his opening statement that he would be appearing before investigators under subpoena \u2014 an indication that he expects the White House to try to prevent him from testifying. He also says he is not the whistleblower who initially reported concerns about the White House\u2019s handling of Ukraine to the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general \u2014 though many of his concerns mirror the complaint that put the House on a path toward impeachment.\n\nVindman\u2019s appearance before the three committees spearheading the impeachment inquiry will mark the most significant crack yet in the White House\u2019s blockade of witness testimony.\n\nAlready, a handful of State Department officials and diplomats have described alarm at Trump\u2019s handling of Ukraine and worried that he had withheld military aid and a White House visit from Zelensky in order to pressure him to launch the Biden probe.\n\nVindman plans to echo those concerns on Tuesday \u2014 in particular, efforts by \u201coutside influencers\u201d to promote \u201ca false narrative of Ukraine inconsistent with the consensus views of the interagency.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani was at the helm of that shadow campaign, which led to the ouster of Marie Yovanovitch as the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. Vindman does not name Giuliani in his opening statement, but says he was alarmed that such efforts were inconsistent with American foreign policy and harming U.S.-Ukraine relations.\n\n\u201cThis narrative was harmful to U.S. government policy,\u201d Vindman writes in his statement. \u201cWhile my interagency colleagues and I were becoming increasingly optimistic on Ukraine\u2019s prospects, this alternative narrative undermined U.S. government efforts to expand cooperation with Ukraine.\u201d\n\nVindman plans to testify that he first reported his Ukraine-related concerns to the NSC\u2019s lead lawyer in early July, after a meeting between Ukraine\u2019s top national security official and cadre of senior Trump administration officials, including Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Ambassadors Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland.\n\nVindman says that when the Ukrainians raised the prospect of a Trump-Zelenskiy meeting \u2014 a crucial step for Ukraine as its newly elected leader sought to showcase a united front against Russia \u2014 Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, interjected \u201cto speak about Ukraine delivering specific investigations in order to secure the meeting.\u201d At that moment, Vindman says, then-national security adviser John Bolton \u201ccut the meeting short.\u201d\n\nAt a subsequent debriefing, Vindman says, Sondland \u201cemphasized the importance that Ukraine deliver the investigations into the 2016 election, the Bidens, and Burisma.\u201d Vindman says he confronted Sondland and called his statements \u201cinappropriate\u201d because \u201cthe request to investigate Biden and his son had nothing to do with national security.\u201d Those concerns, he says, were echoed by Fiona Hill, who at the time served as the NSC\u2019s top Russia policy official.\n\n\u201cFollowing the debriefing meeting, I reported my concerns to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel,\u201d Vindman says. \u201cDr. Hill also reported the incident to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel.\u201d\n\nSondland, for his part, told lawmakers earlier this month he didn\u2019t remember discussing the Bidens with State Department or White House officials.\n\n\u201cI recall no discussions with any State Department or White House official about Former Vice President Biden or his son, nor do I recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens,\u201d he said.\n\nHill testified earlier this month that she met with NSC lawyer John Eisenberg twice, at Bolton\u2019s urging, to relay similar concerns. Both Vindman and Hill met with NSC lawyers on the same day, July 10, after Bolton abruptly ended the meeting with Ukraine\u2019s top national security official, Oleksandr Danylyuk.\n\nVindman\u2019s testimony also appears to corroborate aspects of William Taylor\u2019s testimony before impeachment investigators last week. Taylor, the top American diplomat in Ukraine, directly connected Trump to a quid pro quo with Ukraine involving military aid and a White House meeting with Zelenskiy.\n\nThe White House accused Taylor of being part of a \u201ccoordinated smear campaign\u201d against the president, calling his testimony \u201chearsay.\u201d\n\nVindman\u2019s testimony is significant for not only its content but also its example. A fellow White House official, Tim Morrison, who also serves on the National Security Council, is expected to testify on Thursday, and his lawyer has already indicated that Morrison plans to speak to lawmakers under subpoena, even if the White House objects.\n\nHis and Vindman\u2019s posture is a stark contrast with that of Charles Kupperman, a former Bolton aide who was deemed by the White House to be \u201cabsolutely immune\u201d from testifying because of his proximity to Trump. Kupperman refused to comply with a House subpoena on Monday and is seeking a court order about whether to defer to the White House or Congress.", "description": "Alexander Vindman, who oversees Ukraine policy at the White House, is to appear before impeachment investigators Tuesday.", "authors": ["Andrew Desiderio", "Kyle Cheney"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1184009153-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
