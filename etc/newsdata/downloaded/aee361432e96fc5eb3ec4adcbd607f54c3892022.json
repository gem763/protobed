In his first 20 starts, he has another league record with 13 300-yard passing games.\n\nAnd if the 24-year-old superstar quarterback throws at least two TD passes for a 15th straight game against Detroit, he will match one of Peyton Manning\u2019s league records set during the 2013 and 2014 seasons with the Denver Broncos.\n\n\u201cThe way Pat\u2019s going, he\u2019s going to break every record in NFL history if he keeps this up,\u201d Lions safety Quandre Diggs said.\n\nMahomes, though, is not coming to the Motor City cocky about his chances to match the mark after watching Detroit\u2019s defense force three fumbles, recovering two, and allowing Philadelphia\u2019s Carson Wentz to barely complete half his passes in a 27-24 win over the Eagles in Week 3.\n\n\u201cThey played physical football,\u201d Mahomes said. \u201cThey played a lot of man coverage. They really get up in everyone\u2019s face and they stopped the run. I think with the Eagles, they really capitalized on turnovers. That\u2019s the big thing they focus on. We\u2019re going to try to protect the ball.\u201d\n\nHere are some other things to watch when Kansas City (3-0) plays the Lions (2-0-1) on Sunday:\n\nMAKING A MARK\n\nDetroit is the first NFL team with four players to have 100 yards receiving and a TD in a game through Week 3. Receiver Danny Amendola and rookie tight end T.J. Hockenson did it in the season-opening tie at Arizona. Receiver Kenny Golladay followed suit in the Week 2 win over the Chargers. In last week\u2019s victory at Philadelphia, Marvin Jones became the fourth player on the team with 100 yards receiving and a score.\n\n\u201cAnytime we can spread the ball around and give the defense a lot to think about, I think it\u2019s a positive for us,\u201d quarterback Matthew Stafford said. \u201cIt\u2019s a credit to those guys going out there and making plays. I\u2019m happy for all of those guys that have done it and hopefully we\u2019ll get more of it.\u201d\n\nSPREADING THE LOVE\n\nMahomes has also found a different receiver to target each week.\n\nSammy Watkins had 198 yards receiving and three TDs in the season-opening, 40-26 victory at Jacksonville. Demarcus Robinson had 174 and two scores in Week 2, a 28-10 win at Oakland. Mecole Hardman had the 83-yard TD reception in a 33-28 win against Baltimore last Sunday.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s all about when you have a team of this stature and players on this team, it\u2019s about spreading the ball around,\u201d Watkins said. \u201cNobody has to go out there and struggle or try to do something don\u2019t have to do.\u201d\n\nMEASURING UP\n\nDetroit is unbeaten through Week 3 for the first time since 2011. Of course, few outside of the Lions\u2019 locker room expect them to upset the Kansas City to extend the solid start.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be a good test for us,\u201d Stafford acknowledged.\n\nGROWING PAINS\n\nThe Chiefs\u2018 new defense under coordinator Steve Spagnuolo has gone through some growing pains, getting beaten through the air by Jacksonville in Week 1 and dominated on the ground by everyone else. Kansas City is giving up a league-high 6.2 yards per carry and allowing nearly 140 yards rushing per game.\n\n\u201cWe play well in stretches,\u201d safety Tyrann Mathieu said. \u201cThe first drive of every game hasn\u2019t been a great drive for us defensively. I think we\u2019ve given up a touchdown every time. Then, in the fourth quarter we get lax as well. End of the day that falls on me.\u201d\n\nSTAFFORD\u2019S SACKS\n\nThe previous five seasons, Detroit allowed Stafford to get sacked nearly three times a game on average. After seeing Stafford to get sacked three times in Week 1, the Lions have not surrendered a sack.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Dave Skretta contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Patrick Mahomes has led the Kansas City Chiefs to another strong start, setting records along the way.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Larry Lage"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/ravens_chiefs_football_14551_c0-126-2999-1874_s1770x1032.jpg?972468fa1cc1d90447d941560d1fe998dd054312", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
