But among party highbrows, he was an estimable guy.\n\nHe was a guy the Republicans turned to for help \u2014 a guy his fellow Republicans could depend upon to provide help.\n\n\u201cIf Scott Brown pulls off an upset in the race to replace Ted Kennedy in the Senate, he may have Mitt Romney to thank,\u201d The Daily Beast wrote in 2010. \u201cLargely overlooked in assessing Brown\u2019s prospects: the hidden hand of Mitt Romney. The former Massachusetts governor headlined at a fundraiser for Brown. \u2026 And Romney has helped Brown raise money outside the state as well.\u201d\n\nA year later, a New York Times headline read, \u201cMitt Romney Campaigns Tirelessly, and Not Just For Himself,\u201d above a story about the ex-governor\u2019s political work on behalf of lesser-known candidates.\n\nRomney used to be a guy cast in favorable media lights \u2014 even as he opposed one of the left\u2019s most-fawned, Barack Obama, for president.\n\n\u201cMitt Romney gives more to charity than President Obama, Joe Biden,\u201d Politico wrote in 2012, in a story that described the former governor as \u201cfar more generous\u201d than his White House opponents, giving more than 29% of family income to nonprofits in 2011.\n\nRomney used to be someone others described as statesmanly, gentlemanly, diplomatic \u2014 a man whose favor was welcome.\n\n\u201cThe former Massachusetts governor has endorsed 33 candidates this election cycle, including many facing competitive primaries,\u201d The Hill reported in mid-2014. \u201cSo far, not a single one has lost.\u201d\n\nAnd then came Donald Trump and Romney lost it. Of course, to heartland conservatives, he never really had it \u2014 but when Trump came, he lost his ability to appear like he had it. He abandoned all pretense of hanging with the cream, and instead, dropped knee-deep into the mud.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s what I know,\u201d Romney said, back in 2016. \u201cDonald Trump is a phony, a fraud.\u201d\n\nThat was just the warm-up.\n\nRomney has since criticized Trump with such vitriolic intensity that he practically serves as the Democrats\u2019 attack dog. Yet he still sought, and received, Trump\u2019s endorsement for Senate in 2018. Who\u2019s the real fraud? The real phony?\n\nRomney\u2019s newest strategy to resist this president has taken a decidedly different tack. He was busted for using a secret Twitter account with the handle of Pierre Delecto as a means of pushing back against Trump. \u201cC\u2019est moi\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s me \u2014 he blithely told The Atlantic when asked.\n\nAnd boy, the fun Twitter is having.\n\nThere\u2019s the meme of Romney in the signature pink hat of the recent women\u2019s rights movement, beneath the brief message, \u201c#PierreDelecto will lead it.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s the meme of a woman tapping her fingers together in anticipation, beneath the message, \u201cIt\u2019s like Christmas morning waiting for Trump to wake up and start tweeting about #PierreDelecto.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s the grainy photo of Romney beneath this imagined conversation on Twitter that went like this: \u201c\u2018I\u2019m not paying for this baguette.\u2019 \u2018Oh?\u2019 \u2018No. And what are you going to do about it?\u2019 The door swung open. The very molecules in the room ceased moving. #PierreDelecto had arrived.\u201d\n\nThere are hundreds more. Literally \u2014 hundreds.\n\nSuch is the life of Romney. From statesman and dignified politician \u2014 to rabid, ranting anti-Trumping hack \u2014 to the butt of Pierre Delecto jokes. And he\u2019s got nobody to blame but himself.\n\n\u2022 Cheryl Chumley can be reached at [email protected] or on Twitter, @ckchumley.\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
