Supreme Court/Parliament TV via Reuters.\n\nAfter she read out the court\u2019s ruling on live television on Tuesday morning, Hale was being lauded as fashion and feminist icon - due in part to the huge spider brooch that adorned her trim black outfit.\n\n\u201cThe Beyonce of the legal world...stole the show with her spider brooch,\u201d said the Daily Mirror.\n\nThe Guardian suggested the brooch may have given a clue to which way the ruling was going to go.\n\n\u201cWearing a spider to deliver news that trapped the prime minister felt pointed,\u201d it said.\n\nThe brooch is one in a collection which Hale sports in court that also includes a frog, a fox and a centipede.\n\nBut as a very modern women, she might not welcome the attention on how she dresses and would rather the focus was on how she runs the United Kingdom\u2019s highest judicial body.\n\nThe Supreme Court has only been in existence since 2009. Never in its short history had it weighed such a momentous case. And never had Britons been treated to so many modern trappings at a core establishment institution.\n\nUnlike other British courts, Hale and her fellow judges do not wear wigs nor do they sit in an elevated position.\n\nWhile TV cameras are barred from nearly all other tribunals, the Supreme Court\u2019s live stream on the first day of the hearing was accessed on its website more than 4 million times.\n\nThrust into the Brexit maelstrom, Hale insisted her court was determining points of law, not politics.\n\n\u201cI must repeat that this case is not about when or on what terms the United Kingdom leaves the European Union,\u201d she told the court as hearings finished last Thursday.\n\nOn Tuesday, it ruled that Johnson had acted unlawfully by asking Queen Elizabeth to suspend parliament for five weeks in order, as his foes allege, to sidestep opposition to his plan to take Britain out of the European Union with or without a deal by Oct. 31.\n\nReading out the ruling in a clear, unwavering voice, Hale offered not a shred of comfort to the beleaguered prime minister.\n\n\u201cNo justification for taking action with such an extreme effect has been put before the court, she said. \u201c....the Prime Minister\u2019s advice to Her Majesty was unlawful, void and of no effect.\u201d\n\nLEGAL PIONEER\n\nHale, 74, became Supreme Court president two years ago and is emblematic of its modern face.\n\nUnlike most contemporaries, she was brought up in northern England and educated at a state school, was an academic lawyer specialising in family and welfare issues, and spent most of her career as a pioneer in her field.\n\nShe became a High Court judge in 1994 and Britain\u2019s first female law lord in 2004 - until recently the top court\u2019s only woman. Last year, she made a brief appearance on a TV cooking show MasterChef.\n\nIn a speech in May at Girton College, Cambridge, which she attended in the 1960s, graduating top of her class, she said a former senior judge had described her in his diaries as \u201ca formidable, vigorous person with a strong agenda of her own\u201d.\n\n\u201cWhat is this \u2018Brenda agenda\u2019 and why should voicing it arouse such feelings? It is, quite simply, the belief that women are equal to men and should enjoy the same rights and freedoms that they do,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSo why is that \u2018an agenda\u2019? Quite simply, because we have not yet achieved the equality we seek in the law, let alone in life.\u201d\n\nNot shy about promoting equal rights for women and greater diversity in the judiciary, Hale\u2019s reforms of divorce and child law have led to her being singled out.\n\n\u201cThe Marriage Wrecker\u201d, one Daily Mail columnist described her as in a 2003 article, criticising her views on gay partnerships, heterosexual cohabitation and divorce.\n\nPIVOTAL TO FUTURE\n\nAs well as having a huge impact on how Brexit plays out with the Oct. 31 divorce deadline looming, the court\u2019s ruling will also be pivotal in determining the future balance of power between Britain\u2019s government and parliament.\n\nBrexit-supporter Johnson, a former London mayor known for his mop of blond hair and bombastic rhetoric, advised the 93-year-old Queen Elizabeth on Aug. 28 to prorogue - UK parlance for suspend - parliament.\n\nThe shutdown came into effect on Sept. 10 amid chaotic protests by opposition lawmakers in the lower House of Commons on the banks of London\u2019s River Thames.\n\nSifting through legal precedence from cases and laws dating back hundreds of years, Johnson\u2019s team argued judges should not interfere in politics and limit the prime minister\u2019s use of prerogative powers - functions he carries out in the monarch\u2019s name.\n\nWhen the courts in 2016 last trod into matters of such constitutional significance - whether the government needed parliament\u2019s approval before triggering the formal EU divorce process - they drew the ire of Brexit-supporting newspapers.\n\n\u201cEnemies of the People,\u201d said the Daily Mail headline above a photograph of three senior High Court judges after they ruled parliament\u2019s approval was needed.\n\nThis time, it was Lady Hale - and her brooch - that lit up social media.", "description": "Even before she delivered the momentous decision that crushed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's suspension of parliament, Supreme Court president Lady Brenda Hale had brought a blast of fresh air to Britain's stuffy and male-dominated institutions.", "authors": ["Michael Holden", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433382472&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N1CH", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
