He was 90.\n\nHis death was confirmed by a family spokeswoman, Holly Baird.\n\nMr. Conyers, a Democrat, resigned in 2017 after accusations of unwelcome sexual advances by two women. His lawyers denied the accusations, but both Paul Ryan, a Republican and then the speaker of the House, and Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader at the time and the current speaker, found the complaints credible and demanded that he step down.\n\nMr. Conyers was the only member of the House Judiciary Committee to participate in impeachment inquiries against both Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton.\n\nIn 1974, he said impeachment of Mr. Nixon was necessary \u201cto restore to our government the proper balance of constitutional power and to serve notice on all future presidents that such abuse of power will never again be tolerated.\u201d", "description": "One of the most liberal members of Congress, he resigned after two women accused him of making unwelcome sexual advances.", "authors": ["Adam Clymer"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/28/business/28conyers-obit2/27conyers1-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
