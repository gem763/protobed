But many of those who live in the hamlet, also known as Kopernik Shores, say they may not accept the company\u2019s offer.\n\ncaption Maria and Ray Pointer\u2019s yard offers a window into SpaceX\u2019s efforts to develop a Mars launch system called Starship.

It soon abandoned that plan after a number of setbacks and a push by Elon Musk, the company\u2019s founder, to develop a new, fully reusable, and Mars-capable rocket system called Starship.\n\nSince then, SpaceX has built and launched a crude rocket-powered prototype called Starhopper as high as 500 feet in the air. The company lifted the vehicle off a concrete pad it built near Boca Chica Beach, just 1 1/2 miles east of the nearest residence in the village.\n\nBut following an accidental brush fire, public-safety notices warning of the possibility for explosions, and a push to have the Federal Aviation Administration approve orbital-class launches with larger rockets, SpaceX is trying to buy out Boca Chica entirely.\n\nWhy SpaceX is trying to buy a small Texas retiree community\n\ncaption An overview of the Boca Chica area in south Texas circa 2017. source Google Earth\n\nResidents both in-state and out-of-state told Business Insider they began receiving buyout offer letters by express mail on Monday. Though a commercial real-estate company called JLL appears to be handling the offers, SpaceX had the offers printed on its company letterhead. (Read the full cover letter at the end of this story.)\n\nAt least 10 residents who own about one-third of the homes in the area have received letters so far, though ostensibly all property owners in the vicinity of SpaceX\u2019s facilities were approached by the company about a buyout.\n\n\u201cWhen SpaceX first identified Cameron County as a potential spaceport location, we did not anticipate that local residents would experience significant disruption from our presence,\u201d the letter said. \u201cHowever, it has become clear that expansion of spaceflight activities as well as compliance with Federal Aviation Administration and other public safety regulations will make it increasingly more challenging to minimize disruption to residents of the Village.\u201d\n\nRead more: Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX is developing giant Mars rockets in a sleepy town in southern Texas. Here\u2019s what it\u2019s like to visit.\n\nGiven that increased disruption to Boca Chica residents, it says, and a need to comply with public health and safety rules, \u201cSpaceX would like to acquire the properties located in Boca Chica Village.\u201d\n\nThe letter added that SpaceX was \u201ccommitted to a fair and equitable process for acquiring this real estate\u201d and, to that end, the company hired an independent firm to appraise each property.\n\ncaption A redacted version of SpaceX\u2019s buyout offer letter sent to residents of Boca Chica Village, Texas, in September. source Business Insider/DocumentCloud\n\n\u201cSpaceX is offering you three times the independently appraised fair market value of your property,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThe offer is good through two weeks from the date of this letter.\u201d\n\nThe note is dated September 12, indicating the cutoff date for the offer is September 26 \u2013 just two days before Musk is due to deliver a presentation on the Starship development program near the hamlet.\n\n\u201cThe amount of this offer is not negotiable,\u201d the letter continued. \u201cSpaceX believes that it is very important to offer the same deal to all residents using a consistent approach for determining the amount offered for each property. This is the fairest approach.\u201d\n\nFor those who commit to a sale, SpaceX said it would cover closing and other real-estate costs.\n\nIt also comes packaged with an additional perk:\n\n\u201cSpaceX recognizes that your close proximity to its operations has offered a unique opportunity to experience at close-hand the development of what will be the world\u2019s most advanced rocket. In appreciation of your support, we will offer all residents of the Village who accept the purchase offer the opportunity to continue their connection with the development of Starship by extending an invitation to attend future private VIP launch viewing events that are unavailable to the public.\u201d\n\nBut some residents say they may not take SpaceX\u2019s deal\n\ncaption Weems Road is the main path through Boca Chica Village and was unpaved until SpaceX showed up. source Dave Mosher/Business Insider\n\nThough SpaceX seems to want to buy out the entire village, approximately 10 property owners plan not to accept the deal, and for a variety of reasons, residents told Business Insider.\n\nMaria Pointer, who lives in Boca Chica and helps run a Facebook group that follows and generally supports SpaceX\u2019s activities, said her paperwork was \u201cturned to mush\u201d because it blew into a puddle and got soaked to the point of illegibility.\n\nBut she said if the replacement offer she was mailed were three times the appraised value of her and her husband Ray\u2019s property, then the couple would be unlikely to accept the deal.\n\ncaption Starhopper \u2014 SpaceX\u2019s first Mars Starship prototype \u2014 hovering over its launchpad during a test flight in Boca Chica on August 27. source Trevor Mahlmann/Reuters\n\n\u201cI really do want to get out of SpaceX\u2019s way, and I want them to succeed and do what they\u2019re supposed to do,\u201d said Pointer, who lives in the area year-round and plans to retire there. \u201cBut I also want them to support me also, and it\u2019s also not going to be at an eminent-domain price.\u201d\n\nCelia Johnson is another resident who plans not to accept the offer. Johnson was born and raised in nearby Brownsville, has lived part-time in her Boca Chica home since 1992, and has two sisters who also own homes there. She said the offer \u2013 and what she fears is a possible forced removal in the future if she declines it \u2013 makes it feel as if her \u201cdream home\u201d is being taken away through a \u201chostile takeover.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey determined what they are going to pay us for our homes and they give us a two-week deadline to decide,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI am not going to be bullied into selling under their conditions.\u201d\n\nPointer said the offers did not account for the unique wilderness and view of Boca Chica, which sits less than 2 miles from a public beach, was peaceful and quiet before SpaceX arrived, and is surrounded by thousands of acres of coastal, bird-filled wildlife refuge. She also says a handful of families do not have the financial means, even with a three-times-appraised-value offer, to buy equivalent properties elsewhere.\n\n\u201cThey need to understand that most of this community has very limited income,\u201d she said. \u201cWe want to move on, just give us what we need to move on. I\u2019m not going to go to a trailer or an apartment. I gave my life to this property. I gave it everything I had. Nobody else wanted to tame it.\u201d\n\nBusiness Insider contacted SpaceX for comment, but the company did not immediately provide a statement.\n\nRead SpaceX\u2019s cover letter below:\n\nCorrection (10:36 p.m. ET): A previous version of this story referred to Boca Chica Village as a town.
