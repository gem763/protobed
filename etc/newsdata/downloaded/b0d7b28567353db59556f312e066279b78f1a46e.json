Instead, it was pretty puny,\u201d he explained. \u201cThe market is hanging in there and should do better over the rest of the year.\u201d\n\nYardeni\u2019s more bullish on growth stocks as leaders in the next leg of this rally than he is on value, despite a recent uptick in that corner of the market. \u201cThe economy is doing fine and the fundamentals for stocks moving higher are still intact,\u201d he said.\n\nAs a reminder, value stocks are those believed to be undervalued in the market, while their growth rivals are those that have seen faster-than-average earnings growth.\n\nWatch his interview:\n\nFor now, stocks aren\u2019t quite on board with his call.\n\nThe market\n\nFutures on the Dow YM00, -0.06% , S&P ES00, +0.03% and Nasdaq NQ00, +0.15% pitching lower, thanks in part to some dreadful Eurozone manufacturing sentiment data. Europe stocks SXXP, -0.75% are selling off in response. Oil CLV19, -0.07% has pared gains, while investors are piling into gold GCZ19, +0.73% and the dollar DXY, +0.19% is up. Asia markets ADOW, +0.06% had a tough day.\n\nRead: Costly repairs to Saudi Aramco oil facilities could take months, not weeks\n\nThe chart\n\nRob Hanna of the Quantifiable Edges blog says the week starting the third Friday in September, which we are about to enter, has a really good chance of being a down one for the S&P 500. With a few exceptions, his chart that dates back to the 1960s shows that this tough week has consistently played out.\n\nHere\u2019s what would have happened if you had traded $100,000 over those years by buying the S&P SPX, -0.49% on the open after the third Friday of September, and then selling it at the end of the week:\n\nThe buzz\n\nA bloc of WeWork directors is plotting a push to pressure Adam Neumann to step down as chief executive after a rocky week in which his eccentric behavior came to light and the startup put its stock-market listing on hold.\n\nAn e-cigarette ban could have massive implications next year. \u201cWhile parents may be concerned about e-cigarettes, the people who genuinely care about vaping as a voting issue so far outweighs the number of people Trump needs to win in 2020 that they are royally screwing themselves by doing this,\u201d Paul Blair, the director of strategic initiatives at Americans for Tax Reform, explained to Axios.\n\nIndonesian investigators have found design and oversight lapses played a key role in the crash of a Boeing BA, -1.31% 737 MAX jet in October, sources told the Wall Street Journal. They also said the investigation also identified a string of pilot errors and maintenance mistakes as causal factors.\n\nThe stat\n\n150,000 \u2014 That\u2019s how many holidaymakers, are stranded overseas after U.K. travel agent Thomas Cook ceased trading as talks failed to produce a funding lifeline.\n\nThe quote\n\n\u201cTrump deserves to be investigated. He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him the question, why is he on the phone with a foreign leader trying to intimidate a foreign leader, if that\u2019s what happened\u201d \u2014 Joe Biden, weighing in on the latest White House controversy.\n\nMitt Romney echoes his concern and President Trump had something to say as well:\n\n..Breaking News: The Ukrainian Government just said they weren\u2019t pressured at all during the \u201cnice\u201d call. Sleepy Joe Biden, on the other hand, forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son\u2019s company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine. That\u2019s the real story! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2019\n\nThe economy\n\nNew York Fed President John Williams is due to speak in what will be closely followed markets. On the data front, the Chicago Fed national activity index for August is due.
