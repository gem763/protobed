And guess what, it\u2019s CELLULIT!!!!\u2019\n\nShe continued: \u2018I\u2019m just literally sooooo tired of being ashamed of my body, editing it (yes the other bikini pics were edited \u2013 and I hate that I did that but it\u2019s the truth) so that others think I\u2019m THEIR idea of what beautiful is, but it\u2019s just not me. This is what I got.\u2019\n\nRising to fame as a teen, Demi has publicly battled with eating disorders and mental illness and suffered a near-fatal drug overdose last year, but has been keen to show that that time is behind her.\n\n\u2018I want this new chapter in my life to be about being authentic to who I am rather than trying to meet someone else\u2019s standards,\u2019 she wrote.\n\n\u2018So here\u2019s me, unashamed, unafraid and proud to own a body that has fought through so much and will continue to amaze me when I hopefully give birth one day.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
