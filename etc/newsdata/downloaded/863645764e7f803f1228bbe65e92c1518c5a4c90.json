'He knows he's missed the best chance he'll ever have of beating me, in our first fight.\n\n'If he couldn't do it when I was just coming back from that long lay off, fat and out of fighting condition then he doubts he ever will.\n\n'He also knows he's not getting any better at 34, that he's on the way down now and coming to the end of his career.\n\n'Me pull out? I'm a born fighting man. Absolutely, my next fight after I have some fun and keep myself active in WWE will be Deontay in February. Unless of course something goes drastically wrong.'\n\nWilder accused Fury of jeopardising recovery from a gruesome cut by making his WWE debut\n\nThat, he says, is 'less likely' to happen to him in Riyadh on Halloween night than it is to Wilder in his interim rematch with Luis Ortiz next month.\n\n'King Kong (Ortiz) almost had him in their first fight,' Fury adds. 'And if he does come through this one his only chance of beating me will be to land one huge shot with that freaky power. Because he can never outbox me.'\n\nRemind him that he rose miraculously, while virtually unconscious, from one of those Bronze Bomber blows in the last round of their first fight and he grins impishly: 'Add in how I fought on against Otto Walllin after getting that cut and... enough said about who's got the guts to go again.'\n\nFury also scotched suggestions that he might switch permanently to WWE if his fight with Strowman goes well, saying: 'after this one I'm back to concentrating full time on my boxing career.\n\n'I'm doing this to keep busy, because I've always been fascinated by WWE and my son Prince loves it so much he wants to be a wrestler not a boxer when he grows up.\n\n'And believe me I've got the worst aches and pains and bumps and bruises ever from training and practising for WWE. It's super physical and any idea I may have had about it being fake have been kicked right out of touch.\n\nMeanwhile Fury is preparing for a bizarre WWE showdown with Braun Strowman (L) next week\n\n'But what I love most is the classic purity of boxing and what excites me most is that no other heavyweight in the world can match my skills.'\n\nThat assessment includes not only Wilder but Anthony Joshua, who he hopes will regain his upsettingly lost world titles in his Saudi rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr on December 7.\n\n'As long as AJ does it we can have a fight next year which would be even more massive in the UK than me and Wilder.'\n\nFury does concede there is a risk of serious injury against Strowman but as he gets ready to bank $15million (\u00a311.6m) from that night's work he says: 'I got up from that punch by Wilder which would have would kept anyone else down for a fortnight He had better expect to see me in Las Vegas on Feb 22.
