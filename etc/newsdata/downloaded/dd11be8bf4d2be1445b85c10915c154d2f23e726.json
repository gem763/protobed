Old people are walking alone, escaping the city. People in wheelchairs, shepherds, surrounded their flocks, all rushing in the hopes of finding a safer place.\u201d\n\nAccording to Garcia, \u201cthere have been explosions; we have seen several planes flying over the city, and they [the Turks] used artillery to shell the city and planes to bomb the surrounding villages.\u201d\n\nSYRIAN KURDS FEAR 'ETHNIC CLEANSING' AFTER U.S. TROOP PULLOUT ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nAfter days of threats, Turkey unleashed military might on Wednesday with the intention of clearing out the U.S-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) from its border region, in what Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan described as preventing \u201cthe creation of a terror corridor across our southern border.\u201d\n\nThe sudden policy shift came following a phone call between President Trump and Erdogan on Sunday, prompting the immediate withdrawal of 150 U.S. troops stationed in the area. The move has brought with it bombs and blasts. It has also inspired a revolt in the sprawling al-Hol refugee camp, home to 60,000 Syrians displaced from areas previously controlled by the Islamic State (ISIS).\n\n\u201cThere is violence against the guards, tent fires and unrest. The situation in the camp has been growing more critical as the Turkish threats have grown,\u201d sources on the ground told Fox News on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cAnd with the outbreak of aerial attacks and bombardments today, the situation has reached a boiling point.\u201d\n\nThe unrest is depicted as being led by \u201cpro-ISIS women.\u201d\n\nThe Rojava Information Center said that the Kurdish Red Crescent was moving teams from other areas to provide support, cautioning that the shifting of personnel would have \u201ca negative impact on care in all the camps.\u201d\n\nSDF leaders this week expressed profound concern for the thousands of ISIS fighters detained under their authority, highlighting that they don\u2019t have the resources to effectively guard the fighters \u2013 many who are foreign \u2013 without U.S. support, and if their attention is focused on war with Turkey there's no certainty that revolts won't ensue.\n\n\u201cTurkey put its airplanes into action and started striking around us. They also fired with mortars and tanks on the city, striking a school,\u201d claimed Azad Evdike, a 42-year-old based in Serekaniye. \u201cPeople are scared and have fled the city. But those of us who remain are not scared; we must fight. We cannot do anything more. We either resist, or we resist.\u201d\n\nFROM JAIL, REMORSEFUL EX-ISIS FIGHTER WARNS: GROUP WILL RETOOL AND RETURN\n\nFor decades, Ankara has been at war with Kurdish separatists in its remote mountains -- that's the Kurdistan Workers Party, better known as the PKK. The group is closely aligned with Kurdish fighters in Syria, many of whom dominate the ranks of the U.S-supported SDF.\n\nThe onslaught wedged Washington between two allies \u2013 its NATO partner Turkey and the rugged Kurdish-led militia it used as a potent ground against ISIS in the region.\n\nDespite criticism from both sides of the political aisle in D.C., Trump has remained firm in his decision to withdraw the remaining U.S. troops.\n\n\u201cThe stupid endless wars for us, are ending!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut those surrounded by the mayhem aren't dwelling on politics; their focus is simple survival. At least seven people have been killed in the clashes, and a local military hospital is already tending to the wounded, sources said.\n\n\u201cWe have lived through such a situation when ISIS and al-Nusra occupied our city,\u201d said Xemgin, a Serekaniye native. \u201cWe defeated both. Some people have left the city because they are afraid, but most of us are ready. We will stay here and defend ourselves as civilians of this land.\u201d", "description": "It was a chillingly familiar sight for Syrian-Kurds in the north-eastern slice of their conflict-ripped country: civilians stuffing themselves into vehicles and running on calloused feet with little more than the clothes on their back, fleeing the border towns.", "authors": ["Hollie Mckay", "Hollie Mckay Has A Been A Fox News Digital Staff Reporter Since She Has Extensively Reported War Zones Including Iraq", "Syria", "Yemen", "Afghanistan", "Pakistan", "Burma", "Latin America Investigates Global Conflicts", "War Crimes", "Terrorism Around The World.
