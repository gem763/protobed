At one point, speaking with a pair of unidentified men, Giuliani declares: \u201cThe problem is we need some money.\u201d\n\nNearly 10 seconds of silence tick by before Giuliani clarifies: \u201cWe need a few hundred thousand.\u201d\n\nIt was not the first time that Giuliani had left remnants of a conversation on Schapiro\u2019s phone. In a voicemail in September, he can be heard railing against the family of Joe Biden, suggesting with no evidence that he knows of corrupt activities by the former vice president.\n\nCalls and texts to Giuliani seeking clarity about the messages went unreturned Friday. And Schapiro, in an appearance on MSNBC, said he had tried without success to ask Giuliani about the unusual recordings.\n\n\u201cI have yet to receive an intentional or unintentional call back,\u201d Schapiro said.\n\nGiven Giuliani\u2019s sensitive role in the impeachment inquiry, and his taste for the spotlight, there was some speculation that the messages could have been staged. But based on reactions from the Washington press corps who cover him, Giuliani, 75, is an accomplished inadvertent caller. On social media, the Giuliani stories began to flow.\n\n\u201cEveryone has a good Rudy butt dial story,\u201d Josh Dawsey, a Washington Post White House reporter, wrote on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019ve heard him on what sounded like a plane, at the airport, at what sounded like a bar.\u201d\n\nJonathan Swan, a White House reporter for Axios, had another story. \u201cHe once texted me a voice memo recording of himself talking to a guy,\u201d Swan recalled. \u201cI couldn\u2019t make any sense of it or figure out how he managed to text me a recording inadvertently.\u201d\n\nDavid Martosko, a journalist at the Daily Mail, remembered once bumping into Giuliani and a Fox News producer at a Washington television studio. \u201cHe was just finishing telling her a story,\u201d Martosko wrote on Twitter, referring to the producer. \u201cIt ended with: \u2018And I butt-dialed him! Can you believe it?\u2019\u201d\n\nAccidents aside, Giuliani relies heavily on his telephone to communicate. He is a frequent texter and often eager to engage with reporters. In a recent parlor game of sorts in Washington, journalists posted pictures of their smartphone conversations with the former New York mayor.\n\nOliver Darcy, a CNN media reporter, joked on Twitter last week that it was \u201cstarting to feel like I might be the only reporter not texting with\u201d Giuliani.\n\nInadvertent phone calls have yet to join the pantheon of legendary reporting methods. But the smartphone era is young.\n\n\u201cI can tell you,\u201d Schapiro said Friday on MSNBC, \u201cI did not go to sleep that night expecting to wake up in the morning with a three-minute voicemail message from Rudy Giuliani.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n\u00a9 2019 The New York Times Company", "description": "WASHINGTON -- Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump's personal lawyer and a key figure in the impeachment inquiry, managed to inadvertently telephone an NBC News reporter at 11 p.m. one night this month and leave a lengthy voice message filled with snippets of an overheard conversation.In the muffled", "authors": ["Michael M.
