ArcHeritage/English Heritage\n\n\u201cOur investigation will tell us much about Bronze Age metalworking technology, how the bronze artefacts were used \u2013 and their potential role in the belief systems of that time,\u201d said archaeologist Andy Peachey, a prehistorian from Archaeological Solutions, the specialist unit which carried out the excavation.\n\nIt\u2019s the largest ever Bronze Age hoard to be discovered in London, and one of the three largest ever found in the UK.\n\nThe site, near Rainham in the London Borough of Havering, directly overlooks what would have been a large area of of frequently flooded Thames-side marshland.\n\nThe find is particularly significant because of the known ancient tradition of worshipping rivers as sacred. That tradition was strong throughout much of Britain and continental Europe, and parts of western and southern Asia.\n\nOn the whole, with relatively few exceptions, river deities tended to be female.\n\nThere are literally thousands of rivers in Europe and Asia associated with known and named ancient deities \u2013 including Sequana (the Seine), Sionann (the Shannon), Verbeia (the Wharf), Durius (the Douro in Portugal), Alpheus (River Alfeios in Greece), Tiberinus (the Tiber in Italy), and Ganga (the Ganges in India).\n\nIn dozens of cases the mythological narrative, revealing a river\u2019s divine status, has survived across the millennia.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

In aggregate, the artefacts weighed 45 kilos and represented around 300 originally complete objects.\n\nThe excavation also revealed three other pits \u2013 containing hundreds of fragments of broken pottery (potentially general refuse \u2013 or even the debris from small-scale ceremonial feasting).\n\nSignificantly, two other hoards of metalwork are known from the area, discovered just a few miles away back in the 1950s and the 1960s.\n\nThe precise location and nature of the site itself (at the end of a promontory and immediately adjacent to and facing directly onto one of the Thames Valley\u2019s largest wetlands) suggests a potential ritual or ceremonial function, rather than a purely commercial one.\n\nIntriguingly, the circular building\u2019s entranceway faces north, which is not the norm for ordinary residential roundhouses.\n\nHowever, in most other cases of marshland-related metalwork deposits, the prehistoric rituals involved placing bronze artefacts in (or throwing them into) rivers and swamps, rather than merely burying them immediately adjacent to a wetland.\n\nAlthough a prehistoric commercial function cannot be completely ruled out, it is conceivable that the artefacts may have been held in storage within the complex, awaiting eventual ritual deposition in the adjacent swamp. Indeed, it is possible that burying it within a sacred enclosure would have been seen as giving the items sacred status, if the intention was to later deposit them in the adjacent marsh.\n\nHowever, the bronzes were all deposited in the pits at virtually the same time \u2013 but at the very end of the lifetime of the complex. It is therefore also possible that they were interred as an act of ritual closure \u2013 marking the sanctified decommissioning of this probably sacred site overlooking the Thames-side marshes.\n\nIf indeed the complex was a ritual or ceremonial centre involved in the veneration of water spirits \u2013 or of a river deity \u2013 it will raise the question as to the potential identity of a prehistoric Thames god or goddess.\n\nAlthough there are at least half a dozen Roman and Romano Celtic temples (all dating from at least 900 years after the Rainham complex), none of them give any clue as to what the name of such an ancient Thames deity might have been.\n\nSince at least the 18th century, Old Father Thames has been a popular literary and artistic motif \u2013 but he is probably a romantic early modern invention.\n\nAny truly ancient Thames deity would almost certainly have been female (like other British, Irish and French examples).\n\nCertainly, votive offerings have been deposited in the Thames for the past 5,500 years. The oldest known name for London\u2019s river is the Tamessa (Tamesis in Latin).\n\nHowever, that name was almost certainly originally pre-Celtic \u2013 and potentially even pre-Indo-European. It seems to be linked with an Old European word meaning \u2018to flow\u2019.\n\nSo it can potentially just be translated as \u201cthe flowing one\u201d \u2013 ie simply \u201cThe River\u201d. Sadly, its more specific original name (if it ever had one) is lost, submerged at some point far back in the stream of time.\n\nCommenting on the discovery of the Rainham Bronze Age metalwork, Roy Stephenson, historic environment lead at the Museum of London, said: \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly rare to have uncovered a hoard of this size on one site\u201d.\n\nDuncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: \u201cThis extraordinary discovery adds immensely to our understanding of Bronze Age life.\u201d\n\nThe bronzes will go on display for the first time as the focal point of a major exhibition at the Museum of London Docklands in April 2020.", "description": "Archaeological research may be about to shed remarkable new light on one of London\u2019s greatest prehistoric mysteries \u2013 the ancient religious status of the River Thames.
