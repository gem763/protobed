REUTERS/Brendan McDermid More\n\nThe culprit? Margin compression. \u201cExcluding Financials and Utilities, S&P 500 margins are expected to contract by 108 bp, more than offsetting forecast sales growth of 5%,\u201d the analysts wrote. \u201cMargins are projected to decline in every sector.\u201d\n\nThough the analysts remind investors that stocks with high leverage may see a boost to margins as interest rates have come down precipitously over the past several months. \u201cThe 10-year Treasury (^TNX) yield averaged 1.8% in 3Q 2019 compared with 2.9% a year ago,\u201d Goldman Sachs analysts wrote.\n\nPositive surprises\n\nWhile expectations are pricing in an earnings per share decline for the third quarter, Wall Street was also expecting a decline in the beginning of the first and second quarter earnings seasons earlier this year. Fears of an earnings recession reached fever pitch. But the declines didn\u2019t materialize.\n\nThat\u2019s because corporate tax rates actually came in lower than what analysts had expected, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\n\u201cAnalysts overestimated corporate tax rates in 1Q and 2Q. The effective 1Q tax rate was 310 bp lower than consensus expected at the start of the quarter (22% vs. 18.9%), and 140 bp lower in 2Q (21% vs. 19.6%),\u201d the analysts wrote. \u201cThe 3Q tax rate estimate of 20.1% stands 50 bp above last quarter\u2019s realized rate.\u201d\n\n2020 outlook\n\nWhile Wall Street is expecting a 6% decline in year-over-year earnings per share for all of 2019, the 2020 consensus is for 10% growth.\n\nGoldman Sachs\u2019 2020 earnings per share forecasts are a little less rosy, with growth of 6% amid rising input costs.\n\n\u201cMany firms have been unable to keep pace with their input cost inflation,\u201d the analysts said.\n\nAMS More\n\nScott Gamm is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
