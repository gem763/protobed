The effort started in 2014 with the Israeli irrigation company Netafim and support from the Italian and Israeli governments.\n\n\u201cGrowers are concerned about climate change\u201d in Europe, Professor Peterlunger said. In his region, he said: \u201cIt rained a lot in May, which caused some problems during flowering and fruit set. June, July and August were really hot, and that is not optimal for grapevines.\u201d\n\nNaftali Lazarovitch , a soil scientist at the Blaustein Institutes of Desert Research in the Negev, also studies desert viticulture at the research vineyard. Europeans \u201care looking at Israel and the way we are dealing with harsh conditions and trying to learn from it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe produce more with less, that\u2019s our objective.\u201d\n\nMore than 40 percent of the earth\u2019s terrestrial surface is made up of drylands, including tropical dry forests, savannas and deserts, that are home to roughly 2.5 billion people. These regions are already threatened by resource overuse and desertification and more vulnerable to extreme weather, including droughts, heat waves and dust storms, according to a recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nMost of Israel is arid; the Negev spans more than half of the country. Out of necessity, Israel has honed desert agriculture to yield bountiful crops. In the 1940s, the Polish-Israeli inventor Simcha Blass pioneered modern drip-irrigation systems that now are used around the world.\n\nDesert agriculture has existed in the region since ancient times. The Nabateans, nomadic Arab peoples dating to the fourth century B.C., used runoff and built small stone dams to divert water to irrigate crops and grow wine grapes.", "description": "Scientists are testing techniques for growing vines in a hot, parched future.", "authors": ["Amy Yee"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/23/multimedia/23sp-israel-inyt-3/23sp-israel-inyt-3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
