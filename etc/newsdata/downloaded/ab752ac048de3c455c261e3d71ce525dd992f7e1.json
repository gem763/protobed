USA TODAY\n\nThe NFL trade market has been doing brisk business this year.\n\nWe've seen deals involving multiple first-round selections changing hands (Jalen Ramsey, Laremy Tunsil). We've seen a young first-round talent unloaded unusually early for a premium pick (Minkah Fitzpatrick). Pro Bowlers like Jadeveon Clowney and Marcus Peters have been moved in recent months. Even veterans that might have seemed over the hill \u2014 think Robert Quinn or Carlos Hyde \u2014 have become impact players after being swapped. All this followed an offseason when studs like Odell Beckham Jr., Olivier Vernon, Frank Clark and Dee Ford were dealt.\n\nNew York Jets defensive end Leonard Williams (92) celebrates during the second half against the Buffalo Bills at MetLife Stadium. (Photo: Vincent Carchietta, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nOct. 29 is the deadline to make deals, and the Rams got busy Tuesday, acquiring Ramsey and Austin Corbett while shedding Peters in three separate moves. And with so many analytically savvy general managers seemingly more willing to engage in trade talks, the next two weeks could be quite active league-wide.\n\nMore: Los Angeles Rams' trade for Ramsey follows aggressive trend, but feels desperate\n\nHere are 19 names (listed alphabetically) to keep an eye on for various reasons:\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers OLB Shaq Barrett: With nine sacks in his first four games, he was generating early buzz as a defensive player of the year candidate. Nagging injuries have slowed him down recently, but this week's bye and the remnants of a $4 million story could make him an attractive pass rush option while potentially allowing the Bucs to flip what was virtually a throwaway signing for more than pocket change. Logical fits: Lions, Ravens\n\nAtlanta Falcons OLB Vic Beasley: Since leading the league with 15\u00bd sacks during 2016's run to the Super Bowl, he's totaled just 11\u00bd. Maybe his expiring contract and a change of scenery could rekindle his career, especially if a team that was willing to turn him loose on passing downs came calling. Logical fits: Bills, Chiefs, Seahawks\n\nNew England Patriots DL Michael Bennett: His snaps steadily decreasing and now suspended a game for conduct detrimental to the team, it's obviously not working out well with Bill Belichick. But even at 33 and with his unique personality, Bennett's versatility and ability to disrupt might still be alluring to somebody for another year or two. Logical fits: Cowboys, Saints, Seahawks\n\nTennessee Titans RT Jack Conklin: An all-pro as a rookie in 2016, injuries hampered him to the point that the Titans declined his fifth-year option, meaning Conklin should hit free agency next year. His play has picked back up, and he could be a valuable commodity at a spot that's often hard to fill. Logical fits: 49ers, Cowboys, Lions, Patriots\n\nMiami Dolphins RB Kenyan Drake: In his walk year, explosive talent could give a struggling run game a boost. Fins are obviously open for business and seem to be using Mark Walton more anyway. Logical fits: Bears, Lions, Rams\n\nPittsburgh Steelers OLB Bud Dupree: Solid if unspectacular edge defender whom Steelers could opt to dangle if they decide they're sellers. Dupree is ticketed for free agency but might still bring back some capital for a team that might want to recoup some after surrendering next year's first rounder in the Fitzpatrick transaction. Logical fits: Lions, Rams, Texans\n\nLos Angeles Chargers RB Melvin Gordon: It's not entirely his fault, but not a good look when you don't produce on the heels of a disruptive holdout. Logical fits: Lions, Rams\n\nCincinnati Bengals WR A.J. Green: Rookie coach Zac Taylor swears the seven-time Pro Bowler \u2014 an ankle injury has kept Green, who's not under contract for 2020, sidelined all season \u2014 won't be traded. But the Ramsey deal was a reminder things can change quickly when you meet a willing dance partner ... though the Bengals typically arrive and leave dances stag. Logical fits: 49ers, Bills, Colts, Packers, Patriots, Raiders\n\nDenver Broncos CB Chris Harris: One of the league's premier slot corners should hit the open market after the season. In the interim, he could be available to fill a valuable role. Logical fits: 49ers, Bills, Eagles, Seahawks, Texans\n\nTitans RB Derrick Henry: He's basically a one-trick pony, but it's quite a trick when Henry is in a groove. He could certainly use a better offensive situation to showcase his skills heading into free agency. Logical fits: Lions, Patriots, Rams\n\nCarolina Panthers QB Cam Newton: Sure, it's a long shot he'll get moved in the coming days. But if the Panthers cast their lot with undefeated backup Kyle Allen, can they ever go back to Cam, who's under contract through 2020? Any deal would presume another organization absorbing the remainder of Newton's contract and tailoring an offense to his skills. But it's not every day a recent MVP is potentially available to reboot your offense. Logical fits: Bears (upgrade over struggling Mitch Trubisky), Cowboys (hard to imagine, sure, yet things suddenly aren't going great with still-unpaid Dak Prescott), Titans (obviously).\n\nJacksonville Jaguars DE Yannick Ngakoue: He briefly held out this summer while looking for big-time bucks. Ngakoue had averaged 10 sacks per season entering 2019 but has struggled this year. But the pending free agent still has the good to energize a pass rush. Logical fits: Bills, Chiefs, Eagles, Lions, Raiders, Seahawks\n\nArizona Cardinals CB Patrick Peterson: Heard this one before? The three-time all-pro is fresh off a six-game suspension for PEDs and will be a free agent in 2021. Still, when a lockdown corner is potentially available, it's worth thinking about making an offer ... just ask the Rams. Logical fits: Chiefs, Eagles, Patriots, Saints\n\nBroncos WR Emmanuel Sanders: He's done a nice job coming back from last season's torn Achilles and could definitely provide a juice to a passing attack \u2014 particularly one where he wouldn't have to be the primary target. Logical fits: 49ers, Bills, Colts, Packers, Panthers\n\nWashington Redskins G Brandon Scherff: Pro Bowl-caliber guards don't grow on trees, and he'll augment most any line. Logical fits: Bears, Bills, Ravens, Texans\n\nBuccaneers DL Ndamukong Suh: He's become a bit of a mercenary in recent years but also served a reminder what a force he can be during the 2018 playoffs while with the Rams. Bucs would be wise to move him before he re-enters free agency in a few months. Logical fits: Eagles, Chiefs, Colts, Patriots, Raiders, Ravens, Seahawks\n\nTitans TE Delanie Walker: He's still getting it done \u2014 even at 35 and despite missing most of 2018 with a gruesome ankle injury. Be nice to see Walker join a contender for the next season-plus. Logical fits: Bears, Patriots, Seahawks\n\nNew York Jets DL Leonard Williams: The sixth pick of the 2015 draft won't wow you with his numbers, but he could be a Richard Seymour type with a better unit. If Jets aren't going to pay up, may as well shop the \"Big Cat\" rather than lose him for nothing in March \u2014 and Adam Gase definitely didn't shoot down the notion this week given Williams could be one of the most sought-after commodities at deadline time. Logical fits: Bears, Chiefs, Colts, Eagles, Lions, Raiders, Ravens, Seahawks, Texans\n\nWashington Redskins LT Trent Williams: He doesn't want to be in Washington any longer, but the Redskins have been inexplicably loathe to trade a guy who could facilitate what's an obvious rebuild. A divorce sure looks like the best course of action for all parties, and the seven-time Pro Bowler might just fetch a first rounder given his contract runs through 2020. Logical fits: 49ers, Browns, Patriots\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis", "description": "The NFL trade deadline is approaching, and there's already been significant movement with the Rams' deal for Jalen Ramsey.
