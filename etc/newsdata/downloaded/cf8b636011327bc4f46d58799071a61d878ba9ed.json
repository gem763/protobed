He has not been charged with anything publicly. It has all taken place in the secrecy of darkness.\n\nOnly three presidents have faced impeachment, and the two in recent history \u2014 Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton \u2014 were subject to the traditional protocol: the drafting of an impeachment resolution, which is put on the House floor for a vote. If the resolution passes, articles of impeachment are drawn up and presented to the Senate, which triggers a trial in the upper chamber.\n\nIn the effort against Donald Trump, Pelosi has unilaterally declared an impeachment inquiry and has given the House Intelligence Committee, led by Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), authority to lead the investigation.\n\nAnd that investigation has mainly consisted of behind-close-doors interviews with individuals Democrats hope can provide evidence that would support their impeachment effort \u2014 a fact that the left has defended as completely in order.\n\n\u201cThey can defend that if they wish, but I think the American people will see that as a stretch too far,\u201d Blackwell said, adding that even if the Democrats follow proper protocol, impeachment will mainly be symbolic.\u2019\n\nBlackwell told Breitbart News.:\n\nI think eventually Nancy Pelosi will have to take the formal vote, and when she does there will be 30 Democrat freshmen that will in fact be in the hot sea, and this will play out politically. The president might be impeached by this Congress. He\u2019s not going to be found guilty by the Senate.\n\nJenny Beth Martin, co-founder and national coordinator of the Tea Party Patriots and speaker and panelist at the summit, told Breitbart News she agreed that Pelosi\u2019s singular approach to impeachment is setting a \u201cdangerous precedent\u201d and is violating the Constitution.\n\nMoreover, both Martin and Blackwell said that impeachment will come back to haunt Democrats in 2020.\n\n\u201cI think [impeachment] will be front and center on everyone\u2019s mind,\u201d Martin said, adding that especially for the freshman Democrats who won a seat in the 2018 midterm election in districts where Trump won in 2016, will be facing voters who know they just impeached the president they helped elect.\n\n\u201cI think that is something that will be very hard for many voters to do,\u201d Martin said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to motivate our base,\u201d Blackwell said, adding that despite the Democrats constant attacks, Trump should not get distracted.\n\n\u201cIn the final analysis I think what the president has to do is to continue to lead this country towards prosperity, towards peace, and towards what I consider to be an opportunity society, not an expansion of the welfare state,\u201d Blackwell said.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "Conservative leaders told Breitbart News the Democrats' impeachment effort against President Donald Trump will backfire in the 2020 election.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Values-Voter-Summit-2019-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
