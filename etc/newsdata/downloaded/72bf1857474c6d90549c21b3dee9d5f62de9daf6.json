The new fossils show how mammals began to bounce back, growing in size and diversity over the millennia following the extinction. After a brief 300,000 years \u2013 a mere blip on the evolutionary timeline \u2013 the pig-sized Carsioptychus appeared on the scene, while Eoconodons, about the size of a wolf, started thriving another 400,000 years later.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going from a very small dog that you\u2019d see on the streets on New York City to a very large wolf within those hundreds of thousands of years,\u201d Stephen Chester, a mammalian paleontologist at Brooklyn College and an author on the paper, told the Times.\n\nThe research team also gathered thousands of samples of fossilized leaves and ferns \u2013 important sources of food \u2013 as well as over 37,000 pollen grains, which could answer a number of other questions about the rise of mammals on Earth.\n\nA geoscientist at the University of Florida, Courtney Sprain, marvelled at the detail and completeness of the fresh fossil collection, noting that the level of preservation was \u201camazing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of the really spectacular things about this paper, just how amazing the preservation is and how good the record is for [seeing] a variety of different changes following a mass extinction,\u201d she told the Times.\n\nLike this story?
