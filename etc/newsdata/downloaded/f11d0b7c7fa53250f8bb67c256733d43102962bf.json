(AP) - State union employees told lawmakers Tuesday they are concerned that staff shortages - of about 2,600, according to a 2018 study - are causing safety issues, including some injuries, for employees at certain agencies.\n\nMaryland lawmakers, state officials and union members gathered in Annapolis to address the shortage during a joint hearing before the Senate Budget and Taxation Committee and the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nHogan Administration officials said during the hearing that they are aware of the safety concerns and are working to address them, along with the shortage.\n\nJason Kramer, policy analyst with Legislative Services, said during the hearing that the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services alone had a need for more than 1,000 employees, while agencies like the Department of Juvenile Services and Department of Health were short more than 200 positions each, according to the study.\n\nDelegate Marc Korman, D-Montgomery, noted during the hearing that recent safety incidents \u201ctriggered\u201d the meeting Tuesday morning, which also included testimony from members of Maryland\u2019s American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees - a public employee trade union. The members, donning green union shirts, filled the seats in the hearing room.\n\nIn a news conference held shortly before the hearing, Patrick Moran - the president of the union - spoke of what he described as \u201csystematic underfunding and delays\u201d in filling vacancies. He said the union is demanding \u201cimmediate action,\u201d but also noted that the members present in Annapolis had \u201cno confidence\u201d in Gov. Larry Hogan as an employer.\n\nMike Ricci, a spokesman for Hogan, said in a written statement that once the union, \u201cagrees to the ground rules that require them to bargain in good faith - rules that other unions have agreed to year after year - our administration is ready and willing to move forward with negotiations.\u201d\n\nDelegate Shelly Hettleman, D-Baltimore County, attended the news conference and said that state employees are \u201cunderpaid and overworked,\u201d and the staffing shortages are \u201cputting people in danger.\u201d\n\nJeremy Jeffers, a resident adviser with the Department of Juvenile Services, testified during the hearing and said he has personally dealt with the \u201cdangers\u201d of understaffing, noting that he has been assaulted \u201cmultiple times,\u201d suffered six concussions and even lost part of his finger during an incident.\n\n\u201cI would challenge anyone to come and spend a shift,\u201d Jeffers said.\n\nIkeia Cornish, a direct care assistant at Eastern Shore Hospital Center, also testified and said one of her coworkers was \u201cblindsided\u201d and beaten by one of the patients. She referred to staffing shortages as a \u201ccrisis,\u201d which leads to \u201cmore staff and patient injuries\u201d and an \u201cunsecure environment\u201d\n\nRepresentatives from the Hogan Administration also testified during the hearing and addressed what is being done to alleviate the staffing problem. David Brinkley, secretary of the Department of Budget and Management, said the administration takes the staffing shortage issue \u201cvery seriously\u201d and is focused on \u201chard-to-fill\u201d positions like correctional officers.\n\nNick Pepersack, Brinkley\u2019s deputy chief of staff, later confirmed to Capital News Service that those employees received a nearly 10% salary increase between January and July of this year.\n\nTotal salary enhancements in the last and current fiscal years, Pepersack said, amounted to approximately $467 million for employees statewide.\n\nRobert Neall, secretary of the Department of Health, said there is now an \u201cincrease in emphasis\u201d on reporting all incidents at state hospitals and he looks \u201cforward to reporting more progress\u201d in January.\n\nDelegate Kirill Reznik, D-Montgomery, addressed Neall during the hearing and said while he has \u201cno doubt\u201d that the secretary is trying, \u201cwe have been here before.\u201d\n\n\u201cEver year we hear, \u2018these are all the things we are doing\u2019 . and every year, we come back here,\u201d Reznik said.\n\nPressed by Reznik on where the department will be in terms of vacancies next year, Neall repeated that he expects \u201csignificant\u201d progress, but could not answer the question \u201cwith specificity.\u201d\n\nSen. Andrew Serafini, R-Washington, told Capital News Service after the hearing that with regard to the safety incidents, \u201cwe have a more violent community in general.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that we don\u2019t care\u201d about state employees, Serafini said, adding that the characterization to the contrary is \u201cproblematic.\u201d\n\n___\n\nThis story was produced by the University of Maryland\u2019s Capital News Service.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "State union employees told lawmakers Tuesday they are concerned that staff shortages - of about 2,600, according to a 2018 study - are causing safety issues, including some injuries, for employees at certain agencies.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Elliott Davis"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
