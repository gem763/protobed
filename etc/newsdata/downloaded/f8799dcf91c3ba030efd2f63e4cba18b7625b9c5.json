I want to complete this Aichi Triennale, one of the biggest art festivals in Japan, in an amicable way,\" Aichi Governor Hideaki Omura said late Monday.\n\nThe girl's statue symbolises the sex slaves -- sometimes referred to as \"comfort women\" -- who were forced to work in wartime Japanese military brothels during World War II.\n\nOmura, who heads the organisers, said in August they received a number of threatening emails, phone calls, and faxes about the exhibition.\n\nMainstream historians say up to 200,000 women -- mostly from Korea, but also other parts of Asia including China -- were forced to work in Japanese military brothels.\n\nActivists have in recent years set up dozens of statues in public venues around the world, many of them in South Korea, in honour of the victims.\n\nThe statues have drawn Tokyo's ire, which has pressed for the removal of one outside its Seoul embassy.\n\nIn recent months, bilateral relations between Japan and South Korea have frayed over a long-running dispute on the use of forced labour during World War II.\n\nThe two sides have rescinded each other's favoured export partner statuses, and Seoul announced it would scrap an agreement to share sensitive military information.", "description": "A Japanese exhibition of censored art works reopens Tuesday two months after it was forced to close following threats over a controversial South Korean...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/05/wire-19426706-1570508856-425_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
