On Tuesday, jury selection began in the case of the alleged murderer\u2014a high school cheerleader accused of killing her newborn baby to protect her good-girl image.\n\nBrooke Skylar Richardson, now 20, is charged with aggravated murder, involuntary manslaughter, and three other felonies. She faces life in prison if convicted. Richardson\u2019s attorneys say she experienced a stillbirth and buried a fetus delivered at 33 weeks in the backyard. The state contends she purposefully killed an infant born alive because she did not want to be pregnant.\n\nThe case has sparked interest and outcry around the world, in part because of misleading reports that Richardson burned the fetal remains before burying them. It has also drawn concern from national advocacy groups who say charging Richardson with murder sets a dangerous precedent for pregnant people. The trial is expected to last two to three weeks, and has already drawn national media to the 5,000-person town of Carlisle.\n\nAuthorities discovered the remains of the infant, whom Richardson\u2019s family says she named Annabelle, after being tipped off by the teenager\u2019s doctors in the summer of 2017. Prosecutors say Richardson had an \u201cextreme\u201d reaction after being told she was pregnant and did not return for follow-up prenatal visits. Another physician called police after Richardson came in months later and told her she had \u201cgone into labor, delivered a stillborn baby, and buried the baby in her backyard,\u201d according to court papers.\n\nProsecutors initially claimed that Richardson burned the baby before burying it, but the forensic anthropologist assigned to the case later appeared to recant that claim. In opening statements Tuesday, prosecutors said the evidence would still show that Richardson gave birth alone, buried the baby, disposed of the evidence, and kept it a secret from everyone\u2014including her parents.\n\nIn announcing the charges two years ago, the prosecution focused on painting the Richardson family as \"obsessed with external appearances,\u201d and their daughter as being willing to do anything to keep them up. They are expected to use evidence of her eating disorder, her time on the cheerleading squad and track team, and her participation in the National Honor Society\u2014evidence Richardson\u2019s defense has used to paint her as a rule-abiding overachiever\u2014as proof that she was preoccupied with maintaining her image.\n\nHer defense attorneys, meanwhile, say Richardson was the victim of a \u201cmassive rush to judgment.\u201d They have claimed her response to learning she was pregnant was normal and expected for a teenager, and said Tuesday that she hadn\u2019t told her family about the pregnancy before what they say was a miscarriage because she did not expect to give birth so soon.\n\nAttorney Charles Rittger blasted the prosecution for refusing to retract the claim that Richardson burned the baby, even after the forensic anthropologist walked back her statements, and for leaning heavily on statements he said Richardson made under grueling police interrogation.\n\n\u201cThey disregard all truth that does not fit into their story,\u201d he said in the courtroom Tuesday.\n\nRichardson\u2019s trial was delayed for years in part because the defense moved several times to omit evidence, and twice to have the charges dismissed. Her attorneys say she has been unable to find a job in that time period, and is working part-time for their law firm while attending community college.", "description": "Photo Illustration by The Daily Beast / Photo Courtesy Warren County Sheriff's OfficeIn July 2017, police in small-town Carlisle, Ohio uncovered an unmarked infant\u2019s grave in the backyard of a prominent family.
