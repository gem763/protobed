In addition, it said a person alleges that Mr. Buck continued to solicit men for sex and drug use after another man suffered a fatal overdose in his apartment in January of this year. Mr. Buck, 65 years old, is a longtime donor to the Democratic Party who has given money to Barack Obama \u2019s and Hillary Clinton \u2019s presidential campaigns, according to OpenSecrets.org. Mr. Buck\u2019s attorney Seymour Amster didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Amster has previously denied that Mr. Buck had any role in the deaths of men in his apartment, NBC News has reported. The charges come after state authorities arrested Mr. Buck in connection with a non-fatal methamphetamine overdose that occurred in his West Hollywood apartment last week. He was charged with battery causing serious injury, administering methamphetamine and maintaining a drug house, the Los Angeles County district attorney\u2019s office said. If convicted on the federal charge, Mr. Buck faces a minimum of 20 years in prison and a maximum of a life sentence without parole. The other charges carry a maximum sentence of five years and eight months.\n\nCopyright \u00a92019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.
