Daily Mail Australia does not suggest the family were using the child to commit an offence or that they were committing any other kind of offence.\n\nLawyers for the child Todd Scott and Dean Woodbury said the alleged incident was a violation of basic human rights.\n\n'Strip searching a one-year-old child is a disgraceful violation of someone who \u2026 is completely incapable of asserting or defending their basic human rights,' Mr Scott told The Daily Telegraph.\n\n'Unlawful strip searching appears to be rampant among NSW Police officers and something must be done urgently to stop this. Either there is deficient or insufficient training around this.'\n\nThe toddler is suing the state through the tutelage of his mother, after he was allegedly taken from his aunt's car and into a police bus near Kempsey Jail, in the Mid North Coast, on September 2, 2018 about 10am (stock image)\n\nPolice have not yet filed a defence to the court and cannot comment on whether the female officer has been disciplined.\n\nA NSW Police spokesman said: 'As there are civil proceedings current, it is not appropriate that the NSW Police Force comments.'\n\nThe child's 17-year-old aunt is also suing amid claims she was illegally strip searched during the prison visit.\n\nHer statement of claim says their was a breach of the law as a minor can only be strip searched in the company of a parent, guardian or acceptable third party.\n\nThe case is scheduled for a call over hearing at Port Macquarie District Court in November.", "description": "The child is suing the state through his mother, after he was allegedly taken from his aunt's car and into a police bus near\u00a0Kempsey Jail in New South Wales on September 2, 2018.", "authors": ["Zoe Zaczek For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/23/19345024-0-image-a-5_1570314116236.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
