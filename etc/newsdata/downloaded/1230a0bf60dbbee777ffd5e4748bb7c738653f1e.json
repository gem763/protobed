(Marie is mom to seven other children from her previous marriages to Stephen Craig from 1982 until 1985, and Brian Blosil from 1986 until 2007.)\n\nOsmond told the magazine that her late son 'was that piece in our family that fit us all together,' and 'such a joy and a light in [her] life.'\n\nMarie, a co-host on The Talk, said she often envisions what Michael would have been doing if he was alive today.\n\n'When I see my children marrying and having families, I wonder where my son would be, if he'd be married or if he'd be a dad,' Osmond said. 'He always wanted to be a daddy since he was a little boy.'\n\nStrength: Marie said she immersed herself in her faith in the wake of Michael's death. She appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert earlier this week\n\nHeartbreaking: Marie, a co-host on The Talk, said she often envisions what Michael would have been doing if he was alive today\n\nMarie said she immersed herself in her faith in the wake of Michael's death: 'You have to find a way to breathe again. Mine was my faith. I have great faith, and I know I will see him again.'\n\nShe said that since Michael was attending college at the time of his 2010 passing - he was a student at the The Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising - and that she 'missed the days that he was depressed' and 'couldn't look him in the eyes' to recognize it.\n\nMarie told the magazine it's a relief to her to be able to help others dealing with depression.\n\nUpsetting: Marie revealed her late son 'bullied very heavily right up until the time that he committed suicide' earlier this week\n\nEntertainment mainstay: Marie was snapped earlier this year in Las Vegas\n\n'There is no joy in sorrow, but the joy is to be able to look at somebody who is going through it and tell them, \"You'll be okay.\"'\n\nShe said that she believed her son's drug use 'at a young age' contributed to the issues that haunted him later in life.\n\n'I think when you start altering the brain, especially during its maturing and growing process, it's dangerous,' she said. 'It can cause mental issues. And I don't think there is enough fear about it.'\n\nEarlier this week, on The Talk, Marie revealed her late son was 'bullied very heavily right up until the time that he committed suicide, because of his sobriety,' and that she saved the text messages that proved as much.\n\n'I've got the texts - I mean they're horrendous, and I never took action against it,' she said, 'but I can tell you, honestly, that I believe that that was a high component in him just feeling overwhelmed and that he didn\u2019t fit in.'\n\nMarie added that she 'never took action against the three kids.'", "description": "'You can't breathe,' the 59-year-old show biz veteran told People Thursday of the suffering she experienced in the wake of the tragedy.", "authors": ["Adam S.
