Someone on the subway just elbowed me in the ribs, and my upstairs neighbors are once again dragging their couch for fun. It's moments like these I find myself obsessively planning travel. And when I do, I'm the most excited about selecting my hotel.\n\nA great hotel is bliss. It's a beautiful escape where I'm made to feel special and valued (hopefully anyway), the base from where I will embark on exciting adventures, and where I'll enjoy sweet, peaceful rest. More than a place to rest my head, the plush serenity of a crisp hotel bed and spa-like bath are unmatched.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, I like nice things. Sadly, they can come with a hefty price tag. Sleek boutique and upscale hotels typically cost anywhere from $250 to thousands of dollars a night, and I'm in no position to regularly spend such funds.\n\nBut that doesn't mean an affordable dream stay is unattainable. It just requires more research. If you love the feeling of luxury without overpaying, you'll adore these properties \u2014 especially considering they are all $100 a night or less, subject to availability.\n\nAnd fear not, these are not a 'get what you pay for' situation. I vetted top-ranked hotels around the world on Trip Advisor, my favorite hotel aggregator, sorted by the 'Traveler Ranked' feature. I filtered for price of course, as well as properties rated three stars or above, with a Trip Advisor rating of four plus, and scoured for glowing reviews. I opted for all types of properties, but if you love B&Bs or dislike apartment rentals, be sure to select accordingly. Trip Advisor offers pricing for many outlets, and partners with places like Booking.com, Orbitz, Hotels.com, and others to share the best deals. For the lowest price, try to travel midweek and avoid pricey holidays.\n\nHere's where you can feel five star at a fraction of the price, around the world.", "description": "A great hotel doesn\u2019t have to cost a fortune; it can even come in under $100.
