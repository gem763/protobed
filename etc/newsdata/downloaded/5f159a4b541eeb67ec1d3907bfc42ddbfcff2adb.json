That would be made available in an \u2018early access\u2019 mode which is essentially a limited beta, and Musk qualified that this isn\u2019t a sure thing.\n\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s going to be tight, it still does appear that will be at least in limited in early access release of a feature complete self-driving feature this year,\u201d he said on the call.\n\nHe added that it\u2019s \u201cnot for sure,\u201d but that it \u201cappears to be on track\u201d for a limited private beta by year\u2019s end.\n\nThis follows the release of Tesla\u2019s Smart Summon automated parking lot driverless parking lot hailing feature. It allows Tesla owners to call their cars from their parking spots to pick them up from a curbside within the parking lot. The feature has been used plenty of times with mixed results reported from early use, but Musk also said that the company will be releasing an updated version of the software with improvements in the next \u201cweek or so.\u201d\n\nThe Smart Summon update is an improvement built on the data taken from the \u201cover a million\u201d uses of the feature by Tesla owners already since its release at the end of September.\n\nTo make use of the full self-driving mode that Tesla plans to introduce, vehicle owners will have to own the FSD upgrade package, which is a $7,000 upgrade after it increased from $6,000 in August.\n\nTesla began shipping its new full self-driving computer hardware in all new vehicles beginning in April, moving to its own custom chip. This was to ensure that enabling the FSD feature would be a software-only update, which is something the company had claimed would be possible with a previous generation of self-driving computing hardware, but the challenge has clearly been more difficult than expected \u2013 estimated timelines for the feature\u2019s deployment have also slipped multiple times.\n\nMusk added in response to a question later in the call that while he thinks \u2018early access\u2019 availability could be late this year, but full self-driving \u201creliable enough that you do not need to pay attention, in our opinion\u201d won\u2019t be available until \u201cthe end of next year.\u201d\n\nTo clarify what \u201cfeature-complete FSD\u201d means in this context, Musk later described multiple levels of Tesla\u2019s assessment of self-driving tech, and specified that this meant cars are \u201cable to be autonomous but requiring supervision and intervention at times.\u201d", "description": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk said on the company\u2019s earnings call today that the company\u2019s full self-driving mode, in a feature-complete release, could arrive as early as the end of this year.
