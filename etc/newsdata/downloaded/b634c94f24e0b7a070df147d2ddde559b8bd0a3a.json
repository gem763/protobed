And we're very excited to get this mission underway.\"\n\nNasa originally wanted to conduct an all-female spacewalk last spring, but did not have enough medium-size suits ready to go.\n\nMs Koch and Ms Meir were supposed to install more new batteries in a spacewalk next week, but had to venture out three days earlier to deal with an equipment failure that occurred over the weekend. They need to replace an old battery charger for one of the three new batteries that was installed last week by Ms Koch and Andrew Morgan.\n\n\"Jessica and Christina, we are so proud of you. You're going to do great today,\" Mr Morgan radioed from inside as the women exited the hatch.\n\nMs Meir, making her spacewalking debut, became the 228th person in the world to conduct a spacewalk and the 15th woman.\n\nIt was the fourth spacewalk for Ms Koch, who is seven months into an 11-month mission that will be the longest ever by a woman.", "description": "The world's first female spacewalking team made history high above Earth on Friday, floating out of the International Space Station to fix a broken part of the power network.", "authors": ["Our Foreign Staff", "Rebecca Ryan", "Marcus Fysh", "Michael Deacon", "Juliet Samuel"], "top_image": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/o5KtKItXwLA/mqdefault.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
