There was a gasp, a disbelieving eye-roll, and even an attempt to bar him from entering the French Fry Den\u2122. But eventually I arrived at acceptance and decided it was time to invest in something to improve the scent.\n\nBut rather than reach for an essential oil diffuser or my usual fall-scented candle (or my classic pumpkin-scented candle...or my luxury candle...or that one candle that smells super expensive but was actually super affordable\u2014listen, I really love candles), I decided to try an air freshener. I haven't always been into air fresheners, because I associate them with the artificial smell my 6th grade teacher would spray to cover the odor of our class snake. But a quick Google search revealed that there are actually a ton of air fresheners out there that 1) smell good, 2) look cool, and 3) don't put your home at risk of burning down.\n\nBasically, air fresheners have come a long way since my elementary school days. There are room sprays, car fresheners that make things smell nice and tell you a joke, scents created specifically for the bathroom, automatic dispensers that take care of the refreshing for you, and truly handy plug-ins. You can even buy a room spray that doubles as a makeup remover, people! So in case you too have a room that smells like day-old takeout, I've rounded up some of the best-smelling air fresheners available. Your significant other/roommate/dog will thank you.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/i9zi505Rf9KEeg3lXzJ0Ig--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MjE1MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/45829b9ed42fde515e5d656be24d20bd", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
