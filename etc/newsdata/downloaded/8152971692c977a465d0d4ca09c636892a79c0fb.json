The claim could not immediately be confirmed.\n\nAn Information Ministry statement said earlier that 58 people had been abducted by about 30 Arakan Army members from the boat carrying 165 civilian passengers and about 50 government personnel from Rakhine's capital, Sittwe, north to Buthidaung.\n\nA statement issued on Sunday night on the website of Myanmar's military commander-in-chief acknowledged helicopters had been sent to try and rescue the abductees.\n\nIt said the helicopters suffered some damage from gunfire and a crewman was lightly wounded, while at least 14 people who had been kidnapped were rescued.\n\nThe report did not specifically refer to an attack on boats or casualties among the abductees.\n\nThe Arakan Army says it is seeking self-determination. It represents the Buddhist Rakhine inhabitants of Rakhine state, and is one of more than a dozen ethnic minorities in Myanmar seeking autonomy.\n\nThe abduction on Saturday was the second carried out in recent weeks by the AA, which recruits from the mostly Buddhist local majority.\n\nEarlier this month, suspected rebels disguised as sports players boarded a bus in the state and took dozens of firefighters and civilians hostage.\n\nThe AA has been engaged in increasingly fierce fighting with government forces since late last year, eclipsing Rohingya armed groups, who have been largely inactive since late 2017.\n\nThe military in 2017 waged a brutal counterinsurgency campaign against the Muslim Rohingya minority in Rakhine, causing more than 700,000 people to flee to neighbouring Bangladesh.\n\nThe army and other security forces were accused of major abuses, including organised rape, murder and the burning of villages, that a UN-appointed investigation has called ethnic cleansing.\n\nThe UN and independent groups say human rights violations have increased as the government battles the Arakan Army, with the government side blamed for most, but not all, of the abuses.\n\nThe Arakan Army has been especially aggressive in its attacks and has active alliances with several other armed ethnic rebel groups, helping it keep the government off-balance by staging joint attacks in other areas of the country.\n\nIn August, it staged co-ordinated attacks with its allies at five locations, including a military academy outside normal combat areas, where a civilian was killed and a soldier wounded.\n\nThe alliance with the Ta'ang National Liberation Army, representing the Palaung minority, and the Kokang minority's Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army also claimed responsibility for attacks in Myanmar's central Mandalay region in Northern Shan state, where 14 people were reported killed.\n\nSince becoming independent from Britain in 1948, Myanmar has been wracked by fighting with minority groups in border areas seeking greater autonomy from the central government.", "description": "Arakan Army rebel group says three military helicopters attacked three boats carrying kidnapped troops and two sank.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/28/8edc0fdb2d6a46a2aecd3c79319a3981_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
