Sensing a marketing opportunity, \"Gods Unchained,\" a blockchain-based digital card game in the same vein as \"Hearthstone,\" stepped in with an offer to pay him.\n\nNow Immutable, the game studio behind Gods Unchained, says that it has been hit by cyberattacks since doing so. Tyler Perkins, Immutable\u2019s vice president of marketing, told Decrypt that, as a result, some players have reported being unable to log into the game. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to fight these off,\u201d he said, \u201cbut haven\u2019t analyzed them in enough detail yet to paint a picture on their origin.\u201d\n\nHong Kong is currently roiled by pro-democracy protests, as many residents have taken to the streets to fight a law that would allow those arrested in the semi-autonomous city to be extradited to mainland China.\n\nBitcoin trading spikes in Hong Kong as political crisis worsens\n\nChina, taking a hard line against the protests, is fighting on multiple fronts, including social media, where it's leaned on U.S. businesses to denounce pro-democracy sentiment. Recently, Daryl Morey, general manager of the NBA's Houston Rockets, walked back pro-Hong Kong comments on Twitter after Chinese organizations threatened to orchestrate a boycott of the team.\n\nThe NBA's response attempted to toe the line between supporting players and staff who express their views while not offending the massive Chinese fanbase for the NBA \u2013 one larger even than the American fanbase.\n\nIt didn't work. Tencent, Vivo and, and state broadcaster CCTV severed ties with the league this week, with CCTV declaring: \"We believe that any speech that challenges national sovereignty and social stability is not within the scope of freedom of speech.\"\n\nWhen dealing with the fallout from Chung's interview, Activision Blizzard, an American company hosting the Asia Pacific Hearthstone Grandmasters tournament, chose to bow to Chinese censorship lest it wind up in hot water like the NBA. On October 8, it announced that Chung had been removed from the competition, thereby forfeiting his tournament winnings, and banned from competition for 12 months. It even fired the people who interviewed him.\n\nThe company cited competition rules, which state: \"Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard's sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player's prize total to $0 USD.\"\n\nAt this point, Gods Unchained and Immutable, though not involved in the controversy, chose to take a stand in the opposite direction. While Immutable is riding high after raising $15 million in Series A funding in September, its flagship game is still in beta with no tournament dates yet set. In other words, it's in a much different place than Blizzard, which relies to some extent on China's estimated $36.9 billion video game market.\n\nImmutable saw an opportunity from Blizzard's move.\n\nIn an October 8 tweet, the Gods Unchained Twitter account posted that \"centralized games companies will censor and exploit their players if it is in their immediate financial interest\" before noting that its market and economy cannot be censored. \"Even if we disagree with your views,\" it said, \"we can't take away your cards.\" It invited players to join the game.", "description": "When a gamer was stripped of his winnings for supporting the Hong Kong demonstrations, Coinbase-backed Gods Unchained offered to pay him.
