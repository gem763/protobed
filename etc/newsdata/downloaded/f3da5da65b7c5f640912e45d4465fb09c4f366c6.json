But I will never fail to defend America\u2019s interests.\n\nTrump\u2019s address Tuesday comes while he is under mounting scrutiny over his purported attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his family \u2014 revelations that have ramped up calls for impeachment in Washington.\n\nAs he arrived at the U.N. Tuesday, Trump was engulfed with questions about why he withheld nearly $400 million in military aid for the small eastern European democracy at least a week before a July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump allegedly pressured Zelensky to launch a probe into Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nIn his address, Trump took a hard line against Iran, arguing that the governing regime was \u201csquandering the nation\u2019s health\u201d and vowed to \u201cstop Iran\u2019s path toward nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll nations have a duty to act. No responsible government should subsidize Iran\u2019s blood lust,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAs long as Iran\u2019s menacing behavior continues, sanctions will not be lifted. They will be tightened. Iran\u2019s leaders will have turned a proud nation into just another precautionary tale of what happens when a ruling class abandons its people and embarks on a crusade for personal power riches.\u201d\n\nSome lines echoed his remarks at campaign rallies \u2014 such as his focus on unemployment rates for minority Americans \u2014 except they were delivered in a much more subdued tone.\n\nTrump highlighted the United States\u2019 \u201cambitious campaign to reform international trade\u201d and stressed his desire to complete separate bilateral trade agreements with the United Kingdom and Japan.\n\n\u201cFor decades, the international trading system has been easily exploited by nations acting in bad faith,\u201d he said. \u201cAs jobs were outsourced, a small handful grew wealthy at the expense of the middle class.\u201d\n\nMost emblematic of America\u2019s fresh approach on trade, Trump said, was with China, with which the United States has been embroiled in an escalating trade war.\n\nChina, Trump said, has \u201cembraced an economic model dependent on massive market barriers, heavy state subsidies, currency manipulation, product dumping \u2026 and a theft of intellectual property.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not accept a bad deal for the American people,\u201d Trump said.\n\nHe also took aim at immigration advocates he said want open borders.\n\n\u201cYour policies are not just,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re policies are cruel and evil.\u201d\n\nTrump also warned that migrants heading to the United States to enter the country illegally should head back.\n\n\u201cIf you make it here you will not be allowed in, you will be promptly returned home,\u201d he said.", "description": "Trump\u2019s address Tuesday comes as he comes under mounting scrutiny over his purported attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his family \u2014 revelations that have ramped up calls for impeachment in Washington.", "authors": ["Anne Gearan", "White House Reporter", "Seung Min Kim"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/itNb1ks02wQDY6YRYteGiRayQE0=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UZ2BLSW62YI6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
