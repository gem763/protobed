When the media approached former IPID executive director Robert McBride on the issue, he indicated that the IPID report did not make these recommendations.\n\nALSO READ: State capture: McBride, former police minister butted heads over contradictory Zimbabwe rendition reports\n\n\"This is when the conflict between the minister and executive director McBride started,\" IPID national head of investigations, Matthews Sesoko, previously told the commission.\n\nAn \"inquiry\" process followed \u2013 conducted by Werksmans Attorneys \u2013 after the then-police minister required answers regarding the circumstances behind what became known as the first and second report.\n\nKhuba was summoned to this hearing on July 7, 2015.\n\nPrior to the hearing, acting IPID executive director Israel Kgamanyane requested that Khuba go to Duma Nokwe chambers in Sandton to meet with advocate William Mokhari SC.\n\nKhuba claimed the purpose of the request was to allegedly get him to make a confirmatory affidavit in support of Nhleko, in a departmental case against McBride.\n\n\"They were using me to turn against McBride [who was on suspension at the time] and that backfired.\n\nDisciplinary process postponed\n\n\"The letter they wanted me to sign said that I lied and that I altered the reports. I refused to sign because I would be lying,\" Khuba told the commission.\n\nDuring the period of this refusal, Khuba was also requested to attend three interviews with Werksmans Attorneys on the matter. His colleagues, McBride and Sesoko, were also subjected to interviews with the law firm.\n\nA report by the law firm later recommended that the three be suspended and charged for fraud and defeating the ends of justice, News24 reported.\n\nKhuba received his suspension letter in May 2015, however, due to a court challenge by McBride on the suspension and the fact that Sesoko was in hospital, the disciplinary process was postponed.\n\nThe IPID investigator's lawyer was then approached by Mokhari, suggesting Khuba's disciplinary process be separated from that of McBride and Sesoko.\n\n\"IPID's legal representative informed mine that I would be given a final written warning, but if I persisted in having a full hearing, I would be dismissed,\" Khuba said\n\nThe inquiry continues.", "description": "IPID investigator Innocent Khuba was informed that he would be dismissed if he continued to participate with the disciplinary process over the infamous Zimbabwe rendition saga, the judicial commission of inquiry into state capture has heard.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/4660/7fbfbdd940624e69ace056a24e7eaab0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
