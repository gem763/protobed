But this might be the first time conservative blogger Rubin has announced in ALL CAPS that she and other Never Trumpers will be voting for any Democrat in 2020. Even Bill de Blasio if it came down to that? Yes, even Bill de Blasio.\n\nThings begin here with Byron York sharing a piece about Never Trumpers plotting to back Joe Biden published in the Washington Examiner. David Drucker writes:\n\nBiden, 76, is the most likely Democrat to receive measurable support from the Never Trump crowd, most of whom quickly concluded that the president does not face a realistic threat from the three Republicans challenging him in the GOP primary in 2020. \u201cBiden is probably the only plausible candidate the Never Trumpers could support,\u201d said Jim Dornan, a Republican operative in Washington who maintains relationships with anti-Trump Republicans. Ana Navarro-C\u00e1rdenas, a Florida GOP operative who backed Jeb Bush in 2016 and has been close to Sen. Marco Rubio, attended a Biden campaign event last weekend, sitting on the front row stroking her dog Chacha. Biden turned to her and said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to sort of genuflect in this direction here because I\u2019m afraid of her. No. I\u2019m embarrassing her, I know \u2014 that\u2019s my intention. We\u2019ve been good friends for a long time.\u201d\n\nLove how I don\u2019t even get called for #nevertrump stories anymore. I\u2019m too Trump-friendly it appears. LOL. Also, though, I like Biden but I\u2019m not changing my party registration to vote for him. I\u2019m a Republican. https://t.co/HfbQTi8oBl \u2014 Liz Mair (@LizMair) September 19, 2019\n\nThis is idiotic. They have the \"conspiracy\" all wrong. We will vote for ANY D. \u2014 Jennifer Rubin (@JRubinBlogger) September 19, 2019\n\nThey have the conspiracy to back Biden all wrong because Never Trumpers will vote for any Democrat who gets the nomination \u2014 that\u2019s how you conserve conservatism.\n\nThere it is. The cold hard truth from the queen of the #NT crowd. https://t.co/tyFJGZAmKz \u2014 \u2b50\ufe0f \ud835\udd43\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd64\ud835\udd65 \ud835\udd3e\ud835\udd63\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd65 \ud835\udd3d\u211d\ud835\udd3c\ud835\udd3b\ud835\udd46 \ud835\udd60\ud835\udd57 \ud835\udd3c\ud835\udd52\ud835\udd63\ud835\udd65\ud835\udd59!

Sure, you\u2019ll vote for any D bc your feelings are hurt. But you\u2019d obviously prefer Biden to a radical reformer. \u2014 Alfred T. Cooper (@alfredtcooper) September 19, 2019\n\nYou\u2019re all about the D aren\u2019t you? \u2014 jim palmer (@spiv) September 19, 2019\n\nFortunately, Mair isn\u2019t Rubin.\n\nI won't. Though my vote is also irrelevant since CT will go blue by like 15 points probably. \u2014 Liz Mair (@LizMair) September 19, 2019\n\nRelated:", "description": "Maybe Eric Swalwell dropped out too early \u2026 Jennifer Rubin would have lined up to vote for him.", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jennifer-rubin-mtp.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
