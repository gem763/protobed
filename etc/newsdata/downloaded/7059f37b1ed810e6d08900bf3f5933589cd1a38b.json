Both are considering significantly reducing their investment from the amounts they committed to the first fund, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe Saudi investment vehicle committed $45 billion to the original Vision Fund, making it the fund's biggest backer. It now plans to invest only its profits from the first Vision Fund into the second one, Bloomberg reported.\n\nMubadala was the second largest outside backer of the Vision Fund, committing $15 billion to it. The Abu Dhabi company is considering limiting its investment in the new fund to less than $10 billion, according to Bloomberg.\n\nA Mubadala representative told Bloomberg the company is still discussing its potential stake in the new fund and denied that it had yet made a decision on the when or how much to commit. A representative for the Public Investment Fund declined comment to Bloomberg.\n\nSoftBank representatives did not immediately respond to an email from Business Insider seeking comment.\n\nRead this:Venture investors still aren't sure what to make of SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund. Depending on who you ask, they're either rooting for it, or gleeful that it's struggling with WeWork and Uber.\n\nUber and WeWork have given the first Vision Fund a black eye\n\nThe investors' apparent trepidation over the new Vision Fund comes amid some high-profile setbacks for the original. SoftBank's giant fund has reportedly lost some $600 million on its investment in Uber, thanks to that company's disappointing public offering and the subsequent decline in Uber's stock price.\n\nMeanwhile, WeWork, in which SoftBank has invested $10.65 billion, is struggling to attract investors for its own public offering. Last week, the company was reportedly considering going public with a market capitalization of as little as $10 billion\u2014 less that a quarter of the $47 billion valuation SoftBank conferred on it with a January investment.\n\nEarlier this month, many venture capital experts told Business Insider they had faith SoftBank would still be able to find investors for its second Vision Fund, despite its troubles with Uber and WeWork.\n\nSoftBank has already received commitments from Apple and Microsoft, among other investors, for the new fund.\n\nGot a tip about SoftBank or WeWork?
