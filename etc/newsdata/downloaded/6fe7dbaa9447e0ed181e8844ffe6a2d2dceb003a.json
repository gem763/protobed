Trevor Harrison (right), 33, of Fenham, is set to be sentenced at a later date\n\nClothing and weapons believed to be used in the attack were seized and tested for DNA that ultimately helped identify some of those men involved in the attack.\n\nOver the following weeks, Ferry, Bailey, Mole, Johnson, Carlson and a sixth man called Trevor Harrison were all arrested by police.\n\nThey were all later charged with wounding with intent, assault and violent disorder.\n\nThe men denied the charges and the case went to trial but it was adjourned after an issue arose with the jury.\n\nOn July 9, the Crown Prosecution Service accepted guilty pleas from all the defendants on violent disorder at Newcastle Crown Court.\n\nThe men are pictured entering the Fosse pub in Walker, Newcastle, captured on CCTV footage\n\nThe six men were all later charged with wounding with intent, assault and violent disorder\n\nThe other charges were dropped as there was not enough evidence to prove if any of the six men had carried out the physical assault.\n\nYesterday, five of the men were jailed for a total of 17 years and three months at the same court.\n\nFerry, of Wallsend, and Bailey, of North Shields, were both jailed for three years and nine months.\n\nMole, of Walker, and Johnson, of North Shields were both jailed for three years and six months. Carlson, of North Shields, was jailed for two years and nine months.\n\nHarrison, 33, of Fenham, is set to be sentenced at a later date. His term could mean that the total sentence exceeds 20 years in prison.\n\nThe men are captured on CCTV footage making their way through the pub during the incident\n\nClothing and weapons believed to be used in the attack were later seized and tested for DNA\n\nFollowing the case, Detective Sergeant Nick McKenna, of Northumbria Police, said it highlighted that police can secure convictions against violent thugs even when victims do not support a prosecution.\n\nMr McKenna said: 'This was a brutal attack outside a popular Newcastle pub and we are lucky not to be standing here talking about a murder case.\n\n'The victim in this case was left with a fractured skull and could have easily died if it wasn't for the quick intervention of medical staff.\n\n'It has taken a long time for this investigation to come to court and a lot of excellent police work has gone in to securing these convictions.\n\nThe men are pictured in CCTV footage entering the pub in the Walker area of Newcastle\n\nThe masked men can be seen to the right of a CCTV still next to two men at a table in the pub\n\nThe Fosse pub in the Walker area of Newcastle is pictured having been partially boarded up\n\n'We were able to secure clothing, weapons and discarded items that were directly linked to the assault and were central to the case.\n\n'Ultimately it was the forensic evidence that has proved the downfall of this gang and we have secured convictions even when the victim does not support a prosecution.\n\n'There is no place for this level of violence on the streets of Newcastle and anyone who takes the law into their own hands should expect to be arrested and put before the courts.\n\n'I want to praise all the officers who have worked tirelessly to bring this case to court over the past two years and held this violent gang to account.'", "description": "Michael Ferry, 28, Dean Bailey, 31, Colin Mole, 34, Michael Johnson 35, and Ross Carlson, 21, were all sentenced over the attack at the Fosse pub in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.", "authors": ["Mark Duell For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/15/19444878-0-image-a-298_1570543425776.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
