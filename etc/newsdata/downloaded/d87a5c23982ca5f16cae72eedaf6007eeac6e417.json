He has frequently referred to himself as a \u201cvery stable genius\u201d \u2013 and not tongue-in-cheek. He actually did so recently, in reference to his controversial phone call to the Ukraine president, Volodmyr Zelenskiy, which sparked an impeachment inquiry into him.\n\nDonald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) As I have stated strongly before, and just to reiterate, if Turkey does anything that I, in my great and unmatched wisdom, consider to be off limits, I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I\u2019ve done before!). They must, with Europe and others, watch over...\n\nIn the past, Trump has referred to himself as \u201cthe chosen one\u201d (over his decision to start a trade war with China) and \u201cso great looking and smart\u201d (apropos of \u2026 nothing).\n\nOn Monday afternoon, following the great-and-unmatched-wisdom-gate, Twitter users were moved to draw comparisons between Trump and other authoritarian leaders who have bigged themselves up. We\u2019ve picked out the best ones.\n\n1. Muammar Gaddafi\n\nNBC correspondent Richard Engel made the observation that Trump sounds a lot like the late Libyan leader:\n\nRichard Engel (@RichardEngel) \u201cI, in my great and unmatched wisdom,... ?\u201d Who talks or writes like this? The closest i can come up with was Qaddafi.\n\nNot Mubarak. Or Ben Ali. Or Assad, let alone any European leader. Really can\u2019t remember a current or recent example. https://t.co/EkOKJuw2F3\n\nIn March 2009, Gaddafi stormed out of a crowded summit in Qatar. He was quoted in the Scotsman as saying: \u201cI am an international leader, the dean of the Arab rulers, the king of kings of Africa and the imam of Muslims. My international status does not allow me to descend to a lower level.\u201d\n\n2. The Wizard of Oz\n\nKeen observers quickly cottoned on that there was something familiar about Trump\u2019s phrase \u201cin my great and unmatched wisdom\u201d \u2013 and then they realised it sounded strikingly similar to the \u201cgreat and powerful\u201d Wizard of Oz.\n\nOne Twitter user thought the president might do well to remember how the story ended for the man behind the curtain.\n\nLori Wade (@loridwade) Talking like the Wizard of Oz is a bad look for international diplomacy. You know how that story ends. Right? #ImpeachmentIsComing pic.twitter.com/aK5zWskk8v\n\nAnother person, Andy Zahn, pointed out they look similar, too.\n\nAndy Zahn (@NakMakFeegle) \"I, in my great and unmatched wisdom\"\n\n\n\nIt is apt indeed to compare Trump to the Wizard of Oz - both are old men who lied and cheated their way into positions of power.\n\n\n\nThey even look alike!#BadWizard #WizardofOZ #StableGenius #greatandunmatchedwisdom pic.twitter.com/GbqpUzfkmo\n\n3. Ozymandias\n\nPercy Bysshe Shelley\u2019s classic poem, published in 1818, contains the line: \u201cMy name is Ozymandias, king of kings!\u201d\n\nBrian Stack (@BrianStack153) After reading Trump\u2019s Tweet about his own \u201cgreat and unmatched wisdom\u201d, I was reminded yet again of Percy Bysshe Shelley\u2019s \u201cOzymandias\u201d for no particular reason. pic.twitter.com/G59K0arIZu\n\nAre we missing anyone?", "description": "Trump \u2013 the \u2018very stable genius\u2019 \u2013 is no stranger to narcissistic statements, and he was at it again on Monday afternoon", "authors": ["Poppy Noor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55c17a7b4bb48cd7f090dca9431e94052046f36a/637_0_3046_1829/master/3046.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=33596961cd1291e89498f7bd8adfce33", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
