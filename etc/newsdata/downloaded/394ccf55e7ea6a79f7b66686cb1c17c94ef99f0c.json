In the history of our Nation, the House of Representatives has never attempted to launch an impeachment inquiry against the President without a majority of the House taking political accountability for that decision by voting to authorize such a dramatic constitutional step.\u201d\n\n\"President Trump and his administration reject your baseless, unconstitutional efforts to overturn the democratic process,\" Cipollone added. \"Your unprecedented actions have left the president with no choice. In order to fulfill his duties to the American people, the Constitution, the Executive Branch, and all future occupants of the Office of the Presidency, President Trump and his administration cannot participate in your partisan and unconstitutional inquiry under these circumstances.\"\n\nWHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCES IT WILL NOT COMPLY WITH 'ILLEGITIMATE AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL' IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\n\nIn order to keep up the facade of outrage and paint Cipollone\u2019s defiant letter as grounds for impeachment in its own right, Democrats have ignored the substance of the letter itself and resort to threatening administration officials who comply with the historical and legally irrefutable principle of executive privilege.\n\nAmong other things, Cipollone\u2019s letter takes Democrats to task for calling their stunt an \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d without passing any kind of impeachment resolution.\n\nCipollone wrote: \u201cHere, House leadership claims to have initiated the gravest inter-branch conflict contemplated under our Constitution by means of nothing more than a press conference at which the Speaker of the House simply announced an \u2018official impeachment inquiry.\u2019 Your contrived process is unprecedented in the history of the Nation and lacks the necessary authorization for a valid impeachment proceeding.\u201d\n\nThe refusal of Democrats to follow historical precedent regarding impeachment is not simply a matter of semantics or procedural niceties. Rather, it is a transparent attempt to run an open, one-sided, partisan pillory without granting President Trump the due process rights to which he is clearly constitutionally entitled.\n\nThe impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton established that the ground rules required by the Constitution are guaranteed. These right include allow the president\u2019s lawyer to be present at all proceedings and \u201cquestion any witness called before the Committee.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s telling that House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and other Democrats who vociferously advocated for the rights of the accused in President Clinton\u2019s impeachment proceedings have now hypocritically flipped the script and claim that President Trump has no such rights.\n\nDemocrats have used the cover of their press conference-declared \u201cofficial impeachment inquiry\u201d to deny Republican ranking members on each of the investigating committees their own subpoena powers, which are traditionally guaranteed for the minority party.\n\nEven among those who accept Schiff\u2019s collapsing Ukraine narrative and believe President Trump must be impeached, there\u2019s a growing admission that something is very off about the Bidens\u2019 dealings involving Ukraine.\n\nThe Democrats are in effect pretending their refusal to set ground rules creates an \u201cinquiry\u201d where they have unlimited powers of subpoena, with none of the secrecy requirements that justify those powers in a grand jury investigation \u2013 the analogy liberal commentators keep drawing. At the same time, the Democrats want no one to be allowed to investigate their own conduct.\n\nCongressional Democrats\u2019 obstinate refusal to accept these basic due process concerns, and their insistence on making Cipollone\u2019s letter into a \u201cconstitutional crisis,\u201d highlights Democrats\u2019 underlying uneasiness with the facts of the case and their unwillingness to invite scrutiny of their own behavior.\n\nThere seems to be as much to blowback in Democrats\u2019 faces as they have to throw at Trump.\n\nWe have seen increasingly shady looking interactions between House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and the CIA leaker \u2013 that so-called \u201cwhistleblower,\u201d who has reported links to an unnamed Democratic presidential campaign.\n\nWe have also seen a renewed focus on former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter and his business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nEven among those who accept Schiff\u2019s collapsing Ukraine narrative and believe President Trump must be impeached, there\u2019s a growing admission that something is very off about the Bidens\u2019 dealings involving Ukraine. There is, as the old saying goes, \u201ca there there.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats want to strip Republicans and the president of the procedural safeguards and rights needed to air out all the facts \u2013 not just those convenient for the Democrats\u2019 narrative.\n\nPeter Schweizer, a defender of the president, wrote a recent New York Times op-ed headlined \u201cWhat Hunter Biden Did Was Legal \u2013 And That\u2019s the Problem.\u201d Schweizer explains that \u201cHunter [Biden], a businessman, landed deals he was apparently unqualified to score save for one thing: his father\u201d and that Joe Biden has been transparently dishonest about his discussions with his son about those dealings.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nMeanwhile, The Intercept\u2019s Ryan Grim, who supports impeachment, documents decades of \u201csoft corruption\u201d on the part of the Biden clan in a new report. Grim writes: \u201cDemocratic voters \u2026 can see the corruption in front of their eyes, and they have to decide whether that\u2019s the argument they want to have with Trump in 2020 \u2013 or whether they want to nominate someone else who will allow the party to make the corruption argument cleanly.\u201d\n\nFor all the talk about the political costs the president is supposedly accruing from his dealings with Ukraine, the only unequivocal loser thus far is Joe Biden. Until Pelosi and Schiff began their impeachment push, Biden was the clear frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination. He\u2019s now lost that position to Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts \u2013 and continues to decline.\n\nBiden himself seems to have taken notice of this untoward development. Until Warren overtook him, Biden was by far the most reluctant of the leading Democratic presidential candidates to endorse impeachment. He clearly reasoned it was better to downplay an issue that implicated him and his family.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOnly after losing his spot as the Democratic frontrunner to the impeachment-happy Warren \u2013 and suffering a downturn in support as Hunter Biden\u2019s activities dominated the headlines \u2013 did Joe Biden himself get on the impeachment bandwagon. It may prove to be an ill-fated choice.\n\nAs President Trump correctly observed, if Democrats continue to refuse the White House\u2019s and House Republicans\u2019 reasonable demands for basic due process, the legitimacy of their pseudo \u201cimpeachment inquiry\u201d will be tried in the court of public opinion. This could have potentially disastrous results for Democrats and for public trust in the integrity of Congress and our presidential elections, which Democrats clearly seek to reverse by illegitimate means such as sham impeachment proceedings.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY HARMEET DHILLON", "description": "The near-hysterical reaction of Democrats to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone\u2019s letter on the due process deficiencies in their highly irregular impeachment proceedings against President Trump is more revealing than they admit.", "authors": ["Harmeet Dhillon", "Harmeet K.
