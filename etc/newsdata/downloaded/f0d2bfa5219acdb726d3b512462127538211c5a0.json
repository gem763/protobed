He does not sit on any one of the six committees that are investigating the president. Nor was he among the group of freshman Democrats with national security backgrounds who had dramatically announced their support for impeachment in an op-ed the night before.\n\nInstead, Van Drew\u2019s claim to fame is that he\u2019s the guy standing athwart the impeachment train, yelling stop\u2014even though the train has left the station.\n\n\u201cLet me emphasize again, impeachment is an extremely serious issue,\u201d Van Drew explained to a different group of reporters last Friday, his cadence firm, friendly, and doused in a thick Jersey accent. \u201cIt is not something to be taken lightly. You're disenfranchising voters, you're removing an executive from office. That usually only happens in third-world countries.\u201d\n\nHis opposition to impeachment has earned him recognition from more than the Capitol press corps. On Sunday, Van Drew appeared on Fox and Friends to air his opposition to impeachment. \u201cThank you,\u201d tweeted Trump in a thread approvingly quoting the congressman\u2019s remarks. \u201cJust another witch hunt by Nancy Pelosi and the Do Nothing Democrats!\u201d\n\nTo this point, Van Drew\u2019s most indelible impact on the U.S. Capitol may be sartorial: his impressive collection of patterned suits and bright pocket squares stands out among his more staid colleagues.\n\nBeyond that, however, he suffers from the anonymity that most freshmen members confront when they find themselves one of 435 members of a chamber. \u201cHe\u2019s a member from New Jersey, right?\u201d asked one senior House aide, when offered the opportunity to assess what role Van Drew has played in the impeachment proceedings.\n\nNow, the first-year lawmaker\u2014a former state senator and longtime dentist\u2014has found his role. While his moderate, purple-district colleagues have largely ducked the press on impeachment in a tortured political balancing act, Van Drew has done the opposite.\n\nImprobably, this district-flipping Blue Dog with some of the unsexiest committee assignments in Congress has emerged as the only Democrat willing to talk\u2014and talk, and talk\u2014about why impeachment would be a disaster for Democrats and for the country more broadly.\n\n\u201cIt's the price of leadership,\u201d he told The Daily Beast after a lengthy discussion with reporters. \u201cI think I have a responsibility, when I can\u2014it's hard time-wise sometimes\u2014to have a conversation with you and to be fair and candid.\u201d\n\nVan Drew has, in fact, long been a source of cold water for his party\u2019s impeachment push. After the release of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report, he all but declared that Democrats needed to give up on impeachment unless explosive new evidence about Trump\u2019s conduct emerged. When that explosive evidence did emerge\u2014in the form of an anonymous whistleblower\u2019s credible allegation that Trump asked Ukraine to dig up dirt on his rival former vice president Joe Biden\u2014Van Drew didn\u2019t budge.\n\n\u201cUnless we have something that without a doubt is an impeachable offense, which we know is treason, high crimes and misdemeanors, we don't have any positive proof of that,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cWe have some unseemly, you know, statements, some things that we don't really like or enjoy.\u201d\n\nAs the Ukraine revelations push moderate-minded freshman Democrats toward impeachment in droves, Van Drew sticks out even more, the political equivalent of a turquoise pocket square in a sea of black and blue suits.\n\nAsked to respond to Trump\u2019s approving tweets about him, Van Drew said via a spokesperson on Monday that his position \u201cwas not requested by or made for President Trump.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy position on impeachment has always been consistent,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would split the country, hurt both Democrat and Republican constituents at the end of the day, and reduce or negate any work accomplished by this Congress.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Van Drew\u2019s position\u2014consistent, if nothing else\u2014earned him little more than the occasional eyebrow-raise from his fellow Democrats, among whom he keeps somewhat of a low profile. \u201cHe\u2019s a dentist,\u201d said one House Democrat when asked about Van Drew. \u201cSome of my family are dentists. We talk about that.\u201d (Indeed, Van Drew recently retired from a successful dentistry practice he operated for 30 years just outside Atlantic City, the largest city in his district. On his lapel, beside his gold member of Congress pin, Van Drew dutifully wears a stars-and-stripes pin in the shape of a tooth.)", "description": "Alex Wong/GettyIn a U.S. Capitol hallway on the day that Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced a formal impeachment inquiry into President Trump, a dozen reporters crowded around a freshman Democratic congressman from New Jersey, sticking their recorders in his face as he held court.Jefferson Van Drew, the", "authors": ["Sam Brodey"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/1gXiTQRi2qI1SWA3x25bzg--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/f7e07e903a825a71f4a8caea673a358d", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
