Satellite images picked up evidence that a launchpad in Iran's space center had been charred by an explosion. Analysts speculated that the incident was linked to the Nahid-1, the Associated Press reported.\n\nOn Friday, Trump tweeted an image from a confidential report on the incident, claiming that the US was not involved in the explosion.\n\n\"I wish Iran best wishes and good luck in determining what happened at Site One,\" the president wrote.\n\nRead more: Trump may have revealed US military secrets by tweeting a photo to taunt Iran\n\nJahromi's selfie appeared to be a response to speculation about the Nahid-1, suggesting that it was still intact. But this isn't the first time that the official has taken to Twitter to taunt Trump. He previously wrote that the president should replace \"boring\" US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo with comedian Jimmy Fallon, tweeting out an SNL clip about racists supporting Trump.\n\nOn August 22, Jahromi tweeted, \"We are all connected, not isolated islands. Trump's sanctions will hurt the US first.\" He's criticized the president for his withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action with Iran and the European Union. He's even mocked Trump as a \"coward\" and poked fun at the controversy over the size of his inauguration crowd.\n\nWhile attention remains focused on Trump's handling of the alleged Iranian rocket explosion, it remains to be seen whether Jahromi will finally get a response from the president.", "description": "This isn't the first time that Azari Jahromi has taunted US President Donald Trump on Twitter.
