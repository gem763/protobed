REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n\nFRANKFURT (Reuters) - A climate change protester was bundled away by security staff on Thursday after he tried to rush across a stage where German Chancellor Angela Merkel was inspecting a new electric vehicle at Frankfurt\u2019s IAA car show.\n\nThe exhibition, a staple of the global automotive calendar, has been the target of protests by environmentalist groups like Greenpeace and Sand in the Works because of the contribution Germany\u2019s vast car industry makes to climate change.\n\nThe industry, still shaken by revelations that carmaker Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) cheated on emissions tests to make its diesel engines look cleaner than they are, has used this year\u2019s fair to showcase dozens of new electric vehicles, a field in which Chinese and U.S. carmakers are seen as having an advantage.\n\nA man in a T-shirt bearing Greenpeace\u2019s logo and the slogan \u201cClimate Killer\u201d was tackled to the floor by security guards as he attempted to cross the stage where Merkel stood listening to BMW chief Oliver Zipse present a new car.\n\nActivists were present at other launches, standing on parked cars within the exhibition centre holding Climate Killer posters within the sight of Merkel and of car bosses.\n\n\u201cShe must clearly tell the auto bosses \u2018fuel and diesel is over\u2019,\u201d said activist Gerald Neubauer.\n\nOpening the show earlier in the day, Merkel said Germany faced a \u201cHerculean task\u201d greening its crucial transport sector.\n\n\u201cThe automobile industry is a very important part of our country\u2019s economic success and it is above all an industry which supplies jobs and therefore security for hundreds of thousands of people,\u201d she said.", "description": "A climate change protester was bundled away by security staff on Thursday after he tried to rush across a stage where German Chancellor Angela Merkel was inspecting a new electric vehicle at Frankfurt's IAA car show.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429097475&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B1CO"}
