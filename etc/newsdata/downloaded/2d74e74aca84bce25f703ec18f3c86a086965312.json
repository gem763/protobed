[TVN, SBS]\n\nYouTube is no longer a platform restricted to the average Joe or Jane in search of ways to become stars. Big-name producers have launched new shows on the giant video-sharing website, and their attempts are getting a lot of attention from the industry: Could they become the next big thing in a saturated entertainment market? And will that spell an end to the traditional media of broadcasting?Na Young-seok and Kim Tae-ho are two pivotal producers in Korea\u2019s broadcasting circles. The two recently began producing content for YouTube.Na has created numerous hits such as \u201cGrandpa Over Flowers,\u201d \u201cThree Meals a Day,\u201d \u201cYoun\u2019s Kitchen\u201d and \u201cNew Journey to the West.\u201dOf all the shows, the format of \u201cGranpa Over Flowers,\u201d in which actors in their 70s go on backpacking trips to a foreign country, was exported to Hong Kong, Taiwan and the United States. NBC remade the show in 2016 with the title \u201cBetter Late than Never.\u201dNa\u2019s YouTube project began with his popular show \u201cNew Journey to the West,\u201d in which a cast goes on a trip for days and grapples with silly games.In the sixth season of \u201cNew Journey to the West,\u201d two of its cast members - Lee Su-geun and Eun Ji-won - won a trip to Iceland. They initially refused the prize citing their busy schedules, but eventually went. Kang Ho-dong, another cast member of the show, recommended the production team broadcast the trip to Iceland by editing it as a short clip and adding it at the end of \u201cThree Meals a Day: Mountain Village\u201d on tvN.The spin-off show is titled \u201cThree Meals a Day: Three Meals in Iceland.\u201dThe five-minute show that appears at the end of \u201cThree Meals a Day: Mountain Village\u201d was merely a teaser. The real show, with episodes about 20 minutes long, was instantly available on Channel Nanana on YouTube, a strategy that makes the best use of two platforms - TV and YouTube - at once.Na previously unveiled the very first season of \u201cNew Journey to the West,\u201d now in its seventh season, through Naver TV Cast prior to the scheduled airing date in 2015.Naver TV Cast, now renamed Naver TV, is an online website run by the country\u2019s largest search engine, Naver, and it distributes web dramas and TV show clips.For \u201cThree Meals a Day: Three Meals in Iceland,\u201d Na tried to make it special for YouTube, adopting formulas seen in other content on channels.For example, Lee and Eun gorge on in-flight meals on their way from Incheon to Iceland, which may remind viewers of mukbang or videos that show people eating. They also do unboxing, another kind of popular video online in which people film themselves opening various products.When the first episode of \u201cThree Meals a Day: Three Meals in Iceland\u201d hit the air on tvN, Na did a livestream show on his YouTube channel and said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe 9,600 people are staying tuned [to the YouTube channel] without watching the TV.\u201dWith the high number of subscribers to the YouTube channel, Na joked that he was concerned about the future of TV. He promised that he would send Lee and Eun to the moon if his YouTube channel reached one million subscribers within 10 weeks.After only four episodes, the Nanana channel now has about 800,000 subscribers.\u201cInside the company, we discuss a lot about digital content, and a majority of people were in favor of the approach [by Na],\u201d said a person working at CJ ENM, which runs the cable channel tvN.\u201cThe production team is likely to accept the challenge of a new format when another chance is given to them,\u201d he added.Producer Kim Tae-ho is also trying to combine YouTube with his TV show \u201cHangout with Yoo\u201d on MBC.Kim is the creator of \u201cInfinite Challenge\u201d (2006-2018), one of the longest-running TV shows in history.Prior to the launch of \u201cHangout with Yoo\u201d in July, Kim created a YouTube channel with the same title as the TV show and has been uploading some behind-the-scene clips such as the footage of the recording studio in which Yoo Jae-suk, the host of the TV show, improvises with professional musicians as part of a specific episode.\u201cHangout with Yoo\u201d has a format that\u2019s like a relay race. Yoo records his own life with a handheld camera and then passes the camera onto another celebrity. He films his life and passes it along too.When the production team unveiled the TV show to the press in July, Kim said, \u201cThis new concept goes well along with the direction MBC wants to go, and the broadcaster can grow into a quality content maker for mobile and the Internet.\u201dBut Kim\u2019s YouTube channel failed to differentiate itself from the TV platform: It seemed like a TV show on a different kind of screen.The YouTube channel for \u201cHangout with Yoo\u201d has about 320,000 subscribers, and the number has been somewhat stagnant.Another TV show produced by Kim, \u201cFunding Together,\u201d is more successful than \u201cHangout with Yoo\u201d and is blurring the line between a TV show and an online platform.\u201cFunding Together\u201d is a TV show themed on crowdfunding. Celebrities come up with ideas that seem improbable and then they turn their ideas into action through crowdfunding. The show collaborates with Naver Happybean, an online donation platform run by Naver.Actor Yu Jun-sang appeared in the first episode and did a presentation about his idea of making a special kind of case for Taegeukgi, the national flag. The case can even become a flag holder so that people can hoist the national flag indoors.The Taegeukgi project of Yu did three rounds of crowdfunding, and each round exceeded its goal. In addition, the special Taegeukgi sold 10,000 pieces through a TV home shopping channel.\u201cFunding Together\u201d is a good example of a good match between a TV show and an online platform bringing explosive feedback from viewers.Paik Jong-won, a food expert, entrepreneur and popular TV celebrity, launched his YouTube channel Paik\u2019s Cuisine in June.The cooking guru has been sharing his easy-to-follow recipes on numerous TV shows. One day, he discovered that many of his recipes available online are not correct. So he launched the YouTube channel.The channel has 2.8 million subscribers, and the most popular video clip on the channel has gotten 92 million views.Paik, who appeared on the first season of the TV show \u201cMy Little TV\u201d on MBC, knows how to communicate with viewers.In the TV show, Paik did a series of cooking live chat sessions with viewers. Sometimes minor requests from viewers become good material for the YouTube channel.If mackerel kebabs go viral after they are featured on \u201cStreet Food Fighter 2\u201d on tvN, which has Paik as a host, Paik\u2019s Cuisine uploads a video clip of him visiting Turkey that was not included on the TV show along with a clip on how to make the mackerel kebabs.The channel is run by The Born Korea, a company run by Paik.These crossover challenges by some of the industry\u2019s bigwigs are embraced by industry insiders.\u201cSome view such attempts by star producers as eating up the existing market, but it is proof that YouTube and other [online] platforms are growing well,\u201d said a person working at a production company.\u201cThere was a time when many producers moved from terrestrial networks to cable channels and brought the renaissance period to cable channels. [The move of producers into YouTube] will help to expand the [YouTube] pie in the long run,\u201d he added.Jeong Deok-hyun, the culture critic, said, \u201cOnly the most creative content makers survive under the ecosystem of YouTube, but the shift of TV celebrities and production teams [from the small screen to YouTube] seems like they are at a transitional period. They are still doing the same thing but are changing their backdrops.\u201cPaik knows how to approach each different platform based on years of experience, and it is his greatest strength. As a way to differentiate [their content on YouTube], more new figures are needed other than singers, actors and TV celebrities,\u201d Jeong added.BY MIN KYUNG-WON [estyle@joongang.co.kr]V\ub294 \ub9db\ubcf4\uae30 \uc608\uace0\ud3b8? \uc720\ud29c\ube0c\ub85c \uac00\ub294 \uc608\ub2a5 \uace0\uc218\ub4e4\uc2a4\ud0c0 \uc5f0\ucd9c\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc787\ub2ec\uc544 \uc720\ud29c\ube0c\uc5d0 \ucd9c\uc0ac\ud45c\ub97c \ub358\uc84c\ub2e4. \uc608\ub2a5\uacc4 \uc591\ub300 \uc0b0\ub9e5\uc778 \ub098\uc601\uc11d\u00b7\uae40\ud0dc\ud638 PD\uac00 \ub098\ub780\ud788 \uc720\ud29c\ube0c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc120\ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4. \uc608\ub2a5\uacc4\uc758 \ube14\ub8e8\uce69\uc73c\ub85c \ub5a0\uc624\ub978 \ubc31\uc885\uc6d0\uc758 \uc720\ud29c\ube0c \ucc44\ub110\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc0bc\ud30c\uc804 \uc591\uc0c1\uc744 \ub760\uac8c \ub41c \uac83. \uc720\ud29c\ube0c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc870\uae08\uc529 \ub2e4\ub974\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud2b8\ub80c\ub4dc\ub97c \uc120\ub3c4\ud574\uc628 \uc774\ub4e4\uc774 \uc608\ub2a5\uacc4\uc758 \ud310\ub3c4\ub97c \ub2e4\uc2dc \ud55c\ubc88 \ubc14\uafc0 \uc218 \uc788\uc744\uc9c0 \uad00\uc2ec\uc774 \uc3e0\ub9ac\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.\uac00\uc7a5 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ub098\uc601\uc11d \uc0ac\ub2e8\uc758 \ud589\ubcf4\ub2e4. \uc2e0\ud6a8\uc815 PD\ub294 \u2018\ub9d0\uc774 \uc528\uac00 \ub41c\ub2e4\u2019\ub294 \uc608\ub2a5\uc758 \ubc95\uce59\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c 5\ubd84\uc9dc\ub9ac \uc608\ub2a5 \ud504\ub85c \u2018\uc2e0\uc11c\uc720\uae30 \uc678\uc804: \uc0bc\uc2dc\uc138\ub07c-\uc544\uc774\uc2ac\ub780\ub4dc \uac04 \uc138\ub07c\u2019\ub97c \ud0c4\uc0dd\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4. \uc9c0\ub09c\ud574 \u2018\uc2e0\uc11c\uc720\uae306\u2019\uc5d0\uc11c \uc544\uc774\uc2ac\ub780\ub4dc \uc624\ub85c\ub77c \ubcf4\uae30 \uc0c1\ud488\uad8c\uc744 \ud68d\ub4dd\ud55c \uc774\uc218\uadfc\uacfc \uc740\uc9c0\uc6d0\uc774 \ubc14\uc05c \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\uc744 \uc774\uc720\ub85c \uc0c1\ud488 \uc218\ub839\uc744 \uac70\ubd80\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774 \u201c\u2018\uc0bc\uc2dc\uc138\ub07c\u2019 \ub4a4\uc5d0 \ub9e4\uc8fc 5\ubd84\uc529 \ubd99\uc5ec\uc11c \ub0b4\ubcf4\ub0b4\uc790\u201d\ub294 \uac15\ud638\ub3d9\uc758 \ub9d0\uc744 \ub193\uce58\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ud3b8\uc131\uc5d0 \uc131\uacf5\ud55c \uac83. \uae30\ubb18\ud55c \uc81c\ubaa9\uc758 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc774 \uc0dd\uaca8\ub09c \uc774\uc720\ub2e4.TV\uc5d0\uc11c 5\ubd84\uac04 \ubc29\uc601\ub418\ub294 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc740 \uc608\uace0\ud3b8\uc5d0 \ubd88\uacfc\ud558\ub2e4. \ubc29\uc1a1\uc774 \ub05d\ub098\uace0 1\ubd84 \ub4a4 \uc720\ud29c\ube0c \u2018\ucc44\ub110 \ub098\ub098\ub098\u2019\uc5d0 \uc62c\ub77c\uc624\ub294 20\ubd84 \ub0a8\uc9d3\uc758 \uc601\uc0c1\uc774 \ubcf8\ud3b8\uc774\ub2e4.
