I don't know how old it is and can't remember at which point it became my hand-me-down, but I do know I'll be replacing it to better match my partner's much more modern suitcase \u2014 which looks better than mine because she has a better eye (among other things) than I do. Prepare for your travel \u2014 whatever your style \u2014 with the right suitcase for the trip.\n\nFOR THE HEAVY-DUTY TRAVELER\n\nBriggs & Riley Sympatico Expandable Hardside Luggage, $579 on Amazon: Suitcases with hard exteriors are able to absorb the impact they experience from being tossed or thrown or dropped \u2014 you know, the way airport personnel seem to treat them. Protect your valuables with Briggs & Riley's Sympatico Carry-On. One of its compartments is designed for your clothes, the other for everything else: toiletries, (running) shoes, and other hard objects.\n\nFOR THE FLEXIBLE TRAVELER\n\nThe North Face Rolling Thunder Wheeled Duffel, $269 at The North Face: Not all suitcases face rough airport handling, of course \u2014 and airports are just one travel platform out of many. A softshell means an expandable body, both to fit more inside it or to minimize its footprint in your closet. Squeeze in that last gift-for-your-in-laws with The North Face\u2019s Rolling Thunder. What I like most about it are the bumpers underneath its front, protecting its nylon body. This pliable-yet-rugged suitcase comes in nine colors, including heather gray and tumbleweed.\n\nFOR THE MINIMALIST TRAVELER\n\nThe Carry-On, $225 at Away: Style varies across the suitcase ecosystem, and as is true for other goods, a leading approach is minimalism \u2014 an answer to our hectic and overwhelming, digitally-governed lives. Away\u2019s suitcases are all designed with minimalism in mind, and even has a special and very attractive aluminum collection (I can\u2019t stop staring at it). But since the style is popular, you\u2019ve got options. The Geometric collection from Amazon is just as simple and refined, and includes built-in TSA locks.\n\nFOR THE TECHIE TRAVELER\n\nG-RO Carry-on Luggage, $445 on Amazon: A tech-dominated approach to travel, whether for short or long distances, is flying fast toward us. From apps to chargers, more of us expect our travel accessories to embrace and enable our connected lives. The G-RO carry-on includes two USB ports for charging and a Bluetooth-enabled tracker so you know how much longer you need to wait for it to arrive down the belt \u2014 also, its wheels are very unique. Or take a look at the compact Kayla Underseat Carry-On with a USB charger and accompanying compression straps to get it nice and small for when you haven\u2019t filled it up entirely.\n\nFOR THE NEEDY TRAVELER\n\nSpin Tech 3.0 Expandable Carry-On Spinner Suitcase, $112 at Macy's: While I always aim to travel light, that's not a luxury everyone can afford. It's okay to need extra space and there's no reason to bend over backwards to squish your belongings into luggage that won\u2019t ft them (in their original form, anyway. When you need a little extra girth to your suitcase, the Samsonite Spin Tech Carry-On is expandable, giving you an extra 1.5\" of room for all your souvenirs (or dirty laundry).\n\nIf you can travel, do. And you do, pack correctly. Leaving things behind to save space or lugging around a half-empty suitcase could ruin and otherwise good experience.\n\nNEWSLETTERS The Scouted Newsletter Product recommendations that'll make your life better and tips to help you shop smarter.
