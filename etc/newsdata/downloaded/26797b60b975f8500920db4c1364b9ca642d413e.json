Brown broke the news on Twitter:\n\nThe Patriots issued an official statement about the move: \u201cThe New England Patriots are releasing Antonio Brown. We appreciate the hard work of many people over the past 11 days, but we feel that it is best to move in a different direction at this time.\u201d\n\nBritney Taylor\u2014Brown's former trainer\u2014filed a federal lawsuit in the Southern District of Florida on Sept. 11 that said Brown sexually assaulted her in three separate instances, according to Ben Shpigel of the New York Times.\n\nTaylor said that Brown raped her in 2018, which allegedly followed two previous sexual assaults in 2017.\n\nThe lawsuit also published a pair of emails from Brown to Taylor (warning: offensive language):\n\nRobert Klemko of Sports Illustrated then reported Monday that there was a second accusation of sexual misconduct from another woman, who said Brown approached her naked, with a towel covering his genitals, after hiring her to paint a mural of him.\n\nBrown has denied the allegations against him.\n\nOn Thursday, Klemko reported Brown sent a series of text messages to the source from his original story in which the veteran wideout gave instructions to his associates to investigate the woman (warning: offensive language):\n\nKlemko added a lawyer for the woman Brown hired to paint the mural sent a letter to the NFL Thursday evening to end the conduct by Brown that is \u201cintimidating and threatening to our client, in violation of the NFL Personal Conduct Policy.\u201d\n\nThe 31-year-old officially signed with the Patriots after the team's Week 1 game following his surprise release from the Oakland Raiders.\n\nHe stirred up significant controversy during his brief time in Oakland, missing practice time because of a helmet grievance and a foot injury. After receiving a fine from the team, Brown confronted general manager Mike Mayock in a \"screaming match\" in front of teammates, per Rapoport.\n\nThe Raiders fined him and voided his guarantees, eventually leading to his release less than sixth months after being traded by the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nNew England was there to scoop him up, signing Brown to an incentive-laden contract that could make him up to $15 million in 2019, plus a $20 million option for 2020.\n\nAccording to Rapoport, a source said owner Robert Kraft wouldn't have signed off on the deal had he known about the assault allegations. However, Brown still suited up with the team and totaled 61 yards from scrimmage and a touchdown in one game.\n\nDespite Brown's impact on the field, the Patriots have joined the Raiders and Steelers in deciding his talent is not worth the off-field negatives.\n\nBrown could still draw interest in the open market after being named first-team All-Pro four times and leading the NFL in touchdowns last year, but the number of potential suitors has likely dwindled over the past few weeks.", "description": "Antonio Brown  has been released for the second time this season.
