The saga, unfortunately, continued for two more movies, with similarly deranged sequels in 2011 and 2015.\n\nAfter a four year hiatus, Six is back with a new movie called The Onania Club. While it doesn't sound quite as fucked as the Human Centipede franchise\u2014and how exactly can you top a series that once involved connecting twelve people mouth-to-anus?\u2014it does appear to be also quite unhinged. As IndieWire put it, The Onania Club revolves around a \"secret masturbation society.\" Just take that one in: Secret. Masturbation. Society.\n\nThe term \"disaster porn\" has come to refer to the constant loop of horrific imagery in our modern world, but in Six's The Onania Club, the term is more literal. In the movie's first teaser trailer, which was released yesterday, videos, images, and discussions of tragedy cue disconcerting heavy breathing and secret trips to the ladies room for some, uh, self-love for a specific group of women. \"Hanna secretly joins a group called The Onania Club. Its members, strong independent L.A. bound women, get aroused by the misery of others,\" reads the movie's official synopsis.\n\nWhile the movie appears a little more tame than Six's previous franchise for now, Six has promised that it will be \"one of the most vile, inhumane movie experiences of all time.\" That's a high bar given not just Six's previous work, but also the recent release of movies like this year's The Painted Bird, which has prompted mass panic and walk-outs, and Libert\u00e9's graphic depictions of sex and torture.\n\nAccording to IndieWire, the movie will be presented to distributors next month, so its release date isn't yet clear. For now, you can watch all the moaning and writhing of The Onania Club here, and hope to clear your mind of any lingering memories of The Human Centipede.", "description": "In the new trailer for Tom Six's 'The Onania Club,' a group of women gets horny for tragedy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d974e563ffb36000ade6636/lede/1570200350311-screenshot-trailer-the-onania-club-by-director-tom-six-human-centipede.jpeg?crop=0.7633xw:0.8032xh;0.0035xw,0xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
