Franken, who stepped down from the Senate in 2017 after multiple women accused him of sexual misconduct, found a sympathetic interviewer. O\u2019Brien\u2019s questions largely focused on how the former senator\u2019s life had been negatively affected by the allegations that came out against him, and on the unfairness of his treatment by his old Senate colleagues.\n\nO\u2019Brien started off by making a fairly standard gesture of appreciation for the #MeToo movement \u2014 \u201cI think we can all agree, [it] has brought to light a lot of offensive behavior by a lot of men and rightfully so and has been to the great good,\u201d he said \u2014 before pivoting to Franken. If viewers expected to hear what Franken had learned as one of those men who\u2019d hurt women, too bad. O\u2019Brien was more interested exploring how the movement had hurt him.\n\n\u201cMany people think that your case \u2014 it made them feel uneasy, and there was some questions and uneasiness about your particular situation and how it was resolved,\u201d O\u2019Brian said. He brought up Jane Meyer\u2019s recent New Yorker profile in which several of Franken\u2019s fellow Democratic senators who had asked for his resignation at time said that they now regret it. \u201cIs it feeling to you like there\u2019s a bit of a sea change? Is this a watershed moment for you?\u201d O\u2019Brian asked.\n\nIf it is a \u201cwatershed\u201d moment for Franken, it seems to be one that motivated him only to think of himself. Much of the interview focused on how he was gratified to hear others echo that he \u201cdeserved due process\u201d in the form of a federal investigation, though he chose to resign before that could happen. And though he says he has grown more mindful of how he touches women in the wake of the six claims against him, he still insists that he\u2019s \u201cnot that guy.\u201d Reflecting on what occurred, Franken neither fully owns how he treated his accusers nor his decision to step down. Instead, he blames his colleagues for the \u201ctremendous pressure\u201d they put him under, and minimizes the complaints of the women who say he mistreated them. It\u2019s as though he\u2019s a victim of circumstance rather than someone who took actions, of his own volition, that made women feel uncomfortable and demeaned.\n\nIn closing, O\u2019Brien gave Franken the opportunity to lament how \u201cfrustrating\u201d it was to watch the Senate on C-SPAN from his couch. No doubt we will get to hear more about why we should feel bad for the former senator now that he has been given a slot as host of an upcoming podcast on the 2020 election.", "description": "Al Franken made another appearance on his tentative image rehabilitation tour last night, this time on Late Night With Conan O\u2019Brien.", "authors": ["Bridget Read"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/27/27-al-franken-1.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
