If the Fed were to try to pare the trade deficit, that could make it harder to achieve its other goals of 2% inflation and full employment.\n\nThe Fed on Tuesday begins a two-day policy meeting where it is expected to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point for the second time this year.", "description": "Trump's Fed pick, Shelton, calls for Fed coordination with White House", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8G0ZB_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
