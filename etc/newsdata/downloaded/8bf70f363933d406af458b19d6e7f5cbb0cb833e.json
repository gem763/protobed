(Brian Snyder/Reuters)\n\nHer latest batty idea is up on her Medium page today:\n\nIt\u2019s time for bold action to actually fix the debt crisis. Here\u2019s what my new plan would do: \u2022 It cancels $50,000 in student loan debt for every person with household income under $100,000. \u2022 It provides substantial debt cancellation for every person with household income between $100,000 and $250,000. The $50,000 cancellation amount phases out by $1 for every $3 in income above $100,000, so, for example, a person with household income of $130,000 gets $40,000 in cancellation, while a person with household income of $160,000 gets $30,000 in cancellation. \u2022 It offers no debt cancellation to people with household income above $250,000 (the top 5%). \u2022 For most Americans, cancellation will take place automatically using data already available to the federal government about income and outstanding student loan debt. \u2022 Private student loan debt is also eligible for cancellation, and the federal government will work with borrowers and the holders of this debt to provide relief. \u2022 Canceled debt will not be taxed as income.\n\nAll told, more than 75 percent of borrowers would have their loans wiped out completely, and more than 95 percent would see at least some reduction in their debt.\n\nWhere to even start with this? With the fact that student loans are the result of borrowers\u2019 own decisions \u2014 often good decisions that increased their earning power? With the fact that people who\u2019ve been to college are generally more fortunate than those who have not? With the fact that this discriminates against people who paid off their loans early, as well as older borrowers who have been making payments for longer? With the fact it would subsidize even people making six-figure incomes? With the marriage penalty inherent in using \u201chousehold income\u201d to set the thresholds? With the fact that the student-loan \u201ccrisis\u201d is dramatically overstated to begin with, with most borrowers paying less than 5 percent of their income each month?\n\nHow about better uses for the $640 billion this would cost, nearly $2,000 for every single human being in the country?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd that\u2019s before we get to the \u201cUniversal Free College program,\u201d which \u201cbrings the total cost of the program to roughly $1.25 trillion over ten years.\u201d", "description": "This is nearly $2,000 for every single human being in the country, and there are better uses for that money.", "authors": ["Robert Verbruggen", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
