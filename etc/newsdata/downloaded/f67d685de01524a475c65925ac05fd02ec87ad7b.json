He was swiftly ejected from the room and stayed outside shortly after to complain to reporters about the situation.\n\nMr Gaetz argued that, because the House judiciary committee, of which he is a member, has previously led impeachment enquiries, he should have been allowed in the room.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m on agriculture,\u201d Mr Gaetz said. \u201cWhat are the Democrats so afraid of?\u201d\n\nThe Republican congressman was attempting to enter the closed-door hearing with Fiona Hill, Mr Trump\u2019s British-born former top aide on Russia and ex-deputy assistant to the president.\n\nMr Gaetz has repeatedly called for an end to the impeachment inquiry, and on Monday was roundly mocked on Twitter for trying to crash the meeting.\n\nI suspect there is concern that Gaetz entered the room to be Trump\u2019s eyes and ears. https://t.co/pX8SOzzKMU \u2014 Renato Mariotti (@renato_mariotti) October 14, 2019\n\nRenato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor, tweeted: \u201cI suspect there is concern that Gaetz entered the room to be Trump\u2019s eyes and ears.\u201d\n\nElie Honig, another former federal prosecutor, said: \u201cThis is a mob tactic - send a tough guy into the courtroom to glare at the witness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen much tougher guys than Gaetz do it,\u201d he added.\n\nAs the former prosecutor noted, Mr Gaetz previously tweeted a seemingly threatening message to Mr Trump\u2019s former attorney Michael Cohen the night before he was set to testify before the House oversight committee.\n\n\u201cHey @MichaelCohen212 \u2013 Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends? Maybe tonight would be a good time for that chat,\u201d he wrote at the time. \u201cI wonder if she\u2019ll remain faithful when you\u2019re in prison. She\u2019s about to learn a lot.\u201d\n\nThe House ethics committee later launched an investigation into incendiary tweets he posted about the president\u2019s former attorney. He later apologised and was cleared of wrongdoing by the Florida bar.\n\nMs Hill was testifying before the House panels surrounding Mr Trump\u2019s phone call with Ukraine, which sparked allegations of the president abusing his power by seeking foreign aid in his 2020 re-election efforts.\n\nA memorandum of a phone call between Mr Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky showed Mr Trump requesting a \u201cfavour\u201d from Mr Zelensky before discussing one of his political rivals, Joe Biden, a 2020 contender for the White House. The memorandum shows Mr Trump urging Mr Zelensky to launch an investigation into Mr Biden and his son, Hunter, despite there being no evidence of wrongdoing by either of them.\n\nHe also asked Mr Zelensky to look into the origins of the US probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election to seemingly support his long-held claims that Ukraine was responsible for US election meddling in 2016 rather than the Kremlin.\n\nThat claim defies the findings of the US intelligence community, the US Senate and Mr Trump\u2019s own CIA director, who confirmed Russia was behind a multi-pronged effort to undermine Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy.\n\nFollowing his latest stunt, Mr Gaetz tweeted: \u201cThey are trying to overturn the result of a national election for President from behind closed doors\u201d.\n\nRead more\n\nTrump shoots journalists and political rivals in fake video", "description": "A loyal supporter of Donald Trump has been removed from a closed-door impeachment hearing after House officials ruled he had no right to be there.Matt Gaetz, a Republican congressman from Florida, had attempted to crash a meeting put together by the House intelligence, foreign affairs and oversight committees", "authors": ["Chris Riotta"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7T0SpebtKJua7baJIF7zKw--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/7a1de6ca7aa8010c14f180d3e5bf1042", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
