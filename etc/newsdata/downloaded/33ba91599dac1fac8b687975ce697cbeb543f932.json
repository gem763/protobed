A sob cut the judge off and Kemp paused to address the courtroom: \u201cNo outbursts.\u201d\n\nGuyger, 31, could face life in prison for the slaying.\n\nThe jury began hearing testimony during the sentencing phase of the trial - Texas is among a handful of U.S. states where juries can decide on sentencing - but adjourned for the day by late afternoon.\n\nProsecutors showed them several text messages that painted Guyger as a violent racist.\n\nOne text Guyger wrote in January 2018 stated how she would like to use pepper spray on the crowd at a Martin Luther King Jr. parade in Dallas, while in another she wrote that her black police colleagues \u201cjust have a different way of working and it shows.\u201d\n\nGuyger also shared a post on Pinterest that stated: \u201cI wear all black to remind you not to mess with me, because I\u2019m already dressed for your funeral.\u201d\n\nRARE CONVICTION\n\nIt is relatively rare for U.S. police officers to be convicted of murder for shooting people they view as suspects. But unlike other recent high-profile killings, such as those of Michael Brown in Missouri and Philando Castile in Minnesota, Guyger was not on duty or responding to a reported crime when she pulled the trigger.\n\n\u201cBotham was the best we had to offer. It shouldn\u2019t take all that for unarmed black and brown people to get justice,\u201d said civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump, who is representing the Jean family.\n\n\u201cThis verdict is for Trayvon Martin, for Michael Brown ... for Eric Garner ... for so many unarmed black and brown unarmed human beings across America.\u201d\n\nMartin, whose family was also represented by Crump, was shot and killed in 2012 by a civilian neighborhood watchman in Florida, who was cleared. Garner died in 2014 when a New York police officer put him in a prohibited chokehold, that officer was fired last month.\n\nGuyger, who had spent four years on the force before the killing, took the rare step of testifying in her own defense during her trial, tearfully expressing regret for shooting Jean but saying she had believed her life was in danger when she pulled the trigger.\n\nDuring the trial, Guyger\u2019s defense attorney said she was \u201con autopilot\u201d after a long work day, when she mistakenly parked on the wrong floor in the garage and was able to enter Jean\u2019s apartment because he had left the door slightly ajar.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m so sorry. I have to live with this every single day,\u201d Guyger told the jury of eight women and four men.\n\nBotham Jean\u2019s mother, Allison Jean, rejoices in the courtroom after former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger was found guilty of murder by a 12-person jury in the 204th District Court at the Frank Crowley Courts Building in Dallas, Texas, U.S. October 1, 2019.

Guyger testified that the call was in relation to work.\n\nNeither prosecutors nor the defense focused on race during the trial.\n\nLee Merritt, another lawyer for the Jean family, said they were unsurprised by the verdict.\n\n\u201cYou had someone who was unarmed, unaggressive eating a bowl of ice cream, and somebody barged in and shot him to death,\u201d Merritt told reporters after the verdict was read. \u201cWe believed the right verdict would come out, though we knew that in America that is rare.\u201d\n\nJean\u2019s mother, Allison, was the first to provide testimony in the sentencing phase of the trial. She told the jury her son was a star student who had attended Harding University, a Christian school in Arkansas.\n\nSlideshow (8 Images)\n\nWhen asked about the moment she learned her son had been killed, she choked on tears.\n\n\u201cMy life has not been the same. It\u2019s been a roller coaster,\u201d she said. \u201cI cannot sleep. I cannot eat. It\u2019s just been the most terrible time for me.\u201d", "description": "A Dallas jury on Tuesday found former police officer Amber Guyger guilty of murder for accidentally walking into a neighbor's apartment while thinking it was her own and fatally shooting him as he ate ice cream.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435975366&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9038S"}
