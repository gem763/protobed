It may also be that researchers caught this site before it was actively spammed to veterans.\n\nThe Talos team also linked this campaign to the work of a recently discovered state-sponsored hacking group named Tortoiseshell, believed to be operating under the protection of the Iranian government.\n\nLittle is known about this group, whose operations only recently came to the forefront, following the publication of a Symantec report last week.\n\nAccording to Symantec, the group has been previously seen engaged in supply-chain attacks on 11 IT providers based in Saudi Arabia. It is believed that the purpose of these attacks was to use these 11 companies' infrastructures to drop malware on the networks of their respective customers.\n\nMore details about this group's operations will likely surface in the next months. Fellow cyber-security vendor CrowdStrike tracks this group under a different name of Imperial Kitten, per this spreadsheet that aggregates data on all nation-state hacking operations.\n\nIn February 2019, US officials formally charged a former US Air Force intelligence agent with treason after she fled to Iran in 2013 and later worked to help Iran's government hacking crews to target and hack former Air Force colleagues.", "description": "Fake US veteran hiring website spreads remote access trojan (RAT).", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/06/19/a75a1458-4b1a-4302-9670-132de4bf57e3/thumbnail/770x578/281a8155680507d9ee4ff4914a8283f9/us-soldiers-veterans.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
