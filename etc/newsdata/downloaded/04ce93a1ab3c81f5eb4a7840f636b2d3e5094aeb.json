The shareholders\u2019 suit claims the Treasury Department and the Federal Housing Finance Agency exceeded their authority by taking all of Fannie and Freddie\u2019s earnings. The FHFA is the companies\u2019 regulator.\n\nThe lower court ruling has \u201csignificant financial implications for the federal government, the enterprises and market participants,\u201d the Justice Department argued in its petition to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Trump administration contends the 2008 law that set up the FHFA precludes lawsuits that challenge the profit sweep. Fannie and Freddie were put under federal control later that year as the housing market cratered, and ultimately received a $191 billion taxpayer rescue. The companies have since returned to profitability and have paid more than $300 billion in dividends to the Treasury.\n\nThe controversial decision to hoard Fannie and Freddie profits was made by the Obama administration in 2012. Hedge funds and other shareholders have been fighting to overturn the sweep for years.\n\nThe investors previously filed their own appeal asking the Supreme Court to intervene. They argue that the structure of the FHFA is unconstitutional because its director can be fired by the president only for limited reasons.\n\nThe new case is Mnuchin v. Collins, 19-563.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Greg Stohr in Washington at gstohr@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Joe Sobczyk at jsobczyk@bloomberg.net, Jesse Westbrook, John Harney\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The Trump administration asked the U.S. Supreme Court to toss out a lawsuit by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac investors that challenged the federal government\u2019s hoarding of nearly all the mortgage giant\u2019s profits.In an appeal filed late last week, Justice Department lawyers said a federal", "authors": ["Greg Stohr"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/InYlqDDzqgbrgYLk8aiGfw--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/92247010bd936eba2d91fadd4fd5366f", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
