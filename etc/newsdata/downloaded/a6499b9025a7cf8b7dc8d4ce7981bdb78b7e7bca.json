Euro zone banks raise even as ECB eases", "language": "en", "text": "FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Euro zone banks have raised, not cut, the rates at which they lend to each other since the European Central Bank cut its own rates earlier this month, which negates part of the ECB\u2019s stimulus effort.\n\nFILE PHOTO: European Central Bank (ECB) headquarters building is seen in Frankfurt, Germany, March 7, 2018. REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n\nThe increase in some key inter-bank lending rates, while small, may force the ECB to rethink some components of its stimulus package to ensure households and companies don\u2019t end up footing the bill, bankers warned.\n\nThe ECB announced new bond purchases on Sept. 12 and increased its charge on bank deposits to -0.5% in an effort to shield the euro zone from a global economic slowdown via a weaker euro and lower borrowing costs.\n\nBut it also granted an exemption from that charge on any deposit exceeding six times a bank\u2019s mandatory reserves through a so-called tiered rate on deposits.\n\nThat has resulted in banks raising the rate at which they lend to each other over several months, anticipating that some cash will be withdrawn from the market and parked at the ECB when the new rate takes effect Oct. 30.\n\nIf this persists, the ECB may have to reduce the amount of reserves subject to the exemption to prevent a rise in borrowing costs in the economy, particularly in countries where cash is less abundant, like Italy.\n\n\u201cThe tiering system is having unintended consequences and the ECB may need to lower the multiplier by the end of the year,\u201d one bank treasurer said.\n\nThe rate at which euro zone banks lend to each other against collateral for three months was -0.45% on Monday, compared with -0.50% the day before the ECB cut rates on Sept. 12, Refinitiv data showed.\n\nAnd the rate applied on repurchase agreements in Italy, the only large country where banks have room to increase their central bank reserves free of charge, was even higher.\n\nRates on unsecured loans longer than a month, which are used to price some mortgages and derivative contracts, have also risen, as have yields on Italian bonds with a two-year maturity.\n\n\u201cSo far, the market developments have not been encouraging ... especially in Italy, which was probably not the intention of the ECB when cutting the deposit rate,\u201d said Gilles Moec, chief economist of French insurer AXA.\n\nEuribor curve steepens after ECB rate cut: here\n\nRISKY BUSINESS\n\nTiering the deposit rate was always going to be risky business for the ECB, because of internal imbalances in the euro zone and banks\u2019 lingering reluctance to lend to each other across borders since the euro zone debt crisis of 2011-12.\n\nGerman, French and Dutch banks are coping with excess cash, while lenders in Italy, Portugal and Greece still borrow more from the ECB than they deposit there.\n\nItalian banks, for example, have capacity to deposit an additional 30 billion euros in excess reserves at the ECB at no cost. Doing so by withdrawing cash from the inter-bank lending market or borrowing more from their peers would drive up rates in the country.\n\nBut the ECB still has a weapon in its armoury: its next Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operation (TLTRO III), essentially an auction of cheap multi-year credit, in December.\n\nPictet estimates that Italian banks could borrow 55 billion to 64 billion euros in new TLTRO loans after repaying existing loans.\n\nThis would allow banks that increase lending to the economy to take cash at -0.5% and then deposit at the ECB for free - earning a fast return without draining the money market in the process.\n\n\u201cI think this situation could improve and rates move back down in December when Italian banks can get cheap funds at the second TLTRO III auction,\u201d another treasurer said.\n\nThis was far from certain, however, as dismal take-up at last week\u2019s TLTRO auction showed.\n\nBanks have until June to roll over their maturing TLTRO loans into new ones.\n\n\u201cSome will want to wait until June,\u201d the first treasurer said.", "description": "Euro zone banks have raised, not cut, the rates at which they lend to each other since the European Central Bank cut its own rates earlier this month, which negates part of the ECB's stimulus effort.", "authors": ["Francesco Canepa", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190923&t=2&i=1432982872&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8M192", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
