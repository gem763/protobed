More than two dozen other victims were also reported in the same region of Panama, including a young woman from the United States found murdered earlier this year. Now a return trip to the scene of events\u2014as well as renewed sleuthing by best-selling author Dr. Kathy Reichs and other forensic specialists\u2014provide a fresh take on this cold case.\n\nBOQUETE, Panama\u2014We just hit the Great Divide, at about 4,000 feet, and anywhere we go from here it\u2019s downhill all the way.\n\nThis bosky crest marks the spot where the country\u2019s watersheds break for the Pacific Ocean in one direction, or the Caribbean in the other. From here the trail we\u2019re following drops into a series of steep step-downs, a rugged mix of stony riverbeds and cattle traces that are off limits to tourists without a licensed guide. The far-flung, rainforest track is used chiefly by local ranchers and the region\u2019s population of shy indigenous people known as the Ngobe.", "description": "A series of unsolved murders and disappearances in Panama have baffled authorities, claiming the lives of two young Dutch women, an American, and others.
