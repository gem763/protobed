It is this year\u2019s guaranteed applause line. No matter how clunking the speech or how flat the joke, uttering it gets the members clapping. In the bars and the receptions, it\u2019s the same story \u2013 the phrase has people raising their glasses and cheering approval.\n\nThe message is simple and repetitive: back Boris Johnson to get Brexit done and allow the country to move on and talk about something else. Normally a party comes up with a slogan for its conference and then focus-groups it. But there was no need with this slogan: it came out of the focus groups. No 10 and CCHQ were struck by how often voters said it in these groups, which Dominic Cummings sets such store by, and so decided to adopt it as their own.\n\nBoris Johnson denies groping allegation after backing from Javid Read more\n\nOnly no one seems quite sure how or when they are going to get Brexit done. Johnson has promised to take the UK out of the EU by 31 October \u201cdo or die\u201d \u2013 he has repeatedly said \u201cextension means extinction\u201d for the Tories. But with parliament passing legislation to try to force him to seek an extension, and opposition MPs refusing him an election until that extension is secured, senior Conservatives are starting to contemplate a world in which Brexit isn\u2019t done at the end of October.\n\nAnd so talk at conference has turned to how the party could wear an extension in a general election \u2013 and who could be made to carry the blame.\n\nSome had hoped that this predicament wouldn\u2019t arise because there would be a deal with the European Union. However, ministers and MPs now see agreeing a deal with the EU in the next week as unlikely. \u201cI give it a one in three chance,\u201d says a government minister keen for a Brexit deal. Even Johnson, normally the biggest optimist in the room, is viewed to be relatively downbeat about the chances by members of his cabinet \u2013 with the prime minister playing down the chances of a deal during a cabinet conference call last week.\n\nNot all Tory MPs want a deal right now, though. A number of Conservative MPs who represent Brexit-backing seats that they won from Labour in 2017 worry that an attempt to pass a Brexit deal in the next few weeks could backfire on them at the ballot box. Tory MPs believe that recent rhetoric from No 10 about the Benn bill being the \u201csurrender bill\u201d has cut through with leave voters and the threat of the Brexit party appears to be decreasing as voters increasingly identify Johnson as the champion of leave.\n\nWhy risk that with a Brexit compromise? If Johnson won a time limit on the backstop, it would be a tough sell to get it through parliament. Recent incidents in the chamber \u2013 namely Johnson replying \u201chumbug\u201d to Paula Sherriff\u2019s call for calmer language out of respect to the memory of Jo Cox \u2013 mean that there\u2019s little goodwill between the Tories and Labour MPs, who will find it hard to help Johnson out, even if they wanted Brexit done for their own constituents.\n\nThe Tory worry is that Johnson will go all out to sell a small change to the withdrawal agreement as a big win and then fail to get it through parliament. \u201cWe\u2019d go into the election with Nigel Farage able to say we were no better than Theresa May and her withdrawal agreement,\u201d one MP in a leave seat says. \u201cHe could cry Brexit betrayal.\u201d Meanwhile with Brexit \u201cdone\u201d, Labour leavers would have little reason to vote for the Tories. If Brexit had already happened, there would be no need to vote Tory to make it happen.\n\nMany MPs hope Johnson\u2019s manoeuvring will be enough to simply ensure the UK leaves on the 31 October \u2013 deal or no deal. At that point, MPs would likely bring the government down and an election would follow in which Johnson had made good on his promise.\n\nDespite this prevailing mood, some senior government figures urge caution. While a handful of No 10 aides \u2013 headed by Dominic Cummings \u2013 have suggested they have a way around the bill, which would means Johnson would be able to refuse to request and article 50 extension and not be in breach of the law. The apparent loophole is reportedly known only to Johnson\u2019s inner circle. However, few believe that it is a 100% reliable route. Instead, it\u2019s about the narrative and the fight.\n\nCummings has told colleagues that he expects the last two weeks of October to be spent in the courts. Whatever trick Johnson\u2019s senior aides have up their sleeve, expect it to be contested \u2013 and Johnson to potentially be defeated in court again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about showing that we have done everything possible to try to meet that deadline,\u201d says one government aide. \u201cHopefully it will work but if it doesn\u2019t the public will know it was the Tories who were the ones trying to make it happen.\u201d\n\nWere the courts to legally force Johnson to request an extension, he would be faced with a choice: request or resign. Within No 10 there is mixed opinion on the pros and cons of resigning \u2013 Johnson is personally against the idea. What they agree on is that however they play it, any extension will not be their fault.\n\nBrexit may feel apocalyptic \u2013 but radical new ideas are taking root | John Harris Read more\n\nIf it\u2019s ordered by the courts, blame could be pointed at judges rather than ministers. One source of encouragement is recent focus groups where attendees spoke about the courts getting involved with politics. Attendees saw judges as part of a more general theme of everyone trying to stop Brexit \u2013 and identified Johnson as the person trying to deliver it.\n\nAnother source of hope has been found in a Nigel Farage tweet. When the supreme court ruling came through and found Boris Johnson\u2019s prorogation of parliament unlawful, Farage took to social media to call on Johnson to resign \u201cas a matter of honour\u201d. The bulk of replies from Brexit supporters said that they usually agreed with Farage but on this he was wrong \u2013 Johnson ought not to resign as it would play into the hands of remainers. This is taken as a sign that Johnson\u2019s positioning as the ultimate Brexiteer is landing.\n\nAn election after an extension has been agreed would no doubt be difficult for the Tories. It would risk disillusioned Brexit voters moving to Farage\u2019s party \u2013 and leave voters concluding that Johnson was ineffective. But increasingly, Tories believe that if push comes to shove, they could wear it if they had to.\n\n\u2022 Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor\n\n\u2022 Guardian Live: Brexit, How Likely is a No-Deal Exit?
