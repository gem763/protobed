The most recent Eurobarometer survey shows that while an increasing number of Europeans trust the EU, including in Germany, nearly half tend not to.\n\nDescribing von der Leyen, a party colleague with whom he served in Merkel\u2019s Cabinet, as \u201cfast, structured and ambitious,\u201d Spahn said he expects her to upend the way the EU functions. Even as he was full of praise for his senior party colleague, Spahn's open challenge to von der Leyen's Commission betrayed his own ambition to help steer Europe's future.\n\n\u201cEurope needs ambition and ideas, but Europeans also want solutions that improve their everyday lives,\u201d he said. \u201cFinding the balance between vision and action is what politics is all about and Ursula von der Leyen can do that.\u201d\n\nA former state secretary in the finance ministry under Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Spahn is a leader of the CDU's conservative wing and a favorite of the party's younger members.\n\nThough Spahn regularly comments on EU health issues and was active in the broader European debates during the European election campaign, his latest intervention offers a glimpse of his larger political horizon and comes just as his chances of becoming his party\u2019s standard bearer in the next election have been rekindled.\n\nIn December, he lost a contest for the CDU leadership to Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Merkel's top choice to succeed her as chancellor. Since then, Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s fortunes have faded, with a series of missteps renewing doubts within the party over whether she would be a suitable candidate for chancellor.\n\nIn an effort to bolster Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s standing, Merkel handed her the defense portfolio, which was previously held by von der Leyen. But with only 19 percent of Germans believing she can successfully lead the CDU, according to a poll published earlier this month, Kramp-Karrenbauer faces an uphill battle.\n\nHealth boost\n\nSpahn, 39, has benefited from the shifting winds. As health minister, he has won support by addressing a shortage of caregivers and pushing legislation to increase the number of organ donors. This has bolstered Spahn\u2019s public profile and he now ranks as one of the country\u2019s most popular politicians, well ahead of Kramp-Karrenbauer.\n\nA former state secretary in the finance ministry under Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, Spahn is a leader of the CDU's conservative wing and a favorite of the party's younger members. But he also has a history of tension with Merkel, whose migration policies he criticized and blamed for the party's loss of support.\n\nThat history makes Spahn less appealing to the more moderate coalition of CDU members around Merkel who believe her brand of pragmatic centrism is the key to future success. Spahn also has a reputation for being exceptionally direct, even by German standards, a quality that hasn't endeared him to everyone.\n\nAt the same time, Spahn's steady rise in the party, which came despite Merkel's early efforts to block him, has convinced many of his leadership potential.\n\nEven as he lost the leadership contest to Kramp-Karrenbauer, Spahn was tapped by many members as the man of the party's future.\n\nThough Spahn isn\u2019t the only potential challenger to Kramp-Karrenbauer \u2014 Armin Laschet, the state premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, and Friedrich Merz, another vanquished candidate for the CDU\u2019s leadership last year, are also seen as contenders \u2014 his success in the health ministry has given him momentum.\n\nThe current government\u2019s term doesn\u2019t expire until the fall of 2021. However, disarray within the Social Democrats, the junior partner in Merkel\u2019s \u201cgrand coalition,\u201d has spurred speculation the government may collapse before then. The center-left party is in the midst of a leadership contest that could trigger its exit from the government.\n\n\"Something has to happen there, and fast. People have to feel that Europe is making a difference\" \u2014 Jens Spahn, German health minister\n\nNonetheless, with a clear majority of Germans satisfied with the grand coalition and the SPD withering in the polls, making early elections risky, such an outcome remains unlikely.\n\nThat should give Spahn, who has stayed silent about whether he plans to pursue his party's nomination ahead of the next election, plenty of time to position himself.\n\nFor now, that means regularly doing the rounds on Germany's talk show circuit and prodding Europe on what he describes as the \"great problem of migration.\"\n\n\"Something has to happen there, and fast,\" he said. \"People have to feel that Europe is making a difference.\"\n\nThe CDU\u2019s practice has been to put forth the party\u2019s leader as its candidate for chancellor, hence the expectation that Kramp-Karrenbauer would follow Merkel. Yet there is no hard and fast rule.\n\nIf Kramp-Karrenbauer continues to lose ground and the CDU along with her (the Greens have pulled within striking distance of the conservatives in recent months), party tradition could follow Merkel out the door.", "description": "Up-and-coming German health minister urges his CDU colleague to upend the way Brussels works.", "authors": ["Matthew Karnitschnig", "Judith Mischke", "Joshua Posaner", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1158368309-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
