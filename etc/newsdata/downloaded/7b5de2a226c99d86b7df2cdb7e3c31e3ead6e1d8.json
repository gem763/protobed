The protests are slated to last two weeks.\n\nA person from the group was raising a neon green flag on top of the 11-foot-tall bronze statue, surrounded by city police officers. Several protesters appeared to be laying on the ground around the bull with red paint on their bodies, staging a \"die-in,\" or simulating being dead.\n\nThe protesters were blocking tourists before the NYPD moved in and began making arrests. A line of arrested protesters were walked out by police to shouts of \"Thank you, rebels.\"\n\n\"To governments of the world, we declared a Climate and Ecological Emergency. You did not do enough,\" Extinction Rebellion's website said. \"Together, we will peacefully occupy the centers of power and shut them down until governments act on the Climate and Ecological Emergency.\"\n\nThe bull, a symbol of American capitalism, is a frequent target of protests. It was vandalized two years ago by climate protesters.\n\nDemonstrations have taken place in countries including the U.K., Germany, Spain, Austria, France and New Zealand. Protesters in London shut down Lambeth bridge, Whitehall, the Mall and major central London roads. Thirty people were reportedly charged with committing offences in Sydney, while more than 100 were arrested in Amsterdam.\n\nExtinction Rebellion was established in the U.K. in May 2018 with about one hundred academics signing a call to action.\n\n\u2014 CNBC's Elizabeth Myong contributed to this article.", "description": "A group of protesters calling for action against climate change vandalized the iconic Wall Street charging bull on Monday, pouring red paint on it and climbing atop it.", "authors": ["Yun Li"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106168130-1570463301309gettyimages-1174230705.jpeg?v=1570463327", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
