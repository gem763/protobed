Going through customs was surprisingly smooth, he says. \u201cThe lady said: \u2018Hey, did you have a problem with immigration here in 2015?\u2019\u201d He laughs. \u201cI said, yeah.\u201d\n\nFour years ago, his experience was very different. The then 24-year-old rapper and musician, born Tyler Okonma, was supposed to be playing at Reading and Leeds festivals that summer. Instead, when he landed in the UK, he was taken into a detention room and shown lyrics from his first two albums: Bastard, a mixtape he had put out in 2009, when he was 18; and Goblin, from 2011. Okonma had been to the UK since those albums had come out (once, to host a screening of Napoleon Dynamite), but nevertheless he was told that he had been banned from the country for three to five years. The home secretary at the time, Theresa May, used anti-terrorism legislation to forbid him entry, releasing an official statement that said his work \u201cencourages violence and intolerance of homosexuality\u201d and \u201cfosters hatred with views that seek to provoke others to terrorist acts\u201d.\n\nToday, Okonma laughs. \u201cShe\u2019s gone, so I\u2019m back.\u201d\n\nAt the time, the ban was controversial; looking back, it seems absurd, whatever you think of his output. Those who approved argued that Okonma was a homophobe and a misogynist. Certainly, his early records were peppered with \u201cbitch\u201d and \u201cfaggot\u201d; on one track, Blow, he rapped from the perspective of Ted Bundy, the serial killer pop culture can\u2019t seem to leave alone. But Eminem, who built his early career on a cartoonishly violent alter ego, was never banned. When another American artist, Offset, rapped: \u201cI cannot vibe with queers,\u201d in early 2018, he was forced to apologise, but his band, Migos, played a show in London two months later. It remains unclear why Okonma was singled out for music he had made years before and no longer performed.\n\nBut his life and career have played out as a series of contradictions. His most recent album, Igor, is about a love affair with a man, and he has talked and rapped about his attraction to men for years. (On the track I Ain\u2019t Got Time!, from his 2017 album Flower Boy, Okonma rapped: \u201cNext line will have \u2019em like: \u2018Woah\u2019 / I\u2019ve been kissing white boys since 2004.\u201d) His work is increasingly subtle and inventive, and bold in its vision. As the opening line for his first big hit, 2011\u2019s Yonkers, goes: \u201cI\u2019m a fucking walking paradox / No, I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nOkonma is in the middle of an ambitious international tour; on the day we meet, he will play the second of three sold-out shows at Brixton Academy in London, his first gigs in the UK since the ban. (He attempted a surprise outdoor performance in nearby Peckham earlier this year, but it was pulled due to overcrowding.) \u201cIt\u2019s been four years since I\u2019ve been back,\u201d he tells the audience from the stage in Brixton. \u201cSince this beautiful, flawless black skin was allowed in the country.\u201d The roar of the adoring young audience, many of them wearing Tyler merch, is deafening.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest On stage in London last month. Photograph: Getty Images\n\nAs 2019 draws to a close, it is clear that Okonma has embarked on a new phase in his career. On Igor, which appeared unannounced in May, the former rap provocateur remodels himself as a blond-wigged, Warhol-esque funk and soul singer. It seems a conscious attempt at reinvention. Okonma, who arranged and produced everything on the record, keeps its many guest spots (Kanye West, Solange Knowles, Slowthai, La Roux, Pharrell Williams) low-key, listing them in the liner notes rather than alongside the track names. He plays with samples of Run DMC, Al Green and Ponderosa Twins Plus One and is inspired by 80s pop \u2013 Everything But The Girl and Sade. His baritone rap has mostly been replaced with singing in a higher register; tracks such as A Boy Is a Gun* and Earfquake are sentimental soul songs that brim with heartbreak and longing. One of the year\u2019s best records (and his first US No 1), Igor has brought him a new audience, some of whom tell him they don\u2019t like his old stuff \u2013 although, by the same token, some of the old audience prefer his earlier sounds.\n\nI am supposed to sit down with Okonma for an hour, in the studio after the Guardian\u2019s photoshoot, but the plan changes immediately. \u201cYou know you\u2019re coming with us, right? There\u2019s a record store I gotta hit,\u201d he says. Also, he wants to buy his mother some perfume. We spend the rest of the day driving around London \u2013 east, north, central \u2013 shopping and eating, talking and walking, with a revolving crew of friends and acquaintances who drop in and out. He gets bored quickly, but is easily pleased. Intensely serious one minute, the next he is sliding and twirling towards Vill, his stoic man-mountain of a bodyguard, and dry-humping him. Vill\u2019s strategy seems to be to fondly, patiently ignore it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cap, golflefleur.com. Shirt, Comme des Gar\u00e7ons. Jewellery throughout, Tyler\u2019s own. Photograph: Paul Farrell/The Guardian\n\nOddly, as Okonma\u2019s notoriety has subsided, his fame seems to have risen. When we go for a walk in central London, he is stopped every few seconds by fans wanting to say hi, bump fists and take selfies. (He doesn\u2019t do pictures; given the number of people asking, I see why.) Is it always like this when he is out? \u201cIt is now,\u201d he says. \u201cSince Igor.\u201d\n\nUndoing a ban on entering a country is a long and complicated process, Okonma explains, when we have made our way to the back of the car, with Vill riding up front. It took many lawyers and letters, much money and time. \u201cThen you get the official thumbs up. It was like: damn, finally, but it was so stupid to have to endure that. I got treated like a terrorist.\u201d\n\n\u2018I feel like I won some invisible fight\u2019\n\nIt is certainly difficult to reconcile the rapper banned for hate speech with the puppyish man I meet, who is alternately enthusiastic and droll, sweet, smart, prone to penis gags and curious about everything. \u201cYeah. I got treated like I was a murderer,\u201d he says. He is wearing an emerald-green flat cap with matching knee-high socks that set off the green and gold of the grills on his teeth, a cricket jumper draped over his shoulders. He has his own clothing line, Golf, and his sharp look is part of the reason people\u2019s heads turn with whiplash speed when he passes by. His nails are painted with glitter and he has a laser beam of charisma, when he decides to turn it on. \u201cIt was kind of stupid, and after a while I was like: I don\u2019t even want to come back. But it was more the principle of: \u2018Y\u2019all really did this, over this? In comparison to other shit people do, that y\u2019all let in?\u2019 So I\u2019m happy that I got back. I feel like I won some invisible fight.\u201d\n\nDid the length of the ban surprise him? \u201cYeah, it surprised me. But then I remembered \u2013 I\u2019m dark-skinned, so, ahh, all right, I get it. I mean, I don\u2019t point my finger at that at first, but I looked at every outcome and I looked at every option.\u201d He makes a circle with his hands. \u201cAnd after doing that six times, then you say, OK, what\u2019s the difference between everyone else and me? And then you land on that.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThe Tyler, the Creator story began when Okonma was a young skater in Los Angeles, hanging out with a group of friends who coalesced around the name Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All. The loose collective, shortened to Odd Future, was home to a number of acts who have since broken big: the Internet, Earl Sweatshirt and Frank Ocean, among others. Their brand of goofy nihilism was blithely immature and deliberately provocative and it flourished online: there were mixtapes, pop-up clothing shops, Jackass-style TV shows. The aesthetic was cartoonish, all doughnuts and cats, while the lyrics were blunt-force hate-everything teen rebellion.\n\nMany people go through an obnoxious adolescent phase, but Okonma became famous during his \u2013 and the evidence lingers in those old lyrics. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realise that all the stupid shit they did, no one knows about it but the three people in their hometown. All the stupid shit I did, or said, was public.\u201d Does he regret any of it? \u201cOh no,\u201d he says, quickly. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change a thing.\u201d\n\nHe was raised in LA by his mother. It was just the two of them until he was eight, when she had a daughter. When he was a teenager, his mother moved to Sacramento, so he lived with his grandmother for four years. Is she still alive? \u201cNo, she died in, like, 2012. Don\u2019t say you\u2019re sorry,\u201d he booms. I wasn\u2019t going to, I say. \u201cPeople say that and it\u2019s like: what are you sorry about? Did you kill her? No. Cancer killed her.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest With the Odd Future collective, including Frank Ocean (centre). Photograph: Getty Images\n\nHe moved a lot, which meant he changed schools every year or so. He found it hard to fit in. \u201cThe stuff I was into was a little different to the other kids who looked like me. They liked basketball and sports and stuff like that, and I never liked it.\u201d He did, however, know how to rap. \u201cThat would get me the thumbs up. But I like skateboarding and I was like: check these moves out. And they weren\u2019t feeling it. I was super-annoying. I was really hyper, loud, class clown. Just sarcastic, witty, quick.\u201d He clicks his fingers. \u201cAgile.\u201d\n\nWas he ever diagnosed with anything? \u201cNah! I should have been, probably.\u201d He laughs. \u201cMy friends say I should have been. I\u2019m trying to be chill, but, man, I just have so much energy. I think I will be like that for ever. Which I\u2019m not mad at.\u201d As well as music and fashion, Okonma directs his own videos. He has done so from the beginning: he is responsible for the black and white clip for Yonkers, a fevered nightmare in which he appears to eat a cockroach that has been crawling all over his face, before his eyes turn black. In IFHY, he transforms himself into a plastic mannequin in a gaudy suburban dolls\u2019 house; his most recent, for A Boy Is a Gun*, has echoes of Cindy Sherman\u2019s Untitled Film Stills. (In 2013, Kanye West revealed that he had asked Okonma to teach him how to make a music video.)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Taking his bike for a spin. Photograph: GC Images\n\nHe also runs the festival Camp Flog Gnaw, at the Dodger stadium in LA, although he insists that making music will always be his principal passion \u2013 everything else is \u201ca spider web\u201d. Does his mind ever switch off? \u201cNah, not really. It\u2019s always music playing in my head, 24/7. I\u2019m always thinking about something, always looking. There\u2019s so much to look at.\u201d\n\nWe arrive at Alan\u2019s in East Finchley, a crate-digger\u2019s secondhand paradise that was recommended by a friend. Okonma jumps out of the car and spends nearly an hour flicking through the racks, playing records, chatting to other customers and asking for tips. His manager tells me this is how they spend their time on tour, in music shops and vintage stores. Okonma has a ritual for hunting new sounds. If the artwork grabs him, he looks at the year. If it was made between 1974 and 1982, he will look to see who was involved; if it is a name he recognises, he will pick it up. He tries Roy Ayers\u2019 LP No Stranger To Love. Alan comes over to adjust the RPM (\u201cRoy would be very upset\u201d) as Okonma nods along to the track Don\u2019t Hide Your Love.\n\nAlan asks Okonma if he has a picture he can sign. \u201cI don\u2019t keep anything on me. I see this in the mirror all the time,\u201d he says, gesturing to his face. But he takes a picture outside instead and promises to send it. A schoolboy walks past, looking mildly confused, as if telling himself he couldn\u2019t have just seen Tyler, the Creator in the suburbs of north London.\n\nBack in the car, our conversation turns to Odd Future again. People tell Okonma all the time that it was a youth culture phenomenon, he says. \u201cI feel like people make it seem bigger than it really was. But I was living in it, so I guess it\u2019s different when you\u2019re in it. It just felt like this small internet thing.\u201d But its influence, and by extension his, can be felt all over pop. Pitchfork declared last year that \u201cOdd Future changed everything\u201d, praising its \u201cunruly creativity\u201d and its resistance to any one genre. It is even there in the gothic minimalism of LA teen sensation Billie Eilish, who wrote recently: \u201cI would be nothing without you, Tyler, and everyone knows it.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cap and hoodie, golflefleur.com. All other clothes, Tyler\u2019s own. Photograph: Paul Farrell/The Guardian\n\nOkonma resists being pushed on why the collective struck such a chord, but he guesses that what they were doing just seemed new. \u201cIt spoke to people differently, in the sense that everything coming from Los Angeles was gang culture, low riders and Dr Dre \u2013 and we weren\u2019t that at all.\u201d\n\nHe is distracted by the view from the window, a long sweep of Finsbury Park. \u201cMan, a lot of really pretty parks! Oh man, your parks are really good.\u201d A couple of days earlier, he and his friends rode their bikes to a hill \u2013 he is not sure which \u2013 to watch the sun set. \u201cIt was the most romantic scene I think I\u2019ve seen in my life. People were just playing cards and hanging out. I find little cheesy shit like that really cool.\u201d Does that mean he likes the UK now? \u201cYeah.\u201d A pause. \u201cYour food still sucks.\u201d\n\nOkonma flickers between thoughtful and clownish in the blink of an eye. In the past, his Twitter posts were so dry that it was hard to know whether he was being serious or not. In 2015, he tweeted: \u201cI tried to come out the damn closet like four days ago and no one cared hahahaha,\u201d and nobody seemed to take him at his word. \u201cSee, that\u2019s the thing,\u201d he says now. \u201cPeople always think I\u2019m being sarcastic if I give a compliment. It\u2019s weird, but it\u2019s gotten better.\u201d How so? \u201cI stopped being funny and joking. Publicly. I\u2019m still a goofball with my friends, but I like to keep that off the internet.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest At last year\u2019s Grammys. Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock\n\nIt is funny that he had to come out again and again before anyone took him seriously. \u201cYeah.\u201d He likens it to a performance where nobody knows what is real. For instance: \u201cScary Movie 2 is one of my favourite movies. She gets stabbed on stage \u2013 but it\u2019s acting, in a beauty pageant, so they\u2019re like: \u2018Oh my God, she\u2019s so good.\u2019\u201d\n\nNevertheless, he seems to enjoy the confusion \u2013 most of the time. When he was banned for being homophobic, it hurt. \u201cBro! That\u2019s the thing, bro. People knew I wasn\u2019t. People knew the intent!\u201d He points out of the window. \u201cThat tree over there could be a faggot! Who hasn\u2019t played Call Of Duty online and heard some 11-year-old call you that because you killed him? You knew the intent behind it and then people were faking, like, he\u2019s homophobic? That was pissing me off. It\u2019s just another word.\u201d\n\nOne of his favourite rappers as a kid was Eminem. But when Okonma said he thought a new Eminem track was \u201chorrible\u201d, Eminem responded by including him on a diss track, Fall, with the line: \u201cTyler create nothing, I see why you call yourself a faggot, bitch.\u201d There was widespread criticism; Bon Iver, who featured on the track, tweeted that he had asked for it to be changed: \u201cNot a fan of the message, it\u2019s tired.\u201d In an interview, Eminem said later that he had gone too far: \u201cIn my quest to hurt him, I realise that I was hurting a lot of other people by saying it.\u201d\n\nWhat was it like to be called that? \u201cOK,\u201d says Okonma, looking me dead in the eye. \u201cDid you ever hear me publicly say anything about that? Because I knew what the intent was. He felt pressured because people got offended for me. Don\u2019t get offended for me. We were playing Grand Theft Auto when we heard that. We rewound it and were like: \u2018Oh.\u2019\u201d He shrugs. \u201cAnd then kept playing.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jumper, lacoste.com. All other clothes, Tyler\u2019s own.

Stylist\u2019s assistant: Peter Bevan\n\nHe asks the driver to pull over \u2013 he has seen a newsagent and he wants to buy a magazine. Then we walk, and then he is hungry, so we duck into a burger place. When he is waiting, or understimulated, you get flashes of the taunting, cartoonish Tyler, the Creator character, bored and in search of a reaction. He holds the point of a steak knife under his chin and stares at me. He puts it down and picks it up again, pressing it gently into the flesh of his neck. \u201cThat\u2019s not funny,\u201d he says, gravely, then does it again. \u201cYes it is.\u201d He shows me an old scar on his forearm, which he got by testing the sharpness of a friend\u2019s knife (turned out it was really sharp). He is wearing a plastic beaded wristband and I ask him what it says. \u201cIt says Jay-Z,\u201d he fibs. \u201cI found it at a funeral.\u201d It reads \u201cOne of One\u201d.\n\nOkonma walks his own path. He doesn\u2019t drink and never has. He doesn\u2019t like the night-time; he much prefers the day. He rides his bike whenever he can. He rarely hangs out with rappers. He doesn\u2019t take drugs. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen cocaine in my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI just don\u2019t like to hang around with people who indulge in that.\u201d The mark he has made on pop culture is plain, although he disputes that his sound has been particularly influential. \u201cI just think I\u2019ve influenced how people present certain things, whether it\u2019s clothes or fashion or how their videos are. I allowed some people to just be freer. I mean, I hope I have. I hope I allow people to know that there\u2019s no rules and they can do whatever they want, artistically.\u201d\n\nIt has been made easier by the fact that he genuinely doesn\u2019t seem to care what people think of him. \u201cI always did what I want. I always knew I\u2019d be successful, since I was eight.\u201d He seems amused that I find this funny. \u201cThink of me and my personality and everything,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat else would I be good at?\u201d\n\n\u2022 If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication).\n\nThis article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.
