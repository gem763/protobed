Russia has also suffered several prominent nuclear accidents in the past two months, elevating skepticism that it can guarantee the security of nuclear facilities.\n\nThe issue of atomic research came up last week in relation to a visit by Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev to Havana, where he spent most of his trip denouncing American sanctions on the repressive communist regime there. Medvedev himself did not mention nuclear energy but, according to the Russian government websites RT and Sputnik, first deputy head of the Russian Government Office Sergei Prikhodko did.\n\nWe are currently examining some interesting projects on the non-energy use of atoms,\u201d Prikhodko said. \u201cReally, this is about the use of nuclear technology in medicine and agriculture.\u201d\n\nPrikhodko added that Cuba is equipped with \u201ca professional corps of highly qualified physicists and engineers who graduated from Soviet and Russian schools.\u201d\n\nA major hurdle for Moscow is that Cuba reportedly has no interest in spending money on an elaborate nuclear energy sector, despite the fact that the communist regime\u2019s dilapidated energy grid is on the verge of collapse, causing regular blackouts throughout the country.\n\nAs our Cuban colleagues had informed us, they have no plans of creating nuclear power generation industry in the country, Prikhodko said. If this decision is reviewed, then naturally, Russia will be ready to become Cuba\u2019s strategic partner in this direction. At present, we are discussing a wide range of so-called non-energy use of peaceful atom\n\nWhile RT claimed \u201cMoscow is planning to cooperate on nuclear energy with Havana,\u201d the topic did not arise publicly in talks between Medvedev and Cuban officials last week.\n\nAt Cubanet, columnist Pedro Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez Reinoso notes two major hurdles to Cuba\u2019s acceptance of a Russian deal to build a domestic nuclear energy sector: its top physicist \u2013 Fidel Castro\u2019s son, Fidel Castro D\u00edaz-Balart \u2013 committed suicide, and the last time it tried to build a nuclear power plant, it failed spectacularly. Castro D\u00edaz-Balart was 68 when he committed suicide last year after months of being in what the government called a \u201cdeep depressive state.\u201d Havana has never elaborated on the circumstances of his death and has largely failed to replace his capacity as a nuclear energy leader on the island. As the head of Cuba\u2019s failed nuclear program, D\u00edaz-Balart was in charge of the Juragu\u00e1 Nuclear Power Plant in central Cuba, whose construction began in 1983. The collapse of the Soviet Union resulted in the cancelation of the project even as construction on one of the reactors was complete. Escaped workers on the plant offered testimony to the House of Representatives suggesting that \u201csafety concerns such as poor construction practices \u2026 could affect the safety of the reactors\u2019 operation.\u201d\n\nGonz\u00e1lez noted that, as recently as this February, the Communist Party newspaper Granma boasted about the regime\u2019s alleged efforts to make the \u201cNuclear City,\u201d the region around the doomed power plant, plentiful in food and agriculture. Cuba is currently facing extreme food and basic good shortages, a product of decades of socialist mismanagement and the collapse of its colony, Venezuela.\n\nMedvedev suggested extending economic ties to Cuba outside of the nuclear sector, though he did mention energy development as a sector in which both countries could cooperate while in Havana.\n\nRussia and Cuba have large joint projects in various areas, including transport, agriculture, energy and high technology. Today\u2019s talks ended with the signing of a number of documents which will promote cooperation. pic.twitter.com/EPJottKf4C \u2014 Dmitry Medvedev (@MedvedevRussiaE) October 3, 2019\n\nA report by The Guardian this August revealed that Russia has been touring impoverished, unfree countries seeking nuclear deals, particularly in Africa. Rosatom has signed agreements with Sudan, Ethiopia, Republic of Congo, and Nigeria within two years \u2013 all nations with a history of unstable governments and insurgent movements. In the event of a government catastrophe in Nigeria, for example, the jihadist group Boko Haram could end up with access to nuclear materials.\n\nThese concerns do not take into account Russia\u2019s own lackluster safety record with nuclear material at home. In July, for example, a nuclear-equipped Russian submarine suffered a major fire, killing 14 sailors. While Moscow insisted the fire never came close to triggering a nuclear disaster, one of the sailors speaking of the fallen at their official funeral thanked them for giving their lives to avoid a \u201cplanetary catastrophe,\u201d raising eyebrows.\n\nTwo separate Russian power plants suffered accidents that same month. The Beloyarsk power plant went offline in mid-July automatically, a trigger that typically kicks in in response to an accident. The Kalinin nuclear plant, about 200 miles from Moscow, had a transformer short-circuit and shut it down the same week.\n\nIn August, a missile test site suffered an accident and subsequent fire that Russian officials refused to offer much information on. While Moscow claimed that the accident did not involve nuclear material, those injured at the explosion site showed signs of radiation, doctors said, and two nuclear monitoring stations shut down.", "description": "A senior Russian official suggested that Moscow could be a top partner to Cuba should it ever decide to build a nuclear power plant.", "authors": ["Frances Martel"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/08/wi/ap/23/abf26b_russia-mozambique-71229-russian-president-vladimir-putin-attends-meeting-e1570574494445-639x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
