It was a meeting of two grass-root head of states, both highly tactical, representing the world\u2019s oldest cultures, presently negotiating on an economic, financial turf. The repercussions again shall be global.\n\nBoth these leaders, the naturally endowed Modiji and the wise Mr Xi, have a plan in mind, but the auditions that portray them are different. If one was to read by expressions (personal anecdotes, biographies published), Mr XI has a half smiling expression on most occasions, no matter what the context, friends or rivals, as though all that is imbibed, is being processed in the mind.\n\nModiji has the tactics of an iconic boxer (Muhammad Ali). Knows how to step back and lean on the ropes, tire the opponent, and then hit out with his famous \u201cleft upper hook\u201d. Three or four of them are enough to settle an ambivalent deal.\n\nIn this context, to invite Mr Xi, his willingness to come, and a return invitation to Mr Modi, shows that the less heard seven-hour talks these days, were not without hacking to bits, each hurdle or consensus between the two countries. Probably the respective ministries would be working on this, and major pronouncements may come later, after the brick and mortar talks, actualize into a monumental understanding, so necessary between neighbours, and further, the global manufacturing and trading share that they dabble in.\n\nSo why was it Mahaballapuram by the seaside? The ancient and rich culture of TN was not hailed without a reason at the UNGA, Mr Modi quoting Tamil poet, Poongundranar, \u201cWe harbour a kinship for all places, and all people are our own\u201d At that moment, in the UN, the camera turned on the scholarly foreign minister, who was graceful enough to give a subdued glance.\n\nOne of the discussions, entirely through personal analysis, could have been be the present slump in the automobile industry that has largely affected the economies of both countries. TN is the hub of automobiles in India. Mahindra, TVS, TaMo. Ford has recently signed a pact with Mahindra. The era of EV (electrical vehicles) s dawning. There could be efforts in this direction. Besides, Indian IT respected world over, has a base in Chennai, and neighbouring Andhra, Bangalore. A collaboration here may lead the global competition. China has a great work culture, and India is known for elite innovations. Indians heading Microsoft, Google, Walmart must be playing on the mind of the Chinese for long.\n\nOne of the causes of the automobile slump was excessive production infrastructure. On average, a unit needs to run on 75% capacity to break even. The possible equation could be that instead of having five underperforming units in each country, two centralized units, may absorb the loss of demand, or have a pact of shifting excess inventories in one country to the other and sharing the profits.\n\nForeign policy today, as the PM mentioned in one of his interviews, is all about equitable give and take. With much refrain, the possibility of Chennai Port facilities to the Chinese under a pact may have been one of the topics.\n\nMeandering to the various sequences that come to mind, the backdrop could well have a bearing of the recent Trump-Modi talks, the two mega economies looking (US- China), with mounting deficits on the American side. US sanctions may not nudge away China\u2019s upper hand but may delay or be a setback to China\u2019s expansion through the \u201cone belt\u201d policy. The CPEC is an offshoot of this. China also needs global acceptance here.\n\nMr Khan\u2019s visit to Beijing, a week earlier, may not be as tactical as is analysed and propagated. The over-hyped \u201crock-solid\u201d bonding, \u201cirrespective of circumstances\u201d, appears more like a red herring. Besides, \u201crock-solid\u201d the adjective shows, that the words were phrased elsewhere, or by someone who speaks his countries\u2019 English!\n\nChina\u2019s quest for economical hegemony is an intrinsic part of their culture. They would be keen on the CPEC that cannot be wished away easily, but other amiable avenues to their approach to the world market can be worked out.\n\nIndia certainly would have settled economic and border issues, taking a stride on the path of working out its priorities first.\n\nOn a separate but similar note, a prospering another neighbour, is also in our interest, sans terrorism, and reviving brotherhood, if that be so. Port sharing as it does with Gwadar can only prop up its economy, with added industrial units, and port revenues.\n\nThe baseless, and undying condition of \u201cEither India or Pakistan\u201d, who-ever is spanning it, is so obviously destructive, and gives ammo to radicalism, and global uncertainty of safety to any citizen anywhere.\n\nThere exists a phrase about taking horses to water. Today they are quarantined even from the horse-keeper\u2019s flu, and served water a grade higher than aerated water!\n\nIt is so easy to see that the relentless India-Pakistan acrimony, is a political game. It is time wisdom prevails. Let\u2019s talk of peace, piece by piece! No country has gained, only fell in pre-decided laps, identifying them as true saviours.\n\nModiji has enough knack to keep good terms with China.\n\nThe other neighbour, given in to the army, radicals, probably has its hands tied for a warm shake. Internal strife and rising factionalism, also make any positive gesture to be taken with caution.\n\nAdversity may bring about its uses, or we may continue to perspire senselessly in the heat of unfounded hatred.\n\nThe good news is, that the elephant and dragon have begun to identify each other\u2019s virtues!\n\n\u201cJab ho gaya tarq-e-talluk, to jafaaein kyon hon,\n\nJo yaad nahin aatey who satatey bhi nahin\u201d\n\nDaag\n\n(When bonds are terminated, why should there be complaints,\n\nThose who are lost in memories, should not strain your heart either)", "description": "The event that just got over, was named \u201cinformal\u201d but may appraised later as a major re-aligning juncture in what are supposedly believed to be indelible political lines etched in stone.
