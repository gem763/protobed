REUTERS/Stoyan Nenov\n\nErdogan agreed the truce during talks in Ankara on Thursday with U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence on stemming a humanitarian crisis, which has put 200,000 civilians to flight in northeast Syria, and easing a security scare over thousands of Islamic State captives guarded by the Kurdish YPG militia targeted in Turkey\u2019s assault.\n\nTurkey\u2019s defense ministry said on Saturday there had been 14 \u201cprovocative attacks\u201d from Syria in the past 36 hours but said it was continuing to coordinate closely with the United States to allow the agreement to be implemented.\n\nReuters journalists at the border said bombardment heard near the Syrian border town of Ras al Ain on Friday morning had subsided. They saw just a few Turkish military vehicles crossing the frontier on Saturday morning.\n\nThe truce sets out a five-day pause to let the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) militia pull out of a \u201csafe zone\u201d Turkey has vowed to create in territory extending more than 30 km (about 20 miles) deep into Syria.\n\nAnkara regards the YPG, the SDF\u2019s main Kurdish component, a terrorist group because of its links to Kurdish insurgents operating in southeast Turkey.\n\nTurkey\u2019s defense ministry said Defence Minister Hulusi Akar had urged his U.S. counterpart Mark Esper in a telephone call late on Friday to ensure that YPG forces withdrew from the zone within the 120-hour period agreed under the truce.\n\nErdogan said on Friday the safe zone would run for some 440 km from west to east along the border, though the U.S. special envoy for Syria said the accord covered a smaller area where Turkish forces and their Syrian rebel allies were fighting.\n\nErdogan also said Turkey would set up a dozen observation posts across northeast Syria.\n\n\u201cSTRATEGICALLY BRILLIANT\u201d\n\nThe surprise deal to suspend Turkey\u2019s military offensive against Kurdish-led forces in Syria hinged on Erdogan\u2019s demand that Washington agree a time limit on any ceasefire, a senior Turkish official told Reuters on Friday.\n\nThe deal was aimed at easing a crisis triggered by President Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt decision earlier this month to withdraw all 1,000 U.S. troops from northern Syria. That move was widely criticized in Washington and elsewhere as a betrayal of loyal Kurdish allies who had fought for years alongside U.S. troops against Islamic State.\n\nTrump\u2019s move also means the extent of Turkey\u2019s ambitions in the region is likely to be determined by Russia and Iran, filling the vacuum created by the U.S. retreat.\n\nSyrian President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Moscow and Tehran, has already deployed his forces in territory formerly protected by Washington, invited by the Kurds. Erdogan, who has backed rebels fighting to oust Assad, has said Turkey has no problem with Syrian government forces deploying near the border.\n\nOn Saturday, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry said a delegation of Russian officials had met Assad in Damascus on Friday and discussed with him the need to de-escalate the situation in northeast Syria.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nTrump defended his decision to pull U.S. forces out of Syria as \u201cstrategically brilliant\u201d and said the truce reached with Turkey on Thursday would save millions of lives. Trump later said he held a phone call with Erdogan, adding that the Turkish leader \u201cvery much wants the ceasefire, or pause, to work\u201d.\n\nErdogan will meet Russian President Vladimir Putin next week in Sochi to discuss further steps on the \u201csafe zone\u201d. The two leaders have forged close ties over defense and energy cooperation, as well as efforts to find a political solution in Syria, but Moscow has said the Turkish offensive was \u201cunacceptable\u201d and should be limited.\n\nTurkey says the \u201csafe zone\u201d it plans to create will allow up to 2 million Syrian refugees - roughly half the number it is currently hosting - to settle in Syria, as well as push back the YPG militia from its border with Syria.", "description": "A fragile ceasefire was holding along Turkey's border with Syria on Saturday, two days after President Tayyip Erdogan agreed the truce to allow Kurdish forces time to pull back from Ankara's cross-border assault.", "authors": ["Tuvan Gumrukcu", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191019&t=2&i=1442626988&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9I07X", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
