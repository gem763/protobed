House speaker Nancy Pelosi is demanding the trump administration turn over information about the president's phone call with Ukraine's leader. This as president trump himself peered to admit he talked to Joe Biden -- talked about Joe Biden during that call. My white house partner in crime, Jon Karl is here with us this morning. The big question is did the president pressure a foreign leader to investigate a political rival? Good morning, Cecilia. That is the question but the president as you point out already appears to be acknowledging that he did, in fact, talk to the president of Ukraine about Joe Biden. Pressure or not, that acknowledgement that he spoke to a foreign leader about his political rival is raising serious concerns among Democrats and some key Republicans, as well. Just days after \"The Wall Street journal\" reported that president trump pressured the president of Ukraine to investigate the business dealings of Joe Biden's son hunter, the president now appears to be acknowledging he did, in fact, talk about Biden when I spoke to the Ukrainian president in July. The conversation I had was largely congratulatory. Was largely the fact that we don't want our people like vice president Biden and his son creating the corruption already in the Ukraine. Reporter: At the time of the phone call the trump administration had been holding back $250 million in aid to Ukraine that had been approved by congress. I know when I give pressure and that was not pressure. Reporter: Now speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi is giving the trump administration a deadline of Thursday to turn over the secret whistle-blower complaint that first raised concerns about that phone call. If they don't turn it over, she wrote in a letter to congress, the administration, quote, will be answering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of the investigation. Biden campaigning in Iowa is firing back at the president. I know trump deserves to be investigated. He is violating every basic norm of a president. You should be asking him the question, why is he on the phone with a foreign leader trying to intimidate a foreign leader if that's what happened. That appear what is happened. You should be looking at trump. For the most part criticism of the president's actions here has come from Democrats but there is one key exception, senator Mitt Romney is now saying that if the president asked or pressured Ukraine's president to investigate a political rival, quote, it would be troubling in the extreme. Meanwhile, George, the president is on the world stage all week here in New York at the U.N. General assembly. You saw Nancy Pelosi's ultimatum and the president said he was opening to releasing the transcript of this call. Any indication the white house will follow through on that or the whistle-blower complaint? The white house has talked about -- the white house aides have talked about possibly releasing the transcript for the complaint but I'll tell you, the fact that Pelosi herself is demanding this may set it back. This president, this white house has repeatedly stonewalled congress over and over again and just yesterday you heard from both the secretary of treasury and the secretary of state that it's unlikely that they'll release that transcript. Let's take that to congress and Mary Bruce has more.\n\nThis transcript has been automatically generated and may not be 100% accurate.", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is demanding the Trump administration turn over information about the president's phone call after a whistleblower complaint.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/190923_gma_karl2_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
