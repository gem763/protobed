Gen. Laura Richardson, commander of US Army North, said on Monday.\n\nThose troops will be a combination of National Guard and active-duty service members, Richardson told reporters during the Association of the United States Army's annual exposition in Washington, DC.\n\nRichardson said she did not have an estimate for how much the deployments to the border will cost through the end of next September. Once Congress passes a fiscal 2020 defense spending bill, the Pentagon will foot the bill for the continuing border mission.\n\nUS troops began deploying to the border last October after President Donald Trump claimed without evidence that a human caravan of Central American asylum seekers contained hundreds of criminals, who wanted to invade the United States.\n\nUS soldiers string razor wire near the port of entry at the US-Mexico border in Donna, Texas, November 4, 2018.

Jeffrey Buchanan indicated that the military's mission at the US-Mexico border could be over by Christmas, but it has been extended since then.\n\nStopping immigrants and asylum seekers from entering the United States has been a major priority for the president, who reportedly wanted a snake-filled moat dug along the southern border. Trump has denied wanting such a moat.\n\nBut on November 1, 2018, the president told reporters that he wanted US troops to respond to any asylum seekers who threw rocks at them as if they were under fire.\n\n\"We will consider that the maximum that we can consider that, because they're throwing rocks viciously and violently,\" Trump said. \"You saw that three days ago \u2014 really hurting the military. We're not going to put up with that. They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back. We're going to consider it \u2014 I told them: Consider it a rifle. When they throw rocks like they did at the Mexico military and police, I said: Consider it a rifle.\"\n\nLater that month, then-Defense Secretary James Mattis assured reporters that US troops assisting the border patrol would not be armed. When Task & Purpose asked Mattis what steps the Pentagon was taking to make sure active-duty troops did not shoot anyone \u2014 as happened in 1997 \u2014 Mattis was dismissive.\n\n\"I'm not going to dignify that,\" Mattis said on November 21. \"They're not even carrying guns for Christ's sake.\"", "description": "The US military's year-old mission supporting civil authorities along the US-Mexico border will last at least another year.", "authors": ["Jeff Schogol", "Task"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da4d30ccc4a0a32db00b0d3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
