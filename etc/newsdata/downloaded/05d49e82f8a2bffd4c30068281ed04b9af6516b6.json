REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nBut some Democrats fear that a costly distraction may be the looming battle between the Republican Trump and Congress over funding the government when money runs out for many federal operations on Nov. 21, Democratic aides said.\n\nSome Democratic lawmakers said they believed they already had gathered enough evidence from the testimony of current and former U.S. officials to impeach Trump for asking Ukraine to investigate a political rival, Joe Biden, a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.\n\nOther Democrats were more cautious and said more information was needed to solidify the case for impeachment and make it an easier sell to a deeply polarized American public. Only two U.S. presidents have been formally impeached by the House of Representatives, and both were later acquitted by the Senate.\n\nVal Demings, a Democratic lawmaker who sits on the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees, said congressional investigators should be able to wrap up their inquiry by December.\n\n\u201cWe need to be thorough, we need to be methodical, but we need to be timely,\u201d she told Reuters.\n\nThree Democratic congressional sources said there had been talk among some Democrats about trying to wrap up hearings and hold an impeachment vote by the Nov. 28 Thanksgiving holiday, but this appeared highly unlikely as of Wednesday.\n\nCongressional investigators still have many witnesses to interview, they said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we should short-circuit this because of an artificial deadline,\u201d said Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Democrat on the Intelligence and Oversight committees. \u201cThat being said, we are working pretty quickly. It\u2019s only the fourth week and look at all we have learned so far.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, who control the House, are concerned not only with building the best possible case for the Republican-controlled Senate, which will hear the charges, but also for the American public, who face the possibility of an American president standing trial while running for re-election.\n\n\u201cThere is time when enough will be enough, but I think the more we build the case, the more likely we will get bipartisan support,\u201d said Representative Jackie Speier, a Democrat on the House Intelligence and Oversight committees. \u201cOnce it becomes overwhelming, how can you ignore it?\u201d\n\nNEW DAY, NEW EVIDENCE\n\nThe picture that has emerged from the testimony of U.S. officials, texts between U.S. diplomats, and other official documents is of a president who sought to pressure Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to investigate Biden and his businessman son, Hunter Biden, who was a non-executive board member of a Ukrainian gas company.\n\nThe impeachment inquiry was sparked by a whistleblower complaint from an intelligence official who expressed concern about a July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelenskiy in which the U.S. president pushed his counterpart for an investigation. The White House later released a rough transcript of that call.\n\nText messages and testimony from current and former State Department officials and comments from the president\u2019s chief of staff show that a meeting between Trump and Zelenskiy, along with military aid for Ukraine, were contingent on the Ukrainian president launching the investigation.\n\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing, and in a stream of daily tweets and public statements has accused Democrats of seeking to unconstitutionally oust him from office as he seeks to run for a second term in the November 2020 election.\n\n\u201cMy view is that we have more than sufficient evidence to move forward on impeachment,\u201d said Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat on both the Foreign Affairs and Judiciary committees, but added: \u201cEvery day we learn new evidence and hear from new witnesses.\u201d\n\nA key constituency that Democrats need to win over are independent voters who appear to have limited patience for a protracted investigation.\n\nWhile 45% of independents think Trump should be impeached, many of them do not appear to want another lengthy investigation that sucks up all of the energy out of Washington. According to an Oct. 18-22 Reuters/Ipsos poll, 54% of independents agreed that \u201cCongress should focus on fixing important problems facing Americans, rather than focusing on investigating President Trump.\u201d\n\n`LASER FOCUSED\u2019\n\nRepresentative Eric Swalwell, a Democrat on the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees, said the impeachment inquiry was \u201claser focused\u201d on Ukraine and was not looking at any other accusations against the president.\n\nSome lawmakers interviewed said the evidence gathered so far supported charging Trump with abuse of power and also obstruction for seeking, mostly unsuccessfully, to block key officials from testifying and withholding documents.\n\n\u201cI think consensus is developing that the president abused the power of his office, has obstructed Congress,\u201d Cicilline said.\n\nAs House Democrats debate if and when to impeach Trump, it is taking place against the backdrop of a possible showdown with the president in the coming weeks over funding the government.\n\nTrump signed a stopgap measure in September to keep the government open through to Nov. 21. The president has been at loggerheads with Congress over a dozen bills to fund most government activities, a standoff fuelled in part by Trump\u2019s demand for $12 billion in fiscal 2020 to fulfill a key election promise - building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe government was partially shut down for a record 35 days stretching from December 2018 through January in a dispute with Democrats over border wall funding.\n\n\u201cThe concern is that if we vote on impeachment before December, Trump will refuse to sign the funding bills and shut down the government,\u201d a Democratic congressional aide said.", "description": "Democratic lawmakers hope to complete their impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump by year's end and are coalescing around two articles of impeachment - abuse of power and obstruction, lawmakers and aides told Reuters.", "authors": ["Susan Cornwell", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444345960&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9M1YJ", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
