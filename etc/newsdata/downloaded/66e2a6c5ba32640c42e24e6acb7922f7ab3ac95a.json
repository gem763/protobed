He initially directed 2,000 American troops to leave the war-torn country in December, but later backtracked and approved a more gradual withdrawal.\n\nThe senior official told the Times that the troops would likely be stationed along the Iraqi border with Syria, away from the cease-fire zone negotiated with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nAt least one of the newly-relocated soldiers aired his disagreement with the pullout on Sunday by showing off a badge in support of YPJ, the all female counterpart to the Kurdish-led People's Protection Units (YPG) militia.\n\nAmerican soldiers were reprimanded for wearing YPJ and YPG patches in the spring of 2016 after Turkish officials branded them 'unacceptable'.\n\n'Wearing an insignia of a terrorist organization by US soldiers, who are our ally and are assertive about fighting against terrorism, is unacceptable,' Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said at the time.\n\nA senior official in the Trump administration told the New York Times that the president is leaning in favor of a new Pentagon plan that would keep a small group of American troops in eastern Syria to combat the Islamic State\n\nAt least one of the newly-relocated soldiers aired his disagreement with the pullout on Sunday by showing off a badge in support of YPJ, the all female counterpart to the Kurdish-led People's Protection Units (YPG) militia. American soldiers were reprimanded for wearing YPJ and YPG patches in the spring of 2016 after Turkish officials branded them 'unacceptable'\n\nMedia reported the US troops started their withdrawal from north Syria towards Iraq according to agreement between US and Turkey\n\nIn the face of fierce criticism, coalition spokesman Army Col Steve Warren announced that wearing the patches was 'unauthorized and it was inappropriate and corrective action has been taken'.\n\nWarren explained that it was common practice to wear patches supporting military groups they were working with on the ground.\n\n'[T]he special forces community has a long and proud history of wearing such patches when they are partnering with forces around the world, and you'll see examples of that in Afghanistan, in Iraq, in Latin America and all over the world where these special forces personnel train and conduct, you know, foreign internal defense type operations,' Warren said.\n\n'This is something that they often do, and it's an effort to, you know, just kind of connect with those that they're training.'\n\nYPJ has vowed to continue its fight against invading Turkish forces after the American retreat as air strikes have battered the vulnerable region.\n\nThe US troops that were pulled out of Sarrin - which served as the largest military base in northern Syria - over the weekend are headed to western Iraq, where they will continue to conduct operations against ISIS, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Saturday.\n\nSpeaking to reporters traveling with him to the Middle East, Esper did not rule out the idea that US forces would conduct counterterrorism missions from Iraq into Syria. He said those details will be worked out over time.\n\nHis comments were the first to specifically lay out where American troops will go as they leave Syria and what the counter-ISIS fight could look like.\n\nThe developments made clear that one of President Trump's rationales for withdrawing troops from Syria was not going to come to pass any time soon.\n\n'It's time to bring our soldiers back home,' he said Wednesday.\n\nBut they are not coming home.\n\nEsper said he has spoken to his Iraqi counterpart about the plan to shift the more than 700 troops leaving Syria into western Iraq, where they will have two missions.\n\n'One is to help defend Iraq and two is to perform a counter-ISIS mission as we sort through the next steps,' he said.\n\n'Things could change between now and whenever we complete the withdrawal, but that's the game plan right now.'\n\nThe US currently has more than 5,000 American forces in Iraq, under an agreement between the two countries.\n\nThe US pulled its troops out of Iraq in 2011 when combat operations there ended, but they went back in after the Islamic State group began to take over large swaths of the country in 2014.\n\nThe number of American forces in Iraq has remained small due to political sensitivities in the country, after years of what some Iraqis consider US occupation during the war that began in 2003.\n\n6 A convoy of US troops arrives back from northeastern of Syria, in Duhok, Kurdistan region, Iraq\n\nEsper said he will talk with other allies at a NATO meeting in the coming week to discuss the way ahead for the counter-IS mission.\n\nAsked if US special operations forces will conduct unilateral military operations into Syria to go after IS, Esper said that is an option that will be discussed with allies over time.\n\nHe said one of his top concerns is what the next phase of the counter-IS missions looks like, 'but we have to work through those details.'\n\nHe said that if US forces do go in, they would be protected by American aircraft.\n\nWhile he acknowledged reports of intermittent fighting despite the cease-fire agreement, he said that overall it 'generally seems to be holding. We see a stability of the lines, if you will, on the ground'.", "description": "More than 1,000 US troops withdrew into Iraq early on Monday, ordered by President Trump to vacate northeastern Syria -making Turkey's recent offensive against Kurdish fighters possible.", "authors": ["Ryan Fahey For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/11/19986738-0-image-a-43_1571654510599.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
