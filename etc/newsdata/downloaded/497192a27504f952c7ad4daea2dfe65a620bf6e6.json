Yes, I made that up as a fancy way of saying languages. I\u2019m part Danish, so I know the meaning of a sentence like \u2018de der er dyre dyr\u2019 and that \u00e6, \u00f8, and \u00e5 are real letters. The latter two are also words, meaning \u2018island\u2019 and \u2018stream\u2019 respectively.\n\nAs for the sentence, Google Translate, which has been thrown to the wolves like this before, would say it means \u2018those who are expensive animals.\u2019 That is an accurate translation but not what the sentence means. It means \u2018those are expensive animals.\u2019 Pretty good going really, seeing as \u2018dyr\u2019 can mean both \u2018animal\u2019 and \u2018expensive.\u2019\n\nApart from letting me connect with my Viking side, the above is hopefully an illustration of how languages are confusing things that require both codification and de-codification. The same applies to translations between computer languages (code) and human languages (\u2018fuzzy\u2019 code).", "description": "", "authors": ["Marc Prosser", "Singularityhub.Com How-A-Mysterious-Manuscript-Keeps-Confounding-Ai"], "top_image": ""}
