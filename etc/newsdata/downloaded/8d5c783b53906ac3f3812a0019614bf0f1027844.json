No warning dispersal warning was issued and one reporter ended up in the hospital with a hand injury.\n\nOther journalists and news photographers were shoved by officers during the tense confrontation.\n\nWhat happened was quickly condemned by the Hong Kong Journalist Association.\n\n\u201cSince the outbreak of a series of demonstrations in June, police officers have been out of control\u2026police not only obstructed reporter interviews, but kept on flashing strong light to obstruct filming, unjustifiably drove journalists, verbally abused journalists, besieged journalists, and even carried out violence against journalists,\u201d The group wrote in a translated statement on Facebook. \u201cThis Council has issued a number of statements requiring police to avoid malicious tactics against journalists, but so far, there has been no improvement, and the situation is even more serious. This Council will once again make a serious statement to the chief executive, Mrs Lam Cheng-Ngor, and the commissioner of police, Lu Wei-Cong, urging the government and the police department to face up on the abuse of power and force by police officers, and never turn a blind eye and let the situation continue to deteriorate.\u201d\n\nThere does not appear to be an end in sight to the decaying conditions in Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong police gave a rather weak defense towards their conduct: officers didn\u2019t recognize the fact that those who carried cameras, held microphones, and wore reflector vests and helmet labeled \u201cpress\u201d were actual journalists. Via Hong Kong Free Press:\n\nAt their daily press briefing on Tuesday, Chief Superintendent John Tse from the Police Public Relations Branch said that pepper spray was used because officers were surrounded and attacked. There were many people wearing reflective vests at the time, and it was hard to tell who was a real reporter, he said, adding that police had seized falsified press credentials in the past. As for the Now TV cameraman being pushed, Tse said the victim had already made a complaint so he could not comment on the case.\n\nIt should be pointed out that at no time in the video are officers attacked or even threatened. Video of what happened showed more of a loose throng of reporters with some civilians watching from the edge, instead of one filled with chaos. The pushing, pepper-spraying, and beating of journalists cannot be justified especially in an area where the press is partly-free. This incident involving police and reporters will do nothing to encourage press freedom.\n\nThe situation in Hong Kong is dire and will more than likely stay dire for quite some time. What Hongkongers are doing is fighting for freedom. The ability to cast aside any shackles brought on by a communist regime which has dabbled in freer markets but still seeks to control how its citizens behave through the power of the government.\n\nJournalists are attempting to tell the story of this unique time in history regardless of whether they\u2019re with some sort of \u2018official\u2019 outlet or working as a citizen journalist. There is no reason for the government to tamp down on this activity unless they\u2019re worried the protesters might win. The fact media outlets connected to the Chinese government are attempting to portray the protesters as some sort of fringe element suggests Beijing is concerned a complete revolution might break out.\n\nThis is why people should be disturbed by the attacks on journalists in Hong Kong. The truth is in the streets. The fact Beijing and Hong Kong police appear to not want the story told implies rot has completely settled inside Hong Kong\u2019s government offices.", "description": "Watchdog: Police are \"out of control.\"", "authors": ["Taylor Millard", "John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Andrew Malcolm"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/HKcoppepperspray.jpg"}
