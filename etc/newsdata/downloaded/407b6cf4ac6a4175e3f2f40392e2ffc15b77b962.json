Living in Texas, which this is like normal in Texas, so it helped me a lot when I practice with this kind of wind on the range.\u201d\n\nThe South Korean player won the Ladies Scottish Open last month for her third LPGA Tour victory.\n\nSakura Yokomine of Japan was second, following an opening 65 with a 70.\n\n\u201cIt was super windy today compared to yesterday, but I was managing to be able to shoot under par, so I was happy,\u201d Yokomine said.\n\nMarina Alex, coming off the United States\u2019 Solheim Cup loss to Europe, was 7 under with Puerto Rico\u2019s Maria Torres. Alex had a 71, and Torres shot 68.\n\n\u201cConditions were crazy, so much different than yesterday,\u201d Alex said. \u201cTon of wind from the start to finish. Some tough hole locations out there, too, with just the wind direction and how you were trying to get to the hole.\u201d\n\nKendall Dye (69), Amy Olson (72), Tiffany Chan (65) and Pornanong Phatlum (72) were 6 under.\n\nHur birdied three of the first seven holes, then dropped strokes on the par-4 eighth and ninth. She rebounded with birdies on Nos. 10, 12 and 14, but gave two strokes back with the double bogey on the par-4 16th.\n\n\u201cYou have to forget about the bogeys,\u201d Hur said. I\u2019m just trying to focus on every shot and putt.\u201d\n\nThe 29-year-old Hur was 12 when she first met close friend Yokomine.\n\n\u201cJust having fun with her on the course, Hur said.\n\nYokomine and Torres are winless on the LPGA Tour.\n\n\u201cOne shot at a time,\u201d Torres said. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to work on being present on the shots. Now I have to keep it up for four rounds, just trying to hit every single shot with the information that we have.\u201d\n\nDefending champion Sung Hyun Park and 2017 winner Lexi Thompson missed the cut. Park followed an opening 70 with a 77. Thompson, winless at the Solheim Cup, shot 76-71.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Mi Jung Hur shot a 2-under 70 in windy conditions Friday to take a two-stroke lead into the weekend at the Indy Women in Tech Championship.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
