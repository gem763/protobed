The chemist suggested using a special shampoo, but so far it has not helped for more than one or two hours after washing. I am 79.\n\nArchibald Law, Glasgow\n\nThe likely diagnosis is seborrhoeic dermatitis at an early stage. If the condition progresses, you may observe redness and scaling across the scalp \u2014 known as dandruff.\n\nThe root cause is unknown, but it is thought that a reaction between the skin and a yeast that can grow there produces toxic substances that irritate the scalp.\n\nA shampoo containing coal tar, which acts as an anti-fungal and reduces the yeast in the superficial layers of the skin, allowing the inflammation to settle\n\nStress, fatigue, alterations in general health \u2014 even seasonal changes can play a role.\n\nSeborrhoeic dermatitis affects up to 5 per cent of the UK population, is slightly more common in men and, while it may come and go throughout life, it\u2019s definitely more common in your age group.\n\nWRITE TO DR SCURR Write to Dr Scurr at Good Health, Daily Mail, 2 Derry Street, London W8 5TT or email drmartin@dailymail.co.uk \u2014 include contact details. Dr Scurr cannot enter into personal correspondence. Replies should be taken in a general context. Always consult your own GP with any health worries.\n\nYour local chemist wisely recommended a shampoo containing coal tar, which acts as an antifungal and reduces the yeast in the superficial layers of the skin, allowing the inflammation to settle.\n\nIf, after two or three months of this twice-weekly treatment, you are still plagued by itching, I would suggest you try a different shampoo that contains other antifungals.\n\nOne example is Sachajuan scalp shampoo, which has three suitable ingredients: piroctone olamine, climbazole, and salicylic acid.\n\nThis must be used twice weekly for the first month, and then once weekly thereafter. You should discuss this option with your chemist.\n\nIn my view... Gut bacteria can make us run faster\n\nReaders of this page will be aware of my optimism about the health benefits we can expect to result from studies into gut microbes: the newly discovered world of the microbiota.\n\nWe have become aware that the multitude of bacteria and organisms that live in our intestines have a significant role to play, and a study published this summer found that marathon runners have a far greater quantity of one type of bacterium in their guts than a control group of couch potatoes.\n\nThe study also found that populations of the bacterium, Veillonella atypica, increase in both fit and sedentary people after they exercise\n\nThe study also found that populations of the bacterium, Veillonella atypica, increase in both fit and sedentary people after they exercise.\n\nTransplanting this bacterium into the guts of mice allowed them to exercise for longer than other mice without the same microbes.\n\nI can see a time when there will be more frequent sub-two-hour marathons, or more runners achieving the Holy Grail of a sub-four-minute mile, significantly helped through influencing the gut.\n\nFor the non-athletes among us, this is just more proof that there is always a good reason to exercise \u2014 and also to eat fermented foods and fibre, both prebiotics on which good bacteria can thrive.", "description": "ASK THE GP: For four months I have been suffering from an itchy scalp.
