Beijing has held out the Hong Kong arrangement of special autonomy within a united China as a model.\n\nBut Hong Kong's protests have been fueled by resentment of what many residents see as relentless efforts by Beijing to exert control over their city, despite the promises of autonomy.\n\nHong Kong is still recovering from a long weekend of violent clashes between police and tens of thousands of protesters.\n\nScores of shops remain boarded up after being trashed or torched, anti-government graffiti is scrawled over bus stops and buildings, and some streets are still strewn with broken glass and twisted metal debris.\n\nProtest violence has often targeted the MTR mass transit system, torching stations and damaging ticketing machines. The MTR has been accused of closing stations at the government's behest to stop demonstrators gathering.\n\nA slew of events and conferences have moved to other locations, including Singapore.\n\nHong Kong's unrest has started to impact global companies and sport, with luxury jeweler Tiffany & Co and U.S. sports brand Vans withdrawing an advertisement and shoe design seen as favoring protesters.\n\nChina has canceled broadcasting NBA basketball games after an executive of the U.S. National Basketball Association (NBA) team the Houston Rockets back protesters in a tweet. Chinese sponsors and partners have cut ties with the NBA.\n\nThe NBA's business in China is worth more than $4 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nChina has warned foreign governments to stay out of the protests which they deem as an internal affair and have accused some, including Britain and the United States, of fanning anti-China sentiment.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Jessie Pang; Additional reporting by Yimou Lee in Taipei and Stephen Nellis in San Francisco; Writing by Farah Master; Editing by Paul Tait, Robert Birsel)", "description": "Hong Kong protesters prepared for demonstrations around the city on Thursday as shopping malls said they would close early to avoid becoming targets and the city's metro, which has borne the brunt of the violent unrest, will close three hours early.
