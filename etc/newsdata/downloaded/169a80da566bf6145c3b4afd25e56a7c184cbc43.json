It is thus hard to imagine that the U.S. economy will be growing above potential next year.\u201d", "description": "Investors may be accepting too little compensation on U.S. corporate bonds given growing concerns about the debt binge and recent red flags in the market.", "authors": ["Joy Wiltermuth", "Sunny Oh", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT645_Cautio_ZG_20191018171803.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
