Shanghai, with a population of 24 million, faces a similar fate three decades from now.\n\nThe scale of human movement will be unrivaled in history, Dina Ionesco of the International Organization for Migration told The New York Times.\n\n\"We've been trying to ring the alarm bells, we know that it's coming,\" she said.\n\nEgypt's Alexandria and Basra, the second-largest city in Iraq, will be mostly underwater by 2050, the study said.\n\nSouthern Vietnam - with more than 20 million people - may become entirely flooded.\n\nThe study suggested nations must begin preparing now for millions of citizens to relocate internally.\n\n\"As shocking as these findings might be, there is a silver lining,\" said Climate Central's director of communications Peter Girard.\n\n\"They give us the knowledge we need to take action in time to protect millions, and to avoid the economic and political upheaval that a climate disaster on this scale could bring.\"", "description": "Coastal cities such as India's Mumbai, China's Shanghai, and Thailand's Bangkok could be submerged in three decades.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/9/5/4e850fa27585452e8f438dcc84441cae_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
