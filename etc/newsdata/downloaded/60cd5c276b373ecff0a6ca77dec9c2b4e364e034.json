The property is one hour from Washington, D.C., and 40 minutes from Baltimore by car.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a perfect location for anyone who wants to have a nice geta-way with hunting and fishing,\u201d said Don Heasley, the listing agent of the Bob Lucido team at Keller Williams Integrity. \u201cIt\u2019s also accessible to the cities. You\u2019ve got the best of both worlds out here,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nSitting on a 350-acre farm, both houses share a breezy view of the Maryland countryside: acres of rolling hills, large crop fields and open pastures.\n\n\n\nMore: Mexico-Based Developer: Luxury is About Privacy and Low Density\n\nThe 23,000-square-foot main house (with about 3,400 square feet of unfinished space in the basement) offers the charm and character of a countryside mansion. \u201cIt gives people a warm and inviting feeling, perfect for a large family,\u201d Mr. Heasley said.\n\n\n\nWith its high ceiling and wooden paneling, the house comes with nine bedrooms, eight fireplaces, an indoor basketball court, a built-in pool and a patio.\n\n\n\nAbout 300-yards away sits the 3,740-square-foot brick farmhouse, which was built in 1870. It is decorated with numerous hunting achievements and has four bedrooms and a large front porch.\n\n\n\nMore: Trump Elector Asks $44.5 Million for Mansion Near Mar-a-Lago\n\nThe main house was never listed, said Mr. Heasley. But it could not be determined if the farmhouse was ever on the market.\n\n\n\nMyriad amenities can be found around the property. There is a large pond, 12 hunting stands, two barns, a tractor shed and a pole barn.\n\nThe farm and two houses were purchased by the owners in 2003 for $1.5 million, according to property records. Mr. Heasley did not disclose the owners but said that the main house was the family\u2019s residence for around a decade.\n\nAs for the coming auction, \u201cIt could be two very different buyers, but we will be happy to sell them to the same owner,\u201d Mr. Heasley said.\n\nFrom Penta: China Boasts 27,000 Individuals With a Net Worth Above US$30 Million", "description": "", "authors": ["Yaling Jiang"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-122277?width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
