But when my friends back home started saving up or making investments to plan for their weddings, first houses or kids, I started wondering if and how I should financially prepare for my own future as a woman living outside of my home country.\n\nMaking plans when there are so many unknowns and complexities around living internationally felt like a gamble. How could I manage investments when I have savings in multiple currencies? What would happen if I made investments in Japan but decided to move to another country? How could I make the best decisions when I didn\u2019t understand how laws and taxes even worked here?\n\nI started wondering if and how I should financially prepare for my own future as a woman living outside of my home country.\n\nAll of these questions were swarming in my mind and I found myself trying to do research on my own\u2014and promptly giving up.\n\nAnd it seems I\u2019m not alone. When I posted on my social media asking other women and men if they had ever done any kind of financial planning, many people replied with similar concerns. \u201cHow should they maximize their retirement savings if they\u2019re not planning to take the Japanese pension?\u201d, \u201cShould they invest in Japanese real estate while here?\u201d, \u201cIsn\u2019t investment risky?\u201d they commented.\n\nA financial planning firm designed for foreign residents\n\nI sat down with Argentum Wealth, a financial planning and advisory firm for the foreign community in Japan, to find out what we can do to take control over our financial future as foreign residents.\n\nArgentum Wealth is based in Minato-ku, just a few minutes\u2019 walk from Tokyo Tower. They are the largest locally licensed firm in Japan focusing on the expat community. The company was founded in 2007 by Lloyd Danon and Martin Zotta, two financial advisors who each have 20 years of experience serving the international community. They advise and manage a wide range of areas, from general financial planning to investments, private pensions, insurance, and real estate.\n\nOf course, both Zotta and Danon agree that there are tons of ways that you can benefit from having a financial planner but here we\u2019ve whittled it down to the top five.\n\n1. You can maximize your money wherever you are in the world\n\nIf you\u2019re worried about having to move your investments when life takes you to another country, it doesn\u2019t have to be that complicated. You can establish investment accounts that are based internationally, which means you can move from one location to the next without having to constantly move your investment accounts. Argentum Wealth designs portfolios for people who are mobile, allowing clients to access their portfolio from anywhere.\n\nThis means that you don\u2019t have to worry about having an exit strategy with your investments if and when you decide to leave Japan. Argentum Wealth works with multiple currencies, so you can easily make international investments even if you have savings and income in different currencies.\n\nArgentum Wealth has decades of experience working with international clients, they have access to examples of what other people have done in your situation to help guide you in decision making.\n\n\u201cIn many cases, our clients will rotate through Tokyo. Once accounts have been set up, they can be managed and accessed from any country in the world. A lot of our clients are living back home or in another country following their careers and we continue to help maintain their investments,\u201d says Danon.\n\nYou don\u2019t even have to find a new financial planner if you move. Argentum Wealth continues to manage clients through Skype, telephone, and email, so the quality and range of services can be maintained even if you are abroad. The only thing that changes is what time you set up your meeting based on your new time zone.\n\n2. You can build your own knowledge of financial options in Japan and beyond\n\nThere are a few reasons why foreigners do not make local investments in Japan but one of the major ones is the many banks will turn you away if you can\u2019t read and write Japanese. Language and cultural barriers can make investing your money feel like a leap in the dark.\n\nIf you\u2019re not sure how the tax system works in Japan, whether or not you should invest in local assets or if your money is better off in investment abroad, then speaking with professionals can help you confidently make the right choices based on your situation.\n\n\u201cWe work together with trusted local partners that specialize in offering services in English to make it very easy for foreign clients to acquire investments like properties, and then have them managed,\u201d says Zotta.\n\nNote: If you are a US National, they also assist with pension transfers and 401Ks.\n\n\u201cWe are one of the only firms with access to onshore US solutions for Japan residents,\u201d adds Danon.\n\n3. You\u2019ll have access to a wider variety of options for where to invest your money\n\nEach stage of life comes with a new set of investments to consider. Argentum Wealth can help you with a wide range of strategies from retirement planning, children\u2019s education, lump sum, regular savings, portfolio management, life insurance, health insurance, inheritance, and tax planning, so they can meet you where you\u2019re at when you\u2019re ready.\n\nThey also have a property management side that covers everything from single units, houses, multi-units, and apartment buildings. This also includes mortgages, loans, property management, and managing rents.\n\nMost of the international women in Japan who have worked with Argentum Wealth have decided that they want to be financially independent regardless of whether they are with or without a partner.\n\n\u201cNormally when a foreigner purchases an investment property, they might not get hands-on with management. An estate agent or management company will manage all of the billings and mortgage payments and pay the owner what is left at the end of the month,\u201d says Danon.\n\nArgentum Wealth will oversee your assets and make sure that they\u2019re offering the right return.\n\n4. You can invest independently from your partner\n\nMost of the international women in Japan who have worked with Argentum Wealth have decided that they want to be financially independent regardless of whether they are with or without a partner. For some women, the income stream might change during their life due to having kids. However, while their considerations might vary, their basic financial needs and goals are not so much different from men\u2019s.\n\n\u201cWe do a financial review to look at assets or objectives and each situation is case by case. Every client is different, and so the planning has to suit them. For example, some couples want all the financial planning and investments done together, while others feel more comfortable keeping everything separate and confidential.\u201d says Zotta.\n\n5. You can start wherever you\u2019re at\n\nThere isn\u2019t a minimum budget required to getting started. While many people have the perception that you need to be rich to have a financial planner, Argentum Wealth has a range of solutions for people who are just starting out as well as for people who have accumulated wealth and are looking to reinvest or to place that wealth somewhere more efficiently.\n\n\u201cYou can start with a simple, monthly investment plan. There is something for everyone,\u201d says Zotta.\n\n\u201cYou can start with a simple, monthly investment plan. There is something for everyone,\u201d says Zotta.\n\nThere\u2019s no handbook to being a foreign resident in Japan, which is why it can be hard sometimes to assess where you\u2019re at in your life and how to make decisions about your money. Since Argentum Wealth has decades of experience working with international clients, they have access to examples of what other people have done in your situation to help guide you in decision making.\n\n\u201cWe learn a lot from our clients, and are in a position to pass on that valuable knowledge to our client base,\u201d says Zotta.\n\nHow can I get started with a financial planner?\n\nIf you\u2019re new to working with a financial planner, the first step is to have a conversation. You can do a complete financial review with Argentum Wealth and share your goals and priorities, and they will conduct a follow-up meeting with you to share solutions and recommendations. Even if you don\u2019t have an idea of what you want to do before you speak with them, a simple conversation can open your mind to options.\n\nMy biggest takeaway from our interview was this: As international residents, we might feel hesitant about creating a plan when we don\u2019t know exactly how our lives will pan out. But if you think about it, life planning\u2014marriage, divorce, kids and so on\u2014is never certain, even for people who haven\u2019t ever left their home country.\n\nHaving a financial planner will help you make the best decisions for what to with your hard-earned cash and how to ensure a secure future. That sounds like a sure bet to me.", "description": "", "authors": ["Chiara Terzuolo", "Cheryl White", "Hilary Keyes"], "top_image": "https://savvytokyo.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/app/uploads/2019/10/Argentum-Wealth-Financial-Advisement.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
