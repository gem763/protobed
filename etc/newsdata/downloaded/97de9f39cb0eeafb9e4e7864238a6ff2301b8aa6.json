I fear impeachment will lose much of its moral stigma and political force if it ends up coming down to a party-line vote. But that\u2019s pretty much what\u2019s most likely to happen if it comes to a vote, unless there\u2019s some new damning disclosure. And impeachment in the House will definitely not lead to conviction in the Senate, unless shrimps whistle, pigs fly and at least 20 Republicans vote with the Democrats to obtain a two-thirds majority.\n\nGail: The House should do what the House should do, and let those Senators from swing states answer for it next year. Four?\n\nBret: Well, and here\u2019s my main point: Impeachment will wind up helping Trump. Many Americans will wonder why a lawfully elected president should be removed from office for no violation of the law. They\u2019ll say it was just a matter of Trump being Trump. They\u2019ll ask why Nancy Pelosi didn\u2019t wait for a transcript of the phone call or testimony from key officials before beginning the impeachment process. They\u2019ll wonder how that process will do to help them in their life. And some of them, including some swing voters, may come to see Trump as a victim of elite liberals and \u201cdeep state\u201d agents who, they\u2019ll say, are motivated more by their hatred for Trump than for their concern for the country.\n\nAll that being said, I\u2019m not at all sure I\u2019m right about any of this. Too many friends whose opinions I deeply respect are on your side of the argument. So if I can add a fifth point, it\u2019s that I\u2019m persuadable. I suspect plenty of others might be, too.\n\nGail: Five kinda works for me, too. But if I\u2019m Pelosi, I cannot see just sitting back and letting this all slide. Let the House do its work. Investigations will continue. God knows what new discoveries they\u2019ll make. Just keep the pressure on.\n\nBret: One question that obviously needs answering is what motivated Trump to delay the $400 million or so in aid to Ukraine before that phone call. Arguably, that\u2019s a violation of the 1974 presidential impoundment act, though Trump eventually relented to congressional pressure and released the money. And I\u2019d like to know how Rudy Giuliani became our shadow secretary of state, which is kind of like letting Chris Farley from Saturday Night Live play the understudy to Slim Pickens in \u201cDr. Strangelove\u201d (rest both their souls).", "description": "The prospect of impeachment has certainly \u201clet Trump be Trump.\u201d", "authors": ["Gail Collins", "Bret Stephens"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/01/opinion/01Conversation/01Conversation-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
