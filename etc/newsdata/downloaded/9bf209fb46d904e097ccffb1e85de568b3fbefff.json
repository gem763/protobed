So many, in fact, that our \"too good to be true\" skepticism kicks in. Stop cancer? Lose weight? Relieve arthritis? Whiten teeth? So, let\u2019s take a closer look at what's real and what's hype. Let's start by broadly categorizing ACV's three types of claimed benefit:\n\nProtective/preventive benefits help keep you free of disease\n\nbenefits help keep you free of disease Curative/medical benefits fix you up when you're in poor health\n\nbenefits fix you up when you're in poor health Curative/cosmetic benefits improve your appearance\n\nI approve of ACV only in its raw, organic, unfiltered, and unpasteurized form, with the cloudy \"mother\" visible in the bottle\n\nIf there's no hard proof of any given claim, that doesn't mean it's untrue\u2014there are lots of folks behind centuries of folk wisdom\n\nHow ACV works\n\nPotassium\n\nCalcium\n\nMagnesium\n\nChlorine\n\nCopper\n\nIron\n\nFluorine\n\nAcetic acid\n\nSodium\n\nTrace minerals\n\nAmino acids\n\nFiber from apple pectin\n\nAn abundance of vitamin C\n\nVitamins A, B1, B2, B6, and E\n\nIt's no surprise that nearly every ACV health claim has been labeled a myth or a scam by someone, somewhere. I'm sure Big Pharma plays a role in keeping skeptics well fed with doubts. In the case of ACV, there's a mountain of anecdotal evidence I'm more than fine with. It's the inescapable fact that millions of people, over thousands of years, all over the world, say the same thing about ACV. It works. In lots of ways. So let's learn more about it. Then I'll put my seal of approval on some of the most common ACV claims in each category. Too many to do them all. Ground rules:So, let\u2019s dive in\u2026ACV contains more than 90 different nutrients, including:But wait, there's more:\n\nPreventive/protective claims\n\nAnti-cancer and cardiovascular diseases\n\nACV's antioxidant beta-carotene repairs free radical damage that can lay the groundwork for many types of cancer.\n\nA 2011 Swedish study found that the phenolic compounds in apples [and ACV] can prevent different chronic disorders such as cancer and cardiovascular disease.\n\nThere's increasing evidence that ACV's polyphenols can also have favorable effects on the incidence of other chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, and neurodegenerative disease.\n\nThe American Diabetes Foundation found that taking ACV before meals significantly increased insulin sensitivity and dramatically reduced the insulin and glucose spikes that occur after meals.\n\nACV slows the digestion of carbohydrates, giving the body more time to convert them to sugar, making potentially dangerous blood sugar spikes less likely.\n\nACV has been shown to cause a significant reduction in high blood pressure (hypertension)\n\nThe potassium and magnesium in ACV help increase calcium absorption from our foods, especially green vegetables.\n\nNow sprinkle generously with probiotics, essential enzymes, and ACV's polyphenols, which have potent antioxidant, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory properties. With a nutrient-dense tool chest like this, it\u2019s no wonder ACV comes with so many exciting health benefits.\n\nACV has been shown to lower bad cholesterol (LDL).\n\nCurative/medical\n\nIn an appealingly un-complex study, participants ate white bread alone or with 3 portions of ACV. Feelings of being full were more pronounced in the ACV group, meaning the desire to continue eating was reduced, meaning fewer calories ingested, meaning an aide in weight loss. The estimate was that the vinegar group consumed 200-275 fewer calories than the non-vinegar group. That's good health.\n\nACV\u2019s amino acids neutralize the build-up of lactic acid in the bloodstream that occurs after stress or exercise. Researchers believe that regular use of ACV can help combat fatigue\u2014even debilitating chronic fatigue\u2014and give you an energy boost without caffeine.\n\nAn ACV detox has been shown to lower blood sugar, insulin levels, and blood pressure during cleansing. Whether those results stayed on after cleansing isn't clear\u2014but that doesn't mean an occasional cleanse isn't a fine idea.\n\nACV's anti-inflammatory properties and abundant vitamin C are recognized as an effective front-line defense against allergy symptoms. Gargle equal parts ACV and water every half-hour to relieve a sore throat.\n\nArthritis is all about the pain of inflammation in the joints. Mineral deficiencies can exacerbate the pain. ACV's potent load of magnesium, potassium, and anti-inflammatory properties can help relieve the pain.\n\nCurative/cosmetic claims\n\nDandruff is caused by the fungus malassezia furfur. ACV's anti-fungal properties get rid of it. Rub into scalp, wait 30 minutes, shampoo.\n\nInstead of a chemical cocktail conditioner, a few minutes of ACV mixed with water on the scalp after shampooing will eliminate buildup from environmental pollutants and hair products, and result in softer, stronger, shinier hair.\n\nHealthy skin comes from a healthy gut, which ACV encourages by improving digestion. ACV is also known to improve liver, kidney, and bladder function, which helps keep the body detoxified.\n\nAcne is often caused by toxins clogging the pores. ACV's astringent and antiseptic properties help release those toxins and keep skin clear. Other skin ailments ACV will help relieve include eczema, psoriasis, and rosacea.\n\nAs an astringent, ACV splashed on the face\u2014think aftershave\u2014can tone and firm the skin.\n\nVaricose veins are an occasional, but rare, medical issue, so I've put curing them here in the cosmetics aisle. Massaging them with ACV at bedtime and on arising has long been recommended as a way to reduce their size and prominence.\n\nLet's be clear that glowing skin, glossy hair, clean breath, and the like all have origins in good health and hygiene. Compared to life-or-death protection against cancer and cardiovascular threats, these cosmetic issues are relatively minor. That said, feeling good about yourself is some of the best medicine around.\n\nCandida and other fungal infections are gut-based. ACV acts as a prebiotic for healthy bacteria, which can ease symptoms from the inside and can also be applied topically to treat symptoms.\n\nEasy going\n\nReferences\n\nThere's so much more\u2026but I hope this modest review has given you some assurance that ACV is a great alternative to many mainstream meds\u2014no side effects, easy to find, and inexpensive. Even better, it's wonderfully easy to enjoy its powers: two tablespoons in a glass of water every morning, before meals if you're trying to lose weight, and occasionally during the day. Also at bedtime if you have blood sugar issues. While this seems to be a \"what could go wrong?\" moment, you should always let your doctor know your intentions.
