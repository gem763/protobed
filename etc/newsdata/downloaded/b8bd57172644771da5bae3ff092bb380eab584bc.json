He was shaking ... And yet he'll talk about the United States very badly.\n\n\"I watched Popovich, sort of the same thing, but he didn't look quite as scared, actually.\n\n\"But they talk badly about the United States, but when the talk's about China, they don't wanna say anything bad. I thought it was pretty sad, actually.\"\n\nThe NBA has found itself in hot water in China in the aftermath of Morey's tweet.
