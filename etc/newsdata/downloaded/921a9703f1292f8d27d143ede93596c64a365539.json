That was still a drop from September, while the ZEW sub-index fell to its lowest headline reading since 2010.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t all good news: the U.K.\u2019s job boom cooled as fell by 56,000 in the three months to August, while growth (including bonuses) also weakened to 3.8% from 4.0%.\n\nWith still well supported in the foreign exchange markets, the U.K. underperformed the rest of the continent, falling 0.2% by 5 AM ET (0900 GMT). The benchmark was up 0.3% at 390.72, while Germany\u2019s was also up 0.3%.\n\nThe DAX\u2019s gain would have been bigger had it not been for a thumping 18% drop in payments company Wirecard (DE: ) in the wake of new allegations of false accounting by the Financial Times.\n\nThe FT and Wirecard have been at each other\u2019s throats for months, with Wirecard alleging the newspaper colluded with short sellers to manipulate its share price. The FT said that the law firm it had hired to investigate Wirecard\u2019s claims had found no evidence to support them. Wirecard had said much the same when it hired a law firm to investigate the FT\u2019s allegations.", "description": "StockBeat:  Markets Rise as China Confirms Deal With U.S.; Wirecard Slips", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEE980A6_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
