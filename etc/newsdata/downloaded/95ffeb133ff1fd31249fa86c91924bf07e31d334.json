Here\u2019s How He\u2019d Fix the Internet.", "language": "en", "text": "One of the more substantial critiques of data ownership is that if you treat data as purely a property right, it means that you can sell that right. If we treat privacy as a property right what that means is that we essentially have that right to trade it. And the problem is that it could worsen financial inequities. People with less income might be more willing to trade their important personal data for a small payment, while those who are better off can say, \u201cI don\u2019t need the dividend. I\u2019ll keep my data.\u201d How do you balance that?\n\nThere\u2019d be less of a sense of desperation in a society where there\u2019s a freedom dividend and everyone\u2019s getting $1,000 per month. But it is the case that certain people\u2019s data is worth more than others\u2019 data. And if you look right now there are many people with different preferences. There are people out there choosing to share the intimate details of their lives with millions of people; some make a living off it. So, if individuals want to share their data or information or even their private lives with other people, then that\u2019s their prerogative.\n\nSome of the plans you outline for data are quite broad and amount to \u201cData needs to be owned by the people.\u201d Some companies already subscribe to this but, in practice, we\u2019re still at their mercy. Does the extent of your plan amount to more than just saying, \u201cYou can have your data deleted?\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s going to happen in real life is you\u2019re going to use these companies. Things will happen behind the scenes while you\u2019re busy living your life. And then, if you want to, you can go and delete your data. That\u2019s a reasonable estimation of how it would work for many people. What I\u2019m suggesting is that we can do better. But it\u2019s not like individual consumers can band together to make this happen. Government needs to be a counterweight to the massive power and information inequities between us and the technology companies.\n\nWhat I think most people would want is a place they could go to see what\u2019s happening to their data, the option to delete their data and a record or log of all the times it trades hands. Then the companies do their thing and people would live with greater confidence that, if there are abuses, they\u2019ll be made aware of that and can always pull the plug.\n\nWe\u2019ve become like rats in a maze where we\u2019re constantly hit by messages from these companies know everything about us. They know more about us than our families do. We\u2019re responding to stimuli and we think we\u2019re making choices. But it\u2019s because we\u2019ve shared so much over time that they have a keen sense of what we want. There\u2019s something fundamental at stake here, which is: What does human agency look like? What are our rights as citizens?", "description": "\u201cThere\u2019s something fundamental at stake, which is: What does human agency look like?\u201d", "authors": ["Charlie Warzel"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/15/opinion/15warzelWeb/15warzelWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
