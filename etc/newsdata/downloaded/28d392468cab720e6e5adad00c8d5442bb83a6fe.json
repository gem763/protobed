And that is where we are. And I don\u2019t mean the last resort politically or last resort in terms of defeating the president in November, but the last resort for this country that is descending into an open racism and intolerance and violence led by the president,\" O'Rourke said.\n\nO'Rourke compared Trump to Nazi leaders twice during an interview with Al Sharpton on MSNBC. Sharpton had to ask for clarification to make sure he heard O'Rourke correctly.\n\n\"There is so much that is resonant of the Third Reich in this administration,\" O'Rourke told him.\n\n\n\n", "description": ".10/22/2019 11:04:58AM EST.", "authors": ["Julio Rosas", "Cortney O'Brien", "Matt Vespa", "Guy Benson"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/images/2019/295/49d6dc24-cb25-462d-9c19-e5df55573932.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
