My concern is that smearing me has become the rule not the exception.\n\n\u201cI had no involvement in the disappearance of Suzy Lamplugh.\u201d\n\nCannan, who says he suffers partial paralysis and needs to use a wheelchair following a stroke, claimed the Met were \u201cdetermined to use me as a convenient peg to hang the disappearance upon\u201d.\n\nBut Suzy\u2019s brother Richard brushed aside the killer\u2019s whines \u2013 and revealed Suzy\u2019s family believe he murdered her.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know Cannan but I don\u2019t care for him at all,\u201d said Richard, 59.\n\n\u201cHe was convicted of the murder of another girl and I\u2019d be happy for him to be kept in prison for as long as they need to.\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\n\u201cHe has never been prosecuted for my sister\u2019s murder, but Cannan will tell us what happened to Suzy when he is ready.\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s done it then I would like him to tell us her whereabouts and we can then bury her where we want to bury her, rather than where whoever killed her has buried her.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been through so many developments you don\u2019t get your hopes up.\n\n\u201cYou accept what comes and if you find her so be it. Then we will have to cope with whatever comes of it.\u201d\n\n(Image: Peter Jolly <peterjolly9@gmail.com>)\n\nEstate agent Suzy went missing in July 1986 after going to meet Mr Kipper \u2013 the entry in her diary \u2013 to show him around a house in Shorrolds Road, Fulham.\n\nHer car, a white Ford Fiesta, was later found outside a property for sale in Stevenage Road about a mile and a half away.\n\nThe doors were unlocked, the handbrake was off and her purse was discovered in a side door pocket.\n\nPolice named Cannan as the prime suspect in Suzy\u2019s disappearance and murder in 2002 \u2013 but prosecutors said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute.\n\nCold case detectives have staged a string of digs in recent years in the hunt for her remains, including a search of the garden at Cannan\u2019s mother\u2019s old home in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nAnd last year VHS tapes of Metropolitan Police interviews with the killer were published after reportedly being discovered in a South London rubbish skip.\n\nBut Cannan insisted: \u201cBeing continuously linked to the disappearance of Suzy Lamplugh has left me feeling puzzled and powerless because I had no involvement.\n\n\u201cI cannot disclose the whereabouts of Suzy Lamplugh because I didn\u2019t kill her. I cannot tell people things I do not know.\u201d\n\nThe former car salesman was given three life sentences for abducting and murdering Shirley Banks, 29, in Bristol in October 1987.\n\n(Image: Francis Hawkins / SWNS.com)\n\nShe was held captive at his flat and forced to phone in sick to the factory where she worked as a textiles manager. Cannan killed her by hitting her head with a rock before he dumped her naked body at Dead Women\u2019s Ditch in the Quantock Hills in Somerset.\n\nHe was also convicted of the attempted kidnap of Julia Holman the night before he snatched Shirley \u2013 and the rape of a woman in Reading a year earlier.\n\nCannan was handed a whole life tariff, later reduced to 35-year minimum.\n\nLast night retired Det Supt Jim Dickie \u2013 who spent six years investigating Suzy\u2019s abduction \u2013 said: \u201cCannan is still a suspect for the disappearance and murder of Suzy Lamplugh. There is no doubt about that at all. There have been a number of historical digs in and around areas which John Cannan frequented and knows. He obviously believes that he is going to get parole.\n\n\u201cIf the Parole Board ever release Cannan into the general public again, the consequences of freeing a serial rapist and murderer must be on their heads.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s extremely manipulative and must not be trusted.\u201d\n\nThe 18 hours of VHS cassettes showing Cannan being interviewed in 2000 emerged last November.\n\nIn the videos \u2013 conducted over three days at Hammersmith police station \u2013 Cannan was asked point blank: \u201cWhat have you done with her body?\u201d\n\n(Image: Birmingham Mail)\n\nClearly marked with the name John Cannan, the videos date from the Met\u2019s Operation Phoebus \u2014 a re-investigation of the Lamplugh case.\n\nCannan told us: \u201cAs for my police interview tapes allegedly found in a skip, I lodged a formal complaint with the Metropolitan Police.\n\n\u201cWhatever the truth of the matter is, I doubt that the police investigation will resolve it.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\u201cI do not have any confidence in the Metropolitan Police.\u201d\n\nCannan was rushed to hospital after suffering a stroke in Category A HMP Full Sutton, East Yorks, earlier this year.\n\nHe complains that the stroke has left him \u201cexhausted\u201d all the time.\n\n\u201cIt has caused me partial paralysis down my left hand side and played havoc with my balance,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cMy memory has diminished. On the positive side, I write a lot and derive much pleasure doing so.\u201d\n\nWhen the Sunday Mirror approached Cannan\u2019s lawyer, Matthew Claughton of Olliers Solicitors, he said they were continuing to support his denial of Suzy\u2019s murder.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: John Cannan, 64 \u2013 the prime suspect in the estate agent\u2019s 1986 disappearance \u2013 is eligible for release in 2022 after serving more than 30 years for the killing of factory worker Shirley Banks in 1987", "authors": ["Dan Warburton", "Image", "Expressstar", "Swns", "Rex Shutterstock", "Peter Jolly", "Francis Hawkins", "Swns.Com", "Birmingham Mail", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20653620.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_15315063.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
