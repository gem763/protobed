In some cases this will be because they have an old-fashioned sense of solidarity, in others it\u2019s because they don\u2019t want to harm a chance for promotion.\n\n\n\nWinning these MPs over would be easier if Johnson was certain of victory.\n\n\n\nWhen the result is on a knife-edge Labour MPs will be more reluctant to side with the Government for fear of being cast as the one MP who gifted Johnson his triumph.\n\nThe biggest sticking point for most Labour MPs is the way the deal paves the way for the rolling back of workers\u2019 rights and environmental safeguards.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\n\n\n\nSlashing workers\u2019 rights is not a consequence of Brexit.\n\n\n\nIt was hardwired into the project from the start .\n\n\n\nThe right has long disliked the EU because of the social chapter that provides workers protections form exploitative employers by guaranteeing paid holidays, health and safety safeguards and equal rights for part-time and temporary staff.\n\n\n\nIf you tear yourself away from a free trade relationship with your largest trading partner, as we have done, then you need to find a way to compensate for the economic shortfall.\n\n\n\nFor the right that means stripping away the regulations that supposedly make you less competitive.\n\n\n\nThis becomes even more of an imperative as we scramble to sign new trade deals with the US, India and other countries.\n\nThe most obvious way for the Government to reassure Labour MPs is to write on the front of the Bill a pledge to maintain a level playing field on rights and protections.\n\n\n\nBut Labour MPs are reluctant to trust the Conservatives.\n\n\n\nWhy should it when the path of Brexit chosen under Johnson\u2019s deal makes repealing of regulations and protections inevitable?\n\n\n\nToday's agenda:\n\n\n\nArm twisting, coercion, bribery and extortion mainly.\n\n\n\nWhat I am reading:\n\n\n\nDavid Howell on how the world is changing and we are struggling to catch up", "description": "Boris Johnson needs to persuade Labour MPs to back his Brexit deal.
