REUTERS/Stringer\n\n\u201cOnly two of those killed were security force members, and the rest of them are civilians, including women, children, patients and visitors,\u201d spokesman Gul Islam Syaal said of Thursday\u2019s attack.\n\nThe Taliban said the target of the attack in Qalat, the capital of Zabul province, was a nearby building housing the government\u2019s intelligence department.\n\nThe Islamist militants have been carrying out nearly daily attacks since the collapse of peace talks with the United States this month, in the run-up to elections on Sept. 28.\n\nCasualties since the talks fell apart less than two weeks ago are now at least 331, including 96 killed.\n\nThe Taliban has said its fighters will step up their campaign against the Afghan government and foreign forces to dissuade people from voting.\n\nPresident Ashraf Ghani on Friday promised measures to prevent civilian casualties in the war against militants, a day after at least 30 civilians were killed in a U.S. drone strike in eastern Nangarhar province.\n\nGhani said he had introduced \u201cchecks and balances\u201d to stop night raids and attacks leading to the loss of innocent lives.\n\nHe was speaking at an election rally in Jalalabad, the capital of Nangarhar province.\n\nAfghan forces, often backed by the U.S. military, have intensified ground and air operations against Islamist groups to protect civilians, government buildings, polling stations and a large expatriate population.\n\nBut some of their operations have killed and injured civilians, angering locals who have staged protests against the tactical blunders committed by the foreign and Afghan forces.\n\nGhani said he has ordered investigations into recent incidents in which the Afghan forces accidentally targeted civilians. He did not comment directly on the U.S. drone strike.\n\nU.S. security officials in Afghanistan said the drone strike was intended to destroy a hideout used by Islamic State fighters.", "description": "The death toll in a Taliban truck bombing that destroyed a hospital in southern Afghanistan has risen to 39, nearly double the previous figure, with 140 wounded, a spokesman for the provincial governor said on Friday.", "authors": ["Abdul Qadir Sediqi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1431957596&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J0VF", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
