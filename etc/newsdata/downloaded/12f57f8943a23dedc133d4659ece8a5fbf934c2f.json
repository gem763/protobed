Oil surged as much as 20% at one point on Monday.\n\nDuring a news conference on Tuesday, Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said the kingdom has recovered supplies by tapping inventories, and lost oil output of 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd) by the end of September.\n\nBrent crude LCOc1 futures sank $4.47, or 6.5%, to settle at $64.55 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell $3.56, or 5.7%, to settle at $59.34 a barrel.\n\nBrent sank more than 7% during the news conference.\n\n\u201cThe latest news means that we will not be rushing to revise up our oil price forecast of $60 per barrel at end-2019. That said, there remain some important questions to be answered about the attacks, which may mean that we will have to consider a permanently higher risk premium in our price forecasts,\u201d said Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist for Capital Economics, in a note.\n\nState-owned producer Saudi Aramco told some Asian refiners it would meet its oil commitments, albeit with changes, sources said. The attacks on crude-processing facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais resulted in the largest single supply disruption in half a century, and threw into question Saudi Arabia\u2019s status as supplier of last resort.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Global oil prices pull back but remain jittery - here)\n\nThe prospect of releases from strategic oil reserves in the United States, and other industrialized countries that the International Energy Agency advises, such as Japan, have weighed on prices, but the geopolitical threat of retaliation is causing concerns.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence said the United States was reviewing evidence that suggests Iran was behind the attacks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re evaluating all the evidence. We\u2019re consulting with our allies. And the president will determine the best course of action in the days ahead,\u201d Pence said.\n\nWashington believes the attacks originated in southwestern Iran, a U.S. official told Reuters.\n\nRelations between the United States and Iran have deteriorated since U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear accord last year and reimposed sanctions on its oil exports.\n\nOil pump jacks work at sunset near Midland, Texas, U.S., August 21, 2019.

Saudi King Salman called on world governments to confront threats to oil supplies.\n\nU.S. crude inventories rose by 592,000 barrels in the week ended Sept. 13 to 422.5 million, data from industry group the American Petroleum Institute showed on Tuesday. Analysts had expected a decrease of 2.5 million barrels.\n\nOfficial U.S. government data will be released on Wednesday.", "description": "Oil prices tumbled about 6% on Tuesday after Saudi Arabia's energy minister said the country has managed to restore oil supplies to where they stood before weekend attacks on its facilities shut 5% of global oil output.", "authors": ["Stephanie Kelly", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430703610&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G08X", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
