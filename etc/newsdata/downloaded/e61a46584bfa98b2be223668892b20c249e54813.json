Glass was 19 years old, and for most of the set just a blur of spectral movement frozen into violent shapes by an almost incessant strobe; singing, shouting and screaming her way through songs such as \u201cCourtship Dating\u201d. The result was a reminder that whenever one of your heroes gets on stage to try to channel that primal essence of \u201crock \u2019n\u2019 roll\u201d \u2013 or whatever the hell it is \u2013 most of the time, they\u2019re just trying to find an echo of something that once flowed through them. That can go on for 50 years or more. There\u2019s sadness now in the memory, but on this day in April 2008, Glass had it.
