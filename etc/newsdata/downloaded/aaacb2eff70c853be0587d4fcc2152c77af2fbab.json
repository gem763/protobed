Indian equities benchmark rose 4.1% last month.\n\nMalaysia's price-to-earnings ratio was 15.66, second highest in Asia, even though their shares registered a 1.75% decline in September.\n\n\"Despite the falling market in recent months,( Bursa Malaysia index's) valuations have not improved because forward earnings estimates have collapsed: earnings are now expected to contract by 4% against a 1% contraction as of end June.\" said brokerage Jefferies in a report on Tuesday.\n\nMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares gained 2.13% during September and its forward 12-month price-to-earnings ratio rose to a five-month high of 13.14 times at the end of last month. The August level was 12.78.\n\nChina, Hong Kong and South Korea were the lowest-cost shares in the region, with P/E multiples of about 11 or less, according to Refinitiv.\n\nRegional shares still trade at a slight discount to their global peers, the data showed.\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/2oEt0Du MSCI Asia and World forward PE\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/2nQhPaV\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>", "description": "India, Malaysia priciest share markets in Asia - Refinitiv data", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB280W7_L.jpg"}
