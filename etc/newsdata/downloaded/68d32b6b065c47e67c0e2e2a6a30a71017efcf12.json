Traveling from somewhere beyond, he touched down in the desert outside L.A., where he met, and promptly fell for, a young Helena Christensen. Who could blame him?\n\nThat story was the work of Peter Lindbergh, one of the greats of 20th-century fashion photography, who died Wednesday at the age of 74. Lindbergh is justly regarded as a master for several reasons \u2014 the critic Vince Aletti called him one of the best portraitists in fashion \u2014 but the reason that sticks with me is the cinematography he brought into fashion photography, his insistence on telling a story. The Martian shoot is a landmark in fashion history; it\u2019s credited with being the first narrative shoot. But because he cared about the story, he cared about his characters too. The clothes, important as they were, came second. \u201cIf you take out the fashion and the artifice, then you can see the real person,\u201d he once said. His stories came \u201cnever from the clothes, as much as I deeply respect the designers,\u201d he told Artforum in 2016. The Martian idea, he said, came from a Skywatcher magazine found in a waiting room at the American hospital in Paris.\n\nI spoke to Lindbergh only once that I can recall, by phone at his Paris studio late, late into the night his time. Franca Sozzani, the pathbreaking editor of Italian Vogue, had died and I was writing her obituary for the New York Times. Sozzani had been Lindbergh\u2019s champion, first at Lei, then at Vogue, sticking up for him even when he made the unforgivable-to-Cond\u00e9-Nast desertion to Bazaar for a few years, and hiring him back afterward. He talked about Sozzani reverentially \u2014 he joked, I think, that he was in love with her, and she used to call herself \u201cthe longest wife in your life.\u201d It\u2019s not hard to see why he would have been so taken with her. Like Lindbergh, Sozzani put the photos, and the photographers, first. She trusted the ones she championed. She allowed them their Martians.\n\nWhen we spoke, a few days before Christmas in 2016, our conversation wended back to that story. He\u2019d done filmic shoots since, including his famous \u201cAngel\u201d shoot with Amber Valletta \u2014 an homage of sorts to Wings of Desire \u2014 or even his portrait of who we now call the Supermodels (Naomi, Christy, Linda, Cindy, and Tatjana) for British Vogue, which distinguished him as the first person to shoot them all together. (They weren\u2019t called \u201cSupermodels\u201d then, but through Lindbergh\u2019s lens they looked so strong, so self-possessed, that the backstory seemed to suggest itself: they were heroic, therefore Super.) But the Martian was special. Christensen was just beginning; Lindbergh remembered her coming to his house in Paris with her mom and thinking she had a wonderful face, \u201ctotally new.\u201d But the Martian had to have just as much feeling and pathos. \u201cThey never had money, no?\u201d Lindbergh said of Italian Vogue; their production budgets were small. \u201cI wanted to have this Martian really, really perfect with a glass bowl over his head, but under the head I didn\u2019t want to have a mask. I wanted to have expression.\u201d\n\nExpression took masks, in the end \u2014 expensive ones. The alien heads Lindbergh wanted, he recalled, were 8,500 deutsche marks (around $15,000 at the time). \u201cShe said, \u2018Are you out of your fucking mind?\u2019\u201d\n\nAs he recalled, he footed the bill. It was worth it. The pictures became among his most famous, and among Sozzani\u2019s favorite. She requested a big print of it, which Lindbergh gave her.\n\nThere\u2019s something about the Martian that stays with me, the way it finds the gentle comedy in glamour, rather than canceling it out. Too often, ugly is played for funny. Lindbergh was capable of great beauty \u2014 those portraits, his women \u2014 but those aren\u2019t the photos of his that I remember best. I remember Naomi in the convertible with the Dalmatians, the female Beatles, the poor little Martian: They\u2019re generous and warm, when so much fashion photography that followed was studiously cold. No less than Rei Kawakubo, the creative genius of Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, who had a long collaboration with him, once said \u201cWhat is strong about Peter\u2019s work is the humanity inherent in his photographs.\u201d Even Martians weren\u2019t immune.\n\nStay in touch.
