People were questioning him, but he is not just an incredible handful for defenders, he is getting his goals as well.\n\n\u2018I trusted him at the start of the season. He also has Giroud and Batshuayi there, and he has made the place his own at the moment. I will keep on him because I want more.\n\n\u2018He took a whack on the back of the knee, but he is ok. I think he wanted the applause.\u2019\n\nAfter spending three seasons on loan to Bristol City, Swansea City and Aston Villa, Abraham has finally been given an opportunity at Chelsea and he has certainly made the most of it.\n\nLampard was delighted with Chelsea\u2019s win against Southampton at St Mary\u2019s (Picture: PA)\n\nFollowing his double against Southampton, Abraham is the joint-leading goalscorer in the Premier League alongside Sergio Aguero and his form has led to a call-up to the England squad.\n\nAbraham credited his teammates for his call-up, saying: \u2018It\u2019s been fantastic, I give it [the call-up] to my teammates, the manager, all the staff, everyone who has believed in me.\n\n\u2018I give it to my team, they are always providing me with chances when you play with such great players you always get chances.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement", "description": "Frank Lampard has insisted that there is more to come from Tammy Abraham despite the striker scoring his ninth goal of the season during Chelsea's 4-1 win over Southampton.
