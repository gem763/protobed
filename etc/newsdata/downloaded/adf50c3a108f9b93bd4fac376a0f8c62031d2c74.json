Ankara views the YPG as terrorists with links to Kurdish insurgents operating in southeast Turkey.\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer's idea is a departure for Germany, which is still a reluctant partner in security missions abroad, above all in the Middle East, due to the legacy of World War Two though it has increased its involvement in the last two decades.\n\n\n\n\n\nIRRITATION\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer, seeking to boost her credentials as the CDU's candidate for chancellor in a 2021 election, said she had liaised closely with Merkel on the idea.\n\nShe quickly won backing from party allies including Norbert Roettgen, head of parliament's foreign affairs committee who said the proposal was \"brave and worthy of support\".\n\nHowever, the proposal raised tension in Merkel's coalition as the SPD is wary of foreign military commitments.\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer also raised eyebrows by saying she had been in touch with SPD Foreign Minister Heiko Maas by text message and, in an unusually direct riposte, Maas said he did not think much of text message diplomacy.\n\nHe echoed scepticism voiced by several other SPD lawmakers and said he needed more details, such as what role German soldiers would play, before making any assessment. But he stopped short of ruling out the plan altogether and stressed Germany would continue to be involved in seeking a diplomatic solution for Syria and in providing humanitarian aid.\n\nThe plan won support from Germany's notable Kurdish community, angry about Turkey's assault on northeastern Syria, following a U.S. troop pullback, that has sent thousands of Kurds in the region fleeing. Kurds make up about a third of the roughly 3 million people with Turkish roots in Germany.
