It\u2019s a number so rosy that many of the strategists themselves expect that number to come down as more information comes in over the next few weeks.\n\nWhile earnings growth forecasts may come down, don\u2019t expect the average to reflect a decline.\n\n\u201cBottom-up earnings expectations (i.e., those derived by aggregating individual company forecasts) have NEVER forecasted\n\na profits recession before one occurred, and current forecasts might be following that historical pattern,\u201d observed Richard Bernstein of Richard Bernstein Advisors.\n\nWall St. never expects the next 12 months of earnings per share growth to be negative. (Richard Bernstein Advisors) More\n\nWhat\u2019s peculiar about the current forecast for the 500 largest companies is that it\u2019s contradicting what the experts are seeing in smaller companies.\n\n\u201cEstimates for small and mid- cap stocks have begun to fall, and that makes sense because smaller companies tend to be more sensitive to economic cycles,\u201d Bernstein noted. \u201cHowever, larger capitalization stocks\u2019 earnings forecasts are still increasing!\u201d\n\nThis is a bit disappointing because value in the stock market is driven by earnings. And if you can\u2019t get an accurate read on future earnings, then you certainly can\u2019t calculate the fair price of the market with any kind of precision.\n\nBernstein characterizes what would be a gloomier-than-expected outlook for earnings as a \u201csmoke alarm\u201d for investors, who themselves are rarely prepared for bad news.\n\n\u201cThe fact that bottom-up forecasts have never predicted a profits recession, that small and mid-cap earnings estimates are falling, and that large cap stocks\u2019 estimates are rising seems to suggest more risk than investors are anticipating,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd so, we have a case for some volatility as expectations change and markets adjust. What should you do about this?\n\nThe late Jack Bogle might say, \u201cDon\u2019t do something. Just stand there!\u201d Bogle might be joking, but what he said is a reminder that investing in stocks is a long-term investors game.\n\nThere\u2019s no telling what the market will do in the next year. But for those willing to stomach some short-term volatility, U.S. stocks have a funny way of eventually rewarding patient investors.\n\nBy Sam Ro, managing editor.
