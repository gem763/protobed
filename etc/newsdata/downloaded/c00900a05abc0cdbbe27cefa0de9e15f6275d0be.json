The streaming arms race has a big problem.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nComedian Jerry Seinfeld walks the red carpet at the Kennedy Center in 2018. His show \u201cSeinfeld\u201d is one of several programs commanding astronomical prices from streaming services. (Bill O\u2019Leary/The Washington Post)\n\nThe numbers are enough to make you think it\u2019s 1995 and George is first getting mad at Jerry for breaking their pact.\n\nThis week, Netflix paid a reported $500 million for streaming rights to all 180 episodes of \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d A day later, Warner Media, looking to beef up its imminent HBO Max service, paid a reported $1 billion for streaming rights to the nearly 300 episodes of \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d This came on top of the estimated $425 million the company already paid for \u201cFriends.\u201d\n\nAnd all of this comes on the heels of Comcast\u2019s $500 million purchase of \u201cThe Office\u201d for its new NBC Universal streaming service, named Peacock.\n\nThe money will certainly make some studios rich and assure fans the shows will exist online, somewhere, for the foreseeable future. But it ignores a fundamental question: How exactly are these shows valued?\n\nMore important, it ignores the fact that nobody seems to know the answer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the biggest problem people aren\u2019t talking about: We have no actual information about what creates or reduces churn,\u201d said Dan Rayburn, an expert on streaming media technology. \u201cSo we have no way of knowing how much a show is really worth.\u201d\n\nThe problem, Rayburn and others say, is that the profit-and-loss statement is out the window, being replaced by \u2026 nobody knows.\n\nThe value of classic shows was once easily quantified, via the syndication model. There was practically a formula. A buyer calculated the ratings in first-run and repeats. Then they looked at how much ad money a show thus rated could garner. Then they agreed to prices accordingly.\n\nThe equation was simple: You wanted to sell enough ads to justify your cost. It didn\u2019t always work out, of course. But there was a road map.\n\nStreaming now, though, appears to be a total gamble. How do you measure the value of a show to a streamer? The number of people who signed up for the service specifically because of that show? Well, that\u2019s probably not very many, at least who are documentable. What about the general luster a top-tier comedy hit accrues back to a streaming brand? Sure, but how exactly do you measure that, let alone put a dollar figure on it?\n\nYet the dollar figures are indeed enormous. To give a sense of scale, just over 20 years ago, TBS shocked the industry with a $200 million syndication deal for \u201cSeinfeld.\u201d Four years ago, the numbers were considered equally giant when Hulu paid Sony $160 million for the comedy. Netflix\u2019s number is more than three times that \u2014 without any ads to defray the cost.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the business model? What\u2019s the argument to business affairs that says any of these shows, even ones that people binge a lot, is worth it?\u201d said a Hollywood veteran who has worked extensively in syndication, speaking on condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize industry relationships. (At least Peacock and HBO Max are paying sister companies. Netflix is not.)\n\nIt\u2019s one thing, the person noted, for new content to command sky-high prices \u2014 like overall creative deals Warner made with J.J. Abrams and Netflix sealed with Kenya Barris, Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy, all of which totaled at least $100 million. Those are for a slate of new shows, with theoretically high upside. These buys are for old shows \u2014 proven, yes, but with a cultural moment and mass viewership well behind them. (Disney and Apple, incidentally, remain the outliers; they\u2019re among the few not joining the classic-TV buying frenzy.)\n\nMaking the problem worse is that nobody really knows how to define what a binge-worthy show is in the first place.\n\n\u201cBig Bang\u201d does well in reruns on TBS, but will it stream well? \u201cSeinfeld\u201d has long been a 10 and 11 p.m. television powerhouse, but does that mean people will want to watch it repeatedly on-demand?\n\n\u201cSeinfeld is better artistically and infinitely more influential and generally more culturally important than Friends,\u201d wrote culture pundit Adam Sternbergh, who has covered both shows. \u201cIt is not remotely, however, as binge-friendly. Not even close.\u201d He said the distinction was that the show was \u201cinnovative and hilarious and brilliantly constructed and spiky\" but unlike \u201cFriends\u201d had \u201cno hugging, no learning.\u201d\n\nThe shows that are most repeatable \u2014 if Netflix\u2019s pronouncements are accurate, \u201cFriends\u201d and \u201cThe Office\u201d \u2014 do have likable characters you mainly just really want to hang out with, almost more than you\u2019re interested in their ultimate fates. (That\u2019s one reason \u201cBig Bang\u201d seems like it might, at least theoretically, fit into this group.) But likeability alone hardly seems enough to give you repeatability. As Sternbergh notes, hitting the sweet spot, in which people want to watch a show over and over again, each episode interchangeable with the next, is extremely difficult.\n\nWith so little information about whether a show will work, the answer for streaming services simply may be to just spend a lot on a major hit \u2014 any major hit. After all, HBO Max and Peacock need something notable to offer at launch.\n\n\u201cI think Warner and Comcast are just moving a thousand miles an hour, buying whatever they can no matter the cost just so they can go to consumers with brand names,\u201d Rayburn said. Netflix, for its part, then simply needs to counter the competition.\n\nIn a new study, the research group Reach3 found that just 20 percent of consumers would \u201cabsolutely subscribe to Disney+\u201d \u2014 a service that already has all the franchises and name recognition these competitors are seeking. Just 7 percent said they would subscribe to Apple TV+.\n\nThat puts Warner Media, Comcast and even Netflix at a disadvantage, paying ever-escalating costs for shows that may not be watched and wouldn\u2019t necessarily drive subscriptions if they were. Like Jerry and the pact, it might not be long before some of them think twice about shaking any hands.", "description": "Everyone\u2019s spending millions on old TV shows, but nobody knows why.", "authors": ["Steven Zeitchik", "Reporter Covering The Business Of Entertainment In The U.S.", "Steven Zeitchik Covers The Business Of Entertainment For The Washington Post", "Examining The Industry'S Trends", "Challenges", "Issues", "Ideas.
