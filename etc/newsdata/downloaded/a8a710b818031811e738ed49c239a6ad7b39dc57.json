In his resignation letter, he said the president was entitled to \"a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours.\"\n\nIn a contentious meeting between Trump and congressional lawmakers on Wednesday (where both Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the other was having a \"meltdown\"), Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, invoked comments Mattis made about the withdrawal from Syria in a recent interview, The Washington Post reported.\n\nTrump responded by calling the retired four-star Marine Corps general \"world's most overrated general,\" who wasn't \"tough enough.\"\n\nMattis' response included biting jokes: \"I earned my spurs on the battlefield ... Donald Trump earned his spurs from the doctor,\" he said referring to Trump's medical deferment during the Vietnam war for alleged bone spurs in his heels.\n\nOn a more serious note, Mattis said that he doesn't like to dip into partisan matters, but he warned that we live in deeply divided times, invoking President Abraham Lincoln's Lyceum speech (which was made before he was president).\n\n\"Lincoln went on, it was not the foreign aggressor we must fear; it was corrosion from within. The rot, the viciousness, the lassitude, the ignorance,\" Mattis paraphrased from the speech. \"Anarchy is one potential consequence of all this. Another is the rise of an ambitious leader unfettered by conscience or precedent or decency who would make themselves supreme.\n\n\"'If destruction be our lot,' Lincoln warned, 'We must, ourselves, be its author and finisher,'\" Mattis quoted from the speech.\n\nHe also addressed US soldiers who fought with the Kurdish-majority Syrian Democratic Forces, who were allies against the Islamic State in the region.\n\n\"We owe a debt to all who have fought for liberty including those who tonight serve in the far corners of our planet,\" Mattis said. \"Among them, the American men and women supporting our Kurdish allies.\"\n\nThe Syrian Kurds, who Turkey says are linked to the Turkey-based Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) (a group designated as a terrorist organization), are now facing an attack from Turkey in northeastern Syria. Northeastern Syria had been a Kurdish-controlled area of civil war-torn Syria, where detained Islamic State fighters were being held, backed with US special forces, who have since pulled out of the region at Trump's orders.\n\nWith the US decision to pull roughly 1,000 troops from Syria, Turkey launched a military operation.\n\nWatch the speech here:\n\nTweet Embed:\n\n//twitter.com/mims/statuses/1185043378628648962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\n\nA somber former military official deciding to finally break his silence and express his concerns about a President by cracking jokes is quite bizarre. pic.twitter.com/IXKBrtsbvz\n\nNOW WATCH: We went inside Border Patrol boot camp and found the Academy isn't training agents for the job the White House is asking them to do", "description": "\"And you have to admit, between me and Meryl, at least we've had some victories,\" he added at the Al Smith dinner.", "authors": ["Lauren Frias"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rDz5YwuF9_BwGM983lH1kw--~B/aD0xODU1O3c9MjQ3MztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/5046678f5f9a9072f0bd10d71d1cd882", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
