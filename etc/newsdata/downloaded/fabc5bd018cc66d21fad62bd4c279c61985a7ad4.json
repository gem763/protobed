You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\n\u201cWe were approached by a consortium this summer who wanted to buy us out, and came offering a fortune,\u201d Stelling said. \u201cIt transpired that one of them had just spent a few years in prison for fraud... so we said \u2018thank you very much, no thanks, on your bike\u2019.\n\n\u201cThose people will go to other clubs and try it on in exactly the same way. I\u2019ve got a friend in the game who has a pretty good idea of who\u2019s kosher and who\u2019s not.\n\n\u201cI know he\u2019s been on the phone to a couple of clubs in the past warning them about the people that they were negotiating with.\n\n\u201cAll you can do is offer advice, you can\u2019t stop them because sometimes the situation is so extreme that you\u2019re going under unless you take the offer.\u201d\n\nStelling was part of Teesside businessman Raj Singh\u2019s takeover of Hartlepool in 2018 after the north-east club were relegated from the Football League and suffered financial difficulties.\n\nDetailing the problems his club experienced, Stelling said: \u201cWe were in a financial mess, our books were chaotic,\u201d adding that some players were being paid \u00a375,000 a year and needed to be paid off, the club opting to take \u201cimmediate pain for long-term gain\u201d.\n\nHowever, while clubs need to be vigilant when it comes to new owners, Stelling believes the EFL is in a bind when it comes to \u2018fit and proper\u2019 tests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy for people to say that the EFL should have more stringent checks on ownership, but if they\u2019d said no to Steve Dale at Bury the club would have gone under then (when Dale took over, in December 2018),\u201d Stelling said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m of the view that if you\u2019re a drowning man and someone throws you a rope, you don\u2019t examine his credentials too much before you grab it, and I think the EFL is in a really difficult situation in terms of fair and proper tests.\n\n\u201cEvery club is in danger of being bought by people who do not have the club at heart.\u201d\n\nStelling on Sunday completed the last of his four marathons in four days for Prostate Cancer UK, raising more than \u00a3200,000 for the charity in walking the 26-mile distance in Glasgow, Belfast, Cardiff and London.\n\nHe was joined by hundreds of others, including those affected by the disease and former footballers, taking in 16 football clubs along the way.\n\n\u201cWhat better vehicle to use to get your message out than football clubs?\u201d Stelling said of the charity effort. \u201cThey (the clubs) have all been fantastically helpful, and it\u2019s great that high-profile managers wear the Prostate Cancer badge on the lapel when they\u2019re being interviewed and the like.\n\n\u201cPeople used to say, \u2018It\u2019s not the sort of thing you\u2019re going to talk about in the bar\u2019. Well, if you\u2019ve got a concern, maybe you should. Maybe your mate might be able to point you in the direction of Prostate Cancer UK or your GP.\u201d\n\nTo donate, visit http://www.justgiving.com/campaign/jeffsmarchformen2019.
