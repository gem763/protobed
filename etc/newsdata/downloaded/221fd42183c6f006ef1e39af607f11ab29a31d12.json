A decade ago, The New Republic revealed that Ron Paul\u2019s libertarian antiwar newsletters also contained \u201cdecades worth of obsession with conspiracies, sympathy for the right-wing militia movement, and deeply held bigotry against blacks, jews, and gays\u201d; one of Paul\u2019s ghostwriters, his former congressional chief of staff Lew Rockwell, continues to maintain a popular \u201canti-state, anti-war, pro-market\u201d site that publishes screeds that declare \u201cblack criminals have a free license to do what they want\u201d and \u201cfeminism is akin to cancer on the world.\u201d\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Tucker Carlson. The Fox host regularly criticizes the military-industrial complex\u2014that is, when he\u2019s not defending Trump\u2019s rants about \u201cshithole countries\u201d as \u201csomething that almost every single person in America actually agrees with,\u201d or arguing that Representative Ilhan Omar \u201chas undisguised contempt for the United States\u201d and that \u201cmaybe that\u2019s our fault for asking too little of our immigrants.\u201d Before Carlson became a white-right icon, his prime-time guest list occasionally included Khanna, who found common cause with the Fox anchor\u2019s isolationist impulses. \u201c\u2066@TuckerCarlson\u2069 offers a devastating critique interventionism and shows how much of the foreign policy establishment has failed the American people. There is an emerging, left right coalition of common sense for a foreign policy of restraint,\u201d Khanna tweeted back in February.\n\nThe Twitter ratio was swift and the condemnation was thorough. \u201c[W]hatever policy goal overlap there is between Carlson\u2019s herrenvolk white nationalism and a left policy of foreign restraint, looking to ally with him is a bad precedent,\u201d Kelsey Atherton, a military-tech reporter, replied.\n\nKhanna no longer goes on Carlson\u2019s program, but other Democrats do\u2014and have received similar opprobrium. Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, who has positioned herself as the antiwar Democratic presidential candidate despite having visited with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and her ties to Hindu nationalists, went on Carlson\u2019s show to discuss suing Google\u2014an appearance criticized by British political journalist Mehdi Hasan, among others. \u201cHow can a Democratic member of Congress appear on Tucker Carlson\u2019s show, only days after he\u2019s been inciting hate against two of her black House colleagues (Omar and Cummings), to talk about something *else*, rather than to slam him for being a bigot live on air?\u201d he tweeted.\n\n\u201cI think that the consensus of the left-right skepticism on military interventionism has common ground based on what\u2019s in America\u2019s interest in a very narrow sense,\u201d Khanna told me. But he is antiwar because he supports human rights and diplomatic engagement. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to understand the difference [in] the moral force that animates both sides,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Quincy Institute is also seeking common ground by staffing up with war skeptics across the political spectrum. \u201cWe\u2019re not monolithic,\u201d Wertheim, the cofounder, told me. \u201cWe take very seriously the trans-partisan nature of the institute.\u201d Quincy came about in part, Wertheim said, because he wanted to take on the military industrial complex and concluded that working with people of different political beliefs was the best way to do that.\n\n\n\nBut there are different political beliefs, and then there is the absurd assertion by some conservatives like Raimondo and Carlson that Trump himself is antiwar. His unilateral decision to allow Turkey to attack America\u2019s Kurdish allies in Syria is not getting plaudits from serious war skeptics. \u201cTrump is not ending any endless wars but simply ordering U.S. military personnel to move out of the way for Turkish forces to enter,\u201d Wertheim said. \u201cTrump, in some ways, takes to logical or illogical conclusions the pathologies we\u2019ve been seeing for a long time.\u201d (Some\u2014but not all\u2014staunch supporters of Gabbard, as well as Green Party supporters and diehard Trumpists, hailed the perplexing move as a victory for peace.)\n\n\n\nAll of which is to say that while pacifism is having a moment, it\u2019s a moment so fraught that its emerging leaders and institutions have yet to locate the bright line between helpful partners and bad-faith whitewashers\u2014much less incorporate it into a coherent progressive foreign policy. Khanna might have some ideas on that, but it\u2019s hard to plan that far ahead when the world is on fire\u2013when it matters less who is in the bucket-brigade than how much water they can carry. \u201cThere are people who I disagree with so strongly on many issues,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cBut,\u201d he added, referencing the humanitarian crisis in Yemen, \u201cif they are willing to prevent a famine of 14 million, I will work with them.\u201d", "description": "As Trump\u2019s caprices build broad resistance to military engagement, the pacifist left considers how to ally with its political opponents.", "authors": ["Emily Tamkin"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/1ccd74984cb307d6f3506810ca02b4a871832109.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
