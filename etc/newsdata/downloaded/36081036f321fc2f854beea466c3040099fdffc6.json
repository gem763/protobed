Pollution readings in some places had peaked at 500, the most severe level on the government index.\n\n\"It is a public health emergency,\" said Desh Deepak, a chest physician at the city's Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital.\n\n\"Today, lungs are far blacker compared to 20 years ago.\"\n\nSome citizens' groups and doctors took to Twitter to call for schools to be temporarily closed until the air quality improved.\n\nFormer India cricket captain Bishan Singh Bedi, meanwhile, led a chorus of warnings over New Delhi hosting a limited-overs Twenty20 cricket match between India and Bangladesh on Sunday, citing \"hazardous air quality\".\n\nBut match organisers at the Delhi & District Cricket Association announced the sale of tickets on Wednesday in a sign they were pressing forward.\n\nDelhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said: \"I hope that pollution will not come in the way of cricket.\"\n\nSome residents also called for the cancellation of a six-kilometre run planned for Thursday to mark the anniversary of the birth of former home minister Sardar Patel, revered by ruling Hindu nationalists.\n\n\"You will be putting thousands of citizens in harm's way by making them run in this pollution,\" posted Brikesh, a Twitter user.\n\nThe CPCB index measures the concentration of tiny poisonous particulate matter that can be carried deep into the lungs, causing deadly diseases including cancer and cardiac problems.\n\n\"We are in a severe situation because there are no winds,\" Prashant Gargava, a top official at the CPCB told Reuters.\n\nThe city government has ordered the shutdown of construction activities and coal-based power plants. From next week, Delhi will restrict the use of private vehicles on the capital's roads under an \"odd-even\" scheme based on vehicle number plates.", "description": "Farm fires in nearby states have sent clouds of smoke over the city, posing a health risk to its 20 million residents.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/30/6a5976c480444ef798ccdd21a5b30487_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
