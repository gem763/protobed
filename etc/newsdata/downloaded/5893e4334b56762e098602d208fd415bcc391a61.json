Power was out for street signs, businesses and residents along Devonshire St. from Topanga Canyon Blvd. to Variel Ave. on Thursday, Oct. 10, 2019. (Dean Musgrove/The Orange County Register via AP)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Even as the winds gusted dangerously as forecast, California's biggest utility faced hostility and second-guessing Thursday for shutting off electricity to millions of people to prevent its equipment from sparking wildfires.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom criticized Pacific Gas & Electric and ordinary customers complained about the inconveniences caused by the unprecedented blackouts that began Wednesday, with many wondering: Did PG&E go too far in its attempt to ward off more deadly fires? Could the utility have been more targeted in deciding whose electricity was turned off and when?\n\nPG&E, though, suggested it was already seeing the wisdom of its decision borne out as gusts topping 77 mph (122 kph) raked the San Francisco Bay Area amid a bout of dry, windy weather.\n\n\"We have found multiple cases of damage or hazards\" caused by heavy winds, including fallen branches that came in contact with overhead lines, said Sumeet Singh, a vice president for the utility. \"If they were energized, they could've ignited.\"\n\nBecause of the dangerous weather in the forecast, PG&E cut power Wednesday to an estimated 2 million people in an area that spanned the San Francisco Bay Area, the wine country north of San Francisco, the agricultural Central Valley and the Sierra Nevada foothills. By Thursday evening, the weather had calmed and the number of people in the dark was down to about 510,000.\n\nInspections and repairs were expected to resume at daybreak and power could be restored Friday to many more customers, Singh said.\n\nPG&E cast the blackouts as a matter of public safety, aimed at preventing the kind of blazes that have killed scores of people over the past couple of years, destroyed thousands of homes, and ran up tens of billions of dollars in claims that drove the company into bankruptcy.\n\nCEO Bill Johnson didn't respond to Newsom's criticisms but promised if future wind events require similar shutoffs, the utility will \"do better\" when it comes to communicating with customers. It's unacceptable that its websites crashed, maps were inconsistent and call centers were overloaded, Johnson said.\n\n\"We were not adequately prepared,\" he said.\n\nThe fire danger spread to Southern California on Thursday as raging winds moved down the state. Southern California Edison shut off electricity to about 12,000 people just outside Los Angeles, with wider blackouts possible.\n\nA blaze ripped through a mobile home park in Calimesa, a city about 65 miles (104 kilometers) east of Los Angeles, destroying dozens of residences. The fire was started when trash being hauled caught fire and the driver dumped the load aside a road, according to Riverside County officials.\n\nMany of those affected by the outages, which could last as long as five days, were not so sure about the move.\n\nSergio Vergara, owner of Stinson Beach Market, situated on scenic Highway 1, on the Pacific Coast just north of San Francisco, operated the store with a propane generator so his customers could have coffee, milk, meat and frozen meals.\n\n\"I'm telling you as a plain human being, there is no wind, there is no heat,\" he said. \"We never saw something like this where they just decide to shut off the power, but on the other side \u2014 preventing is a good thing, but it's creating a lot of frustration.\"\n\nBut in powered-down Oakland, Tianna Pasche said: \"If it saves a life, I'm not going to complain about it.\"\n\nFaced with customer anger, PG&E put up barricades around its San Francisco headquarters. A customer threw eggs at a PG&E office in Oroville. And a PG&E truck was hit by a bullet, though authorities could not immediately say whether it was targeted.\n\nSumeet Singh, PG&E's vice president of community wildfire safety, urged people to be kind to workers out in the field, saying the employees and contractors \"have families that live in your communities.\"\n\n\"Let's just ensure their safety as well, as they are doing this work in the interest of your safety,\" Singh said.\n\nThe governor said PG&E was to blame for poor management and should have been working on making its power system sturdier and more weatherproof.\n\n\"It's decisions that were not made that is leading to this moment in PG&E history,\" Newsom said. \"This is not from my perspective a climate change story so much as it is a story of greed and mismanagement over the course of decades.\"", "description": "Even as the winds gusted dangerously as forecast, California's biggest utility faced hostility and second-guessing Thursday for shutting off electricity to millions of people to prevent its equipment from sparking wildfires.
