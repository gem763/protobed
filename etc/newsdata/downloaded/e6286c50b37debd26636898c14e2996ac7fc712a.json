It is also the least fascinating thing about A Million Little Pieces. The most captivating element of its existence is the noise that surrounds it \u2013 the accusations that it was largely faked, despite being marketed as a memoir, the literary-world war of words over its editing, and the piercing, terrifying glare of Oprah Winfrey, who elegantly destroyed Frey on live television over his apparent betrayal.\n\nThirteen years after that infamous Oprah interview, broadcast months after she had effusively praised Frey\u2019s book and turned it into a phenomenon via her book blub, A Million Little Pieces has been adapted into a film. It is a well-made and well-acted drama, brought to the screen by artist and filmmaker Sam Taylor-Johnson and her actor husband Aaron, who plays Frey, but curiously excludes everything about the book\u2019s post-publication journey. Outside of an opening quote from Mark Twain that reads \u201cI\u2019ve lived through some terrible things in my life, some of which actually happened\u201d, nothing untoward is even hinted at. It is therefore a more traditional addiction/rehabilitation film, one that brings to mind an important question: without acknowledging the literary forgery accusations that engulfed it, what actually is A Million Little Pieces anymore?\n\nPrior to its undoing, A Million Little Pieces existed as a brutally honest memoir about a man\u2019s journey from rock bottom to salvation. Frey was 17, addicted to a potentially lethal combination of cocaine, meth and nitrous oxide, wanted in three states on possession charges and with a face turned inside out after falling head-first down a fire escape. By the time he arrived at a Minnesota rehabilitation centre, he had four missing teeth and a hole in his cheek. Rehab proved sordid, surreal and ultimately healing, a collection of equally damaged and addicted characters providing colour and guidance to the young Frey. At 23, he turned his experiences into a book, earning $50,000 from his publishers at Doubleday, an imprint of Random House.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn an aside that reads as unintentionally funny in hindsight, Entertainment Weekly wrote that \u201cFrey doesn\u2019t come across as a guy who says outrageous things to get attention\u201d. A Million Little Pieces quickly emerged a hit, but it was elevated into the stratosphere by Winfrey, who endlessly promoted the book on her daytime talk show throughout the end of 2005 and helped it top The New York Times best seller list for 15 weeks in a row.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. 25 books that should have never been made into films Show all 26 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. 25 books that should have never been made into films 1/26 Warner Bros Pictures/Universal Pictures/New Line Cinema 2/26 Dune (1984) Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie \u2013 and David Lynch\u2019s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone. The director's adaptation is a nonsensical, deeply convoluted disaster that wastes an enjoyably oddball cast. It's the only one of Lynch's films the director has publicly disowned. Still, hopes are high that next year\u2019s version from Arrival director Denis Villeneuve, starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Zendaya, will somehow be better. Universal Pictures 3/26 The Bonfire of the Vanities (1990) Fresh off the success of bestselling novel The Bonfire of the Vanities, Warner Bros bought the rights from Tom Wolfe for a staggering $750,000. Tom Hanks and Melanie Griffiths were both (mis)cast in the lead roles after director Brian De Palma's preferred choices turned him down. The filmmaker himself struggled to spin the 1990 production's many plates amid reports of rising on-set troubles that were all witnessed and documented in Julie Salmon's follow-up book, The Devil's Candy. Warner Bros 4/26 Billy Bathgate (1991) 1991 gangster film Billy Bathgate, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Nicole Kidman, did no justice to EL Doctorow's beloved 1989 novel. With the efforts of Oscar-winning Kramer vs Kramer director Robert Benton and a script by Tom Stoppard, the film had all the ingredients to become as good as The Godfather, Scarface, and Goodfellas. Instead, it was a hollow adaptation, largely because all the magic was lost with the absence of the central character's narration \u2013 a huge reason behind the novel's success. Buena Vista Pictures 5/26 The Scarlet Letter (1995) The Scarlet Letter (1995) is ranked as one of the worst book adaptations ever made and for good reason. Described by DH Lawrence as \u201ca perfect work of the American imagination,\" the book was handed a Hollywood makeover that found itself the brunt of ridicule after flopping at the box office. Director Roland Joff\u00e9 strayed so far from Nathaniel Hawthorne's pages that what should have been an enticing romance became an extremely throwaway erotic drama. Buena Vista Pictures 6/26 Battlefield Earth (2000) To be fair, few would be able to turn L Ron Hubbard\u2019s allegedly Scientology-inspired Battlefield Earth (2000) into something decent. This John Travolta-with-dreadlocks epic has since gone down in \u201cWorst Movies Ever\u201d infamy, effectively ending Travolta\u2019s mainstream movie career and destroying Barry Pepper\u2019s before it even started. Warner Bros Pictures 7/26 Captain Corelli's Mandolin (2001) Louis de Berni\u00e8res's Captain Corelli's Mandolin was one of the biggest literary successes of the 1990s, but the 2001 film version \u2013 from the same British company that made Notting Hill \u2013 lost all traces of the novel's heart and soul. The dialogue is disastrous and lead stars Nicolas Cage (Captain Corelli) and Pen\u00e9lope Cruz (Pelagia) lack any chemistry. It may look pretty, but this adaptation was a complete mistake. Miramax Films 8/26 The Time Machine (2002) The beauty of HG Wells\u2019s 1895 science fiction novella The Time Machine was lost amid all the CGI in this insipid 2002 adaptation, which was directed by Wells's great-grandson, Simon. Everything featured, including Guy Pearce's lead performance, is wooden apart from the copper time travel contraption at the heart of the story. Warner Bros Pictures 9/26 Dreamcatcher (2003) There have been just as many disappointing Stephen King adaptations as there have been successful ones, but Dreamcatcher sits at the bottom of that list. The talent was present (Damian Lewis! Morgan Freeman! Timothy Olyphant!), but the end product never once correlates to anything at all decent. The film's late-stage swerve into monster movie territory is nothing short of dreadful. Warner Bros Pictures 10/26 Enduring Love (2004) Before he took on the role of 007, Daniel Craig starred in this adaptation of Ian McEwan\u2019s novel about people whose lives become entangled after witnessing a deadly accident. While Craig\u2019s performance as college lecturer Joe, along with Rhys Ifans as Jed \u2013 the man who becomes obsessed with him \u2013 are convincing, the film allows little time for character development and suffers because of it. Path\u00e9 Distribution 11/26 The Perfect Catch (2005) Nick Hornby adaptations don\u2019t inherently need to be set in the UK (the John Cusack-starring High Fidelity, if you like that sort of thing, is something of a classic, after all), but they do need to translate the fussy, infuriating male neuroses of his novels. The Perfect Catch is the 2005 US adaptation of Hornby\u2019s Fever Pitch, released a decade after Colin Firth starred in his own British adaptation, and transforms the source material into a more throwaway and uninteresting big-city romcom. Drew Barrymore, in a 'girlfriend\u2019 role significantly beefed up in comparison to Hornby\u2019s novel, is great, but watching her try and source chemistry with a shrill and unappealing Jimmy Fallon (in one of his rare, pre-talk show acting roles) is harrowing. 20th Century Fox 12/26 The Da Vinci Code (2006) The Da Vinci Code is a stinker of the highest order. Its sequels, Angels & Demons (2009) and Inferno (2016), are also awful films, but the reason the initial Dan Brown adaptation ranks as the worst is because the others wouldn't have existed had this one not been so successful. Sony Pictures Releasing 13/26 Eragon (2006) 20th Century Fox clearly wanted Eragon to be their answer to Harry Potter, but the terrible reviews stopped that plan dead in its tracks. Eragon is the worst kind of fantasy adaptation \u2013 one where all of the source materials' sense of fantastical vibrancy disappears during its translation to the big screen. 20th Century Fox 14/26 Running with Scissors (2006) Augusten Burroughs\u2019s Running with Scissors consistently walks a dangerous tightrope between manic farce and adolescent horror tale. Ryan Murphy\u2019s adaptation, released in 2006, collapses beneath such a task. You can see why Murphy, for his feature film debut, would be attracted to a tale of neurotic family dysfunction and sexual awakening as they are themes that crop up in many of his TV shows (Glee, American Horror Story, etc). But this adaptation is a tonal misfire from start to finish, despite the best efforts of an all-star cast that includes Annette Bening, Gwyneth Paltrow, Evan Rachel Wood and Brian Cox. It\u2019s no wonder this sunk without a trace. TriStar Pictures 15/26 The Golden Compass (2007) In another case of Hollywood throwing money at something in the belief that will be enough, Philip Pullman\u2019s superb His Dark Materials trilogy \u2013 or rather, the first book Northern Lights \u2013 was condensed into an agonising mess of CGI and hammy acting in 2007's The Golden Compass. Much of the blame went to the fact that Hollywood, where God is thanked above anyone else at the Oscars, would likely be uncomfortable handling material that was so critical of the Catholic church. It also suffered by trying to condense an overwhelming amount of information into the opening few scenes. A forthcoming BBC adaptation starring James McAvoy and Lin-Manuel Miranda looks far more promising. Entertainment Film Distributors 16/26 The Time Traveller's Wife (2009) Where to start with this disaster of a film? Audrey Niffenegger\u2019s The Time Traveller's Wife is beautifully and convincingly written, but there's nothing convincing about its adaptation. Producers thought casting two major Hollywood stars was a good idea, but Rachel McAdams and Eric Bana had zero chemistry. New Line Cinema 17/26 Cloud Atlas (2012) Cloud Atlas (2012) is by no means a disaster, but it's meandering plot lines, sketchy pacing and often questionable acting (Hanks has never been dodgier) do David Mitchell's sprawling, inventive novel a disservice. Still, it's an enjoyable Wachowskis romp that features Hugh Grant as a cannibal tribesman, so it has that going for it. Focus Features 18/26 The Hobbit (2012-2014) Fans of The Hobbit did not expect the novel, so short and sweet and set in such a familiar and adored world, to be messed up by The Lord of the Rings maestro Peter Jackson \u2013 but that\u2019s exactly what happened. While the trilogy of Hobbit films were a box-office success, they came under fire from critics for stretching the book's material too thin. Third outing, The Battle of Five Armies, was the worst received of all three. Warner Bros Pictures 19/26 The Book Thief (2013) The film adaptation of the profoundly moving and dark tale The Book Thief, which follows a young girl in Nazi Germany, is tonally off from the first scene. The glossy cinematography and excessively sentimental score jar with its grim subject matter and the performances verge on caricature. It doesn't help that all of the English dialogue is spoken with a German accent. 20th Century Fox 20/26 The Great Gatsby (2013) No adaptation of The Great Gatsby, F Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s most famous work, has managed to capture the excess, glamour and underlying sleaze of the roaring Twenties. Baz Luhrmann's 2013 version was fun and arguably the best at revealing the insecurities of (a brilliant) Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s Gatsby. However, the flashiness of the production stripped away all of Fitzgerald\u2019s delicate story-telling. Warner Bros Pictures 21/26 The Giver (2014) Disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein\u2019s fingerprints are all over this messy adaptation of Young Adult novel The Giver (2014), which attempts to fuse a sincere, thoughtful allegory with a Twilight-style love story backed up by action fresh from The Hunger Games and a Taylor Swift cameo. By attempting to appeal to every single teenager all at once, though, The Giver loses sight of its fascinating dystopian premise and gives its eccentric cast (among them Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd and Katie Holmes) very little to do. The Weinstein Company 22/26 Kill Your Friends (2015) John Niven's Kill Your Friends is a blistering, debauched exploration into the life of a cocaine-sniffing record label agent. It passes by in the blink of an eye, which can't be said for its adaptation. The film, released in 2015, tries so hard to nail what Niven achieves so fluidly and it shows \u2013 the result is nothing short of embarrassing with the clean-cut Nicholas Hoult failing to convince as the sociopathic Steven Stelfox. StudioCanal 23/26 The Girl on the Train (2016) Although it will always exist in the shadow of Gillian Flynn\u2019s ingenious thriller Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train is an undeniably pacy and intelligent novel. But it was completely let down by this US film adaptation. The 2016 release, starring Emily Blunt, is cheesy and lacking in nuance \u2013 and criminally takes the story away from its original gritty London setting, plonking the characters down in glossy New York for no apparent reason. Universal Pictures 24/26 Me Before You (2016) The 2016 adaptation of Me Before You, starring Emilia Clarke and Sam Claflin, was brutally panned by critics for being emotionally manipulative. Its bad acting and problematic premise didn't help, either. Clarke's performance as the paid companion to Claflin\u2019s quadriplegic was in particular criticised for being offensively exaggerated. Warner Bros Pictures 25/26 The Dark Tower (2017) While not the same calibre of flop as Dreamcatcher, The Dark Tower is a fine example of a botched attempt at adapting one of Stephen King's finest works. With Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey in the lead roles as the heroic and villainous characters caught in a fated tussle, it should have soared \u2013 but a rush job such as Nikolaj Arcel's 2017 film is no way to treat such an expansive piece of work. Sony Pictures Releasing 26/26 On Chesil Beach (2017) Despite magnetic performances from Saoirse Ronan and Billy Howle, this adaptation of Ian McEwan's On Chesil Beach was weighed down by a turgid script and clumsy old-age make-up. The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in \u2013 the Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007). Lionsgate 1/26 Warner Bros Pictures/Universal Pictures/New Line Cinema 2/26 Dune (1984) Dune was never going to be an easy book to turn into a two-hour action movie \u2013 and David Lynch\u2019s attempt is proof that it should be best left alone.

The finished product is worlds away from the McEwan adaptation that Ronan previously starred in \u2013 the Oscar-winning drama Atonement (2007). Lionsgate\n\nFrey additionally looked set to become a new kind of literary superstar, an obnoxiously overconfident and brash young writer with the acronym \u201cFTBSITTTD\u201d tattooed on his arm (standing for \u201cF*** The Bulls***, It\u2019s Time To Throw Down\u201d) and little good to say about his contemporaries (\u201cI don\u2019t give a f*** what Jonathan Safran whatever-his-name does or what David Foster Wallace does,\u201d Frey told the New York Observer in 2003). He was exhausting but undeniably exciting, a Charles Bukowski for the new millennium.\n\nBut there was also gloom on the horizon. In early 2006, the proto-TMZ site The Smoking Gun published evidence proving that a number of the book\u2019s claims were untrue \u2013 Frey didn\u2019t hit a police officer with his car and wasn\u2019t sentenced to 87 days in jail as a result, but rather he spent five hours in custody after earning two misdemeanour traffic tickets. His alleged involvement in a train accident that killed two teenage girls was similarly untrue, as were many of the relationships he claimed to have developed in rehab.\n\nBoth Frey and Winfrey initially shrugged off the allegations, Winfrey calling into Larry King\u2019s talk show to defend her new favourite memoirist. \u201cThe underlying message of redemption in James Frey\u2019s memoir still resonates with me, and I know it resonates with millions of people who have read this book,\u201d she said. \u201cTo me, it seems to be much ado about nothing.\u201d\n\nTwo weeks later, however, Winfrey\u2019s perspective had changed. Rather than continue to defend Frey, she decided to confront him in a televised special. Frey and his publisher Nan Talese have claimed that Winfrey and her producers had invited the pair onto the show under the pretence of talking about \u201ctruth in America\u201d, but they ended up walking into an ambush. Winfrey has always insisted that she was open about her intentions.\n\nIn front of a packed studio audience, Winfrey told Frey that he had \u201cbetrayed millions of readers\u201d and that she felt \u201cduped\u201d by the claims in his book. Frey confessed that many of the claims made by The Smoking Gun were true, and that he had falsified a number of experiences recounted in his book. \u201cI think one of the coping mechanisms I developed was sort of this image of myself that was greater than what I actually was,\u201d Frey said, by way of explanation. \u201cIn order to get through the experience of the addiction, I thought of myself as being tougher than I was and badder than I was and it helped me cope. When I was writing the book, instead of being as introspective as I should have been, I clung to that image.\u201d\n\nDespite Frey\u2019s apparent sincerity, Winfrey persevered in her line of questioning. \u201cI acted in defence of you and as I said, my judgment was clouded because so many people seemed to have gotten so much out of it,\u201d she told him. \u201cBut now I feel that you conned us all ... I think you presented a false person.\u201d\n\nIn the wake of Winfrey\u2019s confrontation, literary figures distanced themselves from Frey. He was dropped by his publisher and agent, and Warner Bros abandoned the film adaptation they had been prepping (Gus Van Sant was in negotiations to direct). But questions still remained about how much Frey was encouraged to embellish his own narrative, and whether Random House knew all along that Frey\u2019s \u201cmemoir\u201d was more fiction than fact.\n\nA Vanity Fair feature additionally alleged that Frey had been directed to exaggerate his story by one of his editors at Doubleday, and that Frey had expressed unease with the marketing of A Million Little Pieces as a memoir long before it had actually been published. \u201cI think of this book more as a work of art or literature than I do a work of memoir or autobiography,\u201d Frey wrote in an \u201cauthor\u2019s questionnaire\u201d used for marketing and publicity purposes in advance of publication. By the time all of this was unearthed, however, it had ceased to matter. Frey had already become persona non grata, hounded by photographers, jeered at by the public and scorned by Winfrey.\n\nIt was a scandal that, like the recent reappraisal of the rise and racism-assisted fall of Jade Goody, works as an unexpected time capsule of what constituted a pop culture crisis in the years immediately preceding Twitter. Just as Goody\u2019s racism towards Shilpa Shetty \u2013 in an era of Blairite delusion that the UK\u2019s problems with classism and racism were a thing of the past \u2013 appeared like something truly shocking, we couldn\u2019t quite believe that such a popular public figure had presented an untruth in the way Frey had. And to Oprah Winfrey no less. This was an era, after all, in which truth was considered sacred, and the idea of a figure not being entirely truthful about something warranted public flogging. Looked at today, such a horrified and angry reaction to a lie seems almost quaint.\n\n\u201cSome people think memoirs should be held to a perfect journalistic standard,\u201d Frey told The Guardian in 2006. \u201cSome people don\u2019t. Obviously I don\u2019t. My goal was never to create or to write a perfect journalistic standard of my life. It was always to be as literature. I thought in doing that it was OK to take certain licences. To tell a story effectively you manipulate information ... I think that if stories were told always exactly as they really happened most of them would be really boring.\u201d\n\nFrey did recover somewhat, working on increasingly poorly-reviewed follow-up books (all fiction, it should be noted), and setting up his own young-adult publishing company that was accused by New York Magazine in 2010 of taking advantage of aspiring student writers. And A Million Little Pieces continued to sell, only with an apologetic author\u2019s note tacked onto the front and book stores recategorising it as fiction. Winfrey, too, came around, revealing in 2011 that, after years of meditation, she felt she had initially been too hard on Frey in 2006 and sought his forgiveness. But Frey\u2019s continued survival has also bred a number of questions in itself \u2013 are we still too forgiving of wealthy white men when they happen to be great artists? And does the undeniable power of A Million Little Pieces override the fact that elements of it never actually happened?\n\nThere\u2019s still much to admire about A Million Little Pieces, in its stream-of-consciousness energy and drug-fuelled gnarliness, while the questions it provokes today about fact and fiction and Frey\u2019s downfall almost enhance its power. So much, in fact, that on film it feels like something is missing. That Taylor-Johnson chose to dramatise the version of James Frey that more-or-less existed years before he became a literary villain isn\u2019t a travesty, but it feels like a missed opportunity. Because the post-scandal Frey is compelling in a slightly more interesting way than the addict described on the page, a man who is simply frustrating and vaguely reprehensible. Taylor-Johnson\u2019s A Million Little Pieces is solid and moving and depicts addiction at its most raw and unflinching, but it also cuts to the credits just when things get interesting.", "description": "James Frey\u2019s A Million Little Pieces is a sprawling and manic novel about addiction, survival and redemption.
