The mother, Anne Georgulas, contends that James is a girl and calls him Luna.\n\nYounger and Georgulas were married in 2010 and later decided to have children through in vitro fertilization (IVF). They requested male children through the IVF process that was successful, and their twin boys were born in 2012.\n\nGet Your First Month of Unlimited Access for Free Get started today for free and become the most informed Texan you know \u2014 after your first month, it's just $9.00. Subscribe Now\n\nBecause of a family tradition to name the male children with the initials \u201cJ.D.Y.,\u201d and because of the biblical reference to the brothers of Jesus, Younger and Georgulas decided to name the children James and Jude. At the time, both parents were members of the Orthodox Church.\n\nConflict arose in the next few years and their marriage was eventually annulled. While the court made the parents joint managing conservators, Georgulas was given exclusive rights and duties, while Younger\u2019s were limited.\n\nGeorgulas said that James first wanted a girls\u2019 toy from McDonald\u2019s and soon after started imitating the female characters from Disney\u2019s Frozen and asking to wear dresses.\n\nShe said she contacted the GENecis clinic at Children\u2019s Hospital Center, and they referred her to Rebekka Ouer for counseling. Ouer recommended a process of \u201caffirmation\u201d and thought that a \u201csocial transition\u201d for James to begin going to school dressed as a girl named \u201cLuna\u201d would be in his best interest.\n\nWhen the father learned that Georgulas was \u201csocially transitioning\u201d James, it wasn\u2019t long before their disputes escalated.\n\nYounger is being represented by Logan Odeneal, while Georgulas has a legal team consisting of at least five people, with lawyers Jessica Janicek and Laura Hayes leading the questioning of witnesses.\n\nIn this case, the court also appointed an amicus attorney, Stacy Dunlop, to represent the best interests of the child from a more neutral perspective.\n\nPresiding over the hearing is Judge Kim Cooks of the 255th Family District Court.\n\nAlthough all parties have personally interacted with one another in a civil and professional manner, tensions have been noticeably high throughout the proceedings.\n\nThe intensity of the case was made clear on the onset by Janicek\u2019s opening statement on behalf of the mother.\n\nShe began with a PowerPoint slide stating there were \u201ctwo paths of parenting.\u201d One, she argued, was Georgulas\u2019 parenting characterized as loving, following recommendations of mental health professionals, actively trying to co-parent, and valuing privacy.\n\nAs the second path, she characterized Younger as insensitive, refusing to follow all recommendations, having no desire to co-parent, and exploiting the situation to use it as a political platform.\n\nWhile Janicek\u2019s characterizations were clearly biased, she was not wrong to assert that the case is about \u201ctwo paths of parenting.\u201d\n\nBut from the witnesses that have testified, those two paths are not about which parent loves their children, but are ultimately about the conflicting worldview behind their professed love.\n\nGeorgulas and Younger have responded quite differently to James\u2019 instances of expressed femininity.\n\nGeorgulas wants to take steps of \u201caffirmation\u201d to his alleged female identity. Younger wants to take an approach of \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d by not prompting a \u201csocial transition\u201d for James to present himself as a girl.\n\nThe mother argues that James is transgender and has \u201cgender dysphoria,\u201d a condition that he has been diagnosed with by three mental health professionals, while the father suggests that his son is experiencing some confusion about his gender that will be resolved with time if left alone.\n\nFor his part, Dunlop has taken a somewhat atypical ground that James is simply \u201cgender fluid,\u201d and that he should continue to be treated as both a boy and a girl depending on how he feels.\n\nGeorgulas\u2019 Arguments\n\nJanicek and Hayes have argued that because he has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, James is probably a girl \u2014 \u201ctrapped inside a boy\u2019s body,\u201d as transgender activists would explain \u2014 who should be called \u201cLuna.\u201d\n\nThe witnesses called to testify by the mother\u2019s lawyers who knew James \u2014 except for Younger \u2014 all stated that at some point, independent of his mother, James told them that he wanted to be called \u201cLuna\u201d and referred to as a girl.\n\nDr. Benjamin Albritton was one of the first witnesses to speak. Being paid to testify by the mother, Albritton was the custody evaluator who spent over half a year writing a report that diagnosed James with gender dysphoria and recommended Georgulas\u2019 approach of \u201caffirmation\u201d and initiating a social transition.\n\nAlbritton said that James expressed anxiety about \u201chaving to be a boy\u201d when around his father and that he prefers his mother\u2019s home because she lets him \u201cbe whatever he wants to be.\u201d\n\nRebekka Ouer, James\u2019 therapist and the founder of Dallas Rainbow Counseling, also diagnosed James with gender dysphoria and argued for the \u201caffirmation\u201d approach.\n\nShe claimed that during therapy sessions with James, she would write the names \u201cJames\u201d and \u201cLuna\u201d on sticky notes and let him pick what he wanted to be each time he met with her. Ouer said that he chose \u201cLuna\u201d for every session except once when Younger brought him to it.\n\nJanicek and Hayes have also made a point to emphasize that the mother is not seeking a medical transition, including puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones \u2014 a treatment that Younger is concerned will be given in the near future.\n\nPuberty blockers are used to block the production of testosterone or estrogen to delay or prevent the development of secondary sex characteristics (e.g. facial hair, voice, breasts, etc.).\n\nCross-sex hormone therapy is used next to administer testosterone to females or estrogen to males in an attempt to induce the development of secondary sex characteristics of their opposite biological sex. Transgender individuals must continue this treatment for life.\n\nDr. Daniel Shumer, an endocrinologist (a doctor specializing in hormones) called by the mother\u2019s lawyers to testify, said that puberty blockers are used \u201cto buy some time\u201d for those at the start of puberty so that they and their parents can decide if a full medical transition should be made.\n\nShumer said that puberty blockers are only ever first used at the beginning of puberty, which for boys is marked by the \u201cTanner stages of sexual development\u201d and not age. He said that on average, this occurs around age 11 \u00bd for boys.\n\nAlthough Janicek and Hayes argued that the mother did not intend to use puberty blockers prior to puberty, no one has stated that she would not be open to using them when James begins puberty.\n\nWhen Georgulas testified on Friday, she said that she understood a \u201csocial transition\u201d is usually followed by a \u201cmedical transition\u201d using puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones.\n\nThe mother\u2019s legal team also consistently argued that the \u201caffirmation\u201d approach is in the best interest of the child.\n\nHayes has argued that being transgender is not a choice, but is as pre-determined by birth as a child with Down syndrome.\n\nOuer echoed this sentiment when she stated, \u201cGender is in the brain,\u201d and, \u201cit\u2019s not that you [a male] think you\u2019re a girl, you are one.\u201d\n\nAssuming that James\u2019 transgender identity is not something that he can choose, Georgulas wants to take steps to encourage him to express that he \u201cis a girl\u201d so that his discomfort in \u201cbeing trapped in a boy\u2019s body\u201d is minimalized.\n\nOf course, this assumption is logically inconsistent with the statement from another one of Geogrulas\u2019 witnesses, Dr. Abel Tomatis, who said that \u201cgender is a social construct.\u201d Such a view makes it possible that there are factors in James\u2019 environment influencing whether he is transgender or not and that those factors could potentially be controlled.\n\nInterestingly, Dunlop revealed that Georgulas told him that \u201cLuna\u201d was not the first female name that James picked out. The first was \u201cStarfire,\u201d a female character from the superhero cartoon Teen Titans Go! Georgulas, however, encouraged him to pick a different name.\n\nOuer said that Georgulas\u2019 decision was wise, because even though affirmation is good, there were still some reasonable limits. No clear method of determining those reasonable efforts was suggested.\n\nYounger\u2019s Arguments\n\nOdeneal has countered his opponent\u2019s argument that James is a girl with two important points: first, that James is happy to be a boy when he is with his father; and second, that James does not meet the criteria to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria and therefore should not be treated as such.\n\nOn the first point, two family friends called to the stand by Odeneal have testified that James is happy to be a boy and always refers to himself as \u201cJames.\u201d\n\nOne friend who testified has several grandchildren and said that James enjoys playing with those boys. When they go swimming, she said that they all wear boys\u2019 swimming suits \u2014 even when a girl\u2019s swimming suit is available.\n\nShe said that in multiple craft projects, James willingly and without hesitation signed his name as \u201cJames.\u201d When he created a statue out of foil, he gave it male characteristics even after she suggested some female characteristics that he could add to it.\n\nAnother friend, a deacon at Younger\u2019s church, also confirmed that James always presents himself as a boy when he is with his father.\n\nBoth witnesses \u2014 as well as all of the mother\u2019s witnesses who know James \u2014 testified that James has not displayed any signs of distress. Everyone described him as a bright, happy, outgoing child.\n\nAs Odeneal repeatedly pointed out, this contradicts one of the two requirements for gender dysphoria according to the DSM-V, the current manual used by the American Psychiatric Association.\n\nAccording to the DSM-V, a child with gender dysphoria must display six of eight certain characteristics relating to their gender expression or feelings (e.g. what clothes they like to wear, if they insist that they are the opposite gender, etc.) and they must display distress associated with those characteristics.\n\nThose who testified \u2014 and even those who diagnosed James with gender dysphoria \u2014 said that he has not displayed any such distress.\n\nOdeneal has also repeatedly contended that Georgulas does intend to pursue a medical gender transition for James, citing medical records that note James would be referred to doctors at the GENecis clinic for puberty suppression once he reached eight or nine years old.\n\nWhen these notes were presented to Albritton, he said that he had seen them before but did not include them in his final report for the court because he did not think it seemed relevant.\n\nDr. Stephen Levine, a psychiatrist who specializes in human sexuality and has been working in the field for several decades, was called to the stand by Odeneal.\n\nHe testified that eleven studies had been completed showing that when an approach of \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d is taken without any affirmation or social transition, \u201cdesistance\u201d (identifying with the gender of one\u2019s biological sex) occurred in around 80 to 90 percent of cases after children thought to be transgender continue developing throughout adolescence.\n\nAlthough the scientific evidence is lacking because the method is so new, Levine also said that \u201caffirmation\u201d could quite likely have a significant contribution to \u201cpersistence\u201d (continuing to identify with the opposite gender of one\u2019s biological sex).\n\nLevine said that unlike transgender activists who argue that gender dysphoria is biologically caused and something you are born with, there is no evidence for that position. Instead, he said it could be partly caused by biology, but that research suggests there are also psychological, cultural, and interpersonal relationship factors.\n\nHe also noted that a study in Sweden found that the suicide rate in the transgender population of those who had a medical transition was 19 times higher than the rest of the population.\n\nFurthermore, he said that transgender individuals receiving hormone treatment have a life expectancy twenty years shorter than the average person.\n\nBecause of these long term risks associated with persistence, Levine said desistance was preferable, even if it means that a child will not receive the immediate benefit of feeling loved by affirmation.\n\nAs a result, \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d would be the prudent approach, since it leads to desistance in the majority of cases. Taking an \u201caffirmation\u201d approach is experimental, he said, and has a strong possibility of leading to the negative outcomes he mentioned.\n\nPaul Hruz, an endocrinologist who was Odeneal\u2019s witness, reinforced Levine\u2019s testimony, saying that there are some studies \u2014 though few, since the approach is fairly new \u2014 that suggest \u201caffirmation\u201d makes persistence more likely.\n\nHruz directly contradicted Shumer\u2019s claim that puberty blockers are meant to \u201cbuy some time,\u201d saying the argument had no scientific backing, but that puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones present more dangers than simply delaying development.\n\nFor boys given estrogen, he said high risks include sterility, an increased likelihood of strokes, and undeveloped bone density that would probably lead to osteoporosis.\n\nLike Levine, Hruz said that because of the long term risks with persistence and the harms caused by medical transition, desistance is the preferable outcome.\n\nHe argued that \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d was the best way to treat any child experiencing gender identity problems, since the rate of desistance was so high with that careful approach.\n\nThe jury\u2019s decision next week will be made in large part based on their view of which approach to any confusion of gender that James has displayed is best: is it wiser to \u201caffirm\u201d him as a girl to make him feel love despite the long term dangers that approach could have, or is it wiser to practice \u201cwatchful waiting,\u201d which in the overwhelming majority of cases leads to desistance and avoids the dangers of transitioning?", "description": "A Dallas jury will determine whether or not seven-year-old boy James Younger is raised as a girl or as his biological sex in a potentially monumental court case.", "authors": ["Daniel Friend", "Mckenzie Taylor", "Brad Johnson"], "top_image": "https://thetexan.news/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/James.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
