She bends the green stalks and, with long, careful fingers, peels off the exterior skin to expose the succulent inside.\n\nBiologist Jean Paul Hirwa notes her meal on his tablet computer as he peers out from behind a nearby stand of stinging nettles.\n\nThe large adult male sitting next to her, known as a silverback, looks at him quizzically. Hirwa makes a low hum \u2014 \"ahh-mmm\" \u2014 imitating the gorillas' usual sound of reassurance.\n\n\"I'm here,\" Hirwa is trying to say. \"It's OK. No reason to worry.\"\n\nHirwa and the two great apes are all part of the world's longest-running gorilla study \u2014 a project begun in 1967 by famed American primatologist Dian Fossey.\n\nYet Fossey herself, who died in 1985, would likely be surprised any mountain gorillas are still left to study. Alarmed by rising rates of poaching and deforestation in central Africa, she predicted the species could go extinct by 2000.\n\nGorilla trackers search for members of the Agasha group in Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda.

Last fall, the Switzerland-based International Union for Conservation of Nature changed the status of mountain gorillas from \"critically endangered\" to \"endangered,\" an improved if still-fragile designation.\n\nIt wouldn't have happened without an intervention some biologists call \"extreme conservation,\" which has entailed monitoring every single gorilla in the rainforest, periodically giving them veterinary care and funding forest protection by sending money into communities that might otherwise resent not being able to convert the woods into cropland.\n\nInstead of decreasing, the number of mountain gorillas \u2014 a subspecies of eastern gorillas \u2014 has risen from 680 a decade ago to just over 1,000 today. The population is split between two regions, including mist-covered defunct volcanoes within Congo, Uganda and Rwanda \u2014 one of Africa's smallest and most densely populated countries.\n\n\"The population of mountain gorillas is still vulnerable,\" says George Schaller, a renowned biologist and gorilla expert. \"But their numbers are now growing, and that's remarkable.\"\n\nChildren watch a drone flying near Volcanoes National Park in Kinigi, Rwanda. In 2005, the government adopted a model to steer 5 percent of tourism revenue from Volcanoes National Park to build infrastructure in surrounding villages, including schools and health clinics. Two years ago, the share was raised to 10 percent.

Their strength and chest-thumping displays are generally reserved for contests between male rivals.\n\nEvery week, scientists like Hirwa, who works for the nonprofit conservation group the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, gather data as part of long-term behavioral research.\n\nIf they see any health problems in the gorillas, they inform the staff at Gorilla Doctors, a nongovernmental group whose veterinarians work in the forest. The vets monitor wounds and signs of respiratory infections, but intervene only sparingly.\n\nWhen they do, they almost never remove the animals from the mountain.\n\nA silverback mountain gorilla named Segasira lies under a tree in Volcanoes National Park, Rwanda.
