It will make the country poorer and threatens jobs and livelihoods.\n\nWorse still, it will allow the Conservatives to roll back hard-won protections for workers and paves the way for American firms to sell us hormone-raised beef and chlorinated chicken and to enter the NHS.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nThe right to paid holidays, protections for part-time and temporary staff and basic health and safety standards are all at risk.\n\nThis is worse than Theresa May\u2019s deal and worse than what we have at present.

It can transform a child\u2019s life and bring joy to their adoptive parents.\n\nThis week National Adoption Week \u00adcelebrates these families.\n\nBut it is also a reminder that there are far more children in need of adoption than there are adults able to offer them a home.", "description": "The only thing in Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Brexit deal's favour is that it isn't a no deal", "authors": ["Voice Of The Mirror", "Image", "Getty Images", "Pa", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20644598.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Leaders-Attend-European-Council-Meeting.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
