Incredible footage.'\n\n'Oh my gosh wow. I had no idea they could swim like that. Amazing,' another person said.\n\nAnother said: 'That\u2019s got to be a once in a lifetime thing.'\n\nThe female shark emerges from the water and swims upside down for several seconds with her large mouth wide open before flipping over and diving under the water\n\nSharks are not known to swim upside down, but on rare occasions, they will flip over to assume a position known as tonic immobility.\n\nTonic immobility is a natural state of paralysis sharks enter by stimulating the tiny sensory pores located on their snout, according to conservation group Shark Trust.\n\nScientists are not entirely sure why sharks enter tonic immobility, but some suggest it may be related to mating.", "description": "The footage was filmed by a guest on a trip in the Neptune Islands in Port Lincoln off the coast of South Australia in early October.", "authors": ["Thomas Duff For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/01/20231930-0-image-a-27_1572141195072.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
