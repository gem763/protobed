(Newspapers.com/Allentown Morning Call/AP)\n\nHe left a note saying he skipped town to clear his head, but Sharon Via knew her husband had run off with the go-go dancer.\n\nLarry Via was a wannabe musician stuck working at a molding company. He\u2019d been hanging around the Cleveland bars more often lately, trying to sell his amateur poetry as lyrics to rock bands coming through town that spring of 1972. But, Sharon told the Akron Beacon-Journal that year, \u201cI guess that\u2019s where he met Charmaine.\u201d\n\nHe left Sharon in the middle of the night on May 11, 1972, and hopped in Charmaine\u2019s \u201968 Cadillac Deville, the beginning of a summer of mayhem that would span three states. The pair stopped at a bar in Bowling Green, Ky., where Charmaine bought a gun for $50.\n\nBy the end of the summer, two people would be dead. A third, a gas station attendant, would miraculously survive a bullet to the head \u2014 living to identify his attackers to police as they tracked down Via and Charmaine. Via alone went to prison for life for the rape and murder of a 19-year-old woman who picked him up on the side of the road, while Charmaine was convicted of assisting in other robberies.\n\nBut it would take police 47 years to connect Via to the second murder victim. The help came in an unusual form. As Via sat in prison, he kept trying his hand at poetry. This time, he found a buyer: Outlaw Biker and Easyriders magazines. To police today, his stories sounded a lot closer to the facts of an actual crime than the racy fiction that the \u201980s pornographic magazines claimed them to be.\n\nNow, after decades of a cold investigation, the outlaw poetry is evidence against Via in the killing of 29-year-old Morgan Peters \u2015 the final piece of the 1972 crime rampage that wreaked havoc on dark U.S. highways. Still in prison for the 19-year-old\u2019s murder, the now-75-year-old Via has been indicted on first- and second-degree murder charges in Peters\u2019s death, the Franklin County District Attorney\u2019s Office announced Friday.\n\nAn attorney for Via could not be immediately located.\n\n\n\nOhio inmate Larry Via's decades-old outlaw poetry is being used as evidence against him in the killing of 29-year-old Morgan Peters in 1972. (Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction/AP)\n\nSharon Via always remembered her then-husband, whom she called Jody, as a bookworm. It was part of the reason that when she found out he was wanted for the murder of a 19-year-old Ohio University student and for a nearly fatal armed robbery in 1972, she didn\u2019t think the charges jibed with his character. She said Jody \u201ckept swearing he didn\u2019t do it,\u201d and at the time, Sharon believed him.\n\n\u201cJody is a quiet person,\u201d she told the Beacon-Journal then. \u201cHe loved to read \u2014 travel books and Hemingway. \u2026 My first husband was just the opposite, drinking and fighting. You might expect this of him. But not Jody.\"\n\nFour decades later, Via\u2019s two ex-wives would lead police to the magazines that published at least nine pieces he wrote in the 1980s under the name \u201cJody Via\u201d \u2014 stories that now appear to describe three fatal or near-fatal crimes, according to the probable cause affidavit.\n\nThe magazines are the kind you might pick up in a grimy pool hall bathroom, promising \u201cbikes, broads and boogie,\u201d as well as \u201cbig ones, little ones and everything in between straight from the female chests of America,\u201d at least inside Outlaw Biker in 1985. Wedged between those pages was Jody Via\u2019s byline \u2014 for example, beneath the story \u201cPayback in Full.\"\n\nIt involved a woman tying up a crime victim, according to the affidavit. And her actions, in the eyes of police today, sounded all too similar to those of Via\u2019s partner in crime in the summer of 1972: Charmaine Bouvar, now Phillips.\n\nHarvey Hoffman couldn\u2019t forget their faces. On the night of Sept. 4, 1972, he saw them pulled over on the side of an Ohio highway, each with long blond hair, and he got out to see what was wrong. The man, Via, said they were out of gas.\n\n\u201cI told him, \u2018You stopped the right guy. I own a gas station,'\" Hoffman recalled to the Beacon-Journal that year. Hoffman told them to get in his car and he\u2019d take them there.\n\n\u201cI invited them inside and made us all coffee,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cThat\u2019s when he said he really wasn\u2019t there for the gas. He was here for the money.\"\n\nVia pulled out a gun \u2014 the little pistol Charmaine bought in Bowling Green \u2014 and Hoffman immediately handed over the cash, $62 in all. Then, Hoffman recalled, \u201cHe said he needed my car keys, and that he had to tie me up in the backroom.\u201d\n\nCharmaine did the tying. Via told him to lie down on the ground.\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t worried until he told me to turn my head to the wall,\u201d Hoffman said. \u201cHe said, \u2018So long,\u2019 and I said, \u2018Goodbye.\u2019 There was a long pause. Then he shot me.\u201d\n\nPolice arrived to find Hoffman pacing around the store with a bullet in his head.\n\nAnother biker story was titled \u201cMoonlit Ride,\u201d an alleged piece of fiction that police now believe echoes the murder of 19-year-old Jane Maguire.\n\nIn that real-life case, Via posed as a hitchhiker on the side of an Ohio highway. Maguire picked him up on Sept. 20. Two days later, she was found dead at an Ohio highway rest stop, bound with her boot laces and shot twice in the back of the head and once in the back. The bullets matched the one pulled from Hoffman, who had already identified Via as the triggerman in his case.\n\nAfter going on the run, Via was arrested in November 1972 at his wife\u2019s house. He was found with two wallets and a little portable Panasonic radio in his suitcase. One wallet was his own. The other one, containing a business card for a shop near the Pennsylvania Turnpike, was possibly Morgan Peters\u2019s, police now believe.\n\nThat\u2019s where the third piece of biker poetry enters the record.\n\nAs Via sat in prison for Maguire\u2019s murder, he wrote the poem \u201cDANGEROUS DAVE\u201d for the September 1985 issue of Outlaw Biker. It\u2019s about a \u201chitchhiker cutie\u201d who baits a nice man into pulling over on the side of the road, only to be ambushed by an armed man hiding in the tree line, Fox 43 reported. Like the others, it sounds a lot like the type of thing that could have happened to the 29-year-old wrestling mat salesman in the summer of \u201972, police now believe.\n\nIt was about 2 a.m. when Peters encountered a car pulled over on the side of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. He was on a business trip, headed to New York to install gym equipment, according to the Morning Call archives. But he would never make it. His body was discovered 18 miles from his pickup truck. Police found he was missing his wallet \u2014 and a little portable Panasonic radio, AP reported.\n\nWhen the Pennsylvania State Police reopened the investigation into Peters\u2019s death in 2009, they asked Charmaine if she could remember traveling with Via along the Pennsylvania Turnpike, where Peters was found dead. She said yes.\n\nShe told them about their \u201cruse\u201d that summer, how they\u2019d pull over on the side of the road, pretending to be out of gas or needing to hitch a ride, and wait for an unsuspecting Good Samaritan to pull up behind them offering to help, Franklin County Free Press reported. She couldn\u2019t remember how many times they did it, but there was always one incident that stood out in her mind in September 1972, she said.\n\nShe and Via were driving on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in her Cadillac with her two poodles late at night when Via told her to pull over. They were in \u201cthe middle of nowhere,\u201d she said. They sat there until a vehicle pulled up behind them.\n\nThe man got out, and so did Via.\n\nCharmaine told police she didn\u2019t know what happened during the encounter. She couldn\u2019t recall hearing any gunshots, she said. All she remembered was Via running back to the car and saying, \u201cWe got to go!\u201d Via then got in the victim\u2019s truck, and they each drove separately, Charmaine told police.\n\nShe drove back Cleveland. Via allegedly abandoned the truck somewhere on the turnpike.\n\nTwo days later, he hitched a ride with a young Ohio University student.", "description": "A wannabe songwriter went on a crime rampage with a go-go dancer in 1972.
