Macy have been relatively tight-lipped on how Operation Varsity Blues and Huffman\u2019s impending sentencing have affected their family. We\u2019ve witnessed some sad balloon shopping and your standard pleading out, but not much else to go on. Letters by Huffman and Macy to the judge presiding over her case offer the most illuminating glimpse to date into just what the hell Huffman was thinking and what the fallout has looked like.\n\nOn Friday, in her letter to the judge, Huffman framed her decision to pay college admissions consultant Rick Singer $15,000 to falsify her daughter\u2019s SAT score as the unfortunate fate of a woman trying to be a good mother. To wit:\n\n\u201cIn my desperation to be a good mother I talked myself into believing that all I was doing was giving my daughter a fair shot. I see the irony in that statement now because what I have done is the opposite of fair. I have broken the law, deceived the educational community, betrayed my daughter, and failed my family.\u201d\n\nProsecutors have recommended as Huffman\u2019s restitution one month in prison, a $20,000 fine, and a year of supervised release. Huffman\u2019s legal team has countered with a suggestion of probation, a $20,000 fine, and 250 hours of community service.\n\n\u201cI honestly didn\u2019t and don\u2019t care about my daughter going to a prestigious college,\u201d Huffman added, implausibly. \u201cI didn\u2019t want my daughter to be prevented from getting a shot at auditioning and doing what she loves because she can\u2019t do math.\u201d Honestly, nothing would be funnier to me than if all the rich parents linked to the college admissions scandal penned an open letter condemning the real culprit: math.\n\nIn his letter to the judge, Macy wrote that as a result of the scandal Huffman\u2019s relationship \u201cwith her daughters exploded.\u201d He continued, \u201cRebuilding that relationship will be a long process. But I also want you to know Felicity has raised two amazing young women.\u201d Macy wrote that their 19-year-old daughter Sophia \u201chas nightmares from the FBI agents waking her that morning with guns drawn,\u201d referring to mass arrests in March of 33 parents in Manhattan and Los Angeles who were implicated in the admissions scandal.\n\nMacy also insisted that the unnamed school his daughter applied to, \u201cironically, doesn\u2019t require SAT scores.\u201d But the reality, as we all know, is that every bit helps.", "description": "Felicity Huffman said in a letter to the judge presiding over her sentencing in the college admissions scandal that she thought at the time she was giving her daughter a \u201cfair shot.\u201d", "authors": ["Hannah Gold"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/10/10-felicity-huffman.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
