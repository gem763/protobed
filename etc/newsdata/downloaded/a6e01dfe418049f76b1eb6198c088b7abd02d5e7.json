BABA 0.62% , the nearly half-trillion-dollar online-shopping giant that he co-founded in an apartment in this southern Chinese city two decades ago. For his third act, the former English teacher plans to return to education, where he wants to focus his philanthropic energies.\n\nMr. Ma\u2019s departure will leave an absence atop China\u2019s corporate world, where for years he cut a charismatic figure as the most recognizable business leader. Mr. Ma won fame inside and outside the country for his brash proclamations; at the company\u2019s annual mass wedding ceremony for employees this year, he encouraged couples not only to work 72 hours a week, but also to spend their free time procreating.\n\nBy contrast, his peers among the Chinese tech giants\u2014and his successor as Alibaba executive chairman, current Chief Executive Daniel Zhang \u2014are far less flamboyant. \u201cHe\u2019s the face of Chinese business overseas and domestically, too,\u201d said Duncan Clark, the Beijing-based author of \u201cAlibaba: The House that Jack Ma Built\u201d and an early investor in the company. \u201cNow he\u2019s aspiring to be the face of philanthropy, environmentalism and education, and with that the subtext of how tech can be a force for good.\u201d As the Chinese government under President Xi Jinping shifts to promoting state-owned enterprises while tightening oversight of privately run ones, it is making business leaders nervous about becoming too visible, Mr. Clark said. \u201cThe conditions are not ripe now for another individual icon to emerge.\u201d Mr. Ma has slowly transitioned out of Alibaba leadership. He resigned as chief executive in 2013 and gave notice a year ago that he would depart as chairman. Unlike Bill Gates, who dove into charity work after leaving Microsoft Corp. , Mr. Ma will keep a hand in tech. He plans to remain on an Alibaba governing board and is, in his personal capacity, the controlling shareholder of Ant Financial, a sister company of Alibaba that provides digital-payment services. Mr. Ma for years has spoken about and pledged money to causes focused on environmental conservation, wildlife preservation and climate change, going so far as to criticize the state of pollution in China. More recently, he spoke at a women\u2019s conference about increasing female participation in developing technology. In a letter to shareholders and employees last year, Mr. Ma said no one person could be chairman or chief executive forever \u201cbecause of the physical limits on one\u2019s ability and energy.\u201d But he added that he \u201cstill had a lot of dreams to pursue\u201d and wanted \u201cto return to education, which excites me with so much blessing because this is what I love to do.\u201d Alibaba employees expect their leader to go out on an extravagant note. To celebrate Mr. Ma\u2019s birthday and retirement on Tuesday, tens of thousands of employees will flock to a stadium in Hangzhou to mark the company\u2019s 20th anniversary. Previous anniversary parties have featured celebrity cameos and even a performance by Mr. Ma himself, who appeared on stage dressed and dancing like Michael Jackson.
