(AP) \u2014 Anthony Gordon passed for 369 yards and four touchdowns and Washington State rolled over Colorado 41-10 on Saturday, snapping the Cougars' three-game losing streak.\n\nGordon threw a 4-yard TD pass to Max Borghi and a 22-yarder to Dezmon Patmon in the first quarter as the Cougars (4-3, 1-3 Pac-12) jumped to a 14-0 lead, scored touchdowns on their first three drives and cruised to a needed victory. Gordon was 35-of-51 passing and connected with eight different receivers.\n\nThe WSU defense was excellent after weeks of getting of getting shredded. Colorado was limited to 320 total yards and quarterback Steven Montez was intercepted twice.\n\nBorghi was also outstanding on the ground, rushing for 105 yards, including a 47-yard touchdown run late in the first quarter that gave the Cougars a 21-3 lead.\n\nMontez was 16-of-30 passing for 129 yards. Alex Fontenot had 11 carries for 105 yards, but the Buffaloes' only touchdown came on Laviska Shenault Jr.'s 6-yard TD run in the third quarter that pulled Colorado (3-4, 1-3) within 24-10.\n\nBut Gordon responded with a 44-yard TD pass to Brandon Arconado and hit Tay Martin for a 1-yard TD early in the fourth quarter.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nColorado: The Buffaloes lost their third straight and could not get off the field on third downs, continuing a season-long issue. Washington State converted 7-of-14 third downs. The Buffaloes were giving up 49% on third down entering the game.\n\nWashington State: The Cougars were giving up 47.7 points per game in conference play, but didn't allow Colorado out of its own territory on seven of its final nine drives. The Buffaloes have five drives of three plays or less.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nColorado: The Buffaloes host Southern California on Friday.\n\nWashington State: The Cougars travel to No. 12 Oregon next Saturday.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
