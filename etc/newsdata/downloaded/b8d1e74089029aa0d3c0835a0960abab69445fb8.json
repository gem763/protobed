And the comics keep digging through the muck. They explain the latest in today's webisode.\n\nWould you question the patriotism of a Purple Heart recipient? If you work for Fox News, the answer is yes. At least if that recipient is Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman.\n\nThe Army officer and White House aide earned a Purple Heart after getting hit by a roadside bomb in Iraq. Doesn't get much more patriotic than that, right?\n\nWell not so fast. In the eyes of Trump supporters, Vindman made one fatal mistake \u2014 complaining about President Donald Trump's call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky. Vindman, who was born in Ukraine, was on the call (during which Trump pressured Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a rival for the 2020 White House) and said it was his duty to speak up about what he saw as a breach of ethics.\n\nLate-night comic Trevor Noah, of The Daily Show, breaks down the anti-Vindman argument \u2014 the high-ranking soldier must be a double agent who started working for Ukraine as soon as he hit U.S. shores at age 3. Take a look at today's Best of Late Night, above, to see how the toddler was rewarded.\n\nBest variety talk series: \"The Daily Show\" with Trevor Noah, Comedy Central (Photo: Jeff Schear, Getty Images for Comedy Central)\n\nJames Corden questions whether Trump knows what duty to country means. And Daily Show correspondent Roy Wood Jr., points out how the case for Trump keeps changing.\n\nAfter you watch our favorite jokes from last night's late-night lineup, vote for yours in the poll below.\n\nFollow Eileen Rivers on Twitter @msdc14.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/best-of-late-night/2019/10/30/trevor-noah-reveals-alexander-vindman-baby-spy-best-late-night/4097979002/", "description": "The impeachment inquiry just keeps getting deeper.
