According to Britain Elects, which collates the findings of various surveys, the Tories (35%) have an average 10% lead over the Labour Party (25%).\n\nElectoral Calculus, which predicts election results from polling data and electoral geography, predicted a Conservative majority of 58 in parliament \u2013 based on surveys carried out in the first half of October, before the deal was done.\n\nOther surveys suggest Johnson\u2019s deal has gone down better with the public than Theresa May\u2019s agreement.\n\nA snap poll by ComRes for the Daily Express \u2013 compiled on October 17, the day the deal was agreed \u2013 suggested that 40% of people supported the new deal, compared to just under a third (31%) who opposed it.\n\nA Deltapoll survey, carried out over the following weekend, brought a narrower margin \u2013 32% in favour of the deal and 29% against. Almost four in ten were undecided.\n\nRead more: What's in Boris Johnson's Brexit deal with the European Union?\n\n'Method in the PM's madness'\n\nPolitical Scientist Sir John Curtice from Strathclyde University told Euronews that a Johnson electoral victory was \u201cnot an unreasonable expectation\u201d \u2013 although there was no guarantee of success, and the result could be another hung parliament with no overall majority for any party.\n\nHe added that even if Johnson\u2019s call for an election failed, a limited Brexit extension would bring another hard deadline which opponents of no-deal might not be able to prevent.\n\n\u201cThere is method in what might seem madness on the prime minister\u2019s side,\u201d Professor Curtice told Euronews Now. \u201cHe either gets his deal through and gets an election \u2013 an election in circumstances that would be highly favourable \u2013 or he doesn\u2019t get it through, he doesn\u2019t have an election\u2026 But then we\u2019re back into a situation where MPs are being told: \u2018it\u2019s my deal or no deal\u2019.\u201d\n\nView the interview with Professor John Curtice in the video player above.\n\nBritish lawmakers are due to vote on a snap election on Monday. The approval of two-thirds of MPs is needed. Labour say they will only back an election if a no-deal Brexit is ruled out.\n\nAll this comes amid resistance in the British parliament to the Brexit bill. It passed its initial hurdle in the House of Commons, but MPs rejected the government\u2019s accelerated timetable.\n\nBoris Johnson has offered more time for parliament time to examine the legislation \u2013 but only if MPs back his call for the country to go to the polls.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat derailed Boris Johnson's EU divorce bill \u2013 and is it dead?\n\nBrexit: Is Boris Johnson telling the truth about Northern Ireland border checks?\n\nBrexit Guide: Where are we now?", "description": "The prime minister wants the UK to go to the polls on December 12, if the EU agrees a Brexit delay until January.", "authors": ["Alasdair Sandford"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/25/89/34/1000x563_cmsv2_a7a9e9a8-4bb4-530e-b15e-cf59047071a4-4258934.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
