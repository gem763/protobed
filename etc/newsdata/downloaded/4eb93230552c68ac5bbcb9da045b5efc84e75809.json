The show features a collection of more than 13,600 photographs submitted during a nationwide call for entries this summer. Consumers representing all 50 U.S. states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico submitted their treasured memories, favorite images and snapshots deemed worthy of public display.\n\nWith billions of photos captured and shared daily, individuals now have more images than any previous generation. The irony is that most of those images are forever locked away on mobile devices and shared only with personal networks, if at all. The Fujifilm Printlife exhibit aims to free those images from people\u2019s pockets and share them with the world. Instead of scrolling through a sea of images in a social feed, the more than 750,000 daily visitors at Grand Central Terminal will stroll through this large landmark space, taking in the sum of collective visions of thousands of strangers. What\u2019s amazing is how similar those visions can be.\n\nA photo of the family dog with kids in monochrome stands out on a colorful wall.

When viewing an image-maker\u2019s creation, we learn what is important to them,\u201d said Tetsuya Iwasaki, president & CEO of Fujifilm North America and president of Fujifilm Holdings America Corp. \u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable about the Printlife exhibit is that no matter the photographer\u2019s age, background, geography or politics, we all value the same things and seek to preserve the same experiences through photography.\u201d\n\nA special section of the exhibit will be dedicated to showcasing images from 100cameras, a nonprofit organization that works globally with children who have had challenging experiences. The organization teaches them to process and tell their stories through photography in a way that affects how they view themselves and their role in their communities.\n\nA woman documents the many rows of photos at the Fujifilm Printlife Photo Exhibit.
