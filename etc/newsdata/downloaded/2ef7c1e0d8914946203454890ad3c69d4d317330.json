Kempny missed the first eight games of the new season as he worked back to full health.\n\nWhile normally he plays on the top defensive pair alongside John Carlson, coach Todd Reirden said Kempny will start on the third pair with Radko Gudas against the Rangers and might see shifts with Carlson depending on how the game goes.\n\nIn a related move, the Capitals recalled forward Travis Boyd and defenseman Martin Fehervary from the Hershey Bears of the AHL.\n\nFehervary started the season with the Capitals but was sent down when Evgeny Kuznetsov returned from his suspension. If Siegenthaler is unable to play, Fehervary will fill in.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
