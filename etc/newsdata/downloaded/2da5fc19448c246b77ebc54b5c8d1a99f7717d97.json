If workers return to work and get back pay, however, they\u2019d have to return any government benefits. Management and workers are said to be close to a deal to end the impasse.\n\nClaims fell in New York, Georgia and Florida.\n\nThe more stable monthly average of new claims slipped by 750 to 212,000 nationwide. The four-week average usually gives a more accurate read into labor-market conditions than the more volatile weekly number.\n\nThe number of people already collecting unemployment benefits, known as continuing claims, declined by 15,000 to 1.65 million.\n\nRead: Consumer confidence sinks to 3-month low on trade worries, softer jobs market\n\nBig picture: Job losses are still extremely low even though there\u2019s scattered signs that some companies are cutting jobs. Layoffs have stuck near a 50-year bottom, suggesting a strong U.S. labor market remains the bedrock of the U.S. economy.\n\nEconomists are watching jobless claims closely, however, to see if they begin to increase soon. A survey of service-oriented companies earlier this month found that employment declined for the first time in almost 10 years. CEOs of the countries largest companies also say they plan to scale back hiring amid the ongoing trade war with China.\n\nWhat they are saying? \u201dInitial jobless claims remain low in an environment with slowing hiring activity but subdued layoffs,\u201d wrote chief economist Lewis Alexander of Nomura in a note to clients. \u201cHurricane season may add some temporary volatility, but we expect low readings on initial claims over the near term.\u201d\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.20% and S&P 500 SPX, -0.29% fell slightl in Thursday trades.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, -2.60% was little changed at 1.70%.
