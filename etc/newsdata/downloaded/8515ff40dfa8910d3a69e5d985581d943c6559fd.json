It was an awesome setup. We get into about Game 4 and we moved our backup to running back and our starter got knocked out with a concussion. So shoot, I'm standing there and I go in and play about a half. \"Then we go in for the next weekend and the starter's going to be back. So I'm like, 'Dang man, I just played a half and really wasted a year on playing a half of ball.' I was pretty pissed so I started looking around at what I could do and what my options were. The only thing I could do was to get a medical redshirt. But if I played in this next game, then that would be off the table. So I get an idea. I go home, I grabbed a bottle of Jack Daniels, and a hammer. And I go back in my room, I take a pull of Jack Daniels and put my hand down on the table and 'Boom, boom, boom, one-two-three,' and hit the hell out of my hand. I'm sitting there shaking, but I know it's not broken, and I did it again. Still nothing at this point and knew it wasn't broken. So another time, another pull, another three hits and that was all I could take. I couldn't break my own hand.\"\n\nSo, uh, yeah. The man reportedly took a swig of whiskey, slammed his hand with a hammer three times, took another swig, hit it another three times, then admitted defeat. Don\u2019t try that at home, kids.\n\nMinshew said he walked away with a bruised throwing hand and explained the injury to the East Carolina coaches by lying that he closed it in a car door.\n\nAs it turns out, breaking his hand proved unnecessary for Gardner Minshew to continue his football career. Who could have guessed? (Photo by James Gilbert/Getty Images)\n\nMinshew ended up playing seven games for the Pirates that year, too many for a medical redshirt. He indeed lost a year of eligibility as Minnesota castoff Philip Nelson\u2019s back-up.\n\nIt obviously all worked out though, as the rest of his career eventually landed him with quite possibly the best shot at a real NFL career he was ever going to get.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Once upon a time, Gardner Minshew was an East Carolina sophomore with a dream and a hammer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EPdlbcJN6pAu.wgmpVvGpw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BBX0jG2qV4Z5ih.mAhG.Ew--~B/aD0yODUyO3c9NDI3ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/9d2aa910-dbd0-11e9-956f-667edacc765a", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
