But much of what\u2019s wrong with the press was on full display in one question at the president\u2019s recent news conference at the G-7 meeting in France.\n\nOne hour into the press conference, the president stated that \u201cPresident Putin outsmarted President Obama,\u201d referring to the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014.\n\nPBS\u2019s Yamiche Alcindor took exception, interrupting the president to defend President Obama: \u201cWhy have you been using the misleading statement that Russia outsmarted President Obama when other countries have said that the reason Russia was kicked out [of the G-8] was very clearly because they annexed Crimea? Why keep repeating what some people would see as a clear lie?\u201d\n\nThere you have it. A member of the White House press corps rising to protect President Obama while calling President Trump\u2019s perfectly reasonable assertion a lie.\n\nFor eight years, the press was soft on President Obama and for four years, they have been brutal to Trump. Yet most reporters don\u2019t see themselves as biased. In August 2017, a Morning Consult/Politico poll showed 54 percent of registered voters say the national press is very or somewhat liberal. Sixteen percent say it\u2019s very or somewhat conservative. Only 7 percent say it\u2019s centrist/non-partisan. That\u2019s a problem, but it\u2019s one that too many in the press ignore.\n\nBias isn\u2019t the press\u2019s only issue. So too is agenda-driven news and its lack of accuracy.\n\nA Gallup poll in 2016 showed an all-time low, 32 percent, of respondents have a great deal or fair amount of trust and confidence that mass media will \u201creport the news fully, accurately and fairly.\u201d Only 14 percent of Republicans trust the media. Independents came in at 30 percent and Democrats barely, with 51 percent, had a great deal or fair amount of trust that the press would do its job right.\n\nIn any other business, when customers are this disgruntled, the business would re-evaluate what it\u2019s doing and change. But, as the question to President Trump showed, too many reporters live in a self-reinforcing, anti-Trump bubble where they praise one another for confronting the president, ignoring that they\u2019re doing immense damage to their institutions.\n\nI\u2019m a traditionalist and worked for several establishment Republicans. I want a press corps I can believe in. I want neutrality in coverage, not bias. I want to be able to pick up the paper and watch news shows (not the opinion shows) and know that I\u2019m being told what took place and then I can form my own opinions.\n\nBut the line between reporting and analysis has become so blurred, my hope for fairness is quaint. Many reporters get offended when they hear me say their job is to stop being analysists and instead tell their readers and viewers what happened. That would turn them into stenographers, they argue. In an era of instant news, they say they need to provide context and analysis.\n\nWell, whose context is it? Context in the hands of the Washington press corps too often is context born of liberal thinking. It\u2019s why much of the press gave President Obama an eight-year pass yet gang up on President Trump, sounding more like the resistance than neutral reporters.\n\nIn 2013, The Atlantic magazine reported that at least 24 journalists\u2014not columnists or editorial writers\u2014took jobs within the Obama administration. It wasn\u2019t uncommon for journalists who didn\u2019t work for President Obama to fawn over him.\n\n\u201cObama seemed the political equivalent of a rainbow \u2013 a sudden preternatural event inspiring awe and ecstasy. He transcends the racial divide so effortlessly that it seems reasonable to expect that he can bridge all the other divisions \u2013 and answer all the impossible questions,\u201d wrote Time\u2019s Joe Klein in 2006.\n\n\u201cBetween workouts during his Hawaii vacation this week, [Obama] was photographed looking like the paradigm of a new kind of presidential fitness, one geared less toward preventing heart attacks than winning swimsuit competitions. The sun glinted off chiseled pectorals sculpted during four weightlifting sessions,\u201d Eli Saslow of the Washington Post told his readers in 2008 about the president-elect.\n\nThe softness extended throughout President Obama\u2019s tenure. When Obama flip-flopped on gay marriage, CNN praised his \u201chistoric\u201d stance. Senator Obama filibustered President Bush\u2019s appointment of Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court. But the press seldom pointed out President Obama\u2019s hypocrisy when he criticized the GOP over its handling of Obama\u2019s judicial nominees. Obama voted against raising the debt limit as a senator, but most reporters went easy on him when he faulted the GOP Congress for opposing debt limit hikes.\n\nWhen Attorney General Eric Holder declared himself President Obama\u2019s \u201cwingman\u201d in 2013, there was no feeding frenzy. Imagine if Attorney General William Barr said that today.\n\nPresident Obama twice intervened in Department of Justice criminal investigations. He opined that Lois Lerner\u2019s improper IRS audits of conservative organizations didn\u2019t rise to \u201ceven a smidgen of corruption.\u201d On \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in 2015, he dismissed Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server as a \u201cmistake,\u201d adding it \u201cis not a situation in which America\u2019s national security was endangered.\u201d\n\nThese inappropriate interventions were treated as one-day stories. When President Trump gives his opinions about ongoing Justice Department investigations, much of the media spend days, if not years, pounding him for crossing ethical lines and going beyond the norms.\n\nI would have loved to have been President Obama\u2019s press secretary. It would have been easy. Not so for President Trump. The press never gave him a chance. I readily admit President Trump has been rough on the press. But as of the chicken and the egg, I don\u2019t know which came first.\n\nSince the day he was elected, many in the press pursued with reckless abandon the now bogus storyline that President Trump colluded with Russia. CNN, in its zeal to criticize the president, ran numerous false stories, including that former FBI director James Comey wouldn\u2019t corroborate the president\u2019s statement that he was told three times he wasn\u2019t under investigation; that Donald Trump Jr. knew in advance that WikiLeaks had Hillary\u2019s emails; and that candidate Trump knew about Natalia Veselnitskaya\u2019s meeting in Trump Tower with Trump campaign staff.\n\nCNN doctored a video to make it look like President Trump didn\u2019t know how to feed Koi fish during his visit to Japan. How much bias does CNN harbor to misleadingly edit a video so they turn something inconsequential into an international incident that implies what an oaf the president is?\n\nToo much of the coverage today begins and ends with the question What\u2019s wrong with Trump? In her 2019 book, \u201cMerchants of Truth,\u201d The New York Times\u2019 former executive editor, Jill Abramson, wrote, \u201cThough [current Executive Editor Dean Baquet] said publicly that he didn\u2019t want the Times to be the opposition party, his news pages were unmistakably anti-Trump, as were the [Washington] Post\u2019s. Some headlines contained raw opinion, as did some of the stories that were labeled as news analysis.\u201d\n\nThat brings me back to Alcindor\u2019s question. No doubt, she earnestly believes President Obama was not outsmarted by President Putin and that President Trump is a liar. The fact that neither she, nor apparently the rest of the White House press corps, thought her question was out of line, and an example of bias, shows how deep the bias runs.\n\nThis article has been updated since publication.", "description": "Much of what\u2019s wrong with the press was on full display in one question at the president\u2019s recent news conference at the G7 meeting in France.", "authors": ["Ari Fleischer"], "top_image": "https://thefederalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/48612888378_0dd5aceda6_b.jpg"}
