Scary stuff in there, kids. pic.twitter.com/RvXMk1JPdn \u2014 Kal Penn (@kalpenn) October 29, 2015\n\n\u201cYou grant Snapchat a world-wide, perpetual, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, create derivative works from, publicly perform, broadcast, distribute, syndicate, promote, exhibit, and publicly display that content in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods,\u201d the Terms of Service state.\n\nThe terms of service adds that some tools on the app control who can and cannot see your content, but does not clarify which ones. A support page says that private messages, which Snapchat calls \u2018Snaps,\u2019 still automatically delete after they have been viewed, though that is not explicitly stated in the Terms of Service.\n\nSnapchat responded in a blog post filed Sunday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that our Terms of Service grant us a broad license to use the content you create\u2014a license that\u2019s common to services like ours. We need that license when it comes to, for example, Snaps submitted to Live Stories, where we have to be able to show those Stories around the world\u2014and even replay them or syndicate them (something we\u2019ve said we could do in previous versions of our Terms and Privacy Policy).\u201d\n\nHowever, Snapchat also said personal privacy settings within the app could restrict the scope of that license. In other words, your private snaps are still safe\n\nSnapchat users are being asked to accept the updated terms after downloading the new version of the app, but the details of the new privacy policy aren\u2019t immediately visible. Users must go to a different page to dig into those details.\n\nThe statement comes in contrast to the former version of Snapchat\u2019s privacy policy, which said, \u201cdelete is our default.\u201d The former policy said: \u201cIn most cases, once we detect that all recipients have viewed a message, we automatically delete it from our servers.\u201d\n\nMessages in Snapchat\u2019s \u201cReplay\u201d feature, or those added to the \u201cMy Story\u201d feature and Snapcash, which is Snapchat\u2019s transaction feature, have always been saved to Snapchat servers.\n\nSome Snapchat users expressed outrage over the fact that their \u201csnaps\u201d may no longer be as private as they once were. People are saying the update is \u201cscary\u201d and makes them want to delete their accounts.\n\nI love Snapchat. But you gotta read the new privacy policy they just released... #scary \u2014 SteFano Langone (@Stefano) October 29, 2015\n\nNew Snapchat terms and conditions! Does anyone go through the privacy policy? I just did. I then deleted my account. \u2014 \u2728Rachel\u2728 (@RachelPolzer) October 28, 2015\n\nInstagram\u2019s terms of service similarly grant the company a royalty-free license to use contents posted through the social network, though Instagram has never claimed to be a private or ephemeral messaging service. Facebook\u2019s privacy policy FB, +0.05% also grants the company rights to a royalty-free, world-wide license to user\u2019s content, but that only applies to content published under the \u201cPublic Setting.\u201d\n\nUsers say they have found some silver lining in the new policy. People are happy that it is mostly free of legal jargon.", "description": "Snapchat on Wednesday released a new update for its app, and with that comes a new privacy policy that has users rather upset.", "authors": ["Sally French", "Social Media Editor", "Drone Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-DY133_snapch_ZG_20151029181232.jpg"}
