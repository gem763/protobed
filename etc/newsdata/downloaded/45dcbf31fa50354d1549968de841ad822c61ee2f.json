(AP) - Jonquel Jones and Courtney Williams got the Connecticut Sun going in the third quarter and the team never looked back.\n\nJones scored 27 points and Williams added 25 to help the Sun rout the Los Angeles Sparks 94-68 on Thursday night and take a 2-0 lead in the WNBA semifinals.\n\n\u201cI think we brought a different type of energy. LA came out and hit us in our mouth,\u201d Williams said of the Sparks\u2018 early lead. \u201cYou know we had to come out and withstand their runs, stay mentally strong. We know basketball is a game of runs. We went on our run and kept our foot on the gas.\u201d\n\nGame 3 of the best-of-five series is Sunday in Long Beach, California, as the Sparks\u2018 normal home in Los Angeles isn\u2019t available.\n\n\u201cRight now at this time of the year our home court at Staples is prioritized with the Kings and their preseason games. So that\u2019s how it is,\u201d said Nneka Oguwmike, who led the Sparks with 18 points.\n\nThe Sun led by one at the half before Williams helped blow the game open. She scored 13 of her points in the third quarter to the delight of her dad, Don, who was courtside wearing her No. 10 jersey. He was jumping up and down on every one of her baskets and waving a towel and a cardboard cutout of his daughter\u2019s head. After the final buzzer, he ran on the court and picked up his daughter in a bear hug.\n\n\u201cHaving my dad there is crazy. It\u2019s an amazing feeling to look over there and see someone bringing more energy than me,\u201d Williams said. \u201cHe\u2019s been here since I was born, obviously. \u2026 It takes me to another level to be able to look over to him and him telling me to stop turning the ball over. \u2026 Telling me free throws are free, don\u2019t miss no free throws. Having him here, I love it.\u201d\n\nConnecticut led 70-57 after three quarters and scored 10 of the first 12 points in the fourth to dash any hopes Los Angeles had of a comeback. Sparks coach Derek Fisher pulled his starters with 5:31 left and his team down 23 points.\n\nRiquna Williams added 14 for the Sparks, who will have to win three straight to make the WNBA Finals for the third time in five years.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t able to sustain the fight and energy it takes to win these games on the road,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cCredit them for how hard they were able to play.\u201d\n\nRiquna Williams had a dismal Game 1, missing eight of her nine shots and scoring just two points in the nine-point loss. She got out to a quick start on Thursday, scoring seven points in the first five minutes. Los Angeles led 16-6 midway through the period when Connecticut called timeout. The Sun then scored nine straight to get within one before the Sparks closed the quarter with the final six points.\n\nThe Sun battled back and took their first lead of the game with 1:04 left in the half on a basket by Jones. Connecticut led 41-40 at the half. Jones had 15 points for Connecticut while Ogwumike made all six of her shots and had 12 for Los Angeles.\n\nIRONWOMAN\n\nAlyssa Thomas played the first 74 minutes of the series before finally subbing out for the first time with 5:31 left in the game and her team up comfortably. She finished with 12 points, 13 rebounds and four assists and helped hold Sparks star Candace Parker to just three points.\n\nCHAIRWOMEN OF THE BOARDS\n\nThe 29 rebounds by Connecticut in the first half broke the WNBA playoff mark for a half. Four teams held the previous record of 28, most recently the 2017 Mystics. Connecticut finished the game with 46 to Los Angeles\u2018 24.\n\n\u201cThe rebounding is what stands out on the stat sheet tonight,\u201d Miller said. \u201cIt carried us when we were struggling in the first half.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Doug Feinberg on Twitter at https://twitter.com/DougFeinberg\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-Sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jonquel Jones and Courtney Williams got the Connecticut Sun going in the third quarter and the team never looked back.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Doug Feinberg"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/sparks_sun_basketball_08666_c0-339-3408-2326_s1770x1032.jpg?a0dc10286cf12b78ea8d0609f6c8a119635a5cc0", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
