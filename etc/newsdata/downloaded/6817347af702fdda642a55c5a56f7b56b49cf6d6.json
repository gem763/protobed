Multiple Republicans expressed interest at the lunch in trying to legislate during the impeachment trial.\n\nSchumer said he\u2019d had \u201czero\u201d discussions with McConnell about the matter.\u201cI'm not urging him to do it immediately,\u201d Schumer told reporters on Wednesday, calling for \u201ca fair and bipartisan way and I hope that Leader McConnell would obey those strictures.\"\n\nMarianne LeVine contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/46/82/fb9d29354be6bc7d060684d4356a/191016-mcconnell-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
