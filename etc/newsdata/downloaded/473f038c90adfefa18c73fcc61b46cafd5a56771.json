Kamala Harris.\n\nThe California senator stands at 5 percent support in Iowa in a survey commissioned by the progressive organization Focus on Rural America. That\u2019s down 13 percentage points from her 18 percent support in the group\u2019s previous poll, which was conducted in July.\n\nThe Iowa survey\u2019s release came a day after an NBC News/Wall Street Journal national poll has Harris in fifth place at 5 percent. That\u2019s down 8 points from her 13 percent showing in the July poll.\n\nHarris saw her numbers soar in most national and early voting state polling in the weeks after her viral takedown of former Vice President Joe Biden in the first round of Democratic presidential primary debates in late June.\n\nHARRIS REITERATES HER SUPPORT FOR MANDATORY ASSAULT WEAPONS BUYBACK DURING LATE NIGHT TV APPEARANCE\n\nStill, there are still four and a half months to go until the Iowa caucuses kick off the presidential nominating calendar. And the race for the Democratic nomination remains very fluid.\n\nThe new Focus on Rural America poll \u2013 taken following last Thursday\u2019s third round debate and released Wednesday \u2013 was conducted by David Binder, who serves as the Harris campaign\u2019s chief pollster.\n\nIn the survey, Biden \u2013 the front-runner in the race -- stands at 25 percent support among likely Democratic caucus-goers in Iowa, with populist Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 23 percent.\n\nSouth Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg is in third place in the survey at 12 percent. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont \u2013 the progressive independent from Vermont who\u2019s making his second straight presidential run -- stands at 9 percent, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar from Minnesota \u2013 Iowa\u2019s neighbor to the north \u2013 at 8 percent.\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\n\nBillionaire environmental and progressive advocate Tom Steyer is at 3 percent, with Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 2 percent. Everyone else tested in the\n\npoll registers at 1 percent or less.\n\nHarris has been beefing up her presence in Iowa, the first state to vote in the primaries and caucuses. The former California attorney general recently traveled through the state on a bus tour and she was the first Democratic White House hopeful to go up with ads.\n\nBiden \u2013 who has increased his visits to Iowa and built up his team on the ground this summer \u2013 enjoyed an 8 point jump since the July survey. Warren, who has had a strong staff on the ground in Iowa since earlier this year, experienced a slight 3 point drop from the previous poll.\n\nThe Focus on Rural America survey was conducted Sept. 14-17, with 500 likely Democratic presidential caucus-goers in Iowa questioned by live telephone operators. The survey\u2019s sampling error is plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.", "description": "Two new polls released this week could spell trouble for Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
