Things like the chemical capsaicin in chilli can warm you by stimulating the metabolism .\n\n\u201cPutting them in soups and stews can be a \u00adhealthier way to warm you up instead of going for the puddings.\n\n\u201cA hearty soup can help you get some \u00advegetables too.\u201d\n\n2 Take vitamin D\n\nAs winter draws in, DrDerbyshire says it is important to take a \u00advitamin D supplement. A study in the National Library of Medicine found a deficiency is linked to more infections.\n\nDr Derbyshire said: \u201cWe don\u2019t get enough sunlight so it\u2019s just a good all-rounder to take. Especially for those people who sit inside in offices all day, tied to their desk.\u201d\n\nFortified cereals and milk may also provide more vitamin D.\n\n3 Eat lemon peel\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nLemons are an \u00adexcellent source of immune-boosting vitamin C \u2013 so Dr Perry advises \u00adadding peel to dishes for an extra boost.\n\nOranges and grapefruits are not quite as high in vitamin C but are more pleasant to eat. \u201cDrinking hot \u00adwater with lemon \u00adevery morning is a good way to get an early dose of vitamin C without having to eat an actual lemon,\u201dhe \u00adsuggests. He also advises kale, kiwi fruit and Brussels sprouts. All are good immune boosters.\n\n4 Better medicine\n\nToo many people are taking \u00adantibiotics for a cough or cold, Dr Derbyshire says. It is leading to antibiotic resistance.\n\nShe suggests a cough medicine containing pelargonium, such as a brand called Kaloba.\n\n\u201cThere are more natural cough syrups we can use with an extract in called pelargonium. It comes from the geranium plant and helps reduce symptoms of colds without antibiotics.\u201d\n\nBut if symptoms persist, go to the doctor.\n\n5 Walk every day\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nGentle \u00adexercise is an excellent way to strengthen your immunity \u2013 and we should be doing more, Dr Perry says.\n\n\u201cTry to exercise \u00adregularly. Get outside every day for a 15-minute walk to boost circulation \u2013 it\u2019s a huge benefit to immunity and \u00adcardiovascular health,\u201d he says.\n\n6 Do not binge on booze\n\nMaking sure you are properly hydrated is essential to good health. And going easy on the alcohol helps.\n\nDr Perry said: \u201cAs tempting as it is when the nights draw in to turn to alcohol, try not to drink too much as this can weaken your immunity, make you dehydrated and more susceptible to colds.\u201d\n\n7 Get enough sleep\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nSleeping allows your body to rest, repair and fight off infections.\n\nWhen the party season kicks in, it might be hard but try to get eight hours a night.\n\nDr Perry said: \u201cGet a good amount of rest and sleep to allow your body to recover and give it chance to fight any infections.\n\n\u201cDo not let your body get itself run down. That\u2019s when immune systems suffer and germs and infections take hold.\u201d\n\nAccording to the National Sleep Foundation, not enough sleep means you produce fewer infection-fighting proteins called cytokines. These are released while you sleep, so less sleep means less protein.", "description": "There are things you can do to help ease the symptoms and speed up recovery from that irritating common cold from which we all suffer", "authors": ["Helen Whitehouse", "Image", "Getty", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article11833308.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Woman-laying-in-bed-with-headache.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
