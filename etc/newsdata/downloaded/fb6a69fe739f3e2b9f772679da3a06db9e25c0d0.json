We should not allow these forces to hijack the definition of the European way of life. They want it to mean the opposite of what it is.\"\n\nCritics of the name of the portfolio, which includes migration in its mandate, have slammed it as a \"dog-whistle\" of right-wing extremists. French far-right leader Marine Le Pen endorsed the new title in a speech on Sunday, calling it an \u201cideological victory,\u201d according to Reuters.\n\nThe incoming Commission president acknowledged her use of the \"European way of life\" phrase had sparked a debate \"on the connotations and the concept of the term,\" but insisted this was a good thing, concluding \"it is a debate we should have in the open.\"\n\n\"Of course, words matter,\" she wrote. \"I recognize that. For some, the European way of life is a loaded and politically charged term. But we cannot and must not let others take away our language from us: this is also part of who we are.\"\n\n\"We should not allow [interfering foreign or local powers] to hijack the definition of the European way of life\" \u2014 Ursula von der Leyen\n\nShe said: \"We should be proud of our European way of life in all of its forms and dimensions and we should constantly preserve, protect and nurture it. This is why it was one of the six guiding principles in my Political Guidelines, which received the European Parliament\u2019s support in July.\"\n\nAnd she noted that \u201cthe European way of life came at a great price and sacrifice,\" adding: \"It should never be taken for granted \u2014 it is neither a given nor a guarantee. The proof of that is that our way of living is being challenged every day \u2014 as much by anti-Europeans from within as from without.\"", "description": "French far-right leader Marine Le Pen endorsed the new portfolio,\u00a0calling it an \u2018ideological victory.\u2019", "authors": ["Zoya Sheftalovich", "David M.
