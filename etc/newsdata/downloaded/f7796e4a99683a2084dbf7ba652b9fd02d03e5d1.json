Why is there 'no money' for infrastructure or social programs, but there is for waging war? And what does all this have to do with Donald Trump, or Brexit, or climate change?\n\nIf you're mystified about any of the above, then author and Brown University professor Mark Blyth can clarify things for you. He says it's helpful to use a computer metaphor to describe the economy.\n\nIn his lecture at McMaster University as part of their Socrates Project, Blyth compared capitalist economies to laptops: different makes, but similar in appearance. He argues these computers run just fine for a while \u2014 say, about 30 years . But all the while, there are bugs in the software that eventually causes the system to crash. Then you rebuild the hardware, fix the software, and reboot.\n\nSystem breakdown\n\nThat's what happened in the 1970s and 1980s, when labour costs and inflation became a problem. The 'system rebuild' included less powerful unions, more global trade, and central bankers who were put in charge of setting interest rates.\n\nBut this new system generated bugs of its own, among them, a runaway culture of lending, and a lack of wage growth among the middle classes, who did a lot more borrowing than they could afford.\n\nWe\u2019re living in a whole new political dynamic stemming from the financial crisis of 2008, according to political economist, Mark Blyth. (Arko Datta/Reuters)\n\nMark Blyth says this borrowing wasn't just driven by rampant consumerism.\n\n\"How do you get by when \u2026 everybody tells you there's no inflation, yet the cost of everything that matters is actually going up? Education, health care, all that sort of stuff,\" Blyth said in his lecture.\n\n\"And the only way you can fill in the gap is to borrow more money.\"\n\nCue the 2008 financial crisis\n\nHowever this time, Blyth says there was no rebuild. Instead, the United States Federal Reserve led a bailout of the big banks, domestically and internationally. The rich got much richer, the middle class got perpetual low interest rates to keep carrying their debts, and the poor had their social programs cut in the name of austerity.\n\nBlyth contends this dynamic is what lit the fuse of global populism: the rise of leaders who appeal to public outrage, alienation, and lack of trust toward career politicians and traditional political parties.\n\n\"Your debts are too high...you can't pay them off, but you can roll them over. They're not going to be eaten away by inflation, and the people who brought you here have zero credibility,\" said Blyth.\n\nBlyth compares populist leaders to 'rogue code-writers', hacking into the software of a system that was never properly rebuilt after the crisis of 2008. This is not necessarily a bad thing, especially if it strengthens democracies.\n\n\"[Populism] is now part of the furniture \u2026 It's already changed, so just get used to it. And let's remember historically that 100 years ago, the people who were the populists then, the people that everyone was afraid of, became the established parties in many cases,\" Blyth told IDEAS host Nahlah Ayed.\n\n\"So every now and again you have to have a little revolution, and that's what's happening now.\"\n\nPopulism is springing up on the right and the left, said Blyth. The difficult choices that need to be made about climate change could come from a left-wing populist movement, not unlike the so-called 'Green New Deal' proposed by younger American Democrats like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nLooking at how things may unfold in the not-too-distant future, Blyth speculates \"right populism wins round one.\"\n\n\"But ultimately, left populism wins round two, because left populism is the only one that takes climate change seriously,\" he concludes.\n\n\n\n** This episode was produced by Sean Foley.
