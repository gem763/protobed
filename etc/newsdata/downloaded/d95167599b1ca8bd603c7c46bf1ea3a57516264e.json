Source: Facebook\n\nA mother who is accused of abandoning her adopted daughter has claimed the \u201cchild\u201d is actually a 22-year-old adult.\n\nKristine Barnett and her now ex-husband Michael Barnett adopted a Ukrainian girl who has dwarfism in 2010.\n\nHospital records stated the girl was eight years old at the time.\n\nLast week, prosecutors in the US state of Indiana charged the couple with abandoning their daughter in 2013 and moving to Canada, leaving the girl, then 11, in a rented apartment and with no financial support.\n\nWhen a detective spoke to Mr Barnett earlier this month, he said he and his wife had the girl\u2019s age legally changed to 22 in June of 2012 and that his wife had told her to tell anyone who asked that she \u201clooks young but was actually 22.\u201d\n\nBarnett told the detective that he and his wife rented an apartment in Lafayette in July 2013 and, despite knowing that the child knew no one in that city, they left her there and moved to Canada, investigators wrote in the affidavit.\n\nKristine and Michael Barnett More\n\nHowever, now the mother has hit back at her arrest, launching an extraordinary defence in which she claims their daughter wasn\u2019t a child at all, and displayed behaviour that could only have been that of an adult.\n\n\u201cShe would make statements and draw pictures saying she wanted to kill family members, roll them up in a blanket and put them in the backyard,\u201d Ms Barnett told DailyMailTV.\n\n\u201cThe media is painting me to be a child abuser but there is no child here.\n\n\u201cShe was a woman. She had periods. She had adult teeth. She never grew a single inch, which would happen even with a child with dwarfism.\n\n\u201cThe doctors all confirmed she was suffering a severe psychological illness only diagnosed in adults.\n\nPictured are Michael Barnett and Kristine Barnett during an interview on 60 Minutes.

She was doing things you could never imagine a little child doing.\n\nMrs Barnett also describes one day she was giving her daughter a bath and noticed she had \u201cfull pubic hair\u201d.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, court documents from June 2012 show a judge ruled in favour of the couple\u2019s appeal to have their child\u2019s age changed and amended the girl\u2019s birth date to September 4, 1989.\n\nHowever, it is also claimed that doctors who carried out bone density tests on the girl in June 2010 concluded she was around 10 years old.\n\nThe Barnetts were arrested on Wednesday and have been released on bail.\n\nThe case has drawn attention from across the globe, with interest fuelled by its eery similarities to the horror film Orphan.\n\nThe affidavit leaves a lot unclear, including how long the girl lived alone in the apartment before her plight was discovered and why an investigation that apparently began in September of 2014 took years to result in charges against the Barnetts.\n\nIt also doesn\u2019t say where in Canada the Barnetts lived or whether they have since returned to the U.S., though the Barnetts have different addresses listed in Indianapolis.\n\nProsecutors only said in response to questions that they had asked a county judge to issue an order for the Barnetts to appear at an initial hearing on the charges.\n\nMichael and Kristine Barnett eating dinner with four kids at the table in 2012 during a segment for 60 Minutes.
