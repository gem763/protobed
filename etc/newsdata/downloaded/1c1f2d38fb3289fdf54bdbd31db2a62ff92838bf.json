Consumers flooded into the store before its 9 a.m. opening. The crowd got so big the company had to shut its doors early. CFO Richard Galanti said over 130,000 people signed up for memberships on just that day alone.\n\n\u201cIt was like Thanksgiving Thursday at Walmart,\u201d Bruderman Asset Management Chief Market Strategist Oliver Pursche told Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move. \u201cBeing able to buy at a steep discount is a relatively new business model that the Chinese are seeing. They're not used to seeing the mega stores that offer discounted prices \u2014 I think that\u2019s why people flock to it.\u201d\n\nDiscount stores are appealing to consumers in China as they continue to feel pressure from the trade war with the United States, according to Pursche.\n\nIn August, industrial output and retail sales data pointed to slowing demand and low confidence among businesses and consumers in China. Value-added industrial output rose 4.4% in August from a year earlier, far below economists\u2019 expectations of 5.2% growth. Retail sales rose 7.5% in August from a year earlier, which was below expectations for a 7.9% rise.\n\nBut Pursche said a company like Costco does not have to worry about an economic slowdown in China or any country, for that matter.\n\n\u201cCostco is one of those recession-proof companies because people will flock to it in good times and buy in bulk... they'll also flock to it when things are less secure,\u201d he said.\n\nValentina Caval is a producer at Yahoo Finance.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Costco received a warm welcome when it opened its doors in Shanghai.
