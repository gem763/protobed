Their 41-17 loss to the 49ers was reminiscent of their many bad moments during the last three losing seasons.\n\nInstead of seeing a fresh start, the crowd of 50,666 got more of the same.\n\n\u201cThey just took it to us,\u201d cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick said. \u201cI definitely thought we would play with a lot more of a sense of urgency. We just have to go out there and take a good look in the mirror at ourselves.\u201d\n\nThe Bengals had a solid showing overall during a 21-20 loss in Seattle a week earlier that suggested they were making progress under first-year head coach Zac Taylor. A banner in the upper deck at Paul Brown Stadium read: \u201cZAC-tly What the DR ordered.\u201d\n\nIn his regular-season home debut, Taylor\u2019s team fell apart quickly, especially on defense . The 49ers piled up the big plays and 572 yards overall while scoring the most points against the Bengals in a home opener. Now they\u2019re 0-2 for the second time in three years.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t see that coming,\u201d Taylor said.\n\nThe mistakes came from all directions.\n\nThe defense got caught out of position and repeatedly missed tackles . The offense struggled again to run the ball, managing 25 net yards on 19 carries. Randy Bullock missed another field goal. The 49ers got ahead 31-10 to start the third quarter and essentially ran it out, meeting little resistance.\n\n\u201cPoor,\u201d quarterback Andy Dalton said, summing it up. \u201cThey took it to us today, and it\u2019s disappointing.\u201d\n\nThe line was already depleted by injuries, and it took a few more hits. Left tackle Cordy Glenn missed a second game in concussion protocol. Backup Andre Smith went out with a groin injury in the second quarter. Rookie left guard Michael Jordan suffered a knee injury and was carted off in the second half - Taylor had no updated information about his condition.\n\nThe running game also was nonexistent in Seattle, forcing Dalton to carry the load . On Sunday, he was 26 of 42 for 311 yards with four sacks, an interception and two touchdowns, including a 66-yarder to John Ross III with 45 seconds left.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Week 2, so that\u2019s a positive thing,\u201d center Trey Hopkins said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t put a product like that on the field ever again.\u201d\n\nDisappointed by the poor performance, fans started booing in the third quarter and headed for the exits as the start of the fourth. The Bengals drew a comparable 50,018 for their home opener last season, when they finished second to last in the NFL in home attendance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never understood booing,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what it accomplishes. But at the end of the day, we have to play better and give them something to cheer for. We want the fans to be behind us.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Turns out that the Bengals' solid showing in Seattle was more of a mirage.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Kay"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/49ers_bengals_football_03728_c0-156-3721-2325_s1770x1032.jpg?f528f5a25430591262f07698e16758e6accce80d", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
