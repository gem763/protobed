At home!", "language": "en", "text": "The other day I was reminded of the bizarre occasion when Prince Andrew asked a lunch party of glossy magazine editors, which included me: 'Now, if you were steering a 8,000-ton Daring-class destroyer, how far in advance of port would you shut down the engine?' Cripes!\n\nI was the first to answer, only to break the stunned silence. Naturally I was way out.\n\nThis prime example of male absorption in their job came up when I was interviewing my old boss, magazine supremo Nicholas Coleridge, at a talk to promote his hugely entertaining memoir, The Glossy Years.\n\nThe worst sexism goes on at home. In the vast majority of relationships where both halves of a couple are employed, it is still the women who are most often the keepers of the home and chief carers of the children\n\nI've always liked Nick.\n\nAfter all, I have him to thank for 25 years at Vogue, so I didn't pull the full Paxman, instead encouraging him to let rip with a stream of amusing anecdotes, including the one above.\n\nThe one time Nicholas was hesitant was when I asked whether he had ever thought about the difference between his position as a male executive and that of the senior females in the company, Cond\u00e9 Nast.\n\nHad he ever considered that, as well as getting on with our big jobs, we had a constant ticker tape of domestic family concerns running through our brains. Were there enough eggs in the fridge? Was the cat food about to run out? What to do about finding a new boiler?\n\nAfter a pause he conceded that, no, he hadn't ever thought about that \u2013 any more than I expect most male CEOs do, though they'll all claim to change a nappy nowadays.\n\nNicholas was a good boss but this exchange highlighted a fascinating truth.\n\nDespite all feminism's many successes, men still have the privilege of being able to park the majority of their domestic concerns on their wife/partner whether she works or not. It's not true in all cases. Obviously not.\n\nBut in the vast majority where both halves of a couple are employed, it is still the women who are most often the keepers of the home and chief carers of the children and, increasingly, elderly parents.\n\nOf course, this isn't news. But this week's High Court defeat for women battling to reverse pension age increases underlines the fact that our hefty domestic role can be as penalising an inequality as lack of equal pay or opportunity.\n\nAnd it's surely a reason why there are still so few of us who reach the dizzy heights of CEO.\n\nThis week's High Court defeat for women battling to reverse pension age increases underlines the fact that our hefty domestic role, rather than our role in the workplace, can be as penalising an inequality as lack of equal pay or opportunity.\n\nTV's hot new star... My mum's curtains\n\nI've already written here about enjoying the TV drama The Capture, so imagine how exciting it was to see the exterior of the block of flats I grew up in, and where my mother still lives, starring in the series.\n\nThere it was, positioned opposite the big stucco-fronted property meant to be housing the evil Yanks. Gripping as the show was, I kept looking out for a glimpse of our sitting-room curtains.\n\nLocation-spotting is a fun game. It was revealed this week that, for the new series of The Crown, Prince Charles and Princess Diana's famous visit to Ayers Rock in Australia was, in reality, filmed in the less costly and more convenient Almeria, Spain.\n\nWhere I now live the streets are constantly, and inconveniently, jammed with Winnebagos stuffed with TV crews as we're frequently used to exemplify a generic middle-class area.\n\nBut that's nothing compared to the popularity of Liverpool's Water Street, where the massive Victorian buildings are the cut-price go-to for film-makers wanting to replicate historical New York.\n\nThis handshake's all double-clutch to me\n\nI've been considering the double clutch. No ordinary hand-hold or handshake, the double clutch (when you emotionally place your second hand over your first as you clasp someone's palm) suddenly seems to be everywhere.\n\nWhen Carrie Symonds joined Boris Johnson as he left the stage after his speech at the Tory Party Conference, she adoringly double-clutched him as they walked through the throng of admirers (below). Meghan has been seen adopting it on walkabouts and also with her Prince.\n\nThe double clutch isn't new. It's long been used by American politicians to emphasise their sincerity and commitment \u2013 Bill Clinton was a grand master on his meet-and-greets (and we know what happened then).\n\nEven so it's far less common over here. In fact, I've never seen anyone double clutch in everyday life. But sure as chips are French fries, it'll be catching on now.\n\nWill today's art pass the Botticelli test?\n\nAt this year's Frieze Masters art fair, the major attraction was a Botticelli. Among the 130 galleries taking part with their Lucian Freuds, Jeff Koons and 17th Century elephant bird eggs, it was the Botticelli alone that had queues waiting to enter the small enclosure where it hung.\n\nIt's a curious fact that the more art is produced in the world, the higher prices have grown. In 1497, when the Botticelli was painted, today's huge and lucrative art market would have been completely unimaginable.\n\nIt would be wonderful to know, out of all the countless fabulous artworks currently on display at the Frieze, whether there's a single one that in another 500 years will be able to command the same admiration as the Botticelli.\n\nUnisex loos are such an inconvenience\n\nSome things never change. There's always a furore over loos. For years the provision, or not, of female loos was used as an argument to keep women out of the military.\n\nNow The Old Vic is the latest institution to come under fire on the loo front \u2013 this time for the installation of its new gender-neutral additions, which won't solve the perennial problem of the lengthy women's queue in the interval. Sharing the facilities won't help.\n\nIn the stampede to tear down gender walls, it seems to be forgotten that some people can use urinals and some can't. It's a fact.\n\nCan't we just accept that and make sure there's enough provision for all? And allow those of us who are old-fashioned enough to still enjoy a distinction between the sexes to get on with their business in the company of those they feel most comfortable with\u2026\n\nIt's not all bad news \u2013 flares are back\n\nThere's a lot going on in the world but let's not overlook the return of flared jeans.\n\nSometimes small things count and for any woman who has struggled with skinnies and shapeless boyfriend cuts, the coming revival of the flare \u2013 even if we have to deal with a high-waist, if we don't want to look Topshop circa 1998 \u2013 is a cheery glimmer of light.", "description": "ALEXANDRA SCHULMAN: The other day I was reminded of the bizarre occasion when Prince Andrew asked a lunch party of glossy magazine editors, which included me.", "authors": ["Alexandra Shulman For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/01/19348326-0-image-a-30_1570323411298.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
