Chinese Stocks Drop as U.S. Considers Limiting Investor Flows\n\n(Bloomberg) -- Chinese stocks fell Monday after a report that the Trump administration is considering ways to limit U.S. investors\u2019 exposure to Chinese assets.\n\nThe CSI 300 Index slipped 0.5% as of the mid-day break, on volume that was about 43% lower than the 30-day average. The moves onshore may be volatile due to thin liquidity ahead of the week-long holiday, as well as the closing of positions typically seen at quarter-end. The strengthened 0.2% to 7.1231 per dollar Monday and the onshore rate was little changed.\n\nWhile a Treasury official said there are no plans to stop Chinese companies from listing on American exchanges, the added uncertainty comes at a particularly sensitive time for China. The country is stepping up measures to open its markets to global capital, just this month removing a hurdle for foreign investment into stocks and bonds. Officials are also preparing to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the People\u2019s Republic on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cSome risk-averse investors and those in need of liquidity might sell off stocks ahead of the long holiday just to play it safe,\u201d said Sun Jianbo, president of China Vision Capital Management in Beijing. \u201cI\u2019d expect the downside to be limited as the U.S. and China are resuming trade talks.\u201d\n\nIntegrating China\u2019s capital markets into the global financial system has been a priority for the country\u2019s policy makers since late 2017. In the year since MSCI Inc. first added mainland shares to its benchmarks, China has been expediting measures that make it easier for overseas investors to manage risk. Index provider Russell also embraced A shares this year, though last week it made the surprise decision to spurn Chinese bonds.\n\nBloomberg LP, the parent of Bloomberg News, also offers indexes for stocks and bonds. Bloomberg Barclays (LON: ) started a phased inclusion of some Chinese sovereign debt into its benchmarks in April.\n\nBy the 11:30 a.m. break, overseas investors had sold a net 1.4 billion yuan ($197 million) of A shares via exchange links with Hong Kong. September is still on track to be a record month of buying, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nForeigners drive about 10% of daily turnover in China\u2019s domestic stocks, according to data compiled by Bloomberg earlier this year. They own about 3.1% of the retail-dominated $6.7 trillion market, almost as much as the country\u2019s mutual funds. International investors increased their holdings of Chinese debt to 2 trillion yuan in August, about 2% of the country\u2019s bond market.\n\nWhile winning index inclusion is one way to attract the billions of dollars pegged to major benchmarks, U.S. investment in onshore markets remains limited. Residents had just over $200 billion of long-term mainland Chinese financial assets as of June, according to the U.S. Treasury. That\u2019s little more than double held in South Africa.\n\nCalm had just returned to mainland markets after months of worsening economic data and the twists and turns of the trade war. While there was evidence of profit-taking in stocks last week, volatility in the fell to near its lowest in 19 months. The yuan enjoyed its calmest week since July as traders speculated Beijing wanted to ensure stability ahead of the celebrations.\n\nThe Shanghai gauge typically performs well before the National Day holiday, rising on the last trading session in all years but one in the past decade.\n\nMonday will be the last chance for investors to price in the possibility of worsening tensions with the U.S. ahead of another round of trade talks scheduled for October. China\u2019s biannual extended holidays have recently proven to be a vulnerability for mainland investors, who have had to wait to react to bleak news.\n\nThat\u2019s a risk they may not want to take this time.\n\n\u201cA lot of retail guys are taking money out of the stock market ahead of the holiday week\u201d, said Gerry Alfonso, director of international business department at Shenwan Hongyuan Group Co.", "description": "Chinese Stocks Drop as U.S. Considers Limiting Investor Flows", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEEBK0BV_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
