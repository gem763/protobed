The true colours of of the species aren\u2019t actually known. (Illustration: Davis Maas)\n\nAn updated analysis of a 77-million-year-old fossil found in Alberta, Canada has resulted in the creation of a new genus and species of pterosaur. The newly named flying reptile, dubbed Cryodrakon boreas, featured an impressive 10 metre wingspan (but probably not the Canadian flag colours depicted above).\n\nWhen this species was first discovered in 1992, paleontologists knew very little about azhdarchids and their anatomy, owing to the poor fossil record. Azhdarchids were a group of large, long-necked, stork-billed flying reptiles that lived during the Cretaceous Period, 145 million to 66 million years ago. Working with a jumbled assortment of wing, neck, leg and rib bones, paleontologists tentatively assigned the specimen to the Quetzalcoatlus genus, a similarly large aerial reptile.\n\nAn updated analysis, in which new, previously unstudied fossils belonging to the same species were included, along with recent insights into azhdarchid anatomy, has shown that the specimen is not a Quetzalcoatlus, but an entirely new genus and species of azhdarchid. The new research, led by paleontologist David Hone from Queen Mary University in London, was published today in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology.\n\nBone from the middle of the neck of Cryodrakon.

That a creature of such size and weight could fly is hard to believe, but evidence does exist to suggest these enormous beasts were capable of flight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing challenge for paleontologists to piece together how the ridiculously huge azhdarchid pterosaurs launched themselves into the sky and flew,\u201d paleontologist Armita Manafzadeh, a PhD student in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Brown University, told Gizmodo in an email.\n\n\u201cAs we continue to learn more about the diversity of these critters and their body plans, we\u2019re slowly gathering the information that we need to better understand how they moved over 70 million years ago,\u201d said Manafzadeh, who wasn\u2019t involved with the new research.\n\nPhysical analysis of the fossils pointed to a number of distinguishing features that set it apart from Quetzalcoatlus. In particular, Hone and his colleagues identified neck bones in Cryodrakon that were proportionally shorter and wider, an extra pneumatopore (a hole that penetrates the bone) in its neck bones, and a thinner humerus (the long bone in the upper arm) compared to Quetzalcoatlus, among other unique characteristics.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, although some of the Cryodrakon bones described in this paper are beautifully preserved, we don\u2019t have both halves of any of the animal\u2019s major limb joints \u2014 frustratingly common for pterosaur remains \u2014 which makes biomechanical analyses difficult,\u201d said Manafzadeh. \u201cStill, every little bit helps us get a clearer picture of these strange creatures and their lifestyles.\u201d\n\nArtist\u2019s depiction of Cryodrakon boreas. (Illustration: David Maas)\n\nThe specimen uncovered in 1992 belonged to a young Cryodrakon, and it featured a 5-metre-wide wingspan. The neckbones of the new fossils pointed to a much larger animal at full maturity \u2014 one comparable in size to Quetzalcoatlus, which featured a 10.5-metre-long wingspan. The new study suggest azhdarchids were more diverse than is typically appreciated.\n\nThe significance of the new paper is that the authors identified an entirely new animal, a species that shouldn\u2019t be \u201clumped in\u201d with Quetzalcoatlus, said Hone in an email to Gizmodo.\n\nIt\u2019s \u201ca separate entity with its own biology,\u201d he said, and the \u201cdifferences in the respective proportions of the bones point to animals that were built a little differently to each other and were distinct.\u201d Cryodrakon, for example, featured a long neck, but one more robust compared to other azhdarchids, \u201cso maybe there\u2019s a lot more variety here than we realise,\u201d said Hone.\n\nMichael Benton, a professor of vertebrate paleontology at the University of Bristol who wasn\u2019t involved with the new research, said the new species was similarly sized to Quetzalcoatlus, \u201cbut was perhaps more sturdily built,\u201d he wrote to Gizmodo in an email. The fossilized remains are limited, \u201cbut the authors have made direct comparisons, and so their size estimates seem reasonable.\u201d\n\nIn terms of habitat and lifestyle, Cryodrakon would have lived in a tropical environment, feasting on small dinosaurs, lizards, and mammals. Big tyrannosaurs and even crocodiles might have hunted Cryodrakon, but we can\u2019t know for sure, as there\u2019s no direct evidence for this, such as bite marks, explained Hone.\n\nThat said, the bones of the 1992 specimen exhibited bite marks, and even an embedded tooth belonging to a small carnivorous dinosaur, likely a scavenger that feasted on its carcass.\n\nWe also asked Hone to comment on the artwork provided with the study\u2019s press materials, which feature a Cryodrakon with distinctly Canadian colours on its back and wings.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t take the colours in the artwork as correct,\u201d said Hone. \u201cThey are supposed to be fun and a tribute to Canada.\u201d At the same time, however, the colours are also \u201cplausible if a bit fanciful,\u201d explained Hone, pointing to the plumage of certain pheasants and other big birds such as cassowaries. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t know much about the colours of pterosaurs, he said, adding that more fossils could help.", "description": "An updated analysis of a 77-million-year-old fossil found in Alberta, Canada has resulted in the creation of a new genus and species of pterosaur.
