But why would the Turkish leader listen? After all, he has 3.6 million reasons not to.\n\nMerkel demanded that Erdogan bring his military operation against Kurdish militias in northern Syria to an \u201cimmediate end\u201d in a phone call on Sunday, a German government spokeswoman said.\n\nMerkel\u2019s admonishment comes as EU leaders prepare to meet in Luxembourg this week to plot a joint response to Erdogan\u2019s \u2018Operation Peace Spring\u2019, launched on Wednesday following a withdrawal of US forces in the region. Turkish warplanes have been pounding Kurdish positions across the Syrian border, while ground forces backed by Syrian rebel groups have moved in to strike the Kurdish fighters, whom Turkey considers terrorists.\n\nAlso on rt.com Turkey will push 35km into Syria and Western arms embargoes won\u2019t make it turn back \u2013 Erdogan\n\nIt also comes after Germany, France, Norway and the Netherlands suspended arms sales to Ankara and across the Atlantic US President Donald Trump threatened to hit the Turkish economy with \u201cpowerful sanctions.\u201d\n\nErdogan has vowed to \u201cnever stop this fight, no matter what anyone says.\u201d And why should he listen to European leaders, as they flex their soft-power muscles?\n\nThe Kurdish-held \u2018buffer zone,\u2019 which extends 30km (20 miles) deep into Syria from the Turkish border has been earmarked by Erdogan for the resettlement of some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees held in Turkey. Sending these refugees to Europe, he has warned, is the alternative.\n\n\"Hey EU, wake up. I say it again: if you try to frame our operation there as an invasion, our task is simple: we will open the gates and send 3.6 million migrants to you,\u201d he threatened in a speech to his party on Thursday.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Hey EU, wake up\u2019: Erdogan threatens to send millions of refugees to Europe if EU labels Turkish op in Syria an invasion\n\nThough Merkel herself welcomed more than a million refugees and migrants to Germany in 2015, she later admitted that her government was unprepared to deal with the scale of the influx. Across Europe, the wave of migration that followed led to the rise of populist parties in the polls, increased social tension and integration problems, and saw governments in Italy, Hungary, and Eastern Europe reject mass immigration.\n\nErdogan knows that he holds a Damoclean sword over Europe\u2019s battered establishment leaders, as do the Europeans.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron touched on this concern on Sunday, when he too spoke to Erdogan by telephone. \u201cWe have a common desire that this offensive ends,\" Macron said alongside Germany Chancellor Angela Merkel. \"This offensive risks creating an unsustainable humanitarian situation.\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Germany demands Greece steps up deportations to Turkey amid growing migrant flow\n\nEuropean leaders already promised Erdogan billions of euros of aid and visa-free travel for Turks in 2016 in a bid to keep refugees in Turkey. Erdogan has complained that his country has received but a fraction of the \u20ac6 billion promised between 2016 and 2019, and a cohort of EU officials flew to Ankara at the beginning of this month to persuade his government to keep the floodgates closed, dangling the promise of more aid cash in front of the Turkish leader.\n\nDespite their tough words, European leaders face a choice: allow Turkey to invade and settle its \u2018buffer zone\u2019, or deal with a refugee influx far beyond that of 2015. Erdogan, meanwhile, presented Merkel with a different choice:\n\n\u201cAre we allies in NATO or have you taken a terrorist organization into NATO, but we don\u2019t know about it?\u201d he told local channel NTV on Sunday. \u201cVery weird approach. Are you with us or with the terrorists?\u201d\n\nAlso on rt.com Europe on brink of new refugee crisis \u2018EVEN GREATER\u2019 than 2015 \u2013 German Interior Minister\n\nLike this story?
