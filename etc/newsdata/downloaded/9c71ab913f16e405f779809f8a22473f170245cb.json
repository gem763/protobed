He was signed by Indianapolis in May.\n\nBrian Hoyer, whom the Colts signed after Andrew Luck\u2019s suspension, is Jacoby Brissett\u2019s backup.\n\nThe Indianapolis Colts waived quarterback Chad Kelly on Wednesday. (AP)\n\nKelly\u2019s suspension stemmed from an incident last October; he was arrested by police in Englewood, Colorado, and charged with first-degree criminal trespassing for entering a home uninvited.\n\nHe allegedly entered the home around 1:15 a.m., after attending then-teammate Von Miller\u2019s nearby Halloween party. Kelly entered the home and sat down on the couch, where a woman was holding her young child; he was \u201cmumbling incoherently.\u201d\n\nThe male homeowner whacked Kelly with an aluminum vacuum tube and kicked him out of the house.\n\nKelly, the Mr. Irrelevant of the \u201817 draft and nephew to Hall of Famer Jim Kelly, was chosen so low not just because of on-field inconsistency, but also off-field red flags: he was suspended and then dismissed from his first high school team and he was dismissed from Clemson in April 2014 for conduct detrimental to the team. Several months after that, he was at a Buffalo nightclub and punched a bouncer in the face when the friend he was with was kicked out of the club; Kelly also threatened to \u201cget my AK-47 and spray this place,\u201d according to a police report. He pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in that case.\n\nStory continues\n\nKelly was also in the headlines in 2016 while playing at Ole Miss. During the team\u2019s bye week, he\u2019d attended the game of his younger brother, and ran out of the stands and onto the field when a late hit on his brother, the team\u2019s quarterback, led to a scuffle between both sides.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Kelly just wrapped a two-game suspension.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Kq3ckYuLyT8JevDq7g5pOg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/emN2XDW144N.aggihHuJwQ--~B/aD0yMjMxO3c9MzM0NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/dbe6cae0-da5d-11e9-bf59-0ac4e918ffe6", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
