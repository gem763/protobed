Don't fill up swimming pools and don't water any gardens. All we can do now is pray for rain,\" he said.", "description": "The water shortage in Barberton, Mpumalanga, is so critical that the Mbombela Municipality (Nelspruit) is set to ask the Ehlanzeni District Municipality to declare a part of the town a disaster area.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/6741/37e18b8af3b44b679677377bcf1e0dfb.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
