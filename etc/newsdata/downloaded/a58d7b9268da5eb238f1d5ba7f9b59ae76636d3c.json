The page also sheds light on a newer and improved Google Assistant, along with the previously teased motion gestures.\n\nThe page as of now has been taken down (to no-ones surprise), however, 9to5Google was able to get a screengrab of the page and now we have the exact specifications for the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4XL that are going to be launched tomorrow.\n\nFor starters, we know for a fact that Google's Pixel 4 and the Pixel 4XL are getting a dual-camera setup with a 12-megapixel and 16-megapixel shooter. The dual-camera was already teased by Google, but we never knew the camera specifications, until now. The front gets a single 8-megapixel selfie shooter.\n\nDon't Miss 534 SHARES 514 SHARES\n\nAs per the sheet, Pixel 4 is getting a 5.7-inch full-HD+ OLED panel, whereas the Pixel 4XL is getting a larger 6.3-inch QHD+ OLED panel. The leak also reveals that both the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4XL's displays are getting 'Smooth Diplay' which could hint the previous leak that indicated 90hz refresh rate.\n\nGoogle/Reuters\n\nThe devices are also getting 6GB of RAM (confirming more leaks from the past), along with Face Unlock feature. It is odd that the fingerprint unlock option isn't visible on this list, which could mean that the device isn't getting one.\n\nThe sheet also shed light on the battery stamina of the two devices. While the Pixel 4XL gets a decent 3700mAh battery, the Pixel 4 gets a tiny 2800mAh battery, which is disappointing, to say the least.\n\nOne crucial detail missing from this list is the pricing. That's something we'll have to wait and see at the launch event scheduled for tomorrow (only if that doesn't get leaked too).", "description": "Pixel 4 and Pixel 4XL's details leak once again, this time through a pre-order page on BestBuy Canada.
