I should have taken more responsibility and could have avoided the cut shot.\n\n\u201cWe had to play only one hour and 10 minutes, and I got out the first ball. So it became harder for the team. The dressing room would have felt more comfortable if I had stayed out.\u201d\n\nGiving his team zero marks out of 100 for the match, Shakib said they had to produce better players if they were to become more consistent.\n\n\u201cIf we want to play well consistently, we need to improve our quality and need more quality players.\u201d", "description": "Bangladesh skipper Shakib Al Hasan has taken full responsibility for their shocking home defeat to test rookies Afghanistan in the one-off match at Chattogram and says it would be best if someone else took over the captaincy.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428234982&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF890GX", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
