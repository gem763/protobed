Adam Schiff, D-Calif., in charge of the ongoing impeachment probe is a \u201chuge mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to someone named Adam Schiff who for all of his intelligence and abilities, he does not enjoy the respect of the other side the way [chairman of the House Judiciary Committee ] Peter Rodino did during [President Richard Nixon] and the way [fomer chairman of the House Judiciary Committee] Henry Hyde during [President Bill] Clinton.\u201d\n\nThe former independent counsel, speaking on Wednesday, added, \u201cHuge mistake to vest so much authority and power in someone who does not enjoy the respect on the other side.\u201d\n\nGOP REPS SAY SCHIFF STOPPED IMPEACHMENT WITNESS FROM ANSWERING CERTAIN GOP QUESTIONS\n\nStarr\u2019s comments came after a fiery news conference on Tuesday, when House Republican leaders contended that Schiff had prevented a witness in the latest impeachment hearing from answering certain questions from GOP members.\n\nRep. Steve Scalise, R-La., and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, told reporters that Schiff shut down a Republican line of questioning during a hearing with Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the latest current or former Trump administration official to come before Congress in relation to the impeachment probe.\n\n\"When we asked [Vindman] who he spoke to after important events in July -- Adam Schiff says, 'No, no, no, we're not going to let him answer that question,\"' Jordan said.\n\nDEMS INTRODUCE RESOLUTION FORMALIZING IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY PROCEDURES\n\nJordan went on to say that Schiff seemed to be breaking his own rules for the hearings, implying the chairman was acting almost like a \"lawyer\" for Vindman.\n\nVindman, who serves as a director on the National Security Council (NSC), testified before the House Intelligence, Oversight, and Foreign Affairs Committees. He expressed concern in his prepared opening statement, obtained by Fox News, over Trump's request to have Ukraine investigate political opponents.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe also stated that he does not know who the identity of the whistleblower whose complaint spurred the beginning of the Democrats' current impeachment inquiry and does not feel comfortable speculating .\n\nFox News' contributor Tyler Olson contributed to this report.", "description": "Fox News contributor Kenn Starr told \u201cThe Daily Briefing with Dana Perino\u201d on Wednesday that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Rep.
