Seven crew members were released on Sept. 4 but 16 have remained on board.\n\nIranian authorities said Monday that judicial proceedings against the Stena Impero had ended. While visiting New York City for the United Nations General Assembly, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani told reporters Thursday that \"the case file is going through its last stages in the court system, and I foresee that it will be freed.\"\n\nThe detention occurred about two weeks after British authorities detained the Iranian oil tanker Grace 1 off the coast of Gibraltar. Authorities raided the Grace 1 on July 4 on suspicion it was transporting oil to Syria in violation of European Union sanctions.\n\nThe U.S. had requested the continued detention of the Grace 1 but authorities in Gibraltar released it on Aug. 15, saying Iran had assured that it would not transport oil to Syria.\n\nThe ship, renamed the Adrian Darya 1, was later reportedly photographed near the Syrian port of Tartus. It at one point carried 2.1 million barrels of crude oil worth $130 million.", "description": "The Stena Impero had been detained by Iranian authorities since July over alleged maritime violations.
