(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 As they investigate President Donald Trump, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee will hold their first official hearing in what they are calling an impeachment investigation.\n\nCorey Lewandowski, Trump's outspoken former campaign manager, is scheduled to appear Tuesday to discuss the report by former special counsel Robert Mueller.\n\nBut it's unlikely that Democrats will get much new information. A devoted friend and supporter of the Republican president, Lewandowski isn't expected to elaborate much beyond what he told Mueller's investigators last year. Mueller himself testified this summer, with no bombshells. Two other witnesses who were subpoenaed alongside Lewandowski \u2014 former White House aides Rick Dearborn and Rob Porter \u2014 won't show up at all, on orders from the White House.\n\nThe hearing underscores what has been a central dilemma for House Democrats all year \u2014 they have promised to investigate Trump, aggressively, and many of their base supporters want them to move quickly to try to remove him from office. But the White House has blocked their oversight requests at most every turn, declining to provide new documents or allow former aides to testify. The Republican Senate is certain to rebuff any House efforts to bring charges against the president. And moderate Democrats in their own caucus have expressed nervousness that the impeachment push could crowd out their other accomplishments.\n\nStill, the Judiciary panel is moving ahead, approving rules for impeachment hearings last week. Among those guidelines is allowing staff to question witnesses, as will happen for the first time with Lewandowski.\n\nLewandowski was a central figure in Mueller's report, which said Trump could not be exonerated on obstruction of justice charges. Mueller's investigators detailed two episodes in which Trump asked Lewandowski to direct then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to limit Mueller's investigation. Trump said that if Sessions would not meet with Lewandowski, then Lewandowski should tell Sessions he was fired.\n\nLewandowski never delivered the message but asked Dearborn, a former Sessions aide, to do it. Dearborn said he was uncomfortable with the request and declined to deliver it, according to the report.\n\nPorter, a former staff secretary in the White House, took frequent notes during his time there that were detailed throughout the report. He resigned last year after public allegations of domestic violence by his two ex-wives.\n\nIn letters to the committee on Monday, the White House said that Dearborn and Porter were \"absolutely immune\" from testifying. White House counsel Pat Cipollone wrote that the Justice Department had advised, and Trump had directed, them not to attend \"because of the constitutional immunity that protects senior advisers to the president from compelled congressional testimony.\"\n\nIn a separate letter, Cipollone said that Lewandowski, who never worked in the White House, should not reveal private conversations with Trump beyond what is in Mueller's report. He wrote that his conversations with Trump \"are protected from disclosure by long-settled principles protecting executive branch confidentiality interests.\"\n\nDemocrats say the White House's rationale isn't legally sound. In a statement, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said the White House's position is \"a shocking and dangerous assertion of executive privilege and absolute immunity.\"\n\nHe added: \"The President would have us believe that he can willfully engage in criminal activity and prevent witnesses from testifying before Congress \u2014 even if they did not actually work for him or his administration.\"\n\nIn an effort to try and pry documents and testimony from the Trump administration, the Judiciary panel has filed two lawsuits \u2014 one against former White House counsel Donald McGahn, who also defied a subpoena earlier this year on Trump's orders. But the lawsuits could take months to resolve and Nadler has said he wants to make a decision by the end of the year on whether to recommend articles of impeachment against Trump.\n\nNadler, D-N.Y., made his own views clear in an interview Monday with a New York radio station, saying that in his personal opinion \"impeachment is imperative\" in order to \"vindicate the Constitution.\"", "description": "As they investigate President Donald Trump, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee will hold their first official hearing in what they are calling an impeachment investigation.
