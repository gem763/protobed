USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe celebration was about to go down in the visitors' locker room at SunTrust Park in Atlanta, where the St. Louis Cardinals had bombarded the Braves with a historic 10-run first inning that set up a 13-1 beatdown in Game 5 of the NLDS.\n\nBut what Cardinals manager Mike Shildt didn't know was that there was a camera rolling in the room and that he was being broadcast to thousands on Instagram.\n\nOn the verge of popping bottles, St. Louis rookie Randy Arozarena began an Instagram Live and caught his skipper's expletive-filled congratulatory speech, according to ESPN.\n\n\"The (Braves) started some (expletive). We finished the (expletive),\" Shildt said in the video. \"And that's how we roll. No one (expletive) with us ever. Now, I don't give a (expletive) who we play. We're gonna (expletive) them up.
