What really goes on out there? What do they do at Area 51? Are there aliens there? I\u2019d like to know,\u201d said Mr. Kaminsky, 43 years old, of Humboldt County, Calif.\n\nWhat started as a goof on Facebook this summer, \u201cStorm Area 51: They Can\u2019t Stop All of Us,\u201d is edging closer to reality. The post tallied more than 2 million RSVPs. \u201cLets see them aliens,\u201d it said. The mystery is how many will show. Regardless, the post spawned two festivals that begin Sept. 20.\n\nMr. Kaminsky launched his own Facebook group, Camp Storm Area 51, to coordinate rides and supplies. \u201cI do believe in aliens,\u201d he said. \u201cHow could you not?\u201d\n\nA warning sign at the Nevada Test and Training Range, commonly referred to as Area 51.

As a teenager, Ms. Barajas spotted a UFO the size of a compact car hovering outside her house in Anaheim, Calif. \u201cI would like to meet someone out there that had an encounter as well,\u201d she said.\n\nThe region\u2019s two businesses are trying to make the most of it. The Alien Research Center in Hiko, Nev., a roadside attraction and souvenir shop, sells everything from plastic little green men to Tequila bottles shaped like the heads of space aliens. Owner George Harris is hosting \u201cStorm Area 51 Base Camp,\u201d featuring UFO lectures and a telescope. He is preparing for thousands to descend.\n\nThe \u201cAlienstock\u201d festival opens the same day about 40 miles away, at Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn, the only motel and restaurant in Area 51\u2019s orbit. The phone has been ringing off the hook with callers too late to book one of the motel\u2019s 13 rooms, said Connie West, the owner. Over the past 30 years, she has seen the ups and downs of UFO interest. \u201cThis is my livelihood,\u201d she said.\n\nShare Your Thoughts Do you have a UFO experience? Join the conversation below.\n\nMs. West has ordered portable toilets for what she hopes will be paying customers for her campsites in Rachel, Nev., population in the double digits.\n\nRob Bowman, a 48-year-old pizza restaurant owner in San Saba, Texas, said he planned to set up camp on Bureau of Land Management property, after making the 20-hour drive with his 17-year-old son and two brothers-in-law.\n\nMr. Bowman is drawn to Area 51 the way people flocked to a remote butte in the 1977 extraterrestrial movie \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey had no idea why they had to get to that mountain, but they felt like they had to go. I feel like I have to go. It\u2019s nothing really to do with the aliens,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026Maybe the aliens have something to do with it.\u201d\n\nThe greeter at the Little A'Le'Inn in Rachel, Nev.

My whole life is the restaurant,\u201d Mr. Bowman said. \u201cSo, just to do something wild and crazy. That\u2019s probably one of the real reasons.\u201d\n\nLocal, state and federal officials are in a state of alert. The county sheriff\u2019s department has a dozen deputies to cover 1,200 square miles, and some experience tracking alien-seekers lost in the desert.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had everything from the curiosity-seekers to the UFO people to \u2018I\u2019m paying for this place, I want to know what\u2019s there,\u2019\u201d Lincoln County Sheriff Kerry Lee said. \u201cPeople who are just average Joes, to families, to a lot of foreigners.\u201d\n\nEric Vaughan, 45, of Portland, Ore., said he planned to bring 400 alien-theme T-shirts and 3,200 bottles of water to sell at Alienstock. He said he believes in distant forms of life but doubts any have visited Earth.\n\n\u201cIt really is for me more about the belief and the hope that there\u2019s other life out there\u2026rather than trying to meet aliens or anything like that,\u201d Mr. Vaughan said. \u201cI want to meet other people and make some friends.\u201d\n\nA bus drives an unpaved road from the Nevada Test and Training Range.

The Central Intelligence Agency first acknowledged the facility in 2013.\n\nCurious civilians are still ordered to keep out of the Nevada Test and Training Range, commonly referred to as Area 51. \u201cWhen an unauthorized person accesses a military installation they are detained until they can be turned over to the appropriate law-enforcement authorities,\u201d an Air Force spokeswoman said.\n\nChristopher Bader, a Chapman University sociology professor who studies how people view the paranormal, said many are turning away from traditional religion to a patchwork of beliefs that might include aliens, ghosts or Bigfoot.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re facing a crisis on how do we assess information, how do we assess evidence, what is good information and what is bad information,\u201d Mr. Bader said. \u201cThat\u2019s a real crisis of truth that the paranormal steps right into.\u201d\n\nA third of Americans in a recent Gallup poll said some UFO sightings have been alien spaceships visiting Earth, while 60% believed they could be explained by human activity or natural phenomenon.\n\nThe black mailbox on Nevada state route 375, also known as the Extraterrestrial Highway. Photo: Rollo Ross/Reuters\n\nSteve and Glenda Medlin, longtime cattle ranchers, said their mailbox had stood alongside state route 375, on a 98-mile stretch officially designated the Extraterrestrial Highway. Visitors began stuffing it with letters to aliens, and it became known in the UFO community as \u201cthe black mailbox.\u201d\n\nThe Medlins, patience worn thin, eventually removed it and got their mail delivered to the house. A stranger put up another black mailbox in its place.\n\nNow comes an army of prospective late-summer campers seeking answers.\n\n\u201cIf the people are coming from back East or wherever the hell they\u2019re coming from, they don\u2019t know what this desert is like,\u201d Ms. Medlin said.", "description": "A Facebook post has drawn the interest of millions in a meetup this month in the Nevada desert, close to the secretive military installation alleged to be keeping a trove of extraterrestrial secrets", "authors": ["Katherine Sayre"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104325/social", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
