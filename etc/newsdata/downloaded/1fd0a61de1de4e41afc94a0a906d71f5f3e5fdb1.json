The new government took office six weeks ago. [nL5N25W6EY]\n\nElbadawi told Reuters after the event he was \u201cabsolutely\u201d encouraged by his discussions with U.S. officials and lawmakers about getting Sudan removed from the terrorism list.\n\n\u201cI could feel that things are moving,\u201d he said. \u201cI could not give a specific date, but I\u2019m quite confident that it\u2019s just a question of time.\u201d\n\nDonald Booth, U.S. envoy to Sudan, gave no timetable, adding: \u201cWe want to make sure that what we see as a problem isn\u2019t continuing, and it depends on how long it takes for them to do that.\u201d\n\nElbadawi mapped out plans to restructure Sudan\u2019s budget and tackle inflation, but leave bread and petrol subsidies in place until at least June 2020. He said the goal was to replace those subsidies - which largely benefit residents in Mogadishu - with direct cash transfers to those most in need.\n\nTo smooth the transition, the government was also working to strengthen public transit in the city.\n\nHe said the government would also ask the 5-million-strong Sudanese diaspora to make deposits and shore up the central bank\u2019s reserves - an effort he said could generate $500 million. In the future, it could issue special diaspora investment bonds.\n\nThe U.S. State Department on Sunday chaired the fourth meeting of the \u201cFriends of Sudan\u201d group, which includes officials from Egypt, France, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Norway, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Britain, the African Union, the European Union, the United Nations, the African Development Bank, the IMF and World Bank.\n\nThe group said it was backing the transitional government\u2019s plans and could hold a donors\u2019 conference in spring 2020.\n\nElbadawi said Sudan\u2019s debt was around $62 billion, but the new government had asked the World Bank and African Development Bank to help reach a more precise assessment.\n\nHe said the country had about $3 billion in arrears with international financial institutions.\n\nChina had been and would remain an important creditor, but Sudan was keen to \u201cbroaden the base of our partnership, notably with the United States,\u201d he said.", "description": "Sudan's top financial official said on Tuesday he believed it was \"just a question of time\" before his country was removed from the U.S. state-sponsored terrorism list.", "authors": ["Andrea Shalal", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
