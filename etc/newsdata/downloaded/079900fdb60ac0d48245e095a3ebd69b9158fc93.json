(Joseph Prezioso/AFP)\n\n\u201cYale or jail. That\u2019s what the kids here think,\u201d a schools superintendent told me last spring. How times have changed. On Friday, Felicity Huffman was sentenced to 14 days in prison and 250 hours of community service for her involvement in paying to get her child higher SAT scores for college admission.\n\nThe new saying is more like, \u201cYou go to Yale, I\u2019ll go to jail.\u201d\n\n[The college admissions scandal is more proof that helicopter parenting hurts our kids]\n\nIs your kid\u2019s college acceptance so important that you would commit a felony to get them in? For some, the answer appears to be yes. Apart from the sad saga of the Rick Singer conflagration, I worry enormously about the secondhand smoke of a dumpster fire that is wafting across the landscape of American schools and families, as we as parents try to help our kids not only succeed as learners but also develop as people, citizens and workers.\n\nSomething has clearly gone wrong when parents are prepared to risk not just their own integrity but also their kids\u2019, as well as their freedom. And while the message that these guilty parents held in mind may have been I would do ANYTHING for you to have opportunity and success, here are the actual messages these young people received, all of which undermine their autonomy:\n\nIf you do not go to an elite enough college, you will not be successful in life.\n\nYou really cannot do this without me.\n\nWhere you go to college matters more than your (or my) integrity.\n\nIf you work hard and fall short of your goal, you cannot handle the rejection or adversity.\u200b\n\nThese falsehoods infect not just the guilty\u2019s kids, but also parents and students across the country who are transfixed by the whole sordid affair. Beyond the utter lunacy of the current college admission scandal is a much more widespread angst among parents and, increasingly, struggles among their kids. It is the compulsion that parents feel to control, manage or orchestrate outcomes for their kids that is at the heart of the matter.\n\nFor 25 years, I have helped students prepare for admissions tests. I\u2019ve worked with the children of some of the most wealthy, powerful and influential parents in the D.C. area. The kids of billionaires, senators, titans of industry \u2014 you get the idea. I\u2019ve also seen the kids of \u201cordinary\u201d parents, who, like I was, would be candidates for Pell Grants or at least some financial aid when they attended college.\n\nSome of the behavior I\u2019ve witnessed would make your hair stand on end. I\u2019ve had parents tell me, in the presence of their kids, that they would only pay for their child\u2019s education if it were at Harvard, Yale or Princeton, and not if they attended \u201cthose lesser Ivies.\u201d I\u2019ve had parents inquire about how much I would charge to work with their child and not anyone else within their child\u2019s school during that year, hoping to cut down on the competition. I\u2019ve had them let me know of the million-dollar pledge they\u2019ve made to an elite university, while acknowledging that it was the one school their child said they did not want to attend.\n\nI\u2019ve also witnessed some beautiful moments and heartfelt parenting. From my earliest clients in 1993, I took note of parents who\u200b had the kind of kids anyone would be proud to call their own. Their curious, kind, polite, hard-working and modest attributes were clear. What did these kids all have in common? Parents who seemed to support and encourage the higher education process without coddling or pushing.\n\nParents have always wanted to help their kids succeed. Those with more (more wealth, more education, more time) have the opportunity, and option, to do more. But even if you could give your kid everything, should you? What to give and what to withhold? And what outcomes deserve time, attention and support?\n\nThose questions sound as if they\u2019d have obvious answers: Education! Success! Opportunities!\n\nI propose another: fostering in kids the sense that this is their life. If it seems obvious, it\u2019s not; I see far too many parents who, perhaps out of ego but more likely out of fear, feel the compulsion to manage their children\u2019s lives as though their kids were their avatars.\n\nDuring my time in education, and increasingly in the past decade, psychologists have noted ever-increasing rates of anxiety and depression in young people. \u201cSnowflakes!\u201d\u200b some exclaim. Others deride the \u201cfailure to launch\u201d generation, seemingly devoid of grit, drive or work ethic, raised with trophies for participation. Why don\u2019t kids today have any motivation not tied to a grade, praise or reward? I have a client who angsts about her son, \u201cHe\u2019s SO entitled!\u201d as though he raised himself. Meanwhile, she had lined up three hours of academic tutoring four days a week, justifying it by saying, \u201cWithout the tutor, he won\u2019t do anything.\u201d\n\nAnother parent, when faced with the college choices presented by his daughter\u2019s college counselor, looked at the list derisively and said, \u201cI expected so much more from my daughter.\u201d And a dear friend, when being dropped off at college, had her mother anxiously blurt out, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to handle college without me!\u201d Presumably, she believed that her daughter had been successful in high school, and earned admission to the college of her dreams, only because of the help she had given her. These hypervigilant parenting approaches are widely accepted and yet not effective at raising an independent human being.\n\nThe name of your college is not the determinant of your career success, earnings, relationships and happiness, especially if you are already wealthy. Many people describe college as \u201cthe gateway to success.\u201d We would do well to broaden that to help kids think of college as \u201ca gateway to success.\u201d\n\nAs parents, as educators, as citizens, we should want all children to be as educated as possible. It is good for them and good for our society to not leave talent untapped or potential undeveloped. But today we are seeing more kids faltering or falling off the path, often because of stress disorders. If kids want to grind for an elite school, that\u2019s cool. But it\u2019s the fallacious sense that they have to that causes so much stress and, in the case of the Varsity Blues college admission scandal, mayhem.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly to many parents, I\u2019ve helped kids do better on school tests and standardized tests alike by lowering their stress and their perceived importance of the test. Feeling that you must do something that feels impossible impairs performance. So we can improve performance, lower stress, improve mental health and do less damage to our relationships with the young people we care so much about by de-emphasizing tests as the end-all and be-all.\n\nOne of the most empowering messages you can deliver to a student is, \u201cI have confidence in your ability to make good decisions and, if things don\u2019t work out as you planned, to figure things out from there.\u201d\n\nIf our kids cannot apply to college without some extrajudicial parental involvement, or deal with possible rejection, I submit it is we, not they, who have failed the test of preparing for college.\n\nNed Johnson is the president of Prep Matters and co-author of \u201cThe Self-Driven Child.\u201d\n\nFollow On Parenting on Facebook for more essays, news and updates.
