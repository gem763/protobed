They thought it illogical and wrong that laws should be set by the overmighty bureaucrats of Brussels, of whom they have never heard and for whom they have never voted.\n\nWith significant opposition lining up to thwart it, Mr Johnson faces an uphill battle to get the deal through in the extraordinary sitting of Parliament - the first on a weekend since April 1982.\n\nMr Johnson's key and influential allies in the DUP have already rejected his departure agreement, while the SNP has tabled an amendment to reject the deal demanding an immediate extension to the October 31 deadline and a general election.\n\nNicola Sturgeon has ruled out her MPs in the SNP backing the deal, insisting it will mean Scotland alone is 'treated unfairly' when the UK leaves.\n\nMr Johnson's key and influential allies in the DUP have already rejected his departure agreement, while the SNP has tabled an amendment to reject the deal demanding an immediate extension to the October 31 deadline and a general election\n\nJeremy Corbyn was quick to dismiss the PM's agreement, criticising it for creating a customs border in the Irish sea, and saying: 'As it stands we cannot support this deal.'\n\nMr Rees-Mogg added: 'Those of us who have the great privilege of sitting as MPs ought to vote for this deal.\n\n'We must vote for it so that Brexit can be delivered. It is a great injustice meted upon the British people by the political class that the joyful decision they took, born out of confidence and resolution, should have become so associated with stasis and stagnation.\n\n'Let us stagnate no more. Let us speculate no more.'", "description": "In a rallying cry, the MP for North East Somerset and the leader of the House of Commons, urged his colleagues to vote for the deal so 'Brexit can be delivered.'", "authors": ["Joe Middleton For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/02/19865490-0-image-a-26_1571360621343.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
