Photo: AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Trump administration often seems hammer-headed in its determination to pursue an objective single-mindedly if it\u2019s important to Trump himself and his key MAGA supporters. But hey, sometimes Team Trump can try to kill two birds with one stone, as Gizmodo\u2019s Brian Kahn observes:\n\nThe Trump administration continued its twin, often intertwined wars against California and the climate on Tuesday, suing the state for participating in a program to reduce its carbon pollution.\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) is arguing that the state\u2019s cap-and-trade program\u2014essentially a market for companies to trade emissions\u2014is unconstitutional because it includes Canadian province Quebec. While it will likely take a long time for the suit to shake out, the filing alone is yet another sign that the Trump administration is hellbent on stalling any climate action.\n\nIt seems the administration is trying a fresh angle to kill the cap-and-trade system after business interests failed in state courts to invalidate it. Claiming California is trying to conduct its own foreign policy by expanding the cap-and-trade market to include Canadian companies is indeed a novel complaint, and one that legal beagles aren\u2019t sure about, as the Los Angeles Times reports:\n\nDavid Wright, an assistant professor at the University of Calgary Faculty of Law, who has studied California\u2019s agreement with Quebec, said that while there is some case law supporting the Trump administration\u2019s legal argument, \u201cthe case is extremely far from a slam dunk.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would suggest that this litigation will not be successful because the cap-and-trade regime was carefully structured to not have key characteristics of formal international agreements,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if unsuccessful, though, this litigation is problematic because it will affect market confidence in this emissions trading regime.\u201d\n\nAnd that\u2019s obviously fine and dandy with the administration, which is shameless about its hostility to any action at the federal or state levels to address climate change. Kahn quotes one legal authority who is crying \u201cshame!\u201d anyway:\n\n\u201cMy initial reaction [to the case]: it\u2019s appalling that instead of suing polluters, the Trump administration is suing those trying to stop pollution,\u201d Michael Gerrard, the director of Columbia\u2019s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, told Earther in an email. \u201cThe least they could do is get out of the way.\u201d\n\nFat chance of that. As the Times notes, this is just the latest in a series of Trump initiatives aimed at hamstringing California\u2019s environmental efforts:\n\nThe Trump administration has steadily escalated its attacks against California\u2019s ability to crack down on air and water pollution. In September, it revoked a decades-old rule that empowered California to set tougher car emissions standards than those required by the federal government, prompting the state to file a lawsuit in response. Then, in the span of about a week, Trump\u2019s Environmental Protection Agency sent letters threatening to cut federal highway funding for California over alleged Clean Air Act violations and accusing the state of failing to protect its water.\n\nIn addition, the Department of Justice has launched an antitrust investigation into whether four automakers violated federal competition law by reaching a voluntary emissions agreement with California.\n\nOne of the great ironies about the lawless man who occupies the White House is that he\u2019s always been extremely litigious, always happy to deploy lawyers to frustrate and intimidate his enemies, as Dana Milbank observed last year:\n\nWhen he ran for president, he had been involved in some 4,000 lawsuits, a USA Today tally found, about 40 percent filed by Trump and his businesses. He brought the practice with him into politics, threatening to sue, or actually suing: Sen. Ted Cruz (\u201cfor not being a natural born citizen\u201d), Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Univision, the publisher of \u201cFire and Fury,\u201d the Club for Growth, the Culinary Workers Union, the Republican Party, restaurants that pulled out of Trump International Hotel in Washington, the Associated Press, his former ghostwriter, NBC, ABC and women who accused him of sexual misconduct. Now Trump\u2019s administration is suing California to stop its \u201csanctuary cities\u201d policy, and to stop it from buying federal land that Trump wants to privatize.\n\nAnd that was before all the suits and regulatory actions aimed at the Golden State\u2019s pioneering anti-pollution programs. The stakes in this latest suit, notes the Times, are big and tangible:\n\nCalifornia\u2019s cap-and-trade program has raised billions of dollars since its launch through the auction of pollution permits. But so far, the program is not a major driver of cuts in greenhouse gases \u2014 most of which are being achieved through other, more traditional regulations including those on fuels, vehicles and power generation\u2026.\n\nRegardless, California regulators say the program\u2019s role must increase dramatically in the coming years if the state is to meet its ambitious target of slashing greenhouse gas emissions to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030. The state Air Resources Board\u2019s plan calls for cap-and-trade to become the single biggest driver of emissions reductions by 2030, responsible for more than one-third of emissions cuts.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom, who has seen this movie repeatedly, wasn\u2019t conciliatory at all in his reaction to the latest suit:\n\n\u201cFor years our state has proudly participated in a number of environmental partnerships that tackle the devastating effects of climate change to our health and economy,\u201d the governor said. \u201cThis latest attack shows that the White House has its head in the sand when it comes to climate change and serves no purpose other than continued political retribution.\u201d\n\nQuick translation: Bring it on.", "description": "In the latest in a long series of regulatory actions and lawsuits aimed at California\u2019s environmental efforts, the Trump administration is suing to kill the state\u2019s cap-and-trade admissions market, which includes Quebec.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/10/23/23-california-smog.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
