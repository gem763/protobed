An innocent man would never say \u201cI do not believe I did it.\u201d Asked if he was leaving open the possibility that he did in fact do the horrible things of which he has been accused, McCarrick said \u201cNo.\u201d Everyone is lying. He is an innocent man.\n\nMcCarrick specifically denied the accusation that finally turned Pope Francis against him \u2014 that he had molested a young boy during the sacrament of confession. Never mind that McCarrick was expelled from the priesthood after a canonical trial found him guilty of \u201csolicitation in the Sacrament of Confession, and sins against the Sixth Commandment with minors and with adults, with the aggravating factor of the abuse of power.\u201d Never mind that he appealed that decision and lost. \u201cThe thing about the confession, it\u2019s a horrible thing,\u201d he said, \u201cI was a priest for 60 years, and I would never have done anything like that. \u2026 That was horrible, to take the holy sacrament and to make it a sinful thing.\u201d\n\nYes, it was horrible. So was sexually abusing two other minors and forcing young priests and seminarians to share your bed. It\u2019s all horrible. But no matter, McCarrick says they are making it all up. Asked why so many seminarians would come up with the same story, McCarrick said \u201cI think that they were encouraged to do that\u201d by unnamed \u201cenemies.\u201d\n\nHe also lashed out at Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan\u00f2, the former papal nuncio to the United States, who revealed last year that he had personally informed Pope Francis about the serious allegations against McCarrick and named more than a dozen cardinals he said covered up McCarrick\u2019s abuses. \u201cHe was talking as a representative of the far right, I think,\u201d McCarrick said of Vigan\u00f2. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say he\u2019s a liar, but I think some of the bishops have said that he was not telling the truth.\u201d\n\nActually, Vigan\u00f2 was telling the truth. In May, Monsignor Anthony Figueiredo, a former McCarrick aide, released portions of McCarrick\u2019s emails and private letters that confirmed many of Vigan\u00f2\u2019s charges. McCarrick\u2019s own correspondence shows that senior Vatican officials, including the secretary of state, the head of the Congregation for Bishops, the papal nuncio to the United States and Cardinal Donald Wuerl were all aware of the accusations against him. McCarrick also acknowledges the restrictions imposed on him in 2008, including that he not travel without express Vatican permission, resign from all roles at the Holy See and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, and not come to Rome. McCarrick later flouted those restrictions and became a close adviser to Pope Francis, which prompted Vigan\u00f2\u2019s warning to Francis that, at \u201cthe Congregation for Bishops there is a dossier this thick about him\u201d \u2014 a warning Francis ignored.\n\nLast September, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo, president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, asked Francis to order a full investigation \u2014 called an \u201capostolic visitation\u201d \u2014 into the McCarrick affair. His request was denied. But in October, Francis did order a review of documents already \u201cin the Archives of the Dicasteries and Offices of the Holy See.\u201d What\u2019s taking so long? Both Vigan\u00f2 and Figueiredo cited specific letters and documents, including that thick dossier in the Congregation for Bishops. Nearly a year later, nothing has been released.\n\nIt is simply pathetic that almost everything we know about the McCarrick coverup has come not from the church itself but from investigative journalists, grand juries and whistle-blowers. Even worse is the fact that his many enablers in the Catholic hierarchy have still not been held to account. And McCarrick is not the only abuser whose actions were covered up by bishops. Shamefully, many are still in positions of power today. McCarrick\u2019s shocking interview should serve as a reminder that we cannot rest until every single one of them has been exposed and removed.\n\nRead more:\n\nElizabeth Bruenig: Theodore McCarrick has been defrocked.
