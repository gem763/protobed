It Could Soon Cost You A Lot More", "language": "en", "text": "A Gal\u00e1pagos beach. (Photo: National System of Protected Areas)\n\nOfficials at Gal\u00e1pagos National Park are considering a substantial rate hike for visitors, a move that could make the islands a lot more inaccessible \u2014 which is exactly their goal.\n\nThe Gal\u00e1pagos Islands are an environmental treasure. Home to giant tortoises, blue-footed boobies, marine iguanas and Darwin\u2019s famous finches, the Ecuadorian archipelago has lots of natural wonder to offer. Tourists now flock to the Gal\u00e1pagos to the tune of around 276,000 visitors a year, according to statistics compiled by Observatorio de Turismo de Gal\u00e1pagos.\n\nThe ceaseless influx of visitors is putting considerable pressure on the island\u2019s fauna and flora, prompting officials at Gal\u00e1pagos National Park to consider a sizeable rate hike for tourists coming to the archipelago, reports the New York Times.\n\nThe current entrance fee of $150 hasn\u2019t budged in the past 20 years (Ecuadorians pay just $9 to visit the Gal\u00e1pagos, which, good for them). At the same time, however, costs to maintain the archipelago have most certainly gone up.\n\nA forest of prickly pear cacti in the Gal\u00e1pagos. (Photo: National System of Protected Areas)\n\nAccordingly, officials with Gal\u00e1pagos National Park have been giving serious consideration to a rate hike, culminating in a recent proposal. While contemplating the rate hike, park officials considered the costs needed to maintain and protect the islands, while also comparing entrance fees to popular theme parks, like Disney and other wildlife preserves, namely Serengeti National Park in Tanzania.\n\nThe proposed rate hike would scale according to two possibilities, according to the New York Times. If visitors to the Gal\u00e1pagos stay in mainland Ecuador for at least three nights, the cost would be $300 per person. But if visitors spend less than two nights in mainland Ecuador, the price would jump to $600 per person.\n\nThe rationale behind this scheme, aside from the increased revenue and potentially lower volume of visitors, is to boost tourism in Ecuador itself. Daniela Tamayo C\u00f3rdova, a member of the Gal\u00e1pagos Government Council, told the New York Times that the added revenue would be \u201cused to improve sustainability, tourist experiences, and conservation and management.\u201d\n\nThe group has set a deadline of December 31, 2019 to approve the new entrance rate, which would kick in about a year after approval, according to the proposal.\n\nThe Gal\u00e1pagos Islands are as special as they\u2019re fragile, and they shouldn\u2019t be treated like a generic tourist destination peppered with hotels, bars and related distractions. But sadly this is precisely what\u2019s transpiring.\n\nA Galapagos tortoise on the Island of Santa Cruz bathing in a pool. (Photo: Michael Perry)\n\n\u201cPeople are imagining pi\u00f1a coladas with sea lions and partying all over,\u201d Fernando Diez, the marketing director for Gal\u00e1pagos tour company Quasar Expeditions, told the New York Times. \u201cGal\u00e1pagos is not that.\u201d\n\nIndeed, there are now over 150 restaurants and bars in the Gal\u00e1pagos, according to Observatorio de Turismo de Gal\u00e1pagos, and over 300 hotels \u2014 an increase of 235 hotels in just 10 years, reports the NYT. To compound this, Airbnbs are emerging as a popular affordable option among tourists to the islands. There\u2019s currently no limit to the number of visitors who arrive by plane, but limits are in place to cap the number of visitors arriving via cruise ships.\n\nAll these tourists are putting added pressure on the islands by stressing out local wildlife, potentially introducing invasive species, and contributing to waste, among other threats.\n\nThe proposed rate increase is a good way for park officials to invest back into the island and ensure conservation efforts are adequately funded, but at the same time, it could make the islands only accessible to the rich. Whether it would hurt the local economy, particularly the burgeoning tourist industry, remains to be seen.\n\nThat said, what matters most is the ongoing preservation of the Gal\u00e1pagos islands. Having them become another Hawaii or Fiji would be a complete \u2014 and fully preventable \u2014 tragedy.", "description": "Officials at Gal\u00e1pagos National Park are considering a substantial rate hike for visitors, a move that could make the islands a lot more inaccessible \u2014 which is exactly their goal....", "authors": ["Jason Torchinsky", "Catie Keck"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/b7orbik44mq0ymmrieln.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
