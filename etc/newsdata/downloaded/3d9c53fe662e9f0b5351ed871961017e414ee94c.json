Bernie Sanders speaks during the Democratic presidential candidates debate in Westerville, Ohio, October 15, 2019. (Shannon Stapleton/Reuters)\n\nThe Scandinavian countries Bernie Sanders professes to admire are not actually all that socialist.\n\nIf socialist wannabes in America fail to look at the facts, the United States might finally succumb to socialism. The American Left\u2019s love affair with Scandinavian socialism is dangerous because it holds the possibility of hoodwinking enough of the populace into voting to replace the capitalist system that made America great with the socialist system that made Stalin all powerful and the people all hungry. They say the republic dies when the majority discovers it can vote to take other people\u2019s stuff. Let\u2019s hope that day remains elusive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow pervasive is the Left\u2019s admiration for Scandinavian \u201csocialism\u201d? Well, it\u2019s definitely not limited to Bernie and his campaign followers. Hillary name-drops Sweden and Denmark as well. You can even go back 20 years and find Bill Clinton waxing poetic about Denmark. Bill even claimed that \u201cFinland, Sweden and Norway offer more chances for individuals to out-earn their parents than the United States does.\u201d No news on Chelsea moving to Scandinavia anytime soon.\n\nBut it is Bernie who is most enamored. In fact, according to CNN, \u201cBernie Sanders\u2019 American Dream is in Denmark\u201d and \u201cBernie Sanders . . . won\u2019t stop talking about\u201d the Danes. Sanders is quoted as saying: \u201cIn Denmark, there is a very different understanding of what \u2018freedom\u2019 means . . . they have gone a long way to ending the enormous anxieties that comes with economic insecurity.\u201d Sanders plays the income-inequality trope: \u201cInstead of promoting a system which allows a few to have enormous wealth, they have developed a system which guarantees a strong minimal standard of living to all\u2014including the children, the elderly and the disabled.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe irony is that while American socialists want to become like Scandinavian socialists, Scandinavian socialists want to become more like American capitalists. I remember hearing a fellow senator put it this way: \u201cThe American Left wants to become Western Europe. Western Europe wants to become Eastern Europe. Eastern Europe, sick of socialism and Communism, wants to become American capitalists!\u201d Indeed, the Danes seem a bit squeamish about all the attention from Bernie and want to make sure that the rest of the world knows they are not, in fact, socialist and are open for business.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the \u201csocialist\u201d label that might concern the Danes. Denmark\u2019s economic success is inseparable from free trade and low corporate-income taxes. Bernie\u2019s policy decisions are the opposite of policies the Danes believe foster their success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIndeed, before Republicans lowered the U.S. corporate tax in 2018, Denmark\u2019s corporate tax was significantly lower than ours. Bernie, on the other hand, has not been a fan of free trade or lower corporate-income taxes.\n\nIn the MSNBC New Hampshire Democratic presidential debate, Bernie responded, \u201cI do not believe in unfettered free trade. I believe in fair trade which works for the middle class and working families, not just large multinational corporations. I was on the picket line in opposition to NAFTA. We heard people tell us how many jobs would be created. I didn\u2019t believe that for a second because I understood what the function of NAFTA, CAFTA, PNTR with China, and the TPP is, it\u2019s to say to American workers, \u2018Hey, you are now competing against people in Vietnam who make 56 cents an hour minimum wage.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn corporate taxes, Bernie\u2019s opinion has been consistent: In the fall of 2018, on one of the Sunday shows, Bernie emphatically argued that if the Democrats retake the Senate, corporate taxes would \u201cabsolutely\u201d go back up. However, the Scandinavian countries Bernie professes to admire believe the opposite. They support low, competitive corporate taxes and have embraced the free-trade agreements.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Danes are vocal in distancing themselves from Bernie\u2019s policies and quite emphatically don\u2019t want to be known as a bad place to do business. The executive editor in chief for Politiken, a Danish newspaper, writes: \u201cThere is this idea that we are a heavily regulated society with a closed economy. The opposite is true.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs Chris Moody of CNN writes, \u201cIn terms of pure semantics, few Danish politicians today would characterize themselves as \u2018socialist\u2019\u2014even a \u2018democratic socialist\u2019\u2014as Sanders does. The word has largely fallen out of fashion in recent decades.\u201d\n\nLars Christensen, a Danish economist, writes: \u201cWhen I hear Bernie Sanders talk about himself as a democratic socialist, it\u2019s a little bit 1970s. The major political parties on the center-left and the center-right would oppose many of the proposals of Bernie Sanders on the regulatory side as being too leftist.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nExcerpted from The Case Against Socialism, by Rand Paul.
