Dolphins ripped by Ravens, 59-10", "language": "en", "text": "We suspected the Miami Dolphins would be bad \u2014 even really bad \u2014 after letting some good players walk this season, and with dreams of Tua Tagovailoa perhaps dancing in their head.\n\nBut this bad?\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Dolphins went into halftime down 42-10 to the Baltimore Ravens in a brutal first two quarters for new head coach Brian Flores.\n\nThings didn\u2019t get better, either.\n\nThe Ravens scored a franchise best for points in the 59-10 destruction. Last season, the Ravens whipped the Bills, 47-3.\n\n[Watch live local and prime-time NFL games free on your phone with the Yahoo Sports app.]\n\nThere have been only 14 games in the NFL\u2019s modern era (since 1970) with that many points allowed. The record for points allowed is 62, which has been done four times, the last one coming in 2011.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be better next week,\u201d Flores said after the game.\n\nThey had better. Incoming are the New England Patriots, perhaps with Miami resident Antonio Brown making his Pats debut.\n\nIt was not a good start to the season for Ryan Fitzpatrick and the Miami Dolphins in Week 1. (Getty Images)\n\nHere\u2019s how bad things went for Miami\n\nThe defense was torched for two long touchdowns by Ravens rookie Hollywood Brown on his first two NFL touches.\n\nDolphins QB Ryan Fitzpatrick was picked on the fourth offensive play of the season, one of two first-half turnovers for Miami.\n\nAnd the Ravens pulled off a fake punt for good measure, too.\n\nThe Dolphins pulled Fitzpatrick and threw in Josh Rosen at QB ... and Rosen was picked on his second pass attempt.\n\nAnd even though the Ravens yanked starting QB Lamar Jackson \u2014 who threw for a career-high five TD passes \u2014 they still scored. Backup Robert Griffin III led a TD drive early in the fourth quarter, scoring on a 4th and goal play.\n\nJust to rub it in a bit.\n\nHowever, the Ravens could have made it worse. After deep driving into Miami territory late, they took a mercy knee to end this thrashing.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf the Dolphins are tanking, they\u2019re sure not making it look like they\u2019re doing it artfully.\n\nHow bad? Historically bad, it turns out\n\nOnly four teams in NFL history have been outscored by 32 or more points in the first half of an opener, according to Pro Football Reference, and no team has allowed more than 35 points in the first half of a Week 1 game in league history.\n\nThe last team to allow 42 or more points in the first half of a game? That would be the Chicago Bears in 2014.\n\nAnd for you stats nerds out there, this was the first 59-10 final score in NFL history. How about that?\n\nThe Dolphins did score in a two-minute drill at the end of the half, turning a 42-3 deficit into a 42-10 game.\n\nSo ... at least they were still trying for a bit?\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Dolphins were not expected to be good.
