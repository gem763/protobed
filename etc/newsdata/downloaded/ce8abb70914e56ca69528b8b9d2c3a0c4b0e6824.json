Or protectiveness? These cases have been tested for fit, strength, protection level and durability and all are available in sizes for both the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus (which means they almost all fit the iPhone 6, 6s and 7 in both sizes too).\n\nNote that the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are both capable of wireless charging when placed on a compatible charging pad.\n\nThe cases here are all thin enough to allow the phone to charge wirelessly without you removing them, apart from the Pipetto, where the outer folio case must be removed while the inner case stays in place.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

The case clips very firmly on to the back (it\u2019s not the sort of case you can slip on and off every day) and clever ridges around the front mean that even if you drop it face down, it should remain in one piece.\n\nInside the case there are thoughtful extra cut-outs for a spare SIM card and, even more usefully, a perfectly shaped pocket for the SIM card removal tool, which you would otherwise lose on day one. Case finishes include carbon fibre, bamboo and leather so you can match the case to your style. The company has recently branched out into other accessories including a FlexLine charging cable which won\u2019t fray or break \u2013 its carbon fibre braid is strong enough to pull a car, Mous says.\n\nBuy now\n\nLucrin wallet case: from \u00a394, Lucrin\n\nThe huge range from Lucrin is made up of exceptionally good quality cases. The company has a huge range of colours, leathers and styles. These vary from sleeves to pouches with pockets or you can choose one with a pull tab to slide the phone out even more quickly. Depending on the style you choose, there can be literally scores of colours to choose from. The wallet case has space for cards and banknotes, and the leather is strong but thin, so it barely adds any thickness to the handset. You can also customise the cases further with your initials or contrasting threads, with the option to remove the Lucrin logo if you prefer. Not cheap, but very attractive and full of tactile pleasure.\n\nBuy now\n\nMoshi overture vegan leather wallet: \u00a334.95, Moshi\n\nThe slick Moshi folio protects the iPhone by wrapping around it. In the front section there\u2019s one slot for cash and three for credit cards. There\u2019s even a small screen cleaning cloth included which is detachable and washable. Like the other cases here, the wireless charging capability available on the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus is still accessible with this case on. The design means that you can flip it over and it\u2019ll stand the phone up at just the right angle so you can watch video on it.\n\nBuy now\n\nTech21 pure clear case: \u00a329.95, Tech21\n\nIt seems a shame, doesn\u2019t it, to hide the iPhone that you\u2019ve at least partly chosen for its beauty under a case? So, it\u2019s worth considering a transparent carrier which means you can still show it off while keeping it safe. Impact protection materials in the case\u2019s edges mean your phone remains safe even if you drop it from a two-metre height. It\u2019s pretty slim and lightweight and the material used means it won\u2019t yellow, look old or even get scratched.\n\nBuy now\n\nApple silicone case: \u00a345, Apple\n\nLots of companies make protection for iPhones but Apple\u2019s own cases have a snappy design and great build quality. Its silicone cases are grippy enough to ensure the phone won\u2019t accidentally slip from your hand. The button coverings work perfectly with the volume and power switches they protect, and though all the cases here fit the iPhone exactly, there seems to be an extra precision here. There are plenty of chic colours to choose from: white, rose red, cosmos blue, pink sand, midnight blue, black, red and snazziest of all, spicy orange.\n\nBuy now\n\nPipetto 2-in-1 leather magnetic folio: from \u00a324.95, Pipetto\n\nPipetto\u2019s clever case is two for the price of one. There\u2019s an internal case which is a slim and practical shell to protect the back of the phone. But it also comes with a leather folio with two dedicated card slots and an extra slot for cards or cash. The shell slots into the folio and is held in place magnetically. The folio is attractive and useful. To charge the iPhone wirelessly, you remove the phone from the folio and place it in its shell on the charging pad.\n\nBuy now\n\nApple leather case: \u00a345, Apple\n\nApple\u2019s leather iPhone cases are sumptuous and attractive. As they age, they take on a patina that looks just as good as it does new. None more so than the saddle brown option, though there are other colours available: soft pink, midnight blue, black and red. Buying the last option means a contribution is made towards the fight against Aids. The cases fit perfectly, of course, and stay resilient and effective throughout their life. A tiny lip at the front is almost unnoticeable, but quite enough to keep the phone safe even if you place it face down on the table, for instance.\n\nBuy now\n\nSena Ultraslim classic leather sleeve: from \u00a314.99, Amazon\n\nIf you like using your iPhone without a case, a sleeve is ideal, as you simply slide it off to answer a call or use the phone in any other way. Sena\u2019s sleeves are beautifully crafted and extremely slim so they feel great. The fit is impressive; it holds the phone tightly but slips off with minimum pressure. A soft lining made of microsuede is part of the excellent fit and helps keep the phone clean.\n\nBuy now\n\nSnakehive vintage wallet: \u00a326.95, Snakehive\n\nSnakehive is a British company that makes high-end accessories including neat iPhone folio cases. There are plenty of colours to choose from, in glossy or matte finishes, including pastel shades made from nubuck leather. The front of the folio has room for three cards and banknotes, it closes magnetically and the leather is very pleasing to the touch while still being hard-wearing. The rubberised case that holds the phone securely offers some shock protection. It\u2019s also designed so it can hold the iPhone in a perfect position for viewing video.\n\nBuy now\n\nPeel super thin iPhone 8 case: \u00a324, Peel\n\nIf you would really rather use your iPhone without any case at all but want some kind of protection, this offering from Peel is the best solution. At only about a third of a millimetre thick, the Peel case fits perfectly and is barely noticeable \u2013 though for complete protection, consider a screen protector as the case only covers the back of the iPhone. Many of the cases are translucent so the Apple logo peeps through, though the jet black version is that bit darker. Peel also makes a jet white version which is especially attractive.\n\nBuy now\n\nNodus access case III: \u00a334.99, Nodus\n\nNodus keeps its cases thin by using a pad covered with millions of microscopic suction cups to hold the phone in place instead of a clip or cradle which would make it heavier and thicker. Attaching the phone just right can take a couple of goes but it then stays in place securely. As a result, it\u2019s thinner than many folio cases. The leather is strong and sturdy but supple enough to feel both comfortable and classy.\n\nBuy now\n\nMophie juice pack wireless: \u00a389.95, Apple\n\nDo you want more from a case than just protection? Like a way of extending the iPhone\u2019s battery life, perhaps. Mophie makes rechargeable battery packs for IPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, which significantly extend the phone\u2019s life between charges. You flick a switch to recharge the phone from the case when it\u2019s running low. You can also connect the case to a laptop and it will automatically recharge the phone first, the case second. There\u2019s also plenty of shock protection in the soft-touch rubber case, though please note it does bulk the phone up a bit.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: iPhone 8 and 8 Plus cases\n\nThe best combination of looks and protection is the Mous limitless, though Pipetto\u2019s 2-in-1 folio is the most versatile case on test. And for quality, you really can\u2019t beat Lucrin\u2019s sumptuous leather wallet case.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
