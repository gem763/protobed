It also claims that Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked a predecessor of the Ukrainian president to \u201clook into Joe Biden,\u201d which Giuliani reportedly admitted doing to CNN's \"Cuomo Prime Time.\u201d The complaint also claims that Trump personally ordered to freeze aid to Ukraine. Greg Valliere, AGF Investments chief U.S. policy strategist, told Yahoo Finance\u2019s On The Move that even if nothing comes of these allegations, it still may impact Trump\u2019s likelihood of re-election.\n\n\u201cThis is totally unchartered waters... It doesn\u2019t affect earnings.. certainly not GDP, maybe consumer confidence plummets. I think the one thing markets have to worry about is that Trump's re-election looks a little less likely,\u201d Valliere said. \u201cI don't see him getting convicted but I do see him maybe having a really tough fight with Elizabeth Warren and it\u2019s not totally out of the question that she could win and the markets really have to worry about that one.\u201d\n\nWhile some folks who Valliere talked to people on Capitol Hill thinks everything could get done by year end , he thinks it will drag into 2020.\n\n\u201cTrump has the ability maybe to use this as a foil, look it\u2019s a Witch Hunt, say these left wing members of Congress are trying to undo the results of our last election. Trump is not without rhetorical arguments should this drag on,\u201d he said.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., joins a rally of organized labor to show support for union workers, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, Sept. 24, 2019.

Scott Applewhite) More\n\nMeanwhile members of Congress will be distracted by the impeachment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard to get much done. I don\u2019t see a drug pricing bill, I see tremendous acrimony over a budget that might not get done until New Year\u2019s Eve and the Canadian deal, I think has lower prospects. Nancy Pelosi is keying all of this and now she\u2019s got different priorities,\u201d said Valliere, referring to the Speak of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a Producer for Yahoo Finance.
