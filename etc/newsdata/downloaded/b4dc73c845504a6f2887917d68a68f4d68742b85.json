An outstanding MP & Minister. One of the strongest speakers in Parliament. Principled, patient, thoughtful. I feel certain he\u2019ll be back.\u201d\n\nStewart \u2013 who ran to be Tory leader earlier this year but subsequently lost the whip over his opposition to a no-deal Brexit \u2013 appeared as a surprise guest at Letters Live, an evening of readings of correspondence.\n\nAt the event, Stewart told the audience that his appearance \u201cconstitutes my resignation from the Conservative party\u201d, before reading the 1982 letter to Johnson\u2019s father, Stanley, from his teacher Martin Hammond.\n\n\u201cBoris really has adopted a disgracefully cavalier attitude to his classical studies,\u201d the letter begins.\n\nAppearing on a bill that also featured the actors Olivia Colman, Jude Law and Benedict Cumberbatch, Stewart read: \u201cBoris sometimes seems affronted when criticised for what amounts to a gross failure of responsibility \u2026 I think he honestly believes that it is churlish of us not to regard him as an exception, one who should be free of the network of obligation which binds everyone else.\u201d\n\nDonna Lalek (@DonnaLalek) @RoryStewartUK has been a very naughty boy! pic.twitter.com/KLAj1ThuFm\n\nStewart, a former cabinet minister, made an outsider run for the party leadership against Johnson earlier this year that ultimately fell well short of success but catapaulted him to public prominence.\n\nHe had already hinted that he might leave the party in the weeks since he lost the whip, along with 20 others, as a result of rebelling against the government to oppose a no-deal Brexit in a crucial House of Commons vote. While that step pushed him and others, including Philip Hammond and Ken Clarke, out of the parliamentary grouping and seemed likely to mean their future deselection as Conservative candidates, it did not mean they were automatically kicked out of the national party.\n\nSpeaking at the GQ Awards in September, he said: \u201cYou\u2019ve made me Politician Of The Year and I\u2019m no longer a politician.\u201d\n\nAt a philosophy and music festival, he told the audience that if Johnson succeeded in taking the UK out of the EU this month he would resign. \u201cIt would be the end of my political project.\u201d", "description": "MP says he will stand down at next election, before reading out Eton letter about Boris Johnson\u2019s \u2018gross failure\u2019", "authors": ["Peter Walker", "Jonathan Lis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2000f3bb783a203f464d704123c6d5e9faa6fb5f/0_50_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1eab083918245ca8049327ce7f1cda87", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
