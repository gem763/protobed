Here's how to use it.\n\nCheck out the products mentioned in this article:\n\nHow to connect your iPhone to an LG Smart TV\n\nHere are eight simple steps for mirroring your iPhone to an LG Smart TV with the free TV Assist app:\n\n1.

You may need to disable any VPN services on the iPhone.\n\n6. That's pretty much it \u2014 you can sign into as many third-party streaming or uploading services as you care to within the app, allowing you to access content beyond just what's physically on your phone.\n\nYou may notice that there are several other mirroring apps in the App Store. Some are pricey. Some are prone to crashing. Some are both.\n\nAfter testing these apps, we found TV Assist to be the best all-around compromise.\n\nThe free version is highly serviceable on its own, and the ads are not terribly invasive, although there is also a paid version that removes ads and allows unlimited media storage within the app.\n\nRelated coverage from How To Do Everything: Tech:", "description": "It's easy to connect an iPhone to your LG Smart TV with the free third-party app TV Assist, and mirror content between devices.
