Thanks for waking up with us.\n\nOn The Hill\n\nREPUBLICANS LASH OUT AT TRUMP ON SYRIA: The split between the GOP stance on impeachment and Syria is dramatic and head-spinning for many observers, including many Republicans no longer serving in government who have called for their party's lawmakers to crack down on President Trump for what see as a string of bad behavior.\n\nGOP staffers on the Hill, however, say the reasons for the split screen are quite clear: Republicans are going to defend Trump when it comes to his personal behavior, while they're less likely to do so on long-standing issues of foreign policy \u2014 and imminent matters of life or death.\n\n\u201cThe litmus test for Trump is the personal politics,\u201d a GOP Senate aide told Power Up of the way their boss views handling differences with the president. \u201cPeople who want to come out against Access Hollywood, or tweets about the Squad, or impeachment \u2014 that is the test. Not policy. So you can break with [Trump] on policy if it's a position on principle, you just can\u2019t break with him on the little stuff he cares about.\u201d\n\na GOP Senate aide told Power Up of the way their boss views handling differences with the president. \u201cPeople who want to come out against Access Hollywood, or tweets about the Squad, or impeachment \u2014 that is the test. Not policy. So you can break with [Trump] on policy if it's a position on principle, you just can\u2019t break with him on the little stuff he cares about.\u201d \u201cThere is more of a gravity to the situation than other things we deal with \u2014 like his tone and his behavior,\u201d another Republican congressional aide told us. \u201cBut this has real quick ramifications that we are seeing playing out.\u201d\n\nanother Republican congressional aide told us. \u201c This is an instant life or death situation,\u201d a former National Security Council staffer under President George W. Bush told Power Up of the decision to abandon the Kurds \u2014 11,000 of whom died fighting to help the U.S. defeat ISIS in Syria.\n\na former National Security Council staffer under President George W. Bush told Power Up of the decision to abandon the Kurds \u2014 11,000 of whom died fighting to help the U.S. defeat ISIS in Syria. The bottom line: The Senate GOP views the \u201cforeign policy mistakes as much more damaging and lasting than Trump's other actions. Everyone forgets Trump's tweets, but nobody will forget if our Kurdish allies are massacred,\u201d according to GOP strategist Alex Conant.\n\nOf course, there's always a risk in breaking with Trump on an issue but \u201cmany Republicans feel far safer doing so on more distant issues of foreign policy, where Trump often finds himself outside of his party\u2019s historic positioning, such as Syria, than on matters that personally affect Trump, such as impeachment, according to party officials and strategists,\u201d my colleagues Phil Rucker and Bob Costa report.\n\nPolitically, according to a former Hill staffer who now works on Syria issues, this \u201cis an opening for Republicans to distance themselves from Trump\u201d and it doesn't \u201cthreaten him domestically.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the GOP perspective, there is a close connection between the Kurds and Christians. So they are not seen as threatening. They were our allies against the extreme embodiment of political Islam,\u201d the source told Power Up.\n\nthe source told Power Up. Hmmm: \u201cThe complexity with Syria, Turkey and the Kurds is beyond the normal person\u2019s understanding,\u201d former North Carolina governor Pat McCrory (R) told Bob and Phil. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those issues that seems to be important, but no one understands the complexities. All you hear is, \u2018Trump might have made a mistake there,\u2019 but not much more than that.\u201d\n\nBut: Most Republicans have been reluctant to take that risk on other matters of party orthodoxy, including on tariffs and trade. And the argument that Syria is about national security is hard to swallow, some said, when the U.S.-Ukrainian relationship affects national security, too.\n\nSome Republicans were simply livid at what they viewed as Trump abandoning the Kurds and making way for a Turkish incursion into northern Syria. Here's GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger (Ill.), an Iraq War veteran, on CNN last night:\n\nGOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger breaks ranks with Pres. Trump calling his Syria decision \"disgusting\" and \"sickening.\" https://t.co/oHAMFWp7Ry pic.twitter.com/7K70p2cEic \u2014 Anderson Cooper 360\u00b0 (@AC360) October 10, 2019\n\n'Visceral': For GOP hawks, many of whom slammed President Obama for his approach to Syria, the reaction to Trump's withdrawal is \u201cvisceral,\u201d according to the former NSC staffer.\n\n\u201cWe have seen this movie in recent history \u2014 it wasn't long ago that ISIS was attacking cities in Europe \u2014 and people have lived it viscerally for a while,\u201d the staffer told Power Up. \u201cThis is the type of thing that will live in the history books as a dishonorable act and betrayal of our allies.\u201d\n\nTrump's gonna Trump: Trump called the Turkish offensive \u201ca bad idea\u201d but defended his decision to pull U.S. troops from northeast Syria on Wednesday at the White House. Americans are tired of \u201cendless wars,\u201d he said, and noted the Kurds \u201cdidn't help us with Normandy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey should go back, by the way,\u201d Trump said of the ISIS prisoners that may escape as Turkey entered northen Syria. \u201cThey should go back to Europe. Many of them came from Europe, but they should go back to Germany, to France, to \u2014 I spoke with Boris Johnson a couple \u2014 to UK. Some to UK, actually. But they came from various parts of Europe. They didn\u2019t come from our country, and we did them a big favor.\u201d\n\nHow to lose [Congress] and alienate people: The president's show of defiance only exacerbated tensions in Congress:\n\nShortly thereafter, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) tweeted he had \u201cbipartisan agreement with Sen. Chris Van Hollen on severe sanctions against Turkey for their invasion of Syria. While the Administration refuses to act against Turkey, I expect strong bipartisan support.\"\n\n\u201cMany of these senators have spent years working on the Syria issue, only to read in the paper that Trump was surrendering,\u201d Conant told Power Up. \u201cTrump's announcement came without warning or explanation, which is never a good way to build Senate support.\u201c\n\nYou are reading the Power Up newsletter.

Pompeo weighs in: In an interview with PBS NewsHour's Judy Woodruff, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denied the decision to leave northeastern Syria gave the greenlight to Turkey to attack the Kurds: \"Well, that\u2019s just false. The United States didn\u2019t give Turkey a green light.\u201d\n\nErdogan's plan: The Turkish president told world leaders at the U.N. two weeks ago that Ankara had a plan to settle one million Syrian refugees in a \"safe zone,\" Reuters's Dominic Evans scooped.\n\n\"...Erdogan held up a map of the region setting out ambitious proposals to build dozens of new villages and towns to settle Syrian refugees.

You'll recall that Sondland's lawyer was reportedly informed by voicemail at 12:30 a.m. Tuesday that the ambassador could not testify as scheduled.\n\nWho to watch: If the House impeaches Trump, it's up to the Senate whether to remove him from office, so what Senate Republicans are or are not saying is vitally important.
