And getting into the festive spirit is Coronation Street Kym Marsh, who is taking on a very wintry role following her exit as Michelle Connor.\n\nElf: A Christmas Spectacular promises to be the \u2018biggest live Christmas show in the world\u2019 and is an on stage adaptation of the festive film favourite.\n\nKym, who is playing Buddy the Elf\u2019s girlfriend Jovie, said: \u2018I\u2019m delighted to be getting back on stage and joining the cast of Elf this December. Elf is an iconic Christmas film and having seen the musical myself last year I am very excited to be part of this fun and heart-warming family show.\u2019\n\nThe show will tour Liverpool, Glasgow and London and is perfect for families and Christmas obsessives. Kym will be joined by EastEnders legend Shaun Williamson (Barry, of course!) as well as her own 8-year-old daughter Polly.\n\n(Picture: Elf: A Christmas Spectacular)\n\nPolly will play a naughty child who has a confrontation with Santa. Kym smiled: \u2018It\u2019s amazing that I get to share the next part of my acting journey with Polly. She loves acting and performing, so for her to land her first role aged eight is great, and we\u2019re all so proud of her.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s lovely to think she wants to follow in my footsteps and I know she\u2019ll do a great job. I think she was born to be in the spotlight \u2013 she\u2019s quite the little character.\u2019\n\nKym and Polly will have their work cut out \u2013 Elf: The Christmas Spectacular features three stages, a flying sleigh and an audience snowball fight.\n\nIt sounds like a lot of fun and laughter \u2013 the exact opposite of the dramatic exit planned for Michelle, who is destined to discover that her fiance Robert Preston (Tristan Gemmill) has been living a double life and is having a baby with another woman.\n\nAfter the anger and angst that this is certain to bring, we bet Kym can\u2019t wait for the lighter role this Christmas.\n\nYou can buy tickets for Elf: A Christmas Spectacular by heading to the website.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "The Corrie star is moving onto something different entirely.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/kym-marsh-6963_1570188585.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
