Bayer's shares helped the healthcare index climb\n\n0.6%, while other defensive stocks popular in times of economic\n\nstrife - food and beverage and utilities - were\n\nalso leading gains.\n\nBy 0800 GMT, the pan-European STOXX 600 index was\n\nlittle changed, after it tumbled last week on tensions over\n\ntransatlantic trade wars and a spate of weak U.S. and European\n\ndata.\n\nEurope's blue chip STOXX 50 outperformed, adding\n\n0.1%.\n\nGermany's DAX declined 0.3% after data showed\n\nindustrial orders in August fell slightly more than expected,\n\nunderscoring concerns of a recession in Europe's largest\n\neconomy. \"European stock markets will be eyeing the trade talks and\n\nBrexit and may show little direction at the start of the week,\"\n\nsaid Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com.\n\nA report that said China officials are increasingly\n\nreluctant to agree to a broad trade deal with the United States,\n\nkept investors nervous ahead of the trade negotiations starting\n\non Thursday. \"Hopes of a comprehensive trade deal being agreed this week\n\nare slim,\" Wilson said.\n\nTrade-sensitive automakers dropped 1.1%, leading\n\ndeclines among major sectors.\n\nAmong individual stocks, Austria's AMS tumbled 4.7%\n\nafter the company said it failed in its 4.5 billion euro ($4.9\n\nbillion) takeover attempt of German lighting group Osram\n\n. Osram was down 4.1%. Both were leading declines on\n\nthe benchmark STOXX 600. London-listed shares of HSBC Holdings Plc fell 1%\n\nafter a report over the weekend said the banking group was\n\nplanning to cut up to 10,000 jobs to lower costs. Investors will also be looking at developments around the\n\ncrucial talks between London and Brussels this week on the\n\nBrexit withdrawal deal, with a looming make-or-break Brexit\n\nsummit on Oct. 17 and 18, and the Britain's EU departure set for\n\nOct. 31.\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE 1-European shares muted as gains in defensives outweigh nerves on trade, Brexit", "description": "UPDATE 1-European shares muted as gains in defensives outweigh nerves on trade, Brexit", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/Brazil-Stock-Market_3_800x533_L_1414427437.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
