Mkhwebane was to pay 7.5% of the DA\u2019s costs and as much of Casac\u2019s in her personal capacity.\n\n\u201cThis left about 7.5% of both the DA\u2019s and Casac\u2019s costs unaccounted for. Upon realising that she had made an error, the learned judge attempted to invite the parties to a closed meeting in her chambers to amend her judgment.\u201d\n\nHe said Mkhwebane naturally declined the invitation and objected to the process by insisting that the cost order be amended or reviewed in an open court, in accordance with the rules.\n\nHowever, he said, the judge overruled Mkhwebane and proceeded to amend the ruling, which she then shared with the parties.\n\n\u201cIn terms of the amended ruling, the Public Protector\u2019s office will pay 92.5% of the DA\u2019s costs and as much of Casac\u2019s costs. In her personal capacity, the Public Protector will still be responsible for 7.5% of each of the applicants\u2019 costs.\u201d\n\nSegalwe said Mkhwebane \u201caccepted that judges do err too and has no qualms with the amended ruling\u201d.\n\nShe has also \u201caccepted the manner in which the judge dealt with the matter, although she would have preferred that the matter be dealt with in an open court\u201d.", "description": "The high court judge who found against Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane in the Estina dairy farm matter \u2013 which implicated former president Jacob Zuma\u2019s benefactors, the Gupta family \u2013 has since had to adjust the cost order made during her ruling.", "authors": ["Setumo Stone"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1765/1f6c7362fa2040b2a59e2ed34327d2a2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
