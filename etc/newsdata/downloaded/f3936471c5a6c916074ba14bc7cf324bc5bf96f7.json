Gen. Sakolket Chantra, worked with the Royal Household Bureau and sometimes represented the palace in public events. He was accused of \"evil\" actions \u2014 an expression that means serious misconduct \u2014 indiscipline and exploiting his job for personal gain, the statement said.\n\nThe others, attached to palace guard units, were similarly accused.\n\nThe ousted consort, Sineenatra Wongvajirabhakdi, had been a senior officer in a palace security unit.\n\nSineenatra was stripped Monday of her positions and decorations for actions undermining the position of Queen Suthida, the king's official wife, for her own benefit. The palace accused her of coveting the queen's privileges, and not stopping her scheming even after being granted in July the prestigious title of Royal Noble Consort.\n\nIt has been almost a century since a Thai king has had a formally designated consort.\n\nSineenatra's whereabouts are not known.\n\nAlthough not publicly stated, the timing and circumstances suggested that some of the officials' dismissals were related to the consort's ouster. One of the officers served in the same security unit as Sineenatra, and another was a certified nurse working as a royal page in the royal chamber \u2014 bedroom \u2014 the same profession the consort pursued before coming to the palace.\n\nQueen Suthida is the king's fourth wife, after three previous marriages ended in divorce.\n\nThe breakup with former consort Sineenatra recalls Vajiralongkorn's 2014 falling out with his third wife, Srirasmi Suwadee, when he was still crown prince. In that case, several relatives were arrested shortly before the split-up was announced. Her parents were arrested for abusing their royal connection, and an uncle who was a senior policeman was sentenced to more than 30 years in prison for corruption.\n\nSrirasmi lost her royal titles and privileges, and was sent to live in what amounted to house arrest in western Thailand.\n\nVajiralongkorn ascended the throne in 2016 after the death of his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who reigned for seven decades.\n\nVajiralongkorn has proved to be a more activist king than his father, who ruled as a constitutional monarch, acting discreetly and at arm's length from administrative affairs.\n\nThe new king has assumed greater personal ownership and direction of royal finances, estimated to exceed $40 billion, and had several plots of prime real estate in the capital, Bangkok, revert to the palace's direct control. He has also asserted more power over the military and the governing body of Buddhist monks.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
