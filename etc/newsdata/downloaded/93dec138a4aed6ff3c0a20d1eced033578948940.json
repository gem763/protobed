President Trump made clear long ago that he wanted to get out of the Middle East, but even some of his own supporters evidently assumed that he would not follow through or that someone would stop him.\n\nAs a result, the international crisis that many of his opponents feared for so long has finally arrived, but it is one of Mr. Trump\u2019s own making and one that pits him against his own party and his own government. The Turkish assault on America\u2019s Kurdish allies that he effectively facilitated reflects his foreign policy in its rawest Trumpian form.\n\nIt is a foreign policy built primarily on reflex and increasingly resistant to outside advice. Unimpressed by the national security establishment and uninterested in the tedium of traditional policymaking, Mr. Trump often demonstrates more faith in what some overseas strongman tells him than the soft-boiled guidance of the bureaucrats, diplomats, intelligence analysts and military officers in the Situation Room.\n\n\u201cThis may be the riskiest national security decision that he\u2019s made to this point,\u201d said Richard Fontaine, the chief executive of the Center for a New American Security and a former aide to President George W. Bush. \u201cI don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve learned anything new about the president\u2019s decision-making style, but it does reveal the very significant risks that that style carries.\u201d", "description": "Having upended Middle East policy, the president is now trying to find a way to reverse the consequences as Turkish forces bombard the Kurdish fighters who helped overpower ISIS.", "authors": ["Peter Baker", "Lara Jakes"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/10/us/politics/10dc-prexy1/10dc-prexy1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
