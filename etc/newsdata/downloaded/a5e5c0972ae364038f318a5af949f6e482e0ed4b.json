So when people get unwell making sure they stay in their room to stop spreading it to other people.\u201d\n\nThe Indian Pacific from Sydney to Perth: a trip to Australia through the middle of nowhere Read more\n\nThe company has also removed and cleaned curtains as needed, provided alcohol hand gels, and even removed some carriages. The train has completed at least three journeys since without incident.\n\nFlood said the outbreak was connected to \u201cmainly one section of the train\u201d.\n\nThe Indian Pacific journey runs between Sydney on Australia\u2019s Pacific coast to Perth on its Indian Ocean coastline. Holiday packages go up to more than $10,000 per person, stopping in towns along the southern Australian route.\n\n\u201cSome [infected passengers] have been getting off the train and some have just continued on the train being in isolation,\u201d Flood said.\n\n\u201cThe people on the Indian Pacific train tend to be older because that\u2019s just the clientele,\u201d Flood said. \u201cSo when you get unwell when you\u2019re older, it can affect you a little more than it does in a young, healthy person.\u201d\n\nLesley Thompson, 80, told the Sydney Morning Herald she boarded the train in Sydney on 11 September and fell ill the following day when they stopped over in Hahndorf, South Australia.\n\n\u201cI was throwing up everywhere,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt was vile.\u201d\n\nThompson was taken to hospital by ambulance with an irregular heartbeat, the report said, but she counted herself lucky.\n\n\u201cOur next stop was Cook on the Nullarbor Plain with a population of four.\u201d\n\nNorovirus is highly contagious and health monitors report around a dozen outbreaks on cruise ships each year.\n\nIn 2015 a cruise ship docked in Sydney with more than 180 passengers who had contracted the virus, and two other outbreaks in the US saw more than 200 cruise ship passengers struck down with it.\n\nGreat Southern Rail told News Corp it had taken \u201cevery available measure\u201d to control the norovirus outbreak, and it would continue to monitor and liaise with the health department.\n\n\u201cThe health and wellbeing of our guests is paramount and we have acted quickly to respond to this situation, including communicating with all those boarding our recent journeys.\u201d", "description": "Australian health authorities say they are working with Indian Pacific operator to control norovirus outbreak", "authors": ["Helen Davidson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/59b6f167461611c703d8f00f640be9750e623d6f/0_941_2060_1235/master/2060.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0a5129460d2aa03d11b6c0ecdc9f3a20", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
