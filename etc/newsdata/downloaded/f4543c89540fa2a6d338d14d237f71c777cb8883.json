Gorsuch, on the other hand, appears to have been shot from a cannon.\n\nAt his inaugural oral argument in April 2017, President Trump\u2019s first choice for the Supreme Court asked 22 questions. In the term just completed, Gorsuch wrote more dissents than any other justice and typed out a whopping 337 pages of opinions. Again, more than anyone else.\n\nAlong the way, he has established himself as one of the court\u2019s most conservative justices and a reliable vote for Trump initiatives that have reached the Supreme Court \u2014 the travel ban on those from mostly-Muslim countries, adding a citizenship question to the census form and allowing a ban on transgender service in the military to go into effect. He has shown a willingness to overturn precedent and an impatience with more reticent colleagues.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics Courts_Law Everything-Conservatives-Hoped-For-And-Liberals-Feared-Neil-Gorsuch-Makes-His-Mark-At-The-Supreme-Court"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
