However, it went horribly wrong and turned out to be a disaster, she was left with \u201chuge blue lumps\u201d in her lips.\n\nShe admired the \"pillowed pouts\" fillers that a lot of other people had and wanted to get them too, but she ended up with lumpy and swollen lips.\n\nPA Real Life\n\nShe had to actually shell out extra \u00a3700 to get the fillers dissolved. She was so traumatised by the entire experience that she decided to \u2018train in facial aesthetics to prevent others from suffering the same fate as her\u2019, according to Mirror.\n\nDon't Miss 28.9 K SHARES 11.9 K SHARES 6.9 K SHARES 3.9 K SHARES 6.5 K SHARES\n\nThis is what she reportedly said about the entire experience, \u201cMy lips swelled up after I had the filler injected, which I initially thought was normal \u2013 but after a week you could see all these huge blue lumps and they felt rock hard. You could see them when I was talking. I was so self-conscious.\"\n\nPA Real Life\n\n\u201cI was in shock at what I ended up going through for what I\u2019d thought was a simple procedure.\"\n\n\"As a result, I decided to train in facial aesthetics to understand what had gone wrong \u2013 but now, I also want to help other people looking to get fillers done to make sure they understand the risks.\"\n\n\"I get so many women coming in for corrective work after getting botched fillers, and they always say the same thing, \"I went somewhere cheap'.\"\n\nPA Real Life\n\n\"But you have to think, it\u2019s cheap for a reason, and it ends up costing you far more to fix it.\u201d\n\nShe explained: \u201cMy lips were very lumpy and uneven, so I went back to the injector who had done them, and they suggested that even more filler would even them out.\"\n\n\u201cLooking back, I know that\u2019s not right now, but at the time, I trusted what I was being told and just wanted it fixed.\"\n\n\u201cSo, I had another one milliliter injected \u2013 meaning I\u2019d had two milliliters in just two weeks.\"\n\n\u201cI woke up and my lips were more swollen than ever \u2013 literally about two centimetres in front of my face \u2013 and rock hard.\u201d\n\nPA Real Life\n\nNow that she is a trained professional at The Dental Surgery in Clifton Village, Bristol, she uses her experience to warn others of the risk involved in the procedure.\n\n\u201cI was never told about risks or complications, so I want to make sure that the patients who come to me understand exactly what will happen before I put that needle in,'' Mirror quoted her saying.\n\nIt is commendable that she wants to make sure that no one has to go through the painful experience that she went through.", "description": "Sometimes even the most complicated surgeries become successful without any complications and sometimes the simplest of procedure can become a nightmare for someone.
