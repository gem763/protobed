That is the right strategy, but preserving the simplicity of their message will require real discipline, especially when there is pent up appetite among many Democrats\u2014both in Congress and in the general public\u2014to hold Trump accountable for all sorts of alleged wrongdoing he has committed as president.\n\nAlthough the impeachment process is formally an investigation, the process also educates the public, and mustering public support will be absolutely crucial for moving forward. In my experience as a former federal prosecutor and as a trial lawyer in private practice, a key to winning any trial is to tell the simple story and force the other side to tell a more complicated one. The goal is to appeal to the part of the brain that does not require active analysis to understand the point. To appeal to jurors (or in this case, the public) in their \u201cgut.\u201d\n\nI can understand why many lawmakers want to add obstruction of the Mueller investigation to the inquiry, because there is overwhelming evidence that Trump obstructed that investigation. That seems simple to many people. But it\u2019s impossible to explain how Trump obstructed justice without first discussing the underlying Mueller investigation. And proving those allegations would require the testimony of Trump allies like Corey Lewandowski, who defiantly thumbed his nose at House Democrats during his recent testimony.", "description": "", "authors": ["Renato Mariotti", "Politico.Com Magazine Story"], "top_image": ""}
