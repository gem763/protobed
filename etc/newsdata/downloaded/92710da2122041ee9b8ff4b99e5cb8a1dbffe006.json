Ted Cruz (R-TX) after she posed a question asking if someone could \u201ccite which passage of the Bible God states it is a God-given right to own a gun.\u201d\n\nMilano was responding to Texas lawmaker Rep. Matt Schaefer, who explained on Twitter why he is refusing to \u201cuse the evil acts of a handful of people to diminish the God-given rights of my fellow Texans.\u201d\n\nSchaefer argued gun control remedies would not \u201cstop a person with evil intent.\u201d\n\nAn excellent Q, worth considering carefully w/o the snark of Twitter. It is of course not the right to a modern-day firearm that is God-give but rather the right to Life & the right to Liberty. Essential to that right to life is the right to DEFEND your life & your family. 1/x https://t.co/8pjstMGrGB \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 1, 2019\n\n2/x The right to self-defense is recognized repeatedly in the Bible, eg Exodus 22:2: \u201cIf a thief is caught breaking in at night & is struck a fatal blow, the defender is not guilty of bloodshed.\u201d (Note, though, verse 3 says it IS murder if during daylight (ie, not self-defense). \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 1, 2019\n\n3/x The Declaration of Independence acknowledges our rights thusly: \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201d \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 2, 2019\n\n4/x And, for that reason, the Second Amendment provides \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear Arms, SHALL NOT be infringed.\u201d It wasn\u2019t to protect people\u2019s ability to hunt, or to shoot target practice, but to defend their lives, their homes & their families. \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 2, 2019\n\n5/x Stephen Willeford exercised that fundamental right when he risked his own life to stop the Sutherland Springs murderer, saving countless others as a result. \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 2, 2019\n\n6/x St. George Tucker, one of the most important scholars in early America, explained the reasons behind the Second Amendment as follows: \u201cThis may be considered as the true palladium of liberty. . . . The right of self defence is the first law of nature....\u201d \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 2, 2019\n\n7/x \u201c...in most govts it has been the study of rulers to confine this right w/in the narrowest limits possible. Wherever...the right...to keep & bear arms is, under any...pretext whatsoever, prohibited, liberty, if not already annihilated, is on the brink of destruction.\u201d \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 2, 2019\n\n8/x That\u2019s also why, post Civil War, disarming Black Americans was a critical objective of the KKK, and was memorialized in countless Jim Crow laws\u2014to strip African-Americans of their God-given right to self-defense from violence. \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 2, 2019\n\n9/x I\u2019m a Texan. What happened in Midland-Odessa\u2014and El Paso, Santa Fe & Sutherland Springs\u2014was sick, deranged & horrifying. We need to do MUCH more to stop violent criminals & those w/ dangerous mental illness BEFORE they murder & I\u2019m leading the fight in the Senate to do so. \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 2, 2019\n\n10/x Playing politics w/ these deranged crimes\u2014and trying to use them as an excuse to violate the constl rights of law-abiding citizens\u2014won\u2019t make anybody safer. Forcible gun confiscation (as some 2020 Dems urge) won\u2019t prevent mass-murders. But it would weaken our self-defense. \u2014 Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) September 2, 2019\n\nMilano responded to Cruz's explanation on Monday, saying she'd like to meet with him in person and livestream the conversation \"so the American people can hear your bullsh*t.\"\n\nShe also pointed him to 1 Peter 4:8, which says: \"Above all, love each other deeply, because love covers over a multitude of sins.\"", "description": ".09/02/2019 20:02:21PM EST.", "authors": ["Leah Barkoukis", "Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/288/dea60538-9520-4f07-95e4-86dd5077059c.jpg"}
