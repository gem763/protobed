Instead, just take a drive with Este Haim, and experience the history of La La Land as told through the eyes of her and her sisters\u2019 teenage misadventure.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where Eagles recorded Hotel California,\u201d says Este, pointing at an impressive home from the front seat of an SUV while her two sisters, Alana and Danielle, sit in the back. \u201cThat\u2019s where Alana had her first car crash,\u201d the eldest and often the loudest of the trio continues, shifting into the authoritative tone of a celebrity TV travelogue as we career over Laurel Canyon. \u201cAnd this is Jenny Lewis\u2019s house; we snuck into her fourth-of-July pool party wearing Budweiser swimsuits. This was Houdini\u2019s house, then it was Frank Zappa\u2019s house, then it was the house I broke into with all my girlfriends and we held a seance. The police came and we all had to run away; we were like gazelles \u2013 they never caught us.\u201d\n\nBefore they started writing songs, Haim were obsessed with LA rock folklore, reading books about Joni Mitchell and Crosby, Stills and Nash, and forensically studying episodes of VH1\u2019s Behind the Music. When people started taking interest in their own band \u2013 before topping 2013\u2019s BBC Sound Of... poll, they would often play covers with their parents, under the name Rockinhaim \u2013 they felt prepared after an adolescence imbued in the history of California music.\n\nNow, after two albums and the greatest honour of all \u2013 a Saturday Night Live sketch parodying them, starring Tina Fey and Nicki Minaj \u2013 they have become one of the most quintessential LA bands of their generation. Recently, they have formed a creative partnership with Paul Thomas Anderson who, like Haim, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, an area of LA often sniffed at by trendier residents on the other side of the Hollywood hills. He directed their last four music videos, including new single Summer Girl, which sees the sisters removing layers of outerwear at various Valley locations.\n\n\u201cThe Valley is still not cool but it\u2019s such a big part of who we are, we ride or die for it,\u201d says Este as we pull up round the corner from their family home. \u201cGrowing up, we were surrounded by these virtuoso musicians; not the actual stars who lived in Beverly Hills or wherever you get the actual stars, but like the back-up guitarist for Pink Floyd or a session player for Pat Benatar; it was unpretentious, and these people would show up at our house and want to jam.\u201d\n\nThat early musical proficiency and confidence around older wizened rockers quickly defined Haim as artists. Emerging at a time when musicians tend to be introverted, electronic and serious (and guitar music has been declared dead so many times the coroner is hoarse) they have bucked every trend: a band of brash, accomplished female musicians playing classic rock while gaining a reputation as professional goofs, whether that\u2019s with their choreographed dance-routine tour announcements or photobombing Liam Payne at the Brit awards.\n\nOur first stop is Art\u2019s Deli and we spend 20 minutes perusing a thesis-length menu of latkes, lox and liver in various combinations. I make a few false attempts at starting the interview for real but a perfectly harmonised rendition of Tenacious D\u2019s 2001 album track Explosivo and a discussion about which S Club 7 song they could cover in the Live Lounge get in the way. Once we get into it, it becomes the clear that their sunny disposition has disguised a difficult period for the band. Having toured and recorded almost non-stop for six years \u2013 during which time their long-time producer (and Danielle\u2019s boyfriend) Ariel Rechtshaid had been diagnosed with testicular cancer, Alana\u2019s closest friend had passed away and Este continued to struggle with type 1 diabetes, a condition which she had been managing since childhood that caused her to almost faint during the band\u2019s Glastonbury performance in 2013.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s times when I look back at that time and I really was running away from my problems \u2013 because I could,\u201d says Alana.\n\nDanielle, generally the most contemplative of the sisters, was hit particularly hard: \u201cI definitely had a bout of post-tour depression when Ariel got sick; it all kind of just like hit, it hit me really hard.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Alana Haim. Photograph: Xavi Torrent/WireImage\n\nThat darkness can be heard in the band\u2019s new material, which marks something of a musical departure, particularly on two emotionally brutal songs, Hallelujah, a reflection on loss and recovery, and Now I\u2019m in It, a breathy pop ballad in which Danielle sings she feels \u201calone in my head\u201d.\n\n\u201cPeople think Now I\u2019m in It is a break-up song because I sing: \u2018We can\u2019t be friends\u2019 but I\u2019m talking about me and my mind. It was gnarly and I was not OK with myself,\u201d says Danielle.\n\n\u201cThere were times when collectively all of us were kind of spiralling,\u201d says Este. \u201cI was wanting to support my sister but also supporting her boyfriend; he wanted to get back to work and that was good but I felt guilty that we were sort of making him do the record ... I felt like I had to be strong all the time but most people with type 1 diabetes have depression. You start to get resentful of the disease. But to have my sisters take care of me, and remind me that I wanna dance at my great-granddaughter\u2019s wedding, Hallelujah is a reflection of how lucky we are to have each other.\u201d\n\nHaim have always worn their musical inspirations on their sleeve, but got mixed reviews for their second album, including the accusation that their nods to tasteful 80s and 90s influences sometimes overwhelmed their own voice. These new songs feel more quintessentially Haim; stripped back and direct, as if they\u2019ve been brewing for decades. \u201cAfter we\u2019d finished some of these songs we were like: \u2018Holy shit this is some of the best songs we\u2019ve ever done,\u2019\u201d says Danielle.\n\nAfter plates of smoked fish are licked clean and excess latke apple sauce is taken to go, we head to Canter\u2019s, a 1950s deli in Fairfax with a tiny club, the Kibbutz Room, in the back, where Haim played one of their first ever gigs. Haim are more than Jewish: they fast on Yom Kippur even if they have a gig and Summer Girl contains an interpolation of lyrics from Lo Yisa Goy, a song sung at Jewish summer camps. As more rounds of pastrami and pickles arrive, I wonder if there is ever a time they feel self-conscious about their heritage.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Este Haim. Photograph: Icon Sportswire/Getty Images\n\n\u201cThe one thing about being in LA: going to a Jewish deli is so normal for us. When we\u2019re touring around America, there\u2019s not just a place that Jews are just chilling,\u201d says Danielle. \u201cIt is interesting to us to go to places in middle America where being Jewish is more like being an outsider. We are in a bubble and I think we take that for granted.\u201d\n\nAs more rounds of pastrami and pickles arrive, there is a more determined tone in the air and the sisters repeat a refrain of not taking any bullshit this time around, particularly from a male-dominated music industry.\n\n\u201cI mean,\u201d Danielle continues, \u201cthere was definitely a time when we wanted to be on the rock stations, and they were saying that we weren\u2019t rock enough, which felt like a big slap in the face, especially when they play so many bands that make the same shit as us but they\u2019re men and they play them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat rock bands don\u2019t understand about us, is that we make fun of ourselves; we love to have fun but sometimes that makes people think we don\u2019t take music seriously,\u201d says Alana as the sisters start to rile each other up.\n\n\u201cYeah! I can go toe-to-toe with any male rock band and blow them out of the water,\u201d shouts Este.\n\nThe band has had some ugly brushes with the established men of the music industry in the past, particularly from Portishead\u2019s Geoff Barrow who tweets regularly about how much he dislikes them: \u201cHaim are not woman! they are robots sent here from the CIA/Time Warner lab to fill a playlist gap where decent music could be\u201d and \u201cWhy the fuk are haim pretending their rise to fame was organic ? Unless massive marketing spends are now considered organic nowadays?\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Danielle Haim. Photograph: Xavi Torrent/WireImage\n\nAlana says that Barrow\u2019s tweets did actually push her to take action at one point. \u201cEvery fucking week he would say more and more shit. Then we were at this festival somewhere in Finland and Portishead were headlining, we were on just before. I wasn\u2019t going to say anything, but then he started tweeting about us while we were right there in the next dressing room, putting the guitar girl emoji next to the poop emoji, so I thought fuck this I\u2019ve got to say something. I was 21 years old at the time and I saw him, and I was so fucking angry and I literally just got into his face, I said: \u2018Stop fucking talking shit about me and my sisters on the internet.\u2019\n\nWhat happened? \u201cHe looked at me and said: \u2018Nermmmmmmmm waaaaaaa, blurgggggggh.\u2019 I was expecting him to go: \u2018You know what, I don\u2019t like your fucking music\u2019 and then we could have ended it, but all he could do, after months of saying how much he hated us as women and our music, was make a nondescript noise then slowly back away into his dressing room.\u201d\n\nWhen we get back in the car for one final drive, Este is feeling fired up after all the deli meats and righteous outbursts. \u201cYou know what: I am going to get us played on KROQ,\u201d she says \u2013 and dials the station\u2019s request line, which she knows off by heart. \u201cHi, it\u2019s Este, Este Haim, Este Haim. It\u2019s Este from Haim! I\u2019d like to hear my song on the radio,\u201d she gets put through to the studio and the DJ sounds suspicious, asking to prove its her. She gives them her sister\u2019s middle names and suddenly he is on board. A few minutes later Summer Girl starts to wisp through the speakers, and car speakers across the city.\n\nAlthough it is often Este who takes these gutsy leaps, it\u2019s obvious that the source of her confidence is the bond with her sisters. By their third record, most bands are sniping about royalties and planning their solo projects, but every hurdle Haim face seems to only make them closer. Whether it\u2019s clapping back at old rock bores, managing a period of misery or getting their songs on the radio: if Haim want something done, they will do it themselves.\n\nHaim\u2019s next single Now I\u2019m in It is out in late October", "description": "The LA trio have faced grief, sexism and members of Portishead - now they\u2019re back with a new darker sound", "authors": ["Sam Wolfson"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f30e8bcc205312f40c96aa03e9c4c3d9ba7dae10/0_163_3637_2183/master/3637.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=951629181111341bdaff549ad73019fa", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
