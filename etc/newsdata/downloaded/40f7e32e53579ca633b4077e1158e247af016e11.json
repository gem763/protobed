They believed it would prevent Mr Johnson from pushing his Brexit plan through Parliament ahead of the poll.\n\nMr Corbyn confirmed Labour would back an election on 9 December, although some of his colleagues expressed misgivings over the timing of the election - believing only another referendum can settle the Brexit question for good.\n\nHowever, Labour's amendment to change the date of the proposed election from 12 to 9 December was rejected and MPs voted to back the government's original bill by 438 votes to 20.\n\nMore than 100 Labour MPs did not take part or abstained in Tuesday's crucial vote, while 11 voted against an election. A total of 127 Labour MPs, including Mr Corbyn, supported the election.\n\nThe bill, approved by MPs, paves the way for the first December election since 1923.\n\nWhat's the reaction from other parties?\n\nThe Lib Dems and the SNP both see the election as a chance to ask voters whether Brexit should happen at all.\n\nThe pro-EU leader of the Lib Dems, Jo Swinson, has pitched herself as \"the Liberal Democrat candidate for prime minister\".\n\n\"It is our best chance to elect a government to stop Brexit,\" she said.\n\nFor the SNP, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said an election was an opportunity for Scotland to hold another independence referendum.\n\n\"A win for the SNP will be an unequivocal and irresistible demand for Scotland's right to choose our own future,\" she said.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives claimed voting for their party would keep Scotland in the UK.\n\nBrexit Party leader Nigel Farage welcomed the election, tweeting that the deadlock had been broken and \"Brexit now has a chance to succeed\".", "description": "The PM urges Tories to \"come together\" as rival Jeremy Corbyn says the poll is a \"once-in-generation\" opportunity.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07sg3zw.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
