We know they have less down time, less time to be bored and less time to play than we did as kids. But what we may not have realised is that all the pressure on students \u2014 particularly those in \u201chigh-achieving\u201d schools \u2014 is causing higher rates of anxiety, depression, substance abuse and delinquent behaviours.\n\nAs reported in the Washington Post:\n\nA consensus study report on advancing health equity among... children published this summer by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine added youths in \u201chigh achieving schools\u201d to their list of \u201cat-risk\u201d groups, along with kids living in poverty and foster care, recent immigrants and those with incarcerated parents. Last year, a report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation came to a similar conclusion when it named the top environmental conditions harming adolescent wellness \u2014 among them were poverty, trauma, discrimination and \u201cexcessive pressure to excel,\u201d often, but not exclusively, occurring in affluent communities.\n\nMiddle school and high school have always been tough, but the pressure students are under now is unprecedented. It\u2019s not enough to struggle through calculus anymore \u2014 they\u2019ve got to land a spot in Extension 2 Maths. It\u2019s not enough to play basketball \u2014 they have to be great at it. It\u2019s not enough to play the violin \u2014 they\u2019ve got to get into a prestigious music program. In these high-achieving communities, every aspect of their lives can become a pressure cooker.\n\nIt may be true that this \u201cexcessive pressure to excel\u201d often happens in affluent communities, but the pressure is getting to students everywhere. And even if that pressure isn\u2019t coming from home, it\u2019s still seeping in \u2014 from coaches, from teachers and from their peers.\n\nWhich is why it\u2019s up to parents to help kids maintain a sense of balance by stressing values and character over achievement, and by having ongoing discussions about how they should best spend their time and energy.\n\nCombat pressure with a \u2018family contract\u2019\n\nOne way to do this, researcher Denise Pope, co-founder of Challenge Success, tells the Post, is to create a \u201cfamily contract\u201d to help kids maintain that balance:\n\nWhen Pope\u2019s kids were in middle school, she would create a family contract each year that made clear the values in their household, like mandatory family dinners. Playtime, down time and family time all buffer against stress and pressure, and parents must protect that time, even when it goes against popular norms.\n\nYou can start this by sitting down with your child and agreeing to some basic ground rules. That might look like this:\n\nYou\u2019ll eat dinner together as a family at least four nights a week (even if that means it has to be a little earlier or a little later than usual).\n\nThey can only have regularly scheduled meetings, practices or activities three nights a week on school nights; the other two school nights are \u201cdecompression nights.\u201d\n\nYou have a standing family \u201cdate\u201d on the weekends. That could be a movie night on Sundays or a regular Saturday morning breakfast date at your favourite diner. Set aside one block of time during the weekend to do something together that you all enjoy.\n\nYou and your kids can agree that there can be some compromise and flexibility to this, but that for the most part, these are the rules you\u2019ll live by. Everyone signs the contract, and then you can revisit it together annually at the start of each school year.\n\nEmphasising the need for balance and down time and setting these limits at home will send a message to your child that achievement is not what you prize the most.", "description": "We know that kids are over-scheduled and over-worked.
