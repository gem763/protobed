The personal-goods retailer has found success by playing to the power of nostalgia while staying relevant with updated stores and new product tests.\n\nWe visited one of three Bath & Body Works locations in Manhattan to see what it\u2019s doing right.\n\nAs L Brands struggles to revitalize its ailing Victoria\u2019s Secret brand, Bath & Body Works proves it has enduring appeal.\n\nBest known for its bountiful selection of personal care and bath products, Bath & Body Works has established itself as a bright spot for its parent company. The brand posted a 13% increase in same-store sales in the first quarter of 2019, while sales at Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s stores declined by 5%. Thanks in part to the success of Bath & Body Works, L Brands reported a net income of $US40.3 million for the quarter, more than three times the value estimated by analysts.\n\nInvestors have started pressuring L Brands to split Bath & Body Works from the struggling lingerie company. In March, hedge fund Barington Capital sent a lengthy letter to L Brands CEO Les Wexner arguing its point for a spinoff, taking a page from the playbook of Gap Inc.\u2019s recent decision to make Old Navy a standalone company.\n\nIn the meantime, L Brands made pointed efforts to offset its losses by selling La Senza and closing its high-fashion brand, Henri Bendel. Still, the company\u2019s \u201cperformance continues to be mixed,\u201d L Brands CFO Stuart Burgdoerfer said on the investor call in May.\n\nWe visited a Bath & Body Works store in Manhattan\u2019s Flatiron District to see what\u2019s helping set the retailer apart:\n\nThe Flatiron Bath & Body Works is one of three locations in Manhattan, and it was bustling with shoppers at 11 a.m. on a Monday. Bath & Body Works is one of the largest personal care and home goods retailers in the world, with more than 1,600 stores.\n\nBethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nSource: USA Today\n\nThough the first store opened in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Bath & Body Works was founded and is headquartered in New Albany, Ohio. We found a small display honouring its hometown.\n\nBethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nSince its conception in 1990, the retailer has worked to maintain a wholesome image, effectively becoming \u201cAmerica\u2019s sweetheart of beauty brands.\u201d Its marketing and store design are very intentional, with smatterings of gingham, wooden barrels, and other nods to \u201ccountry living.\u201d\n\nSource: Racked\n\nBath & Body Works has developed a rabid following over the past three decades. Today there are fan blogs and YouTube accounts dedicated to sharing new products.\n\nYouTube/Tina Marie User Tina Marie shows off her latest haul in a video posted last month.\n\nSource: YouTube\n\nEven celebrities like Rumer Willis can\u2019t get enough of Bath & Body Works. The actress was spotted browsing candles at a store in Los Angeles in 2010.\n\nBath & Body Works has worked to establish loyalty with its core consumer base of millennial women thanks to a product assortment that blends nostalgic items with updated seasonal offerings.\n\nBethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nThe store we visited also had plenty of fun, whimsical items perfectly fit for a children\u2019s gift.\n\nBethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nAt the same time, Bath & Body Works has expanded its inventory to attract new demographics, including men. At the Flatiron store, we found a collection of men\u2019s bath and shaving products strategically marketed for Father\u2019s Day.\n\nBethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nIn recent years, Bath & Body Works has found particular success with its White Barn Shop concept, which focuses on candles and air fresheners.\n\nBethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nThe company continues to invest heavily in White Barn and often runs popular promotions like \u201c3-for-1\u201d deals on candles. Executives said on an earnings call earlier this month that they have 200 White Barn projects planned for the rest of 2019.\n\nSource: USA Today\n\nThe White Barn collection really goes all-in on seasonal products, including new scents like \u201cIsland Reef\u201d and \u201cSuntan.\u201d\n\nBethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nIn addition to classic scents like vanilla, Bath & Body Works sells a vast collection of quirky, off-the-beaten-path candle fragrances. Here are a few of the more obscure ones we found at the Manhattan store.\n\nBethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nLooking for something a bit cosmopolitan? Spring for some eau de San Francisco.\n\nBethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nStill unclear what it\u2019s supposed to smell like.\n\nCan\u2019t say we\u2019ve ever had a berry waffle cone, but we wouldn\u2019t mind eating one after smelling this.\n\nBethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nThey even have special occasion candles for all your sentimental needs.\n\nBethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nPart of Bath & Body Work\u2019s continued success is its investment in store design and remodeling, which has brought a breath of fresh air to the brand.\n\nBethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nThe Manhattan store was brightly coloured and well-lit, with flowers lining the displays.\n\nElements of the store felt like being in a time capsule, like the sink where shoppers could test products \u2014 an integral part of the brand\u2019s early \u201990s stores.\n\nBethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nChildren of the \u201990s will also be delighted to find the occasional classic scent, like this Cucumber Melon hand sanitizer \u2026\n\nBethany Biron/Business Insider\n\n\u2026 and this Sweet Pea lotion.\n\nBethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nHowever, as we all know, some products were simply just too good to last, like the Bath & Body Works Art Stuff line.\n\nPoshmark\n\nThe collection, which was popular in the late \u201990s and early aughts before it was discontinued, has inspired many an ode. You can also occasionally find the original products on resale sites, though they go quickly.\n\nMeanwhile, over on eBay you can snag some OG Art Stuff for a cool $US27.30.\n\neBay\n\nStill, Bath & Body Works isn\u2019t afraid to test new scents. Its latest Gingham line has been a surprise hit, which executives have credited to its \u201csophisticated\u201d appeal.\n\nBethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nSource: MarketWatch\n\nUltimately, Bath & Body Works has become the rare retailer that consistently draws a stream of loyal customers to its brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nBethany Biron/Business Insider\n\nBusiness Insider Emails & Alerts Site highlights each day to your inbox.
