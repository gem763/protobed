The current generation of AirPods start at $159.\n\nIt\u2019s making some Wall Street analysts even more bullish on Apple\u2019s year-end performance.\n\n\u201cI do think the product will be a great stocking stuffer,\u201d Citi research analyst Jim Suva told Yahoo Finance\u2019s YFi PM. \u201cFor the average consumer, they\u2019re great and they\u2019re good enhancements.\u201d\n\n\u2018Beyond the iPhone\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\nApple's new \"premium\" AirBuds Pro will feature noise-cancelling technology, retailing for $249 when they go on sale October 30. More\n\nThe success of AirPods since they first hit the market in 2016 gives Suva reason for optimism about the Pro\u2019s prospects.\n\n\u201cPeople use them a lot,\u201d Suva said. \u201cWhether they\u2019re driving in their car, walking down the street, or doing conference calls as they\u2019re running around with their family or children or friends.\u201d\n\nAccording to the analyst, the premium earbuds are another important example of Apple\u2019s push to better expand what it\u2019s offering to consumers beyond the iPhone.\n\n\u201cThey fall into the the category of Apple doing things beyond the iPhone. Now you have these AirPods and also other services such as Apple Arcade, and Apple TV+,\u201d Suva stated, referencing its new original streaming service that debuts this week.\n\n\u201cInvestors have gone from under-owning, or having a lot of concerns about Apple, to actually liking it,\u201d he added.\n\nIn Suva\u2019s view, positive developments between the U.S. and China over trade will also likely give a boost to Apple in the months ahead.\n\n\u201cA lot of these fears have started to be mitigated and become less worrisome,\u201d according to Suva. \u201cWe think it\u2019s going to be a good, healthy Christmas holiday season for Apple.\u201d\n\nNick Robertson is a senior producer at Yahoo Finance.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Citi's Jim Suva explains why he believes Apple's new AirBuds Pro will help boost the tech giant's performance in the holiday shopping season.", "authors": ["Nick Robertson", "Senior Producer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/a9XCcIJbvuQxO9jj.BvJqA--~B/aD0xNjMyO3c9MTYzMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/23bec0f0-f9c8-11e9-bbfe-b92374cb39c9", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
