An independent nonprofit Libra Association will manage the system, while Facebook will operate a \"wallet\" business called Calibra.\n\nZuckerberg pledged that Facebook would not launch Calibra anywhere in the world until it passed muster with U.S. regulators.\n\nIf the Libra Association tried to move forward with Libra before it got the OK from U.S. authorities, he said Facebook would drop the project.\n\nWhat they said about Libra:\n\nZuckerberg indicated Libra would bring disadvantaged people into the financial system and help keep the U.S. in the forefront of the finance industry by updating its \"crufty\" system.\n\nRepublicans wanted to know why the Libra Association was based in Switzerland, rather than the U.S., worried a successful Libra could undercut the dollar's role as the world's reserve currency. They also asked how Libra could help the U.S. avoid falling behind China as cryptocurrencies and blockchain tech evolve.\n\nDemocrats charged that Zuckerberg's aim of helping the \"unbanked\" was a disingenuous cover for a power play \u2014 a way for \"the richest man in the world to come here and hide before the poorest people in the world,\" as Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Calif.) put it. They also argued that Facebook's lack of diversity, its record of allowing housing-ad discrimination, and its record violating user privacy left it without the public trust needed by the builder of a financial system.\n\nFacebook won't provide anonymity through Calibra, but the wider Libra platform won't ban anonymity. Several lawmakers asked whether that would be a boon to terrorists, drug dealers and other criminals?\n\nThe answer: Zuckerberg pledged that Facebook would stay clean, but hedged on the wider issue.\n\nOf the 21 institutions that are part of the Libra Association, how many are headed by women, minority-group members, LGBTQ people?\n\nThe answer: Zuckerberg didn't know.\n\nWhat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) asked about lying in political ads:\n\nOcasio-Cortez: \"Could I target ads against Republicans in primaries saying that they voted for the Green New Deal?\"\n\nZuckerberg: \"I don't know the answer to that off the top of my head. I think, probably.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez: \"Do you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of fact-checking on political advertisements?\"\n\nZuckerberg: \"I think lying is bad, and if you ran an ad with a lie, that would be bad.\" He added that in a democracy, Facebook should allow the public to judge for itself what politicians say.\n\nWhat they asked about everything else:", "description": "Facebook's CEO faced questions from both parties about his cryptocurrency project \u2014 and much more.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/SDqfB0Ku-WZ7fGnbEJ_BuNCOL7U=/0x248:6720x4028/1920x1080/2019/10/23/1571871029482.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
