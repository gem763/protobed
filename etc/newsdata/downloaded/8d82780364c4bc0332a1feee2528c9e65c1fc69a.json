The ruling would later be applied to halt impeachment proceedings against two former justices: Allen Loughry, who resigned after a federal conviction on felony fraud charges, and Robin Davis, who retired after the state House impeached her.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cFor my whole 30 years serving in the judicial branch, I have always tried to serve with integrity and honesty and fairness,\u201d Workman told The Associated Press, saying she was \u201cgratified\u201d by the decision. \u201cI have never had a negative mark on my ethical record and I\u2019m glad to say that I still don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nState lawmakers brought impeachment charges against the three justices in 2018, alleging corruption.\n\nWorkman argued that misconduct allegations against justices were exclusively the purview of the West Virginia Supreme Court itself, which the state\u2019s five acting justices agreed with. Workman is still on the court but no longer chief justice, according to the AP.\n\nState Senate President Mitch Carmichael (R) told the AP he was \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d by the high court\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cWe always knew it was a long shot due to the Supreme Court taking up so few cases per year. Though we will not get our day before the nation\u2019s highest court, we will continue to look for ways to right the wrong we believe the appointed state Supreme Court committed during the impeachment process,\u201d Carmichael said.", "description": "The Supreme Court announced Monday it will not intervene over a West Virginia Supreme Court ruling blocking the impeachment trials of three justices on the state\u2019s hi", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/scotus_supremecourt_012219gn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
