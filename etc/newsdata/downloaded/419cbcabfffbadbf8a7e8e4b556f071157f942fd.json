What this race really needs is a fabulously wealthy, straight, white, cisgender male who\u2019s old enough to collect Social Security benefits to toss his hat in the ring. (Oh, wait\u2026 we\u2019ve already got at least three of those.) Anyway, if the club is still accepting new members, there may be one on the way. Politico is reporting today that Ed Stack, the CEO of Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods, is running focus groups in Wisconsin to measure possible interest in him as a third-party candidate next year.\n\nEd Stack, the CEO of Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods and a longtime Republican donor, is testing the waters for a possible third-party presidential bid that could scramble the dynamics of the 2020 general election. Various messages were presented to a focus group in southern Wisconsin this week centering on the billionaire businessman, along with possible three-way match-ups against Donald Trump and Joe Biden or Elizabeth Warren. The focus group, according to a source who took part in the testing, ran through varying themes involving Stack and heavily focused on his example of \u201cshowing leadership\u201d by halting the sale of assault-style rifles at all of Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods stores in the wake of the high school massacre in Parkland, Florida.\n\nHey, if Ed Stack wants to throw his money away on a doomed campaign, that\u2019s up to him. It\u2019s a free country, after all\u2026 at least for the time being.\n\nBut if he really does take the plunge, the obvious question is whether he hurts one major party candidate more than the other. Being a Republican donor for many years, you might be tempted to think that he would be a big draw for the Never Trump vote and others who might be disillusioned with the President\u2019s performance. But ever since Stack led the charge to stop selling \u201cassault weapons\u201d in his stores he\u2019s become something of a hero on the left. He would also be viewed as a far more moderate choice, so if the Democrats wind up nominating one of the crackpot socialists like Sanders or Warren, he might start cutting into their support.\n\nWould it make any difference? It remains tough to imagine any third party challenger taking even a single electoral college vote. But at the same time, there\u2019s still a valid argument to be made that Ralph Nader actually elected George W. Bush in 2000 by siphoning off votes from Al Gore in Florida.\n\nMy gut instinct here tells me that Stack is serious about thinking about running, but when all of the polling is done and he sees what his prospects are he\u2019ll pull the plug on this idea. He\u2019s presumably a smart businessman and should quickly become aware of the daunting challenges such a plan would present. He\u2019d have to purchase himself a full roster of experienced campaign staff with national experience (assuming there are any for hire right now), plus set up organizations in all fifty states just to get on the ballot. And the clock is already ticking in terms of getting all that work done. It\u2019s not impossible, but it would require virtually flawless execution to pull it off. Stack\u2019s history doesn\u2019t suggest that he became a billionaire by being the type to pour money down ratholes.", "description": "Seriously?", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/DicksSporting.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
