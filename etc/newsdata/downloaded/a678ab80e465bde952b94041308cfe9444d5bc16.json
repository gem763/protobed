Their goal is to avert the worst of the devastation that scientists project if business as usual continues.\n\nCritics say the group is proposing what amounts to the overthrow of capitalism without any clear idea of what would replace it, and that the world's energy needs cannot be met without fossil fuels - which are directly causing climate change.\n\nExtinction Rebellion said that 1,336 people had been arrested in London since it launched its actions a week ago. A further 1,463 people have been arrested in 20 cities in countries including the Netherlands, Belgium, the US, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.\n\n'This is criminal damage'\n\nWhile activists have long targeted fossil fuel companies, a growing movement is increasingly scrutinising the role that fund managers, banks and insurance companies are playing to enable oil and gas extraction.\n\nEmily Grossman, a British science broadcaster and expert in molecular biology who joined the protest outside BlackRock, said that financing for fossil fuel projects undermined the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement to limit global warming.\n\n\"This is criminal damage that they are doing to our lives and to the lives of our children,\" said Grossman. \"And it has to stop.\"\n\nMajor oil companies have approved $50bn in projects since last year that run contrary to the goals of the Paris Agreement, according to an analysis published last month by financial think-tank Carbon Tracker.\n\nFossil fuel companies say they need to invest in new projects to meet future demand for energy, particularly in fast-growing regions such as Asia.\n\nClimate protesters want to pressure index fund firms such as BlackRock because the sector - which now controls half the United States stock mutual fund market - has enormous power to influence companies in which they invest trillions of dollars.\n\nBut the leading US index fund firms - BlackRock, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp - rarely use that clout, a Reuters News Agency analysis of their shareholder voting records found earlier this month.", "description": "With more than 2,500 people arrested globally in the past week, Extinction Rebellion is now targeting the asset manager.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/14/c6a49e20ba464d49a1218055a90cc952_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
