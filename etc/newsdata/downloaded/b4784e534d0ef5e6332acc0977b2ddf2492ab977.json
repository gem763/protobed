It is a problem and there is no real answer to it.\n\n\u201cMy bet is, with the current political groups, Iraq cannot pull itself out of this mire.\u201d\n\nKubba was speaking in London at an event at the Chatham House thinktank on the future of Iraq, arranged well before the violent protests that have swept Iraq in recent days leaving as many as 19 dead.\n\nInternet blackout in Iraq as death toll from violent protests rises Read more\n\n\u201cCorruption is so institutionalised in Iraq that it takes more than cosmetic changes like creating committees,\u201d Kubba said. \u201cIt requires a head-on confrontation, it will come with a high political cost. Whether or not the prime minister is prepared to pay that high cost, I don\u2019t know. It will not go away just by wishing it away. It requires a crackdown.\u201d\n\nHe said the prime minister had partly come to power to avoid a violent confrontation after the 2018 elections: \u201cThe situation is not normal. Iraq has 10 blocs who have real power via armed groups, they have banks, TV stations, MPs and the corruption merges with those blocs. We have a real problem.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe biggest challenge facing Iraq is whether it has a state, a strong state, a state based on citizenship or it has a state within a state, or multiple states \u2026 The biggest sin was to dismantle the Iraqi state in 2003 and since then Iraq has been struggling in a tough region.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A demonstrator burns tyres during a curfew in Baghdad on Thursday.

They are raised with no memory of Saddam Hussein or the political issues. They are not getting the services in schools, the hospitals, or in the streets, and they are impatient.\u201d\n\nAt the same event, Andrew Peek, the US deputy assistant secretary of state, said Iraq\u2019s recent progress was being undermined by the fact that Iran had more control over 30,000-40,000 armed men in the country than the Baghdad government. If Iraq chose to become an abnormal country, he warned, it would be shutting itself off from foreign direct investment and western financial institutions. \u201cThe Iranian state model will not give any help to the Iraqis on the streets today,\u201d he said. \u201cThe 1 million young Iraqis that come on the jobs market every year want something more than traditional politics.\u201d\n\nDhia al-Asadi, the chairman of the Sadrist al-Ahrar bloc, the largest in parliament, also pointed to corruption, but rejected the idea of his bloc leaving the government to side with the protesters in the streets.\n\nAsadi said the protests went far wider than one political faction, including his own, but had not yet crystallised into a single coherent movement.\n\n\u201cThere are certain obvious indicators about whether the government is serious about correcting itself,\u201d Asadi said.\n\nHe said the first would be signs that senior politicians accused of corruption were held accountable in court: \u201cNothing has happened, unfortunately, and no one is held accountable.\u201d", "description": "Iraq PM\u2019s adviser claims violent protests can only be addressed by tackling corruption head-on", "authors": ["Patrick Wintour"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f29d5227f9f995d7597b18dd63b5e75ab43b5d4/101_265_4067_2440/master/4067.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a25800ff21ac7692684617664ccb60b2", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
