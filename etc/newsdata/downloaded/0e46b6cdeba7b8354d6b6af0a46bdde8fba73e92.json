Despite having some of the highest wages in the nation, the state has an escalating homeless problem and the highest poverty rate \u2014 with about one in five households living below the federal poverty line \u2014 once the cost of housing is figured in. Three-hour commutes are expanding and there are stories of police officers sleeping in their cars. Homelessness has made the sight of sidewalk tents commonplace and led to vast and multiplying camps in abandoned lots and under freeways.\n\n[Read more about the rise of homelessness in California, and the backlash.]\n\nStill, the thing that California needs to do most \u2014 build lots of housing, in particular, affordable housing accessible to middle- and lower-income households in the service economy \u2014 has proved the most difficult. A bill to vastly expand housing production stalled in the State Senate this year over the protests of suburban communities that argued that a vast new building plan would lead to more traffic and ruin their quality of life. At the same time, construction prices have risen so high that building even no-frills subsidized units routinely costs $500,000, and often more in big cities.\n\nThose kinds of numbers can make a mockery of any effort to solve the problem with money. Public officials and economists are blunt that Facebook\u2019s package will take a decade or longer to have any material impact on a housing crunch that has been a generation in the making and heavily exacerbated by the local technology boom. In the latest annual counts of the homeless population, Los Angeles and several Bay Area cities saw their homeless populations increase significantly; Oakland\u2019s grew close to 50 percent in just two years.\n\nExactly how much tech companies are responsible, and how much money they could or should put toward housing, is a matter of continuous debate. Last year, a contentious ballot initiative to fund homeless services in San Francisco split the local tech community. Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, became the measure\u2019s biggest backer, leading to a public feud with Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter and the payments company Square, who was against it.\n\nIt is an oft-repeated talking point, in both San Francisco proper and the smaller cities like Palo Alto and Menlo Park that make up Silicon Valley, that tech companies should help build housing for their swelling ranks of employees. The governor, Gavin Newsom, has called on technology companies to contribute more and asked big corporations to use their substantial cash hoards to aid state housing efforts through instruments like low-interest loans.", "description": "The move, which combines money and land, is the latest effort by technology companies to ease the state\u2019s severe housing shortage.", "authors": ["Conor Dougherty"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/22/business/22facebook/merlin_161084820_5a3218ef-f716-4690-805f-adbcc7018de2-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
