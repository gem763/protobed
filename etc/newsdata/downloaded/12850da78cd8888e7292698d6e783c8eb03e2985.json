Here's all you wanted to know", "language": "en", "text": "Has the thought of making out with someone of your own gender aroused you? Have you enjoyed lesbian porn? Have you made out with a woman and enjoyed it? If the answers to the questions above are in the affirmative, chances are, you identify as a bisexual. However, human sexuality is far more complex and fluid and cannot be slotted in narrow boxes. Thus, even though the above signs may point you in a certain direction, it\u2019s uncertain that you are bisexual. Here, we spell out details about the orientation, the lack of knowledge surrounding it, and the challenges bisexual people face.Simply put, bisexuals are individuals who are attracted to both men and women. According to Dr Shanu Shrivastav, consultant psychologist, Indian Spinal Injuries Centre (New Delhi), \u201cBeing bisexual does not necessarily mean that you will be equally interested in both the sexes; it merely involves a \u2018capacity\u2019 to do so. While some bisexual people may be equally drawn to both men and women, it\u2019s not a defining feature of bisexuality.\u201dDelhi-based marketing and communications specialist Dipalie Mehta went through a gamut of sexual feelings, growing up, before she could identify herself as bisexual in adulthood. Having had relationships with both men and women, she is in a same-sex relationship for the last two years. \u201cIn Indian families, conversations around sexuality/sex/menstruation don\u2019t happen. My first understanding of my own sexual leanings came from my reactions to characters in books and people I met in real life. I felt attracted to men, women, transsexuals\u2014almost everyone who seemed interesting. More so, I grew up thinking that it is the norm, and one marries the opposite gender for making babies. I discovered homophobia in my late teens, and it was shocking,\u201d she says.As a sexual orientation, bisexuality is little understood, and many myths and prejudices surround it. However, it is increasingly becoming more common. According to the National Survey of Family Growth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US, conducted between 2011 and 2013, that asked over 9000 people about their sexual experiences, higher numbers of both women and men identified as bisexual\u20145.5 per cent of women and 2 per cent of men\u2014 compared to 3.9 per cent and 1.2 per cent respectively in the 2006-2010 survey.Dr Justin J Lehmiller, a research fellow at The Kinsey Institute, USA, and author of the book Tell Me What You Want: The Science of Sexual Desire and How It Can Help You Improve Your Sex Life, writes a regular blog on sex and psychology. In one of his posts, titled 5 Scientific Facts About Bisexuality, he says, \u201cA lot of people deny the existence of bisexuality and assume that everyone who identifies as bisexual is secretly gay\u2026\u201d He explains that the results of several studies, however, reveal that bisexuality involves a distinct pattern of sexual interest and arousal compared to homosexuality. As some support for this idea, he talks of a study in which participants viewed photos of men and women while researchers surreptitiously recorded how long they spent looking at each one. \u201cThe results revealed that bisexual persons spent similar amounts of time looking at photos of both sexes, whereas gays and lesbians spent far longer looking at photos of their desired sex.\u201dEven in India, in the current times, there is a significant number of bisexuals on the internet dating scene looking for partners. According to Ishaan Sethi, founder and CEO of the LGBTQ-friendly dating app Delta Connect, \u201cOf all our users, the total percentage of bisexuals is 29; of which male bisexuals form 22 per cent and female bisexuals form 7 per cent of the total.Interestingly, worldwide, more women than men identify as bisexuals. In the CDC survey, 17.4 per cent women were reported to have had sexual contact with the same sex as opposed to 14.2 per cent in the 2006-2010 survey. This mirrors other surveys like the one conducted by Gerulf Rieger, a professor from the University of Essex, and published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology that found that while gay women are only sexually attracted to women, many straight women are aroused by both sexes. The researcher explained, \u201cEven though the majority of women identify as straight, our research clearly demonstrates that when it comes to what turns them on, they are either bisexual or gay, but never straight.\u201dFurthermore, a recent thread on a popular social media portal collated a few experiences of bisexual women. One of the accounts said, \u201cI was attracted to women when I was still a teenager, and repressed the feeling because I was evangelical. I was unsure if it meant that I was a lesbian. It was only when I went to college that I realised I didn\u2019t need to be one or the other; I could be both. That\u2019s when I got with a bi friend for the first time and better understood my possibilities. Despite that, it was always difficult to know whether I was really bisexual. I became surer when I noticed that even though I was in a serious relationship with a man, I still liked women.\u201dThe lack of knowledge surrounding bisexuality lends itself to difficulties aplenty. From insinuations that it is a \u201cphase\u201d to taunts and lewd suggestions for threesomes, bisexual women face a lot. \u201cPeople don\u2019t believe we exist, they think we are just experimenting, and will later settle in a heterosexual relationship. People also think all bisexuals are polyamorous, and will cheat on you. First of all, I want to clarify that polyamory and cheating are two different things. Secondly, all bisexuals are not polyamorous! Thirdly, straight or gay people can cheat just as much as your next bisexual person. A cheater has no specific orientation. People also approach us for threesomes. This fetish is annoying. I don\u2019t have issues with people who have threesomes, I\u2019ve issues with people who think a bisexual girl is a unicorn who will make your porn fantasies come true,\u201d says Mehta.Delhi-based relationships counsellor Dr Shivani Misri Sadhoo echoes Mehta\u2019s opinion and opines that cheating is not orientation specific. \u201cExplain to your partner gently that bisexuality does not mean that you have an inherent desire for both sexes every time, but rather a desire for a good and true partner who can be of either sex,\u201d she says.To make it worse, a bisexual faces a certain amount of antagonism and hostility within the LGBT community as well. \u201cWhen I first came out, a few people from the community said things like, \u201cYou need to pick a side.\u201d Even today, every now and then, there is a post on queer group where people say bisexuals should only date bisexuals, and that they aren\u2019t loyal. It is unsettling to see such thoughts within the queer community. My girlfriend is thankfully rational so I didn\u2019t have to convince her of my fidelity,\u201d says Mehta.Finally, bisexuality is not a phase, and people are not looking at experimenting. \u201cStudies suggest that bisexuality in women is a lifelong sexual orientation, and not a phase. The findings counter the idea that bisexuality is an experimental or fluctuating period for a woman who is unsure and or has fear of commitment. While more research is needed on this, bisexuality is an inherent trait,\u201d says Sadhoo.", "description": "Binary thinking often mars bisexual persons from getting acceptance.
