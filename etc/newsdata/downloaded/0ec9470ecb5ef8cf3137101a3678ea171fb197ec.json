Mandatory Credit: Matt Roberts-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAfter securing a tied-third finish at the Zozo Championship in Japan last week, McIlroy will return to action on Thursday at Sheshan International Golf Club, playing alongside American Xander Schauffele and England\u2019s Justin Rose for the opening two rounds.\n\nWith world number one Brooks Koepka out of action with a knee strain, McIlroy knows a fourth title triumph of the year on Sunday could help him lay down a marker for next year.\n\n\u201cI want to get as many world ranking points as I possibly can and try to close that gap on the number one,\u201d McIlroy, who has spent 95 weeks of his career ranked as the world\u2019s best, told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cI started this year maybe eighth or ninth in the world. If I play well the next few weeks, I\u2019ll have a great platform going into next year.\u201d\n\nMcIlroy won his second and latest WGC event in 2015 and since then has had nine top 10 finishes in the tournaments, including a tied-fourth position in Shanghai in 2016.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always enjoyed WGCs,\u201d the Northern Irishman added. \u201cI feel like the course suits my game and I like this tournament ever since I started coming here in 2009.\u201d\n\nThe WGC (World Golf Championships), four events held annually, are the highest-ranking tournaments in golf behind the four majors and the Players Championship, and they offer comparable prize money.\n\nRose, who won the Shanghai event - dubbed Asia\u2019s major - two years ago, is targeting another late surge in the European Tour\u2019s Race to Dubai standings.\n\nThe title proved to be a springboard in the final phase of the 2017 season before he was edged out in the final round in Dubai by Tommy Fleetwood in the race for the Harry Vardon Trophy, awarded to the winner of the Race to Dubai.\n\nRose, 29th in this season\u2019s European Tour money list, needs another run of strong results this season. This week\u2019s tournament is followed by three Rolex Series events.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a good little hunting ground for me the last couple of years and it\u2019s a golf course I really enjoy,\u201d he said of Shanghai.\n\n\u201cWith the way the points are weighted with the prize fund in Turkey and Dubai, it offers me the opportunity to make a run.\u201d\n\nThailand\u2019s Jazz Janewattananond will make his WGC debut and lead the Asian charge at the event, which will feature 35 of the top 50 players in the world rankings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always good each time you get a chance to step up your game and I\u2019m just looking forward to tomorrow,\u201d he said.", "description": "World number two Rory McIlroy said he is motivated to get back into the winner's circle at this week's WGC-HSBC Champions tournament in Shanghai to further his quest to reclaim golf's top ranking.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446529125&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T126-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
