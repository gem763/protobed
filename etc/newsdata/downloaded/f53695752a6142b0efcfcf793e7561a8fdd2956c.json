Some fear the tariffs could ultimately lead to U.S. taxes on European cars, a big economic blow that Trump has been threatening to deliver for months.\n\nThe exchange echoes how the U.S. and China ratcheted up a tariffs fight in recent months that has bruised businesses around the globe and stunted economic growth.\n\n\u201cThis step triggers fears of a new round of escalation of tariff wars,\u201d said Alex Kuptsikevich, a financial analyst with brokerage FxPro. \u201cThe introduction of tariffs and fears of tit-for-tat steps could further suppress business sentiment, which is already at the lowest levels for years.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s latest tariffs target large aircraft but also many typical European products such as olives, whiskey, wine, cheese and yogurt. They take effect Oct. 18 and amount to a 10% tax on EU aircraft and a steep 25% rate on everything else.\n\nThe U.S. got the legal go-ahead Wednesday from the World Trade Organization in a case involving illegal EU subsidies for the plane maker Airbus, which predates the Trump administration.\n\nBut the EU is expecting a similar case involving U.S. subsidies for Boeing to go in its favor, with a ruling due in coming months. It has said it hopes the two sides can hold off new tariffs, which amount to taxes on domestic importers. Sometimes importers pass on the higher costs to consumers, making goods more expensive.\n\n\u201cIf the U.S. imposes countermeasures it will be pushing the EU into a situation where we will have to do the same,\u201d said European Commission spokesman Daniel Rosario, echoing the dark outlook expressed by many EU governments.\n\n\u201cThis is a move that will first and foremost hit U.S. consumers and companies and will make efforts towards a negotiated settlement more complicated,\u201d he said.\n\nA group of American alcohol importers, wholesalers and distributors released an open letter this week urging an end to the tariffs. They say tariffs on Scotch whiskey, liqueurs and wine would affect nearly $3.4 billion in imports and cost 13,000 U.S. jobs, including truckers and bartenders.\n\nThe tariffs come on top of existing ones that the U.S. and EU exchanged last year and multiply the headaches for European businesses fretting over Brexit, which could see Britain leave the EU on Oct. 31 without a deal \u2014 meaning new tariffs overnight on the heavy flow of trade across the Channel.\n\nMore broadly, the tariffs add to uncertainty for the global economy, which has been hit particularly hard by the wide-ranging U.S. dispute with China over trade and technology.\n\nThe U.S. and European economies are more closely integrated than the U.S. and China, with companies heavily invested across borders, so the potential damage from an escalation could dwarf the dispute with China.\n\nTotal U.S. investment in the EU, for example, is three times higher than in all of Asia. And EU investment in the U.S. is eight times that invested in China and India combined. The two sides account for about half of the world economy.\n\n\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for the wider trade war, everybody would kind of shake this off and say it\u2019s just business as usual under WTO rules,\u2019\u2019 said Edward Alden, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cIn the current context, it\u2019s going to be hard to contain. The Europeans feel like their economies are under assault by the Trump administration.\u2019\u2019\n\nThe EU is not allowed to retaliate against U.S. sanctions approved by the WTO. But the 28-country trade bloc has shown a willingness to stretch the rules when it comes to responding to Trump\u2019s aggressive trade policies, Alden said.\n\nFor example, Trump last year imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum from the EU and other countries, claiming they were a threat to U.S. national security. The WTO gives countries wide leeway to decide their own national security interests, so Trump\u2019s move appeared to pass muster with the Geneva-based trade monitor. But the EU lashed back with retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products anyway.\n\nRising uncertainty over one of the oldest and biggest economic trade paths would further darken the outlook for importers, exporters and manufacturers on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nBob Bauer, president of the New Jersey-based Association of Food Industries, which represents around 1,000 food importers and exporters worldwide, said his members are angry that food is being targeted in a dispute over aircraft subsidies.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be paying so that Boeing and Airbus can continue to receive these subsidies,\u201d Bauer said, adding that many food importers are small, family-owned businesses that can\u2019t absorb a 25% tariff because food has low profit margins to begin with.\n\nThe head of the Spanish Federation of Food and Beverage Industries, Mauricio Garc\u00eda de Quevedo, said the new U.S. tariffs will make it harder for the companies he represents to compete internationally. And that will contribute to job losses, he said.\n\nThe United States is the Spanish sector\u2019s second-biggest food and beverage client after the EU, according to the federation. The sector exported $1.9 billion (1.7 billion euros) last year.\n\nMiguel Blanco, the secretary-general of Spain\u2019s farming-sector umbrella group COAG, representing more than 15,000 Spanish farmers and livestock breeders, said the tariffs are \u201ccompletely unfair and overblown.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce again, the farming sector is going to pay for an EU trade war which has nothing to do with the Spanish countryside,\u201d Blanco said, according to Europa Press.\n\nThe Federation of French Wines and Spirits Exporters also deplored the U.S. decision.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t feel at all initially involved in this litigation so we feel we are a bit hostages of these retaliatory measures,\u201d said federation president Antoine Leccia.\n\nIn Germany, which has Europe\u2019s largest economy and focuses heavily on exports, the Federation of German Industries said the U.S. was using the WTO ruling to intensify trade disputes.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on European cars, a huge sector in Germany, and some fear this week\u2019s escalation could lead to that.\n\n\u201cThere is a risk that many industries on both sides of the Atlantic will find themselves in a lose-lose situation,\u201d federation chief Joachim Lang said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nPiovano reported from London.
