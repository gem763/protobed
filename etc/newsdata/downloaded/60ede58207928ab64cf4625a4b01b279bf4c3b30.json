Kamala Harris (D-CA) is shifting her campaign strategy and focusing on Iowa, going as far as preparing \u201cSunday suppers\u201d for families in the Hawkeye State in hopes of recruiting supporters.\n\nThe Harris campaign is touting a new facet of her Iowa swing, dubbed the \u201cI feel your pain\u201d tour. It features a series of more \u201cintimate\u201d meetings with families in the early caucus state, designed to show a different side of the California senator. The tour follows contentious Democrat debates, in which Harris\u2019s competitors \u2014 namely, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) \u2014 highlighted less-than-flattering aspects of Harris\u2019s prosecutorial record.\n\nA Harris adviser spoke to Politico and suggested that the tour is about isolating issues that affect families day-to-day:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about, \u2018Let me talk about myself,\u201d a Harris adviser involved in the planning told POLITICO. \u201cIt\u2019s, \u2018I understand your problems on a human level in a way that you experience them.\u2019 Their concern is not, \u2018I need broad systemic overhauls,\u2019 it\u2019s, \u2018I can\u2019t get a job, or I can\u2019t pay the bills this month, or I can\u2019t pay my student loans, or my yard is flooded.\u2019\u201d \u201cYou have a fundamentally different conversation when you\u2019re sitting around someone\u2019s kitchen table in their home,\u201d the adviser added.\n\nAdditionally, Harris plans to \u201chelp prepare Sunday suppers in peoples\u2019 homes.\u201d\n\nShe also has bigger events planned across the state as well, including a meeting with Moms Demand Action and Women for Kamala events with field organizers.\n\nHarris\u2019s Iowa blitz follows the presidential candidate\u2019s declaration that she is \u201cf*cking moving to Iowa.\u201d\n\nA reporter overheard the remark as Harris expressed her strategy to a colleague:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m f****** moving to Iowa,\u201d Sen. Kamala Harris joked to Sen. Hirono (before she noticed me) pic.twitter.com/dv0PRWLY8g \u2014 Matt Laslo (@MattLaslo) September 18, 2019\n\nThe Harris campaign tried to embrace the \u201coops\u201d moment with a dash of levity:\n\nHarris continues to face an uphill battle in national polls, failing to recapture her once-held top tier status. The most recent Economist/YouGov poll shows Harris in fifth place with just five percent support. Similarly, a Monmouth University Poll released Wednesday shows the California lawmaker tied with Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) in fifth place, with five percent support each.\n\nHarris has a long way to go in Iowa, according to the current Real Clear Politics average. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Joe Biden (D), Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and Buttigieg are leading in Iowa with 23 percent, 20.3 percent, 12 percent, 11.3 percent, respectively. Harris is in fifth place with 5.3 percent support.", "description": "Sen.
