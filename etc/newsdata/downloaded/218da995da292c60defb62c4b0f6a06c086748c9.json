MORE poured fuel on the fire in his fight with Congress over Syria, lashing out at Democrats during a closed-door White House meeting on Wednesday and sparring publicly with Republican allies.\n\nThe chaotic day was a U-turn from earlier this week when the administration applied new sanctions on Turkey in an effort to combat fierce criticism from Capitol Hill and when Republicans were dialing back their furor in an effort to get on the same page as Trump.\n\nBut the unity effort went off the rails in a closed-door meeting between Trump, congressional leadership and key committee members, which was preceded by hours of fighting between Trump and lawmakers.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCongressional Democrats and sources say the president used the meeting to fume at Democrats and former administration officials, at one point calling Speaker Nancy Pelosi Nancy PelosiTrump-GOP tensions over Syria show signs of easing Democratic debate starts with immediate question on Trump impeachment White House, Pentagon, Giuliani reject House subpoenas MORE (D-Calif.) a \u201cthird-rate politician\u201d and former Defense Secretary James Mattis James Norman MattisUS leaves dozens of 'high value' ISIS detainees behind amid Syria retreat: report White House officials stand by Syria withdrawal, sanctions delay amid bipartisan pushback Sunday shows \u2014 Officials rush to Trump's defense on Syria, sanctions MORE \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown, sad to say,\u201d Pelosi told reporters after she left the meeting with Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerTrump defends 'crime buster' Giuliani amid reported probe Louisiana voters head to the polls in governor's race as Trump urges GOP support Trump urges Louisiana voters to back GOP in governor's race then 'enjoy the game' MORE (D-N.Y.) and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer Steny Hamilton HoyerOvernight Health Care \u2014 Presented by National Taxpayers Union \u2014 Buttigieg targets Warren, Sanders on health care ahead of debate | Judge overturns ObamaCare transgender protections | Poll sees support drop for 'Medicare for All' Hillicon Valley: Google, Reddit to testify on tech industry protections | Trump joins Amazon-owned Twitch | House to vote on bill to combat foreign interference Overnight Health Care \u2014 Presented by Coalition Against Surprise Medical Billing \u2014 Judge blocks Trump 'public charge' rule | Appeals court skeptical of Trump arguments for Medicaid work requirements | CDC offers guidance for treating vaping-related cases MORE (D-Md.).\n\n\u201cWe have to pray for his health because this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president,\u201d she added after returning to the Capitol.\n\nSchumer said Trump was \u201cinsulting\u201d to Pelosi.\n\n\u201cShe kept her cool completely, but he called her a third-rate politician,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cI mean, this was not a dialogue. It was sort of a diatribe, a nasty diatribe.\u201d\n\nA Democratic source familiar with how the meeting transpired said it \u201cdevolved into the president calling the Speaker a name. He was quite nasty, so she stood up to go. She started to sit back down but Rep. Hoyer got her to go. Pelosi and Hoyer walked out of the meeting.\u201d\n\nThe source added that when Pelosi and Hoyer were preparing to walk out of the meeting, Trump said to them: \u201cI\u2019ll see you at the polls.\u201d\n\nThe White House hit back at Democrats in a statement and defended Trump.

I hope I\u2019m wrong. I will not be quiet,\u201d Graham told reporters. \u201cThe president\u2019s decision here, I think, is the biggest mistake of his presidency. And I will not ever be quiet \u2014 I will not ever be quiet about matters of national security.\u201d\n\nHe added in a tweet that Trump \u201cappears to be hell-bent on making the same mistakes in Syria as President Obama made in Iraq.\u201d\n\nThe House and Senate were supposed to receive classified briefings on the situation Thursday, but the briefings were nixed.\n\nPelosi tweeted Wednesday afternoon she was \u201cdeeply concerned that the White House has canceled an all-Member classified briefing on the dangerous situation the President has caused in Syria, denying the Congress its right to be informed as it makes decisions about our national security.\u201d\n\nA Senate aide confirmed that the upper chamber\u2019s briefing was canceled, as well.\n\nA Democratic aide told The Hill that the White House gave \u201cno credible justification\u201d for the cancellation.\n\nThe canceled briefings came hours after lawmakers overwhelmingly voted Wednesday to oppose withdrawing from Syria and to back the Kurds, a symbolic rebuke of Trump\u2019s strategy.\n\nIn a 354-60 vote \u2014 with 129 Republicans voting \u201cyes\u201d \u2014 the House passed a resolution from Reps.
