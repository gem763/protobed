(iStock)\n\nConsumer Reports has no financial relationship with any advertisers on this site.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever had a cold that keeps you up at night coughing or painful urinary tract infections that recur regularly, you may have been tempted to simply help yourself to the antibiotics you\u2019ve been storing since last year in your medicine cabinet. Or you might ask a friend or family member for a few pills.\n\nBut doctors don\u2019t recommend taking the drugs without a current prescription, because numerous studies over the years have found that using antibiotics improperly can be risky.\n\nNow, a new review of 31 previous studies, published in July in the Annals of Internal Medicine, suggests that such antibiotic misuse may be common among some people.\n\nHow common? The numbers ranged from as low as 1 percent in a primary care clinic to 66 percent among migrant workers, says lead study author Larissa Grigoryan, assistant professor of family and community medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.\n\nThis news is concerning, says Vance Fowler, an infectious disease specialist at Duke University Hospital in Durham, N.C., who was not part of the study.\n\n\u201cMany people don\u2019t need these drugs,\u201d he says. \u201cBy taking them, they raise their risk of experiencing side effects \u2014 some of them dangerous \u2014 and developing antibiotic resistance.\u201d (Antibiotic resistance can make some bacteria less likely to respond to medications and some infections much harder to cure.)\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to know about this research and how to use antibiotics safely.\n\nWhat the study found\n\nTo find out how common the use of antibiotics without a prescription is in the United States, researchers reviewed studies done in a wide variety of settings and populations.\n\nThese included the waiting rooms of urgent care centers and emergency rooms, clinics for treating sexually transmitted diseases, phone surveys and even a county jail.\n\nEventually, the researchers zeroed in on 31 studies. \u201cOne of the most common scenarios was people using leftover prescriptions, or borrowing from a friend or family member,\u201d says Barbara Trautner, professor and director of Clinical and Health Services Research at Baylor and another of the study authors.\n\nFor instance, a 2018 Internet survey of 496 parents found that of the almost half who kept their child\u2019s leftover antibiotics, 73 percent then gave them to a sibling or an unrelated child or adult.\n\nIn another study, a quarter of the patients in primary care clinics reported that they intended to use antibiotics without a prescription.\n\nIn addition, \u201cIn certain Hispanic or Latino neighborhoods, there\u2019s easy access to antibiotics through flea markets and bodegas, or they\u2019re able to get antibiotics from a relative who got them from another country, where they\u2019re sold over the counter,\u201d Trautner says.\n\nWhy weren\u2019t people simply going to their doctors to seek prescriptions? Lack of health insurance, cost of physician visits, worries about missing work and embarrassment about being treated for sexually transmitted diseases were among the more frequent reasons reported.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to deal with health problems that require quick solutions, and for whatever reason they don\u2019t have the ability to get to a physician,\u201d Trautner says.\n\nThe risks of misuse\n\nThere are a number of reasons to avoid this do-it-yourself use of antibiotics. Effectiveness \u2014 or the lack thereof \u2014 is one. \u201cWe found that people often took antibiotics to treat viral colds, which won\u2019t help you,\u201d Trautner says. Antibiotics are useful only for bacterial infections.\n\nAnd if you do have a bacterial infection, the antibiotics you have at home may be the wrong kind or dose for your condition. Even if it\u2019s the right antibiotic and dose, you may not be getting enough of the pills to adequately treat your infection.\n\nIn addition, some antibiotics can have serious side effects. Clindamycin, for example, raises the risk of a C. difficile infection by destroying the good gut bacteria that keeps harmful ones at bay.\n\nCertain other antibiotics, like tetracycline, could cause kidney damage if they\u2019re taken after they\u2019ve expired. Antibiotics can also interact with other prescription or over-the-counter products you\u2019re taking, including supplements. Without your health-care professional\u2019s oversight, you won\u2019t know.\n\nFinally, if you\u2019re buying antibiotics online or \u201cunder the counter\u201d at, say, a local flea market, you can\u2019t be sure what you\u2019re getting.\n\nThen there\u2019s the increasing threat of antibiotic resistance, which can render the drugs useless when they\u2019re really needed. \u201cI feel a real white-knuckle fear when I prescribe antibiotics, even for routine things like a urinary tract infection, because I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to work,\u201d Trautner says. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing more and more drug-resistant strains of bacteria out there.\u201d\n\n3 steps for safe use\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t share or take leftover antibiotics. Throw away any old ones you have in your medicine cabinet.\n\n\u2022 See your doctor if you think you have an infection that may be bacterial. Your health-care provider can do a thorough checkup and prescribe the appropriate medications.\n\n\u2022 Don\u2019t take these drugs if you don\u2019t need them. \u201cIf your doctor just says you have a cold, don\u2019t push for an antibiotic,\u201d says William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. In addition to colds, many common illnesses \u2014 such as sore throats, sinus infections and pinkeye \u2014 are caused by viruses and clear up on their own.\n\nCopyright 2019, Consumer Reports Inc.\n\nRead More\n\nUrgent care clinics are prescribing too many unnecessary antibiotics, study says\n\nDangerous antibiotic-resistant infections are on the rise among children", "description": "A new study examines how the drugs are being misused.
