One passenger told Queensland\u2019s Courier Mail that the singers \u201crefused to follow crew instructions\u201d.\n\nBut the Veronicas have hit back at reporting of the cabin baggage incident, which they said was \u201cincredibly intimidating and confusing\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe details reported are false and in conflict with video recorded during the event and witness accounts from the flight,\u201d they said on Instagram.\n\n\u201cThe incident was escalated without explanation why from the cabin staff. We cooperated with all requests from authorities and exited the aircraft.\u201d\n\nUnderneath a post from another passenger, they commented from their shared account, \u201cthis was crazy\u201d, calling the event \u201can upsetting and embarrassing experience\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe actually already had our bag up in the overhead,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe female flight attendant wanted Lisa\u2019s bag spun around. Lisa asked the attendant if she could help assist her, because she couldn\u2019t reach it (we\u2019re only 5\u201d1). The attendant said it was against company policy. And a lovely man behind us helped instead.\n\n\u201cThen right before take off, the flight attendant bought over the manager and pointed us out. He proceeded to lecture us about company policy.\u201d\n\nAfter this, they claimed, the staff refused to give the duo their names, and threatened that they would call security. \u201cWe had no idea why. That\u2019s when we started filming!\n\n\u201cWe were so confused as to why asking for their names resulted in us being removed by 3 federal police,\u201d they continued. \u201cWe are still in shock and so upset \u2026 It\u2019s so scary they can call federal police on people without any reason or explanation.\u201d\n\nThe Veronicas, who caught a later flight to Brisbane, added they were pursuing legal action over the incident and media reports of it.\n\nPolice said they were still looking into the incident.", "description": "Sisters Jessica and Lisa Origliasso say reporting of incident \u2018in conflict with video\u2019 evidence, and they will take legal action over \u2018intimidating and confusing\u2019 removal from flight", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/856bf5a3372648530a4d2c2d4b3f21ba8d04345c/732_365_3848_2310/master/3848.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=eaf4de077bf1a72c683206fc8afabdc3", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
