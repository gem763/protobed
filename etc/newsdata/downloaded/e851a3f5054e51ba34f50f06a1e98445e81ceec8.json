That was at the lower end of the 5 to 99 years she could have received after her conviction. Outside the courtroom that sentence was greeted with some anger by local activists who argued the sentence was a slap in the face:\n\nHowever, inside the courtroom, it was a different story. Members of both families were allowed to offer statements. Botham Jean\u2019s younger brother Brandt said he forgave Guyger and wished her the best because that\u2019s what his brother would have wanted. The Washington Post reports that according to the family, Brandt was hardest hit by the loss, so this is quite a powerful reaction.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say twice or for the 100th time how much you\u2019ve taken from us. I think you know that,\u201d Brandt said. He continued, \u201cIf you truly are sorry, I know\u2014I can speak for myself, I forgive you. And I know if you go to God and ask him, he will forgive you.\u201d\n\nSaying he was speaking for himself, not for his family, Brandt added, \u201cI love you just like anyone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want the best for you because I know that that\u2019s exactly what Botham would want you to do, and the best would be [to] give your life to Christ,\u201d he said.\n\nThen turning to the Judge, he asked, \u201cI don\u2019t know if this is possible but can I give her a hug please?\u2019 The judge allowed it and, in front of the bench, the victim\u2019s brother and the woman who shot and killed him hugged for nearly a minute while the judge wiped tears from her eyes.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to say except that you\u2019ll probably find it hard to make it through this clip with dry eyes. That and what an extraordinary young man Brandt Jean is. If this really is what his older brother Botham would have wanted then he must have been pretty extraordinary too.", "description": "\"...can I give her a hug please?\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Botham-Jeans-brother.jpg"}
