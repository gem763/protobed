It also would require the president to report to Congress and impose sanctions on the individuals responsible for \u201cabducting and torturing\u201d human rights activists.\n\nThe measure has bipartisan support in both chambers.\n\nAmericans are \u201cunited in our strong support for Hong Kong,\u201d Republican Representative Michael McCaul said at news conference Wednesday that included Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democratic lawmakers and Hong Kong democracy advocates. \u201cThis is a battle between democracy and dictatorship.\u201d\n\nThe action comes a day after a bicameral panel of lawmakers heard from pro-democracy activists visiting Washington from Hong Kong in support of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019.\n\n\u201cIt is my belief that it is long overdue for the United States and the free world to respond,\u201d Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who is sponsoring the legislation in the Senate, said during the Tuesday hearing.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration hasn\u2019t said whether it would support the legislation at the same time as it\u2019s engaged in negotiations to de-escalate the trade war with China. Chinese trade officials are scheduled to travel to the U.S. this week to prepare for a meeting of senior negotiators in October.\n\n\u2018A Longer Look\u2019\n\n\u201cThe president has made very clear that he supports the right of people in Hong Kong to be protesting out in the street for their freedom,\u201d Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway told reporters. But she said she hadn\u2019t discussed Rubio\u2019s proposal with the president.\n\nAt a hearing Wednesday, Senator Bob Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, asked the assistant secretary of state for east Asian and Pacific affairs, David Stillwell, whether the White House supports the Hong Kong measure.\n\n\u201cI need to take a longer look at the legislation,\u201d Stillwell said.\n\n\u201cI would urge you to do so because it\u2019s a pretty bipartisan effort here and we believe that it\u2019s an appropriate one so I would like to get a clearer answer from the administration,\u201d Menendez said. \u201cWe\u2019d welcome participation but I think this is a moving vehicle.\u201d\n\nForeign Relations Committee Chairman Jim Risch said his panel will move swiftly on the bill and that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell would support a vote on the legislation.\n\nRepresentative Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican and the bill\u2019s House sponsor, said he expects that his Hong Kong measure would get a vote in the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Sept. 25.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s government expressed \u201cdeep regret\u201d Wednesday over remarks made by its citizens at the hearing, saying in a statement that \u201cforeign legislatures should not interfere in any form\u201d in the city\u2019s internal affairs.\n\nThe government \u201cabsolutely respects the public\u2019s freedoms and rights of assembly, procession and expression,\u201d it said. \u201cThe police will continue to fully facilitate the conduct of peaceful and rational public events by members of the public.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry also pushed back Wednesday. \u201cWe urge the U.S. and other sides to stop interfering in China\u2019s affairs and we would like to warn certain people that any attempts to disrupt Hong Kong by soliciting foreign support will not succeed,\u201d ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters in Beijing.\n\n(Adds Trump adviser\u2019s remarks in eighth paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Justin Sink.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Daniel Flatley in Washington at dflatley1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Joe Sobczyk at jsobczyk@bloomberg.net, Laurie Ass\u00e9o\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Momentum is building for quick action in Congress to pressure China to back off any crackdown on pro-democracy protesters by threatening Hong Kong\u2019s special trading status with the U.S.Legislation is moving through the House and Senate that would require annual assessments of whether the", "authors": ["Daniel Flatley"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yGDqNwhcL98f9ABIeFRMLQ--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/2e268f91885c79dbabb3bf08f17b0123", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
