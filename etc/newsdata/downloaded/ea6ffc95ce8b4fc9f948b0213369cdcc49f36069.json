The Treasurer asked the ACCC to conduct an investigation after the sector snubbed its nose at the RBA and refused to pass rate cuts in full. Mr Frydenberg said an inquiry would be \u201cfocused on the residential mortgage market and particularly why the banks have not passed on these rate cuts in full\u201d. Mr Frydenberg told Sky News \u201cultimately consumers must come first\u201d so the probe will be launched \u201cto understand why there is such a big difference between what is charged to a loyal customer and what is charged to a new customer that the banks are trying to win over\u201d. \u201cUltimately, it\u2019s the consumers who are worse off because if these three most recent rate cuts had been passed on in full, then someone with a $400,000 mortgage would be paying $500 less a year in interest payments,\u201d he said.
