The organisation tweeted this morning that the MPs had had 'productive meetings' with EU figures\n\nMr Grieve said that even if a deal is done in the next 48 hours there would still be a need for a Brexit delay.\n\nHe told the Mirror: 'The suggestion that we can magically have a deal presented to parliament to approve on Saturday so we can leave on the 31st is not only a fantasy but it's very dangerous because if there's an attempt to do that it's really short-circuiting the normal processes of the House of Commons.\n\n'And Parliament may wish to attach a confirmatory referendum to any deal that is negotiated because the deal bears no resemblance to what was being promoted in the 2016 referendum at all.'\n\nMr Grieve said MPs must be given the necessary 'space' to adequately respond to the coming events and that could involve Parliament deciding whether it wants to 'attach' a second referendum to any proposed deal.\n\nBest for Britain tweeted this morning that the delegation had had 'productive meetings with other member states' and that later the MPs will meet with Mr Verhofstadt.\n\n'If no acceptable deal can be passed, PM must ask for a sensible extension to give public the final say & resolve the Brexit crisis,' the group said.\n\nMr Lammy added on Twitter today: 'Deal or No Deal, the public deserves a final say and the option to Remain.\n\n'We're working cross party to show the EU an extension will allow the UK to have a democratic moment to solve this crisis.'\n\nThe meeting with Mr Verhofstadt is likely to prove controversial given the senior MEP's recent attack on Mr Johnson.\n\nLast week Mr Verhofstadt labelled the PM a 'traitor' in an incendiary speech in the European Parliament.\n\nHe claimed Mr Johnson treated anyone who opposed him on Brexit as a 'traitor' or as a 'collaborator' before telling MEPs that the 'real traitor' was actually the British PM.\n\nHe said: 'All those who are not playing his game are traitors, or collaborators, or surrenderers.\n\n'Well, in my opinion, dear colleagues, the real traitor is he or she who would risk bringing disaster upon his country, its economy, its citizens by pushing Britain out of the European Union. That is, in my opinion, a traitor.'\n\nBoth the EU and UK had been hopeful of a deal being agreed today but that is hanging in the balance as gaps remain between the two sides in key areas.\n\nIf no deal has been agreed by October 19 the Benn Act will legally require Mr Johnson to write a letter to the EU asking for a Brexit delay to the end of January next year.\n\nThe government has suggested that Parliament could sit on Saturday - the first Saturday sitting since the Falklands War - to respond to the outcome of tomorrow's summit.\n\nThat sitting is not guaranteed and could yet be ditched but one government source said today it was still 'more likely than not'.", "description": "A delegation of Remainer rebels is meeting with representatives of a number of EU member states before a scheduled sit down with Guy Verhofstadt.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/12/19783462-0-image-a-18_1571224687003.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
