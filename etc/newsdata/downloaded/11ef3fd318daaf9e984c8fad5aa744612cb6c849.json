'There were people after tickets even after it had closed!'\n\nThe show starred Sheridan Smith as the Narrator, Jason Donovan as Pharaoh, and newcomer Jac Yarrow in the title role of Joseph.\n\nYarrow, a 21-year-old plucked from the classrooms of the Arts Educational School in West London, delayed his graduation until he had completed his run as the lad sold into slavery by his scheming brothers.\n\nLast Sunday, Jac Yarrow (pictured) picked up the Joe Allen Best West End Debut Award at The Stage newspaper's Debut Awards\n\nLast Sunday, he picked up the Joe Allen Best West End Debut Award at The Stage newspaper's Debut Awards. I understand that the young actor \u2014 who won rave reviews for his performance \u2014 is in advanced negotiations to play the hero from the Book of Genesis again next summer.\n\nHarrison and Lloyd Webber's LW Theatre group are also discussing taking Joseph to Broadway in 2021. Every major theatre owner travelled to see the witty Palladium production.\n\nI hear that the Nederlander Theatres organisation is discussing taking Joseph in 2021.\n\nThe Americans were very impressed by Yarrow and want the Cardiff-born actor on Broadway, though all the other cast members for the U.S. version would be American performers.\n\nYarrow, a 21-year-old plucked from the classrooms of the Arts Educational School in West London, delayed his graduation until he had completed his run\n\nThe influential New York Times theatre critic Ben Brantley, who was charmed by Yarrow's voice, wrote that the young Welshman 'sings with the whispery sincerity expected of a Lloyd Webber hero'.\n\nThere has also been interest in the show from elsewhere: Australia, South Africa and Asia.\n\nTickets for the 2020 production will go on sale today from 10am to priority members of LW Theatres; and on general sale next Friday, September 27.\n\nThose purchasing tickets via josephthemusical.com will not be asked to pay a booking fee.\n\nLowest price tickets are \u00a310 during previews, rising to \u00a320 after the July 16 gala opening.\n\nSea Wall/A Life starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Tom Sturridge may come to the West End\n\nCapital idea for hit plays\n\nProducers of Sea Wall/A Life, the two monologues starring Jake Gyllenhaal and Tom Sturridge that have become a hit on Broadway, are in 'early conversations' about bringing the production to the West End.\n\nI saw the plays at the Hudson Theatre and I'm still haunted by them.\n\nSturridge's performance in Simon Stephens' Sea Wall was so raw people around me wept.\n\nA Life by Nick Payne is equally moving, with Gyllenhaal on top form.\n\nRiva Marker, president of lead producer Nine Stories, confirmed that 'conversations' are being held about London, in particular about timings, and whether the plays should come before or after Gyllenhaal does Sunday In The Park With George at the Savoy Theatre.\n\nThat show will run from June 11 through to September 5.\n\nA Life by Nick Payne is equally moving, with Gyllenhaal on top form in the haunting production\n\nSturridge's performance in Simon Stephens' Sea Wall was so raw people around me wept\n\nJennifer's happy medium\n\nJennifer Saunders is bringing her clairvoyant Madame Arcati \u2014 whom she describes as 'a good old English mix of Barbara Woodhouse and Mystic Meg' \u2014into the West End.\n\nSaunders appeared in Richard Eyre's production of Blithe Spirit, which was a West Country hit over the summer.\n\nNoel Coward's play was first performed in 1941, to cheer up those on the Home Front, and it is now a theatrical evergreen.\n\nJennifer Saunders is bringing her clairvoyant Madame Arcati into the West End\n\nSaunders had a ball playing Arcati at the Theatre Royal in Bath. 'She's a sort of classic for a woman of a certain age,' she said, 'so why not?'\n\nThe wacky medium \u2014 who tries to rid writer Charles Condomine of the ghost of his dead first wife, Elvira \u2014 is a great comic character, in part because she's so sincere.\n\n'She absolutely believes in it,' Saunders agreed. 'She's not a faker, and she believes she's serving a good purpose for people.'\n\nSaunders recalled discussing the play with Joanna Lumley, her AbFab co-star, who played Elvira in an earlier production. 'She said: 'Darling, she's jolly hockey sticks.' And she is.'\n\nThe wacky medium \u2014 who tries to rid writer Charles Condomine of the ghost of his dead first wife, Elvira \u2014 is a great comic character, in part because she's so sincere\n\nShe's also a great English eccentric. 'Yes,' Saunders responded. 'They're a dying breed. You don't see them much in life; and you don't see them much in actresses, like Beryl Reid and Irene Handl; the kind of woman who doesn't dye her hair or lose weight.'\n\nSaunders will enjoy donning Anthony Ward's costumes again. 'He designed shapes for her skirts and hand-knitted cardigans. Someone asked if I put on weight for the part. I looked at them and said: 'No!' '\n\nBlithe Spirit will run at the Duke of York's Theatre from March 5 for six weeks.\n\nSaunders appeared in Richard Eyre's production of Blithe Spirit, which was a West Country hit over the summer\n\nBefore that, it visits the Theatre Royal, Brighton from January 22, heading to Malvern, back to Bath, then Cambridge, Richmond and the Theatre Royal, Norwich.\n\nSaunders has filmed the eight-part Harlan Coben thriller The Stranger for Netflix, with Richard Armitage and Siobhan Finneran. And she may reunite with Dawn French for a BBC radio special at Christmas.\n\nArinze Kene has been picked by director Julia Hart and producer Jordan Horowitz to star opposite Rachel Brosnahan (The Marvellous Mrs Maisel) in I'm Your Woman.\n\nCasting directors saw Kene in Death Of A Salesman, directed by Marianne Elliott and Miranda Cromwell at the Young Vic.\n\nThe movie shoots in the U.S., so he can't join Wendell Pierce and Sharon D. Clarke in Salesman's transfer to the Piccadilly Theatre next month.\n\nKate Prince is about to start work on choreographing and directing Message In A Bottle\n\nWatch out for...\n\nKate Prince, who has just finished choreographing the likes of Richard E. Grant, Max Harwood, Sharon Horgan and Sarah Lancashire, for the film version of West End success Everybody's Talking About Jamie.\n\nPrince is about to start work on choreographing and directing Message In A Bottle, featuring songs associated with Sting.\n\nThe Sadler's Wells production will run at the Peacock Theatre from February 6.\n\nHaving watched her rehearse hundreds of extras for the Jamie film finale, I reckon she can handle the 'mammoth undertaking'.", "description": "The Joseph musical, which became a summer sensation at the London Palladium - taking more than \u00a311 million during its ten-and-a-half-week run - is returning to the world-famous variety house.", "authors": ["Baz Bamigboye For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/19/23/18695370-0-image-a-71_1568933125134.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
