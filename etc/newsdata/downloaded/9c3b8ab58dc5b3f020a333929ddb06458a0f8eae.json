Political Incorporation and the Transformation of Black Public Opinion,\u201d Katherine Tate, a political scientist at Brown, wrote that starting in the 1980s,\n\npublic opinion revealed a distinctive shift toward political moderation. The black opinion shift, I argue, is based on the transformation of African-American politics, away from radical challenges to the political status quo toward inclusive, bipartisan electoral politics.\n\nContemporary polling provides evidence of moderation among black Democrats compared with the views of white Democrats. The poll data suggests a reversal of traditional roles. More conservative and more centrist Democratic whites were once the tempering force within party ranks. Now, on some of the most controversial issues currently under debate, African-Americans \u2014 who make up an estimated 25 percent of Democratic primary voters \u2014 have emerged as a force for more moderate stands as white Democrats have moved sharply left.\n\nPublic Opinion Research, one of two firms that conduct surveys for The Wall Street Journal and NBC News, provided The Times with data describing the views of white and black Democratic primary voters", "description": "Recent research shows that a crucial bloc of Democrats is at once more moderate and more radical than its counterparts.", "authors": ["Thomas B.
