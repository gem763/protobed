The crucial break of serve came in the second game, with Murray saving two break points but not a third, and the Swiss served it out 6-3.\n\nMurray looked in deep trouble when Wawrinka broke again in the third game of the second set, and the Scot had to save more break points to avoid losing a fourth game in a row.\n\n(Image: BELGA/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n(Image: BELGA MAG/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nBut, having dug in, he got his reward as Wawrinka's serve went off the boil and his level dipped, with Murray breaking back to 3-3.\n\nWawrinka had two more chances at 4-4 but again Murray fought off the danger and remarkably it was Murray who then took his first set point to clinch it 6-4 and level the match.\n\nWawrinka stepped up again early in the third set and was twice a break ahead but once more Murray dug in, hitting back immediately both times.\n\n(Image: BELGA MAG/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nMurray saved two more break points at 4-4 to leave Wawrinka serving to stay in the match, and when the Swiss blazed a forehand well off target on Murray's first match point, it was the former world number one celebrating victory.\n\nThe tears quickly flowed for Murray, who last lifted a singles trophy in March 2017.", "description": "The Brit battled back from a set down to claim his first title since his long injury lay off", "authors": ["Jacob Murtagh", "Image", "Belga Afp Via Getty Images", "Belga Mag Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20661007.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_TENNIS-BEL-ATP.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
