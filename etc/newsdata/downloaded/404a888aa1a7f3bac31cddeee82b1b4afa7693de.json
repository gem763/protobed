(AP) - Melvin Gordon called Los Angeles Chargers coach Anthony Lynn on Wednesday night to let him know he was ending his holdout.\n\nLynn wasn\u2019t ready to believe it until the fifth-year running back walked through the door at the team\u2019s complex. That happened Thursday morning as Gordon took part in his first practice since the final day of minicamp on June 13.\n\nGordon missed training camp and LA\u2019s first three games as he held out for 65 days in the vain hopes of getting a new contract.\n\nLynn said he wasn\u2019t concerned about Gordon\u2019s frame of mind after their long conversation.\n\n\u201cThat was the biggest concern, but I\u2019m telling you that he\u2019s in a good place right now. He just wanted to play football,\u201d Lynn said.\n\nGordon did not appear during Thursday\u2019s media availability. He is expected to take questions after Friday\u2019s practice.\n\nLynn said he doubts Gordon would be ready to play Sunday when the Chargers (1-2) visit Miami but he wanted to assess his conditioning and agility during practices before making a final decision.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not concerned about the contact. He has played football all his life. I just want to see where he is stamina-wise,\u201d Lynn said.\n\nLynn usually leaves players at home who have no shot of playing but he said having Gordon on the cross-country trip to Florida could be beneficial.\n\n\u201cI just think if there are more people, more distractions. I think this can be a good distraction. I like this one,\u201d Lynn said.\n\nGordon has gained over 1,200 yards from scrimmage and scored 10 or more touchdowns in three straight seasons, but the Chargers running game still thrived in his absence. Los Angeles running backs are averaging 5.4 yards per carry, which is third-best in the league and over a yard more than the NFL average.\n\nAustin Ekeler leads AFC running backs in yards from scrimmage and Justin Jackson is averaging 7.9 yards per carry.\n\n\u201cWe got a little swag back in the room. We have one of our playmakers back and I\u2019m glad he is with us,\u201d Ekeler said. \u201cWe can finally move forward as a full unit.\u201d\n\nEkeler added that all three backs can coexist in the offense and that it might allow coordinator Ken Whisenhunt to add some creative wrinkles.\n\nJackson said it was a relief to have Gordon back and that the team\u2019s energy picked up during the morning walkthrough.\n\nGordon was slated to make $5.6 million on the fifth-year option of his rookie contract. He is subject to $1.2 million worth of fines along with losing $988,236 for missing the first three games.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Melvin Gordon called Los Angeles Chargers coach Anthony Lynn on Wednesday night to let him know he was ending his holdout.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Reedy"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/25/chargers_gordon_football_55968_c0-123-4187-2564_s1770x1032.jpg?f686f6f7b183411c542e506be44cc9ab2a6beea3", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
