Nothing changes.\u201d\n\nTurning his real fire on football\u2019s decision-makers, the four-time African player of the year said: \u201cPeople from FIFA don\u2019t care anyway because we\u2019ve been talking about this, but it\u2019s still continuing.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to say that I\u2019m not concerned, I\u2019m concerned,\u201d said the former Ivory Coast international.\n\nRaheem Sterling, the England and Manchester City forward, has been widely praised for playing a prominent role in calling out the racists at home and abroad.\n\nBut Toure, his former team-mate at City, said that was \u201cnot good enough\u201d.\n\nToure, whose trophy haul includes three Premier League titles with City and a UEFA Champions League with Barcelona, believes it is time the players took more decisive action.\n\n\u201cThey have to be serious about it, players need to make serious moves about it otherwise they (the racists) will continue to do that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey have to get the players out of the field.\u201d\n\nFIFA did not immediately reply to an AFP request for comment.\n\n\u2013 \u2018They respect nobody\u2019 \u2013\n\nToure was speaking after he played a pivotal role for Qingdao in a 2-0 win on Saturday at Shanghai Shenxin, attended by just a few hundred spectators.\n\nVictory ensured promotion to the top-tier Chinese Super League for the team that Toure joined in July, but he is unlikely to make the move up with them next year.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll finish in December or January, then go, have another challenge,\u201d he said, vowing to play on until he is 40.\n\n\u201cPeople are thinking that I\u2019m done, but I\u2019m not done yet,\u201d he said.\n\nToure has enjoyed his spell in Chinese football and stressed that he has never experienced any form of discrimination in the country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a nice experience because I\u2019ve seen people with a different mentality from Europe \u2014 the way to play football, the way they feel and their behaviour on the field,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen I play in the stadiums, nobody boos me because I\u2019m black, it\u2019s a different culture, they respect.\n\n\u201cIn Europe, they respect nobody.\u201d", "description": "Shanghai (AFP) \u2013 Yaya Toure says FIFA is not doing enough to stamp out racism and that England should have walked off the pitch in the face of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/27/0c36ac_yaya-toure-fifa-isn-stamp-out-racism-in-football-yaya-toure-fifa-don-racism-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
