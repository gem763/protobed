Last month, the group established an urban air mobility division and hired an expert from the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, Shin Jai-won, to head the business. The group said in a statement that the division will be establishing a road map to enter the global air mobility market and develop airborne travel systems.When asked by an employee how he intends to overcome difficulties in the slow growing auto industry, Chung said the company needs to make industry-leading services and solutions on top of manufacturing cars.\u201cGlobally there are about 25 million cars oversupplied \u2026 and there will be a lot of companies disappearing in the future auto industry,\u201d Chung said. \u201cSecuring competitiveness is the most important thing \u2026 and customers will choose our cars when we can offer good services and solutions.\u201dHe also discussed corporate culture.\u201cI think when employees are satisfied, that is [an ideal organization].\u201dBY KIM JEE-HEE [kim.jeehee@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://pds.joins.com/jmnet/koreajoongangdaily/_data/photo/2019/10/22195301.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
