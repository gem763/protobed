However, we cannot ignore the fact that one in five children are not,\u201d Professor Fonagy said.\n\n\u201cWe should be pleased that so many young people are resilient to the pressures of 21st Century life, and be both prepared to stand by and support those who struggle.\u201d\n\nHealth secretary Matt Hancock added children should feel \u201cvalued, supported and listened to\u201d from a young age.\n\n\u201cIt is encouraging this report finds the majority of our young people are happy, but our mental health is an asset \u2013 just like our physical health, so it is vital children get the support they need,\u201d Mr Hancock stated.\n\n\u201cWe are training a new dedicated mental health workforce in schools and colleges across the country, to ensure quicker access to a range of support and treatments, as well as teaching pupils what good mental health and physical health looks like.\u201d\n\nThe publication of the report delivers on a governmental commitment made this time last year to publish a report on an annual basis that explores the mental health of young people.\n\nIn addition to the report, guidance is also being offered in schools so the wellbeing of students is being looked after and monitored.\n\nIf you are in need of mental health support, you can contact the free Samaritans helpline on 116 123, email jo@samaritans.org or visit www.samaritans.org to find details of your nearest branch.", "description": "Nearly one in five young people say they are not happy with their lives, the government\u2019s first \u201cState of the Nation\u201d report on children\u2019s wellbeing has found.
