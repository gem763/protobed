Jeremy La Trobe-Bateman, who is the seneschal \u2013 Sark\u2019s judge \u2013 insisted the island was perfectly safe. \u201cI may be the judge but I don\u2019t sit that often,\u201d he said.\n\nLa Trobe-Bateman said the last serious crime he sat on was about two years ago \u2013 an assault. \u201cLike in any small community, people do squabble but it is a peaceful place.\u201d\n\nIn his report to the island\u2019s parliament (known as the chief pleas) as he left his post, Fawson said the Sark police were dealing with an ever-increasing range of incidents.\n\nHe argued the island needed a permanent customs presence. \u201cCurrently there is no way of detecting or preventing illegal narcotics or other illegal goods entering Sark on passengers coming off vessels entering the Sark harbours,\u201d he said.\n\nFawson said no legally enforceable checks could be made on anyone entering Sark and added: \u201cPossibly all externally recruited seasonal employees should by law be made to have a DBS vetting check performed on them before they are employed on Sark.\n\n\u201cAdditionally anyone wishing to live on Sark should be made to have a criminal records check \u2026 Sark in the past (and current) has been awash with people who have various criminal convictions, which in many cases we have no knowledge of until another offence is committed.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cMost unlawful incidents \u2026 that the Sark police constables are called out to involve people who are intoxicated through alcohol. Also underage alcohol consumption on Sark appears to be widespread. We as a community need to do more to address the issues of excessive alcohol consumption.\u201d\n\nTurning to what he called a \u201ccode of silence\u201d, he said: \u201cIn many cases when an unlawful incident occurs, the Sark police constables are met with a wall of silence and an unwillingness of people to make an official complaint that would enable someone being brought to account for their actions. It can and does perpetuate a vicious circle of violence/drunkenness/disorder/abuse, this vicious circle then moves on from one generation to the next and is never broken.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Fawson\u2019s remarks have caused offence on Sark, a place known better as a picture postcard tourist destination. Photograph: robertharding/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nFawson listed 267 \u201cissues and incidents\u201d that had been reported in the past 12 months. There were 11 alleged assaults, four burglaries \u2013 plus eight \u201ccarriage usage\u201d and five \u201cequine\u201d issues.\n\nThe largest number of complaints was about \u201ctractor usage including out of hours\u201d and there was one knife crime and one firearm incident. There was a single road rage problem, 11 incidents when people were adjudged to be wasting police time \u2013 and two cases of unexploded bombs being found.\n\nLike its neighbours, Jersey and Guernsey, Sark is a crown dependency with its own independent administrative and legal system. In 2008 after 400 years of feudalism it held democratic elections.\n\nBut Fawson called for a fundamental review of the legal system, saying that some of Sark\u2019s laws were simply not enforceable.\n\nHis remarks have caused some consternation on Sark. Beth , one of the workers at the tourist information office, said islanders were surprised. \u201cSark is incredibly safe,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t lock our doors here; I don\u2019t ever lock up my bicycle.\u201d\n\nBeth said that some visitors did get a little \u201clairy\u201d sometimes. \u201cBut it\u2019s nothing like being in a city centre at the weekend.\u201d", "description": "Stopping smuggling of drugs and other illegal goods on to Channel island impossible, says outgoing conn\u00e9table", "authors": ["Steven Morris"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e82c5195c5fefd4a1ede939b3fb3004a28f12407/335_602_4386_2632/master/4386.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=92d4ca51fa29d5e9ee02a09f1b446ba6", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
