Is it a cross-country move to your dream city? Opening a business? Starting your own blog?\n\nNow, consider: Why haven\u2019t you checked it off your list yet?\n\nAs Jessica Abel, a cartoonist and author, explains, it\u2019s because it\u2019s become part of your Idea Debt. And as we all know, debt can be hard to pay off. Writes Abel (emphasis hers):\n\nIdea Debt is when you spend too much time picturing what a project is going to be like, too much time thinking about how awesome it will be to have this thing done and in the world, too much time imagining how cool you will look, how in demand you\u2019ll be, how much money you\u2019ll make. And way too little time actually making the thing.\n\nIt\u2019s the screenplay idea you\u2019ve had for 10 years, the podcast you\u2019re always brainstorming but never executing, the novel you keep promising to sit down and write, yet never find time for. Despite all of the conversations you\u2019ve had about your Idea, the to-do lists you\u2019ve made and the tutorials you\u2019ve viewed, you still haven\u2019t gotten anywhere. Abel\u2019s point\u2014one we could all take\u2014is that it\u2019s time to pay off the debt and move on.\n\nAbel says she first encountered the term Idea Debt while interviewing Kazu Kibuishi, a graphic novel author and illustrator. Kibuishi relates it to his time snowboarding: He would build up a big jump in his head, scared to take it, only to be slightly let down when he finally did. The experience never lived up to the hype. \u201cAnd so one thing I learned is to just hit the jump or just pass it. Just do it in the moment. Or not at all,\u201d said Kibuishi. \u201cAnd so you can move on and wait for the next time.\u201d\n\nIt reminds me of a similar productivity tip I\u2019ve written about: OHIO, or Only Handle It Once. When you need to do something\u2014from the mundane, like answering an email, to the more exciting, like writing your memoir\u2014the best course of action is always to just do it. As soon as you think of the idea, as soon as the email lands in your inbox\u2014just take care of it, then and there. Then it won\u2019t be weighing on your mind.\n\nIdea Debt takes this one step further: You\u2019re not just putting off answering an email for a few weeks, you\u2019re putting your dreams on hold indefinitely. How many of us have put off taking dance lessons because we don\u2019t want to look silly, or don\u2019t try living in a new city because we\u2019re scared? What about launching the newsletter we keep telling friends about, or finally sending in our manuscript?\n\nAbel relates it to perfectionism \u2014 we have such high expectations for projects, we want to give them our all, but that often comes at the expense of actually producing anything, of actually living our lives. Instead of acting, we imagine what it would be like if we did act. In other words, the perfect is the enemy of the good. As this piece says, there\u2019s a time to dream and a time to do. It\u2019s time to do.\n\n\u201cAvoiding Idea Debt is about acting before you think too much and get overwhelmed by how hard, and how important your project feels,\u201d writes Abel.\n\nAnd as much as it\u2019s about jumping, it\u2019s also about skipping the jumps you haven\u2019t taken. Jumps you\u2019ve outgrown. Abel writes:\n\nWhat happens when you carry Idea Debt for too long, and your life moves on, is that your idea hangs on like an albatross. You can\u2019t move on to new, exciting, more mature work, because you promised yourself you\u2019d finish this thing.\n\nAsk yourself: Are the ideas taking up space in your head the ideas of today, or an earlier you? Do they still excite you? Will they help you become the person you want to be, or are they just sitting there because you\u2019ve never cleaned them out? Allowing yourself to move on frees you from that Idea Debt so you can take on new initiatives and goals.\n\nSo that\u2019s the choice: Do it now, or let it go and make room for new ideas. Don\u2019t let your Idea Debt keep compounding.", "description": "What\u2019s the biggest goal on your to-do list? Is it a cross-country move to your dream city? Opening a business?
