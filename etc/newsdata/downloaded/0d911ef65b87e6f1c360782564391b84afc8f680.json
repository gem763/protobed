I tried to push on in my own way.\n\n\"Last season was tough. I wasn't playing at Sheffield United but couldn't complain because they were doing really well and won promotion.\n\n(Image: X03811)\n\n\"I have learned so much at Oxford this season, knowing I am able to play 90 minutes and keep fighting for the team.\n\n\"Watching someone like Serge Gnabry develop is a big help.\n\n\"I saw his four goals for Bayern Munich against Tottenham in the Champions League. When he was 20, he couldn't get a game on loan at West Brom.\n\n\"He has shown you can push through if you keep working hard and hopefully I can do something like he's done.\"", "description": "Welsh international became Liverpool's youngest ever scorer three years ago - and is still determined to make it at Anfield", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Reuters"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20584113.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_2018-World-Cup-Qualifications-Europe-Wales-vs-Austria.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
