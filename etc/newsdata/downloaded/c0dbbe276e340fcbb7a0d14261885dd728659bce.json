You wanna go to jail?\" prompting Pointer to respond with, \"For what? Protecting my child?\" according to the video and charging documents.\n\nShortly after that, the teenager steps up to Lawson and Lawson strikes him in the face.\n\nThe officer claimed the teenager had \"both fists balled up,\" but the prosecutor's office said video showed that the boy's left and right hand were open and by his side when he approached the officer.\n\nLawson also said another officer witnessed the teenager \"swing his fist\" at Lawson. However, that officer later said in official statements she did not observe that.\n\nLawson turned himself in Monday. Calls to Pointer and Lawson were not returned.\n\nJohn Kautzman, Lawson's lawyer, said in a statement to Indianapolis ABC affiliate WRTV, \"We look forward to a full and fair review of ALL the evidence in this case, including the officer's observations, perceptions and training as it relates to the entirety of this encounter.\"\n\nThe Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said Lawson was placed on suspension without pay following the charges against him. Chief Bryan Roach is recommending he be terminated, according to a statement from the department.\n\nThe Indianapolis Public Schools released a statement saying they \"are supportive\" of the charges and will continue to monitor the situation.\n\nSuperintendent Aleesia Johnson put out an emotional statement the day after the incident.\n\n\"As a black woman and a mother of black children, it isn't possible to watch the video of the incident that occurred yesterday at Shortridge without immediately thinking about the other incidents in our country that occur between white police officers and black people, especially males,\" Johnson wrote on Facebook. \"Often I am left feeling a number of emotions -- devastation often chief among them.\"\n\nThe teenager who Lawson struck was not taken into custody and no charges were filed against him, officials said.", "description": "An Indiana police officer was charged with battery and accused of making false statements regarding an incident in which video shows him punching a student.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/robert-lawson-flt-ht-ps-190917_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
