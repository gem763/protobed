As part of the scramble in the executive branch caused by the whistle-blower\u2019s complaint, the Justice Department secretly investigated Mr. Trump for a potential campaign-finance violation. The department reportedly cleared him because the contributions solicited from a foreign government to his campaign were not quantifiable \u201cthings of value.\u201d That\u2019s the key phrase in one of the most important campaign-finance laws\u2026\n\nFor over 40 years, a memorandum of understanding has stood between the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission, and it has been duly entered into The Federal Register. It\u2019s a guide for how Justice and the F.E.C. should interact in administering federal election law. The document recognizes that some election law violations, for whatever reason, \u201cmay not be proper subjects for prosecution as crimes\u201d under key criminal provisions of the federal election law statutes. The document then explains how the two agencies should interact when one or the other learns of potential violations.\n\nHere\u2019s the key part for our purpose: When information comes to the attention of the Justice Department indicating a \u201cprobable violation\u201d of the Federal Election Campaign Act, the document says, \u201cthe department will apprise the commission of such information at the earliest opportunity.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Katyal", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Trump-Whistleblower-Fec.Html"], "top_image": ""}
