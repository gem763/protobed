Wilson allegedly claimed she wanted to \"shoot 400 people for fun and that there were so many people at her old school that she would like to do it,\" according to the person who reported her.\n\nWilson denied such threats to investigators and reportedly admitted she suffered from mental health issues, like suicidal and homicidal thoughts.
