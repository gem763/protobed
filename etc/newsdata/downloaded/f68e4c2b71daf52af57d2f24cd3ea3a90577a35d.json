Bernie Sanders once again engaged in some magical thinking regarding Medicare-for-All, the cornerstone of his and Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s bids for the presidency.\n\n\u201cEvery study done shows that Medicare-for-All is the most cost-effective approach to providing health care to every man, woman, and child in this country,\u201d he proclaimed, adding that it would \u201celiminate all out-of-pocket expenses, all deductibles, all copayments.\u201d\n\nIf that sounds too good to be true, that\u2019s because it is. If Sens. Sanders and Warren and other proponents of \u201cM4A\u201d are to build more credibility with the centrists and independents who decide most presidential elections, they should be able to answer the following 10 questions, a couple of which I hope they\u2019ll be asked at tonight\u2019s debate:", "description": "Elizabeth Warren is due for some no-nonsense questions on Medicare for All (and so is Bernie Sanders).
