But the stereotype existed because it was true, she said.\n\n\"Obviously all crimes can be committed of anybody of any gender,\" Dr Duggan said. \"But while some women do commit serious crimes, they do so far less frequently than men.\"\n\nDr Duggan said gender stereotypes were often exploited by organised criminal groups when carrying out large-scale crimes.", "description": "Europol has revealed the names of Europe's most-wanted fugitives - and 18 of the 21 criminals on the list are women, warning they are \u201cequally capable\u201d of committing serious crimes as men.
