This means Boris Johnson did not get the clean yes or no vote on his Brexit deal that he had hoped for in Saturday\u2019s \u201csuper sitting\u201d and must by law request an extension. In short, it pushes the focus of Brexit decision-making into next week.\n\nWhat was the Letwin amendment again?\n\nThe amendment says parliament will withhold approval of the prime minister\u2019s deal until the withdrawal bill implementing Brexit has been passed.\n\nThis could be tabled next week with a series of votes kicking off on Tuesday.\n\nThe Benn act set a deadline of 11pm on Saturday for Johnson to win parliamentary approval of his Brexit deal, or request a delay. He is now legally obliged to do that but has not given any details on how and is insisting he is not legally compelled to ask for an extension.\n\nInstead, the Conservative party said in a statement: \u201cParliament has voted to delay Brexit again. The Prime Minister will not ask for a delay \u2013 he will tell EU leaders there should be no more delays and we should get Brexit done on October 31st with our new deal so the country can move on.\u201d\n\nThe Letwin amendment was a way of trying to close a loophole, with some of its supporters fearing MPs could support the deal on Saturday, meeting the requirements of the Benn act, but then the legislation implementing Brexit could fall, allowing a no-deal exit on 31 October.\n\nWill the government push for a vote on its deal on Saturday?\n\nThe Conservatives believe the Brexit deal motion, as amended by Letwin and his colleagues, is no longer truly meaningful.\n\nThe Tories left the Commons and so there was no motion on Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal.\n\nIs article 50 extended?\n\nAccording to the terms of the Benn act, the government will have to request one \u2013 although Downing Street has in the past hinted it hoped to circumvent the legislation in some way. In theory, the EU27 could veto any request for a delay.\n\nHowever, the legislation makes clear that if the government does pass the EU withdrawal bill before 31 October, then any extension would lapse.\n\nHow did MPs vote on the amendment?\n\nThe majority of Labour, Liberal Democrat, Scottish National Party, Democratic Unionist party, Independent Group for Change, Plaid Cymru, and Green Party MPs and 17 other independents voted in favour, including the ex-Tories Amber Rudd and Antoinette Sandbach.\n\n\n\nEleven of the 21 former Tories, who were kicked out of the party for trying to block no deal, voted against it as well as the Labour MPs Kevin Barron, Kevin Barron, Jim Fitzpatrick, Caroline Flint, Kate Hoey and John Mann.\n\nWhen will the next votes be held?\n\nThe next opportunity is Monday, when the leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, said the government would seek to hold another meaningful vote on Johnson\u2019s deal. In a point of order, the MP Chris Bryant said it was not good practice for the government to repetitiously hold debates on the exact same subject.\n\nMonday\u2019s emergency business statement and motion are likely to disrupt the debate and votes already scheduled on the Queen\u2019s speech. The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, said he would have to consider whether to allow the government\u2019s plans.", "description": "Will Boris Johnson still try to get his deal through \u2013 and will he ask the EU for an extension?", "authors": ["Kate Proctor"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecc01ba825f8c7d32e346c4e79fb033bae749075/0_196_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2d89f693aec8fddd893f179bc7272454", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
