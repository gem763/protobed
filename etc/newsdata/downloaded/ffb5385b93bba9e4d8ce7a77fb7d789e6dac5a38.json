As a mayor, this matter of tenders is far away from me and there are many people involved, so it\u2019s not really one committee that decides.\u201d\n\nThat being the case, added Mashaba, even if he had \u201can evil mind or an evil intent\u201d, he would not be able to influence all these people, the majority of whom were ANC members, to award a tender to the EFF as a kickback.\n\nMaile and Mashaba have been at loggerheads for some time.\n\nIn August, while outlining the state of all 11 Gauteng municipalities, Maile said he would not be blackmailed by \u201cdrama queen\u201d Mashaba into placing the municipality under administration, despite having \u201cenough\u201d to do so.\n\nMashaba countered that Maile was not exercising his oversight powers in good faith.\n\n\u201cI find it alarming that you ran to the media regarding the allegations of tender irregularities surrounding the Afrinet contract prior to engaging with the city,\u201d Mashaba said.\n\nWhen approached for comment on the matter, Maile told City Press that he could not add more, as all he had to say had been laid out in a letter he had addressed to Mashaba and Mokgalapa.\n\nHowever, Mokgalapa\u2019s spokesperson, Omogolo Taunyane, told City Press that steps were being taken regarding issues of alleged corruption.\n\n\u201cThis was a claim made by Amabhungane and there\u2019s no evidence that there were indeed any dodgy dealings regarding the tender,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe will await the outcome from the city manager\u2019s office.\u201d\n\nMashaba accused the office of cooperative governance of being complicit in protecting \u201cthose found guilty of outward conduct\u201d, referring to an investigation into Johannesburg ANC leader Geoff Makhubo, who allegedly received millions of rands from the City of Johannesburg by acting as an influence broker. Makhubo has denied the allegation.\n\nREAD: Who\u2019s to blame for violence? The state, who neglected us, say hostel dwellers\n\nAsked to comment, EFF provincial leader Mandisa Mashego said she was not the national spokesperson.\n\nAttempts to get hold of the EFF member who did hold that position \u2013 Mbuyiseni Ndlozi \u2013 were unsuccessful.\n\nWhile Mashaba questioned Maile\u2019s motives for the allegations, Mokgalapa said that his department would look into the matter and comply with Maile\u2019s request.\n\nThe Tshwane mayor said that relevant actions would be taken should there be any illegality in the supply chain management and procurement principles.\n\nMaile had threatened to conduct a full-scale investigation, which could include approaching the Special Investigating Unit to look into tender irregularities in the Johannesburg and Pretoria metrosif they failed to give an adequate response to the corruption allegations.", "description": "The war of words and acrimonious accusations between the Johannesburg mayor and the Gauteng MEC for Cogta continue.", "authors": ["Mandisa Nyathi"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9440/10748aa7fa84491c85c3e2a5d7cb05ba.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
