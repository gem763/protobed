You know what I\u2019m talking about, right?\n\nIf you\u2019re jonesing for an upgrade, the good news is, now is a really good time to bag a new one. The telcos have been flinging deals at us left, right and centre this month, so let\u2019s dive on into the best of the bunch.\n\nBest deals for the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro\n\nOptus, the sly old dog, is up to its usual tricks. The telco is shelling out a cool 100GB of data with the new iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro on promo plans. (Try saying that three times fast.) The plans shown above are on a 36-month contract, which means your wallet takes less of a hit every month.\n\nHere are some more plans for the iPhone 11. Some will go for 24 months and some will go for 36 months:\n\nAnd here are some more plans for the iPhone 11 Pro. Again, some will go for 24 months and some will go for 36 months:\n\nBest deals for the Samsung Galaxy S10\n\nYet again, another promo plan from Optus is dishing out an insane amount of data \u2013 80GB for $79 per month on a 36-month contract. But Telstra has got a tempting offer too \u2013 $288 off the Samsung Galaxy S10 over the life of any plans, including this 36-month plan.\n\nAnd whether you choose Optus or Telstra, or even Vodafone for your S10 plan, you\u2019ll score a bonus pair of Galaxy Buds valued at $249. Not too shabby, guys.\n\nHere are some more plans for the Samsung Galaxy S10. Some will go for 24 months and some will go for 36 months:\n\nBest deals for the Google Pixel 4\n\nThe Pixel 4 is so hot off the presses at the Google factory that you can\u2019t get one in your hands just yet, but it is available for pre-order and can be found in the wild from Thursday 24 October.\n\nOptus has got its 100GB promo offer running on so many phone plans that, by now, you\u2019re probably sick of hearing about it, which is why we\u2019ve thrown in this deal from Vodafone as well. For $74.13 per month over 36 months, you\u2019ll get a Google Pixel 4 plus 30GB of data. And if you chew through all of that before the end of the month, Vodafone will give you unlimited data to use \u2013 it\u2019ll just be slow data. But hey, better than no data, right?\n\nBoth plans come with bonus tech because apparently that\u2019s just a thing that happens now when new phones come out. Choose the Optus plan and you\u2019ll get a bonus Harman/Kardon Citation ONE Bluetooth speaker valued at $299. Choose the Vodafone plan and get a bonus JBL Link 10 Wireless Portable Speaker valued at $229.\n\nHere are some more pre-order plans for the Google Pixel 4. Some will go for 24 months and some will go for 36 months:\n\nREAD MORE The Google Pixel 4 Has Arrived With One Less Camera Than The iPhone 11 Pro\n\nJacqui Dent is Associate Editor at WhistleOut and Reviews.org.
