Take for instance, the \u2018Mimic Octopus\u2019, a creature that pushes the boundaries of deception by impersonating other animals. It not only changes its colour and texture, but can mimic 15 different species such as jellyfish, sea snakes, and other fish. Unwitting prey drift right past the predator and end up becoming the octopus\u2019 next meal. A similar tactic deployed in the digital world by cyber predators uses your personal information to pretend to be you, to commit fraud or to gain financial benefits. Like the Mimic Octopus assumes another identity, identity thieves follow a similar modus operandi.\n\nIdentity theft, the most pervasive of cyber crimes, is executed by illegally obtaining someone\u2019s personally identifiable information like name, contact number, Aadhaar number or credit card number to impersonate the victim. Identity thieves can use this stolen information to pose as the victim for financial benefits or commit crimes. For cyber criminals, your personal data is as good as a gold mine. Your name, phone number, email ID and passwords can allow them to wreak havoc on your financial status, credit health, medical records and even tarnish your job prospects.\n\nIdentity theft can occur irrespective of the victim being alive or dead. While some of them are easy to detect, others have over the years, become increasingly sophisticated and targeted in nature. Imagine being informed that you\u2019ve exhausted your credit limit and the last date to pay the dues was approaching, when you don\u2019t even own a credit card! Such incidents of victims being duped are all over the news just about every day.\n\nYou could be next\n\nNew techniques for carrying out identity frauds emerged as a result of society\u2019s growing use and dependence on the internet. Phishing being the most common method, it usually occurs when a fraudulent e-mail (often spam), is used to direct a potential victim to a site that mimics the appearance of a familiar bank or an e-commerce site. The user is then asked to \u2018update\u2019 or \u2018confirm\u2019 an account, thereby unsuspectingly divulging confidential information.\n\nAnother popular scheme is SMiShing, where the fraudster sends text messages, posing as a financial institution or other legitimate entity. The text message displays a sense of urgency, coaxing to believe that you will suffer financial losses or other implications if there is no response, eventually driving you to disclose personal information.\n\nViruses, spyware, and malware can be used to track online activities, gain entry to user\u2019s hard drives and crack security vulnerabilities in software programs, to access personal data. Once your personal information is secured by the hacker who placed the spyware on your device, they can steal money, open credit card and bank accounts masquerading as you, or sell your credentials to parties who use it for illicit purposes.\n\nAs widespread data breaches continue to make headlines, people move from being a \u2018data breach victim\u2019 to an \u2018identity theft victim\u2019. However, as consumers are becoming more vigilant around security and privacy, the focus on stronger consumer privacy has sparked newer and stricter regulations worldwide. Despite this, identity theft cases continue to increase as identity thieves are more skilled at their craft than ever. The worrying situation is that most identity theft victims are often completely unaware of the fraud, until long after the incident.\n\nRefuse to be a victim\n\nWe all tend to be lethargic when it comes to security and that puts us at risk. We fall into the trap of assuming \u2018This will never happen to me\u2019. You may not realize that someone has misused your information until you see a mysterious charge on your credit card or receive an unanticipated debt collection call or notice that your credit score has tanked. To avoid this, read credit card and bank statements and make sure you recognize every transaction, no matter how small. Sign up for account alerts everywhere. Text messages and emails about account activity are the best way to detect suspicious activity as early as possible.\n\nWith the rise of social media and the staggering amount of data available about people, identity fraud will continue to be a threat. Past breaches have exposed the vulnerability of the systems that guard the confidential information we so casually hand over to companies and service providers. It is advisable to limit the personal information you share on social media. Fraudsters are well-connected and remarkably resourced individuals, who will only get smarter and more efficient. People need to err on the side of caution, be vigilant of the information they publicly share and never take the security of personal data for granted. You need to be wiser and know that there is nothing wrong in being sceptical. In the world that we live in, if you make it easy for someone to steal from you, they will.
