It seems like they\u2019ve run out of good ideas for shows. They\u2019re going to the well.\"\n\nWhen he was asked point-blank by the hosts if he would do it, Johnson coyly said, \u201cmaybe...\u201d\n\nThe original series, known for its distinctly 80\u2019s fashion, aired on NBC from 1984 to 1989, and starred Johnson as Detective James Crockett and Philip Michael Thomas as Detective Ricardo Tubbs.\n\n\u201cMiami Vice\u201d was innovative in many ways, starting with its unprecedented $1.3 million-per-episode to produce \u2013 by comparison an average hourly show cost $800K to produce. Its music score led it to become the first television show to be produced in stereo. Advertising was very expensive during its run, as it cost $150,000 to $200,00 for a 30-second commercial.\n\nThis franchise has already been rebooted once, with the 2006 movie remake that starred Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx. That production had a budget\u200e of \u200e$135 million but only took in \u200e$163.8 million.\n\n\"Maybe...\u201d - Don Johnson when asked about being open to \"Miami Vice\" revival\n\nThere also were discussions of a new television remake a couple years ago from the team behind the \u201cThe Fast and the Furious\u201d franchise. Vin Diesel\u2019s production company, One Race Television, teamed up with Chris Morgan Productions on the project, but it is no longer in development.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nIt made sense that a team known for an a race car movie (and its unending sequels) would want to revive a show that was identified by its cars. At the end of 2014, one of the two 1986 Ferrari Testarossas used in the third, fourth and fifth seasons of the TV series \u201cMiami Vice\u201d was up for sale on eBay for a cool $1,750,000.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the only thing you could get from the show on eBay. The real boat from the show - the 38-foot Wellcraft Scarab KV \u2013 was on the auction website earlier this year with a Buy-It-Now price of $20 million. The buyer will also receive Ferrari Daytona replica \u2013 the last one built for the show. While this replica built for the show is priceless, by comparison, a real Ferarri Daytona Spyder could easily grab $1 million by itself, but this is replica was built specifically for the show.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX BUSINESS\n\nOne thing that can be bought much cheaper to be ready for the show\u2019s revival are bright colored sports coats and t-shirts to look just like Crockett and Tubbs.", "description": "Don Johnson tips off that \"Miami Vice\" could be next classic 80's series to come back.", "authors": ["Jason Schott"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/Miami-Vice-Crockett-and-Tubbs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
