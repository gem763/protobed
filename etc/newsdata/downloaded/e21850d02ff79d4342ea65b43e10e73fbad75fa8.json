You really couldn't ask for any better.\"\n\nThanks to the exposure, Black Mermaid quickly became her most-streamed song, generating 1.3m plays on Spotify alone.\n\nBut Esthero says it generated less than $5,000 (\u00a34,031) in royalties. When she compared that to the potential income of a million downloads, \"I just sort of got angry\".\n\nInitially, she considered pulling her music down altogether, but then she came up with a cunning plan: Edit the streaming version, so it acts like a \"trailer\" for the full song, and use it to expose \"the fact that the pay is so little\" on streaming sites.\n\n\"I thought, 'I should have a little V for Vendetta moment and tell people what's going on,'\" she said.\n\nThe protest has already picked up support from artists like Nitin Sawhney and chairman of the Ivors Academy Crispin Hunt, who encouraged people to \"smash [the song] into the charts\".\n\n\"I'm really glad that she's brought attention to this,\" said Helienne Lindval, who chairs the British Songwriters Committee.\n\n\"To make the same amount of money you make from a download, the person who's listening to the track would have to listen to it 200 or 300 times, sometimes even more than that.\n\n\"It's something that's affected us so much that people are leaving the industry and artists are finding it hard to survive [even if] they have a lot of fans.\"\n\nGeneric music\n\nLindval added that the financial situation had had a detrimental effect on creativity.\n\n\"Because of the streaming economy, it is better to make music that is very broad, that is liked by as many people as possible,\" she explained. \"So what you get is a more generic and streamlined output of music.\"\n\nEsthero said fans had been \"extremely supportive\" and \"understanding\" about her protest.\n\n\"I think we underestimate the empathy of the audience. If you give people an opportunity to support [you], they will do it.\"\n\nShe was unsure whether Spotify had noticed her protest, but \"I'm assuming they're going to catch me and take it down\" eventually.\n\nThe BBC contacted Spotify, which declined to comment on this story.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
