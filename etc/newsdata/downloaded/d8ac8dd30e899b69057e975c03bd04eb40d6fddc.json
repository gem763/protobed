Local concept store in New York earlier this month.\n\nThe numbers: The University of Michigan said its consumer-sentiment index rebounded modestly in September to a reading of 92 from a three-year low of 89.8 in late August. This is still below the July reading of 98.4.\n\nEconomists polled by MarketWatch expected a rebound to 91.4.\n\nWhat happened: The current conditions index rose to 106.9 in September from 105.3 in the prior month. The index of expectations rose to 82.4 from 79.9 in August. But the rebound was not widespread. Concerns about the impact of tariffs were higher. \u201cWhile a recession is not anticipated in the year ahead, neither is a resurgence in personal consumption,\u201d said Richard Curtin, chief economist of the UMich survey.\n\nIn data that is important for the Fed, consumer inflation expectations dropped in September. Over the next five-ten years, consumers see inflation running at a 2.3% rate, down from 2.6% in August and matching an all-time low for the series.\n\nThe big picture: Economists expected sentiment to improve from its late August reading given the rally in equities. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.18% is up 3.2% since Labor Day. This is still the third lowest level of sentiment since President Donald Trump\u2019s election.\n\nWhat are they saying? \u201cThe trend is softening. Blame the trade war,\u201d said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.\n\nMarket reaction: U.S. stocks moved higher in mid-day trading on Friday putting the Dow and the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.07% within reach of records.", "description": "The University of Michigan said its consumer-sentiment index rebounded in September to a reading of 92 from a three-year low of 89.8 in August.", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR243_shoppi_ZG_20190913084909.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
