The National Women\u2019s Soccer League does not have a fan code of conduct but agreed with its partner club, the Portland Timbers, to ban political signage at Thorns games.\n\n\u201cAll of our operational staff for Providence Park games are the same,\u201d the club said in a statement in August. \u201cHaving different rules for different teams creates confusion among staff and for fans alike. We also believe that what is allowed, for those wishing to trumpet opposition to fascism at MLS games, is also a fair and reasonable approach for Thorns and T2 games.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Thorns lost the match, 6-0.", "description": "Fans at a National Women\u2019s Soccer League game rained down boos during a U.S. Armed Forces swearing-in ceremony Wednesday after the members were asked to pledge they would obey the orders of President Trump.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News.
