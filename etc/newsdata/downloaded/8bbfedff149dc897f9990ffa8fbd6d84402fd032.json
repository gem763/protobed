Trump has said in recent weeks that China may be holding off on reaching a trade deal, betting that he will not be re-elected next year.\n\nShanghai was down 0.2 percent and Hong Kong fell on opening but later recovered, after one of the most violent weekends the semi-autonomous city has seen in a summer of unrest.\n\nPro-democracy protesters in the financial hub are hoping to disrupt Beijing's celebrations on Tuesday with further mass rallies.\n\nTokyo slumped by 0.5 percent, with analysts saying stocks were weighed down by losses in the US market. Sydney and Seoul were up but Jakarta and Singapore also saw declines.\n\n\"Asia is refusing to bite on the Trump threats to delist Chinese companies on US exchanges that came out on Friday and saw Wall Street finish in the red,\" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at OANDA.\n\n\"In China's case, ahead of the 70th birthday celebrations tomorrow, 'officialdom' is likely to ensure that Mainland indices finish the day flat at worst,\" he added.\n\n- Key figures around 0315 GMT -\n\nHong Kong - Hang Seng: UP 0.2 percent at 25,997.87\n\nShanghai - Composite: DOWN 0.2 percent at 2,927.049\n\nTokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 0.5 percent at 21,780.20 (break)\n\nLondon - FTSE 100: UP 1.0 percent at 7,426.21 (close)\n\nNew York - Dow: DOWN 0.3 percent at 26,820.25 (close)\n\nEuro/dollar: DOWN at $1.0932 from $1.0941 at 2030 GMT\n\nPound/dollar: DOWN at $1.2287 from $1.2293\n\nEuro/pound: DOWN at 88.97 pence from 89.01 pence\n\nDollar/yen: DOWN at 107.92 yen from 107.95\n\nBrent North Sea crude: UP 3 cents at $61.94 per barrel\n\nWest Texas Intermediate: UP 12 cents at $56.03 per barrel", "description": "Asian markets had a mixed start on Monday as Beijing posted manufacturing data that was better than expected, but investors remained cautious ahead of a week-long patriotic holiday in China and after reports last week raised fears of a fresh escalation in its trade war with the US.
