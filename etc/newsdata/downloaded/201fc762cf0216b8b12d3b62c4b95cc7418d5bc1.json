A lot of them.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t say anything to me because I would have old them to go and f*** themselves, but I saw it towards my friends.\u201d\n\nAlves famously took a bite out of a banana thrown at him while playing for Villarreal.\n\nHe later said: \"We have suffered this in Spain for some time. You have to take it with a dose of humour. We aren't going to change things easily. If you don't give it importance, they don't achieve their objective.\u201d\n\nAlves has also played for Sevilla and Barcelona over the course of his illustrious career, and said he preferred those cities over Paris.\n\n\u201cThe people there look Brazilian, live out on the street and have a cool energy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re very up front, but I prefer people to be like that than the opposite.\u201d", "description": "The Brazilian won back-to-back Ligue 1 titles with PSG - but said his time in Paris was \"stressful\"", "authors": ["James Whaling", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20593779.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_DMP_CHP_1610192357AlvesJPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
