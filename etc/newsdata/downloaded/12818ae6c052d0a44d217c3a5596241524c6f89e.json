Bullard said he was worried that the odds of a recession are rising.\n\nRead: Fed\u2019s Bullard: Dissent was due in part to worries about slowing economy\n\nBut Rosengren was less worried about the outlook. In a statement, he said the level of interest rates is already \u201caccommodative.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile risks clearly exist related to trade and geopolitical concerns, lowering rates to address uncertainty is not costless,\u201d Rosengren said.\n\n\u201cAdditional monetary stimulus is not needed for an economy where labor markets are already tight, and risks further inflating the prices of risky assets and encouraging households and firms to take on too much leverage,\u201d he added.\n\nIn a speech later Friday at New York University, Rosengren said pushing rates lower when asset prices seem inflation might not cause a downturn, \u201cbut such conditions have the potential to amplify a downturn, should it occur.\u201d\n\nLow interest rates are encouraging a steady rise in leverage in underwritten riskier debt, Rosengren says\n\nThe Fed voted 7-3 to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter-point. That was the most no votes at a single meeting since 2016.\n\nThe division on the Fed is making it less clear what the Fed will do next.\n\nFed Chairman Jerome Powell said the Fed was not sure of the path ahead. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be looking carefully meeting by meeting at the full range of information,\u201d he said.\n\nSeven of the 17 officials are calling for another cut this year, according to the Fed\u2019s latest \u201cdot-plot\u201d projections of interest rates. Many of these dots belong to voting members of the interest-rate committee, said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nStocks DJIA, -0.59% SPX, -0.49% closed lower after investors grew concerned about the latest talks between U.S. and China seeking an end to the on-going trade war.\n\nIn an interview later Friday, Powell\u2019s number two Richard Clarida defended the Fed\u2019s decision to cut rates by a quarter point.\n\nRead: Fed\u2019s Clarida says U.S. economy is fine but global outlook is getting worse", "description": "Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren on Friday said he dissented because the rate cut could inflate asset prices further using more debt.", "authors": ["Greg Robb", "Senior Economics Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GP663_roseng_ZG_20180907072511.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
