Dre Brown's tackle-breaking 13-yard run got Illinois to the Wisconsin 25, setting up McCourt to attempt the winner. The junior's kick was down the middle to give coach Lovie Smith the most significant victory of his four-year tenure in Champaign.\n\nWisconsin had not trailed this season and was looking to roll into a showdown with No. 3 Ohio State next week in Columbus. Instead, the Badgers (6-1, 4-1) blew a nine-point lead in the final 9:46 of the fourth quarter.\n\nIllinois beat a ranked team for the first time since 2011 and knocked off a ranked Big Ten team for the first time since 2007, when it beat No. 1 Ohio State on the way to a Rose Bowl appearance.\n\nNO. 2 LSU 36, MISSISSIPPI STATE 13\n\nSTARKVILLE, Miss.

The sophomore settled down to hit Joseph Ngata and Justyn Ross with second-quarter touchdown passes for a 17-3 halftime lead.\n\nLawrence's 10-yard TD to Cornell Powell made it 31-3, and he finished 20 of 29 for 233 yards.\n\nThe Tigers also had six sacks and kept Louisville (4-3, 2-2) out of the end zone until Javian Hawkins' late 3-yard run.\n\nNO. 5 OKLAHOMA 52, WEST VIRGINIA 14\n\nNORMAN, Okla.

(AP) \u2014 Kyle Trask threw a career-high four touchdown passes, three in the fourth quarter, to help Florida bounce back from its loss at LSU.\n\nThe Gators (7-1, 4-1 Southeastern Conference) slogged through a soggy field from Tropical Storm Nestor for much of the game.
