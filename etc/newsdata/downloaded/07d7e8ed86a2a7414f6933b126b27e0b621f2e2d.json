Line a medium (17 x 11-inch) rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.\n\nWhisk together the dry ingredients in the bowl of a stand mixer. Attach the bowl to the stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Add the butter and mix on low speed until the mixture resembles wet sand, about five to six minutes.\n\nWhisk together the remaining ingredients in a small bowl, then add them to the butter mixture and mix until just combined. Spread evenly onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake until golden, about 12-15 minutes. Cool completely, then cut into 24 two-inch rounds.\n\nRaspberry Cream Filling:\n\nMash together the raspberries and \u00bc cup of the jam in a small bowl with a fork. Beat in the cream, icing sugar, vanilla and salt in a large bowl with a hand mixer on high until stiff peaks form. Fold in the remaining raspberry jam. Spoon the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a medium star tip.\n\nMacerated Raspberry Fruit Filling:\n\nMash the raspberries together with the sugar. Stir together with a fork. Set aside. (As it sits the sugar will draw the juices out of the raspberries.)\n\nAssembly:\n\nTo assemble, place 12 cake rounds onto a serving platter and pipe cream around the border of each, leaving a half inch space in the centre.\n\nSpoon one tablespoon of macerated raspberry fruit filling into the centre. Top each with the remaining cake rounds, and repeat with cream and filling. Decorate with whole raspberries and edible flowers.
