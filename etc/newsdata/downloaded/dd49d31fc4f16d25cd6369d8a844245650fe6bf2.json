In contrast, the new iPhone 11 starts at $699. The 7T will be available from T-Mobile and directly from OnePlus.\n\nThese are relatively inexpensive prices from top-tier brands. The new iPhone 11 Pro, however, starts at $1099.\n\nThe OnePlus 7T, which will debut in stores on October 18, comes in blue and grey. The device, which runs on Android 10 released earlier this month, features three cameras on the back of the phone and a tool that allows for better shots in low light -- similar to Apple's new iPhone 11 and 11 Pro phones.\n\nOnePlus is one of several smartphone companies owned by BBK Electronics, a Chinese company that's extremely popular in Asia.
