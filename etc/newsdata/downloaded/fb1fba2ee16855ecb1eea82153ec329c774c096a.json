What the....?! Have complained! What eight-year-old needs to be paranoid about an 'uneven skin tone'.\"\n\nThe post sparked a huge reaction from fellow parents, gaining 2,700 retweets and more than 11,000 likes.\n\nOne said: \"That is genuinely shocking. I mean seriously. With the mental health crisis kids are facing they don\u2019t need this kind of message.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\n\"I love the fact my kids\u2019 school pictures are generally awful. Isn\u2019t that the whole point?\"\n\nA second wrote: \"Absolutely horrific. Is a school condoning this by using the company??\"\n\nAnother hinted that their own child's photo had been edited without their permission, saying: \"We got my daughter's school photo back when she was 6. She\u2019d been airbrushed! Looked like she had makeup on.\"\n\nOthers stuck up for the photographer, arguing: \"I had severe acne in middle school. I begged my mum to do the retouch every year and she finally gave in.\n\n\"That was my favorite school picture. So, no it's not needed for an 8 year old, but keep in mind, this company takes pictures of older kids too.\"", "description": "Sam Walker hit out at the school photo price list which offered options to 'remove blemishes and whiten teeth'", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Walkersam", "Twitter", "Getty Images Istockphoto"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20750475.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Sam-Walker.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
