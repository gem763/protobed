Over 900 people perished that day, more than a third of them children. As he lay dying of a bullet wound to the head\u2014a less painful way to go than cyanide and one that he probably orchestrated\u2014Jones told his followers that it was \u201call the media\u2019s fault. Don\u2019t believe them.\u201d\n\nThose words, uttered so long ago, sound disturbingly familiar as we approach the 41st anniversary of Jonestown. We have a president who regularly disparages and blames the media, calling it \u201cfake,\u201d \u201cfalse,\u201d and \u201cphony,\u201d and who calls journalists \u201cenemies of the people\u201d\u2014epithets that seem especially frenzied in the wake of the whistleblower complaint and the launching of the House impeachment inquiry. It might seem an outrageous proposition to compare Donald Trump to a murderous cult leader. And yet there are alarming parallels. Like Jones and other cult leaders, Trump exhibits features of what psychologist Eric Erickson called \u201cmalignant narcissism\u201d\u2014bombastic grandiosity, a bottomless need for praise, lack of empathy, pathological lying, apparent sadism, and paranoia. In short, he fits the stereotypical psychological profile of a cult leader.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s Rage Brings \u2018Civil War,\u2019 Where Will the Military Stand?\n\nI have seen that profile up close. Over 40 years ago, while a junior in college, I was recruited into a destructive mind control cult, the Unification Church, popularly known as the Moonies after its leader, Sun Myung Moon. I rose rapidly through the ranks and was invited to attend meetings with Moon and his top aides, where we knelt and bowed to our leader Moon. Two years later, after three days straight of leading a fundraising team\u2014selling flowers on street corners\u2014I fell asleep at the wheel and woke up as I plowed into the back of an 18 wheeler. Fortunately, I survived. My family hired deprogrammers and, after five days, I realized I had been brainwashed.\n\nSince then, I have devoted myself to studying mind control cults and helping families rescue loved ones from their clutches. I have learned that mind control is not a vague, mystical process but, instead, is the result of a concrete and specific and systematic set of methods and techniques. Cult leaders may seem crazy, but they are cunning masters of manipulation, employing an arsenal of these techniques to render their followers dependent and obedient. It\u2019s what I call the cult leader\u2019s playbook.\n\nAs I argue in my upcoming book, The Cult of Trump: A Leading Cult Expert Explains How The President Uses Mind Control (Simon & Schuster), Trump has gotten where he is today in large part because he has exploited tactics straight out of that playbook. These include his grandiose claims, his practice of sowing confusion, his demand for absolute loyalty, his tendency to lie and create alternative \u201cfacts\u201d and realities, his shunning and belittling of critics and ex-believers, and his cultivating of an \u201cus versus them\u201d mindset. These are the same methods used by Moon, Jones, and other cult leaders such as L. Ron Hubbard (Scientology), David Koresh (Branch Davidians), Lyndon LaRouche (LaRouche PAC), and, most recently, convicted trafficking felon Keith Raniere (NXVIM).\n\nOf all these tactics, the \u201cus versus them\u201d mindset is probably one of the most effective. From the moment you are recruited into a cult, you are made to feel special, part of an \u201cinside\u201d group in opposition to unenlightened, unbelieving, dangerous \u201coutsiders.\u201d Playing on ancient human tribal tendencies, cult leaders extend this \u201cus versus them\u201d mindset outwards to an almost cosmic struggle.\n\nMany campaigns\u2014political, military, athletic\u2014pivot around the idea of conflict between parties. Even in literature there is a hero and a villain. But cults take this human habit of viewing the world in binary terms and infuse it with a kind of all consuming passion, which they reinforce in the minds of followers using cliches, platitudes, lies, and endless repetitions. You come to believe that you are superior to the rest of the world. In fact, everyone who is not in the group is, at some level, in the words of the eminent psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton, dispensable.", "description": "Jim Watson/GettyOn the afternoon of Nov. 18, 1978, Jim Jones called his followers to the central pavilion of Jonestown, a sprawling outpost in the jungles of Guyana, and ordered them to drink a lethal mixture of cyanide and fruit punch.
