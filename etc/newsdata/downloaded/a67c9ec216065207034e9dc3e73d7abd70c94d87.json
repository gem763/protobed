Nah, I'll just do my job and that's all I'll focus on.\"\n\nRead will captain the All Blacks for the 52nd and last time, overtaking former hooker Sean Fitzpatrick in second place on the all-time list behind Richie McCaw.\n\nBut he admitted to still being haunted by his side's failure to repel a rampaging England in Saturday's blockbuster semi-final ahead of a fixture against Wales the All Blacks could largely do without.\n\n\"It's been a weird few days,\" he said after New Zealand's first World Cup loss in 12 years.\n\n\"It does require a bit of strength, knowing it's the game we didn't want to be in. We're hurting and will be hurting for a long time to come.\"\n\nRead acknowledged he would have mixed emotions this week but insisted the time had come to step down after what will be his 127th appearance in the famous black jersey.\n\n\"I'm ready to leave,\" he smiled.\n\n\"I've had my time in the jersey and it's time for someone else to step in. It's hard but I've known for a couple of years - the mind is willing but the body is saying 'I can't do this anymore'.\n\n\"It's been a rollercoaster over the last few days but I've loved every minute,\" added Read.\n\n\"It's my last week to be with these men I call good mates. I just want to go out and enjoy the time with those blokes.\"\n\nAll Blacks coach Steve Hansen will also move on after Friday's game after compiling a win record of more than 90 percent over seven years, and Read paid tribute to his boss.\n\n\"He pushed me to better myself as a player,\" he said. \"He's a world-class operator and is what this team represents.\"\n\nRead tipped New Zealand to bounce back from their experience in Japan.\n\n\"The group of men we've got are so committed to the All Blacks,\" he said.\n\n\"They know what it means to be an All Black - I think we're in good hands.\"\n\nKick-off is at 11:00 (SA time) on Friday.\n\nTeams:\n\nWales\n\n15 Hallam Amos, 14 Owen Lane, 13 Jonathan Davies, 12 Owen Watkin, 11 Josh Adams, 10 Rhys Patchell, 9 Tomos Williams, 8 Ross Moriarty, 7 James Davies, 6 Justin Tipuric, 5 Alun Wyn Jones (captain), 4 Adam Beard, 3 Dillon Lewis, 2 Ken Owens, 1 Nicky Smith\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Elliot Dee, 17 Rhys Carre, 18 Wyn Jones, 19 Jake Ball, 20 Aaron Shingler, 21 Gareth Davies, 22 Dan Biggar, 23 Hadleigh Parkes\n\nNew Zealand\n\n15 Beauden Barrett, 14 Ben Smith, 13 Ryan Crotty, 12 Sonny Bill Williams, 11 Rieko Ioane, 10 Richie Mo'unga, 9 Aaron Smith, 8 Kieran Read (captain), 7 Sam Cane, 6 Shannon Frizell, 5 Scott Barrett, 4 Brodie Retallick, 3 Nepo Laulala, 2 Dane Coles, 1 Joe Moody\n\nSubstitutes: 16 Liam Coltman, 17 Atu Moli, 18 Angus Ta'avao, 19 Patrick Tuipulotu, 20 Matt Todd, 21 Brad Weber, 22 Anton Lienert-Brown, 23 Jordie Barrett", "description": "New Zealand legend Kieran Read wants to sign off with a drop goal when he leads out the All Blacks for the last time - but fears his leg might fall off.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5965/dcc8eda5efc34019ae4682b54f6a3ae0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
