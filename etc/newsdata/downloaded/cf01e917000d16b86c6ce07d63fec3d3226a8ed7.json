This period, which is within living memory for many people, has seen accelerated melt in Southeast Iceland.'\n\nVatnaj\u00f6kull ice cap, which covers an area of 2973 squared miles (7,700 kilometres squared), has lowered by around 66 feet (20 metres) on average in the last 30 years.\n\nThe height of the outlet glaciers pictured in the image comparisons has dropped even more, up to 328 to 492 feet (100 to 150 metres) in some areas.\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a The height of the outlet glaciers pictured in the image comparisons has dropped even more, up to 328 to 492 feet (100 to 150 metres) in some areas\n\nThe glacier ice margins are now retreating hundreds of feet every year with the area of the icecap reduced by over 159 square feet since the turn of the century.\n\nDr Baxter added: 'While we have a fantastic resource of mapping photographs from the 1980s, this method can also be applied to aerial photographs that are even older.\n\n'The archives are huge and we have barely scratched the surface in terms of using them to better show how the warming climate is revealed in our landscapes.'\n\nThe images produced by Dr Baxter were shared by the Icelandic Meteorological Office to coincide with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 'Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate'. It is hoped that they will help promote public outreach for climate science and glaciology in Iceland.\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a The images produced by Dr Baxter were shared by the Icelandic Meteorological Office to raise awareness of the speed at which the icecaps are melting\n\nDr Thorvardur Arnason, Director of the University of Iceland's Hornafjordur Research Centre, said: 'Dr. Baxter's highly innovative work adds new dimensions both to the monitoring of glacier recession and to the communication of the severe impacts caused by catastrophic climate change on sensitive environments.\n\n'The development of such novel vehicles for public outreach - where science and art essentially share a common platform - is of great importance in our attempts to understand and address the unprecedented scale, diversity and complexity of the ongoing climate crisis.'\n\nRecently, Dr Baxter's photogrammetry has also revealed the shrinking glaciers of Mont Blanc, Europe's tallest peak \u2013 by comparing aerial photographs taken 100 years apart.\n\nA drone flies over Vatnaj\u00f6kull, Iceland taking aerial shots of the glacier and melted-ice for scientists to compare to older photos", "description": "Scientists from the University of Dundee compared modern aerial shots of Vatnaj\u00f6kull, Iceland to 1980's surveys photos showing the dramatic loss of ice and reality of climate change.", "authors": ["Milly Vincent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/14/20181978-0-image-a-53_1572011868857.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
