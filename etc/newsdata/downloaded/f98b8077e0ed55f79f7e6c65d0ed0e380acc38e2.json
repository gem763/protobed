He claimed the whistleblower reported \"things that were incorrect\" about his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, even though the complaint largely tracked with the contents of a rough transcript subsequently released by the White House.\n\nIn other tweets Tuesday he said, \"So if the so-called \u201cWhistleblower\u201d has all second hand information, and almost everything he has said about my \u201cperfect\u201d call with the Ukrainian President is wrong (much to the embarrassment of Pelosi & Schiff), why aren\u2019t we entitled to interview & learn everything about .... the Whistleblower, and also the person who gave all of the false information to him.\"\n\nThe president has also repeatedly claimed the whistleblower was a political partisan. While the intelligence community's inspector general did find that there were some indications the whistleblower had \"arguable political bias... in favor of a rival candidate,\" the inspector general also said that the revelation did not change his assessment that the complaint appeared credible.\n\nAndrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nAs Trump keeps hitting the whistleblower -- who enjoys legal protection under whistleblower laws and wants to remain anonymous -- Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, defended the person, whose identity has not been made public.\n\n\"No one should be making judgments or pronouncements without hearing from the whistleblower first and carefully following up on the facts. Uninformed speculation wielded by politicians or media commentators as a partisan weapon is counterproductive and doesn\u2019t serve the country,\" Grassley said in a statement.\n\nTrump's rhetoric has rapidly escalated as Democrats in the House push forward with their inquiry.\n\nOn Sunday, he tweeted paraphrased Pastor Robert Jeffress, a conservative commentator speaking on \"Fox and Friends,\" saying, \"If the Democrats are successful in removing the President from office (which they will never be), it will cause a Civil War like fracture in this Nation from which our Country will never heal.\"\n\nHis invocation of a possible \"Civil War\" drew fierce blowback from Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., who tweeted: \"I have visited nations ravaged by civil war. @realDonaldTrump I have never imagined such a quote to be repeated by a President. This is beyond repugnant.\"\n\nIt was not the first time Trump connected impeachment with political conflict. In December, he told Reuters \"the people would revolt\" if he were impeached.", "description": "President Donald Trump has tweeted that he now regards the Democratic impeachment probe as a", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/trump-4-gty-er-190930_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
