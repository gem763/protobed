In the last 20 of the first and in the first 20 of the second we didn\u2019t really control the game and we got punished for that.\u201d\n\nUnited recorded 21 attempts on goal and pushed for a winner in the closing stages when Southampton were reduced to 10 men after Kevin Danso was sent off.\n\nMaguire said United must take their opportunities in front of goal if they are to keep up with their top four rivals.\n\n\u201cIt was another game where we deserved to win created the majority of the chances and we\u2019ve dropped two points,\u201d Maguire added. \u201cThe start of our season has been a bit like that.\n\n\u201cWith our performances we warrant more points but it will come, we will keep working hard and keep improving.\u201d", "description": "Manchester United's record signing Harry Maguire wants his team mates to control games and rediscover their swagger after they dropped points in the Premier League for the third game in succession at Southampton.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190902&t=2&i=1425286351&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF810DG"}
