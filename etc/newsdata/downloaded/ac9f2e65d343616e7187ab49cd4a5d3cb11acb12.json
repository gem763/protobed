She accused him of overstepping his authority by acting as the prosecutor himself.\n\nVideo: \u2018Straight Pride\u2019 Organizer Accidentally Calls Org \u2018Racist\u2019\n\n\u201cThe actions of Judge Richard Sinnott are unprecedented and outrageous,\" Rollins said. \"His insistence on arraigning individuals when my office has used its discretion to decline a case is an unconstitutional abuse of his power and serves neither the interests of justice nor public safety. The power to pursue prosecution falls exclusively on the executive branch, not the judiciary.\"\n\nBoston Police officers arrest an anti-parade demonstrator during the More\n\nThe controversial Straight Pride Parade, organized by three conservative straight men, attracted between 200 and 300 marchers but many more counter protesters, including people who identify with the anti-fascist group antifa.\n\nThey shouted \"Nazi scum!\" at the marchers, jeered and heckled them throughout the mile-long parade, and confronted the extraordinary number of police who worked to separate the two sides. Most of the arrests happened after the rally as police tried to disperse the crowd of counter protesters to reopen streets.\n\nMore: Boston's Straight Pride Parade draws hundreds of marchers and even more counter protesters\n\nSuffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins More\n\nDuring a wild day in court Tuesday, the judge agreed to drop charges against only two of 16 counter protesters who appeared before him, denying the prosecution's requests one after another. He decided to drop seven more on Wednesday, at the request of prosecutors, and delay the arraignments of an additional five, the Boston Globe reported.\n\nBut it turned contentious, the Globe reported, when Sinnott ordered the removal of a prominent immigration attorney, Susan Church, who was arguing on the behalf of one of the arrested counter protesters. He said Church interrupted him. She was placed in handcuffs and taken into custody, but was released three hours later without being charged.", "description": "The Boston DA's decision to drop charges against left-wing protesters arrested at a Straight Pride Parade has turned into a courtroom fight.", "authors": ["Joey Garrison", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4Vjytdgcszl6eeNWzRxZaQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/4c42ae1e623f0f368f02cbb0e0a6238f", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
