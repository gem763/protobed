Maxwell laughed, as the commentators celebrated his genius prediction.\n\n'He looked a little bit slow off the mark there, so I had to go keeper\u2019s end.'\n\nHoward praised Maxwell's 'bullet arm,' while Guha called his fielding 'sensational.'\n\n'What\u2019s so good about that is he\u2019s talking to us, so he\u2019s literally having to get himself ready to field,' Guha said.\n\n'He\u2019s trained so much in the outfield, he\u2019s fielded so much in that region that it is just second nature.'\n\nMaxwell contributed with more than just his fielding in the match, launching a rapid fire 62 from 28 balls at the close of Australia's innings, including three sixes.\n\nAustralia's total of 233 proved to be too much for Sri Lanka, who were bowled out for 99 in Adelaide.", "description": "Australian cricketer Glenn Maxwell has predicted an incredible run out while commentating on the field during Australia's first T20 international against Sri Lanka.", "authors": ["Jackson Barron For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/08/20237836-0-image-a-9_1572166673594.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
