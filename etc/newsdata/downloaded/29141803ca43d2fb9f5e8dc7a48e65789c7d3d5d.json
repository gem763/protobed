A review by Reuters news agency in June found that stakes in US oil firms ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Hess (HES.N) would likely be sold, however.\n\nSweden's Lundin Petroleum (LUPE.ST) was also at risk of divestment, the company has said.\n\nNorway's majority ownership of Oslo-listed oil firm Equinor (EQNR.OL), which is held independently from the fund, was not subject to review.\n\nNorway has said the decision is to reduce the exposure of the country's wealth to the risk of a permanent drop in oil prices, but environmental campaigners have seized on it as an example of an investor turning away from the oil industry.\n\nThe divestments would take place gradually and over time, the ministry said.", "description": "The central bank called for the move as a way to protect the country if oil prices fall.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/2/4b77600a863840de8573f853f458e3f0_18.jpg"}
