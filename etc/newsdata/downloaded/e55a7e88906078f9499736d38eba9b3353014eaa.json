Because the more laws or bills that doesn't make sense that they have to put forward you see what happened three months ago. More and more people will be coming out and step out to fight for their freedom and freedom of speech.\"The ban followed a violent rally in the city on China's National Day which resulted in a teenager being shot by a police officer.Pro-democracy lawmakers in Hong Kong condemned Lam's decision to call upon the use of emergency powers, calling it a \"totalitarian tactic\".They warned that enforcing the law would only fuel the public's anger.Hong Yoo, Arirang News.", "description": "\ud55c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubc29\uc1a1!
