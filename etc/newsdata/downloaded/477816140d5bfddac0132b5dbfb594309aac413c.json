Nothing is made explicit here, but it starts to set new expectations about the coming course of policy for 2020.\u201d\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un rides a horse during snowfall in Mount Paektu in this image released by North Korea's Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) on October 16, 2019. KCNA via REUTERS\n\nMISSILES\n\nOne possibility could be resuming tests of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of hitting the U.S. mainland, which the North has not fired since it began denuclearisation talks with the United States last year, experts say.\n\nPyongyang warned it might lift \u201cpreemptive measures\u201d it had taken to build confidence with Washington, after a fresh round of their negotiations fell apart last week in Stockholm.\n\nIn late 2017, Kim visited Mt Paektu days after North Korea launched its largest ICBM, and weeks before he made a key New Year\u2019s speech in which he opened the door to engagement with South Korea.\n\nLast year, Kim took South Korean President Moon Jae-in to the top of the mountain as part of a historic summit.\n\nSince then relations have cooled and Kim has said he will only wait until the end of the year for the United States to soften its stance in denuclearisation negotiations before North Korea will pursue an unspecified new path forward.\n\nSeveral experts also said much of the rhetoric in the KCNA reports revolves around the economy, and they suspect North Korea may soon conduct a space launch. That would enable the North to show of its economic and technological power in a less provocative way than by testing an ICBM.\n\nDuring a separate visit to the nearby alpine town of Samjiyon where North Korea is building a massive economic and residential hub, Kim accused \u201cU.S.-led hostile forces\u201d of \u201ctrying to strangle us with the chain of pressure\u201d.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\n\u201cThe situation of the country is difficult owing to the ceaseless sanctions and pressure by the hostile forces and there are many hardships and trials facing us,\u201d Kim said, according to KCNA.\n\nThe language in Wednesday\u2019s state media report suggests Kim may be \u201ccontemplating some major policy decisions\u201d, said Rachel Minyoung Lee, an analyst with NK News, a website that monitors North Korea.\n\n\u201cThe report in Korean has characterised Kim\u2019s climb up to Mt Paektu on horseback as a new \u2018myth\u2019, and that, together with the images of him on a white horse, appear to have been designed to create maximum propaganda effect, which I believe media will play up in the days to come,\u201d Lee said.", "description": "Aides to Kim Jong Un are convinced the North Korean leader plans \"a great operation\", state media said on Wednesday in a report that included lavish descriptions and images of the leader riding a white horse up North Korea's most sacred mountain.", "authors": ["Josh Smith", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441339149&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F075", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
