A newly-published book, featuring the first-ever interview with the man driving the white Fiat Uno that clipped Di's car before her fatal 1997 car crash in Paris, claims to be \"the definitive account and evidence that proves what really happened\" 22 years ago.\n\nIn \"Diana: Case Solved\" by journalist Dylan Howard and former homicide cop Colin McLaren, out now via Skyhorse Publishing and Start Publishing, the co-authors sit down with Le Van Thanh for his first-ever interview on the subject, despite multiple requests over the years to share what he knows from that fateful night.\n\nBelow is an exclusive excerpt from the final chapter of \"Diana: Case Solved,\" available only on AOL. To get the full story and read all that Le Van Than has to say, order the book here.\n\n\n\nDiana: Case Solved, $22.49\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I let them think what they want.\u201d\n\n\n\nOf all the words spoken by Le Van Thanh during our confrontation with him, these are the ones that most haunt me personally.\n\n\n\nVan Thanh knows he is a pawn. He knows that there are powerful forces capable of destroying his life. And he is not insane.\n\n\n\nIn this simple line quoted above, Le Van Thanh is telling us that he cannot do other than what he has done. He must allow the public to believe what they will, because the alternative is unthinkably dangerous.\n\n\n\nWill he be killed for speaking the truth? Will his family? Will he find himself the victim of an \u201caccident\u201d just like Diana\u2019s?\n\n\n\nAll of these are clear possibilities.\n\n\n\nIt is also outrageous that a man should be telling us\u2014pleading with us, really\u2014to understand his situation in a certain way. . . and to have the institutions of the world turn a deaf ear.\n\n\n\nEven if Le Van Thanh wished to tell us the truth, he feels that he cannot. Surely this fuel demands for a new inquest to be opened on the tragic death of Princess Diana.\n\n\n\nThat is exactly the feelings of Mohamed Al-Fayed, who through his lawyer, Michael Mansfield QC, told our investigation that if it can now be shown Le Van Thanh was driving the white Fiat Uno, there is a genuine case to be made to reopen the inquest:\n\nThere is a real question mark here because the French authorities were particularly anxious to ensure that it was blamed to the paparazzi.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s why they were all arrested to begin with. He (Le Van Thanh) had the car resprayed. It is very suspicious.\n\n\n\nIf it\u2019s him in the tunnel\u2014if it\u2019s his Fiat\u2014whether it was an accident or whether he was trying to get in the way. I have no idea.\n\n\n\nThe Mercedes obviously did hit the Fiat. Whether that was an accident by the driver driving too fast into the tunnel or whether the Fiat Uno was in the wrong lane, I can\u2019t take it beyond that. I don\u2019t know what part the Fiat Uno played other than it obviously had a role as a vehicle that was there. But whether the driver did this deliberately or\n\nnot obviously, and what his background is, and why, all the rest of these other questions are in the same league as the [James] Andanson story.\n\n\n\nWitnesses have said it. It\u2019s not contrived. That\u2019s the concrete evidence. . . . What I\u2019m more interested in is the sandwiching of the car. There are other drivers out there that have not been traced.\n\nLikewise, former BBC royal correspondent Michael D. Cole (who after leaving the BBC, worked as director of public affairs for Harrods, and thus also as a spokesman for its owner Mohamed Al-Fayed) suggests our remarkable interview with Le Van Than should be passed to British and French authorities as part of a formal request to reopen the Diana inquest as a cold case inquiry.", "description": "In a newly-published book, 'Diana: Case Solved,' the man driving the car that clipped Diana's before the crash speaks out for the first time.", "authors": ["Gibson Johns"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BG6aL.r4CuvDqhICWiEkgA--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/1028x674+0+142/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-04/34dee1c0-5aa0-11e9-bf99-6d89af5c79e5", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
