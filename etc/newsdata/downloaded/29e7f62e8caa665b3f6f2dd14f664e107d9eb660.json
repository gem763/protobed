Canadian tennis sensation Bianca Andreescu appeared on The Tonight Show last night to begin her victory tour as the newly minted U.S. Open champion, after upsetting Serena Williams in the finals. Not only is Andreescu the first woman born in the 2000s to win a major (yes, you are that old), she\u2019s also the first Canadian to win the U.S. Open \u2026 ever. Given this historic feat, you\u2019d probably think that Drake, the self-proclaimed King of Canada, would be clamoring to congratulate his fellow countrywoman, right? Well, think again! According to Andreescu, all of Canada\u2019s top talent, including Shania Twain, Justin Trudeau, and the Toronto Raptors, have congratulated her, except Drizzy. \u201cChampagne Papi, I\u2019m waiting for you,\u201d Andreescu said. Look, Drake\u2019s cool and all, but everyone knows the only Canadian who really matters is French-Canadian queen Celine Dion.\n\nRelated", "description": "Canadian Tennis Player Bianca Andreescu Calls Out Rapper Drake For Not Congratulating Her On Big Win Over Serena Williams At The US Open.", "authors": ["Chris Murphy"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/10/10-tennis.w1200.h630.png", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
