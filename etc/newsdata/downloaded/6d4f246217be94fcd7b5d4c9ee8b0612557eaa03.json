The broader technology sector ( ) rose 0.79%, with iPhone maker Apple Inc (O: ) providing the biggest support.\n\nApple gained 1.3% after Jefferies assumed coverage with a \"buy\" rating, citing the company's potential in the 5G cycle.\n\nEven as trade talks remain the primary focus, investors will also watch out for the Conference Board's U.S. consumer confidence reading for September that is expected to come in at 133.5, from a reading of 135.1 in August. The report is due at 10:00 a.m. ET (1400 GMT).\n\nData due later this week, which includes the Fed's preferred gauge for inflation, will also offer insights into U.S. economic health ahead of the third-quarter earnings season and the central bank's policy meeting in October.\n\n\"Markets are in this delicate period where investors don't want too much acceleration because they are concerned that it will put an end to low interest rates but they also don't want enough slowing to impact corporate profits,\" Cherry Lane's Meckler said.\n\nAt 9:37 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average ( ) was up 97.17 points, or 0.36%, at 27,047.16, the S&P 500 ( ) was up 11.12 points, or 0.37%, at 3,002.90.
