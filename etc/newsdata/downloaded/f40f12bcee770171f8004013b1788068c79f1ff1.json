Bernard Sanders of Vermont is poised to win an endorsement from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, according to multiple news outlets Tuesday evening.\n\nThe Washington Post reported Tuesday that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez, a liberal star who volunteered for Mr. Sanders\u2018 2016 campaign, is set to endorse Mr. Sanders at a campaign rally Saturday. CNN later reported similarly.\n\nAccording to CNN, two other members of the far-left \u201cSquad\u201d of first-term women of color will join Ms. Ocasio-Cortez in endorsing Mr. Sanders at the Queens event. Mr. Sanders promoted that rally without elaboration at Tuesday night\u2019s presidential debate.\n\n\u201cIlhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib will also endorse Sanders, according to source,\u201d CNN politics reporter Greg Krieg wrote on Twitter.\n\nThat could provide a much-needed boost for Mr. Sanders, who recently suffered a heart attack on the campaign trail, raising questions about whether the 78-year-old was too old for the job.\n\nThe Ocasio-Cortez endorsement has been considered one of the most sought-after in the Democratic presidential primary given her sway with liberal activists across the country who have been inspired by her political rise and far-left message.\n\n\u2022 Victor Morton contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
