It was a surprising omission. In the abstract, climate has polled as a very high priority among Democrat voters, so much so that in September, CNN televised a seven-and-one-half hour town hall meeting on climate for the candidates.\n\nThis week, both Bernie Sanders and Tom Steyer briefly protested the lack of attention to climate, but to no avail. A few other candidates mentioned the term \u201cclimate\u201d in passing (Andrew Yang, Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar), but the CNN and New York Times reporters did not take the bait.\n\nThe omission of climate did draw the attention of New York Times climate reporter Lisa Friedman. Noting a TV ad run during the debate by the climate skeptic Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) that criticized the Green New Deal, Friedman tweeted, \u201cThat CEI ad against the Green New Deal is officially the longest discussion of climate change during the 4th #DemDebate.\u201d\n\nYet the Green New Deal was launched by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the premise that there are only 12 years left to \u201csave\u201d the planet. During the debate, Sanders referred to climate as an \u201cexistential\u201d threat. Steyer called it a \u201ccrisis.\u201d Still, the CNN and New York Times reporters could not be persuaded to serve up a climate question to the candidates.\n\nThis should come as no surprise. Climate change has never been a political winner. The political track record is clear. Consider the following:\n\n1993. Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201cBTU\u201d tax, perhaps the first CO2 tax ever voted on, passed the Democrat-controlled House but failed in the Democrat-controlled Senate. Many blamed their 1994 election defeats on votes for the BTU tax.\n\nBill Clinton\u2019s \u201cBTU\u201d tax, perhaps the first CO2 tax ever voted on, passed the Democrat-controlled House but failed in the Democrat-controlled Senate.

Though Barack Obama campaigned on global warming and won against Sen. John McCain, McCain had repeatedly introduced climate bills with Democrat co-sponsor Sen. Joe Lieberman in 2003, 2005 and 2007. There was not much, if any, daylight between Obama and McCain on climate.\n\nThough Barack Obama campaigned on global warming and won against Sen.

No Senator voted for the Green New Deal, including Green New Deal co-sponsor Sen. Ed Markey and Sanders, recently endorsed for president by Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nWhy does climate have such a poor political track record? That\u2019s easy. While people may tell a pollster that they are \u201cconcerned\u201d about the climate or even that they support a carbon tax, when asked how much they would be willing to pay, the answer is pretty much \u201cnothing.\u201d\n\nIn a recent Washington Post poll, for example, 60% of respondents said they supported a carbon tax. But 75% said they would oppose a 25-cent gas tax and 71% said they would oppose paying $10 more a month for electricity \u2013 both representing extremely minimal carbon taxes.\n\nWashington state Gov. Jay Inslee, who dropped out of the Democrat race after polling at zero percent as the \u201cclimate candidate,\u201d has now failed twice to persuade voters to pass a carbon tax in his own left-leaning state.\n\nWhile the Green New Deal may sound like a good idea to many people, when you tell them what that would do to their standard of living, lifestyle and pocketbook, support all but evaporates.\n\nThe September CNN town hall on climate was a debacle for Democrats. They spent over seven hours explaining to Americans how they would take away their cheeseburgers, plastic straws, plastic trash bags, end fracking and more.\n\nUsually politicians promise voters the moon. Climate is the one issue where they are promising voters a green hell \u00be degraded lifestyles and reduced standards of living. Democrat candidates should be grateful this week that the CNN and New York Times debate moderators spared them further self-inflicted damage to their campaigns.", "description": "While some have suggested that Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u201cwon\u201d this .10/19/2019 6:57:37AM EST.", "authors": ["Steve Milloy", "Matt Vespa", "Bronson Stocking", "Leah Barkoukis"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/288/e97ac8d2-18a8-49df-9312-218cd6fc3114.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
