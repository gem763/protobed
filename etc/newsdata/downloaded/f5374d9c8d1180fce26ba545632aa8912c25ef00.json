But if it continues, car buyers can expect to see shortages.\n\n\"In certain segments (large SUVs especially), inventories are tight, and should the strike continue, shortages will undoubtedly occur,\" he said.", "description": "Thousands of automotive workers across Ontario are temporarily out of work as a strike at General Motors in the U.S. stretches into its ninth day.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5295498.1569344759!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/usa-autos-labor-lordstown.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
