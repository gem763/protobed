Both Australia\u2019s Reece Hodge and Samoa\u2019s Rey Lee-Lo have been suspended for three weeks, while fellow Samoan Motu Matu\u2019u is also facing a ban for a dangerous high tackle in their win over Russia earlier this week.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

However, he did reveal that both Mako Vunipola and Jack Nowell \u2013 the only two players yet to feature for England at the World Cup \u2013 came through a full fitness session on Friday morning with flying colours and look set to feature in selection for the game against the Pumas.\n\n\"We trained early this morning and Mako and Jack are good,\u201d said the attack coach Wisemantel. :At this stage we believe everyone will be available against Argentina.\n\n\"Mako gives us something with his ball carrying and energy around the park..But the way the boys are going, he's going to find it hard to get back into the team selection-wise. Joe Marler and Ellis Genge are doing a good job.\n\n\"Jack adds something different. He is a hybrid really - a winger cum back-rower, the way he plays.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, John Quill is facing a disciplinary hearing in Tokyo this afternoon following his red-card offence on Owen Farrell, which saw the US reduced to 14 men for the closing minutes of Thursday's encounter.\n\nDownload or listen to the latest episode of The Indy Rugby Podcast from the Rugby World Cup.", "description": "England\u2019s Piers Francis faces a Rugby World Cup ban after being cited for a dangerous high tackle on the United States full-back Will Hooley, handing England their first major setback at Japan 2019.
