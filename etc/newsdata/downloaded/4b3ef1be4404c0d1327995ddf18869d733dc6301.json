Last week he said, on camera: \u201cChina should start an investigation into the Bidens.\u201d\n\nIt is against the law in the US to solicit foreign assistance for electioneering. This is a serious charge that has been levelled at Mr Trump his whole time as president. He has been accused of accepting Russian help to fight the 2016 presidential campaign, although no evidence of law-breaking has yet met the threshold for prosecution.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Mr Johnson\u2019s response is not known. Similar demands have been made of the Australian and Italian governments.\n\nRecently, the president\u2019s conversations with Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, have been made public. Mr Trump asked Mr Zelensky to investigate the business dealings of Hunter Biden, son of a possible rival in next year\u2019s presidential election. The request was backed by the threat to withhold US military aid \u2013 a threat that was withdrawn as soon as it became known.\n\nIn the midst of widespread indignation about the subversion of American democracy, Mr Trump appeared outside the White House on Thursday and, in effect, said that his critics were right \u2013 by inviting the Chinese government to embarrass his Democratic rival.\n\nThis is, incidentally, the Chinese regime that oppresses the Uighurs and Tibetans and is cracking down on democratic protesters in Hong Kong.\n\nThe evidence that Mr Trump has broken the law is strong \u2013 and this is on a matter that arguably does fit the \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanours\u201d described in the US constitution.\n\nIt is well known, however, that procedures in congress for impeachment and removal of a president are political rather than legal. The House of Representatives was always likely to impeach \u2013 that is, to charge \u2013 Mr Trump once the Democrats gained a majority in last year\u2019s mid-term elections. Even before last week\u2019s news, opinion polls suggest more American voters now support than oppose impeachment.\n\nThe question was always going to be whether there would be a two-thirds majority in the Senate to convict the president. Until recently, and despite Mr Trump\u2019s distance from the Republican establishment, this has seemed implausible.\n\nIt remains unlikely, but if public opinion turns further against the president \u2013 and he has been more unpopular before \u2013 his removal from office no longer seems a remote prospect.", "description": "How far away Bill Clinton\u2019s misdemeanours seem.
