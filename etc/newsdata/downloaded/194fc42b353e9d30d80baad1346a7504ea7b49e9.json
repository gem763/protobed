The researchers note that male athletes have, in general, an advantage of 10 to 15 percent in comparison with female athletes, which is most likely due to men having, on average, more than 15 times higher circulating testosterone than women.\n\nThere has been much discussion recently about whether women with levels of testosterone high enough to fall into the male range, as a result of rare inborn conditions, should be allowed to compete against women with normal levels of the hormone, although evidence is limited on the effect of testosterone on female performance.\n\nHowever, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has said that female athletes with high levels of the hormone must lower their testosterone levels to below 5 nmol/l of blood to be eligible to compete at international level in middle distance races (400m to 1 mile), which has been widely criticized and legally challenged.\n\n\"Our results are therefore of great importance for the ongoing discussion of whether it is fair to allow athletes with naturally high testosterone to compete in the female category without reducing their hormonal concentration to the female range,\" conclude the researchers.", "description": "In the first study of its kind, new European research has found that higher testosterone levels in females have a significant effect on a woman's ability to run for longer.
