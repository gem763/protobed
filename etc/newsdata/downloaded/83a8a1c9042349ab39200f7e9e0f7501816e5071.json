The company has lost costly court fights over the safety of perhaps its most famous product, Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder, and its marketing of addictive opioid medication.\n\nThe $8 billion Risperdal verdict inflicted the heaviest financial damage, although legal observers expect it will be dramatically reduced by the court because it appears unreasonably high. The result highlights the risk of fighting cases rather than settling.\n\nAD\n\nIn August, a judge in Oklahoma found Johnson & Johnson liable for helping fuel the state\u2019s opioid crisis and ordered it to pay $572 million to help meet health costs and others incurred by the state. The company had sold opioid pills and fentanyl skin patches. Johnson & Johnson has said it will appeal that verdict.\n\nAD\n\nThe company announced last week that it had reached a $20.4 million settlement with two Ohio counties, which will be the first test cases this month in a consolidation of more than 2,000 opioid lawsuits brought in federal courts.\n\nThe company\u2019s powder products have drawn another raft of lawsuits. Last year, a jury in St. Louis awarded $4.7 billion to 22 women who claimed that their ovarian cancer was caused by Johnson\u2019s Baby Powder and Shower to Shower. Both products contain talc that the plaintiffs said was tainted with asbestos. Johnson & Johnson, which has won some other baby powder lawsuits, has denied that its talc products caused harm.\n\nAD\n\nThe company has publicly reported it is being sued by 13,400 people over Risperdal. It says hundreds have been dismissed. The case that captured attention this week began in 2013 when Nicholas Murray, a Maryland man, alleged that Johnson & Johnson did not adequately warn doctors of the drug\u2019s side effects. He began taking the drug in 2003, at age 9, to ease sleep problems associated with autism. But he suffered a side effect: enlarged breasts, a condition called gynecomastia.\n\nAD\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration did not approve Risperdal for children until three years after Murray began taking it. His physicians had prescribed it \u201coff-label,\u201d meaning in a way not approved by the agency.\n\nIn 2015, a jury in Philadelphia awarded Murray $1.75 million in compensatory damages but it was reduced to $680,000. The punitive damage phase of the trial did not take place until this year, with a different jury. Johnson & Johnson is vowing to appeal the $8 billion award.\n\nAD\n\nA lawyer who tried the case for the company \u2014 John D. Winter, a partner at Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler \u2014 said Wednesday that the judge prevented the jury from considering crucial information.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe tried a case with our hands completely tied behind our back, and we were precluded from offering any evidence to give the jury a fair perspective on the issue they had to decide,\u201d Winter said in an interview. He disputed the idea the jury was sending a message with its eye-popping award.\n\n\u201cIf the message is anything, the message was our due process rights were trampled,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother outside lawyer for Johnson & Johnson, John Beisner, a partner at Skadden Arps, who did not participate in Risperdal litigation but is assisting in other lawsuits facing the company, said civil claims against Johnson & Johnson are part of a wider national pattern of increasing tort claims against drug and medical device companies. He said the phenomenon is driven in part by private investors backing the early phases of litigation in hopes of a big payoff.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhen asked if Johnson & Johnson was facing a \u201ccrisis\u2019\u2019 of civil lawsuits, he replied, \u201cThe crisis, if there is one, is less focused on a particular company. It\u2019s the rapid growth of all this litigation, and how companies generally and the system generally are going to deal with this.\u201d\n\nThe nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen has tracked the number of criminal and civil settlements and court judgments against pharmaceutical companies for the past three decades, through 2017. Its figures show a strongly increasing trend until 2013, when they reached a peak of 60 in 2013. The number dropped off sharply in the next four years.\n\nIn terms of dollars paid in penalties or damages over those decades, Johnson & Johnson ranked third at $2.9 billion in 20 settlements, behind GlaxoSmithKline ($8 billion in 32 settlements) and Pfizer ($4.7 billion in 34 settlements).\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe bulk of Johnson & Johnson\u2019s financial payouts was $2.2 million in civil and criminal fines in 2013, part of a settlement with the federal government, for off-label promotion of Risperdal for children and elderly patients with dementia.\n\nOff-label use of drugs can be beneficial when there\u2019s sufficient medical evidence to back it up, said Michael Carome, director of the health research group at Public Citizen. But the quest for profits often drives companies to improperly promote the drugs, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen a drug has not been tested and that\u2019s exposing patients to unacceptable risk of harm,\u201d he said, \u201cthat is among the most serious types of illegal conduct that a drug company can engage in.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "Critics say $8 billion award against the pharmaceuticals giant is a symbol of consumer anger.", "authors": ["Christopher Rowland", "Business Reporter Focused On The Health-Care Economy'S Effects On Patient Health", "Costs"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/__LduduKZ1AvXQ5A4EKVmfq1POU=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OFKK2JHKZEI6TEYGI7FQGJH5IQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
