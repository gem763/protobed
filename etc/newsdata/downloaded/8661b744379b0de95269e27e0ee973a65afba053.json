The Pentagon disagrees with him, the State Department disagrees with him, Republicans disagree with him. In fact, an overwhelming majority of Republicans disagree with him.\u201d\n\nHe later lamented, \u201cA dark, dark day for America at home and with our allies. And unfortunately, our enemies, the message we send to our enemies that we are weak, that we capitulate, that Donald Trump is scared, that he\u2019s a frightened man, that he will always surrender. He is the head of the surrender caucus. But that caucus keeps getting smaller by the day. He is a man alone.\u201d\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "During Thursday's \"Morning Joe\" on MSNBC, host Joe Scarborough shared his reaction to the contentious White House meeting between President Donald Trump | Clips", "authors": ["Trent Baker"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/scarborough-4-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
