This includes everything from minute technical standards to procedures for removing bias from algorithms.\n\nCountries and companies have a lot to gain from leaving a mark on the process.\n\nFor one, firms whose technology is deemed part of a global standard can make big money in royalties \u2014 in the way Qualcomm, for example, profits from its wireless technology patents.\n\nWhat's more, the definitions of AI buzzwords like \"fairness\" and \"transparency\" are still up for grabs. How they are codified will have a sweeping effect on the way AI systems are deployed and whom they benefit \u2014 companies, governments, or users.\n\nBeijing got out of the starting gate first: Last year, China published a detailed report focused on ethical norms and technical standards that are meant to allow companies to work together more easily. A few months later, Beijing hosted the first major international meeting on AI standards.\n\nFor China, shaping global AI standards is key to \u201cseizing a new round of technology dominance,\" according to the Chinese report, published by the government, industry and academia.

China's strong showing \"could enable Chinese actors to influence a wide range of issues related to AI standards, including ethical and social norm development,\" they wrote.\n\nThe response: The Trump administration has vigorously pushed back against China's tech drive. Trump earlier this year signed an executive order designed to keep Beijing at bay on AI.\n\nLast week, as required by the order, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposed a plan to work with industry and academia on new metrics and standards for accuracy, \"trustworthiness\" and bias of AI systems.\n\nas required by the order, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) proposed a plan to work with industry and academia on new metrics and standards for accuracy, \"trustworthiness\" and bias of AI systems. The EU and OECD have also advanced high-level guidelines.\n\nOne short-term risk of this international rush is a \"rebordering\" of AI, in which the field will develop according to different rules in the U.S., Europe and China. Thus far, AI has been characterized by significant international collaboration.\n\n\"We could have researchers and companies having to pick a side,\" says Amy Webb, an NYU professor and founder of the Future Today Institute.\n\n\"This could drastically reduce productivity; it could drastically increase costs.\"\n\nThe big question: Where a potential future global policy will settle.
