Within an hour, a second cub had been born.\n\nThe zoo said the mother and cubs were all in good health.\n\n\"On Saturday evening, Berlin's panda population doubled as Germany welcomed its first-ever panda offspring \u2014 two of them!\" said the zoo. The zoo is also home to the cubs' father, Jiao Ching.\n\nAs pandas with twins usually raise only one of the cubs, the zoo is actively supporting Meng Meng, 6, in the rearing process and has enlisted experts from China's Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding Zoo to help.\n\nIt is notoriously difficult to get giant pandas to mate. With only 1,864 adults living in their natural habitat, every new cub is an important contribution to the conservation of the species, said Berlin Zoo director and vet Andreas Knieriem.\n\nWatch Meng Meng with one of her newborn twins:\n\nGiant panda Meng Meng, on loan from China, gave birth Aug. 31 to a set of twins at Berlin Zoo. 0:25\n\nAfter weeks of speculation which made headlines in Berlin and national newspapers, experts at the zoo confirmed just over a week ago that Meng Meng was pregnant. The cubs weigh 186 and 136 grams. Their genders have not yet been determined.\n\nChina has long engaged in \"panda diplomacy.\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel \u2014 who heads to China on a pre-planned visit this week \u2014 and Chinese President Xi Jinping welcomed Meng Meng and Jiao Qing to Berlin Zoo at a ceremony in 2017 as part of a loan agreement.\n\nUnder that deal, any cubs will be returned to China once they no longer need their mother. But for now, Berlin is celebrating.\n\n\"What fantastic news! The whole of Berlin is delighted about the new arrivals!\" Berlin's mayor Michael Mueller said.\n\nA handout picture shows one of the new born panda twins after their birth on August 31, 2019 at Berlin Zoo.
