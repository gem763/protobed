Three years later, the woman was admitted to a county-run care facility, Journal-News reported. However, once she was admitted, the woman was denied Medicaid because she still owned the Georgia home. Under Ohio law, nursing homes are supposed to take over people\u2019s property when they enter.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAccording to the Journal-News the woman\u2019s nursing home bill ballooned to $50,000, prompting Butler County\u2019s care facility director Chick Demidovich to purchase the home for $18,000 \u2013 and becoming an issue for the county since.\n\n\u201cThe thing is the law says I\u2019m supposed to collect these people\u2019s property. I really don\u2019t want to do that, and this is an exact example why. If I get somebody\u2019s house that nobody wants, I might as well become a land bank,\u201d Demidovish told the Journal-News about the unique situation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nThe county tried to unload the falling-apart home for years \u2013 including trying to sell it to Hawkinsville, which reportedly declined, soliciting bids and allowing the home to go through foreclosure and put it up for auction \u2013 but no one bit.\n\nNow in a hail-Mary attempt, the county is listing the home and land for $1.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\n\u201cI just have a wild idea, what if we put a quarter-page ad in the newspaper and it just said something like property for sale, $1,\u201d Commissioner Cindy Carpenter said to the Journal-News, hoping listing for $1 will \u201cchange the dynamic.\u201d\n\nThe home is currently still for sale.", "description": "Talk about a steal.", "authors": ["Alexandra Deabler", "Alexandra Deabler Is A Lifestyle Writer", "Editor For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/georgia-1-home.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
