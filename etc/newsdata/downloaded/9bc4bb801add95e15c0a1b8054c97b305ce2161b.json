Apart from antipathy for Trump in a polarised polity, they may have been influenced by a certain easily available narrative in left-liberal sections of the Western press, which looks only at government restrictions and not atrocities committed by militants in a one-sided portrayal of events in Kashmir.\n\nSuch preachiness was in full flight when Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar \u2013 she of the \u201csome people did something\u201d remark on 9/11 fame \u2013 hectored a Kashmiri journalist working for this newspaper for not reporting the \u201cobjective truth\u201d in her home state (which no doubt is easily available to Omar who gets teleported there by the \u2018clairvoyant\u2019 sections of the Western press). Nevertheless, even as the US polity is intensely polarised at this point, for that very reason it makes sense for New Delhi to place fewer eggs in Trump\u2019s basket and more in the Democratic one \u2013 Trump being impeached even before his popularity is tested in elections next year has emerged as a distinct possibility.\n\nMoreover, there is a strong case for relaxing Kashmir restrictions and releasing political detainees \u2013 those restrictions are now well past their expiry date. It must also be recognised that part of the PR problem New Delhi has run into in presenting its case on Kashmir is because of events elsewhere in the country \u2013 the spate of lynchings, the unwarranted Muslim bashing and Hindutva triumphalism, the NRC fiasco, the Citizenship Bill that is destructive of the values of the Indian Constitution. These steps must be reversed not just for the sake of external soft power but internal cohesion too.", "description": "Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s risky move of plumping wholesale for President Donald Trump at the Houston \u2018Howdy Modi\u2019 event may have backfired, as Democrat lawmakers at a US Congressional hearing on \u201chuman rights in South...", "authors": ["Toi Edit"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/toiedit-logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
