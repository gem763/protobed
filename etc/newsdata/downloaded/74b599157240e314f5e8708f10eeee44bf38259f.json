The exploits gave attackers access to photos, location information, private messages and more.\n\nApple has recently emphasized iPhone privacy with a big marketing campaign. At CES 2019, just across from the main conference center that was plastered with Google Assistant logos, Apple posted an ad that read: \"What happens on your iPhone, stays on your iPhone.\" The company has also run commercials touting the privacy features of the iPhone.\n\nThe flaws were fixed in February when Apple released iOS 12.1.4 after Google notified the company, which is why Google is now talking about the flaws publicly. But Google said the attack could be used against iPhone owners who visited a \"small collection of hacked websites\" and could have affected \"thousands of visitors per week.\"\n\nAccording to the Project Zero's Threat Analysis Group, there were 14 different exploits that hackers were using to take private information from iPhones. \"Seven for the iPhone's web browser, five for the kernel and two separate sandbox escapes,\" the group said.\n\nGoogle said it wasn't targeted at specific people, all you had to do was visit an infected site.", "description": "Google said it found 14 security flaws in iPhones that existed for two years and could give attackers access to contacts, photos, messages and more.", "authors": ["Todd Haselton"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105866618-1556034927121gettyimages-1144596495.jpeg?v=1556034948"}
