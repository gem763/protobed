LOUIS (AP) \u2014 Washington Nationals right-hander An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez has not allowed a hit through five innings of Game 1 of the NL Championship Series against the St. Louis Cardinals.\n\nS\u00e1nchez retired his first 10 batters before Kolten Wong walked in the fourth for St. Louis' only baserunner so far. He stole second and went to third on catcher Yan Gomes' throwing error, but Marcell Ozuna fouled out to end the inning.\n\nS\u00e1nchez struck out four in the first five innings of his ninth career postseason start. He's thrown 56 pitches.\n\nWashington led 1-0 on Gomes' two-out RBI double off Miles Mikolas in the second inning Friday night.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.
