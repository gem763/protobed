Arnold Schwarzenegger said he also evacuated in the middle of the night.\n\nWe evacuated safely at 3:30 this morning. If you are in an evacuation zone, don\u2019t screw around. Get out.

He said multiple homes were destroyed.\n\n\"We've seen fires and tragedies were people have believed they could stay,\" Garcetti said. \"Do not do that. The only thing you cannot replace is you and your family.\"\n\nNIGHT BRUSH FIRE 10/28/19 @LACoFireAirOps Firehawk helicopter using night vision technology to assist @LAFD with the #GettyFire in the Sepulveda Pass.

Throughout the day, the conditions in Los Angeles will be extremely dangerous for fire growth.\n\nWind gusts reached 66 mph in the Los Angeles area early Monday and could reach 50 mph through the evening. Red flag warnings are in effect through the day.\n\nGusty winds and dry conditions can cause an existing fire to behave erratically and any spark could quickly expand into a major blaze.\n\nThis is the scene in #Brentwood - top of #tigertail on streets like sky lane, chickory Lane and Canna.
