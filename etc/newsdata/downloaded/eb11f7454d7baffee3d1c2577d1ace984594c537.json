Forecasts called for heavy winds to return late on Saturday and persist through the weekend, leaving fire crews a narrow window to tamp down the blazes in Los Angeles and Sonoma counties.\n\nPower companies, led by the state's largest investor-owned utility, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., also were bracing for a renewal of gale-force winds.\n\nEven as PG&E worked to restore electricity to nearly 200,000 homes and businesses switched off ahead of this week's earlier bout of severe winds, the utility announced plans for a new round of precautionary blackouts expected to leave 850,000 customers without power across 36 counties in northern and central California.\n\nThe utility cited weather data showing the expected windstorm \"could be the most powerful in California in decades.\"\n\nAdding to PG&E's difficulties, the utility acknowledged on Thursday that the Kincade fire, which forced the evacuation of 2,000 people in Sonoma County after erupting on Wednesday night, began near the base of a damaged high-voltage transmission tower the utility owns.", "description": "Precautionary blackouts are affecting hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106205381-1572085880955gettyimages-1183325153.jpeg?v=1572085930", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
