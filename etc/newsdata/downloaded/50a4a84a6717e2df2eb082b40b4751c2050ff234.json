Trump and a coterie of aides were stunned by a swift progression of events that upended their longtime thinking about how an impeachment scenario would proceed. By the time they returned to the White House Thursday, they had tested and retested strategies on the fly as they began to recognize the perilous road ahead that would likely look far different from anything this president or any of his predecessors faced.\n\n\u201cIt should never be allowed, what's happened to this president,\u201d Trump told reporters upon stepping off Air Force One.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s rapid move toward impeachment, after months of stalling, reflected her recognition of a new political reality: The contents of Trump\u2019s call with the Ukrainian president, in which he used his sacred perch in the White House to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival, could push Trump into feisty and perilous territory \u2014 testing public opinion and congressional patience in a drama-filled election season. The swiftness of Pelosi\u2019s action caught the White House by surprise.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/9f/5e/efb5847e4b42a358b4de7e606b6b/ukraine-site.png\"\n\nWhite House aides and allies do not expect the president to calm down anytime soon. Many worry impeachment proceedings will sour the president\u2019s mood and his ability to focus on legislation, any other substantive policy matters or even key elements of the 2020 campaign, much the way Mueller dominated his attention.\n\nInterviews with more than a dozen White House aides, former administration officials, Republican operatives and close Trump allies showed little consensus on either the best course of action ahead or the consequences for Trump and his presidency.\n\nThe White House and Trumpworld are expected to test countless new strategies in the weeks and months ahead, just as they did in recent days.\n\nThe White House attempted to first bat down the controversy by stonewalling Congress on getting the whistleblower complaint. Then the administration veered toward transparency by releasing a summary memo of the call between Trump and the Ukrainian leader, and then the whistleblower complaint. Republican talking points tried to cast the rough call transcript as a vindication for the president, a \u201cmuddy\u201d document as one former senior White House official put it.\n\nStill, the president believed his sudden embrace of transparency would exonerate him, even if he and two Cabinet members worried about the precedent of releasing notes of calls with foreign leaders.\n\nBut by Thursday, the administration and allies moved into a new phase of attempting to discredit the whistleblower, whose complaint kicked off the events that brought Trump to this point. Republicans, privately and vaguely, tried to cast the whistleblower as a partisan figure without offering any evidence, while Trump reportedly referred to the whistleblower as a spy.\n\nBut some former aides also say Trump himself has made things much worse for himself with his changing story, a reflection of the president\u2019s long-held approach to decision-making.\n\n\u201cYou get one version of the story, and then you go, \u2018Oh okay.\u2019 But then you go, \u2018Oh wait, there\u2019s another version. We forgot to tell you these 10 other things,'\u201d said one of the former senior White House officials. On calls with foreign leaders, the president \u201chas a comfort level where he says whatever is on his mind.\u201d\n\nAfter days of differing messages offered between his U.N. meetings, the president spent part of Thursday taking Twitter jabs at both the whistleblower and Democrats. \u201cLiddle\u2019 Adam Schiff, who has worked unsuccessfully for 3 years to hurt the Republican Party and President, has just said that the Whistleblower, even though he or she only had secondhand information, \u2018is credible.\u2019 How can that be with zero info and a known bias. Democrat Scam!\u201d Trump tweeted Thursday afternoon, shortly after he arrived back at the White House.\n\nCampaign aides and advisers maintain the impeachment inquiry only helps motivate Trump\u2019s extremely loyal base as well as his fundraising. The campaign and Republican National Committee raised an estimated $8 million this week from a dinner and breakfast in New York, which featured the president as a special guest.\n\nposter=\"https://static.politico.com/76/1d/89d23a804d4d95f3083b6e9593d4/trumpimpeachment.jpg\"\n\n\u201cPelosi sacrificed Biden\u2019s presidential campaign to get Trump, and now Elizabeth Warren is going to be the nominee, which I think every Trump person with a brain would prefer,\u201d said a person close to the campaign.\n\nRepublicans and White House advisers\u2019 greatest comfort now comes from the wonky mechanics of impeachment, which will give the Senate the final say about the fate of Trump\u2019s presidency. Few think Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will allow the Senate proceedings to drag on. Republicans\u2019 confidence in Trump\u2019s ability to survive this scandal appears to largely rest with McConnell and his grip on his caucus, not necessarily with the White House.\n\nA White House official claimed there \u201cis a very positive mood\u201d in the building. \u201cEverybody's just absolutely thrilled.\u201d\n\nThe White House press secretary and communications director, Stephanie Grisham, said the president and his aides\u2019 view of impeachment has not changed in the last week. \u201cNothing has changed. The president did nothing wrong,\u201d Grisham said.\n\n\u201cWhat these guys are doing \u2014 Democrats \u2014 are doing to this country is a disgrace and it shouldn\u2019t be allowed,\u201d Trump told reporters Thursday afternoon. \u201cThere should be a way of stopping it \u2014 maybe legally, through the courts. But they're going to tie up our country. We can't talk about gun regulation. We can't talk about anything because, frankly, they're so tied up. They're so screwed up, nothing gets done \u2014 except for when I do it.\u201d\n\nPublic opinion has rapidly shifted over the week, with the number of Americans who support impeachment on the rise.\n\nStrategizing about the best way to handle the impeachment proceedings and the White House\u2019s release of information happened on Monday night, when the Trump family gathered for dinner at Trump Tower.\n\nThen as soon as White House aides returned to Washington on Thursday afternoon, the West Wing impeachment planning kicked off in earnest.\n\nActing chief of staff Mick Mulvaney hopes to set up a war room, comprised of political, press and communications aides to help with the administration\u2019s fight. The administration intends to model it after the Clinton White House\u2019s impeachment strategy, which relied on both separate administration staffers and outside surrogates for the political battles.\n\nGrisham said the White House does not need to make any new hires to deal with the impeachment inquiry.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201909/3888/1155968404_6089163104001_6089162887001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nAlready, the White House counsel\u2019s office is accustomed to the siege of investigations and Democratic oversight, so the top attorney, Pat Cipollone, and his team are more prepared than the rest of the White House staff, according to two former administration officials and one close White House adviser.\n\nThe administration will need to set itself up for a potentially long battle. The impeachment proceedings for President Richard Nixon stretched roughly eight months, ending with Nixon\u2019s resignation. The Clinton proceedings ran for roughly five months, with Clinton acquitted by the Senate.\n\nSeveral former administration aides and White House advisers worry the West Wing is not staffed robustly enough for this type of prolonged political fight, as filled as it is with family members, junior aides, newcomers or staffers who\u2019ve stayed so long they feel exhausted.\n\nCurrent and former aides also wonder if this impeachment fight will end up feeling different than the prolonged Mueller investigation. \u201cSome of the White House scandals are awful, and you take the PR hit. Everyone knows it is just a matter of time and the news cycle changes. This is one of those instances where it is less clear,\u201d said a former senior administration official.\n\nTrump critics say the president\u2019s habit of firing aides so habitually may hurt him as Congress looks for witnesses and the president tries to stay on message.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s HR practices are going to come back to haunt him here because he is uncomfortable apparently with truth-tellers in his inner circle,\u201d said Timothy Naftali, a professor of public service at NYU and a co-author of \u201cImpeachment: An American History.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is likely to not get good advice from the acolytes who are left,\u201d Naftali said. \u201cHe does not have Don McGahn anymore to tell him not to cross a trip cord.\u201d\n\nBut Trump allies and current and former aides argue the White House has been anticipating the moment of Trump\u2019s impeachment since he first took office.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like crack cocaine to the Democrats. They can\u2019t not take the hit,\u201d said Michael Caputo, a former Trump 2016 campaign official. \u201cIf the Republicans aren\u2019t ready for impeachment after having two and a half years to prepare, then we shouldn\u2019t be in politics,\u201d adding that he believed the White House was \u201ccompletely prepared\u201d and the Senate, \u201cbullet-proof.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a strategy to survive. It\u2019s a strategy to thrive through this. It\u2019s a strategy to leverage the Democrats\u2019 obsession with impeachment to defeat them at the polls in November 2020,\u201d Caputo added. \u201cThe White House\u2019s strategy should be predicated on public opinion that\u2019s trending in their favor on impeachment.\u201d\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/71/5b/847fd648425b93c70ccd7e43a293/190926-donald-trump-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
