The Mugabe family had appeared content with the burial at Heroes Acre, after it was agreed that a mausoleum would be built for the former leader.\n\nIn a statement published on Thursday, Information Minister Nick Mangwana said the change was in line with policy \"to respect the wishes of families of deceased heroes\".\n\nMugabe died in Singapore while receiving treatment for cancer, and his body was flown back to Zimbabwe.\n\nIn the wake of his death, the family publicly complained that they had not been consulted about arrangements for the state funeral.\n\nIn a statement, they accused the government of coercion, and said plans to bury Mugabe at the monument were \"contrary to [Mugabe's] wishes\".\n\nThe statement said that one of his final requests was for his wife, Grace Mugabe, to never leave Mr Mugabe's coffin during the funeral and up until the point when he was buried.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption It is believed that Zimbabwe's former first lady, Grace Mugabe, was intended to be her husband's successor\n\nHis family is said to be bitter over his being ousted by his former ally, President Mnangagwa, two years ago - a resentment that may have contributed to the clash over his burial place. Mr Mnangagwa had pushed for it to be Heroes Acre.\n\nMugabe, a former guerrilla leader, was Zimbabwe's first leader after the country became independent in 1980.\n\nDuring his early years, he was praised for broadening access to health and education for the black majority.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mugabe: From war hero to resignation\n\nBut his later rule was marked by economic ruin and the violent repression of his political opponents.\n\nHe held on to power for almost four decades before being overthrown in the 2017 coup and replaced by Mr Mnangagwa.", "description": "The decision comes after a feud between Mugabe's family and the government over his burial place.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07nc8nj.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
