In the wake of the shooting, Guyger claimed that she had confused his apartment for her own and believed he was an intruder. The case prompted mass protests in Dallas against racial bias and excessive use of force by police. If convicted, Guyger faces up to 99 years in prison.\n\n\u201cPrior to that conversation Amber Guyger was able to effectively do her job,\u201d Assistant District Attorney Jason Hermus said during his opening statements at the Frank Crowley Courts Building in Dallas Monday.\n\nHe added that the call ended a mere three minutes before Jean was fatally shot. \u201cAmber Guyger made a series of unreasonable errors and unreasonable decisions and unreasonable choices,\u201d Hermus alleged.\n\nGuyger arrived in court with a security detail, passing by several protesters and Dallas faith leaders who were holding a prayer vigil outside, according to court reporters. The Botham family waited inside the courtroom all morning as the two legal teams and the judge ironed out the last pre-trial motions.\n\nThroughout the highly anticipated two-week trial, the sequestered jury will decide whether Guyger\u2019s actions amount to a crime or a tragic accident. While prosecutors argued that Guyger was \u201cdistracted\u201d by her affair with her partner, missing all the signs that suggested she was in the wrong apartment, the defense claimed Monday that the off-duty cop was simply \u201cexhausted\u201d after a long day\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cAmber Guyger reasonably believed she was in her apartment... that she had no choice but to use her gun to keep from dying,\" Robert Rogers, her attorney, said in his opening statements, before slamming the prosecution for \u201ctwisting and turning innocent mistakes into evil acts.\u201d\n\nOn Sept. 6, Guyger returned to her apartment building at about 10 p.m. after working a 13-hour shift. She\u2019d just gotten off the phone with Martin Rivera, her police partner with whom she was in an \u201cintimate\u201d relationship, prosecutors alleged.\n\nBelieving she was on the third floor, the five-year veteran was allegedly so distracted by the phone call that she didn\u2019t notice walking up to Jean\u2019s fourth-floor apartment\u2014despite his bright red doormat.\n\n\u201cAmber Guyger has no floor mat in front of her door,\u201d Hermus said. \u201cBotham Jean wanted his apartment to be very noticeable. In front of his front door is this extremely obvious bright red floor mat.\u201d\n\nWhen she opened the door, which was slightly ajar, Guyger noticed a \u201clarge silhouette\u201d and believed it to be a trespasser, she told police.\n\nJean, an accountant at PricewaterhouseCoopers who lived alone, was inside watching TV and eating a bowl of vanilla ice-cream when he heard the door open, Hermus said. As he got up from the couch, Guyger immediately drew her gun and gave him verbal commands.\n\nGuyger fired two shots when Jean did not respond, hitting him once in the chest, the arrest warrant affidavit said.\n\n\u201cThe effect of this bullet is catastrophic,\u201d Hermus said, adding the other bullet hit the back wall of his apartment.\n\nThe off-duty cop then called 911 instead of giving Jean medical aid, Hermus added. Guyger has claimed that it was not until she turned on the lights and emergency dispatchers asked for her address that she realized she was in the wrong apartment unit.\n\n\u201cI thought it was my apartment,\u201d Guyger told dispatchers 19 times on the 911 call played in court Monday. \u201cI thought it was my apartment. I\u2019m fucked. Oh my God. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nProsecutors told jurors Monday that they will see Guyger\u2019s text messages and call log from that night, to prove she had a \u201cdate\u201d planned with Rivera that evening. Several text messages also show the two were sending \u201csexually explicit photos,\u201d prosecutors said.\n\nAfter the attack, she continued to text Rivera, which prosecutors believe shows the 31-year-old was also only concerned about her own well-being after the shooting.\n\n\u201cShe should\u2019ve made it her point of existence to take care of that man,\u201d Hermus said, adding that while Guyger was still on the phone with emergency dispatchers, she texted Rivera: \u201cHurry I need you. I fucked up.\u201d\n\nDefense attorneys, however, argued Monday the accident was \u201ca perfect storm of innocent circumstances,\u201d and Guyger \u201cfirmly\u201d believed she was in a dangerous situation inside her own apartment.\n\nRogers admitted that Guyger and Rivera, who is expected to testify at trial, had a \u201cromantic relationship,\u201d but that it never impacted her worked and ended in 2017. Around the time of the incident, Guyger had taken an extra job at a downtown church, and was having difficulty sleeping and staying alert.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sweepy,\u201d she allegedly texted Rivera before heading home, according to Rogers. The defense lawyer added there is no evidence that proves the two had plans to meet later that night, as Guyger had taken the next day off to rest.\n\n\u201cEverything was behind her and she went on autopilot,\u201d Rogers said, later adding Guyger will be taking the stand in her own defense. \u201cYou\u2019ll hear from Amber. You\u2019ll get to know Amber.\u201d\n\nGuyger was arrested for manslaughter three days after the shooting. As Jean was buried in a cemetery by the sea in his native St. Lucia on Sept. 24, Dallas Police Chief U. Rene\u00e9 Hall fired Guyger.\n\nIn December, a Dallas County grand jury indicted Guyger on one count of murder after then-Dallas County District Attorney Faith Johnson presented the manslaughter case. Johnson told reporters at the time the decision meant the grand jury felt the cop\u2019s actions were \u201cknowing\u201d and intentional.\n\nBotham\u2019s mother, Allison, also filed a federal lawsuit against the city of Dallas and Guyger last October, alleging the former officer used excessive force during the incident.", "description": "\u201cHurry I need you.
