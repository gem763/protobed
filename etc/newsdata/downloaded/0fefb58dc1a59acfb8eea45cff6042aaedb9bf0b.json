Last time this cheat sheet was updated was back in late September, when Bill de Blasio\u2014you remember him, tall fellow, mayor of some town in New York\u2014left the race. At the time, it seemed like the Democratic field was in for a serious winnowing. Candidates were realizing that they weren\u2019t going to qualify for the debates, and also they weren\u2019t going to be president.\n\nThen something strange happened. Or rather, it didn\u2019t happen: Even those candidates who missed the debate cut just stayed put. (Meanwhile, candidates who have qualified, including Cory Booker and Julian Castro, have threatened to drop out if they don\u2019t hit fundraising targets.)\n\nBut the stasis broke on Thursday, when Representative Tim Ryan of Ohio announced the end of his campaign.\n\n\u201cI got into this race in April to really give voice to the forgotten people of our country: the workers who have been left behind, the businesses who have been left behind, the people who need health care or aren\u2019t getting a quality education, or are saddled by tremendous debt,\u201d Ryan said in a video. He\u2019ll run for reelection to his Youngstown-area House district.\n\nThe video showed a little bit of why Ryan\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t take off. The candidate comes across as a little lifeless\u2014which is weird, because he\u2019s actually a fairly unusual dude. But on a stage packed with other Democratic contenders who were better-known or more charismatic (and often both), Ryan could never really grab attention. He didn\u2019t really underperform; he was just always a long shot.\n\nWhen he entered the race, Ryan was best known for a quixotic challenge to Nancy Pelosi\u2019s leadership of the House Democratic caucus in 2016. (He wasn\u2019t even the only candidate in the race to have previously challenged Pelosi in vain, though Representative Seth Moulton, a 2018 challenger, dropped out in August.) But he seemed like he might try to run in a similar lane to Senator Sherrod Brown, his fellow Buckeye State Democrat, who passed on a run\u2014a progressive, but one who could connect with working-class white voters in the Midwest.\n\nOther candidates thought that niche was a good idea too, though, most notably former Vice President Joe Biden, and Ryan was never able to get much attention. In the end, the most prominent moment of Ryan\u2019s campaign was being steamrolled during an exchange with his House colleague Tulsi Gabbard over Afghanistan policy during a June debate.\n\nWhile Ryan heads for the exits, several other Democrats who are polling in similar territory are sticking around, at least for now. Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, author Marianne Williamson, Governor Steve Bullock of Montana, and former Representatives Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania and John Delaney of Maryland are still in the race. So, allegedly, is Mayor Wayne Messam of Miramar, Florida, though no one has produced any evidence of an actual campaign.\n\nA host of other candidates are barely qualifying for debates: Castro, Gabbard, billionaire Tom Steyer, and even Booker and Senator Amy Klobuchar. There\u2019s maybe not much upside to their staying in the race, since their odds of becoming president this time around so low, but there\u2019s not much downside, either. Except for maybe Gabbard, none of them have to worry about running for reelection in their current jobs, so why not stick around?\n\nAt the same time, Michael Bloomberg, perennial presidential tease, has reportedly re-opened the door to a run, just a crack, in the event that Biden stumbles. Believe it when you see it.\n\nAs the primaries progress, this cheat sheet will be updated regularly.\n\n* * *\n\nThe Democrats\n\n(Matthew Putney / Reuters)\n\nTOM STEYER\n\nWho is he?\n\nA retired California hedge-funder, Steyer has poured his fortune into political advocacy on climate change and flirted with running for office.\n\nIs he running?\n\nNo. He announced on January 9 that he would sit the race out. Lol jk! Steyer is now telling friends and allies he\u2019s going to get into the race, my colleague Edward-Isaac Dovere reports.\n\nWhy does he want to run?\n\nImpeachment, baby.\n\nWho wants him to run?\n\nThere must be some #Resistance faction out there that does.\n\nCan he win the nomination?\n\nNope.\n\n(matt rourke / ap)\n\nJOE SESTAK\n\nWho is he?\n\nA former vice admiral and two-term member of Congress from Pennsylvania, he twice ran for U.S. Senate.\n\nIs he running?\n\nYes. He announced on June 23.\n\nWhy does he want to run?\n\nSestak\u2019s announcement focuses on his long career in the military and the importance of American foreign policy. It\u2019s a little evocative of retired General Wesley Clark\u2019s 2004 campaign.\n\nWho wants him to run?\n\nIt\u2019s a mystery. Sestak says he delayed a campaign launch while his daughter was treated for cancer, which is praiseworthy, but there wasn\u2019t even a murmur about him running before his announcement. Sestak is best known these days for losing Senate races in 2010 (in the general election) and 2016 (in the Democratic primary).\n\nCan he win the nomination?\n\nNo.\n\nWhat else do we know?\n\nThis logo, boy, I dunno.\n\n(Matthew Brown / AP)\n\nSTEVE BULLOCK\n\nWho is he?\n\nBullock is the governor of Montana, where he won reelection in 2016 even as Donald Trump won the state.\n\nIs he running?\n\nYes. Bullock launched his campaign on May 14.\n\nWhy does he want to run?\n\nBullock portrays himself as a candidate who can win in Trump country and get things done across the aisle. He\u2019s also been an outspoken advocate of campaign-finance reform.\n\nWho wants him to run?\n\nUnclear. The Great Plains and Mountain West aren\u2019t traditional bases for national Democrats.\n\nCan he win the nomination?\n\nProbably not.\n\n(Samantha Sais / Reuters)\n\nMICHAEL BENNET\n\nWho is he?\n\nThe Coloradan was appointed to the Senate in 2009 and has since won reelection twice.\n\nIs he running?\n\nYes. Bennet announced his campaign on May 2.\n\nWhy does he want to run?\n\nLike his fellow Rocky Mountain State Democrat John Hickenlooper, Bennet presents himself as someone with experience in business and management who knows how to work with Republicans.\n\nWho wants him to run?\n\nProbably some of the same people who wanted Hickenlooper to run. Bennet gained new fans with a viral video of his impassioned rant about Ted Cruz during the January government shutdown.\n\nCan he win?\n\nNo.\n\n(Jeff Roberson / AP)\n\nJOE BIDEN\n\nWho is he?\n\nDon\u2019t play coy. You know the former vice president, senator from Delaware, and recurring Onion character.\n\nIs he running?\n\nYes. After a long series of hesitations, Biden announced his campaign on April 25.\n\nWhy does he want to run?\n\nBiden has wanted to be president since roughly forever, and he thinks he might be the best bet to win back blue-collar voters and defeat President Trump in 2020. (Trump reportedly agrees.) But Biden seems reluctant to end his career with a primary loss, knows he\u2019s old (he\u2019ll turn 78 right after Election Day 2020), and is possibly out of step with the new Democratic Party.\n\nWho wants him to run?\n\nBiden has established a strong lead in the Democratic primary, but his shaky performance in the first debate showed he\u2019s not invincible.\n\nCan he win the nomination?\n\nYes. Biden has been battered by the campaign, but he remains atop polling averages.", "description": "Tim Ryan has dropped out of the Democratic race.
