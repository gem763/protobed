The news site also relayed calls for help from residents trapped on roofs for hours.\n\nFreeport resident Yasmin Rigby told the Reuters agency: \"People who thought they were safe are now calling for help\".\n\nA map from the Finnish satellite company ICEYE showed the extent of the flooding on the island:\n\nGrand Bahama's international airport was under 6ft of water, while residents posting on Twitter said a church in Freeport had lost its roof and scores of people were in danger.\n\nAnother Twitter posting called for the rescue of an aunt and nine others from rising waters in the town.\n\nVideo posted on Twitter from Pine Bay showed the extent of the storm there.\n\nJournalist Kyle Walkine tweeted that he was in a three-storey building \"believed to be one of the strongest in Freeport, and it is shaking. But Dorian doesn't want to move\".\n\nClint Watson, a journalist based in the capital Nassau, said people in Grand Bahama were being hit with \"buckets of rain\" and posting videos online showing water rising to the windows of their attics.\n\n\"You can't fathom that but that's what people are showing us with their videos,\" he told the BBC. \"And you can see the water outside pressing in. It's stories like that and images like that that you can't get out of your mind.\"\n\nOne radio station told the Associated Press news agency it had received more than 2,000 distress messages.\n\nWhat about the rest of the Bahamas?\n\nThe Bahamas Press said the entire town of Marsh Harbour in the Abaco Islands had been swamped and warned that the confirmed death toll of five could rise as the situation became clearer.\n\nAerial photos show the devastation.\n\nThe islands, with a population of about 17,000, bore the brunt of the storm. No hurricane had ever made landfall with greater wind speeds. Only the 1935 Labor Day hurricane can match Dorian's 185mph.\n\nOfficials said 21 injured people were airlifted to the capital Nassau by the US Coast Guard.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption The capital, Nassau, was also affected by flooding\n\nPrime Minister Hubert Minnis said on Monday that reports from the Abaco Islands suggested the devastation was \"unprecedented\", calling the hurricane a \"historic tragedy\".\n\nRescue operations were reportedly under way in areas it was safe to enter.\n\nNeither the Abacos nor Grand Bahama are much higher than 40ft above sea level at their highest points. The International Red Cross said it feared wells may have flooded, making clean water unavailable. The organisation said 13,000 houses were feared damaged or destroyed across the nation.\n\nImages from the capital Nassau to the south showed extensive flooding. Matthew Cochrance, a spokesman for the Red Cross, said aid workers were expecting \"significant humanitarian needs\" in the Bahamas once the storm passed.\n\nImage copyright EPA/US COAST GUARD HANDOUT Image caption Aerial photos show a harbour with many of the boats pushed out of the sea and destroyed\n\nThere were concerns on Twitter for US hurricane chaser Josh Morgerman, who had not been heard from since Sunday when his last tweet sent from Marsh Harbour said the storm was \"pounding\" and \"crashing\".\n\nA woman from Nassau, New Providence, said on Facebook that she had taken in 97 stray dogs as the storm hit the island, with 79 staying in her bedroom overnight.\n\nWhat about the US?\n\nThe latest update from the NHC predicts Dorian will begin a slow north-west move on Tuesday, with a further turn north on Wednesday.\n\n\"The hurricane will move dangerously close to the Florida east coast late [Tuesday] through Wednesday evening, very near the Georgia and South Carolina coasts Wednesday night and Thursday, and near or over the North Carolina coast late Thursday,\" it said.\n\nThe BBC Weather service said the storm's current track shows it should say offshore in Florida and Georgia but may affect South Carolina later in the week, although it is likely to have weakened by then.\n\nFlorida, Georgia and North and South Carolina will still feel the impact of the storm and have all declared states of emergency, with mandatory evacuation orders across many areas.\n\nWalt Disney World, Legoland and other tourist parks have announced early closures in anticipation of the hurricane.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Skies darken in Florida as Hurricane Dorian looms in the Atlantic\n\nIs climate change making hurricanes worse?\n\nScientists cannot say whether climate change is increasing the number of hurricanes, but the ones that do happen are likely to be more powerful and more destructive because of our warming climate, said BBC Weather's Tomasz Schafernaker.\n\nHere's why:\n\nAn increase in sea surface temperatures strengthens the wind speeds within storms and also raises the amount of precipitation a hurricane will dump\n\nSea levels are expected to increase by one to four feet over the next century, bringing the potential of far worse damage from sea surges and coastal flooding during storms\n\nUse our guide to see how these deadly storms form, their devastating effects and how they are measured:\n\nHurricanes A guide to the world's deadliest storms Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.\n\nWarm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. \"Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.\"\n\nFlorida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017) The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.\n\nThis eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it. A mound of water piles up below the eye which is unleashed as the storm reaches land.\n\nThese storm surges can cause more damage from flooding than the winds. \"Urgent warning about the rapid rise of water on the SW FL coast with the passage of #Irma's eye. MOVE AWAY FROM THE WATER!\"\n\nTweet from the National Hurricane Center The size of hurricanes is mainly measured by the Saffir-Simpson scale - other scales are used in Asia Pacific and Australia. Winds 119-153km/h\n\nSome minor flooding, little structural damage.\n\nStorm surge +1.2m-1.5m Winds 154-177km/h\n\nRoofs and trees could be damaged.\n\nStorm surge +1.8m-2.4m Winds 178-208km/h\n\nHouses suffer damage, severe flooding\n\nStorm surge +2.7m-3.7m Hurricane Sandy (2012) caused $71bn damage in the Caribbean and New York Winds 209-251km/h\n\nSome roofs destroyed and major structural damage to houses.\n\nStorm surge +4m-5.5m Hurricane Ike (2008) hit Caribbean islands and Louisiana and was blamed for at least 195 deaths Winds 252km/h+\n\nSerious damage to buildings, severe flooding further inland.\n\nStorm surge +5.5m Hurricane Irma (2017) caused devastation in Caribbean islands, leaving thousands homeless \"For everyone thinking they can ride this storm out, I have news for you: that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life.\"\n\nMayor of New Orleans Ray Nagin ahead of Hurricane Gustav, 2008 Click arrow to proceed Loading ...
