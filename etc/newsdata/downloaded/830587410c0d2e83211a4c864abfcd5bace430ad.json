Making movies has nothing to do with art or uplift, only profitability.\n\nIt is a lesson \u2018Cubby\u2019 Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, joint producers of the Bond pictures, instinctively knew.\n\n\u2018We are extremely commercially minded,\u2019 they freely confessed, \u2018and we regard the properties we have as commercial properties\u2019, to be squeezed and exploited \u2014 and not only on the screen.\n\nA new book explores the behind the scenes making of James Bond. (Pictured: Scottish actor Sean Connery and French actress Claudine Auger pictured together on a beach in the Bahamas in 1965 during the filming of James Bond film Thunderball)\n\nBy 1972, the merchandising revenue for 250 licensed products (including 007 vodka and 007 aftershave), in 70 countries, was worth an annual $100 million.\n\nThis fascinating book is a behind-the-scenes glimpse, not at the creative, imaginative side of \u2018the most successful movie franchise in history\u2019, but at the business end of Bond, the realm of what Robert Sellers calls \u2018lawyers, agents [and] flashing tempers\u2019.\n\nCubby, \u2018the large, warm, Italian New Yorker\u2019, was born in 1909, the son of Calabrian immigrants who grew vegetables, including broccoli, on a patch of land on Long Island.\n\n\u2018It was backbreaking work,\u2019 recalled Cubby, and he fled from the farm into a succession of short-term jobs: coffin maker, shampoo salesman, Christmas tree seller, nightclub bouncer and, finally, after moving to Los Angeles to stay with a cousin, assistant director for Westerns.\n\nNever lacking in confidence, Cubby soon set himself up as an independent producer of war films and historical romps.\n\nBritish actor Roger Moore on the set of the 12th James Bond film For Your Eyes Only in 1981\n\nBy 1959, he was in England, where he immediately grasped that Ian Fleming\u2019s James Bond books had potential: \u2018a resourceful hero, colourful and exotic locales, espionage and action, plus lashings of sex\u2019.\n\nAmazingly, no one else agreed. The general view was that the paperbacks were trashy potboilers, unworthy even of television adaptation.\n\nEnter Harry Saltzman, \u2018a tough, pugnacious Canadian\u2019, born in 1915 into a Jewish family in Quebec, \u2018about whom virtually nothing is known\u2019.\n\nBy the age of 15, Harry had been touring Europe on his own, managing travelling circuses. Elephants, he discovered, may cost a fortune to feed and transport, but they are what the public pays to see. Films, he\u2019d maintain, were no different: \u2018Give the public what they want. Give them elephants. Put everything up there on the screen. The bigger, the better.\u2019\n\nCubby and Harry were introduced to each other in 1961 by the playwright Wolf Mankowitz. They subsequently asked him to write the script for Dr No \u2014 and, though he complied, Wolf refused any screen credit: \u2018I don\u2019t want my name on a piece of c**p!\u2019 Little did he know the Bond films were going to be as big as The Beatles, quite eclipsing the black-and-white kitchen-sink dramas that had been the previous trend.\n\nThe two producers shook hands on a 50-50 split of the proceeds and the budgets were provided by United Artists.\n\nA company was registered in Switzerland in the names of Cubby and Harry\u2019s wives, and Harry paid extras with cash out of a suitcase, thus avoiding \u2018tax liabilities for registered employees\u2019. John Barry received \u00a3250 for his famous James Bond theme tune. Ian Fleming himself was to be paid $100,000 per film and 2.5 per cent of the net profits.\n\nActor Roger Moore on the set of 13th James Bond film Octopussy in 1983\n\nJames Bond actor Roger Moore with four women on the set of 10th film The Spy Who Loved Me in 1977\n\nWhen Harry and Cubby purchased his rights, they astutely included an option on all unpublished \u2014 even unwritten \u2014future Bond stories.\n\nWho was to incarnate the iconic 007? The list of candidates was lengthy: Stanley Baker, Adam West (Batman), Oliver Reed, Jeremy Brett (Sherlock Holmes), Terence Stamp, Patrick Mower, and even Lord Lucan, whom Cubby had met at a casino.\n\nOf course, it was Sean Connery who made the role his own \u2014 and he never forgave the producers for taking advantage of him, getting him to sign up to the series for a flat fee of \u00a36,000 initially, with no profit participation.\n\nOver the years, Cubby and Harry \u2018absolutely refused\u2019 to renegotiate the contract and Connery seethed, fully believing that he should be made their equal third partner.\n\nSuch was his \u2018pathological dislike\u2019 of the two men, Sellers tells us, that Connery refused to work if they appeared on set. He was eventually replaced as Bond by George Lazenby and, in 1973, by Roger Moore, who played the role tongue-in-cheek, \u2018as though he were sharing a joke with the audience\u2019.\n\nScottish actor Sean Connery and French actress Claudine Auger on a beach in the Bahamas in 1965 during filming for James Bond film Thunderball\n\nThe Bond phenomenon was firmly established by 1962, when President Kennedy said he had a hankering for the character. It also helped the box office enormously when the Vatican condemned the films as \u2018a dangerous mixture of violence, vulgarity, sadism and sex\u2019.\n\nBy the time of From Russia With Love, the follow-up to Dr No, in 1963, a winning formula had been established, which was not to vary with Goldfinger and Thunderball \u2014 and has not varied to this day: a very fast-paced plot, so \u2018you didn\u2019t have time to question its logic\u2019; women such as Ursula Andress in a white bikini, all treated as disposable bimbos with big boobs; flashy \u2018gadgets and high-tech gizmos\u2019 (the Aston Martin\u2019s ejector seat cost \u00a325,000 to install); and not too much dialogue \u2014 the Bond films were kinetic and easy to follow.\n\nBond was always to be seen in lavish, sunny locations or gaudy penthouse suites with goldfish swimming in the water-bed.\n\nKen Adam designed vast dwellings for the villains \u2014 volcanoes, Fort Knox, island lairs \u2014 where they\u2019d plan the destruction of the planet.\n\nAs the budgets grew, Harry, in particular, \u2018had an amazing profligacy in his enthusiasm\u2019, wanting more explosions, more chases. His catchphrase was: \u2018What are you worrying about? It\u2019s only money!\u2019\n\nIn their own working lives, the producers were grandiose. There was a luxurious set of offices in Mayfair with \u2018a private cinema done up in red leather, and a Turkish bath\u2019.\n\nSean Connery and Albert R Broccoli having a discussion of the set of James Bond film From Russia With Love in 1963\n\nSecretaries and chauffeurs were on hand around the clock. Phone bills were never less than \u00a31,000 a month, rising to $12,000 by 1966 (Sellers confusingly jumps between pounds and dollars, but, whatever the currency, it was vast).\n\nThis \u2018oddest odd couple\u2019 started to resemble each other, being flabby and short with crinkly grey hair.\n\nTheir megalomania was similar. \u2018If you don\u2019t know who I am, you have no place in showbusiness,\u2019 was how people would be addressed when Cubby and Harry were organising ad campaigns, distribution schemes and premieres.\n\nThe pair went in for dictator-sized desks, on which rested half a dozen coloured telephones. They\u2019d ostentatiously take calls from Lauren Bacall, Clark Gable, Marilyn Monroe and Greta Garbo \u2014 \u2018all seemed desperate\u2019 for the tycoons\u2019 attention.\n\nWhen Harry wanted to work on his own ideas for other films, a bust-up was inevitable.\n\nUnfortunately, his productions with Bob Hope, Richard Burton and Orson Welles lost money, as did his Battle Of Britain, which starred all the biggest British actors of the day, with the exception of Christopher Lee, because, Harry reasoned, \u2018audiences would not accept Dracula as part of the RAF\u2019.\n\nHarry \u2018cross-collateralised himself into one big financial mess\u2019, with debts of $20 million. He sold out to Cubby in December 1975, with much litigation and rancour. They parted \u2018without the two men shaking hands or saying goodbye\u2019.\n\nHarry died in 1994, living in \u2018a dimly lit apartment near Victoria Station\u2019. Cubby\u2019s sole non-Bond venture was the classic Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, written by Fleming, scripted by Roald Dahl and starring Dick Van Dyke. When the latter took time off to visit his wife in hospital, Cubby docked his pay by $80,000.\n\nCubby died in Beverly Hills in 1996. Sean Connery graciously phoned his widow \u2018to offer his condolences\u2019.", "description": "Book focuses on commercially-minded producers 'Cubby' Broccoli and Harry Saltzman as they worked to turn James Bond into a multimillion pound film.", "authors": ["Roger Lewis For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/10/21/19558598-0-image-a-10_1570740760590.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
