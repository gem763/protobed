(Mario Tama/Getty Images)\n\nThe Trump administration plans to revoke California\u2019s right to set stricter air pollution standards for cars and light trucks , according to two senior administration officials, as part of a larger effort to weaken an Obama-era climate policy aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions from the nation\u2019s auto fleet.\n\nThe move sets up another legal clash between the federal government and the nation\u2019s most populous state, which for decades under administrations of both parties exercised authority to put in place more stringent fuel economy standards. Thirteen states and the District of Columbia have vowed to adopt California\u2019s standards if they diverge from the federal government\u2019s, as have several major automakers.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest in a series of high-profile conflicts for a state accustomed to ridicule from President Trump, including legal fights over immigration, education, health care and the environment.\n\nIt also has extended to personal attacks from the president. Trump has called Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, a \u201cnasty, vindictive, horrible person.\u201d He has blamed state officials for \u201cmismanagement\u201d of forests after deadly wildfires destroyed thousands of homes and killed dozens of Californians. More recently, he has criticized the state for the handling of its homelessness crisis and threatened to intervene.\n\nLast year, the Environmental Protection Agency and Transportation Department proposed taking away the waiver that California received under the Obama administration to set tailpipe emissions for cars and pickup trucks, as part of a rule that would freeze mileage standards for these vehicles at roughly 37 miles per gallon from 2020 to 2026. The Obama-era standards had required these fleets to average nearly 51 mpg by model year 2025.\n\nIn July, California forged an agreement with four companies \u2014 Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and BMW of North America \u2014 under which they pledged to produce fleets averaging nearly 50 mpg by model year 2026.\n\n[Justice Dept. launches antitrust probe of automakers over their fuel efficiency deal with California]\n\nOne of the central arguments in the White House\u2019s proposal, said the two senior administration officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the announcement was not yet public, is that the 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act gives only the federal government the right to set fuel economy standards.\n\nBy seeking to strip California of its autonomy to set stricter standards, Trump officials are forcing auto companies to choose whether they will side with California or the federal government. As part of July\u2019s deal with the California Air Resources Board, the four carmakers agreed to support the state\u2019s right to set its own tailpipe standards.\n\nEPA declined to comment on the matter Tuesday. But in a speech to the National Automobile Dealers Association, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler made his intentions clear.\n\n\u201cWe embrace federalism and the role of the states, but federalism does not mean that one state can dictate standards for the nation,\u201d he said.\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra vowed to sue over the administration\u2019s plan to revoke California\u2019s long-standing waiver, saying the state\u2019s clean car standards are \u201cachievable, science-based, and a boon for hard-working American families and public health.\u201d\n\nThe state\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom (D), added that the Trump plan \u201ccould have devastating consequences for our kids\u2019 health and the air we breathe, if California were to roll over. But we will not \u2014 we will fight this latest attempt and defend our clean car standards. California, global markets, and Mother Nature will prevail.\u201d\n\nEnvironmentalists promised to join California in its legal opposition.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the Clean Air Act or EPA regulations providing for this unprecedented action,\u201d Martha Roberts, a senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund, said in an interview. \u201cThe legislative history is explicit about broad authority for California. This is very well established legal authority that\u2019s firmly anchored in the Clean Air Act.\u201d\n\nMarlo Lewis, a senior fellow at the conservative Competitive Enterprise Institute, predicted in an interview that the move actually could make it easier for automakers to embrace the White House\u2019s proposed rollback of gas mileage standards.\n\n\u201cThe only reason the automakers are not on board with Trump is because they\u2019re afraid of the retaliation from California if Trump loses,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThe Trump administration really has to kick the bully off the playing field, and then the automakers will start talking more sensibly.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear who would prevail in a legal fight over California\u2019s right to set tailpipe emissions. The state\u2019s air regulators have consistently argued that they are limiting carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles, rather than overtly setting mileage standards.\n\nMargo Oge, who directed EPA\u2019s Office of Transportation and Air Quality from 1994 to 2012, said in an interview that California can make a strong case that it needs to curb these pollutants because climate change worsens ozone, which helps create smog.\n\n\u201cCalifornia has demonstrated that by getting a greenhouse gas emissions waiver, it can also reduce ozone pollution, because the data is very strong,\u201d she said.\n\nBut even Obama administration officials acknowledged that efforts to curb CO2 emissions from autos are inextricably linked to stricter mileage standards. The 2010 rule published by EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration noted that nearly 95 percent of emissions from cars and light trucks stem from motor fuel combustion.\n\nAuto industry officials said they continue to hope that federal and state officials can find compromise on a single national standard, despite no evidence of a deal in sight.\n\n\u201cAutomakers have said many times that we support year-over-year increases in fuel economy standards that align with marketplace realities,\u201d said Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, \u201cand we support one national program as the best path to preserve good auto jobs and keep new vehicles affordable for more Americans.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Post last week, Wheeler said the Trump administration plans to separately finalize scaled back mileage standards for the nation\u2019s autos by the end of the year. He said he remains optimistic that the industry will embrace the latest version of the rollback. \u201cI\u2019m still hopeful that people will see that the changes we made from the proposal to the final [rule], that everyone would get on board and be supportive of what we\u2019re doing,\u201d Wheeler said.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s long-standing ability to write its own emissions standards has seldom been questioned in Washington. In part, that\u2019s because of the unique history that led to the state\u2019s unique authority.\n\nSmog in Los Angeles had become crippling at times throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s. As scientists focused on motor vehicle exhausts as a key culprit in air pollution, state officials worked to develop the nation\u2019s first vehicle emissions standards in 1966.\n\nThe following year, the state\u2019s new Republican governor, Ronald Reagan, established the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to undertake a statewide effort to address widespread air pollution.\n\nAs it crafted landmark clean air legislation for the country, Congress granted California special status, saying the state could request a \u201cwaiver\u201d to require stricter tailpipe standards if it provided a compelling reason such regulations were needed. The auto industry, then as now, expressed concern over the idea of having to meet different standards in different states, but California eventually prevailed.\n\n[Major automakers strike climate deal with California, rebuffing Trump on proposed mileage freeze]\n\nCongress has repeatedly reaffirmed that right. And in 1977, lawmakers said other states could legally adopt California\u2019s stricter car emissions standards.\n\nOver time, emissions control strategies first adopted by California \u2014 catalytic converters, oxides of nitrogen (NOX) regulations and \u201ccheck engine\u201d systems, to name a few \u2014 have become standard across the country.\n\nOver the decades, the EPA has consistently approved waivers for California. The state has applied for and received more than 130 waivers over the past 50 years, according to CARB.\n\nIn late 2007, the George W. Bush administration denied California a waiver on the grounds that capping carbon dioxide emissions did not address a specific air pollution problem for the state. The move went against the advice of some agency staffers.\n\n\u201cThe Bush administration is moving forward with a clear national solution, not a confusing patchwork of state rules, to reduce America\u2019s climate footprint from vehicles,\u201d Stephen L. Johnson, the EPA\u2019s then-administrator, said at the time.\n\nCalifornia, along with other states, challenged the denial in court. In July 2009, after President Barack Obama took office, the EPA granted the state its waiver.", "description": "The move sets up a major court fight with the nation\u2019s most populous state.", "authors": ["Juliet Eilperin", "Reporter Covering Domestic Policy", "National Affairs", "Brady Dennis", "Reporter Focusing On Environmental Policy", "Public Health Issues", "September At Pm", "Juliet Eilperin Is The Washington Post'S Senior National Affairs Correspondent", "Covering The Transformation Of Federal Environmental Policy.
