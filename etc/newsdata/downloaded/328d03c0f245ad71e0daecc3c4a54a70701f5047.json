That's thanks to customers who joined initially on zero-interest promotions transitioning to paying interest on their balances, as well as higher spending overall from card customers, CEO Michael Corbat and CFO Mark Mason said on their call with analysts.\n\n\"We're getting continued use of the card, top-of-wallet use, as evidenced by those purchase sales and the benefit of them now being interest-earning balances for us,\" said Mason, who expects that trend to continue into 2020.\n\nBut that's only one component of the credit-card strategy. The larger gambit, the fulcrum that Citi's North American retail strategy hinges on, is using targeted offers to convince its millions of card customers to expand their banking relationship with Citi.\n\nCiti, with just 687 branches, has a much smaller physical footprint than competitors like JPMorgan and Bank of America, which have several thousand a piece. But it has roughly 28 million credit-card customers in North America \u2014 second behind JPMorgan \u2014 which it views as a potential goldmine.\n\nMason explained in February, when he rolled out the plan, that only a slim portion of Citi's 28 million branded credit-card customers have a banking relationship \u2014 low single-digit penetration.\n\nThat's been changing this year. Citi has been analyzing data on its card customers to figure out what type of rewards they value most \u2014 travel points or cash back, for instance \u2014 and then hitting them with tailored promotional offers to sign on with its digital bank.\n\nIn the third quarter, Citi added $2 billion in digital deposit sales, pushing them over $4 billion for the year. Two-thirds of those deposits came from outside the bank's existing branch footprint, and half came from people who previously only had a Citi credit card.\n\nWith this strategy quickly bearing fruit, Citi is thinking bigger.\n\nCorbat and Mason hinted several times on the call that Citi will soon expand the scope of the card strategy by deploying it with its cobranded cards and retail partners. Citi has cobranded cards with American Airlines, Costco, and Expedia and provides private-label store cards to a litany of other retailers, such as Best Buy, The Home Depot, and Brooks Brothers.\n\nWhen you account for such relationships, the bank is \"touching as many as 70 million consumers across the United States virtually in every state,\" Corbat said, adding that \"we know where you live, we know what you spend, we know how much you earn. And by the way, we know who your bank is, and we can be targeting people around that.\"\n\nFor now, Citi's focus is on growing its consumer bank digitally. But when asked by analysts whether, given the early success, the firm might expand its comparatively meager branch presence to pair with the digital deposit growth, Corbat said he \"wouldn't rule out branch openings.\"\n\n\"But first, it is going to come through digital engagement,\" Corbat added.", "description": "Citi has also been targeting its 28 million credit-card customers to grow its retail bank, adding $2 billion in digital deposits during the quarter.", "authors": ["Alex Morrell"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5da603484af90973855f3353?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
