Management\u2019s rationale for staying silent until now centered at least in part on the depth of Oracle\u2019s leadership bench, said the people, who requested anonymity discussing an issue the company considers private.Hurd, 62, shares the CEO title with Safra Catz, 57, a well-regarded 20-year company veteran, who previously served as finance chief and still oversees Oracle\u2019s accounting, operations, legal and corporate development. Larry Ellison, the company\u2019s septuagenarian co-founder, handed over the CEO reins five years ago, but has never strayed far from the helm. He chairs the board, orchestrates management changes and remains deeply involved in product oversight through his role as chief technology officer. Catz and Ellison will assume Hurd\u2019s responsibilities during his leave of absence.\n\nEven so, Hurd\u2019s well-being is hardly inconsequential to Oracle\u2019s business. The usually outgoing executive oversees sales, regularly meeting with big corporate customers who spend tens of millions of dollars on Oracle\u2019s collection of software programs. Of the three top executives, he\u2019s also the most media-friendly, frequently outlining the company\u2019s vision in meetings with the press and on television.\n\nBut over the past year and a half, Hurd has curtailed public appearances and the company has taken pains to squelch discussion of his health. Late last year, Oracle downsized his responsibilities, placing most of the marketing team under Ellison, people familiar with the matter said. Bloomberg News initially contacted Oracle concerning this story on Tuesday. The company declined to comment or make any executives available. It made the announcement Wednesday, with no warning, along with first-quarter earnings, which were scheduled to be released Thursday afternoon.\n\nSecurities law can be unclear about when a company is obligated to disclose a CEO\u2019s ill health, allowing some to hold out as long as possible, while others have erred on the side of speaking out early. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission hasn\u2019t settled the question, but in general says shareholders should be told about \u201cmaterial\u201d matters, defined as issues on which \u201cthere is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable person would consider it important.\u201d The U.S. Supreme Court set a similar standard in a 1988 decision.\n\nApple Inc. gave scant and often delayed details on the cancer that took the life of its co-founder and former CEO, Steve Jobs, in 2011. More recently, some companies have been quicker to tell investors and the public about executive illnesses. That was the case with banking leaders Jamie Dimon, of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Lloyd Blankfein, of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., who were both treated for cancer while serving as CEO.\n\n\u201cThe default position for a company whenever any senior executive is facing health issues should be to disclose, because it is something investors need to know when they assess a company,\u201d said Stephen Davis, associate director of Harvard Law School\u2019s program on corporate governance. \u201cIt may not be an issue if there\u2019s a strong board, a strong succession plan, and strong investor confidence in the company. But when it\u2019s a company such as Oracle where you really have a long history of shareholders not having confidence in issues around executive pay, for instance, it\u2019s that much more important for them to know what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nHurd and Catz have been navigating Oracle through a critical time, with sales growing modestly since they became CEOs in 2014 and still hovering at just under $40 billion a year. Oracle has been blindsided by the success of cloud software entrants like Amazon.com Inc., and has been racing to catch up and woo new customers. For more than a year, Oracle has conducted layoffs and reorganizations in various business units. On Wednesday, the company reported that fiscal first-quarter revenue was little changed, trailing analysts\u2019 projections.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. said Chief Executive Officer Mark Hurd is taking a leave of absence for unspecified health-related reasons, disclosing the move along with quarterly earnings on Wednesday afternoon.The software company made the announcement a day earlier than the results were scheduled to", "authors": ["Nico Grant"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/p/common/images/favicon_new-7483e38.svg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
