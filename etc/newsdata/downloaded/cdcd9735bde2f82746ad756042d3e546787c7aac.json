And as it stands, Humana covers 4 million people under its Medicare Advantage (MA) plans. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nHumana pegged MA as an area for growth \u2014 and it appears to be paying off in the form of strong membership growth and improved cash flow. In its Q2 2019 earnings calls, Humana boasted 16% individual MA membership growth in 2019, which the payer notes is above the market growth rate and is the highest net membership increase for Humana in a decade.\n\nDespite strong market entries from insurtechs \u2014 like Clover Health and Oscar Health, which plans to expand into MA \u2014 Humana split 67% of the total new MA enrollment with other legacy payers UnitedHealthcare and Aetna between 2014 and 2018. Robust MA growth in Q2 even prompted Humana to raise its full-year operations cash flow projections from $3.1 billion to $3.3 billion. And a strong MA sector should propel Humana's long-term revenue as well, as MA enrollees are targeted to comprise over 40% of all Medicare beneficiaries by 2028, up from 34% in 2018.\n\nBut MA populations are saddled with higher clinical and social health risks than their traditional Medicare counterparts \u2014 and Microsoft's digital health boost could help Humana offset potentially high claims costs. The US is home to a growing senior population with 10,000 new Medicare enrollees a day \u2014 and that has serious cost implications for the nation's healthcare system: 80% of seniors live with at least one chronic condition, and chronic conditions are the source of 90% of the US' more than $3 trillion annual healthcare spend.\n\nHowever, it's possible that Microsoft-powered innovations in personalized, predictive, value-based care could help rein in costs for Humana: A senior could get voice notifications from a smart speaker in the days leading up to a medication refill, for instance, helping improve medication adherence \u2014 an issue that costs the US over $300 billion each year.\n\nAnd the seniors aging into Medicare today are interested in new tech for healthcare: Over 50% of baby boomers are interested in using voice assistants to access medical care or info, for example. Further, Microsoft's Azure AI could allow for sorting of members into groups based on health risks, flagging individuals with the greatest risks for possible remote patient monitoring programs, for example. We think Humana is making the right call investing in a sweeping digital health upgrade, as it will allow the company to more aggressively pursue members, while feeling more secure about its ability to manage member health costs.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
