It's a limited timescale.\n\n'I'm not sure there is a majority on the floor of the House Of Commons for a referendum before a general election but I'm a bit more nuanced about that.\n\n'I just really want to say whatever we do we've got to block No Deal, whichever is the best route.'\n\nHe added: 'I don't think there is any doubt about a referendum. If it was a general election first or a referendum first, it doesn't matter.'\n\nIn a keynote speech yesterday, Mr Corbyn stuck to his guns, saying that he still planned to demand an election within days of the Prime Minister requesting an extension from Brussels.\n\nHe promised a second referendum on Brexit, but only after Labour had won power at the polls.\n\nHowever he did not, as expected, say that Labour was 'champing at the bit' for an election, instead repeating that the party was 'ready'.\n\nThe debate on tactics is likely to dominate the next week if Mr Johnson fails to agree a Brexit deal with the EU.\n\nUnder the terms of the so-called Benn Act, the Prime Minister has to ask for an extension if there is no deal by October 19. As a result, Parliament will now sit on that day, the first time it has sat on a Saturday since the Falklands War.\n\nBut David Sassoli, president of the European Parliament, has indicated that Britain would only be granted an extension if there is a general election or a second referendum.\n\nAnd Mr Benn, the former shadow foreign secretary, has suggested that if there is no agreement, he would try to get a second referendum through the Commons on October 19.\n\nHe told BBC2's Newsnight on Wednesday: 'We have shown our capacity to take control of the order paper, so we won't be waiting just to see what the Prime Minister has in store for us.\n\nAllies of Jeremy Corbyn (pictured yesterday) are putting pressure on him to support the strategy as they fear that holding a general election first could result in a Tory victory\n\n'This is a big opportunity for Parliament to say we can find a way forward and a confirmatory referendum is the way to do it.'\n\nMargot James, a former Tory MP who was expelled for opposing No Deal, indicated she would back a second vote.\n\n'It is vital that this time we actually do something concrete,' she said. 'I could support the Theresa May deal with a confirmatory referendum.'\n\nShadow Treasury minister Anneliese Dodds said: 'If we have that extension we would need to show it was for a reason \u2013 to have democratic input. Whether that is a general election or a confirmatory referendum is something we have been discussing.'\n\nYesterday, former chancellor Philip Hammond told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he did not support the idea of an election before Brexit had been resolved and said it was 'ironic' that MPs were being asked to 'turn the Government out'.\n\nHe said: 'I don't think an election solves our problem here. I would not support an election at the moment.'\n\nThe ex-Chancellor said a confirmatory referendum 'is not my preferred option', but did not rule one out.", "description": "John McDonnell has suggested he could support a second Brexit referendum taking place before a general election as a Remainer bid to force another national ballot gathered steam.", "authors": ["Jack Maidment", "Deputy Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/11/16/19596468-0-image-a-14_1570809378737.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
