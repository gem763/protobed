Completed last year, the home near Bristol, England, where Mr. Henry now lives, listed last month for \u00a31.575 million (US$1.965 million). Richard Brooks from Savills has the listing.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was very dated, very tired [and] very rundown,\u201d Mr. Henry said.\n\n\n\nMr. Henry said he was ultimately drawn to the home\u2019s location in Sneyd Park, three miles northwest of Bristol city center. \u201cIt presented a great opportunity to buy a house in that location at a price that I probably couldn\u2019t afford if it had been all modernized,\u201d Mr. Henry said.\n\n\n\nDesignated as Quaker land, Sneyd Park is an ideal family neighborhood free of bars or pubs, Mr. Brooks said. The house is also situated adjacent to the Durdham Down nature reserve.\n\n\n\nMore: Whisper Listings Can Mean Deals to Buyers, but Most Benefits Go to the Seller\n\nMr. Henry said the 3,777-square-foot house is a bit big for him and his new partner, but is move-in ready for someone who wants or needs the space. \u201cMy house is crying out for a family to enjoy it,\u201d Mr. Henry said.\n\n\n\nThe five-bedroom, five-bathroom home features three en-suite bedrooms and bathrooms, including the master bedroom, which spans the entirety of the third floor. The master bedroom also features a Juliet balcony that looks over an artificial grass terrace supported by fiberglass flooring offering elevated views of the gardens.\n\n\n\nThe rest of the house boasts high vaulted ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows and underfloor heating.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe kitchen/breakfast/family space is very much designed for family living,\u201d Mr. Henry said.\n\n\n\nFrom Penta: Art by Women Remains Underrepresented\n\nThere is also a home gym, a raised sundeck with a concealed hot tub and a garage.\n\n\n\nMr. Henry and his partner are planning to move to the Cotswolds, he said.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Miabelle Salzano"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-109276?width=1280", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
