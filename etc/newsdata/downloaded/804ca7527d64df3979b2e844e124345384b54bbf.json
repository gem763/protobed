Over the course of four days, he said he was hog-tied, beaten and cut repeatedly by more than a dozen Russians in civilian clothes.\n\nWhen he wouldn\u2019t confess to being a rebel, one of the Russians hacked off his finger, he said. Nearby, he saw another man, with two fingers missing, lying in a pool of blood, he said. The United Nations alerted the Central African government about allegations of \u201cdetention and torture\u201d carried out by \u201cindividuals of Russian nationality\u201d and shared documents supporting the claims with government officials.\n\nRussia\u2019s foreign ministry called the claims \u201cbogus.\u201d\n\n\u201cRussia provides its assistance in strict accordance\u201d with international law to \u201cbring about a lasting settlement of the protracted violent conflict,\u201d it said in a statement.\n\nMr. Prigozhin\u2019s spokesman also dismissed the allegations. In a statement, he said that French forces, which have also been accused of human rights abuses in the country in the past, had paid a militant to lie about being tortured, calling it \u201ca fictional incident that discredits Russian citizens.\u201d\n\nFor now, the peace accord that the Russians helped broker mostly seems to be holding. But many victims of atrocities wonder whether they will see justice, especially now that warlords are in government and rebel fighters are being incorporated into the military.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like death has become banal here,\u201d said Pasquale Serra, an artist from Bangui who organized a ceremony for families to place bricks in a circle, representing their lost loved ones.", "description": "After meddling in the 2016 American election, Russia is using similar tactics in the Central African Republic.
