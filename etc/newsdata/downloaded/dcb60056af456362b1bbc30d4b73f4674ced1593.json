Let's check out the new shows and what the charts say.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of NFLX, below, we can see that the past three months of price action has been less than kind to the stock. Prices started their decline with a big downside price gap. Prices have continued to work lower and look like they have pushed more than halfway down into support from December. It is now more likely that this support area will be broken. NFLX is below the declining 50-day moving average line as well as the slightly declining 200-day line.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been weak the past three months telling us that sellers of NFLX have been more aggressive. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is bearish.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of NFLX, below, we can see that a weekly close below $250 will probably complete a large top pattern. The 40-week moving average line is flat and poised to turn south.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is bearish as is the MACD oscillator.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of NFLX, below, we can see a possible downside price objective of $224 being projected.\n\nBottom-line strategy: The trend is down and one should not try to pick a low or a bottom.
