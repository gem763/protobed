Subscribe here.\n\n\u2018WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN.\u2019 Thus did America\u2019s Commander-in-Chief at long last enunciate a Trump doctrine, his use of all caps suggesting that this time he really means it.\n\nTrump had run out of patience. \u2018I held off this fight for almost 3 years,\u2019 he tweeted on October 7, \u2018but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars\u2026 and bring our soldiers home.\u2019 Withdrawing US troops from Syria, a decision he first announced last December but then allowed to lapse, marked a first substantive step toward fulfilling one of the central promises of his 2016 presidential campaign. Yet if the mandarins of the foreign policy establishment have any say in the matter, that promise will retain its place on the long list of things that Trump vowed to do as president but has come nowhere close to accomplishing.\n\nTrump\u2019s latest stab at ending endless wars has elicited from that establishment a horrified response. Here if nowhere else, Democrats and Republicans find common cause. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, whose deference to Trump is typically somewhere between submissive and supine, spoke for many when he called upon the president to \u2018exercise American leadership\u2019. Properly deciphered, McConnell\u2019s message to the Commander-in-Chief means this: \u2018You may think our endless wars are ridiculous, but they are also sacrosanct; don\u2019t go messing with them.\u2019\n\nMy bet is that McConnell and the bipartisan hosts comprising the stay-the-course chorus will get their way. Time and again, Trump has shown that on matters related to national security he is easily rolled. Out of Nato? Didn\u2019t happen. Putting a stop to European free-riding? Nope. Leaving Afghanistan? Don\u2019t hold your breath. Peace on the Korean Peninsula? Nothing but flamboyant gestures. Theodore Roosevelt once snottily charged William McKinley with having \u2018no more backbone than a chocolate \u00e9clair\u2019. The insult fits Trump better than it did McKinley even if in Trump\u2019s case the pastry is not only soft but noisome.\n\nWhether or not the president sticks to his guns by pulling US troops out of Syria, the Trump doctrine deserves some serious reflection. Although Trump himself possesses at best a rudimentary familiarity with his country\u2019s history, he is in this instance resuscitating a central tenet of an American military tradition that has recently gone missing.\n\nHowever infelicitous his phrasing, Trump promises to revive an approach to war to which Ulysses S. Grant and Franklin Roosevelt adhered back when they demanded that their adversaries surrender unconditionally. He is echoing Douglas MacArthur, who famously declared that: \u2018There is no substitute for victory.\u2019 He is harkening back to the canonical lessons of Vietnam as articulated by Reagan-era defense secretary Caspar Weinberger who in 1984 insisted that US troops would never again go into battle unless the nation had a \u2018clear intention of winning\u2019. He is even doing a fair imitation of George W. Bush, who in announcing the 2003 invasion of Iraq assured his fellow citizens that in the ensuing campaign \u2018We will accept no outcome but victory\u2019.\n\nOnce upon a time, the American way of war was all about winning. Today it has come to mean something quite different. Once the United States fought wars to end them. Today it seemingly fights wars to perpetuate them.\n\nTo his credit, Trump has apparently intuited that there\u2019s something amiss here. For this Commander-in-Chief, any war that drags on and on is by definition a failure.\n\nYet few members of the present day national security establishment are inclined to see things that way. They have come to accept long wars as tolerable \u2014 indeed, to appropriate Sen. McConnell\u2019s phrase, as concrete manifestations of \u2018American leadership\u2019. Keeping US forces in Syria, uncomfortably wedged in between Turks, Kurds, the regime of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, and the remnants of Isis, with Russia and Iran lurking in the wings, apparently satisfies this conception of what it means to \u2018lead\u2019.\n\nTrump ain\u2019t buying. Having suckered plenty of others during his career as a highflying real estate developer, he knows a bum deal when he sees one. Yet the problem with Trump \u2014 OK, one of the many problems \u2014 is that he is clueless about how to translate his aversion to endless war into anything akin to a plausible basis for policy. He possesses neither the intellectual capacity nor the attention span needed to devise an approach to \u2018American leadership\u2019 that is not centered on the continuous use or threatened use of force. So while Trump\u2019s anti-war instincts have considerable merit, he is incapable of translating instinct into anything remotely approximating an alternative strategy.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that \u2018American leadership\u2019 badly needs a makeover. The conception that currently prevails in Washington (the Oval Office excepted) rests upon a series of propositions that are no longer operative. Those propositions date from the immediate aftermath of the Cold War when American elites persuaded themselves that the political, military, economic and cultural primacy of the United States was all but assured.\n\nAll that was needed to sustain these uniquely favorable circumstances was for the United States to assert itself, thereby demonstrating that no plausible alternative to a US-dominated global order existed. After 9/11, however, that claim crashed and burned, primarily in Iraq, but also in Afghanistan, Libya, Somalia and sundry other locales where the misuse of American military power produced chaos and undermined US credibility on a scale far greater than will result from Trump\u2019s abandonment of the Kurds.\n\nIt\u2019s a perplexing argument. Betraying the Kurds (yet again), we are told, will adversely affect the reputation of the United States. Yet how much of that reputation remains, given the way that successive administrations have botched multiple wars, which have together claimed several hundred thousand victims and wasted trillions of dollars? Even today, apart from Trump himself, few figures in Washington are willing to acknowledge the scope of the self-inflicted wounds that the United States has sustained since 9/11.\n\nPresident Trump is an unlikely source of truth, to put it mildly. But the abject refusal of others in Washington to admit to truths that are readily at hand is an even bigger problem.\n\nThis article is in The Spectator\u2019s November 2019 US edition.
