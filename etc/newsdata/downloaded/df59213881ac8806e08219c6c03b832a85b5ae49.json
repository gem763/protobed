Ronan O'Connell/CNN\n\nSpread across more than three hectares (about 323,000 square feet), Tu Khanh is filled with gardens, shaded courtyards, ornate pagodas and stately pavilions.\n\nMost of the buildings are constructed from dark-colored ironwood, with intricately-carved eaves sitting beneath steep roofs topped by terracotta tiles.\n\nOne of the first monuments visitors will discover inside the temple's sprawling, manicured grounds is a stone statue of a crane standing on the back of a turtle.\n\nTurtles have been cherished by Hanoi residents for centuries. In local mythology, these shelled creatures represent longevity and are viewed as icons of Vietnam's success across its many fights for independence.\n\nThis statue is one of more than 50 stone and metal monuments scattered throughout Tu Khanh, which was built in the 1650s.\n\nAmong them are three large brass bells cast in the early 19th century and a cluster of steles (stone towers) that are variously dedicated to Buddhist gods and scholarly luminaries born in Dong Ngac.\n\nA history of academic excellence\n\nDespite being tiny -- the village is less than one square meter in size and home to 1,000 or so people -- Dong Ngac has birthed an unusually large number of academic high achievers, including dozens of doctors of literature.\n\nThese include Pham Gia Khiem, Vietnam's deputy prime minister from 1997 to 2011, and Hoang Tang Bi, a revered writer and social activist in the early 1900s.\n\nTo this day, families here compete fiercely against each other to rear the most outstanding pupils.\n\nSo valued is Dong Ngac for producing influential scholars that it has been presented with dozens of royal awards, dating as far back as Vietnam's Le Dynasty period (1428-1788).\n\nRelated content 30 of Vietnam's most beautiful places\n\nThe village's literary tradition is even celebrated via its architecture. Symbols of books are carved into the old gates that sit at each end of its four hamlets.\n\nScattered throughout these hamlets are almost 100 homes, the oldest of which date back to the early 1600s. The complexity of their stonemasonry and woodwork captivates as one walks through its nest of narrow lanes, being greeted by smiles and waves from residents, who share treats like piping hot lotus tea and Banh Gio rice dumplings, two of local specialties.\n\nHeading to Hanoi? Here's a look at five of the top dishes every visitor needs to try while in the Vietnamese capital -- egg coffee included.\n\nDong Ngac Communal House is the hub of the village.\n\nFor almost 400 years, this complex has hosted Dong Ngac's most significant events and acted as a place of worship. Built in the first half of the 1600s, it was designed to look from above like the head of a dragon. Its ironwood prayer hall is intended to represent the dragon's skull, with the main gate being its nose and two water wells acting as its eyes.\n\nThe central hall houses a prized collection of Le Dynasty art works, which cover themes of Vietnamese agriculture, commerce, fishing, artistry and, of course, literature.\n\nEvery day Dong Ngac locals kneel here in the grounds of their Communal House to not just pray to Buddhist gods, but also to remember the academics who built Dong Ngac's lofty reputation.\n\nGetting there\n\nDong Ngac is located in the northern suburbs of the Vietnamese capital Hanoi. From Hanoi's main tourist precinct, the Old Quarter, the village is about 30 minutes' away by taxi.", "description": "Far from the tourist trail on the outskirts of Hanoi lies Dong Ngac.
