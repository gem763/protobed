Here\u2019s what happened.", "language": "en", "text": "Inside each envelope was a check for $100, $250 or $500, with the \u201cpay to the order of\u201d section left blank.\n\n\u201cI want you to take these gifts of grace and go out and bless the world,\u201d Johns recalled telling church members on Sept. 8. \u201cDo something meaningful with these checks. If you can, multiply them \u2014 add some money of your own or put in some sweat equity. Think of ways that you can make the most impact.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nJohns said every person in the church, located in Kenwood, Ohio, was beaming with excitement.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhen they opened the envelopes and saw the checks, one man described it as a \u2018happy burden,\u2019\u201d said Johns. \u201cEveryone realized the seriousness of doing the very best they could with the money to make the most difference.\u201d\n\nIn all, $60,000 was handed out to about 250 families that day to give to any needy person or charity they desired.\n\nThe money was a portion of a larger sum bequeathed to the Good Shepherd church by Ruth Grassman, a longtime parishioner with no children who had quietly built up her savings over the years. Grassman died in May 2018, just a few months shy of her 100th birthday, Johns said.\n\n\u201cAfter the church received the money she\u2019d left us a year ago, I started thinking about ways to involve the congregation in using some of Ruth\u2019s generous gift,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nJohns recalled reading a story about a check giveaway project, in which the Preston Meadow Lutheran Church in Plano, Tex., gave away cash with instructions to go forth and do good with the money. She decided to do something similar.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was so exciting last month to finally surprise everyone with a check and then find out what they planned to do with the money,\u201d said Johns, 55.\n\nAfter she encouraged parishioners to leave stories about their experiences on the church\u2019s website, the results soon started flowing in.\n\n\u201cSome people gave their checks to hurricane relief, homeless shelters, care of the environment and animals or food pantries that feed hungry people,\u201d Johns said. \u201cThen there were people who know someone close to them who has gotten sick, lost a job or has medical bills they can\u2019t pay, so they put their checks to use helping them.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt was a heartwarming experience to see what everyone came up with,\u201d she said.\n\nAfter drawing a check for $250, Rachel and David Bea decided to match it and spend $500 on toys, books, socks and snacks to create 20 \u201csmile bags\u201d for children in need. With help from their children, Arleigh, 5, and Jaren, 4, they put the bags together and handed them out to kids they spotted at their local park or food pantry who they thought might be able to use them, said Rachel Bea, 37.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe wanted our kids to learn the impact of giving rather than receiving, and to experience how wonderful it feels to help others,\u201d she said. \u201cI had Arleigh make a little card to put in each bag that says, \u2018Smile.\u2019\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI felt proud to do it,\u201d Arleigh said. \u201cIt was a lot of fun.\u201d\n\n\u201cI felt really happy,\u201d Jaren added. \u201cIt made me feel good inside.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne of the best things about this is that the kids didn\u2019t ask once to keep any of the toys for themselves,\u201d Rachel Bea said.\n\nKatie and Ron Zink contributed $150 of their own money to a homeless shelter and let their two daughters, Josie, 14, and Sara, 12, decide how to spend their $100 check from the church.\n\nBoth girls had made sandwiches in the past at their school for a bag lunch program offered by St. Francis Seraph Ministries in Cincinnati, said Katie Zink, 41.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThey decided that would be the best use of the money, especially since the program helps day laborers who can\u2019t afford to buy themselves a lunch,\u201d she said. \u201cMost of these people don\u2019t make more than $35 a day.\u201d\n\nFor Bill and Kathy Shuman, there was no question where they would use their $500 check. The retired couple volunteers every week at Cincinnati\u2019s William Howard Taft Elementary School, where the majority of the students qualify for free or reduced lunch.\n\nAfter volunteering one afternoon earlier this year, Kathy Shuman stopped to talk to the music teacher and learned about a special need for rhythm instruments, said Bill Shuman, 72.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d been struggling the past few months, hoping to find a way to help him to realize that dream, and then we happened to get that $500 check,\u201d said Bill Shuman.\n\nAD\n\nThe pair purchased enough recorders for every student in the third to sixth grades, along with several sets of percussion tubes.\n\n\u201cPlaying music helps the kids with academics, helps them establish focus and gives them a positive way to burn off some steam,\u201d said teacher Dan Larkin Jr., who has 300 music students.\n\nHe said the gift was completely unexpected.\n\n\u201cWhat a tremendous surprise,\u201d Larkin said. \u201cI\u2019m beyond grateful.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "\"I want you to take these gifts of grace and go out and bless the world,\" the pastor told church members.", "authors": ["Cathy Free"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/nB6oUB6zMMVfEkYisJPXGsSsCzw=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7VCWMIH76FHJLM6HRO623OIXDY.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
