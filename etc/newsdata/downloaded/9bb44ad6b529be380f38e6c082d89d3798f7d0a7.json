Block.one paid a fee that amounted to just 1% of the USD 4 billion it raised in what the SEC labeled an \u201cunregistered\u201d ICO in 2017-2018.", "description": "Telegram\u2019s much-anticipated TON network launch and the release of its Gram token could be delayed for \u201csix months to a year,\u201d investors in the project have been told.
