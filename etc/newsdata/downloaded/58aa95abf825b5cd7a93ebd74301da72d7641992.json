By sharing details of the phone, the technology giant was attempting to take back the narrative from the leakers, gossips and rumour merchants that fill the pages of the tech press in the build-up to a major product launch.\n\nBut the limited amount of information imparted only seemed to serve as bait, with publications picking apart each picture to determine what hardware features to expect. Along with dual-rear cameras, the images also revealed an additional sensor that became noticeable when the contrast of one image was adjusted.\n\nMoreover, Google's revelations didn't prevent the usual slew of rumours, with Google and its production partners seemingly more leaky than dear Liza's bucket.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe official unveiling of the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL will take place on 15 October at an event in New York City, but with little left to announce it will likely be almost entirely ceremonial. For those not keen on sitting through a two hour presentation, The Independent has a run down of everything that's expected to be announced.\n\nImproved camera\n\nAs with most smartphone makers this year, the main upgrade for Google's latest device will almost certainly be the camera.\n\nBoth the front- and rear-facing cameras will see considerable improvements, with an additional 16-megapixel telephoto lens at the back being complimented by complex sensors at the front that will enable the same depth-aware facial recognition that is featured on the latest iPhones.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

A camera block at the back is reminiscent of the iPhone 11's setup and houses both lenses and sensors.\n\nLeaked photos also seem to show that there is no longer a fingerprint reader on the rear of the device, though this may still be featured beneath the screen itself.\n\nThere will three colours for the Pixel 4: 'just black', 'clearly white' and 'oh so orange'. There may also be a 'mint green' version of the phone, though this is not certain.\n\nAndroid 10 and a 5G version\n\nGoogle's latest mobile operating system was announced in August, revealing a complete overhaul to the world's most popular software. As always, Google's own devices were the first to include Android 10 and so there is no doubt it will appear on the two new Pixel 4 phones.\n\nOne of the most highly-anticipated features of Android 10 is Live Caption, which uses artificial intelligence to automatically transcribe speech from audio or videos playing on the phone.\n\nWhilst fundamentally an accessibility feature, allowing deaf and hard-of-hearing users to better consume content, it will also be a perk to anyone hoping to surreptitiously watch videos without disturbing those around them.\n\nGoogle is also reportedly working on a 5G version of the Pixel 4, according to Nikkei Asian Review, which would see the tech giant beat its old foe Apple to releasing a next-generation device.\n\nRelease date and price\n\nWhile the date of the announcement is already known, it is not clear yet when the phones will actually be released. If past Pixel cycles are anything to go by, pre-orders will open the day of the unveiling, with the release date coming before the end of the month.\n\nLast year, the Pixel 3 was revealed on 9 October and released nine days later on 18 October.\n\nNo amount of leaks have given a certain indication of the exact price of the new phones, though listings discovered by 9to5Google suggest the Pixel 4 will cost 820 euros (\u00a3727) and the Pixel 4 XL will be 1,127 euros (\u00a3999).", "description": "Google made the unusual move earlier this year of publishing images of its upcoming Pixel 4 smartphone \u2013 months ahead of its expected release date.
