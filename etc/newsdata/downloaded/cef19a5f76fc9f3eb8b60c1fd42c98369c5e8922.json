NSANY -0.57% Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa on Thursday said he will return a portion of his performance-based pay, after Nissan auditors found that the amount was too high.\n\nThe pay was in the form of stock appreciation rights, a cash payment linked to the increase in the price of the company\u2019s shares over a period of time. Mr. Saikawa received a higher payment than he was entitled to, because the execution date of those rights was changed to a date when the share price was higher.\n\nThe change netted Mr. Saikawa more than $400,000 in additional payments, according to Greg Kelly, the former Nissan executive in charge of the payment calculation. Mr. Saikawa said he will return the overpayment.\n\nMr. Saikawa\u2019s appreciation rights have been under scrutiny since June, when Mr. Kelly said the payout date of Mr. Saikawa\u2019s 2013 appreciation rights was pushed back by a week so the payout would be higher. Mr. Kelly said the payment was used to purchase property in Tokyo. Mr. Kelly made the comments in an interview with Bungei Shunju, a Japanese magazine.\n\nMr. Kelly is accused by Japanese prosecutors of underreporting former Nissan Chairman Carlos Ghosn\u2019s compensation. Mr. Kelly has said he is innocent.\n\nMr. Saikawa said Thursday that Mr. Kelly was in charge of calculating the stock appreciation rights, and that he thought it had been calculated correctly. Mr. Saikawa was speaking to reporters gathering outside his Tokyo apartment on Thursday morning.\n\nRepresentatives for Mr. Kelly didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nNissan auditors plan to present their findings to the company\u2019s board when it meets on Monday. The report does not say that Mr. Saikawa committed any wrongdoing, said a person familiar with the report\u2019s findings. The auditors found that other Nissan executives also received payments that were higher than they should have been, this person said.\n\nWrite to Sean McLain at sean.mclain@wsj.com", "description": "Nissan Motor Co.Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa on Thursday said he will return a portion of his performance-based pay, after Nissan auditors found that the amount was too high.", "authors": ["Sean Mclain", "Sean.Mclain Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-104109/social"}
