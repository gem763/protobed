Smith Mentions Israel-Palestine Conflict", "language": "en", "text": "The \"First Take\" commentator brought up the topic during a discussion about Daryl Morey's controversial tweet\n\nFollowing its precedent of trying to separate sports and politics even when they clearly overlap, ESPN cut to a break when Stephen A. Smith brought up the Israel-Palestine conflict while discussing the NBA\u2019s ongoing situation in China yesterday.\n\nAppearing on an episode of First Take, Smith segued from a discussion about Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet and the controversy it has caused to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict before co-host Molly Qerim stepped in.\n\n\u201cBefore we close,\u201d Smith said, \u201cI would remind you that, throughout this world, one of the things that exists is the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I don\u2019t see folks outside of the Jewish community talking about that too often.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when Qerim stepped in.\n\nWow. @stephenasmith, in a heated discussion with @maxkellerman on the NBA-China-Hong Kong controversy on brings up the Israeli-Palestinian conflict before being cut off. pic.twitter.com/ICI7iF7UUU \u2014 Eric Demamp (@ericdemamp) October 8, 2019\n\nThe incident shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise given that ESPN senior news director Chuck Salituro ealier this week sent a memo to staff \u201cmandating that any discussion of the Daryl Morey story avoid any political discussions about China and Hong Kong, and instead focus on the related basketball issues.\u201d\n\nThe whole situation is reminiscent of what happened with Dan LeBatard, another ESPN personality who was silenced (temporarily) after talking politics and calling out the network\u2019s reluctance to discuss them.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a racial division in this country that\u2019s being instigated by the president and we here at ESPN haven\u2019t had the stomach for that fight,\u201d the veteran TV and radio host said during a rant in July. \u201cJemele [Hill] did some things on Twitter and \u2026 all of a sudden nobody talks politics on anything unless we can use one of these sports figures as a meat-shield in the most cowardly way possible to discuss these subjects. We won\u2019t talk about it unless Russell Wilson is saying something about it on his Instagram page. Then we have the power to run with it. Weak-ass shield.\u201d\n\nLeBatard was off the air for a few days over the summer but has since resumed his regular broadcast schedule.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.\n\nRead the full story at The New York Post", "description": "On \"First Take,\"\u00a0Smith segued from a discussion about Rockets GM Daryl Morey's tweet and the controversy it caused to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1131925389-e1570633698549.jpg?fit=916%2C611", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
