They found Pak dead at the scene with trauma to her upper body.\n\nAn initial investigation found that Oh and Pak were in a \u201cdispute prior to the murder.\u201d Police said that Oh \u201cstruck the victim multiple times with a brick.\u201d Oh then called 911, police said.\n\nPak\u2019s eldest grandson, Andy Kwon, said that when he heard of the death, he instantly became angry as he wondered \u201cwho in their right mind, or what kind of evil, had to creep up to take my grandmother\u2019s life?\u201d\n\n\n\nChun Oh is charged in the killing of her 82-year-old neighbor in Maryland, police said. (Prince George's County police)\n\nAnger turned to shock when he heard that another elderly woman was accused of the crime.\n\nKwon said his family is left with memories of his grandmother, a single mother from South Korea who followed her only son to the United States in the 1980s and was the linchpin of their family.\n\nWhen each of her nine grandchildren was born, Pak joined their households to take care of the children while their parents worked, said Kwon, who is stationed with the Army at Fort Bragg.\n\nOne of his fondest memories was watching his tiny grandmother accompany him on the four-mile walk to his Rockville home after martial arts practice, carrying his heavy duffel bag filled with gear.\n\n\u201cShe helped raise all of us,\u201d Kwon said. \u201cShe literally bounced from house to house to take care of her grandchildren.\u201d\n\nPak became a great-grandmother of three, and whenever any of her children or grandchildren came to visit her apartment, Kwon said, his grandmother prepared \u201ca smorgasbord\u201d of traditional Korean delicacies she laid out across her six-foot dining table: short ribs, mild and spicy pork belly, stuffed pancakes, egg-crusted fried fish, and Kwon\u2019s favorite, spicy beef soup.\n\n\u201cEvery inch of that table was filled with food,\u201d Kwon said. \u201cShe gave up so much of her youth and her later life for us.\u201d\n\nOfficials said Oh is charged with first- and second-degree murder and is being held with no bond at the Department of Corrections. The Prince George\u2019s County Police Department investigates all homicides in Bladensburg.\n\nKwon said the majority of his family is deeply religious and wanted to keep the woman arrested \u2014 who Kwon said was not someone he knew \u2014 in their prayers.\n\n\u201cWe would also like to extend a prayer to this lady; God is our creator, and in the end, he judges us by everything we say and do,\u201d Kwon said. \u201cHer judgment will be before God. We pray God will show mercy to her.\u201d\n\nMagda Jean-Louis contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "The victim, 82, and the assailant were involved in a dispute, police said.", "authors": ["Clarence Williams", "Local Reporter Covering Crime", "Breaking News", "Public Safety Issues", "Dana Hedgpeth", "Reporter Covering Local Breaking News", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ef7qExMGvsaFME0NoCdsuhKwjjc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/63WVB7XYQAI6PGXXUUF4GMAAII.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
