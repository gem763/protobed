Because Americans have a very odd folk morality, in which being authentic is as important or more important than being appropriate or good. He makes sure his audience knows he is a jokester, an occasional thug, a self-serving cad, and even a liar. He lives up to his own billing \u2014 and Americans appreciate getting the genuine article.\n\nIf a President Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren said \u201clock her up\u201d from the West Wing, one could safely assume that someone would be imprisoned that very night. When President Trump says something like that, I wait for some kind of confirmation or action from the White House or the executive branch.\n\nMost of the time, it never comes.", "description": "", "authors": ["M.B.
