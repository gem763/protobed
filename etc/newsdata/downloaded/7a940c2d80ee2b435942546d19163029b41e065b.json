Their brains\u2019 default mode network \u2013 which is often involved in ageing and mental disease \u2013 also benefitted from stronger functional connectivity.\n\nIn addition, tea-drinkers\u2019 brains also had more symmetric connections between hemispheres, and resembled a middle-aged person\u2019s brain more than an elderly person\u2019s.\n\nIn the paper, the scientists said the anti-aging benefits of tea came from catechin, a natural antioxidant that boosts the brain\u2019s memory and reasoning functions.\n\nThey added that their research showed drinking tea could be a simple lifestyle choice that greatly benefits brain health.\n\nAsst Prof Feng and his team plan to examine the effects of tea as well as the bioactive compounds in tea can have on cognitive decline.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - Go ahead, take that tea break..
