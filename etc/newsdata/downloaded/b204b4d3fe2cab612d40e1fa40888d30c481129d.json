U.S. Officials: No, We\u2019re Just Stepping Out of Turkey's Way.", "language": "en", "text": "Despite a surge of anti-war rhetoric from President Donald Trump and a confusing interview with Defense Secretary Mark Esper, two knowledgeable U.S. officials confirm that the U.S. troop presence in Syria still isn\u2019t ending.\n\nThey\u2019re just withdrawing further away from the advance of Turkish forces massacring the Syrian Kurds whom America relied upon to destroy the so-called Islamic State\u2019s caliphate, the officials said.\n\nThere are currently 1,000 U.S. troops in Syria. A knowledgeable U.S. official said hundreds of those troops, without further specificity, will leave Syria for elsewhere in the Mideast. Following a pullout from two northern Syrian observation posts last week, the U.S. will now retreat further away from the area Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has invaded.\n\nEsper suggested a full pullout, telling CBS\u2019 Margaret Brennan on Sunday that U.S. forces are about to execute \u201ca deliberate withdrawal of forces from northern Syria\u201d and \u201cpreparing to evacuate\u201d northern Syria \u201cas safely and quickly as possible.\u201d\n\nBrennan noted that the northern part of Syria, near the Turkish border, is where the vast majority of U.S. forces in Syria operate. But in fact, the two U.S. officials tell The Daily Beast that the U.S. is still not getting out of Syria, even as Trump\u2014who separately has ordered about 14,000 U.S. troops to the Persian Gulf region over the past six months\u2014rails against the disastrous, bloody and interminable U.S. misadventure in the Middle East over the past generation.\n\n\u201cThe situation is fluid, but in the context of the statement, it was only out of northern Syria,\u201d a Pentagon official said.\n\nA U.S. official told CNN that U.S. policy \u201chas failed\u201d and that the campaign in Syria to defeat ISIS is \u201cover for now,\u201d giving the terrorist group \u201ca second lease on life with nearly 100,000 [people] who will re-join their jihad.\u201d\n\nThe mixed messaging by the Trump administration is making it difficult for even his most ardent supporters to help unravel his foreign policy on Syria as it spins out of control.\n\nJust days after Trump announced the withdrawal of American troops from northern Syria where they have been providing weapons and cover to allied Kurdish fighters on the border between Turkey and Syria, Turkey began a military incursion that has sent the region into a level of chaos it has not seen in recent years.\n\nThe Daily Beast first reported Friday that claims made by the Trump administration that U.S. troops had been withdrawn were false. \u201cWe are out of there. We\u2019ve been out of there for a while,\u201d Trump said Wednesday. \u201cNo soldiers whatsoever.\u201d Two officials told The Daily Beast that in fact the U.S. military had only pulled back\u2013not completely out\u2013of northern Syria. They had simply abandoned two small observation posts from which they supported Kurdish allies in the fight against Islamic State fighters.\n\nTrump Says U.S. Troops Have Quit Syria. It\u2019s Not True.\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump then tweeted that he had been talking with Senator Lindsey Graham (R\u2013SC), who had been highly critical of Trump\u2019s decision to remove troops. \u201cPray for our Kurdish allies who have been shamelessly abandoned by the Trump administration. This move ensures the reemergence of ISIS,\u201d Graham warned Wednesday. \u201cI urge President Trump to change course while there is still time by going back to the safe zone concept that was working.\u201d\n\nGraham later tweeted that any sanctions had to be serious. \u201cThe conditional sanctions announced today will be viewed by Turkey as a tepid response and will embolden Erdogan even more,\u201d Graham tweeted Friday. \u201cThe Turkish government needs to know Congress will take a different path\u2013passing crippling sanctions in a bipartisan fashion.\u201d\n\nBut in a Sunday morning tweet, the president wrote that he was working with Graham \u201cand many members of Congress, including Democrats, about imposing powerful Sanctions on Turkey.\u201d\n\nHe then added: \u201cTreasury is ready to go, additional legislation may be sought. There is great consensus on this. Turkey has asked that it not be done. Stay tuned!\u201d\n\nTurkey has warned that any threats of sanctions would be met with the release of millions of refugees along the border between Turkey and Syria into Europe. Trump told reporters at the White House earlier this week that it did not concern him. \u201cWell they're going to be escaping to Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s where they want to go, they want to go back to their homes.\u201d", "description": "Khalil Ashawi/ReutersDespite a surge of anti-war rhetoric from President Donald Trump and a confusing interview with Defense Secretary Mark Esper, two knowledgeable U.S. officials confirm that the U.S. troop presence in Syria still isn\u2019t ending.They\u2019re just withdrawing further away from the advance of", "authors": ["Spencer Ackerman", "Justin Baragona", "Barbie Latza Nadeau"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rf3a4EqOZDTw5_ly0uQBaA--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/34c69ebc636ef16c68ae43757f1469bc", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
