We\u2019ll update these projections every week through the end of the season to try to give you an idea where your favorite team could be playing in the postseason.\n\nThe first edition starts with a College Football Playoff field that looks familiar. Each of Alabama, Clemson, Ohio State and Oklahoma have made the playoff in the previous three seasons and, at the moment, we have them in this year\u2019s bracket.\n\nThat could change, of course. If the loser of LSU-Alabama on Nov. 9 ends the season at 11-1 and there\u2019s some chaos in other Power Five conferences the SEC could end up getting two teams in the playoff again and leave two conferences out of the playoff.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWe also can\u2019t ignore Oregon either. The Ducks are on a roll since losing to Auburn in Week 1. Oregon could end up higher than some expect when the first edition of the playoff rankings come out on Nov. 5.\n\nLet\u2019s get to the projections. These are done by conference affiliation and taking in mind teams\u2019 current records and their projected records at the end of the season. It\u2019s also important to note that ESPN owns a vast majority of the bowl games and can move teams around to create better matchups independent of those affiliations.\n\nCollege Football Playoff\n\nFiesta Bowl, Dec. 28\n\nClemson vs. Ohio State\n\n\n\nPeach Bowl, Dec. 28\n\nAlabama vs. Oklahoma\n\n\n\n\n\nNew Year\u2019s Six\n\nCotton Bowl, Dec. 28\n\nCincinnati vs. Notre Dame\n\n\n\nOrange Bowl, Dec. 30\n\nWake Forest vs. Georgia\n\n\n\nRose Bowl, Jan. 1\n\nPenn State vs. Oregon\n\n\n\nSugar Bowl, Jan. 1\n\nBaylor vs. LSU\n\n\n\n\n\nOther bowls\n\nBahamas Bowl, Dec. 20\n\nBall State vs. Louisiana Tech\n\n\n\nFrisco Bowl, Dec. 20\n\nSMU vs. Army\n\n\n\nNew Mexico Bowl, Dec. 21\n\nFlorida Atlantic vs. Wyoming\n\n\n\nCure Bowl, Dec. 21\n\nHawaii vs. Georgia Southern\n\n\n\nCheribundi Boca Raton Bowl, Dec. 21\n\nNavy vs. Eastern Michigan\n\n\n\nCamellia Bowl, Dec. 21\n\nStory continues\n\nCentral Michigan vs. Georgia State\n\n\n\nLas Vegas Bowl, Dec. 21\n\nBoise State vs. Cal\n\n\n\nNew Orleans Bowl, Dec. 21\n\nMarshall vs. Appalachian State\n\n\n\nGasparilla Bowl, Dec. 23\n\nUCF vs. UAB\n\n\n\nHawaii Bowl, Dec. 24\n\nMemphis vs. BYU\n\n\n\nIndependence Bowl, Dec. 26\n\nSouthern Miss vs. Liberty\n\n\n\nQuick Lane Bowl, Dec. 26\n\nLouisville vs. Indiana\n\n\n\nMilitary Bowl, Dec. 27\n\nTemple vs. North Carolina\n\n\n\nPinstripe Bowl, Dec. 27\n\nPitt vs. Michigan State\n\n\n\nTexas Bowl, Dec. 27\n\nOklahoma State vs. Texas A&M\n\n\n\nHoliday Bowl, Dec. 27\n\nIowa vs. Washington\n\n\n\nCheez-It Bowl, Dec. 27\n\nTexas Tech vs. Washington State\n\n\n\nCamping World Bowl, Dec. 28\n\nVirginia vs. Iowa State\n\n\n\nFirst Responder Bowl, Dec. 30\n\nTCU vs. Florida International\n\n\n\nMusic City Bowl, Dec. 30\n\nFlorida State vs. Missouri*\n\n\n\nRedbox Bowl, Dec. 30\n\nNebraska vs. USC\n\n\n\nBelk Bowl, Dec. 31\n\nDuke vs. Kentucky\n\n\n\nSun Bowl, Dec. 31\n\nVirginia Tech vs. Arizona State\n\n\n\nLiberty Bowl, Dec. 31\n\nKansas State vs. Mississippi State\n\n\n\nArizona Bowl, Dec. 31\n\nSan Diego State vs. Troy\n\n\n\nAlamo Bowl, Dec. 31\n\nTexas vs. Utah\n\n\n\nCitrus Bowl, Jan. 1\n\nWisconsin vs. Florida\n\n\n\nOutback Bowl, Jan. 1\n\nMinnesota vs. Auburn\n\n\n\nBirmingham Bowl, Jan. 2\n\nTulane vs. Western Kentucky\n\n\n\nTaxSlayer Bowl, Jan. 2\n\nMichigan vs. South Carolina\n\n\n\nPotato Bowl, Jan. 3\n\nToledo vs. Utah State\n\n\n\nArmed Forces Bowl, Jan. 4\n\nAir Force vs. Ohio\n\n\n\nMobile Bowl, Jan. 6\n\nWestern Michigan vs. Louisiana\n\n*Missouri is eligible for a bowl game as long as its appeal of the NCAA\u2019s one-year bowl ban is still pending.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nNick Bromberg is a writer for Yahoo Sports\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Each of the four teams in our preliminary playoff field have been in the playoff in the last three seasons.", "authors": ["Nick Bromberg"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/czE4OkVqrZ9Pe0o1WcIcAg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/15hQO4TyKlqR_inFxtgoCg--~B/aD0yNjE0O3c9MzkyMTtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/455a4a10-f598-11e9-bf7f-49e9fbf0ef8f", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
