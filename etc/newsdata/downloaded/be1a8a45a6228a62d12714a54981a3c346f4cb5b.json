The supply of certain types of fresh foods and essential medicines would decrease, prices would go up and poor people would be hit hardest, it said.\n\nVehicles pass beneath a sign warning of possible changes to freight procedures following Brexit on the M56 motorway near Chester, Britain, in this Thursday photo. (Phil Noble/Reuters)\n\nThe paper also describes major disruption for travellers between Britain and the EU, uncertainty for U.K. citizens living in Europe, and says attempts to maintain an open border between Ireland and Northern Ireland would probably fail. It also says a no-deal exit could trigger major protests and even riots.\n\nThe government refused to comply with another part of Parliament's demand \u2014 that it hand over emails and texts among officials and aides discussing the government's decision to suspend Parliament for more than a month ahead of the Brexit deadline. Michael Gove, the minister in charge of Brexit planning, said the request was inappropriate and disproportionate.\n\nJohnson insists the country must leave the EU on Oct. 31, with or without a divorce deal to smooth the way. But many lawmakers fear a no-deal Brexit would be economically devastating, and are determined to stop him.\n\nOpposition lawmakers and rebel Conservatives have dealt the government's Brexit plans a series of blows. They passed a law that orders the government to seek a three-month delay to Brexit if no agreement has been reached by late October, rejected Johnson's call for a snap general election and ordered the release of the Yellowhammer document.\n\nThen on Tuesday Johnson suspended Parliament for five weeks until Oct. 14, sparking outrage among legislators and several legal challenges.\n\nThe U.K. Supreme Court is set to consider next week whether the shutdown should be reversed, after conflicting rulings in lower courts.\n\nLast week the High Court in London said the decision was inherently political and \"not a matter for the courts.\" But Scotland's highest civil court ruled Wednesday that the shutdown was illegal \"because it had the purpose of stymieing Parliament.\"\n\nA court in Northern Ireland is due to rule on a related case Thursday, and the Supreme Court is set to make the final decision after a hearing next week.", "description": "The British government insisted Thursday that its assessment there could be food and medicine shortages, gridlock at ports and riots in the streets if there is a no-deal Brexit is a worst-case scenario, not what is likely to happen.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5280511.1568281411!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/britain-eu.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
