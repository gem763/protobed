We have to stay focused and take the positives and take them into the Premier League.\n\n\u2018It is exactly what we needed, a great performance, a lot of energy, plenty of goals, a clean sheet \u2013 a perfect night. But it doesn\u2019t stop here, it was a game we were expected to win. We have got a very tough game on Sunday so I hope we can take momentum into that.\u2019\n\nIt was an excellent performance from Spurs and a much-needed three points in the Champions League following a slow start to the campaign but they will face a far sterner test against Liverpool at the weekend given their form.\n\nKane acknowledged that Spurs face a tough game on Sunday but has challenged his team to start making up ground in the Premier League table after taking only four points from a possible 12 in their last four games.\n\nHe added: \u2018It is always better when you are coming off a win rather than a loss or a draw. But of course, we know in the Premier League we are far behind and have a lot of catching up to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Sunday will be a tough game. They have started the season very well so we have to make sure we put in a performance similar to Tuesday.\u2019", "description": "Harry Kane has urged his Spurs teammates not to get carried away following their 5-0 win over Red Star in the Champions League on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Metro Sport Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1182738183_1571822889.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
