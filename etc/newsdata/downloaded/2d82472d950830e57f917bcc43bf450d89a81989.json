The fact we are playing Getafe is good for us as they will put us under real pressure at their stadium and will force us to dig deep.\u201d", "description": "Barcelona coach Ernesto Valverde says he does not know when Lionel Messi will return to action after another injury setback, as his side travel to Getafe on Saturday in La Liga seeking a first away win in eight matches in all competitions.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434578900&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q18Y-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
