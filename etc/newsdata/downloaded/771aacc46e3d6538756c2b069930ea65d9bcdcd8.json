We all know the lifestyle that Lewis has, and that Formula One drivers take 200 planes a year. You can\u2019t then say \u2018don\u2019t eat meat\u2019.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

They have feelings.\n\n\u201cSome people care about that, some people care less, so it wasn\u2019t the best feeling at that moment.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Fortunately I am not alone. There is a lot going on in my life at the moment.\u201d\n\nHamilton was asked about his final remark, but refused to elaborate.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot that goes on in our lives,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is important not to hold things in. I am always open and very transparent with my feelings, whether people like it or not.\n\n\u201cComing into this weekend, I feel very positive and I am back to what I love doing. It is about trying to be positive which is not always easy.\u201d\n\nHamilton then laid out his green manifesto, revealing he wants to be carbon-neutral by the end of the year.\n\nThe 34-year-old said that he doesn\u2019t allow anyone in his house or office with any plastic materials. He added that he has reduced his travel by plane, and sold his private jet last year.\n\nHamilton has also called on his Mercedes employers to ditch the all-leather interiors in their road cars. He added that his Tommy Hilfiger fashion line is made from 70 per cent sustainable materials.\n\n\u201cIt is important to feel like you are doing something positive, regardless of those who try to knock it down,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cIt is not the easiest because we are travelling around the world and our carbon footprint is higher than the average homeowner. But that doesn\u2019t mean you should be afraid to speak out for positive change.\n\n\u201cI am looking at how I can improve and the effect I have on the world. It takes a while and it is not a quick fix.\u201d\n\nHamilton will move to within one championship of Michael Schumacher\u2019s all-time record if he outscores Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas by 14 points here in Mexico City on Sunday.\n\nBut Hamilton\u2019s Mercedes team have struggled for pace at the high-altitude venue in recent seasons, meaning that the Briton may have to wait until next weekend\u2019s US GP before he is crowned champion of the world for a fifth time in six years.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember any point this season where I have finished 14 points ahead of Valtteri,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter where it is done, as long as you get it done.\n\n\u201cI am super-focused on the remaining four races. I am fully aware that there are plenty of points available so I have to deliver.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Lewis Hamilton hinted at trouble away from the track, and said he was \u201conly human\u201d, as he spoke for the first time about the social media backlash which provoked him to write that he felt like \u201cgiving up on everything\u201d.
