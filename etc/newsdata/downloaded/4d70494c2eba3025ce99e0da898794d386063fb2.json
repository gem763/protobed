Pjanic, a Bosnia international who is white, was called a 'Gypsy'.\n\nBut Serie A and the federation have not consistently handed out penalties to the clubs whose fans were responsible or the offending fans themselves.\n\n'This device allows you to perfectly distinguish a single voice,' Gravina said. 'We would like to use this tool so that people who want to ruin the dignity of Italian and international football know that they can easily be identified and therefore punished.\n\nEx-Juventus striker Moise Kean had an altercation with Cagliari fans last season after abuse\n\n'Our protocol is very strict but at times we can't identify in detail those responsible,' Gravina added. 'So we need to rely on technology.'\n\nGravina first detailed the possible use of the devices in an interview with Italian daily La Repubblica on Monday and added further detail in a news conference.", "description": "Italian Football Federation president Gabriele Gravina has detailed 'a passive radar device that uses directional microphones to determine the source of the noise' from offending supporters.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/14/20037196-0-image-a-23_1571751572417.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
