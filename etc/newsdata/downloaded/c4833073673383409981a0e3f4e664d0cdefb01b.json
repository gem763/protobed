Having our country act as Saudi Arabia's bitch is not \u2018America First,\u2019\u201d Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who is running for the Democratic nomination for president, tweeted on Sunday night.\n\nMichigan Rep. Justin Amash, a Republican-turned-independent, noted that Congress is the body empowered to \u201ccommence war.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t take orders from foreign powers,\" he tweeted.\n\nTrump's implication that the royal family in Riyadh will dictate U.S. actions prompted fury in Washington.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo explicitly blamed Iran for the strike on the oil facilities, which belong to Saudi Aramco, the state-owned petroleum giant. \u201cIran has now launched an unprecedented attack on the world\u2019s energy supply,\u201d Pompeo tweeted within hours of Saturday\u2019s attack.\n\nSaudi officials were not willing to go as far as Trump aides and directly blame Tehran for the damage to their facilities, although they did say they believe Iranian weapons were used. \"Investigations are still ongoing to determine the source of the attack,\" the Saudi Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Trump said that while it is \"looking\" like Iran was behind the attack, he noted that an investigation is ongoing. He also said he'd like to avoid war with Iran, but that the U.S. is ready for such a conflict.\n\nAsked if he had pledged to protect the Saudis, Trump said: \"No, I haven\u2019t promised the Saudis that ... We have to sit down with the Saudis and work something out.\"\n\nSuch equivocation is unlikely to deflate the controversy around Riyadh\u2019s role in U.S. policy.\n\nWhen Trump won the presidency in 2016, few countries were as happy as Saudi Arabia. The Saudis had felt neglected and dismissed under Trump\u2019s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, who had prioritized reaching out to Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional arch-rival.\n\nThey hoped Trump would be friendlier to their interests, and in many ways, he has delivered: signing off on weapons deals, abandoning the Iran nuclear deal and downplaying the Saudi state's human rights abuses. Trump even made Saudi Arabia the first foreign country he visited, famously posing in front of a glowing orb with Saudi royals during a conference on fighting terrorism.\n\nBut Saudi Arabia\u2019s reputation in Washington is arguably worse now than it has been in nearly two decades \u2014 almost as politically charged as in the years immediately following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, when it was revealed that 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudis.\n\nUnder the de facto leadership of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, Riyadh has pressed ahead with a four-year-old war against Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, which has had catastrophic humanitarian consequences that have been sharply criticized on Capitol Hill. U.S. lawmakers backed a measure that would have ended U.S. support for that war, but Trump vetoed it.\n\nThe Saudis hoped Trump would be friendlier to their interests than Obama, and in many ways, he has delivered.\n\nThe killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi national who had been living in the U.S., also fueled a massive backlash against Riyadh, which was blamed for the murder by the U.S. intelligence community. Many U.S. lawmakers in both parties hold Bin Salman responsible for what happened to Khashoggi, who was assassinated inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey.\n\nTrump has effectively said he doesn't care if the Saudi crown prince played a role because Saudi Arabia is an important ally, one that buys a lot of U.S. weapons and is a key global oil producer. \"It could very well be that the Crown Prince had knowledge of this tragic event \u2014 maybe he did and maybe he didn\u2019t!\" Trump said in one lengthy statement on the matter.\n\nAnalysts said the latest crisis exposed a major conundrum in Trump\u2019s foreign policy: The president and his aides have sent conflicting signals on what, if anything, the U.S. will do to defend its Arab allies in the Middle East when it comes to Iran.\n\nThat confusion was apparent earlier this year following a series of bomb attacks on oil tankers in the Persian Gulf that U.S. officials blamed on Iran. Then-national security adviser John Bolton, for example, warned Iran that \u201cany attack on United States interests or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force.\u201d\n\nTrump almost launched a military strike on Iran as the crisis over the oil tankers heated up and Iran downed a U.S. drone; but he called it off at the last moment, saying it would have been a disproportionate response. The U.S. later downed an Iranian drone.\n\nLeft unclear has been what the Trump team considers a U.S. interest. And adding to the murkiness is Iran\u2019s use of proxy forces and territory outside its borders to launch attacks, while its Islamist leaders in Tehran officially deny any role.\n\nDoes Trump consider \u201cactions by Iran against American allies to be actions that either demand or require some sort of U.S. response?\u201d asked Jon Alterman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. If he does, \u201cyou not only enmesh the U.S. in endless wars, but you reward the countries in the region for risky behavior because the U.S. comes in and acts.\u201d\n\nThe Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the weekend attacks on the oil facilities, but Pompeo has said there\u2019s no evidence the attack originated in Yemen, and the Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. officials believe Iran itself may have been \"the staging ground.\"\n\nThere\u2019s little love for Iran in Washington. The country has been a stalwart enemy of the United States since its Islamic Revolution 40 years ago. Iranian leaders have refused offers by Trump to hold talks, including possibly during the United Nations General Assembly later this month.\n\n\"Neither is such a plan on our agenda nor will such a thing happen. This meeting will not be held,\" Iranian Foreign Ministry Spokesman Seyed Abbas Mousavi said, Iran's state-run Fars News outlet reported Monday.\n\nDoes Trump consider \u201cactions by Iran against American allies to be actions that either demand or require some sort of U.S. response?\u201d \u2014 Jon Alterman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies\n\nDespite Iran's hostility, critics argue that Iran\u2019s latest alleged misbehavior is partly Trump\u2019s fault because he quit the Iran nuclear deal and re-imposed economic sanctions on Tehran.\n\n\"The administration\u2019s response to a crisis it caused by walking away from the [Iran deal] has been completely incompetent,\" Ilan Goldenberg, who served in the Obama administration, tweeted. \"It has failed to build an [international] coalition, failed to make a credible public case, given Iran more flexibility to hit our partners & increased the risk of war.\"\n\nUnder Bin Salman, Saudi Arabia repeatedly has been accused of risky behavior. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat trying to end the U.S. role in the war on Yemen, has blasted Riyadh for its all-too-frequent bombings of civilian targets, for instance.\n\nAnd there are concerns that Bin Salman\u2019s use of power in Riyadh, including his imprisonment of human rights activists and sidelining of other royals, signals that he will serve as a brutal dictator once he officially takes over from his father, King Salman. Even Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican aligned with Trump, has called bin Salman a \"wrecking ball.\" Given that Bin Salman is in his 30s, he could rule for decades.\n\nSaudi Arabia has spent billions of dollars on U.S. weaponry over the years, raising questions about why it would need U.S. support were it to decide to retaliate against Iran.\n\n\"Direct engagement by U.S. military in response to Iran\u2019s attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure would be a grave mistake,\" Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) tweeted on Monday. \"The U.S. has continued arms sales so Saudi Arabia can defend itself. If S.A. responds against Iran attacks, the U.S. should be ready to support in a non-kinetic role.\"\n\nThere are concerns that Bin Salman's use of power in Riyadh signals that he will serve as a brutal dictator once he officially takes over from his father.\n\nIn its statement Monday, the Saudi Foreign Ministry called for an internationally supported investigation into the oil facility attacks. The kingdom also insisted that it \"has the capability and resolve to defend its land and people, and to forcefully respond to these aggressions.\"\n\nA well-connected Saudi observer, however, said Riyadh\u2019s hands are tied in part because U.S. forces are in the region.\n\nSeveral hundred U.S. troops have been deployed to Saudi Arabia itself as part of a bigger build-up of the U.S. presence in the Middle East following the oil tanker attacks.\n\n\u201cSaudi cannot attack Iran without a U.S. \u2018OK\u2019 since the U.S. forces will be exposed to reprisals,\u201d the observer said in a written message to POLITICO, adding that it\u2019s \u201csimilar to [the] risk Israelis would have taken if they attacked Iran without coordinating with [the] U.S.\n\n\u201cSo ultimately, [the] cards are in the hand of the U.S. and Trump.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s one person who would have taken exception to that in the past.\n\n\u201cSaudi Arabia should fight their own wars, which they won't, or pay us an absolute fortune to protect them and their great wealth-$ trillion!\u201d Trump tweeted in 2014, a year before he announced he was running for president.", "description": "In a series of tweets, the US president indicated that Iran is behind recent attack on Saudi oil facilities.", "authors": ["Nahal Toosi", "Caitlin Oprysko", "David M.
