Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 25, 2019\n\nSince the first model in 2007, iPhones made use of a physical home button that took users back to the home screen. But a decade after the original phone came out, the 2017 edition of the iPhone, the iPhone X, became the first version to eschew the button in favour of swipe controls that require users to slide their fingers across the screen in various gestures.\n\nIt's not clear what prompted Trump to call out Apple's 58-year-old chief executive about the change now, more than two years after it was first implemented, and a White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment. But the reality TV star turned politician has been vocal about smartphone design in the past.\n\nThroughout 2013 and 2014, Trump tweeted numerous times about his belief that Apple should introduce an iPhone with a larger screen - something the company ultimately did, starting with the iPhone 6 Plus.\n\n@iPhoneTeam Better get a large screen iPhone, and fast, or risk losing even more business. Samsung cannot believe you have not acted! DUMB! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 19, 2013\n\nAn Apple spokesperson did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.", "description": "The President of the United States has strong feelings about smartphone design and wants the world to hear them.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2874/effb4b1d056c4829a7ab374fca26dd6a.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
