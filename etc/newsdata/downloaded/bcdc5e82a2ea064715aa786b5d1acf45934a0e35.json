Trump asked Johnson for help during a congratulatory phone call on July 26, just two days after Johnson took office, the paper reported. Trump has been characterized as convinced that the origins of the investigation lie in the U.K. and has even accused British agencies of spying on him, which Government Communications Headquarters dismissed as \"utterly ridiculous.\" Trump also contacted the leaders of Australia and Ukraine to ask for help for Attorney General William Barr in gathering evidence to undermine the investigation, which looked into ties between the Trump 2016 election campaign and Russia. Mueller, the special counsel, refused to fully clear Trump of wrongdoing when he released his report in April, saying he would have done so if the facts allowed him to, a move that led Trump to pursue his own probe attempting to show that the special-counsel inquiry had been politically motivated. Barr went to London after July 26 to attend a meeting of an intelligence-sharing alliance and told British officials of his suspicions about British agencies and their role in the Mueller probe. Australian, Ukrainian and Italian officials have confirmed calls from Trump, while Downing Street has declined to comment.", "description": "President Donald Trump personally asked U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson for help in discrediting the Mueller investigation, according to a Times of London...", "authors": ["Ciara Linnane", "Corporate News Editor"], "top_image": "https://mw3.wsj.net/mw5/content/logos/mw_logo_social.png"}
