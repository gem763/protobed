(Photo: Julia Wall/The News & Observer via AP)\n\nHurricane Dorian raked the Carolina coast with howling, window-rattling winds and sideways rain Thursday, spinning off tornadoes and knocking out power to more than 200,000 homes and businesses as it pushed northward toward the dangerously exposed Outer Banks.\n\nLeaving at least 20 people dead in its wake in the Bahamas, Dorian swept past Florida on Wednesday at a relatively safe distance, grazed Georgia overnight, and then began hugging the South Carolina-North Carolina coastline with more serious effects.\n\nAs of midday, it was a Category 2, blowing at 110 mph (177 kph) \u2014 a far cry from the Category 5 that mauled the Bahamas, but still dangerous. About 1 million people in the two states were warned to evacuate.\n\n\"Get to safety and stay there,\" North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said. \"This won't be a brush-by. Whether it comes ashore or not, the eye of the storm will be close enough to cause extensive damage in North Carolina.\"\n\nAt least three deaths were reported on the U.S. mainland, two in Florida and one in North Carolina, all involving men who were trimming trees or otherwise getting ready for the storm.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center's projected track showed Dorian passing near or over North Carolina's Outer Banks on Friday, lashing the thin line of islands that stick out from the U.S. coast like a boxer's chin. Dorian was then expected to peel away from the shoreline.\n\n\"I think we're in for a great big mess,\" said 61-year-old Leslie Lanier, who decided to stay behind and boarded up her home and bookstore on Ocracoke Island on the Outer Banks, making sure to move the volumes 5 to 6 feet off the ground.
