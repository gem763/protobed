Lots to talk about there, but I want to focus on the political ads because I don\u2019t think we fully understand their consequences and because election season is nigh. It\u2019s also the case that Facebook has tried to woo news organizations before with promises of a commitment to journalism and news, only to change its mind shortly thereafter. In other words, I\u2019ll believe it when I see it.\n\nSo let\u2019s stick with the political ads.\n\nThe logic behind Facebook\u2019s stance on political ads goes something like this: \u201cWe know the ad that says Elizabeth Warren has six heads and was birthed by dragons is untrue, but we choose to let our users [ponder that term for a moment] decide. You don\u2019t want us [Facebook] telling you what\u2019s true or not true, that would impede free speech.\u201d\n\nEhhhh, right.\n\nMeanwhile, Facebook makes some money off these ads, and more importantly collects data from all of us and cements its position as the world\u2019s primary forum for news and discourse in the process.\n\nThe Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, testified before the House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday October 23, 2019 Washington, D.C. (Photo by Aurora Samperio/NurPhoto via Getty Images) More\n\nZuckerberg acknowledges that he could simply ban all political ads if he wanted to, which is not a bad idea. And in fact the company does prohibit some political ads.\n\nHere\u2019s Zuck and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez during hearings in Washington this week:\n\nREP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: \u201cSo you won\u2019t take down lies or you will take down lies? I think it\u2019s a pretty simple yes or no. I\u2019m not talking about spin. I\u2019m talking about actual disinformation.\u201d\n\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: \u201cIn a democracy, I believe people should be able to see for themselves what politicians that they may or may not vote for are saying, and judge their character for themselves.\u201d [So, no AOC. He won\u2019t.]\n\nREP. ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: \u201cBut you said you\u2019re not going to fact check my ads.\u201d\n\nMARK ZUCKERBERG: \u201c...if anyone, including a politician, is saying things that can cause, that is calling for violence or could risk imminent harm, or order census suppression when we roll out the census suppression policy, we will take that content down.\u201d\n\nSo, no ads that incite violence or suppress census-taking allowed on Facebook. (Lies are OK though.)\n\nWhat about traditional media like TV, radio, billboards and print? What kind of political ads can they run or not run? Generally speaking old-school news outlets abide by legal rulings anchored by the landmark 1964 Supreme Court decision, New York Times Co. v. Sullivan.\n\nIn that case, a group of ministers in Alabama ran an ad in the Times supporting Martin Luther King Jr. and criticizing the local police. The ad contained some inaccuracies, which the Montgomery police commissioner L. B. Sullivan used as a pretext for a defamation suit even though the ad didn\u2019t name him. Local courts ruled for Sullivan, but ultimately the Supreme Court sided with the Times, establishing a new higher threshold for defamation, where not only must the information be untrue, it must be that the publisher knows that the statement is made with \u201cactual malice,\u201d meaning that it knows it to be untrue and with reckless disregard for the truth.\n\nNew York Times Co. v. Sullivan is mostly understood as a protection for news organization against libel lawsuits. But it also serves as a redline to determine what content a publisher will not accept. Meaning if a publisher knows that content is actually malicious and untrue, it will likely not publish it, even if that means not running an otherwise juicy story, or in the case of ads, sacrificing commercial gain.", "description": "Mark Zuckerberg and his minions have triangulated themselves into an intellectual corner which is illogical.", "authors": ["Andy Serwer With Max Zahn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3qzKSX91_jctoA_Xjih1oQ--~B/aD0zMjAwO3c9NDgwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/6574af50-f7e8-11e9-81df-c962ac0af25e", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
