(Sept. 13) AP, AP\n\nHank Plona is the head basketball coach at Indian Hills, a junior college powerhouse in rural Iowa. The Indians are a perennial top-10 program that has sent 35 players on to Division I basketball since 2015, including one to reigning national champion Virginia last spring.\n\nPlona has dealt with every kind of college coach \u2014 from low-majors through blue bloods \u2014 and has seen seemingly every pitch.\n\nAnd he's preparing for seismic change to how recruiting is done.\n\nThe first year California\u2019s new Fair Pay to Play Act takes effect is 2023, allowing the state's college athletes to profit from their name, image and likeness. It's become a national discussion since, with other states and U.S. congressmen discussing similar state and federal legislation. Meanwhile, an NCAA task force studying this model is expected to make its recommendation later this year.\n\nIn this Sept. 16 file photo, Gov. Gavin Newsom answers a question during a news conference in Sacramento, Calif. Newsom announced on Sept. 30 that he signed a law that would let athletes at California universities make money from their images, names or likenesses. The law also bans schools from kicking athletes off the team if they get paid. (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\n\u201cIf anybody says that ... money and what you can do for a kid in recruiting is not a factor, they are lying. It\u2019s important,\u201d Plona said. \u201cIt would alter how you have to go about being successful.\u201d\n\nUSA TODAY Sports has talked with numerous top football and basketball recruits, junior college coaches and recruiting influencers since Gov. Gavin Newsom signed California's bill into law in late September to weigh the potential effect of endorsements in recruiting.\n\nOne consensus was clear: Prepare for massive change in how recruiting is done.\n\nMAJOR VALUE: Elite college athletes could be worth millions if change happen\n\nWhat that change would look like, however, isn\u2019t as clear.\n\n\u201cIt opens Pandora\u2019s Box,\u201d said Rene Pulley, founder and owner of Twin Cities-based AAU club Howard Pulley, whose recent NBA alumni include Harrison Barnes and Tyus Jones. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of ways to do it. I guess I just wonder how the hell it\u2019s going to be done.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how the experts see things playing out.\n\nThis will not sway elite recruits as much\n\nJohn Lamb runs Des Moines-based AAU basketball club Beyond Ball. He's also a guardian of Omaha Biliew, a 6-foot-7 freshman considered one of the top-10 prospects in 2023.\n\nLamb knows that, by the time Biliew commits, players may be getting paid for their name, image and likeness. There would be schools where Biliew is more marketable \u2014 where he\u2019d be in line for more money through local endorsement deals in the community.\n\nFor a top-20 prospect, though, Lamb doesn\u2019t think that will matter much.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to consider, and probably predict, that it\u2019s probably better to continue to go to Duke and Kentucky,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cYou\u2019d have to consider that the national scale that these schools have already cemented themselves on will continually hold the upper hand.\u201d\n\nSonny Vaccaro agrees.\n\nVaccaro, the former Nike, Adidas and Reebok marketing executive who helped create shoe company influence in recruiting decades ago, said schools that are NBA springboards will still get the country\u2019s elite. The lottery-pick paycheck they can help players land outweighs local endorsement money.\n\nAlso, an athlete could boost their professional endorsement outlook by playing for the most visible college programs and compete for national titles.\n\n\u201cOn that level, they\u2019ll pick the same schools,\u201d Vaccaro said. \u201cIf I\u2019m LeBron James, if I\u2019m that kid and I\u2019m going somewhere for a year, I\u2019m still going to go to Duke or North Carolina.\u201d\n\nSharife Cooper, the No. 2 player in the 2020 Chosen 25 and Auburn recruit, says earning potential would not have weighed heavily into his college decision.\n\nSharife Cooper is one of those elite prospects. A five-star Auburn point guard recruit and the No. 2 player in the Chosen 25, Cooper said he could see endorsement deals affecting prospects\u2019 commitments in the future, depending in large part on their financial situations.\n\nFor him, though, he said it wouldn\u2019t have mattered.\n\n\u201cMore than anything, it\u2019s about the fit and the system,\u201d said Cooper, a product of McEachern High in Powder Springs, Georgia. \u201cI focus on the game. The rest will come.\u201d\n\nThe further down the rankings, the greater the effect\n\nOnce you get out of that top-20 range of prospects in basketball, experts said things could get more interesting. That\u2019s when potential earnings in one location versus another may matter.\n\nJerrel Oliver is the director of Chicago-based AAU club Team Rose. Recent alumni include Kansas State freshman DaJuan Gordon and Los Angeles Lakers rookie guard Talen Horton-Tucker.\n\nWith name, image and likeness compensation, Oliver thinks more prospects would choose schools closer to home because that\u2019s where they\u2019re most well-known \u2014 where they\u2019ll have the most value in endorsements and apparel sales.\n\n\u201cYou can market this or market that,\u201d Oliver said, \u201cand you\u2019re selling the fact that you can get paid to represent your hometown, where you will always come back to and end up at for the rest of your life anyway.\u201d\n\nPulley said endorsement deals could especially entice four-year college prospects to stay closer to home, because their earning potential may never be higher than it is in college.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be a plus for the ones that aren\u2019t that a five-star, guaranteed first-round pick,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a good chance of staying at home because that\u2019s where your marketability is.\u201d\n\nIn football recruiting, the effect of name, image and likeness compensation would look different.\n\nFor Vaccaro, it\u2019s simple: There\u2019s more name recognition \u2014 and endorsement potential \u2014 in a three-player basketball class than in a 25-player football class.\n\nMater Dei quarterback Bryce Young (Photo: David Chisholm/1550 Sports)\n\nStill, it's expected there'd be money in jersey sales, video games and local endorsements in football.\n\nCalifornia five-star 2020 quarterback Bryce Young, an Alabama commit, said earning potential would not have factored into his decision.\n\n\u201cBut I definitely don\u2019t think that would be the universal answer,\u201d Young explained. \u201cThere's a lot of people where that would have a lot to do with their decision.\u201d\n\nRole of boosters: 'Opening up a whole can of worms'\n\nExperts said boosters\u2019 recruiting presence would increase \u2014 and come out from under the rug \u2014 if name, image and likeness compensation is allowed.\n\nThat\u2019s a scary proposition for some, including Oliver, Pulley and Scott Strohmeier, head coach of junior college football powerhouse Iowa Western, which has 11 of 247Sports\u2019 top-100 juco prospects in the 2020 class.\n\n\u201cYou could literally just have them over to your house and say, \u2018Hey, I want you to do this TV piece for me, selling cars. And by the way, here\u2019s $20,000,\u2019\u201d Strohmeier said. \u201cWith some of these boosters and some of these fans, you\u2019re opening up a whole can of worms.\u201d\n\nVaccaro doesn\u2019t see that as a bad thing.\n\nIn a free market-driven system like this, he said, prospects would get the money they deserve, and schools with passionate boosters willing to shell out funds could become larger players in recruiting.\n\nIn essence, boosters could put their money where their mouth is.\n\n\u201cIn basketball, you only need one or two of those son of a guns,\u201d Vaccaro said. \u201cThat would allow basketball to tighten up. The little school could beat the big school.\u201d\n\nIn his sport, Plona could see name, image and likeness compensation helping schools without football, such as Marquette and Xavier. That allows boosters and local companies to focus their contributions on basketball.\n\n\u201cThe Creightons of the world. The Wichita States of the world,\u201d Plona said. \u201cThere could be some programs that really get some of those significant donors or boosters or owners of small companies around the area, and all of a sudden, the basketball kids could be their top guys.\u201d\n\nMinnesota head coach Richard Pitino speaks to the media during the Big Ten conference NCAA college basketball media day Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2019, in Rosemont, Ill. (AP Photo/David Banks) (Photo: The Associated Press)\n\nMinnesota's Pitino: We would adjust\n\nCalifornia\u2019s new law was a popular talking point at last week\u2019s Big Ten men\u2019s basketball media day.\n\nMinnesota\u2019s Richard Pitino was also asked how the law could specifically affect recruiting.\n\nHis answer reflected what experts told USA TODAY Sports: Colleges would have no choice but to incorporate marketability and potential endorsement opportunities in their recruiting pitches.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to show how your program can provide opportunities for players in that realm, right?\u201d Pitino said. \u201cSo we\u2019re all trying to figure that out. We all sell whatever we\u2019re offering to kids. \u2026 Now it\u2019s going to be about the opportunities in the community, and it\u2019s our responsibility to educate the players.\u201d\n\nPlona said today\u2019s successful coaches do everything in their power, within the rules, to find and exploit every advantage they can for their program.\n\nAnd if endorsement deals became legal, he said, they\u2019d simply provide one more way to gain an advantage.\n\n\u201cI would think trying to make sure kids are aware of every potential dollar they could get would be a part of (recruiting),\u201d Plona said.\n\nVaccaro believes, if a prospect has financial value, he or she should have the option to make the most of it. On the flip side, others worry boosters and local companies could take advantage of families and athletes in most need of money. Oliver is concerned money would play too big a factor, and that recruiting could become bidding wars.\n\n\u201cAlmost, 'Who can offer the most?'\" Oliver said.\n\nPulley worries about bidding wars, too. But he's been around a while. He founded Howard Pulley in the 1980s. And, based on his 30-plus years in the business, he thinks introducing name, image and likeness compensation would help more than hurt.\n\n\"This could go several different ways. But I\u2019d like to think positive,\u201d Pulley said, \u201cand think it\u2019s going to go in the right direction.\u201d\n\nUSA TODAY High School Sports reporters Jason Jordan and Logan Newman contributed to this story.", "description": "There's theories about what could happen in recruiting if a system that allows athletes to profit from their marketability.
