Hopkins ranked second in the NFL with a career-best 1,572 yards receiving and he led the team with 11 touchdowns.\n\nThe performance came in a year where Fuller missed the last nine games after tearing a knee ligament.\n\nThe Texans traded for veteran Demaryius Thomas soon after Fuller was injured, but he sustained an Achilles tendon injury and didn\u2019t finish the season. These injuries came in a season where Coutee missed 10 games with a recurring hamstring injury as a rookie.\n\nThe Texans opened camp feeling good about their depth at receiver with Fuller and Coutee healthy and the group got another boost when they acquired Stills in a deal with Miami on Aug. 31.\n\nWatson is excited about all his options at receiver and thinks they\u2019ll only get better as the season progresses.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always good to have weapons, I just try to get the ball in those guys\u2019 hands and let them go to work,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what they get paid to do, to get the ball and make something happen in space. It\u2019s always good to have healthy receivers that can fly around and make plays for you. It\u2019s fun to get everyone healthy and try to get back on the same page and get more experience as the game days and the practices continue.\u201d\n\nCoach Bill O\u2019Brien has been impressed with how quickly Stills has learned the offense and made the adjustment to his new team. But he isn\u2019t surprised at how seamless the transition has been because of what he\u2019s seen from the seven-year veteran since the trade.\n\n\u201cIn the short time that I\u2019ve been around Kenny, he\u2019s one of the harder-working guys at that position that I\u2019ve been around,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of hard workers in our wide receiver room and he fits right in. He\u2019s here early. He\u2019s here till 8, 9 o\u2019clock at night learning, taking care of his body, running routes, doing things just to get used to our offense and what we do.\u201d\n\nStills has seen limited work in Houston\u2019s first two games, but is averaging 12.5 yards a catch on his five receptions this season.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s made some big plays,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHe\u2019s a guy that I think we need to continue to develop in our system and keep getting in there.\u201d\n\nStills, who spent the past four seasons with the Dolphins, is thrilled to be playing with Watson, a player he\u2019s admired since he entered the league.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been great,\u201d he said. \u201cYou see we have some chemistry out there already, and he\u2019s a great player. He makes plays in this offense. I\u2019ve watched him from afar the past couple of years, so I\u2019m excited to be here and I\u2019m excited about the potential that we have as a team and as an offense.\u201d\n\nWatson said the Texans are looking for a sharper performance in the passing game on Sunday after he threw for 159 yards in a win over the Jaguars last week in just his fifth career start where he didn\u2019t have at least 200 yards passing.\n\n\u201cYou try to correct everything, all the mistakes that you made the previous week, but also just kind of try to get better each and every week,\u201d Watson said. \u201cWe knew that game last week was going to be tough \u2026 it\u2019s history that Jacksonville and Houston is always a battle to the end. You just try to focus on that next page and continue to grow and get better each week.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "In the final month of last season injuries had decimated Houston's receivers to the point that DeAndre Hopkins was just about Deshaun Watson's only viable target.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Kristie Rieken"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/15/jaguars_texans_football_80879_c0-130-3115-1946_s1770x1032.jpg?f753a7f269c26b74abeef0ae71264d4893c90d0c", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
