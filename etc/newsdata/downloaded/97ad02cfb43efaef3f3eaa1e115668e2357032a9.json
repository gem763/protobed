House investigators are also looking into the decision earlier this year to temporarily withhold critical military assistance to Ukraine,and whether it was used as leverage to pressure Zelensky. The inquiry is being led by House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.), and Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.).\n\nIn a statement, the three chairmen said the documents \u201creinforce concern that the president and his allies sought to use the machinery of the State Department to further the president\u2019s personal political interests.\u201d\n\nMenendez said Pompeo appears to have discussed the packet of documents with \u201cat least one of his top aides,\u201d adding that the materials were \u201cdistributed at the highest levels of the State Department.\u201d A spokesperson for Pompeo said the State Department provided the documents to the inspector general on May 3.\n\nThe origin of the documents is unclear, but one lawmaker who attended the briefing, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), said the stack included folders from a Trump-owned hotel. Raskin described the materials as \u201camateurish\u201d and said they are a \u201cpropagandistic distortion and distraction\u201d from what he called Trump\u2019s abuses of his office.\n\n\u201cThe existence of this packet and its curious history raises profoundly troubling questions. Why was Secretary of State Pompeo in possession of this packet of disinformation? Why did he distribute and circulate it? To whom else did he distribute and circulate it?\u201d Raskin told reporters.\n\nA Democratic source familiar with the briefing said the White House sent documents to Pompeo that \u201ccontained notes from interviews that took place at Rudy Giuliani\u2019s NYC office with various Ukrainians about debunked conspiracies related to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nGiuliani, who was subpoenaed on Monday, is a central figure in House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, which was launched after a whistleblower alleged Trump solicited foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election. Giuliani has said he was in contact with State Department officials about his efforts to work with Ukrainian officials to dig up dirt on Biden.\n\nYovanovitch, whom Giuliani has intensely criticized, was recalled to Washington on May 20. She is set to appear for a deposition on Capitol Hill on Oct. 11 as part of House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry.\n\nRaskin called the briefing an \u201cirrelevant distraction\u201d and said it centered on \u201cnothing relating to the president\u2019s impeachable conduct.\u201d He also questioned the inspector general\u2019s belief that the briefing \u2014 which was noticed on Tuesday afternoon \u2014 was \u201curgent.\u201d\n\nMarianne LeVine contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/f2/62/0497e54248778011c6f9045ccd19/191002-marie-yovanovitch-ap-773.jpg"}
