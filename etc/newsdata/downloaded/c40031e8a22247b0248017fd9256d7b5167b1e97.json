John Barrasso (left) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. | Tom Brenner/Getty Images Congress Republicans face crunch time on guns as Trump wavers 'We are very interested in knowing what his plan and proposal is and what he\u2019d be willing to sign,' says Senate Majority Whip John Thune.\n\nThe summerlong debate over new gun safety legislation is coming to a head.\n\nSenate Republican leaders discussed gun legislation in an hourlong party meeting on Monday evening, including expanding background checks, according to an attendee. But no one is making a move without President Donald Trump, who senators expect will be presented options on gun legislation by White House officials later this week.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTrump himself has been nearly impossible to pin down on the issue. Top GOP leaders in the House and Senate \u2014 including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Senate Majority Whip John Thune, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Minority Whip Steve Scalise \u2014 will meet with Trump on Tuesday to discuss the fall agenda, according to three sources familiar with the meeting. That gives Republicans the opportunity to hear the latest from the president himself.\n\nTrump has sounded at times optimistic or noncommittal about new gun legislation. With memories of last year\u2019s government shutdown fresh in their minds after Trump rejected their spending bill, Senate Republicans have no interest in getting ahead of Trump on such a charged cultural issue.\n\n\u201cWe are very interested in knowing what his plan and proposal is and what he\u2019d be willing to sign,\u201d Thune said, after the party leadership met on Monday. \u201cAll of our members, if this meeting [Monday] was any indication, believe that the president needs to indicate what it is he will be for.\u201d\n\nMcConnell made clear on Monday afternoon that the Senate\u2019s focus this month will be on spending bills to avoid a shutdown on Sept. 30 and fund the government into next fall, a potential setback to moving quickly on gun legislation in the wake of several recent mass shootings. McConnell did not mention gun legislation, though he has said in previous media appearances the Senate will consider whatever the president will sign.\n\n\n\n\n\nSign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

I don\u2019t know if he knows what direction to go exactly. \u2026 It\u2019s somewhere where his Manhattan upbringing may clash a little bit with traditional Republicanism,\u201d said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), who is a close Trump ally.\n\n\u201cThere will be plenty of people reminding the public that he made a promise to deal with it, and I think it would be foolish to not at least bring it up,\u201d he continued, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s not to say anything will pass.\u201d\n\nTrump made a brief reference to guns Monday afternoon, saying several options were under discussion. The opaque positioning by the president only added to the overall confusion and Republicans declining to take hard positions on potential legislation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to say I won\u2019t support anything. I want to support a solution,\u201d said Sen. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.).\n\nAs Republicans await Trump, Democratic negotiators offer divergent takes on whether expanded background checks, red flag laws or crackdowns on straw purchases can make it through a GOP Senate that\u2019s rejected or ignored such legislation in the past.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who has been negotiating with the White House on gun reform, was pessimistic Monday afternoon after a phone conversation with White House officials.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m less optimistic than I was a couple weeks ago,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI haven\u2019t walked away from the table, the White House hasn\u2019t. \u2026 We put some creative ideas on the table, they put some creative ideas on the table, but we\u2019re not there.\u201d\n\nBut Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who crafted the bipartisan expanded background check legislation with Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) in 2013, struck a more hopeful tone after meeting with Trump last week. He said the White House was aiming for some type of proposal this week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still encouraged,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cThey would not ask me to stay for an extra half-hour and the president sat through the whole meeting if he wasn\u2019t serious.\u201d\n\nGOP senators and the Trump administration are both anticipating some clarity later this week from the president. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) said White House officials \u201care pitching [Trump] sometime in the next few days \u2026 and then we\u2019ll see what he wants to do.\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201908/388/1155968404_6069085468001_6069086876001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\" true\n\nDayton Mayor Nan Whaley, a Democrat whose city suffered a mass shooting in August, met with White House officials, including counselor Kellyanne Conway, on Monday. That alone gave her confidence the president is still serious about doing something.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been the mayor since 2014. The president has been in since 2017, and I\u2019ve never been invited to the White House,\u201d Whaley said. \u201cThere\u2019s something new in this that I was invited to the White House to discuss commonsense gun legislation.\u201d\n\nDemocratic leadership continued to pressure the White House on Monday to bring up the House-passed universal background checks bill, which is broader than the Manchin-Toomey bill that would expand background checks to private sellers.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) suggested that anything short of universal background checks would fall short, though that bill lacks GOP support.\n\n\u201cI mean, he tells people right after the incident: \u2018I\u2019m going to get the strongest bill ever,\u2019\u201d Schumer said. \u201cAnd then he fades back from that. But the pressure is not going away.\u201d\n\nAs Republicans wait for a signal from Trump, the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday will take up a package of additional gun legislation, including a long-sought ban of high-capacity magazines. The hope is to keep the spotlight on an issue Democrats fear could fade from public discussion.\n\nThe panel will also vote on a bill to set up a federal program for \u201cred flag\u201d laws that allow temporary gun seizures \u2014 a bill with broad Democratic support but just one Republican co-sponsor.\n\nMany Democrats are also pushing for a vote on an assault weapons ban \u2014 one of the most contentious types of gun restrictions \u2014 on the floor, though it has run into resistance from some of the caucus\u2019 more conservative members.\n\nSarah Ferris contributed to this report.\n\n", "description": "\u201cWe are very interested in knowing what his plan and proposal is and what he\u2019d be willing to sign,\u201d says Sen.
