The Taliban says it was behind the attack.\n\nOfficials say the huge bomb was hidden inside an ambulance. The attacker is believed to have driven through a police checkpoint after claiming he had a patient inside. He then detonated his explosives at a second security post near to the country's old interior ministry.\n\nDespite being closed off to the public, witnesses say the area was packed with people at the time.\n\nMost of those killed were standing next to the ambulance.\n\nOne man said:\"I was sitting in my shop when a powerful explosion rocked the area. All the windows of my shop shattered but I don't know what happened next.\"\n\nThe number of dead rose rapidly in the blast's immediate aftermath, and is expected to rise further.\n\nWhile the bombing is the deadliest to hit Kabul in months it comes only a week after Taliban attackers stormed a luxury hotel in the Afghan capital, killing at least 22 people.", "description": "Scores killed and more than 150 wounded following deadly Taliban bombing in Afghan capital.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/03/06/45/77/1000x563_story-9c08d5d0-4e57-5683-94e6-ae1953aed422_828311.jpg", "published_at": "2018-01-27"}
