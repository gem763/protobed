They lost top contributors like Jordan Reed and Chris Thompson to season-ending injuries. The team tried to study ways to mitigate the problem and put 2017 in the past.\n\nThen it happened again.\n\nThe Redskins had 26 players spend time on the injured reserve list in 2018 \u2014 three more than the year before.\n\nAgainst that injury-streaked backdrop, it\u2019s no wonder Trent Williams\u2018 holdout over frustration with the Redskins\u2018 medical staff is the biggest story for a team opening the 2019 season this weekend with a couple of new quarterbacks and a coach on the hot seat.\n\nWilliams felt Washington\u2019s medical staff mishandled treatment of a growth on his scalp, which turned out to be benign but still gave him a scare. Former Redskins cornerback DeAngelo Hall told NFL Network this summer he\u2019d spoken with Williams and called the situation unorthodox. \u201cWe\u2019ve never had a player say, \u2018Hey, get that training staff out of here or I\u2019m not coming back,\u2019\u201d Hall said.\n\nHall this week provided an update, saying Williams told Redskins president Bruce Allen he didn\u2019t want to \u201ccost nobody their job.\u201d Williams hasn\u2019t spoken publicly, but the tackle\u2019s displeasure has leaked through reports like these.\n\nThe drama around Williams\u2018 holdout, the team\u2019s persistent injury history and the prominent players who\u2019ve struggled with longer-than-average recoveries have Redskins fans worrying about what goes on in the trainers\u2019 room as much as what\u2019s happening on the field.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just fans asking questions. One league source told The Washington Times athletes often consider the quality of a team\u2019s medical care when deciding whether to sign \u2014 or to leave.\n\n\u201cThe NFLPA and the agents do a very good job of understanding which teams do the best job (with their medical staffs),\u201d the source said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s definitely a factor players and agents use in the selecting of a team in free agency.\u201d\n\nInjured faith\n\nWilliams isn\u2019t the only player questioning how the Redskins handle injuries.\n\nIn 2017, former Redskins safety Su\u2019a Cravens was diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome and felt the team didn\u2019t take the condition seriously enough. The Redskins later placed him on the season-ending reserve/left squad list while he claims he intended to return; Cravens has an ongoing grievance against the team to get back his $651,408 base salary Washington withheld.\n\nIn a series of tweets last month, Cravens implied he doesn\u2019t feel his was an isolated incident.\n\n\u201c(Two) years later and I\u2019m still fighting the Skins on something they\u2019ve continued to do countless time,\u201d Cravens wrote. \u201cWhich is why the best tackle in the game refuses to play for them now. Same reason I left. Mishandled injuries and withheld info. All evidence points to them being guilty!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to make a distinction between medical and training personnel. The Redskins employ six physicians \u2014 three focused on internal medicine and three orthopedic doctors \u2014 the head physician being director of sports medicine Robin West from Inova Sports Medicine. Head trainer Larry Hess leads a staff of five trainers, whose work lies in the rehabilitation and recovery process.\n\nThe sports website The Athletic reported last month that there is \u201cat least some dissatisfaction inside Redskins Park\u201d over the training staff, but Hess, entering his 18th season working for the team, has owner Dan Snyder\u2019s support.\n\nThe Redskins declined to comment for this story, but there is evidence the organization has stepped up efforts in recent years to address the injury issues.\n\nIn 2018, the team upgraded its facilities with a state-of-the-art rest and recovery room that features everything from zero-gravity chairs and giant float pods to laser-therapy and cryotherapy equipment. Hess told the Associated Press that the efforts helped reduce soft-tissue injuries, like sprains, strains and torn ligaments, by more than 50% last season.\n\nEarlier this year, before the Williams situation became public, Washington\u2019s training staff was given the 2018 Ed Block Courage Award for NFL Athletic Training Staff of the Year, as voted upon by members of the Professional Football Athletic Trainers Society (reached for comment, a PFATS spokesman did not explain how the voting process worked).\n\nThe team insists the past two years of medical woes have not been a product of mismanagement.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you can avoid so many injuries that can occur,\u201d Allen said earlier this year at the combine. \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to figure out how to get people healthy quicker. Our players\u2019 efforts have been great. We just have to make sure we put them all in the proper position to come into the season healthy.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have bad luck,\u201d coach Jay Gruden said in March. \u201cLots of consultants come in and said, \u2018Gosh, that\u2019s too bad, man. That\u2019s unfortunate.\u2019\u201d\n\nHit hard up front\n\nWilliams\u2018 decision to hold out drew the support of some other Redskins. In June \u2014 many weeks before he wore a Williams jersey to a training camp interview and said he missed his teammate \u2014 tackle Morgan Moses praised Williams for taking a stand.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time someone like that stands up,\u201d Moses said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s not just a situation here; it happens throughout the league. To have one of our peers like Trent to stand up like that means a lot. His scare is one you never want to have, but you\u2019ve got to take care of yourself.\u201d\n\nWilliams\u2018 and Moses\u2019 positional group, the offensive line, was the unit hit hardest by injuries last year. Seven offensive linemen finished 2018 on injured reserve \u2014 including players like Austin Howard and Jonathan Cooper, free agents who were signed midseason when other linemen went down, only for themselves to get injured soon after.\n\nOffensive line coach Bill Callahan alluded to the Redskins\u2018 own research into how to lower those numbers. \u201cWe\u2019ve had these massive studies around here,\u201d Callahan said in June. \u201cBut really, nothing came out in the \u2018Mueller Report\u2019 here about injury status.\u201d\n\nCallahan is known to work his players hard in practice, but he mostly refuted the idea that they were more susceptible to injury as a result.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re more careful in the sense that we\u2019re looking at the amount of reps,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not burning any player with an increased amount or workload, for that matter \u2026 But as far as some of the injuries that we\u2019ve had, it\u2019s really not been a cause or a function of what we\u2019re doing in practice. They\u2019re really kind of freak injuries.\u201d\n\nThat may be true \u2014 many injuries are just the cost of playing football \u2014 but in some prominent cases, Redskins players took longer than expected to get back to full health due to infections.\n\nUnder the microscope\n\nWhile recovering from a torn ACL suffered in the 2018 preseason, running back Derrius Guice spent two months fighting off infection and required three additional procedures, the Washington Post reported. Quarterback Alex Smith famously broke his leg last November and later fought off a \u201cserious\u201d infection of his own.\n\nDerek Ochiai, an orthopedic surgeon and sports medicine expert based in Arlington, said infections are especially common for the type of fracture Smith had, in which his tibia broke through the skin and was exposed.\n\nBut the Redskins also have come under scrutiny for their handling of quarterback Colt McCoy\u2019s recovery from a less gruesome broken leg he suffered two weeks after Smith\u2019s.\n\nGruden admitted the team tried to return McCoy to the field too fast, possibly against the best advice of the medical team. The plan was that he could start in the postseason if Mark Sanchez or Josh Johnson carried Washington to a playoff berth. McCoy has had two extra surgeries since the initial repair and missed all preseason action during a wide-open quarterback battle.\n\n\u201cHe probably rushed back, we probably rushed him back a little too quick and it didn\u2019t have a chance to heal so they had to go back in (for surgery) a little bit,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cThat was nobody\u2019s fault, just a fluke-type deal that something else happened.\u201d\n\nBut how many flukes are too many? ESPN injury analyst and physical therapist Stephania Bell said if there were a straightforward answer to why some teams deal with more injuries than others, every team would try to follow the same formula for success.\n\n\u201cNobody wants to be wearing that badge of \u2018We had the most players on IR,\u2019\u201d Bell said. \u201cBut I would say that in fairness, just like anything else scientific, things go in cycles and you sort of have to look at them in broad strokes in bigger clusters than one or two years.\u201d\n\nBell said an NFL Players\u2019 Association source told her that \u201cAlex Smith, Colt McCoy and Trent Williams love, love, love Dr. Robin West,\u201d the head team physician.\n\n\u201cWhen I hear that a player has a complaint with the medical staff, and again this goes for any player, any team, I\u2019m always curious who their gripe is with, because usually it\u2019s not an entire group. It\u2019s a couple of people,\u201d Bell said.\n\nOchiai added that team doctors are always under a microscope.\n\n\u201cBasically it\u2019s a no-win situation,\u201d Ochiai said.\n\n\u201cIf somebody gets injured and you treat them and they get better, that\u2019s expected,\u201d the surgeon said. \u201cIf somebody gets injured and either it takes longer or they have a complication that takes longer, then it\u2019s your fault. You can\u2019t win, you can only \u2018not lose\u2019 in that situation.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
