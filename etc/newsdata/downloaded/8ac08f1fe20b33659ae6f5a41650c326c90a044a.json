If he weakens, that fear will subside.\u201d\n\nHowever, increased political polarisation in recent years means that most Republicans are expected to stick with Mr Trump \u201cas long as their own status is not in danger\u201d, according to the professor.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

faced near-certain impeachment over the Watergate scandal.\n\nNixon, who had fought the scandal for months, announced his resignation the next day.\n\nMore than 40 years later, a highly-polarised Washington is not expected to come to a bipartisan agreement on the issue of impeachment, especially with Mr Trump having strong support within the Republican Party.\n\n\u201cIn the past in the US, party members would dissociate themselves from disgraced leaders in order to preserve the party and their own reputations,\u201d Professor Nick Smith, who teaches ethics and philosophy at the University of New Hampshire, said.\n\n\u201cBut now President Trump seems to have such a personal hold on the party \u2013 more like a cult leader than a US president \u2013 that the exits are closed as the party transforms into his image.\u201d\n\nKathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Annenberg Public Policy Centre, added that with the death of John McCain last year, there is no Republican figure with enough power to challenge Mr Trump.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email
