(Mike McArthur/ CBC)\n\nThey spend part of the year in Texas, where Robert gets medical care covered by his U.S. military service, and part of the year in the B.C. family home where Denise grew up.\n\n\"I love this house and I don't want to lose it,\" says Denise Simpson. \"I'm a Canadian. It doesn't make any sense to me.\"\n\n'We're not speculators'\n\nThe seniors say they can't hold on to their $1.2 million home because they can't pay the $6,000 annual speculation tax they've been assessed on top of other taxes.\n\nThe two-storey yellow wood frame home has been in Denise's family since 1952, when she was five.\n\nBut the province has ruled the house isn't their primary residence and isn't rented out to \"non-family members\" \u2014 so it is ineligible for exemption.\n\nDenise Pettersson Simpson first lived in the family home when she was five, 67 years ago.\n\n\"I couldn't believe it. I couldn't understand how this could apply to us,\" says Denise Simpson. \"We didn't buy the house, we inherited it. We're not speculators.\"\n\n'Government greed for money'\n\nThe B.C. government imposed the speculation tax in November 2018, saying it was designed to target foreign and domestic real estate speculators, turn empty homes into affordable housing, and generate tax revenue to be used for housing initiatives.\n\nRich offshore investors have been blamed for driving up market prices \u2014 buying homes and condos for investment purposes, often leaving them empty.\n\nThe Simpsons allege they've fallen victim to an overly broad tax.\n\nThey say they've repeatedly declined purchase offers from speculators, and recently paid off the Oak Bay mortgage so Denise could move back to Canada permanently after Robert dies.\n\nNow they face an uncertain future.\n\n\"We were in the act of settling in when this hit,\" says Robert Simpson. \"[We're] surprised the government greed for money could drive us out of here.\"\n\nIn July, the B.C. government revealed the speculation tax is expected to put $115 million into provincial coffers this year.\n\nCrowdfunding legal costs\n\nThe Simpsons say they can only take part in the lawsuit because it's being handled pro bono \u2014 without charge \"for the public good\" \u2014 by a Vancouver-based law firm.\n\nLawyer Kailin Che says the firm hopes to finance the legal costs by crowdfunding through a website called \"saynotospectax.com.\"\n\nLawyer Kailin Che hopes the lawsuit will lead to an expanded class action against the speculation tax. (Eric Rankin/ CBC)\n\nThere was a similar attempt last year to raise funds online for a different speculation tax challenge on behalf of Alberta-based B.C. property owners, which has yet to proceed.\n\nBut Che says this case will be fought in court \u2014 and could grow.\n\n\"I believe this petition is the first step to building a larger constitutional challenge that might evolve into a greater class action,\" says Che. \"And we anticipate there will be other lawsuits to follow.\"\n\n'Right to liberty' cited\n\nThe civil action alleges the speculation tax \"infringes the petitioners' right to liberty protected\" under the charter.\n\n\"Choosing where to establish one's home is a quintessentially private decision that goes to the very heart of personal autonomy,\" states the lawsuit. \"The state should not be permitted to interfere in this private decision-making process \u2026 the act effectively coerces the petitioners to rent out their homes.\"\n\nThe B.C. government has yet to file a legal response. The allegations have not been proven in court.\n\n'I'd be devastated'\n\nDenise Simpson says renting out her family home to strangers isn't an option \u2014 it's full of family memorabilia and memories.\n\nThe thought of being forced to put the house on the market brings her close to tears.\n\n\"I would have a total breakdown if I had to sell this \u2026 I'd be devastated, crying,\" she said. \"It'd be like losing a family member.\"\n\n\"I would never get over having to lose this house. And I would never want to go back to Canada again.\"", "description": "Six homeowners have launched a legal fight against B.C.\u2019s Speculation and Vacancy Tax.
