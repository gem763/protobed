But Chip wasn\u2019t so sure about the entire endeavor.\n\n\u201cI called Chip, and he said, \u2018Do not call that person back. It\u2019s a scam. How much did they say you have to pay them to film you?\u2019\u201d Joanna said.\n\nJoanna soon convinced Chip the offer was legitimate, and the production crew headed to Waco to film the Gaines family at work. HGTV executives saw the on-screen magic, and put them on the air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow parents to five children ranging in age from 16 months to 14 years, the couple, who got married in 2003, also shared how they first met. Chip ran into his future wife one day while heading into her family\u2019s auto shop to get his brakes fixed, and recognized her from the shop\u2019s commercials.\n\n\u201cOne day I was walking out, and he was walking in, and we just bumped into each other,\u201d Joanna laughed. \u201cAnd he was like, \u2018Hey! you\u2019re that girl in the commercials!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought I was dreaming,\u201d Chip added.\n\nThe couple married in 2003, the same year Joanna opened her first design shop.\n\nNow the dynamic duo is taking on a massive project, renovating a 53,000-square-foot hotel in their hometown. And then there\u2019s their upcoming television channel, The Magnolia Network, which is set to debut in 2020.\n\nThe couple also revealed that they truly wrestled with the idea of calling time on their beloved HGTV show, which ended in 2018. In fact, several people they consulted with said it would be a massive mistake if they were to end the program.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming majority of people said, when you turn that television show off, all this other stuff will come crumbling down,\u201d Chip told Geist. \u201cAnd for that ironic and complete opposite reality to have occurred, it\u2019s pretty testimony to just, be yourself, man.\u201d\n\nThey also shared that there is one star who takes their breath away: Taylor Swift.\n\nBack in April, the couple headed to New York to take the red carpet as honorees on the prestigious TIME 100 list of the year\u2019s most influential people in the world.\n\n\u201cWe turn around, there\u2019s Taylor Swift with this amazing posse. Our breath gets taken away. She walks into that freakin\u2019 room, full of all stars, looks the first row over, catches eye contact. She\u2019s eyeballing Jo. She goes like this, and air hearts Jo,\u201d Chip told Geist, mimicking Swift as she drew an air heart for the duo.\n\n\u201cAnd then I passed out,\u201d confirmed Joanna.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "The former \"Fixer Upper\" hosts appeared on \"Sunday Today\" to talk about their family, becoming TV stars and meeting Taylor Swift.", "authors": ["Megan Johnson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/GUC_oP3.ra5oThzTyIqa7A--~B/aD0yMDAwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/b7e9d490-f8d8-11e9-afaf-4382ce469295", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
