However, despite the deluge, the greens appeared in surprisingly good condition.\n\nNo spectators were allowed on the premises, due to what the tournament said were safety concerns, which created a weird atmosphere in the wake of the sellout crowd that had the course bursting at the seams on Thursday.\n\nTiger Woods, who shared the first-round lead with fellow American Gary Woodland, was scheduled to start his second round at 11.40 a.m. local time (0240 Sunday GMT).\n\nWoods is playing in Japan for the first time in 13 years, giving fans a rare opportunity to watch the 15-times major champion.\n\nBut those who did not come on Thursday might be out of luck. The tournament has yet to announce whether spectators will be permitted for Sunday\u00b4s third round or Monday\u00b4s final round. (Reporting by Andrew Both.
