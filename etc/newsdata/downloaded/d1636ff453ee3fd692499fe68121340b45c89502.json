This rule will put families at risk who are in the same situation that I was in,\u201d she says through a translator.\n\nShe adds: \u201cThis rule is horrific and clearly yet another attack against immigrant families. The Trump administration is sending a clear message that if you are not white and you are not wealthy you are not welcome here.\u201d\n\nThe public charge rule is the latest in a series of policies seemingly designed to worsen the lives of immigrants. And as one of the country\u2019s most diverse neighborhoods in New York\u2019s most diverse borough \u2013 47.5% of Queens\u2019 population was born outside the US, according to census data, while a recent report by the mayor\u2019s office of immigrant affairs found it is home to 184,000 undocumented immigrants \u2013 the impact is being acutely felt in Jackson Heights, and other New York neighborhoods like it.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Subway passengers enter the Roosevelt Avenue station in Jackson Heights, New York.

We are #heretostay.\u201d Over the sound of an overhead rumbling subway train, they chant: \u201cS\u00ed se puede!\u201d (Yes we can!).\n\nThe meeting, last month at Make the Road New York, which provides services including health program enrollment and legal representation, marked the announcement of a lawsuit filed by them and other community organizations seeking to block the public charge rule. It is one of a number of lawsuits relating to the new rule by multiple states and advocacy groups.\n\nSusan Welber, a Legal Aid Society lawyer working on the case, says the new rule, due to come into force on 15 October, is \u201cunconstitutional, it\u2019s arbitrary, capricious, it\u2019s in violation of the immigration nationality act and 120 years of understanding what it means to be a public charge\u201d.\n\nShe adds: \u201cPeople feel confused and fearful of what it means for them. It is a very complex rule and people need a lot of help to understand it.\u201d\n\nMake the Road New York say they have already been inundated with people asking whether they should withdraw from vital services, fearing it will impact their future immigration status.\n\nThe Trump administration is sending a clear message that if you are not white and you are not wealthy you are not welcome here Blanca Palomeque\n\nNew York city council will vote on Thursday on a package of bills to ensure staff at city agencies are trained on public charge and to direct those affected to get advice and help from experts.\n\nAt a July town hall, the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who represents the Bronx and Queens, said at least half of all casework her office receives is related to immigration.\n\nBut the community is fighting back.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sunset over Jackson Heights buildings.

He adds: \u201cIt\u2019s this constant fear. The adults often try to shelter the children from it, but children pick up on these things and so it\u2019s a constant uncertainty, it\u2019s a feeling of that somebody might not come home at any time and concern about what happens to your family if that\u2019s the case.\u201d\n\nWhile he thinks the situation in general is worsening because of the \u201caccumulative effect of now months and years of having daily assaults\u201d, people are starting to organize and plan ahead as a community.\n\n\u201cOver time people can\u2019t sort of persist in panic mode all of the time \u2026 people are already starting to look ahead, thinking about when we have a different Congress and when we may have a different president, you know, is there hope? Is there a possibility for change?\u201d", "description": "Residents of Jackson Heights, one of New York\u2019s most diverse neighborhoods, are concerned the new \u2018public charge\u2019 rule will put families at risk", "authors": ["Miranda Bryant"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95c8be01dff083ac494f8e1dc769cbb6df403be1/0_183_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=152824001dbf858e156538f3b891bb70", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
