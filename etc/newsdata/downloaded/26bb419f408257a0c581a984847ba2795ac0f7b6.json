The proposal has broad support among Democratic activists and 2020 presidential contenders, putting it at the forefront of the party's sprawling presidential primary.\n\nNo Republican presidential candidate has won New Mexico since George W Bush in 2004 but Trump insisted he could do it: ''I think we're going to do great here. We're here because we really think we're going to turn this state and make it a Republican state.\" But he captured just 40 per cent of the state vote three years ago, as compared to Hillary Clinton's 48 per cent - secured without her even visiting the state during the 2016 campaign.\n\nOver the course of another rambling sermon to the converted in the Albuquerque suburbs, the president also accused his opponents of wanting the US \"to be at the mercy of rogue regimes\u201d and to \u201cconfiscate your guns and eliminate your god-give right to self-defence\u201d.\n\nFalsely claiming Latino support for his border wall to shut off the southeastern states from Mexico, Trump risked further losing ground with Hispanic voters naturally opposed to his frequently racist anti-immigration rhetoric. Nearly 40 per cent of New Mexico's electorate is Spanish speaking and their endorsement of his plans for 500 miles of border wall can hardly be taken for granted.\n\nThe president joked about race and the MeToo movement in Rio Rancho (\"We can't say this, but I'll say it anyway: You're better looking. Including the men!\") before a pesky fly and those even peskier protesters disrupted his flow.\n\nHere's Andrew Buncombe's report on another hot night in the south.", "description": "Donald Trump's latest campaign rally saw him attempt to appeal to the Hispanic voters of New Mexico\u00a0he alienated in 2016 at an event characterised by false statements and a series of interruptions by protesters - and flies.", "authors": ["Joe Sommerlad"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/17/09/donald-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
