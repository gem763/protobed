It is also known as a concert venue,\u201d Salvini said.\n\n\u201cFascism, like communism, is a dead idea. These are phenomena to be studied, but neither of them will return,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen asked how he defines himself politically, Salvini stated: \u201cI believe that the left, right, fascist, and communist labels are outdated. I call myself Italian, neither right nor left.\u201d\n\nItalians Prefer Salvini Coalition To New Leftist Govt https://t.co/bOCdvGvKTX \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 12, 2019\n\n\u201cI do not criticise the PD (Democratic Party) because it is of the left, but because it depends on the will of Brussels, while for the League, the Italian interest is the priority,\u201d Salvini said.\n\n\u201cFor me, \u2018populist\u2019 is a compliment, it means being close to the people,\u201d he added.\n\nSalvini\u2019s popularity with the people continues to dominate opinion polls. A survey released by EMG Acqua shows the League with 31.8 per cent support compared to the two ruling coalition parties, the Five Star Movement and the Democratic Party, which each polled under 20 per cent.\n\nThe League leader also enjoys a 39 per cent confidence rating, ahead of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte who received 35 per cent. Five Star leader Luigi di Maio and Democratic Party Nicola Zingaretti scored 25 and 24 per cent respectively.\n\nSince early September, polls have shown widespread opposition to the current leftist coalition, with an IPSOS poll showing that not only did just 34 per cent of Italians approve of the current government, more Italians preferred the former League-Five Star coalition.\n\nSpanish Populist Leader Blames EU Plot for Getting Salvini out of Govt https://t.co/UUes8dnIaE \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) September 25, 2019", "description": "Matteo Salvini rejected allegations of fascist allusions, saying that fascism is dead and to be called a populist \"is a compliment\".", "authors": ["Chris Tomlinson"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-1168408548-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
