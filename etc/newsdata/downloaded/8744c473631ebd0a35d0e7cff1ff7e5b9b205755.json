On top of this, there are 27 states in the world where women make up less than 10 per cent of parliamentarians in single or lower houses.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Experts warn it leads to the silencing of women\u2019s voices on critical issues of global policy at a time when sexual and reproductive rights, long taken for granted, are under threat from the right.\n\nShelby Quast, director of the US branch of Equality Now, a non-government organisation (NGO) that aims to promote the rights of women and girls, said the imbalance was \u201cdeplorable\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe UN should be leading by example in demonstrating best practices that deliver gender parity and remove barriers to women\u2019s full participation at every level.\n\n\u201cSo it is both disappointing and deplorable to see how women\u2019s voices continue to be underrepresented at the UN General Assembly, and it is an imbalance that needs urgent addressing.\u201d\n\nElmira Bayrasli, chief executive of Foreign Policy Interrupted, an organisation which strives to tackle gender disparity in the press, argued international problems would not be resolved with a \u201cone-dimensional male perspective\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only tone deaf, it\u2019s dangerous,\u201d she added. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to be serious about getting to solutions, then we need to be serious about drawing on the expertise of a wide variety of people, namely women. The old boys\u2019 club is grossly outdated. Surely we can imagine a future that looks and sounds different from the one of the past?\u201d\n\nThe General Assembly is sometimes referred to as the \u201cworld\u2019s parliament\u201d and provides a forum for important debates \u2013 as well as having the power to make recommendations to the United Nations Security Council. The UN said that, while it was up to individual nations who was sent to represent them, the secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, was concerned by the \u201cmassive gender disparity\u201d.\n\nFarah Nazeer, deputy director of Advocacy at ActionAid UK, an NGO which works to counter poverty and injustice worldwide, said: \u201cThe global problems we face can only be addressed by bringing together differing perspectives, knowledge and experience. It is not acceptable that women\u2019s voices are not being heard in forums like the General Assembly when women are amongst the poorest and most marginalised people in the world.\u201d", "description": "With world leaders gathered from around the world, the annual General Assembly of the United Nations this year claimed to be focused on \u201cinclusion\u201d \u2013 but it seems that inclusivity did not stretch to its list of speakers.", "authors": ["Maya Oppenheim"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/27/20/Trump-UN-general-assembly.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
