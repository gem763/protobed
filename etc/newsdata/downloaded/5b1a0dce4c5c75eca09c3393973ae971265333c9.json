The group gave no indication of the motive behind the attack, though it did ask Mr Dorsey to remove the suspensions of a number of accounts.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

This allowed an unauthorised person to compose and send tweets via text message from the phone number. That issue is now resolved.\u201d\n\nTwitter encourages all of its users to use two-factor authentication, which is intended to ensure that nobody but an account holder is able to get into an account.\n\nFacebook boss Mark Zuckerberg also had his account hacked in 2016, apparently after declining to use that protection and having an easy-to-guess password.\n\nJack Dorsey helped to found Twitter in 2006. He initially served as its CEO, before stepping down and then returning to lead the company again in 2015.\n\nMr Dorsey has been hit by problems using his own site before.
