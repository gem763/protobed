He presided over landmark deals on rent relief, charter schools and police shootings. He excited liberals with a more aggressive stance toward President Donald Trump. His first budget drew praise from both parties for exercising fiscal restraint while directing hefty sums toward homelessness and insuring undocumented immigrants, both issues gnawing at the state\u2019s heavily Democratic base.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut frustrations simmered here in the nation's most influential state capital, leaving lingering questions. Lawmakers, staff and interest group negotiators \u2014 many of whom spoke anonymously to avoid antagonizing a new governor as bills remain on his desk \u2014 pointed to false starts and mixed messaging that left them uncertain of where they stood, in addition to last-minute intercessions and a sense that Newsom made one-sided demands for votes. That dissension came despite the fact that Newsom dealt almost exclusively with lawmakers in his own Democratic Party because Republicans have so little power in Sacramento.\n\nSome observers attributed missteps and muddled communications to the Capitol inexperience of Newsom himself and top aides. Newsom rarely engaged in the thick of legislative dealmaking as lieutenant governor, while some top staff \u2014 notably chief of staff Ann O\u2019Leary, a former adviser to both Bill and Hillary Clinton \u2014 arrived unfamiliar with the Capitol\u2019s ways.\n\nOthers saw an ambitious new governor who, in his desire to forge early breakthroughs in a variety of policy areas, had a habit of overextending himself, getting publicly ahead of closed-door realities and striving to mollify different groups in a way that could leave negotiators uncertain of where they stood.\n\nAs lawmakers prepare for Newsom's second year, some said they were glad he supported bills that former Gov. Jerry Brown rejected \u2014 but intend to press Newsom on specifics earlier to avoid surprises. Others remain suspicious of his operating style and say he has lost credibility.\n\nRob Stutzman, who helped Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger navigate his first year as his communications director, said much of the grumbling reflected the inevitable growing pains as a governor and legislators gauge one another.\n\n\u201cOne thing you do constantly hear is the Legislature being unsure of what the governor wants, but it\u2019s his first year,\u201d Stutzman said. \u201cHe may have been trying to determine what he wants.\u201d\n\nBut Stutzman cited two more vexing episodes, echoed in numerous interviews, that bookended Newsom\u2019s year: his State of the State speech seemingly acknowledged that California\u2019s high-speed rail project was a lost cause, leaving Newsom\u2019s staff scrambling to reassure supporters and counteract reports that the project was dead; and his surprise demand for more amendments to a vaccination exemption measure after he had already sought and agreed to an earlier set of changes.\n\n\u201cWith the vax issue, and we saw this with high-speed rail, he said one thing and did another \u2014 that\u2019s troubling,\u201d Stutzman said. \u201cThat\u2019s unusual.\u201d\n\nOne Democratic legislative aide said that as the year progressed, it became difficult to know if policy deals would stick.\n\n\"I think the feeling right now is you can't trust anything that they say. Even if a staffer is acting in good faith, the situation is so chaotic within the Horseshoe that a staffer\u2019s assumption your bill doesn\u2019t have problems doesn't necessarily amount to much,\" the aide said, referring to the governor's senior staff offices on the first floor of the Capitol.\n\nAsked about such frustrations, Newsom spokesperson Nathan Click responded by underscoring accomplishments across a number of policy areas, saying in a statement that the governor has presided over \u201ca huge amount\u201d of progress \u201con some of the state\u2019s most intractable problems,\" running through a list ranging from renter assistance to charter school regulations.\n\nBrown comparisons\n\n\n\nInevitably, Newsom\u2019s style invited comparisons to Brown, his predecessor \u2014 a man whose record Newsom compares himself to, unprompted, when talking to the press.\n\nBrown had already served two terms before returning in 2011 and relied on a long-established inner circle familiar to Sacramento denizens. He also was more selective about what he became involved in and focused more on \u201cbig legislative achievements\u201d like creating the Local Control Funding Formula for schools.\n\nA source close to negotiations on the charter school deal likened Newsom's style of leading to a \"strong mayor\" form of government compared to Brown. The source said Newsom\u2019s desire to be involved \u201cfrom very early on\u201d left some legislators \u201cannoyed.\u201d\n\nOther sources familiar with the charter negotiations said those involved felt \u201ccaught off guard\u201d by what they say was Newsom\u2019s attempt to appease dueling interests, especially since it forced his longstanding ally, the California Teachers Association, to accept changes sought by the California Charter Schools Association, which opposed the governor during last year's primary.\n\nWhile Brown would typically telegraph his position or intervene only on a handful of major priority policies, legislators said Newsom and his team would surprise them by jumping in late in the game to try and shape bills before they arrived on his desk. That late-breaking action irritated some.\n\n\u201cWith Brown, you did your own thing, and if you reached out to his staff, you may get some input, but at least you knew exactly where he was coming from,\u201d one source said. \u201cThe method of engagement is very different. I don\u2019t know how much of it is because he\u2019s brand new, but the surprises \u2026 it\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d\n\nA senior Democratic legislative aide told POLITICO, \"So many people said, \u2018Oh, we talked to the administration, they were fine on our bill and then literally two days later they wanted amendments.\u2019 That's just unheard of. The Brown administration would be so embarrassed to be off-message in that way.\"\n\nAssembly Speaker Anthony Rendon said Brown came in with \"fairly fixed ideas based on long experience\" and a smaller set of priorities, while Newsom has shown more willingness to work with lawmakers. But there are always some growing pains in the first year.\n\n\"It\u2019s still a learning process,\" Rendon said. \"It\u2019s both a matter of us learning how to work with a new governor and the governor\u2019s staff. Those who haven\u2019t been here long have had to learn how the process functions in the Capitol.\"\n\nSurprise sunsets\n\n\n\nIn May, Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia (D-Bell Gardens) and Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez (D-San Diego) stood next to Newsom at a podium celebrating a long-fought victory after the new governor agreed to exempt menstrual products and diapers from sales taxes in California.\n\nThey didn't realize until days later that Newsom only wanted the exemption to last two years. Both lawmakers said they were surprised and disappointed.\n\n\u201cI initially thought it was going to be permanent,\u201d Garcia told POLITICO in an interview. \u201cThey told me they were going to do this exemption in the budget, and I said, 'Great, let\u2019s do this.'\u201d\n\nGarcia said she learned a minute or two before the press conference with Newsom that there would be an expiration date. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get an answer on how long,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cSomeone told me it was a two-year sunset. Someone else told me it was five years, then they said it was 10 years.\u201d\n\nShe blamed herself for not pressing the administration earlier, but also said Newsom could have been more transparent. Gonzalez said she learned about the two-year sunset from reporters days later.\n\n\u201cI was asked about it and didn\u2019t know, that\u2019s never comfortable,\u201d Gonzalez said about the sunset. \u201cI learned about it from the media. It seemed odd.\u201d\n\nUltimately, though, both said they were happy that Newsom agreed to an exemption that Brown rejected and viewed it as an opening to push further next year.\n\n\u201cThese things happen,\u201d Gonzalez said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was intentional, I don\u2019t think they were trying to deceive us. I just think it was miscommunication. I think we\u2019re all trying to figure out how this governor communicates.\"\n\nLabor fight\n\n\n\nOn one of the year\u2019s signature issues \u2014 a battle over labor in the gig economy, which pitted tech companies against organized labor \u2014 Newsom\u2019s attempts to balance both sides fueled discontent. Unions wanted to enshrine in state law a California Supreme Court ruling deeming more workers to be employees, rather than independent contractors, with Assembly Bill 5. Tech companies like Uber said re-classification would be ruinous for their business models.\n\nWhile Newsom ended up proclaiming his support for AB 5, his administration\u2019s role in seeking a compromise at times alienated organized labor. That was illustrated most starkly when the head of California\u2019s powerful building trades union lost a spot on a Future of Work panel and then blasted the Newsom for his openness to the gig companies.\n\nJust hours after the Legislature passed AB 5, with supporters assailing gig companies and lauding a watershed moment for workers, The Wall Street Journal published a story in which Newsom said he was \u201ccommitted\u201d to continuing negotiations with \u201cUber, Lyft, DoorDash, others, some of the gig platforms.\u201d A day later, Uber would cite that language in a press release essentially defying California by saying the company would not re-classify workers.\n\nSome within labor seethed. In their moment of triumph, here was the governor sending a signal of encouragement to companies they\u2019d just denounced as standing in the way of progress.\n\nRent bill\n\n\n\nOn renters\u2019 issues, too, Newsom sowed confusion before eventually striking a far-reaching deal.\n\nAfter breaking with many Democrats by not supporting a 2018 rent control ballot initiative, Newsom said early in the year he would support a rent deal. But his engagement on the issue was uneven in the early going, sources said, and O\u2019Leary ended up calling members to apologize after she promised housing advocates that Newsom wanted to move every rent bill then before them \u2014 a surprise to lawmakers who had not heard from Newsom\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cThis was a brand-new administration, so people were still learning about and figuring out how to negotiate with the governor and his staff,\u201d said a lawmaker who asked not to be named in order to speak freely, \u201cand that wasn\u2019t a helpful moment.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, when Newsom told reporters in August about engaging in a \u201clong overdue\u201d effort to enact renter protections and avert \u201canother costly ballot fight,\u201d he surprised lawmakers by trying to push the process forward. His office subsequently increased its engagement, producing a deal that surmounted opposition from real estate agents to pass. The final result \u2014 a win for the governor \u2014 belied the confusing and choppy process.\n\nLegislators had similar criticisms of the administration pushing for tough votes in a manner seen as demanding a win without taking their starkly different political milieus into account. Tensions tautened as Newsom and his staff pushed lawmakers to pass a clean drinking water tax, a signature issue of his that collided with an aversion to new taxes among legislators in competitive districts, or to conform California\u2019s tax code to federal changes in order to fund an expanded earned-income tax credit.\n\nA senior legislative staffer summarized those conversations as: \u201cI\u2019m not negotiating, I\u2019m just listening to a laundry list of their desires which they attribute to the governor.\u201d\n\nBetter than a surprise veto\n\n\n\nOthers, however, saw it as preferable to learning of the governor\u2019s opposition via a veto message, particularly given how many legislators tried again with Newsom on bills Brown had nixed.\n\nAnd Newsom earned praise for getting results on thorny but urgent issues like housing. Dan Dunmoyer, who served in the Schwarzenegger administration and now heads the California Building Industry Association, said it was \u201cvery common\u201d for a first-year governor to experience growing pains with hammering out a negotiating style and establishing a clear staff hierarchy \u2014 and he said Newsom still came through on a central campaign vow.\n\n\u201cHousing has been something he kept front and center from a policy and public communication perspective. his predecessor didn\u2019t do that,\u201d Dunmoyer said, adding that \u201cthe governor has made it politically cool to talk about trying to solve the housing crisis \u2026 rhetoric does matter when it comes to pushing policy.\u201d\n\nAssemblyman David Chiu (D-San Francisco) carried the rent cap bill that Newsom\u2019s dealmaking helped push across the finish line despite opposition from the politically powerful California Association of Realtors. Chiu acknowledged that the bill \u201cexperienced a circuitous route\u201d and that Newsom\u2019s public call for a deal surprised him, but he said Newsom still played an invaluable role.\n\n\u201cWe were very appreciative of governor\u2019s engagement,\u201d Chiu said.", "description": "Some observers attributed missteps and muddled communications to the Capitol inexperience of Newsom himself and top aides.", "authors": ["Jeremy B.
