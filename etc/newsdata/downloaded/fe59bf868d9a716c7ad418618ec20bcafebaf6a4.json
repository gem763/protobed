The only other occurrence? Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game in 1962. He's also just the sixth Laker to ever put up 40 points and 20 rebounds, joining Elgin Baylor (did it 34 times), Chamberlain (5), George Mikan (4), Shaquille O'Neal (2) and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (2).", "description": "His 40 points, 20 rebounds and 26 free throws are basically unheard of.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/L3ZPzFh23XvZKt_XCWf7-wUHAT0=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/10/30/1572437074514.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
