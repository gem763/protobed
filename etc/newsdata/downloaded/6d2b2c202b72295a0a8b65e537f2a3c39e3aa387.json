No British prime minister has ever been impeached - only ministers - and the last attempted impeachment of a minister was in 1806\n\nLabour MP Stephen Kinnock said he believed a vote of no confidence would happen once they could be sure a no-deal Brexit was \"taken off the table\".\n\nHe said Mr Johnson was unlikely to stand down of his own free will and would \"squat in Number 10,\" adding that MPs would have to \"take matters intro our own hands in Parliament\".\n\nLiberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson said Mr Johnson had shown he was \"not fit to be prime minister\" and should resign.\n\nFormer Justice Secretary David Gauke was among the MPs expelled from the Conservative Party by Mr Johnson for voting against his Brexit plans, but he said he would not be calling for the PM to resign or backing a no-confidence vote in him.\n\n\"I think the prime minister can survive,\" he told BBC News, but only if he apologised for \"what was done earlier this month in terms of proroguing Parliament\" and changes his Brexit strategy and sacks chief adviser Dominic Cummings.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption SNP's Ian Blackford, Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville-Roberts and Green Party MP Caroline Lucas celebrate outside the Supreme Court\n\nJeremy Corbyn had been due to deliver his keynote speech at Labour's conference on Wednesday but will now address delegates later on Tuesday.\n\nLabour's deputy leader Tom Watson, who had been due to speak on Tuesday, said: \"This is a momentous day.\n\n\"It's right that Jeremy closes the conference this afternoon.
