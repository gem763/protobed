The ETN will also be issued its own International Securities Identification Number.\n\nHandelsblatt states that, while Iconic is based in Frankfurt, the ETN will be regulated by Luxembourg\u2019s finance watchdog, the Luxembourg Financial Supervisory Authority.\n\nThe startup will directly invest collected funds into Bitcoin, which will be purchased by major United States-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. While Coinbase is headquartered in the U.S., it has expanded rapidly into other jurisdictions, including Europe, over the last year.\n\nETNs are seen as a gateway for crypto ETFs\n\nETNs are considered by some to be a \u201csoft\u201d version of another financial product, the exchange-traded fund (ETF). While an ETF is a security that tracks an index of funds, a commodity or a basket of assets, ETNs are backed by its issuers.\n\nThe eventual introduction of a cryptocurrency ETF is often regarded as a signal that the market has matured, as it will offer major institutional investors exposure to crypto assets. Investors have met crypto ETNs with less enthusiasm than a possible ETF.\n\nSome experts see Bitcoin ETNs as a vanguard for other financial products involving the asset. The head of the Blockchain Center of the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management Philip Sandner said:\n\n\u201cIconic has convinced both regulators and Deutsche B\u00f6rse. The listing of their Bitcoin product on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is a remarkable step [...] A true Bitcoin ETF Europe is thus a significant step closer.\u201d\n\nRegulators, meanwhile, are skeptical of both crypto ETNs and ETFs. Earlier this month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected an application by Bitwise to list a Bitcoin ETF on NYSE Arca.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Financial Conduct Authority is mulling a ban on cryptocurrency ETNs. Coinshares, a British public exchange, recently published a letter on its website, urging its customers to fight the proposed ban.", "description": "A German startup is reportedly aiming to list a Bitcoin exchange-traded note on the Frankfurt and Luxembourg stock exchanges by December", "authors": ["Aaron Wood"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy81OTBmZDM0MDZkYTI2MDc5YmZhYTU3MDlmZWUxMTc3My5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
