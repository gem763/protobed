The number of millionaires would also grow over this period to almost 63 million.\n\nThe share of the world's bottom 90% accounts for 18% of global wealth, compared to 11% in the 2000.\n\n\"While it is too early to say wealth inequality is now in a downward phase, the prevailing evidence suggests that 2016 may have been the peak for the near future,\" it said.
