He made headlines last year when he revealed how he 'wailed' when a mother begged him not to take her children away. He told BBC Inside Out West: 'A mother got on her hands and knees in court and begged me, \"Please don't do this. Please don't take my children away.\" 'She said that she would end her life if I made the order. 'I came down to my room and I sat at my desk and wailed. 'But if you don't, if that doesn't affect you, there is something really, really wrong with you.' In June this year, the judge revealed a woman who had had seven babies taken away from her was pregnant with her eighth child. The woman, who is in her late 20s, is due to give birth to her eighth child later this year, a hearing in Bristol heard. Judge Stephen Wildblood said her parenting ability had been assessed many times, and it was found she could 'not parent a child safely or adequately.' He praised the 'enormous efforts' made by social workers who had tried to see if she could care for a child with professional support. But he said the woman has 'learning limitations', has led a 'very unsettled' life and experienced 'so much distress and hardship'. The judge said, during the latest stage of litigation, he had ruled that the woman's seventh child should be placed for adoption.\n\nJudge Wildblood added: 'No professional has suggested that there is anything about this father that renders him unsuited to have contact with his children.\n\n'There have been consistent recommendations throughout the eight-year history of these proceedings from a wide spectrum of professionals that contact should take place between the father and the children.\n\n'All professionals involved in this case have concluded that the mother has alienated the children from the father.'\n\nJudge Wildblood said the children would have nothing to do with their father or his family.\n\nThey would not acknowledge cards or presents, expressed 'unjustified and illogical' complaints about his letters, and had 'false memories' of how he had behaved towards them.\n\nThe judge said it was 'beyond doubt' that the children would suffer 'significant and long-term emotional harm'.\n\nHe added: 'I am afraid that the cause of that harm lies squarely with this mother.\n\n'Whatever may be her difficulties, she is an adult and a parent with parental responsibility for her children.\n\n'That parental responsibility, which she shares with the father, requires her to act in the best interests of her children.\n\n'It also required her to promote the relationship between these children and their father. She has failed to do so.'\n\nJudge Wildblood ended his ruling with a message to the man, saying: 'This has been a long, heart-breaking and expensive set of events for you to endure. I am truly sorry.'\n\nThis comes after a woman recently lost a fight over the care of her 12-year-old son after a High Court judge concluded that she had alienated the youngster from his father.\n\nThe boy, who has been at the centre of a family court battle between his separated parents for most of his life, was living with his mother.\n\nBut Mr Justice Keehan decided that the boy must move to live with his father, after deciding the woman had 'alienated' the boy from her ex-husband.\n\nThe judge said the boy was suffering 'emotional and social harm' because of his father's 'absence'.\n\nHe outlined detail of the case in a ruling published online after analysing evidence at a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in London. He said the man lived in the south of England and the woman in the Midlands.", "description": "Chief family judge in Bristol, Stephen Wildblood, apologised to the father, who he said was an 'intelligent and loving parent' who had spent eight years fighting for his children.", "authors": ["Amie Gordon For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/23/16/20090026-0-image-a-14_1571844819867.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
