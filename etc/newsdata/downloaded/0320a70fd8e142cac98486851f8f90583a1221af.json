Further Kerry Stokes has stated that the reporting of the conversation was wrong.\u201d", "description": "Presumably, Lachlan Murdoch is the one hypersensitive to the retelling of \"Malcolm's got to go\".", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5519%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/dfa3336431738f1b65d96023de764774e337969c", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
