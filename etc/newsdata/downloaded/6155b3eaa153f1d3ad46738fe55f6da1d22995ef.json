He said it is stealing intellectual property, deploying mass surveillance, violating the rights of minority Uighurs, interfering in the South China Sea and allowing deadly fentanyl to flow to the U.S.\n\nHe said past administrations allowed these problems to fester.\n\n\u201cThe political establishment was not only silent in the face of China\u2019s economic aggression and human rights abuses, but enabled them,\u201d he said. \u201cAs each year passed \u2014 as each factory closed in the heartland, and each new skyscraper went up in Beijing \u2014 American workers grew only more disheartened, and China grew only more emboldened.\u201d\n\nHe said Mr. Trump is tilting the balance back, boosting America\u2019s fortunes while \u201cChina\u2019s economy continues to fall behind.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Pence said the U.S. is not trying to \u201cdecouple\u201d from China or dance on Beijing\u2019s misfortune.\n\nHe said Mr. Trump is heartened by China\u2019s agreement to purchase more U.S. farm products as part of an emerging, \u201cphase-one\u201d agreement that could pave the way to a broader trade pact. As it stands, both sides are negotiating a way out of a trade war that\u2019s resulted in tit-for-tat tariffs on billions of dollars in goods.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump still believes Beijing wants to make a deal,\u201d Mr. Pence said.\n\nThe vice president said the administration is talking tough because it wants better for China.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, for the first time in decades, under President Donald Trump, the United States is treating China\u2019s leaders exactly how the leaders of any great world power should be treated: with respect, yes, but also with consistency and candor,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. Pence aimed that candor at China\u2019s crackdown on Hong Kong, going much further than Mr. Trump has been willing to go in his rhetoric.\n\nPro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong have been demonstrating against Beijing for months. The protests were sparked by a now-withdrawn extradition bill, though their demands reach deeper.\n\n\u201cHong Kong is a living example of what can happen when China embraces liberty,\u201d Mr. Pence said at the Wilson International Center for Scholars. \u201cAnd yet, for the last few years, Beijing has increased its interventions in Hong Kong and engaged in actions that curtail the rights and liberties that Hong Kong\u2019s people were guaranteed through a binding international agreement.\u201d\n\nMr. Pence also said American entities of getting their priorities wrong. He accused a major sportswear company of \u201cchecking its social conscience at the door\u201d and took the National Basketball Association to task for its reluctance to take on China over Hong Kong abuses.\n\n\u201cNike stores in China actually removed their Houston Rockets merchandise from their shelves to join the Chinese government in protest against the Rockets general manager\u2019s seven-word tweet: \u2018Fight for Freedom, stand with Hong Kong,\u2019\u201d Mr. Pence said.\n\n\u201cAnd some of the NBA\u2019s biggest players and owners, who routinely exercise their freedom to criticize this country, lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of other peoples,\u201d he said. \u201cIn siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump has called for a \u201chumane\u201d solution to the Hong Kong situation and mixed support for the semi-autonomous island with praise for Chinese President Xi Jinping. He says the Communist leader is a capable man who could sort out the situation by meeting with protest leaders.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
