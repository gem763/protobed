His marker, Conor Coady, appeared to have him where he wanted him. But in the blink of an eye, everything changed \u2013 in more than one way.\n\nEverybody has seen the move because that is what happens when a player does something outrageous in a Chelsea shirt to complete a hat\u2011trick. It is on Match of the Day and all over social media but it still bears retelling.\n\nTammy Abraham revels up front but Chelsea need to tighten up at the back Read more\n\nThere was the little touch inside with the right instep, followed in the same smooth movement with one from the outside of the same boot. Then there was the burst of acceleration, which Coady did not see coming. Who did? Quite simply, it destroyed him. Coady, it should be noted, is an excellent defender. But Abraham was away and he dispatched a low finish into the far corner.\n\nIt was a jaw-dropper and, in terms of sheer explosiveness, it recalled Fernando Torres in his Liverpool pomp. Abraham has offered glimpses of his qualities this season but this was his best goal so far \u2013 the one that took him to seven in the Premier League \u2013 and it showed plenty of onlookers something they had not seen previously in his game.\n\nFrank Lampard was not among them. \u201cI wasn\u2019t surprised because I\u2019ve seen Tammy do that in training,\u201d the Chelsea manager says. \u201cOn different occasions, he can pull the ball out of the sky, do a bit of skill \u2013 not things that lead direct to a goal like that but, if you watch his game, you\u2019ll see that in him. He has all these attributes and he has to maximise all of them. That bit of magic is something pretty special.\u201d\n\nFor Abraham, it is about continuing to add fresh layers as he plays on English football\u2019s biggest stage; about building on his eye-catching start to the season. At Stamford Bridge on Sunday, the 21\u2011year\u2011old faces a potentially defining moment. Can he do it against Liverpool and Virgil van Dijk? Abraham made his Chelsea debut against Liverpool as a substitute in a 1-1 draw at Anfield under Guus Hiddink in May 2016. He carries a greater responsibility now.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s normal that the top strikers are judged on goals and the next level of that is do you score goals against the big teams?\u201d Lampard says. \u201cI understand that because against someone like Van Dijk, a defence like Liverpool\u2019s and a team like Liverpool, maybe it\u2019s harder to create chances. So it\u2019s what can you do individually to try and create them, and how clinical can you be after that?\n\n\u201cTammy has shown great signs this season but it will be another test on the way. It\u2019s not the be all and end all day and we make our judgments after this but for the top strikers like Didier Drogba \u2026 we all remember the amount of times he scored in finals and semi-finals and really important games, and I think, quite rightly, players are judged on that.\u201d\n\nMason Mount already a go-to man for Lampard in his new-look Chelsea | Jacob Steinberg Read more\n\nChelsea against Liverpool became a heated rivalry during Lampard\u2019s time as a player at Stamford Bridge. It was sparked in 2004-05, when Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was newly appointed as Chelsea\u2019s manager and Rafael Ben\u00edtez had gone to Liverpool the same summer. Towards the end of the season, the latter oversaw a 1-0 Champions League semi-final victory courtesy of Luis Garc\u00eda\u2019s disputed goal.\n\nLiverpool would beat Chelsea again in the Champions League semi-final the following season before Chelsea knocked them out in a 2007-08 semi-final and a quarter\u2011final a year later. There were numerous league and cup clashes and Lampard, whose team lost the European Super Cup to Liverpool on penalties in August, when Abraham missed the decisive kick, believes that the fixture has lost none of its spice.\n\n\u201cTimes have changed slightly but it doesn\u2019t change that feeling, the fans feel it and the players have to feel it,\u201d Lampard says. \u201cIt\u2019s a game that does involve a lot of passion. If your levels aren\u2019t there as they should be it\u2019s a game that will go away from you quickly. So my first thing to say to the players is: \u2019Feel this game and recognise what it is.\u2019 Because it always does have an edge.\u201d\n\nLampard felt that Chelsea should have won rather than lost to Valencia at home in the Champions League on Tuesday but, with Ross Barkley\u2019s penalty going over off the bar, they were undone by a momentary lapse for the only goal. \u201cIt\u2019s hugely about how focused and concentrated we are,\u201d Lampard says. \u201cValencia taught us a lesson and one second was all it took. That\u2019s the level we\u2019re at. Liverpool can really hurt you in one second.\u201d\n\nCoady and Wolves would say the same about Abraham.", "description": "Chelsea striker\u2019s hat-trick got everyone talking at Molineux last weekend but now he comes up against Virgil van Dijk", "authors": ["David Hytner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/428b6bffe7fa01defce14a930163112ccc064b5f/0_192_3090_1855/master/3090.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ebe5d43597a10de536e4aa2e63f7b037", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
