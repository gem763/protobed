(Brian Snyder/Reuters)\n\nThe indictment names UCLA men's soccer head coach Jorge Salcedo, UCLA women's soccer head coach Ali Khosroshahin and UCLA women's assistant soccer coach Lara Janke as co-conspirators.\n\nFake soccer profile\n\nAuthorities claim Sui sent photos of her son playing tennis that were manipulated by Janke to create a false soccer profile that included faked photos and awards and claims he was a top player for two elite soccer clubs in Canada.\n\nThe profile was used by Salcedo to recommend the son for a 25 per cent soccer scholarship to UCLA. Salcedo further vouched for his admission by falsely claiming he had seen the son play in China, and that \"he has good quickness and speed.\"\n\nDuring a conference call on Oct. 24, 2018, Singer told Sui to transfer him $100,000 to pay off the soccer coach, which she did. The indictment says Singer paid Khosroshahin $25,000 for \"brokering\" the designation of the son as a soccer recruit.\n\nJorge Salcedo, the former men's soccer head coach at UCLA, was allegedly paid $100,000 for his part in the scheme. (Brian Snyder/Reuters)\n\nIn November 2018, the son signed an official letter of intent to play for the UCLA men's soccer team.\n\nIn February 2019, Sui wired the remaining $300,000 from Canada to a bank account in Massachusetts controlled by Singer.\n\nArrested in Spain\n\nSui was arrested this month in Spain and is being detained pending extradition to Boston.\n\nSinger, Khosroshahin and Janke have all pleaded guilty to various charges in the wider scandal, which involves dozens of wealthy parents accused of paying bribes and lying to officials to get their children into prestigious U.S. colleges.\n\nSalcedo has pleaded not guilty.\n\nNone of the allegations against Sui have been tested in court.\n\nA charge of conspiracy to commit wire and federal programs bribery comes with a maximum prison sentence of five years.\n\nInternational money laundering and wire fraud charges each carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.\n\nUCLA previously declined to comment on the status of Sui's son, citing policy that bans school official from commenting on individual applicants.\n\nEarlier this year, Vancouver businessman David Sidoo pleaded not guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit money laundering after allegedly paying Singer $200,000 US to have someone pose as his two sons to write their B.C. high school exams and SATs, a standardized college admission test.", "description": "U.S. authorities have laid four more charges against Xiaoning Sui alleging she paid $400,000 in bribes to get her son into UCLA.", "authors": ["Karin Larsen Is A Former Olympian", "Award Winning Sports Broadcaster Covering Bc Teams", "Athletes For Years."], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5295929.1569358281!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/college-admissions-bribery.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
