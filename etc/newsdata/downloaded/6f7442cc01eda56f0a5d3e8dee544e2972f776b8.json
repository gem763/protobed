Heather Long on the minority women changing the makeup of the U.S. workforce. And Nick Miroff explains the Supreme Court\u2019s move on a Trump administration asylum policy.\n\nPost Reports is the daily podcast from The Washington Post. Unparalleled reporting. Expert insight. Clear analysis. Everything you\u2019ve come to expect from the newsroom of The Post -- for your ears.\n\nThe changing face of school integration\n\nThe number of children attending U.S. public schools with students of other races has nearly doubled over the past quarter-century, a Washington Post analysis has found.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd while schools in newly diverse districts have high levels of integration, historically diverse districts are far more segregated today, with children in most big cities and many suburbs locked in deeply segregated school districts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis comes as the nation reaches a demographic tipping point: According to Census Bureau projections, there will be more children of color than white children in the United States in 2020.\n\n\n\n\n\nReporter Laura Meckler traveled to a small town in Colorado\u2019s Roaring Fork Valley near Aspen. Twenty-five years ago, the valley\u2019s school district was 11 percent Latino. Now, Latinos represent more than half of all students. \u201cThe school district is far more integrated than what you find in big cities,\u201d Meckler says.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut in Denver, Meckler found that segregation is still entrenched. Once a court order for mandatory busing was lifted in the district, \u201cthe schools almost immediately re-segregated,\u201d Meckler says \u2013 a result of school choice, the nation\u2019s history of redlining and a sense of community that some neighborhoods don\u2019t want to give up.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen of color are surging into the U.S. workforce\n\nThe U.S. workforce has crossed a historic threshold: For the first time, most new hires of prime working age (25 to 54) are people of color, according to a Washington Post analysis of data the Labor Department has collected since the 1970s.\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen have predominantly driven this trend since 2015 and have begun to reshape the demographics of the workforce as many white baby boomers retire. The question remains, says economics reporter Heather Long , whether women of color will be able to hold on to these gains as the economy stalls.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cA recession is going to hurt a lot of people,\u201d Long says, \u201cbut it particularly tends to hurt people who just got into the workforce. It\u2019s that old mantra of \u2018last in, first out.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:\n\n\n\n\n\nTrump administration can continue to curb Central American migration\n\nIn July, the Trump administration sharply restricted access to the asylum system for anyone who did not seek protection from other countries before crossing the southern border.\n\n\n\n\n\nA federal district judge in California quickly issued a nationwide injunction against the law. But on Wednesday, the Supreme Court lifted the lower court\u2019s block, making it easier \u2013 until ongoing legal challenges have been completed in lower courts \u2013 for the administration to turn away migrants fleeing violence and oppressive regimes in Central and South America.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThis is such a radical departure from existing practice, because the Immigration and Nationality Act for decades has made fairly explicit that if you show up on U.S. soil, you have the right to access the U.S. legal system,\u201d policy reporter Nick Miroff says.\n\n\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s no longer the case.\n\n\n\n\n\nMore on this topic:", "description": "Laura Meckler examines what school segregation looks like today.
