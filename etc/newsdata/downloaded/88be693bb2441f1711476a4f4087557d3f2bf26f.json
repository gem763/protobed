Soft toilet paper is a relatively recent luxury. In living memory many homes made do with cut-up newspapers and could again in an emergency.\n\nThe Guardian would be eminently suitable for such a purpose.\n\nI'm sure it won't come to that, though. Frankly, I don't believe any of these hysterical doomsday scenarios with which we have been bombarbed ever since we voted Leave.\n\nToilet tissue is simply the latest commodity we are told will disappear from the shelves if we 'crash out' of the EU, along with everything from vital medicines to fancy sparkling water.\n\nThe society magazine Tatler has published a cut-out-and-keep guide to those essentials its readers should stockpile.\n\nI'd like to think it was tongue in cheek, but these days, with no end in sight to Brexit Derangement Syndrome, you never can tell.\n\nAnyway, top priority should be given to buying up all available supplies of Evian mineral water, which can also be used for washing and flushing toilets when the mains water and sewage system collapses due to Brexit.\n\nThe Government is said to also be worried about a mass outbreak of dogging among lorry drivers caught up in tailbacks at the Channel ports (stock image)\n\nTatler readers are also advised to stock up on Le Creuset saucepans, L'Occitane en Provence almond shower gel, Veuve Clicquot champagne, Leoube Premium olive oil and Ladur\u00e9e Macarons \u2014 a favourite, apparently, of the Duchess of Sussex.\n\nHeaven forfend that Meghan might run out of pistachio-flavoured pastries.\n\nMy favourite horror story came from an unnamed Cabinet minister, who is predicting a rise in dogging in the event of a No Deal Brexit.\n\nThere's another one of those sentences I never expected to read, let alone write.\n\nTo be honest, I didn't even realise that dogging was a thing any more. It was fashionable a few years ago, but I assumed its day had passed, along with iPods and Rubik's Cubes.\n\nFor a while, the hilarious antics of dedicated doggers provided plenty of fun for this column and gave Gary a wonderful range of material for his cartoons.\n\nMany of those gathering in car parks and local beauty spots to have casual sex, while others watched, decided to spice things up by wearing fancy dress.\n\nI can remember reporting on a number of dogging-related incidents featuring people dressed as everything from Tinkerbell to Elvis Presley.\n\nIf half the Project Fear scare stories were true, you might have thought that people would be deserting Britain. Yet only yesterday, it was revealed that record numbers of EU nationals have successfully applied to stay permanently in this country (stock image)\n\nInevitably, Oompa Loompas were also involved.\n\nCould we soon see a return to these golden days of roadside debauchery?\n\nThe Government is said to be worried about a mass outbreak of dogging among lorry drivers caught up in tailbacks at the Channel ports.\n\nAccording to the anonymous minister: 'One of the things we talk about in our No Deal meetings concerns hauliers and their activities. There are dogging hotspots all over the place.'\n\nPlanners are concerned that drivers facing delays of up to two-and-a-half days because they haven't got the right paperwork after October 31 will resort to having sex with strangers to pass the time.\n\nWhere did that idea come from? While one arm of the Government is fretting about serious shortages of drugs like insulin, another is drawing up contingency plans to cope with an increase in dogging.\n\nYou couldn't make it up.\n\nWhy do the planners assume that bored lorry drivers will choose to whittle away the long hours going at it like rabbits in lay-bys?\n\nPerhaps they will use the time productively to play Sudoku or learn a foreign language.\n\nFunnily enough, it's only British lorry drivers that ministers are exercised about. They appear to believe that foreign hauliers have no appetite for dogging.\n\nEven so, what is the Government proposing to do about it? There aren't enough coppers to go round, as it is.\n\nAnd those we do have all seem to have been drafted into London to deal with the climate change maniacs.\n\nWill the fire brigade be called in to turn the hoses on them?\n\nOr, more likely, will teams of sexual health workers be employed to hand out free condoms, on the basis that if lorry drivers must indulge in dogging at least we can encourage them to practise safe dogging.\n\nI'm afraid if you were expecting a learned treatise on Brexit from me today, you'll be disappointed.\n\nNo one has got the faintest idea what's going to happen.\n\nAnd anyone who says they have is a liar.\n\nMaybe Boris and Lenny Verruca will cobble together some shoddy compromise on the Irish bus-stop.\n\nPerhaps the Eurocrats will drop their overt hostility to Brexit and cease insulting our intelligence.\n\nIf even half the Project Fear scare stories were true, you might have thought that people would by now be deserting Britain.\n\nYet only yesterday, it was revealed that record numbers of EU nationals have successfully applied to stay permanently in this country.\n\nMore than 1.5 million have already been granted settled status and the same number again are expected to apply before Christmas.\n\nDismal defeatists like Spread Fear Phil \u2014 making himself busy all across the airwaves yesterday \u2014 continue to paint a picture of a No Deal Britain turning into a post-apocalyptic wasteland.\n\nClearly, it's not a vision shared by EU immigrants who have made their homes here. Otherwise they'd be heading back home in droves on the first available Eurostar.\n\nNo, like the 17.4 million of us who voted Leave, our new fellow countrymen and women believe a post-Brexit, properly independent Britain has a shining future.\n\nAnd, if all else fails, at least there's the great dogging revival to look forward to.\n\nSomehow, despite the doomsters, I think we'll be fine \u2014 toilet roll shortage or not.\n\nBy inclination, I\u2019m not in favour of banning anything. Provided, of course, it doesn\u2019t make other people\u2019s lives a misery.\n\nI\u2019ve never understood, for instance, why you can\u2019t have smoking pubs and non-smoking pubs. It\u2019s called freedom of choice.\n\nYet I find myself, against my better instincts, drawn towards the suggestion that people should be banned from eating on public transport.\n\nNot that I\u2019m in favour of the nanny state. And people shouldn\u2019t be stopped from munching a Mars bar on a bus.\n\nThere\u2019s a time and place for everything, however.\n\nOne of the joys of our civilisation was always sitting in a proper restaurant carriage, eating a British Rail Full English Breakfast, complete with silver cutlery and a large Bloody Mary.\n\nBy comparison, nothing is worse than being crammed on a crowded train or bus next to someone tucking into a greasy three-course Happy Meal out of a cardboard box.\n\nSo I\u2019d definitely ban the consumption of all hot food, especially on the London Underground.\n\nUntil, that is, they get round to putting buffet cars on the Piccadilly Line.\n\nThe eco-protester who made a name for himself 20-odd years ago is in the news again as a result of the latest climate change demonstrations\n\nSwamped by Swampy\n\nSwampy\u2019s back! The eco-protester who made a name for himself 20-odd years ago is in the news again as a result of the latest climate change demonstrations.\n\nDaniel Hooper, now 46, is still at it.\n\nHe was recently in court after handcuffing himself to a concrete block on the road to an oil refinery in Wales.\n\nI only ever came across him the once.\n\nI was waiting for the lift at London Weekend Television, when the doors opened and out walked Swampy, who was recording Have I Got News For You in another studio.\n\nAs he emerged, I stepped in with my producer. Big mistake. Trust me, you\u2019ve never smelt anything like it.\n\nHere was a man who lived up to his nickname.\n\nWe had to evacuate immediately and take the stairs. LWT was forced to cordon off the lift and fumigate it.\n\nHow Merton and Hislop managed to sit alongside him for however long it took to record the show, I\u2019ll never know.\n\nIs it too much to hope that in the intervening two decades he\u2019s had a bath?\n\nGiven that he lives in a teepee, I doubt it.
