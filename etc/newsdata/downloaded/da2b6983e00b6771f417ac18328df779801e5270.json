Make no mistake: neither the fictional character Joker, nor the film, is an endorsement of real-world violence of any kind. It is not the intention of the film, the filmmakers or the studio to hold this character up as a hero.\"\n\nVolsky noted efforts made by other companies to limit gun violence, including Walmart's decision to limit the sales of guns and ammunition after two deadly shootings at its stores within a week of one another.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n\"Joker\" tells the story of Arthur Fleck and his progression toward becoming the evil character.\n\nIt has received mainly rave reviews, but some critics have questioned its violence.\n\nTime's Stephanie Zacharek said the Joker is empowered by his killing in the film, which happens \"usually with a gun.\"\n\n\"But it's not as if we don't know how this pathology works: In America, there's a mass shooting or attempted act of violence by a guy like Arthur practically every other week,\" she wrote.\n\nPhoenix was recently asked by The Telegraph if he thought the movie would inspire \"exactly the kind of people it's about, with potentially tragic results.\" The actor reportedly stammered, saying, \"Why would you...?\" before walking out.\n\nPhillips said she worries about the same thing and hopes Warner Bros. will take action since the film is well on its way to being released.\n\n\"There are people that will be encouraged towards violence because of this movie. There will be people who are triggered with their PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) because of this movie,\" she said. \"It's very important that corporations have a duty to society, and not just their bottom line.\"", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
