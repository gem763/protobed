The NY Times reported on the reasons for his win:\n\nMr. Abiy, 43, broke through two decades of frozen conflict between his vast country, Africa\u2019s second most populous, and Eritrea, its small and isolated neighbor. When he became prime minister of Ethiopia in 2018, he threw himself at a breakneck pace into reforms at home, and peace negotiations with the rebel-turned-dictator Isaias Afwerki, president of Eritrea\u2026 In its official announcement, the Nobel Committee detailed a litany of accomplishments for Mr. Abiy in his first 100 days as prime minister: lifting the country\u2019s state of emergency, granting amnesty to thousands of political prisoners, discontinuing media censorship, legalizing outlawed opposition groups, dismissing military and civilian leaders suspected of corruption, and increasing the influence of women in political and community life.\n\nSounds pretty impressive but those explanations didn\u2019t sit well with fans of another Peace Prize nominee: Greta Thunberg. Thunberg had been expected to win by odds makers in London and was the person picked by most people making actual bets:\n\nShe is the bookies\u2019 favourite to scoop the prize, with London-based betting company Coral putting her at 1/2 odds. Another British bookmaker, William Hill, which put Thunberg at odds of 8/13, said Wednesday that 96% of Nobel Peace Prize bets had been placed on Thunberg.\n\nAfter her surprising loss, Newsweek published a story headlined, \u201cGreta Thunberg Snubbed for Nobel Peach Prize by Committee Run by Norway, One of the World\u2019s Biggest Oil and Natural Gas Exporters.\u201d What\u2019s striking about the story is that, despite the loaded headline, it doesn\u2019t actually attempt to make the case that Thunberg was snubbed. All it really does is point out Norway\u2019s oil and gas exports and combine that with criticisms from Greenpeace:\n\nWhile it strives to be a \u201clow carbon society\u201d by 2050\u2014committing to the goal in legislation\u2014and pushes for environmental policy, it remains one of the world\u2019s largest exporters of oil and natural gas. According to the CIA, Norway is the world\u2019s third-largest natural gas exporter, behind Russia and Qatar. Somini Sengupta, writing in the New York Times in 2017 calls this conflict between \u201cclimate leader\u201d and \u201coil giant\u201d a \u201cNorwegian Paradox.\u201d \u201cNorway has for the last 50 years or so developed its dependency on oil, which has also given us a wealth other countries can barely dream of,\u201d a spokesperson from Greenpeace Norway told Newsweek. \u201cWe are in a climate crisis, and the world can\u2019t afford Norway to keep its double standards the way it does now.\u201d\n\nFrom this, I guess we\u2019re supposed to infer the worst about the Committee\u2019s hidden motives. After all, what else could possibly explain Thunberg\u2019s unexpected loss? But the Washington Post reports that not everyone was surprised she didn\u2019t win:\n\nHenrik Urdal, head of the Peace Research Institute of Oslo, omitted Thunberg from the Nobel Peace Prize shortlist he publishes. He explained his decision to The Washington Post, saying there \u201cisn\u2019t scientific consensus that there is a linear relationship between climate change \u2014 or resource scarcity, more broadly \u2014 and armed conflict.\u201d Janne Haaland Matlary, a politics professor at the University of Oslo, agreed that Thunberg was a \u201cwild card\u201d nominee. The link between climate change and conflict is still \u201cquite tenuous at this point,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone sees flooding can cause conflict, migration and so on, but this is in no way well established as a security policy issue yet.\u201d\n\nOne big problem with the Norway-is-corrupt theory being promoted by Newsweek: Al Gore and the IPCC were awarded the prize in 2007. In announcing the prize, the Nobel Committee said that Gore had \u201cstrengthened the struggle against climate change.\u201d But the Post reports that since then the Nobel Committee is trying to stick to awarding the prize to people trying to sort out actual conflicts, e.g. the one in Ethiopia.\n\nThis is going to be a big disappointment to all of the people arguing that climate change is the new World War II. The Nobel Committee just said it doesn\u2019t buy that argument.", "description": "How dare you!", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Karen Townsend", "Ed Morrissey", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Greta-Thunberg.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
