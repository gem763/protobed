If they put maximum pressure aside, the path to negotiation will open.\u201d\n\nPresident Rouhani is set to meet the French president for an hour-long meeting soon after he arrives in New York and their two foreign ministers are also set to have a long meeting on the sidelines of the UNGA, sources have told The Independent.", "description": "Iran\u2019s top diplomats have said they will not enter into negotiations until the US stops its campaign of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d on Tehran, making bilateral talks between\u00a0leaders attending the meeting of United Nations General Assembly this week highly unlikely.
