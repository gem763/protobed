Aggarwal, who was not involved in the study. Aggarwal, a member of the American Academy of Neurology, is co-leader of the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center in Chicago.\n\nA significant study\n\nOver 1,600 Japanese men and women without dementia were followed over a 10-year period. A blood test for trans fat levels was done at the start of the study and their diets were analyzed.\n\nResearchers then adjusted for other factors that could affect the risk of dementia, such as high blood pressure, diabetes and smoking. They found that people with the two highest levels of trans fats were 52% and 74% more likely to develop dementia than those with the lowest levels.\n\nRead More", "description": "The trans fats still hidden in many foods increased the risk of Alzheimer's and other types of dementia by up to 75%, according to a long-term study.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190402222719-08-diet-sins-pastries-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
