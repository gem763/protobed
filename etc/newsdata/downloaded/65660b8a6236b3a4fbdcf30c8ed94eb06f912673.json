The Attorney General for the Garden State, Gurbir Grewal, has issued marching orders to the Sheriff\u2019s Departments in both Cape May and Monmouth counties, telling them that they can no longer take part in voluntary law enforcement programs allowing them to cooperate with ICE in certain immigration matters. He arrived at this decision despite specific, valid requests from the Sheriffs that they be exempted from the new rules. (CBS New York)\n\nNew Jersey\u2019s attorney general is ordering two counties to end their cooperation agreements with federal immigration authorities.\n\nState Attorney General Gurbir Grewal says the Immigrant Trust Directive issued last year limits law enforcement\u2019s cooperation with ICE. But sheriff\u2019s departments in Cape May and Monmouth counties still maintain agreements to perform some immigration functions. The attorney general says those agreements prevent victims from reporting crimes.\n\nNone of this is happening in a vacuum. The AG has been going after these counties all year to demonstrate his woke credentials and battle the evil that is ICE. But when the Sheriffs made their request to be exempted last month, they cited very valid reasons. For one example, Monmouth County picked up an illegal alien in January who we definitely didn\u2019t want back out on the streets. Check out the rap sheet on this guy. (USA Today)\n\nWhen a Guatemalan national was charged with aggravated assault with a handgun, terroristic threats and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose in January, a Monmouth County corrections officer ran the person\u2019s name in a federal database and discovered that the inmate had entered the United States on a visitor\u2019s visa and never left. A corrections officer placed an immigration hold on the inmate that flagged federal immigration authorities.\n\nIn addition to that guy, they arrested another illegal alien in March on charges of burglary, harassment and domestic violence. He\u2019d been arrested at the border with his mother three years earlier. He too was turned over to ICE and processed.\n\nIn other words, we\u2019re not talking about a program where the Sheriff\u2019s deputies are rounding up random illegal aliens at the local grocery store. These are dangerous criminals who are already in custody on serious charges. And the State Attorney General wants to forbid the Sheriffs from notifying or holding them for ICE.\n\nHis excuse for this, as explained in his statement last week, is that he is \u201ctaking another step forward here in New Jersey to build trust, to fight crime and to make this state safe for all of our residents.\u201d That quote about the state being \u201csafe for all of our residents\u201d is standard code in woke circles, meaning \u201csafe for illegal aliens.\u201d But is that guy from Guatemala with the gun charges and domestic violence rap really the person you\u2019re trying to keep the state safe for? Shouldn\u2019t you really be focusing more on keeping everyone else safe from him?\n\nThis suicidal behavior in the blue \u201csanctuary\u201d states should be driving residents to either start voting some new people into office or get to packing their stuff and moving. These policies may look good on the AG\u2019s resume when he\u2019s running in the primary for higher office, but he\u2019s not doing a thing to keep the legal citizens under his protection safe. Also, immigration law is precisely what it says\u2026 the law. Isn\u2019t an Attorney General supposed to be upholding all the laws by definition?", "description": "Hop onboard the unconstitutional bandwagon", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Grewal.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
