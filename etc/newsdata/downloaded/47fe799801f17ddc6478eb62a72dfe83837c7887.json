He said he's also been transporting water to UN operations on the island.\n\nLuc Lavall\u00e9e, in the white shirt, has been helping with relief efforts on Great Abaco Island. Here he's with a group of Canadian firefighters from Burnaby, B.C., who are assisting with the search and rescue efforts. Earlier this week, officials said 2,500 people were listed as missing. (Luc Lavall\u00e9e/Supplied)\n\nLavall\u00e9e said the devastation is the worst he's seen in two decades living on the islands. That includes losing his favourite restaurant, which has been reduced to rubble.\n\n\"It's only pegs that are left in the water,\" he said. \"It affects you. It's not supposed to be like that. A hurricane is not supposed to do that kind of damage.\"\n\nThe Canadian government has committed $500,000 in aid for humanitarian organizations including the Canadian Red Cross.\n\nGlobal Affairs Canada said 81 Canadians had been in contact to ask for consular support.\n\nCanada is also deploying a CC-130J Hercules aircraft to provide airlift support to the Jamaican Defence Force's disaster assistance response team.\n\nCanada's disaster assistance team has been sent to Nassau, the Bahamian capital.\n\n", "description": "An Ottawa man who has\u00a0made his home in the Bahamas for more than two decades is helping with relief efforts after avoiding the worst of Hurricane Dorian.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5282615.1568391193!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/luc-lavallee-damage-marsh-harbour.JPG", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
