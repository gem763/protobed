They have officially made a request to declare a state of emergency which would give them additional powers to access resources, supplies, materials that they need at various descriptions in order to restore power as quickly as possible,\" the premier said.\n\n\"We'll be proceeding to grant that request\u2026 to bring about the ability of Manitoba Hydro to proceed more rapidly.\"\n\nThe last time Manitoba declared a state of emergency was in 2014 due to a surge in floodwaters.\n\nThe province's co-ordinated emergency centre has escalated to Level 3 \u2014 a \"heightened level of concern,\" Pallister said.\n\n\"We have hydro towers that are leaning, we have wooden poles that have snapped, we have major work underway,\" he said.\n\nA fallen oak tree is seen in Winnipeg. (Submitted by Lane Gibson)\n\nManitoba Hydro is still putting in writing the specifics of their request, Pallister said. The intention of the declaration is to give the crown corporation time to do their repairs.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Colorado low-weather system moved into Manitoba from the United States. It has wreaked havoc by downing power lines and tree limbs across the province, from the southwest corner into the Red River Valley and northwest toward Berens River and into Saskatchewan.\n\n\"We've had very heavy and freezing rain, heavy snow and strong winds,\" Pallister said, adding that 50 to 70 millimetres of precipitation has draped trees filled with colourful leaves and already saturated soils.\n\nAn additional 20 to 25 millimetres is expected to fall in the south and central parts of province Saturday evening into Sunday.\n\nFlood risk increasing as water levels rise\n\nIn addition to huge swaths of power outages, rising waters levels also have the province on edge. Pallister said there are high water advisories in effect.\n\n\"Crews and equipment are staged in a number of high risk areas,\" he said, including the Red River Valley, Interlake region, southeastern Manitoba and the Whiteshell area.\n\nThe city of Winnipeg has already closed the floodgates and activated the Red River floodway on Wednesday to prevent flooding in the capital region.\n\nWater levels upstream will rise as a result of floodway operations but they are 'expected to remain within the banks,' says Pallister. (Trevor Brine/CBC)\n\nPumping operations are already underway in Emerson, Morris, Dominion City and some other communities.\n\nSeveral areas have experienced overland flooding and road washouts due to high levels of precipitation.\n\nTwo government departments \u2014 Manitoba Infrastructure and Sustainable Development \u2014 will continue to monitor the situation.\n\nMore winter storm stories from CBC Manitoba:", "description": "Premier Brian Pallister will declare a state of emergency for the first time in more than five years\u00a0after receiving a request from Manitoba Hydro, as\u00a0a major snowstorm creates havoc across\u00a0the southern portion of the province.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5319726.1570925003!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/winter-storm-pallister.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
