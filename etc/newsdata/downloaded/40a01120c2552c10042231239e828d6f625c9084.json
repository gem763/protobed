(Photo by ALFREDO ESTRELLA / AFP)\n\nMexico City - Championship challenger Valtteri Bottas admitted he \"had to risk it\" when he buried his Mercedes into a trackside wall in a frantic conclusion to qualifying at the Mexican Grand Prix on Saturday.\n\n\"I knew that I had to risk it in the last run to gain positions, so I tried to squeeze everything out of the car,\" said Bottas who is the only driver who can deny teammate Lewis Hamilton from securing a sixth world title.\n\n\"The lap was good until the last corner where I went a bit wide on the exit on the dusty part of the track and that's where I lost it and hit the wall.\n\n\"I'm all okay, but I've unfortunately given the boys in the garage some extra work to do tonight. Hopefully we can avoid taking any penalties for tomorrow. It's annoying because looking at the times, I think I had a chance at qualifying third.\"\n\nBottas was checked out at the circuit medical centre after the crash with his team going on to post on Twitter: \"He's OK! Valtteri Bottas has returned to the paddock. Great news.\"\n\nBottas qualified in sixth, two places behind Hamilton for Sunday's race, but could be hit by car problems following his crash at the high-speed Peraltada curve.\n\n\"Thankfully he's ok,\" said Mercedes team chief Toto Wolff. \"But unfortunately his car took a bit of a beating.\n\n\"We're assessing the damage at the moment and hope that we don't have to change any parts that would result in a grid penalty. Lewis will start from P4 which is not ideal, but tomorrow will be all about tyre life, so this might create some opportunity for us.\"\n\nHamilton needs to outscore Bottas by 14 points to seal his sixth title success.", "description": "Championship challenger Valtteri Bottas admitted he \"had to risk it\" when he buried his Mercedes into a trackside wall in a frantic conclusion to qualifying at the Mexican Grand Prix on Saturday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7974/2f66f0545091469e8af33d71b9777b71.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
