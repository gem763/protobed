Disgusting and foul mouthed Omarosa is one. I gave her every break, despite the fact that she was despised by everyone, and she went for some cheap money from a book. Numerous others also!\" Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTrump's attack on his former White House adviser, Omarosa Manigault Newman, followed the firing of his personal assistant, Madeleine Westerhout, who was let go Thusday for revealing to reporters details of her relationship with Trump and his daughters.\n\nTrump also appeared to rebut a report by the New York Times stating that Westerhout did not sign a non-disclosure agreement.\n\n\"While Madeleine Westerhout has a fully enforceable confidentiality agreement, she is a very good person and I don\u2019t think there would ever be reason to use it.

Any agreement is therefore not easily enforceable.\n\nOmarosa claimed she refused to sign \"that draconian NDA\" during her tenure at the White House following the release of a tell-all book, although she stated she signed two non-disclosure agreements during Trump's presidential campaign and her time on \"The Apprentice\u201d in 2003.\n\nFollowing her acrimonious firing, Omarosa also released audio of conversations recorded at the White House.", "description": "Trump's 2016 campaign team, transition team and political appointees are typically expected to sign a non-disclosure agreement.", "authors": ["Christian Vasquez"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/79/34/ef3ad849477eb81546469990a395/19831-donald-trum-gty-773.jpg"}
