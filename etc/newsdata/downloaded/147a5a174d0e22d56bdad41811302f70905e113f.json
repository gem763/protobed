She was seen slamming colleagues mocking the Labour leader.\n\n\"It is for Grenfell,\" the clearly incandescent former Prime Minister told chuntering backbenchers, as Mr Corbyn suggested they were \"jealous\".\n\nIt came before Mr Johnson led tributes to the victims of the fire at the start of a debate into the report.\n\nMrs May's comment was not caught on video, but was witnessed by Mirror and other reporters. It was not clear exactly who was saying what, but several MPs were seen laughing on the Tory benches.\n\nLater on in the session, Tory Huw Merriman praised Speaker John Bercow for wearing an Arsenal tie and asked Jeremy Corbyn, also a Gunners fan, why he wasn't wearing his ahead of the team's clash with Liverpool tonight.\n\nMr Merriman said: \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to see you in your Arsenal tie\u2026 I\u2019m sorry the Leader of the Opposition has not worn his own.\u201d\n\n\"It is for Grenfell,\" MPs shouted loudly back at Mr Merriman.\n\nLabour's Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner tweeted: \" #Tory backbenchers jeering Jeremy Corbyn for the colour of his Green tie!\n\n\"It\u2019s about respect for Grenfell. Shocking lack of awareness from some Tory MPs! # PMQs \"\n\nA Labour spokeswoman confirmed the tie was chosen in honour of Grenfell survivors. MPs later stood for a minute's silence in honour of the victims, with harrowing tributes including from Boris Johnson.\n\nOpening the Grenfell debate following PMQs, Mr Johnson said: \"The bereaved, the survivors and the members of the North Kensington community joining us in the galleries today, each has their own story to tell, their perspective on what happened at Grenfell.\n\n\"But over the past two-and-a-half years they have been united in their fight to uncover the truth. It is not a fight they would ever have chosen. But it is one that they have taken up with determination, with dedication and with great dignity.\n\n\"Yet their exceptional tenacity in seeking justice has not always been matched by their faith in the system's ability to deliver. This is no surprise. After all, they have been let down many times before.\n\n\"Too often overlooked and ignored in the months and years before the tragedy and shamefully failed by the institutions that were supposed to serve them in the days and weeks after it.\"\n\nIt comes after survivors of the fire welcomed a damning report that said London Fire Brigade (LFB) breached national guidelines through \"gravely inadequate\" preparation.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nSir Martin Moore-Bick said the absence of a plan to evacuate the tower was a \"major omission\" by the LFB and more lives could have been saved had the \"stay-put\" policy been abandoned sooner.\n\nThere was also an absence of training to help incident commanders recognise when this might be necessary, the inquiry judge said.\n\nBereaved family members said it was \"heartbreaking\" that more of their loved ones could have been saved, but some organisations questioned inquiry chairman Sir Martin's assertion that evacuation would have been possible.\n\nSome of his 46 recommendations require \"urgent action\" from the Government and others with responsibility for the \"oversight and direction\" of the emergency services, he said in a letter to the Prime Minister.\n\n(Image: Peter Summers)\n\nMPs debated the findings of the report after PMQs, with Boris Johnson saying London awoke that day to an \"ugly scar of black smoke\" and \"scene of horror and desperation\".\n\n\"What happened that night was anything but normal,\" the Prime Minister said.\n\nParty leaders including the Prime Minister work the bright green heart badge which is also part of the campaign to never forget the victims of the fire.", "description": "As families of those who died looked on from the public galleries some Tory MPs decided to mock the bright green tie", "authors": ["Oliver Milne", "Image", "Pa", "Peter Summers"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20756884.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Screen-Shot-2019-10-30-at-123548.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
