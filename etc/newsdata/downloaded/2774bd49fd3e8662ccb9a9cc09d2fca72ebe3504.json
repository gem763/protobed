Ted Cruz. | Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images elections Cruz: 'I hope to run again' for president\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, the runner-up to Donald Trump in the bruising 2016 Republican presidential primary, revealed Thursday that he wants to someday mount another White House campaign.\n\n\u201cLook, I hope to run again,\u201d the Texas lawmaker told The Christian Science Monitor . \u201cWe came very, very close in 2016. And it\u2019s the most fun I\u2019ve ever had in my life.\"\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCruz sparred viciously with Trump during the GOP\u2019s nominating contest. Trump memorably threatened and shared online an unflattering photo of Cruz\u2019s wife, and promulgated an unfounded conspiracy theory linking Cruz\u2019s father to President John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination.\n\nCruz achieved the second-most delegates at the party\u2019s July 2016 convention in Cleveland, where a contingent of his supporters attempted to derail Trump\u2019s nomination and disrupted the proceedings. Cruz also declined to endorse Trump in a prime-time address, instead imploring Republicans to \u201cvote your conscience.\u201d The speech was met with a chorus of boos from the convention floor.\n\nBut Cruz two months later announced he would be voting for Trump in the general election against Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and has emerged in the three years since as a staunch conservative ally of the president's in Congress.\n\nCruz won reelection to the Senate in 2018, vanquishing former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke in a race that garnered significant national attention and vaulted O\u2019Rourke into the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.\n\nCruz\u2019s relatively narrow victory exacerbated fears among Republicans that the state could transform into a potential battleground in the upcoming election cycle, both in the presidential competition and in GOP Sen. John Cornyn's bid for reelection to a fourth term.\n\n\u201cTexas is going to be hotly contested in 2020,\u201d Cruz said on Thursday. \u201cI believe the president will win Texas. I think it will be closer than last time.\u201d\n\nThis article tagged under: Elections\n\nTed Cruz", "description": "He said the 2016 campaign was \"the most fun I've ever had in my life.\"", "authors": ["Quint Forgey"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/47/6e/12f54c6240feab2c948c12d8a096/190913-ted-cruz-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
