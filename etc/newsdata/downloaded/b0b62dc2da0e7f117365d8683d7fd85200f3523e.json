They don\u2019t plan to use that as an excuse.", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nTrey Quinn, with three career NFL games, is the second-most experienced wide receiver on the Redskins' roster. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nPaul Richardson Jr., who occupies the first seat inside the Washington Redskins\u2019 locker room, looked to his right at a row of his fellow wide receivers. Cam Sims sat with a towel over his head as Kelvin Harmon dressed quietly in the background. Trey Quinn and Terry McLaurin both popped in and out.\n\n\u201cYeah, these guys are hungry. Look at them,\u201d Richardson said, scanning the adjacent lockers. \u201cThey look like they\u2019re starving right now. \u2026 That\u2019s why they\u2019re here, though. \u2026 When guys aren\u2019t on the field when they want to be on the field, they\u2019re supposed \u2026 to be bothered. And at the same time, they\u2019ve got to encourage the guys that are out there, too. That\u2019s part of the game. [When] guys are hungry, their heads [are] in the right place. I like it.\u201d\n\n[Landon Collins has always acted older than his age. At 25, he\u2019s a leader for the Redskins.]\n\nRichardson was the newest addition to the Redskins\u2019 receiving corps when he signed as a free agent in the spring of 2018, but just one year later, he is his position\u2019s elder statesman. The organization made the decision to go young at wide receiver, and Richardson is Washington\u2019s only wideout with more than two years of experience.\n\nQuinn will start in the slot after being the last pick of the 2018 draft and playing just three games as a rookie \u2014 game experience that now counts as second most among the wide receivers group. Third-round rookie McLaurin will start on the outside in place of released former first-round pick Josh Doctson, while fellow first-year players Harmon and Steven Sims Jr. will have roles. Robert Davis was a sixth-round pick in 2017 but has yet to be on a roster for the majority of a season and has played only one game. Cam Sims was a training camp standout, but will start the season on the practice squad.\n\nThe topic of the team\u2019s youth at the position has already gotten old to this group.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not much to say about it,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cWe\u2019re young, we\u2019re inexperienced, but who gives a [expletive]. It\u2019s football. \u2026 We\u2019re just competitive. We\u2019re talented. The only thing we don\u2019t have is experience and, like I said, who gives a [expletive] about that anyway. \u2026 We all make plays.\u201d\n\n[Redskins tight end Jordan Reed is getting closer to playing on Sunday versus Eagles]\n\nQuinn, in particular, feels the need to prove himself as the top slot receiver on the team. The organization was comfortable enough with the shifty route-runner with sure hands that it allowed Jamison Crowder to depart in free agency and not sign or draft a player to replace him. That decision was questioned, which annoyed Quinn, but he says he will hold his tongue to avoid saying something he shouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cI want to be really freaking explicit about it, but I\u2019m just ready to go,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cProve everybody wrong. I know it\u2019s cliche to say, but I really don\u2019t feel like saying what\u2019s on my mind right now.\u201d\n\nCoach Jay Gruden said he has no concerns about the relative inexperience of the team\u2019s receiving corps, adding that the team\u2019s goal of spreading targets around should allow the youngsters a chance to slowly get acclimated without having to shoulder a heavy load immediately. At the same time, there will be no easing into the season, with four playoff teams from last season on the Redskins\u2019 schedule over the first five weeks.\n\nThe Redskins\u2019 pass catchers will have one advantage in Week 1. Their opponent, the Philadelphia Eagles, won\u2019t be familiar with them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard thing because there isn\u2019t a lot of tape,\u201d Eagles Coach Doug Pederson said. \u201cWe just have to focus on our preparation. We\u2019ve got to go back and look at previous games. Obviously, you can look at the preseason, and that might give you a little indication.\u201d\n\nThe look on receivers coach Ike Hilliard\u2019s face gave an indication that Quinn isn\u2019t the only person in the team\u2019s wide receivers room feeling slighted. Hilliard has stressed a laserlike focus on details throughout training camp, both in film study and in practice, and the maturity of the young wideouts has helped with that.\n\nStill, it\u2019s a group that hasn\u2019t proved itself, and Washington hasn\u2019t had a receiving corps capable of truly threatening defenses since DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon were putting up big numbers.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, they need to step up to the front of the class and it\u2019s time to get their jobs done,\u201d Hilliard said. \u201cWe have more than enough talent. \u2026 With what we have in that room, we\u2019ll be effective and we expect them to play well.\u201d\n\nMore Redskins coverage:\n\nDaniel Snyder dreamed of owning the Redskins. Two decades in, success remains elusive.\n\nThis Redskins season is a referendum on Jay Gruden, and the only vote is sympathy\n\nJay Gruden says Redskins\u2019 offense will run through Derrius Guice", "description": "Trey Quinn, with three career NFL games, is the second-most experienced receiver on Washington's roster.", "authors": ["Kareem Copeland", "Reporter Covering The Washington Redskins", "Kareem Copeland Is The Post'S Washington Redskins Beat Writer.
