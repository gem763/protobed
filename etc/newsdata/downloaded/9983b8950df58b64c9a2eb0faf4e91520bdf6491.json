Air New Zealand shares were marginally higher at NZ$2.85 on Friday.\n\n\"But in terms of someone to have a steady hand on the wheel for Air New Zealand going forward, I don't think they could do much better,\" Mr Williamson added.\n\nMr Foran, who boosted Walmart's sales by focusing on improving existing stores to keep costs and prices low, said he looked forward to building on Air New Zealand's competitive advantage in customer focus and care.\n\nThe airline is known overseas for its quirky safety videos and consistently ranks highly in global airline customer surveys.\n\nMr Foran will join Air New Zealand in the first quarter of next year, replacing Christopher Luxon who departed last month after seven years in the role. Mr Luxon, a former Unilever executive, had also joined the airline after a career in fast-moving consumer goods.\n\nDuring Mr Luxon's tenure, the carrier was recognised globally as an industry leader for its focus on innovation, environmental sustainability and diversity in hiring.\n\nHowever, it has more recently faced challenges from a higher fuel bill and weak travel demand, leading the national carrier to report a 31 per cent fall in annual profit in August.\n\nAir New Zealand chief revenue officer Cam Wallace, who had been an internal contender for the top job, according to sources with knowledge of the matter, welcomed the appointment on Twitter.\n\nMr Foran will remain at Walmart until Jan 31, when he will be replaced by the head of its Sam's Club warehouse chain, John Furner.\n\n\"While we've been highly impressed with Mr Furner's work at Sam's Club... he does admittedly have big shoes to fill,\" said a note from Jefferies Group LLC. \"We can't help but expect the market to react negatively to today's news.\"\n\nREUTERS", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Transport - [BENGALURU] Air New Zealand named Walmart US boss Greg Foran as its new chief executive on Friday, bringing him back home at a time the airline is trying to control costs in a lower-growth environment. .
