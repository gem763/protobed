The SDF, meanwhile, put the number of its own forces killed at 45.\n\nAl Jazeera's Zeina Khodr, reporting from Akcakale on the Turkey-Syria border, said a \"new map\" was emerging in northeastern Syria given the gains made by Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebel forces.\n\n\"They are now in control of a 120 kilometre stretch of territory along the border,\" Khodr said.\n\n\"There are pockets of resistance here and there ... but Turkish-led forces have also pushed some 30-35km deep inside Syria reaching the strategic M4 highway - that critical supply line that all players in this conflict want to control,\" she added.\n\nThe M4 is the main highway running between Hassakeh and Ain Issa, the administrative centre of the Kurdish-held areas in northeastern Syria.", "description": "Reports of breakout from facility in Ain Issa amid ongoing Turkish offensive and US announcement of troop pull-out.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/13/6aa44fee086e4359bc93f5289a630352_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
