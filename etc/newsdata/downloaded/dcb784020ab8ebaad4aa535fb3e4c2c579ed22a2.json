Those tweets were only noticed after Calvin wrote a story about Carson King for the Register in which he described a couple of racist tweets King had written eight years ago when he was sixteen. Now Buzzfeed has a new story up in which Calvin defends his reporting, retracts his apology, and blames what happened on \u201cright-wing ideologues.\u201d\n\nUpon publishing the story, Calvin said he was immediately met with criticism from people across Iowa who accused him of trying to denigrate a local hero. But any media ethics debate about the newsworthiness of tweets written by someone when they were a teenager was soon swept aside by a tidal wave of harassment, doxing, and death threats Calvin received.\n\nI\u2019m just going to stop there for a moment because that line in the last paragraph is such garbage. The question about whether or not tweets someone wrote at 16 belonged in a story about their generous philanthropy was the only issue. It was not swept away. And the fact that Calvin was harassed and threatened, which is obviously wrong, is not a reason to ignore all of the many people who didn\u2019t make threats but nevertheless thought he and the Register had published the \u201cnews\u201d about the tweets as clickbait. Buzzfeed\u2019s effort to brush aside the only reason this person is even a story is pathetic.\n\nSoon, influential right-wing media figures also began circulating screenshots of Calvin\u2019s own past offensive tweets that had been uncovered. In posts dating back to 2010, Calvin had used \u201cgay\u201d as a pejorative, written \u201cfuck all cops,\u201d and spelled out the word \u201cniggas\u201d twice when he was quoting others, including a Kanye West lyric. \u201cNow that gay marriage is legal,\u201d he wrote in one 2012 tweet, \u201cI\u2019m totally going to marry a horse.\u201d Calvin told BuzzFeed News these were \u201cfrankly embarrassing\u201d tweets that he \u201cwould not have published today,\u201d but said they had been \u201ctaken out of context\u201d and were being used to \u201cwield disingenuous arguments against me.\u201d\n\nYes, it\u2019s really terrible that people would circulate old tweets you wrote when you were 18 or 19 years old. But again, no one cared about Aaron Calvin\u2019s old tweets until he cared about Carson King\u2019s old tweets. How can Calvin complain about being held to the same standard?\n\nIt briefly seemed as if Calvin did get it. He published a tweet apologizing for \u201cnot holding myself to the same high standards as The Register holds others.\u201d But now he tells Buzzfeed, \u201cI regret publishing that tweet now. Because I was never trying to hold Carson to any kind of \u2018higher standard\u2019 or any kind of standard at all. I was trying to do my job as a reporter, and I think I did so to the best of my ability.\u201d\n\nStandards? We don\u2019t need no stinking standards! But back to the wrong done to Aaron Calvin:\n\n\u201cI recognize that I\u2019m not the first person to be doxed like this \u2014 this whole campaign was taken up by right-wing ideologues and largely driven by that force,\u201d he said.\n\nDespite defending his inclusion of the subject of Carson King\u2019s tweets, Calvin tells Buzzfeed he doesn\u2019t support judging people based on old tweets: \u201cAs I said when I was speaking with Carson, I don\u2019t think people\u2019s past social media statements should be made to make blanket characterizations about them.\u201d\n\nI actually agree with this. What I don\u2019t understand is how you can say this and, at the same time, think your job is to introduce this material into a profile of someone knowing what will happen when you do.\n\nAs to what drove this, it wasn\u2019t the right-wing that fired Calvin, it was the Register. He wasn\u2019t fired for what he wrote about Carson King but for what he tweeted. The right-wing didn\u2019t make him tweet about hating cops, etc. Again, I don\u2019t like the idea of anyone being fired or shamed over old, unrelated, out-of-context tweets, but by his own actions, Aaron Calvin is not in a good position to make that case those tweets shouldn\u2019t count.\n\nOn a more positive note, Carson King has now raised $2 million for University of Iowa Stead Family Children\u2019s Hospital.
