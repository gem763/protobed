The controversy is also likely being watched closely by other US companies that do business with China and have to balance that country's laws with US ideals.\n\nHere's how the NBA's crisis unfolded.\n\nFriday, Oct. 4: The tweet heard round the world\n\nMorey set off a firestorm in China last Friday when he posted an image on Twitter that read, \"Fight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong.\" The tweet has since been deleted.\n\nHours later, Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta, responded:\n\nListen....@dmorey does NOT speak for the @HoustonRockets. Our presence in Tokyo is all about the promotion of the @NBA internationally and we are NOT a political organization. @espn https://t.co/yNyQFtwTTi \u2014 Tilman Fertitta (@TilmanJFertitta) October 5, 2019\n\nSunday, Oct. 6: The reaction in China\n\nThe Chinese Basketball Association said on Sunday that it would suspend all cooperation with the team. China's consulate general in Houston also urged the team to \"clarify and immediately correct the mistakes.\"\n\nCCTV 5, the sports channel of China's top state broadcaster, announced that it would suspend airing Houston Rockets events on television. Last season, more than 600 million people watched NBA games on Chinese television networks.\n\nTencent TCEHY AndSports said it would suspend live streaming the games, as well as reporting news about the team. Nearly 500 million people in China watched NBA programming on Tencent platforms during the last season, according to the companies.\n\nJUST WATCHED Backlash from China after NBA manager's Hong Kong tweet Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Backlash from China after NBA manager's Hong Kong tweet 02:40\n\nMonday, Oct. 7: NBA's initial response sparks outrage\n\nThe NBA said that it recognizes that Morey's views \"have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\"\n\n\"While Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them,\" NBA said in a statement, adding: \"We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together.\"\n\nThe response was been criticized by several US politicians \u2014 both Democrats and Republicans.\n\n\"It's clear that the NBA is more interested in money than human rights,\" said Senator Rick Scott, a Republican from Florida, on Twitter. \"The NBA is kowtowing to Beijing to protect their bottom line and disavowing those with the temerity to #standwithHongKong. Shameful!\"\n\nBeto O'Rourke, a Democrat from Texas who is running for the party's presidential nomination in 2020, called the NBA's response \"an embarrassment.\"\n\nMorey also responded on Twitter, saying he was speaking on his own behalf and not for the NBA:\n\n2/ I have always appreciated the significant support our Chinese fans and sponsors have provided and I would hope that those who are upset will know that offending or misunderstanding them was not my intention. My tweets are my own and in no way represent the Rockets or the NBA. \u2014 Daryl Morey (@dmorey) October 7, 2019\n\nAlibaba BABA Joe Tsai, the executive vice chairman of Chinese tech giantand owner of the Brooklyn Nets NBA franchise, sought to defuse the tensions.\n\n\"The NBA has been very progressive in allowing players and other constituents a platform to speak out on issues,\" Tsai wrote in a lengthy Facebook post . He then criticized supporters of Hong Kong's protests, calling them a \"separatist movement\" in a territory controlled by China.\n\n\"Chinese citizens stand united when it comes to the territorial integrity of China and the country's sovereignty over her homeland. This issue is non-negotiable,\" he said.\n\nTuesday, Oct. 8: The NBA responds again. Backlash grows\n\nIn an attempt at damage control, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver issued another statement Tuesday saying that he won't censor players or team owners over China or other issues, arguing that the league is motivated by much more than money, and freedom of expression must be protected.\n\n\"The NBA will not put itself in a position of regulating what players, employees and team owners say or will not say,\" Silver said in the statement. \"We simply could not operate that way.\"\n\nThe league's initial response was criticized by some fans and US politicians for appearing to compromise its principles, and condemned by others in China for offending national sensibilities.\n\n\"I do know there are consequences from freedom of speech; we will have to live with those consequences,\" Silver said. \"For those who question our motivation, this is about far more than growing our business,\" he added.\n\nJUST WATCHED NBA chief: Not going to apologize for Rockets GM's tweet Replay More Videos ...

The broadcaster is also reviewing its broader relationship with the NBA.\n\n\"We express our strong dissatisfaction and opposition to Silver's stated support of Morey's right to free speech.
