No, I don\u2019t want war with anybody but we\u2019re prepared more than anybody.\u201d\n\nAlthough the president withdrew the US from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal that had been signed by Barack Obama, he has said he believes Washington and Tehran could come to a fresh agreement. He has made repeated approaches to Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, and there was speculation the two could meet on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York this month, though that now appears off the table.\n\nIran has denied being behind the attack on the Saudi facilities, while Houthi rebels in Yemen have claimed responsibility, saying it was carried out in revenge for the Saudi-led military operation against them. That military operation has been backed by the US and UK among others, and resulted in thousands of civilian deaths and created a humanitarian catastrophe in one of the world\u2019s poorest nations.\n\nThe US has claimed the rebels could not have carried out the attacks, and US officials have briefed selected media outlets that it believed Iran was responsible.\n\nThe US also released images showing the attacked plant and claimed the strikes did not come from the direction of Yemen, but rather from Iran. It has also claimed the attack may have involved cruise missiles.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Houthi military spokesman Yahya Sarea said the group carried out Saturday\u2019s pre-dawn attack with drones, including some powered by jet engines.\n\n\u201cWe assure the Saudi regime that our long arm can reach any place we choose and at the time of our choosing,\u201d Mr Sarea tweeted. \u201cWe warn companies and foreigners against being near the plants that we struck because they are still in our sights.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Donald Trump has threatened Iran after accusing it of attacking oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, saying the US was \u201cbetter prepared\u201d than anyone in history if military action was needed.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/16/20/satellite-image-of-damage-to-saudi-arabia-oil-installation-Abqaig-Abqaiq.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
