Not only have the U.K, France, and Germany joined the United States in blaming Iran for the attacks, but they have also called for talks on a new, broader agreement that would go beyond the nuclear issue to address things like Iran\u2019s missile program. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has expressed hope for a new \u201cTrump deal.\u201d\n\nRead: Iran is acting like the international villain of Trump\u2019s prophecy\n\nBut shared frustration does not equal unified policy. French president Emmanuel Macron has tried to dangle economic incentives for Iran to re-embrace the nuclear deal, which would undermine the U.S. sanctions campaign. Macron also pushed for a Trump-Rouhani meeting at the United Nations, imploring Rouhani before a cluster of cameras as Boris Johnson stood beside him: \u201cIf you leave the country without meeting with President Trump, honestly, this is a lost opportunity. Because you will not come back in a few months \u2026 and President Trump will not go to Tehran.\u201d Rouhani just laughed; neither the U.S. nor Iran seems interested.\n\nIn remarks at the Asia Society on Monday, Hook devoted almost as much time to scolding the international community for failing to join the U.S. as he did excoriating Iran\u2019s malfeasance, citing \u201ca dangerous culture of inaction,\u201d despite the world\u2019s interest in protecting energy transit. \u201cNations look the other way, pretending to believe Foreign Minister [Javad] Zarif\u2019s version of reality,\u201d he said, noting how few nations directly accused Iran of attacking tankers in the Gulf of Oman over the summer. (He also said that the media likes to exaggerate disagreements between the Americans and the Europeans on Iran.)\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has opted for rhetoric by turns confrontational and conciliatory. He devoted a portion of his speech to the General Assembly to the Islamic Republic, declaring that \u201cnot only is Iran the world\u2019s number one state sponsor of terrorism, but Iran\u2019s leaders are fueling the tragic wars in both Syria and Yemen.\u201d He said even more sanctions would come.\n\nRead: Everyone is getting sucked into the Iran morass\n\nYet he also gestured at his continuing willingness to negotiate, saying that \u201cthe United States has never believed in permanent enemies. We want partners, not adversaries. America knows that while anyone can make war, only the most courageous can choose peace.\u201d\n\nThe remarks nearly echoed Barack Obama\u2019s overture in his inaugural address more than a decade ago: \u201cTo those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.\u201d", "description": "At the UN, America and Iran talk at each other and refuse to meet.", "authors": ["Kathy Gilsinan"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTX74L4X/facebook.jpg?1569441028", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
