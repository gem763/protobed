The national toy federation said it was committed to making \"quantifiable\" efforts towards improving gender neutrality in toys.\n\nToyshop staff will also be trained to ask what a child is interested in rather than \"is it for a boy or a girl?\".\n\nIn a tweet, Ms Pannier-Runacher said the element of imagination conveyed by toys mattered for children. and she highlighted three new Barbie toys.\n\n\"A little girl may want to be a doctor and not to dress up in a nurse's uniform,\" she told French radio. \"She might choose to be a knight riding into battle rather than a princess. Let's give them a far richer world that doesn't stigmatise them.\"\n\nShe complained that only one in 10 women went into computer coding, leaving men making up 90% of workers focusing on the algorithms of the future. Toy manufacturers would now focus on conveying messages like \"act like grown-ups\" instead of choosing either mum or dad, she said.\n\nFrench toy manufacturers said it was too early to revise their range ahead of Christmas but there would immediately be changes to shop displays as well as how staff treated boys and girls.\n\nMs Van Engelshoven did not go as far as calling on Dutch companies to scrap toys viewed as gender-stereotyping, but a spokesman told the BBC she wanted companies to think carefully about the situation.\n\nHowever, several politicians criticised her intervention. One MP said he was surprised she had such time for this sort of hobby as there was so much for her to do in education.
