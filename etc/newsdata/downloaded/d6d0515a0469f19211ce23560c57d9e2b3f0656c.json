It\u2019s the special frisson that drives players to train, fans to talk all week with their friends about, and coaches to stay awake at night plotting the one-percenters.\n\nExcept for Namibia vs New Zealand.\n\nThis is a result as sure as anything. A result preordained. Predicted by Nostradamus some 450 years ago. It\u2019s one of Donald Rumsfeld\u2019s \u201cknown knowns\u201d.\n\nBut this is largely beside the point. Within the battle that is a professional rugby match - especially one at a World Cup - are a thousand tiny battles. The first scrum. The first line out. The first driving maul. Contested high balls. Individual tackles. Metres carried.\n\nA handful of professional players will never beat the world\u2019s preeminent team - a unit galvanised by endemic success. Namibia are 0/21 at the World Cup, New Zealand are 30/30 in the group stage. And yet - the goal remains to win the little battles. Score a try. Force some turnovers. Any little victory may light a fire inside the heart of young Namibian players back home.\n\nFour years ago when these two sides met for the first time, it finished 58-14. The man who scored that day for Namibia, Johan Deysel, is now back as their captain. We\u2019ll find out shortly whether he can lift them to greater heights today.", "description": "Minute-by-minute report: Can the All Blacks tally the big points haul expected against one of the tournament\u2019s outsiders?
