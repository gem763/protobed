Take her to her favorite show, hold her hand, take her to a deep river, and other things we are ready and willing to do. Especially considering how hypnotizing her heterochromatic contact lenses and the rippling camera movements prove to be. The music video is directed both by Twigs and her frequent collaborator Nick Walker. The song, \u201cHoly Terrain,\u201d features Future and was produced by \u2014 wait for it \u2014 Skrillex and \u2014 wait one more time \u2014 Jack Antonoff, as well as Twigs herself. It\u2019s a collab that truly reaches all corners of music. \u201cHoly Terrain\u201d comes ahead of FKA Twigs\u2019s album \ufeffMagdalene. Prepare your altars for when it arrives on October 25.\n\nRelated", "description": "FKA Twigs hypnotizes in her music video for \u201cHoly Terrain,\u201d featuring Future.
