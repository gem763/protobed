His parents, Bushra and Salem (all above) 'just want a livable house so they can take care of their son properly'\n\nThe vanity in the south-western Sydney rental is both rusted and busted - with collapsed cupboard doors\n\nBleak: Walls in an outside bathroom are coated with black mould, which the family say is to blame for their respiratory issues since moving in\n\nMr Reahy's leg tumour is evident on right. Husain's parents say he is most calm when he is in the company of his mother, his full time carer, Bushra\n\nHusain's mother sticks her arm through where the kitchen drawers should be inside the derelict home\n\n'Rat hole': Bushra points towards a hole in the kitchen which the family claim rats enter through\n\nWhat was once a bathroom cabinet is instead a hole in the wall covered in the home's trademark black mould\n\nFamily matriarch Bushra is a full-time carer and mother of four, while Salem has health issues and is on Newstart. The couple have three other children.\n\nThe family have been in a long-running battle with housing authorities in their bid for a new home.\n\nThe house where they live is privately owned but is being rented out by Housing NSW on a 'head lease', which means the department covers some of the cost.\n\nAnd the family's verdict is scathing: 'The whole house is not suitable for living in any way you can think of,' Bushra said.\n\n'I have a dying child from cancer and my whole family is sick and severely depressed from our living situation, no one seems to care about us.'\n\nHealth issues are the family's biggest worry, especially respiratory problems from the mould.\n\nBoth Salem and their daughter have developed asthma while living at the property. Their youngest son's sinus problems have required surgery.\n\nMs Dare explained: '(Bushra) removed mould by hand, painted walls and ripped up old carpets all out of her own pocket to make the house more habitable.'\n\nBushra and Salem point towards more mould on the roof of their family kitchen in Sydney's greater west on Friday\n\nThe brickwork in the living room shows visible signs of water damage with gravel dripping down\n\nSalem Reahy and two of his kids have developed asthma since moving into the oppressively damp home - among other respiratory issues\n\nBushra and Salem inspect their bedroom - where there is visible damage to the roof and little light\n\nSalem points to the damp and mould in the living room of the home. It was only recently painted, and the damp is oppressive\n\nThe government has offered the family alternative places to live recently.\n\nBut the family said one property they got excited about is not yet available.\n\nOthers have been unsuitable for their son, who due to his condition, has the intellectual capacity of an 18-month-old.\n\nBecause of his cancer, Husain is currently doped up on heavy painkillers, as well as calming medication.\n\nHe rarely walks and needs to be wheel-chaired to the bathroom for a shower, something they can at least do at present.\n\nTragically, doctors have told Bushra their son could die at any moment and his bone cancer is inoperable\n\n'(It feels like) they're teasing us, they're playing with our feelings,' said Salem (right)\n\nThe Department of Communities and Justice (DCJ) recently took the family and the estate agent to the Civil and Administrative Tribunal to get access to the property for repairs.\n\nThe tribunal granted the order, but Bushra said: 'I want a transfer, I don't want a repair.'\n\nMs Dare said repairs would probably mean the family would have to stay at the home, something they do not want to do.\n\nMeanwhile, the Bushra and Salem's negotiations with housing officials keep running into the same problem. They say they rarely deal with the same person.\n\nIn a statement, a government spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia: 'The Department of Communities and Justice (DCJ) continues to work closely with the family on their application for transfer and to meet their needs.'\n\nMeanwhile, Salem, who fled Iraq for Australia after fighting Saddam Hussein in 1991's first Gulf War, said: '(It feels like) they're teasing us, they're playing with our feelings'.", "description": "The parents of an autistic boy dying from inoperable bone cancer have pleaded with public housing authorities to let them move from their derelict home.", "authors": ["Daniel Piotrowski For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/30/01/19089616-0-image-a-29_1569804642095.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
