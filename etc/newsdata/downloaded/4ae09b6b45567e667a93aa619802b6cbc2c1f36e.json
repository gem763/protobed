In 2011, thousands took to the streets in protests sparked by the suicide of a young man amid frustration of poverty, joblessness and corruption.\n\nThe death of Mohamed Bouazizi resonated with millions of people who hoped it would inspire change in Tunisia \u2013 particularly to the lives of young people. But unemployment levels are still high; nearly half of Tunisia\u2019s population are under 25, and more than 35% of them are unemployed.\n\nTunisia is also one of the few places in the world where a higher education level decreases employability \u2013 the employment rate for those with degrees is approximately 25%. Many of Tunisia\u2019s young people are educated, but they\u2019re unable to find jobs to match their field or skillset \u2013 the uprising eight years ago shows how serious the consequences can be.\n\n\u201cWith high levels of unemployment comes discontent. For the security of the country it\u2019s important that people are in employment or feel that there are opportunities in the region,\u201d says Petra Wenitzky, industrial development expert at the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (Unido).\n\nFor marginalised communities \u2013 especially those in regions outside of the capital Tunis \u2013 the issue is far more pronounced.\n\n\u201cThe frustration is there for the less privileged youth,\u201d says Steve Utterwulghe from the United Nations Development Programme. \u201cEconomic transition needs to follow democratic transition or go hand in hand. But there is a skills mismatch and a certain disconnect between what youth learn in school and the reality and requirements of the labour market,\u201d he says.\n\nWith few big companies based in the country, Tunisia is seeing a growing culture of entrepreneurialism, SMEs and startups \u2013 and it\u2019s these businesses that are now trying to help lift young people out of unemployment and poverty.\n\n\u201cWhereas for decades many educated youth turned to the public sector to fulfil their professional aspirations, the combination now of an overburdened administration and relatively low public wages render the role of the private sector crucial in creating jobs and lifting people out of poverty,\u201d says Diego Zorrilla, UN resident coordinator in Tunisia.\n\n\u201cThis fact is widely recognised and has spun the adoption by the government in 2018 of the national strategy for entrepreneurship and of the Startup Act. UN agencies in Tunisia, as with many other development partners, support the development by the government and civil society of programmes that aim to increase the employability of youth or enable the creation of small and medium enterprises.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest So far, the team at Think-it has connected 30 young Tunisians to tech jobs\n\nFounded in 2017, startup Think-it is one of the businesses tackling youth poverty and unemployment in the country.\n\nThink-it connects global tech companies with Tunisia\u2019s brightest young people as a way to address brain drain \u2013 since the Arab spring, approximately 100,000 young people have left the country. Graduates are trained using the newest technologies, such as AI and blockchain, to develop skills appropriate for Think-it\u2019s partner companies in Germany and the US \u2013 earning good wages without leaving their home country.\n\n\u201cIf you build a community that sticks together, it makes it easier to say I believe in this and I want to build a career while staying in Tunisia,\u201d says Joscha Raue, co-founder of Think-it.\n\n'With a better environment, we\u2019ll have a better crop': how Fargreen is closing the loop in Vietnam\u2019s rice production Read more\n\nThink-it has now connected 30 people to tech jobs, but it believes the impact goes beyond these individuals. \u201cThe big impact is bringing exposure. We\u2019re not telling people what to do with their lives, but showing what options they have,\u201d says co-founder Amel Abid.\n\nYoung people are increasingly taking it upon themselves to create their own job opportunities and Mashrou3i, a youth entrepreneurship programme based in Tunisia\u2019s regions, is helping develop this culture of entrepreneurialism. Launched in 2013 as a joint project from Unido, the US aid agency, Italian development agency and the HP Foundation, it aims to create at least 6,000 jobs by 2021. People taking part are offered business training and courses from how to create a bankable business plan or model to basic IT and entrepreneurship skills.\n\nSo far, Mashrou3i has helped create approximately 2,000 jobs and 251 startup businesses \u2013 40% of those led by women.\n\nFatma, from Makthar in the region of Siliana, launched her textile business in 2018. She now employs 19 people in a region where unemployment is high and poverty widespread. Fatma says: \u201cIn the summer when we were young, we had to find ways to entertain ourselves. This was when I discovered my interest in textiles. To pass the time, I learned how to sew and embroider. After finishing my studies, I decided to turn my hobby into a business.\u201d\n\nWenitzky, who works on the Mashrou3i programme, says: \u201cThe programme is able to encourage people to feel that they have the potential to be a change agent \u2013 and entrepreneurship is something they realise can help them take control of their lives.\u201d\n\nUtterwulghe adds that there\u2019s a drive among young Tunisians to find solutions for themselves and others. \u201cThey\u2019re very conscious about social difficulties Tunisians face. They want to find solutions for other young people and adults outside of Tunis \u2013 the most marginalised in the country \u2013 through social entrepreneurship and the environment to preventing sexual violence. It goes in every direction. The solution for youth is coming from youth.\u201d\n\nOne possible solution is Cogite, a Tunis-based co-working space that tries to open doors for young entrepreneurs. It provides mentors, access to training, finance and networks. Aside from supporting startup businesses, it has generated jobs itself by choosing some members to run other Cogite co-working spaces across the country.\n\n\u201cIf you have a great business model, support network, and access to finance you could go a long way,\u201d says Houeida Anouar, Cogite\u2019s CEO. \u201cAt Cogite, we try to help them build new skills. If you have a great idea but you don\u2019t know how to write a business plan, or don\u2019t know how to pitch a great idea, this is a problem. We facilitate all these aspects for people.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2013, Cogite was the first co-working space in the country. Now, there are over 40 in total across cities and in regional areas.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for Cogite was to be a place where people would have access to each other, where collaboration could happen, and a place where there is a lot of inspiration,\u201d she says. \u201cYoung entrepreneurs need to be connected with major players of the economy in Tunisia.\u201d\n\nSahba Sobhani, acting head of Business Call to Action, hopes there will be a domino effect. \u201cThis encouragement of entrepreneurship, the efforts to change the mindset of what kind of opportunities you can grab in Tunisia \u2013 the only way you can do that is seeing others doing it,\u201d he says.", "description": "In Tunisia, 35% of under 25s are unemployed despite being skilled.
