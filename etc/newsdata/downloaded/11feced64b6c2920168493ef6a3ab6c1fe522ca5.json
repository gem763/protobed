I\u2019m sure that\u2019s what they were saying to me back in Queens. You\u2019re a dandy, when they looked at me with scorn and gave me a hand gesture and called me a Wop.

Please do better in the future. #EqualityTownHall'.\n\nOne viewer wrote: 'As soon as she is introduced, @KamalaHarris immediately shares her pronouns. Then @ChrisCuomo promptly ruins the important moment. #EqualityTownHall'\n\nAnd another added: 'YUCK. @ChrisCuomo just made a joke that his pronouns are She/Her/Hers.

We completely support him.'\n\nBut according to Page Six, staff at CNN have called the incident 'embarrassing'.\n\nOne insider said: 'It was an unforced error, and he gave the right \u2014 and the president \u2014 ammunition to use against him and CNN.'\n\nTrump's re-election campaign pounced on the video scandal, and even introduced a t-shirt for sale that mocked the CNN anchor.\n\nThe t-shirt, available for $34.00, carries the words 'FREDO UNHINGED' and still images from the video.\n\nChris Cuomo (in the hat on the left) is filmed berating a man who referred to him as 'Fredo' in a bar on New York's Shelter Island in August", "description": "Just days after Chris Cuomo joked about using female pronouns at an LGBTQ town hall, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo dropped the n-word during a live radio interview on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Valerie Edwards For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/18/19751954-0-image-a-5_1571159446862.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
