'When we win the Democratic nomination and defeat Donald Trump, we will transform our political system by rejecting the influence of big corporate money.'\n\nBernie Sanders unveiled a sweeping plan on Monday to get 'money out of politics' by barring corporate donations to presidential inaugural committees and the Democratic National Convention\n\nSanders' proposal also calls for mandatory public financing for elections, the dissolution of the Federal Election Commission and a ban on advertising during presidential debates\n\nSanders had a heart attack a week ago but plans to participate in the next primary debate, on Tuesday, Oct. 15\n\nSanders made the pledge from Vermont, where he's been resting since Saturday. His campaign admitted Friday night, as he was released fro a Nevada hospital, that the 78-year-old senator suffered a heart attack earlier in the week.\n\nWhile he plans to participate in the next primary debate, on Tuesday, Oct. 15, in Ohio, the Democrat does not currently have any other campaign events on his schedule.\n\nHis campaign has stayed active in the interim, including the release of a plan Monday that would make good on the candidate's pledge to limit the influence of lobbyist and corporations on the federal government's operations, if he becomes the Democratic nominee next year for president, and give election monitors more power to enforce federal campaign finance laws.\n\nA statement denouncing 'greed-fueled, corrupt corporate influence over elections, national party convention [sic], and presidential inaugurations' took direct aim at companies like AT&T, Microsoft, and Chevron that donated to Barack Obama's feting in 2012.\n\nIn the statement, Sanders identified the Democratic National Committee as a serial offender of the practice he proposes to ban.\n\nHe noted that Bank of America, Pepco Energy, Comcast and Facebook donated more than $1 million to the 2016 convention, when he lost out on the nomination to Hillary Clinton.\n\n'Their lobbyists were everywhere and filled the VIP suites. This type of corporate sponsorship is a corrupting influence and must end if politicians are going to represent the American people,' his platform posits.\n\nSanders' Proposed Corporate Finance Ban Bernie Sanders says if he becomes the Democratic nominee for president in 2020 and is elected he'll make the following changes to campaign finance practices and regulations: Ban corporate contributions to the Democratic National Committee\n\nProhibit corporate donations to Democrats' nominating convention\n\nBar presidential inaugural committees from accepting corporate donations\n\nLimit individual contributions to inaugural committees to $500\n\nReplace the Federal Election Commission\n\nCreate a Federal Election Administration with more power\n\nIntroduce mandatory public financing for elections\n\nMandate a lifetime lobbying ban for DNC chairs and co-chairs\n\nApply lobbying ban to <embers of Congress and senior staffers\n\nEliminate advertising in presidential primary debates\n\nPass legislation ending Super PACs, 501c4s and other organizations that don't have to reveal political donors\n\nSanders said that if he's the nominee this time, he'll ban 'all corporate contributions to the Democratic Party Convention and all related committees.' He would extend that ban corporate donations for inaugural events and put an individual cap of $500 in place, should he be elected president, a release states.\n\nJoe Solmonese, CEO of the Democratic National Convention Committee, brushed it off. He suggested the national convention would be totally funded before Sanders hypothetically clinches the nomination.\n\n'Our focus is getting the Convention appropriately funded and paid for well in advance so that we can deliver a safe and successful Convention that puts our nominee in the best position to beat Donald Trump in 2020,' he said in a statement provided to DailyMail.com.\n\nAt present, Sanders in third among Democrats seeking the nomination. Competitor Elizabeth Warren has surpassed him in national polling, and she is now in a statistical tie for first place with former Vice President Joe Biden in the Real Clear Politics average.\n\nBiden and Warren are polling at an average of 26 percent percent each, while Sanders has been polling at 14 percent throughout the past two weeks. No other Democratic candidate has support in the double digits in national surveys.\n\n", "description": "Bernie Sanders unveiled a sweeping plan on Monday to get 'money out of politics' by barring corporate donations to presidential inaugural committees and the Democratic National Convention.", "authors": ["Francesca Chambers", "Senior White House Correspondent For Dailymail.Com In"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/16/19400654-0-image-a-2_1570461407823.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
