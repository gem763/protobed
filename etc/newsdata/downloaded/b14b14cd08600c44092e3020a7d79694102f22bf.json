(AP) - Joey Slye spent last season living in his parents\u2019 basement without a full-time job.\n\nThis year, he\u2019ll be kicking for the Carolina Panthers - and his late brother A.J.\n\nAn undrafted rookie in 2018, Slye was thrust into a prominent and potential game-determining role when the Panthers placed veteran kicker Graham Gano on injured reserve on Friday.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t supposed to happen like this.\n\nCoach Ron Rivera said the Panthers signed Slye \u201con a whim\u201d in early August when Gano experienced re-occurring pain in his plant leg during training camp. Slye was brought in as a short-term fill-in while Gano recovered.\n\nBut Gano never did.\n\nSlye took advantage of his opportunity making 7 of 8 field goals during the preseason, including all three attempts from beyond 50 yards. His only miss was a 48-yarder that was blocked due to a protection breakdown.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t what I was expecting coming in here,\u201d Slye said, knowing that Gano was an established kicker who\u2019d missed just three field goals for Carolina in the past two seasons.\n\nBut Slye quickly shied away from any praise.\n\nHe said all of that should be directed toward his brother A.J., a former Division III linebacker at Salisbury University who passed away in 2014 after a 14-month battle with acute myeloid leukemia, a rare form of blood cell cancer, at the age of 20.\n\nIt was a devastating blow for Joey, who viewed A.J. as his closest friend. They talked sports continuously and dreamed one day of playing together in the NFL.\n\nOn the field he honors his brother by raising six fingers to the sky after every made field goal and extra point. A.J. wore No. 6 when they played together at North Stafford High School in Virginia.\n\n\u201cIt gives me the understanding that he\u2019s still there,\u201d Slye said. \u201cI find comfort in that. I like to do it because I want a lot of my recognition to go to him. I don\u2019t need it. I don\u2019t want it. I want my brother to be known for how he fought, what he fought for and the type of person he was. I just want to continue his legacy forever.\u201d\n\nOff the field he helped start the SlyeStrong#6 Foundation , which is devoted to helping find a cure for adult/childhood cancer.\n\nSlye has some of his brother\u2019s fight in him.\n\nHe could have easily given up on his dream of playing in the NFL after being unable to land a job last year. But he wouldn\u2019t look for a full-time \u201cregular job\u201d because he refused to give up on his dream - and because he promised A.J. he would make it to the NFL.\n\nSo he kept on kicking.\n\n\u201cI put all of my eggs in one basket, basically,\u201d Slye said. \u201cI knew other (kickers) were working on their skills. For a lot of guys in the special teams realm it\u2019s about how long you are willing to keep fighting for that opportunity.\u201d\n\nSlye is known for having a big leg - he made a 59-yard field goal in the preseason with plenty of room to spare - but his accuracy has always been a concern. He made only 72.2 percent of his field-goal attempts at Virginia Tech.\n\nBut he\u2019s been accurate in games and practice since his arrival in Carolina.\n\nRivera said Slye is a true \u201cfeel good story,\u201d but said it\u2019s now time to see if he can produce amid the pressure of kicking in regular-season games, something Slye has never done before.\n\n\u201cWith everything he has gone through, he has weathered the storm,\u201d Rivera said. \u201cHe\u2019s shown us every reason to be confident in him. But we\u2019ll see. That\u2019s why you play on Sunday.\u201d\n\nNOTES: Cam Newton took all of his reps at practice Monday and remains on target to start Sunday\u2019s season opener against the Rams. \u2026 Greg Olsen did not practice but Rivera said \u201che\u2019s fine\u201d and that the veteran tight was \u201ctaking care of something.\u201d \u2026 Outside linebacker Bruce Irvin (hamstring) and backup offensive tackle Greg Little (concussion) did not practice.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: www.apnews.com/NFL and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Joey Slye spent last season living in his parents' basement without a full-time job.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Steve Reed"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/02/panthers_underdog_kicker_football_03483_c0-274-4596-2953_s1770x1032.jpg?f2c1cc4ba8addabe2d3ab3f298954a072d8a171b"}
