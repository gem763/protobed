Mr Bercow is the latest of several alternatives to be considered by he is so hated by Brexiteers he is very much an outside bet.\n\nHousing Secretary Robert Jenrick this morning said that the PM would 'absolutely' comply with the law, but refused to confirm or deny that he would sign the letter asking for an extension\n\nIn another snub to the Queen Mr Johnson is also said to have avoided apologising to her over the advice he gave her in order to prorogue Parliament last month.\n\nAfter the advice was deemed unlawful by the Supreme Court he expressed 'regret' to the monarch.\n\nIt came as the PM warned of plans to 'sabotage' the European Union by vetoing the bloc's seven-year budget if a deal is not reached by October 31.\n\nBritain will leave the EU in 25 days without a deal unless senior figures agree to compromise. In the case of a delay Mr Johnson will 'paralyse' the EU, senior aides revealed.\n\nIf Brexit is pushed back after October 31 the leader of the Brexit Party, Nigel Farage, could be drafted in as the British Commissioner in Brussels to 'disrupt' meetings, reports claim.\n\nSpeaker John Bercow has been suggested as a replacement prime minister in a so-called government of national unity (GNU) if Mr Johnson is toppled\n\nTwo cabinet ministers told the Sunday Telegraph they were among others backing the more 'aggressive' approach to Brussels.\n\nIt comes after the EU said Mr Johnson's proposals for an exit agreement, which include an plan for customs check on the Northern Irish border, did not 'provide a basis for concluding an agreement'.\n\nBut the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier poured scorn on the chances of the new proposal succeeding, reportedly telling an event in Paris: 'If they do not change, I do not believe, on the basis of the mandate I have been given by the EU27, that we can advance.'\n\nIn comments reported by The Observer, he also reiterated the EU's claim that a no-deal outcome would 'never be Europe's choice... it would always be the UK's choice, not ours'.", "description": "The Prime Minister is said to be prepared to 'squat' in Downing Street and dare the monarch to fire him if MPs topple him in a confidence vote and seek to delay the UK's exit from the EU.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/08/19354540-0-image-a-2_1570346962086.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
