Mandatory credit Kyodo/via REUTERS\n\nThe resignation of Saikawa, a protege of former chairman Carlos Ghosn, would mark the latest upheaval over governance at the troubled Japanese automaker. The company has struggled to right itself following Ghosn\u2019s dramatic arrest and subsequent ouster last year.\n\nIt was swept up again in crisis when Saikawa last week admitted to being improperly overpaid and in violation of internal procedures. That admission followed an internal investigation.\n\nNissan\u2019s board is scheduled to meet on Monday. The company, and its relationship with top shareholder Renault SA (RENA.PA), has been damaged following Ghosn\u2019s arrest for alleged financial misconduct in November and subsequent departure.\n\n\u201cThe nominating committee will also meet today and discuss the selection of successor and the timing of the resignation,\u201d the source said, requesting anonymity because the information has not been made public.\n\n\u201cSaikawa isn\u2019t at all clinging to his president\u2019s chair.\u201d\n\nThe timing of Saikawa\u2019s resignation was not immediately clear. He has told some executives of his intention to resign, the source said.\n\nThe chief executive earlier told reporters that he wanted to \u201cpass the baton\u201d to the next generation as soon as possible, the Nikkei newspaper reported.\n\nNissan was not immediately available to comment.\n\nPressure has mounted on Saikawa given the company\u2019s poor performance and strained ties with Renault. Profit has tumbled to an 11-year low and prompted hefty job cuts.\n\nAn alliance source told Reuters that a nominations committee established in June to find a successor to Saikawa had drawn up a shortlist containing more than 10 possible candidates.\n\nNames included Jun Seki, who is overseeing the company\u2019s performance recovery, Chief Competitive Officer Yasuhiro Yamauchi, and Makoto Uchida, chairman of Nissan\u2019s management committee in China, one of its largest markets, said the alliance source, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe search and vetting process would likely take about six months as the committee considered both Japanese and non-Japanese candidates for the role, a third person with knowledge of the issue has previously told Reuters.", "description": "Nissan Motor Co's <7201.T> nominating committee will discuss potential successors for Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa at a meeting on Monday, after he privately signaled his readiness to resign, a source with knowledge of the matter said.", "authors": ["Maki Shiraki", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190909&t=2&i=1427782798&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8803G", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
