REUTERS/Piroschka van de Wouw\n\nTurnout at the march in The Hague exceeded expectations with organisers estimating the crowd at about 35,000. Police were forced to reroute the march to a location with more space.\n\nThunberg, 16, gave an impassioned address at the United Nations in New York this week, after millions of people worldwide joined a climate strike protest last Friday in the run-up to a U.N. climate summit.\n\n\u201cThis strike is going to have a lot of effect when people keep showing up, not just today but also in the future and we see different kinds of people from all walks of life,\u201d said protester Reinder Rustema.\n\nBanging drums and holding pictures of Thunberg, protesters walked through the city centre with placards reading: \u201cFor the Greta good\u201d, \u201cDon\u2019t be a fossil fool,\u201d and \u201cYou will die of old age, we will die of climate change.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand their concerns, I believe they are being heard,\u201d Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte told journalists at a weekly press briefing within earshot of the protests. \u201cWe have presented very ambitious plans to deal with these problems. But we have to do it in a smart way, which also creates jobs.\u201d\n\nThunberg\u2019s brief address electrified the start of the summit aimed at mobilising government and business to break international paralysis over carbon emissions, which hit record highs last year despite decades of warnings from scientists.\n\n\u201cThis is all wrong. I shouldn\u2019t be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you?\u201d she said, her voice quavering with emotion.\n\nThe Netherlands, with 17 million inhabitants, generated less than 7 percent of all energy from sustainable sources in 2017, compared to 15 percent in Germany and over half of all energy in Sweden.\n\nThe government has pledged to halve CO2 emissions from 1990 levels by 2030, but by 2017 had only achieved a 13 percent cut.\n\nThunberg was taking part in a protest in Canada on Friday where U.N. aviation leaders were gathering in Montreal to discuss plane emissions targets.", "description": "Thousands of Dutch children skipped school to join a global climate strike on Friday, blocking traffic and asking their leaders \"how dare you?\" in a reference to Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg's speech at the United Nations.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434592652&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q1BO", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
