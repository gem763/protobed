Case Keenum should have been made to finish that football game.\u201d\n\nGruden said he turned to Haskins in hopes the first-rounder would provide a spark. The Redskins were down 14-0 and Keenum was ineffective for the second straight week.\n\nRiddick, who has worked for the Redskins and Philadelphia Eagles, said Gruden\u2019s decision \u201creeks of an agenda.\u201d He cited a pre-draft report from ESPN that stated there was tension between the coaching staff and the front office over Haskins\u2018 possible selection.\n\n\u201cYou think Dwayne Haskins doesn\u2019t hear that?\u201d Riddick said. \u201cYou think he feels totally supported in this entire process? \u2026 That young man right now is being set up for failure. And Dan Snyder needs to recognize that and say, \u2018Hey look, you just drafted another franchise quarterback and he\u2019s being set up to fail.\u2019 He should have never went in that football game [Sunday].\u201d\n\nGruden has not said if Haskins will start Sunday against the New England Patriots.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
