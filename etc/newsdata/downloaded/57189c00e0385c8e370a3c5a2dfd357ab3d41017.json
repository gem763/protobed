He has made an appalling hash of things. His Syrian misadventure, while unusually calamitous, is but the latest in a long line of foreign blunders. Erdo\u011fan abuses his position. He harms his country. He is still in office not because he is popular but because of the fear he instils and the power he crudely wields. It\u2019s time for him to go.\n\nGetting rid of Erdo\u011fan is a matter for the Turks. And it wouldn\u2019t be quite as difficult as it might sound\n\nHaving said that, doing the decent thing is not Erdo\u011fan\u2019s strong suit. His 16 years in power \u2013 as prime minister and then president \u2013 have been marked, at home, by growing authoritarianism and repression. The economy is an indebted mess. Corruption and nepotism thrive. After a 2016 military-led coup failed, Erdo\u011fan exploited it to purge political opponents, the judiciary, civil society and the media. Tens of thousands of supposed plotters were jailed.\n\nErdo\u011fan\u2019s creation of an executive presidency, concentrating power in his hands, was narrowly agreed in a 2017 referendum, and is proving a disaster for Turkish democracy. Effective checks and balances circumscribing his actions are lacking. Absent, too, are experienced figures, such as former prime minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu and ex-deputy prime minister Ali Babacan, who might have reined him in. Alienated by his domineering behaviour, they have wisely jumped ship.\n\nTurkey\u2019s ill-considered Syrian invasion is a byproduct of Erdo\u011fan\u2019s dictatorial behaviour. Like Donald Trump, he trusted his gut, not seasoned advisers. Now Syrians, mostly Kurds, are paying the price. All western leaders share some blame here. They have long known Erdo\u011fan for what he is \u2013 yet for reasons of realpolitik, they looked the other way.\n\nThese leaders must now be wishing Erdo\u011fan gone. He has made Trump look like a gullible idiot \u2013 though, admittedly, that\u2019s not hard. But his Syrian warmaking has also deeply alarmed regional states, uniting the Arabs, Israel and Iran in angry opposition while scaring the socks off the Saudi princes. They look askance at the Erdo\u011fan-Trump betrayal of the Kurds and rightly worry whether US security guarantees, and Nato solidarity, are mere desert mirages.\n\nNor does the EU, scarred over the years by Erdo\u011fan\u2019s tantrums over Turkey\u2019s accession, have any love for him. Perhaps Brussels believes his threat to send 3.6 million Syrian refugees to Europe. What\u2019s certain is that it justifiably fears his Syrian invasion will boost Islamic State terrorism. His early departure would be a boon for Europe.\n\nPlay Video 4:04 What does Turkey's military action in northern Syria mean? \u2013 video explainer\n\nBut getting rid of Erdo\u011fan is a matter for the Turks. And it wouldn\u2019t be quite as difficult as it might sound. True, Erdo\u011fan has overseen an extraordinary attack on political and civil rights, including the right to free speech and a free press. His purges have swept up senior opposition politicians, notably Selahattin Demirta\u015f, leader of the pro-Kurdish People\u2019s Democratic party (HDP), who came third in last year\u2019s presidential election despite being in jail. Judges, police chiefs, lawyers and civil servants who show signs of independent thinking have been sanctioned. The current crisis has brought further crackdowns on social media. And all the while, Erdo\u011fan pursues an often lethal vendetta against Turkey\u2019s Kurdish minority, linking them, for self-serving purposes, to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK).\n\nYet change is under way. Politically, Turkey is a divided country, split primarily between urban and rural \u2013 and since its founding in 2001, Erdo\u011fan\u2019s neo-Islamist Justice and Development party (AKP) has appealed to the latter constituency, to those attached to the traditional, devout way of doing things. Now, however, the mass movement of people into the cities is accelerating, the demographics are shifting, and so too are political allegiances. Istanbul, for example, has become a mega-city, home to more than 15 million people.\n\nIn June, this national evolution translated into a landmark AKP defeat in Istanbul\u2019s re-run mayoral election \u2013 a city Erdo\u011fan himself once ruled. Turkey\u2019s opposition, principally the Republican People\u2019s party (CHP), now controls nine out of the 10 biggest urban areas, which account for about 70% of GDP.\n\nAs Erdo\u011fan\u2019s excesses and failures mount, loyalty to him is weakening. High-profile AKP defectors include not only Babacan and Davuto\u011flu, who plan new political parties, but also Abdullah G\u00fcl, Turkey\u2019s former president and a man regarded for many years as Erdo\u011fan\u2019s chief crony. A new Nation Alliance of the CHP and the Good (\u0130yi) party was launched earlier this year. And there is talk of a broader, anti-AKP front encompassing the pro-Kurdish HDP \u2013 although analysts suggest it\u2019s a long shot.\n\nThe Kurds have faced their own \u2018endless war\u2019. And this is a dark new chapter | Giran Ozcan Read more\n\nErdo\u011fan\u2019s grip on power remains firm, but not as firm as it once was. The furious international backlash to his Syrian disaster, publicly exposing his fallibility, will weaken it further. If new steel and other sanctions imposed by Trump intensify entrenched economic problems, causing more hardship, price rises and job losses, and if Turkish army troops begin dying in large numbers in a Syrian quagmire, this modern-day sultan could be in terminal trouble.\n\nTurkey, when all is said and done, is a democracy, not a one-man dictatorship \u2013 a fact Erdo\u011fan has never fully grasped. Now, the charismatic aura that once surrounded him is dissolving. The spell that enthralled the country for so long is definitively broken. Erdo\u011fan\u2019s political obituaries are already being penned. He should jump before he is pushed.\n\n\u2022 Simon Tisdall is a foreign affairs commentator", "description": "The belligerent president has forgotten that his country is a democracy, not a dictatorship.
