There are no plans to charge the women, but it is unclear what will happen to their adoption plans, Milstead said.\n\nPaul Petersen More\n\nA neighbor, Bella Perez, said she has lived in the neighborhood for about a year and saw \u201ca lot of\u201d pregnant women and women with children coming in and out of the home. She thought maybe they were all part of a family living together, she said.\n\nWhen she saw several law enforcement officers in the area Tuesday, she thought it was a drug bust. Then a reporter knocked on her door, and she found out what had happened.\n\n\"That\u2019s crazy, that\u2019s like a lot. How can you do that to kids?\u201d Perez said of Peterson and the allegations against him. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy how a neighbor of yours is doing all those things and you don\u2019t even know.\u201d\n\nThe charges came out of a multistate investigation involving the Arizona Department of Public Safety, Homeland Security Investigations and the Utah Attorney General\u2019s Office, according to the Arizona Attorney General's Office.\n\nThe Utah attorney general charged Petersen with 11 other felonies, including communications fraud, human smuggling and sale of a child.\n\nHe also faces 19 federal charges, filed in the U.S. District Court for western Arkansas, related to allegations he illegally brought four people to the United States who continue to reside there.\n\nAn investigation by Honolulu Civil Beat last year questioned the legality of the adoptions Petersen administered.\n\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands is located near the equator in the Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and the Philippines. It has a population of about 53,000 people. Petersen, who is member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, served his church mission there, according to court documents.\n\nThe Arizona charges against Petersen\n\nThe Arizona Attorney General's Office investigation focused on Medicaid fraud. The indictment alleges Petersen illegally obtained medical services for the women, falsely claiming the women were Arizona residents.\n\nMilstead said DPS began investigating Petersen's adoption practices in December after a state trooper was tipped off by a friend who considered adopting through Petersen's office but was concerned about the legitimacy of the adoption process.\n\nThe Arizona case involves actions dating to November 2015, but according to court records, Petersen has arranged Marshallese adoptions since 2005.\n\nMilstead said he expects the DPS to recommend other charges to the Attorney General's Office.\n\nAccording to court records, the 28 pregnant women identified by Arizona investigators followed a similar adoption pattern:\n\nPetersen paid individuals in the Marshall Islands to help locate pregnant women interested in adoption. He then matched them with adoptive families in the U.S.\n\nPetersen paid the pregnant women $1,000 per month while they were pregnant in the U.S. and covered other expenses. Some birth mothers were promised up to $10,000 to place their unborn child for adoption.\n\nHe charged the adoptive families about $35,000 per adoption, claiming this included the birth mother's medical costs.\n\nPetersen sent money to the pregnant women in the Marshall Islands to purchase passports.\n\nPetersen paid for the women to fly to Phoenix and stay in a house he owns for the duration of their pregnancy. In some instances, the women gave birth within days of arriving in Arizona. In other cases, they were in the state as long as six months.\n\nShortly before the women gave birth, Petersen or his associates assisted her in signing up for Medicaid benefits, falsely stating they were Arizona residents.\n\nAfter the women gave birth and the adoption was complete, Petersen paid for them to fly back to the Marshall Islands or to other states \u2013 most often Arkansas.\n\nPetersen is accused of bilking the state out of more than $800,000, the Arizona Attorney General's Office said Wednesday.\n\nBrnovich said the Arizona investigation focuses solely on the alleged fraud to the state's Medicaid system and stressed that his office was not pursuing families who adopted children through Petersen's law office.", "description": "Maricopa County Assessor Paul Petersen arranged for 28 pregnant women from the Marshall Islands to travel to Arizona, the state Attorney General said.", "authors": ["Jessica Boehm", "Lily Altavena", "Uriel J.
