(AP) - Jack Price scored his first goal of the season, Tim Howard had his fifth shutout with three saves and the Colorado Rapids kept their slim playoff hopes alive with a 3-0 victory over FC Dallas on Sunday.\n\nColorado (12-15-6) remained three points behind Dallas (12-12-9), which holds the final playoff spot - one point up on San Jose with one game remaining.\n\nPrice, dribbling unimpeded down the pitch, sent a low bender from distance into the corner.\n\nThat stood until Diego Rubio\u2019s free kick, which he sent through the wall after a take shot by Price. Rubio\u2019s 11th goal game in the fourth minute of stoppage time in the first half.\n\nKei Kamara, thwarted on a penalty kick in the first half, sealed it in the 72nd with a give-and-go for a close-range 13th goal on the season.\n\nDallas keeper Jesse Gonzalez made seven saves.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Jack Price scored his first goal of the season, Tim Howard had his fifth shutout with three saves and the Colorado Rapids kept their slim playoff hopes alive with a 3-0 victory over FC Dallas on Sunday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
