Judge Beryl Howell, an Obama appointed judge, approved a request by House Democrats on Friday for access to redacted material from Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report, as well as various items referenced in it. Rep. Doug Collins (R-GA) said the ruling by Judge Beryl Howell is \"dangerous for every American.\"\n\nRep. Collins, the ranking member on the House Judiciary Committee, stated in a press release on Saturday that \"grand jury secrecy rules exist to protect innocent people against public disclosure of information and hearsay that could unfairly harm them.\" Rep. Collins criticized the judge's ruling for failing to consider historical experience and said he's looking forward \"to an expeditious appeal.\"\n\n\u201cWhen we\u2019re considering removing a democratically elected president, our best yardstick is historical experience, and this decision ignores that experience while failing to answer the crucial question of when this supposed 'impeachment inquiry\u2019 actually began. \"I look forward to an expeditious appeal.\u201d\n\nJudge Howell\u2019s ruling is dangerous.\n\n\n\nIf we\u2019re considering removing a democratically elected president, our best yardstick is historical experience.
