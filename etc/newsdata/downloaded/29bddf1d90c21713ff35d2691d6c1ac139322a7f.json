The squeeze then sent the cost of lira borrowing in swaps markets soaring past 1,000%.\n\nThis time, traders said there was no blanket freeze on lira lending from domestic Turkish banks.\n\n\"It reads like a warning that if the lira sells off again that the liquidity could be squeezed,\" said TD Securities emerging market strategist Izidor Flajsman.\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. prosecutors charged Turkish state lender Halkbank (IS: ) with taking part in a multibillion-dollar scheme to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran. In response, the bank's shares plunged.\n\n\"Offshore\" currency and swap markets are widely used because they are typically freer of central bank influence than domestic markets and international institutions generally find it easier to get credit lines with bigger banks.\n\nBut they are still vulnerable to the ebb and flow of local currency liquidity. And this -- as March showed -- is where authorities do retain an element of control.\n\nJust by shutting off its funding auctions for a while and maybe doing a bit of behind-the-scenes leaning on the local lenders, the central bank could spike the swap rates and briefly seize the market.\n\n\"We see that Turkish banks' tendency to supply lira to the swap market has fallen below the legal limit in recent days,\" said one senior Turkish market banker who requested anonymity.\n\nAt the end of March, lira supply to this market by Turkish banks was reduced to zero, excluding outstanding transactions, the banker said. \"We can't say today that it has been reduced to zero, but we see a serious decline.\"\n\nForeign banks and investors had put in measures to protect themselves from those kind of actions after being hit hard earlier in the year, the banker added.\n\nTurkey's BDDK regulator did not immediately comment on the lira moves.", "description": "Jump in lira FX swap rates jogs memories of spring squeeze", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9F10X_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
