They promise to shorten delivery times, ease congestion and decarbonize transport. But that technological vision is running into two problems \u2014 public skepticism and a missing regulatory framework.\n\n\u201cLots of people come and say they want to launch in central London, that\u2019s great but planning issues, privacy, power and public acceptance are more intensely felt there,\u201d Tim Johnson, policy director at the U.K. Civil Aviation Authority, said at the Global Urban Air Summit at Farnborough on Tuesday.\n\nThe challenge is that the nascent technologies span the range from what exists now \u2014 drones, for example \u2014 to those that are still on drawing boards, like various versions of flying cars. Regulators have to work out rules on everything from what is covered \u2014 the EU had a big debate on how heavy a drone has to be before tougher rules apply \u2014 to how such decisions affect shared airspace, noise levels, pollution and safety.\n\nWhile Brussels is trying to establish EU-wide rules, national regulators are also drawing up regulations, and often choosing divergent approaches.\n\n\"If we think if we go in anything less than incremental steps, then we\u2019re probably mistaken\" \u2014 Jon Round, Civil Aviation Authority official\n\n\"Picking our markets have been almost exclusively driven by politics, not economics,\" said Duncan Walker, co-founder and managing director of Skyports, a company that builds platforms and buildings from which aircraft can take off and land.\n\nHe said that working with regulators \"frankly, is a mess.\"\n\nWalker's words were echoed by other industry officials at the conference. Asked if U.K. authorities have implemented steps to allow the integration of unmanned aircraft into airspace, Harini Kulatunga, head of solutions for unmanned aerial systems at Airbus, said: \"I don't believe so.\"\n\nPlaying catch-up\n\nThe speed of technological change throws up another issue for regulators.\n\n\"It's equally as bad to get ahead of the industry as it is to get behind them,\" said Jay Merckle, executive director of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integration Office at the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, citing the risk that legislating too early means doing guesswork on which way the industry will go, and often getting it wrong.\n\nJon Round, head of airspace, air traffic management and aerodromes at the Civil Aviation Authority, asked for patience. \"If we think if we go in anything less than incremental steps, then we\u2019re probably mistaken.\"\n\nGetting technology and regulations aligned leaves another hurdle \u2014 persuading people that these services are needed.\n\nConvincing them to agree to more noisy objects flying above their heads is a challenge. People \"don\u2019t want noise above them unless they're the ones going on holiday in a plane or there\u2019s a drone delivery that\u2019s for them,\" said Round. \"The noise is enormous as an issue.\"\n\nHigh cost also makes it difficult for companies to make the argument that ordinary people will benefit. Current helicopter services in S\u00e3o Paulo, Mexico City and New York \u2014 running as pilot projects for Airbus and Uber \u2014 only cater to affluent customers.\n\nIndustry emphasized the need to outline the potential value of urban air mobility \u2014 moving organs and blood across a city rather than pizza, for example.\n\n\"The real challenge of making this successful is that people don\u2019t feel it\u2019s only for a select few,\" said James Cranswick, director of aviation at Deloitte, the consultancy.\n\nIt's all still pretty niche.\n\nCompanies argue that urban air mobility is a possible solution to congestion, but Uber, which is also investing in air transport, said it does not envision \"mass transport,\" and predicts eventually moving around 10,000 people in a city per day \u2014 a far cry from the 3.5 million who use London's public transport system every day.\n\nIndustry emphasized the need to outline the potential value of urban air mobility \u2014 moving organs and blood across a city rather than pizza, for example. The biggest challenge is \"social,\" said Mildred Troegeler, the director of global airspace integration at Boeing NeXt, the company's division that deals with urban air transport. \"We need to show the actual value of the operations.\"\n\nThis article is from POLITICO Pro: POLITICO\u2019s premium policy service.
