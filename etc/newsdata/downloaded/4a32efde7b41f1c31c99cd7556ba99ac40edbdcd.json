The Senegalese international has since delivered on that price tag with 50 league goals and has formed a lethal partnership with Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah in attack.\n\nCarragher, 41, told liverpoolfc.com: 'Even after the first couple of games, I said Mane, probably along with Raheem Sterling, was possibly the best left winger in the world.\n\nLiverpool legend Jamie Carragher believes Sadio Mane will be key for Liverpool this season\n\nMane has started strong this season with five Premier League goals in eight appearances\n\n'I absolutely love him, he's my favourite player at the club. He's brilliant, he's always got a smile on his face, always there, always gets knocked about, gets goals, setting others up.\n\n'He's the one who came in at the very start under Klopp, his first real big signing, and I think ever since then he's just been getting better and better. He's just a machine.'\n\nCarragher even compared Mane's abilities to club legend John Barnes, who formerly wore the number 10 shirt at Anfield.\n\n'I always talk about the teams I played in never possibly had, say, a John Barnes, that world-class wide player,' he added. 'But I think Liverpool have got that now.\n\n'I think that's what's making the difference why they are so good and look in a great position to hopefully go on and win the first Premier League.\n\n'If you start comparing people like Sadio Mane to John Barnes then that shows how well he's doing.'", "description": "Sadio Mane is one of the key men in the Liverpool squad and club legend Jamie Carragher has plenty of praise for him.
