Yards are cleaned up. Businesses are closed. People are hunkered down,\" Warner said by phone on Thursday.\n\nA tornado touched down in Carolina Shores, N.C., on Thursday.

Ferries stopped service on Wednesday, she said, so \"If you want to change your mind, it's too late. We're on our own.\"\n\nFurther north, Virginia was also in harm's way, and a round of evacuations was ordered there.\n\nThe hurricane hammered the Bahamas with 295 km/h winds, killing at least 30 people, but swept past Florida at a relatively safe distance, grazed Georgia, and then hugged the South Carolina-North Carolina coastline. At least four deaths in the U.S. Southeast have been blamed on the storm.\n\nTornadoes in South Carolina\n\nTwisters spun off by Dorian peeled away roofs and flipped trailers in South Carolina, and more than 250,000 homes and businesses were left without power. Dorian's winds weakened after sunset Thursday to 161 km/h, before falling further early Friday to 145 km/h, making it a Category 1 storm.\n\nAs of early Friday, Dorian was centred about 90 kilometres southwest of Cape Hatteras and 35 kilometres east of Cape Lookout, N.C., in the southern Outer Banks, along which hurricane-force wind gusts were reported. The storm was moving northeast at 22 km/h. It's expected to remain a hurricane as it sweeps up the Eastern Seaboard on Saturday, lashing the New England shore with heavy surf.\n\nIn coastal Wilmington, N.C., heavy rain fell horizontally, trees bent in the wind and traffic lights swayed as the hurricane drew near. As much as 380 millimetres of rain was forecast, with flash-flooding likely.\n\nOvernight winds were expected to cause trees and branches to fall on power lines, and debris could block repair crews from accessing damaged lines, said Mike Burnette senior vice president of Electric Cooperatives, a utility provider in North Carolina. Customers should prepare for prolonged power outages, he said.\n\nAn Isle of Palms, S.C., resident clears the drain on a street during Hurricane Dorian. (Mic Smith/Associated Press)\n\n\"We have a long night ahead of us. Everyone needs to stay in a safe place and off the roads until the storm passes,\" North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said Thursday.\n\nAbout 150 evacuees were camped out at the state'sCharlotte Motor Speedway, speedway spokesperson Scott Cooper said.\n\nLeslie Lanier, 61, was one of those who decided to stay behind on Ocracoke Island. She boarded up her home and bookstore, making sure to move the volumes higher.\n\n\"I think we're in for a great big mess,\" she said.\n\nSupporters of Republican Greg Murphy and Democrat Allen Thomas, the top candidates to replace the late Rep. Walter Jones Jr. in a special election on Tuesday, found themselves not campaigning, but pulling up signs to keep them from becoming airborne missiles.\n\nDorian swamped roads in historic downtown Charleston, S.C., and knocked down some 150 trees and toppled power lines. Gusts had topped 129 km/h in some areas. The port city sits on a peninsula that is prone to flooding even from ordinary storms.\n\nDorian apparently spawned at least one tornado in North Myrtle Beach, S.C., damaging several homes, and another twister touched down in the beach town of Emerald Isle, N.C., mangling and overturning several trailer homes in a jumble of sheet metal. No immediate injuries were reported.\n\nThe four deaths attributed to the storm in the mainland U.S. took place in Florida and North Carolina. All of them involved men who died in falls or by electrocution while trimming trees, putting up storm shutters or otherwise getting ready for the hurricane.\n\nNavy ships were ordered to ride out the storm at sea and military aircraft were moved inland. More than 700 airline flights scheduled for Thursday and Friday were cancelled. Hundreds of shelter animals were airlifted from coastal South Carolina to Delaware.", "description": "Dorian hit North Carolina's Outer Banks on Friday, lashing the low-lying barrier islands as a weakened Category 1 hurricane.", "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5272808.1567750934!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/tropical-weather-north-carolina.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
