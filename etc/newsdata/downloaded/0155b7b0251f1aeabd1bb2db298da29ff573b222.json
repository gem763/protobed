But the report did little to change the picture of a slowing, yet resilient U.S. economy.\n\nI break it down here.\n\nThe good:\n\nThe unemployment rate fell to 3.5 percent from 3.7 percent while the labor force participation rate held even at 62.3 percent.\n\nThe August total job gain was revised up to 168,000 from an initially reported 130,000, while July's gain was revised up to 166,000 from a previous estimate of 159,000 new hires.\n\nThe bad:\n\nDespite the drop in unemployment, the September jobs report fell short of projections that the U.S. would add roughly 145,000 new workers last month.\n\nThe average monthly jobs gain has sunk sharply from 223,000 in 2018 to 161,000 in 2019, though it remains above the roughly 100,000 new workers needed to keep the unemployment rate from rising.\n\nWage growth also slumped to an annualized gain of 2.9 percent despite unemployment near-record lows, which should theoretically drive wages higher.\n\nLEADING THE DAY\n\nTreasury IG to probe handling of Trump tax returns: The Treasury Department inspector general's (IG) office is investigating the department's handling and rejection of House Democrats' request for President Trump Donald John TrumpGordon Sondland expected to appear for House deposition Ivanka Trump on impeachment: 'Everything's a question of priorities' Second intel official considering filing complaint over Trump: report MORE's tax returns.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Treasury Office of Inspector General said Friday it is undertaking an inquiry requested by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal Richard Edmund NealTreasury IG agrees to probe handling of Trump tax returns request On The Money: Economy adds 136K jobs in September | Jobless rate at 50-year low | Treasury IG to probe handling of Trump tax returns request | House presses Zuckerberg to testify on digital currency IRS whistleblower said Treasury official might have tried to interfere with Trump audit: report MORE (D-Mass.).\n\n\"Chairman Neal has asked Treasury OIG to inquire into the process by which the Department received, evaluated, and responded to the Committee's request for federal tax information,\" Treasury acting Inspector General Rich Delmar said in a statement. \"We are undertaking that inquiry.\"\n\nIn a letter Neal sent to the IG on Monday, the chairman said that he wants to be sure that Treasury and the IRS are \"enforcing the law in a fair and impartial manner and no one is endeavoring to intimidate or impede government officials and employees carrying out their duties.\"\n\nThe Hill's Naomi Jagoda explains here.\n\nBackground: Neal in April requested six years of Trump's personal and business tax returns from the IRS, citing the committee's interest in oversight and in legislation about how the IRS enforces tax laws against a president. The Treasury Department rejected Neal's request and subsequent subpoenas, leading to Ways and Means to file suit against the department and the IRS.\n\nThe Committee revealed in court documents in August that a federal employee had reached out with credible allegations of possible attempts to influence the IRS's program for mandatory audits of presidents and vice presidents.\n\nTrade deficit rises to $54.9B in August: The U.S. trade deficit grew to $54.9 billion in August, a 1.6 percent increase from July, and a spike over last year.\n\nWhen compared to the same period last year, the overall trade deficit was up $28.3 billion, or 7.1 percent, as exports dropped slightly and imports spiked.\n\nAnalysts point to President Trump's trade war as a factor in the increased deficit, though the strong dollar and the growing budget deficit are major factors as well.

Other issues the committee has jurisdiction over include data privacy and whether the platform's online advertising system enables housing, employment or credit discrimination.\n\nGOOD TO KNOW\n\n...But White House trade adviser Peter Navarro on Friday declined to say whether he's ever raised investigating Joe Biden during trade talks with Chinese officials.\n\nMore than 140 companies and 18 major business associations have signed onto an amicus brief Friday in support of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, ahead of a Supreme Court hearing next month on President Trump's move to terminate it.\n\nODDS AND ENDS\n\nThe Trump administration unveiled a fuel proposal Friday that would buoy corn farmers and ethanol producers to the detriment of the nation's oil industry.\n\nA new California law that will allow collegiate athletes to profit from the use of their name or images has fueled a rush of new legislation in other states that hope to allow their own athletes to make money while still in college.\n\nRecap the week On The Money:", "description": "Happy Friday and welcome back to On The Money.
