Donovan, 51, his wife Angela Malloch and two of their children, Jemma and Zac, had lived in that five-bedroom English Tudor-style home from 2001 to 2009. Their third child, Molly, was born in 2011.\n\nThe family now lives in a mansion in Kensington in London worth about $10 million and only weeks ago he showed he was a good neighbour by helping to extinguish a fire raging at a home across the road in just his underwear.\n\nDonovan recently played Pharaoh in a revival of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat in the West End.\n\nAnd British PM Boris Johnston referenced him 10 days ago in his keynote speech at the Tory conference saying: \u201cWe export Jason Donovan CDs to North Korea, would you believe it!\u201d\n\nThe Bondi Beach apartment was purchased at a very different time in the Aussie star\u2019s life.\n\nShteinman remembers: \u201cWe joined both the apartments and had some pretty wild parties during the mid-90s.\n\n\u201cHe was going out with Erica Baxter for a number of years, who became Mrs Packer, we had Kylie Minogue stay occasionally.\n\n\u2019It was around the time he went over to Kate Moss\u2019s 21st at the Viper Room in Los Angeles and had his unfortunate collapse.\u201d\n\nDonovan documented the party, also attended by Michael Hutchence and Johnny Depp, in his autobiography between The Lines: My Story Uncut. He woke up in a hospital with a doctor advising: \u201cI suggest you lay off the drugs from now on.\u201d\n\nIt was Shteinman, best known for his work the award-winning film Angel Baby (1995), Rabbit-Proof Fence (2002) and Romper Stomper (1992), who\u2019d done the bidding for Donovan at the \u201ccompetitive\u201d auction way back then in 1994.\n\nIt had cost $451,000, which seemed like big bucks at the time.\n\nAlthough Donovan had already owned homes in Melbourne, it was his first and only Sydney property.\n\n\u201cHe loved Bondi and he\u2019s sad to see it go,\u201d Shteinman says, who\u2019d met Donovan a few years before that through film industry connections.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in such a fantastic spot with such a great view \u2026 it evokes that wonderful feeling of having a great time.\n\n\u201cJason worked very hard when he was younger, from when he was at school in Neighbours, straight into a hectic music career in the UK and the lead in Joseph [and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat], but he got to enjoy himself in Bondi.\u201d\n\nMr Bouskila says Donovan had been collecting $1700 per week in rent prior to the tenants moving on. But the new owner could expect up to $2000.\n\nHe says the apartment, which is one of just eight in The Empire complex, will be popular because of its never-to-be-built out views of Bondi Beach and the ocean to Ben Buckler.\n\nIt has a sunny northeast aspect from its huge windows, Scandi-style Oak floorboards and freshly painted interiors.\n\nTwo of the bedrooms have beach views. There\u2019s a modern kitchen with integrated appliances.", "description": "Just a month after his Toorak mansion sold for more than $8 million, Jason Donovan has put his Bondi Beach apartment up for November 7 auction.", "authors": ["Stephen Nicholls"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/11112318/capi_3fc6956327a7dab42bf3ef69fb0a4696_8cae77000c6fb49fb821775cd43da6be.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
