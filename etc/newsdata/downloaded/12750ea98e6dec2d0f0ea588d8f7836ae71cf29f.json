Refresh this page for more info.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nExactly one year after a Lion Air Boeing 737 Max crashed in Indonesia, killing 189 people, Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg is testifying before the Senate Commerce Committee to explain how the plane was built and certified despite fatal flaws being present.\n\nIt is his first public testimony since each of the two jets crashed in October 2018 and in March. Each flight crashed within minutes of taking off. A combined 346 people were killed. Both crashes have been attributed to an automated system known as MCAS, or Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System.\n\nThe system, which was designed to compensate for the fact that the Max had larger engines than previous versions of the 737, could be triggered by a single faulty angle-of-attack sensor. When it activated erroneously, it could point the jet's nose down, potentially causing it to crash.\n\nMuilenburg and John Hamilton, the chief engineer in Boeing's commercial airplane division, are testifying at a Senate hearing titled \"Aviation Safety and the Future of Boeing's 737 Max.\" Later in the day, representatives from the National Transportation Safety Board and the Joint Authorities Technical Review \u2014 an international panel which investigated the FAA's actions to certify the 737 Max \u2014 will also testify.\n\nThe hearings come as Boeing has faced increasing criticism for its design and process of certifying the jet. The FAA has also been criticized for lax oversight of the planemaker.\n\nSenator Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, opened the hearing by describing the need to understand how the plane was certified, as well as recent developments including the release of internal messages suggesting Boeing may have known about issues with the automated system.\n\nMessages released have \"reflected a disturbing level of casualness and flippancy that seem to corroborate these criticisms,\" he said.\n\nSenator Maria Cantwell, the ranking member on the committee, blasted falling adherence to safety standards in her opening statement.\n\nSurvivors arrive with photos of those killed in Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and Lion Air Flight 610 before a Senate Transportation Committee hearing on 'Aviation Safety and the Future of Boeing's 737 MAX' on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Oct. 29, 2019.

One of those is moving to a dual sensor\" activation, Muilenburg said in response to a question from Senator John Thune.\n\n\"How frequently are new automated systems left out of the training manuals that you give to pilots,\" Senator Amy Klobuchar asked.\n\n\"More information in the training manuals is not necessarily safer,\" Muilenburg replied. \"But, as we understand from these accidents, we need to provide more information aon MCAS to enhance safety.\"\n\n\"Our approach is to train pilots on the effects of a failure mode,\" he added. \"That is what's in the training manual. We train pilots to respond to the effects of the failure, not to diagnose the cause.\"", "description": "The Senate Commerce Committee is questioning Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg \u2014 check here for live updates.", "authors": ["David Slotnick"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5cc7342fb14bf4380f783b63?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
