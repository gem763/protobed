But she has never experienced anything like Hurricane Dorian.\n\n\u201cThere is no way you can compare this to any storm I\u2019ve been through before,\u201d she said over the phone from Grand Bahama, where she is holed up at her mother\u2019s house waiting for the storm to pass.\n\n\u201cThe wind speed is ferocious. It\u2019s vicious, that\u2019s the only way I can describe it. You can\u2019t sleep because you don\u2019t want something to happen to you in your sleep.\u201d\n\nDorian has the strongest landfall wind speed of any Atlantic hurricane on record and crashed across the island of Grand Bahama, east of Florida, more than 24 hours ago before settling over the island.\n\nAs of the early hours of Tuesday morning, it had not moved for more than 12 hours, meaning for that entire time the same communities had been lashed relentlessly by winds of up to 155mph (250km/h), enduring storm surges of up to 5.5 metres (18ft) above normal tide level.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hurricane Dorian, seen from the family home of Kimberley Mullings, in the Bahamas, on Tuesday.

They have a generator so still have electricity, though their water has also been cut off. They have provided shelter to 12 people, including family friends.\n\nThey put down sandbags and tied down anything they thought could have become a missile. Even with all all these preparations, they are still not sure if their home will bear up against the unprecedented winds.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen trees snap, literally snap,\u201d said Mullings. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen pots with plants that are really heavy \u2013 80lbs [36kg] \u2013 moving. We have seen cars crash into each other because of the wind speed and the flooding.\u201d\n\nDespite their garage being classified as being able to withstand hurricanes, she can hear and see it flex in the wind.\n\nKimberley Mullings.

We have hurricane impact doors and windows and we can still see the blinds move. The doors are shut, these lock in five places \u2026 they\u2019re properly insulated and they\u2019re still moving.\u201d\n\nMullings is lucky. Her home is in one of the few parts of Grand Bahama that hasn\u2019t experienced flooding. She has friends who live in two and three-storey homes on the island, where the water has risen so high they have been forced to wait out the storm in their roof spaces.\n\n\u201cSome of them have babies, newborn babies, children, who are in the roof with them. Their entire families are waiting it out with them. Some of them are wet.\u201d\n\nSeveral shelters, including one for people with special needs, have been compromised, she said, forcing people to take shelter in the hospital, which she has heard has also experienced serious flooding.\n\nPlay Video 1:02 Deadly Hurricane Dorian stalls over Bahamas \u2013 video\n\n\u201cThe police can\u2019t do anything. Their vehicles are all under water. Fire trucks are under water. It\u2019s a pretty scary situation to be in. No one can come to help and you can\u2019t leave to get anywhere.\u201d\n\nMullings is already thinking ahead to what this hurricane, the latest in a run of devastating storms, will mean for the Bahamas. \u201cI have great concerns about what it means for the country moving forward,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery time we try to make a comeback we have another storm.\u201d\n\nFor now all she, and the other 52,000 people on Grand Bahama, can do is wait for Dorian to finally move on.", "description": "Communities have been lashed relentlessly by the unprecedented Atlantic storm", "authors": ["Kate Lyons"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5627d0619958eaabed9ed1157a94096c366e8871/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=66a1a7f36e9829d861694e72a080d017"}
