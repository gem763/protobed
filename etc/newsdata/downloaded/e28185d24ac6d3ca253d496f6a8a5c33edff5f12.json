In one cartoon, a broadcaster intones: \u201cThose are the headlines, and we\u2019ll be back in a moment to blow them out of proportion.\u201d\n\nMr. Fradon, who once insisted he was less a cartoonist than a \u201cmisplaced baseball player,\u201d generated ideas from radio, television and especially the New York Times, which he marked up with a pen over his morning coffee. The results were contemporary but also timeless, in part because corruption, greed and outright lies never seemed to go out of fashion.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne of his best-known cartoons depicted a set of file cabinets with labels reading, \u201cOur Facts,\u201d \u201cTheir Facts,\u201d \u201cNeutral Facts,\u201d \u201cDisputable Facts,\u201d \u201cAbsolute Facts,\u201d \u201cBare Facts,\u201d \u201cUnsubstantiated Facts\u201d and \u201cIndisputable Facts.\u201d That drawing ran in 1977, former New Yorker cartoon editor Bob Mankoff noted in an interview, but \u201ccome on, what cartoon could be more relevant to what we\u2019re going through now?\u201d Perhaps the only thing missing was a drawer labeled \u201cAlternative Facts.\u201d\n\nMr. Fradon, who also wrote children\u2019s books and contributed cartoons to newspapers across the country, was 97 when he died Oct. 3 at his home in Woodstock, N.Y. The cause was liver cancer, said his daughter, Amy Fradon, a folk singer.\n\nThe New Yorker featured cartoons beginning with its first issue, in 1925, and had already established itself as a leading platform for humorists by the time Mr. Fradon signed on in 1948 as the last cartoonist hired by founding editor Harold Ross. He went on to spend most of the next 55 years at the magazine, briefly leaving in the 1990s \u2014 he was reportedly frustrated by the new regime of editor Tina Brown \u2014 before returning under current editor David Remnick.\n\nMr. Fradon was \u201cone of the bedrock cartoonists\u201d of the magazine\u2019s mid-century \u201cGolden Age,\u201d fellow New Yorker cartoonist Michael Maslin said by email. Along with artists such as Whitney Darrow Jr., Frank Modell, James Stevenson and Robert Weber, he added, Mr. Fradon was \u201cunbelievably adept at providing high-bar work \u2014 much of it evergreen \u2014 seemingly at a headline\u2019s notice.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cAs a fledgling artist, I paid attention to the breadth of his curiosity as well as the mastery of his drawings \u2014 the structured washes and tones and the animated line,\u201d Edward Koren, another New Yorker cartoonist, wrote in a tribute for the magazine. \u201cThis is what Fradon used to satisfy the signature requirement of [the] magazine\u2019s first art editor, James Geraghty, who asked of his artists, \u2018Make it beautiful.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMr. Fradon\u2019s \u201celaborate drawings,\u201d he continued, \u201cwere generous masterpieces of compressed fun.\u201d One such cartoon, from 1991, showed a couple standing in the moonlight on a remote jungle hilltop, watching as a volcano erupted like a jack-in-the-box, spouting a spring-loaded toy head instead of molten lava. \u201cThe gods are antic tonight,\u201d the caption read.\n\nMuch of his work was more overtly satirical, addressing current affairs without dipping into partisan politics \u2014 albeit with an unmistakably left-leaning point of view. A self-described Roosevelt Democrat, he served for several years in the 1970s on the city council in Newtown, Conn., before deciding that issues of underground utility wires were taking too much time away from drawing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne Fradon cartoon featured a pair of grumpy middle-aged men sneering at a bird feeder, marked \u201cSquirrels Welcome.\u201d It was accompanied by a one-word caption: \u201cLiberals!\u201d Another showed an angry invalid, tended to by a doctor. \u201cYou should take it easy for a while, Mr. Harner,\u201d the physician says. \u201cYou\u2019ve been infected by the virus of hate.\u201d\n\nMr. Fradon\u2019s work drew on Greek mythology, Roman history, medieval lore and French literature, with one 1986 cartoon portraying what appeared to be the Three Musketeers, lifting their swords in unison and declaring, \u201cEvery man for himself!\u201d Others ventured into the arcana of finance, showing a bank teller punching a customer in the jaw as part of \u201can extra \u2018substantial penalty\u2019 for the early withdrawal of your time deposit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat motivates one cartoonist to do amusing drawings about cats, dogs, husbands and wives, and another to delve into bribes, kickbacks and political hacks?\u201d Mr. Fradon asked in the preface of his 1978 collection \u201cInsincerely Yours.\u201d His former editor, Geraghty, offered one potential explanation: \u201cLet\u2019s face it, Dana, you\u2019re not motivated by any love for the oppressed, you\u2019re motivated by hatred of the oppressor!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cTaken with a grain of salt, or salt substitute,\u201d Mr. Fradon wrote in his book, \u201cit was a correct analysis.\u201d\n\nIt was also, perhaps, the result of an upbringing in Depression-era Chicago, where he was born Arthur Dana Fradon on April 14, 1922. His parents were Russian-Ukrainian immigrants who credited President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal with helping them through the Depression, and his father served as a precinct captain in their South Side neighborhood.\n\nMr. Fradon was raised in part by an older sister, Marion, and developed an interest in art and politics at a young age. He attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago before being drafted into the Army, and rarely spoke of his war years aside from noting that by then he was already drawing political cartoons.\n\nAD\n\nMoving to New York, he studied at the Art Students League, \u201ca future cartoonists paradise\u201d where attendance wasn\u2019t taken and grades weren\u2019t given, and where he met Ramona Dom, a fine arts student he married in 1948. She later became a celebrated illustrator, drawing Aquaman and Brenda Starr comics.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBoth my mom and dad were so busy drawing that they would put a big sheet of paper on the floor and drop colored pencils down for me to scribble with,\u201d Amy Fradon told the New York Times in 2000, recalling her childhood. Mr. Fradon and his wife divorced in the early 1980s but remained friends, and in the past four years lived together with Amy and her husband, Peter Schoenberger. No other immediate family members survive.\n\nMr. Fradon contributed to publications including Collier\u2019s, the Saturday Evening Post and the left-wing New Masses before being pointed toward the New Yorker by his brother-in-law, Albert Hubbell, a writer and illustrator at the magazine. He later wrote and illustrated several children\u2019s books inspired by his love of the Middle Ages, including \u201cSir Dana: A Knight, as Told by His Trusty Armor\u201d (1988).\n\nAD\n\nNotable deaths in 2019: Ric Ocasek, Valerie Harper, Ross Perot, Toni Morrison, and others we have lost this year share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image Ginger Baker, the prodigiously talented and volcanically temperamental rock drummer who helped form Cream, rock-and-roll\u2019s first supergroup, and inspired awe and imitation in a generation of drummers, died Oct. 6 at 80. Read the obituary (Mj Kim/AP)\n\nFor decades, he worked out of a pre-Revolutionary farmhouse in Newtown, where his attic studio was cluttered with drawings and artists\u2019 materials, including his daughter\u2019s coveted plastic farm animals, which he arranged on a wooden beam for inspiration. When the toys didn\u2019t help, he enlisted his wife to help with animal drawings, especially of horses.\n\nAD\n\nThe couple collaborated again in recent years, working on cartoons they published on Facebook. One showed the grim reaper at a man\u2019s apartment door, with a scythe in hand and \u201cTrump\u201d campaign button on his cloak. \u201cRelax!\u201d the caption reads. \u201cI\u2019m only here to spread fear.\u201d\n\nMr. Fradon said that he was unable to stop drawing, long after filing his last New Yorker cartoon in 2003. \u201cFor a time, when I thought of a good idea that I thought would go in today\u2019s New Yorker, I stifled it,\u201d he told Maslin in a 2013 interview. \u201cAnd then I said to myself: well don\u2019t do that anymore, write \u2019em down \u2014 so I write them down on a scrap of paper and throw them into a pile.\u201d\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nAD", "description": "He skewered plutocrats, hucksters, crass politicians and a sensationalist media.", "authors": ["Harrison Smith", "Obituary Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/H97SSkn_iBcSabFb2KzB3OSA-aM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WY5PU7HRFEI6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
