Photo: Ben Rothstein / Netflix\n\nSpoilers below for El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie and its ending.\n\nThe last time we saw Jesse Pinkman in Breaking Bad, he was behind the steering wheel of an El Camino, screaming through happy tears as he sped off the Aryan Brotherhood compound where he had been held hostage. The last time we see Jesse Pinkman in El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie, the Netflix film that reveals what happened to Jesse (Aaron Paul) in the days that followed the events of the Breaking Bad finale, he is, once again, driving a car. But this time he\u2019s heading to Alaska and a new life that he\u2019ll live with a new last name. There are no tears, just a very slight, almost imperceptible smile. Jesse\u2019s expression, for the first time in the entire movie, is calm.\n\nThat certainly seems like a happy ending for the former crystal meth maker, right-hand man to Walter White (Bryan Cranston), and perhaps most beloved character in the Breaking Bad universe. It\u2019s easy to watch the conclusion of El Camino and presume that Jesse is finally free as he enters that American state known as the last frontier, and that all his problems are solved. But I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s quite that simple.\n\nThe movie itself gives us reasons to doubt that. In a flashback near the very end of the movie, El Camino takes us back in time to a conversation that Jesse had with his now-late girlfriend, Jane (Krysten Ritter), who tells him that going wherever the universe takes you is a terrible idea. \u201cI\u2019ve gone where the universe takes me my whole life,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s better to make those decisions for yourself.\u201d Jesse, heading off on his own toward Alaska completely unencumbered by his old identity and connections, looks on the surface like someone who is making decisions for himself. One could certainly argue that in El Camino he does just that: He does whatever he has to do to get the hell out of Albuquerque, then he chooses to go to Alaska. But he got there because other men steered him down this snow-covered path.\n\nJesse, heading off on his own toward Alaska completely unencumbered by his old identity and connections, looks on the surface like someone who is making decisions for himself. One could certainly argue that in El Camino he does just that. He does whatever he has to do to make sure he gets the hell out of Albuquerque, then he chooses to go to Alaska. But he\u2019s gotten where he is because other men steered him down this snow-covered path.\n\nJesse\u2019s desire to make Alaska his new home springs from a conversation he had with Mike Ehrmentraut (Jonathan Banks), shown to us in an earlier flashback. If he could start over as a young man, Mike tells Jesse, he\u2019d go to Alaska. Of course, Mike never gets the chance to start over anywhere: As we know from Breaking Bad, he gets killed by Walt. Jesse seemingly chooses Alaska as his destination because he is inspired by Mike, though it\u2019s unclear whether he feels a responsibility to go there because Mike never got to go himself, or because he just likes the idea and steals it.\n\nEvery tool Jesse uses to escape Albuquerque is something he takes from other men. He swaps Skinny Pete\u2019s Thunderbird for his El Camino, something Skinny Pete himself suggests. He snags Todd\u2019s money from where it\u2019s stashed in Todd\u2019s refrigerator, and later claims the rest from Neil and Casey, the two associates of Todd\u2019s who also come searching for it. In his final showdown with Neil and Casey, Jesse snatches the .22-caliber pistol from another significant male in his life: his own father. When he\u2019s mocked for carrying such a low-caliber weapon, Jesse makes the gun sound like an artifact he inherited. \u201cIt was my grandfather\u2019s,\u201d he says. Jesse is deciding what to do, sure. But it doesn\u2019t seem quite right to say he\u2019s acting independently. He has to rely on other men, or the things that belong to other men, to achieve his objective.\n\nHe relies on nobody more for that purpose than Ed, the fixer played by the late Robert Forster. A common denominator between all the Breaking Bad properties \u2014 the original series, Better Call Saul, and El Camino \u2014 is that each one focuses on a man who changes his identity, usually, at some point, with help from Ed. Bob Odenkirk\u2019s Jimmy McGill becomes Saul Goodman by choice, but he becomes a Cinnabon employee from Nebraska because he has to. Walter White also assumes his alter ego, Heisenberg, by choice in Breaking Bad, but eventually he needs Ed\u2019s assistance to assume another identity and slip away to New Hampshire. Jesse is the only one who never tries to be anyone else until the universe puts him in a place where he seemingly has no other option. After seeking out Ed in El Camino, Jesse does choose Alaska as his future place of residence. But his new name, his new social security number, and the birthdate of his pretend father: All those details about who he\u2019ll be for the rest of his life are decided for him by somebody else.\n\nEven though Walt is dead at this point, the connection between the two of them is still strongly felt in El Camino, via the terrific flashback to their conversation in the diner and also the parallels between how their onscreen exits play out. When Jesse visits Neil and Casey to get another $1,800 of Todd\u2019s money, he takes a page from good \u2018ol Mr. White\u2019s playbook: Just like Walt did at the Nazi compound in the Breaking Bad finale, Jesse brings surprise ammunition to the face-off. When Jesse climbs out from his hiding spot in Ed\u2019s truck to find himself in wintry surroundings, it feels like a repeat of what Walt did when he fled to that cabin in New Hampshire. Even Walt\u2019s last look at his son, Walt Jr., and his decision to leave him a trust fund is echoed in the letter that Jesse gives to Ed to mail on his behalf. The letter is addressed to Brock, the closest thing Jesse has to a son, and a young boy who\u2019s now rendered motherless as a result, albeit somewhat indirectly, of choices Jesse made. We can\u2019t see what the letter says. But like the money Walt reserves for his namesake, it\u2019s fair to assume the letter is an attempt to make amends. Even when he doesn\u2019t necessarily realize it, Jesse is still following in the footsteps of Walter White.\n\nRepeatedly, Jesse is told in El Camino to appreciate what a rare and amazing chance he has to start over fresh. Ed tells him that. Mike tells him that in the flashback. In the diner scene, Walt talks about how Jesse could go to college and study business when all this meth stuff is over, which is essentially a different version of the same idea: He still has his whole life ahead of him. You can watch Jesse go down that long snowy road at the end of El Camino and believe that\u2019s still true. Jesse had to rely on his past traumatic experiences to claw his way out of New Mexico and evade the cops, but now he can finally put the whole meth mess behind him.\n\nOr you can watch Jesse drive away and realize that he had no choice but to go to Alaska. You can realize the notion that he can \u201cmake decisions for himself\u201d has evaporated just as it did for Walt and Saul once they broke bad. You can see that last moment as one of reinvention or renewal, or you can see it as the moment that he has to say good-bye to the Jesse Pinkman he could have been. You can say he finally escaped. But you could just as easily say he had to disappear.\n\nEl Caimno deliberately doesn\u2019t tell us which interpretation is right, although the tiny smile that Aaron Paul flashes at the very end suggests he\u2019s closer to being in a good place than not. Still, the ending to the Jesse Pinkman story is just as ambiguous \u2014 maybe even more ambiguous \u2014 than the one we got in the Breaking Bad finale. That feels right. We shouldn\u2019t be able to see the end of this winding road or where it will take him next. Walter White got something finite. His penalty was death. Jesse gets life, but not his own.", "description": "It\u2019s easy to watch the conclusion of El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie and presume that Jesse (Aaron Paul) is finally free.
