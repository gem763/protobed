But with less than a month to the scheduled departure date it is still uncertain if it will leave with a deal or without one - or even not leave at all.\n\nIn a strategy that will define the future of Brexit, the EU and his premiership, Johnson said he wanted to get a deal but that he was ready for a no-deal - a scenario that would spook financial markets and send shockwaves through the global economy.\n\nMany EU diplomats fear the United Kingdom is heading towards a no-deal or another delay as they say the British proposals are not enough to get an agreement by Oct. 31. Johnson said further delay was \u201cpointless and expensive\u201d.\n\nBrexit has for over three years divided the United Kingdom and left British politics in turmoil. In the June 23, 2016 referendum, 17.4 million voters, or 52 percent, backed Brexit while 16.1 million, or 48 percent, backed staying in the bloc.\n\n\u201cLAST\u201d BREXIT OFFER\n\nAfter weeks of talks since Johnson took power in July that have made little headway to break the Brexit stand-off, the prime minister will made his last gambit - a new proposal which British officials describe as a final offer.\n\nBritain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson gives a closing speech at the Conservative Party annual conference in Manchester, Britain, October 2, 2019. REUTERS/Henry Nicholls\n\nA senior British government official said: \u201cThe government is either going to be negotiating a new deal or working on no deal \u2014 nobody will work on delay.\u201d\n\nGiving little detail on his proposals, he said there would be no checks at or near the Irish border. He said London would respect the 1998 peace agreement that ended three decades of conflict in the province. He did not explain how.\n\n\u201cBy a process of renewable democratic consent by the executive and assembly of Northern Ireland,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe will go further and protect the existing regulatory arrangements for farmers and other businesses on both sides of the border.\u201d\n\nHe said the United Kingdom \u201cwhole and entire\u201d would withdraw from the EU, with London keeping control of its own trade policy from the start. He said technology could offer a solution but gave no specifics.\n\nHowever, parliament has passed a law stating that Brtiain cannot leave the EU with no deal and Johnson has not revealed how he plans to get around that should he fail to secure an agreement.\n\nEU diplomats and officials in Brussels, reacting to earlier British media reports on what the proposal contained, called it \u201cfundamentally flawed\u201d and expressed doubt it would be accepted.\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s take it or leave it, we better close the book and start talking about the modalities of an extension,\u201d the official said.\n\nThe European Union will examine \u201cobjectively\u201d any new UK proposals on Brexit and wishes to enter into \u201cconstructive\u201d talks with London, a spokeswoman for the bloc\u2019s executive European Commission said.", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday made a final Brexit offer to the European Union but said that if Brussels did not engage then Britain would leave on Oct. 31 without a deal.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Piper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191002&t=2&i=1436225867&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF910X2"}
