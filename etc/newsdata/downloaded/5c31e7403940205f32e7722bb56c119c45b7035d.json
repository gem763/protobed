Several analysts knocked their ratings and price targets on the stock.\n\nThe global company said its imprintables, or printwear, business \u2014 where it makes shirts and jackets that teams and corporations can stamp on their logos \u2014 suffered weaker-than-expected demand that was due to continue.\n\nLower demand cut sales by about US$50 million in the third quarter that ended Sept. 29 as U.S. printwear sales fell in high single-digit percentages compared with expectations of low single-digit growth. Printwear demand in Europe and China was also softer, it said.\n\n\u201cThe company estimates that lower demand expectations than previously projected will reduce the company\u2019s sales projection for the fourth quarter by approximately $70 million and anticipates distributor inventory destocking will negatively impact sales by approximately $100 million,\u201d Gildan said in a statement.\n\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization for the full year is now expected in the range of US$545 million to US$555 million compared with previous guidance of more than US$615 million, the company said.\n\nThe slump comes months after Gildan reported the Asian economy was \u201con fire,\u201d and could be symptomatic of a wider industry downturn because of Gildan\u2019s size, according to Bloomberg, citing Keith Howlett, an analyst at Desjardins Capital Markets.\n\n\u201cThe printwear channel is reliant on demand from the promotional products channel, and it is possible that economic anxiety has caused some companies to reduce discretionary spending,\u201d Howlett said in a note. He downgraded his rating to sell from buy.\n\nGildan did say sales by its more recent retail business that includes its own-brand underwear was in line with expectations. The company has been able to compete with Hanesbrand Inc. and Fruit of the Loom owned by Berkshire Hathaway Inc. by building a global production chain.\n\nMark Petrie at CIBC said despite the magnitude of the profit warning, it wasn\u2019t as bad as it\u2019s been in the past for the retailer. \u201cThat being said, de-stocking issues can linger, and we have limited visibility overall, so it is difficult to have conviction in the pace and shape of a recovery.\u201d He reduced his price target to US$30 from US$40.\n\nBank of America Merrill Lynch cut its rating to underperform from buy. \u201cEnd demand from corporate customers has been especially weak, potentially tied to a slowing economy,\u201d analyst Heather Balsky wrote in a note. \u201cThe BofAML macro team expects continued U.S. economic deceleration, which does not bode well for future demand in our view.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Email: cmcclelland@postmedia.com", "description": "Stock slid to as low as US$23.45, its biggest intraday drop since 2008", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/gildan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
