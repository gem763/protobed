Other conditions cannabis is used for include nausea, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury, but this study did not examine its impact on those.\n\nMedicinal cannabinoids include medicinal cannabis and pharmaceutical cannabinoids, as well as their synthetic derivatives, THC, or delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol \u2013 the main psychoactive ingredient of cannabis \u2013 and cannabidiol, or CBD.\n\n\u201cCannabinoids are often advocated as a treatment for various mental health conditions,\u201d Degenhardt said. \u201c(But) clinicians and consumers need to be aware of the low quality and quantity of evidence \u2026 and the potential risk of adverse events.\u201d\n\nDegenhardt\u2019s team sought to look at all available evidence for all types of medicinal cannabinoids. They included all study designs and investigated the impact on remission from and symptoms of depression, anxiety, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Tourette syndrome, PTSD and psychosis. They analyzed 83 published and unpublished studies covering around 3,000 people between 1980 and 2018.\n\nThey found that pharmaceutical THC \u2013 either with or without CBD \u2013 made psychosis worse, and did not significantly affect any other primary outcomes for the mental illnesses analyzed.\n\nIt also increased the number of people who reported side effects, and the number who decided to withdraw from a study due to side effects.\n\nTom Freeman, an addiction and mental health expert at Britain\u2019s Bath University who was not involved with the study, said the findings highlighted an urgent need for high-quality trials of medical cannabis to strengthen the evidence \u2013 particularly given what he said was \u201csignificant demand\u201d from patients.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Studies that analyzed the impact of medicinal cannabis on six mental health disorders, the researchers found \u201ca lack of evidence for their effectiveness.\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Untitled-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
