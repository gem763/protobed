He was asked before Game 4 of the AL Championship Series about reports that indicated the New York Yankees suspected the Astros of whistling from their dugout during the opener to communicate pitch selection to their batters.\n\nMajor League Baseball looked into it and concluded Houston didn\u2019t break any rules, a person familiar with the matter confirmed to The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly.\n\n\u201cMan, I\u2019m glad you asked that question, and I thought it would come up today,\u201d Hinch said at the start of his Yankee Stadium news conference. \u201cIn reality, it\u2019s a joke. But Major League Baseball does a lot to ensure the fairness of the game. There\u2019s people everywhere. If you go through the dugouts and the clubhouses and the hallways, there\u2019s like so many people around.\n\n\u201cAnd then when I get contacted about some questions about whistling, it made me laugh because it\u2019s ridiculous. And had I known that it would take something like that to set off the Yankees or any other team, we would have practiced it in spring training,\u201d he added. \u201cIt apparently works, even when it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nHinch said he understands the \u201cgamesmanship\u201d and \u201ccreating a narrative for yourself.\u201d\n\nBut he\u2019s bothered by the anonymous accusations.\n\n\u201cThe problem I have is when other people take shots at us outside this competition,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cWhen you guys ask me this question, my face, my name is by my quotes, my opinions, my reaction is all for you guys to tweet out and put on the broadcast. But we have people that are unnamed, or you guys have sources that are giving you information. I suggest they put their name by it if they\u2019re so passionate about it to comment about my team or my players.\u201d\n\nHouston made headlines last year following suspicions of illegal sign stealing when a man associated with the Astros was caught pointing a cellphone into opposing dugouts.\n\n\u201cI understand where the paranoia comes from. We have it. I have it,\u201d said Astros ace Justin Verlander, scheduled to start Game 5 on Friday in New York.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be using multiple signs here tomorrow night. There\u2019s just so many cameras and there\u2019s so much video now, it just kind of evolved a few years ago. You\u2019ve got teams studying what signs you use at second base before you even step on the mound. \u2026 You just have to be extremely diligent about it and pay attention and try to do the best you can to not help the team know what\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nHinch pointed out that during the game in question this time, the Astros were shut out on three hits by Masahiro Tanaka and three Yankees relievers.\n\n\u201cSo nobody heard it. You guys have audio, video, people in places, and nothing. There\u2019s no evidence of anything,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cSo to the Yankees, there\u2019s no - nothing bad going on. Pitch tipping is a little bit of a different story. If you don\u2019t want us to know the pitch is coming, don\u2019t do something that demonstrates what pitch you\u2019re going to pitch or what you\u2019re going to throw. But they\u2019re doing the same thing. Every hitter wants to know what\u2019s coming by virtue of what a pitcher is doing or not doing.\u201d\n\nYankees manager Aaron Boone declined to comment about the whistling allegations, but acknowledged all teams are always looking to gain an edge - and they try to get into each other\u2019s heads.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of the game,\u201d he said.\n\nWith a World Series berth at stake, Houston held a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven playoff between American League heavyweights.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing going on other than the competition on the field,\u201d Hinch said. \u201cThe fact that I had to field the question before a really, really cool game at Yankee Stadium is unfortunate. But we can put it to rest. That will be the last question I answer about pitch tipping or pitch stealing.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Astros manager AJ Hinch blew his own whistle Thursday on sign stealing and pitch tipping: He's had enough of allegations about Houston hitters going out of bounds to decipher what's coming at the plate.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Mike Fitzpatrick"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/17/alcs_astros_yankees_baseball_06639_c0-151-3611-2257_s1200x700.jpg?125e2b879f871a4948e524beddb1eee95bf705e9", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
