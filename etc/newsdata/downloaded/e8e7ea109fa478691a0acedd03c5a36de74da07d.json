But late today, Netanyahu announced he came up short.\n\n'Since I received the mandate, I have worked tirelessly both in public and behind the scenes to establish a broad, national unity government. That's what the people want,' Mr Netanyahu said in a statement.\n\n'During the past few weeks, I made every effort to bring Benny Gantz to the negotiating table. Every effort to establish a broad national unity government, every effort to prevent another election,' he said. 'To my regret, time after time he declined. He simply refused.'\n\nIn a short statement, Mr Gantz's Blue and White party said: 'Now is the time of action.'\n\n'Blue and White is determined to form the liberal unity government, led by Benny Gantz, that the people of Israel voted for a month ago,' it said.\n\nRetired Israeli General Benny Gantz, Netanyahu's chief rival, will now have a chance to try to form a government (pictured: at the Jordan Valley site of Naharayim, also known as Baqura in Jordan, on October 18)\n\nThere is no guarantee that he will succeed. He has expressed willingness to form a partnership with Likud, but not if Mr Netanyahu continues to lead while he faces such serious legal problems. For the time being, Likud has remained behind its leader.\n\nWithout Likud, Mr Gantz will have a hard time securing a majority in parliament. The opposition to Mr Netanyahu includes a diverse group, ranging from Arab parties to the secular ultra-nationalist party Yisrael Beitenu, that are unlikely to sit together in partnership.\n\nIf Mr Gantz fails during his 28-day window, a majority of legislators could try to endorse a third candidate, something that has never happened before, and if that fails, the country would be forced into the unprecedented scenario of a third election in under a year.", "description": "Netanyahu, who heads the right-wing Likud party, said today he was returning the mandate back to Israel's president, Reuven Rivlin after 'working unceasingly ... to establish a broad unity government'.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/21/18/20001774-0-image-a-4_1571680142152.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
