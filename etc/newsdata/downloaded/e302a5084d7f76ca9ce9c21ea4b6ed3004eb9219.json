The link between stress and fertility or menopause is controlled by chemicals and hormones in the body. Regular, or high levels of, stress causes quantities of the hormone cortisol \u2013 known as the stress hormone \u2013 to spike. High levels of cortisol have been found in studies to reduce how much estradiol the body produces. This is a form of the female sex hormone oestrogen. Low levels of oestrogen, usually caused by a natural decline as a woman gets older and exits child-bearing age, are what triggers the menopause, because the sex hormone becomes so unavailable to the body that it is no longer fertile and the reproductive system begins to shut down. Therefore, higher stress levels \u2013 which can be caused by living in busy urban areas \u2013 may reduce levels of oestrogen faster than in women who are less stressed and bring forward the age at which they begin the menopause.\n\n'Lower cortisol levels have in turn been associated with higher oestradiol levels, which makes it plausible that women with less stress, thus lower cortisol, might maintain higher oestradiol levels and therefore transition later into menopause.'\n\nThey added that more green space has been linked with a lower risk of depression, which is itself linked to starting the menopause at a younger age. Pollution had little effect, the team added.\n\nMenopause is the time when women stop releasing eggs from their ovaries and become naturally infertile \u2013 usually because they're reaching old age.\n\nIt usually happens between the ages of 45 and 55 and, although natural, can have unpleasant side effects such as hot flushes, night sweats, vaginal dryness and a low sex drive, sleep problems and mood problems or anxiety.\n\nThe symptoms may begin before a woman's periods actually stop and continue for years afterwards.\n\nDr Triebner and his colleagues said starting the menopause later was tied to a longer life expectancy and a lower risk of dying from heart disease or getting osteoporosis.\n\nThey acknowledged that women living in greener areas may be wealthier and therefore in better general health.\n\nIn the study they used satellite images to give each woman a score based on how green the area around their house was \u2013 the participants lived in Spain, France, Germany, Belgium, the UK, Sweden, Estonia, Iceland and Norway.\n\nThese scores were compared with the age at which the women started natural menopause, defined by having not had a period for 12 months.\n\nOther factors believed to affect the timing of the end of menstruation included a woman's weight, whether she smoked, how much exercise she did and whether she took the Pill when she was younger.\n\nA study by the University of Dalhousie in Canada found women who work night shifts were at least nine per cent more likely to go through an early menopause.\n\nIn a paper published in March they suggested this was because an erratic sleep pattern could reduce oestrogen levels and disrupt the function of the ovaries.\n\nAnother study, published in June by the University of Modena in Italy, showed breathing in car exhaust fumes could shorten a woman's fertility and bring on early menopause.\n\nPollutants such as nitrogen dioxide could reduce women's levels of anti-Mullerian hormone which are lower in those who have fewer eggs left so are less fertile.\n\nDr Triebner and his colleagues published their work in the journal Environment International.", "description": "Researchers from across Europe, led by the University of Bergen in Norway, looked at medical records for nearly 2,000 women to find a difference of up to 1.4 years between menopause ages.", "authors": ["Sam Blanchard Senior Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/08/30/17/17882466-0-image-a-6_1567182227762.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
