It\u2019s not a stadium announcement (Picture: NIKOLAY DOYCHINOV/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nI\u2019m disappointed, disgusted\u2026 but in no way surprised by the racism displayed by the Bulgarian fans towards England in the Euro 2020 qualifier on Monday.\n\nYou can\u2019t be shocked by racism in football anymore. It\u2019s the norm. It\u2019s ingrained in our favourite sport.\n\nIt was a matter of when, not if, a game would finally be stopped because of racism, whether it was in this country or on foreign shores.\n\nThe current UEFA protocols \u2013 that I presume are meant to protect players from any continued abuse, be it physical or verbal \u2013 have left me perplexed. I ask: do they really want to stamp racism out of the beautiful game?\n\nZero tolerance is not displaying a banner. It is not a photo opportunity. It\u2019s not a stadium announcement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe contempt shown by one man holding up a \u2018No Respect\u2019 hoodie shows you how much impact they have. It was essentially two fingers being held up to UEFA and what they currently have in place to try and deal with this.\n\nWhat is a partial stadium closure? I\u2019ll tell you what it means. It means the perpetrators get to sit in a different seat or another section of the ground.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nEveryone is now demanding stronger actions, but who are we demanding that from? An organisation that stutters and bumbles its way through every time the issue of racism arises.\n\nIt\u2019s time to get tough. That includes tournament expulsions and points deductions.\n\nThere is much more work needed from UEFA. They have to shake off this lazy attitude every time racism lands at their door.\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t let what happened in Bulgaria distract from what needs to be done back home (Picture: Reuters/Carl Recine)\n\nGareth Southgate said, rightly, his players have become \u2018hardened\u2019 to racial abuse because of experiences in their own country. And let\u2019s not for one minute forget the very same abuse continues to flourish in England.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe shouldn\u2019t let what happened in Bulgaria distract from what needs to be done back home. It could just as easily have happened in England. Yes, it could. Maybe in a different shape or form, but it could.\n\nAt Kick It Out we receive reports of discrimination from all levels of the English game week in, week out. It\u2019s happening everywhere, from your local Sunday league pitches to the Premier League.\n\nWe need to face up to our own responsibilities in dealing with racism. And we all have a duty.\n\nThe burden should not be on players and managers to remove themselves from the pitch (Picture: Reuters/Carl Recine)\n\nWe must challenge hatred whenever we encounter it. We must be together on these issues or else what\u2019s the point? We must have faith that culprits will be dealt with appropriately.\n\nNobody should ever have to encounter abuse and just \u2018get on with it\u2019. That\u2019s why the three-step protocol exists. So, either use it or don\u2019t question players if they take matters into their own hands because you have failed to protect them.\n\nTo quote Gareth Southgate, the protocol offers \u2018clarity and protection\u2019 to players. But it doesn\u2019t when it\u2019s only partly enforced.\n\nThe burden should not be on players and managers to remove themselves from the pitch. They should be able to trust the officials to do their jobs properly.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf the UEFA officials had done that last night, we may have seen the match abandoned. So when people say to me was last night was progress, I say they just teased us into thinking they were doing the right thing.\n\nAnd that just isn\u2019t cutting it anymore.\n\nMORE: Bulgarian PM tells head of football to quit over racist abuse of England players\n\nMORE: Arsenal have \u2018huge responsibility\u2019 to play attractive football, says Arsene Wenger\n\nMORE: Footballers\u2019 Wives reboot in the works after Coleen Rooney and Rebekah Vardy drama \u2013 have our prayers been answered?", "description": "The match between Bulgaria and England had to be paused twice due to Bulgarian fans making racist chants and gestures.", "authors": ["Troy Townsend", "Kick It Out S Education Manager"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1175976926_1571155068.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
