She was made an OBE for services to the arts by Prince Charles in 2010, is the chancellor of Kingston University and became a British citizen in 1997.

The gammon in the audience does not know what he's talking about. Clearly.'\n\nAnother added: 'Thought that was a silly statement. The mum can speak Polish to her daughter in the house, nothing stopping her keeping her native language alive.'\n\nAnd a third, from Surrey tweeted: 'Thank you Bonnie Greer for standing up to this guy. He has no right to dismiss the feelings of foreigners in this country.\u2019\n\nAlso on the panel was Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi, Labour politician Sarah Jones, author Melanie Phillips and politics professor Anand Menon.\n\nQuestion Time is available on the BBC iPlayer after being broadcast last night\n\nFull exchange between Bonnie Greer and the audience member Audience member: 'Why is it bad to be a foreigner in this country at the moment?' Bonnie Greer: 'Excuse me?' AM: 'Your comment - you said it's bad to be a foreigner in this country at the moment.' BG: 'OK, well I'll give you an example. I have a friend who's Polish. She's lived here since about 2000. Her little girl was born here. She doesn't speak Polish to her anymore on the bus or on the Tube because people abuse her. ' Fiona Bruce: 'Let's, I'm just, I'm going to come to you Nadeem in a minute...' BG: 'Did I answer you?' AM: 'No, I still disagree with the comment.' BG: 'You disagree with what I said?' AM: 'Whether she speaks Polish to her daughter or not, that's her choice, but this\u2026 no, excuse me a sec.' BG: 'Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold, hold, hold it. She can't speak Polish to her daughter in public because she is maligned and hassled. That's why she doesn't do it. And her daughter is losing her maternal language because her mother doesn't let her, her mother's not speaking to her anymore in public.' AM: 'Well, in that comment, you're labelling the whole country as being racist.' BG: 'I didn't label anybody. I said right now, it's hard to be a foreigner.' AM: 'That's a minority, and you'll always have a minority.' BG: 'It's hard to be a foreigner in this country. You're not, I am, and I know what it's about.'\n\n** Do you know the audience member on BBC One's Question Time last night?
