Trump.\n\n\u201cI tell you one thing, you have got to hand it to the guy\u2014he is willing to call his most disastrous blunders his greatest victories,\u201d offered Colbert. \u201cCase in point: Trump\u2019s complete betrayal of our Kurdish allies after his phone call with Turkish president Erdogan. This is so despised on both sides of the aisle that the House voted to condemn Trump\u2019s actions 354-60. That is the sort of bipartisanship you only see in, like, naming a post office.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt could be argued that getting out of the endless wars in the Middle East is not a bad thing, but the way Trump did this, make no mistake who wins here: his buddy, Vladimir Putin,\u201d added Colbert, \u201cwho yesterday met with Erdogan to carve up Syria like a Christmas shawarma.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Putin and Erdogan met in Sochi on Tuesday where they announced a 10-point plan to shape Syria\u2014one that excluded the U.S., after President Trump effectively abandoned YPG forces, America\u2019s Kurdish allies in the fight against ISIS, thus allowing his authoritarian pals to run roughshod over the region.\n\nAnd Trump, as is his wont, took a victory lap of sorts following the Putin-Erdogan Syria pact\u2014even though the president\u2019s actions have cost the lives of hundreds of our Kurdish allies and led to the escape of hundreds of ISIS fighters captured by the Kurds, with some foreign-policy experts fearing it could lead to a strengthening of the terrorist group.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement validates our course of action with Turkey that only a couple of weeks ago was scorned, and now people are saying, wow, what a great outcome, congratulations,\u201d proclaimed Trump during a presser.\n\nEnter Colbert, mimicking Trump, \u201cYes, a lot of people are saying, wow, what a great outcome, congratulations\u2014specifically, Erdogan and Putin. They keep saying it to each other and giggling.\u201d", "description": "The \u201cLate Show\u201d host tore into the authoritarian-friendly POTUS for abandoning our Kurdish allies in Syria\u2014exactly what Russia\u2019s Putin and Turkey\u2019s Erdogan wanted all along.", "authors": ["Marlow Stern", "Senior Entertainment Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_20/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571880241/115242_0364_mwf8gx", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
