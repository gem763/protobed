REUTERS/Denis Balibouse/File Photo\n\nThe sale is the latest transition for Cargill, the largest privately held U.S. company, which overhauled its corporate structure in recent years following a string of disappointing results.\n\nCargill is selling its economic interest in CarVal, which has about $10 billion under management, to a group of 17 CarVal employees, including its managing principals, chief financial officer and general counsel. The companies declined to disclose the price.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sale of the company as well as all the economic interests going forward,\u201d said Jay Olson, Cargill\u2019s treasurer who also chairs CarVal\u2019s board.\n\nOlson will step down as CarVal\u2019s chairman once the deal closes in October and keep his role at Cargill, according to CarVal.\n\nCargill wants to sell CarVal because Cargill is not actively managing the business, Olson said. The sale is unrelated to challenges facing the U.S. agriculture sector, including the trade war with China that has slowed American farm exports for more than a year, he said.\n\nCargill reported a 41% drop in adjusted quarterly profit in July, citing supply disruptions stemming from the trade war and also flooding in the United States.\n\n\u201cCargill would rather, in terms of the businesses we\u2019re managing around the world, be more of a hands-on manager,\u201d Olson said.\n\nCargill founded CarVal in 1987 and made it an independent subsidiary in 2006. The agribusiness will remain a significant investor in several of CarVal\u2019s 23 funds and maintain its investments following the sale, according to CarVal.\n\nCargill has also agreed to lock up its investments in CarVal\u2019s \u201cevergreen\u201d funds, which have long-term structures, for at least four years, CarVal said. After that time, Cargill could begin the redemption process.\n\nCargill has been receiving about 20% of CarVal\u2019s revenues from investment fees. The new employee-owned partnership will receive all revenues from fees, according to CarVal.\n\n\u201cWe 100% believe in this platform,\u201d said Lucas Detor, a CarVal managing principal. \u201cWe\u2019re going all in.\u201d\n\nCargill tried to sell CarVal in recent years, but potential deals fell through.\n\nIn 2016, Cargill spun off a hedge fund arm known as Black River Asset Management and split it into three separate employee-owned firms.\n\nLouis Dreyfus Company [LOUDR.UL], one of the world\u2019s top four crop traders with Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland Co (ADM.N) and Bunge Ltd (BG.N), wound down its commodity fund manager Edesia Asset Management in 2017.", "description": "Cargill Inc [CARGIL.UL] has agreed to sell fund manager CarVal Investors, representatives for both companies said on Thursday, marking the commodity trader's exit from the asset management business.", "authors": ["Tom Polansek", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429182167&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B1XL", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
