Its hardness and purity are comparable to those of natural diamonds.\n\nDue to different processing techniques, one-carat natural diamonds are priced at about 20,000 yuan to 200,000 yuan ($2,830 to $28,306), but artificial diamonds that size are about 3,300 yuan, about one-sixth price of natural ones.\n\nThese artificial diamonds can be used for jewelry and the technology could help manufacture precision instruments in optics, lasers, radar and other fields.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/30/5db8fd9aa310cf3e97a388de.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
