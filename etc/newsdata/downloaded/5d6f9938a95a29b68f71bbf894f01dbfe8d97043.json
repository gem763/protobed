He\u2019s a fussy little man who walks briskly down a red carpet. The Russian national anthem is a clue, as are the golden Kremlin doors. Yes, it\u2019s Vladimir Putin, making an appearance on a London stage in A Very Expensive Poison, Lucy Prebble\u2019s reimagining of the story of the dissident Alexander Litvinenko\u2019s murder by Russia\u2019s FSB spy agency, based on my 2016 book.\n\nReece Shearsmith plays Mr President with dark charm. He addresses the audience directly. \u201cWhenever you tell a story you tell a lie,\u201d he begins. He offers an alternative version of Litvinenko\u2019s ghoulish killing. Instead of being poisoned with radioactive tea, Litvinenko lives out a happy family life in a cottage with his cat Yuri, Putin says. On the banks of the Volga. In the background a dog barks. The scene is marvellously chilling. Mr President is compelling. He has the best lines, including a gag about the only \u201ccrime\u201d being the cost of the theatre programme and the Old Vic makeshift loo arrangements, and we laugh with him. But does this make us complicit in his deeds? Mr President is everywhere and nowhere. He offers quips from the balcony. He appears at Litvinenko\u2019s death bed, robed in a hazmat protection suit.\n\nOnce conman leaders magic away facts, you are left with spectacle\n\nPrebble has written a play for our age. Her Mr President is an alluring populist who deftly uses humour to achieve his goals. He captures our post-modern moment in which unscrupulous off-stage politicians have realised \u2013 or perhaps rediscovered \u2013 that truth is for suckers. What matters is narrative. Tell a beguiling story, a fairytale even, with a neat slogan, and the voters will trust and reward you.\n\nOnce con man leaders magic away facts, you are left with spectacle. My favourite scene in Prebble\u2019s hugely enjoyable production comes when two British representatives \u2013 a detective and a lawyer \u2013 come to arrest Litvinenko\u2019s killers. What happens next is a piece of messy meta-genius. We see a trail of luminous polonium handprints, a dance routine in which the murderers flee, shuffling off stage right, and a poignant last waltz.\n\nIn 1998 the actual Litvinenko, an intelligence officer, met Putin, his new boss. Litvinenko had denounced his own FSB agency and accused its leadership of corruption and crimes. His reward was suspension, threats, arrest. He escaped to Britain. In exile, he believed himself safe, a British citizen. He worked for his old patron Boris Berezovsky \u2013 a beguiling figure, in Prebble\u2019s version, who bursts into oligarch song.\n\nOn stage, Putin appears in the Litvinenkos\u2019 flat, alone. He picks up an ashtray from the table and casually repositions it on the floor. It\u2019s a small and sinister gesture. Prebble\u2019s message: we, the audience, need to pay attention. Details matter, especially in dark times like ours.\n\nI had my own ashtray moment. I arrived in Moscow soon after Litvinenko\u2019s murder in November 2006 and flew on one of the planes used to transport polonium. Was the Russian state behind his death? My question led to a break-in and other intrusions. On one occasion, FSB ghosts opened the window next to our small son\u2019s bed. We lived on the 10th floor. The message seemed to be saying: take care, or your kid might tumble out.\n\nPutin began by embracing the west. Now, he wants revenge | Angus Roxburgh Read more\n\nPutin refused to extradite the murderers \u2013 Andrei Lugovoi and Dmitry Kovtun. Lugovoi became a deputy in the state Duma. He even won a medal.\n\nThe play uses evidence revealed in 2015 at a public inquiry.The hitmen were idiot villains, it emerged. They took three attempts to get their victim and visited an erotic nightclub \u2013 a Soho scene wonderfully reimagined by Prebble, with glitter ball and golden phallus. The actual killers may be far away, but A Very Expensive Poison suggests that art can be its own form of justice. The judge who presided over the public inquiry, Sir Robert Owen, concluded that Putin had \u201cprobably\u201d approved the assassination. Owen\u2019s words and Litvinenko\u2019s death-bed testimony appear in the play\u2019s moving closing section. As do the words of Theresa May, who as home secretary, at first refused an inquiry.\n\nThe Litvinenko story is many things: a horror story from the cold war transplanted to 21st-century London, a parable of Russia\u2019s dark return to authoritarianism, a tale of Jacobean revenge, gruesomely done. It is also a human drama. It is about love and loss. At its centre is Marina Litvinenko \u2013 a woman trying to navigate her way to the truth, across a treacherous sea of lies and temporising.\n\nA Very Expensive Poison, adapted by Lucy Prebble from Luke Harding\u2019s book, is at the Old Vic until 5 October\n\n\u2022 Luke Harding is a Guardian foreign correspondent", "description": "A Very Expensive Poison, about the dissident\u2019s murder, shows how Putin and the Russian state twisted the truth, says Guardian journalist Luke Harding", "authors": ["Luke Harding"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2afa044a1c5f7cf406be29737d445da0aeb6ac80/0_255_5637_3382/master/5637.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3609f16a70d99f6ff35fa9ad129c0120", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
