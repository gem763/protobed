It drew praise, and ire, for its handling of the financial crisis a decade ago, and the extraordinary measures it took subsequently to stimulate the U.S. economy have made it an important driver of financial markets. Meanwhile, President Trump has made its chairman, Jerome Powell, a household name by frequently criticizing the central bank\u2019s policies on Twitter and to the press.\n\nA movement, meanwhile, has been brewing among economists, financial-services professionals and central bankers to encourage a rethinking of the technology of currency \u2014 those paper notes we carry in our wallets \u2014 with an eye toward issuing a digital currency. Some argue that could give central banks the tools necessary to break free of chronic disinflation and persistently low or negative interest rates, while providing Americans a risk-free means to transact in a world where digital commerce constitutes a growing share of the economy.\n\n\u201cThe debate isn\u2019t about whether we need [a digital currency],\u201d Michael Bordo, an economist at Rutgers University and a fellow at the Hoover Institution, the public-policy think tank at Stanford University, told MarketWatch. \u201cIt\u2019s about how you do it.\u201d\n\nAmericans already use digital currency for most of their purchases. In 2018, they used physical dollars for just 26% of transactions, versus 62% with digital currency, which includes credit cards, debit cards and bank transfers, according to the Fed.\n\nA central-bank digital currency could work much like the mostly bank-issued digital money Americans use today, with some key differences. First, it would be backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government and, therefore, risk-free. The local bank that manages your savings account could fail at any time and the dollars in your account (beyond those insured by the FDIC) would disappear. A Fed \u201ce-dollar\u201d would persist as long as the U.S. government does.\n\nMore important, an e-dollar could pay interest. The idea that cash should pay interest dates back to monetary economist Milton Friedman, who argued in 1969 that the most efficient monetary system would be one in which cash bears interest equal to that of short-term government bonds, to encourage greater use of the dollar.\n\nIn good times, earning interest on your e-dollars would simply make everyone a little richer, but in times of crisis it could also be used to institute negative interest rates, essentially a tax on holding cash. Such a policy would likely strike Americans as governmental overreach, but, Bordo argued, the alternative is worse.\n\nCentral bank ammunition\n\nThe current economic expansion is the longest in U.S. history, but warning signs of a recession abound, including slowing economic growth and the recent inversion of the yield curve for U.S. government debt. In response, the Fed reduced interest rates in July and hinted at more cuts to come. But economists worry that the Fed will not have enough ammunition to fight the next downturn, as the central bank has typically had to cut rates by at least five percentage points to stimulate the economy following a recession.\n\nThe Fed may be forced to restart its program of \u201cquantitative easing,\u201d or the purchase of long-term government debt to push down long-term interest rates, though there is growing concern that this is an ineffective tool. Take a look at Japan, which has been mired in a decades-long economic malaise. Interest rates have been stuck near zero for almost 20 years. Despite a massive program of government bond buying that has led to the Bank of Japan\u2019s owning more than 40% of all Japanese government debt, it has still suffered four recessions over the past 20 years.\n\nThe eurozone hasn\u2019t fared much better despite imposing negative interest rates on large banks, as it\u2019s suffered two recessions since the financial crisis.\n\nBordo said the problem with negative rates in Europe and Japan is that, without a central-bank digital currency held by the public at large, those rates can only be imposed on banks, which hurts banks\u2019 ability to lend and does little to encourage the magnitude of spending needed to jolt economies back to normal levels of growth.\n\nThe U.S. economy could soon face the same situation, Bordo said. \u201cWe could be in a situation like Japan,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way things are going in the world, where growth is slowing and deflationary pressures persist, we\u2019re probably headed in that direction.\u201d\n\nHow would it work?\n\nThe Federal Reserve already issues digital dollars, but only banks can use them. They\u2019re called \u201cbank reserves,\u201d and this form of digital currency received a great deal of attention over the past decade for its role in the Fed\u2019s quantitative-easing program, with the Fed buying government bonds from banks and giving them newly created digital bank reserves in return. Banks can settle debts among themselves using this digital currency, but it never circulates in the consumer banking system.\n\nOne way the Fed could implement the e-dollar is by simply allowing any American to open an account at the Federal Reserve, where other forms of money, like a check from an employer or a deposit at a private bank, could be exchanged in e-dollars.\n\n\u201cThe only way we can transact with central-bank money today is to use reserve notes, but digital payments are now the norm,\u201d said Ousm\u00e8ne Jacques Mandeng, an economist at the London School of Economics who spent much of the past two decades working for financial institutions including Credit Suisse and UBS. \u201cIf you wanted to buy something on Amazon, you can\u2019t pay with central-bank money. Shouldn\u2019t central banks say that our money can be used in this environment? It\u2019s a very practical issue of public choice.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, an e-dollar system could be engineered so that payments are nearly instantaneous and costless, Mandeng said. This would be a major upgrade for many Americans, who now pay hefty fees for wire transfers. Newer payment services such as Venmo and Google Wallet, meanwhile, rely on automated clearing house, or ACH, exchanges that often take days to process money transfers.\n\nA concern among economists is that personal Fed banking accounts could erode private banks\u2019 profitability and, therefore, reduce the flow of credit they provide to businesses and consumers. Others argue that banks would simply change their business models, and could attract deposits by offering higher interest rates than cash would bear, or by offering discounts on loans and other services for customers who maintain a certain balance.\n\nBut given the risk that an e-dollar could significantly harm the banking system, proponents of a central-bank digital currency say the safest approach would be to allow supervised commercial banks to offer specially designated accounts for it.\n\nWhile regional Fed banks have produced research that points to significant economic benefits from a central-bank digital currency, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors declined to comment for this story. In addition, the board\u2019s public comments have revealed a skepticism on the potential benefits to consumers. In a May 2018 speech, Fed Gov. Lael Brainard said \u201cthere is no compelling demonstrated need for Fed-issued digital currency,\u201d because consumers and businesses can use private digital currency already.\n\nMeanwhile, the Fed announced a plan Aug. 5 to develop a service called FedNow to allow banks and fintech companies to offer real-time money transfers, which will create stiffer competition for the ACH system run by the bank-owned Clearing House Payments Co., thus undercutting one argument for a central-bank digital currency.\n\nFighting monopoly power\n\nFor some central banks around the world, neither convenience nor better implementation of monetary policy is the primary reason for considering the issuance of digital currency. The Swedish Riksbank, for instance, is most concerned with the rapid decline in cash usage in its domestic economy, which has been much more pronounced than in the United States. The nominal value of cash in circulation in Sweden has fallen 50% over the past decade, and cash now accounts for only 13% of Swedes\u2019 purchases, according to Hanna Armelius, senior adviser at the Riksbank.\n\nThe decline, she said, threatens to create a negative feedback loop \u2014 as fewer Swedes prefer cash, more merchants will decline it as payment \u2014 and the Riksbank does not want to find itself in a situation in which the public has no access to the central bank\u2019s currency.\n\n\u201cAt the Riksbank we would like it if [nondigital] cash continues to be in use, but we have to be prepared that the marginalization of cash will continue,\u201d she said. As private digital money plays a greater role in the economy, \u201cwe could end up in a situation where one or two companies become so dominant that they can extract monopoly rents.\u201d\n\nTodd Keister, a visiting scholar at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, echoed that concern. \u201cMonopoly power concerns are important,\u201d when thinking about central-bank digital currency, he said. \u201cThere is a natural monopoly in payment networks. What\u2019s to stop Visa V, +0.55% and Mastercard MA, -0.24% from raising their fees? Enabling an alternative for transacting digitally is really important.\u201d\n\nA wake-up call for many central bankers has been Facebook Inc.\u2019s FB, -1.79% proposed cryptocurrency, Libra. Given Facebook\u2019s scale \u2014 it claims nearly 2.5 billion users worldwide \u2014 a successful rollout of its own digital currency could give it unprecedented power over the global economy.\n\nCash usage in the United States is nowhere near as low as in Sweden, but studies suggest that it is declining, from 31% of all transactions in 2016 to 26% in 2018, with cash use most predominant in small transactions. Only 6% of purchases of more than $100 were made with cash last year, according to the Federal Reserve.\n\nThere is anecdotal evidence, meanwhile, that businesses are increasingly refusing to accept cash. State and local governments have been combating this trend with legislation forcing stores to accepting payment in cash out of fairness to the roughly 15 million Americans who don\u2019t have access to debit cards or other digital forms of money. Proponents of the e-dollar say it could offer a cheap, safe means for poorer Americans to transact in digital money while also giving businesses the freedom to refuse paper money if they find it cumbersome.\n\nAlan Blinder, former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, said in an interview with MarketWatch that maintaining a public role in currency, and constraining the monopoly power of potential issuers of digital money and current players in the payment space, is a reason for the Fed to start taking the issue seriously now. \u201cIn paper currency, the Fed has a legal monopoly \u2014 nobody else is allowed to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018counterfeiting.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBlinder added that the Fed hasn\u2019t, and won\u2019t, take the same approach to digital currency, but he said it could prevent monopoly power in the space by \u201ccoming in with its own competition,\u201d and issuing a digital currency that would serve as a \u201cpublic option\u201d in the marketplace of digital money.\n\nThe next evolution in monetary policy\n\nThis is not the first moment in American history when there was debate over whether public or private institutions should be the primary currency issuers. The Constitution grants the federal government a monopoly on issuing coined currency and to define the national monetary unit, which Congress named the \u201cdollar\u201d in 1792. But transacting in gold and silver coins is cumbersome and expensive, and so paper currency, issued by a variety of state-chartered banks, and the federally chartered Bank of the United States, quickly became the young republic\u2019s primary medium of exchange.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Second Bank of the United States in 1837, a system of \u201cfree banking\u201d developed, whereby entrepreneurs were allowed to launch banks with relative ease, as long as they met a certain standards set by the states. The system was not ideal for interstate commerce, as businesses had to keep track of the market values of the many notes in circulation, some of which were counterfeit or issued by failed or insolvent banks.\n\nRutgers economist Bordo said there are parallels between today\u2019s Wild West of digital currencies \u2014 in which increasingly popular debit and credit cards exist alongside cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and etherium \u2014 and this past era of free banking in America, a period marked by frequent financial crises and bank failures. The U.S. economy suffered from high transaction costs inherent in an economy marked by currency competition.\n\nThat system fell apart during the Civil War, with Congress passing legislation in 1864 that enabled the Treasury Department to issue paper currency, not convertible to gold or silver, that was deemed legal tender for debts public and private. The law was necessary to help finance the Union\u2019s war effort and set in motion a series of statutes that ended state-chartered banks and created a national banking system, wherein federally chartered banks distributed U.S. dollars backed by gold. U.S. dollars wouldn\u2019t be directly issued by the government until the Federal Reserve System was established in 1914, to create a single institution to manage the money supply and oversee the banking system.\n\nThe trend of more control over paper currency by the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve increased the efficiency of the U.S. economy and boosted growth, and many economists expect that a central-bank digital currency would do the same. John Barrdear and Michael Kumhof, research economists at the Bank of England, estimated that the introduction of central-bank digital currency could increase the size of a given economy by 3% \u201cdue to reductions in real interest rates, in distortionary tax rates, and in monetary transaction costs.\u201d\n\nSupercharging blockchain innovation\n\nThough central-bank digital currency as envisioned by most prominent researchers would not be a cryptocurrency, believers in blockchain technology see central-bank digital currencies helping to unleash its potential.\n\nThere has been considerable hype around the idea of using blockchain to \u201ctokenize\u201d such illiquid assets as real estate, fine art and gemstones and allow investors around the world to trade slices of these assets with the same ease as they trade stocks and bonds today.\n\n\u201cIf you accept tokenization is going to be important, then these ecosystems, like all other financial market infrastructures, will ideally have access to central bank currency for financial settlements,\u201d said the London School of Economics\u2019 Mandeng.\n\n\u201cCentral banks should be technology-neutral,\u201d he added. \u201cIf [the Fed] allows banks to settle their transactions in central-bank money, why shouldn\u2019t individuals who trade in tokenized assets have the same access to this risk-free currency?\u201d\n\nWill the e-dollar see the light of day?\n\nWhile the Federal Reserve is unlikely to issue e-dollars anytime soon, it will surely be watching digital-currency experiments undertaken by central banks around the world.\n\nThe National Bank of Cambodia is issuing its own blockchain-based digital currency to make its underdeveloped banking and payment system more efficient. The currency will be usable both on private mobile payment applications and commercial bank accounts, giving its underbanked population access to safer and more secure forms of payment. The Bank of Canada, the Bank of England and Norway\u2019s Norges Bank have also been seriously studying the issue. Sweden appears closest to adopting its digital currency, the e-krona, after its parliament set up a formal inquiry into the question.\n\nThe Riksbank\u2019s Armelius told MarketWatch that the disappearance of cash, and potential associated problems, \u201chas been a political issue for years now,\u201d and estimated that the process of implementing an e-krona \u201cwill take years, not decades.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney proposed in a speech on Aug. 23 at the Kansas City Fed\u2019s annual summit in Jackson Hole, Wyo., that central bankers around the globe could coordinate to issue a digital \u201cSynthetic Hegemonic Currency\u201d to replace the dollar as the world\u2019s reserve currency. He suggested that such a tool could eliminate problems that have resulted from the U.S. dollar\u2019s serving that purpose, from erratic capital flows in emerging-market economies to an overvaluation of the greenback that can suppress American exports.\n\nAs for the e-dollar, Blinder, the former Fed vice chairman, argued that the U.S. central bank has the power to implement a digital currency via authority already granted it by Congress. But, he added, it\u2019s unlikely to make such a move absent broader political consensus.\n\nWhat may bring about this consensus is another question, and Bordo of Rutgers pointed to U.S. history as providing a potential answer. He said that big shifts in currency policy have typically occurred \u201cwhen the politics line up\u201d due to some sort of crisis. The system of free banking was ended only because of the exigencies of the Civil War, and the Federal Reserve System was created from the wreckage of the 1907 financial crisis.\n\nAs economic storm clouds gather over the United States, and as the Federal Reserve appears to lack the ammunition to save the country from the sort of prolonged malaise that has overtaken other wealthy economies, it\u2019s possible that the next crisis-driven revolution in monetary policy is at hand.\n\n\u201cWhat makes the politics line up is the next recession,\u201d Bordo said. \u201cWhen they find that the tools they have aren\u2019t working, then the arguments will start to be listened to.\u201d\n\nMore from the Best New Ideas in Money:\n\nLeslie Albrecht: How a mix of psychotherapy and financial advice could solve your money issues once and for all\n\nIllustration by Glenn Harvey\n\nWilliam Watts: The explosion of \u2018alternative\u2019 data gives regular investors access to tools previously employed only by hedge funds", "description": "Paper bank notes are being upgraded for a digital future around the world.", "authors": ["Chris Matthews", "Markets Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HQ806_BNIM_D_ZG_20190906065300.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
