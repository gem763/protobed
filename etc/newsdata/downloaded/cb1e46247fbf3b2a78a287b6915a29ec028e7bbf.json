There has been a lot of work from a lot people, and it has been relentless,\u201d said Joseph, who took over as head coach in 2016. \u201cAll the credit to the team effort, because that is who we are, that is how we operate and\u2026 you can\u2019t acknowledge one person because it has been a real effort and having the country behind us has added to that.\u201d\n\nSouth Africa, who take on Wales in the semifinals, were simply too experienced and powerful for the Brave Blossoms on Sunday, with their suffocating defense stifling Japan\u2019s free-flowing game.\n\nHowever, it was his team\u2019s relentless effort in the final stages, despite knowing they were going out of the World Cup, that most pleased Joseph.\n\nJapan battled on, despite a couple of players carrying injuries, including props Jiwoon Koo, Keita Inagaki and flyhalf Yu Tamura.\n\n\u201cThe last five minutes of the test match epitomized this team. We were down by 20-odd... but we showed a never-die attitude and an ability to keep on getting up,\u201d said Joseph, who revealed the influential Tamura had been playing with broken ribs for much of the match.\n\n\u201cDespite us having some broken ribs in there\u2026 having that willingness to never lie down is something I am incredibly proud of as their coach. That is the sort of thing that will help us going forward.\u201d\n\nNobody has epitomized Japan\u2019s relentless energy on the field - and charm off it - than captain Michael Leitch, who cut a forlorn figure afterwards.\n\n\u201cI am not fulfilled or satisfied, just proud to be a member of this team,\u201d he said. \u201cI told (the players) to keep their chins up, we don\u2019t have to look down... for the future we have to maintain this same attitude.\u201d\n\nIf Japanese rugby can build on the success of the Brave Blossoms at this tournament, then the future could be very bright for a nation that has now won seven of their last nine World Cup matches.\n\n\u201cThe players and the brand of rugby we have been playing has always been inspiring but the difference is everyone is watching us now,\u201d said Joseph.\n\n\u201cIt is the same as we have been playing in the PNC (Pacific Nations Cup), the rugby hasn\u2019t changed but the opposition has changed, the pressure has changed and, with it being the World Cup, it has created a lot of noise for the team.\n\n\"So in that regard, for promoting the game to Japanese kids, it has been ideal. They would be the right words.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "Despite seeing his team well beaten by South Africa in their Rugby World Cup quarterfinal on Sunday, Japan coach Jamie Joseph was full of praise for his players and hoped they would be remembered as a source of inspiration throughout the country.
