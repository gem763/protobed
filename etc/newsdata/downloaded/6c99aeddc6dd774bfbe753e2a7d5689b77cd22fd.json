If it receives two consecutive strikes, it must hold a vote \u00adasking \u00adinvestors whether they want to spill the board.\n\nInvestors are unhappy with the payment of a $480,000 special cash bonus paid to chief executive Andrew Wood and a $200,000 cash to chief financial officer Tom Honan paid immediately after completing Worley's acquisition of Jacobs Engineering Group's energy, resources and chemicals business in April.\n\nWorley's remuneration committee chairman, former Brambles CEO Tom Gorman, told the meeting that the special bonuses had been paid to recognise the \"extraordinary effort and critical role\" the two men had played in completing the Jacobs acquisition.\n\nBut the Australian Shareholders' Association (ASA), which urged investors to vote against the remuneration report, said Worley should justify the takeover through \"performance rather than aspiration.\"", "description": "Investors are unhappy with bonuses paid to top executives after Worley's $4.6 billion takeover of Jacobs' energy business.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.4369%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_612%2C$y_56/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/02adecc455a941868fec6877e9bcd0eb837af51f", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
