Tentatively, not much. In a statement responding to the open letter, Facebook states it has no intention of abandoning or changing its encryption plans, and criticised the lawmakers\u2019 call for legal loopholes to be added. So, for now at least, we can still expect to see end-to-end encryption on Facebook\u2019s messaging services, but that could change if multiple countries ramp up legal pressure on Facebook.\n\nBut \u2014 requests for governmental backdoors aside \u2014 do these lawmakers have a point?\n\nWhile the letter acknowledges Facebook\u2019s vigilant removal of dangerous and illegal content, it also makes it clear that even the slightest risk should be taken seriously. And they\u2019re right \u2014 no matter how good the preventative measures are, you can\u2019t wave off trauma, child exploitation, and violence. However, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean governmental backdoors are the right solution either.\n\nThe problem here isn\u2019t with encryption per se, but rather with the precarious mix of public profiles and encrypted private messaging that this change would create. We champion apps with end-to-end encryption and strict privacy standards, but most of these apps are based on peer-to-peer communication where you must know their account name or phone number in order to send messages.\n\nThat model is very different than public social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram where most users are easily accessible. Unless you have intentionally changed your profile settings and limited the contact information on your account, most Facebook users can be found with a small amount of effort \u2014 and if you can find someone\u2019s profile, it\u2019s likely you can send them a message.\n\nIf all messages are encrypted, then it becomes much more difficult to curb abuse; makes parental controls or activity monitoring less effective; and can hamper investigations into serious crimes.\n\nNow, don\u2019t take this as me being anti-encryption or pro-governmental backdoors \u2014 I am absolutely not saying that. But the open letter has a point: Facebook needs to do more to protect its users at all possible levels, rather than just focus on messaging encryption.\n\nIncrease your Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp privacy\n\nAssuming Facebook\u2019s plans move forward unimpeded and Messenger, Instagram and WhatsApp are consolidated into a single encrypted messaging service, here are some privacy changes we recommend.\n\nFacebook\n\nYou can change your Facebook privacy settings by going to Settings > Privacy on desktop and in the mobile app. We recommend setting your post and profile visibility to \u201cfriends only;\u201d turning off message requests from people you don\u2019t know; disabling the ability for people to find your profile using search engines; and limiting how much information can be used to find you using Facebook\u2019s search.\n\nDelete as much contact information from your profile as possible, especially your phone number. You can hide this info by setting it to be \u201conly visible by me,\u201d but the data is still technically stored on Facebook that way. Deleting it is the wiser decision. You can edit your private information by going to Settings > Your Facebook Information.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to use Facebook\u2019s built-on block tools, which can be managed under Settings > Blocking.\n\nInstagram\n\nGo to your Instagram profile, then tap/click \u201cEdit Profile\u201d to open the account settings menu. In the \u201cEdit Profile\u201d tab, uncheck \u201cInclude your account when recommending similar accounts,\u201d and remove any private information you do not need to include.\n\nUnder the \u201cPrivacy and Security\u201d tab, disable \u201cShow Activity Status\u201d and \u201cAllow Sharing.\u201d The best possible way to cut out unwanted messages or contacts is to also turn on \u201cPrivate Account\u201d especially if you mostly just use Instagram to share personal photos to your friends and family.\n\nAlways block and/or report messages from accounts you don\u2019t wish to be contact by.\n\nWhatsApp\n\nGo to Settings > Account > Privacy and change every option to \u201cNobody\u201d (or to \u201conly contacts,\u201d if that\u2019s the strictest option available).\n\nAs with Facebook and Instagram, make liberal use of the block button if you need to.\n\nWhile these are helpful for all users, we strongly recommend parents implement these settings on their child\u2019s accounts. These settings are not perfect, but they\u2019re far better than the default privacy settings available on these apps, and will go a long way to helping reduce the illegal and abusive activities that lawmakers and Facebook alike want to prevent.", "description": "The battle over your online privacy could get a lot messier very soon....", "authors": ["Alan Henry", "Sara Lepley"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/rkwxnrj8oqaolsarpo0l.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
