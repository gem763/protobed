However, he is certainly not as richly rewarded as Hamilton \u2013 in fact, far from it.\n\nAt the start of the season, when still driving for Toro Rosso, the 23-year-old earned \u00a3120 000 a year. That is how much Hamilton earns every 26 hours.\n\nThere are few other sports in the world where payment to competitors in the same competition are as unequal as they are in Formula One, in which the top five highest-paid drivers (Hamilton, Sebastian Vettel, Daniel Ricciardo, Max Verstappen and Valtteri Bottas) earn nearly six times as much as the remaining 15 who race against them.\n\nHamilton and Vettel, who is on a salary of \u00a330.5 million, are in the top 30 on the Forbes list of the top-earning athletes worldwide, with Hamilton ranked 13th and Vettel 30th. That, however, includes endorsements, which are not as high in Formula One as they are in many other sports.\n\nIn terms of straight salary, Hamilton is the 11th-highest paid athlete, while Vettel comes in as the 13th-highest. What makes a comparison between the top drivers particularly interesting is the fact that the salaries do not always go hand in hand with success.\n\nRicciardo, who is said to be the third-highest earner with \u00a326.5 million, has \u201conly\u201d secured 42 points, which equates to \u00a3630 952 a point; Albon has managed 64 points at \u00a32 031 a point.\n\nAnother driver who is astonishingly \u201cpoorly paid\u201d is Ferrari\u2019s Charles Leclerc, who has exceeded expectations in his first season with Ferrari (only his second season in Formula One).\n\nThe 22-year-old driver is on \u00a32.5 million, but is third in the drivers\u2019 standings.\n\nFerrari team principal Mattio Binotto has said that Leclerc\u2019s situation will change: \u201cContracts with drivers are redrafted when there are reasons and conditions for doing so. Charles and I have invested in the future and Sebastian is happy to be with us. During the off season next year, the Ferrari duo will still be there.\u201d\n\nDocuments released by Mercedes showed that, last year, notwithstanding the high salaries and running costs of the team, they made a small profit. The team said the investment was worthwhile.\n\n\u201cFormula One makes an important contribution to the brand\u2019s status as the eighth most valuable in the world.\u201d\n\nWith Mercedes having secured six consecutive drivers\u2019 and constructors\u2019 championships, there are fears that the sport could lose its appeal, which would in turn result in less broadcasting revenue.\n\nTo try to ensure that Formula One remains competitive, the sports\u2019 governing body has agreed to a number of changes for next season \u2013 one of which will result in the team\u2019s budgets being restricted to \u00a3138 million.\n\nDrivers\u2019 salaries, salaries paid to the three best-paid executives, and the budgets for sponsorship and marketing are excluded from this figure.\n\nAnother reason teams justify high salaries is the money the drivers earn for their team in terms of prize money.\n\nA complicated formula, which includes past performances and internal team performances is used to allocate prize money per driver.\n\nAnd it is here that there seems to be a definite correlation between the salaries and the money earned, with Vettel and Hamilton leading the pack. The Briton may well have been ahead of the German had all the points his team (then McLaren) achieved in 2007 not been declared null and void over a spying incident.\n\nKimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen\u2019s high position in this ranking results from his performances in previous years, with six finishes in the top three of the drivers\u2019 standings. Similarly, Max Verstappen\u2019s reasonably \u201clow\u201d position is determined by the few seasons he has raced in the sport, as is Leclerc\u2019s non-appearance on the list.", "description": "When Lewis Hamilton passed the checkered flag in the Japanese Grand Prix a fortnight ago, he did so in third place, giving his team yet another 15 points, and in turn giving Mercedes a sixth consecutive constructors\u2019 title.", "authors": ["Peter Auf Der Heyde"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7437/39ff99bbb5a54989a972bcac5ffc3f3c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
