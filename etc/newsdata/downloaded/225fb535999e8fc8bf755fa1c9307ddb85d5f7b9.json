And walking is out of the question.\n\nA 'digitally stitched' panorama of a 30-metre stretch of Estonian road that passes through Russian territory\n\nInaccurate: According to Google Maps, the road does not pass through Russia\n\nA sign warning drivers that they are about to enter the Russian Federation - and that walking and stopping the vehicle are prohibited\n\nRadio Free Europe photographer Amos Chapple investigated and managed to take a handful of fascinating snaps of the bizarre border.\n\nHis images show how its existence is made apparent by Russian wooden territorial posts sporting two-headed eagles, signs warning people to keep at least 15 metres away from these markers and signs indicating that Russian territory is ahead and that walking is prohibited.\n\nThe biggest slice of Russian territory that the road, near the village of Popovitsa, passes through is known locally as Saatse Boot.\n\nIts origins date back to 1944.\n\nIn that year Stalin recaptured Estonia from the Nazis and the border was redrawn.\n\nBut according to Radio Free Europe, one Russian farmer opted to keep his farm in Russia, while the land around him became Estonian.\n\nAn Estonian border guard monitors traffic passing through the minuscule hotel-swimming-pool-sized slice of Russia\n\nA graphic showing the two places where Russian territory bisects the Estonian road\n\nOf course, as Estonia became a Soviet republic, at the time his decision was of no consequence. People travelled freely from one nation to the other without checks.\n\nBut when Estonia became independent in 1991, this one square kilometre of Russian territory became a bizarre border blip.\n\nThe Kremlin permitted Estonians to trundle through it, but not to stop.\n\nThe \u2018Boot\u2019 and the minuscule triangular section of Russia to the north that the road bisects \u2013 which is only about the size of a swimming pool \u2013 are constantly monitored by Estonian and Russian border guards.\n\nThey have inevitably become tourist attractions - the smaller one in spite of the fact that it's not indicated on Google Maps - but Mr Chapple warns that the guards strictly enforce the rules about stopping and won\u2019t hesitate to issue fines, so leaping out for a selfie would not be a wise move.\n\nIndeed, linger too long and guns are likely to be drawn.\n\nBorder guards keep watch on the slice of Russia known as 'the Boot'\n\nSigns warn passers-by to keep at least 15 metres away from the Russian markers at the border\n\nMr Chapple, who\u2019s from New Zealand, told MailOnline Travel: \u2018I think it\u2019s fascinating. The history behind it, and the situation now. When you\u2019re driving through that lonely forest you know you\u2019re being watched, but you can\u2019t see anyone. It gives the place a really spooky vibe. If it was a film there would be some tense string music playing under the sound of your wheels on the gravel.\n\n\u2018The vibe in general in the area is just a sense of heightened security, but it\u2019s very low key. At one stage I drove through the \u201cboot\u201d several times hoping to spot another Russian border guard.\n\n'After I\u2019d arrived back in Estonian territory an apparently civilian car swung in behind me then suddenly flashed police lights and pulled me over.\n\n\u2018Then a forest-green ute pulled out of the forest and I spent several minutes having my documents checked, and being asked questions about why I\u2019d driven through so many times. At the end of it I asked \u201cso is everything ok\u201d and the Estonian border guard told me \u201cyou didn\u2019t stop (inside the boot) so you\u2019re ok\u201d. The really amazing thing was that after I drove away, I stopped maybe 300 metres down the road and turned back to drive through the boot one last time before charging back to Riga for my flight home.\n\n\u2018After I made the U-turn I expected to see the cops still there filling out paperwork but both cars had just vanished. It was impressive in a kinda spy-film way.\u2019\n\nIn his book The Atlas of Unusual Borders, author Zoran Nikolic notes that in 2008 a road was built that circumnavigates the triangular portion of Russia, but it's a 12-mile diversion.", "description": "Radio Free Europe photographer Amos Chapple, from New Zealand, investigated and managed to snap a handful of fascinating snaps of the bizarre border.", "authors": ["Ted Thornhill", "Mailonline Travel Editor"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/14/19743084-0-image-a-44_1571147082896.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
