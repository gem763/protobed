(Photo: Eric Risberg, AP)\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 A widely used agricultural pesticide that California environmental officials have said has been linked to brain damage in children will be banned after next year under an agreement reached with the manufacturer, state officials announced Wednesday.\n\nUnder the deal, all California sales of chlorpyrifos will end on Feb. 6, 2020, and farmers will have until the end of 2020 to exhaust their supplies.\n\nThe pesticide is used on numerous crops in the nation\u2019s largest agriculture-producing state \u2013 including alfalfa, almonds, citrus, cotton, grapes and walnuts.\n\nState regulators have said chlorpyrifos has been linked to health defects in children, including brain impairment, and to illnesses in others with compromised immune systems.\n\n\u201cFor years, environmental justice advocates have fought to get the harmful pesticide chlorpyrifos out of our communities,\u201d Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement after the deal was announced.\n\nOfficials: Doctor known as 'the Candy Man' faces charges for giving out thousands of opioid doses\n\nHe added: \u201cThanks to their tenacity and the work of countless others, this will now occur faster than originally envisioned. This is a big win for children, workers and public health in California.\u201d\n\nThe president of the California Citrus Association, which represents about 5,000 growers, said in an interview that he believes the risks were not as great as the state made them out to be.\n\n\u201cWe really thought the exposure assessments and risks were just inflated and it wasn\u2019t a true characterization of the protections that were already in place,\u201d said Casey Creamer.\n\nCreamer added he appreciated that officials have agreed to budget $5.6 million to help pesticide manufacturers develop a safer alternative to chlorpyrifos.\n\n\u201cBut just so you\u2019re aware, that\u2019s what agriculture does every day, we\u2019re always looking for new products, safer products that are effective,\u201d he said.\n\nNASA's first female launch director: She'll lead countdowns during Artemis missions to the moon\n\nWhen California announced earlier this year it was moving toward banning the pesticide, the state\u2019s environmental secretary, Jared Blumenfeld, said it was doing so because the federal government was allowing it to remain on the market.\n\n\u201cThe swift end to the sale of chlorpyrifos protects vulnerable communities by taking a harmful pesticide off the market,\u201d Blumenfeld said after Wednesday\u2019s announcement.\n\nThe Obama administration announced in 2015 that it would ban chlorpyrifos after scientific studies funded in part by the federal Environmental Protection Agency showed the potential for brain damage in children. After President Donald Trump was elected, the EPA reversed that ban, questioning the studies\u2019 validity.\n\nHawaii and New York are already phasing in chlorpyrifos bans.\n\nIn this Wednesday, June 13, 2018, file photo, Hawaii lawmakers applaud in Honolulu after Hawaii Gov.

These new, novel requirements have made it virtually impossible for growers to use this important tool in their state,\u201d Corteva said.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2019/10/10/chlorpyrifos-banned-california-pesticide-linked-brain-damage/3928655002/", "description": "\"This is a big win for children, workers and public health in California,\u201d said California Gov.
