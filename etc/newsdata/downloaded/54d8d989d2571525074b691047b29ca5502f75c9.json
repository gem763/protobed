The Ministry of Justice must implement its new reforms without delay.\u201d\n\nAn attacker who slipped through the net was Leroy Campbell, 57, who was released from prison four months prior to raping and murdering nurse Lisa Skidmore, 37, in her West Midlands home in November 2016.\n\nHe had been watching her for weeks - after chillingly telling his probation officer that he \u2018felt like raping\u2019 someone again.\n\nMarvyn Iheanacho, 41, flew into a violent rage and beat his girlfriend\u2019s son, five, to death after the youngster lost his shoe in a South London park.\n\nHe had a catalogue of convictions for violence.", "description": "A 63% increase in homicides by ex-inmates since 2015 has prompted criticism of the probation service", "authors": ["Pippa Crerar", "Image", "Getty Images", "Mirrorpix"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20465085.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Inside-HMP-Berwyn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
