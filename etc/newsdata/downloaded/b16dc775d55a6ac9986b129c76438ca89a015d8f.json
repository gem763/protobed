Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has surpassed Joe Biden (D) in the current Real Clear Politics average, marking the first time Biden has lost his lead since announcing his presidential bid.\n\nThe current Real Clear Politics average shows Warren narrowly edging out Biden with 26.6 percent support to Biden\u2019s 26.4 percent support. The change follows weeks of Warren slowly gaining on Biden in both national and early primary state polls. Both candidates hold a double-digit lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who is currently averaging 14.6 percent.\n\nThe RCP average also reflects Sen.
