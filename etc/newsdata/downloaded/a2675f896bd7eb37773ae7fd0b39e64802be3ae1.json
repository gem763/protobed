The documents note that the family's attorneys had been eligible for 36.6% of the settlement.\n\nA verbal settlement was reached in June between the Clark family and the city, reports CBS Sacramento.\n\nClark's family initially sought $20 million through a federal civil rights lawsuit against Sacramento and the two officers who gunned him down. Clark's parents and grandparents haven't settled their claims.\n\nCounty and state authorities declined to file charges against the two officers who shot Clark.\n\nThe officers said they thought Clark had a gun while he ran from police during a vandalism investigation. Investigators found only a cellphone after the officers shot him multiple times.\n\n\"This is a complex case that at its core involves a lawful use of force by Sacramento Police Department officers,\" City Attorney Susana Alcala Wood said in a statement to the Bee. \"In this case, the city of Sacramento has determined that this partial resolution of the lawsuits filed on behalf of Mr. Clark's family is in the best interest of our community\" in part because it avoids potentially lengthy and expensive litigation.\n\nShe said city officials believe aiding the children \"will mark another step in the ongoing healing of our community from a tragic event.\"", "description": "Unarmed black man was shot dead by cops in grandparents' backyard, prompting widespread protests; parents' and grandparents' claims in $20 million suit still pending", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/03/21/b425f8d9-6424-4483-9293-240382300330/thumbnail/1200x630/0aec1015f565fd6a3e5635a96b8ca126/stephan-clark.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
