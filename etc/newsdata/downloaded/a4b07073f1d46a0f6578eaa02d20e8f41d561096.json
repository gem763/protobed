The loud, capacity crowd was helpful, and the win gave them the inside track in the American Athletic East.\n\n\u201cThere was a different energy, even on our sideline,\u201d Fickell said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why - because it\u2019s a big game, because we\u2019re playing well - but there was something a little bit different.\u201d\n\nThe impressive win over the two-time AAC champs moved Cincinnati (4-1, 1-0) back into the rankings for the first time this season, checking in at No. 25. The Friday game gave them extra time to enjoy their big moment. Now it\u2019s off to Houston (2-3, 0-1) to face a rebuilding team going through a change at quarterback.\n\nThe Cougars switched to sophomore quarterback Clayton Tune in their last game, a 46-25 loss at North Texas. He was 16 of 20 for 124 yards and a touchdown, and he ran for 100 yards. Tune didn\u2019t have a turnover and overcame a sore right hamstring.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m expecting him to continue to get better,\u201d Houston coach Dana Holgorsen said. \u201cI thought it was a really good opening start for him. His mindset has been really good, and I think he\u2019s going to be pretty fired up to play the home game here Saturday.\u201d\n\nSome things to watch at TDECU Stadium:\n\nHOMECOMING\n\nThe Cougars are playing their first game in 35 days at TDECU Stadium and only their second this season. They had a bye after their win at North Texas on Sept. 28. They\u2019ve lost games against Oklahoma, Washington State and Tulane. The Cougars won their other home game, 37-17 over Prairie View A&M.;\n\nTUNE VS. BEARCAT\u2019S SECONDARY\n\nCincinnati picked off UCF\u2019s Dillon Gabriel three times, returning one of the interceptions for a touchdown, as the defense led the way. Tune started the final two games last season and moved back into the role when D\u2019Eriq King decided to redshirt. Tune avoided turnovers against North Texas, but will be facing one of the AAC\u2019s top defenses Saturday. Also, he\u2019s missing second-leading receiver Keith Corbin, who also has decided to take a redshirt season.\n\nHELP ON RUN\n\nWith Tune easing into the starting role, the Cougars relied on senior running back Patrick Carr in their win at North Texas. He ran for three touchdowns and matched his career high with 139 yards rushing, including a 68-yard touchdown on the opening drive.\n\nFULL SPEED AHEAD\n\nMichael Warren II ran for 133 yards and had a key 60-yard run during the Bearcats\u2019 rally in the second half against UCF. He\u2019ll be facing a defense that\u2019s among the worst in the AAC at stopping the run, allowing 178.8 yards per game.\n\nAGAINST THE BEST\n\nThe Cougars are 5-1 against ranked opponents at TDECU Stadium, which opened in 2014, knocking off then-No. 17 USF last season. The Cougars are 36-98-5 all-time against ranked teams.\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Kristie Rieken in Houston contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: http://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Cincinnati coach Luke Fickell noticed his Bearcats displayed an increased energy level against UFC that was missing in their first three games.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Kay"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/04/ucf_cincinnati_football_13882_c0-159-3823-2389_s1200x700.jpg?837af88c2386b6e8e6be9b546f5b5b10fe4832f0", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
