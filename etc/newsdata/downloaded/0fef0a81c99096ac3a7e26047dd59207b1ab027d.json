The staging in Doha did the sport absolutely no favours.\n\nAnd a week later, the three matches at the Rugby World Cup were cancelled due to a typhoon hitting the country.\n\n(Image: Mike Egerton/PA Wire)\n\nAgain, some have argued this has reflected badly on the sport, although I cannot agree with this sentiment.\n\nAll of this has made me reflect on how sports are spread as far across the globe as possible, and the huge responsibility world governing bodies have in this process.\n\nDespite a big cheque, we have to admit that staging the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Doha was an enormous mistake by the IAAF. They can blame regionalised issues, TV scheduling etc.\n\n(Image: Cameron Spencer/Getty Images)\n\nBut it is their job to protect and grow athletics across the world and this was an abject failure. What happened in Doha has harmed athletics and it desperately needs the Tokyo Olympics to come to its rescue.\n\nBut the events in Japan with the typhoon shouldn\u2019t be compared to this. The Japanese have been incredible hosts and the energy around the whole tournament has been wonderful to see; with Japan\u2019s own brilliant performances adding to this.\n\nThe World Cup in Japan has been a brilliant move by World Rugby. It has shown that the game is striving and thriving outside of the traditional rugby nations and will give hope to other nations that they can develop the game as fast as the Japanese. The typhoon is unfortunate but was a risk worth taking for the long-term benefit of rugby.\n\nTwo very different decisions in choosing Doha and Tokyo and the responsibility behind both decisions was massive.\n\nAll sports are competing harder than ever for global viewers and so, it is time that governing bodies used a long-term viewpoint on every major decision they make.\n\nAnything short of that is doing their sport a grand disservice.", "description": "SAM QUEK COLUMN: It was heart-breaking to see a virtually empty stadium as the best athletes in the world were competing", "authors": ["Sam Quek", "Image", "Mike Egerton Pa Wire", "Cameron Spencer Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20574104.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_IAAF-World-Athletics-Championships-2019-Day-Three-Khalifa-International-Stadium.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
