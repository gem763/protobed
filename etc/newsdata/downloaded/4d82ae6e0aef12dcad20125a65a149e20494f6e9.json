Its projections show it has little hope of reaching it for years to come.\n\nMarkets' inflation outlook initially rose on the September stimulus pledge, but they have now fallen on expectations growth will slow further.\n\nDe Guindos said part of the solution would be creating a sizeable and agile centralized fiscal capacity in the euro zone, which should play a more substantive role than usual in boosting the euro zone economy.\n\n\"A dedicated centralized fiscal capacity would not interfere with domestic policy,\" de Guindos said in Madrid. \"By focusing on common area-wide stabilization, it need not affect national fiscal space but rather provide an additional layer.\"", "description": "ECB must fight specter of `Japanification': de Guindos, Rehn", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF920JZ_L.jpg"}
