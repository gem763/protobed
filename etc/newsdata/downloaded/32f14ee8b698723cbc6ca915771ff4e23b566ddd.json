The MTR Corp. provided only limited train service Monday and planned to close all stations for repairs at 6 p.m., halting all lines except direct routes to the airport on Saturday for the first time since 2007.\n\nA teenage demonstrator was shot and wounded during a harrowing scuffle with police Friday. Local media including the South China Morning Post also reported a man was dragged from his taxi and seriously beaten after apparently plowing into a crowd of protesters.\n\nThrough periods of torrential rain Sunday, police battled with protesters who occupied streets, vandalized property and targeted businesses with links to the mainland. Some demonstrators reportedly gathered outside the People\u2019s Liberation Army downtown barracks for the first time.\n\n\u201cFrom the huge turnout today you can see people aren\u2019t abandoning us and the movement,\u201d said a 17-year-old protester who gave his name as Rocky, wearing all black and a mask on his face. \u201cHong Kong people would only be angrier and more united if she rolled out more measures under the emergency law.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, activists circulated calls for fresh protests across 18 districts at 3 p.m. \u201cHong Kong people, fight to the end,\u201d read one notice spread on social media.\n\nThe increased violence showed that emergency law did little to deter protesters fighting for greater political freedoms, including the right to choose and elect their own leaders. That leaves Lam and her backers in Beijing with a difficult choice: Either take more drastic steps that could further erode Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy from China and prompt a backlash, or come up with a political solution that is acceptable to most demonstrators.\n\n\u201cThe government started a very bad and dangerous precedent in invoking the Emergency Regulations Ordinance to enact this anti-mask law,\u201d said Eric Cheung, a law lecturer at the University of Hong Kong and a member of the committee that elects the city\u2019s leader. \u201cThere is growing distrust against the government, against the police.\u201d\n\nAlmost four months of growing discontent have taken their toll on the tourism and the retail industries, driving the city\u2019s $360 billion economy toward recession. Financial Secretary Paul Chan warned in the Global Times last month that while Hong Kong likely entered a technical recession in the third quarter, the performance of the fourth will depend on whether the city can quell the unrest.\n\nTourism from China declined 42% in August as the value of retail sales fell by almost a quarter. Luxury goods such as jewelry and watches are common purchases by mainland tourists, and the value of those sales slid by almost half. Some smaller store owners have closed down: In Hong Kong\u2019s usually bustling Causeway Bay shopping district, one in 10 stores now stand empty, according to data from real estate agency Midland IC&I Ltd.\n\nProtesters initially hit the streets in June to protest a bill that would\u2019ve allowed extraditions to mainland China. While Lam finally withdrew the proposal in September, the protests have since expanded to include calls for an independent inquiry into police violence and greater democratic accountability in the former British colony. The protests have become almost daily events with regular violent clashes between activists and police.\n\nShot and Injured\n\n\u201cPublic safety has been jeopardized and the public order of the whole city is being pushed to the verge of a very dangerous situation,\u201d the police said in a statement early Monday. \u201cPolice appeal to the public to report illegal acts and join hands to maintain public order.\u201d\n\nA 14-year-old boy was shot and injured Friday night during a scuffle between a plainclothes police officer and demonstrators who had attacked his car. Just days earlier, police shot and injured an 18-year-old man who had attacked them during the National Day protests.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Hong Kong suffered one of its most violent weekends since anti-China protests began in June, with demonstrators paralyzing large swaths of the financial hub after leader Carrie Lam imposed emergency rule for the first time in more than half a century to ban face masks.On a holiday weekend", "authors": ["Stanley James", "Alfred Liu", "Denise Wee"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_eHcZb3F2.aZ5qDDjx0KTQ--~B/aD0xMzM0O3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/996e5733df74ec4a7b8b3355ddedab35", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
