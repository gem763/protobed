The ad was unveiled in Manhattan last week by Portland-based clothing company Dhvani.\n\n#StandForSomething\n\n\n\nWe have some big news to share with you. pic.twitter.com/VTcm8AoW5I \u2014 DHVANI (@DhvaniWear) October 15, 2019\n\nDhvani called the ad \u201cmetaphorical,\u201d adding on Twitter that it \u201cdoes NOT and will NEVER condone violence of ANY KIND.\u201d It\u2019s intended to \u201cartistically express the frustrations we believe many women share,\u201d the statement added.\n\nSpecifically, it\u2019s an attack on the Trump administration\u2019s blocking federal funds to Planned Parenthood health providers who refer patients for abortions, Dhvani CEO and founder Avi Brown told The Associated Press.\n\n\u201cWe are on the right side of history,\u201d Brown declared. \u201cThe billboard is an expression of our First Amendment right. Its art is a symbol ... This is about taking our country back.\u201d\n\nOther ads in the Dhvani campaign show clothing models taping Trump\u2019s mouth \u2014 a reference to the Trump administration\u2019s gag rule blocking reproductive health care information.\n\n\u201cHe unilaterally has created a gag rule that you cannot refer patients with reproductive information about abortion, sex ed, and contraception,\u201d Brown told AP. \u201cHe\u2019s gagging doctors and nurses, and telling them what they can and cannot tell patients.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is about giving a voice to women,\u201d Brown told The Washington Post. \u201cOur intent is for our brand to stand for progressive change in the face of what we perceive to be steps backwards in the evolution of our country.\u201d\n\nThe model in the Times Square ad is Michal Mesa, a Marine Corps vet and middle school teacher, according to Brown.\n\nThe campaign has elicited widespread support \u2014 and fury \u2014 on social media.\n\nOne of the most beautiful things about America is that we are all free to make our own choices.

Since you had time to thoroughly cover a stupid and tasteless meme seen by 8 people with incredible outrage, I figured you should dedicate the same time and outrage to THIS BILLBOARD IN TIMES SQUARE you hypocrites!\n\nUnless of course you\u2019re just full of shit. pic.twitter.com/fsEF6ClRuv \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 18, 2019\n\nHe was referring in his tweet to previous coverage of a graphic video, played recently during a conference at Trump\u2019s Miami golf resort, depicting a fake Trump stabbing and shooting members of the media and political opponents.\n\nRecent #Dhvani ad displayed in Times Square.
