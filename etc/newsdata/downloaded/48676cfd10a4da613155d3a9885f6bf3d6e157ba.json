Any future programming changes we are considering do not involve her,' said Fox News\n\nNo one ever mentions fear: There is no plan for Megyn to return to Fox News, though she has been free to take an on-air job even though she was paid out in full for her three-year, $69 million contract\n\nThere is no plan for Kelly to return to Fox News at this time, but she has long had a friend in the network's new president, Lachlan Murdoch.\n\nHe was asked about his former employee at The New York Times' Dealbook conference around the time of her exit negotiations with NBC, and had nothing but praise.\n\n'I'm a big fan of Megyn's. We didn't want her to leave Fox,' said Murdoch.\n\nHe then stressed that Kelly would not be making a return to the network.\n\n'I'm very happy with our current lineup on Fox News and we won't be making any changes there,' said Murdoch.\n\nWhen asked if there was any chance Kelly might find a new job after the 'damage' that was caused by her acrimonious split with NBC, Murdoch said: 'I hope she does because she's very talented.'\n\nKelly is making her return just as she is making news in Hollywood thanks to Charlize Theron's performance as the news host in the upcoming film Bombshell.\n\nThe film had its first screening this week and already critics are predicting a third Oscar nomination for Theron, who previously won the Best Actress trophy for her work in Monster.\n\nOther Fox News alum featured in the film include Gretchen Carlson (played by Nicole Kidman), Roger Aisles (played by John Lithgow) and Judge Jeanine Pirro (played by Alanna Ubach).\n\nOr how the world can seem so vast: Megyn has long had a friend in the network's new president, Lachlan Murdoch\n\nOn a journey: 'I'm a big fan of Megyn's. We didn't want her to leave Fox,' said Murdoch last yeara round the same time Kelly was exiting NBC\n\nTo the past: 'I'm very happy with our current lineup on Fox News and we won't be making any changes there,' said Murdoch\n\nKelly left NBC with few friends after adopting a scorched earth policy in her exit with NBC, multiple sources told DailyMail.com at that time.\n\n'It's all out war in negotiations between Megyn and NBC,' said one source close to Kelly.\n\nThe proceedings, which ended with Kelly taking home the full value of her $69 million, three-year contract, left some NBC executives sick to their stomach.\n\n'She needs to accept that she is done at NBC and leave. We've already paid her the equivalent of a Powerball win so it's not like she struggling to pay the bills,' said one executive.\n\n'Have some dignity Megyn and move on.'\n\nSomewhere down this road: It was Carlson who took over for Kelly when she left Fox News, and within a few months he found himself the star of the network's primetime line-up (Carlson and Kelly in 2016 abiove)\n\nI know someone's waiting: Kelly is making her return just as she is making news in Hollywood thanks to Charlize Theron's performance as the news host in the upcoming film Bombshell\n\nYears of dreams just can't be wrong: Farrow was largely positive about Kelly and her decision to report on his work while at NBC in his new book (Kelly with husband Doug Brunt and Farrow at the 2017 Time Gala)\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a Arms will open wide, I'll be safe and wanted: In early exit discussions with NBC, Kelly had actually requested an additional $10 million revealed sources at the time\n\nIn early discussions, Kelly had actually requested an additional $10 million revealed sources at the time.\n\nAnd she was ready to go after executives at the network if she did not get what she wanted in her exit deal.\n\n'She wants to tear the place down now that she's out and her team is telling everyone that she won't be happy unless others are out with her,' said a source close to Kelly.\n\n'She believes that she has information that could do serious damage to NBC News and with her track record of delivering the death blow to Roger Ailes' career she's not afraid to use the information to her advantage.'\n\nAs for her reason why, the source points to the coverage of her blackface scandal across the network's major television platforms in the days after the scandal.\n\n'She feels that there is no way so many minutes of programming would be dedicated to her scandal unless it was sanctioned by the top of NBC News or even higher - NBC Universal or Comcast. So now she wants them to pay,' said the first source.\n\n'NBC jumped on the 'blackface' comments as a way to push her out the door. They wanted her gone and this was the way to do it. There's no way so many NBC talent or shows would go on the attack unless it was officially sanctioned.'", "description": "Photographs obtained exclusively by DailyMail.com show Megyn Kelly arriving at Penn Station in Manhattan to catch an Amtrak train down to Washington DC", "authors": ["Chris Spargo For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/19/19802362-0-image-a-65_1571251848400.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
