The liquid in question is kava, which is a mixture of water and the crushed root of the kava plant.\n\n\"You have to drink it all in one go..... your mouth and tongue will start to go numb,\" explains Dr Vincent Lebot, a world-leading kava expert. Originally from France, he's lived in Vanuatu for decades. We ask what else will happen. \"Not much,\" he chuckles.\n\nThere's a light above the bar's front gate, telling customers there's kava in the house. When the day's limited supply has run out, the light will be switched off.\n\nThe bar, or nakamal, is called Last Flight - thanks to its location behind the country's main airport. It's popular with workmen in overalls and heavy boots and has the atmosphere of a very quiet beer garden.\n\nBut there is no alcohol for sale here, just kava. Drinkers down it in one, sometimes swishing their mouths out with water to help cleanse the taste, and then they spit. Proponents say the drink reduces anxiety, helps with sleep, and can even leave users feeling mildly euphoric. Critics say it is dangerous, and it is banned in the European Union.\n\nImage copyright Chris Morgan/ BBC Image caption Dr Vincent Lebot works for Vanuatu's agriculture ministry\n\n\"Kava is a very sacred drink across the Pacific,\" explains Dr Lebot. In Vanuatu, it was traditionally taken by chiefs at gatherings, during discussions of local affairs. It would be drunk out of a coconut shell. \"Chiefs would drink it so they could communicate with their ancestors,\" he says.\n\nBut recently, its use has been democratised. Most families in Vanuatu are familiar with kava and grow it outside their homes. While it was once forbidden for women to drink it, today in the capital Port Vila, it's becoming more common, though some women in rural areas still steer clear.\n\nDr Lebot is hoping that the unusual tasting, sour, clay-coloured liquid might have global appeal, and could provide Vanuatu with a much needed revenue stream.\n\nKava exports have been tried before, but it didn't end as planned. Dr Lebot explains that kava is now banned in the EU, after extracts became briefly popular in supplement form, but were declared unsafe. Dr Lebot insists that when prepared properly, when the dried root is ground up into a paste and mixed with liquid, it is \"perfectly safe\".\n\nHe points to the kava bars that have recently popped up in some of New York's hippest neighbourhoods. So could it really have global appeal?\n\nOne of the issues facing Vanuatu, in its desire to professionalise the kava industry, is that farming of the plant is done on an ad-hoc basis.\n\nImage copyright Chris Morgan/BBC Image caption Kava root is processed by hand by lots of independent growers\n\nDan McGarry, a Canadian who runs the local newspaper - and a kava fan - explains that in Pentecost Island, where much of the supply is grown, people have \"little more than machetes\" to cultivate the plant. He says that following a recent cyclone in neighbouring Fiji, demand for Vanuatu's supply has gone up and kava prices have increased.\n\n\"The popularity of kava has had quite the impact on the rural economies here,\" he says. \"You have situations where locals are chartering planes to bring it down to Port Vila. You have people going to car dealerships with bundles of cash and buying brand new trucks.\"\n\nBut Mr McGarry says that this has also led to some intimidation and \"cartel-like behaviour\" as larger growers try to control the price.\n\nGlobal Trade\n\nMore from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade:\n\nAnne Pakoa, a community leader in Vanuatu also has concerns. \"You have situations where kava is destroying families. Women are drinking it too, and some of the kava bars have become hubs for prostitution. It causes lethargy, dry skin, and when people drink too much they can lose the use of their limbs while under the influence.\"\n\nMs Pakoa says that there are even instances where families have left children unattended to go and drink kava, and the family home has caught fire. \"Kava causes problems now. Its use has gone from ceremonial to daily\", she says.\n\nWith recent moves from the Australian government to loosen import restrictions on kava, many Vanuatu farms have started to ramp up production.\n\nImage copyright Chris Morgan/BBC Image caption Nicole Paraliyu runs a kava farm, but says she has never tried the drink\n\nNicole Paraliyu shows us around the farm she manages, a large patch of reclaimed land, surrounded by dense rainforest. The farm used to produce mainly sandalwood, but has recently started growing a kava crop, too. Ms Paraliyu says farms like this have the potential to provide much needed income for the local population.\n\n\"People could stay on the islands rather than leaving to search for work overseas,\" she says.\n\nWe shelter from a tropical rainstorm near the farm's kava storeroom, packed with drying roots. There's a powerful smell, like an intense, musty ginger.\n\nSo, has she ever tried kava? \"No, not once,\" she says, laughing.\n\nBack at Dr Vincent's laboratory in the Ministry for Agriculture, he shows us rows of potions and extracts, and talks of the potential to harness some of the perceived anti-anxiety effects of the plant, and even the aspects which suppress appetites. The idea is to sell the crushed root as a powder that can be mixed with water and strained to make a drink.\n\nImage caption Dr Vincent studies the various types of kava\n\n\"It's unfair that it is illegal in some parts of the world,\" he says. \"Vanuatu can produce good kava, and it can be important for us. It's misunderstood.\"\n\nBack at Last Flight Dan McGarry agrees. \"It's hard to argue with the transformational impact it has had on the rural island economies. It can only really be regarded as a positive thing.\"", "description": "The Pacific nation of Vanuatu is hoping kava will boost exports and bring in much needed cash.", "authors": ["Sarah Treanor", "Vivienne Nunis", "Business Reporters", "Bbc News", "In Vanuatu"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/B780/production/_108667964_kava111111.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
