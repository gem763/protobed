(Jacques Boissinot/Canadian Press)\n\n'Thousands' in help\n\nLily Ryan, editor of the Journal du Pontiac, West Quebec Post and Bulletin d'Aylmer, said she's hopeful the move will help make her business more sustainable.\n\nRyan also welcomed news that the province has heeded calls from media owners to remove the recycling tax paid to municipalities for curbside recycling.\n\n\"That would mean thousands of dollars a year in help,\" Ryan said.\n\nRyan still has questions about how the aid will be administered, however \u2014 if it only applies to full-time employees, she said that won't be much help to small outlets like hers.\n\nThe federal government promised $600 million last fall for media organizations that have at least two full-time journalists, but Ryan's employees are all part-time.\n\n\"If we're eligible [for Quebec's credit] it's going to be a huge difference,\" she said.\n\nPublications struggling\n\nThe Quebec Community Newspapers Association said during a series of government hearings this summer 16 English-language newspapers in the province have closed since 1980, and the remaining publications are struggling.\n\nPatrick Duquette, president of the union at Le Droit, said the provincial tax relief is something the industry has wanted for a long time.\n\nGroupe Capitales Media, which owns Le Droit and several other Quebec newspapers, received $5 million in emergency financial aid earlier this year. Duquette said that wouldn't have been necessary if the provincial tax changes were already in place.\n\nThe province's CAQ government is also extending a digital transformation tax credit for print media companies until the end of 2023.", "description": "Print media outlets in western Quebec are welcoming a financial boost from the province aimed at helping them confront\u00a0the unprecedented\u00a0crisis facing the industry from the rise of digital competitors.", "authors": ["Cbc News"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5306953.1570071107!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/lily-ryan.JPG"}
