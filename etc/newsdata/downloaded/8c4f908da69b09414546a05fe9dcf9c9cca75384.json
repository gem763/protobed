Its light weight also makes it good for those who don\u2019t have the physical strength to hold something like an M-1A or Garand. That\u2019s an important feature in a self-defense rifle.\n\nBut lawmakers rarely understand the reality of the weapons they seek to regulated to outlaw status. Anti-gun legislators are rarely gun people. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about, so, they decide to make some stuff up.\n\nTake Rep. Shirley Jackson Lee, for example. In just the first minute of this video, she spouts so much that isn\u2019t close to right.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve held an AR-15 in my hand,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is as heavy as 10 boxes that you might be moving.\u201d\n\nThose most be empty boxes.\n\nAfter all, the AR-15 as a base model weighs around 6.5 lbs. With accessories, that weight can climb up a bit, but you\u2019re still generally looking at less than 10 lbs. So, for the sake of argument, let\u2019s say this firearm she held weighed 10 lbs. That\u2019s 10 one-pound boxes, then?\n\nOr maybe Jackson Lee is just making stuff up?\n\nAfter all, her next quote definitely suggests that.\n\n\u201c[T]he bullet that is utilized,\u201d she continues, \u201ca .50 caliber, these kinds of bullets need to be licensed and do not need to be on the streets.\u201d\n\nWell, she\u2019s wrong about .50 caliber rounds not needing to be on the streets, but that\u2019s a matter of opinion. She manages to get the actual facts wrong too, though, and that\u2019s the most egregious part of this.\n\nAfter all, the AR-15 isn\u2019t a .50 caliber weapon. While there are a handful of AR-pattern weapons chambered in a .50 caliber (.50 Beowulf), they\u2019re a tiny fraction of the overall market. The vast majority of AR-15s are chambered in .22 caliber, either .223 or 5.56 which are the same size but not the same round.\n\nThey\u2019re not even close to .50 caliber and only a complete and total moron could mistake a .223 for a .50.\n\nActually, I take that back. Not even a moron could make that mistake.\n\nWhich, of course, leads me to believe that Rep Shirley Jackson Lee is lying about having ever held such a firearm in her life. Absolutely nothing she\u2019s describing fits with the actual facts we know about AR-15s.\n\nNow, no one should be surprised by the idea that a politician might lie. It\u2019s kind of what they do. However, to so brazenly lie about facts so easily verifiable is beyond the pale. However, she knows that the mainstream media won\u2019t fact-check her. They\u2019ll allow her lies to stand and confuse the issue.\n\nYet some of us know better.\n\nIf Jackson Lee will lie on such basic facts, why should we take her word on anything else? It also means the American people should question every bit of gun legislation she wants to propose. Frankly, the people of her district need to vote her out of office. Unfortunately, as she\u2019s an NYC politician (edited to add that yes, she represents a district in Texas, but she was born in NYC. I mixed up place of birth with who she represented.), that\u2019s not likely to happen.\n\nBut her lies need to be called out, loudly and often.", "description": "Rep.
