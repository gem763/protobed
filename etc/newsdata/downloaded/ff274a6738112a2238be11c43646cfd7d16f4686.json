Once interest rates are negligible, further cuts would seem to have very little power to do anything useful.\"\n\nAustralia's A$1.95-trillion ($1.32-trillion) economy has grown for 28 years without a recession, but risks have grown in the past year, with growth ebbing, inflation lukewarm, the property market subdued and unemployment ticking up.\n\nMacfarlane's comments came after data showed only a modest increase of 0.4% in August retail spending, with economists saying more fiscal stimulus from the fiscally conservative government was needed to lift consumer spending. current era, Macfarlane said, was \"the most perplexing and difficult period for monetary policy ever\".
