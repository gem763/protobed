That\u2019s two hours ahead of the opening bell on Wall Street. Jeff\u2026\n\nThe gold sector is on the verge of generating its first sell signal since 2016.\n\nGold stocks have had an amazing run higher over the past few months. The sector has been much stronger than I anticipated. And the current rally has lasted much longer than I thought it would.\n\nBut the gold sector remains vulnerable to a sharp and swift pullback.\n\nAnd this morning, at 7:30 ET, he issued a second warning. He wrote to Market Minute readers:\n\nBuying into the gold sector right now is a mistake. You\u2019ll have a better chance to do so in the weeks ahead.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear\u2026 Gold stocks are in a new, long-term bull market. They will be higher several months from now than where they are today. But, in the short term, they\u2019re most likely headed lower.\n\nIt was an uncanny call.\n\nLook what happened to gold stocks next\u2026\n\nThe chart below is of the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (NYSEARCA:GDX). It tracks the performance of 44 top global gold mining stocks. As you can see, it fell more than 5% today.\n\nGold bullion prices are also on the retreat. Gold fell 2.2% today, from $1,553 to $1,519.\n\nAnd as we\u2019ll show you in today\u2019s dispatch, Jeff believes there\u2019ll be more of a pullback over the coming weeks.\n\nIt\u2019s not a reason to panic\u2026 or sell your gold. But it does indicate better buying opportunities ahead if you\u2019re still adding to your position.\n\nAt the Cut, we\u2019ve been bullish on gold for more than a year\u2026\n\nIn fact, the first recommendation from the Legacy team that we wrote to you about was to buy gold.\n\nThat was in August 2018. Gold was beaten down and hated. And colleagues E.B. Tucker and Dave Forest were telling their readers to get ready for a turnaround.\n\nSince then, gold is up 26%.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd gold stocks have done even better.\n\nEven after today\u2019s pullback, GDX is up 52% since our call last August.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Editor's note: This article was originally published on September 5, 2019 via Legacy Research Group.He's one of the best \"noses\" in our business\u2026Our master trader, Jeff Clark, is a long-term gold bull.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsLike the rest of us", "authors": ["Chris Lowe"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kjydFArsfc4voW35bsOqkg--~B/aD00MDA7dz03Mjg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/investorplace_417/959f2f72dd110e5148073fa33da18676", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
