FCA's Alfa Romeo registrations rose 25.9% year on year.\n\nJapan's Nissan was one of the biggest losers among major brands, with a 7.0% decline in sales.\n\nAmong premium auto brands, Audi sales rose 38.8%, topping competitors such as Mercedes-Benz and Volvo, which saw their registrations rise 9.9% and 9.3%, respectively. BMW registrations dropped 6.6%, ACEA said.\n\n(Reporting by Giulio Piovaccari; Editing by Edmund Blair)", "description": "MILAN, Oct 16 (Reuters) - European car registrations rose  14.4% in September as the market recovered from the previous  month's slump, led by robust gains...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
