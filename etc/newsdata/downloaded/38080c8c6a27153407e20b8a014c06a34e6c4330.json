Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), an ally of Trump\u2019s, a day before Mulvaney\u2019s press conference. \u201cI do know there's a lot of things that get said that aren't backed up with facts. I'm waiting for the facts to come out before I jump to any conclusions.\u201d\n\nBut others are not so kind when assessing the role Mulvaney is now playing, arguing that he finds himself in over his head as he tries to guide the White House through turbulent political waters.\n\n\u201cHe is a smart guy, a very smart guy, but he\u2019s only about 70 percent as smart as he thinks he is,\u201d said Republican strategist Terry Sullivan, who has known Mulvaney since the acting chief of staff\u2019s days in the South Carolina State Senate. \u201cThere\u2019s only one person in that entire White House that has a bigger ego than he does, but it\u2019s not by much.\u201d\n\nThe trickiness of Mulvaney\u2019s task\u2014and the difficulty he is having handling it\u2014was on full display Thursday. It was about 20 minutes into the briefing when he was asked whether he was directly involved in withholding funds from Ukraine. After riffing about the president\u2019s dislike of foreign aid, belief the U.S. shoulders too much of it in proportion to others and that the country is corrupt anyway, Mulvaney touched on the 2016 race.\n\n\u201cDid he also mention to me in the past that the corruption related to the DNC server? Absolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cNo question about that. But that\u2019s it. That\u2019s why we held up the money.\u201d\n\nAfter pillioring former State Department adviser Michael McKinley who reportedly testified he left the administration because \u201cdisturbed by the implication that foreign governments were being approached to procure negative information on political opponents,\u201d Mulvaney went in for the kill.\n\n\u201cI have news for everybody. Get over it,\u201d he advised. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be political influence in foreign policy...Elections have consequences and foreign policy is going to change from the Obama administration to the Trump administration.\u201d\n\nAs wild\u2014damning, even\u2014as the admissions may have seemed, Mulvaney actually had the intention of bringing the temperature down, with hopes of clearing the air after his name had cropped up in press reports implicating him in the Ukraine-related scandal. He wanted to \u201ctake allegations head on, and show he wasn\u2019t going into hiding,\u201d one White House official said.\n\n\u201cMight as well own it,\u201d the official added.\n\nAnd own it he did\u2014but only for part of the day.\n\nHours after the briefing, Mulvaney tried to backtrack, saying in a statement released by the White House press office: \u201cLet me be clear: there was absolutely no quid pro quo between Ukrainian military aid and any investigation into the 2016 election.\u201d He also claimed that \u201conce again, the media has decided to misconstrue my comments to advance a biased and political witch hunt against President Trump.\u201d\n\nBy that point, however, real damage had been done. Mulvaney\u2019s earlier round of comments had left some close White House allies utterly perplexed and questioning his fitness for the role.\n\n\u201cWhat is Mulvaney even talking about?\u201d Sean Hannity, a Fox News host and prominent outside adviser to Trump, said on his radio show on Thursday. \u201cI just think he's dumb, I really do. I don't even think he knows what he's talking about. That's my take on it.\u201d\n\nAnd the bad reviews came from within the Trump administration itself. Not long after Mulvaney left the briefing room, a senior Department of Justice official began telling reporters that DOJ wasn\u2019t aware that Ukraine military aid and the Justice Department's probe into the potential origins of the Russia investigation were linked. \u201cIf the White House was withholding aid in regards to the cooperation with any investigation at the Department of Justice, that is news to us,\u201d the official told Fox News.\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s personal attorneys Jay Sekulow released a brief statement that, while not directly criticizing Mulvaney or his briefing, unequivocally stated that the president\u2019s outside lawyers had nothing to do with it.\n\nTo a certain degree, Mulvaney\u2019s performance\u2014and subsequent mop-up\u2014was just another illustration of the remarkable tensions that all top White House aides have come to confront. And yet, Thursday\u2019s drama provided a unique instance of how Trump has transformed his own party and endangered those within it.\n\nFour years ago, Mulvaney was a fiscal conservative stalwart in Congress and a public Trump critic. During his 2016 congressional re-election campaign, he told an audience in his South Carolina district in the wake of the Access Hollywood tape\u2019s release, that he was supporting then-candidate Trump, \u201cdespite the fact that I think he\u2019s a terrible human being.\u201d\n\nBut, like many Republicans before and after him, Mulvaney warmed to the president when it became clear that there were opportunities for advancement for those willing to ignore the unsavory elements of Trump. First, he served as the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (which he gutted), then he became the director of the Office of Management and Budget (a title he still, technically, holds), and now he plays the role of acting chief of staff.\n\nWhen he first assumed his current post, Mulvaney seemed determined to avoid the drama that had consumed his predecessors. He opted for a less combative approach than prior chief of staff, John Kelly, who frequently butted heads with the president on a range of decisions and rankled Trump with his attempts to corral and restrict access to the impulsive president. He kept a low profile too. Indeed, his Thursday appearance at the White House briefing room was his first during his tenure as acting chief of staff.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear to me he\u2019s reading between the lines and he\u2019s trying to execute the president\u2019s policies across the board and not pushing back on what the president trying to do,\u201d said one Republican national security expert. \u201cYou could see Gen. Kelly likely pushing back on this kind of request.\u201d\n\nBut being a Trump footsoldier willing to say and do anything to please the commander-in-chief came with a cost. And in Mulvaney\u2019s case it was both the sacrificing of long held principles (the deficit and debt has ballooned under his stewardship) and, increasingly, proximity to political scandal.\n\nOn Tuesday, former Senior Director for Russian and Eurasian Affairs Fiona Hill testified to the House Intelligence Committee that former National Security Adviser John Bolton was concerned about actions by Mulvaney, Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, and European Union ambassador Gordon Sondland that circumvented the normal procedures and diplomatic channels, according to a report in The New York Times.\n\nThinking it might have legal ramifications, Bolton instructed Hill to alert the chief lawyer for the National Security Council, remarking: \u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal [Sondland and Rudy] and Mulvaney are cooking up.\u201d\n\nOn Capitol Hill, lawmakers who worked with Mulvaney\u2014and like him\u2014have watched with a mixture of concern and confusion that their former colleague may have gotten in over his head even before his appearance in the briefing room. There is chatter about whether his \u201cLet Trump Be Trump\u201d approach to the job helped create an environment in which the Ukraine shenanigans were allowed to flourish. And though they are revelling in exposing corruption at the heart of the Trump administration, even Democrats are feeling a bit torn about watching their former colleague get swept away in it all.\n\n\u201cI have worried from day one about Mick working for Trump,\u201d said Rep. John Yarmuth (D-KY), who calls Mulvaney a friend. \u201cBecause I believe in the title of that book\u2014that everything Trump touches dies. And I\u2019m just hoping he escapes with his integrity and his career intact. Mick\u2019s a very good guy, a smart guy. I just think it\u2019s unfortunate that he took that responsibility on.\u201d", "description": "The acting chief of staff had himself a day on Thursday and his critics say he\u2019s in over his head.", "authors": ["Jackie Kucinich", "Asawin Suebsaeng", "Sam Brodey", "Washington Bureau Chief", "White House Reporter", "Congressional Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1125,w_2000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571360031/191018-politics-mick-mulvaney-over-his-head-hero-3_t6oiqu", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
