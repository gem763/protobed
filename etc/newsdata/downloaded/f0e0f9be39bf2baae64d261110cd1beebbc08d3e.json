The contracts don't necessarily predict moves after the opening bell.\n\n\"While the U.S. still remains unlikely to strike a deal in the immediate future, Trump is certainly talking up markets and for the most part, he has been successful,\" said IG's Joshua Mahony, though he added that markets are growing more skeptical with each failed meeting.\n\nMr. Trump remains a major risk to the conclusion of any trade deal, said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior market analyst at London Capital Group. \"A tweet would suffice to shatter the market sentiment, again,\" she said.\n\nBusiness consultancy Accenture dropped 1.9% in premarket trading after giving a muted outlook for the year ahead in its earnings report. Facebook shares were down 1% premarket after Bloomberg reported that the U.S. Justice Department is seeking another antitrust probe.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 was up 0.7%, with the German DAX 0.5% higher and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 up 1.1%.\n\nBetter-than-expected consumer data released Thursday showed that German shoppers remained somewhat resilient in the face of a sharp slowdown in the industrial sector.\n\nAdding to the positive news, the European Central Bank said eurozone bank lending to businesses -- which is seen by economists as an indicator of economic health -- accelerated last month.\n\nMeanwhile, the ECB's most senior German official unexpectedly resigned Wednesday amid disputes over the central bank's bond-buying program, and analysts suggested the move could have an effect on the bank's decision making.\n\n\"This might open up a spot for a more dovish member to replace her, which could make any further attempts to ease policy a little easier, further down the line,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.\n\nIn the U.K., some stocks benefited from a softer pound, while others were lifted by the positive comments on U.S.-China trade, said CMC Markets analyst David Madden.\n\nIn Asia, the Nikkei climbed 0.1% after the U.S. and Japan signed a trade-enhancement agreement, which will lower agricultural tariffs in Japan, industrial tariffs in the U.S. and set new rules for digital trade.\n\nOther Asian markets were more mixed, with stocks in Shanghai down 0.9%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng up 0.4% and Korea's Kospi edged up 0.1%.\n\nIn commodities, global oil benchmark Brent crude slipped 0.1%. Gold prices slipped 0.1%.\n\nThe yield on U.S. 10-year Treasurys slipped to 1.703% from 1.732% Wednesday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.\n\nThe U.S. Commerce Department said Thursday that gross domestic product -- a broad measure of the goods and services produced across the U.S. -- was unrevised in the second quarter, although a key measure of corporate profits was revised lower. U.S. jobless claims increased slightly last week, according to the Labor Department.\n\nWrite to Max Bernhard at Max.Bernhard@dowjones.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 26, 2019 09:35 ET (13:35 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
