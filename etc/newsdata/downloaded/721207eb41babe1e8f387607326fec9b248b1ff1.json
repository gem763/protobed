The cricket team have done that in a couple of significant moments already this year and I have loved watching that.\n\n\u201cThe World Cup final was brilliant and the Ben Stokes innings was a real last stand of British resilience and, living in Yorkshire, the atmosphere at Headingley probably added to that as well.\n\n\u201cWe all love those moments, sport should do that \u2013 sport should take you away from the day-to-day and allow us to dream and allow us to be excited about things that, in the overall scheme of things, aren\u2019t important. There are far more important things, but we can bring joy to people and it is a privilege to be in a position to be able to do it.\u201d\n\nWhile Southgate believes the qualifiers are attractive fixtures for the home fans \u2013 and there is no doubt reaching Euro 2020, with the semi-finals and final to be held at Wembley, would truly be something for the country to get behind \u2013 he will not allow himself to get carried away just yet.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hugely exciting for everybody,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cI feel as if we\u2019ve started to build that excitement whenever we play now, which is fantastic. I know the level that that can go to, but I can\u2019t afford to be carried away with that, that\u2019s brilliant for everybody else to experience.\n\n\u201cSomebody\u2019s got to be in control of what we\u2019re doing and making sure we\u2019re on the right path and not too far ahead of ourselves, because we\u2019ve got a lot of improvement to do to make that a really strong possibility.\n\n\u201cBeer sales go up and everybody enjoys looking forward to it. We want that to last as long as it possibly can, but I can\u2019t live in that world of external...It\u2019s my job to get everybody there.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "England\u00a0manager Gareth Southgate believes his team can help to give the nation a feel-good factor amid an uncertain political backdrop \u2013 but insists he is not getting excited about Euro 2020 just yet.
