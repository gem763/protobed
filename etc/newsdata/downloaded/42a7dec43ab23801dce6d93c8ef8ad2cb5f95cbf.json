He said she bore down immediately on what she figured he was most concerned about, reading his shirt and promising to be his champion.\n\n\u201cWhen I got up there, she said that she is going to work on getting rid of student loan debt. I was wearing a shirt that had her picture on it and it says \u2018Hello, do you have a moment to talk about student loan debt cancellation?\u2019\u201d Mr Eliff, a 31-year-old law enforcement official with more than $70,000 in student loan debt, told The Independent, recalling the moment with the senator.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nAfter nine months of campaigning, Ms Warren now finds herself as a top contender for the Democratic nomination, and has begun to see her name on top of even Joe Biden\u2019s in polls from across the country.\n\nShe\u2019s the first Democrat so far to break that ceiling, and the rise in political fortunes for the 70-year-old has been made possible at least in part by moments just like the one with Mr Eliff. The 31-year-old is among the thousands of people to have taken a selfie with the senator this year, and says that the candidate\u2019s personal approach has all but guaranteed he will be caucusing for her come February.\n\n\u201cThe fact that she takes the time to meet with everyone tells me a lot about her. I think she cares about people. And I think people like that. Iowans appreciate the personal touch,\u201d he said. \u201cThat fact, that she waits and meets everyone, is another reason among many I endorsed her early and support her and will be caucusing for her.\u201d\n\nFor political strategists and experts, Ms Warren\u2019s pioneering of the so-called \u201cselfie line\u201d is a genius move that has helped accomplish a few different goals.\n\nFor one, the selfie lines \u2014 which Ms Warren will stick out for hours, making sure that every last person wants will get their photo with her \u2014 allow her to make a personal connection directly with voters. They also show her stamina: what unhealthy person is able to stand for hours greeting strangers day in and day out?\n\nBut, they also give Ms Warren, who makes time for the photo lines by refusing the time suck of big fundraisers with millionaires, the chance to wade in directly with her would-be constituents \u2014 who then help out by posting those same selfies all across the internet.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, selfies on Instagram have become the new yard signs. Where people see the candidate out from behind the curtain, and see that their friend or their neighbour or their family member is promoting them,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, the former deputy national press secretary for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Then those pics are shared across social networks and followers see the pics with zero mention of \u2018sponsored content.\u2019 A truly organic strategy,\u201d said Cartney McCracken, a Democratic strategist and partner at the firm Control Point Group.\n\n\n\nOf course, Ms Warren can point to more than just a well-run selfie operation for her success. From the get-go, she\u2019s cultivated a remarkably consistent political brand, releasing policy proposal after policy proposal to support a central promise she has made on the campaign: she sees the corruption permeating Washington politics, and she has a plan to fix all the problems that stem from that rot.\n\nThe former teacher-turned-bankruptcy lawyer has a personal story to tell, too. She pulls her audience in with a relatable narrative, one in which she describes her life story \u2014 a success story that has her starting in Oklahoma as the daughter of working class parents, before making her way through public universities and law school. It\u2019s a story that includes humour, failure, and, ultimately, hope.\n\nAll of that has culminated in weeks of good headlines, and a growing sense of fear on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley.\n\n\u201cWarren passes Biden in new national poll,\u201d reads one headline in Politico from late September. \u201cMark Zuckerberg says Elizabeth Warren\u2019s policies are an \u2018existential\u2019 threat in leaked Facebook audio,\u201d reads another headline, in this news outlet. \u201cWall Street Democratic donors warn the party: We\u2019ll sit out, or back Trump, if you nominate Elizabeth Warren,\u201d reads yet another headline in CNBC.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s firing on all cylinders when it comes to policy, she\u2019s doing well with fundraising, drawing large crowds and favourable press. But there\u2019s still a long way between now and the caucuses in Iowa,\u201d said Jim Manley, a longtime Democratic operative who previously worked for former Senate Majority leader Harry Reid, just before Ms Warren\u2019s campaign announced a $24.6m fundraising haul for the third quarter.\n\nAt the largest of those events Mr Manley mentioned, some 20,000 people crowded into New York City\u2019s Washington Square Park. Afterward, a line formed in the park, and Ms Warren took selfies for nearly four hours.\n\nCaroline Morganti, a 25-year-old software engineer, said she waited for two and a half hours for her moment to see Ms Warren \u2014 and saw just one person leave the line during that time.\n\nAnd, Ms Morganti says she is far from ruling out a president Warren, even at such an early stage in the election when anything could happen.\n\n\u201cI think she has an excellent shot at becoming the Democratic nominee, and I think she can beat Trump. I decided to stay because I thought, \u201cOkay, in a little over a year, if she's elected \u2014 would you want to have turned down a photo with the next president?\u201d", "description": "Cody Eliff says he waited in the selfie line for over an hour after a recent rally in Iowa City just to spend a few moments with Elizabeth Warren.
