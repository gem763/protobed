USA TODAY\n\nSeniority has its advantages, but in the fight against President Trump and his cronies, young blood may be what's required to win.\n\nWith Sen. Bernie Sanders' heart scare, age is a rising concern among Democrats whose top presidential candidates are among the oldest in history, including Sanders, 78, former Vice President Joe Biden, 76, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, 70. As an impeachment investigation in Congress heats up, age could become a factor there, too.\n\nSeniority in Congress for Democrats has always been a mixed blessing. When majorities switch or committee chairs are defeated or die, the next person in line in terms of length of service on the committee automatically steps in to take the gavel.\n\nInterestingly, the Republicans abandoned the practice in the mid-1990s, when incoming Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich experienced a revelation: Many of those Republicans who had been waiting patiently for a chairmanship since the GOP last held the House in 1954 were in an advanced state of decrepitude. Gingrich shunted them aside for younger and more combative Republicans and then replaced seniority with six-year term limits.\n\nThe Democrats, having decided to retain the seniority rule, now confront President Donald Trump with many of their major committee chairs in their 70s and 80s. These very senior Democrats are not showing well against the administration and its backers. It is a problem not easily solved.\n\nFrailness on display\n\nThe problem was illustrated recently when former Trump campaign chair Corey Lewandowski appeared before the House Judiciary Committee. A natural performer in the Trump style, Lewandowski, 46, danced circles around Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, 72, who appeared at times befuddled and gob-smacked. A photo of Nadler made him appear to be fighting off a migraine. It took Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, 49, chairman of the Democratic Caucus, to warn the president\u2019s former campaign chief that he was out of line. But the double-edged sword of seniority cuts across a number of the most important panels.\n\nNot irrelevant: You don't have to be 37 like Pete Buttigieg, but age should matter in the 2020 campaign\n\nOne of the few universally recognized powers of Congress that can be used to rein in an out-of-control president is the power of the purse. Article I, section 9 of the Constitution is explicit in stating that no money can spent except pursuant to a congressional appropriation, yet Trump has been able to redirect money designated for certain military projects and disaster relief to the construction of the wall on the border with Mexico that has proved no barrier to tens of thousands of asylum seekers. But the \u201crepurposing\u201d of taxpayer money is only one of the areas in which the power of the purse has proved a rubber sword in the hands of Congress.\n\nRep. Maxine Waters and Rep.

Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nRescinding money appropriated for the operation of Cabinet departments is a tool that can be used on high officials who are acting improperly. The House Appropriations Committee headed by Rep. Nita Lowey, 82, could lower that boom on Attorney General William Barr, who has acted more like the president\u2019s consigliere than the peoples\u2019 counsel. Barr needs to have his personal office account slashed. He can do very well without his private dining room at the Justice Department. Let him use Uber instead of an armored SUV to get to his bagpipe recitals. But the Appropriations Committee seems to have no stomach for the fight. It might be age and the inertia of doing things as they have always been done.\n\nMany committees have this issue\n\nThe age issue in the House has mostly focused on Speaker Nancy Pelosi, 79, but it runs far deeper. Rep. Richard Neal, chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, is 70. Rep. Maxine Waters, chair of the Financial Services Committee, is 81. Foreign Affairs Chairman Eliot Engel is 72 and should be inquiring into President Trump\u2019s strong-arming the president of Ukraine to produce political dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nJulian Castro is no ageist: He's just practicing presidential politics while Hispanic\n\nMere age, of course, is no sure marker for inability to do a job, and accumulated knowledge based on longtime tenure on a committee is invaluable. Senior members are the committees\u2019 organizational memory. They have stored in their brains the schematic of all of the outside players within the committee\u2019s jurisdiction. They know who lobbies them and who contributes to the members\u2019 campaigns. But as the performance of special counsel Robert Mueller and Rep. Nadler\u2019s behavior appeared to reveal, endurance and mental acuity in older men and women can be problematic. However, the solution adopted by the GOP has created a totally new set of problems by inducing GOP chairs who are term-limited to retire instead of having to step back into the back benches.\n\nNow, the Democrats have the House majority, and it is their job to hold the administration\u2019s feet to the fire. There is considerable doubt that they are capable of living up to the moment.\n\nRoss K.
