No words were spoken during the ceremony featuring many in military dress.\n\nAcross town, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy stood with lawmakers carrying small U.S. flags as an announcer recounted the awful events of that day. Members of both parties, often riven by partisan conflict indoors, then joined together in a rousing first verse of \u201cGod Bless America.\u201d\n\nFour passenger planes were hijacked by al Qaeda terrorists in the attacks. Two of them crashed into the World Trade Center towers in Manhattan and a third hit the Pentagon outside D.C.\n\nThe other plane crashed in rural Pennsylvania after its passengers battled hijackers.\n\nThe U.S. launched a war against the Taliban in Afghanistan for harboring terrorists, leading to a long-running conflict and the killing of Osama bin Laden by a Navy SEAL team under President Barack Obama.\n\nMr. Trump last weekend abruptly canceled a plan to hold secretive peace talks among U.S. negotiators, the Afghan government and Taliban at Camp David, citing violent acts by the Taliban that killed an American soldier and others.\n\nSome members of Congress winced at the idea of Taliban members stepping foot at the presidential retreat so close to the anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
