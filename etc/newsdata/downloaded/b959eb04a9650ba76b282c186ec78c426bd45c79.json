He apparently used an old map projection for Hurricane Dorian which has utterly devastated the Bahamas but blessedly changed course, with Florida avoiding a direct hit. It\u2019s now barreling up the eastern seaborne, hugging the coastline but not making landfall. It\u2019s now a category two storm. Anyways, here is the Associated Press as to why we\u2019re talking about Dorian, Trump, and maps:\n\nDuring an Oval Office briefing Wednesday, Trump displayed a map of the National Hurricane Center forecast for last Thursday that showed Dorian could track over Florida. The map he displayed included what appeared to be a hand-drawn half-circle that extended the cone of uncertainty over a swath of Alabama. Trump had raised eyebrows and drawn an emphatic fact check from the National Weather Service on Sunday when he tweeted that Alabama, along with the Carolinas and Georgia, \u201cwill most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.\u201d The National Weather Service in Birmingham, Alabama, tweeted in response: \u201cAlabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian. We repeat, no impacts from Hurricane #Dorian will be felt across Alabama. The system will remain too far east.\u201d Few, if any, meteorologists put Alabama in the hurricane\u2019s path. Asked Sunday if Trump had been briefed about potential impact to Alabama, Christopher Vaccaro, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, wrote in an email, \u201cThe current forecast path of Dorian does not include Alabama.\u201d\n\nThis was the originally projected path of the Hurricane in its early stages. As you can see, almost all models predicted it to go through Florida also hitting Georgia and Alabama. I accept the Fake News apologies! pic.twitter.com/0uCT0Qvyo6 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2019\n\nAlabama was going to be hit or grazed, and then Hurricane Dorian took a different path (up along the East Coast). The Fake News knows this very well. That\u2019s why they\u2019re the Fake News! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2019\n\nTrump has insisted that Alabama was possibly on Dorian\u2019s projected path. This was backed up by one of his advisers as well (via The Hill):\n\nOne of President Trump's top advisers on Hurricane Dorian issued a lengthy statement on Thursday defending the president's repeated claims that forecasts showed Alabama getting hit by Hurricane Dorian, adding another twist to the days-long effort to justify Trump's claim. The White House circulated a statement on official letterhead from Rear Adm. Peter Brown, a Homeland Security and counterterrorism adviser, who said he briefed Trump multiple times about Dorian as well as models that showed the potential path of the eye of the storm. \"These products showed possible storm impacts well outside the official forecast cone,\u201d Brown said. \"While speaking to the press on Sunday, Sept. 1, the President addressed Hurricane Dorian and its potential impact on multiple states, including Alabama,\" he continued. \"The president\u2019s comments were based on that morning\u2019s Hurricane Dorian briefing, which included the possibility of tropical storm force winds in southeastern Alabama.\"\n\nBut of course, CNN had to get in on the action. The noted anti-Trump network harped on the map the president had used but then was served a piping hot cup of shut the hell up when they couldn\u2019t even point to where Alabama is on the map. Sorry, Alabamans\u2014you\u2019re now Mississippians now.\n\nHi @CNN, I know you guys are busy analyzing lines on a map, but perhaps you use your time to study up on U.S. geography? pic.twitter.com/kVgifHfPK4 \u2014 Stephanie Grisham (@PressSec) September 5, 2019\n\nCNN responds to WH over inaccurate map: https://t.co/NXoPPVY1Cy \u2014 Joe Concha (@JoeConchaTV) September 5, 2019\n\nSo, CNN gets all in a twist over Trump using a certain map but doesn\u2019t even know basic U.S. geography. Nice work, morons. Oh, and everyone has a plan until you get punched in the mouth, huh?", "description": ".09/06/2019 8:09:52AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Leah Barkoukis", "Timothy Meads"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/238/41ebc7b1-2841-48fe-b9e1-ac928b3cf272.png", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
