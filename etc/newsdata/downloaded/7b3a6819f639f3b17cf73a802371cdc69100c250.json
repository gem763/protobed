In order for me to play, one had to sit on the bench and accept that fact, and so do I now.\u201d\n\nSolskjaer has picked 22-year-old Scott McTominay to partner Paul Pogba in central midfield in their first four games, from which they have one win, one loss and two draws.\n\nMatic said he respected the decision but was determined to prove to the Norwegian manager that he belonged in the starting line-up.\n\n\u201cIn the first two or three games he picked the team without me,\u201d Matic, 31, added.\n\n\u201cI work as hard as I can. We respect the decision, it\u2019s up to me to show him that he was wrong and to bring me back to where I belong.\n\n\u201cThere is no problem. I told him I disagreed with him but that he had to decide the team.\u201d\n\nUnited return to league action after the international break when they host unbeaten Leicester City on Sept. 14.", "description": "Out-of-favour Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic says manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will have to hold himself responsible if the club are not in the running for the Premier League title this season.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426392286&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8407J", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
