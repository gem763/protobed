REUTERS/Florion Goga\n\nThe snap elections, the fourth since a declaration of independence in 2008, have been called after Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj resigned in July when he was summoned to appear before a war crimes court.\n\nHaradinaj has been questioned over his role in the 1998-99 war as one of the commanders of the former Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) who fought for independence from Serbia.\n\nAccording to opinion polls, public dissatisfaction with Haradinaj\u2019s record at the head of a three-party governing coalition has boosted support for opposition parties.\n\nTwo of those parties, the Democratic League for Kosovo (LDK) and the nationalist, left-leaning Vetevendosje, are seen as front runners in Sunday\u2019s vote, along with the Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK), the largest party in the current coalition.\n\nArton Demhasaj, from the think tank Cohu (Wake Up) in Pristina, the capital, said the first task of the new government will be to restart negotiations with Serbia.\n\n\u201cThe next government will be the government of the dialogue, from the first day to the last day, and only when the dialogue is over then we will have to deal with real issues such as corruption, education and the economy,\u201d Demhasaj told Reuters.\n\nNegotiations were halted a year ago when the outgoing government imposed 100 percent tariffs on goods produced in Serbia. Most, but not all, of the parties contesting the polls have said that they will abolish the tariffs but will introduce other retaliatory measures against Serbia.\n\nThe United States and the European Union see lingering, unresolved tensions between Belgrade and Pristina as a major threat to regional stability and are pushing for a normalisation of ties.\n\nOn Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump appointed Richard Grenell, the straight-talking U.S. ambassador to Germany, as special envoy to try to inject new energy into the talks between Belgrade and Pristina.\n\nTwenty years after NATO bombing expelled Serbian forces, Belgrade refuses to recognise Kosovo as independent and, in concert with its ally Russia, has blocked Pristina\u2019s membership of international organisations including the United Nations.\n\nIn 2013, Pristina and Belgrade agreed to an EU-mediated dialogue to normalise ties but little progress has been made.\n\nLast year, Kosovan President Hashim Thaci and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic signalled that they might agree to a land swap but they faced strong opposition to the idea domestically and abroad.\n\nIn Kosovo, all three parties LDK, Vetevendosje and PDK said the land swap was not acceptable.\n\nEUROPE\u2019S YOUNGEST POPULATION\n\nKosovo has Europe\u2019s youngest population, with an average age of 29, and has seen annual economic growth averaging 4% over the past decade, but it remains poor. Since Pristina won independence from Belgrade in 2008, more than 200,000 Kosovars have emigrated and applied for asylum in the European Union.\n\n\u201cIt hurts me when I see young, educated people from Kosovo coming to Germany because they don\u2019t see a better future here,\u201d said Skender Nekaj, 44, who came from Germany to Kosovo to vote together with seven other family members.\n\nThe public sector is the biggest employer in the country but an applicant typically needs political connections or to pay a bribe to find a job.\n\nThe European Union says corruption is \u201cwidespread\u201d and Transparency International ranks Kosovo as a very corrupt country.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\n\u201cIf you have money you can buy justice here, if you have money you can buy health because you go to a private clinic. I don\u2019t have money. My vote is the only thing I have,\u201d said Qendrim Agushi, 32, a construction worker who earns 13 euros a day.\n\nThe election will be overseen by more than 34,000 monitors including 100 from the European Union.\n\nPolls open at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT) and close at 7 p.m. (1700 GMT). Preliminary official results are expected by midnight (2200 GMT).", "description": "Deep-rooted corruption and a peace deal with Serbia which would pave the way for membership of the United Nations are the chief concerns of 1.9 million eligible voters in Kosovo who go to the polls on Sunday.", "authors": ["Fatos Bytyci", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437535664&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF940O3", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
