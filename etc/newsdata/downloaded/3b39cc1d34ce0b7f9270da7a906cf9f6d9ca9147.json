There was a pause as if she wanted my words to hang in the air. \u2018Well, then. Do come in.\u2019\n\nI walked into a narrow, Victorian-tiled hallway and turned left into a small sitting room, with a desk and chair, low bookshelves and a potted plant in the corner. Against one wall was a single bed with a purple bedspread. I looked at the woman, who\u2019d introduced herself as Beatrice.\n\n\u2018Am I supposed to lie down?\u2019\n\n\u2018If you don\u2019t feel comfortable, you can sit for now,\u2019 she said, taking a seat behind the head end of the bed. \u2018But, yes, I suggest you lie down. Tell me, why do you think you are here?\u2019\n\nKate Weingberg (pictured) details the difficulty of losing her South African psychotherapist, Beatrice, who she had visited for six years\n\nAt 26 years old, I\u2019d got lost on the way. My mother had died abruptly when I was three and a half (brain tumour; coma; gone two weeks later), and my father had remarried quickly. As a young kid I had managed to navigate what you might call \u2018a complicated family situation\u2019. But, in my teens, I had fallen down a hole. A dark hole of eating disorders and impulsive, escapist behaviour \u2014 no fixed abode, long periods abroad \u2014 and something else, which I didn\u2019t yet know was depression.\n\nApart from a short stint in hospital \u2014 three weeks, in which I made two friends and witnessed a girl die of anorexia \u2014 I\u2019d clambered out of the hole myself, gone to university and muddled through. This was not, I told Beatrice, the reason why I\u2019d decided to start therapy.\n\n\u2018Oh?\u2019 The voice came from behind my head. \u2018So, why, then?\u2019\n\nI stared up at the ceiling, off-white, a few scuff marks in the paint, which I would get to know very well.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m trying to write a novel. But I\u2019m stuck. I keep rewriting the beginning.\u2019 There was another pause.\n\n\u2018In that case, let\u2019s start at the beginning, shall we?\u2019\n\nFor a year I saw her twice a week. And then, for the next five years, once a week. Each week, pretty much the same ritual. Arriving, breathless and apologetic at her door:\n\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m late, the damn traffic...\u2019\n\n\u2018Sorry I\u2019m late. I got lost again. I know, I know, two years, you\u2019d think I\u2019d know my way by now...\u2019\n\nAnd at the end of each session she\u2019d get up and walk carefully over to her desk to look through her diary, while I, leaning on the desk next to her, wrote a cheque:\n\n\u2018Please fill in your stub,\u2019 she\u2019d say sternly, glancing over, glasses at the end of her nose.\n\n\u2018But there\u2019s really no point; I haven\u2019t filled in any of the others,\u2019 I protested.\n\n\u2018Well, do it anyway, won\u2019t you?\u2019 she\u2019d say with an impatient sigh.\n\nKate (pictured) would visit Beatrice at her home in West Hampstead at least once a week, for 50 minutes\n\nWhat did she do for me, this Jewish South African psychotherapist, with her gravelly voice, her frequent flashes of wit and her searing common sense?\n\nShe sat at the end of that bed every Thursday, for 50 minutes, through most of the weeks of a year, and through almost every mood.\n\nThe days when I was uncustomarily quiet, when it felt like there was metal running through my veins and my brain was numb.\n\nThe sessions when I was distracted and impatient, listening to the noises of the children across the road, keen to get out in the sunshine and live, live, live, and wondering what I was doing in this old lady\u2019s home in West Hampstead; was she a con artist \u2014 there was nothing wrong with me after all \u2014 was she in it for the money? And, surely, shrinks should not be so opinionated, should not let me know their feelings, and anyway, how long could I stare at those shelves with the same books on attachment and loss?\n\nShe sat there, out of sight, dispensing a wisdom that seemed to come from life and people more than her books, until the voice stayed with me when I wasn\u2019t in that room. Until I began to predict what she would say when I wasn\u2019t there, too.\n\n\u2018Just wait,\u2019 she\u2019d say, about a person or a situation. \u2018Don\u2019t judge or do anything now. It will emerge.\u2019\n\nOr, one week, when I arrived with bad news and a tearing pain in my chest: \u2018It\u2019s unbearable,\u2019 she said. \u2018Let it be unbearable.\u2019\n\n\u2018Learn to shut up,\u2019 she said once, surprising me. \u2018When you\u2019re feeling like that, don\u2019t phone a friend immediately. Sit with it, or pick up a book. Bring it back to me next week.\u2019\n\n28 per cent of Brits have consulted a counsellor or psychotherapist\n\nAnd another time: \u2018Even in those three years, your mother must have given you something very strong. Otherwise, you would have been broken. Something I can feel, deeper than the sadness, a little pilot light that hasn\u2019t gone out. Let\u2019s turn it up; let\u2019s work out how.\u2019\n\nAnd about the time when she\u2019d just about done this \u2014 when she\u2019d taught me to live and love better, in the week that my husband-to-be was to propose \u2014 Beatrice died.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re very thin,\u2019 I\u2019d remarked, a little carelessly, when she\u2019d opened the door after taking the odd week off here and there for \u2018health issues\u2019. \u2018Are you OK?\u2019\n\n\u2018Thin,\u2019 she agreed. \u2018It\u2019s annoying. But fine.\u2019\n\nThen the sessions had been suspended again.\n\nA few weeks later, I got a call from someone who introduced herself as Beatrice\u2019s daughter.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s in hospital,\u2019 she said quickly. \u2018She wanted me to tell you ...\u2019 \u2014 her voice caught on a sob \u2014 \u2018that she\u2019s very fond of you.\u2019\n\nEverything spun.\n\nKate (pictured) revealed she still slows down when driving past Beatrice's street, although it's been ten years since her death\n\n\u2018But she\u2019s going to be OK?\u2019 I heard myself say.\n\n\u2018I have to go...\u2019 the daughter\u2019s voice rose even higher, \u2018but she wanted you to know. She said it was important.\u2019\n\nThe funeral took place in a cemetery that I knew well. I sat crying in the back row of a small, packed synagogue. This is your therapist, I tried to remind myself.\n\nI looked around the grieving faces, wondering which of them had been her patients; confused and pained by the fact that, although I had known all the nuances of her voice, known when she was worried, tired or distracted, had known her in this way so deeply \u2014 I hadn\u2019t known her at all.\n\nThis is unbearable, I heard her say in my head. Let it be unbearable.\n\nNow, ten years later, my car still slows as I drive past her street. I have missed her, with a sharp pain, at all the landmark moments of my life \u2014 my wedding, the arrival of my two children \u2014 or still, now, in those days when I get stuck, when it feels like the metal is running through my veins again.\n\nOften, I hear her voice, the same gravelly warmth, like the time she said goodbye to me after my first session and I agreed to come back the following week. \u2018If you\u2019re game, this will be quite a journey,\u2019 she warned with a smile. \u2018But I promise we\u2019ll be on it together.\u2019\n\nAnd, sometimes, I visit where her ashes were scattered in the cemetery garden. In a flowerbed, about 30 ft away from a copper beech tree where the ashes of my mother \u2014 another Jewish South African woman, who, had she lived, would have been almost the same age \u2014 were scattered 29 years before.\n\nKate's novel The Truants is out now (Bloomsbury, \u00a314.99).
