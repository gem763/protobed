On trips abroad, he is punctual. On Sundays, when he delivers the Angelus for followers in St. Peter\u2019s Square, he begins uniformly at noon.\n\nBut this Sunday, the pontiff was late.\n\nWhen Francis finally poked his head out of a window from the apostolic palace \u2014 the building overlooking the square where the pope gives his weekly address \u2014 he quickly apologized for his tardiness and offered an explanation: He had been stuck in an elevator.\n\n\u201cI had an unexpected event,\u201d Francis said. \u201cI was stuck in an elevator for 25 minutes.\u201d\n\nThe pope said a \u201cdrop in voltage\u201d had caused the elevator problem. He did not say whether he had been alone.\n\n\u201cThank God the fire department came \u2014 I thank them so much,\u201d the pope continued. \u201cAfter 25 minutes of work, they managed to get it working.\n\n\u201cA round of applause for the firefighters!\u201d\n\nFrancis did not appear to be bothered by the incident. He is 82, and aside from some hip and joint pain, has had a relatively healthy papacy while cramming in a busy travel schedule by papal standards. He departs Wednesday for a one-week trip through Africa that includes stops in Mozambique, Madagascar and Mauritius.\n\nFrancis also announced Sunday that he was planning to elevate 13 figures to the rank of cardinal, including 10 who are under 80 years old and thus eligible to vote in the conclave that will one day select his successor. Following the trend under Francis, some of the new cardinals will represent countries from the periphery of the Catholic world, including Cuba and Indonesia. No Americans are among the group, and there is only one Italian, Archbishop Matteo Zuppi of Bologna.\n\nPerhaps the most notable name on the list was the Rev. Michael Czerny, the Vatican\u2019s undersecretary for migrants and refugees, who has acted as a point person for Francis on one of the pope\u2019s signature issues.\n\nRead more:\n\nVatican establishes new rule for sexual abuse complaints and coverups involving bishops\n\nVatican says people can\u2019t choose their genders\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "\u201cI had an unexpected event,\u201d the pontiff said after he showed up late to his weekly address in St. Peter\u2019s Square.", "authors": ["Chico Harlan", "Rome Bureau Chief Covering Southern Europe", "Sometimes Parts Beyond", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/DqAnD_T88Ch0PmGXsqZQF1p_wfI=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4XBJXVWMXEI6TB72QUA2IVWAAM.jpg"}
