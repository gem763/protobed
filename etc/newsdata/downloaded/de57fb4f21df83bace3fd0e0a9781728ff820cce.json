This pensive but at times wildly eccentric composer-pianist for a while fronted her own big band, and in the late Sixties assembled the cream of jazz and rock talent to record her own two-hour jazz opera. She made quirky humour and huge ambition seem like natural bedfellows.\n\nThese days, Bley prefers to think small, though in truth her particular talent has always revealed itself in small things \u2013 a shift in a chordal pattern that reveals a new emotional colour, a stubborn \u201cwrong note\u201d in what is otherwise a \u201cnormal\u201d jazz pattern. Bley is now in her eighties, and her playing tends ever more towards the musing and meditative, her tiny frame bent over the piano, face hidden by a shock of grey hair. Monday night\u2019s concert, in which Bley was joined by bass guitarist Steve Swallow, her musical partner of more than half a century, and British saxophonist Andy Sheppard, showed that her musical intelligence is as sharp as ever.\n\nThe trio launched off with the kind of simplicity most trios wouldn\u2019t dare; an absolutely straight 12-bar blues, which might have seemed dull had it not been for Swallow\u2019s tender, searching solo high up on his bass guitar (Swallow is more expressive as a melodist on the bass guitar than many players are on the \u201cnormal\u201d guitar). Then Sheppard joined in with a keening high note placed just so, coloured with that hugely slow, swell-like vibrato that is his trademark.", "description": "Carla Bley Trio, Kings Place, London N1 \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606", "authors": ["Ivan Hewett", "Neil Mccormick", "Charlotte Runcie", "Rupert Christiansen"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/music/2019/10/08/TELEMMGLPICT000212396730_1-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq11tASc3J8TactlUo6DlGiXISfxPkpkvr3uqeysZbcIU.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
