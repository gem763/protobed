(Mary Altaffer/AP)\n\nA federal appeals court on Tuesday ruled in favor of the Federal Communications Commission and upheld its repeal of Obama-era net neutrality protections, issuing a mixed decision that also appeared to open the door for state and local governments to try to introduce their own rules.\n\nIn a nearly 200-page decision, judges on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals largely sided with the FCC and its Republican chairman, Ajit Pai, over their decision two years ago to unwind Internet rules that required AT&T, Comcast, Verizon and other service providers to treat all Web traffic equally. The judges found \u201cunconvincing\u201d the arguments of a collection of tech companies, consumer advocates and government officials that had challenged the repeal.\n\nBut even as the court upheld the legality of much of the FCC\u2019s efforts, it offered a lifeline to net neutrality supporters by ruling that the FCC had overstepped its authority when it barred states from adopting open-Internet protections of their own. That is likely to embolden some states and local governments to pursue their own regulations. California, a trendsetter in Internet policy, adopted its own rules last year, though they were quickly challenged by the Justice Department and have not yet been enforced.\n\nIn doing so, the ruling threatened to spell even more legal wrangling at the FCC, which must reconsider elements of its net neutrality repeal, and in the court system, where the federal agency may still retain the ability to challenge states that adopt open-Internet rules, officials there signaled Tuesday.\n\nThe thicket of thorny issues could persist well past the 2020 presidential election, raising the potential that political changes in Washington could contribute new twists in telecom\u2019s most intractable debate. FCC commissioners are appointed by the president.\n\nIn a statement, Pai on Tuesday heralded the decision. \u201cThe court affirmed the FCC\u2019s decision to repeal 1930s utility-style regulation of the Internet imposed by the prior administration,\u201d he said.\n\nBut net neutrality advocates indicated their fight isn\u2019t finished. \u201cWhen the FCC rolled back net neutrality, it was on the wrong side of the American people, the wrong side of history,\u201d said FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat who voted against the repeal. \u201cToday we learned in critical respects it was also on the wrong side of the law.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat this means is that net neutrality is still going to be a big part of our discussion in this country,\u201d she continued. \u201cThere is still a fight to be had, and now it is both at the FCC and at the state and local level.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur fight to preserve net neutrality as a fundamental digital right is far from over,\u201d said Amy Keating, the chief legal officer at Mozilla, one of the companies that challenged the FCC repeal. She added Mozilla is \u201cconsidering our next steps in the litigation.\u201d\n\nPai, who was appointed to his position by President Trump, secured a repeal of the government\u2019s net neutrality rules in 2017 with the support of the commission\u2019s two other Republicans on a 3-to-2 party-line vote. Until then, federal open-Internet protections had prohibited providers such as AT&T and Verizon from blocking or slowing down access to Web content, or charging services such as Netflix and Hulu for faster delivery of their shows.\n\nPai justified the repeal by arguing that the rules, adopted under President Barack Obama, crimped telecom investment, stalling broadband build-out nationwide. In its place, the FCC required only that broadband providers be transparent about their practices. It shifted enforcement to the government\u2019s competition watchdog, the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nThe repeal triggered widespread backlash: More than 20 state attorneys general banded with other city and state leaders as well as Internet companies such as Mozilla, the maker of the Firefox Web browser, in challenging the FCC\u2019s efforts in court. Larger tech giants including Facebook and Google also filed supportive briefs through their Washington lobbying group, the Internet Association.\n\nState regulators said the FCC had acted in an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d manner, ignoring \u201csubstantial record evidence showing that [Internet service] providers have abused and will abuse their gatekeeper roles in ways that harm consumers and threaten public safety.\u201d\n\nTech giants, meanwhile, contended that the FCC had embarked on an \u201cabrupt about-face\u201d in response to the election, choosing to subject AT&T, Verizon and their peers to less regulation based on a fundamental misunderstanding of how the Web works.\n\nThe battle played out over four hours of oral arguments in February, during which the D.C. circuit\u2019s three judges at times seemed skeptical of the FCC. At least two of them harbored specific concerns about the effects of the agency\u2019s repeal on public safety agencies. First responders from cities such as Santa Clara, Calif., had told the court they feared Internet providers could charge them more for faster delivery of critical communications during an emergency, adding that the FCC never took their arguments to heart.\n\nThose concerns were reflected in Tuesday\u2019s ruling, which ordered the FCC on Tuesday to return to the drawing board and reconsider the effects of its repeal on police officers, firefighters and other emergency services. The judges said that the agency hadn\u2019t factored first responders and others, including low-income Americans, into its decision-making process.\n\n\u201cWe look forward to addressing on remand the narrow issues that the court identified,\u201d Pai said.\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story attributed the rollback of the net neutrality rules to the Trump administration. The FCC is an independent agency whose commissioners are appointed by the president.\n\nRachel Siegel contributed to this story.", "description": "In a nearly 200-page opinion, judges largely sided with the Federal Communications Commission.
