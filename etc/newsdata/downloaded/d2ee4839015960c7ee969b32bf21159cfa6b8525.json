People were coming out of the gate and then they were just lying on the pitch.\n\nJudge Sir Peter Openshaw told the jury: 'He [Duckenfield] has a resilient, passive and expressionless external presentation which gives no indication of his state of mind so don't draw an adverse inference against him'\n\nCrowd at the FA Cup Semi-Final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Sheffield\n\nDuckenfield (pictured), 75, who was the South Yorkshire Police chief superintendent in command of the FA Cup semi-final on April 15 1989, denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool supporters\n\n'I saw two people's heads being covered up and I presumed they had died.'\n\nThe court heard she and her husband found Brian in the concourse of the ground but did not find Philip until they identified his body in the gymnasium at about 9.30pm.\n\nLiverpool supporter Ian McDermott told the court he had been caught in the crush in pen three of the terraces.\n\nHe described struggling to breathe and losing consciousness.\n\nHe said: 'When I knew I was going, obviously that was extremely terrifying. I can still visualise that today, that's never left.\n\n'I've been told by doctors it was pre-death terror.'\n\nThe court heard he was taken to hospital after being resuscitated at the ground.\n\nNinety-six men, women and children died in the disaster but, under the law at the time, there can be no prosecution for the death of the 96th victim of the disaster, Anthony Bland, as he died more than a year and a day after his injuries were caused.\n\nThe picture above shows the crowds of people at the stadium and fans being carried off by officers", "description": "At Preston Crown Court on Friday, Judge Sir Peter Openshaw directed the jury not to draw an adverse inference from the demeanour of David Duckenfield, who was sitting in the court.", "authors": ["Darren Boyle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/17/20188728-0-image-a-8_1572021458538.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
