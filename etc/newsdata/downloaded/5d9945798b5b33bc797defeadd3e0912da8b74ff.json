Pilots were unable to regain control of the aircraft, which crashed, killing everyone on board the two flights, a total of 346 passengers and crew.\n\nRead more: The complete history of the 737 Max, Boeing's promising yet problematic workhorse jet\n\nAn aspect of the design flaw that Boeing has been working to fix is the fact that the automated tool, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), could be activated by a single sensor reading, meaning that one damaged or faulty AoA vane was enough to trigger the system, leading to the crashes.\n\nMCAS was designed to compensate for the 737 Max's engines, which are larger than previous 737 generations. The larger engines could cause the plane's nose to tip upward, leading to a stall. In that situation, MCAS could automatically point the nose downward to negate the effect of the engine size.\n\nPilots' experience and real-world reactions\n\nHowever, recent reports and conversations have begun to shift towards pilots' inexperience, as well as a lack of training standards, as a contributor to the crashes.\n\nThe NTSB report is consistent with that assessment, although it stopped short of assigning blame to the pilots.\n\n\"It is important to note that our safety recommendation report addresses that issue and does not analyze the actions of the pilots involved in the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines accidents,\" Sumwalt said. \"That analysis is part of the ongoing accident investigations by the respective authorities.\"\n\nThe NTSB report suggests that Boeing's designs and the FAA's approval of them assumed that pilots \u2014 regardless of quality of training \u2014 would behave one way during a crisis, when in reality the pilots involved in the crashes behaved differently.\n\nAlthough Boeing proved to the FAA during certification test flights that MCAS could be disabled safely should it unintentionally activate, the NTSB report says that the test scenarios \u2014 which met FAA requirements \u2014 did not reflect the real-world scenario of multiple conflicting and confusing alarms, and did not account for the fact that that scenario could lead to pilots responding and behaving differently.\n\nRead more: Boeing is quietly reaching out to retired airplane mechanics for help getting the 737 Max airborne again\n\n\"The NTSB notes in the report that it is concerned that the accident pilots' responses to unintended MCAS operation were not consistent with the underlying assumptions about pilot recognition and response that were used for flight control system functional hazard assessments as part of the Boeing 737 MAX design,\" the NTSB said in a press release.\n\nThe report also suggests that the underlying assumptions by the FAA and Boeing didn't consider the effects of multiple compounding alarms, which the pilots experienced due to the faulty sensor.\n\n\"The NTSB's report further notes that FAA guidance allows such assumptions to be made in certification analyses without providing clear direction about the consideration of multiple, flight-deck alerts and indications in evaluating pilot recognition and response. The NTSB's report states that more robust tools and methods need to be used for validating assumptions about pilot response to airplane failures in safety assessments developed as part of the U.S. design certification process.\"\n\nRecommendations to prevent future issues\n\nThe report recommends that the FAA consider how multiple cockpit alerts could confuse or affect pilots when certifying new planes in the future, and to ensure that the plane's design accounts for that.\n\nIt also suggests that the FAA develop a way to validate any assumptions about pilot behavior \u2014 this could include more simulator test flights with pilots who have not been briefed on the scenario.\n\nFinally, it suggests incorporating better diagnostic tools to help pilots decide which alert to address first.\n\nThe 737 Max has been grounded worldwide since the days following the second crash, as Boeing prepares a software fix to prevent similar incidents. The fix is expected to be approved after new certification test flights, allowing the planes back in the air, by the end of this year or early 2020.", "description": "The report suggests that the FAA and Boeing assumed pilots would behave one way, when in reality multiple cockpit alarms made things different.", "authors": ["David Slotnick"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8cd3c72e22af5baf1bbd94-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
