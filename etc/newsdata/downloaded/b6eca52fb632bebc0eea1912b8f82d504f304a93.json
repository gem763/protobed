He will be sidelined for 6 to 8 weeks.\n\nThomas, 30, joined the Wizards this summer a few years removed from playing a starring role for the Boston Celtics. He appeared in just 12 games for the Denver Nuggets last season in a backup role.\n\nIn Washington, he was expected to help at the point while John Wall continued his rehab and recovery from an Achilles tear. The Wizards won\u2019t have Wall until midseason at the soonest, and they traded Tomas Satoransky away in the offseason.\n\nNow they might not have Thomas for opening night either. Their first game is Oct. 23, about five weeks from now, at the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
