(PCG) are trading lower in Friday's market, after the company's creditors and victims of wildfires that hit California in 2017 and 2018 said they wanted to present a chapter 11 plan that would compete with the company's proposal.\n\nAt 1:22 p.m. ET, shares of the company were trading 6.27% lower, at $11.38. Year to date, shares are down over 51%.\n\nThe restructuring plan offered by PG&E would cap payments to victims of the wildfires at $8.4 billion and pay another $11 billion to pay insurance claims. The proposal from bondholders and victims puts the total value of claims at $24 billion, according to court papers.\n\n--Write to Stephen Nakrosis at stephen.nakrosis@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 20, 2019 13:45 ET (17:45 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
