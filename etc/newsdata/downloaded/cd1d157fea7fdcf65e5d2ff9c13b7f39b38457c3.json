Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) called the offensive \u201cmisplaced and very unfortunate,\u201d and said he had \u201cfull confidence\u201d in Vindman \u201cas an individual and his patriotism.\u201d\n\nThe response from Trump\u2019s party created an unusual dynamic in which Republicans were defending a man who was simultaneously accusing the president of undermining national security for his own political purposes. Privately, several Republicans found Vindman\u2019s testimony to be damaging and lamented that once again they were forced to defend the president\u2026\n\nSen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), who oversees Eurasia affairs on the Foreign Relations Committee and traveled with Vindman to Ukraine for Zelensky\u2019s inauguration in May, said \u201canybody that served this nation and put themselves at risk is a patriot in my book.\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably not real smart,\u201d Johnson said of questions about Vindman\u2019s patriotism.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics Vindmans-Firsthand-Account-Of-Trump-Call-Puts-Gop-In-Bind-Emboldens-Democrats"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
