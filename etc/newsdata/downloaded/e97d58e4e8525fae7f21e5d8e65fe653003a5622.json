Brexit was nowhere to be seen. The Conservative Party had been hollowed out. MPs were at war. Donors were furious. Nearly half of all people who had voted Conservative in 2017 had jumped ship to Nigel Farage and the Brexit Party.\n\nThe Conservative Party was like a skydiver who had jumped out of a plane with no parachute.\n\nIt was plummeting in the polls and had fallen to a derisory 24 per cent.\n\nMay had put one of the world\u2019s oldest and most successful political parties on course for the worst vote in its entire electoral history.\n\nAnd all of this had opened the door to Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour Party, which during May\u2019s premiership had enjoyed regular leads in the polls, introducing the very real possibility of the most radical Left-wing government in Britain\u2019s history.\n\nConservatives were not just fighting for Brexit. They were fighting for their very survival.\n\nBut now fast forward to where we are today.\n\nBoris Johnson has been Prime Minister for less than 90 days but, forgetting the drama of yesterday, look at how different things are. The Conservative Party is coming off life support and is now heading towards a full recovery.\n\nFew of his critics have bothered to notice, but the party\u2019s position has radically improved.\n\nPrime Minister Mr Johnson has a selfie with police at Whaley Bridge in Derbyshire on August 2\n\nJust look at the numbers. The Conservatives averaged only 24 per cent in the final weeks of May but with Johnson at the helm it averaged 30 per cent in early August, 32 per cent in early September and is now on 34 per cent.\n\nWith Labour falling back, as Remainers jump ship to the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats, Johnson has put his party on a secure course toward a majority.\n\nIn fact, in one poll this week, the Conservatives are up again to 37 per cent, leaving them 15 points clear of Labour. Corbyn is now nowhere to be seen. Of the 54 polls that we have had since Johnson took power, Labour has led in just one. While the twittering classes continue to criticise the Prime Minister, the British people have been quietly sharing their views about who they would most like to lead Britain.\n\nThe results are striking.\n\nEach week or so, voters are asked: \u2018Who would make the best Prime Minister?\u2019 When May was in power, the people had completely tuned out. The most popular answer was \u2018not sure\u2019. Today, the public give Johnson a clear and commanding lead; 43 per cent say Johnson, while only 21 per cent say Corbyn.\n\nBut now look closer. The overwhelming majority of Leave supporters prefer Johnson and so too, crucially, do Brexit Party voters. Seventy three per cent of Leavers and 84 per cent of Brexit Party voters say that Johnson would make the best prime minister.\n\nThis shows how, unlike May, Johnson is actually managing to unify the Leave vote, which used to be divided between the Conservatives and the Brexit Party.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson poses for selfies during a walkabout in Birmingham on July 26\n\nBack at the European elections in the spring, nearly 40 per cent of people who had voted Conservative in 2017 had become so fed up with the failure to deliver Brexit that they had defected over to Farage\u2019s party. But, today, Johnson and his team have squeezed that figure down to just 11 per cent. This could make all the difference at the next General Election, given that the Remainers are currently fairly evenly divided between Labour and the Liberal Democrats.\n\nWhy are these voters flocking to Johnson? His determination to deliver Brexit is one piece of the puzzle, but it is not the only piece.\n\nWhile May never really knew what she believed, in just three months Johnson has laid out an ambitious new agenda that is appealing to voters who back Brexit. These are people who play by the rules, yet feel that life in Britain is rigged against them. Johnson has promised not just to \u2018Get Brexit Done\u2019 but to help our creaking NHS, schools, police and, most important of all, the regions outside of London that have for too long been left behind.\n\nBlue-collar Britain is tuning in and likes what it hears.\n\nIn the polls, the working classes now show stronger support for Johnson than Corbyn, a shift that will be crucial in Labour Leave seats in northern England, the Midlands and Wales.\n\nYou have to wonder about the health of the Labour Party when the very voters that it was set up to represent prefer the Conservative Party leader to Corbyn by a margin of 44 per cent to 17 per cent. Johnson is even ahead of Corbyn among the very groups that we are routinely told are fanatical Corbynistas and Johnson-haters. In the latest YouGov poll, women, 18 to 24-year-olds and Londoners all strongly prefer Johnson over Corbyn.\n\nAll of this points to the massive disconnect between the insular world of Twitter and much of the commentariat, and the world that is inhabited by ordinary voters.\n\nJohnson is still routinely underestimated. The chattering classes said that he would never be able to revise May\u2019s failed Withdrawal Agreement. But he did. Many said that Johnson would be unable to remove the backstop from the Withdrawal Agreement. But he did.\n\nAnd many said that he would never be able to rally his own party around a revised deal. But he has done exactly that. If Johnson continues to enjoy these kinds of numbers in the polls, then his premiership will be transformed.\n\nRemainers who yesterday cheered the passing of the Letwin Amendment, which requires yet another delay to Brexit, should look at the bigger picture.\n\nThe more they obstruct Johnson, the more likely it us that his premiership will be transformed from a brief footnote into a major chapter in Britain\u2019s post-War political history.\n\nMATTHEW GOODWIN is a professor of politics at the University of Kent", "description": "The British people have responded far more positively to the Johnson premiership than many commentators and others in Westminster would have you think, writes MATTHEW GOODWIN.", "authors": ["Matthew Goodwin For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/22/19938420-0-image-a-46_1571521907363.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
