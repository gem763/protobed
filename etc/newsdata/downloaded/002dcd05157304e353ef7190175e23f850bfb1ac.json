But with Mr. Trump and Republicans seemingly poised to continue attacks on Mr. Biden and his son, his ability to stay on that message will face another significant test.\n\nMr. Biden is already under pressure from several directions: He faces intense competition for the nomination from Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has been rising in polls and overtook him in a key survey in Iowa recently. He will soon announce his fund-raising results for the third quarter of 2019, which will show whether or not he has momentum in the money race. As the end of the quarter approaches, Mr. Biden has spent much of his time at high-dollar fund-raisers \u2014 which are covered by the news media \u2014 a decision that has taken him away from public events at a momentous time for his candidacy.", "description": "The Democratic candidate is entering a critical new phase of the race, with the president facing impeachment and a spotlight on the Biden family.", "authors": ["Sydney Ember", "Katie Glueck"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/27/us/politics/27biden/27biden-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
