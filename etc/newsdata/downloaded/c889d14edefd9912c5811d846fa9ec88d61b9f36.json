At the wedding they looked so happy together.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\u201cMel isn\u2019t looking for a serious relationship, and Rory is very easygoing, so they are keeping things very casual and chilled for now.\u201d\n\nThe source added the Spice Girl \u201ccan\u2019t stop smiling when she\u2019s around him.\u201d\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nLeeds lad Rory allegedly grew close to the mum-of-three shortly after she split from her ex-husband Stephen Belafonte in 2017.\n\nNews of the Spice Girl\u2019s romance comes just weeks after she told TV presenter Jonathan Ross she was single and was living with her mum since moving back to Leeds.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\nShe told Jonathan: \u201c[I\u2019m] back in Leeds. She\u2019s kind of shoved to one side of the house. Not literally [kicked her out]. My mum has built a beautiful house. We\u2019re surrounded by like sheep. It\u2019s Yorkshire, so it\u2019s all very kind of country and nature.\n\n\u201cShe kind of has a bit of the house. I\u2019ve got three kids, so I have more of the house than she does.\u201d\n\nHowever, the star\u2019s relocation from the Hollywood Hills to Yorkshire coincidently also places her closer to Rory, who runs a hair salon in Leeds.\n\nMel\u2019s reps have been contacted for comment.\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
