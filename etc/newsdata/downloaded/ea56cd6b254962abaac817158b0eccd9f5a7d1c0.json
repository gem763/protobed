This is the unsettling idea at the heart of How to Be an Antiracist, in which one of the US\u2019s most respected scholars of race and history steps away from documenting the racist sins of others, and turns the lens pointedly, uncomfortably, at himself.\n\nKendi\u2019s argument is brilliantly simple. An idea, action or policy is either racist \u2013 that is, contributing to a history that regards and treats different races as inherently unequal \u2013 or it is antiracist, because it is trying to dismantle that history. There is nothing in between. There is no pure state of racism or anti-racism: people of all races and backgrounds can fall into either category depending on their ideas, actions or the policies they support.\n\nOne of the easiest things to relate to in Kendi\u2019s hypothesis, which puts it in line with other contemporary books about racism and inequality, is his withering attack on the idea of being \u201cnot racist\u201d. There is no scholarship required to realise intuitively that President Trump declaring that he is not racist while issuing multiple racist slurs, or some of the British press taking great offence at being called \u201cracist\u201d while promoting tropes about ethnic minority communities, reveals the meaninglessness of being \u201cnot racist\u201d. Everyone says they are not racist. Few actively self-identity as \u201cantiracist\u201d.\n\nAntiracism takes effort. Kendi has made clear in his previous work that he rejects the idea that racism is born out of ignorance. Racism, history shows, is born out of its profitability and utility. It is rooted in patriarchy and capitalism. To stand against it requires acknowledging what he calls \u201cthe metastatic cancer\u201d that has seen \u201cracism spread to nearly every part of the body politic\u201d.\n\nKendi digs deep to justify these analogies. He charts not just his personal journey through the racist ideas he and his family embraced, but also the advanced-stage cancer that ravaged his body after he completed his last book, the award-winning Stamped from the Beginning. \u201cRacist ideas piled up before me like trash at a landfill,\u201d he writes. \u201cTens of thousands of pages of Black people being trashed as natural or nurtured beasts, devils, animals, rapists, slaves \u2026 More than five hundred years of toxic ideas on the Black body.\u201d At one point Kendi, whose wife also survived cancer shortly before he was diagnosed, apologises for his inability to separate cancer and racism. But there is no need. His honesty in linking his personal struggles to the work he has now undertaken is one of the most powerful elements in this compelling book.\n\nIn other ways Kendi raises more questions than he answers. Stories about his parents, who met in the black liberation theology movement, before his mother went off to work as a missionary in Liberia, feel unfinished. He hints that he ultimately rejected the Christian beliefs with which he was raised, but steps away from narrating when and why. His stories of being an uninterested and not particularly compassionate child seem half-told. He does reveal that he changed his middle name from Henry to Xolani once he learned of Prince Henry \u201cthe Navigator\u201d, the 15th\u2011century Portuguese royal, who first pioneered transatlantic slavery. I\u2019m intrigued as to whether those who named him share his sentiments.\n\nKendi salutes his parents for their passion for justice while gently pointing out that they raised him as \u201ca racist, sexist, homophobe\u201d. This sounds more damning than it is \u2013 we are all racist, sexist homophobes in Kendi\u2019s view, unless we are striving not to be in some meaningful way that changes policy.\n\nHow to Be an Antiracist is more like a textbook than I would like, but then there is much schooling to be done. Kendi succinctly takes down assimilationist thinking (\u201cAssimilationists typically position White people as the superior standard\u201d) and the glamorising of poverty as \u201cauthentic blackness\u201d (with typical honesty, he confesses to having been guilty of this).\n\nKendi\u2019s honesty in linking his struggle with cancer to his work is a compelling element in this book\n\nHe is particularly strong on his critique of \u201cuplift suasian\u201d \u2013 the tendency of black people to blame themselves for racial inequity, to \u201cstrap the entire Black race on the Black body\u2019s back, shove the burdened Black body into White spaces, order the burdened Black body to always act in an upstanding manner to persuade away White racism\u201d.\n\nKendi\u2019s is also a welcome intervention into the sensitive subject differences between African Americans and other black groups in the US, especially African and Caribbean immigrants, whose different outcomes and historic mutual suspicions of each other are unsentimentally unpicked.\n\nHis analysis travels well. A Wall Street Journal columnist\u2019s cultural racism \u2013 \u201cblack culture today not only condones delinquency and thuggery but celebrates it to the point where black youths have adopted jail fashion in the form of baggy, low-slung pants and oversize T-shirts\u201d \u2013 sounds a lot like David Starkey\u2019s British version of the same: \u201cA particular sort of violent, destructive, nihilistic gangster culture has become the fashion.\u201d These reductive voices, so familiar in all multicultural societies, are channelled by the media and political establishment because they claim, in the same breath, that they are \u201cnot racist\u201d. Yet some of the language in the book is problematic. The welcome chapter on how to be anti-colourist crudely divides black society into \u201cLight\u201d and \u201cDark\u201d \u2013 both are terms that others have sought to reject, with mixed success. Kendi\u2019s description of his journey into feminism \u2013 about which he is refreshingly honest \u2013 still involves some of the awkward tropes about \u201cstrong women\u201d that as a black woman I find particularly tired.\n\nThis is a dogmatic book, but that should be no surprise given that the title takes the form of a \u201cHow To\u201d. Kendi gets away with the instructional tone, both because of the work he has put in, and because of his ability to face up to his own flaws.\n\n\u2022 How to Be an Antiracist by Ibram X Kendi is published by Bodley Head (\u00a316.99).
