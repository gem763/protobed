The poor family can't do anything. They have lost a breadwinner,\" Lesufi told News24.\n\n\"Anyone who can provide for them, they will accept. I just thought we can't allow this.\"\n\nVusi Mgiqwa's family had met with lawyers representing the accused, Lukas van der Merwe, and indicated a willingness to accept the money as part of a plea bargain, the Sowetan reported.\n\nWithout going into details, National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Phindi Mjonondwane said the Director of Public Prosecution was considering the plea bargain.\n\nThe car guard's sister Jabusile Mgixo told News24 on Monday: \"I can't say what I will do because my situation is dire. I do not even work and I just buried my brother on June 1st.\"\n\n\n\nMgiqwa died in hospital after Van Der Merwe allegedly punched him during a fight outside at the Selcourt shopping centre in Springs last year.\n\n\n\nAccording to Rapport, he had tried to intervene in an altercation between two men over a parking space.\n\n\n\nTapping into his network, Lesufi raised the money in a very short space of time and said the family had agreed in principle to accept the money.\n\nHe said the family had indicated they had not received any other money, which he had referred to in his tweet as \"blood money\".\n\nHe would visit them in Tsakane East on Monday afternoon.\n\n\n\n", "description": "Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has raised R50 000 for the family of a slain car guard, who was reportedly offered the same amount as compensation from his alleged killer.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7729/2759f7eb97a441d19da860a116998833.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
