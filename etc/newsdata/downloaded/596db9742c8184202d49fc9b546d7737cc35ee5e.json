Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May, recognized that when Parliament rejected the deal she negotiated with the Europeans three times.\n\nIndeed, within minutes of Johnson\u2019s revised deal landing on Thursday, Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party diminished its chances by declaring that the party\u2019s 10 members of Parliament would not support it.\n\nAD\n\nNow, Johnson must figure out how to make up for those votes, and then some. Analysts calculate that he needs about 60 votes beyond what he has already locked up to get to the 320-vote threshold for the deal to pass.\n\nAD\n\nTim Bale, a politics professor at the University of London, estimated that it was possible, but not probable, that Parliament would back Johnson on Saturday.\n\nRob Ford, a politics professor at the University of Manchester, said it will be \u201ctight.\u201d\n\nMujtaba Rahman, an analyst with Eurasia Group, predicted a \u201cnarrow defeat\u201d for Johnson. In a briefing note Thursday, he calculated that Johnson could be 15 to 20 votes short.\n\nMedia outlets on Friday were crunching the numbers. The Financial Times predicted that Johnson would fall two votes short of winning; Sky News said he was four votes shy.\n\nAD\n\nIf Johnson is to defy expectations for the second time in one week, he will need to find new pockets of support. So whom might he be able to persuade?\n\nLabour rebels\n\nJeremy Corbyn, leader of the official opposition Labour Party, has said his party will not back the agreement. \u201cJohnson\u2019s negotiated a worse deal than Theresa May,\u201d Corbyn tweeted Thursday. \u201cThis sellout deal risks our rights, protections and [National Health Service]. It won\u2019t bring the country together and should be rejected.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut some Labour lawmakers \u2014 most likely those who are Euroskeptics, or who have Euroskeptic constituencies \u2014 may buck their party and vote with Johnson.\n\nLabour has a nuanced \u2014 some say muddled \u2014 position on Brexit, and some of its members of Parliament may want to enter the next general election with Brexit in the rearview mirror.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSome Labour MPs also think that once we get this deal done, we can go back to politics as usual,\u201d said Bale. Being able to focus on other issues, such as living standards or health care, some of them may hope, could provide Labour with higher chances of succeeding in an election.\n\nFord said that without the DUP on board, Johnson probably would need the backing of at least 15 to 20 Labour lawmakers to give him any chance of victory on Saturday. Could he get there? Perhaps. Earlier this month, 19 Labour members of Parliament wrote a letter to the E.U. urging it to strike a deal with Britain.\n\nAD\n\nEx-Tory lawmakers and other independents\n\nLast month, Johnson kicked 21 Conservative lawmakers out his party after they rebelled to block a no-deal Brexit. Many had been party loyalists until that point \u2014 including Nicholas Soames, grandson of wartime leader Winston Churchill \u2014 and it seems likely that a sizable number will fall back in line.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of speculation about olive branches on offer from No. 10,\u201d Ford said, referring to the prime minister\u2019s official residence. If Johnson offers to bring those lawmakers back into good standing, meaning they could run as Conservatives in the next election, that might be sufficiently appealing to many of them.\n\nBut perhaps not to all. Philip Hammond, Britain\u2019s former finance minister, indicated this week he may not back the deal. Amber Rudd, who quit Johnson\u2019s cabinet, told the Telegraph newspaper on Thursday that she was still mulling it over.\n\nAD\n\nAnd what about Jo Johnson, the prime minister\u2019s brother, who quit the government, citing \u201cunresolvable tension\u201d between family loyalty and the national interest? Jo Johnson voted against Brexit in 2016 and has campaigned for a second referendum. The prime minister probably should not count on his brother to get him over the line.\n\nAD\n\nHard-line Brexiteers\n\nA group of 28 hard-line Euroskeptics in the Conservative Party did not back May\u2019s deal on any of its outings. But several in the group \u2014 who call themselves \u201cthe Spartans\u201d after ancient Greek warriors \u2014 have indicated greater warmth for Johnson\u2019s deal. Steve Baker, the group\u2019s leader, emerged from 10 Downing Street on Wednesday night saying he was \u201coptimistic that it is possible to reach a tolerable deal that I am able to vote for.\u201d\n\nThe group has often taken its cue from the DUP. And on Wednesday, Mark Francois, a \u201cSpartan,\u201d said his caucus would take DUP \u201cviews very strongly into account.\u201d But he also noted that \u201cit is not axiomatic we would follow whatever the DUP do.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSome of these hard-liners fear losing Brexit altogether if they do not back this deal. Others say they may not agree with everything in the deal, but they like that Johnson has outlined a more decisive split than that envisioned by May. As a Brexiteer, Johnson was always going to be able to win over other Brexiteers where his predecessor struggled.\n\nAnd if other means of persuasion do not work, Johnson could threaten to kick them out of the party unless they back him.", "description": "The math looks tight.\u00a0But the British leader has a chance of getting the agreement passed.", "authors": ["Karla Adam", "London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom", "Rick Noack", "Foreign Affairs Reporter Focusing On Europe", "International Security"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/4rX6fIt357N9T91ryXtSxDMJC2I=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/V5GD7XHRRAI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
