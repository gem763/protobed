Last month, Virgin's Chief Executive Officer Paul Scurrah declined to rule out cutting flights to Hong Kong as part of its route and fleet review.\n\nAustralia's competition regulator earlier this month had backed Virgin's application for a slot, citing competition concerns if Qantas were to get both.\n\nThe draft decision comes ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games set to begin next summer.\n\nIASC, in its draft, said the Japanese government released 100 extra aircraft arrivals and departures per day at Haneda, aimed solely at international flights.\n\nQantas was not immediately available for comment.", "description": "Qantas, Virgin Australia get slots at Tokyo's Haneda airport", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9K0A0_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
