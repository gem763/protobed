Marshall was able to capture musicians both in commanding onstage moments of performance (like his iconic photograph of Johnny Cash flipping off the camera during his performance at San Quentin), and in quiet and almost somber, private moments as well (just look to his equally famous photograph of Bob Dylan playing with a tire in a dirty Greenwich Village).\n\nContaining over 200 photographs, more than 70 of which have never been published before, the new book, Jim Marshall: Show Me the Picture, is a fitting tribute and retrospective of Marshall\u2019s career. It was compiled by Amelia Davis, his longtime assistant.\n\nHere, a selection of images from the book, showcasing Marshall\u2019s unique ability to capture the humanity in superstars, as well of that in average anonymous Americans.", "description": "More than 200 images\u201470 never before published\u2014by the man behind many of rock n\u2019 roll's most famous photographs.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Hunt Brockway", "Senior Photo Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1567112305/GalleryHeroesTemplate_hs4ri5"}
