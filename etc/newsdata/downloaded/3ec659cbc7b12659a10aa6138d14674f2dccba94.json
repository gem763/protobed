Martin Luther King Jr was no longer a Commie revolutionary but a beloved national icon. Segregation and the Klan\u2019s reign of terror was as obviously, stunningly immoral as Nazism.\n\nUntil today, and until Donald Trump. You may not have known this, but Trump is himself a victim, no different from the poor souls who were publicly tortured and murdered by the Klan and its mobs. Despite his German roots, and his family\u2019s business history of race discrimination, Trump thinks he\u2019s suffering just as much.\n\n\u201cSo some day, if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House, even by a tiny margin, they can impeach the President, without due process or fairness or any legal rights,\u201d tweeted the president who has no recollection of a predecessor called Bill Clinton.\n\n\u201cAll Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here \u2013 a lynching. But we will WIN!\u201d\n\nTrump is strange, but he\u2019s not a strange fruit. And so it came to pass that the only people who can stop Trump\u2019s conviction at his forthcoming impeachment trial were forced to spend the day talking about lynching.\n\nTo do so, you need to suspend a little reality and a lot of self-respect. You need to become a human shell that blurts out words with no meaning, that sparks thoughts with no intelligence. To wit: one Hogan Gidley, who holds the hallucinatory role of deputy press secretary in Trump\u2019s West Wing.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018\u201cThe president\u2019s not comparing what\u2019s happened to him with one of our darkest moments in American history. He\u2019s just not,\u2019 Hogan Gidley told reporters.\u2019 Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPA\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s not comparing what\u2019s happened to him with one of our darkest moments in American history. He\u2019s just not,\u201d Gidley told reporters, ignoring Exhibit A in the day\u2019s proceedings: the president\u2019s tweet that did just that.\n\n\u201cI understand there are many people in the media who don\u2019t agree with his language. He has used many words to describe the way he has been relentlessly attacked.\u201d\n\nHe has indeed used so many words, to such remarkable effect. Much like the hapless Hogan himself. They flow like endless rain into a paper cup.\n\nAs a defence of the president\u2019s position, Hogan\u2019s explanation is the equivalent of going back to bed to pull the covers over your head. There\u2019s a reason why there are no White House press briefings any more: because you literally can\u2019t make sense of the boss without getting fired, indicted, or shamed into permanent unemployment.\n\nOther Republicans not employed by the White House found it easier to express what they thought. Both Mitch McConnell and Kevin McCarthy, the Republican leaders in the Senate and House, said they disagreed with Trump\u2019s choice of words.\n\nAdam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican, went even further by saying that Trump should retract his comments immediately. \u201cMay God help us return to a better way,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nThe almighty ought to be busy in Syria right now, so this unusually orange challenge rightly falls into the lap of Republicans like Kinzinger himself.\n\nLike a fatberg blocking the sewers of Capitol Hill, Trump\u2019s sense of victimhood and love of lying is creating unbearable pressure in a system designed to flush away an extraordinary volume of political waste material.\n\nSo Republicans were talking about Trump\u2019s self-styled lynching instead of defending Trump from the blockbuster impeachment evidence of his current ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nUntil now, Trump has drawn what he might call a \u201cred line in the sand\u201d around the notion that there was no quid pro quo in Ukraine \u2013 no withholding of military aid in exchange for political dirt on the Biden family.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Photograph: Leah Millis/Reuters\n\nBut ambassador William Taylor flatly contradicted Trump\u2019s defence, much like his chief of staff Mick Mulvaney did last week \u2013 before Mulvaney was forced to swallow his words and regurgitate them back into the public square in an unspeakable puddle.\n\nNever mind all that quidding and quoing now. It\u2019s time to run for the vomitorium.\n\nHow did the party that gave the world freedom fries find itself locked in this Trump-shaped prison? The simple answer is that they built it themselves. Trump didn\u2019t invent it; he\u2019s not nearly enough of a very stable genius.\n\nIn the days after the 9/11 attacks, Republicans looked at the world and decided to see its enemies: an amorphous group of freedom-haters. Only Republicans could protect America from such global threats.\n\nBut in the absence of a torrent of al-Qaida insurgents at America\u2019s borders, the party rapidly switched to protecting America from Latinos. Once you unleash the politics of fear, you create the space for your own fear-peddling president.\n\nWhere you once pretended to be strong on terrorism, you now follow a president who just conspired with Turkey and Russia to revive Isis from near-death in Syria.\n\nWhere you once claimed Obamacare was an abuse of the constitution, you now support a president who claims that some part of the same founding document is phony.\n\nWhere you once claimed to defend freedom, you no longer have the freedom to speak your mind or your values. Unless you call yourself Pierre and join the cheese-eating surrender monkeys on Twitter.\n\nUntil now, Trump has assumed he can get away with murder because Republican senators will acquit him in an impeachment trial. That may be a reasonable assumption, even for someone as smart as Trump.\n\nBut there\u2019s one thing that Republican senators value, and it\u2019s not Trump\u2019s leadership or his personal charm. It\u2019s survival.\n\nAt some point, Mitch McConnell will look at the polls and his projected losses in the Senate and realise that there\u2019s something even worse than Trump unleashing his tweetbots in a Republican primary.\n\nFor now, the GOP is clinging on to a half-baked Trumpian deal: supporting their leader in exchange for him holding his fire and fury. But nobody seriously believes that Trump can stop the projectiles that barrel out of every orifice. Never mind the quid pro quo: this status quo is untenable.\n\n\u2022 Richard Wolffe is a Guardian US columnist\n\n", "description": "The president\u2019s increasingly risible attempts to paint himself as a victim are alienating even his most loyal supporters, says Guardian US columnist Richard Wolffe", "authors": ["Richard Wolffe"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a07e5ced0010f7dc02360d6fb6f5fd1842757b8b/0_99_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=ddf68eb961e0b1c9f3334530fe38b48a", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
