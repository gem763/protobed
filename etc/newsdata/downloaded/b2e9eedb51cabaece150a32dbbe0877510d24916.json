Another will combine hospitals and emergency services with the existing division that covers capacity planning and capital projects.\n\n\"The ministry is updating its internal structure to better align with and support the government's key health priorities,\" a government official told CBC News.\n\nGovernment sources tell CBC there will be no job losses as a result of the restructuring. In June, some 416 back-office workers were laid off amid the merger of 14 local health integration networks (LHINs) despite campaign promises by Doug Ford that there would be no job losses should his PCs form government.\n\nAmong the layoffs were communications, planning and financial services staff.\n\nThe province is consolidating 20 agencies, including the LHINs, Cancer Care Ontario, eHealth Ontario, among others, into a new agency called Ontario Health.\n\nThe bureaucratic changes come in the same month when new data showed average wait times at Ontario hospitals set a new June record this year. According to recent data from Health Quality Ontario, patients spent an average of 16.3 hours waiting in emergency rooms in June 2019, up from an average of 14.4 hours the previous June.", "description": "The changes will mean re-structuring some of the divisions within Ontario\u2019s health ministry bureaucracy.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5280531.1568288138!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/toronto-general-hospital-entrance.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
