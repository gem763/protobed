She created the 'Truckla' (pictured)\n\nWorking alongside Giertz on the project were YouTubers Richard Benoit and Laura Kampf, as well as mechanic Marcos Ramirez.\n\nIn a 31-minute video, Giertz documented the entire process, from buying the brand new $35,000 Model 3, to carving out the backseat and the trunk and installing the truck bed.\n\n'It's definitely the biggest project we've ever taken on,' Giertz explained in the video.\n\nGiertz showed the painstaking process of sawing off half of the Model 3's roof, body panels and trunk.\n\nAt one point, the team had to add reinforcement to the beams at the top of the truck, to prevent it from buckling in on itself.\n\nOther than that, however, the process went relatively smoothly.\n\nGiertz, known for her viral robot videos, worked with YouTubers Richard Benoit and Laura Kampf, as well as mechanic Marcos Ramirez, to construct the 'Truckla'\n\nMany pointed out that the finished product greatly resembles retro styles like the Chevy El Camino or Ford Ranchero, since it blends the look of a sedan and a pickup truck.\n\nAccording to Musk, Tesla's upcoming pickup truck is rumored to feature a 'cyberpunk' design that takes after sci-fi films.\n\nMusk expects to release the pickup truck sometime this summer.\n\nGiertz said in an Instagram post that she was 'tired of waiting' for Tesla to release its pickup truck, so she took matters into her own hands.\n\n'I really hope that people don\u2019t just think of this as an obnoxious YouTuber cutting up a brand new car,' Giertz said.\n\nIn a 31-minute video, Giertz documented the entire process, from buying the brand new $35,000 Model 3, to carving out the backseat and the trunk and installing the truck bed\n\nAs Giertz demonstrated in a fake promotional video of the Truckla, it drives perfectly well. She even got a speeding ticket on her first day taking it out for a spin\n\n'This process has destructive steps but the end goal is constructive.\n\n'And I\u2019m doing it because I really, really want this car. This is truly my dream car,' she added.\n\nAs Giertz demonstrated in a fake promotional video of the Truckla, it drives perfectly well.\n\nShe even got a speeding ticket on her first day taking it out for a spin, according to Mashable.", "description": "A YouTuber has managed to beat Elon Musk to the punch in releasing Tesla's first pickup truck.
