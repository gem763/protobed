And broadcasters are required by federal law not to censor candidate ads.\n\nIn fact, the ad that touched off this debate ran nearly 1,000 times on local TV stations in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.\n\nSo if people have a problem with Facebook\u2019s policy, they have a problem with the way political speech is protected in this country.\n\nSpeech from candidates and elected officials is already highly scrutinized; it\u2019s a good thing. But for that to happen, the public and the news media have to see it. In fact, if Facebook became the gatekeeper of truth, the first people to complain would be those who are complaining now \u2014 for good reason.\n\nOur policies don\u2019t mean that politicians can say whatever they want. They can\u2019t spread misinformation about where, when or how to vote, for example, or content that risks imminent harm or incites violence.\n\nIn other words, contrary to much of the criticism, it\u2019s not anything goes.\n\nOUR VIEW: Facebook doesn't have to run paid ads peddling politicians' lies\n\nAt Facebook's corporate headquarters campus in Menlo Park, California, on Oct. 23, 2019.

We disagree. Foreign interference and fake accounts are an intrusion into the electoral process that we\u2019ve been aggressively battling for three years. The other is content produced by political candidates, who have to put their name on everything they say.\n\nWe realize not everyone agrees with our decision, and we welcome that debate. But fundamentally we believe that, in a democracy, it\u2019s better to let voters make their own decisions, not companies like Facebook.\n\nKatie Harbath is Facebook\u2019s public policy director, global elections.
