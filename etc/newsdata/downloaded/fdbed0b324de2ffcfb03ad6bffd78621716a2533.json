The drama of Saturday\u2019s last-gasp victory over a stubborn Leicester City had got the better of him.\n\nBut who could blame him? In the current climate, draws are the new defeats. Defeats represent full-scale disaster. Liverpool\u2019s battle with Manchester City over the last year-and-a-bit has been like that film about a bus that had to speed around a city, keeping its speed over fifty, and if its speed dropped it would explode. This is \u2018The Title Challenge That Couldn\u2019t Slow Down\u2019.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

There were times during the win over Leicester \u2013 particularly between James Maddison\u2019s late equaliser and Milner\u2019s even-later penalty \u2013 when you had to remind yourself that there are not eight games to go but a full eight months. The same anxious, expectant energy that filled Anfield during the spring survived the summer. It is now October. It is still there.\n\nIt shows not sign of abating, not even after Liverpool\u2019s eighth consecutive win of the season was followed by City\u2019s second defeat \u2013 unexpectedly, at home and at the hands of Wolverhampton Wanderers. The eight-point lead Klopp\u2019s side established on Saturday afternoon was still an eight-point lead by Sunday evening. You feel that will only cause more anxiety, more agitation, more hope and more excitement.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Every game is important, every point significant, any slip-up damaging. \u201cIt\u2019s true. It\u2019s our life,\u201d Klopp said on Saturday, when this was put to him. \u201cThat\u2019s how it is. All or nothing.\u201d He was speaking before City\u2019s defeat but even with the champions struggling, it is likely that Liverpool will need a lot of points. More than 90, probably. They need to be close to perfect.\n\nThe fear on a match day at Anfield is that they will fall short once more. It was there before Maddison\u2019s equaliser on Saturday, in the palpable unease around the ground. It was there after it, in the desperate search for a winning goal. It was still there following Milner\u2019s penalty, when one Liverpool official sat in the press seats clasped his hands and held them closely to his mouth, almost in prayer that there would be no further twist.\n\nFrom here, City\u2019s best hope of retaining their crown may be that Klopp, his players or even just the Anfield crowd collapse under the weight of this nervous energy, exhausted by it. Think back to the 83 seconds that Liverpool spent with a two-point lead at the top of the table on the final day of last season. Those moments were filled with confusion, bewilderment and chaotic joy. It was not entirely helpful.\n\nAnd then there is the fact that, at this stage, eight points is hardly too big a gap to bridge. City closed a seven-point margin with less time on the board last season. Others will remember how Manchester United were nine clear at this point during the 1985-86 campaign. Liverpool would win their 16th league title that year, finishing 12 points clear of Ron Atkinson\u2019s early pace-setters.\n\nBut times change, expectations shift and the significance of City\u2019s poor start should not be underplayed. It comes in a climate where every minor setback is a costly one and only three points each week is deemed good enough. That is the near-impossible standard Pep Guardiola\u2019s side have set over their last two marvellous title-winning campaigns. It is one that Liverpool \u2013 and at the moment, only Liverpool \u2013 are matching.", "description": "Shortly after the final whistle had sounded at Anfield, not long since James Milner\u2019s match-winning penalty, Jurgen Klopp strode up in front of his supporters and performed the \u2018fist pumps\u2019: three air punches aimed indiscriminately into the Kop, who absorb each blow and respond with a short, sharp roar.", "authors": ["Mark Critchley"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/06/20/Sadio-Mane.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
