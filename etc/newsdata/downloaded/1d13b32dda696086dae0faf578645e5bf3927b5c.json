France notably does not want to approve any extension without a clear political shift in London, while the U.K. parliament is apparently unable to muster the two-thirds majority needed to set a general election unless and until the EU27 approve an extension.\n\n\"What happens if for some reason we don\u2019t have clarity even on Monday?\" \u2014 EU diplomat\n\nIt is a bizarre game of chicken, in which the two sides are not actually racing toward each other, and a head-on collision, but rather stuck in a freeze-frame as the end of a mountain road with no guardrails rushes toward them.\n\nWhile each side waits for the other to move, the deadlock stands to worsen.\n\nJohnson has set up a vote in the House of Commons on Monday on the question of whether to hold a December 12 snap election. If opposition parties block it, that would give further evidence to French President Emmanuel Macron and others in the EU advocating a tougher stance who say the political situation in London is paralyzed, and therefore Brussels must apply maximum pressure.\n\nBut a short extension of the October 31 deadline \u2014 perhaps to November 15 \u2014 would offer no guarantee of breaking the logjam and the EU could find itself forced to grant a series of short delays that neither yield ratification of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement nor leave time for a British election campaign.\n\nBy that view, the best the EU could do is wait until close to the current witching hour on Thursday night \u2014 Halloween \u2014 to see if Westminster blinks. But waiting that long also carries risks.\n\nCouncil President Donald Tusk had hoped to avoid this by pushing urgently for approval of an extension the moment that it became clear on Tuesday that the legislative process in Westminster had stalled.\n\nOfficials ultimately expect leaders to step in to prevent a no-deal catastrophe, but the continuing uncertainty with less than a week before the deadline has left them more anxious than at any point in the nearly three years of negotiations.\n\nAfter the roughly two-hour meeting of EU diplomats on Friday morning, officials said that no matter the risks it would be absurd for the bloc to do anything before the outcome of Monday's vote in Westminster. And yet, officials acknowledged there was a continuing danger that the situation would only grow more difficult.\n\n\"The fear I see is that Monday could be too late, it would be the 28th, we would have only three days left,\" one EU diplomat said. \"What happens if for some reason we don\u2019t have clarity even on Monday?\u201d\n\n\"We're up for an election, but we want commitments on the deal and we want to know exactly what the EU is saying about an extension\" \u2014 Diane Abbott, UK shadow home secretary\n\nIn the U.K., the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, has said repeatedly that he wants clarity from Brussels before agreeing to back a snap election.\n\nDiane Abbott, Labour's shadow home secretary, speaking on the BBC's \"Today\" program on Friday morning, said: \"We're up for an election, but we want commitments on the deal and we want to know exactly what the EU is saying about an extension.\"\n\nSam Gyimah, a Liberal Democrat MP, speaking to Sky News on Friday morning, said that his party would consider a snap election if it could not secure agreement on a new referendum. \"Obviously we will look at an election,\" he said. \"But what we have said is we need to first of all see what extension the EU grants. And the prime minister has been lobbying the EU to not give an extension to January 31 so it's a very confused picture.\"\n\nThe confusion stands to continue until next week.", "description": "The EU has postponed a decision on a Brexit extension until Monday or Tuesday.", "authors": ["David M.
