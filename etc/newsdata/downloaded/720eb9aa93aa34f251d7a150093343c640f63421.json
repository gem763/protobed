The bill will be voted upon on Tuesday evening.\n\nLabour is expected to try and amend the bill to move the election to an earlier date in December. On Monday, Corbyn expressed concern that the December 12 date risked disenfranchising students, and said that parts of the country would be dark by 4 p.m.\n\nThe Liberal Democrats and Scottish National Party have also said they are willing to back an election, but insist that the poll should be held on December 9. The U.K. parliament will have to be dissolved this Friday for an election to take place on that date.\n\nIf the bill goes through, it will be the first U.K. election to take place in December since 1923.", "description": "\u2018Our condition of taking no deal off the table has now been met,\u2019 says Jeremy Corbyn.", "authors": ["Eleni Courea"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1176827984-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
