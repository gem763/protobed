REUTERS/Dinuka Liyanawatte/File Photo\n\nCentral bank chief Indrajit Coomaraswamy told Reuters after the last policy rate decision that it \u201cis extremely unlikely to reduce\u201d the key monetary policy rates before presidential elections to be held on Nov. 16.\n\nAll 13 economists surveyed by Reuters expected the CentralBank of Sri Lanka to keep both its standing deposit facilityrate (SDFR) and standing lending facility rate (SLFR) steady at7.00% and 8.00%, respectively. All predicted the statutory reserve ratio (SRR) would also be kept at 5.00%.\n\nThe central bank has loosened policy in several steps to boost sluggish growth after tourism and investments plummeted in Sri Lanka following deadly Easter Day bomb attacks by Islamist militants\n\nThe central bank cut rates by 100 bps in two meetings since May, reduced the SRR by 250 bps, releasing around 150 billion rupees ($832 million) of liquidity to the financial market. It also imposed caps on rupee deposit interest rates that enabled banks to reduce the cost of mobilising funds from the general public.\n\nAs a result, the commercial banks\u2019 average weighted prime lending rate (AWPR) has fallen 136 basis points as of Oct. 2.\n\nThe Monetary Board last month ordered banks to reduce interest rates on all rupee denominated loans by at least 200 basis points by Oct. 15, from levels in April.\n\n\u201cSince the central bank\u2019s objective of reducing market lending rates are expected to take effect with lending rate caps, another rate cut is unwarranted,\u201d said Danushka Samarasinghe, CEO at Softlogic Capital Markets.\n\nThe rate cuts have already put pressure on the rupee currency LKR=LK, which has fallen 2.2% amid foreign outflows from government securities.\n\nThe attacks on luxury hotels and churches on April 21 killed more than 250 people, and private sector credit growth remains sluggish.\n\nThe island nation\u2019s economic growth eased to a 17-year low of 3.2% in 2018 and the IMF expects the pace to slow to 2.7% this year. A Reuters poll has predicted 2019 growth will be the lowest in nearly two decades.,\n\nThe government\u2019s finances, meanwhile, remain under pressure with a heavy external debt repayment schedule between 2019 and 2022.", "description": "Sri Lanka's central bank will likely leave its key interest rates on hold at a policy review on Friday, after a 50-basis-point cut in August, a Reuters poll showed, ahead of presidential elections and as lower bank rates go into effect.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438735200&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF980DR", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
