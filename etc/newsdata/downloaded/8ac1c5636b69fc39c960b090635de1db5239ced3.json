REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\n\nTORONTO (Reuters) - Walking the red carpet ahead of the world premiere of \u201cThe Sky is Pink\u201d at the Toronto International Film Festival on Friday, actress Priyanka Chopra Jonas contrasted her life while filming with the experiences of the characters in the movie.\n\nThe Hindi-language film tells the true story of the Chaudhury family, narrated by their deceased teenaged daughter, Aisha, played by Zaira Wasim.\n\nIt chronicles the practical, emotional and relationship struggles faced by Aisha\u2019s parents Aditi and Niren, portrayed by Chopra Jonas and Farhan Akthar, as she fights, and ultimately succumbs to, a rare genetic terminal illness that took her older sister\u2019s life decades earlier.\n\n\u201cIt was a really hard juxtaposition of real life for me,\u201d Chopra Jones told Reuters. \u201cEspecially because I was getting married and at the same time this film deals with loss, loss of a child, which is such an unnatural way of being.\u201d\n\nShe added that, although the experience \u201cwas very trying,\u201d the support of husband, Nick Jonas, whom she married in December, helped.\n\nThe real-life Aisha Chaudhury died on Jan. 24, 2015, at 18, the day after her book, \u201cMy Little Epiphanies,\u201d was published. \u201cThe Sky is Pink\u201d ends with photographs and video clips of the real Chaudhury family living the moments depicted in the film, including a TEDx talk Aisha gave in India in 2014.\n\n\u201cYou ... have to be very strong as partners to go through what they went through,\u201d Akhtar said on the red carpet. He added he tried to \u201capproach this part with a lot of ... respect, and make sure that the dignity and grace that they\u2019ve shown in real life comes through in the performance in the film.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Sky is Pink\u201d was directed by Shonali Bose, who herself lost her 16-year-old son suddenly in an accident at the family\u2019s Los Angeles home in 2010.\n\nThe film will debut in theatres on Oct. 11.", "description": "Walking the red carpet ahead of the world premiere of \"The Sky is Pink\" at the Toronto International Film Festival on Friday, actress Priyanka Chopra Jonas contrasted her life while filming with the experiences of the characters in the movie.", "authors": ["Nichola Saminather", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190914&t=2&i=1429648982&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8D00N", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
