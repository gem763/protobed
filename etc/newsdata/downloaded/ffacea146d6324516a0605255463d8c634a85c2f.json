I did not and would not ever participate in such undertakings.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., declared a formal impeachment inquiry Sept. 24 after reports about a July 25 call when Trump urged Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden. Trump has called the investigation a partisan witch hunt and said he was absolutely justified in urging Zelensky to fight corruption.\n\nSondland said he considered Zelensky a reformer with a strong mandate from voters, but that he was told at a May 23 White House briefing that Trump was skeptical about whether he would fight corruption. Sondland said a call and meeting between Trump and Zelensky, who was elected April 21, would be postponed, while the ambassador was told to consult with Giuliani.\n\nBut Sondland said he didn't understand until months later that Giuliani's agenda included urging Ukraine to investigate Biden and his son Hunter. Sondland said he didn't participate in Trump's call July 25 or learn of the contents until a summary was released Sept. 25.\n\n\"It was apparent to all of us that the key to changing the president's mind on Ukraine was Mr. Giuliani,\" Sondland said. \"Our view was that the men and women of the State Department, not the president's personal lawyer, should take responsibility for all aspects of U.S. foreign policy toward Ukraine.\"\n\nUS Ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland addresses the media during a press conference at the US Embassy to Romania in Bucharest on on Sept. 5, 2019. More\n\nSondland said he conferred with Giuliani under the president's direction. During phone conversations, Giuliani mentioned possible interference in the 2016 election and urged an investigation of Burisma, the Ukrainian energy company where Hunter Biden served as a director. But Sondland said he wasn't aware of the Biden connection to the firm.\n\n\"I do not recall that Mr. Giuliani discussed former Vice President Biden or his son Hunter Biden with me,\" Sondland said, adding \"nor do I recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation of the Bidens.\"\n\nSondland said on Sept. 9, after the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, William Taylor, raised concerns about linking military aid to the investigations, he called Trump.\n\n\"What do you want from Ukraine?\" Sondland said he asked.\n\n\"Nothing. There is no quid pro quo,\" Trump replied, according to Sondland. \"And as I recall, the president was in a bad mood.\"\n\nSondland's deposition under subpoena comes more than a week after the State Department blocked his voluntary appearance before the panels on Oct. 8. The marching orders came the same day the White House notified Pelosi that the administration wouldn\u2019t cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. Trump tweeted that he didn\u2019t want Sondland to go before a \u201ckangaroo court.\u201d", "description": "Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, testifies in House impeachment inquiry about President Trump's policy in Ukraine", "authors": ["Bart Jansen", "Nicholas Wu", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yQBBdv5dBtNe8ME9IR9l.g--~B/aD00NTc5O3c9MzM4NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/92eaefa14b15832e74d20cfbdd0364b2", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
