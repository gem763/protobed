The site includes Google Maps-based search for resources like recovery support meetings and pharmacies that offer Naloxone without a prescription \u2014 it\u2019s a drug that can be used to counteract opioid overdoses. The new site will be linked under the search bar on Google\u2019s most valuable real estate: its home page.\n\nThe company says that it\u2019s partnering with the Recovery Resource Hub to fill out its maps. Vetted sources are especially important in rehab, where scams can run rampant. Google itself ran afoul of those problems in 2017, when we reported on how rampant scams were in Google\u2019s own search results. Google cracked down, banning many rehab ads, though it allowed vetted ones back onto the Google homepage beginning in April 2018.\n\nThe new page Google is launching today won\u2019t feature ads, instead offering basic information on recovery, treatment, and prevention \u2014 with links to trusted resources.\n\nGoogle used to famously refuse to put anything but a logo, a search box, and a button or two on its homepage. That\u2019s changed in recent years, but a homepage promotion is still rare enough to be notable. Google says a link to its new site will appear underneath the search box. It says it\u2019s launching in honor of the 30th annual National Recovery Month.\n\nEven if the site is partially (or even mostly) meant as a PR move to make up for how badly it let itself get gamed by scammers in 2017, it still seems like a good starting point for people looking for help with addiction. It\u2019s certainly more useful than a Google search for \u201crehab,\u201d which as of this writing puts three or four ads at the top before the actual search results.", "description": "Google is launching a new website it\u2019s calling \"Recover Together\" that collates resources for addiction recovery in the United States.
