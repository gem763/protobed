The company launched new iPhones a few months ahead of the critical holiday season, as it has done every fall since 2011. The new iPhone 11 models feature faster chips, better cameras, and longer-lasting batteries than the 2018 models \u2014 solid improvements, but not a revolution. The most important announcement Apple made on Tuesday was about price. Two years after Apple broke new high-end ground with its first $1000 iPhone, Apple reduced the price of its least expensive current-year iPhone. When the iPhone 11 goes on sale for $699, it will be $50 less than the phone it's replacing, the iPhone XR. The iPhone price decrease gives Apple a new way to get new customers into its system of connected products. It's a move that makes sense as iPhone unit sales peaked in 2015 and haven't fully recovered. (Apple doesn't even report iPhone unit sales anymore.) The online services Apple launched on Tuesday were also lower in price than expected, and give Apple a way to entice new customers with content that's more expensive or impossible to get elsewhere.\n\nNot everyone needs all the bells and whistles\n\n$699 for the iPhone 11 is a significant price drop, especially after Apple raised the price of its second-best new phone from $699 for the iPhone 8 in 2017 to $749 for the XR last year. Apple's high-end phones, the \"Pro\" models, still start at $999 and $1099. The new iPhone 11 has a better camera than last year, and a faster processor, but most people will never notice the difference. Smartphone cameras have been very good for a few years and while some apps need a lot of processing power, some of the most common apps, like Facebook, or Snapchat, or Uber, don't.\n\nApple also dropped the price of last year's iPhone XR to $599, showing how price drops can trickle down the lineup as Apple likes to keep older phones around as low-cost models. That's exactly what it's doing with its Watch hardware, too. Apple's newest watch, the Series 5, sports a screen you don't have to turn on to check the time, the more important announcement might be that that Apple is now selling the 2-year-old Series 3 for $199 \u2014 much closer to an impulse buy than the $399 or $499 for the new models. \"While it doesn't have all the bells and whistles as Watch 5, it will attract many first-time buyers,\" Moor Insights analyst Patrick Moorhead said in a DM.\n\nServices surprise on price", "description": "Two years after Apple broke new high-end ground with its first $1000 iPhone, Apple has reduced the price of its least expensive current iPhone.", "authors": ["Kif Leswing"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106122220-1568137824593iphone11.png?v=1568152679", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
