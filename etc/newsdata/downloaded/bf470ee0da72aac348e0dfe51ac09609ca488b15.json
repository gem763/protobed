Reminder: There are 102 days until the Iowa caucuses and 376 days until the 2020 election.\n\nCould Bernie Sanders win the Democratic presidential nomination \u2026 for Joe Biden?\n\nIn the wake of his heart attack earlier in October, observers questioned whether the Vermont senator had the strength and stamina to continue his campaign. They wondered whether his supporters, citing concerns about his health, age (78) and ability to defeat Donald Trump, might abandon ship. And they predicted that, along with a declining Biden, a weakened Sanders would put Elizabeth Warren on a glide path to the nomination.\n\nNot so much.\n\nFar from fading away, Sanders has actually gained ground in the RealClearPolitics national polling average since returning to the trail, climbing from a low of 14.3 percent after his hospitalization back to his pre-heart-attack average just above 17 percent. One new survey by Emerson College shows him gaining 3 points (to 25 percent) since September, passing Warren (at 21 percent) for second place and nipping at Biden\u2019s heels.\n\nAs Sanders himself put it last Saturday during a 26,000-person rally in Queens, N.Y., \u201cI am back,\u201d and \u201cmore than ready \u2014 more ready than ever \u2014 to carry on with you on the epic struggle that we face today.\u201d\n\nThis, of course, is good news for Bernie and his fans. But it may be bad news for his fellow left-winger Warren \u2014 and for the left in general.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders speaks at the \u201cBernie\u2019s Back\u201d rally in Queens, N.Y., on Oct. 19.

Since plummeting from a post-announcement high of 40-plus percent last spring, his national average has basically oscillated within a narrow range of 26 to 30 percent. A new CNN survey puts the former vice president at 34 percent, up from 24 percent in September. In contrast, Warren and Sanders show no movement since September, trailing at 19 and 16 percent, respectively.\n\nThe math is fairly simple. The longer the left is divided between two strong candidates, the less support Biden needs to remain in the lead.\n\nSo why is it Sanders who risks playing the spoiler, and not Warren?\n\nBecause polls also show that Sanders has less room than Warren to increase his support and overtake Biden. According to political scientists Seth Masket and Dave Peterson, \u201cOne of the most notable features of this primary field is just how many people don\u2019t want to see Sanders as the nominee even though he\u2019s currently third in the national polls.\u201d When Masket asked early-state Democratic activists who they don\u2019t want the nominee to be, 59 percent said Sanders; only Tulsi Gabbard and Miramar, Fla., Mayor Wayne Messam attracted more opposition. And when Peterson asked the same question of likely Iowa caucus-goers in an Iowa State University/Civiqs poll, 25 percent said Sanders \u2014 the second-worst showing in the field. Among Iowans who didn\u2019t back Sanders in 2016, meanwhile, less than 1 percent wanted to see him become the nominee in 2020, and a third specifically did not want to see him nominated. \u201cThe suggestion here is that Sanders is a factional candidate,\u201d conclude Masket and Peterson. \u201cA specific set of Democrats are very excited about him, but he has limited ability to expand that coalition into a broader base of support.\u201d Case in point: Since Biden entered the race, Sanders has never cracked 19 percent in the RealClearPolitics national polling average.", "description": "Sanders has actually gained ground in national polling averages since returning to the trail after his heart attack.
