This is shameful and cannot stand,\u201d Malinowski, a Democrat, said in a tweet.\n\nThe NBA said it recognised Morey\u2019s views have \u201cdeeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together,\u201d it said.\n\nJosh Hawley, a Republican senator from Missouri, made references to allegations of human rights abuses in China, including the repression of Uighur Muslims.\n\n\u201cChinese govt has a million people locked in concentration camps & is trying to brutally repress Hong Kong demonstrators - and NBA wants to \u201cbridge cultural divides\u201d? Cultural divides?\u201d\n\nThe Rockets, playing games in Japan, could not immediately be reached for comment.", "description": "U.S. lawmakers joined a chorus of criticism of the National Basketball Association (NBA) after the organisation distanced itself from a tweet by the manager of the Houston Rockets in support of the Hong Kong protests for democracy.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
