REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas/File photo\n\n\u201cWe are in fairly advanced level of talks right now and it is close to being a done deal,\u201d Ravneet Gill, chief executive and managing director of the corporate and retail bank, told Reuters in an interview.\n\nGill said the stake sale was likely to be less than 10% initially but could rise, describing the buyer as one of the world\u2019s top three technology companies that had not previously invested in a bank. He did not name the investor.\n\nThe board has given India\u2019s fourth largest private lender the go ahead to raise more growth capital. The bank has approval to raise $1.3 billion but aims to bring in an additional $1 billion to $1.2 billion via a preferential allotment.\n\nUnder Indian central bank rules, an individual shareholder cannot hold more than 15% in a bank.\n\nGill said that \u201c15% at the current market cap is not much but hopefully we will tranche the deal and as the price goes up that amount that we get for the deal will also go up.\u201d\n\nShares in Yes Bank closed on Monday at 63 rupees, 77% below trading levels at the start of the financial year on April 1. The bank has said the tech investment would help restore investor confidence in the stock.\n\nIndian markets are closed on Tuesday for a public holiday.\n\nIn addition to the tech investor, smaller investors could pump in about $200 million to $250 million, Gill said.\n\n\u201cThere are two very large Indian family offices, there is a European and also an American private equity firm that have expressed interest,\u201d he added.\n\nIn August, the bank raised nearly $275 million via qualified institutional placement (QIP), a capital-raising tool commonly used in India, to improve its capital adequacy ratio.\n\nYes Bank\u2019s common equity tier 1 capital at the end of June stood at 8%, marginally above the regulatory requirement of 7.375%. After the QIP, the ratio improved to 8.6%.\n\nGross non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans spiked to 5.01% at the end of June, weighing on the lender.\n\n($1 = 71.7340 Indian rupees)", "description": "Yes Bank is close to securing a deal to sell a minority stake to a global technology company to help boost the Indian private lender's capital, the bank's CEO said.", "authors": ["Nupur Anand", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190910&t=2&i=1428240314&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF890K9", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
