Giuliani has claimed without evidence that when Biden was vice president he attempted to block an investigation into a Ukrainian energy company whose board of directors included Hunter Biden.\n\nTrump is the now the target of an impeachment inquiry for his phone call in July with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump pressed the foreign leader to launch a Biden investigation while holding up military funds to the nation.\n\nGiuliani has also claimed \u2014 again without evidence \u2014 that information that led to criminal charges against Trump\u2019s former campaign manager Paul Manafort were part of a Democratic plot to interfere with the 2016 election. Manafort is serving seven years in prison on a variety of charges, including federal fraud and conspiracy offenses.\n\nGiuliani told CNN that his work for the president would be protected by attorney-client privilege \u2014 even though he has already discussed much of his work on behalf of Trump in Ukraine on national TV.\n\nGiuliani said he hasn\u2019t discussed with Trump the possibility of testifying, nor has anyone in the House contracted him about doing so.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee member Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) told CNN on Friday that he has several questions for Giuliani, including if he has a security clearance.\n\n\u201cRudy may be the best source of information because he doesn\u2019t know what he shouldn\u2019t say,\u201d said Quigley.", "description": "A member of the House Intelligence Committee says Giuliani could be the best witness because he \"doesn't know what he shouldn't say.\"", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d8f11ed2100003700fcb92b.jpeg?cache=tfgw44trco&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
