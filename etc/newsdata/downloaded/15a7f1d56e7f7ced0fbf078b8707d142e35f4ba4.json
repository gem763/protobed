This misses out on lots of people who didn't happen to work from home that particular week but do sometimes. A 2016 Gallup survey found that 43 per cent of American employees worked remotely at least occasionally. The European Union's Eurostat tracks whether people work at home \"usually\" or \"sometimes\", and over the past decade the former group hasn't grown as a share of the EU workforce but the latter has.\n\nFor businesses, and those who work from home, the trend toward remote work seems all to the good. Multiple studies have shown that employees who are given the opportunity to work from home are more productive and happier with their jobs. They also can save a lot of time and money on commuting. (And yes, I am in fact typing these words at home. Thank you for asking.)\n\nSome at-home workers get to live in really great places, too. They can be found everywhere, but in the US they are more likely to be found in metropolitan areas with pretty mountains (the Kingston, New York, metro area includes much of the Catskills).\n\nYou have to wonder a little, though, about what this means for all the people who can't work from home. Those who can tend to either make a lot of money or not need to make a lot of money. At least, that's one reading of this data:\n\nMy thinking here is that most of those making less than $US15,000 a year are part-timers looking to supplement the family income with occasional online gig work. Those making $US75,000 or more are \u2026 making $US75,000 or more. While I realise that may not sound like much to some readers, only 20.6 per cent of US workers earned $US75,000 or more in 2018. Work-at-home arrangements seem much harder to come by for those in the working class. Adam Ozimek, the chief economist at Upwork, an online marketplace for remote work, reports that working at home has been growing by far the fastest among those with college degrees.Working at home also appears to be kind of a white people thing, as blacks and Hispanics are far less likely to do it.\n\nNone of this is working-at-home's fault! These disparities reflect socioeconomic conditions that long predated remote work. But one can easily see how the rise of working at home might undermine support for new infrastructure investment, housing construction in expensive cities and other things that just don't matter quite so much to those who can telecommute. On the other hand, if loosening the bonds between jobs and locations makes cities and states focus more on making themselves attractive to workers than on offering big tax incentives to would-be employers, that seems like a positive. The rise of remote work is going to change lots of things. It's just not clear what all of them are yet.\n\nJustin Fox is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering business.
