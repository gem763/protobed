REUTERS/Anna Ringstrom/File Photo\n\nA spokesman for North Korea\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement carried by state media on Sunday Washington had until the end of 2019 to come up with a \u201cnew calculation method\u201d.\n\nDespite being a potentially important deadline, North Korea has shared few details on what exactly might happen if it is missed. Here is what we know - and don\u2019t know - about the looming deadline.\n\nKIM JONG UN\u2019S DEADLINE\n\nThe deadline was first set by Kim in April, when talks were stalled in the wake of a failed summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Hanoi two months earlier.\n\nKim said in a speech to the Supreme People\u2019s Assembly he would wait until the end of the year for the United States to decide to be more flexible.\n\nIn a report on that speech, state news agency KCNA quoted Kim as saying: \u201cIt is essential for the U.S. to quit its current calculation method and approach us with a new one.\u201d\n\nTrump and Kim have met three times: in Singapore last year, in Hanoi in February, and at the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea in June.\n\nThey built personal goodwill at those meetings and in a number of letters but they have failed to agree on a deal to lift sanctions in exchange for North Korea abandoning its nuclear and missile programmes.\n\nWHAT DOES THE DEADLINE MEAN?\n\nAt the time, Kim suggested that the deadlock in talks with the United States had made him question his self-imposed moratorium on testing nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles.\n\nOther North Korean officials have also hinted that a lack of progress in talks with the United States could mean a return to such tests, but Pyongyang has otherwise been vague in describing the deadline.\n\n\u201cWe really don\u2019t know what the North Koreans will do once their end-of-year deadline passes,\u201d said Daniel DePetris, a fellow at Defense Priorities, a Washington-based think tank.\n\nNorth Korea bristled when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo played down the deadline.\n\n\u201cThe meaning is that the U.S. should get rid of the root cause that pushed us into a nuclear state and obstacles on the way to denuclearisation by its own hands; otherwise no one can predict how the situation on the Korean peninsula will turn out,\u201d a North Korean foreign ministry official said in April.\n\nWHY THE END OF THE YEAR?\n\nKim did not explain why he chose the end of 2019 as the deadline.\n\nAnalysts say there is no obvious reason beyond Kim\u2019s annual New Year\u2019s address, when the North Korean leader often makes major announcements and sets goals.\n\nFor example, Kim used his New Year\u2019s speech at the beginning of 2018 to reverse a year of fiery rhetoric and signal an interest in engaging with South Korea.\n\nKim then used his 2019 New Year\u2019s speech to warn that North Korea might be \u201ccompelled to explore a new path\u201d to defend its sovereignty if the United States \u201cseeks to force something upon us unilaterally ... and remains unchanged in its sanctions and pressure.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un meet at the start of their summit at the Capella Hotel on the resort island of Sentosa, Singapore June 12, 2018.
