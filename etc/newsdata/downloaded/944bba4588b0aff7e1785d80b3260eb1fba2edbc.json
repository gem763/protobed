The list of government officials who could review a memo of the call\u2019s contents was culled. Fewer copies of transcripts went to agencies, and they were stamped with \u201cEYES ONLY DO NOT COPY.\u201d And some officials who deliver call memos had to sign for the records to create a custody record if they were to leak, according to people familiar with the moves who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe them.\n\nAt one point in 2018, Defense Department officials were asked to send back transcripts of calls to the White House after Trump aides grew worried they could be disclosed, according to former senior administration officials\u2026\n\nFour former U.S. officials \u2014 including aides in previous administrations and the Trump administration \u2014 said they were not aware of any calls that did not contain highly classified information being housed in this type of storage system. One former Trump administration official said such calls were sometimes kept on the \u201chigh side,\u201d only available to aides with high clearances and separate computers, but not the secure system the whistleblower alleges was used. \u201cNever heard of anything like that,\u201d said this official, who was privy to some of Trump\u2019s calls with foreign leaders.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Politics Effort-To-Shield-Trumps-Call-With-Ukrainian-Leader-Was-Part-Of-Broader-Secrecy-Effort"], "top_image": ""}
