For us, he was a fellow combatant and a leader who would never abandon our struggle for liberation,\u201d Mbeki said.\n\n\n\nHe even turned populist and sounded like an unkempt Andile Mngxitama when he pronounced that South Africa had protected Mugabe from international pressure because \u201cthere is nobody who is going to come from London and decide for Zimbabweans how they should govern\u201d.\n\nOne of the litany of lies that were peddled about Mugabe in the wake of his death was that he was a good friend of the ANC and an accommodating host of exiles living in that country, but it is a well-known fact that he was hostile to the country\u2019s main liberation movement, preferring the obscure Pan Africanist Congress instead.\n\nBut the biggest lie told by Mbeki, perhaps to justify his ineffectual \u201cquiet diplomacy\u201d approach to the Zimbabwean crisis, was that Mugabe decided to delay land reform in that country by a decade to not scare South Africa\u2019s white rulers off from negotiating an end to apartheid.\n\n\u201cThe land reform process was delayed in Zimbabwe for at least a decade. It was done in order for us to complete our negotiations,\u201d said the man who valiantly defended the dictator as he was erasing the words \u2018democracy\u2019, \u2018human rights\u2019 and \u2018constitutionalism\u2019 from the Zimbabwean dictionary.\n\nBut we should not be shocked by the sanctification of this evil man.\n\nThat is what humans do, mostly in the spirit of it not being right to speak ill of the dead.\n\nEven the great pilferer Josiah \u201cFingers\u201d Rabotapi was hailed as a \u201cchild of God\u201d at his funeral in the late 1990s.\n\nWhich brings us to another man who seems to be on a crusade to ensure that the obituaries and orations that will follow his passing will be glowing.\n\nThat man, Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, has been at pains to tell the world that he is the real architect of democratic South Africa.\n\nHaving finally handed over the reins after a 44-year tenure as leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party, Buthelezi now wants to craft a narrative for his legacy that is grossly at odds with reality.\n\nAnd, as the human condition that makes us lie about those who have moved on kicks in, he will have succeeded.\n\nBut the biggest lie told by Mbeki, perhaps to justify his ineffectual \u201cquiet diplomacy\u201d approach to the Zimbabwean crisis, was that Mugabe decided to delay land reform in that country by a decade to not scare South Africa\u2019s white rulers off from negotiating an end to apartheid.\n\nWhat makes his case worse is that the powerful and prominent in our body politic have already started lying about him.\n\nThey did so in Parliament a few years ago when Buthelezi announced that he would be quitting as an MP, only to return to his seat and remain there to this day.\n\nIn speeches in the National Assembly, leaders who very well know his murderous ways praised his contribution to the birth of democratic South Africa and his role in the maturing of the republic.\n\nWhen he turned 90 last year, this lying fest continued, with the man whose every finger drips with the blood of activists and freedom fighters being showered with praise.\n\nWhile it is correct to wish him a long life, it is best we tell him while he is alive that his real legacy is not the one that lives in his head.\n\nThe more we allow Buthelezi to dictate how he should be remembered, the more we are likely to fall into the trap of painting him as a servant of the revolution when he is gone.\n\nHe should be reminded while he is alive that he was an apartheid collaborator, a Bantustan leader and a puppet of successive apartheid governments.\n\nButhelezi should be reminded of the thousands and thousands of widows and orphans left behind by his death squads and impis; of the mothers and fathers who had to bury their children killed in his name.\n\nHe must be reminded of the merciless massacres inside train coaches in the early 1990s.\n\nAs he navigates his last years on the planet, the names of Boipatong, Trust Feed, KwaMakhutha, Swanieville and many more massacres that were carried out by his men must ring in his head and the bloodied corpses must always flash across his eyes.", "description": "What exactly is it about us humans that makes us feel compelled to tell glowing lies about dead people?", "authors": ["Mondli Makhanya"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8058/23d69e8d9bfd4054baf2db62170969f9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
