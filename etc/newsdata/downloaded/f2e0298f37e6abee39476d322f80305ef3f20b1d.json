Jamie Raskin told reporters after a roughly one-hour meeting with the inspector general.\n\nThe Maryland Democrat was the only lawmaker who attended the staff briefing, emerging with the packet containing unclassified information \u2014 not yet publicly released \u2014 that raised more questions than answers.\n\nHowever, Sen. Bob Menendez, New Jersey Democrat, who later reviewed the information, confirmed it contained \u201clong debunked and false statements.\u201d\n\nIt was addressed to Mr. Pompeo with \u201cThe White House\u201d listed as the address, though Mr. Raskin acknowledged anyone could have written it.\n\nMr. Raskin noted that the documents did not look like White House stationery, but said Trump Hotel folders were used to hold the papers.\n\nFormer Ukrainian Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch and the Biden family \u2014 main figures in the whistleblower report that sparked the impeachment investigation against the president \u2014 were mentioned in the conspiracies.\n\nMr. Raskin suggested that President Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, should be asked if he had any information about the package.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know where it came from. It is pretty clear whoever put it together was attempting to advance exactly the storyline that Mr. Giuliani would like to do,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s my interpretation,\u201d he added. \u201cIn other words, if you read the packet of information, it\u2019s a series of somewhat hallucinatory propagandistic suggestions that are very consistent with the things Mr. Giuliani has been saying.\u201d\n\nBut when pressed, Mr. Raskin backed away from directly pointing a finger at Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Pompeo, saying it was his interpretation.\n\nThe inspector general did not suggest that Mr. Pompeo had anything to do with the packet\u2019s origins.\n\nHowever, both Mr. Raskin and Mr. Menendez said the secretary\u2019s role in disseminating the packet needed to be better understood.\n\nMr. Linick passed along the information to the FBI, though he did not say what the agency did with it, Mr. Raskin said.\n\nMr. Linick, who \u201csat on the information for months,\u201d according to Mr. Raskin, also could still be investigating the matter.\n\nDespite the number of wild questions the packet posed, Mr. Raskin didn\u2019t believe the contents were urgent in light of Congress\u2019 investigation into President Trump\u2019s interactions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\n\u201cFrom our perspective all of it is completely and totally irrelevant. This is an irrelevant distraction from the matter at hand,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, the chairs of House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight committees felt the packet was a graver issue, illustrating that the administration tried to \u201cuse the machinery of the State Department\u201d for the president\u2019s personal gain.\n\n\u201cThese documents only underscore the need for the Trump Administration to comply with our requests for documents and interviews,\u201d they wrote in a statement.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
