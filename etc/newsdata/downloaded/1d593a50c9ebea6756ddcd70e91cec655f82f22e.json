The number of known child sexual abuse images has soared from thousands to tens of millions in just the past few years.\n\nSpeaking at an event in Washington on Wednesday, Associate Attorney General Sujit Raman said the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children received more than 18 million tips of online child sex abuse last year, over 90% of them from Facebook.\n\nHe estimated that up to 75% of those tips would \"go dark\" if social media companies like Facebook were to go through with encryption plans.\n\nFacebook said in a statement that it strongly opposes \"government efforts to build backdoors,\" which it said would undermine privacy and security.\n\nZuckerberg said on Thursday he had been aware of child exploitation risks before announcing his encryption plan and acknowledged that it would reduce tools to fight the problem.\n\nSpeaking in a livestream of the company's weekly internal Q&A session, he said he was \"optimistic\" that Facebook would be able to identify predators even in encrypted systems using the same tools it used to fight election interference, like patterns of activity and links between accounts on different platforms.\n\nHe also suggested the company might further limit the ways adults can interact with minors on Facebook's platforms.\n\n\n\n\n\nDIRECT REQUESTS\n\nThe bilateral agreement between the UK and the United States would empower the UK government to directly request data from U.S. tech companies, which remotely store data relevant to their own ongoing criminal investigations, rather than asking for it via U.S. law enforcement officials.\n\nSusan Landau, a professor of cybersecurity and policy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, said disputes over encryption have flared on-and-off since the mid-1990s.\n\nShe said government officials concerned with fighting child abuse would be better served by making sure investigators had more funding and training.\n\n\"They seem to ignore the low-hanging fruit in favor of going after the thing they've been going after for the past 25 years,\" she said.\n\nWhatsApp's global head Will Cathcart wrote in a public internet forum https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21100588 on Saturday that the company \"will always oppose government attempts to build backdoors because they would weaken the security of everyone who uses WhatsApp including governments themselves.\"\n\nThat app, which is already encrypted, is also owned by Facebook.\n\n(Reporting by Joseph Menn and Katie Paul in San Francisco and Christopher Bing in Washington; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Edwina Gibbs)", "description": "The United States, the United Kingdom and Australia have called on Facebook Inc to not go ahead with end-to-end encryption across its messaging services unless law enforcement officials have backdoor access, saying encryption hindered the fight against child abuse and terrorism.
