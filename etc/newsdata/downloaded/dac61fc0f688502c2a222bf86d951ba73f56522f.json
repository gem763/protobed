Alexander Hamilton wrote that an independent judiciary is \u201cpeculiarly essential\u201d for our system of government. In 1937, a heavily Democratic Congress rejected President Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s plan to restructure the judiciary in response to \u201creactionary\u201d decisions. An independent judiciary has helped to safeguard liberty in our country, while remaining illusory in other countries. Yet today, certain political forces threaten to \u201cpack\u201d the Supreme Court or \u201crestructure\u201d the judiciary in response to what they call \u201cpoliticized\u201d decisions. These threats are becoming more direct, even finding their way into legal briefs filed with the very courts from which change is demanded. This event will focus on the meaning and importance of judicial independence and current threats to what the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist called one of the \u201ccrown jewels\u201d of our system of government.\n\nSign up to receive invitations to all public events.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-08/GettyImages-79253426.jpg?itok=i5gHcx7a"}
