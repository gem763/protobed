With more than 95% of ballots counted, Netanyahu's right-wing Likud had 32 seats, while Gantz's Blue and White took 33 places in Israel's 120-member parliament.\n\nGantz's slim lead, however, gave no obvious path for either party to form a majority coalition, raising the possibility of negotiations towards a unity government.\n\n\"There are only two options, a government led by me or a dangerous government dependent on the Arab parties,\" Netanyahu told a press conference in Jerusalem on Wednesday night.\n\n\"In these times, more than ever, when we face enormous security and political challenges, it cannot be that there will be a government that depends on anti-Zionist Arab parties,\" he said.\n\nThroughout his campaign, Netanyahu warned, as he has in previous elections, that left-wing and Arab voters were showing up in large numbers to try to oust him.\n\nMedia said the mainly Arab Joint List alliance was set to become the third-largest bloc in parliament with 13 seats.\n\nEnd of 'Netanyahu era'?\n\n\"The Netanyahu era is over,\" said Ahmed Tibi, one of the list's leaders. \"If Gantz calls, we shall tell him our conditions for supporting him.\"\n\nIf the initial results hold, it will be a major setback for Netanyahu, who hoped to form a right-wing coalition similar to his current administration as he faces the possibility of a corruption indictment in the weeks ahead.\n\nGantz, addressing supporters in Tel Aviv, called for a \"broad unity government\" but cautioned that he was waiting for final results.\n\n\"We will act to form a broad unity government that will express the will of the people,\" the former armed forces chief said.\n\n\"We will begin negotiations and I will speak with everyone.\"\n\nEx-defence minister Avigdor Lieberman could prove to be kingmaker, with the reported results giving his secular-nationalist party Yisrael Beitenu nine seats.\n\nHe has not declared in favour of either of the two leading contenders.\n\n\"There is only one option for us,\" he has stated.\n\n\"That is to form a broad, liberal, national unity government\" with Yisrael Beitenu, Blue and White and Likud.\n\nSuch a government would not include the ultra-Orthodox Jews.\n\nThe staunchly secularist Lieberman has long campaigned against what he sees as their undue clout, which he accuses of seeking to impose Jewish religious law on Israel's secular population.\n\nHe would also not partner with Arab parties.\n\n'Disease of hatred'\n\n\"Israel has a problem,\" the top-selling daily Yediot Aharonot newspaper wrote on Wednesday. \"We have been afflicted with the disease of hatred.\"\n\n\"Some people want to sharpen the divisions and to see a clear division between 'left' and 'right' but that is precisely the way to worsen the disease.\"\n\nWhatever the shape of the next Israeli government, the Palestinians are prepared to talk peace, said their foreign minister, Riyad al-Maliki.\n\n\"Whoever will be able to form a government, we are ready to sit with him or her in order to restart the negotiations,\" Maliki told reporters in Oslo, accompanying president Mahmud Abbas on a two-day visit.\n\nBut Abbas later gave a blunt assessment of Palestinian preferences for a new Israeli government.\n\n\"Our position: against Netanyahu,\" he said.\n\nArab turnout\n\nIsrael's Arab parties have traditionally not endorsed anyone for prime minister.\n\n\"The main difference in this vote is the turnout among Arab citizens,\" Joint List leader Ayman Odeh told journalists outside his home in the northern city of Haifa.\n\n\"There's no doubt that this is what made the difference. Without that, Netanyahu would already be prime minister.\"\n\nThe election was the second in five months for Israel.\n\nPresident Reuven Rivlin, who must appoint someone to attempt to form the next government, said there was a \"need to avoid a third\".\n\nNetanyahu suffered one of the biggest defeats of his political career after the previous elections in April.\n\nHis Likud, along with its right-wing and religious allies, won a majority, but he failed to form a coalition and opted for a second election rather than risk having Rivlin choose someone else to try.\n\nThe stakes could not be much higher for the 69-year-old Netanyahu, who many believe will seek immunity from prosecution should he survive as prime minister.", "description": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's long grip on power appears in jeopardy after elections have left him tied with his main challenger Benny Gantz, raising the prospect of tough negotiations to build a unity government or even the end of the Israeli premier's record long rule.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7817/8f0dac75d2b84aaf918420dffcff6373.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
