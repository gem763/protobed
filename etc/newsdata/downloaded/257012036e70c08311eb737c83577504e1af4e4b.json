Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu described it as a pause, solely to allow the Kurdish fighters to withdraw.\n\nKurdish fighters would be forced to give up their heavy weapons and their positions would be destroyed, Cavusoglu said. He declined to call the agreement a \"ceasefire\", saying ceasefires could be agreed only by legitimate sides, and not by a Kurdish militia that Turkey considers a terrorist group.\n\n\"When the terrorist elements completely leave the safe zone, we can stop the operation,\" Cavusoglu said.\n\nThe joint declaration said Washington and Ankara would co-operate on handling Islamic State fighters and family members held in prisons and camps, a big international concern.\n\nDoubts over Kurdish response\n\nPence said Washington had already been in contact with the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which had agreed to withdraw and were already pulling out.\n\nHowever, the Kurdish position was not clear.\n\nAldar Xelil, a leading Syrian Kurdish politician, said the Kurds would soon issue a statement. He said the Kurds had rejected the Turkish safe zone in the past. They would abide by the ceasefire but would defend themselves, he said on Al Arabiya television.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPence said that once the pause became permanent, Washington would go ahead with its own plans to withdraw its entire military force from northern Syria, which had partnered with the Kurds to fight against Islamic State.\n\nTrump tweeted: \"Great news out of Turkey.\"\n\n\"Thank you to Erdogan,\" Trump said. \"Millions of lives will be saved!\"\n\nPence told a news conference after more than four hours of talks at the presidential palace in Ankara: \"Today the United States and Turkey have agreed to a ceasefire in Syria.\n\n\"The Turkish side will pause Operation Peace Spring in order to allow for the withdrawal of YPG forces from the safe zone for 120 hours,\" Pence said. \"All military operations under Operation Peace Spring will be paused, and Operation Peace Spring will be halted entirely on completion of the withdrawal.\"\n\nThe deal struck with Erdogan also provided for Turkey not to engage in military operations in the flashpoint Syrian border town of Kobani, Pence said. Cavusoglu said Turkey had given no commitments about Kobani.\n\nHumanitarian crisis\n\nPence added that he had spoken to Trump after the talks and that Trump had expressed his gratitude for the ceasefire accord. Washington's main goal had been to halt the violence, and it had succeeded, Pence said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Turkish assault has created a new humanitarian crisis in Syria with 200,000 civilians taking flight, a security alert over thousands of Islamic State fighters potentially abandoned in Kurdish jails, and a political maelstrom at home for Trump.\n\nTrump has been accused of abandoning Kurdish-led fighters, Washington's main partners in the battle to dismantle Islamic State's self-declared caliphate in Syria, by withdrawing troops from the border as Ankara launched its offensive on October 9.\n\nThe US House of Representatives had condemned his policy on Wednesday in a vote backed by a majority of his fellow Republicans as well as Democrats.\n\nThe Turkish assault began after Trump moved US troops out of the way following a phone call with Erdogan. Trump announced sanctions on Turkey following the launch of the assault, but his opponents said these were too mild to have an impact.\n\nPence said the sanctions would now be lifted once the ceasefire became permanent.\n\nHowever, US Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen intended to proceed \"full steam ahead\" with proposed legislation to impose tougher sanctions, a spokeswoman for Van Hollen said.\n\nIf successful, the deal could smooth over a big rift between Washington and Turkey, its main Muslim ally in NATO.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut the US withdrawal also leaves US adversaries Russia and Iran in a far stronger position in Syria. The Kurds responded to the announcement of the US withdrawal by in effect switching allegiances and have already invited forces of the Syrian government, backed by Moscow and Tehran, into towns and cities in areas they control.\n\nThere could be friction both along the edges of the new safe zone claimed by Turkey, and within it, in places where government forces have advanced in recent days.\n\nLoading\n\nReuters", "description": "The truce was announced by US Vice President Mike Pence after talks with Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan, and was swiftly hailed by President Donald Trump.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5206%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_532%2C$y_513/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/65645d1917ba9637c479739863059828d26f7257", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
