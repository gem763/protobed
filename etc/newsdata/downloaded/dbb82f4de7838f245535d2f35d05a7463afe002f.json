He should be right similar to Mako, and then everyone else is in full training.\u201d\n\nThose injury concerns were added to by Kyle Sinckler, Joe Launchbury and Luke Cowan-Dickie, who were all forced off the field during the four-try rout at St James\u2019 Park.\n\nSinckler was unable to complete the team\u2019s victory parade around the pitch as he had ice strapped to his right calf, while Launchbury suffered a knee to the back when he attempted to clearout a ruck, and both appeared to be in discomfort as they left the stadium afterwards. Cowan-Dickie meanwhile injured his knee, but Jones was optimistic that they will not prove long-term issues.\n\n\u201c[Sinckler] was good, we just took him off as a precaution,\u201d Jones added. \u201cJoe Launchbury\u2019s got a sore back, we don\u2019t feel that\u2019s too serious, and Luke Cowan-Dickie took a knock to the knee but again, the first examination indicates it\u2019s not too serious.\u201d\n\nMore detail will be confirmed on the injured trio once England touch down in Tokyo on Monday \u2013 providing they make it as planned as a typhoon is due to hit the Japanese capital over the weekend that is set to disrupt flights to the city \u2013 but Jones was relieved that they were the only blemishes of the night.\n\nEngland were not punished for their slow start, in which they only lead 9-0 at half-time having failed to muster a single try-scoring chance. But second-half scores from Ben Youngs, Joe Marchant, Ellis Genge and Anthony Watson ensured England recorded an emphatic victory.\n\n\u201cWe looked like in the first half we were still eating pasta and pizza in Treviso,\u201d Jones said. \u201cSo we had to get that out of our system, and in the second half I thought we were really purposeful. We made a few changes to the team that we planned to do which was another good exercise for us, just trying different combinations so I\u2019m pleased with that.\u201d", "description": "Mako Vunipola and Jack Nowell will miss at least half of England\u2019s Rugby World Cup pool matches after Eddie Jones revealed they will not feature against either Tonga or the United States in Japan.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/06/23/mako-vunipola.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
