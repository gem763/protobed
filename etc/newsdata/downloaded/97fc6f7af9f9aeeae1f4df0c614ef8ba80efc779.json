Why do you ask?", "language": "en", "text": "If you watched the Democratic debates on Tuesday night, there was one face missing on the stage that still attracts a lot of attention. Marianne Williamson didn\u2019t make the cut and was forced to watch the proceedings remotely. So does that mean she\u2019s giving up and dropping out? Not on your life, brother. She\u2019s just inspired to ride the power of love and keep on trucking. (Washington Post)\n\nThe establishment\u2019s paternalistic insistence that, in essence, \u201cit\u2019s time to shut this thing down\u201d \u2014 making sure only its preordained category of people, discussing its preordained category of topics, is placed before the American people for consideration as contenders for the nomination to run against President Trump \u2014 has created a false, inauthentic piece of high school theater posing as the Democratic debates. Last night\u2019s debate was a lot of things, but it was not exciting. It contained no magic. If anything, it reduced some very nice people to behavior their mothers probably raised them not to engage in. Which woman who claims feminist ideals can be the nastiest to another woman? Which young person can show the greatest arrogance toward those with decades of experience under their belts? Which intelligent person can best reduce a complicated topic to pabulum for the masses? \u2026 \u201cIsn\u2019t it time for you to drop out now, Marianne?\u201d After that debate Tuesday night, are you kidding? Let me get this right. You think a sanitized wish list of Democratic proposals, focused just enough on appealing to people\u2019s self-interest but not going anywhere near a serious discussion of what ails us, is going to defeat the Republicans?\n\nJust for full disclosure, the author is a donor to the Willamson campaign. (I sent her a dollar to help her make the cut for the previous debates because it thought it would keep the entertainment factor higher.)\n\nNow, after reading this op-ed she published, I wish more than ever that she was still on the stage. The list of grievances she airs in this piece is both entertaining and also potentially accurate. She\u2019s opening up in the DNC with both rhetorical barrels, accusing them of peddling \u201ctepid, corporatized, compromised truths.\u201d As for the current frontrunners, Williamson has a piece of her mind for them as well. They are described as, \u201cpolitical leftovers, prepackaged as bromides with all the vitality and richness of spoiled food.\u201d\n\nAssuming she wrote this herself (and I have no reason to suspect otherwise), I\u2019ll have to confess to being impressed. She knows how to turn a phrase and hurl some snark. And a dose of that certainly would have livened up that tedious debate on Tuesday.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not saying I actually want the woman to become the leader of the free world. She still comes off all too often as ten pounds of crazy packed into a five-pound bag. But she can definitely liven up any forum she\u2019s involved in. When she really gets revved up, you never know where she\u2019s going next. And sooner or later she\u2019s bound to invoke the mystical power of love as the only path to defeating the Bad Orange Man.\n\nBut hey\u2026 if this presidential thing doesn\u2019t work out for her, she might consider applying for a job writing with us. That was some Class A bombast on display.", "description": "In it for the long run", "authors": ["Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Williamson.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
