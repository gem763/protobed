View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nU.S. intelligence similarly concluded that Kim is not ready to relinquish his nuclear arsenal, Defense Intelligence Agency director Lieutenant General Robert Ashley told Fox News in June.\n\nAccording to Thae, who served as the North\u2019s former deputy ambassador to the U.K., President Donald Trump\u2019s current approach of buddying up to the dictator and holding high-profile summits \u201cis a failure.\u201d\n\nThae\u2019s comments come as Washington and Pyongyang both signal interest in resuming the stalled denuclearization talks. North Korea announced its willingness to reenter the discussions earlier this month in a statement that preceded its latest round of short-range missiles launches by just hours.\n\nThe last Trump-Kim summit in February collapsed over U.S. demands for denuclearization and North Korean demands for substantial sanctions relief.\n\nWhile Trump has agreed to ease joint military exercises with South Korea, he has not relieved Pyongyang of the embargoes meant to halt its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\n\nBut Thae says that Trump\u2019s refusal to exact a heavier toll on a regime that has made unprecedented gains in its nuclear program \u2014 Kim has conducted more missile and nuclear tests than his father Kim Jong Il and grandfather Kim Il Sung combined \u2014 is already a coup for the young leader. Directly undercutting his own cabinet, Trump in May rolled back additional measures imposed by the Treasury Department, a decision he announced via Twitter.\n\nSome experts insist that progress toward denuclearization remains unlikely until Washington is prepared to ease its already tough sanctions regimen. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has advocated the U.S. take a more conciliatory approach, while in July Chinese President Xi Jinping reportedly urged Trump in July to \u201cshow flexibility\u201d and ease sanctions in due course. A New York Times report in June indicated that the Trump Administration may consider a deal that involves partial relief for partial dismantling.\n\nDuyeon Kim, an adjunct senior fellow with the Center for a New American Security, suggests sanctions don\u2019t have to be imposed in an all-or-nothing approach.\n\n\u201cIf and when serious negotiations are held, Washington should consider providing time-bound ad hoc sanctions exemptions in exchange for some denuclearization steps,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThis provides some incentives and relief for Pyongyang to get the ball rolling on denuclearization while allowing for sanctions to be \u2018snapped back\u2019 if North Korea doesn\u2019t fulfill its end of the bargain,\u201d Kim adds. \u201cOtherwise, if sanctions are completely lifted, then they would be difficult, if not impossible, to re-impose them because China and Russia would not vote in favor.\u201d\n\nThe extent to which sanctions offer effective leverage over North Korea remains debatable. The regime itself insisted just last month that it \u201cwill never barter the strategic security of the country for the sanctions relief.\u201d\n\nSome analysts say it\u2019s not the level of sanctions that should be up for debate, but how to more effectively enforce the U.S. and U.N. bans in place now, some of which date back to 2006.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know precisely how badly the sanctions are hurting the North Korean economy,\u201d says Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein, a Templeton Fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, adding, \u201cbut we do know that they are.\u201d\n\nAccording to a report from South Korea\u2019s central bank, the North\u2019s economy in 2018 contracted for the second consecutive year, shrinking the most since 1997, due to a combination of international sanctions and drought.\n\nThae says the U.N.\u2019s ban on North Korean exports of oil, seafood and petroleum have particularly put a squeeze on the country\u2019s economy, but not enough to destabilize the black market or really force Pyongyang\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cThe question is whether the sanctions are enough to stop the nuclear process of North Korea,\u201d he says. \u201cClearly, it is not enough.\u201d\n\nWrite to Laignee Barron at Laignee.Barron@time.com.", "description": "The U.S. needs to toughen sanctions if the world is going to avert the birth of a new nuclear state, former North Korean diplomat says.", "authors": ["Laignee Barron"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/kim_jong_un_north_korea_military.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
