As The Post\u2019s Philip Bump writes, it\u2019s a great example of a politician saying things that are strictly true while completely misleading the people he\u2019s supposed to serve.\n\nAnd as far as obfuscations go, it\u2019s got plenty of company in Trump\u2019s Cabinet.\n\nFrom basically Day One, Trump Cabinet officials have made claims or offered explanations that \u2014 similar to Pompeo\u2019s \u2014 would soon fall apart in spectacular fashion. Oftentimes, they were doing so to toe the Trump line; other times, they were merely covering their own backsides.\n\nBelow is a recap of the times they\u2019ve been found out.\n\n1. Pompeo on Ukraine\n\nThe claim: After ABC News\u2019s Martha Raddatz asked Pompeo about reports that Trump pressured Ukraine\u2019s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden, Pompeo responded, \u201cSo, you just gave me a report about a I.C. whistleblower complaint, none of which I\u2019ve seen.\u201d He added: \u201cI think I saw a statement from the Ukrainian foreign minister yesterday, said there was no pressure applied in the course of the conversation.\"\n\nThe truth: Pompeo has now admitted he was on the call, meaning the ignorance he feigned about the whistleblower complaint was disingenuous at best. He was also asked specifically about the call \u2014 not just the complaint. He clearly didn\u2019t need to rely on what Ukraine said about the call.\n\n2. Ross testimony denying his leading role in census citizenship question\n\nThe claim: In March 2018 testimony, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said that the \u201cDepartment of Justice, as you know, initiated the request for inclusion of the citizenship question.\u201d\n\nThe truth: The Washington Post reported months later that Ross\u2019s efforts to add the citizenship question dated back to early 2017 \u2014 basically as soon as he joined Trump\u2019s Cabinet and months before the Justice Department made a formal request.\n\nThe Commerce Department explained that these were normal behind-the-scenes discussions before a formal request was made, but Ross sure made it sound like this wasn\u2019t his idea \u2014 even as he was clearly pushing for it hard. He wrote in one May 2017 email: \u201cI am mystified why nothing have [sic] been done in response to my months old request that we include the citizenship question. Why not?\u201d\n\n3. Barr denying knowledge of the Mueller team\u2019s concerns\n\nThe claim: In separate testimonies, Attorney General William P. Barr claimed ignorance about how special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s team viewed his misleading summary of the Mueller report. In a House hearing April 9, Rep. Charlie Crist (D-Fla.) referenced reports that \u201cmembers of the special counsel\u2019s team are frustrated at some level with the limited information included in your March 24th letter.\u201d Asked whether he knew what they were referencing, Barr said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. I think \u2014 I think \u2014 I suspect that they probably wanted more put out.\u201d\n\nThe truth: Mueller himself had sent Barr a letter two weeks earlier \u2014 on March 27 \u2014 stating that Barr\u2019s summary \u201cdid not fully capture the context, nature and substance of this office\u2019s work and conclusions.\u201d\n\nBarr was asked about \u201cmembers\u201d of Mueller\u2019s team and not Mueller specifically, so it might have been technically true. But to pretend he was unaware of the crux of these criticisms was, again, disingenuous at best.\n\n4. Sessions denying contact with Russians\n\nThe claim: During his confirmation hearing for attorney general, Jeff Sessions denied he had been in contact with Russians in 2016. \u201cI have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that [2016] campaign, and I didn\u2019t have \u2014 did not have communications with the Russians,\u201d he said. He narrowed the claim later to say, \u201cI never met with any Russian officials to discuss the issues of the campaign.\u201d\n\nThe truth: Neither turned out to be accurate. Sessions spoke with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak twice in 2016. And intercepts later showed the two did discuss campaign-related matters.\n\n5. Pence denying that Trump fired Comey over Russia\n\nThe claim: After Trump fired FBI Director James B. Comey in May 2017, Vice President Pence joined White House spokespeople in denying that it had to do with the Russia investigation. \u201cThat\u2019s not what \u2014 let me be clear with you \u2014 that was not what this is about,\u201d he said May 10, repeating: \u201cThat\u2019s not what this is about.\u201d\n\nThe truth: One day later, Trump went on NBC News and declared, \u201cWhen I decided to just do it, I said to myself \u2014 I said, \u2018You know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.\u2019 \u201d\n\n6. Pence denying Michael Flynn discussed sanctions with Kislyak\n\nThe claim: After it was reported that then-national security adviser Michael Flynn had spoken with Kislyak during the transition period \u2014 possibly in violation of U.S. law against nongovernment officials conducting diplomacy \u2014 Pence stated they hadn\u2019t discussed the Obama administration\u2019s new sanctions. \u201cThey did not discuss anything having to do with the United States\u2019 decision to expel diplomats or impose censure against Russia.\u201d He repeated that the talks \u201chad nothing whatsoever to do with those sanctions.\u201d\n\nThe truth: They did, as The Post soon reported. Flynn explained (rather dubiously) that he didn\u2019t consider the things they were talking about to be \u201csanctions,\u201d per se. Flynn was forced out after Pence and others accused him of lying to them about it.\n\n7. McMaster denying report about Trump disclosing classified information to Russians\n\nThe claim: After The Post reported that Trump had disclosed highly classified information to Kislyak and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in the Oval Office, Flynn\u2019s replacement as national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, was dispatched to deny it. \u201cThe story that came out tonight, as reported, is false,\u201d McMaster said. He added that, \"at no time were intelligence sources or methods discussed.\u201d\n\nThe truth: The White House has never disputed the specifics, and the Mueller report noted that former White House press secretary Sean Spicer told Mueller\u2019s team that \u201che would have been told to \u2018clean it up\u2019 if the reporting on the meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister was inaccurate, but he was never told to correct the reporting.\u201d\n\nMcMaster\u2019s denial was broad, so it could have been technically accurate if any part of the story was wrong, but it was certainly intended to cast doubt on the central claim.\n\n8. Nielsen claimed there was no family separation policy\n\nThe claim: \u201cWe do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period,\u201d then-Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tweeted June 17.\n\nWe do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period. \u2014 Secretary Kirstjen M. Nielsen (@SecNielsen) June 17, 2018\n\nThe truth: An inspector general\u2019s report made clear that the separations were a direct result of a decision made by the Trump administration. \u201cThe Zero Tolerance Policy, however, fundamentally changed DHS\u2019 approach to immigration enforcement. In early May 2018, DHS determined that the policy would cover alien adults arriving illegally in the United States with minor children. Because minor children cannot be held in criminal custody with an adult, alien adults who entered the United States illegally would have to be separated from any accompanying minor children when the adults were referred for criminal prosecution.\u201d\n\nIt might have been technically true that the policy didn\u2019t say, \u201cWe will separate families,\u201d but it was inherent in the decision. And now-acting DHS secretary Kevin McAleenan has made clear that officials knew that was the case.\n\n9. Kelly\u2019s baseless story about Frederica Wilson\n\nThe claim: Then-White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly claimed in October 2017 that Rep. Frederica S. Wilson (D-Fla.) boasted about winning money from the Obama administration for a building at a 2015 dedication for the building. Kelly said Wilson had \u201ctalked about how she was instrumental in getting the funding for that building, and how she took care of her constituents because she got the money, and she just called up President Obama, and on that phone call, he gave the money, the $20 million,\u201d Kelly said. He accused her of being the latest in a \u201clong tradition of empty barrels making the most noise.\u201d\n\nThe truth: Video later surfaced of the dedication showing the congresswoman saying no such thing. Kelly later declined to apologize and suggested that Wilson had made the comments in a separate, private discussion, but he declined to elaborate.\n\n10. Pruitt denying pushing for raises for top staffers\n\nThe claim: When asked about large, controversial raises given to two top Environmental Protection Agency staffers, then-EPA administrator Scott Pruitt suggested that he hadn\u2019t been involved. \u201cI found out this yesterday and I corrected the action, and we are in the process of finding out how it took place and correcting that going forward,\u201d he told Fox News\u2019s Ed Henry.\n\nThe truth: Sources later told The Post that Pruitt had endorsed the idea of the raises a month earlier, even though he hadn\u2019t carried them out himself.", "description": "So many times, top Trump Cabinet officials have made claims or presented things in completely dishonest ways. Mike Pompeo is merely the latest.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix", "October At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VOVeSCg0dAxPf_GFFCT0dIcmUXY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/D5TVNIVH7QI6TBZTJDEHENPTSY.jpg"}
