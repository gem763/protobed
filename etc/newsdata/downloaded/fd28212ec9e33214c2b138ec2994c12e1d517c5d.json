Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill on Oct. 11, 2019. (Erin Scott/Reuters)\n\nThe complaint from the original whistleblower sparked House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry. An attorney for the individual said last week that \u201cmultiple\u201d whistleblowers have come forward, and in recent weeks, Trump has escalated his attacks against them, alluding to the death penalty and suggesting that whoever gave the first whistleblower information was \u201cclose to a spy.\u201d\n\nThe president also tweeted last week that the original whistleblower \u201cshould be exposed and questioned properly\u201d \u2014 an argument he repeated during an appearance Saturday night on Fox News Channel.\n\n\u201cI think we have to find out who the whistleblower is that would give all this false information,\u201d Trump told host Jeanine Pirro.\n\nTrump\u2019s allies have taken aim at the whistleblowers, as well. Former U.S. attorney Joseph E. diGenova denounced the two anonymous individuals on Tuesday as \u201csuicide bombers,\u201d while Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) on Friday called for the first whistleblower\u2019s unmasking.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t we know who this whistleblower is?\u201d Jordan told reporters at the Capitol. \u201cThey deserve protection, but ... they\u2019re not entitled to anonymity.\u201d\n\nAmid mounting safety concerns and fears that the person\u2019s identity may be revealed, attorneys for the whistleblower have asked whether their client can submit testimony in writing rather than in person, according to a person familiar with the matter. The whistleblower\u2019s attorneys have submitted the request to the House and Senate intelligence committees, the person added.\n\nSchiff said Sunday that while Democrats continue to probe the actions of the president and his administration, they plan to take steps to protect the whistleblower\u2019s identity.\n\n\u201cWe do want to make sure that we identify other evidence that is pertinent to the withholding of the military support, the effort to cover this up by hiding this in a classified computer system,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cWe want to make sure that we uncover the full details about the conditionality of either the military aid or that meeting with the Ukranian president.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are probing whether Trump\u2019s decision to withhold nearly $400 million in military assistance from Ukraine was linked to his push for the government there to pursue political investigations that could bolster the president\u2019s reelection bid.\n\n\u201cIt may not be necessary to take steps that might reveal the whistleblower\u2019s identity to do that, and we\u2019re going to make sure we protect that whistleblower,\u201d he added.\n\nTrump and other Republicans have argued that Democrats should hold public hearings rather than hear witness testimony behind closed doors. But Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.), who sits on the Intelligence Committee, argued Sunday that Democrats have several reasons for conducting closed-door depositions.\n\nThe \u201cmost important reason,\u201d Himes said on ABC News\u2019s \u201cThis Week,\u201d is that \u201cwhen you\u2019re talking to ambassadors and other U.S. government officials who have regularly had access to classified information, you need to be able to talk about that information and then go back and say hey, this conversation has to be redacted because it involves classified information.\u201d\n\nThe second reason, he said, is that lawmakers don\u2019t want witnesses to be able to coordinate testimony.\n\n\u201cThese are a group of people who have shown that they have no problem whatsoever lying, if they think it serves their interest,\u201d Himes said. \u201cAnd so, you don\u2019t want to give them the opportunity to look at what they are saying and therefore coordinate their stories.\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201call transcripts will eventually be scrubbed for classified information and made available for the American public to see.\u201d\n\nMike DeBonis contributed to this report.", "description": "The House Intelligence Committee chairman suggested it isn\u2019t necessary for the whistleblower to testify in person given the threats made by Trump and others.", "authors": ["Felicia Sonmez", "National Reporter On The Washington Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/D3Zic8jalU0_-Xcr7tVpM16llNg=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WQEN75HNZQI6TBUT6SD6IZ4EVI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
