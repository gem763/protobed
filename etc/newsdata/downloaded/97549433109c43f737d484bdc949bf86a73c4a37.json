We believe it is a growing market and it has lots of great growth ahead of it.\n\nTime to eat: The company has told its investors it aims to open the first UK restaurant as early as next year\n\n'We also know that great American brands have been successful. Burger brands have been unbelievably successful there. But we believe that we can challenge those brands.'\n\nThis month another American fast food giant Chick-fil-A opened its first British store amid great controversy over its donations to anti-LGBT groups. However, on Friday it said it would close the outlet \u2013 in Reading, Berkshire \u2013 following a surge of opposition from gay rights campaigners.\n\nWendy's has more than 6,700 outlets in 30 countries around the world including the Americas, Asia and the Middle East.\n\nThe company said it wants to open 20 outlets initially in Britain starting in the next 12 to 18 months. It plans to open an international head office and hit major markets on this side of the Atlantic.\n\nIts executives are describing a 'substantial footprint' \u2013 which implies hundreds of outlets.\n\nIt is not the first time the firm has attempted to conquer Britain. It abruptly halted a foray in the 1980s before returning early in the following decade.\n\nThen in 1999 it pulled out after seven years \u2013 closing seven outlets mainly in London \u2013 after complaining of 'high real estate and operating costs'.\n\nPringle said this time around the company has been researching the UK market for more than 12 months. She added: 'We are going there with our eyes wide open and with a lot of insights and preparation.\n\n'We have done landmark research with thousands of consumers in the UK. We have talked to them and engaged with them and what they think about the Wendy's brand.'\n\nWendy's burgers include a Bacon Jalape\u00f1o Triple Cheeseburger, a 1,280-calorie, three-quarter-pound burger topped with pickled jalape\u00f1os, smoked bacon, cheese, crispy fried onions, savoury cheese sauce and a smoky jalape\u00f1o sauce which it describes as a 'whole lotta heat to eat'.\n\nAnother on offer is the S'Awesome Bacon Cheeseburger Triple, at 1,170 calories, which is similar but without the jalape\u00f1os.\n\nBryan Roberts, insights director at industry analyst TCC Global, said: 'This is such an iconic brand in the States and it is interesting that they've decided the UK is going to be one of their key growth markets.\n\nThe gourmet end of the burger market is under a lot of stress. But McDonald's is doing very well and Wendy's obviously feels there is an opportunity.\n\n'Wendy's markets its burgers as always fresh beef. Its unique selling point back in the States is that it is never frozen and is locally sourced, so they are aiming at the higher end of the fast food market.\n\n'It will be interesting to see if they can get a real foothold this time.'", "description": "The company has told its investors it aims to open the first UK restaurant as early as next year and has already begun an extensive search for sites and franchise partners.", "authors": ["Neil Craven For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
