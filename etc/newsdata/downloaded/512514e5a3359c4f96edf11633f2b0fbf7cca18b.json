The legal limit is 35mg. She subsequently blamed the sliders for her being 'slightly unsteady' on her feet.\n\nAt Manchester JPs court, Leadbeater who works at a Victoria's Secret store at the Trafford Centre pleaded guilty to drink driving and was banned from driving for 12 months.\n\nThe incident occurred on April 29 when the Mustang was seen travelling along Chester Road.\n\nOfficers subsequently stopped the lingerie store sales worker and noticed she was 'off balance' when she got out the car, magistrates heard. Initially Leadbeater who lives in a \u00a31m farmhouse in Turton, near Bolton blew nearly twice the alcohol limit during a roadside breath test\n\nNicola Durham, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant came to the police's attention after a CCTV operator highlighting concerns and notified them'\n\nNicola Durham prosecuting said: 'The defendant came to the police's attention after a CCTV operator highlighting concerns and notified them.\n\n'They then located the vehicle and spoke to the defendant and came to the opinion that she had indeed consumed alcohol. A road side breathalyser reading in relation to that was 68mg but clearly that's not the eventually reading and she was found to be 51mg at the police station.\n\n'The defendant was off balance when she got out the car but there was nothing in relation to her actual driving. She has no previous convictions.'\n\nIn mitigation for Leadbeater defence lawyer Ashley Barnes told the judge: 'The reading of 51mg is in the lower end of the spectrum but it still comes as an enormous surprise to her - although she accepts the reading.\n\nIn mitigation for Leadbeater defence lawyer Ashley Barnes told the judge: 'You will have read she was slightly unsteady on her feet. She was driving in sliders which you wear on the beach normally'\n\n'You will have read she was slightly unsteady on her feet. She was driving in sliders which you wear on the beach normally. She had been out somewhere nice wearing nice shoes and took them off not as she did not want to drive in those nice shoes. So far as any loss of balance that would be the main reason.'\n\nMr Barnes added: 'Her income monthly will go because she lives north of Bolton and she has a job in the Trafford Centre. It won't be economically viable for her to get there and keep the job.'\n\nSentencing Deputy District Judge Alexandra Simmonds told Leadbeater: 'You pleaded guilty to driving having consumed too much alcohol on the day in question. Police where made aware of your presence by an operator of CCTV who said something they had seen made them concerned.\n\n'Police arrived and you got out and were entirely cooperative but you had had too much to drink and were over the limit. Nobody has provided any evidence to show your driving was impaired and you have no previous convictions for driving or anything else.'\n\nLeadbeater was also fined \u00a3360 and was ordered to pay \u00a3436 in costs and surcharges. She was also offered a chance to attend a drink driving rehabilitation course to reduce the length of her ban.", "description": "Katie Leadbeater, 25, said she was pulled over for drink driving on Chester Road in Manchester because a CCTV operator has spotted her struggling to walk in a pair of 'beach sliders'.", "authors": ["William Cole For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/09/19876242-0-image-a-2_1571389131319.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
