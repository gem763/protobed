The consequences of an improbable referendum outcome two years and four months ago are once again around the corner. While Canadians spend the next 21 days stocking up on mini chocolate bars, the wise Brit will be laying in precious stores of water and penicillin.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nU.K. politicians, meanwhile, will desperately be trying to unscramble the mess they have made of their government\u2019s Brexit negotiations with the EU. They will be doing so from a self-inflicted position of weakness, with little room to manoeuvre, and led by a government that hasn\u2019t done a single thing right since Boris Johnson became Prime Minister three months ago.\n\nAmong his more notable setbacks, Mr. Johnson tried to prorogue Parliament for five weeks \u2013 a move widely denounced as undemocratic \u2013 only to see the U.K. Supreme Court rule that the suspension was illegal.\n\nAfter that, he pitched a new exit deal that was immediately deemed a non-starter because of its opposition to keeping the Irish border open \u2013 the \u201cIrish backstop\" negotiated by Mr. Johnson\u2019s much more pragmatic predecessor, Theresa May.\n\nMr. Johnson is now also bound by the Benn Act, a new law that requires the Prime Minister to seek to postpone the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline to Jan. 31, 2020, if Parliament doesn\u2019t agree to a withdrawal deal by Oct. 19.\n\nMr. Johnson now plans to try to reach a deal with the EU at a summit on Oct. 17, and then settle the issue at a special session of Parliament two days later.\n\nBut his hands are tied by the Benn Act. No one on the EU negotiating team is likely to make concessions to a Prime Minister who lacks the legal authority to walk away from the table, and who has also been politically weakened by a humiliating Supreme Court decision.\n\nIt is also inevitable that there will be a general election later this year, which means the EU will be dealing with a new government if the deadline is extended to Jan. 31.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMr. Johnson has accused the EU of intransigence, and argues that its refusal to negotiate with a self-mutilated lame duck such as himself has made it \u201cessentially impossible\u201d for the U.K. to leave with a deal.\n\nIn short, it is difficult to see how Mr. Johnson can reconcile his position that the U.K. should crash out the EU with no deal \u2013 the consequences be damned \u2013 with the reality of his political situation.\n\nOn Thursday, it appeared he was finally beginning to accept that reality when he and Irish leader Leo Varadkar came out of a private lunch saying they had jointly seen a \u201cpathway to a possible deal.\" In other words, Mr. Johnson might be prepared to relent on the key issue of the Irish backstop.\n\nIf that\u2019s true, and he somehow manages to reach a deal acceptable to Parliament by Oct. 19, then Brexit will go ahead with none of the worst-case outcomes foreseen by government experts, and Brits will be able to have fun on Halloween. But that seems unlikely.\n\nThe U.K. has been paralyzed for too long by the intransigence of pro-Leave politicians such as Mr. Johnson, who have insisted that the referendum result is not to be compromised, and that the arbitrary Oct. 31 deadline is inviolate.\n\nHe and they have falsely claimed that driving off an economic cliff will not so much as dent the country\u2019s standing and well-being. And Mr. Johnson in particular has tried to usurp Parliament in his vain effort to muscle through a calamity that no sensible person would have voted for in 2016 had they known the details of it.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nNow, democracy and common sense are back in vogue. The U.K. can\u2019t, by law, pull out of the EU without a deal in place to soften the economic consequences of Brexit, and it is up to Mr. Johnson see that this gets done. He has been cornered by his unwillingness to be reasonable in the past. That irony alone should make for a Happy Halloween.", "description": "While Canadians spend the next 21 days stocking up on mini chocolate bars, the wise Brit will be laying in precious stores of water and penicillin", "authors": ["Follow Us On Twitter"], "top_image": "https://www.theglobeandmail.com/resizer/5hIvn2_3csQkEnN_TgyJCGWvzNg=/1200x0/filters:quality(80)/arc-anglerfish-tgam-prod-tgam.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GHQZFMWQXJFE7B6CA7VLOW5FCI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
