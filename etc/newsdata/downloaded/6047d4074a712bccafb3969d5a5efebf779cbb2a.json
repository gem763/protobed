His cavalier, make-it-up-as-you-go-along approach is no longer convincing anyone.\n\nOne of the biggest lies of this whole mess is the idea that we can \u201cget Brexit done\u201d and move on quickly. The big question we face is how we want to spend the next decade. By endlessly talking about Brexit or by confronting all of the other challenges we face as a country from the NHS to climate change?\n\nThat\u2019s why I shall join the march and speak on Saturday to demand that the voice of the people is heard in a Final Say referendum on Brexit.\n\nWe are marching, not because we despise or despair of our democracy, but to defend it.\n\nWe are marching because we trust the people, not Boris Johnson, to solve the Brexit crisis.\n\nOn Saturday, the prime minister also has plans. He will be inside the gates of parliament for an emergency debate on his Brexit deal.\n\nBut should he care to listen, he will hear the voices from Parliament Square: young and old, rich and poor, left and right coming together because they know this matter cannot, must not, simply be left just to politicians like him.\n\nAlready in the Commons more and more MPs from every party support us.\n\nBut time is short. And, on Saturday, our voice must be heard as loudly and clearly as possible.\n\nIf you have marched before, or never marched and if you care about our country, join us.\n\nTogether, we can change the course of history.\n\nMichael Heseltine is president of the European Movement and a former defence secretary.\n\nAt midday this Saturday, the Brexit march will be from Park Lane to Parliament.
