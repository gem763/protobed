It also caught the attention of a number of Houston Astros players. Chief among them was pitcher Lance McCullers Jr., who saw the video of Arcia and sent out a tweet asking fans to find Arcia so he could give him World Series tickets.\n\nTwitter did its job and now here he was Arcia, wearing the same Jose Altuve jersey that soaked up the beer in the Bronx and sitting in section 127, what he called \u201creally good seats\u201d courtesy of McCullers.\n\n\u201cCan you tell me the story?\u201d the other Astros fan asked Arcia, and so he did. He talked about how he and his friends showed up at Yankee Stadium and they were warned first by their Uber driver and then by a police officer at the stadium not to wear their Astros gear inside the stadium.\n\nHe talked about the taunts and trash talk that lasted for innings.\n\n\u201cPeople kept saying \u2018Take your BBQ [expletive] home\u2019,\u201d Arcia said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThings got ugly, Arcia says, when he went to get some food. A Yankees fan asked to take a picture with Arcia. That\u2019s when, Arcia says, the Yankees fan tried to knock his food out of his hand while they took a selfie. Arcia ended up spilling his food on the Yankees fan and other nearby fans starting throwing things at him.\n\nCell phone video caught Arcia being saved by officers and then taunting the Yankees fans throwing things at him as he was escorted to new seats.\n\n\u201cIf I hit someone, I\u2019m gonna piss one person off,\u201d Arcia told his fellow Astros fan. \u201cIf I throw up 3-1, I\u2019m gonna piss everybody off. People were throwing beer and I didn\u2019t care. I knew it was getting them mad.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou went out like a beast,\u201d the other fan tells Arcia.\n\nArcia, a 21-year-old who works in IT, estimated that about 50 Astros fans had come up to him before Game 1 and either wanted to take a picture or shake his hand. He got three tickets from McCullers and came to Game 1 with the same two friends who were with him in New York. The three of them went to \u201cpretty much every game this season.\u201d\n\nThey had planned a birthday trip to New York trip two months ago. When it lined up with the Astros playing there in the ALCS, they had to get tickets.\n\n\u201cTo me, it was worth it,\u201d Arcia told Yahoo Sports. \u201cEven if I didn\u2019t get the free tickets it was worth it because I was out there representing my city. I didn\u2019t do this because I expected it to go viral. I did it because I love Houston. I\u2019ll go over there next year and rep my city again.\n\n\u201cMy phone hasn\u2019t stopped ringing for the last three days,\u201d Arcia said. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten so much love from all my Houston people. Everyone\u2019s been tweeting at me, sending me text messages. There\u2019s people sending me money on Venmo and Cash App saying, \u201cGet you a new shirt. Get you a beer.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs he\u2019s saying that, another Astros fan comes up to Arcia wants to snap a picture. He happily obliges. He\u2019ll play the local celebrity role as long as the Astros World Series run will allow.\n\n\u201cI was planning on being here anyway,\u201d Arcia said. \u201cBut I know I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford these tickets. I\u2019d be sitting way up there.\n\n\u201cShout out to Lance \u2014 the real MVP.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMike Oz is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
