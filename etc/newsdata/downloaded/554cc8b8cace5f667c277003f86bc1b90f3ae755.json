And Estonia\u2019s President Is Cool With It.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cFrankly speaking, I\u2019m on the same page\u201d as Trump regarding the 2-percent requirement, Kaljulaid\u2014an earnest, 49-year-old socially liberal policy wonk who in style is Trump\u2019s polar opposite\u2014told us.\n\nRead: Trump vs. NATO: It\u2019s not just about the money\n\n\u201cActually I\u2019m quite sorry: Thinking back historically, when everybody else said it nicely, we didn\u2019t react,\u201d she continued. \u201cI mean, Barack Obama said so as well, and then we said, \u2018It\u2019s all fine and dandy but we don\u2019t see it\u2019s a necessity.\u2019 It\u2019s an irony that with this more transactional policy-making style [of Trump\u2019s], we are now in Europe discussing 2 percent\u201d and promising to devote $100 billion more to security by the end of 2020, which \u201cis not peanuts.\u201d\n\nKaljulaid, who entered office shortly before Trump\u2019s election and met with him in Washington, D.C., last year, said she is confident the United States would come to Estonia\u2019s defense if it came under attack\u2014whether in the form of a military assault or, perhaps more concerning for a country in which 99 percent of government services are online, a cyberattack that infringed on its sovereignty. Estonia, which joined NATO 15 years ago, has spent at least 2 percent of its GDP on defense since 2015.\n\nOf course, the Estonian president has an incentive to remain in the good graces of the commander in chief of the most powerful military in NATO. But she traced her trust in Trump to commitments that she\u2019s heard the president make privately and publicly, Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s show of support during a visit to Estonia early in the administration, and a new U.S. pledge of military assistance and defense cooperation for Estonia.\n\nThe \u201cTwitter world\u201d should be distinguished from government policy making, she advised, without directly answering when asked whether this meant the American president\u2019s words don\u2019t matter. Judging by the Trump administration\u2019s actions, she noted, all is \u201cfine.\u201d\n\nRead: Lessons from the world\u2019s most tech-savvy government\n\nKaljulaid said greater European investment in its own defense is essential as the threat from Russia becomes less of a priority for the United States relative to that from China. \u201cRussia is a regional threat, a conventional [military] or even nuclear threat, but it\u2019s actually decreasing in power,\u201d she observed. \u201cIts demographics are bad. Its economy is horrible. Technologically, it\u2019s falling behind.\u201d\n\nAnd she defended her decision this spring to become the first Baltic leader in almost a decade to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin. In her view, this move\u2014along with calls by leaders such as Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron to end Russia\u2019s isolation over Ukraine\u2014doesn\u2019t mean the West is moving on from what the Kremlin did in 2014.\n\nSpeaking to a neighbor isn\u2019t the same as advocating that Europe make disproportionate concessions to Russia or signaling that Moscow can blatantly violate another country\u2019s sovereignty and eventually get away with it. \u201cNobody has said we will move on from the eastern-Ukraine problem and return to business as usual,\u201d she said, vowing not to recognize Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea. \u201cIf we ourselves had been stronger\u201d after Russia intervened militarily in Georgia in 2008, she argued, then Russia\u2019s incursion into Ukraine might not have occurred.", "description": "\u201cThinking back historically, when everybody else said it nicely, we didn\u2019t react,\u201d Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid told us.", "authors": ["Uri Friedman", "Yara Bayoumy"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTS2D6ZN/facebook.jpg?1569345508", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
