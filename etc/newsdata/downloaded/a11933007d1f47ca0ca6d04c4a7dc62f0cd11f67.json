Sprecher How states forced the NCAA\u2019s hand on student athlete endorsements\n\nSACRAMENTO \u2014 The National Collegiate Athletic Association\u2019s surprise decision Tuesday to allow student athletes to earn endorsement money was spurred by an unlikely alliance of states that typically disagree on everything from abortion to immigration.\n\nPressure from states, with California taking the lead and Florida, New York and New Jersey quickly piling on, broke down a longstanding NCAA rule prohibiting student athletes from earning money from endorsements and other outside sponsorships.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nTheir stand appears all but certain to change the landscape of college sports. On Tuesday, the NCAA Board of Directors voted unanimously to allow students to financially benefit from the use of their name, image and likeness \"in a manner consistent with the collegiate model.\u201d\n\nThe vote comes after more than a decade of complaints and festering cynicism over the status of student athletes \u2014 who earn nothing while their colleges and coaches reap riches \u2014 and just a month after California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the Fair Pay to Play Act on the set of LeBron James\u2019 HBO show, \u201cThe Shop.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout the public clearly on the side of the rights of student athletes, and the governor signing my bill, and the rest of the states following suit, the NCAA absolutely wouldn't have acted,\u201d said California state Sen. Nancy Skinner (D-Berkeley), who authored the legislation Newsom signed. \u201cWhether you come from the fact that this has been an exploitation of black athletes or come at it from that it\u2019s just a violation of every free-market principle ... it's a change that was so ripe for right now.\u201d\n\nA profusion of similar state and federal efforts have since kicked off to fight the billion-dollar behemoth that is the NCAA.\n\nOn Oct. 24, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, an ardent sports fan and former Yale baseball captain, said he would back legislation to allow student athletes to profit from their names and likenesses.\n\nThe Republican was struck to get behind the movement while watching a football game at the University of Florida\u2019s stadium, commonly called \u201cThe Swamp.\u201d As he watched the Florida Gators and Auburn University duke it out in Gainesville, Fla., he wondered why members of the marching band could make money on YouTube, but the players couldn\u2019t.\n\nThe issue has bipartisan support in Florida and is \u201cgonna have legs,\u201d DeSantis told reporters Tuesday as NCAA leaders huddled in Atlanta.\n\nDeSantis credited California for opening the door, but said that another powerhouse college athletic state joining the fray added to the resistance that turned the tide. Florida is home to the University of Florida, Florida State University, the University of Miami and other schools with massive athletic programs that battle to win top recruits.\n\nThe argument in the Sunshine State has centered on athletes deserving to participate in an economy that was built on the backs of students. Social media platforms are ripe for student athletes to cash in, lawmakers have noted, but they\u2019re forbidden by current NCAA rules from doing so.\n\nColorado, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada and Pennsylvania are among those following the Golden State\u2019s lead. All are weighing legislation to allow student athletes to be paid in outright defiance of the NCAA.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about time. The status quo was clearly unacceptable,\u201d New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, said in an interview on News 12 late Tuesday.\n\nThe political talking points of state lawmakers vary, but the central sentiment and intended outcome are the same: Student athletes should be allowed to benefit from their talents.\n\nThe NCAA, the Pacific-12 Conference, coaches and others have fought state efforts to make their own rules, saying a patchwork of policies would cause confusion and the \u201cprofessionalization\u201d of college sports would create an unfair playing ground for half a million student athletes nationwide.\n\n\u201cWe must embrace change to provide the best possible experience for college athletes,\" Michael Drake, NCAA board chair and president of Ohio State University, said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nA wave of state-level bipartisanship has quickly rolled over those arguments. And the NCAA\u2019s vote on Tuesday won\u2019t stop state lawmakers from adopting their own rules and creating the patchwork the association is trying to prevent.\n\nNew Jersey state Sen. Joseph Lagana (D-Bergen), a former college athlete who is sponsoring student athlete legislation, said piecemeal legislation isn\u2019t ideal but had to happen.\n\n\u201cSometimes you need to send a shot across the bow for things to get moving,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the liberal West coast, racial justice issues have taken center stage in the debate to reform an industry where predominantly white coaches are being compensated while black athletes who sacrifice their bodies for certain sports are not.\n\nDuring committee hearings in Sacramento this summer, Los Angeles Chargers football player Russell Okung, who is black, told lawmakers that the NCAA uses exploitative policies and \u201coutdated logic rooted in slavery.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, red states including Kentucky and South Carolina have joined the fight, calling it a common-sense free market proposal.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney of Utah, a former Republican presidential candidate, and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, who is vying for the Democratic presidential nomination, have both called for NCAA reform this month despite being political polar opposites on other policy issues.\n\nFormer UCLA gymnast Katelyn Ohashi spoke out earlier this month against not being able to benefit from her stellar senior year, including being metaphorically \u201chandcuffed\u201d by the NCAA, she said, which restricted her from receiving a YouTube check for her perfect floor routine that went viral earlier this year.\n\n\u201cFor us to regulate their ability to monetize what they\u2019ve built up over time strictly because they\u2019re student athletes, it goes against a free market,\u201d Florida state Rep. Kionne McGhee (D-Cutler Bay) told POLITICO. McGhee and Chip LaMarca (R-Lighthouse Point) have each filed student athlete bills in Florida.\n\nWhile the NCAA received praise for Tuesday\u2019s decision \u2014 a move that followed months of threats from the athletic association that if the California legislation passed it could lead to the state\u2019s schools being disqualified from competitions \u2014 state lawmakers aren\u2019t backing off.\n\n\u201cCalifornia will be closely watching as the NCAA\u2019s process moves forward to ensure the rules ultimately adopted are aligned with the legislation we passed this year,\u201d Newsom said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nLaMarca said he is cautiously optimistic.\n\n\u201cWe will continue working to make sure they keep the promises they have made to our student athletes today,\u201d he said in a written statement.\n\nMiami Dolphins player Davon Godchaux issued a statement praising the Florida legislation, and gave states credit.\n\n\u201cIf this is something that made the NCAA comfortable,\u201d he said, \u201cthey would have done this a long time ago.\u201d\n\nCarly Sitrin contributed to this report.", "description": "Pressure from states broke down a longstanding NCAA rule prohibiting student athletes from earning money from endorsements and other sponsorships.", "authors": ["Mackenzie Mays", "Andrew Atterbury"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/fe/c1/258b26a84267bab005bbdb5ef52f/1029ncaa.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
