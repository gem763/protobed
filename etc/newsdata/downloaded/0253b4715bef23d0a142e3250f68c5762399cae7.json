The Federal Trade Commission is now suing the matchmaking giant, claiming in a complaint filed Wednesday that it had used the phony love-interest ads to trick people into purchasing its services.\n\n\u201cWe believe that Match.com conned people into paying for subscriptions via messages the company knew were from scammers,\u201d Andrew Smith, director of the FTC\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a news release. \u201cOnline dating services obviously shouldn\u2019t be using romance scammers as a way to fatten their bottom line.\u201d\n\n[Fraudsters tried to steal more than $40 million in one of the biggest online scam cases in U.S. history]\n\nDating sites and apps are often used to perpetuate fraud, federal officials said, with scammers posing as suitors. Between 2015 and 2017, the FTC said in its complaint, consumers reported losing an estimated $884 million to romance scams. That figure is probably low, since many victims choose not to report such fraud, perhaps out of embarrassment. And there are costs beyond the financial: The FTC said the crimes \u201ccause significant emotional distress\u201d because they exploit trust and goodwill.\n\nIn the world of online dating, Match is a heavy hitter. It was founded in 1993, before most Americans had Internet access, as Business Insider noted in a story on the company\u2019s founder and chief executive. Today, the FTC says, Match Group controls about 25 percent of the online dating market and owns around 45 dating services, among them familiar names like Tinder, Hinge, OkCupid and Plenty of Fish.\n\nThe Dallas-based company on Wednesday criticized the FTC\u2019s lawsuit as making \u201ccompletely meritless allegations supported by consciously misleading figures.\u201d In a response published on its website, Match said it is \u201crelentless\u201d in shutting down malicious accounts.\n\n[Romance scams cost Americans $143 million last year, FTC says]\n\n\u201cThe FTC has misrepresented internal emails and relied on cherry-picked data to make outrageous claims and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims in court,\u201d the statement said.\n\nMatch.com allows anyone to sign up for an account and browse profiles free of charge. But a paid subscription is required to view communications from other users, such as \u201clikes,\u201d \u201cfavorites,\u201d emails or instant messages. When a nonsubscriber gets an automatically generated email telling them they\u2019ve attracted interest, they\u2019ll have to sign up to see. Many are inclined to do just that. Between June 2016 and May 2018, almost 500,000 subscriptions were purchased within 24 hours of getting an email \u201ctouting a fraudulent communication,\u201d the FTC\u2019s complaint said.\n\nWhen a new subscriber tried to communicate with the person who had supposedly expressed interest, they either gained access to the fraudulent communication \u2014 exposing them to fraud \u2014 or were notified the person\u2019s profile was \u201cunavailable.\u201d In many cases, the FTC said, Match did not notify the consumer that the account was believed to be fraudulent.\n\nIn a fact sheet, the company said the majority of users the FTC described as fraudulent are not romance scammers but \u201cspam, bots, and other users attempting to use the service for their own commercial purposes.\u201d In addition, it eliminated instant messages and \u201cfavorites\u201d from the site. Email, which has a fraud rate of less than 1 percent, is now the main form of communication, the company said.\n\nThe FTC also took issue with Match\u2019s alleged failure to disclose the requirements of its guaranteed free subscriptions for those who don\u2019t find \u201csomeone special\u201d and its \u201cconfusing and cumbersome\u201d cancellation process.\n\nMatch said that in November the FTC offered to resolve the dispute with a $60 million settlement and a consent decree requiring changes in the company\u2019s practices. The two sides failed to reach a resolution, prompting the lawsuit. An FTC spokeswoman said Thursday she had no comment on those claims.\n\nRead more:\n\nMattel helped define gender norms for decades with Barbie and Ken.
