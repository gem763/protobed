And yet, as eager as I am to fly off the handle about this, a question must be asked:\n\nDoes the league usually allow political signs at games? You don\u2019t see much political sloganeering in the stands at American spectator sports, partly because most fans leave that behind when they\u2019re in game mode but partly because the teams recognize it\u2019s bad for business. The risk of political squabbles breaking out among paying customers and the risk to the team in being sucked into political disputes makes a zero-tolerance policy towards political signs \u2014 of any stripe \u2014 the safest option.\n\nSo, again, was this a case of the Sixers enforcing a neutral policy or are Hong Kong supporters being singled out for special suppression? Because if it\u2019s the latter, it\u2019s another data point that the Chinese are assimilating U.S. corporations into their values system, not vice versa.\n\nHere are the controversial signs. I know, earth shattering right? Obvious why the NBA would have a problem with this.

Do they enforce it? If I bring a \u201cTrump 2020\u201d or \u201cBiden 2020\u201d sign to the game, will I actually be kicked out or will that be ignored as a de minimis infraction whereas \u201cFree Hong Kong\u201d is unacceptable because it annoys Adam Silver\u2019s Chinese masters?\n\nShould the NBA have a \u201cno political signs,\u201d by the way? A Twitter pal notes that it\u2019s rich that the world\u2019s \u201cwokest professional sports league\u201d has no problem with activism among coaches and players, up to and including political messages being worn on warm-up attire before the game, while the plebes who pay their salaries are forbidden to broadcast their own views during NBA events.\n\nChina, meanwhile, continues to grind its boot in the NBA\u2019s face because of a single pro-Hong-Kong tweet by a single employee of a single team.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 NBA Cares event in Shanghai was canceled Wednesday just hours before it was scheduled to begin, according to multiple reports. The cancellation is the latest fallout from a recent tweet by Rockets GM Daryl Morey that showed support for anti-government protesters in Hong Kong. The NBA said the cancellation off the Lakers event, which was supposed to benefit the Special Olympics, was not its decision. This came a day after the Chinese government canceled the Nets\u2019 NBA Cares event.\n\nThe Lakers and Nets are scheduled to play two exhibition games this week but banners in Shanghai promoting the game are being taken down, so who knows? China\u2019s obviously sending a message to the league that any further pro-HK statements \u2014 by anyone \u2014 will risk a total rupture of the NBA\u2019s relationship with China. Does anyone think a single person connected to the league will dare call their bluff in the name of supporting human rights in Hong Kong?\n\nThe worst part of the Sam Wachs sign incident, by the way, is that if the Sixers didn\u2019t have a \u201cno political signs\u201d policy before \u2014 or if they did but weren\u2019t enforcing it \u2014 they certainly will now. In order to feign neutrality while carrying out censorship at China\u2019s behest, they\u2019ll take away *more* freedom by paying customers at NBA games. Again, between Chinese totalitarianism and western capitalism, who\u2019s assimilating whom?", "description": "\"We were saying, \u2018Free Hong Kong.'
