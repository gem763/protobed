They live mainly in coastal waters around the north and west of Australia and the Philippines, according to the university's press release.\n\nEach tentacle has millions of microscopic hooks filled with venom, and the jellyfish carries enough venom to kill more than 60 humans, the university said. Associate Professor Greg Neely, one of the study's authors, said no other animal carries that amount of venom.\n\nThe venom can cause tissue necrosis, extreme pain, cardiac arrest and death within minutes after severe exposure. If it doesn't kill, the venom can cause excruciating pain.\n\nThe research team used the gene-editing technique known as CRISPR to identify how the venom kills human cells.\n\nRead More", "description": "Researchers at the University of Sydney say they have discovered a potential antidote for the sting of the world's most venomous sea creature: the Australian box jellyfish.", "authors": ["Joshua Berlinger"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190501022600-box-jellyfish-01-restricted-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-05-01"}
