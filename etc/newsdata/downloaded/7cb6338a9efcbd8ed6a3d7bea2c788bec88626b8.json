Razer\u2019s new Seiren Emote, announced today at TwitchCon, comes with a built-in 8-bit emoticon display that can link to Twitch and react dynamically to subscriptions, follows and chat messages.\n\nUsing Razer\u2019s Streamer Companion App in conjunction with the $250.95 hypercardioid condenser microphone, streamers can quickly and easily set up custom reactions to all sorts of Twitch actions.\n\nAnimated emoticons can play when users subscribe, donate or follow the streamer. Multiple emoticons can be set to play at once when triggered. Twitch streamers can create their own custom emoticons and set them to go off when viewers type in certain words or phrases, building their brand and engaging with the community at the same time.\n\nThe software, currently in beta (it\u2019s now available for download here), is easy to use. I don\u2019t stream regularly myself (I\u2019m working on it), and I quickly connected to my Twitch account and set up an emoticon to play when someone followed my channel.\n\nI connected the Seiren Emote, selected the rainbow vomit emoticon, hit test and voila.\n\nRazer\u2019s Streamer Companion App isn\u2019t only for the Seiren Emote. A wide range of devices can be linked up, from Razer\u2019s upcoming lighted Kitty Ear Kraken headset and other Chroma lighting-enabled gear to Philips Hue bulbs and those cool lighted wall panel things my wife won\u2019t let me buy.\n\nDuring an online demonstration of the software earlier this week, I watched a streamer\u2019s room explode with light after I typed into their Twitch chat. It was pretty impressive.\n\nAlong with providing a nifty little light show, the Razer Seiren Emote is also a very lovely microphone. It\u2019s quite similar to the non-lighted Seiren X, with its built-in shock mount and slim form factor. Along with the default short stand, the Emote also comes packaged with a gooseneck extension for added height.\n\nAs someone who prefers hiding behind their microphone during live broadcasts, I am fully prepared for my input device to take centre stage. You can find out more about the Seiren Emote over at Razer\u2019s website.", "description": "A large percentage of on-camera streamers share the screen with microphones that do nothing but sit there and capture sound.
