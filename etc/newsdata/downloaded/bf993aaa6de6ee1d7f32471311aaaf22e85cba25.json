It had two grey barns she hoped to paint poinsettia red, a woodworking shop full of tools, a woodlot thick with mature cedar trees, a rocky hill out back and a bungalow in need of renovation. It would be a fix, in her calculations, that would take the custom furniture maker about six months to complete.\n\n\u201cAll the tools were there, there were no neighbours and the price was right,\u201d she said.\n\nThe property in Eldorado was perfect, but then Woodside, a history buff, asked the old codger she was buying it from about the blue historical plaque on the highway nearby. He answered with a question: Was she a \u201cgold digger?\u201d\n\nWoodside didn\u2019t appreciate the comment, but it wasn\u2019t entirely uncalled for, not after he explained that the place she hoped would change her life had changed other lives when the Richardson gold mine, Ontario\u2019s first, was discovered beneath it in 1866.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about rocks or mines or the story of Eldorado,\u201d she said. \u201cI grew up in Prince Edward Island on a sandbar. Rocks for me basically meant the Rockies.\u201d\n\nCanadian mining lore is fired by stories of the Klondike rush of the 1890s, of Skookum Jim and Dawson Charlie, Bonanza Creek, brave Mounties, starving prospectors, pack mules, scallywags, women of ill repute and savage winters, all stirred into a character-rich stew the poet Robert Service \u2014 the so-called Bard of the Yukon \u2014 mythologized with lines about the \u201cstrange things done under the midnight sun by the men who moil for gold.\u201d\n\nEven stranger still, perhaps, is an enduring belief among some that Ontario\u2019s first gold mine could be the epicentre of Canada\u2019s next gold rush, a mere two-hour drive northeast of downtown Toronto.\n\nBut first, about that blue historical plaque: it is obscured from view by a pine tree and directly across a two-lane highway from a dilapidated hotel, a ghostly looking white two-storey joint with busted-out windows. It is among the few physical reminders that once upon a rush, Eldorado, population 50, was briefly home to 4,000.\n\nBefore the boom, the inhabitants were typically poor Irish immigrants, working rocky tracts of land, living in rough log cabins and presumably cursing the fates, since the rock gave way to fertile fields a few kilometres south.\n\nSuch was the lot of farmer John Richardson before Aug. 15, 1866. On that date, Marcus Powell, a part-time prospector and sometime county court clerk, was in a hole 15-feet deep on a hill overlooking the Richardson property, whacking away at a seam of copper with a pick and shovel, when he broke into a cave.\n\nYears later, he described it as \u201c12 feet long, six feet wide and six feet high.\u201d The cave walls dripped with golden \u201cleaves.\u201d The largest nugget was the size of a \u201cbutternut.\u201d The rush was on.\n\nMiners, speculators, scam artists and more poured into the region from as far away as California. A place that hadn\u2019t been marked on a map suddenly became known as Eldorado, Spanish for the \u201cgolden one.\u201d Hotels, shops and saloons sprang up. Fights broke out. Sergeant-Major William Foxton, hero of the Crimean War, arrived with a troupe of mounted police to keep the peace.\n\nMeanwhile, trouble was brewing on Richardson\u2019s hill. Whispers suggested there wasn\u2019t any gold. John \u201cCariboo\u201d Cameron, a veteran of previous rushes in British Columbia and California, took it upon himself to investigate, heading a march of 150 concerned citizens to the mine\u2019s entrance. Negotiations ensued.\n\nTwo professional miners were finally granted access to the cave. Their verdict, as reported by the Belleville Intelligencer on May 2, 1867, was unequivocal: the Richardson mine was of \u201cunparalleled richness.\u201d\n\nOnly, alas, it wasn\u2019t. Richardson\u2019s cave was basically it. By 1868, the boom was bust. All that remained was for a historical plaque to be erected a century later.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of excavation at the Richardson mine, but there wasn\u2019t much tonnage produced,\u201d said Peter LeBaron, a geologist with Ontario\u2019s Ministry of Energy, Northern Development and Mines.\n\nLeBaron works out of an office in Tweed, not far from Eldorado. He drives a white Ontario government pickup truck with an interior light that won\u2019t shut off. He is tanned from working outdoors and looks the part of the 21st century prospector, with a red mineral vest, beat-up blue jeans, hiking boots and a reinforced backpack for carrying rock samples.\n\nThirty years ago, when he was working in private industry, he went poking around the cave. The entire hillside is pocked with antique mine shafts, now fenced off with rusty wire and marked by danger signs.\n\nDifferent accounts of the boom attach differing values to the amount of gold dug from the earth. Some say it was as much as $100,000 at the time, others say $60,000. LeBaron settles on $1,500-$2,000, about 100 ounces of gold \u2014 peanuts considering the buzz the find initially generated.\n\nBut just because there wasn\u2019t much gold found way back when doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t more gold to be found now.\n\nOl\u2019 Marcus Powell relied on dynamite and a shovel to burrow into the rock, reaching depths of 100 feet. Modern diamond drills bite a kilometre or more beneath the Earth\u2019s surface. There is geomapping and geochemistry. It is not 1866, which is a not an insignificant point, said John McCance, president of the Southern Ontario Prospectors Association.\n\nGeographically speaking, McCance\u2019s position makes him the Rodney Dangerfield of his profession. Images of Ontario\u2019s northern reaches \u2014 Timmins, Sudbury, Kirkland Lake, perhaps a remote bush camp or two \u2014 are what spring to mind when people speak of mining in the province, and not an almost-ghost town 58 kilometres north of Belleville on a highway favoured by city slickers looking to escape to a lake.\n\nIn McCance\u2019s view, southern Ontario\u2019s mineral potential can\u2019t get any respect.\n\n\u201cMy concern is that modern technology has never been applied to look in the area,\u201d he said. \u201cWe obviously had gold near the surface of the Richardson mine, so is there anything bigger down below?\u201d\n\nLeBaron, the ministry geologist, pulls his truck onto a property five kilometres north of Eldorado. He grabs his backpack and starts walking, heading through a tangle of prickly bushes to a rock that looks like any other rock to the untrained eye until viewed up close through a hand lens. Lo and behold, there it is, a pinprick of native gold, undisturbed, yellow, enchanting, Mother Nature\u2019s gift to human vanity.\n\nAlmost 80 per cent of the gold mined annually worldwide is used to produce jewellery. Gold never tarnishes. It can be hammered, drawn into a wire, pounded into a sheet, stretched and shaped, melted and reformed and worn as rings by lovers until death doth do them part, and even when it does do them part, the gold persists in its perfection.\n\n\n\nThe Egyptians loved the stuff. Still do. The markets have, too. Gold is trading near record highs of $2,000 an ounce, and McCance and LeBaron can\u2019t understand why resource companies don\u2019t appear more interested in taking a much closer look at the region around Eldorado.\n\n\u201cThere is a favourable horizon for gold deposits in this area,\u201d LeBaron said.\n\nFor instance, the property north of the old Richardson mine is estimated to have about 145,000 ounces in gold reserves, according to a 2016 Ontario Geological Survey report. It is not the motherlode \u2014 after all, a modern mine cranks out 40,000 ounces a month \u2014 but it is something, especially if viewed as an indicator of perhaps bigger things to come in nearby places, and at greater depths.\n\nKim Woodside has her own thoughts on where the gold horizon lies. After buying a property with a historic mine on it, she went looking for the mine. She read historical accounts, checked records, thumbed through books, studied rocks and, ultimately, climbed down into the cave using an old cellphone tower as a ladder.\n\nShe cleared brush, marked trails with red plastic flashes, erected some display boards detailing the history and started a small business taking \u201crock hounds\u201d on tours of the property for $20 a head, an operation she recently shuttered after receiving an offer to sell the place \u201cthat was too good to be true.\u201d\n\nAs for the gold, Woodside believes it never left the hill.\n\n\u201cThe gold is still there,\u201d she said, sounding certain.\n\nJohn Richardson, the poor Irishman of days gone by, netted $21,000 from the mine. Not directly from the gold, per se, but from selling the mineral rights to the property. He died in 1882 having never left the farm, and is buried in a local cemetery. He had sons and daughters, though, who had sons and daughters, and as generations of Richardsons moved on from Eldorado, the story of the mine moved with them.\n\nThe gold is still there Kim Woodside\n\nOne of the descendants, John Richardson, six generations removed from John R. the First, is a Toronto-based venture capitalist. He remembers his father, a pediatric dentist, telling him of the mine\u2019s existence, a childhood story he suspected was untrue and mostly forgot until his brother, Paul, a private investment adviser at Toronto-Dominion Bank in Guelph, Ont., phoned him in 2005. Paul had met a distant relative at a running race. The fabled mine wasn\u2019t fatherly fiction after all.\n\n\u201cIt turns out, we were a missing family link in the Richardson family tree,\u201d John said.\n\nBefore long, he was up to his eyeballs in genealogical records, and on his way to the first of two Richardson family reunions he has attended in Eldorado.\n\nThe event attracts descendants from across North America. Locals cook, a band plays, stories get told, people dance and the whole group, perhaps as many as 150, make a pilgrimage to the mine, peering down into the darkness from whence prospector Powell\u2019s golden cave first came to light.\n\nInvariably, a couple of attendees will notice they\u2019re wearing identical gold rings: simple, thin bands passed down through their respective families. As the story goes, the rings were gifts the original John Richardson gave to his children \u2014 along with cattle \u2014 to encourage them to go forth and make lives for themselves.\n\nIn this way, the mine serves as a common thread, tying past to present, binding family, sustaining a belief in the power of gold. Richardson and his brother can\u2019t escape the precious metal\u2019s attraction. Both hold it, as did their father, in their investment portfolios.\n\n\u201cIt is like you can\u2019t deny the family heritage,\u201d John said.\n\nThe brothers view the old mine as an opportunity, not to start drilling and blasting into the rock in search of more bounty, but to build upon the work Woodside started and transform the site into a more legitimate, government-funded heritage destination. LeBaron, the government man, has the same wish.\n\n\u201cThe mine tells the story of the Irish that came to the area in difficult times and had a stroke of luck,\u201d Paul Richardson said. \u201cThat is a story worth preserving.\u201d\n\nWoodside is now 60, and past her mid-life crisis. She is reluctant to disclose details about the mine\u2019s new owners, but offers a few hints. One is named Kenny. They operate restaurants in Toronto. They are not interested in giving tours to the public.\n\n\u201cThat property will give them everything they need,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was hard for me to leave it.\u201d\n\nWith the loot from the sale, Woodside purchased a heritage home in Summerside, P.E.I. She is fixing the place up, and plans to display her rock collection on the main floor, including, of course, some bewitching yellow samples from Ontario\u2019s oldest gold mine.\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: joconnor@nationalpost.com | Twitter: oconnorwrites", "description": "In 1866, a cave dripping with gold was found in Eldorado, fuelling a boom that became a bust.
