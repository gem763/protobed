But with no team willing to sign him while the league continues to investigate civil allegations of sexual assault and rape, Brown is as a practical matter serving an unpaid suspension.\n\nAnd he\u2019s apparently starting to get frustrated by his status. On Tuesday morning, Brown tweeted, \u201cFree AB.\u201d\n\nSome quota-filling news about nothing percolated over the weekend regarding his desire to return to the NFL (duh) and his interest in returning to the Patriots (double duh). The impediment continues to be the investigation.\n\nIt\u2019s still unclear when the investigation will end. At some point, the league will interview Brown. And unless he gets good advice (and heeds it) on how to behave when being interviewed for the league, he may not be free to sign with any NFL team for a while.\n\nWhenever he\u2019s cleared to return, he\u2019ll likely have a market for his services, thanks both to his talent and the genetic defect that causes every coach to think he can get the most out of a troubled player. The ongoing delays in the investigative process are operating, intended or not, as a barrier to Brown being gainfully employed. Although he\u2019s hardly a sympathetic figure, there\u2019s a fairness component to this process that needs to be respected by the league \u2014 and highlighted by the media.", "description": "Free-agent receiver Antonio Brown is technically free to sign with another team.
