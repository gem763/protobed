(\u201ciSIGN\u201d or \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSX-V: ISD) (OTC: ISDSF), a leading provider of interactive mobile advertising solutions that serves brands, commercial locations, retailers and service providers throughout North America, today announced the exercise of one million previously issued and outstanding warrants priced at $0.10 by Korona Group Ltd. (\u201cKorona\u201d).\n\n\n\nKorona is a company wholly owned by Josip Kozar, iSIGN\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and is a major shareholder. Korona\u2019s exercise of warrants priced at a significant premium above current market price is a major statement of confidence in the direction the Company is taking, as well as in iSIGN\u2019s future growth and valuation. Based upon iSIGN\u2019s three-year renewable contract with Hi-Tek Media and other ongoing initiatives, the Company expects that it will be cash flow positive and self-sustainable within the foreseeable future.\n\nFurther exercise of warrants by Korona will be considered as required to allow for the future purchase and preparation of hardware components for our reseller in the United States to continue in their building of a one-of-a-kind mobile communications network powered by iSIGN\u2019s patented technology and utilizing iSIGN hardware.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe that iSIGN\u2019s patented technology is not properly understood and valued by the market, nor reflected in the current market price of our shares,\u201d stated Mr. Josip Kozar, iSIGN\u2019s Chief Executive Officer. \u201cWe believe we are in a position to see a great growth in revenue within the coming months as the Omni Veil network is scaled upwards in Nevada and additional states, as well as from the completion of other existing initiatives and other potential opportunities.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, iSIGN wishes to announce that at this time it will not be following through on its intentions to complete a private placement of up to $250,000.\n\nThe decision to not proceed with this placement has been taken due to the recent press release by our reseller, Hi-Tek Media, and their related order for 100 Smart Antennas and 100 PODX units for use in emergency vehicles operated by Quality Towing (division of United Road Towing Inc.) and the Company\u2019s desire to avoid unnecessary dilution arising from the issuance of shares and related warrants at this time.\n\nWe would like to thank all shareholders for their ongoing support throughout this exciting process.\n\nAbout iSIGN Media\n\niSIGN, a Canadian company based in Toronto, Ontario is a data-focused, software-as-a-service (SaaS) company that is a pioneering leader in the areas of location-based security alert messaging and proximity marketing utilizing Bluetooth\u00ae and Wi-Fi connectivity in complete privacy.
