For all his open-book ebullience, there were still things Almod\u00f3var had kept hidden, especially the extent to which he must navigate wrenching pain as a daily indignity. After he sent the screenplay to Banderas and his other frequent collaborators, including the actress Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and his producer-brother, Agust\u00edn, \u201call of them came back to me really worried,\u201d Almod\u00f3var recalled. \u201cThey were saying, \u2018Are you really as bad off as Salvador is? Are you suffering that much?\u2019\u201d\n\nFortunately, there are a few key differences. Mallo turns to a newfound heroin habit to cope with his pain, while Almod\u00f3var swears he\u2019s never touched the stuff. And though Banderas wears his hair grayed and unruly for the role, it\u2019s no match for the actual Almod\u00f3var\u2019s famous, dandelion-like pouf, a sign that this is much more than just an easy impersonation. (In May, Banderas took the best-actor trophy at the Cannes Film Festival for his deeply felt performance.)\n\n\u201cBut the character doesn\u2019t moan about his ailments, and I\u2019m not a person who complains, either,\u201d Almod\u00f3var noted. To use the parlance of pain, Almod\u00f3var decided to rip the Band-Aid off: If he was going to let the whole world know what\u2019s been hurting him , he had no intention of milking any of it for sympathy. Instead, he spends a minute and 20 seconds of \u201cPain and Glory\u201d listing all of his physical troubles in a tidy animated sequence.\n\nIt\u2019s a gut punch of grievances, though he couldn\u2019t help but make it colorful, too.", "description": "The director who surprised even friends with his confessional new drama, \u201cPain and Glory,\u201d has turned inward, in life and on the screen.", "authors": ["Kyle Buchanan"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/06/arts/06pedro-almodovar1/06pedro-almodovar1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
