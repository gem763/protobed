Although he is widely expected to win, an election seen as less than credible could undermine a two-month-old peace deal ending hostilities with Frelimo\u2019s old foe, the Renamo party.\n\nThe stakes this time round are particularly high. Impoverished Mozambique is on the threshold of becoming a major gas exporter, and a return to violence would spook investors and donors that have helped it recover from a corruption-induced debt scandal and Cyclone Idai, which ravaged swathes of the country earlier this year.\n\n\u201cMozambique has chosen peace,\u201d Mr Nyusi said after casting his ballot in the capital, Maputo.\n\nVoting passed off without major incident, although seven polling stations in the north, where an Islamist insurgency has killed hundreds, were closed, denying some the chance to vote.\n\nBut pre-election skulduggery has exacerbated tensions. Earlier this month, Anastasio Matavel, a senior election observer, was killed in the pro-government Gaza province, with police forced to acknowledge responsibility.", "description": "Mozambique\u2019s president was on course for re-election today after a controversial campaign marred by the murder of a senior election observer reawakened fears of a return to violence in a country plagued by a history of civil war.", "authors": ["Catrina Stewart", "Douglas Carswell", "Shanker Singham", "Asa Bennett", "Pieter Cleppe", "Tom Harris"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/15/TELEMMGLPICT000213072575-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
