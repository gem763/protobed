Wilder-Fury II should happen on 22 February in Vegas this time, and despite the cut and a couple of rounds off, Fury was dominant.\n\nThe gulf in quality between the best fighters of the world and the rest is something that causes concern, but that level of top quality is something special. Not many can argue that Fury is the No 1 in the heavyweight division right now and with Wilder lacking a wide skillset , he better keep training up his one trick: that power shot. It's a fantastic shot but, as has been said many times, if a 60% Fury was able to dominate and arguably beat the Bronze Bomber first time around almost a year ago, what will this Fury be able to do to him?\n\nThat power of Wilder's is unique and unlike anything else, but Fury is getting stronger and stronger, at this point will anything or anyone be able to stop him?\n\nThe best overcome the worst\n\nIt might not have been vintage Fury in there on Sunday morning, but the best overcome their worst nightmares.\n\nIn less than a year, Fury has been forced to climb off the canvas twice and fight 10 championship rounds with a blinding cut. He remains unbeaten.\n\nHe might not have beaten Wallin in the way that he wanted but a fight like that will stand him in good stead going into another mega fight against Wilder.\n\nThis is still a new team\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the worst I\u2019ve seen from Tyson,\u201d John Fury told BT Sport Box Office.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of how he has mauled his way through but he has to be honest and say things are not right. For a man to be in that condition after eight weeks camp it looked like he had nothing after round two.\n\n\u201cHis strength and power went tonight, he was as weak as a kitten from the first round. At 18st 1, I\u2019ve warned him and warned him. He is a 19-stone fighter.\n\n\u201cIf I had my way, the lot [Tyson\u2019s team] would be gone. If they keep that team that will be his career [gone].\u201d\n\nFury has been under the tutelage of Ben Davison for five fights now. Sefer Seferi, Francesco Pianeta, Wilder, Schwarz and now Wallin. This is a new team, Davison is a 26-year-old coach thrown in at the deep end.\n\nJohn might be right about the weight, he needs to use his big size to his advantage and perhaps coming in at just over 18st isn't best for him - but the team is solid. The team has taken Tyson from dark days back to the prize ring.\n\nMuch more than just being a top quality boxing coach, Davison and co. have taken Fury from the dark periods of his life to more positive than ever. The team is young and the belts are close. With another world title shot just around the corner, Fury will certainly be keeping ahold of the team that has got him back to the top.", "description": "Tyson Fury beat Otto Wallin by unanimous decision, but it was a pair of cuts to the eye of the Gypsy King that will dominate discussion.
