Nordli, chief of OURO, told Eurovision.\n\n\"Fish bred in facilities are not fit to live in the sea or rivers, only at the facilities,\" Nordli said. \"But when accidents happen it is important we have the tools to make amends.\"\n\nEurovision\n\nThe organization expects to spend around 6 million kroner, or more than $650,000, on the operation.\n\nABC News' Joshua Hoyos contributed to this report.", "description": "Fish hunters in Norway are trying to round up as many of the hundreds of thousands of salmon that have escaped breeding facilities this year as they can.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/salmon-ht-er-191009_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
