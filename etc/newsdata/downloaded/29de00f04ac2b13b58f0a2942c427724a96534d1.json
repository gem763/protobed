Photo: Netflix\n\nSpoilers below for El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie.\n\nAfter a most distressing turn of events in El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie \u2014 which include a touching and suspenseful reunion with his buddies, flashbacks of his torturous time in captivity, and having to commit two more murders \u2014 Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul) is safe and free in the Last Frontier. Yeah, Alaska! Or, yeah, writer-director Vince Gilligan, creator of the Emmy-winning series that introduced the world to the immature, sweet, broken Jesse Pinkman, lover of pizza and connoisseur of magnets!\n\nThe Netflix film picks up after Jesse, driving his captor\u2019s El Camino, smashes through the gates of the white supremacist compound where he was enslaved in the last season of Breaking Bad. What follows in El Camino is the story of how Jesse finally manages to pull himself out of the tragic chaos that became his life, after agreeing to a meth-cooking partnership with his former high-school teacher Walter White. Of course, his escape isn\u2019t easy.\n\nBut Gilligan told Vulture he almost wrote a different ending for Jesse\u2019s story, one that would have made the show\u2019s fans very, very sad (or very, very mad). Why did he change his mind? Because, he says, \u201cSometimes you just got to give folks what they want.\u201d Gilligan also discussed bringing back Walt (Bryan Cranston) for a flashback from the duo\u2019s good old RV days, and why he chose Dr. Hook\u2019s 1978 \u201cSharing the Night Together\u201d to soundtrack the sociopathic adventures of Jesse Plemons\u2019s Todd.\n\nAfter Breaking Bad ended, you said that Jesse Pinkman was free, that he successfully got away. All these years, you maintained that. But I wondered if you had second thoughts as you started to write the movie. Were there other possibilities you considered?\n\n\ufeffYes, I did. I like irony in storytelling. I love ironic twists. Once I had set about coming up with this movie, for the longest time, I had it in my mind that the thing we wanted most to see was for Jesse to escape. And the thing he wanted most to do was escape. So I was trying to concoct a plot in which, hero that he is, he saves somebody else \u2014 somebody I would have introduced as a new character into the movie. Because he\u2019s such an innately heroic character in my mind, he saves someone at the end of the movie and he willfully gets himself caught knowing that it\u2019ll save this other person. At the end of the movie, he\u2019d be locked in a jail cell somewhere in Montana or someplace. And he would be at peace with it. It was all this very interior, emo-type, very dramatic stuff.\n\nI pitched it to my girlfriend, Holly, and she said, \u201cAre you out of your mind? You can\u2019t have him in a jail cell at the end. You got to let him get away. People will riot.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, don\u2019t you get it? It\u2019s art. It\u2019s artistic.\u201d And then I said, \u201cNo offense, you\u2019re not a writer. I respect you, of course, and I love you. But you\u2019re not a writer.\u201d And then I went the next day and pitched it to Peter [Gould] and the writers of Better Call Saul, and they all looked at me in silence. They said, \u201cAre you crazy? He\u2019s got to get away at the end.\u201d [Laughs.] As the saying goes, if enough people tell you you\u2019re drunk, you need to sit down. So I dispensed with that idea.\n\nHad you worked out who this new character was going to be?\n\nI hadn\u2019t quite worked it out. To my credit, I was kicking this idea around, but I didn\u2019t get too far down the road with it. I didn\u2019t actually start writing it, but I had some pretty definitive ideas. I spent a couple of weeks on that. But I\u2019m glad I discarded it. Sometimes you succeed by giving people the opposite of what they want, but sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. Sometimes you just got to give folks what they want.\n\nWell, it was your gut instinct that Jesse gets away in the end.\n\nBut sometimes when you have enough time, you start to second-guess yourself. You think to yourself, \u201cWell, that\u2019s too simple. Getting away is what everybody expects, so maybe I got to go the opposite way.\u201d But then I thought if the road is difficult and complicated enough, and has twists and turns, hopefully it will be satisfying.\n\nJesse has just suffered so much. In the movie, we see even more of his suffering. So I, for one, am so glad he\u2019s in Alaska.\n\nGood! I\u2019m glad you\u2019re glad. Holly and Peter and the writers saved me. They saved me from somebody at the premiere chasing me up the aisle at the end of the movie trying to kill me. [Laughs.]\n\nI found Todd\u2019s role in the movie so interesting. We know him as this villain who shows up in the last season of the show, but he\u2019s crucial in Jesse getting away because Jesse needs his money. Can you talk about how you landed on making Todd such a key figure?\n\nThat didn\u2019t come immediately either. It\u2019s that old Edison quote about inventing, which holds for writing: \u201cIt\u2019s one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration.\u201d You just figuratively beat your head against the laptop until you get it.\n\nThe original idea was Uncle Jack riding shotgun, so to speak, with Jesse. Not literally a ghost, but a figment of Jesse\u2019s post-traumatic stress showing up and saying, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to get away, you\u2019re just stupid, you\u2019re too much of a rat.\u201d Or things like, \u201cThis 7-Eleven clerk just saw you, you better shoot him while you have the chance, you better kill him. It\u2019s kill or be killed.\u201d I love the actor Michael Bowen, who played Uncle Jack, and it\u2019d be great to have him back. But I kept thinking about it, and I thought, \u201cGod, what a bummer that would be. We\u2019re going to need every ounce of humor we can get because this is going to be a depressing, dramatic story.\u201d And then I thought: Todd. Except for being a crazy sociopathic murderer, he\u2019s a likable young man who\u2019s just got a screw loose. He can fake it, but he doesn\u2019t innately feel empathy for other people. You could be his housekeeper and he honestly likes you and he\u2019s nice to you, and yet God forbid you find his money hidden in his World Book encyclopedias, he\u2019s going to go, \u201cWell, that\u2019s it for you\u201d and he\u2019ll strangle you to death with his belt. And then he\u2019ll say, \u201cGee, I feel bad about that.\u201d Then in the next instant, he\u2019ll be thinking about something else. It\u2019s like killing a mosquito to him. But in the end, he\u2019s weirdly likable and it\u2019s the damnedest thing. And Jesse Plemons played the hell out of that part, so we went in that direction.\n\nTodd drives to the burial site singing \u201cSharing the Night Together.\u201d Please tell me how a song from the \u201970s even entered your mind and how the scene developed for you.\n\nI wanted a scene where you slowly reveal that the seat next to him is empty. And then you reveal poor Jesse in this swelteringly hot, tiny, cramped little truck bed in the back of this El Camino with this corpse wrapped up in a rug. That was the point of the whole scene. Todd was just driving down the highway staring into space, but then I thought, \u201cGod, wouldn\u2019t it be more disturbing if he\u2019s having just a great time?\u201d What do you do when you\u2019re driving by yourself and you\u2019re happy? You sing along to the radio. And then it was a matter of finding the right song. For a while, it was going to be a Donovan song that I like a lot. But \u201cSharing the Night Together\u201d by Dr. Hook came on the radio one day when I was writing and I said to myself, \u201c \u201cOh my God, that\u2019s it, that\u2019s perfect.\u201d\n\nWhat really makes the scene for me, that makes me laugh every single time, is when the truck passes and Todd makes the universal \u201chonk the horn\u201d sign and the guy doesn\u2019t honk the horn and he goes, \u201cOh well, whatever.\u201d That was completely Jesse Plemons. That was not scripted. When he did it, I was riding in this big giant truck that tows the car that Jesse is pretending to be driving. I\u2019m watching on a monitor, it\u2019s cold outside so you\u2019re bundled up, and I\u2019m huddled next to my director of photography and script supervisor. I say \u201cAction!\u201d and we start rolling and he starts singing. We were all laughing so hard. It\u2019s amazing it didn\u2019t get picked up on the audio track, even at 50 miles an hour with all the wind noise. When he does the horn honk, I almost fell out of the truck I was laughing so hard. He nailed it in one take. It was such a thing of beauty. And our camera operator, thank God, he can contain his laughter, because he operated it perfectly.\n\nWhere exactly was that scene filmed?\n\nA stunning, stunning place that every American should try to visit if they can \u2014 the Painted Desert of Arizona. Thankfully, the Navajo Nation let us shoot there. It\u2019s this absolutely gorgeous place. I\u2019m lucky enough to have gotten my helicopter pilot\u2019s license and I\u2019d been flying with my friend and instructor back and forth between California and Albuquerque a lot over the last few years. We would always follow the 40 freeway, but then we take a little detour north to fly over the Painted Desert because it is that gorgeous. Over the years [I thought], \u201cGod, this gets prettier every time I fly over it. I got to put this in a movie someday.\u201d And so luckily we were able to.\n\nThat drive leads to one of Aaron Paul\u2019s best moments in the movie, when he finds the gun in the car but he\u2019s unable to shoot Todd. What direction did you give him and Jesse Plemons in that scene?\n\nIsn\u2019t he amazing? This is why I love working with actors like Aaron and Jesse. It\u2019s not like I gave them any kind of brilliant direction. I try to put it all in the script in terms of, \u201cThis is what this character\u2019s feeling. This is what this other character, who is tormenting him, is not feeling.\u201d But then you just get out of their way. Take after take, when Todd says to Jesse, \u201cWhat kind of pizza do you like?\u201d and Jesse says \u201cPepperoni,\u201d the tear comes out of his left eye at the same moment. I am not kidding you. The damnedest thing I\u2019d ever seen. I asked him how he did it and he just shrugged, \u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s the job, I guess.\u201d God, is he good. Aaron is so good.\n\nThe pizza conversation is so uncomfortable. I wanted to yell, \u201cStop!\u201d\n\n[Laughs.] That was my favorite day. I\u2019ve been blessed in my career, but that was my favorite day being on a film set directing. Or maybe it\u2019s a close second. The final day of Breaking Bad, which was shooting a scene from the episode \u201cOzymandias,\u201d or this day in the Painted Desert were hands down my two favorite days.\n\nSome fans speculated that Walt was still be alive. Of course he wasn\u2019t! But the flashback with Walt and Jesse together made me wonder if you were deliberately trying to make him more sympathetic. Did you want to remind us who he was in the beginning?\n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t know that I was worried about how people perceive Walt. I just wanted people to see Walt again because there is no Breaking Bad without Walter White. I wanted to give a little gift to the fans. After all the big drama of the movie is over and Jesse prevails, I wanted to give the audience a little gift of seeing their two favorite characters together again. Really, that\u2019s what it all came down to.\n\nWhat were the different considerations for that reunion?\n\nI thought that I could show them in some moment from the past that was very dramatic and exciting. But then I thought, \u201cHell, that\u2019s what the whole rest of this movie was about! How about we show a little quiet moment way back in the day when they weren\u2019t at each other\u2019s throats on such an existential level? Go back to when they annoyed each other, but basically they had respect for one another.\u201d And that moment came in \u201c4 Days Out\u201d [from season two]. This is a little scene that we never intended back when we made the show, but I\u2019m sure someone out there will cut this scene into that episode on their home computers. It\u2019ll fit in quite nicely because we got the costumes right and everything.\n\nWalt\u2019s last words in the movie are interesting: He tells Jesse that he\u2019s lucky because he didn\u2019t have to wait his whole life to do something special. He was such a clear monster by the time the show ended, but I did feel for him when he said that in El Camino.\n\nHe has such grandiose ideas about himself as a human being, but at the end of the day, he\u2019s such a pathetic character. In a way, that makes me sad for him too. This guy is so brilliant. He came close to winning a Nobel Prize. By this point in his life, he is more proud of cooking crystal meth than anything else because he\u2019s the best in the world at it. It doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s something as terrible as crystal meth. He knows, in his heart, he\u2019s the best in the world at it. And it\u2019s good to be the best in the world at something. Anything. It is a moment where I feel for him, too.\n\nWere there any characters you wanted to bring back, but the actors weren\u2019t available?\n\nIt was never a question of actor availability, but I would have loved to figure out how to bring Skyler White back. And Marie and Hank and Walt Jr. and Gus Fring would have been great. Saul Goodman would have been great. But honestly, the movie would have felt overstuffed if we had put all those folks in. At the end of the day, it\u2019s very much Jesse Pinkman\u2019s story. We see it through Jesse Pinkman\u2019s eyes. The characters who were most important to Jesse are all in the movie \u2014 the only exception being Saul Goodman. But, having said that, I wouldn\u2019t have put him in the movie because I don\u2019t know where Peter Gould, who\u2019s now running Better Call Saul, wants to take that character. I would have been nervous about doing anything that would potentially mess up what Peter and the writers are planning for Better Call Saul.\n\nCan you tell us where Walt\u2019s family is now?\n\nI think they are living their lives as best they can. Their lives have definitely taken a turn for the worse. But hopefully, at least financially, the way we left it with Breaking Bad is that Gretchen and Elliot are going to give that money to Skyler and Walter Jr. Money-wise, they\u2019ll be in better shape. A big part of the show was that money is important in people\u2019s lives, there\u2019s no denying that, but God forbid it becomes the most important thing because then you miss out on what\u2019s really important. Which is family, love, self-respect, and all these other things that Walter White loses. That goes by the wayside in his myopic pursuit of not just enough money, but all the money. I think Skyler is a survivor and Walter Jr. is a survivor and Marie is too. And I think that little family unit prevails. It just may not be as dramatic as Jesse running around shooting evil welders. I think they\u2019re out there persevering.\n\nThe Wild West shootout was very Heisenberg of Jesse.\n\nI think Walter White would have been proud.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.", "description": "Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan reveals his original ending for El Camino, one that would have made the show\u2019s fans very sad or very mad.
