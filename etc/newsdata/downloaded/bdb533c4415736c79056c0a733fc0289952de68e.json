Times reports that the computers are able to assess the quake and then discern which areas may be affected, after which only users in that area will receive notifications.\n\nCalifornia's system will err on the side of caution when it comes to sending notifications, and will alert residents based on both whether the quake is dangerous as well as whether or not the level of shake will be frightening.\n\nOfficials say that the system works fast enough to deliver messages to residents before the earthquake goes to work.\n\nAn earthquake in July rocked rural parts of the state and created a scar that could be seen from space (pictured above)\n\nAlready, the alert system has had a chance to show off its worth with a tandem of quakes that hit California's Bay Area this week.\n\nThe quakes, a 4.5 and 4.7 magnitude, were picked up by the alert system at a median 2.1 seconds and 1.7 respectively as reported by NPR.\n\nCalifornia's introduction of a statewide systems comes several months after two unusually large quakes - including a 7.1 magnitude that rocked rural areas of the state.\n\nThere will likely be false alarms according to officials, though they say the benefits of having the system ready for real emergencies far outweighs the harm done by a scare.", "description": "Both of the new systems will leverage detection systems across the state that measure seismic activity so that they can help residents 'Drop, cover and hold on,' according to the Governor's office.", "authors": ["James Pero For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/19/15790384-0-image-a-14_1571336518513.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
