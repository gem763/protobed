REUTERS/Peter Cziborra\n\nWith the British and Irish Lions touring New Zealand, then-coach Stuart Lancaster had taken an experimental squad to South America. The uncapped May was overlooked for the first Test and then failed to make the cut again for the second.\n\nDisappointed and a little embarrassed, as he had invited his parents out to watch him play, he went for dinner with them the night before the final match.\n\n\u201cThen Christian Wade got called up for the Lions on the morning of the game,\u201d May told journalists on Wednesday, explaining how he had become the last winger standing.\n\nAll the other players not involved in the matchday had been out drinking. \u201cSo I got, \u2018go on you can play\u2019,\u201d May said.\n\n\u201cFunny how it works out - I ended up starting, so a challenging week finished on a good note,\u201d he said.\n\nEngland won the game handsomely and by the following year\u2019s Six Nations, May had forced his way onto the team, Lions included.\n\nHis first try did not arrive until his eighth match but he has now notched an impressive 25 going into what will be a proud and emotional day when he leads the team out in Oita on his 50th appearance - 49 of them as a starter.\n\n\u201cIf you take a step back, you\u2019d say it\u2019s an awesome achievement, something I\u2019m very proud of and that\u2019s hopefully made my family proud,\u201d May said.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s no time to take a step back at the moment, so I\u2019ll be just focusing on how I can contribute to the team performance.\u201d\n\n\u2018STUCK TO IT EVERY DAY\u2019\n\nMay\u2019s real points of difference are his pace and, according to his teammates and coaches, his relentless dedication to trying to improve his game.\n\nIn his early days, he was criticised for running too laterally, seeking gaps he would find at club level but less readily available in test matches. He has since eliminated this from his game.\n\nThere were also doubts whether he would ever regain his full speed after missing almost a year of action with a serious knee ligament injury. Instead, he came back just as fast, and much stronger. He has also developed into a brilliant and brave receiver of the high ball.\n\nMay is reluctant to accept that he works harder than anybody else on the squad, saying, \u201cI really do focus on making sure I do everything I possibly can every day, and that\u2019s been my mindset for a very long time.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m at the stage now where I\u2019m not working harder but working smarter, just to keep developing myself.\u201d\n\nLooking back at his six years as an England player, he said: \u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019ve cut a corner, I\u2019ve just stuck to it every day. I\u2019ve had injuries, been picked, and not picked. I\u2019ve had terrible games and good times, and that\u2019s how it\u2019s got to be, in terms of always striving to get better.\u201d", "description": "Jonny May will win his 50th cap when England play Australia in Saturday's quarter-final, but things might have turned out differently if he had not stayed sober on the last weekend of the team's tour of Argentina in 2013.", "authors": ["Mitch Phillips", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191016&t=2&i=1441415452&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9F0N1-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
