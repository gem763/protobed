However, they said that creating a specific tab focused on journalism \u201cgives people more control over the stories they see, and the ability to explore a wider range of their news interests, directly within the Facebook app.\u201d\n\nBrown and Sarantakos added that the News tab was developed in consultation with publishers, and also based on feedback from a survey of more than 100,000 Facebook users in the United States earlier this year.\n\nIt sounds like Facebook News will use both human editors and algorithms to determine which stories you see \u2014 an unusual move for a company that\u2019s been hesitant to police the content posted by users and advertisers. Specifically, there will be a section called Today\u2019s Stories, curated by a team of journalists to highlight the biggest national news stories of the day.\n\nAt the same time, Facebook will also provide algorithmic story suggestions based on your interests and activity. You\u2019ll be able to hide articles, topics and publishers that you don\u2019t want to see, and to browse sections devoted to business, entertainment, health, science and technology, and sports \u2014 topics where Facebook users apparently felt underserved.\n\n\u201cRegarding personalization, publishers worry that machine learning has limits and they\u2019re right,\u201d Brown and Sarantakos wrote. \u201cWe have progress to make before we can rely on technology alone to provide a quality news destination.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, they suggested that algorithms will be \u201cdriving the majority of Facebook News,\u201d and that they\u2019ll be working to ensure that those algorithms are also surfacing \u201cnew forms of journalism in the digital age, including individual, independent journalism.\u201d\n\nAlso included: a section where users who have linked their news subscriptions to their Facebook accounts can browse content from those subscriptions.\n\nWhich publishers will be included? Brown and Sarantakos said they must be part of Facebook\u2019s News Page Index, and also by abide by the company\u2019s Publisher Guidelines, which includes prohibitions against misinformation (as flagged by third-party fact checkers) and hate speech.\n\nFacebook did not provide a list of participating publishers, but screenshots of the News section include stories from The Wall Street Journal, Time, The Washington Post, BuzzFeed News, Bloomberg, Fox Business, Business Insider, NPR and others; spokespeople for The Post, BuzzFeed and the LA Times confirmed their participation.\n\nSo even if publishers have been burned by relying too much on the social network in the past, it sounds like they\u2019re not going to give up on working with Facebook.\n\nIt probably helps that the company is paying some of these publishers millions of dollars a year, according to Recode. (A Facebook spokesperson told me, \u201cTo ensure we\u2019re including a range of topic areas, we\u2019ll start by paying a subset of publishers who can provide a steady volume of fact-based and original content.\u201d)\n\nBuzzFeed News Editor-in-Chief Ben Smith told me via email that BuzzFeed is \u201cglad to participate\u201d and that \u201cFacebook is taking the lead in recognizing the value news provides to these platforms in a tangible way.\u201d\n\nAnd Hillary Manning, The Los Angeles Times\u2019 vice president of communications, said (also via email), \u201cWe anticipate that we\u2019ll reach new readers through Facebook News and, as we reach more readers, we expect to see more growth in our digital subscriber base.\u201d\n\nFacebook says News will be available to a limited group of users in the U.S., starting today.", "description": "Facebook\u2019s news section, which was\u00a0previously reported to be imminent, is here: The company is rolling out Facebook News in a limited test in the U.S. as a home screen tab and bookmark in the main Facebook app. In a blog post, Facebook\u2019s Campbell Brown (vice president of global news partnerships) and Mona Sarantakos (product manager, [\u2026]", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/facebook-newspaper-dollars.png?w=712", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
