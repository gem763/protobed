Launcher is the result, a dedicated section that aims to recalibrate the conversation with classically trained journalists who were raised on games. In so doing, we believe we can help bridge the gap between an audience unaware of the modern gaming landscape and those who inhabit it daily.\n\nToo often in our research we found articles on gaming issues that treated it as a curiosity. In those instances, it was clear those outlets merely adopted the topic of gaming. The staff at Launcher was born into it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWe are not, however, blinded by it. An industry that generates billions while marketing itself toward the world\u2019s youth requires monitoring. Launcher will hold accountable the leaders and companies that comprise the gaming industry. And, just like the rest of The Post, we have tools available for those who would like to confidentially share information on bad actors in this area.\n\nBut we also hope you\u2019ll find some fun at Launcher. Not many people fell in love with gaming while pondering its Dickensian aspects. And so we\u2019ll provide a steady stream of game reviews and tips. In many ways, gaming has replaced the weekly poker game or tennis match for younger generations. Even if the goal of those online gatherings is simply socializing, no one likes to lose. We\u2019ve pulled pointers from some of the gaming world\u2019s top professionals to help you win.\n\nThis is only the beginning. In the weeks and months ahead, we\u2019re hoping to add new elements to the site and bring our readers an accessible, savvy, well-sourced accounting of gaming\u2019s global environment. We want to build a community of intelligent readers and viewers who want to dive deep into their passion. We want you to ask us hard questions. We want to go find the answers.\n\nYou can join the conversation on Twitter, Instagram and the comment sections of Launcher. We look forward to hearing what you have to say.\n\nRead more from The Post:\n\nAD", "description": "The Post is getting into the gaming conversation.
