Entirely designed and manufactured in China, the Fuxing train is more spacious and energy-efficient, with longer service life and better reliability.", "description": "China has developed a permanent magnet traction motor for trains with speeds up to 400 kph, the developer said Tuesday", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
