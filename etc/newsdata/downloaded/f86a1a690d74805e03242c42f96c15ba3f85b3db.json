He confirmed that Labour would back an early election under any circumstances if Boris Johnson were to call one.\n\nWithin hours, the sounds of gears being thrown into reverse could be heard in Westminster. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, a lawyer who understands small print, realised there was a danger of the Labour Party walking into a trap designed by the prime minister.\n\nThen after Tuesday night\u2019s vote, when Johnson indicated he would call for an early election, Corbyn told him: \u201cGet the bill through first in order to take no-deal off the table.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

He will say that he intends to hold the election on 14 October, but the Act merely requires MPs to vote, by a two-thirds majority, for a motion saying: \u201cThere shall be an early general election.\u201d\n\nIf they vote for it, it is then up to the prime minister to advise the Queen on the date of the election. It would be extraordinary for Johnson to go back on his word in parliament, but there would be nothing to stop him naming a different date. He could, for example, ask Her Majesty to issue a proclamation for an election on 7 November.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

They said that most voters will not understand arguments about dates and procedure.\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He gave two reasons: one was the danger of the election date being set after 31 October; the other was that Labour would lose, making a no-deal Brexit more likely.\n\nIf the shadow cabinet did urge Labour MPs to vote against an early election on Wednesday night, Johnson would not have a two-thirds majority. He may then try to pass an act amending the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, setting the 14 October date in law, which would need a simple majority to pass.\n\nIf Labour MPs still refused to vote for it, they will be accused of being afraid of losing, because there would certainly be time to stop a no-deal Brexit after the election \u2013 if Corbyn won it. And the government might even win the vote with the help of the Scottish National Party, which thinks it can win back a lot of the seats it lost two years ago.\n\nMuch more high politics ahead.", "description": "\u201cOf course, we are the opposition party, we want a general election,\u201d Jeremy Corbyn said on Monday.
