So, just in case, here\u2019s what\u2019s going on\u2014and a list of all 42 apps you should remove from your phone, if you were suckered into installing one.\n\nAccording to ESET, these apps\u2014a subset of which had been active on the Google Play Store since July of 2018\u2014all appeared to be normal apps at first glance. Unlike previous adware-filled apps we\u2019ve reported on, the ones that try to trick you into thinking there\u2019s something wrong with your device, these apps all \u201cwork.\u201d\n\nI put that in quotes, because their main purpose isn\u2019t to help you track how much water you drink or allow you to make neat ringtones. These apps might have basic functionality, but they all start communicating back to a command-and-control server when you run them, which configures the apps\u2019 attack patterns to fit match your device (and other apps you have installed on it, like Facebook Messenger). Once they have their marching orders, the apps employ a number of creative techniques to stick themselves on your device and serve up annoying full-screen advertisements. As ESET describes:\n\nFirst, the malicious app tries to determine whether it is being tested by the Google Play security mechanism. For this purpose, the app receives from the C&C server the isGoogleIp flag, which indicates whether the IP address of the affected device falls within the range of known IP addresses for Google servers. If the server returns this flag as positive, the app will not trigger the adware payload. Second, the app can set a custom delay between displaying ads. The samples we have seen had their configuration set to delay displaying the first ad by 24 minutes after the device unlocks. This delay means that a typical testing procedure, which takes less than 10 minutes, will not detect any unwanted behaviour. Also, the longer the delay, the lower the risk of the user associating the unwanted ads with a particular app. Third, based on the server response, the app can also hide its icon and create a shortcut instead. If a typical user tries to get rid of the malicious app, chances are that only the shortcut ends up getting removed. The app then continues to run in the background without the user\u2019s knowledge. This stealth technique has been gaining popularity among adware-related threats distributed via Google Play.\n\nYuck.\n\nIf you have any of the following apps installed on your device, you\u2019ll want to hit up Settings > Apps & notifications > See all [#] apps, tap on the offending apps in question, and uninstall them from your device. (Depending on your Android device, your path to getting to this screen might vary.) Don\u2019t just uninstall the apps from your launcher by dragging them, as you might only remove a shortcut to said app (if you aren\u2019t paying attention).\n\nThankfully, while the aforementioned adware is annoying, it\u2019s unlikely to harm your device beyond wasting your battery and potentially sending data about you to something, or someone, you don\u2019t know anything about. These apps won\u2019t steal your passwords, but they will piss you off\u2014and for that, they don\u2019t deserve space on your phone. Google has also removed them from the Play Store, but that doesn\u2019t mean an automatic deletion from your phone.\n\nAs always, the best way to avoid apps like these is to first consider whether you truly need the app in question. Is there a better alternative? More importantly, is there an alternative that\u2019s already been downloaded by a ton of people, vetted by third-party sources, or has a long history of great reviews? Shoot for those apps instead of these weirdly named one-offs with suspect descriptions and reviews, and odds are good you\u2019ll avoid most adware on your device.", "description": "While I\u2019m willing to bet that you probably haven\u2019t downloaded any adware from the Google Play Store recently, a new report from ESET indicates that various Android users have downloaded 42 different adware-filled Android apps more than eight million times in total.
