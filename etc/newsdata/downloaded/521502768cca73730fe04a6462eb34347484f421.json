For Russia calls, I was the lead drafter of these materials, known as \u201ccall packages.\u201d But all of these talking points and briefing memos were approved \u2014 or as, we used to say, \u201ccleared\u201d \u2014 by staff at the NSC.\n\nJudging from the content of the Trump-Zelensky call, Trump was not reading talking points. No one on our team would have ever prepared a call package prompting Obama to ask for a personal favor that would help him win reelection. I also doubt that Trump\u2019s NSC staff would have written or cleared such a talking point for their boss.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTalking points for an Obama call with a Ukrainian leader after 2014 also would have denounced Russian annexation of Crimea and intervention in eastern Ukraine and stressed U.S. support for Ukrainian sovereignty and democracy. My guess is that Trump\u2019s NSC professional staff would have written similar talking points. Trump delivered none of these messages.\n\nSecond, before every call Obama had with foreign leaders, we conducted a \u201cpre-brief\u201d in the Oval Office. I considered these briefings to be one of the most important parts of my White House job. In these sessions, we discussed in detail the goals of the call \u2014 the U.S. national interests we were seeking to advance. Obama wanted concrete outcomes to be pursued in these conversations.\n\nTrump called Zelensky from his residence (at 9:03 a.m.), suggesting there was no pre-brief. I never briefed Obama in his residence.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThird, I listened to every call that Obama made with Putin, Medvedev and other foreign leaders related to my portfolio. I did so from the phone near the fireplace in the Oval Office, while Obama was on another line at his desk. For important calls, we had several senior NSC officials listening from the Oval.\n\nTrump made the call with Zelensky from his residence, presumably without any NSC staffers present, making it easier for him to make his blatantly personal and political request of the Ukrainian president. That favor would have been harder to propose with national security staff in the room.\n\nFourth, on substance, there is nothing unusual about quid pro quos in presidential calls. Diplomacy often is about asking your counterpart to do something for your country in return for something you can deliver. We often dangled a meeting with the president \u2014 especially a \u201cbilat\u201d in the Oval Office \u2014 as an inducement to get leaders to act favorably or cooperate with us. We might also offer economic assistance, weapons sales or presidential visits in order to obtain desired actions from other leaders. That\u2019s normal diplomacy.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSo, it was not unusual for Trump to use his leverage to request that Zelensky do something for him in their call. What was radically different and wrong was the nature of Trump\u2019s favor \u2014 a request to help uncover dirt on his electoral opponent.\n\nFifth, after a transcription of a call was produced by the White House Situation Room, our bosses then decided who needed to see a copy of the memorandum (usually a select group of Cabinet officials). If you were tasked with doing something in the call \u2014 as Attorney General William P. Barr was in the Trump-Zelensky call \u2014 you most certainly saw the memorandum or heard personally from the White House chief of staff or national security adviser.\n\nTrump (or his aides) did something extraordinary by imposing such a high level of classification on the Zelensky call, thereby denying access for even Cabinet members and most White House staff. Our calls were classified as \u201cSecret.\u201d I don\u2019t ever remember a call being classified as \u201cTop Secret,\u201d let alone using the even higher, compartmentalized classification deployed by the Trump NSC.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nI also would \u201cread out\u201d these calls verbally to members of the Interagency Policy Committee (IPC) on Russia that I chaired. IPC members included senior officials from all the major departments working on Russia policy, including State, Defense, the CIA, Treasury, and the office of the director of national intelligence. The officials needed these \u201cread-outs\u201d to make sure their activities were consistent with the presidential policies and preferences.\n\nThis practice appears to have been retired during the Trump era. Instead, Trump deployed someone outside the government \u2014 his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani \u2014 to conduct diplomacy with the Ukrainian government while others inside his own administration were kept in the dark. That never happened in the Obama era \u2014 and it should never happen again in any administration.\n\nRead more:\n\nMax Boot: The rough transcript is devastating.
