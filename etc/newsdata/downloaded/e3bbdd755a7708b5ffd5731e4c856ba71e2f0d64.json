It does nothing but spread fear and hate. Why not publish articles of common grounds between the two sates? Why not publish articles of hope, cooperation, forgiveness, tolerance and acceptance? Both states have tons of work to do to catch up to the rest of the world and pull their people out of poverty and despair. Why not publish articles of what a strong and stable indo-pak relation could offer to its people and the world instead of forecasting billions of deaths caused by nuclear war? For a change news media should try to play a positive role in defusing the tension and attempt to bring people together, wouldn't that be better for the world?", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png"}
