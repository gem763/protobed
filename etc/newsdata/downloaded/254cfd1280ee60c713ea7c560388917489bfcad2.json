So the Upside is here to help\u2026\n\nWhat\u2019s the funniest piece you read this week? Can\u2019t remember?\n\nThere may be a reason for that.\n\nThese are such serious times that it\u2019s getting harder to find the humour. Once upon a time, newspapers crackled with jokes, mixing up the serious stuff with light-hearted whimsy, satire and irreverence.\n\nThese days, not so much. Aside from occasional oddities and political sketches, our news media seems less attuned than ever to the the bizarre, the comedic, the absurdities of modern life. Things are so serious that comedians are becoming politicians.\n\nWhy? Have we lost our funny bone? When did everyone start taking themselves so seriously?\n\nSaturday marks the 50th anniversary of the first episode of Monty Python\u2019s Flying Circus. In honour, the Upside has been trawling around, looking for the new Ernest Scribblers of this very earnest age.\n\nYou can read our suggestions in What we liked, below. But first, a quick round-up of top Upside offerings of the week:\n\n1. The women taking the plastic out of periods. Two-minute read.\n\n2. Why Finland\u2019s schools are so great. Three-minute read.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A class act in Finland. Photograph: Miikka Pirinen/Kuva: Miikka Pirinen\n\n3. How the participatory budget in Paris works. Three-minute read.\n\n4. Hitching to work: could it catch on? One-hour commute.\n\nWhat we liked\n\nMy colleague Marina Hyde is always funny \u2013 though be warned: she is fabulously rude too.\n\nA jolly Sydney Morning Herald piece ripped into a new TV hit.\n\nThere was plenty of value to be had in a British prime minister mentioning \u201ckangaroo\u2019s testicles\u201d in a speech.\n\nA pub had a party at which everyone was called Nigel.\n\nThe Economist had fun examining the far-fetched prospect of Donald Trump\u2019s border moat. One-minute read (paywall).\n\nThe New Yorker still maintains a daily commitment to satire.\n\nA protest stunt backfired \u2013 literally (video).\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A bloody mess at the Extinction Rebellion protests. Photograph: Tomm Morton/Extinction Rebellion\n\nLucky numbers\n\nLong one of the most alcoholic nations in the world, Russia has become more abstemious over the past decade and a half, with booze consumption falling by almost half. Longevity has increased by 10% over the period from 65 to about 71.\n\nIn the UK meanwhile, deaths from breast cancer have almost halved over the past 30 years.\n\nWhat we heard\n\nMich\u00e8le Sanniti inquired via email:\n\nI would love to read an article on what can be done about the huge amount of plastic that we generate everyday by using milk and orange juice cartons. Alternatives, campaigns, are the supermarkets working on this?\n\nWell, of course we have written various pieces on this, for example here, here and here.\n\nStill on the theme of all that unnecessary plastic:\n\nThanks for a great article about environmentally sound menstruation products. I have been using the same 6 pads since 2002 or thereabouts. They are in cotton, and I just wash them in the washing machine and then use them again. They have little buttons on their wings to keep them tethered during use. Probably not great for the manufacturer, but multi-use pads is probably by far the most environmentally friendly menstrual protection.\n\nName supplied\n\nWhere was the Upside?\n\nOut in the Pacific, where a new technology finally looked like it might work\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The floating device retains debris from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.
