We have a barrage, a complete and utter attack on this man\u2019s very will and conscience and psyche by an individual to the tune of 47,000 messages,\u201d she said.\n\nBoston College said on the day of Urtula\u2019s death that he was a biology major and was working as a researcher in a New York hospital with plans to attend his graduation that day.\n\n\u201cAlexander was a gifted student who was involved in many activities while at BC, including the Philippine Society of Boston College,\u201d said interim vice president of Student Affairs, Joy Moore, in a letter to the school\u2019s community.\n\nRollins said You, a former student at the school, is currently in South Korea, and they have been in contact with those representing her and are hoping she will return to the states voluntarily, but if she does not, they will utilize the powers they have to get her back on U.S. soil to face the charges.\n\n\u201cWe are fully fluent in the ways to get her back if she doesn\u2019t want to do it voluntarily,\u201d Rollins said.", "description": "Oct. 28 (UPI) \u2014 Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins announced involuntary manslaughter charges against a South Korean national on", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
