Picture: Msindisi Fengu\n\nThey gossiped on WhatsApp about which pupils were having sex with whom, speculated about whose parents were HIV positive, and labelled schoolmates \u201cugly\u201d, \u201cgay\u201d and \u201ctoo black\u201d.\n\nThe cyberbullying in the \u201cReal Goboza\u201d chat group at Thuto-Lesedi Senior Secondary School in Vosloorus, Gauteng, had got out of hand.\n\nAll teachers could do was console the slandered \u2013 many of whom were very poor pupils \u2013 and encourage them to study hard and change their circumstances.\n\nBut all this changed thanks to an intervention by the Columba Leadership youth programme, which trained 12 pupils to manage conflict and tackle the scourge.\n\nNow the school, which has about 2 000 pupils, has been bully free for more than a year.\n\nThe gossip group begun when two pupils, a boy and a girl, named schoolgirls they suspected had babies with boyfriends, outed victims of rape, and made snide remarks about poor classmates who shared bedrooms with their parents and wore the same clothes every day.\n\nNothing was off limits.\n\n\u201cI was told that I\u2019m not beautiful. I was told I was a monkey. I cried the whole night and I thought of killing myself,\u201d one pupil told City Press this week.\n\nTensions came to a head one Friday afternoon, when a group of pupils went to the home of a schoolmate they accused of creating the group.\n\nThey stood outside her house demanding she come out and threw stones on the roof.\n\nThe girl\u2019s mother emerged and threw a kettle full of boiling water at them.\n\nSix values of leadership\n\nThe school tackled bullying by sending 12 Grade 10 and 11 pupils to a weeklong programme run by Colomba Leadership, during the July holidays last year.\n\nGroup leader Katleho Matheba (16) said they were taught to build their courage and self-confidence and six values of leadership: awareness, focus, integrity, perseverance, creativity and service.\n\nThey were asked to identify the school\u2019s worst problems and come up with solutions. The biggest problem they noted was bullying.\n\nGroup secretary Lebohang Thuse (16) said they were told that, as leaders, they needed to bring change to society and start with smaller things before moving the rocks.\n\n\u201cSo, we started with the littering problem and then dealt with the bigger challenge.\u201d\n\nBack at school, they organised silent protests during breaks in which they taped their mouths shut and sat on chairs with placards denouncing all forms of bullying.\n\nThe boys formed a circle around the girls, tied together with rope, to send a message that their role was to protect girls.\n\n\u201cI really regret doing it\"\n\nMatheba said they set up discussion groups to allow pupils to share experiences and seek solutions together.\n\nOne boy, who admitted he was one of the bullies who contributed to the Real Goboza chat group, said the interventions taught him that bullying was \u201cnot a cool thing\u201d.\n\n\u201cI really regret doing it. I feel sorry that I offended others and I\u2019ve learnt that I should not do what I would not want others to do to me,\u201d he said.\n\nEconomics teacher Xolisile Ntuli said the bullies\u2019 victims confided in them.\n\n\u201cWe could only console and motivate them to focus on their studies. Those that were attacked because of their poor background were motivated to work hard so that they could change the situation in their homes,\u201d she said.\n\nSchool principal Madoda Madi said it was a nightmare to manage close to 2 000 pupils at the school affected by the group. He tried to involve teachers to help.\n\n\u201cWe involved the school governing body. It was an opportunity for us to educate pupils to be careful when using social media platforms,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe chose not to use punitive measures such as expelling pupils. We approached this using corrective measures through education.\u201d\n\nAnd it has worked.\n\n\u201cSince we had the silent protest and sent out the message on Real Goboza, we no longer have bullying in our school,\u201d Matheba said.\n\nColumba Leadership chief executive Tracy Hackland said they worked with the department of basic education to offer a values-based leadership programme.\n\nIt is intended to inspire young people to \u201clead change in their own lives, schools and communities\u201d.\n\nShe said they were helping schools talk to their pupils and change the culture.\n\n\u201cThis sees principals, teachers and pupils working in partnership to bring change in their schools and communities after they complete the Columba Leadership academy,\u201d Hackland said.\n\nWith increased confidence, sense of purpose, resilience and grit, pupils often became less vulnerable to peer pressure and bullying.\n\nHOW WE DID IT\n\nHere is some advice from pupils at Thuto-Lesedi Senior Secondary School on how to tackle bullying:\n\n- Have boxes where victims of bullying can anonymously disclose what has happened to them. Some may be too ashamed to talk in public;\n\n- Set up support groups where participants are assured of confidentiality;\n\n- Involve pupils in leadership programmes aimed at ridding the school of bullying and other negative behaviour; and\n\n- Seek support from schools that have been successful in dealing with the scourge and from organisations doing this work.\n\nTALK TO US\n\nIs there bullying in your child\u2019s school and what is being done to stop it?\n\nSMS us on 35697 using the keyword BULLY and tell us what you think.
