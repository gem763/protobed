A joint statement on the agreement states that offensive cyber measures are being used by malicious actors to \u201ctarget critical infrastructure and our citizens, undermine democracies and international institutions and organizations, and undercut fair competition in our global economy by stealing ideas when they cannot create them.\u201d\n\nThis long overdue document attempts to outline what is acceptable \u2014 and what is not \u2014 in cyberspace, as well as mentioning that there will be consequences for behavior deemed unacceptable. However, specifics regarding what these repercussions might look like are absent.\n\nRussia and China, who are frequently accused of \u201cbad behavior\u201d \u2014 like influencing political elections and stealing valuable intellectual property \u2014 did not sign the agreement.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHopefully this agreement serves as a much-needed wakeup call. Cyber warfare is already here, and a few organizations have unfortunately suffered the crippling consequences.\n\nWhile these attacks are happening on a small scale, they could quickly rise to a widespread problem if a nation-state so chooses. Just as individuals often fail to consider the consequences of their behavior online, nation-states \u2014 including the U.S. \u2014 are operating in cyberspace without any serious deliberation regarding potential outcomes.\n\nEscalating maneuvers between adversaries is part of a growing trend of state-backed offensive cyber operations. Joint Chiefs chairman nominee Gen. Mark Milley emphasized this point when addressing the Senate Armed Services Committee, saying, \u201cgood offense is critical, and that is the best defense.\u201d However, these once seldom-deployed strategies need to be de-escalated before it\u2019s too late, because the possible catastrophic outcomes of a retaliation are not being considered.\n\nOffensive efforts are designed to demonstrate a strong presence on the global stage, showing adversaries that there are consequences for unfavorable geopolitical decisions. It is a warning shot that the offensive government is capable of exploiting other countries\u2019 systems.\n\nBut cyber attacks take place in a lawless battlefield. With cyber warfare, the rules of the road are less defined. Further, there is a lack of appreciation for the power of offensive cyber tools and their ability to have cataclysmic ramifications.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe current state of offensive cyber operations across the globe continues to escalate to new and dangerous points every day as attacks become more sophisticated and as nations race to keep pace with their peers. Unrestricted, governments will continue building their cyber arsenals and increasing the severity of their attacks \u2014 igniting a cyber-arms race akin to the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nFor the U.S., going on the offensive might deter some attacks, but the outcome of these operations could have unintended consequences. For example, hacking into a power plant in Russia so it can be shut off if conflict arises between the two countries may appear to be an effective deterrent, but deployment may cause collateral damage and impact blameless civilians. Further, infiltrating another country\u2019s critical infrastructure would go against the newly signed agreement, or worse, prompt our adversaries to infiltrate our critical infrastructure.\n\nAlternatively, what happens when Russia responds? Are U.S. organizations \u2014 private entities \u2014 caught in the crossfire and losing their valuable data because of their government\u2019s actions? The U.S. needs to consider the potential blowback from their offensive decisions in cyberspace, something they currently are failing to do.\n\nAttacks against companies or individuals often target sensitive data for monetary gain, but offensive cyber measures by nation-states are designed for disruption, damage and sometimes destruction. Retaliation could target civilian systems, sending a strong message with a significant impact, and put the attacking nation at risk of facing penalties for their actions based on the new agreement. These tactics also increase the risks of offline retaliation using military weapons.\n\nTests of strength during the Cold War era hinged on the development of weapons of mass destruction. But today, countries like North Korea and Iran can conduct offensive cyber operations with few obstacles \u2014 and sanctions have done little to stop them. The ideal response to an offensive cyber attack must mitigate the risk of escalation. What this looks like has yet to be determined \u2014 but it should underpin any strategic countermeasures adopted by the U.S. in cyberwarfare.\n\nArms control agreements between nuclear superpowers have helped stymie escalation. However, monitoring something physical, like nuclear weapons or even the materials required to make them, is much simpler than knowing what cyber weapons a nation possesses, recognizing who is responsible for the attack, or confirming that additional offensive cyber capabilities are not being developed.\n\nThe Cuban Missile Crisis thankfully ended without any nuclear weapons being launched, and a global disaster was avoided. However, at any moment we could face a nation-wide cyber attack with unprecedented \u2014 and many unintended \u2014 consequences.\n\nAnthony J.
