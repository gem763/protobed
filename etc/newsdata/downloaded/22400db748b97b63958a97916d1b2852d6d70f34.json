I think we should have a resurgence. Let\u2019s get the Terms of Endearment back out there. You know, Heaven Can Wait, Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles, Goodbye Girl.\u2019\n\nScorsese isn\u2019t the biggest fan of Marvel (Picture: Getty; Rex)\n\nWe mean, what was there to not get cosy about when it came to Avengers: Endgame? That thing was three hours long \u2013 if you couldn\u2019t melt into your cinema seat during that then we\u2019re not sure what will get you munching the popcorn at an Imax.\n\nIt comes after Gangs Of New York director Scorsese had some interesting words to say about the MCU franchise.\n\nThe Taxi Driver director told Empire: \u2018I tried, you know? But that\u2019s not cinema.\n\n\u2018Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn\u2019t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.\u2019\n\nRobert shared his thoughts (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nThis week Robert Downey Jr said that Scorsese\u2019s comments \u2018made no sense\u2019, before getting in a dig about Marvel\u2019s \u2018phenomenal\u2019 success.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Iron Man star brought up the director while chatting to Howard Stern, saying: \u2018I didn\u2019t expect [the MCU] to become what it became and it is this very large multi-headed hydra at this point. I\u2019ve always had other interests. And according to Scorsese, it\u2019s \u201cnot cinema\u201d. I gotta take a look at that.\u2019\n\nStern asked RDJ why Scorsese, 74, said such a thing, with the 54-year-old diplomatically replying: \u2018Because it\u2019s his opinion.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nWhen asked \u2018But it is cinema isn\u2019t it?\u2019, Downey Jr said: \u2018Well, it plays in theatres. I appreciate his opinion because I think it\u2019s like anything, we need all the different perspectives so we can come to centre and move on.\u2019\n\nStern continued: \u2018But were you insulted when he said it\u2019s not cinema?\u2019\n\nThe Tony Stark actor said: \u2018Well, look, it\u2019d be like saying \u201cHoward Stern isn\u2019t radio\u201d, it makes no sense to say it\u2019 \u2013 but brushed off suggestions Scorsese is jealous of Marvel\u2019s success at the global box office.\n\nHe said: \u2018Of course not. But I mean, he\u2019s Martin Scorsese. In his view \u2014 and by the way, there\u2019s a lot to be said for how these genre movies, and I was happy to be part of the problem if there is one, denigrated the art form of cinema.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018When you come in like a stomping beast and you eliminate the competition in such a demonstrative way, it\u2019s phenomenal.\u2019\n\nRDJ\u2019s comments on Scorsese\u2019s claims come after Samuel L Jackson \u2013 aka Nick Fury \u2013 gave his two cents on the matter.\n\nHe told Variety: \u2018That\u2019s kind of like saying Bugs Bunny ain\u2019t funny. Films are films. You know, everybody doesn\u2019t like his stuff either. I mean, we happen to, but everybody doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u2018There are a lot of Italian-Americans that don\u2019t think he should be making films about them like that. Everybody\u2019s got an opinion, so it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s not going to stop anyone from making movies.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
