The judge said it was not needed in this case, and \u201cwould tend to subvert the liability of an auditor for loss or damage in negligence\".\n\nAccusations of poor auditing\n\nThe lawsuit alleges EY, as auditor of the LM First Mortgage Income Fund, had flawed oversight of valuations and compliance plans for the fund. The fund failed in 2013 after raising almost $400 million from investors.\n\nThe fund\u2019s receiver, BDO\u2019s David Whyte, is bringing the case on behalf of unit holders in the fund.\n\nIt claims auditors did not take reasonable care in its oversight and failed to adequately consider the economic consequences of the global financial crisis and the fund\u2019s high exposure to property development loans.\n\nThey were further accused of failing to take reasonable care in determining whether valuations for properties used to secure loans were \u201cup-to-date and relevant\u201d.\n\nAuditor Paula McLuskie, a 26-year EY veteran, is named in the allegations, as is Michael Reid, who allegedly oversaw the fund\u2019s compliance plans at EY. Ms McLuskie and Mr Reid also audited investment manager Blue Sky before it crashed.\n\nEY declined a request from The Australian Financial Review to comment on the allegations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJustice Jackson said EY might be able to offset unpaid audit fees it is owed by LMIM against any damages ordered by the court, but noted these fees may not be payable should EY\u2019s audits prove defective as LMIM alleges.\n\nLMIM owes EY almost $160,000 in unpaid audit fees. EY's audits of LMIM from 2008 were worth about $1.97 million.\n\nBid to keep audit documents private\n\nEY\u2019s auditors are trying to rely on a legal protection against self-incrimination to resist a court order to hand over audit documents associated with the case.\n\nThis is becoming a popular strategy with big four firms in legal hot water over audits, with Deloitte and PwC also having cases afoot where they have claimed the privilege against self-incrimination.\n\nEY\u2019s auditors are trying to rely on a legal protection against self-incrimination to resist a court order to hand over audit documents.\n\nDeloitte successfully argued that the privilege applied to some audit partners in a class action over its audit of collapsed construction company Hastie, only to be told by the Federal Court that other partners at the firm had to hand over the documents in question.\n\nAn appeal by Deloitte to see the protection extended over the entire partnership is awaiting a full Federal Court judgment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPwC made the same case in a class action regarding its audits of failed education provider Vocation, claiming all its partners qualified for the privilege. Justice John Middleton last week vacated the Hastie trial dates, pending the outcome of Deloitte\u2019s full court decision.\n\nThe privilege traditionally did not cover corporate documents, said McCullough Robertson law firm partner Scarlet Reid, as it applied only to individuals at risk of criminal prosecution arising from any requested evidence.\n\nEY argued there was a real risk that any adverse civil ruling in the LMIM case could flow on to a penalty or criminal action against Ms McLuskie, even having an EY partner submit evidence that ASIC\u2019s \"why not litigate\" stance gives credit to these fears.\n\nEY\u2019s submissions also said there was a risk some contraventions of the Corporations Act against any auditor could be attributed to the whole firm, meaning any registered auditor within EY was at risk of prosecution.", "description": "EY has lost the latest round in its legal battle with a collapsed financial services firm, with a judge labelling its case flawed and unsustainable.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.9598%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1718%2C$y_644/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a758cd54f0e049a4c56d1a3b42581d4a5cd4f152", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
