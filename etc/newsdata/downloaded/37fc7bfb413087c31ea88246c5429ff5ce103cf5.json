But some nostalgic gamers demand the most authentic retro experience, and for them Analogue is releasing a new digital-to-analogue converter allowing its modern consoles to connect to the outdated CRT TVs that most of us were happy to see die.\n\nDuring our testing of Analogue\u2019s Mega Sg and Super Nt we were impressed with the bevy of video options that not only helped classic games look great on a modern flatscreen TV with resolutions of HD and above, but also the settings that helped emulate how games looked back when TVs weighed as much as a teenager: but it wasn\u2019t quite perfect.\n\nThe way cathode ray tube TVs worked is fundamentally different to how LCD and OLED flatscreens do, and all the video settings tweaks in the world aren\u2019t going to accurately recreate the behaviour and appearance of all those tiny glowing phosphor dots inside a CRT.\n\nThe only way to perfectly recreate the retro CRT gaming experience is with a genuine CRT TV. They\u2019re still relatively easy to find on eBay or in your parents\u2019 basement. Those TVs pre-date the modern convenience of HDMI cables, however, which is where the Analogue DAC enters the picture. You feed it a signal from one of Analogue\u2019s video game consoles via an HDMI cable and power from a USB cable, and it will spit out high-quality analogue video and audio signals for your CRT or professional video monitor.\n\nAnalogue\u2019s DAC is a BYOBOC affair. (Bring your own breakout cable.) (Photo: Analogue)\n\nThe Analogue DAC is available now for around $120, but that price doesn\u2019t include all the cables you\u2019ll need. The converter only offers left and right RCA-style audio outputs, and a single HD-15 connector. To connect it to a CRT\u2019s component, S-video, or composite video inputs you\u2019ll also need to hunt down an HD-15 breakout cable \u2014 but that\u2019s more of a hassle than another big cost as they can be found online for as cheap as just $5.\n\nIf you\u2019re shaking your head wondering who would pay $120 to recreate the grainy, blurry gaming experience of the \u201880s and \u201890s (especially since original Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis consoles can also be easily found on eBay and connect just fine to an old CRT) then Analogue\u2019s DAC isn\u2019t for you.\n\nIt\u2019s for the retro gaming obsessives who want to ensure they\u2019re maximising the quality of their gaming experience and the authenticity. That being said, there is one other excellent reason to consider Analogue\u2019s DAC and digging up an old CRT: it finally lets classic light gun accessories like the SNES\u2019 Super Scope 6 or the Lethal Enforcers blaster work again, as neither are compatible with modern flatscreens.", "description": "If there\u2019s one good reason to drop $300 on Analogue\u2019s Mega Sg or Super Nt consoles, it\u2019s that they allow you to play your favourite retro 16-bit games on a modern TV that only supports HDMI.
