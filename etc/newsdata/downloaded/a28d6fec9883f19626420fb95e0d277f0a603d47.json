The PM is facing intense scrutiny about their relationship\n\nHe said: 'The Prime Minister is unfit for office. This morning has thrown up even more questions for Boris Johnson, which can only be answered with a full investigation into the apparent misuse of public funds.'\n\nMs Arcuri, the then-mayor's 'technology advisor', has been at the centre of a storm over her relationship with the Prime Minister, with accusations of impropriety over the thousands of pounds of public money her company received when he was mayor of London.\n\nBut today she repeatedly refused to answer questions about whether they shared an intimate relationship when Mr Johnson was married to his then wife, Marina Wheeler.\n\nShe told Piers: 'Because the Press have made me this objectified ex-model pole dancer, I'm really not going to answer that question.\n\n'I am not going to be putting myself in a position for you to weaponise my answer. Boris had nothing to do with my other achievements.'\n\nMs Arcuri, who was speaking exclusively to Good Morning Britain, said Mr Johnson had never showed her 'any favouritism' and denied newspaper reports he wrote her a letter of recommendation for a \u00a3100,000-a-year tech job.\n\nMs Arcuri repeatedly refused to answer questions about whether she had an affair with Mr Johnson, telling Piers: 'Would I ask you about your sex life?'\n\nBut pressed by a television interviewer about Ms Arcuri today trhe PM (pictured) would only say: 'I've really said all I want to say about that'\n\nMs Arcuri said she and Mr Johnson, who she saved on her phone as 'Alex the Great', bonded over their 'mutual love of classic literature'.\n\nThe entrepreneur said Mr Johnson had visited her flat a 'handful' of times, adding that she did not have time for the media attention surrounding him when they met in public.\n\nShe added: 'We tried having drinks out in public or having lunch, it just became too much of a mob show, so I said 'you just have to come to my office'.'\n\nMs Arcuri said that her office was in her Shoreditch flat, which also featured a pole-dancing pole.\n\nHow PM asked friend to 'show me a few things on your pole' Jennifer Arcuri today revealed how Prime Minister Boris Johnson asked her to 'show him a few things' on the pole in her London flat.

Ms Arcuri said the Prime Minister 'asked me to show him a few things' on the pole she had in her London home. Describing the kit as a 'conversation starter', she said she and Mr Johnson 'always had a laugh about it'. She added: 'The pole stood in the living room, yes, he saw the pole.' Asked directly whether Mr Johnson had ever used the pole, Ms Arcuri said: 'I'm never going to tell you that.'\n\nShe said the Prime Minister had been there 'five, ten, a handful of times' and described him as 'a really good friend', adding: 'It's really not anyone's business what private life we had.'\n\nMs Arcuri also said the Prime Minister 'asked me to show him a few things' on the pole she had in her flat.\n\nDescribing it as a 'conversation starter,' she said she and Mr Johnson 'always had a laugh about it'.\n\n'The pole stood in the living room, yes, he saw the pole.'\n\nWhen asked directly whether Mr Johnson had ever used the pole, Ms Arcuri said: 'I'm never going to tell you that.'\n\nThe former model was reportedly given \u00a3126,000 in public money and privileged access to three foreign trade missions led by Mr Johnson while he was in City Hall.\n\nLast month, the Prime Minister was referred to the police complaints body to assess whether he should face a criminal investigation over his association with her.\n\nThe Sunday Times has reported that the businesswoman confided to four friends that they had been engaged in an affair during his time as mayor.\n\nBut Ms Arcuri told GMB: 'Those people are not my friends.'\n\nMs Arcuri winked at the camera as she had her make-up done before her exclusive interview with GMB\n\nOn October 2, Ms Arcuri broke her cover and was pictured outside a beauty salon, run by her friend, near her home in Los Angeles\n\nMr Johnson insisted last week that everything he did when promoting London overseas as mayor was done in 'complete conformity with the code and the rules'.\n\nOver the weekend, the Sunday Times also reported that Mr Johnson wrote a letter recommending Ms Arcuri for a job as the head of a technology quango when he was in City Hall.\n\nLeaked emails seen by the Sunday Times suggested Mr Johnson was listed as a reference in her application for the role at Tech City.\n\nMs Arcuri was said to have been a 27-year-old student at the time of applying for the \u00a3100,000 a year job.\n\nIn recent days, Downing Street has also been forced to deny claims that Mr Johnson squeezed the thigh of a female journalist under the table during a private lunch.\n\nCharlotte Edwardes said the incident took place at the offices of The Spectator in London shortly after Mr Johnson became the magazine's editor in 1999.\n\nMs Arcuri was pictured Boris Johnson on his mayoral campaign in 2012 when her firm ran large sums of public money\n\nThe pole-dancing American tech entrepreneur was previously photographed draped in a Union Jack in 2013\n\nEarlier this week Ms Arcuri broke her cover and was pictured outside a beauty salon, run by her friend, near her home in Los Angeles.\n\nWearing heavy make-up and a wide-brimmed black hat, she rubbished allegations Mr Johnson had bent the rules to help her \u2013 calling it 'an orchestrated attack'.\n\nSpeaking to the Mail 11 days after the scandal emerged, she insisted: 'I'm being used as collateral. All the allegations are false.'\n\nAs she sat next to her friend Jeannie Lorin, who runs the Beauty Society salon, Ms Arcuri added: 'It's such a shame to see successful businesswomen, or just businesswomen in general, be persecuted.'\n\nShe added: 'One of the things I've been surprised with is how much support there has been for me, despite these allegations, because women see through these attacks and they know the narrative.'\n\nFriends said she had been lying low with extended family elsewhere in the US while deciding how to respond to the clamour.\n\nThere are four inquiries into whether father-of-five Mr Johnson broke rules by doing favours for Ms Arcuri and her tech firms.\n\nMs Arcuri moved to California last year with British partner Matthew Hickey and their young daughter.\n\nMr Johnson could be forced to hand over text messages and emails he sent to Miss Arcuri or face prison\n\nMr Johnson could be forced to hand over text messages and emails he sent to the businesswoman or face prison.\n\nIf the leader fails to respond to the summons, he could be handed a sentence of up to three months in prison.\n\nLast month, Mr Johnson was referred to the police complaints body to assess whether he should face a criminal investigation over his association with the businesswoman.\n\nIn an earlier interview to The Mirror last week, Ms Arcuri furiously denied claims that she had a sexual relationship with Mr Johnson and branded rumours 'complete b*******'.\n\nShe added: 'They fall in love with me in about ten minutes\u2026 because I know what to say. I make men trip over their d****'.\n\nWhen asked if Boris Johnson had contacted her since the scandal emerged she said: 'No. Can you blame him?'", "description": "Mr Johnson twice refused to speak about American Jennifer Arcuri, hours after she gave her first live television interview - refusing six times to deny that they had an affair.", "authors": ["David Wilcock", "Whitehall Correspondent", "Rory Tingle For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/12/19393680-0-image-a-12_1570449140933.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
