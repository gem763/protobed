Stuckless questioned why Weinstein \u2014 the disgraced movie mogul who will soon face trial on five criminal counts, including rape and predatory sexual assault \u2014 was welcomed.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s going to say anything? Nobody\u2019s really going to say anything?\u201d she said, according to video taken at the event. \u201cI\u2019m going to stand four feet from a f\u2014ing rapist and nobody\u2019s going to say anything?\u201d\n\nAnother woman who performed at the event, comedian Kelly Bachman, told TheWrap she was booed for calling out Weinstein during her comedy set. Amber Rollo, another comedian who attended the event, said a friend of Weinstein\u2019s called her a c\u2014 when she objected to his presence.\n\nThe location of the event had been kept under wraps until the last minute, but Actor\u2019s Hour had rented out Downtime Bar for the private event with its own guest list, according to a statement from the establishment sent to the Patch. (Downtime Bar did not respond to a request for comment from The Wrap.)\n\n\u201cShortly into the evening, one guest began heckling another, causing a disturbance to everyone in attendance,\u201d the statement read. \u201cAfter several requests to stop were ignored, we kindly asked the heckler to leave.\u201d\n\nThe statement continued: \u201cWe respect the privacy of our patrons and event partners, and want to ensure that all guests are treated equally, with the same service and respect.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Rose McGowan Accuses Harvey Weinstein and His Ex-Lawyers of Racketeering in New Lawsuit\n\nWeinstein has denied ever engaging in non-consensual sex. His spokesperson told TheWrap: \u201cHarvey Weinstein was out with friends enjoying the music and trying to find some solace in his life that has been turned upside down. This scene was uncalled for, downright rude and an example of how due process today is being squashed by the public, trying to take it away in the courtroom too.\u201d\n\nIn addition, Weinstein said in a statement that he is \u201chappy to address anyone\u2019s questions. We should all be offered the courtesy to voice opinions and be heard, and to even get answers. I am glad we all still have these rights.\u201d\n\nThe spokesperson did not respond to a question about whether Weinstein had been invited to the event. Alexandra Laliberte, who runs Actor\u2019s Hour, also did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nStuckless also did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but in a public Facebook post on Wednesday, she wrote, \u201cI was sitting there, and the more that I sat there waiting for the event organizers to kick him out, or for another performer to call him out, or for the audience to revolt, the more I found myself paralyzed by the silence. He was sitting there, allowed to laugh and clap and drink and flirt and no one was saying anything. The more I sat there the more furious I was at all of our inaction.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn some ways tonight was a horrible, painful reminder of the power a man like Weinstein holds even now. It was a reminder that even in this time of relative awareness it is hypnotically easy to be pulled into a culture of silence,\u201d she continued. \u201cHowever, it was also a reminder that our voices have so much more power when we stand together.\u201d\n\nActor Michael Torello, who was present Wednesday and at an Actor\u2019s Hour event weeks ago, said he saw Weinstein at both events. He said a comedian also called out Weinstein at the earlier event.\n\n\u201c[The comedian] immediately says, \u2018Bro, is that Harvey Weinstein out there? Is it true that he raped those women?'\u201d Torello told TheWrap. \u201cAt first, when he said the name, Harvey Weinstein, everyone was laughing. But then when he said, \u2018Is it true that he did those things?\u2019 then the room just died completely. And I looked over, and he didn\u2019t look too happy to say the least.\u201d\n\nBachman, the comedian who performed on Wednesday evening, told TheWrap she was shocked to see Weinstein in attendance, and more shocked that he was allowed to stay \u2014 especially since she was a survivor of sexual assault. (She is not one of Weinstein\u2019s accusers.) She said she knew she had to say something about Weinstein\u2019s presence.\n\nStory continues", "description": "A confrontation between Harvey Weinstein and a woman who objected to his presence at a Wednesday event for actors ended with the woman \u2014 not Weinstein \u2014 being ejected.Actress and playwright Zoe Stuckless was one of a small number of women who called out Weinstein for attending the speakeasy-style event", "authors": ["J.
