Yomari consists of an external cover of rice flour and an inner content of sweets known as chaku and the mild-based khuwa. They sell for about 65 Nepali rupees or 60 US cents per dumpling. The yomari were traditionally prepared as a specialty dish by members of the ethnic Newari community in Nepal for their festival, but demand became so great that they are now sold throughout the year.

Amid Manila's dense population, ambulant food vendors earn a good profit selling rice porridge mixed with meat, chicken feet, pork intestines, eggs on sticks, and beef stew with rice. Price ranges from 20 cents euro to 50 cents euro EPA 6/20 Cambodia Men cook snail soup at the Omega street food restaurant in Koh Pich (Diamond Island) in Phnom Penh. The snail soup is made with lake snails, caught by hand by farmers in the provinces around Phnom Penh. The dish offers customers a traditional provincial style of food compared to the majority of restaurants in Cambodia that offer Chinese, western or neighboring Asian nations cuisine, only a few offer traditional Cambodian fare. The restaurant specialises in cooking snail soup and steamed frog with small rocks EPA 7/20 Myanmar A woman puts a betel package, called quid, into her mouth made and sold at a street stall in Naypyitaw. Betel quids, known as Kunya, are very popular in Myanmar, made of tobacco and small pieces of betel nut wrapped in a betel leaf and spread with a lime paste that are placed into the mouth to suck and chew. Betel is the seed of the Areca palm, and while it's consumption is common in Asia and the Pacific, it is banned in many western countries due to its negative health effects.

Since the so-called ' fish ball revolution' riot in Mong Kok in 2016, where a crowd of New Year revellers tried to push a cart of boiling oil towards health officials who were checking for unlicensed street hawkers, the snack has also become a symbol of identity of the Hong Kong people's resistance to perceived creeping authoritarianism from China. Traditionally, fish balls were made of local fish species once widely available in Hong Kong waters. However, due to over-fishing and the industrialisation of food production, the iconic snack is now said to contain only 20 per cent fish or less, with substitute ingredients such as flour, chemical enhancers, pork and lard sometimes making up the bulk of the product. Despite this, in 2012, local media Apple Daily reported that 375,000,000 fish balls were consumed per day EPA 11/20 Thailand A vendor arranges fried insects on her street food cart on Khao San Road in Bangkok. The road houses many kinds of food but the most popular are fresh fruits, fried insects and pad thai. Fried insects attract the attention of tourists from all over the world.

Hawker centres were started in the 1970s in Singapore by moving street vendors into purpose-built facilities. There are over 110 such hawker centres in the country.
