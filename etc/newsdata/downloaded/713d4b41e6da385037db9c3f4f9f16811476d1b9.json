Boeing said it's also updated crew manuals and pilot training to \"ensure every pilot has all of the information they need to fly the 737 MAX safely.\"\n\n\"These software changes will prevent the flight control conditions that occurred in this accident from ever happening again,\" Boeing said.\n\nThe 737 Max has been grounded since March by virtually all major countries in the world. Boeing has been working with regulators at home in the United States and abroad to regain certification for the plane. Airlines with the planes in their fleets have been hit to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars as the plane remains out of service.\n\nFriday's final report also noted flaws in Lion Air's handling of the plane, including noting that 31 pages from the plane's maintenance logs for October 2018 \u2014 the month of the fatal crash \u2014 were missing. It is not publicly known what happened to those pages.\n\nEarlier this week, internal text messages sent by a senior Boeing test pilot were reported by The New York Times. Those \"egregious\" messages were sent \"some months ago,\" according to Reuters, which first reported on the messages. However, Boeing did not turn them over to the Federal Aviation Administration until October.\n\nThe FAA told Reuters that it found the messages \"concerning\" and that it was \"reviewing this information to determine what action is appropriate.\"\n\nShares of Boeing, which reported disappointing third-quarter earnings this week as it remains embroiled in controversy, remain down more than 20% since the plane was first grounded.\n\nDavid Slotnick contributed to this report.\n\nNow read:", "description": "Investigators released their final report Friday on the crash.The system is also suspected to be a factor in a second crash five months later.", "authors": ["Graham Rapier", "Sin\u00e9ad Baker"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db2f14ddee0197a043c7605?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
