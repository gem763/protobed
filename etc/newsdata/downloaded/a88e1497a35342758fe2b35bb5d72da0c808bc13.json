A Republican candidate for President hasn\u2019t won the state since 2004, when George W. Bush beat John Kerry there by a margin of just 5,988 votes. Trump himself lost the state by eight points to Hillary Clinton in 2016 and his disapproval rating among registered voters there is a crushing 57%, according to the Morning Consult voter tracking poll.\n\nNonetheless, Trump\u2019s campaign is betting it can win in New Mexico. Flush with cash, the campaign is planning to announce a state director and additional ground staff there in the coming weeks, a campaign official tells TIME. Internal campaign data has convinced Trump\u2019s political advisors they can energize a slice of the state\u2019s Hispanic voters to vote for Trump in 2020 by emphasizing Trump\u2019s handling of the economy, border security and his trade confrontation with China. According to U.S. Census data, 49.1 percent of New Mexico\u2019s residents identify themselves as Hispanic or Latino.\n\nThe move is part of a series of bets Trump is making to win states that went for Clinton in 2016. Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior White House advisor Jared Kushner says that voter data has convinced the reelection effort to fund robust field operations in a much larger number of states than in 2016. \u201cI can see us very aggressively playing in 18 swing states,\u201d Jared Kushner tells TIME, adding that in his view, the 2016 Trump campaign \u201cseriously played\u201d in about 11 swing states.\n\nThe broader bets, made very early in the election cycle, signify some defining characteristics of Trump\u2019s 2020 effort. To win, Trump probably needs to come up with a different set of states than those that garnered 304 electoral college votes and carried him to the White House: public polls show his disapproval ratings swamp his approval numbers by at least 9 percentage points in his 2016 blue-to-red trifecta of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.\n\nBut Trump is flush with funds. With more than $100 million in cash on hand, Trump\u2019s campaign has the freedom to look for unorthodox opportunities to seek out electoral votes in other parts of the country. That massive money haul will be used to mobilize support in states Trump lost narrowly, and in some cases broadly, and where his campaign feels there are enough untapped Trump supporters to tip the balance in his favor, his campaign says. \u201cWhat matters is having the resources to invest in the best people and data to give the candidate every advantage,\u201d Kushner says.\n\nTrump\u2019s political strategists say they aren\u2019t carving out a new path to 270 electoral votes and instead want to run up the score. In the 2016 race, the Trump campaign didn\u2019t have the luxury of time or a huge war chest. \u201cLast time we had a better air game than ground game,\u201d Kushner says. \u201cThis time, we\u2019ve had a couple of years to prepare. We\u2019ve refined our data and political operation. We\u2019ve invested $50 to $60 million over the last couple of years to make the data significantly better.\u201d\n\nNot everyone is buying it. Trump\u2019s sagging job approval ratings suggest to many political observers that the map-broadening is a reflection of a search for a long shot way back to the White House. Liam Donovan, a Republican strategist, says that the Trump campaign is right to be trying to get more voters to show up and to branch out into new territory. \u201cThere are reasons to compete in all these places,\u201d Donovan tells TIME. But, Donovan says, \u201che\u2019s not going to win any of these places if he\u2019s still at 43 approval in the RCP average,\u201d referring the average of Trump job approval polls published by RealClearPolitics.\n\nIt\u2019s a strategy that veteran political consultants warn may end up being a waste of money, but if the political landscape shifts in Trump\u2019s favor next year and the Trump campaign has people on the ground to capitalize on it, it might pay off.\n\nTo do it, the Trump campaign is targeting states that have high rates of support for Trump among Republicans. The bet is that they can ramp up turnout and swamp the votes in traditional Democratic strongholds. That strategy hinges on developing accurate data to find would-be Trump voters and using the months-long head start over a still-unknown Democratic opponent to build a ground operation that ensures those voters are registered and get to the polls. It also plays to Trump\u2019s strength for whipping up controversies that energize his supporters.", "description": "The Trump campaign is betting that it can ramp up turnout and swamp the votes in traditional Democratic strongholds", "authors": ["Brian Bennett"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bmgaXtWrgMNd08FWMRH_Hw--~B/aD02ODM7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/time_72/393807ea23d7fe88e9b71547a9e52a3e", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
