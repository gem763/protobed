Erdo\u011fan would have to take care of ISIS and manage international condemnation, trouble from Capitol Hill, and the quagmire with the Kurds. And when Trump put it in such stark terms to Erdo\u011fan, the Turkish leader would demur. Until last Sunday, that is, when he told Trump he was moving ahead with the invasion of northern Syria.\n\nThis time, Erdo\u011fan called Trump's bluff, having waited for international forces to wipe out the ISIS caliphate.\n\nErdo\u011fan's decision \u2014 which the White House cleared the way for in its Sunday night announcement, alienating and blindsiding key allies including Republican lawmakers and the Christian right \u2014 has plunged the Middle East and Trump's political standing in Washington into crisis.\n\nSources in Turkey have indicated that while Erdo\u011fan was talking big, he thought Trump would restrain him, a U.S. official familiar with the details told Axios' Margaret Talev.\n\nFor example, Erdo\u011fan did not expect \u2014 or want \u2014 a 30-km-deep (18-mile) buffer; that was assumed to be a negotiation aimed at getting something smaller.\n\nNow Erdo\u011fan may be in over his head and facing global condemnation and sanctions, but he got so far extended politically inside Turkey that he has had little choice but to go forward, the official said.\n\nBehind the scenes: In phone calls and in-person meetings dating back to 2017, Trump has been effectively calling Erdo\u011fan's bluff, according to sources who have been in the room with the two leaders and had access to their phone calls.\n\nOn one 2017 phone call, Erdo\u011fan was complaining to Trump about the Kurdish threat on his border and told Trump he wanted to move in to take care of the Kurdish threat, per a source with direct knowledge of the call.\n\nThe source paraphrased their recollection of what Trump said on the call: \"It was pretty blustery. Trump was like, 'I don't want to be there in the first place, but you know our guys are there. They don't take s--t. We're there. Maybe I don't want to be there, but if you do a border crossing and come into conflict with our guys, they are way better equipped and you don't want to do that.'\" Trump's message, the source said, was \"don't mess with the U.S. military.\"\n\nBut after conveying that threat, Trump signaled he wasn't going to keep his troops in Syria for long and was not going to be hanging around to protect the Kurds against the Turks, the source added. Trump said something to the effect of, \"But you know I don't want to be there. We're there to defeat ISIS. My people tell me we are winning. ... So hang tight. But you don't want to get into a conflict with my guys,\" the source recalled.\n\nAnother former senior administration official, who was with Erdo\u011fan and Trump when Erdo\u011fan visited the White House in 2017, said Trump called the Turkish leader's bluff then, too.", "description": "Smart, efficient news worthy of your time, attention, and trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
