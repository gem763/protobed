Some actors even isolate themselves: Daniel Day-Lewis reportedly didn't break character for three whole months. He later went on to bag the best actor award at the Oscars.\n\nTwitter\n\nAnd given the latest reports, it seems Robert Pattinson is not too far behind either. According to his co-star he \"beat himself up\" on the sets his upcoming film The Lighthouse in order to get in to character.\n\nYes. His co-star Willem Dafoe shared this interesting fact in a recent interview. He said, \"He's not interested in craft, I think. He wants to throw himself into deep water and he feels like it will only be true if he's drowning.\"\n\nTwitter\n\nDon't Miss 190 SHARES 41.1 K SHARES 10 K SHARES 8.2 K SHARES 6.9 K SHARES\n\n\"For me, that seemed wacky. But I'm not trying to judge. He has a good sense of the visual, of what's needed in a close-up. Sometimes he'd beat himself up so bad.
