Superior Court judge on Thursday blocked the District from moving forward on a controversial no-bid contract with a Greek gaming company to manage the city\u2019s planned foray into online sports betting.\n\nA lawsuit filed by Dylan Carragher, a D.C. resident and the founder of a sports betting technology business, argued that the $215 million contract with Intralot violates federal law because District officials awarded it without competitive bidding.\n\nEarlier this year, the D.C. Council narrowly voted to suspend competitive bidding rules and allow Intralot, which already held the contract to operate the D.C. Lottery, to continue running the lottery and manage online sports gambling and related services as well.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that by suspending competitive bidding rules for the contract, District officials violated the Home Rule Act, which established local government in the capital.\n\nThe D.C. Lottery falls under the purview of the District\u2019s chief financial officer. The lawsuit says that under the Home Rule Act, the CFO\u2019s office must follow D.C. procurement laws, which call for competitive bidding. According to the lawsuit, the D.C. Council was not entitled to exempt the chief financial officer from the Home Rule Act.\n\nIn her ruling, Judge Joan Zeldon said there was a \u201csubstantial likelihood\u201d that Carragher would succeed in demonstrating that the city had violated the federal law.\n\nCarragher\u2019s lawyer, Donald Temple, said he was \u201cprayerfully surprised\u201d by the judge\u2019s order, which he called \u201cmonumental.\u201d Handing Intralot the city\u2019s mobile application for sports betting without seeking competitive bids was illegal, he said.\n\n\u201cNow the real question is, if it\u2019s illegal, whether the city is going to continue to defend that which is illegal, or are they going to reconcile the illegality of their actions,\u201d he said.\n\nA spokeswoman for D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine (D) said his office was reviewing the judge\u2019s order and would have no comment on the pending litigation.\n\nD.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D) said he thinks the city will ultimately prevail.\n\n\u201cMy understanding is that the essence of the judge\u2019s action was to buy time for the parties to brief this and for the court to figure this out,\u201d he said. \u201cThe argument by the plaintiff focuses on an arcane reading of the Home Rule Act, and it\u2019s an incorrect reading.\u201d\n\nA spokeswoman for the D.C. Lottery, Nicole Jordan, said in an email that the judge\u2019s order will delay the modernization of lottery operations at retailers across the District.\n\n\u201cThe major impact of the judge\u2019s ruling will be on the small local businesses that intend to participate and profit from sports wagering,\u201d as well as \u201con the January 2020 start date for the Lottery\u2019s citywide mobile wagering app,\u201d Jordon said.\n\nIn his legal challenge, Carragher said his business was not afforded an opportunity to compete for the contract. He also said, as a taxpayer, he was harmed by the District\u2019s decision to circumvent competitive bidding because it eliminated the possibility of securing a better deal for taxpayers.\n\nTemple represented a D.C. contracting officer in a whistleblower lawsuit over his firing and the award of the city\u2019s lottery contract a decade ago. The former contracting officer, Eric W. Payne, said he was terminated for refusing to yield to pressure to cancel a contract won by Intralot and a local partner.\n\nThe contract ultimately was rebid and awarded to Intralot. A federal jury found that Payne was wrongfully fired for objecting to the contract. In 2017, officials reached a $3.53 million settlement with him.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the Payne lawsuit, according to Temple\u2019s latest suit, city officials decided \u201cto circumvent the competitive contract procurement process altogether.\u201d\n\nThe restraining order is good for two weeks; the court has ordered the parties to appear Oct. 1 for a hearing on Carragher\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction.\n\nBefore the contract was awarded to Intralot, some council members said they were concerned about suspending competitive bidding rules and about some subcontractors\u2019 ties to local politicians.\n\nSeveral council members said they had additional questions about the legality of the contract after an investigation by The Washington Post last month found that Intralot is subcontracting work to its own subsidiary. A local law requires companies with large public contracts to share some of that work with small local firms as a way to strengthen the local economy and grow jobs.\n\nThe Post investigation found that the business Intralot has listed as its main subcontractor, Veterans Services Corp., had no employees, and that its website touted executives who didn\u2019t work there. The small firm\u2019s chief executive is an employee of Intralot\u2019s subsidiary, DC09, and lives in Maryland.\n\nCouncil member Elissa Silverman (I-At Large), who has been outspoken in her opposition to the no-bid contract, said the court\u2019s order on Thursday validates her position.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said all along that this contract stinks. It continues to stink, and now the court\u2019s saying it stinks as well,\u201d she said. \u201cWe made a decision that we were going to have sports betting in our city, but we need to do it with a contracting process that is fair and upright and that the public has confidence in.\u201d\n\nWhile the judge\u2019s order halts progress on the sports betting mobile application, it does not impact in-person betting allowed under the new law at stadiums, arenas and other large venues, the D.C. Lottery said.\n\nRead more:\n\nSports gambling will earn D.C. nearly $16 million less than projected, officials say\n\nThe little firm that got a big chunk of D.C.\u2019s lottery and sports gambling contract has no employees\n\nD.C.
