All support Obama and Crooked Hillary. Witch Hunt!\" he said.\n\nThe crisis, which began last month with media reports revealing the original whistleblower's complaint, has quickly metastasised across the Trump administration, ensnaring senior officials such as Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who came under further scrutiny over the weekend.\n\nTrump largely stayed out of public view, spending Saturday at his golf club in Sterling, Virginia, and Sunday at the White House. In tweets, he attacked Democrats and some Republican detractors, including Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, whose ouster he demanded pn Saturday after Romney criticised him.\n\nHe also appeared to directly link the 2020 presidential race to his efforts to push Ukraine to investigate Biden, contrary to a tweet on Friday declaring that \"this has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens\".\n\n\"And by the way, I would LOVE running against 1 [per cent] Joe Biden - I just don't think it's going to happen,\" Trump tweeted on Sunday, arguing that Biden and his family were \"PAID OFF, pure and simple!\".\n\n\"Sleepy Joe won't get to the starting gate, & based on all of the money he & his family probably 'extorted,' Joe should hang it up,\" Trump added. \"I wouldn't want him dealing with China & [Ukraine]!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBiden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates responded by calling it \"puzzling\" that Trump would claim to love the prospect of a match-up against Biden, \"seeing as how he just sent his administration into a tailspin by trying to bully a foreign country into spreading a comprehensively debunked conspiracy theory about the vice president\".\n\nBiden's son Hunter served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine's largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.\n\nAs vice-president, Joe Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, whom Biden and other Western officials, including Republicans, accused of not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and US officials.\n\nWashington Post", "description": "An attorney for the whistleblower who sounded the alarm about President Donald Trump's pressure on Ukraine said  that 'multiple' whistleblowers had come forward.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2724%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_68/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f51b6d97692617e4ba2f440c088097a20db5d2dd", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
