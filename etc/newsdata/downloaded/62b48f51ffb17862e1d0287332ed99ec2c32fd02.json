Factories shed 2,000 jobs in September.\n\nLoading...\n\nDon't see the graphic above?

Private sector employers added 114,000 jobs during the month.\n\nWhile government agencies added a total of 22,000 jobs, only 1,000 were temporary census workers.\n\nRetailers continued to cut jobs, losing more than 11,000 in September.\n\n\"Amid this narrative that the weakness is concentrated specifically in the manufacturing sector, it's now clearly spread to other parts of the economy,\" said senior economist Tim Quinlan of Wells Fargo Securities.\n\nFactories are especially sensitive to global forces, including the trade war. But mounting tariffs have also taken a toll on consumers' confidence.\n\n\"To the extent that they start scaling back their outlays, not just on goods that are impacted by the tariffs but also any of their other service-related spending, that's now having a knock-on effect in the broader services economy,\" Quinlan said.\n\nAverage hourly wages over the last year have increased by 2.9%. That's down from 3.2% in the 12 months ending in August.\n\n\"We're not seeing as much movement in wages as we'd want,\" said Becky Frankiewicz, president of the temporary services firm ManpowerGroup North America. \"Given supply and demand, we'd expect to see more.\"\n\nLoading...\n\nDon't see the graphic above?

And forecasters say growth in the just-ended third quarter may have been even lower. Monthly job gains over the last three months have averaged 157,000, compared to an average of 189,000 jobs in the same period a year ago.\n\nThe labor force participation rate held steady in September at 63.2%.\n\nQuinlan is not projecting a recession, but he does expect growth to slow to an annual pace of just 1.5% over the next few quarters \u2014 barely above stall speed.\n\n\"It certainly feels like we're getting closer to that razor's edge,\" he said. \"I get the sense a lot of financial market participants are just waiting for that next shoe to drop.\"", "description": "U.S. employers added 136,000 jobs in September \u2014 a sign of continued resilience in the labor market amid growing signals that the economy is losing steam.
