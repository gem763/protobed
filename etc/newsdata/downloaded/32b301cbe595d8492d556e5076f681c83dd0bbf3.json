I also had a wrist injury.\u201d.\n\nThose concerns did not stop Koepka from a magnificent season in the majors. He won the PGA Championship, was runner-up at the Masters and U.S. Open, and fourth at the British Open.\n\nMakes one wonder what he can do in 2020 if he can put in some time on the range.\n\n\u201cLast year I didn\u2019t practise at all,\u201d said the American. \u201cI finally feel good enough where I can actually practise and feel prepared coming into golf tournaments. I\u2019ll be practising this year.\u201d\n\nKoepka, an especially dangerous competitor when he has a chip on his shoulder, was controversially beaten for PGA Tour Player of the Year in a vote by his peers.\n\nNever mind his major record, Koepka was bested by season-long FedEx Cup winner Rory McIlroy. The tour did not reveal the vote totals.\n\nKoepka shrugged off the snub, making a comparison with the NBA\u2019s dominant player of the past decade.\n\n\u201cLeBron (James) has only won four MVPs (most valuable player awards) and I\u2019m pretty sure he\u2019s been the best player for more than just four years,\u201d Koepka said.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t play for awards. I just play to win, win trophies, win tournaments.\u201d\n\nWhile Koepka left some money on the table on Thursday, Canadian Taylor struck with six birdies, as well as an eagle at the short par-four 14th, where his 315-yard tee shot stopped five feet from the cup.\n\nTaylor led by two strokes from a trio including veteran Phil Mickelson with half the field back in the clubhouse.", "description": "Brooks Koepka is healthy again but his game was ailing as he shot a mediocre one-under-par 70 in his first start of the new PGA Tour season at the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open in Las Vegas on Thursday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436812888&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF921VJ-OCASP"}
