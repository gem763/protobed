On tonight\u2019s Succession, we finally met the mysterious Pierce family. Are they chaotic good? Or just chaotic neutral, which in itself feels just a little nefarious? They are certainly East Coast royalty \u2014 a few generations back they probably went boating with a Hepburn or boozed with a robber baron.\n\nIt\u2019s curious to see the Roy family putting on a face: Logan is the mad director, fuming at his children, all disappointing in their own ways. \u201cLike Romans among you Greeks,\u201d he says when the families chatter at a cocktail hour, \u201cI\u2019m sure you find us rather big, vulgar, and boisterous.\u201d If only! The subsequent display is, instead, drunk, snide, and humiliating \u2014 but all families are weird and unhappy in their own way, right? Here\u2019s who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down after dinner at the Pierce compound and the PGM acquisition.\n\nLogan Roy\n\nWe\u2019ve seen Logan struggle a lot \u2014 he\u2019s locked in, I don\u2019t know, a half-dozen power battles this season \u2014 but never have we seen Logan performing in this way. In front of the Pierces, he\u2019s putting on his best and brightest face, only to look even more like a brute. He\u2019s raised a family of barn animals, and in front of the Pierces it\u2019s like he\u2019s seeing them all with new eyes: Roman laughs too loud and doesn\u2019t take anything seriously, Kendall has relapsed, Shiv is impossibly stubborn, Connor is a fool. There\u2019s even a troubling discord in his marriage. (Before it just felt like Marcia was overplaying her hand; now it feels like she doesn\u2019t much care.)\n\nBut! Logan wins! And it\u2019s not even a melodramatic, \u201che\u2019s won, but at what cost?\u201d kind of win. Somehow, through the table-slamming and grinning and a moment that seemed to suck all the oxygen out of the room, he\u2019s managed to give the blue bloods what they want the most: more money. And in return he\u2019s a step closer to keeping his empire. I\u2019m absolutely in love with the way the camera follows him up his penthouse\u2019s stairs, up to his tower: He\u2019s alone, but who cares? Everyone\u2019s worn out and depressed, but they\u2019re still jockeying to be his favorite.\n\nNan Pierce\n\nMaybe it\u2019s that I watched Erin Brockovich too many times when I was a preteen, or maybe it is just my t\u00e2st\u00e9, but: Cherry Jones is the only woman with a bob allowed to talk down to me! There is something a little snide, a little snobby about Nan Pierce. She seems to be permanently wearing a white button-down, which I admire, and she has a kind of put-upon folksiness that is incredibly patronizing. Look at the way she asks her niece to recite a Shakespeare passage and says, \u201cSoup\u2019s on, people.\u201d I don\u2019t trust it, but I do appreciate that when she decides to sell, it\u2019s on her terms, which happen to be the same as mine: Finally my daughter, Shiv, is on the throne!\n\nThat one Pierce cousin who took out her phone to Google whatever book Roman lied about reading\n\nIn a word: demonic. In two more words: totally twisted. Is there anything more absolutely savage than taking out your phone to fact-check someone sitting right in front of you?\n\nCousin Greg \u2026 ory\n\nWhen Cousin Greg \u2026 ory \u2026 arrives at the Roy penthouse, it\u2019s like he\u2019s stepping into a battleground as soldiers nurse their wounds. But he\u2019s chipper as ever here! Please remember that he is the only character who\u2019s gotten a new apartment and a new job this season, and Logan seems genuinely tickled by his presence. Cousin Greg will outlast us all.\n\nNaomi Pierce\n\nNaomi is in recovery, like Kendall, but unlike Kendall, she\u2019s not the family\u2019s go-to fuck-up. She\u2019s close to Nan \u2014 and not because she accidentally did a Chappaquiddick \u2014 and just that proximity to power bumps her higher than nearly any other Pierce. Naomi is a wild card who doesn\u2019t seem to really care about who buys what or when or how, she just has (a very valid!) score to settle. Even though someone like Rhea might wield more power, Naomi has the Pierce last name.\n\nRhea Jarrell\n\nThere\u2019s something extremely slippery about Rhea. No one can ever pin her down or get a real answer out of her. Holly Hunter is extraordinary (and I mean this with all due respect: extraordinarily irritating) during the dinner scene, as she moves between hot topics. Rhea is so vexing because she\u2019s playing all sides, all the time, and also purring into Nan Pierce\u2019s ear. She\u2019s still in a primo position, at the right hand of the master. More Rhea!\n\nConnor Roy\n\nOf all of Logan\u2019s demented children, was Connor the only one who understood the assignment? He was asked to win over weirdo Ben Franklin\u2013lookalike Maxim Pierce, and by the end of the episode, what did he do? He won over weirdo Ben Franklin\u2013lookalike Maxim Pierce. Congratulations Connor, your reward is not your father\u2019s love and respect, but it is a gnarly hangover and that nice quilted vest!\n\nGerri Killman\n\nGerri breaks even here, I think. She\u2019s still in the game, still doing this flirty-dirty talk thing with Roman, still the on-paper successor. The Gerri-Roman, er, romance was at first funny to me, but now I think I\u2019m warming to it. \u201cGerri and Roman\u2019s banter has always been a vaguely nauseating swirl of mommy issues and semi-ironic flirtation,\u201d Lindsay Zoladz wrote for The Ringer. \u201cBut as their characters have deepened, something odd has happened: They have come to seem like two of the only characters in the bankrupt moral universe of Succession who genuinely care about each other.\u201d I\u2019ve started to agree, if only because they seem like two of the only characters who have consistently genuine interactions. Everyone else on this show is either hiding or lying or scheming, or all of the above at once; Gerri advises Roman and they sorta fuck. Who am I to deny this!\n\n\u201cPenis cat\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know this cat\u2019s name and I don\u2019t want to know this cat\u2019s name. I have not been so utterly freaked out by an animal since that one Pomeranian ate the other Pomeranian in Superman Returns, a movie that I definitely saw twice in theaters for absolutely no reason at all.\n\nShiv Roy\n\nPhoto: YouTube\n\nI didn\u2019t think it could get worse than Roman trying to, to borrow a phrase, \u201corder the Pierce family\u2019s legacy over the phone like an UberEats.\u201d I thought Logan looking at his son and calling him a moron was the most pitiful moment. LMAO. I was skeptical of Logan\u2019s offer from the beginning \u2014 if his mouth is moving, he\u2019s lying! \u2014 and now Shiv has her clown makeup permanently applied! Of course she\u2019s getting impatient playing the long game, and of course she\u2019s headed toward a rupture: Logan has been Katy Perry-ing her. He\u2019s Hot N Cold! In some moments he sees her as the successor, in other moments he\u2019s asking her to play up the liberal woman thing, or whatever the hell he said to her before they left for the Pierce estate. Blurting out that she\u2019s the next CEO is one thing, but the way Logan looks at her at the end of the episode, just before he climbs the stairs to his tower \u2014 I\u2019ll tell you what that look is not: an apology. It\u2019s more of a \u201cmaybe next time, kid.\u201d What will Shiv do next??\n\nTabitha\n\nIt is entirely possible that Tabitha is the smartest person in that whole house \u2014 nay, the whole show! The Roys like her, the Pierces love her, she\u2019s tall and snarky and also has things like \u201ca big meeting on Monday.\u201d If ever a character was going to get their own spinoff, I would want to see Tabitha after she dumps Roman: Tabitha on Raya, Tabitha kickboxing, Tabitha smiling slyly at brunch when the friend no one really likes starts telling a big long story no one wants to hear. She\u2019s a better sparring partner than Shiv\u2019s partner or Connor\u2019s partner, and yet she gets DUST!\n\nRoman Roy\n\nFor the first time maybe ever, Roman is placed in front of someone he has to impress, and oh boy is he unprepared. He\u2019s no match for any of the Pierces, and certainly comes out with a net loss: he\u2019s teased for not fucking Tabitha, he\u2019s exposed for not reading, and he\u2019s still not fully back in Logan\u2019s good graces. \u201cWhen you laugh,\u201d Logan tells him, \u201cplease do it at the same volume as everyone else. We didn\u2019t get you from a hyena farm.\u201d If I could marry any line in HBO history, in might be that one. It would be a classic affair at City Hall, and I would wear a dress without a label, like Carrie Bradshaw. Registry information forthcoming.\n\nMaxim Pierce\n\nListen, I love this Benjamin Franklin\u2013looking weirdo! In my experience with rich families, quite a few of them have a \u201chippie type,\u201d someone who almost never acts like they have real money, but probably doesn\u2019t shower and reads off-the-wall books. Maxim seems like that guy!\n\nKendall asking Naomi if she\u2019s a \u201cpoetess\u201d\n\nI mean, Jesus Christ.", "description": "We\u2019ve seen Logan struggle a lot, but never have we seen him performing in quite this way.
