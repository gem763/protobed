REUTERS/Abdullah Rashid\n\n\u201cThis strange man we had never seen before took the podium instead of our regular imam,\u201d said Fahd Qishmou, 48, who attended Baghdadi\u2019s infamous speech, proclaiming himself \u201ccaliph\u201d over millions of people in Iraq and Syria.\n\n\u201cHe came to our mosque, a place of peace for us, and he turned it into a place of hell,\u201d said Qishmou, a father of eight.\n\nOnce a proud symbol of Mosul, the 850-year-old mosque has lain in ruin since Islamic State was routed there in 2017, piles of twisted metal and flattened stone.\n\nWearing black robes, with a long beard, Baghdadi, residents said, spoke eloquently and with extreme calm. Drones, controlled by Baghdadi\u2019s personal guard, made up mostly of foreign fighters, hovered overhead and cut off communication.\n\n\u201cAll of a sudden, he declared Islamic State was born,\u201d Qishmou said, \u201cand asked us all to pledge allegiance.\u201d\n\nBaghdadi, who had led the jihadist group since 2010, died \"whimpering and crying\" in a raid here by U.S. special forces in northwest Syria, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Sunday. {nL8N27D3WE]\n\n\u201cI knew we were heading for trouble the day that man walked into my mosque,\u201d said Abu Omran, a 60-year-old metalworker.\n\n\u201cI told my son, that man will bring death and destruction \u2013 and I was right.\u201d\n\nQishmou, who now drives a taxi after his yoghurt shops were destroyed during the war to retake Mosul, was one of several residents Reuters spoke to in the shadow of the al-Nuri mosque, where Baghdadi announced the birth of his ultra-extremist group.\n\nIt was the crowning moment in a reign of terror that stretched over three years and two countries. Islamic State overran large swathes of Iraq and Syria in 2014 only to be beaten back in 2017. Mosul was their Iraqi capital.\n\nTOO LATE TO BE HAPPY\n\nFew minced their words looking back on Baghdadi\u2019s reign. Some swore, even as the call to prayer wafted overheard.\n\n\u201cBecause of him, we starved ... We lived on flour and water for months, cowering in our basements,\u201d said Abu Omran. \u201cI don\u2019t wish that life on my worst enemy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ask if I\u2019m happy he died? I would be happy if my house hadn\u2019t collapsed under bombs, if I hadn\u2019t been whipped and shot by (Islamic State fighters), if my son hadn\u2019t been killed. We never even tasted victory, how can we ever be happy again?\u201d\n\nAbu Omran looked around the ruins of the Old City as he spoke. The neighbourhood, a warren of narrow streets dating back centuries and now reduced mostly to rubble, saw the fiercest fighting as Islamic State dug in for its final stand.\n\nIts streets bear the scars of the horrors Moslawis survived \u2013 either living under Islamic State\u2019s draconian rule or during nine months of brutal fighting, as Iraqi forces backed by a U.S.-led coalition fought to recapture the city.\n\nWhen Baghdadi first announced Mosul was his, some residents welcomed the change in leadership. The Sunni Muslim city had been lawless and outside the control of the Shi\u2019ite-led central government for years since a U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003.\n\n\u201cThere had always been people at the mosque who were sympathetic to Al Qaeda, who hated living under these new Shi\u2019ite leaders,\u201d said Abu Omran, who frequented the mosque weekly before and after Islamic State came to power.\n\n\u201cAfter Baghdadi spoke, I looked around the room \u2013 there were at least 1,000 people there \u2013 some people were smiling, praising God for sending them a true Muslim leader.\u201d\n\nResidents told stories of how in the first few weeks, it seemed like a new dawn for Mosul. Security forces who had long clashed with Al Qaeda fighters in their neighbourhoods were now gone, they said, and the streets were clean and calm.\n\nBut then Baghdadi\u2019s foot soldiers came out in force, foreign fighters and religious police watching their every move.\n\n\u201cWe were whipped for smoking, beaten for letting our women out of the house without face coverings and using mobile phones\u201d said shopkeeper Dawoud Omar Dawoud, 42. \u201cBaghdadi imprisoned us in our own city.\u201d\n\nThe group soon lost popularity in the areas it took over after it started enforcing its strict ultra-orthodox version of Islam with public beheadings, executions and floggings.\n\n\u201cHis death doesn\u2019t really matter \u2013 the second that man set foot in our city, he killed us all,\u201d Dawoud said.", "description": "When Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi took to the pulpit of Iraq's historic al-Nuri mosque to declare his caliphate in 2014, residents of Mosul had no idea the extent to which their city would be devastated.", "authors": ["Raya Jalabi", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445911824&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R1DC", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
