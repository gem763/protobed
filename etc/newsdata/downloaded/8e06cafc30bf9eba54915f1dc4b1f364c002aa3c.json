The Xbox controller is priced at $59.95 and is available from Apple\u2019s website.\n\nI\u2019m not seeing any local stores with stock just yet, but it\u2019s not unreasonable to think that Apple might give it some shelf space to help promote Apple Arcade. Playing all of those titles using the controller you\u2019re already familiar with can make all the difference. Apple is already offering next-day shipping for the Xbox Wireless Controller. That said, this probably isn\u2019t the best place to pick up Microsoft\u2019s gamepad since it\u2019s often on sale at Best Buy, Amazon, and other retailers.\n\nThere\u2019s no sign of Sony\u2019s DualShock 4 controller on Apple\u2019s store, however. Apple also introduced support for the PlayStation 4\u2019s gamepad with iOS 13, iPadOS, tvOS 13, and macOS Catalina. Both controllers can be paired to Apple\u2019s devices over Bluetooth and then be used in any games that support them.", "description": "Apple has begun selling Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Wireless Controller after adding support for the gamepad in the latest major software updates for iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, and the Mac.
