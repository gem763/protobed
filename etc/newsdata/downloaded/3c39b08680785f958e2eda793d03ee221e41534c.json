Overall, renewable electricity is expected to grow by 1,200GW in the next five years, the equivalent of the total electricity capacity of the US.\n\n\u201cThis is a pivotal time for renewable energy,\u201d said the IEA\u2019s executive director, Fatih Birol. \u201cTechnologies such as solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind are at the heart of transformations taking place across the global energy system. Their increasing deployment is crucial for efforts to tackle greenhouse gas emissions, reduce air pollution, and expand energy access.\u201d\n\nThe Guardian reported earlier this month that a renewable energy revolution could end the world\u2019s rising demand for oil and coal in the 2020s, decades ahead of forecasts from oil and mining companies.\n\nRenewable energy sources make up 26% of the world\u2019s electricity today, but according to the IEA its share is expected to reach 30% by 2024. The resurgence follows a global slowdown last year, due to falling technology costs and rising environmental concerns.\n\nBig oil to be eclipsed by the sun Read more\n\nHowever, Birol warned that the role of renewables in the global energy system would need to grow even faster if the world hopes to meet its climate targets.\n\nThe report said growing climate ambitions in the European Union and the US played the biggest role in driving the IEA\u2019s forecasts higher, but it will be China which leads the way in rolling out wind and solar energy projects.\n\nThe IEA expects solar energy to play the biggest role in jumpstarting fresh growth in global renewable energy because falling costs are already below retail electricity prices in most countries.\n\nThe cost of solar power is expected to decline by a further 15% to 35% by 2024, spurring further growth over the second half of the decade.\n\nThe appetite of energy-hungry businesses and factories is expected to be the biggest driver of the solar power boom as company bosses exploit falling costs to help cut their energy bills.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nBut the number of home solar panels is also expected to more than double to reach around 100m rooftops by 2024, with the strongest per capita growth in Australia, Belgium, California, the Netherlands and Austria.\n\nEven after the \u201cspectacular\u201d growth expected for solar over the next five years, panels will cover only 6% of the world\u2019s available rooftops, leaving room for further growth.\n\n\u201cRenewables are already the world\u2019s second largest source of electricity, but their deployment still needs to accelerate if we are to achieve long-term climate, air quality and energy access goals,\u201d Birol said.\n\nHe warned that although the potential for solar power was \u201cbreathtaking\u201d the rapid rollout could disrupt electricity markets unless regulators and utilities adapt.", "description": "Energy agency says solar power will drive faster than forecast growth in renewables", "authors": ["Jillian Ambrose"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3cbb36fedac9cfc7ba6326dcceb7f54d4a6a7476/9_236_4918_2951/master/4918.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7c9601b51feea922b3d8c2f2c7f59733", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
