More\n\nText messages released last week show that he and Kurt Volker, Trump's former special envoy to Ukraine, orchestrated a months-long effort to push Ukraine's newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to make a public promise that he would order probes into both of those matters.\n\n\"Heard from the White House,\" Volker wrote in a text to a top Zelensky adviser on July 25, just before Trump and Zelensky were scheduled to speak by phone in a call that helped spark the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\"Assuming President Z (Zelensky) convinces trump he will investigate/\"get to the bottom of what happened\" in 2016, we will nail down a date for visit to Washington. Good luck!,\" Volker told his Ukrainian counterpart.\n\nAfter the Trump-Zelensky call, an unnamed whistleblower filed a complaint accusing Trump of using the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election. Biden is a leading 2020 candidate for the Democratic nomination.\n\nEven before the whistleblower complaint, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, Bill Taylor, raised concerns about the apparent link between Trump's demands for a politically motivated investigation and granting Zelensky a meeting at the White House. Taylor also pressed Volker and Sondland on whether Trump was withholding nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid until Zelensky delivered on his demands.\n\n\"Are we now saying that security assistance and WH meeting are conditioned on investigations?\" Taylor asked in a Sept. 1 text message to Volker and Sondland.\n\n\"Call me,\" Sondland texted back.\n\nTaylor responded: \"As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.\"", "description": "Gordon Sondland, President Trump's ambassador to the European Union, was scheduled to appear before a trio of committees Tuesday morning.", "authors": ["Deirdre Shesgreen", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/yQBBdv5dBtNe8ME9IR9l.g--~B/aD00NTc5O3c9MzM4NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/92eaefa14b15832e74d20cfbdd0364b2", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
