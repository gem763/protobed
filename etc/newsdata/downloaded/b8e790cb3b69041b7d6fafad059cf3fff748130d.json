They are demanding $115 million for pay lost and legal fees.\n\nThe Southwest Airlines Pilots Association filed a lawsuit on Monday which said that Boeing misled pilots and airlines by not telling them about a new flight-control system called MCAS.\n\nMCAS is the center of the current investigations into the fatal crashes, including a Lion air flight in October 2019 that nosedived 12 minutes after takeoff from Jakarta airport in Indonesia, killing all 189 passengers and crew.\n\nThe second crash - which finally got the planes grounded - was an Ethiopian Airlines crash just six minutes after takeoff, not far from the Ethiopian capital city of Addis Adabba. All 157 people on board were killed.\n\nAircraft are parked on the tarmac after being grounded, at the Southern California Logistics Airport in Victorville, California. Pilots from Texas-based Southwest Airlines said today they had filed a lawsuit against Boeing, accusing it of 'deliberately misleading' them over the 737 MAX, which has been grounded after two deadly crashes\n\nWreckage is piled at the crash scene of an Ethiopian Airlines flight crash outside Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The Boeing 737 Max jet can be seen in bits after after it crashed this year\n\nFlaws found in the MCAS concept, in crew training resources and operational procedures, and other flight systems have caused the grounding of the fleet.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in a Texas state court in Dallas, could make it harder for Boeing to gain public confidence in the plane.\n\nChicago-based Boeing hopes to use pilots in a campaign to reassure travelers once regulators approve changes that the company is making to the plane.\n\n'We believe this lawsuit is meritless and will vigorously defend against it,' Boeing responded, in a statement from spokesman Charles Bickers.\n\n'We will continue to work with Southwest Airlines and its pilots on efforts to safely return the Max to service.'\n\nSouthwest had more Max jets than any airline when the plane was grounded in March. The union said the grounding has eliminated more than 30,000 Southwest flights.\n\nThe president of the pilots\u2019 union said in an interview that the lawsuit followed failed negotiations with Boeing over compensation for more than $100 million in income that pilots have lost due to canceled flights. Also at issue were the union\u2019s expenses to comply with a subpoena from the Justice Department, which is conducting a criminal investigation into Boeing\u2019s representations to regulators who certified the plane.\n\nThe lawsuit, however, uses harsh language in condemning Boeing for what it told airlines and pilots about the Max, which went into service in 2017. Boeing sold the plane as a more fuel-efficient but otherwise lightly modified version of the 737, which has flown since the 1960s\n\nThe union leader, Jon Weaks, said he believes Boeing will make the plane safe and pilots will resume flying it.\n\n'When the plane comes back, it will be one of the most examined airplanes ever,\u201d he said. 'The problems they had with MCAS are being engineered out of it.'\n\nThe lawsuit, however, uses harsh language in condemning Boeing for what it told airlines and pilots about the Max, which went into service in 2017. Boeing sold the plane as a more fuel-efficient but otherwise lightly modified version of the 737, which has flown since the 1960s.\n\n'Those representations proved to be false,' the union says in its lawsuit.\n\n'The 737 MAX now is grounded worldwide because it is unsafe, unairworthy, and contrary to Boeing\u2019s representations, distinct from the 737 family of aircraft that preceded it, which SWAPA pilots have flown for years.'\n\nBoeing faces dozens of lawsuits filed by passengers\u2019 families and has settled a few for undisclosed terms. In July, it announced a $4.9 billion after-tax charge to cover compensation it expects to pay airlines in coming years to cover canceled flights\n\nThe problem with the plane has been blamed on the MCAS system which many pilots didn't know how to operate\n\nBefore both crashes, MCAS was activated by faulty sensor readings and pushed the planes\u2019 noses down. The union charged that Boeing abandoned good design practices and withheld key safety information from regulators in its rush to get the plane on the market.\n\nThe lawsuit cited news accounts for many of its claims. Investigations have not been completed into crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia that killed 346 people.\n\nBoeing faces dozens of lawsuits filed by passengers\u2019 families and has settled a few for undisclosed terms.

Southwest dropped the plane from its schedule through Jan. 5, and Weaks said he doesn\u2019t expect it back until February or March.", "description": "Pilots from Southwest Airlines have filed a lawsuit against Boeing for loss of income, alleging the firm rushed the 737 Max into circulation forcing the fleet to be grounded  after two deadly crashes.", "authors": ["Ryan Fahey For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/08/11/19438706-0-image-a-52_1570531950394.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
