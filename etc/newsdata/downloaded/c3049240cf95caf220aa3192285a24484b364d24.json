Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, and Kellyanne Conway have not been able to limit the president\u2019s tendency to lash out with the most incendiary rhetoric he can imagine. Melania Trump\u2019s call to \u201cbe best\u201d has clearly had no impact on how Trump tweets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell had his druthers, Trump would make different decisions and say different things, but obviously the president does not check with McConnell before blurting out what\u2019s on his mind. Judging from the account of former secretary of defense James Mattis\u2019 speechwriter, Guy Snodgrass, Mattis could not get the president to even pay sustained attention in briefings, much less alter the way he speaks about U.S. allies. And while many seem to believe the relationship between President Trump and Fox News is symbiotic, Trump will hop onto Twitter and complain about any host or guest that he deems excessively critical of him.\n\nFurious criticism from the media, Congressional Democrats, Democratic presidential candidates, and others has not altered the president\u2019s rhetoric. Republican loss of their House majority did not spur any discernible change in the president\u2019s tone or attitude after the midterm elections. The real threat of impeachment by the House has not changed the way the president speaks, thinks, or behaves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNone of these individuals or institutions have managed to even come close to \u201creining in\u201d what President Trump says.
