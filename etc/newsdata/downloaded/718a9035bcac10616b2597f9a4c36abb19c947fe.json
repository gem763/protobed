In response, Iran stopped abiding by some commitments in the deal.\n\nThe EU has sought to salvage the accord. The Iranian tanker was seized because it was suspected of heading to Syria in breach of EU sanctions.\n\nAuthorities in Gibraltar released the vessel on 15 August after receiving assurances from Iran that it would not discharge its cargo in Syria.\n\nWhat has the US done in response?\n\nThe US has been trying to seize the tanker since it was released by Gibraltar.\n\nIt issued a warrant and blacklisted the vessel, threatening sanctions on any country which offered it aid. The ship has since been sailing east across the Mediterranean.\n\nEarlier this week it was revealed that a US official had even offered the captain of the ship millions of dollars to change course and sail the tanker to somewhere the US might be able to seize it.\n\nFollowing the emergence of the satellite images on Saturday, the UK's Foreign Office called the reports of the ship's presence near Syria \"deeply troubling\".", "description": "A tanker last spotted off Syria has sold its oil, Iran says - despite promises not to sail to Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/A2EA/production/_108660714_hi055916185.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
