Ted Cruz warned Republicans not to pursue expanded background checks Thursday at an event sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor, saying that it could jeopardize their chances in 2020.\n\n\u201cIf Republicans abandon the Second Amendment and demoralize millions of Americans who care deeply about Second Amendment rights, that could go a long way to electing a President Elizabeth Warren,\u201d replied Cruz when asked about whether he thought President Trump would back a modified version of the 2013 background check proposal from Sens. Joe Manchin and Pat Toomey.\n\nCruz asked about potential political fallout for President Trump if the party embraces background-check measures: \"If Republicans abandon the 2nd Amendment,\u201d he says, \u201cThat could go a long way to electing a President Elizabeth Warren.\u201d \u2014 Christal Hayes (@Journo_Christal) September 12, 2019\n\nCruz cautioned that Democratic turnout in 2020 will be \u201crecord-shattering\u201d and Republicans shouldn\u2019t do anything that would keep GOP voters home.\n\nOn a policy level, he said expanding background check requirements would also be a mistake.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats\u2019 proposal would not have prevented any of these mass murders.
