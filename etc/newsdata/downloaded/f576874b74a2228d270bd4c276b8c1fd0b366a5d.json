Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) took turns criticizing Warren over her support for Medicare-for-all and her purist approach to populism.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re competing to be president for the day after Trump. Our country will be horrifyingly polarized, even more than now. After everything we\u2019ve been through, after everything we are about to go through, this country will be even more divided,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cWhy unnecessarily divide this country over health care when there\u2019s a better way to deliver coverage for all?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe focus on Warren deflected attention from others facing scrutiny entering Tuesday\u2019s debate, which was hosted by CNN and the New York Times.\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden went for long stretches without surfacing, as the rest of the field appeared reluctant early in the debate to echo Republican criticisms of Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, and his work on the board of a Ukranian energy company while his father was the Obama administration\u2019s point person there. Attacks on Biden\u2019s more moderate positions were fleeting, unlike in earlier debates.\n\nAD\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), meanwhile, showed no signs of lingering health trouble in his first public appearance since suffering a heart attack two weeks ago. But he also did not answer questions about his health.\n\nThe stage was swollen with a dozen candidates, the most on a debate stage this year. And with several at risk of not making the next set of debates, a number of feisty exchanges were triggered by low-polling candidates still hoping to revive their campaigns. The debate also came at a pivotal time: just four months before the Iowa caucuses, and when the impeachment inquiry that House Democrats have launched against Trump has sucked up most of the political oxygen.\n\nAD\n\nIt was the unrelenting onslaught against Warren that most deviated from past gatherings.\n\nAD\n\nFormer congressman Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas accused Warren of supporting \u201cpunitive\u201d tax policy. Businessman Andrew Yang questioned Warren over her plan to break up large technology companies. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) chastised Warren for not agreeing that Trump\u2019s Twitter account should be suspended. Unprompted, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii) twice roped Warren into her answers, questioning the senator\u2019s foreign policy credentials.\n\n\u201cI appreciate Elizabeth\u2019s work,\u201d Klobuchar said at one point. \u201cBut again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something that you can actually get done.\u201d\n\nThe tenor of the debate was the clearest sign yet that Warren\u2019s ascendancy would force her campaign to grapple with the challenges of being the front-runner in a large and unwieldy Democratic field.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWarren fought back against the attacks, casting her challengers as too small-minded or timid for the moment, or as part of an entrenched political system that is dominated by corporations and the wealthy.\n\n\u201cLook, I understand that this is hard, but I think as Democrats, we are going to succeed when we dream big and fight hard, not when we dream small and quit before we get started,\u201d Warren said.\n\nThe debate also underscored the deep policy divisions that persist among Democrats on issues including health care, abortion, taxes, education, inequality, technology, foreign policy and trade. Health care was perhaps the most contentious issue, as it has been in previous debates.\n\nAD\n\nModerate candidates pilloried the Medicare-for-all program backed by Warren and Sanders as overly expensive, unworkable and likely to raise costs on middle-class Americans.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYour signature, senator, is to have a plan for everything, except for this,\u201d Buttigieg said, facing Warren, as he accused her of giving an evasive answer when asked if Medicare-for-all would lead to tax increases for Americans.\n\nKlobuchar, among those onstage who have yet to meet the qualifications for the November debate, also weighed in.\n\n\u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s being honest here and saying how he\u2019s going to pay for this and that taxes are going to go up,\u201d Klobuchar said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry, Elizabeth, but you have not said that, and I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we\u2019re going to send the invoice.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut Klobuchar also challenged Warren\u2019s approach more broadly. More than once, she told Warren that her idea is \u201cnot the only idea,\u201d suggesting that Warren\u2019s approach was both inflexible and impractical.\n\nAD\n\nWarren insisted that overall costs for the middle class would go down under her plan, while corporations and the wealthy would pay more. She also criticized plans from more moderate candidates who have pushed for an optional Medicare buy-in program.\n\n\u201cI will not sign a bill into law that does not lower costs for middle-class families,\u201d she said.\n\nSanders defended his Medicare-for-all plan, which would provide everyone with government-sponsored health care and would largely abolish the private health-care industry.\n\nAD\n\nAs the debate began, the moment felt particularly tenuous for Biden, whose campaign has been rattled by attacks from Trump about his son Hunter that have temporarily overshadowed concerns that some Democratic primary voters had previously voiced about a record they view as out of step with the base of the party.\n\nAD\n\nBiden\u2019s lukewarm debate performances and his halting response to Trump have only elevated those concerns, which have become evident in declining poll numbers and a fundraising haul that was eclipsed by all of his major primary rivals.\n\nIn the days leading up to the debate, Biden and his son launched twin efforts to try to alleviate concerns that Biden is poorly positioned to counter Trump\u2019s baseless charges about his son while at the same time answering concerns about why he allowed the perception of a conflict of interest.\n\nAD\n\nBiden has vowed that his administration would not allow family members to conduct overseas business, a pledge meant to inoculate him from attacks but one that also raises questions about why he did not do more to prevent an appearance of conflict while he was vice president. When asked about that contradiction early in the debate, Biden did not directly respond.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy son did nothing wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cI did nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nWith Democrats reluctant to pile on, the debate turned to other topics, and reached its caustic peak when O\u2019Rourke and Buttigieg, whose tensions have boiled just below the surface, engaged in a bitter clash over gun buyback programs. O\u2019Rourke is one of the few candidates to push for a mandatory gun buyback program, which Buttigieg said was unrealistic.\n\n\u201cCongressman, you made it clear you don\u2019t know how this would work,\u201d Buttigieg responded. \u201cDevelop the plan further, we can have a debate.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not a purity test,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cThis is a crisis, and we\u2019ve got to do something about it.\u201d He suggested that Buttigieg was adopting poll-tested positions and lacking the political courage to do something bold.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need lessons from you on courage, political or personal,\u201d Buttigieg snapped.\n\nAD\n\nIt was part of a more forceful performance from Buttigieg, who directly challenged several of the contenders onstage, often turning to face them as he delivered pointed barbs.\n\nAt one point, he turned to Gabbard, a fellow combat veterans, and told her she was \u201cdead wrong\u201d to say the United States should immediately withdraw troops from the Middle East.\n\nThat exchange came during a lengthy discussion of foreign policy, which has played a limited role thus far in a presidential primary dominated by domestic issues like health care, inequality and race.\n\nTrump\u2019s recent decision to withdraw troops from northeast Syria and allow a Turkish invasion has drawn bipartisan condemnation and raised questions about how Democratic presidential candidates would handle the country\u2019s foreign entanglements.\n\nThe Trump administration is struggling to contain the damage in the wake of Turkey\u2019s incursion, with White House officials saying that it has led to a humanitarian crisis and increased the threat of terrorism.\n\nAlthough Gabbard and Buttigieg have each called for the United States to bring troops home from the Middle East, they took opposing positions on the stage Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWhat is an endless war if it\u2019s not another regime-change war?\u201d she asked Buttigieg.\n\nThe United States has been at war in Iraq and Afghanistan since the early 2000s, and Biden was among those who voted to authorize the conflicts. But in a sign of Biden\u2019s relatively drama-free night, his vote did not come up during the lengthy discussion of foreign policy. Sanders referred to it glancingly toward the end of the debate, calling the vote \u201cdisastrous.\u201d\n\nCandidates instead went fiercely after Trump, whom Booker accused of \u201cmoral weakness\u201d and a \u201cdumpster fire\u201d policy. Biden called Trump an \u201cerratic, crazy president who knows not a damn thing about foreign policy.\u201d", "description": "While Trump gave Democrats an early reprieve from their internecine policy battles, those fights quickly emerged once the debate shifted from the president to candidates\u2019 visions for what they would do in office.", "authors": ["Toluse Olorunnipa", "White House Reporter", "Chelsea Janes", "Reporter Covering The Presidential Campaign", "Matt Viser", "National Political Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/0jnSLpv5fLv_Aud7A802vBfst9o=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KJGUMWHPV4I6TCPL5RLM2QKHGI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
