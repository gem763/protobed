Its food scientists test out several variations and perfect their recipes. Then its marketing team pulls together a plan to ensure the candy makes a splash. Only then can stores place their orders \u2014 months ahead of Halloween \u2014 and figure out how to display them.\n\nIt's a lot of work. But it's worth it.\n\n\"Halloween is our No. 1 season at Mars ... [and it] continues to become increasingly important,\" Tim LeBel, president of sales for Mars Wrigley in the United States, told CNN Business.\n\nHalloween is one of the rare occasions when candy appears on people's shopping lists. Otherwise, people tend to buy candy on impulse \u2014 and that urge is weaker when they're shopping online. Although candy sales are steady, e-commerce is \"one of the things that I think keeps candy makers up at night,\" said Crystal Lindell, editor of Candy Industry Magazine.\n\nSo when this candy-centric holiday comes around, Mars Wrigley and others pull out all the stops. To get the most out of Halloween, Mars Wrigely has to jazz up it core items, spark a conversation online and take full advantage of the eight-week-long Halloween season in stores. Yes, eight weeks.\n\nBringing Halloween to Skittles\n\nIn 2016, Mars Wrigley poured $50 million into its Yorkville, Illinois, candy factory to expand the facility \u2014 which also makes Life Savers and Doublemint and Juicy Fruit gums \u2014 and add a Skittles production line. Today, Skittles branding is featured prominently throughout the space \u2014 in office conference rooms, hallways and throughout the sprawling, sweet-scented factory itself, where the candies are made and packaged.\n\nWith such a big investment in its candy brands, Mars needs to keep people interested.\n\nOne of this year's notable creations, Zombie Skittles, have already made a splash. The candy comes in a gray, ominous-looking package, each containing several sweet Skittles and some that taste ... a little off. For some, the \"Zombie\" flavor may resemble fruit gone bad. Some identify the tang of garlic, and others a hint of meat. Mars won't disclose what \"Zombie\" actually is, but it's supposed to taste unpleasant enough to elicit a reaction \u2014 but not so awful as to turn you off Skittles for good.\n\nYouTube is filled with videos of people trying and reacting to Zombie Skittles.\n\n\"We wanted to put a twist on what our delicious flavors are,\" said Caitlin Hubbard, a product development scientist for Mars. \"However, we didn't want it to be too twisty, that it would scare you from eating the rest of the bag.\"\n\nMars found through its research that younger consumers especially are interested in an element of surprise. The product itself was designed to appeal to those shoppers. And to make sure they know it's out there, Mars tried to make it go viral.\n\n\"We truly believe it's going to have a halo effect on Skittles original,\" LeBel said.\n\n#DareTheRainbow\n\nWhen Mars first announced Zombie Skittles, it encouraged consumers to shoot video of themselves and their friends trying the flavor, and sharing it on social media with the hashtag #DareTheRainbow. Getting people excited about candy helps \"keep consumers engaged,\" said LeBel, and makes sure that they keep coming back to products like Skittles.\n\nZombie Skittles are here, try them if you dare.

The gold standard of a viral candy campaign, she added, is rival Jelly Belly's BeanBoozled challenge.\n\nThe BeanBoozled challenge, which has taken place for years, is simple. Customers buy a special box of Jelly Beans that includes both traditional, sweet flavors and their unappetizing doubles. For example, in a BeanBoozled box of jelly beans, a yellow and white jelly bean is either buttered popcorn or rotten egg, a white jelly bean is either coconut or spoiled milk, and so on (LeBel said that Zombie Skittles were not inspired by the BeanBoozled beans).\n\nOn YouTube, videos of celebrities reacting to the jelly beans have garnered millions of views. Jelly Belly sells the candies in a special gift box equipped with a spinner that tells players which flavor they have to try. Customers can even download a BeanBoozled challenge app to their phones.\n\nThat type of hype can raise awareness and excitement around a product and drive sales. But Mars doesn't just want its products to cause an online stir. It needs Halloween items to pull people into stores and fly off retail shelves throughout the eight-week-long season.\n\nSixty days of Halloween\n\nPeople may complain about seeing fall products \u2014 like seasonal lattes or Halloween candy \u2014 on shelves in the summer, but that doesn't mean they don't buy them.\n\n\"If you're putting Halloween candy out in August, there's a reason,\" said Lindell. \"It does sell that early.\"\n\nFor retailers looking to increase foot traffic, it's a way to bring people into stores. \"Halloween is truly a mutual opportunity with retailers,\" LeBel noted. People popping into stores to pick up their Halloween candy might also pick up additional items \u2014 an important opportunity for retailers, especially if they're losing out to competition online.\n\nBut the candy must be a big enough draw.\n\n\"If the Halloween season and Mars Wrigley products were not delivering, we would not get eight weeks. We would not get six weeks,\" said LeBel. \"The extension of the season tells you how important Halloween is to our business partners.\"\n\nTo lure customers, Mars and retailers put together big store displays and lean on an increasingly enthusiastic Halloween demographic: grown ups.\n\n\"Adults have taken to costumes, parties, and candies in a big way,\" Marcia Mogelonsky, director of insight of food and drink for Mintel, a research company, told CNN Business in an email. \"Candy makers are playing into the 'aging' of the holiday with more sophisticated treats,\" she added. \"There are still gummy eyeballs and brains for the kids, but there are also products like Mystery Double Dark Chocolate Brownie chocolate bars.\"\n\nFor adults, Halloween is not just about nostalgia but also the changing seasons \u2014 more of an autumnal celebration than a day to gorge on candy. Now, the two months of Halloween season are split into three rough stages, said LeBel. The first is baking, when people start whipping up fall-themed treats in their kitchens and add holiday-themed M&Ms or other candies to their recipes. After baking comes celebrating, when customers buy candy for their Halloween parties.\n\nAnd finally, there's the main event: trick-or-treating.\n\nThat's \"where the majority of our sales come from,\" LeBel said.", "description": "It takes the maker of M&M's, Skittles and Snickers two years to get ready for Halloween.", "authors": ["Article Danielle Wiener-Bronner", "Cnn Business Video Deborah Brunswick", "Bryce Urbany", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191025182709-how-skittles-are-made-01-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
