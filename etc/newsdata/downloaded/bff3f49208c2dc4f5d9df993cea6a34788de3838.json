We\u2019re having a meeting to discuss your role.\u201d\n\nFaced with the task of securing an appropriate support person for the potentially tense meeting, Thompson, an aspiring comedian, said: \u201cI thought it\u2019s best to bring in a professional, and so I paid $200 and hired a clown.\u201d\n\nThe clown, who Thompson refers to as \u201cJoe\u201d, crafted balloon animals throughout the meeting, including a poodle. His antics were squeaky, and Thompson\u2019s bosses had to request he quieten down several times.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s further understood,\u201d reported the Herald, \u201cthat the clown mimed crying when the redundancy paperwork was handed over.\u201d\n\nA picture of the meeting, taken through a boardroom\u2019s glass doors by an unknown spectator, is of compromised quality, though one can detect that Joe, the clown, is wearing a colorful hat and a yellow bib, and that Thompson, leaning back in his chair, indeed looks relaxed for someone in the process of getting laid off.\n\nThompson told Magic Talk radio: \u201cI mean, I did get fired, but apart from that it was all smooth running.\u201d\n\nFortunately, Thompson will not be out of work for long. The Australian ad agency DDB confirmed Thompson will start a new role in its office next week.\n\nAs of publishing, no reports have suggested what\u2019s next for Joe.", "description": "Josh Thompson hired clown \u2013 who reportedly mimed crying as the paperwork was handed over \u2013 as emotional support aide", "authors": ["Adrienne Matei"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9026c89734f62a9e07390f1e656877b76a2a6033/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5e717776e4482844698079b6e729732f", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
