What kind? Most of us don\u2019t know or care.\n\nOur homes in America are increasingly powered by natural gas \u2014 particularly Massachusetts.\n\nWe live in homes heated by natural gas.\n\nSome of us cook with natural-gas stoves.\n\nBut we don\u2019t actually think about this. We aren\u2019t thankful when the lights come on. Reporters don\u2019t bother writing stories about how nuclear power plants stood up well to hurricanes. As someone on Twitter told me last week, \u201cDog doesn't bite man is rarely newsworthy.\u201d\n\nHonestly, I should have written this story when, in that not too-distant past, I accidentally left my gas-powered stove on just a touch and unknowingly filled my home with natural gas all day. Four fire trucks came. My neighbor darkly joked about the irony of an energy reporter dying of a natural gas explosion (I was not amused).\n\nI didn\u2019t write a story, because I didn\u2019t explode and I carried on with my life like nothing happened. The moral of that story: I am just as bad as you, and I cover this most days of my life!\n\nThis lack of consciousness of energy makes the job of those who work in it unforgiving and unrelenting. You get no positive reinforcement for doing a job perfectly that we all rely on. Yet, in the rare times something goes wrong, you\u2019re suddenly the devil and the world should get rid of you yesterday.\n\nEmbedded in all of this is risk: how much we\u2019re willing to take and what tradeoffs we\u2019re willing to accept in order to minimize risk.\n\nSome risk we\u2019re aware of and can choose: driving a car or flying in a plane. Then there\u2019s risk we may be unaware of or have no choice to avoid: natural gas exploding in our homes, or a nuclear plant 30 miles away at risk of melting down.\n\nThe risks of these are infinitesimal, but the fear is real. And, in rare moments they happen: Massachusetts gas explosions, Fukushima nuclear meltdown, BP oil spill.\n\nFor some context, in America:\n\nIn 2017, eight people died related to pipeline incidents\n\nTwice as\n\nSome folks might be thinking right about now, \"Hey, you\u2019re forgetting renewables, they\u2019re the answer.\" Yes, they are part of it. Renewables aren\u2019t explosive (big plus), and their share of the world\u2019s electricity mix is growing fast.\n\nBut the world is still deeply dependent upon fossil fuels (81% to be exact), and tradeoffs exist with wind and solar (they need heck of a lot of land, for example, to match fossil fuels and nuclear).\n\nSo even while a transition is underway to safer forms of energy, it's critical to make sure the risk of our current dominant sources is as close to zero as possible. Lawmakers are already calling for hearings in response to the Massachusetts explosions.\n\nA 2010 gas pipeline blast in San Bruno, Calif., which killed eight people, led to the inclusion of new safeguards, like automatic pipeline shutoff valves, in a 2011 pipeline safety reauthorization bill. But its implementation remains incomplete.\n\n\u201cWhen energy hurts somebody outside its immediate value chain, there\u2019s usually a policy response.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Kevin Book, managing director, analysis firm ClearView Energy Partners\n\nWhat\u2019s next: I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention the longest term, trickiest type of risks: Those posed by a warmer planet, which is occurring largely due to our dependence on fossil fuels.\n\nSea level rise, more extreme storms and more flooding all increase risks for average homeowners, businesses and energy infrastructure, wrote Edward Rust Jr., former longtime State Farm chief executive, in a New York Times op-ed earlier this month. He endorsed a carbon tax as one good way to reduce risk.", "description": "Energy is the thing we all need but don\u2019t notice.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/dBGqDYZYfkpEhRUeSITkDMsP1W0=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2018/09/17/1537144311794.jpg", "published_at": "2018-09-17"}
