There was Lenovo\u2019s first \u201cfoldable PC,\u201d HP\u2019s dual-screen gaming laptop, and even an Asus notebook with two 4K screens. Laptops are definitely getting weird again. As the smartphone industry looks toward dual-screen and foldable phones, laptop makers aren\u2019t far behind, and Microsoft and Intel are pushing them on.\n\nMicrosoft is holding a special Surface hardware event in New York City this morning, where the company will unveil its latest lineup of holiday hardware. It\u2019s also expected to tease the future of what type of hardware we\u2019ll see next year and beyond.\n\nMicrosoft, Intel, and others have been working on dual-screen and foldable devices that use a special version of Windows. Microsoft has referred to this as \u201cWindows Lite\u201d and \u201cSantorini\u201d internally at the company, and it\u2019s designed to be a stripped-down version of Windows that\u2019s prioritized for dual-screen devices. A leak yesterday claims this will be called \u201cWindows 10X.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Intel has been pushing OEMs to create new dual-screen hardware, laptops made out of fabric that have multiple screens, and even wild, dual-screen gaming prototypes. This hardware all looks futuristic, but some of it is already here or coming soon.\n\nMicrosoft hasn\u2019t publicly unveiled any of its dual-screen or foldable work, but the company did hint earlier this year that a new version of Windows is on the way with seamless background updates that sound more Chrome OS-like.\n\nToday could be the day we finally get to hear more about Microsoft and Intel\u2019s ambitious plans. In recent years, Microsoft has been creating a new Composable Shell (C-Shell) and Windows Core OS, a more modular version of the existing Windows Shell that powers parts of Windows 10. Some of Windows Core OS is now powering hardware like the HoloLens 2 or Microsoft\u2019s upcoming Surface Hub 2X.\n\nJust ignore the fact that we shouldn't use a flexible screen with a stylus. ;-) pic.twitter.com/6TtnQH31p4 \u2014 Jonas Daehnert (@PhoneDesigner) September 27, 2019\n\nWindows Lite is thought to be part of this Windows Core OS work, and the changes Microsoft makes to its Windows operating system will be key for the future of dual-screen and foldable hardware. The Windows Lite interface will be similar to Windows 10, but more of a blend of what Microsoft does with its Surface Hub shell and the previous Windows Phone Continuum user interface. Leaks have suggested there could be some Start menu changes, but there\u2019s bound to be a lot more work to the entire UI to make Windows shine on this new hardware.\n\nMicrosoft isn\u2019t only working on the software side, though. The software maker previously teased its own dual-screen Surface device, codenamed \u201cCentaurus,\u201d earlier this year. It\u2019s designed to be the hero device for all these new dual-screen tablet / laptop hybrids and to really show what these devices can do. Microsoft was previously working on a smaller \u201cpocketable\u201d Surface device codenamed \u201cAndromeda,\u201d but the company scrapped this in favor of the larger Centaurus hardware.\n\nSurface chief Panos Panay revealed last year that a pocketable Surface device was \u201cabsolutely my baby\u201d in an interview with The Verge. Panay also revealed that \u201cwe will invent and we will create when products are right. We can\u2019t bring new categories into the world and not be a place where customers need it.\u201d\n\nMicrosoft famously canceled a Surface Mini device just weeks before its announcement, so it\u2019s still possible that Centaurus could meet a similar fate. Given the work going into this project, Windows Lite, and Intel\u2019s OEM push, it seems very likely we\u2019re about to see some weird and wonderful Windows devices once again.\n\nIf Microsoft is ready to show off its own Surface work and its ambitions for dual-screen Windows devices, then we could start to get a better idea for when these will eventually be available to consumers. Lenovo has promised its foldable PC in some form in the first half of 2020, so it\u2019s reasonable to assume we\u2019ll see these devices appear next year. Either way, get ready, dual-screen and foldable Windows laptops are on the way.", "description": "Microsoft is holding a Surface hardware event in NYC, but we might be about to see the future of dual-screen and foldable Windows hardware.
