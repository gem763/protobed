According to Guinness World Records, the oldest person alive is currently 116 years old, Kane Tanaka, and they say that the first person to live to be 150 is alive today.\n\nFor those who don\u2019t want to work forever, a solid long-term retirement plan is critical. Fortunately, saving for retirement does not have to be daunting. It just requires discipline, time and a plan.\n\nMake it a must\n\nA great place to start is paying yourself first. Once you have found the amount that works to meet your financial needs, consider your retirement savings another must-pay bill and build the discipline to make it part of your regular routine.\n\nIn addition to discipline, time is one of the most powerful forces in preparing for retirement.\n\nIf you started a new job and were offered the choice of a $1 million salary or one that starts with a penny but doubles every day, which would you choose? It may seem like the million is the obvious choice. However, if you took the penny, within 30 days you would be receiving almost $5.4 million!\n\nThe same principal applies to a 20-year-old who saves $100 per month, and ends up with $150,000 in their 60s. Albert Einstein famously described compound interest as the Eighth Wonder of the World, saying, \"He who understands it, earns it. He who doesn\u2019t, pays it.\"\n\nHe who understands it, earns it. He who doesn\u2019t, pays it. - Albert Einstein on compound interest\n\nThe three steps\n\nIf every American prioritizes saving and follows three simple steps, they will be better prepared for retirement: participate in a retirement plan, secure permanent life insurance and ensure a guaranteed lifetime income stream through an annuity.\n\nBy doing any one of these things, they\u2019d be better off. By doing all three, they are guaranteed to live comfortably in retirement.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nRetirement plans \u2013 no brainers\n\nThe first \u2013 participating in a retirement plan \u2013 allows individuals to take advantage of tax benefits, which reduces the actual cost of prioritizing savings, along with putting money away for retirement. In addition, plans with employer contributions provide additional money to participants\u2019 savings at no extra cost to the employee.\n\nThat is money you earned. Not taking it is like giving your employer a part of your paycheck every time you get paid.\n\nPermanent life insurance\n\nAfter you have secured your retirement plan, step two is to purchase permanent life insurance. While permanent life insurance at its core is a protection product that ensures families and businesses will be financially stable after the death of a bread winner, it is also a powerful savings tool.\n\nPermanent life insurance accrues value annually, and those savings can be drawn on when needed. In addition, the cash value in permanent life insurance policies is stable and can be incredibly valuable, especially in contrast to market volatility.\n\nAnnuities\n\nFinally, you should consider purchasing an annuity to ensure a guaranteed lifetime income. Annuities are a tool to provide people with a stable and steady income stream. There are many different kinds of annuities, but the most important feature is that they offer guarantees and cannot be outlived.\n\nEven the most disciplined savers need a plan for converting their accumulated savings into \u201cretirement income\u201d to cover their expenses in those golden years.\n\nBuilding a strong relationship with a trusted financial adviser can help you design a plan. Advisers can help you through each of these steps and review your plan regularly. Just as you should see your doctor for an annual physical, you should also review your financial security plan annually.\n\nMost Americans who have access to a retirement plan participate in one, and the good news is Congress is working on opening up access to more Americans.\n\nThe House has already passed a bill called the SECURE Act, which would make it easier for more Americans to save for retirement. The bill passed 417-3, an impressive bipartisan achievement, showing that even in this polarized environment, saving for retirement is an imperative priority.\n\nThe Senate should pass it this year, and President Trump should sign it, unlocking retirement tools for hundreds of thousands.\n\nSo as we get our fall routines under way, let\u2019s take the steps to better prepare for retirement and do what\u2019s necessary today to live comfortably tomorrow.\n\nMarc R.
