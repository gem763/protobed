Trump greets New Mexico, \u201cby far my favorite Mexico.\u201d He calls the city \u201cAlbacore,\u201d \u201ctuna capital of the United States.\u201d He says he decided to hold the surprise rally because he heard they\u2019re building a wall in Colorado \u201cto keep the New Mexicans out.\u201d He then shows a map of the U.S. (well sort of), divided into odd parts like \u201cGood America,\u201d \u201cLakes?\u201d and \u201cBad Mexico.\u201d \u201cChicago (Hell)\u201d is listed on there too. It reads like the track list of a set of bizarro world Bon Iver b-sides.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nQuickly, though, Baldwin\u2019s Trump brings up a series of supporters to tell his fans \u201cwhat\u2019s really happening in this country.\u201d\n\nIt begins with a few normal folks, for lack of a better word. Cecily Strong portrays Christine from Las Cruces wearing a \u201cKEEM AMARICA GREAB AGRAIN\u201d [sic] t-shirt (she says she took the words verbatim from Trump tweets). She\u2019s mostly worried about the \u201cdeep state lizard conspiracy\u201d that everyone is in on, including \u201cthe CIA, the FBI, the MIC, the KEY, and the MOUSE.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s Mikey Day\u2019s leather vest-clad biker who is a member of Bikers for Trump. \u201cIf they try to get rid of you, then all us bikers, we\u2019re gonna ride,\u201d he says, before pointing out they\u2019ll ride anyway. \u201cIt\u2019s kinda the only thing we do.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe\u2019s followed by Aidy Bryant\u2019s nameless supporter who recognizes Trump as \u201cthe one true white lord.\u201d She\u2019s heard \u201cif you read the title of Michelle Obama\u2019s \u2018Becoming\u2019 backwards, it spells \u2018Gni Moc Eb,' which I looked up in a witch thesaurus, and it\u2019s a synonym for another witch word \u2018snart.' And if you spell \u2018snart\u2019 backwards, that spells \u2018trans,\u2019 so yes they\u2019re coming for us!\u201d She also carries a sidearm and wants everyone to know \u201cthe Earth is flat and Beyonc\u00e9 is white!\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThings get interesting with the next supporter, portrayed by Pete Davidson, who has been absent most of this season. Here he\u2019s a member of ISIS, who was \u201ca prisoner in Syria until last week, when you freed me. So, I just wanted to say, 'Thank you for bringing jobs back. To ISIS. And I promise that I will make ISIS great again!\"\n\nThings kick up quickly. Kate McKinnon\u2019s Lindsey O. Graham arrives next, though at first Trump thinks he\u2019s \u201ca scoop of ice cream melting into a suit,\u201d and delivers a soliloquy from \u201cThe Glass Menagerie\u201d by Tennessee Williams. Alex Moffat then shows up as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg who robotically attempts to defend the company, announcing \u201cFacebook isn\u2019t pro-Russian. It\u2019s just not anti-Russia.\u201d\n\nThe sketch ends with a few surprises. First is master impressionist Darrell Hammond bringing back his famous Bill Clinton. That might seem surprising, but it turns out he didn\u2019t know it was a Trump rally. He just \u201cfollowed the party.\u201d Still, he\u2019s jealous of Trump\u2019s rallies. \u201cOh my Lord, I would never come home,\u201d he said, imagining having his own.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nFinally, Baldwin\u2019s Trump brings up Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, portrayed by another former cast member, Fred Armisen. He asks that Trump \u201cgive this Turkey some gravy\u201d and promises he\u2019s \u201ctreating the Kurds really well.\u201d Quickly though, he starts asking Trump to show his tax returns just to show everyone how rich he is, and then suggests he could make Biden \u201cdisappear.\u201d\n\nWhat made the sketch most surprising was the randomness of its characters. Why have a Bill Clinton? Probably because Hammond was available. But then again, we\u2019ve repeatedly discussed the show\u2019s difficulties in the Trump era. The sheer amount of news the show wants to tackle is overwhelming, especially after a week off. Perhaps this is the best way to tackle it.\n\nAD", "description": "One of them, surprisingly, is Darrell Hammond as Bill Clinton.", "authors": ["Travis M.
