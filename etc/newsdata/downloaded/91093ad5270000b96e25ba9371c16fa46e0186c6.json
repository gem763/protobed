This freedom is the First Amendment of the Constitution for a reason and I will do all I can to stand up for it.\u201d\n\nGabbard has previously called out Silicon Valley for political censorship, even filing a lawsuit against tech giant Google over alleged censorship of her campaign ads. She has also called the dominance of big tech over public discourse a \u201cthreat to free speech, fair elections, and our democracy.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s statements have been more contradictory. While she has disagreed with Harris on Twitter banning Trump, and once condemned Facebook for its power to \u201cshut down debate\u201d after it removed an ad for her campaign in March this year, she has also called for Twitter to censor allegedly \u201cracist\u201d criticism of Kamala Harris.", "description": "Elizabeth Warren joined rival Democrat presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard in opposition to Kamala Harris' call for Twitter to ban President Trump's account.", "authors": ["Allum Bokhari"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/07/Kamala-Harris-Getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
