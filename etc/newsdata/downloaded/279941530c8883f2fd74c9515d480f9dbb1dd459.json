The president tweeted Saturday, it was a perfectly fine and respectful conversation. Do you think it\u2019s, quote, perfectly fine, to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political opponent?\u201d\n\nPOMPEO: \u201cI think I saw a statement from the Ukrainian foreign minister yesterday said there was no pressure applied in the course of the conversation. I do think \u2014 I do think if Vice President Biden behaved inappropriately, if he was protecting his son and intervened with the Ukrainian leadership in a way that was corrupt, I do think we need to get to the bottom of that, Martha and I -- I hope that we will. I hope that if Vice President Biden engaged in behavior that was inappropriate, I hope the American people will come to learn that. America can\u2019t have --\n\nRADDATZ: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen no evidence of that yet, but I want to go back to the question.\u201d POMPEO: \u201cAmerica cannot have our elections interfered with \u2014 America cannot have our elections interfered with. And if \u2014 if that\u2019s what took place there, if there was that kind of activity engaged in by Vice President Biden, we need to know.\n\nRADDATZ: \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of that yet, but if the conversation was perfectly fine, as President Trump said, why not release the transcript or a portion to the public?\u201d POMPEO: \u201cI\u2019ll have \u2014 the White House will have to explain. \u2026 We don\u2019t release transcripts very often. It\u2019s the \u2014 it\u2019s the rare case. Those are private conversations between world leaders and it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to do so except in -- in the most extreme circumstances. There\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s no \u2014 there\u2019s no evidence that that would be appropriate here at this point.\u201d\n\n-- CHUCK TODD spoke with Treasury Secretary STEVEN MNUCHIN on NBC\u2019S \u201cMEET THE PRESS\u201d: TODD: \u201cDo you know why the president hasn't gone to the FBI about these allegations?\u201d MNUCHIN: \u201cI don't but let me just say that I wasn't on this call but I've been on many calls with world leaders. So first of all, there are multiple people on these calls. I think it would be highly inappropriate to release a transcript of a call between two world leaders. And I think the bigger story here is really what went on with Biden and his son? He came out over the weekend and said he never spoke to his son. Yet the facts are his son said they had spoken.\u201d\n\n\n\nTODD: \u201cI don\u2019t understand how that \u2013 I don\u2019t understand how that has anything to with what\u2019s going on in \u2014 with this situation. Going back to what you just \u2014 why \u2014 if the president believes an American is committing \u2014 doing something wrong , why didn't he go to the FBI? Why is he outsourcing the investigation to the Ukrainian government?\u201d\n\nMNUCHIN: \u201cI don't know if \u2014 I wouldn't know if \u2014 I don't believe he did outsource the investigation. I wasn't on the call. And I don't know what conversations the president had \u2014 has had \u2014 with the Attorney General.

I, for one, find that to be concerning. And, to me, that is the issue perhaps that should be further investigated.\u201d TAPPER: \u201cI don't understand. So it is OK for Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump Jr. to do business all over the world, it's OK for Ivanka Trump to have copyrights approved all over the world while President Trump is president, but while Vice President Joe Biden was vice president, his son shouldn't have been able to do business dealings?\u201d\n\nMNUCHIN: \u201cAgain, I don't -- I don't really want to go into more of these details, other than to say\u2026\u201d TAPPER: \u201cWell, you're just setting a precedent that the president is violating. MNUCHIN: \u201cAgain, I think there is a significant difference in what you're saying, OK, or what I was saying between Biden and his son's relationship with the Ukraine oligarch and potential business dealings that the Trump Organization has had which predated his presidency.\u201d\n\nGIULIANI RESPONDS \u2026 JOHN ROBERTS interviewed RUDY GIULIANI on FOX NEWS\u2019 \u201cFOX NEWS SUNDAY\u201d: \u201cGiuliani charges 'this town protects Joe Biden',\u201d by Eleanor Mueller: \u201cPresident Donald Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, charged on Sunday that \u2018this town protects Joe Biden.\u2019 \u2018His family has been taking money from his public office for years,\u2019 Giuliani asserted in an animated interview on \u2018Fox News Sunday.\u2019 \u2018Ladies and gentlemen, go look at what the press has been covering up.\u2019 ...\n\n\u201c\u2018I went there to get dirt on Joe Biden,\u2019 Giuliani said. \u2018I got a nice straight case of Ukrainian collusion, and the minute I say 'Biden' the Washington press corps is going to go nuts.

Iran doesn\u2019t seem confident.\u201d POMPEO: \u201cOur administration\u2019s taking this on in a serious way and we are working diligently to see that this has a diplomatic outcome. But make no mistake about it, if we\u2019re unsuccessful in that and Iran continues to strike out in this way, I am confident that President Trump will make the decisions necessary to achieve our objectives.\u201d\n\n-- POMPEO on \u201cFOX NEWS SUNDAY,\u201d via Eleanor Mueller: \u201c\u2018Our mission set is to avoid war. That's the task in front of us \u2026 That's what we've been aiming for for a little over two years now, with the strongest sanctions that have ever been put in place against this revolutionary regime.\"\u2019\u201d The clip\n\n-- MARGARET BRENNAN spoke with POMPEO on CBS NEWS\u2019 \u201cFACE THE NATION\u201d: BRENNAN: \u201cLiz Cheney, Lindsey Graham, Republican allies of the president have said the failure to carry out some kind of obvious retaliation or a military strike looks like weakness.\u201d POMPEO: \u201cThis is not about weakness. This strategy is working. \u2026 We're at the beginning of that sanctions campaign, but I- I don't think anyone should mistake President Trump for having the resolve to make sure we get this right and when the moment calls for it I am confident the president will take all appropriate actions.\u201d\n\nBRENNAN: \u201cBut I- I guess, fundamentally, the question is why do you think sanctions will be preventative and not just punitive? Why do you think making Iran more desperate will get them to act more responsible?\u201d\n\nPOMPEO: \u201cIt\u2019ll deny them the resources to foment the exact kind of strikes that we have seen over this past summer. It will deny them the money, the wealth, the resources. They're operating today in five countries. It's expensive. They've already had to make difficult decisions about whether they're going to feed their people, provide medicine to their people or they're going to launch missiles into Saudi Arabia.\n\n\u201cI am convinced that the Iranian people see those choices being made. And as time goes on they will continue to see that those conditions worsen and they'll demand- they'll demand that their leadership not bring their brothers and sisters back home in body bags, but rather use those resources. The- the- the Iranian people are great people. We- we stand with them and I am- I\u2019m confident they will demand that their leadership behave in a way that reflects the great history of this place.\u201d\n\n-- BEHIND THE SCENES: \u201cAn Abrupt Move That Stunned Aides: Inside Trump\u2019s Aborted Attack on Iran,\u201d by NYT\u2019s Peter Baker, Eric Schmitt and Michael Crowley\n\nNEW POLL -- WARREN RISING: \u201cElizabeth Warren leads Register\u2019s Iowa Poll for the first time, besting Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders,\u201d by Des Moines Register\u2019s Brianne Pfannenstiel: \u201cElizabeth Warren has surged in Iowa, narrowly overtaking Joe Biden and distancing herself from fellow progressive Bernie Sanders, the latest Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows.\n\n\u201cWarren, the U.S. senator from Massachusetts, now holds a 2-percentage-point lead, with 22% of likely Democratic caucus-goers saying she is their first choice for president. It is the first time she has led in the Register\u2019s poll.\n\nFormer Vice President Biden, who had led each of the Register\u2019s three previous 2020 cycle polls, follows her at 20%. Sanders, the U.S. senator from Vermont, has fallen to third place with 11%. No other candidate reaches double digits.\u201d Des Moines Register\n\nJOE BIDEN on TRUMP last night at a fundraiser in Iowa, per pooler Stephen Gruber-Miller of the Des Moines Register: \u201cThe more he thinks he\u2019s likely to lose the more erratic he becomes and the more things he does that are worrisome. We have at least another year and a half of this man and it\u2019s going to be, we\u2019ve just got to, as my mother would say, keep our fingers crossed, because the truth of the matter is I\u2019m very worried about how erratic he\u2019s become and the things he does and the things he says.\u201d\n\n-- A PROMISE THAT HE CAN KEEP?

Trump will speak to an expected crowd of 50,000, mostly Indian Americans, who are flocking to the most diverse city in the nation to catch a glimpse of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at what is being touted as the largest event in the U.S. for a leader of foreign country.\n\n\u201cHe hopes to peel off some Indian American voters who could be attracted to his business friendly agenda, especially the 2017 tax cuts, his tough talk on terrorism and his decision to show up at the rally even though the ethnic group has generally backed Democrats.\u201d POLITICO\n\nPLAYBOOK READS\n\nPHOTO DU JOUR: French riot police walk through a tear gas cloud during a yellow vest demonstration \u2014 with a few hundred anti-government protesters \u2014 in Paris on Saturday. | Kamil Zihnioglu/AP Photo\n\n2020 WATCH -- ELENA SCHNEIDER: \u201cChasten Buttigieg goes from opening act to fundraising star\u201d: \u201cChasten Buttigieg has gone viral on social media and supported his husband on the presidential campaign trail. Now, he\u2019s playing a new role for Pete Buttigieg\u2019s 2020 bid: rainmaker.\n\n\u201cChasten is slated to be the sole headline draw for several Pete for America fundraisers over the next month, starting with an event in Chicago this week. In October, Chasten will swing through New York City for another fundraiser, followed by a trip overseas to raise money from Americans living abroad in London on Oct. 22, according to event invitations obtained by POLITICO.\n\n\u201cChasten is also striking out on his own for other events, like a ribbon-cutting for a dozen new field offices in New Hampshire earlier this month, while Pete did the same for 20 offices in Iowa. The split-screen events show Chasten \u2014 a 30-year-old teacher who was nearly anonymous at the beginning of 2019 \u2014 cutting a campaign profile more akin to well-known former second lady Jill Biden than most 2020 spouses. And that prominence could be a force-multiplier for the Buttigieg campaign through the fall, keeping the fundraising spigot open while Pete stumps in all-important Iowa and New Hampshire.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- NEW POLL: \u201cU.S. Voters Support Expanding Medicare but Not Eliminating Private Health Insurance,\u201d by WSJ\u2019s John McCormick: \u201cDemocratic presidential candidates are presenting policy ideas that are broadly popular with Americans, including tuition-free state colleges, but other proposals\u2014such as Medicare for All\u2014could complicate the party\u2019s prospects next year, the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows.\n\n\u201cTwo-thirds of registered voters support letting anyone buy into Medicare, similar to an idea that former Vice President Joe Biden and some other Democratic candidates have proposed. Two-thirds say that young adults brought to the U.S. illegally should be allowed to stay, an idea broadly supported by the party\u2019s presidential field. Nearly 60% of registered voters support making tuition free at state colleges and universities.\n\n\u201cBut several other ideas backed by majorities of Democratic voters and some of the party\u2019s 2020 candidates draw significant opposition from the electorate overall, the new poll finds.\n\nSome 56% of registered voters oppose a Medicare for All plan that would replace private insurance, as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and some others have proposed, while 57% oppose the idea of immediately canceling student-loan debt for all borrowers. Mr. Sanders also has proposed the latter, while Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren backs it with limits.\u201d WSJ\n\nBEYOND THE BELTWAY -- BURGESS EVERETT and MELANIE ZANONA: \u201cBad blood: Rand Paul moves to thwart a Liz Cheney Senate run\u201d: \u201cRand Paul began his offensive against Liz Cheney as soon as a Senate seat opened up in May, reigniting a years-long feud between their families and warring wings of the Republican Party. The Kentucky GOP senator quickly made contact with Cynthia Lummis, a former conservative House member, to encourage her to run for the Senate seat opening up in Wyoming now that Mike Enzi was retiring.\n\n\u201cLummis soon jumped into the race, leaving Cheney, her successor in Congress, with a tough choice: Embark on a brutal primary against Lummis or take the safer route and seek her fortune in House leadership.\n\n\u201cThat was only the beginning of Paul\u2019s slugfest with Cheney, one that included a fierce back and forth over Twitter on foreign policy, dueling Sunday show appearances and a highly unusual phone call from Paul into a Casper, Wyo., TV station to assert that Wyoming Republicans are \u2018tired\u2019 of Cheney\u2019s support for nation-building abroad.\u201d POLITICO\n\n-- \u201cDemocrats grapple for open Congressional seat in the Bronx,\u201d by Erin Durkin in New York: \u201cRuben Diaz Sr.\u2019s enemies call him a homophobic egomaniac \u2014 more of a mini-Trump than a Democrat.
