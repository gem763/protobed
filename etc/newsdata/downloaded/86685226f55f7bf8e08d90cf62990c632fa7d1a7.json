It argued that if the HRC recommendations were simply adopted, as the Chapter 9 institution had recommended, it wouldn't have been necessary to question that part of the law.\n\nThis approach wasn't successful in the labour court, but Van Der Bijl says that this only means that a more difficult battle lies ahead, in a higher court.", "description": "The union Solidarity has failed in its court case to force government to change its affirmative action polices.", "authors": ["William Horne"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8453/e151e1449e054d778bbb53fa77983d12.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
