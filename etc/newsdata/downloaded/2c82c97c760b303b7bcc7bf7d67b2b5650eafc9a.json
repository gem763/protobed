It\u2019s a layered question, one every candidate is eager to take a swing at. Sensing as much, the achromatic CNN anchor assures Warren\u2019s neighbors onstage they\u2019ll get a chance. \u201cYou\u2019re all going to get in on this,\u201d Cooper says.\n\nNearly 700 miles away, seated at a faux mahogany table inside Room 209 of the Embassy Suites in downtown Des Moines, one viewer struggles to suppress his frustration. \u201cOh, that\u2019s good to know,\u201d Michael Bennet says, his cheeks stuffed with pizza, slapping the table as he addresses Cooper\u2019s image on the television 10 feet away. \u201cWe\u2019re all going to get in on this.\u201d\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe Westerville gathering features a record-setting swarm of candidates\u201412\u2014but Bennet, a Colorado senator, is not one of them. Lagging far behind his primary opponents in fundraising and struggling to break 1 percent in most national and state polls, Bennet failed to meet the criteria set by the Democratic National Committee to qualify for a podium. So, instead of standing before the cameras and speaking to an audience of millions around the world, Bennet is sitting with me, munching on Fong\u2019s street taco pizza, sipping a Lagunitas IPA from the bottle and wondering why Beto O\u2019Rourke belongs onstage and he doesn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re tied, you know,\u201d Bennet says, nodding toward the former Texas congressman. He flashes a grin. \u201cOr at least within the margin of error.\u201d\n\nTim Alberta\n\nBennet\u2019s failure to earn entr\u00e9e to the event owes mainly to his manifest limitations as a candidate. He scarcely exudes charisma. He struggles to hit rhetorical high notes. He does not look or dress the part of a presidential contender.\n\nAt the same time, Bennet\u2019s absence from the limelight Tuesday evening\u2014and those very weaknesses that are to blame\u2014reflects an alarming truth about the state of modern politics.\n\nIt\u2019s true Bennet will never make a crowd swoon or send chills down an Iowa caucusgoer\u2019s spine. It\u2019s also true he would probably make a fine president. In the decade he has served in the U.S. Senate, Bennet has earned the reputation of a sober-minded, results-oriented workhorse, someone who is smart and studied and reliably well-prepared. The 54-year-old former school superintendent is a liberal\u2014there is no questioning this among his peers\u2014but wherever there is a battle being waged, whether over immigration or gun control or climate change, Bennet can be found in the deal-making trenches, laboring to build a bipartisan coalition in pursuit of a workable outcome rather than lobbing bombs from the safety of an ideological bunker.\n\nThe instincts that guide Bennet\u2014being pragmatic, deliberative, restrained\u2014are what many Americans say are precisely what\u2019s needed to run the White House. But now, perhaps more than ever, those instincts are the opposite of what\u2019s needed to win the White House. Once upon a time, there was a limited return on investing in outrage and demagoguery; statesmen were in high demand no matter the supply. That\u2019s no longer the case, and not simply because a celebrity showman named Donald Trump is president of the United States. The painful reality of this political moment slides over Bennet like a barbed-wire blanket as he flops onto the couch and kicks off his faded brown dress shoes, preparing for a three-hour reality-television show that will help determine who leads the free world.\n\nAll the more irksome to Bennet is the fact that five of his fellow senators are staring back at him from beneath the bright lights; he is the only member of the \"world\u2019s greatest deliberative body\" seeking a promotion who is excluded from the festivities. Not only that, but the one whose brand of campaigning disturbs him the most\u2014Warren, a Massachusetts populist\u2014is continuing to evade questions about how she would pay for a \"Medicare for All\" program estimated to cost tens of trillions of dollars. Bennet predicted this would happen, and now, leaning forward in his seat, he shakes his head at Warren\u2019s refusal to acknowledge her intent to raise taxes on working- and middle-class Americans. \u201cAt least Bernie\u2019s been honest about it,\u201d Bennet says. \"The general election is too late for us to find out how Elizabeth is going to pay for these things.\"\n\nAt one point, when pressed by the moderators to give a yes-or-no answer to that question, Warren dodges yet again\u2014and Bennet lets escape an audible groan. The Massachusetts senator says she knows what voters care about, having hosted scores of town hall meetings, visited 27 states and taken 70,000 selfies, \u201cwhich must be the new measure of democracy,\u201d she quips.\n\nBennet falls back into the couch. \u201cI hope not,\u201d he sighs.\n\nA little while later, as the debate goes to its first commercial break, Bennet stands up and wanders over to the door. \u201cLet\u2019s see if the people downstairs are watching,\u201d he says, turning the handle and stepping out to the balcony. The senator glances one floor down to the open atrium of the hotel, where a large crowd is gathered, drinks in hand, staring up at a massive television screen. \u201cBaseball,\u201d Bennet says, pumping a fist.\n\nBut what if they were watching? What would be their takeaway from the first hour? What is Bennet\u2019s takeaway, as a voter and as a presidential candidate?\n\nHe sits down and thinks, taking more than 30 seconds to ponder. Finally, he shrugs. \u201cMore taxes.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t get it,\u201d Bennet says, arching an eyebrow. \u201cWhy is this her \u2026 thing?\u201d\n\nNow he\u2019s talking about Tulsi Gabbard, the Hawaii congresswoman whose support for Syrian dictator Bashar Assad continues to be a source of curiosity within the Democratic Party. She is denouncing the presence of American troops in the Middle East and blaming the U.S. for its part in a supposed \u201cregime-change war\u201d in Syria. Bennet cannot fathom Gabbard\u2019s position, nor can he understand the appeal she holds with whatever thin slice of the primary electorate propelled her onto Tuesday night\u2019s stage.\n\n\u201cHow much does it piss you off,\u201d I ask, \u201cthat she\u2019s onstage and you\u2019re sitting here with me?\u201d\n\nHe forces a smile. \u201cI just miss Marianne Williamson.\u201d\n\nIndeed, with the self-help guru sidelined from Tuesday\u2019s event, the designation of strangest participant belongs to Tom Steyer, the billionaire activist who effectively bought his way into the event and made no real impression other than to leave Twitter talking about his Christmas-choir necktie. At one point, when Steyer uses the phrase \u201cfrenemies\u201d in discussing U.S. foreign policy, Bennet glances from side to side, as if to make sure we had heard the same thing, then puts on his glasses and burrows into his iPhone, muttering something indiscernible.\n\nAnd then there is O\u2019Rourke. It doesn\u2019t seem the Colorado senator has anything personal against the former Texas congressman; it\u2019s just that Bennet, like many Democrats, is annoyed with what they see as O\u2019Rourke\u2019s habit of staking out irrational policy positions for the sake of going viral, saddling the party and its eventual nominee with baggage that won\u2019t easily be shed. The most recent example was O\u2019Rourke pledging at an LGBTQ forum to strip the tax-exempt status of churches that refuse to marry same-sex couples, a flagrantly unconstitutional idea with the potential to alienate white conservatives and black liberals alike. But Bennet is still hung up on O\u2019Rourke\u2019s line from the last presidential debate: \u201cHell yes, we are going to take your AR-15, your AK-47.\u201d\n\nA few days after that debate, Bennet recalls, he was meeting with a group of blue-collar labor Democrats in New Hampshire. The group\u2019s leader asked him, \u201cWhy are you talking about taking our guns?\u201d When Bennet responded it was just one person, the man pushed back. Because nobody else on the stage challenged O\u2019Rourke, the man said, they were perceived as agreeing with his stance. Bennet walked away from the exchange dazed and deeply concerned.\n\nThe irony is, Bennet isn\u2019t a moderate on guns. He supports an assault-weapons ban and wants to outlaw high-capacity magazines. Coming from \u201ca Western, pro-Second Amendment state\u201d that implemented extensive gun-control measures after the mass shootings in Columbine and Aurora, Bennet believes there is a blueprint for the federal government to follow. But it requires building broad consensus and winning incremental battles, he says, starting with universal background checks, taking the long view of a problem that won\u2019t be solved with sound bites or campaign slogans.\n\nLooking on as Pete Buttigieg clashes with O\u2019Rourke over this very topic, Bennet says he sides with the South Bend, Indiana, mayor. \u201cI\u2019m not saying, Don\u2019t think about the big things,'\u201d Bennet explains. \u201cBut we\u2019ve got to focus on what we can do first.\u201d\n\nThe discussion surrounding guns, Bennet fears, is symptomatic of a broader illness in today\u2019s political climate. \u201cThis is becoming a competition to out-do each other in the Twitterverse, instead of actually addressing the problem,\u201d he says. Noting how he\u2019s held 10 years\u2019 worth of town hall meetings and talked with thousands of gun-control activists, he says \u201c90 percent of them\u201d are focused on passing universal background checks\u2014a readily attainable goal that has enormous public support. But now, because of the confiscation talk, \u201cTrump can just say, \u2018They\u2019re all going to take your guns away,\u2019\u201d Bennet says, turning the discussion into a zero-sum game. \u201cAnd the labor guys in Iowa and New Hampshire, that\u2019s what they say. I just heard the same thing in Reno: \u2018You\u2019re going to take our guns away.\u2019\u201d\n\nThis, Bennet fears, is how Trump might luck into a second term. Oh, sure, the president will continue to scare moderates and independents with his erratic behavior. But Bennet wonders if Democrats might scare them even more\u2014what with talk of seizing guns, banning fracking, guaranteeing health coverage to undocumented immigrants, raising taxes across the board, imposing political litmus tests on churches, and of course, eliminating private insurance for more than 150 million people.\n\n\u201cJust listen to this debate,\u201d Bennet says, motioning toward the television. \u201cMedicare for All shouldn\u2019t even have made it to the debate stage. I mean, we\u2019re a free country, and that\u2019s fine. But of the Democrats who won in 2018, in those suburban districts, all but one person won their primary running on the public option\u2014against candidates who supported Medicare for All. I understand this has been Bernie\u2019s thing forever. But for some of the leading candidates to sign on to his bill gave it legitimacy. It\u2019s just\u2026\u201d\n\nHe drifts off, shaking his head.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to pick a policy we can\u2019t even unify Democrats around, much less bring in others who could support it from the outside. Which means we\u2019ll wind up fighting a losing battle for that instead of achieving the other stuff,\u201d Bennet adds. \"That\u2019s not catering to the people I talk to at town halls; it\u2019s for the people on Twitter and the people on cable news at night.\u201d\n\nAs the debate approaches the two-hour mark, Bennet goes silent, gazing emotionlessly at the television for a prolonged stretch. Finally, I ask what\u2019s on his mind. \u201cI\u2019m sitting here thinking, 'Who can beat Trump?'\u201d he says. \u201cCan any of these people beat Trump?\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nWhat gets under Bennet\u2019s skin, as he watches the debate unfold, is how Warren and Sanders implicitly cast their rivals as timid or beholden to the status quo because of fundamental policy disagreements. It\u2019s a running theme of the 2020 primary competition, and for the first time Tuesday, several of the candidates, such as Buttigieg and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, push back forcefully.\n\nBennet was glad to see it\u2014not just because he is a centrist at heart, but because he has grown suspicious of the business model associated with ideological purity. \u201cI\u2019m not sure this is about progressive vs. nonprogressive,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s about what will satisfy the social media interests on a given day.\u201d\n\nWhat does that mean? Do some of the Democrats not really believe what they\u2019re proposing?\n\nHe opens another IPA and takes a swig. \u201cIf someone is proposing free college, which is a regressive policy, or debt forgiveness, which is a regressive policy\u2014.\u201d He stops and shakes his head. \u201cI mean, single-payer, that\u2019s been a progressive view forever. But now it\u2019s embodied by Bernie\u2019s very particular Medicare for All, which is an actual legislative proposal that has become the emblem for whether you\u2019re woke or not woke, or progressive or not progressive during this primary.\u201d\n\nHe continues, \u201cThe equities that are being satisfied are the responses that you get on social media and your ability to raise money on the internet. And that has led to people offering up policies that\u2014.\u201d He stops himself again. \u201cYou know, when Obama ran in 2008, there was an outer edge, because that political market could only bear so much. But this political Twitter market can never bear too much; the more extreme you are, the more rewarded you are.\u201d\n\nWhen I mention the cautionary tale of what has become of the modern Republican Party, Bennet acknowledges the parallels. But he sees one key difference. \u201cTrump and McConnell don\u2019t need a functioning democracy to achieve what they\u2019re trying to achieve. Trump doesn\u2019t care whether he has a functioning democracy or not, and McConnell doesn\u2019t need one because it\u2019s all about putting judges on the courts,\u201d the senator says. \u201cBut if you actually want to fix the health care system, or deal with climate, or do the other things we want to do, you have to have a durable coalition of people that support you. \u2026 There\u2019s been a complete breakdown in our exercise in self-governance. And that has created a vacuum into which the anti-government impulses of the country have flown, and now, the overpromising impulses have flown.\u201d\n\nBennet says it wasn\u2019t always this way. Reaching for the book he authored, \u201cThe Land of Flickering Lights,\u201d he shares a passage describing how President Ronald Reagan worked with Democrats to pass critical bipartisan legislation and fortify the public\u2019s confidence in government. He doesn\u2019t seem to recognize the irony of giving a long, academic recitation\u2014reading from a book, glasses over his nose\u2014after acknowledging the political imperative of going viral.\n\nWhat Bennet finds himself wondering these days is whether Democrats can win\u2014much less govern\u2014by pledging to do merely the possible. Whether they will be rewarded for telling voters what they need to hear, instead of what they want to hear.\n\n\u201cBarack Obama tried to do that, and that\u2019s not ancient history,\u201d Bennet says hopefully.\n\nIsn\u2019t it?\n\nHe thinks for a moment, then practically leaps from his seat, as though a light bulb hasn\u2019t merely gone off but overheated and shattered inside of his brain. \u201cMaybe it is. Maybe it is. Maybe it is. Because Barack Obama tried to do that, and he was rewarded with complete intransigence by the other side. He used to say when he was running for reelection that \u2018the fever will break\u2019 after he won reelection. But the fever has never broken. Not only has it not broken, Trump\u2019s now in charge,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the real question for our democracy is, can our exercise in pluralism really continue under these circumstances?\u201d\n\nBennet swears he\u2019s an optimist; it\u2019s what gets him out of bed in the morning. But as our conversation progresses, with the debate flickering toward its closing minutes, the senator sounds as pessimistic as any politician I\u2019ve spoken with in the Trump era.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been terribly careless without democracy. I believe that Donald Trump could not get hired in almost any business in America\u2014the HR implications alone would be enough not to hire him, not to mention you couldn\u2019t listen to him all day long if you were at an insurance company or a loading dock. Like, \u2018This fucking guy!\u2019\u201d Bennet sighs, throwing up his hands. \u201cThe only way he could get elected is we have sufficiently degraded view of our political institutions that we\u2019re willing to put a guy in charge who we would never put in charge of anything else. And why? Because we want to blow the place up. And the conversations I have with people who voted for Trump is, \u2018Congratulations, you achieved your objective. Now what?\u2019\u201d\n\nBennet glances at the television. His Democratic peers are entertaining the question of whether they would consider packing the Supreme Court. \u201cAnd this is making it worse!\u201d he growls, wagging a finger at the monitor.\n\nJust then, right on cue, Cooper asks the candidates about the emerging divide in the party\u2014on questions of ideology, but also of tactics. Former Vice President Joe Biden takes the opportunity to criticize the progressives flanking him, Sanders and Warren, singling out the latter for being \u201cvague\u201d about her plans. Bennet nods along in agreement. But he also winces during the remarks, as he has several times earlier in the night, an apparent reaction to Biden\u2019s choppy and stilted speech pattern. It\u2019s clear Bennet aligns himself with Biden on a great many issues. But it\u2019s also clear Bennet, and at least a few others in the center-left space, wouldn\u2019t be running if Biden were regarded as an imposing political force at 76 years old.\n\nResponding to Biden\u2019s critique of the left\u2019s ability to defeat Trump, Sanders argued the 2020 election would be won by bringing in new voters. Bennet cannot stomach this assertion. \u201cBut do you bring them in with false promises?\u201d he asks. \u201cIs there another way of exciting people and getting them involved besides making false promises? I don\u2019t know. But when you do make false promises, and they never get accomplished, it just breeds more cynicism. That\u2019s how we got here.\u201d\n\nBennet is growing more impatient. His dark hair, once neatly combed to the side, is frayed from his hands running through it; his pale blue shirt, once crisply ironed, is disheveled and mostly untucked. Finishing his beer and walking over to the door, Bennet glances down at the crowd and the big screen. \u201cStill baseball,\u201d he smiles.\n\n\n\n***\n\nSurely, there is every temptation to quit\u2014to get back to Colorado, to sleep in his own bed, to spend more time with his family, to stop slogging from one small town to another, meeting with crowds of 10 or 20 in hopes of planting a seed that might sprout months later under the most unlikely of conditions.\n\nEvery politician has an ego; Bennet is no exception. Still, for the U.S. senator who refused to be photographed for the cover of his own book\u2014surely a first in the annals of presidential campaigning\u2014it seems there\u2019s more at stake than personal vanity. Bennet is convincing when he says he\u2019s genuinely concerned. It\u2019s not simply about a country that\u2019s losing its way, he says, but about a party that might snatch defeat from the jaws of victory in 2020.\n\n\u201cThe people who have promised to deliver undeliverable things have had the jump on the rest of us. But the people in Iowa and New Hampshire, I think, are trying to figure out one thing, which is: How do we beat Donald Trump?\u201d Bennet says. \u201cThat\u2019s the question they\u2019re trying to answer. And if I can hang in there long enough, and there\u2019s change at the top of this field, there may be an opportunity to say, \u2018Here I am.\u2019\u201d\n\nBennet knows he may never get the opportunity. But if he does\u2014if things break just right, if Biden falters and neither Buttigieg nor Klobuchar nor any of the other moderates coalesce the support of the center-left\u2014it would present the starkest of contrasts. Sure, on the substance, Warren or Sanders would represent the sharpest possible departure from the incumbent. But as a matter of style, of tone and of temperament, it\u2019s fair to say Bennet is the antithesis of Trump. Making that argument might be his last best hope\u2014assuming he can refine it.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s incredible,\u201d Bennet says of the president. \u201cHe\u2019s got, \u2018Build the wall.\u2019 He\u2019s got, \u2018Lock her up.\u2019 He\u2019s got, \u2018Make America Great Again.\u2019 He\u2019s got, \u2018Drain the swamp.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat about Bennet?\n\nHe shrugs, staring ahead. \u201cI got nothing.\u201d\n\nThis article tagged under: Michael Bennet\n\n2020", "description": "Watching the Democratic debate with a serious candidate who wasn\u2019t invited to the party, and can hardly believe what\u2019s unfolding before his eyes.", "authors": ["Tim Alberta"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/6f/8e/36e4a74a493ab94ea1448ac91a11/gettyimages-1150137748.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
