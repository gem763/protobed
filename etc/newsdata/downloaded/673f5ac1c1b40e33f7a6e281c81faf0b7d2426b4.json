A group of Senate Democrats are demanding the FBI and Securities Exchange Commission probe a series of trade made just before key Trump moves or statements on trade\n\nTrading patterns: Vanity Fair published an article Thursday highlighting 'fishy' electronic trading - sometimes in the closing minutes of a session - in S&P 500 futures contracts. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which monitors S&P futures contract trading, dismissed the story as 'patently false.'\n\nThe issue surfaced after Vanity Fair published an article Thursday highlighting 'fishy' electronic trading - sometimes in the closing minutes of a session - in S&P 500 futures contracts.\n\nThe Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which monitors S&P futures contract trading, dismissed the story as 'patently false.'\n\nIn several incidents in recent months, the magazine said, someone either bought or short-sold massive amounts of so-called e-minis shortly before Trump made key remarks, such as about China trade negotiations, or ahead of vital moves by the administration.\n\nThe profits enjoyed by those trades were so quick and stunning as to raise questions about whether people behind the trades had inside information about what Trump might say or do, Vanity Fair reported.\n\nOne such move involved a 30-point gain in the S&P 500 index on Sept. 11th, the day Trump announced he would postpone some tariffs amid the ongoing trade war with China.\n\nThat same day, an investor or investors purchased contracts known as e-minis that jumped in value by $190 million based on Trump's comments and word from Beijing, an analysis by Vanity Fair found in an examination of several trades that earned immediate massive pay-days that were triggered by political events.\n\nDuring his trip to Osaka in June, President Trump declared U.S.-China talks 'back on track' and announced unspecified Chinese purchases of agriculture products.\n\nThe broad stock market then experienced a boomlet that was particularly beneficial to the person or group who made a June 28 of buy 420,000 e-minis, an electronically traded futures contract.\n\nThe purchases were put in 30 minutes before trading closed in Chicago markets. By about a week later, the person's investment had gained in value by $1.8 billion.\n\nReporter William Cohan, a former trader, reports that Chicago traders have been watching such transactions with 'shock and awe,' and that their timing \u2013 coupled with the huge earnings that accompanied them \u2013 has caused traders to wonder whether things are 'on the level.'\n\n'Are the people behind these trades incredibly lucky, or do they have access to information that other people don't have about, say, Trump's or Beijing's latest thinking on the trade war or any other of a number of ways that Trump is able to move the markets through his tweeting or slips of the tongue? Essentially, do they have inside information?' he wrote.\n\nDuring his trip to Osaka in June, President Trump declared U.S.-China talks 'back on track' and announced unspecified Chinese purchases of agriculture products. The broad stock market then experienced a boomlet that was particularly beneficial to the personal or group who made a June 28 buy 420,000 e-minis, an electronically traded futures contract.\n\nInvestors earned a $180 million profit by buying futures contracts 10 minutes before the close of trading before the attack on Saudi oil infrastructure\n\nThe futures trades were made at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where regulators have the ability to monitor any suspicious market moves.\n\nAlthough the Vanity Fair piece does not level accusations at any particular insider, it points to the 'fantastically profitable mystery of the Trump chaos trades' in a sub-headline.\n\nTrump regularly talks up the stock market and has bragged during key milestones. At the same time, he doesn't shy from brash rhetoric, such as threatening in a letter to Turkey's president that he didn't want to be responsible for 'destroying the Turkish economy.'\n\nTrump infamously told reporters in August that 'we've gotten two calls\u2014very, very good calls' from Chinese officials, during a time of high trade tensions. The White House late said Trump misspoke and conflated events to include public comments Chinese Vice Premier Liu He.\n\nIn one trade, investors made a $180 million profit by buying futures contracts 10 minutes before the close of trading before the attack on Saudi oil infrastructure.\n\nAnother trade the story examines is when someone bought 55,000 e-mini contracts Sept. 3. Soon after, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced she was pulling back the controversial extradition bill that had led to angry street protests. The purchaser made an $82.5 million profit, according to the article.", "description": "In a letter to AG Bill Barr, the FBI chief and the SEC, 14 senators expressed concern about reports of 'suspicious trading' on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange just ahead of Trump remarks or actions.", "authors": ["Geoff Earle", "Deputy U.S. Political Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/22/17/20044062-0-image-a-6_1571760434401.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
