McConnell and Blunt. You\u2019re the ones who need to step up.", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cThe president needs to step up here and set some guidelines for what he would do,\u201d Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d The subject was gun control, and the choice of words was a bit ironic \u2014 if not pathetic. Everyone knows by now that President Trump will never step up on this issue \u2014 or that, if he steps up one day, he will step down the next. Hiding behind his failure is a way for Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), Mr. Blunt and other Republican senators to abdicate their legislative authority and their responsibility to the country.\n\nMore than 300 million people live in the United States. They\u2019ve elected just 100 among them to be U.S. senators. So, senators, stop waiting for Mr. Trump. Stop making excuses. Tell us what you think policy should be. Do your job.\n\nThe House has passed bipartisan gun legislation that includes expanding federal background checks. A new Post-ABC News Poll shows overwhelming support for the reform, across party and demographic lines. House Democratic leaders say they hope to pass additional reforms, including a ban on assault weapons. Taking weapons of war off the streets makes sense to us. If senators think otherwise, okay, make the case.\n\nInstead, Mr. McConnell simply refuses to act until Mr. Trump comes to a decision on what type of bill he would support. This, as he and Mr. Blunt well know, is a fool\u2019s game. After last year\u2019s mass shooting at a high school in Parkland, Fla., Mr. Trump promised teachers and students, \u201cWe\u2019re going to be very strong on background checks.\u201d He taunted a roomful of lawmakers for being scared of the National Rifle Association. Then he caved to the NRA and threatened a veto when the House passed legislation that would require universal background checks. After this summer\u2019s back-to-back mass shootings in Texas and Ohio, Mr. Trump again boasted about the \u201cgreat appetite\u201d for tightening background checks. One phone call from NRA chief executive Wayne LaPierre, and his appetite had wilted again.\n\n\u201cSomeone in the Republican Party has to take the lead on this,\u201d Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R) said Friday as he announced his support for a gun control measure in defiance of the national gun lobby. Mr. Patrick, a conservative who has received an A-plus rating from the NRA, said he is \u201cwilling to take an arrow\u201d from the NRA to change Texas law to include private gun sales in background checks. Mr. Patrick\u2019s change of heart came less than a week after seven people were killed and at least 21 more injured in Odessa by a gunman who obtained an assault rifle from a private seller after he failed a background check because of a mental-health issue.\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m a solid NRA guy,\u201d Mr. Patrick told the Dallas Morning News, \u201cbut not expanding the background check to eliminate the stranger to stranger sale makes no sense to me and . . . most folks.\u201d\n\nIs he right or wrong, senators? Tell us what you think. If you disagree, tell us why. If you agree, pass a bill. Then Mr. Trump can step up and sign it or veto it.
