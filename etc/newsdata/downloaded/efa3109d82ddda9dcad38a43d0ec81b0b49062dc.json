One of the things we train on is to dispel inaccurate rumors and ultimately that is what was occurring \u2014 ultimately what the Alabama office did is provide a forecast with their tweet, that is what they get paid to do.\"\n\nSome federal weather workers feel betrayed that the NOAA sided with Trump and undercut their own scientists\n\nPresident Donald Trump holds a chart as he talks with reporters after receiving a briefing on Hurricane Dorian in the Oval Office of the White House, Wednesday, Sept. 4, 2019, in Washington.

Never before has their management undercut their scientifically sound reasoning and forecasts.\"\n\nAn NWS spokesperson told The Post that the September 1 directive to staff was sent \"so they (and the entire agency) could maintain operational focus on Dorian and other severe weather hazards without distraction.\"\n\nThe Post also quoted an NOAA official familiar with the matter who said the memo had \"no political motivation\" behind it.", "description": "The new development comes amid a days-long controversy over Trump's insistence that Hurricane Dorian was forecast to strike Alabama.", "authors": ["Michelle Mark"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d74739d2e22af47d66068e2-1920-960.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
