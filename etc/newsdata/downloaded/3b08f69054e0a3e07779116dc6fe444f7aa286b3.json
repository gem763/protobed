Out of that we\u2019ve changed six decisions. We think we should have changed 10 in total,\u201d Riley told Sky Sports News on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThat gives you the scale of where VAR can help and add value to the game, but it also demonstrates that this is still about refereeing a game of Premier League football on the pitch.\u201d\n\nVAR\u2019s guidelines state that the technology should only be used to overturn a decision if the on-pitch referee has made a clear and obvious error.\n\nRiley explained that the technology should have been used to award reigning champions Manchester City a penalty in their 3-1 win at Bournemouth and give a spot-kick to West Ham United in their 2-0 victory at home to Norwich City.\n\nHe also said Fabian Schar\u2019s goal for Newcastle United in the 1-1 draw with Watford should have been chalked off for an earlier handball, while Leicester City\u2019s Youri Tielemans should have been sent off in their 3-1 win over Bournemouth.\n\nEngland\u2019s top flight joined Germany, Spain and Italy in bringing in video technology at the start of the campaign and it has played a decisive role in the opening four rounds of games.\n\nManchester City had an added-time strike in their 2-2 draw at home to Tottenham Hotspur ruled out for a handball by Aymeric Laporte which no-one on the pitch had spotted.\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers also had a goal ruled out for handball in their 0-0 draw with Leicester on the opening day after a lengthy review, prompting coach Nuno Espirito Santo to say the technology was hurting the sport\u2019s spirit.", "description": "The introduction of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) has been unable to prevent four wrong decisions in the Premier League matches this season, referees' chief Mike Riley has said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190912&t=2&i=1429195476&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8B1ZB", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
