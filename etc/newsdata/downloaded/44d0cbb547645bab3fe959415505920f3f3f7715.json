It strains their very idea of America itself.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cWe still have to work to do,\u201d Faiz Shakir, Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, told POLITICO. \u201cAmongst the Democratic primary electorate, in some pockets, there\u2019s fear of how he\u2019s going to campaign on Medicare for All: \u2018Are people going to get nervous and run away from it?\u2019\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 aides have long believed that persuading voters he can oust Trump is key to winning the primary. It\u2019s been a central part of their strategy since the earliest days of their 2020 campaign, and they\u2019ve crafted a campaign tour, speeches and digital P.R. push aimed at winning the argument. But after months of work, they\u2019re still running up against voters who support Sanders\u2019 bid but just can\u2019t see it happening, no matter what the poll numbers say.\n\n\"I love Bernie,\u201d said Gloria Hoag, a New Hampshire delegate, at the state Democratic Party\u2019s annual convention last weekend. \u201cBut I don't know if he can beat Trump because he's so far to the left. We need someone who's a little more moderate.\u201d\n\nDemocrats are petrified that Trump will win a second term, and many are telling pollsters that they care more about whether candidates can take him on than their policy positions. Joe Biden is the front-runner in part because so many voters are looking at the primary through the eyes of a pundit. Elizabeth Warren, who is tied with Sanders for second place according to Real Clear Politics\u2019 polling average, has risen in the polls as she\u2019s persuaded larger numbers of Democrats she can win.\n\nPOLITICO Playbook newsletter Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nBut Sanders hasn't had as much success convincing more voters he has what it takes to defeat Trump, possibly complicating his path to the nomination.\n\nAt a canvassing kickoff in New Hampshire on Saturday, Sanders\u2019 campaign co-chair, Ben Cohen, pinpointed the problem. He wanted to be sure that the hundreds of volunteers and staffers in the crowd heard what he said before they left to knock on voters\u2019 doors.\n\n\u201cFor so many people out there that are going to vote in this primary, the most important issue is beating Trump,\u201d said Cohen, the co-founder of Ben & Jerry\u2019s. \u201cAnd for most people, the general idea that's out there in the mainstream is that the person who is going to beat Trump is the centrist, Biden. But the reality is that in poll after poll after poll, Bernie beats Trump.\u201d\n\nSanders hammered away at the same message minutes later: \u201cWe are defeating Trump in every national poll that has ever been done,\" he told his army of supporters.\n\nSanders has tried to persuade Democrats that he\u2019s their best fighter largely through data, but he has attempted other approaches at times. The Vermont senator took a four-day \"electability tour\" in April through Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan \u2014 the Rust Belt states that were critical to Trump\u2019s 2016 victory \u2014 as well as other parts of the Midwest to demonstrate that he can win over working-class voters.\n\nBut it's Warren who has made the biggest gain in perceived electability recently. The percentage of voters considering her who think she would probably oust Trump has gone from 39 percent to 55 percent in the last three months \u2014 a 16-point leap \u2014 according to polling by CBS/YouGov. Other surveys paint a similar trajectory.\n\nFor Sanders, the polling is more mixed. He got good news this week when CBS/YouGov found that 58 percent of voters eyeing him believe he would probably beat Trump, up from 50 percent in June. But according to polls by the Economist/YouGov, 52 percent of likely Democratic voters currently think Sanders would probably win an election against Trump \u2014 the same number as those who did so in June.\n\nBiden, meanwhile, remains ahead of both Warren and Sanders in perceived electability in numerous polls.\n\nSanders is facing a challenge for multiple reasons, Democratic operatives said: He is seen by some voters as simply too liberal to beat Trump, more the leader of a robust movement than a commander-in-chief. Republicans would try to scare center-left suburban voters by painting him as a leftist radical, skeptics of the Vermont senator have said.\n\nWhile Sanders leads Trump in both national and battleground state polling, Biden is further ahead \u2014 which could be important to Democrats in an election in which they see no room for error. It's also possible Sanders isn't talking about electability the right way.\n\n\u201cHis message tends to focus on what he wants to do and where he wants to take the country on issues. It\u2019s not so much a comparison with Trump,\u201d said Jeff Link, a Democratic strategist in the first-in-the-nation caucus state of Iowa. \u201cThat\u2019s probably why he hasn\u2019t moved a lot. ... Certainly Biden talks about Trump more.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 aides believe that the media is also hurting his cause. Pundits portray Biden as the electable candidate, they argue, dismissing polls showing Sanders would defeat him as well.\n\nDespite the fact that Warren has made more gains in the area recently, Sanders\u2019 aides think he'll win the nomination because voters will come to see Sanders as the candidate best positioned to both defeat Trump and deliver change.\n\nMedicare for All is a key part of that. Though they admit some voters are wary of a general-election backlash over it, his staffers think more and more people will eventually gravitate toward his candidacy precisely because of his far-reaching health care proposal. In their view, Trump won, in part, by parroting Sanders\u2019 populist plans, such as cutting prescription drug prices and negotiating pro-worker trade deals.\n\n\"He campaigned as a fake Bernie Sanders,\" said Shakir. \"The way you beat him is with a real Bernie Sanders.\"\n\nIt\u2019s striking how differently the leading Democratic candidates talk about electability. Biden has put the issue at the center of his campaign, and his first TV ad in Iowa used a number-driven approach. It trumpeted that \u201call the polls agree: Joe Biden is the strongest Democrat to do the job.\u201d\n\nInstead of talking about polls, Warren has sought to upend the way voters think about electability altogether. In the second primary debate in July, she quipped, \u201cI remember when people said Barack Obama couldn't get elected. Shoot, I remember when people said Donald Trump couldn't get elected.\u201d\n\nKamala Harris has taken a similar approach, arguing that pundits dismiss African-American and female voters when considering who can win the Midwest: \u201cIt\u2019s short-sighted. It\u2019s wrong,\u201d she said.\n\nIn his most successful moments, Sanders\u2019 efforts to prove he\u2019s electable has gone viral. During a Fox News-hosted town hall earlier this year that was held in a Pennsylvania county that backed Trump, audience members cheered when they were asked if they wanted to switch to Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All plan. The intended message was clear: Sanders\u2019 populism can defeat Trump in the battleground states that matter.\n\nOther times, his efforts have fallen flat. Ahead of the first debate, Sanders\u2019 campaign signaled that he would take on Biden over electability. But Sanders failed to aggressively confront Biden, and in the run-up to the second debate, his team settled on a different strategy : put Medicare for All center-stage.\n\nMark Longabaugh, a top strategist for Sanders during his 2016 presidential bid, said the conventional wisdom on electability gets it backwards: The first step is for a candidate to make the sell to voters on values and issues. Then, if a candidate succeeds on that front, the rest comes naturally. Warren, he said, is probably seen as more electable by voters these days because she's won their support \u2014 not the other way around.\n\n\"This whole electability thing is overblown,\" he said. \u201cI remember the early feedback we got in 2015 in Iowa and New Hampshire: A lot of people said they loved Bernie\u2019s message, absolutely loved it, but they just assumed Clinton was going to win. Over time, as the campaign developed and his standing progressed, they stopped saying that. Because they liked him.\u201d", "description": "The Vermont senator is going all-out persuade voters he can win a general election \u2014 but Elizabeth Warren has made more headway lately.", "authors": ["Holly Otterbein"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/6e/dc/96a8351b44048c8904320d2e2235/19911-bernie-sanders-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
