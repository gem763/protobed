When I go back now I always feel as if I\u2019m in the middle of a medieval painting.\n\nARE YOU A GOOD FLYER?\n\nI was terrified when I first went on a plane in my teens. I assumed we\u2019d rise up into the sky like a helicopter, so when we took off diagonally, I thought: \u2018Oh my gosh we\u2019re going to crash.\u2019 But I learnt to enjoy flying.\n\nWHAT ANNOYS YOU ABOUT TRAVELLING?\n\nI can\u2019t see very well and often have trouble working out where to go at an airport. By the time I\u2019ve reached the departure gate I sometimes wonder: \u2018Is it worth it?\u2019\n\nARE YOU A DARING TRAVELLER?\n\nNo. I want to go somewhere civilised with a comfortable bed.\n\nANY TRAVEL TIPS?\n\nGo light. I take only one pair of shoes and three outfits with me. That\u2019s usually enough.\n\nFAVOURITE CITY?\n\nDame Jacqueline said Boston is her favourite city for its lovely parks, art galleries and lots of ice-cream shops\n\nBoston, because it\u2019s a civilised and polite place with lovely parks, art galleries and lots of ice-cream shops.\n\nHOLIDAY FROM HELL?\n\nWhen my daughter was little we visited North Wales. It\u2019s a beautiful area but the cottage we rented out turned out to be more of a converted garage \u2026 and it poured every single day.", "description": "The best-selling author talks about a holiday from hell in North Wales,\u00a0reveals why Boston is her favourite city - and more...", "authors": ["York Membery For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/12/15/19627458-0-image-a-31_1570889100507.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
