I shake and tremble at the thought of our future without them.\u201d\n\nBivens flew from a road trip back to southern Virginia when he learned of Tuesday\u2019s tragedy. He was accompanied by Montgomery Biscuits manager Morgan Ensberg.\n\n\u201cIt was awful,\u201d Ensberg said. \u201cBlake is an incredibly strong man. He\u2019s an incredibly strong man, and he went through just a rotation of tearing up, and then he would shake and then he would just stare.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t let him out of my sight.\u201d\n\nThe 18-year-old brother of Bivens\u2018 wife has been charged with first-degree murder in the slayings, which have shocked his coaches, teammates and the community where his family lived.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t wish this on any community, any family,\u201d Pittsylvania County Sheriff Mike Taylor said. \u201cWe\u2019re a small community. It affects us all.\u201d\n\nBivens posted a series of photos of his wife Emily, 14-month-old son Cullen and mother-in-law Joan Bernard.\n\n\u201cEmily, my sweetheart, you are the best wife and mother this world has ever seen,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou made me into the man I am today and you loved me with all of my flaws. You brought our precious baby boy into this world and made our family complete. Your love and kindness changed countless lives, including mine.\u201d\n\nOf Cullen, Bivens wrote \u201cI can\u2019t breathe without you here\u201d and \u201cI finally understood what love was when you were born and I would have done anything for you.\u201d\n\nCourt documents released Thursday revealed new details in the slayings but did not explain what could have driven 18-year-old Matthew Bernard to allegedly kill his sister, nephew and mother.\n\nIn Montgomery, the Biscuits \u2014 a Double-A affiliate of the Tampa Bay Rays \u2014 painted \u201cBIV\u201d on the ground behind home plate before a game against Pensacola. They were to hold a moment of silence before the game, with another planned before the Rays\u2019 home game Friday against the Cleveland Indians.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s thinking about baseball,\u201d Ensberg said.\n\nMontgomery pitching coach R.C. Lichtenstein remembers pregame moments when Bivens would walk over to see his wife and hold Cullen.\n\nBiscuits pitcher Ryan Thompson said Bivens\u2018 family was on his mind \u201call the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis family was everything to him,\u201d said an emotional Thompson, who described Bivens as a close friend with a \u201chilarious\u201d sense of humor.\n\n\u201cHe never lets the game get in the way of who he is as a human being. He\u2019s such a great guy, and something like this couldn\u2019t happen to a better human being,\u201d Thompson said.\n\nAccording to the complaint filed against Bernard, the teenager\u2019s rampage began Tuesday morning at a neighbor\u2019s house. Bernard punched the neighbor in the arm and then ran away, police said.\n\nThe neighbor then heard gunshots at the house next door, police said. The neighbor drove to the house and found a woman\u2019s body in the driveway. Inside, she found the other two bodies.\n\nOfficers found two victims with gunshot wounds to the head and rifle shell casings near all three bodies.\n\nA rifle was found in a wooded area behind the house and a sledgehammer with blood was found in the garage, the court documents said.\n\nThe criminal complaint did not offer any motive for the killings, and authorities have declined to comment.\n\nAfter the bodies were discovered, a manhunt brought as many as 100 officers to Keeling, a tiny community near the North Carolina border.\n\nBernard emerged naked from the woods about four hours later, running past TV cameras to a church parking lot, where he was recorded trying to choke a church caretaker.\n\nAn officer used pepper spray and struck Bernard with a baton before he was captured, officials said.\n\nBernard banged his head against the cage in a police vehicle after being taken into custody and was taken to a hospital for treatment, police said. He was released and was in jail Thursday, where he was being held without bail and kept on suicide watch, police said.\n\nA \u201ccelebration of life\u201d service for the slain family members is planned for Saturday.\n\nA vigil was held at The River Church in Danville, Virginia, Wednesday night. Senior pastor Jackie Poe led those in attendance in prayer for the Bivens and Bernard families.\n\nAvery Stevens, pastor of Keeling Baptist Church, said he was in his office where he also works as an insurance agent when he saw the television coverage of Bernard\u2019s capture near his church.\n\n\u201cThis is a small, rural community, pretty quiet most of the time like most small, rural communities. But the fact of the matter is, it can happen anywhere, and right there at the doorstep,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPray for the family,\u201d he said. \u201cPraying for the community. Praying for healing.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Tampa Bay Rays minor leaguer Blake Bivens said his \"heart was turned to ash\" when his wife, 1-year-old son and mother-in-law were slain this week.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/08/28/rays_minor_league_triple_slaying_09389_c153-0-2847-1571_s1770x1032.jpg?2a597937fab77ac0bde005af3accfea349525a63"}
