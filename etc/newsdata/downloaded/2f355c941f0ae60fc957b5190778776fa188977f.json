While benign drones must be tracked, it is the malicious ones that must be stopped.\n\n\u201cDrone attacks are relatively cheap and easy to initiate but can inflict major damage,\u201d IHS Markit analyst Oliver Philippou wrote in the note.\n\nROBOCALL 'HIJACKING' IS ON THE RISE, REPORT WARNS\n\n\u201cAn effective perimeter security system that ignores the potential threat of nefarious drones is missing more than half of the equation,\u201d Philippou added.\n\nThe recent attack on the world\u2019s largest oil-processing plant in Saudi Arabia shows how vulnerable any large facility is to malicious drones.\n\nThe Saudi Arabian oil facilities are in an area that was not adequately protected by Saudi air defense systems, Fox News has previously reported. And the U.S. Patriot missile defense system does not have 360-degree coverage, the report added.\n\nIranian cruise missiles and drones were both used in the attack, according to IHS' report.\n\nHigh-profile attacks like the one in Saudi Arabia will drive an increase of more than $700 million in global demand for counter-drone perimeter security equipment such as counter-unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS), IHS Markit said.\n\nModern security systems require a layered approach that keeps up with the evolution of drone technology, according to Dedrone, which builds systems to defend against malicious drones.\n\nDedrone, for example, provides systems that collect sensor information for classifying drones. A web-based interface shows live threats, real-time drone flight paths, and records forensic details such as video evidence.\n\nOther high-profile defense companies have been announcing anti-drone systems. Raytheon and Black Sage have partnered to provide an integrated drone detection and mitigation system for both civil and military organizations.\n\n13TH-CENTURY DEATH PIT REVEALS MURDERED FAMILY IN THE CITY 'DROWNED IN BLOOD'\n\nThough Raytheon has developed counter-drone systems including missiles, lasers, and high-powered microwaves, \u201cauthorities also need a system that can safely stop and land a drone where it may not be safe to shoot them down,\u201d Raytheon said in a statement, adding that they are working with Black Sage on a solution.\n\nPerimeter systems should have a variety of technologies including thermal, sensors, ground-based radar, and drone detection technology, according to IHS Markit.\n\nOne of the challenges is that legislation and regulations are currently hindering the growth of the market for unmanned security systems, IHS Markit said.\n\n\u201cHowever, it shouldn\u2019t be forgotten that the security industry is an event-driven market \u2014 and incidents like this can have an enormous impact,\u201d IHS\u2019 Philippou said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "The attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil fields will drive a massive increase in the need for perimeter security gear, according to a new report.", "authors": ["Brooke Crothers"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/18/694940094001_6087437506001_6087438222001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
