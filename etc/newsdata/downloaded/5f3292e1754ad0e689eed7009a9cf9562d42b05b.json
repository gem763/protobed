Indeed, markets sank to their lows of the day as investors digested the Fed\u2019s latest decision, and what divided officials meant for the prospect of more monetary stimulus.\n\nTrump tweeted that the central bank lacked \u201cvision\u201d as well as clear communication \u2014 continuing his war of words against the Fed and the man he hand-picked to lead the institution.\n\nJay Powell and the Federal Reserve Fail Again. No \u201cguts,\u201d no sense, no vision! A terrible communicator! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 18, 2019\n\nThe central bank\u2019s decision \u2014 and its \u201cdot plot\u201d of future rate expectations \u2014 indicated a clearly dovish bias. However, the market\u2019s reaction suggested disappointment that a deeper easing campaign could pull rates even lower.\n\nPresident Donald Trump arrives at Los Angeles International Airport to attend a fundraiser, Tuesday, Sept. 17, 2019, in Los Angeles.

The stock market is of course disappointed with the limit on the amount of candy they'll get, but more rate cuts assumes an ever slowing economy and that's not something to cheer for,\u201d he added.\n\nThe president\u2019s response comes a week after he issued a call for the Fed to engineer rates to zero \u201cor less,\u201d and backed negative yields as part of a strategy to cut U.S. borrowing costs and stimulate growth.\n\nWith the world economy sandbagged by the downside risks of the U.S.-China trade war, Trump has lashed out repeatedly at the central bank, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nLast week, the president called the central bank \u201cboneheads\u201d for missing out on \u201ca once in a lifetime opportunity\u201d presented by historically low yields. Still, the Fed chief enjoys support from investors and top executives on Wall Street.\n\n\u201cJay Powell is a quality human being. He\u2019s quite bright. He\u2019s quite knowledgeable,\u201d Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, told Yahoo Finance in a roundtable interview with reporters.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dealing with complex situations and most Fed chairs have had a little bit of trouble early on, on how they communicate. And of course, this Fed communicates a lot,\u201d the banker said \u2014 adding that perhaps Powell and the central bank should \u201ccommunicate a lot less.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of the decision, Wall Street hunkered at session lows:\n\nS&P 500 (^GSPC) -0.7%, or 22.25 points\n\nDow (^DJI): -0.7%, or 184.64 points\n\nNasdaq (^IXIC): -1%, or 86.65 points\n\nU.S. crude oil prices (CL=F): -2% to $58.10 per barrel\n\n10-year Treasury yield (^TNX): -5.1 bps to 1.763%\n\nGold (GC=F): -0.34% to $1,508.20 per ounce\n\n\u2014Yahoo Finance\u2019s Jessica Smith contributed to this story.\n\nJavier David is an editor for Yahoo Finance.
