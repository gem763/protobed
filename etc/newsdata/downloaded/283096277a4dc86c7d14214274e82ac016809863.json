Tottenham Hotspur away On first glance, it\u2019s just a simple, navy all over away kit, exactly the same as the 2017/18 campaign. Boring. Uninspired. Drab. BUT LOOK AGAIN! Do you see it now? An ever so subtle purple gradient pattern that would have looked absolutely outstanding on the chiselled torso of Paulo Dybala. (It's not going to happen.) Sigh.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 5.8 Getty Images 29/54 24. Sheffield United home Take note, Southampton: THAT\u2019s how you do a red-and-white striped home kit!

Liverpool home Another season. Another solid if not especially remarkable classic looking Liverpool home kit. It\u2019s not especially memorable, but really, what does that even matter?

And significant \u2013 SIGNIFICANT \u2013 bonus points for how the crown of the King Power logo perfectly matches the gold accents on the sleeves. Take note: horrible sponsors of the Premier League. However, loses both points and probity for \u2013 essentially \u2013 being the exact same kit Chelsea wore during the 2012/13 season. Did you honestly think we wouldn\u2019t notice, Adidas???\n\n\n\nSCORE: 8.1 Getty Images 40/54 SEE! Getty 41/54 13.

To be honest, it\u2019s not great, but this strip practically comes with an iron-clad guarantee to wind up Yer Da\u2019 and the rest of the gammon brigade, which means it automatically sneaks into our top ten.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 8.5 Getty Images 42/54 12. Manchester City away Wow. Would you look at that. Puma proudly boast that this naughtily asymmetrical little number was inspired by legendary Manchester nightclub The Hacienda.

Manchester United home Yes, it\u2019s got a devilishly sexy gold monochrome badge. Yes, the red Adidas stripes give it a nice minimalist look. And, yes, absolutely anything would have been better than last season\u2019s gradient garbage. BUT CAN WE ALL PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE ADIDAS GOT THEIR MATHS WRONG? It commemorates the famous 1999 treble win \u2013 so shouldn\u2019t they have released this last season? Please, write in, email in, abuse me on Twitter \u2013 whatever. I need answers.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 9.25 Getty Images 45/54 9. Chelsea away Preppy. Oh, yes. Clean. Classy. Coquet. Looks like something Roger Federer would wear at Wimbledon. Just a pity the socks aren\u2019t also white.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 9.3 Chelsea FC via Getty Images 46/54 8. Arsenal third A late addition. But well worth the wait. Add Adidas x Arsenal to the list of all-time great combinations, alongside salt and vinegar, Lil Nas and Billy Ray Cyrus and The Independent and irreverent football kit reviews. Adidas describe this little worldie as a \u201cdark blue kit with yellow detail featuring Climalite technology to keep you dry with mesh ventilation panels below the sleeves to help regulate body temperature\u201d.

Squint a bit, and it almost looks like the cover of David Bowie\u2019s Aladdin Sane. Not his best work. Definitely behind Low, Station to Station, Young Americans, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, Blackstar, Heroes, Hunky Dory, Diamond Dogs, Let\u2019s Dance, Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps), The Next Day and the second side of The Man Who Sold The World. But ahead of the all others. Sorry, Lodger.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 9.9 Crystal Palace 50/54 5. Arsenal home Yup. That\u2019s exactly what an Arsenal home kit should like. Red shirt. White sleeves n\u2019 socks, with a bit of dark blue thrown in for good measure. Makes a welcome change for the Gunners after their miserable four-year partnership with Puma, whose kits always looked like they were designed only with the sole purpose of throttling your nipples.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 10 Arsenal FC via Getty Images 51/54 4. West Ham away Brilliant all round: from the claret and blue cuffs to the Basset & Gold shirt sleeve sponsor \u2013 which somehow manages to be more quintessentially West Ham than the actual club badge itself.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 10.5 West Ham 52/54 3. Everton away Sure, it\u2019s bold, but come on \u2013 how can you possibly dislike the classic hue of \u2018living coral\u2019? This is undoubtedly Umbro\u2019s biggest win of the season, with the navy shorts offsetting the pink perfectly and the tonal diagonal stripe pattern adding even more class to proceedings. No wonder Moise Kean left one of the biggest clubs in Europe to rock up at Goodison Park. He just wanted to get his hands on this.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 27 Everton FC via Getty Images 53/54 2. Leicester third Like, why has nobody done this before? Take the absolutely classic 1990 Germany World Cup kit pattern, and make it \u2026 PINK. And not just pastel pink, like Manchester United\u2019s admittedly lovely away kit last season. No, full on, burning hot fuscia. Just look at James Maddison\u2019s wee smile. He\u2019s delighted. If you don't like this, you're either boring or old. Or both. Sorry. It's the second best kit in the Premier League this season, behind only...\n\n\n\nSCORE: 465 Leicester 54/54 1.

Also has the rather unfortunate visual effect of making the club\u2019s players look like they\u2019re wearing a pair of crotch-decimating jack-up pantaloons.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 3.4 CameraSport via Getty Images 19/54 34. Everton home Umbro say that the odd, seemingly Tetris-inspired print is \u201cinspired by the distinctive criss-crossed steelwork from the upper tier of the Bullens Road stand, the work of legendary stadium architect Archibald Leitch\u201d. Okay, lads. Nobody likes a try hard. You're 31st. Deal with it.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 3.76 Getty Images 20/54 33. Watford home Another reasonably nice kit absolutely ruined by a massive betting company sponsor, with a couple of random Chinese characters thrown in to boot. NEXT.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 4 Getty Images 21/54 32. Brighton away Clearly knocked up by time-pressed Nike scufflers at exactly 4.55pm on a Friday evening, as the rest of their swoosh sporting colleagues disappeared for the boozer.\n\n\n\nNike worker one: \u201cChrist, we\u2019re meant to be down the pub in five minutes and we still haven\u2019t designed Brighton\u2019s away kit!\u201d\n\n\n\nNike worker two: \u201cBlack shirt. Black shorts. Black socks. Mine\u2019s a Carling.\u201d\n\n\n\nSCORE: 5 Action Images via Reuters 22/54 31. Manchester United third Look, if you\u2019re determined to design an all-black away kit, this is how you do it: whack a subtle gradient pattern into the mix and get a bit of florescent piping on there. Is it still boring? Well, yes. Is it at least better than Burnley away? Also yes.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 5 23/54 30. Crystal Palace home Average. Mediocre. Second-rate. Ordinary. Middle-of-the-road. Unexceptional. Indifferent. Humdrum.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 5 Getty Images 24/54 29. Liverpool third Looks like the sort of thing worn by a bunch of socially awkward teenagers competing at an e-Sports tournament. It might be good enough for a motley crew of button-mashing, Twitch-watching, voice-breaking, cheesy Dorito-eating, Red Bull-sipping, pimple-popping professional Fortnite gamers. But it\u2019s not good enough for the likes of Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Virgil van Dijk. Pass.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 5.01 Action Plus via Getty Images 25/54 28. Manchester City home A relatively hard to dislike affair absolutely ruined by the large swathes of Tinky Winky magenta. A kit not befitting of Champions League quarter-finalists.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 5.02 Getty Images 26/54 27. Watford away HANDS UP: Completely forgot to include this until somebody on Twitter spotted it was missing. (Cheers, James!) Let's be honest: you can kind of see why. Another Adidas template in a dreary North Sea blue. Not the worst. Not the best.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 5.042382394893 Watford 27/54 26. Newcastle United away If this football kit was an alcoholic beverage, it would be a Peroni. Bang average. Will still sell well. You\u2019ve seen the pic, read the silly caption, now be on your way.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 5.5 Getty Images 28/54 25. Tottenham Hotspur away On first glance, it\u2019s just a simple, navy all over away kit, exactly the same as the 2017/18 campaign. Boring. Uninspired. Drab. BUT LOOK AGAIN! Do you see it now? An ever so subtle purple gradient pattern that would have looked absolutely outstanding on the chiselled torso of Paulo Dybala. (It's not going to happen.) Sigh.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 5.8 Getty Images 29/54 24. Sheffield United home Take note, Southampton: THAT\u2019s how you do a red-and-white striped home kit! Sheffield United may be destined to already be relegated by February with a points tally of 5 and goal difference of -123 \u2013 but at least they\u2019re going to be dropping down in style.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 6 Getty Images 30/54 23. Chelsea home There\u2019s a lot going on here. From a distance, it looks like your standard Chelsea home kit, with a rather nice cut-away collar. Get up close, and it looks as though the Zodiac killer has been let loose at Nike HQ. Some will hate it. Some will love it. We\u2019ll stick it slap bang in the middle of our prestigious yearly rankings, then.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 7 Getty Images 31/54 22. Norwich City home The news that gradient fades are, like, soooooooooo 2018/19 clearly didn\u2019t travel to Errea HQ. But, snark aside, this gets significant bonus points for that lovely, rich shade of Marks & Spencer green and we\u2019re fans of that natty collar, too.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 7.1 Getty Images 32/54 21. Bournemouth home Some red stripes. Some black stripes. A pair of black shorts. A pair of black socks. Done.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 7.3 Getty Images 33/54 20. Newcastle United third Wins some serious 2019/20 Premier League kits ranked and rated points for being louder than a pissed Brian Blessed singing the national anthem directly into your eardrum at 6am in the morning. Loses a few points for clashing quite spectacularly with Matty Longstaff\u2019s violently auburn bonce.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 7.5 Newcastle United 34/54 19. Wolves home Yeah, it\u2019s alright isn\u2019t it, thanks for asking. Would probably be higher but for the fact it\u2019s based on the Tiro 19 template, like pretty much every other Adidas kit in the world.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 7.566 Getty Images 35/54 18. Tottenham Hotspur home It\u2019s a classic, innit. Very difficult to dislike. Even more difficult to muster up the enthusiasm to write more than three sentences.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 7.7 Getty Images 36/54 17. Brighton home Brighton have had a few boring home kits in recent seasons, but the darker shade of blue and subtle gradient pattern really help to elevate this effort towards the top of our rankings.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 7.8 Getty Images 37/54 16. Liverpool home Another season. Another solid if not especially remarkable classic looking Liverpool home kit. It\u2019s not especially memorable, but really, what does that even matter? We all know how well it\u2019s going to sell. Give it two weeks and around 20 per cent of the earth\u2019s population will own one.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 7.9 EPA 38/54 15. Wolves away Oooo. A laudably gothic effort from Wolves for their away kit this season. Think how wonderful this is going to look on the road in the Europa League, illuminated by flares on a threatening night in Besiktas.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 8 Wolves 39/54 14. Leicester home Classy AF. And significant \u2013 SIGNIFICANT \u2013 bonus points for how the crown of the King Power logo perfectly matches the gold accents on the sleeves. Take note: horrible sponsors of the Premier League. However, loses both points and probity for \u2013 essentially \u2013 being the exact same kit Chelsea wore during the 2012/13 season. Did you honestly think we wouldn\u2019t notice, Adidas???\n\n\n\nSCORE: 8.1 Getty Images 40/54 SEE! Getty 41/54 13. Manchester United away Hang on, is that \u2026 PAUL POGBA \u2026 ARROGANTLY holding up his left arm and DEMANDING the ball \u2026 while wearing a MANCHESTER UNITED shirt sporting some kind of BIZARRO GIRAFFE SKIN GRAPHIC PRINT??? To be honest, it\u2019s not great, but this strip practically comes with an iron-clad guarantee to wind up Yer Da\u2019 and the rest of the gammon brigade, which means it automatically sneaks into our top ten.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 8.5 Getty Images 42/54 12. Manchester City away Wow. Would you look at that. Puma proudly boast that this naughtily asymmetrical little number was inspired by legendary Manchester nightclub The Hacienda. We think it looks more like something a background character might mooch around wearing in Blade Runner, probably while Harrison Ford stares moodily into the middle distance at a neon-lit noodle bar.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 8.999 Getty Images 43/54 11. Liverpool away Gorgeous. Somebody get Nike on the blower, quick, because that right there is what the next England kit should look like. Apparently \u201cinspired by the iconic street signs around Anfield\u201d. We\u2019ll let New Balance off that one, considering how brilliant this is.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 9.1 Liverpool FC via Getty Images 44/54 10. Manchester United home Yes, it\u2019s got a devilishly sexy gold monochrome badge. Yes, the red Adidas stripes give it a nice minimalist look. And, yes, absolutely anything would have been better than last season\u2019s gradient garbage. BUT CAN WE ALL PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE ADIDAS GOT THEIR MATHS WRONG? It commemorates the famous 1999 treble win \u2013 so shouldn\u2019t they have released this last season? Please, write in, email in, abuse me on Twitter \u2013 whatever. I need answers.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 9.25 Getty Images 45/54 9. Chelsea away Preppy. Oh, yes. Clean. Classy. Coquet. Looks like something Roger Federer would wear at Wimbledon. Just a pity the socks aren\u2019t also white.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 9.3 Chelsea FC via Getty Images 46/54 8. Arsenal third A late addition. But well worth the wait. Add Adidas x Arsenal to the list of all-time great combinations, alongside salt and vinegar, Lil Nas and Billy Ray Cyrus and The Independent and irreverent football kit reviews. Adidas describe this little worldie as a \u201cdark blue kit with yellow detail featuring Climalite technology to keep you dry with mesh ventilation panels below the sleeves to help regulate body temperature\u201d. Our description is better: HUBBA, HUBBA.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 9.3888888888889888888888 Adidas 47/54 7. Crystal Palace away Another dark, asymmetrical kit from Pupa with bold as brass accents. Another fat, fat W.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 9.4 Getty Images 48/54 BONUS! Manchester City heritage The kit Manchester City wore to win the Community Shield (in association with McDonalds) against Liverpool. On another note: a round of applause, please, for David Silva\u2019s Lazarus-like lid. PA 49/54 6. Crystal Palace third Sublime. We\u2019re massive fans of that lesser spotted refracted sash. Squint a bit, and it almost looks like the cover of David Bowie\u2019s Aladdin Sane. Not his best work. Definitely behind Low, Station to Station, Young Americans, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, Blackstar, Heroes, Hunky Dory, Diamond Dogs, Let\u2019s Dance, Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps), The Next Day and the second side of The Man Who Sold The World. But ahead of the all others. Sorry, Lodger.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 9.9 Crystal Palace 50/54 5. Arsenal home Yup. That\u2019s exactly what an Arsenal home kit should like. Red shirt. White sleeves n\u2019 socks, with a bit of dark blue thrown in for good measure. Makes a welcome change for the Gunners after their miserable four-year partnership with Puma, whose kits always looked like they were designed only with the sole purpose of throttling your nipples.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 10 Arsenal FC via Getty Images 51/54 4. West Ham away Brilliant all round: from the claret and blue cuffs to the Basset & Gold shirt sleeve sponsor \u2013 which somehow manages to be more quintessentially West Ham than the actual club badge itself.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 10.5 West Ham 52/54 3. Everton away Sure, it\u2019s bold, but come on \u2013 how can you possibly dislike the classic hue of \u2018living coral\u2019? This is undoubtedly Umbro\u2019s biggest win of the season, with the navy shorts offsetting the pink perfectly and the tonal diagonal stripe pattern adding even more class to proceedings. No wonder Moise Kean left one of the biggest clubs in Europe to rock up at Goodison Park. He just wanted to get his hands on this.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 27 Everton FC via Getty Images 53/54 2. Leicester third Like, why has nobody done this before? Take the absolutely classic 1990 Germany World Cup kit pattern, and make it \u2026 PINK. And not just pastel pink, like Manchester United\u2019s admittedly lovely away kit last season. No, full on, burning hot fuscia. Just look at James Maddison\u2019s wee smile. He\u2019s delighted. If you don't like this, you're either boring or old. Or both. Sorry. It's the second best kit in the Premier League this season, behind only...\n\n\n\nSCORE: 465 Leicester 54/54 1. Arsenal away In the words of Mr James Hillier Blount, better known by his stage name James Blunt: \u201cYou\u2019re beautiful / You\u2019re beautiful / You\u2019re beautiful, it\u2019s true.\u201d Takes an absolute classic of the kit genre \u2013 Arsenal\u2019s endlessly iconic 1991 \u2013 1993 \u2018bruised banana\u2019 \u2013 and puts a fun, funky twist on it. Wear it to five-a-side. Wear it on a date. Wear it to the Warehouse Project. Wear it even if you support Manchester United, or Chelsea, or Spurs. Just embrace it, whoever and wherever you are. Because that\u2019s what football is all about, after all. Supporting one another, savouring the game and spreading the love. Thanks for reading. And if you want me, you\u2019ll find me in a dark corner of the Arsenal megastore, breathing deeply.\n\n\n\nSCORE: 43980439549058690 Arsenal FC via Getty Images\n\nSouthampton enjoyed a spell of pressure early in the second half, but they did not really threaten an equaliser and slipped to a third defeat of the season.\n\nJust once Spurs would like to do things the easy way and a straightforward afternoon looked a possibility after they enjoyed a promising opening 30 minutes.\n\nAfter Lloris had thwarted early danger from Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, with a smart stretching save, the home side \u2013 and specifically Ndombele \u2013 came to life.\n\nThe Frenchman has stuttered in his start to football in England, but showed why Spurs broke their transfer record on him.\n\nHe carried the ball, beating players, put some dangerous balls into the box and provided a goalscoring threat.\n\nAfter seeing one goalbound effort deflected, he was rewarded with the opener in the 24th minute.\n\nSpurs recycled an attack, the ball fell to Son Heung-min and he teed up Ndombele to lash home an effort that went through Angus Gunn\u2019s grasp.\n\nAny hopes of kicking on from there were abruptly ended in the space of four minutes as Aurier picked up two yellow cards for brainless fouls and was sent off in the 31st minute.\n\nThe last thing Spurs needed to do was give Southampton a helping hand, but that is what happened after an unforgivable piece of play from Lloris.\n\nThe Frenchman has a reputation for being a liability in possession \u2013 not something you want from a goalkeeper whose side play out from the back \u2013 and his error gifted the Saints the equaliser in the 39th minute.\n\nReceiving the ball inside his own six-yard box, Lloris inexplicably tried a Cruyff turn with Ings closing in on him, but missed his kick and the Southampton striker\u2019s tackle saw the ball dribble over the line.\n\nIt was Lloris\u2019 ninth error leading to a goal in just over three years and surely his worst.\n\nGiven all the negativity surrounding the club this season it could have been easy for Spurs to sink, but it took them only four minutes to regain their lead.\n\nIn a move that started off with Moussa Sissoko, it took just 11 touches for the ball to end up in the back of the net as Kane flicked on a long ball, Son and Christian Eriksen exchanged passes, with the Dane then setting up the England captain to fire into the bottom corner.\n\nLloris was in negative equity after his first-half gaffe but went some way to getting back into credit with a couple of excellent stops after the restart.\n\nFirst he tipped a curling James Ward-Prowse free-kick out with a flying save and then did even better to beat away Maya Yoshida\u2019s free header.\n\nSouthampton seemed to run out of steam and it was Spurs that found a second wind.\n\nKane was playing a magnificent part in a lone role and it was almost rewarded with a second goal in the final 10 minutes but he drilled an effort wide.\n\nIn the end, and perhaps unsurprisingly, Spurs saw it out with relative ease to produce a vital three points\n\n\u200bPA", "description": "Tottenham\u00a0showed their team spirit is alive and kicking after they overcame a Hugo Lloris gaffe and a sending off to beat Southampton\u00a02-1.
