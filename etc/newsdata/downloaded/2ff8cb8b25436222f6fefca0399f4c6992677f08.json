In the bathrooms, the shower curtains are hung too low, so everything grows mold,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cIt\u2019s most concerning, the amount of mold that grows, and, no matter how many times we clean it up, it comes back.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nStudents are expected to permanently move out of Old Leonardtown at the end of this school year, with the 1970s-era structures later being demolished, student newspaper the Diamondback reported. About 225 students live in the complex, according to the university\u2019s website.\n\nAD\n\nMichael Robidoux, 19, said rain showers Oct. 20 flooded his bedroom, although he did not find mold.\n\n\u201cWe realized that most of our floor was pretty wet. Rain had come through the walls and soaked our carpet,\u201d the sophomore said. \u201cIt\u2019s been pretty frustrating.\u201d\n\nA university spokeswoman said Old Leonardtown is not experiencing persistent problems and described mold growth reported in one apartment as an \u201cisolated incident.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nU-Md. spent $30,000 to purchase and install the sensors. So far, they\u2019ve been planted in three dorms and nine academic buildings. School leaders said they hope to identify mold growth before it leads to infestation.\n\nData is collected manually from the devices every 48 hours, said university spokeswoman Katie Lawson. In November, the sensors will be replaced with \u201csmart sensors\u201d that share readings in real time.\n\nAD\n\nMichael Kletz, an allergist and immunologist with practices in the District and Northern Virginia who is not affiliated with U-Md., said the sensors could be a useful mold abatement tool.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much easier to get rid of mold when it starts than once it\u2019s already grown,\u201d Kletz said. \u201cThe thing about mold is that it tends to increase, or is more likely, when it gets humid. When the humidity is kept to a minimum, there\u2019s less of a chance of the mold growing. But it\u2019s still possible to have mold grow, even in deserts.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe university expects to spend $84,000 a year to keep the sensors working and to monitor the data, Lawson said. The campus purchased 50 additional sensors to keep in reserve in case moisture problems arise in other buildings, university spokeswoman Natifia Mullings said.\n\nThe introduction of the mold monitoring system follows criticism leveled at the school for its handling of last year\u2019s infestation and for an adenovirus outbreak that left one student dead and more than 40 other students ill.\n\nAD\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) called on the university to investigate its response to the adenovirus outbreak. Officials waited 18 days to tell students the virus was present on campus. Olivia Paregol, an 18-year-old freshman with a compromised immune system, died of complications from the virus.\n\nAD\n\nA panel assembled in the spring was supposed to deliver a report to the University System of Maryland\u2019s Board of Regents this month, but officials don\u2019t expect it to be complete until November, said Tim McDonough, spokesman for the system.\n\n\u201cThe governor demanded a thorough and transparent investigation of the outbreak, and has urged the regents to act quickly for the sake of the Paregol family and the entire campus community,\u201d said Hogan spokeswoman Shareese DeLeaver-Churchill.\n\nIn a letter to the Paregol family\u2019s attorney, Hogan said he told his staff to \u201cfollow up with the University of Maryland and find out why the investigation has not been completed in a timely manner and to express my disappointment in the time it has taken to be responsive to my request.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nIn Elkton Hall, where Paregol lived, first-year students said they haven\u2019t seen mold this school year. Nearly 600 students were forced to evacuate the dorm a year ago.\n\n\u201cThis building, I feel a lot safer in it because I know they did a lot of remodeling,\u201d said Michelle Badolov, 18. \u201cWe have air conditioning and dehumidifiers, which a lot of the other buildings don\u2019t have.\u201d\n\nIsabella Irving, 18, said school leaders emphasized mold prevention when students moved in.\n\n\u201cThat was a big thing they talked about the first weekend we were here,\u201d she said.\n\nProfessors in Woods Hall \u2014 a 70-year-old building that houses the Anthropology Department \u2014 have been complaining about mold for years.\n\nAD\n\nJen Shaffer, an assistant professor, said she stopped meeting with students in her office because she was worried mold might make them sick.\n\nAD\n\nColella said he wasn\u2019t sure whether the conditions in Woods Hall posed a threat to students.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to that faculty [member],\u201d he said.\n\nThe offices Shaffer and her colleagues occupy in the building\u2019s basement will be torn down by next semester to improve air flow, Colella said. The basement will probably be converted into a workspace for graduate students.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a number of things over the years,\u201d Colella said. \u201cEach of them have improved but not adequately.\u201d\n\nSince last year\u2019s mold and adenovirus episodes, U-Md. has started 100 renovation projects in 19 residence halls and 11 sorority and fraternity houses, Colella said. The upgrades include window replacements, dehumidifier installations, heating and air-condition system upgrades, and foundation waterproofing.\n\nAD\n\nThose improvements come amid broader upgrades on Maryland\u2019s public higher education campuses. The University System of Maryland, which oversees the College Park campus and 11 other higher education institutions, said campus presidents plan to spend more than $1.1 billion over the next five years to maintain, renovate and replace buildings.\n\nAD\n\nAbout $640 million was spent the past five years on building infrastructure in the statewide system.\n\n\u201cA primary driver of this [University System of Maryland] focus is providing our students, faculty and staff with healthy, functional, attractive and innovative living and learning environments,\u201d McDonough said. \u201cSuch efforts take into account climate change and would include state-of-the-art building systems.\u201d\n\nUniversity leaders said they are trying to get ahead of problems and respond quicker when they emerge.\n\n\u201cIn all of our spaces for all of our community members, health and safety is our paramount concern, so if there is a situation in a building, or an office or a room that is requiring us to address it, we are addressing it,\u201d Colella said.", "description": "The 50 devices are located in a dozen buildings and come amid other environmental upgrades.", "authors": ["Lauren Lumpkin", "Reporting Fellow Focusing On Local Education Issues"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/zdbUl-cbWotjL9CdEWRdXIgWtEk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KWGZK3W3UQI6PISBBBEDCVSC2A.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
