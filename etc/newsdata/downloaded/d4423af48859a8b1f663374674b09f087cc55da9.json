The timing was smart for Sanders, and will help to fend off the media narrative that his chances are fading. This is a very pundit-y type of observation, so I\u2019ll be brief. But dropping these endorsements after a fairly strong debate for Sanders1 \u2014 and after concerns about the long-term viability of his campaign following his heart attack \u2014 strikes me as smart. It could contribute toward a \u201cBernie comeback!\u201d narrative, especially if Sanders gets a boost in post-debate polls.\n\n4. This is going to intensify intra-left fighting. Want a fairly safe prediction? The primary is going to get nastier. In my read of the various Warren vs. Sanders spats, they\u2019re less about who is further to the left per se and more about how to achieve change, with Warren wanting to work within the Democratic Party and Sanders wanting to upend the Democratic Party and \u201cthe system\u201d overall. (To bring about a \u201cpolitical revolution,\u201d as Sanders might say.) One reason I\u2019ve been skeptical about Sanders\u2019s chances of winning the Democratic nomination is that while seeking to upend the system is perfectly valid as a theory of change, it\u2019s a fairly hard way to win a party primary when the party sets the rules, those rules are designed to achieve consensus rather than to reward factional candidates, and voting is restricted in many states to party members. In any event, because Ocasio-Cortez and Omar have a somewhat anti-establishment message \u2014 although less so than Sanders himself does \u2014 their endorsements are likely to send additional tremors down emerging Sanders-Warren fault lines.", "description": "", "authors": ["Nate Silver", "Fivethirtyeight.Com Features How-The-Aoc-And-Omar-Endorsements-Could-Help-Sanders"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
