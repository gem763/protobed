Only one condition. The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33,000 Emails AFTER getting \u201cC\u201d Subpoena! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2019\n\nFive hours after Trump\u2019s jab, Clinton replied: \u201cDon\u2019t tempt me. Do your job.\u201d\n\nReaction to Clinton\u2019s warning was mixed, to say the least. While mainstream media outlets seemed to love the idea, many social media users recoiled in horror at the thought of a 2016 re-run.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think my heart could take it\u201d if Hillary really runs again, one fan proclaimed on Twitter.\n\nI\u2019m telling you all right now, if @HillaryClinton announces she\u2019s running, I\u2019m going to need someone to rush me to the hospital. I don\u2019t think my heart could take it. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffd\u2764\ufe0f \u2014 Hillary Won (@NYAnna22) October 8, 2019\n\n\u201cShe's really going for that three time loser look,\u201d quipped conservative journalist John Cardillo, a sentiment echoed by many of his colleagues.\n\nC\u2019mon @HillaryClinton - the first concession speech was great! Can\u2019t wait for the second \ud83e\udd23 \u2014 Ryan Fournier (@RyanAFournier) October 8, 2019\n\nThen there were people who saw this as a sign that Clinton was really running, and lamented that 2016 just refused to go away.\n\n2016 is gonna last forever https://t.co/eOIVrGjjZO \u2014 J\ud83c\udf83sh Perry\ud83e\udd18 (@MrJoshPerry) October 8, 2019\n\nOthers urged Twitter to calm down and stop trying to \u201ctroll Hillary into the race,\u201d calling it \u201cnot funny.\u201d\n\nI'd like to humbly request that people stop trying to troll Hillary into the race. That's not funny \u2014 Michael Tracey (@mtracey) October 8, 2019\n\nThe internet is the worst place on earth and we should all feel bad for promoting it. https://t.co/Q1d7w1UAsu \u2014 Brett Banditelli (@banditelli) October 8, 2019\n\nClinton\u2019s partisans often point out that she won 3 million votes more than Trump in 2016, calling him an \u201cillegitimate\u201d president. He won 304 electoral college votes to her 227.\n\nIf you like this story, share it with a friend!", "description": "Hillary Clinton has threatened to enter the 2020 presidential race for president after President Donald Trump suggested on Twitter that she throw her hat in the ring in an effort to \u201csteal it away\u201d from Elizabeth Warren.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5d9d0b5685f5401d1520b26f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
