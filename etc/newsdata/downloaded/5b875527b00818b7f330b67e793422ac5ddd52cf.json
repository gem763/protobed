That was the immortal line in the sand that Jack Nicklaus set. That was the benchmark by which truly great careers are measured. That was what drove Woods through injury and indifferent play.\n\nWhen Woods won his 14th major at the 2008 U.S. Open at 32 years young it was a forgone conclusion that he'd break Jack's mark. The way Woods was going, the record would be his before the end of the decade and he\u2019d be well on his way to establishing a new Grand Slam yardstick.\n\nThe broad strokes of what followed are golf lore.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nInjuries began to impact every aspect of Woods\u2019 life and he started a professional and personal spiral that took him more than a decade from which to fully recover. During that time his chances of catching Jack went from assured to absurd.\n\nIt might have been Nicklaus\u2019 major resume hanging on the wall of Woods\u2019 childhood home in Cypress, Calif., but as Tiger matured and evolved and began to apply the same process-not-outcome logic that makes him such a singular competitor it changed his outlook.\n\nAlong the line, 18 was overshadowed by 82, as in the record number of PGA Tour wins by Sam Snead.\n\nZozo Championship: Full-field scores | Full coverage\n\n\u201cTo kind of get to the 80 mark is a big number. Sam is still ahead of me. I've still got, I feel like, a chance to play some more golf and maybe I'll keep chipping away at that number and maybe surpass it,\u201d Woods said last fall when he ended a lengthy title drought at the Tour Championship. \u201cWhat I've dealt with, I've gotten lucky, to be honest with you. I've gotten very lucky.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nNo. 81 came six months ago at the Masters, when he also moved to within three Grand Slam wins of catching Nicklaus in the major race and prompted prisoners of the moment to announce Jack\u2019s record in peril, again.\n\nBut if we\u2019ve learned anything from 2019, it\u2019s that Woods\u2019 competitive fortunes are relentlessly tied to his general health. He won at East Lake and Augusta National when he was feeling good and struggled with an ailing left knee on his way to an early exit from the playoffs and not a single top-10 finish after June.\n\nHe returned this week following off-season knee surgery looking renewed, and after starting the inaugural Zozo Championship with three consecutive bogeys, he's played the rest of the way in 21 under par for a commanding three-stroke lead with just seven holes to be played Monday.\n\nWoods leads Matsuyama by three with seven holes to play at Zozo Championship\n\nAt 43, we can all agree this isn\u2019t the same player who won a U.S. Open by 15 strokes, but what he\u2019s accomplished this week through weather delays and wild starts feels vintage.\n\nBy the time he signed for a third-round 66 on Sunday, he\u2019d moved three strokes clear of favorite son Hideki Matsuyama. Following a quick bite and wardrobe change he set out for the final round with three birdies through his first six holes and was five strokes clear before the turn.\n\nMatsuyama ignited the crowd with back-to-back birdies to trim that advantage to three strokes, but that did little to keep this from having a foregone feeling.\n\nIn Woods\u2019 prime, those on the receiving end would call it a prevent defense - build a lead and flex while the field scrambles to catch up.\n\n\u201cI figured if I stayed where I was at [to start the day], I was not going to have the lead. I had to make birdies,\u201d said Woods, who was through 11 holes when darkness halted play. \u201cThe golf course was soft, it was pretty benign, and I felt like I just had to continue making birdies.\u201d\n\nIf Woods\u2019 performance this week has a throw-back feel it\u2019s worth revisiting his ridiculously dominant record as a front-runner. He\u2019s 24-for-24 when he takes a lead of three strokes or more into the final round and 43-for-45 when he has the outright lead. It\u2019s the kind of track record that always made Snead\u2019s all-time victory mark first on Woods\u2019 \u201cto do\u201d list.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say Woods\u2019 gaze never drifted to the Golden Bear\u2019s golden benchmark, but in his regimented world you engage the target in front of you and for Woods that was always Snead\u2019s all-time victories mark. The concept is cut from the same inflexibility that wouldn\u2019t allow Tiger to consider the meaning of victory No. 82 just seven holes from the finish line.\n\nChasing 82: Complete list of Tiger's and Snead's PGA Tour wins\n\n\u201cIf I do what I'm supposed to do and get the job done, then I get a W,\u201d Woods reasoned. \u201cI guess that will add up to the 82 number, but my main focus is doing what I need to do to get the W first.\u201d\n\nSlammin\u2019 Sammy was 52 when he won No. 82 in Greensboro in 1965, and he was four years removed from his last victory. Although Snead was wildly successful in his 40s, winning 17 times, the late-in-life victory was very much a surprise.\n\nThe only true surprise Monday is that it took Woods this long to reach No. 82.\n\nProgramming note: Golf Channel will air the conclusion of the final round of the Zozo Championship live at 6:30 p.m. ET.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "People have long been fixated on 18 when it came to Tiger Woods.
