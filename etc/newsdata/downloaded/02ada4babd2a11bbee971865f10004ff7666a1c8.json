Christopher Hasson was amassing weapons to prepare for a major terror attack, bent on murdering civilians \u201con a scale rarely seen in this country.\u201d They also say the 30-year veteran stockpiled assault weapons and compiled a hit list of TV journalists.\n\nYet, they did not charge Lt. Hasson, 50, with any terrorism-related offenses. The indictment was limited to charges of possessing a controlled substance and the possession of an illegal silencer.\n\nIf convicted on the gun and drug charges, Lt. Hasson could face up to 31 years in prison.\n\nLt. Hasson\u2019s attorneys sought to chip away at the firearm charges Monday, by arguing his ownership of a silencer is protected under the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.\n\n\u201cThe Second Amendment speaks of arms, and the courts have found arms have a broad definition,\u201d said Cullen MacBeth, one of Mr. Hasson\u2019s attorneys.\n\nMr. MacBeth told the court that silencers were part of using a weapon effectively and therefore it met the definition of a firearm under U.S. Constitution.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Windom argued that silencers are not covered under the Second Amendment because they are not integral to firearms usage. Under the defense\u2019s argument, he said, nearly anything associated with a gun could be considered a firearm, including \u201clarge-capacity magazines\u201d or earmuffs worn by gun users for hearing protection.\n\n\u201cSilencers are not covered by the Second Amendment,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if they were, this challenge would fail.\u201d\n\nAfter listening to a full day of testimony in the Greenbelt, Maryland, federal courthouse, U.S. District Judge George Hazel said he will issue a ruling later this week.\n\nLt. Hasson\u2019s trial is scheduled to start Oct. 21.\n\nBoth sides presented expert witness testimony to bolster their arguments.\n\nDefense attorneys made a repeated point of detailing a silencer\u2019s uses beyond muffling of a gunshot. Although the domestic terrorism accusations were never specifically addressed, Lt. Hasson\u2019s defense team aimed to undercut those accusations.\n\nOne defense witness, former ATF agent Daniel O\u2019Kelly ticked off uses for a silencer, including hearing protection and increased accuracy.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t hurt anyone with a silencer unless you hit them over the head with it,\u201d he said.\n\nMr. O\u2019Kelly also told the court silencers do not effectively muzzle the sound of a gunshot. He compared to the sound of a shooting a silencer-fitted gun to the noise made by lawnmower or power tool.\n\nLater in the hearing, Lt. Hasson\u2019s attorneys again sought to draw a distinction between terrorism allegations and the actual charges brought by the government.\n\nMr. MacBeth told the court the only accusation lodged against Lt. Hasson was possession of Tramadol, a highly-powerful and illegal pain killer.\n\n\u201cThe only alleged unlawful contact \u2014 consumption of Tramadol \u2014 is just that, alleged,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government has not put on any evidence that Mr. Hasson is dangerous.\u201d\n\nLt. Hasson has been detained in federal custody since his arrest. A magistrate approved a plan to release him back to his family in Virginia, but Judge Hazel overturned the decision.\n\nJudge Hazel said that the time Lt. Hasson posed a danger and \u201cno conditions or combination of conditions will reasonably ensure the safety of the community.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
