At the moment, its cars are able to drive on highways and park autonomously.\n\nTo develop the more advanced \"Level 3\" hands-free automated driving technology, Nissan will need at least until the late 2020s, Tetsuro Ueda, an expert at Nissan's mobility service research center, told reporters this month.\n\n\n\n\n\n'HUGE COMPLEXITIES'\n\nGerman automaker Volkswagen AG <VOWG_p.DE> is also grappling with the size of the challenge.\n\n\"We really thought at the beginning, it would be just maybe next year or so,\" said Aria Etemad, a project manager at Volkswagen Group Research. \"But as we dig into that topic, we see huge complexities that we are facing.\"\n\nTesla is a notable exception to the cautious view. Chief Executive Elon Musk told investors on Wednesday that Tesla could release software to enable \"fully functional full self-driving\" capability by the end of this year.\n\nHowever, Musk qualified that by saying cars would still need to be \"supervised\" by a human driver. By the end of next year, Musk said Tesla hopes to release autonomous driving software \"reliable enough that you do not need to pay attention\". But he added \"acceptance by regulatory authorities will vary by jurisdiction.\"\n\nIt's not just car manufacturers that are tempering expectations. Singapore, a pioneer for practical testing of autonomous vehicles, has struck a more cautious tone.\n\n\"We are not in a rush to be the first adopter,\" Khaw Boon Wan, the transport minister, said this week. \"I look forward to a larger-scale adoption of AV (Autonomous Vehicle) technology in Singapore, but I think this will not be in the near future.\"\n\nThe comments surprised industry experts who view Singapore as the ideal test bed for driverless vehicles given its wealth, small size and top-notch infrastructure. The city state has even created a test zone for driverless vehicles with traffic lights, bus stops and a rain simulator.\n\n\"If Singapore is saying this, then maybe other governments will follow suit,\" said Hussein Dia, professor of future urban mobility at Swinburne University in Melbourne, Australia.\n\n\"Whatever comes out of Singapore, the world watches and listens,\" he added, referring to its driverless expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\nMOTION TESTING\n\nGeneral Motors Co's self-driving unit, Cruise, said earlier this year it was delaying the commercial deployment of cars past its target of 2019 as more testing of the vehicles was required.\n\nStory continues", "description": "When Toyota Motor Corp launches its all-battery Lexus next year, the luxury model will be able to drive autonomously on highways, a big step for the Japanese automaker, which has so far trailed rivals in bringing self-driving cars to market.
