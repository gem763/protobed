This provider of spices, flavors and specialty food items has a record of mixed bottom-line surprises in the trailing four quarters. In the last reported quarter, earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.4%. Let\u2019s see what\u2019s in store for the company in the upcoming quarterly announcement.\n\n\n\nFactors Likely to Impact in Q3\n\n\n\nMcCormick boasts a rich brand portfolio that has strengthened its base business. It is also focused on bolstering footing in the food space through new launches. In fact, the company\u2019s new products are gaining strong retail acceptance that was witnessed in the first and the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Markedly, new product launches are boosting the company\u2019s performance across some key market locations. Health and wellness also continue to drive the company\u2019s innovation agenda. The company adheres to well-chalked marketing and distribution strategies to improve brand performances. In this context, it has been raising spending on digital marketing. Such upsides are likely to add sheen to McCormick\u2019s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, McCormick focuses on saving costs and enhancing productivity through its ongoing Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program. Apart from supporting bottom-line growth, CCI savings are being utilized to increase investments that are generating higher sales. Management expects such efforts to generate cost savings worth $110 million in fiscal 2019, which boosts expectations for the third quarter.\n\n\n\nAlthough the aforementioned aspects are encouraging, there are certain headwinds that are likely to exert pressure on the upcoming quarterly results. In this respect, currency headwinds are a concern. Management expects currency movements to have an adverse impact on performance in fiscal 2019, which raises concerns for the upcoming quarterly results.\n\nMcCormick & Company, Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nHow are Estimates Faring?\n\n\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.29, which suggests an improvement of 0.8% from the year-ago quarter\u2019s level.
