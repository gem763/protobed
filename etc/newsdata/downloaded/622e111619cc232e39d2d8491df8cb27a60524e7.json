Ankara says the zone should be cleared of the YPG.\n\nTurkey says it wants to settle up to 2 million Syrian refugees in the zone. It currently hosts 3.6 million Syrians sheltering from Syria\u2019s more than eight-year conflict.\n\nTurkey says the United States, which supports the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a YPG-led force that defeated Islamic State fighters in Syria, is moving too slowly to set up the zone. It has repeatedly warned of launching an offensive on its own into northeast Syria, where U.S. forces are stationed alongside the SDF.\n\nThe two countries are also at odds over how far the zone should extend into Syria and who should control it. Turkey says it should be 30 km (19 miles) deep.\n\nThe ties between the allies have also been pressured over Turkey\u2019s purchase of Russian S-400 defense missiles and the trial of local U.S. consulate employees in Turkey.", "description": "Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump discussed the planned \"safe zone\" east of the Euphrates River in Syria in a phone call on Sunday, the Turkish presidency said, adding the two men agreed to meet in Washington next month.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191006&t=2&i=1437826842&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF950MG", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
