Before this is contemplated, a company can be told to change its behaviour, fined or have its prices fixed by the Treasurer.\n\nThe laws will expire in 2025 and Mr Taylor said it was unlikely they will ever be used.", "description": "The government's big stick legislation has breezed through the House of Representatives with the support of Labor but Energy Minister Angus Taylor\u00a0said it was unlikely it would ever be wielded.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2795%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_100%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/32fec3d2bd5d0f9aac1d815f25c762c935ad277f", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
