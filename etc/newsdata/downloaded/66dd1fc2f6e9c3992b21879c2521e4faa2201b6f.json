Seeking some sort of favoritism from Washington (like Warren Buffett)?\n\nOr do they genuinely think it\u2019s a good idea to voluntarily send extra cash to the clowns in D.C. ?\n\nI\u2019m not sure how Bill Gates should be classified, but the billionaire is sympathetic to a wealth tax according to news reports.\n\nBill Gates\u2026says he\u2019d be ok with a tax on his assets. In an interview with Bloomberg, Gates was asked if he would support a wealth tax\u2026 Gates said he wouldn\u2019t be opposed to such a measure\u2026 \u201cI doubt, you know, the U.S. will do a wealth tax, but I wouldn\u2019t be against it,\u201d he said. \u2026This isn\u2019t the first time Gates has hinted at supporting a wealth tax, an idea being pushed by Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). In February, Gates told The Verge that tax plans solely focused on income are \u201cmissing the picture,\u201d suggesting the estate tax and taxes on capital should instead be the subject of more progressive rates.\n\nMy reaction is that Gates should lead by example.\n\nA quick web search indicates that Gates is worth $105 billion.\n\nBased on Warren\u2019s proposal for a 3 percent tax on all assets about $1 billion, Gates should put his money where his mouth is and send a $3.12 billion check to Washington.\n\nOr, if Gates really wanted to show his \u201cpatriotism,\u201d he could pay back taxes on his fortune.\n\nCNBC helpfully did the calculations.\n\nA recent paper by two economists who helped Warren create her plan \u2014 University of California, Berkeley professors Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman \u2014 calculated what effect Warren\u2019s plan would have had on America\u2019s richest, including Gates, if it had been imposed starting in 1982 (the first year Forbes magazine began tracking the net worth of the 400 richest Americans) through 2018. Gates, whose fortune was tallied at $97 billion on 2018's Forbes 400 list, would have been worth nearly two-thirds less last year \u2014 a total of only $36.4 billion \u2014 had Warren\u2019s plan been in place for the last three decades. Gates\u2019 current net worth is $105.3 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nIn other words, Gates could show he\u2019s not a hypocrite by sending a check for more than $60 billion to Uncle Sam.\n\nBecause I\u2019m a helpful guy, I\u2019ll even direct him to the website that the federal government maintains for the knaves and fools who think people like Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi should have extra money to squander (my two cents is that they\u2019re the ones with the worst incentive to use money wisely).\n\nNeedless to say, Gates won\u2019t give extra money to Washington.\n\nJust like he won\u2019t fire the dozens (if not hundreds) of financial advisors that he surely employs to protect his income and assets from the IRS.\n\nThe bottom line is that nobody who embraces higher taxes should be taken seriously unless they show us that they\u2019re willing to walk the walk as well as talk the talk.\n\nBased on the behavior of Elizabeth Warren and John Kerry, don\u2019t hold your breath waiting for that to happen.", "description": "Maybe I\u2019m just a curmudgeon, but I get rather irked .09/23/2019 13:13:44PM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
