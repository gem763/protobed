Giuliani to leverage a potential summit between Trump and Zelensky on a promise from the Ukrainians to investigate an energy company, Burisma, that had employed Hunter Biden.\n\nAD\n\nEarly Friday, Ukraine\u2019s chief prosecutor also said he would conduct an \u201caudit\u201d of an investigation related to Burisma.\n\n\u25cfTrump publicly calls on China to investigate Bidens\n\n\u25cfTrump\u2019s removal would require Republican dissidents. But those who speak out become targets of viral disinformation.\n\n\u25cfTrump wanted Ukraine\u2019s president to launch investigations before face-to-face meeting, State Department texts show\n\nAD\n\nRead the whistleblower complaint | The rough transcript of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky | House Democrats\u2019 letter on State Department texts\n\nChat live with Post reporters: The latest on impeachment and Ukraine\n\n12:20 p.m.: Romney criticizes Trump\u2019s \u2018brazen and unprecedented\u2019 appeals to Ukraine, China\n\nSen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) on Friday condemned Trump\u2019s efforts to get Ukraine and China to investigate the Bidens as \u201cwrong and appalling,\u201d breaking ranks with most Republicans on Capitol Hill who have largely avoided criticizing the president.\n\nAD\n\nIn a pair of tweets, Romney referenced that fact that Biden is running for president.\n\n\u201cWhen the only American citizen President Trump singles out for China\u2019s investigation is his political opponent in the midst of the Democratic nomination process, it strains credulity to suggest that it is anything other than politically motivated,\u201d Romney said in one tweet.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBy all appearances, the President\u2019s brazen and unprecedented appeal to China and to Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden is wrong and appalling,\u201d he added in another.\n\n12:05 p.m.: E.U. Ambassador Gordon Sondland gave $1 million to Trump inaugural committee through LLCs\n\nGordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union who\u2019s become a key figure in the Ukraine controversy, has been a longtime donor to the Republican Party, previously supporting the presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and Mitt Romney.\n\nAD\n\nIn the 2016 campaign, he supported Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign and the super PAC supporting Jeb Bush.\n\nWhen Trump became the party\u2019s presumptive nominee, Sondland signed on to the joint finance operation between the campaign and the party as a major fundraiser, or a \u201cbundler\u201d who collects big checks on behalf of the nominee.\n\nAD\n\nSondland was announced as the Oregon and Washington state co-chair of Trump Victory in July 2016. He was listed as a co-host of an August 2016 fundraiser in Seattle in his capacity as Trump Victory co-chair, according to an invitation. Tickets for that fundraisers cost as high as $100,000 per couple.\n\nBut once media outlets reported plans of that fundraiser, Sondland and another Portland hotelier, Bashar Wali, said their names were added without their approval and declined to participate as co-hosts, the Willamette Week reported at the time. The two men said through a Provenance Hotels spokeswoman that they refused to participate due to Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant stance.\n\nAD\n\nSondland eventually donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inaugural committee through four limited-liability companies, state and federal records show. Buena Vista Investments LLC and BV-2 LLC gave $350,000 each, and Dunson Cornerstone Inc. and Dunson Investments LLC gave $150,000 each, inaugural committee records show.\n\nAD\n\nAll four companies are registered in Washington, under Sondland\u2019s name. Sondland was among at least 47 people or corporations who gave $1 million or more to the Trump inaugural committee, which drew $107 million. Sondland\u2019s donations were first reported in 2017 by the Intercept, the Center for Responsive Politics and other outlets.\n\n\u2014 Michelle Ye Hee Lee\n\n12 p.m.: Cornyn tweets that Justice is investigating Biden \u2018conflicts of interest\u2019\n\nSen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) tweeted Friday morning that the Justice Department is \u201cinvestigating foreign government influence, VP Biden conflicts of interest, and possible corruption.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nA spokesman for Cornyn clarified that the senator was referring to the ongoing investigation being conducted by U.S. Attorney John Durham into various activities surrounding the FBI\u2019s Russia probe, but he declined to say whether he had been informed if that investigation included an examination of Biden.\n\nAD\n\nA spokeswoman for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to messages, and an FBI spokeswoman declined to comment.\n\nWhen asked by a reporter later Friday morning if the Justice Department was looking into Biden, Trump said, \u201cWell, that you\u2019d have to ask Attorney General Barr, but I can tell you just as an observer that what I saw Biden do with his son, he\u2019s pillaging these countries, and he\u2019s hurting us.\u201d\n\nThe Biden family\u2019s Ukraine dealings would seem far afield of what has been publicly revealed about Durham\u2019s work. When it was first announced that Barr had tapped Durham to conduct the review, a person familiar with the matter said the prosecutor was seeking to determine if the U.S. government\u2019s \u201cintelligence collection activities\u201d related to the Trump campaign were \u201clawful and appropriate.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA Justice Department spokeswoman said more recently that Durham was \u201cexploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile the Attorney General has yet to contact Ukraine in connection with this investigation, certain Ukrainians who are not members of the government have volunteered information to Mr. Durham, which he is evaluating,\u201d the spokeswoman said.\n\n\u2014 Matt Zapotosky\n\n11:45 a.m.: Trump won\u2019t say whether he\u2019s asked countries to investigate any nonpolitical opponents\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House on Friday, Trump said he didn\u2019t know if he had ever asked a foreign leader to investigate a person who wasn\u2019t his political opponent, though he said he had a right to do so.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cYou know, we would have to look,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut what I looked for and will always ask for is anything having to do with corruption.\u201d\n\nReporters asked him several times if that included enlisting Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s help, but Trump ignored the question.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s okay,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf we feel there is corruption, we have a right to go to a foreign country.\u201d\n\n11:30 a.m.: Trump says Democrats have votes to impeach him in House\n\nTrump told reporters Friday that it appears House Democrats have the votes to impeach him but predicted that he would be acquitted in a trial in the Republican-led Senate.\n\n\u201cThe Democrats unfortunately, they have the votes,\u201d Trump said as he prepared to leave the White House. \u201cThey can vote very easily, even though most of them, many of them, don\u2019t believe they should do it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIf they proceed, they\u2019ll just get their people, they\u2019re all in line, even though many of them don\u2019t want to vote, they have no choice,\u201d Trump added. \u201cThey have to follow their leadership. And then we\u2019ll get it to the Senate, and we\u2019re going to win. The Republicans have been very unified.\u201d\n\nTrump said Democrats would \u201cpay a tremendous price at the polls\u201d for impeaching him.\n\nHe continued to insist that he had done nothing inappropriate during his July call in which he pressed Zelensky to investigate the Bidens.\n\n\u201cWhen I speak to a foreign leader, I speak in an appropriate manner,\u201d Trump said.\n\n10:30 a.m.: Trump shares purported employer of whistleblower in a tweet\n\nIn the midst of several midmorning tweets, Trump identified the purported employer of the whistleblower as the CIA.\n\nIn the tweet, Trump quoted longtime Republican operative Ed Rollins from an appearance on Fox News.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s outrages that a Whistleblower is a CIA Agent,\u201d Trump quoted Rollins as saying, misspelling \u201coutrageous.\u201d\n\nFederal laws offer only limited protection for those in the intelligence community who report wrongdoing \u2014 even when they follow all the rules for doing so.\n\n\u201cIf he wants to destroy this person\u2019s life, there\u2019s not a lot to stop him right now,\u201d whistleblower attorney Bradley P. Moss told The Washington Post last week.\n\nBoth The Post and the New York Times have published stories identifying the whistleblower as a CIA officer, drawing objections from the whistleblower\u2019s lawyers, who say he is entitled to anonymity under the law.\n\n10 a.m.: Trump camp to air anti-Biden ads in key early primary states\n\nBeginning this weekend, the Trump campaign is airing more than $1 million worth of TV ads in early primary states that accuse Joe Biden and his son Hunter of corruption in Ukraine, according to Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s campaign manager.\n\nThe commercials will air in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada, Parscale tweeted.\n\nThe anti-Biden ads are part of a larger $8 million ad buy focused on impeachment, which the Trump camp is trying to spin to its advantage.\n\nCNN said Thursday it would not run the ad because the allegations of corruption against the Bidens highlighted in the ad are unsubstantiated.\n\n9:50 a.m.: Intelligence community inspector general meeting with Congress about whistleblower complaint\n\nMichael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community, will appear before the House Intelligence Committee on Friday to discuss the complaint from a whistleblower that touched off the impeachment probe against Trump.\n\nHe arrived on Capitol Hill shortly before 10 a.m. for a scheduled 10:30 a.m. hearing.\n\nThe hearing is necessary \u201cto establish additional details, leads and evidence\u201d in the probe, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) wrote in a letter to colleagues last week. The hearing will not be public.\n\nIG at center of impeachment inquiry promised robust whistleblower protections when he took job\n\n\u201cWe have to flesh out all of the facts for the American people. The seriousness of the matter and the danger to our country demands nothing less,\u201d Schiff wrote.\n\nAtkinson alerted Schiff and other congressional committee leaders to the whistleblower\u2019s complaint last month, but at the time, acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire would not allow Atkinson to share the full complaint with the committees.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Shane Harris, Rachael Bade and Karoun Demirjian\n\n9 a.m.: House Republicans object to White House subpoena\n\nRepublicans on the House Oversight Committee on Friday made public a letter to Chairman Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.) in which they objected to his threatened subpoena of White House records related to Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky.\n\n\u201cYou decided to issue this subpoena without consulting Republicans and without allowing Members to debate the terms of the subpoena,\u201d the Republicans wrote in the letter, dated Thursday. \u201cYour memorandum cherry-picks and misstates information to propagate a misleading narrative about the President\u2019s actions. We object strongly to the issuance of this subpoena and your stated reasons for issuing it.\u201d\n\nCummings said earlier this week he would issue a subpoena if the White House didn\u2019t reply with document requests by Friday.\n\n8:50 a.m.: Trump seizes on unemployment rate in arguing against impeachment\n\nTrump seized the release of new unemployment numbers Friday morning to argue against his impeachment.\n\n\u201cBreaking News: Unemployment Rate, at 3.5%, drops to a 50 YEAR LOW,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWow America, lets impeach your President (even though he did nothing wrong!).\u201d\n\nTrump made no mention that the same report showed the economy adding a modest 136,000 jobs in September, in what is likely to be interpreted as further evidence that the country is headed for a slowdown.\n\nU.S. economy added just 136,000 jobs in September, in fresh sign economy is cooling\n\n8:25 a.m.: Schiff says Republicans must decide if Trump has \u2018absolute right\u2019 he claims\n\nIn a morning tweet, Schiff responded to Trump\u2019s late-night assertion that he has an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to enlist foreign countries in corruption investigations.\n\nTrump\u2019s contention, in a tweet, came at the end of a day in which he publicly urged both Ukraine and China to investigate the business dealings of Hunter Biden.\n\n\u201cIt comes down to this,\u201d Schiff tweeted. \u201cWe\u2019ve cut through the denials. The deflections. The nonsense. Donald Trump believes he can pressure a foreign nation to help him politically. It\u2019s his \u2018right.\u2019 Every Republican in Congress has to decide: Is he right?\u201d\n\nMinutes after Schiff\u2019s tweet, Trump doubled down on his assertion.\n\n\u201cAs President I have an obligation to end CORRUPTION, even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIt is done all the time. This has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens. This does have to do with their corruption!\u201d\n\n6:45 a.m.: Ukraine\u2019s new chief prosecutor to \u2018audit\u2019 Biden case\n\nKIEV, Ukraine \u2014 Ukraine\u2019s new chief prosecutor said Friday his office will conduct an \u201caudit\u201d of an investigation into Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company that had recruited Hunter Biden for its board.\n\nA criminal probe of the company was closed in 2016, and Trump has alleged it was because of pressure by Hunter Biden\u2019s father, Joe Biden, who was then vice president. Trump has insisted that Ukraine open a new investigation.\n\nUkrainian officials said previously that the probe was focused on the years 2010 to 2012, before the younger Biden joined the board. They also have said that there is no evidence of any wrongdoing on his part.\n\nProsecutor General Ruslan Ryaboshapka told a news conference that he is aware of at least 15 investigations that may have touched on Burisma, its owner Nikolai Zlochevsky, an associate named Serhiy Zerchenko, and Biden, and that all will be reviewed. He said no foreign or Ukrainian official has been in touch with him to request this audit.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Will Englund\n\n6:30 a.m.: Trump wanted Ukraine\u2019s president to launch investigations before face-to-face meeting, texts show\n\nHouse investigators released numerous text messages late Thursday night illustrating how senior State Department officials coordinated with the Ukrainian president\u2019s top aide and Trump\u2019s personal lawyer to leverage a potential summit between the heads of state on a promise from the Ukrainians to investigate the 2016 U.S. election and an energy company that employed Biden\u2019s son.\n\nThe texts, which former special U.S. envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker provided investigators during a nearly 10-hour deposition Thursday, reveal that officials felt Trump would not agree to meet with Zelensky unless Zelensky promised to launch the investigations \u2014 and did so publicly.\n\nAlthough the texts do not mention Biden by name, congressional Democrats leading an impeachment inquiry are pointing to them as clear evidence that Trump conditioned normal bilateral relations with Ukraine on that country first agreeing \u201cto launch politically motivated investigations,\u201d top Democrats said in a statement Thursday night.\n\n\u201cheard from White House \u2014 assuming President Z convinces trump he will investigate / \u2018get to the bottom of what happened\u2019 in 2016, we will nail down date for visit to Washington,\u201d Volker texted Zelensky\u2019s aide, Andrey Yermak, on July 25, hours before Trump and the Ukrainian president spoke via phone.\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Karoun Demirjian, Rachael Bade, Josh Dawsey and John Hudson\n\n6 a.m.: Trump asserts \u2018absolute right\u2019 to investigate corruption\n\nTrump on Thursday night asserted an \u201cabsolute right\u201d to investigate corruption, which he said includes reaching out to foreign countries for assistance, and suggested that he might sue House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif).\n\nHe comments on Twitter came hours after he told reporters that he would like to see investigations of the Bidens not only by Ukraine but also China, prompting an uproar from congressional Democrats.\n\n\u201cAs the President of the United States, I have an absolute right, perhaps even a duty, to investigate, or have investigated, CORRUPTION, and that would include asking, or suggesting, other Countries to help us out!\u201d Trump wrote on Twitter.\n\nLater, he took aim at Pelosi for standing by Schiff\u2019s comments in a hearing last week.\n\nTrump has called for Schiff to resign for remarks in which he embellished Trump\u2019s phone call with Zelensky. Schiff later said his remarks were intended as a parody and that Trump should have recognized that.\n\nPelosi defended Schiff during an interview with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos that aired Thursday morning on \u201cGood Morning America,\u201d saying his remarks were \u201cfair.\u201d\n\n\u201cNancy Pelosi today, on @GMA, actually said that Adam Schiffty Schiff didn\u2019t fabricate my words in a major speech before Congress,\u201d Trump said in his tweet. \u201cShe either had no idea what she was saying, in other words lost it, or she lied. Even Clinton lover @GStephanopoulos strongly called her out. Sue her?\u201d\n\n5 a.m.: Members of Congress getting pressed on developments back home\n\nWith Congress in recess, House and Senate members are getting pressed on developments in the Ukraine controversy while back home.\n\nHere is a video of Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) responding to a constituent Thursday night at a town hall in Templeton, Iowa, who asked a pointed question about the president: \u201cWhen are you guys going to say, \u2018Enough?\u2019\u201d\n\n5 a.m.: CNN declines to run Trump campaign ads\n\nCNN said Thursday that it will not run two Trump campaign ads because they disparage the network\u2019s journalists and make \u201cdemonstrably false\u201d claims while discussing impeachment and pushing unsubstantiated allegations of corruption against Biden.\n\nThe network\u2019s decisions come as the Trump administration escalates its attacks on congressional Democrats\u2019 impeachment efforts and continues to lash out at media organizations it tries to discredit as \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nCNN\u2019s move brought renewed ire from Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, as Communications Director Tim Murtaugh called the news network a \u201cDemocrat public relations firm\u201d that \u201cspends all day protecting Joe Biden.\u201d\n\nRead more here.\n\n\u2014 Hannah Knowles", "description": "The fallout continued Friday from the late-night release of text messages by House investigators relevant to the Ukraine controversy, and a key figure was testifying behind closed doors on Capitol Hill.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "Congress", "Campaigns", "Health Policy", "Pennsylvania Politics"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Aa7RKODuu5SWe654p988n5VswxM=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NEEFVSHF54I6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
