Then I had a chat with him, and he revealed he had run away and needed help,\" bar owner Chris Westerbeek told RTV.\n\n\"He said he had brothers and sisters who lived at the farm. He said he was the oldest and wanted to end the way they were living.\"\n\nA woman from animal ambulance holds cat carriers at the site of a remote farm where a family spent years in isolation. (Eva Plevier/Reuters)\n\nThe bar owner and the man called the police together, Feitsma said.\n\nOfficers soon swarmed the farmhouse and found the other family members. That's when RTV became alerted to the fact that something strange was happening in the village.\n\n\"As a local broadcast service we have, of course, [many] contacts in this area. We work here every day, and we had different sources that came to us and asked about this police ... investigation going on at the house,\" Feitsma said.\n\n\"People thought it would be murder or anything because there were so many [police] cars. So we were digging into this story and we found some answers.\"\n\nBut they also found a lot more questions.\n\n'A lot of speculation'\n\nAuthorities have not released the suspect's name, but RTV has identified him Jozef B., a 58-year-old man from Austria.\n\n\"He was kind of a carpenter. So he looked after the house and looked after the garden,\" Feitsma said. \"He was just some kind of a neighbour who was appearing every morning, going to his work and leaving every evening, and taking care of the house.\"\n\nVillagers told Feitsma they'd tried to get to know him, but that he always kept to himself.\n\n\"In this region, it's also a tradition to welcome new neighbours \u2014 and they tried,\" she said. \"They have been talking to this Jozef, ordered him a bottle of wine, ordered him some flowers to get in touch with him but he wasn't interested.\"\n\nRuinerwold Mayor Roger de Groot told reporters the suspect is not the father of the family, and that the mother of the children was believed to have died before the family moved to the Dutch farm in 2010.\n\nNone of the family members were registered as residents with the municipality, the police statement said.\n\nSome villages have told Feitsma and her colleagues that the family may have held apocalyptic \"end of days\" beliefs, but neither police nor reporters have been able to confirm this.\n\n\"There is a lot of speculation in the media about what happened, but as police we deal with facts. We still have a lot of unanswered questions,\" Drenthe police spokeswoman Grietje Hartstra said.\n\nFeitsma says she has a lot of unanswered questions too.\n\n\"We are worried about the condition of these [people]. Are they safe? Are they able to function in the society once again or are they very traumatized?\" she said. \"Those kind of questions are still open.\"\n\nWritten by Sheena Goodyear with files from Reuters.
