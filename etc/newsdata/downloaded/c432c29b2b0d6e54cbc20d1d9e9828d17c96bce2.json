They're more interesting than the generic high-rise apartments.\"\n\nMs Gould said Redfern was poised to see further growth thanks to its proximity to the emerging tech hub of South Eveleigh where major companies such as the Commonwealth Bank are relocating to.\n\nDemand for lifestyle suburbs also fuelled strong gains in NSW's Kangaroo Valley, south of Sydney, where median house prices hopped 19.2 per cent to $1,042,927 between June and September.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's a similar picture in Beaumaris in Victoria where the median unit price climbed by 14.7 per cent in just three months fuelled by buyers seeking out properties in the bayside suburb.\n\nAinslie, the only suburb in the ACT to join the million-dollar club for the first time, racked up 10.8 per cent capital growth over the same period amid growing demand and low housing supply in the area.\n\nAustralia's newly minted million-dollar suburbs", "description": "Sixty-eight Australian suburbs have crossed the million-dollar median price mark since June, boosted by record low interest rates.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.299%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_96/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c4221152e5cfbb8d753371c17f2df6c70fa2ff58", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
