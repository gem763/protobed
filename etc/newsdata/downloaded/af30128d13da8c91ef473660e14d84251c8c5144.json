On Monday morning, it was revealed that Booking Holdings - the firm behind Booking.com - had also pulled out.\n\nThe remaining 21 members all confirmed their commitment to the project at the Geneva meeting. Among them are rideshare firms Uber and Lyft, prominent venture capital firms Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures, music streaming service Spotify, and the sales and services arm of telecoms company Vodafone.\n\nNetherlands-based PayU is the only remaining member operating in the online payments processing sector.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the design of the Libra ecosystem has the potential to address a number of societal needs,\u201d a PayU spokesperson said, in a statement sent out by the Libra Association.\n\nSearch on for CEO\n\nOf the 21 companies, representatives from five of the firms were elected to form the Libra Association\u2019s board, with Facebook\u2019s David Marcus among them. Bertrand Perez, a former senior director at PayPal, was appointed chief operating officer and interim managing director.\n\nThe board would soon set up a search committee to appoint a permanent chief executive, Mr Disparte said.\n\nHe added that many more firms were interested in joining the association.\n\n\u201cMore than 1,500 organisations have expressed an interest in joining this effort,\u201d Mr Disparte said.\n\n\u201cEven though aspects of that have been difficult in the last few months.\u201d\n\nIn response to mounting concerns, Facebook\u2019s chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has been called to appear before a congressional panel on 23 October to discuss Libra, and likely other issues involving his firm.\n\n_____\n\nFollow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC\n\nDo you have more information about this or any other technology story?
