We suggest getting cozy and flipping on Netflix\u2019s new original series Daybreak, which takes place in a post-apocalyptic teen-run Glendale, California.\n\nThe show is certainly Walking Dead-esque, but it\u2019s also a comedy. And while the palm trees may have survived, all of the adults have turned into zombies called \u201cghoulies.\u201d Without their parents to keep them in line, teenagers are left to their own devices and forced to make their own rules. There\u2019s plenty of newfound freedom, but it appears there\u2019s plenty of trouble to get into too.\n\nThe trailer follows Josh (Colin Ford), who goes on a sword-wielding mission to find his girlfriend Sam who\u2019s gone missing in all the madness. He and his friends have to get creative if they want to survive not only the ghoulies, but the high school social castes that still remain \u2014 as jocks, nerds, and cheerleaders have seemingly all banded together in their chosen families. The rivalries are more intense than ever. \u201cSo what\u2019s life like in the apocalypse?\u201d Sam asks. \u201cIt\u2019s never what you\u2019d expect?\u201d\n\nThe show, which also stars Alyvia Alyn Lind, Austin Crute, Sophie Simnett, and Chelsea Zhang, premieres on Netflix on October 24.", "description": "Watch the trailer for \u2018Daybreak,\u2019 which has all your typical high school drama and plenty of gore.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5d9ce77332c8720009a7df39/lede/1570564173212-DAYBREAK_103_Unit_01725RC.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.843xh;0xw,0.147xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
