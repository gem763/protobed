They said he has been living in an inner west community of Sydney, after being released on parole last year, with a strict ongoing monitoring period of three years.\n\nHis details are currently being shared to social media after the posters were found being \u201cshared locally\u201d in the Sydney community.\n\nThe posters included highly detailed information about the male offender, and urged members of the public to read further material about him. He has previously been found guilty of a string of violent crimes, including two different serious sexual offences, for which he has served time in prison. Since being released, he has once been convicted for breaching his parole.\n\nThe man was recommended parole with strict conditions, including monitoring by an ankle bracelet, imposed on him for a period of years, beginning in 2018.\n\nThe posters exposed the offender\u2019s new address, and recommended a series of articles which detailed his crimes.\n\nThe man has been linked to burglaries and two violent rapes in the 1990s. Now aged in his fifties, he has a criminal record which dates back to his teenage years.\n\nNews.com.au understands that putting up the posters is not an offence, but anything that might incite violence against an individual is considered illegal.\n\nSimilar posters, targeting a different individual, were recently put up in another area in Sydney\u2019s south.\n\nA spokesperson for NSW Police told news.com.au they are aware of the posters and urged members of the public not to take the law into their own hands.\n\n\u201cPolice are aware of reports of flyers circulating in the inner west area,\u201d a spokesperson for NSW Police said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe would encourage the community not to attempt to take the law into their own hands, as you may be committing an offence.\n\n\u201cOfficers from Inner West Police Area Command are conducting inquiries.\u201d\n\nThere is currently no public register of sex offenders deemed \u201chigh risk\u201d in Australia.\n\nPeter Dutton proposed the establishment of a National Public Register of Child Sex Offenders \u2014 making certain key information about known offenders publicly available \u2014 in January of this year.\n\nThe goal of the public register is to improve national protections for children. There is no suggestion the man targeted in the posters was a paedophile or had committed crimes involving minors.\n\n\u201cIt would have a strong deterrent effect on offenders and ensure that parents are not in the dark about whether a registered sex offender has access to their children,\u201d Mr Dutton said at the start of the year.\n\n\u201cThe abuse and exploitation of children is a global epidemic that is becoming more prevalent, more organised and more extreme.\n\n\u201cThwarting that exploitation is a key priority for me as Minister for Home Affairs. I have always fought for the protection of children and this is a battle that we must win.\u201d\n\nThe proposal by Dutton concerns itself specifically with those offenders who have abused children.", "description": "Posters plastered throughout a Sydney neighbourhood have led to police issuing a warning about members of the public exposing criminals in their local areas.", "authors": ["Phoebe Loomes"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/b0250c155f2ac458dd0449d0627479e8?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
