NBA!\" and \"We love basketball!\".\n\nIn a cricket-loving nation, basketball has long struggled to make a mark, and the NBA launched a campaign to expand its fanbase to India before the pre-season games between the Sacramento Kings and the Indiana Pacers.\n\nMumbai's iconic landmark, the Gateway of India, was lit up in red, white and blue, and a basketball court floated off the coast of the city in the Arabian Sea as part of its publicity drive.\n\nAs Indiana Pacers power forward Myles Turner, who helped his team to victories on Friday and Saturday, put it: \"When you think of basketball, you don't necessarily think of India.\"\n\nBut the 7,000 sold-out seats and howls of enthusiasm at Saturday's match suggested that, at least for some Indians, basketball matters.\n\n\"It was an exhilarating experience ... a brilliant experience,\" said 22-year-old graduate student Akash Saraswati, who saved up for his ticket costing more than $90.\n\nIf these first two NBA games in India are any indication, there is a strong fan base looking forward to more quality basketball games [Justin Nisly/Al Jazeera] If these first two NBA games in India are any indication, there is a strong fan base looking forward to more quality basketball games [Justin Nisly/Al Jazeera]\n\nDie-hard fans\n\nEven a broken leg could not stop him from travelling to Mumbai from the neighbouring city of Pune. \"I didn't hesitate,\" he said.\n\nMany of those who packed the stands were die-hard fans like Saraswati, travelling from as far afield as New Delhi and Bengaluru.\n\n\"There's so much grace and effortless coordination among the players. It's beautiful to watch,\" said sales executive Rajesh Kamble, who admitted he was still trying to understand the sport.\n\nBollywood songs alternated with American hip-hop tracks at the star-studded events, where celebrities like actress Priyanka Chopra mingled with NBA legends like Larry Bird.\n\nBefore the first game, US Ambassador to India Kenneth I Juster said he looked forward to \"sharing the magic of professional basketball with millions of new fans\".\n\nBut questions remain about how much the NBA - whose 2017-18 season revenue was a staggering $8bn according to Forbes - is willing to invest in India and whether its audience will be restricted to hardcore fans and wealthy urbanites.\n\nAdam Silver, the NBA commissioner, said that he is giving \"serious consideration\" to launching a professional league in India.\n\nIndia league\n\nKings owner Vivek Ranadive - the first and only Indian majority owner of an NBA team who led the effort to bring the pre-season games to India - suggested that the new league be called Monsoon Madness, a play on the US college basketball tournament March Madness.\n\nWhile India has a long way to go to create the infrastructure needed to support a professional league, Silver said it could potentially get off the ground within the next five years.\n\nThe NBA has long sought to expand its footprint in India. In 2011, they partnered with Indian channel Sony TEN to air hundreds of games on live television and started a series of youth development programmes and an NBA Academy outside of the capital, New Delhi.\n\nDiane Gotua, the NBA's vice president of global business operations, said that an Indian professional league would be \"the next logical step\". \"To play, you just need a ball and a hoop.\"\n\nBut, unlike cricket which is played everywhere from India's slums to members' clubs, basketball enjoys a limited appeal in the country of 1.3 billion people. No Indian player has ever taken part in an NBA game.\n\nThe cheapest ticket for Saturday's game cost 4,500 rupees ($63.5), going up to an astonishing 85,000 rupees ($1,200) for courtside seats. In comparison, a season pass for next week's second cricket Test between India and South Africa in Pune tops out at 5,000 rupees ($70.5).\n\nBut the high price did not deter many sport fans. Chitraj Grover, a young college graduate who just started a job as an engineer, said he spent his first paycheque ever on flying to the game from New Delhi.\n\nWith two matches played to a packed stadium, Indians seem to have embraced a new sport.\n\nClive Machado, a young fan from Mumbai, perhaps portrayed the NBA's optimism about expanding into India. When asked if he was a basketball fan, he replied, \"soon to be!\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Namrata Kolachalam from Mumbai", "description": "In a cricket-loving nation, NBA wants to make a mark with two games between Sacramento Kings and Indiana Pacers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/6/0c29ce3a742440c8a19899b4960e4086_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
