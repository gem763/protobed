A look at just one vitally important post \u2014 national-security adviser \u2014 tells the story.\n\nWith the ouster on Tuesday of John Bolton (next stop: \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d?) and the appointment of Charlie Kupperman as acting national-security adviser, Trump is now on his fifth guy. This includes convicted felon Mike Flynn, who\u2019s scheduled to be sentenced in December for lying to the FBI about his dealings with Russia.\n\nFive security advisers in 32 months \u2014 months. Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton had seven in 24 years. Combined. Richard Nixon Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter and George H.W. Bush combined had four in 16 years. And, again, that\u2019s one key job.\n\nInstability, uncertainty, lack of coherence and lack of clarity are not conducive to keeping the nation safe.\n\nWhere we stand\n\nTrump has lurched from one adviser to the next, talking loudly about everything he would do, and yet here we are nearly three years in and here\u2019s where we stand:\n\n\u2022 North Korea has built more nuclear weapons.\n\n\u2022 Iran has taken advantage of Trump\u2019s pullout from the P5+1 agreement to move closer to having a weapon of its own.\n\n\u2022 A growing trans-Atlantic rift is Vladimir Putin\u2019s wildest fantasy come true.\n\n\u2022 And rather than kowtowing to Trump like Trump said it would (\u201cTrade wars are easy to win,\u201d he foolishly bragged), China has instead accelerated its \u201cChina 2025\u201d program, designed to gain dominance over America in artificial intelligence, 5G, robotics, aerospace, pharmaceuticals and all the rest.\n\nTrump has had some successes, but they are few and of the lower-level variety.\n\nMeantime, does anyone remember Franklin D. Roosevelt inviting Tojo over after Pearl Harbor to talk things over? How about the time when George W. Bush and then Barack Obama extended an olive branch to Osama bin Laden and invited him to Camp David? Such a hoot.\n\nWait \u2014 none of that happened.\n\nYet Trump thinks it\u2019s a swell idea to invite the Taliban \u2014 the same terrorists who have been harboring al Qaeda and murdering Americans for years \u2014 to Camp David. Why not treat them to a ride on Air Force One and throw them a state dinner while he\u2019s at it?\n\nSurprising twist\n\nWhich brings us to this observation: Trump has been called many things, but here\u2019s something you may find new: When it comes to foreign policy, he\u2019s a left-wing radical. You heard me: Trump\u2019s a major-league leftie.\n\nAfter all, Trump, as president:\n\n\u2022 Has questioned the role of NATO, and even suggested that America could get out of the 70-year-old military alliance.\n\n\u2022 Eagerly set foot in North Korea, and praised its murderous leader \u2014 and killer of Americans \u2014 Kim Jong Un. Trump has said he respects him, and, what\u2019s more: \u201cWe fell in love.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Has tried to curry favor with Kim by criticizing U.S.\u2013South Korean military exercises as financially wasteful.\n\n\u2022 Said he\u2019d talk with the leaders of Iran without preconditions.\n\n\u2022 And, of course, praises dictators galore: Russia\u2019s Putin, China\u2019s Xi Jinping and every other global rogue he can find, at every opportunity.\n\nOf course, the Obama administration, too, was willing to talk with Iran without preconditions, but can you recall Obama saying he fell in love with Hassan Rouhani, let alone Kim, or that we should get out of NATO? He didn\u2019t.\n\nTrump is also much further to the left on foreign policy than another president he likes to malign: Jimmy Carter. Carter personally forged a peace deal between Israel and Egypt \u2014 doing more to secure Israel\u2019s security than Trump has ever done. (What has he done, exactly, anyway?)\n\nTough on Russians\n\nCarter was also tough on the Russians. After Moscow invaded Afghanistan in 1979, Carter cut off shipments of food, killed an arms-control deal, boycotted the Moscow Olympics, and began arming the mujahadeen. Reagan supporters take credit for the latter, but, in his memoir \u201cFrom the Shadows,\u201d Robert Gates, the former defense secretary and CIA director, points out that it actually began on Carter\u2019s watch.\n\nLike I said: On foreign policy, Trump is far-left guy. Barack Obama, Jimmy Carter \u2014 all the guys Trump sneers at \u2014 were actually to the right of him, and got more done.\n\nThe ouster of Bolton is a good thing. He is a lifelong warmonger who never saw an armed conflict he didn\u2019t like. The fear that he would drag Trump into a new war \u2014 Iran has always been Public Enemy No. 1 in Bolton\u2019s eyes \u2014 has gone.\n\nThe questions now: Who will be the new Trump whisperer, and how long will he or she last?", "description": "When it comes to foreign policy Donald Trump is a left-wing radical, writes Paul Brandus.", "authors": ["Paul Brandus"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR032_bolton_ZG_20190910151147.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
