(AP Photo/David Goldman)\n\nThe portion of Americans with no religious affiliation is rising significantly, in tandem with a sharp drop in the percentage that identifies as Christians, according to new data from the Pew Research Center.\n\nBased on telephone surveys conducted in 2018 and 2019, Pew said Thursday that 65% of American adults now describe themselves as Christian, down from 77% in 2009. Meanwhile, the portion that describes their religious identity as atheist, agnostic or \"nothing in particular,\" now stands at 26%, up from 17% in 2009.\n\nBoth Protestant and Roman Catholic ranks are losing population share, according to Pew. It said 43% of U.S. adults identify as Protestants, down from 51% in 2009, while 20% are Catholic, down from 23% in 2009.\n\nPew says all categories of the religiously unaffiliated population - often referred to as the \"nones\" grew in magnitude. Self-described atheists now account for 4% of U.S. adults, up from 2% in 2009; agnostics account for 5%, up from 3% a decade ago; and 17% of Americans now describe their religion as \"nothing in particular,\" up from 12% in 2009.\n\nThe report comes at a challenging time for many major denominations in the U.S. The two largest \u2014 the Catholic church and the Southern Baptist Convention \u2014 are beset by clergy sex-abuse scandals. The United Methodist Church, the largest mainline Protestant denomination, faces a possible split over differences on the inclusion of LGBTQ people.\n\nThe Pew report found a steady decline in the rates of attendance at religious services.\n\nOver the last decade, the share of Americans who say they attend religious services at least once or twice a month dropped by 7 percentage points, while the share who say they attend religious services less often \u2014 if at all \u2014 rose by the same degree.\n\nIn 2009, regular attenders \u2014 those who attend religious services at least once a month \u2014 outnumbered those who attend services only occasionally or not at all by a 52%-to-47% margin. Now, more Americans say they attend religious services a few times a year or less (54 that say they attend at least monthly (45%).\n\nPew's data showed a wide age gap in terms of religion affiliation \u2014 three-quarters of baby boomers described themselves as Christian, compared to 49% of millennials.\n\nThe trends documented by Pew have been reflected in other recent developments.\n\nIn May, the Southern Baptist Convention reported its twelfth year of declining membership. The SBC said it had 14.8 million members in 2018, down about 192,000 from the previous year.\n\nIn June, the annual Giving USA report \u2014 a comprehensive overview of Americans' charitable giving patterns \u2014 said giving to religious institutions had been lagging behind other philanthropic sectors for several years. Reasons included declining attendance at worship services and a rising number of Americans not affiliated with any religion.\n\nEmpty Tomb, a Christian organization based in Champaign, Illinois, that researches religious giving, says the decline is longstanding. According to its research, Americans gave about 3% of their disposable income to churches in 1968, and less than 2.2% in 2016.", "description": "The portion of Americans with no religious affiliation is rising significantly, in tandem with a sharp drop in the percentage that identifies as Christians, according to new data from the Pew Research Center.
