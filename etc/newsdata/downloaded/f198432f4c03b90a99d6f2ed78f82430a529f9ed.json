Those experts say the current level, 15 parts per billion (ppb), is too high to meaningfully reduce the blood lead levels of children who are exposed.\n\nInstead of lowering the lead action level, the rule establishes a new two-tier system for addressing lead contamination. When a city\u2019s water hits a new 10 ppb \u201ctrigger\u201d level, cities would be required to reevaluate their water treatment and possibly add corrosion control chemicals to city water.\n\nThe agency is touting the new trigger level of 10 ppb, saying it would \u201cenable systems to react more quickly should they exceed the 15 ppb action level in the future.\" Only at 15 ppb must cities begin to replace their water system's pipes.\n\nUnder the new proposal, cities would be required to replace 3 percent of lead service lines each year, a number far lower than the current requirement of 7 percent.\n\nCritics worry the EPA is just easing regulations on how quickly cities must replace their pipes.\n\n\u201cIt's really just like window dressing to try to make it look like they were being much more stringent when in fact the real action level stayed exactly the same, and they lowered the percent of upgrades to 3 percent from 7 percent. That's very disappointing,\u201d said Betsy Southerland, who was director of Office of Science and Technology at the EPA\u2019s Office of Water under the Obama administration.\n\nThe new EPA rule does not account for lead in pipes in people's homes, leaving it up to individuals to voluntarily replace and pay for any lead pipes in their own homes.\n\nHigh levels of lead exposure when ingested can be extremely harmful and even cause death. Lead exposure is especially worrisome for children, who can experience cognitive disorders and neurological defects when exposed at certain levels.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there's no safe level of lead in children's blood.\n\nWorries about lead exposure from drinking water gained new attention in 2015 after the water contamination scandal in Flint, Mich.\n\nWheeler has previously said the Obama administration waited too long to act in Flint, where residents were drinking water with alarming levels of lead.\n\n\"Part of the problem with Flint was there was a breakdown in once they got the data, once the city of Flint, the state of Michigan, the Obama EPA \u2013 they sat on it,\" Wheeler told CBS in March. \"We're not doing that. As soon as we get information that there's a problem, we're stepping in, we're helping the local community get that water system cleaned up.\"\n\nUpdated at 1:50 p.m.", "description": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is set to propose an overhaul to a decades-old rule on testing for lead contamination in drinking water.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/waterglass_pfas_052419istock.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
