Vazquez Villegas and 49-year-old Anthony L. Manson. The identity of the fourth fatal victim is still unknown.\n\nStephen Miller, 28, said he would try to give him a pork bun every day, or as often as he could.\n\n'This guy never did anything, just had a life to live. It sucks that he's out here in the rain and everything but it doesn't mean he doesn't have a life to live.'\n\nShirley Ng, 52, told the New York Post during a vigil in Chinatown that Kok was an immigrant from Hong Kong and only spoke Cantonese.\n\n'He was a very gentle man. He never asked for anything. You'd talk to him - he was just a peaceful man,' Ng said.\n\n'He was brutally attacked while just trying to sleep \u2014 something we all do. He died sleeping in hopes of waking up to see what lies ahead tomorrow,' she said.\n\nThe medical examiner said all four died of blunt impact head trauma with skull fractures and brain injury.
