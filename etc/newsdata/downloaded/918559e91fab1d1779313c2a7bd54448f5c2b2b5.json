Faster growth in 2020 would depend on a better performance by a number of troubled emerging countries \u2013 such as Argentina and Turkey \u2013 the Fund said.\n\nGita Gopinath, the Fund\u2019s economic counsellor, said that without the interest rates cuts announced by central banks in both developed and developing countries in recent months its growth forecast would be 0.5 points lower.\n\nBut she added that the growth boost from the stimulus only partly offset the 0.8% hit to activity caused by a trade conflict between the US and China that has become more serious since it began in March 2018.\n\n\u201cWith central banks having to spend limited ammunition to offset policy mistakes, they may have little left when the economy is in a tougher spot,\u201d Gopinath said in the WEO\u2019s foreword.\n\nProfile What is the IMF? Show Hide What is the IMF? The International Monetary Fund, created in 1945, is an organisation of 189 countries based in Washington DC. It is governed by, and accountable, to member countries.\n\nIts goals are to ensure the stability of the international monetary system (exchange rates and international payments), to secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty.\n\nThe IMF has bailed out scores of countries over the years, including the UK in 1976 when the minority Labour government borrowed \u00a32.3bn from the fund to stabilise the value of the pound; Iceland in 2008; and Greece in 2010, 2012 and 2015.\u200b The number of bailouts of African countries has also increased in recent years as states became more vulnerable to commodity price crashes.\n\nThe IMF was conceived at a UN conference in Bretton Woods in the US in July 1944 to build a framework for economic cooperation to avoid the devaluations that contributed to the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n\n\u200bMost funds for IMF loans are provided by members via payments based on their position in the world economy, although the IMF can also borrow. Its decision-making also reflects members' relative influence. The Fund, as it is known, is one of the world\u2019s biggest holders of gold.

No other G7 country is expected to have a growth rate of more than 2%.\n\nBritain\u2019s growth rate is predicted to be 1.2%, the same as France, but stronger than Japan (0.9%), recession-threatened Germany (0.5%) and Italy (0%). The eurozone has been affected by falling demand for its exports, with Germany suffering the biggest IMF downgrades.\n\nThe IMF said its forecasts for the UK and the eurozone were still based on a deal between London and Brussels but added that the outcome remained uncertain at the time the WEO was being written in early September.\n\nThe WEO\u2019s forecasts for the UK in 2019 and 2020 have remained unchanged since April, with the Fund saying that the modest growth reflects the combination of a negative impact from weaker global growth and ongoing Brexit uncertainty and a positive impact from higher public expenditure announced in the recent spending review.\n\nGopinath said subdued growth was a consequence of \u201crising trade barriers; elevated uncertainty surrounding trade and geopolitics; idiosyncratic factors causing macroeconomic strain in several emerging market economies; and structural factors, such as low productivity growth and ageing demographics in advanced economies.\n\n\u201cIt is important to keep in mind that the subdued world growth of 3% is occurring at a time when monetary policy has significantly eased almost simultaneously across advanced and emerging markets. The absence of inflationary pressures has led major central banks to move pre-emptively to reduce downside risks to growth and to prevent de-anchoring of inflation expectations, in turn supporting buoyant financial conditions.\u201d\n\nGopinath added that there was too much reliance on central banks and singled out Germany as a country that could use fiscal policy \u2013 tax cuts and higher public spending \u2013 to boost activity.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\n\u201cMonetary policy cannot be the only game in town and should be coupled with fiscal support where fiscal space is available and where policy is not already too expansionary. A country like Germany should take advantage of negative borrowing rates to invest in social and infrastructure capital,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough global economic cooperation is currently at a low ebb, Gopinath said an internationally coordinated fiscal response, tailored to the circumstances of individual countries, could be required if growth weakened further.\n\nFinancial market sentiment \u2013 boosted by lower interest rates \u2013 could deteriorate, the IMF warned, citing worsening trade and geopolitical tensions, a no-deal Brexit and persistently weak economic data as potential triggers.", "description": "Fund cuts world growth forecast as central banks battle impact of protectionism", "authors": ["Larry Elliott", "Kenneth Rogoff", "Mohamed El-Erian"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6d09d72937139969b7146d70c5b9880fccb268a/0_170_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f309db5329f7dd98894e7de89349f03a", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
