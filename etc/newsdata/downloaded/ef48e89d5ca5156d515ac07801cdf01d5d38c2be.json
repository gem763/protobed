And so that is a net release of carbon into the atmosphere in the form of CO2, and CO2 is the main driver of climate change, and so that's how these fires can have an effect on climate change, or at least the major way that they do.\"\n\nThe seven global climate indicators highlight the long-term trends in a warming planet, with rising greenhouse gases and rising sea levels.\n\nGlaciers are one such indicator. Matthias Huss, a glaciologist at Eth Z\u00fcrich, has been monitoring the Plaine Morte glacier high above the Swiss ski resort of Crans Montana.\n\nLike all Alpine glaciers, it's getting smaller. This glacier has lost almost 50 metres in height over the past 30 years.\n\nThe glaciologists use a simple and reliable ice pole system to measure how the ice is melting.\n\n\"This doesn't look extreme,\u201d Huss says, \u201cbut actually here we are in an upper part of a glacier, so this is the region that should be snow-covered by now, where the glacier should gain some mass. But in years like this, and actually in all years that we had in the last decade, the glacier lost mass here.\"\n\nHuss says the reason is simple. It\u2019s just too warm.\n\n\"We have enough snow. So, in the last two winters we got extreme amount of snow. In this place we had more than 5 metres of snow in April and May. So we were actually thinking that this should be enough finally to cause some gain of the glacier again. But it was not the case. So the temperatures in summer were so high that everything was melted, and now the ice is melting and the glacier is losing mass.\"\n\nMore than 500 Swiss glaciers have disappeared since 1850. The forecast is that at least two thirds of all Alpine glaciers will be gone by the end of the century.", "description": "Data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service shows temperatures were 1.2 degrees centigrade above the pre-industrial average.", "authors": ["Jeremy Wilks"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/13/44/64/1000x563_cmsv2_ba3c9978-9251-5339-bd8d-c52d89f5bf7b-4134464.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
