He escapes back under some rock, and a few news cycles later it\u2019s on to a new enemy and new crisis.\u201d\n\nMr Trump did predict a major terror attack would soon occur in the US and warned of an atrocity that would \u201cmake the [1993] bombing of the Trade Centre look like kids playing with firecrackers.\u201d\n\nHe did not, however, mention Bin Laden or al-Qaeda as potential perpetrators of such an attack.\n\nEven if the president's book had predicted Bin Laden was a significant threat, he would not have been the first person to make that observation.\n\nUS intelligence agencies were well aware of Bin Laden by 2000, as were many members of the general public following the 1998 United States embassy bombings which brought al-Qaeda to international attention.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
