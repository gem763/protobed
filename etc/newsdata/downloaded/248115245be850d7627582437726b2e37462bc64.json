In the past, it was logically understood that women would not fare well physically against more powerful men in the rough and tumble sport. But now, all that going by the wayside as Roller Derby rushes to PC itself by allowing men claiming to be transitioning into women to join the sport.\n\nAccording to the advocacy group Fair Play for Women, men are trying to invade Roller Derby, especially in the UK leagues.\n\nBoiled down, Roller Derby is a points game where \u201cjammers\u201d push through a pack of skaters and skate a full lap to reenter the pack. They get points for every opposing team member they pass during the lap. But the physical part comes as the \u201cblockers\u201d physically block the \u201cjammers\u201d to keep them from scoring, and that is where the tough, physicality comes into the game.\n\nNow, imagine if skaters who are physically men are the blockers trying to stop the natural-born female jammers? The jammers wouldn\u2019t stand a chance pushing past their stronger and faster biologically male opponents.\n\nDespite that, leagues all across the UK are falling all over themselves (literally) to appear welcoming and tolerant to transgenders by allowing men claiming to be women to join the leagues.\n\n\u201cEffectively, it is no longer an exclusively female sport,\u201d Fair Play for Women says, adding:\n\nLeeds Roller Derby declares itself \u2018open to all female-identifying and non-binary skaters.\u2019 Sheffield Steel Roller Derby says, \u2018We welcome all self-identifying women\u2019 while Belfast Roller Derby is \u2018open to anyone who identifies as a woman or gender expansive.\u2019 Edinburgh\u2019s Auld Reekie league says, \u2018those who identify as women (cisgender, transgender and intersex) or gender expansive may train and compete as skaters.\u2019 London Roller Derby asserts, \u2018increasing awareness of gender identities\u2026we need to be more inclusive of our trans teammates.\u2019 This move to increase \u2018inclusivity\u2019 is at the heart of the WFTDA gender policy which has been adopted by the UKRDA. It says \u201can individual who identifies as a transwoman, intersex woman, and/or gender expansive may skate with a WFTDA charter team\u2026 \u2018\n\nBut some natural-born female contestants are becoming worried about their safety.\n\nOne female Roller Derby player told the group that she was blackballed from the Canadian Roller Derby league after becoming alarmed for her safety on the track and then being vocal against allowing men to join the leagues.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re built like men because they have male bodies,\u201d Kate Hansen said about allowing transgender players to compete against natural women. \u201cWomen who sign up to play women\u2019s roller derby expect to be playing women.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before her outspoken opposition to transgender players was turned against her, and she was banned from the leagues for being a \u201cbigot.\u201d\n\nAnother Canadian player, Lara Kendall, agreed with Hansen. \u201cThe biological strength of men alone gives them an advantage, and the patriarchy affords social and financial advantages for men that keep the top positions male-dominated. I play roller derby and men in female sports teams is not fair,\u201d she said.\n\nAt least two recent studies support the players in their opinion that transgender athletes are still physically men with all the requisite strength, power, speed, and musculature.\n\nA recent study by researchers at New Zealand\u2019s University of Otago concluded that men claiming to be transgender women do not lose their male strengths despite testosterone loss, hormone therapy, and transgender surgeries.\n\nThe researchers concluded that \u201chealthy young men did not lose significant muscle mass (or power) when their circulating testosterone levels were reduced.\u201d\n\nAnother study found agreed that transgender transitioning procedures do not obviate a male body\u2019s strengths.\n\nA study conducted by the Swedish Karolinska Institute and Linkoping University found that even after a full year of hormone therapy, transgender women still retain their male strength and muscle mass.\n\n\u201cDespite the robust increases in muscle mass and strength in TM, the TW were still stronger and had more muscle mass following 12months of treatment,\u201d the researchers found. \u201cThese findings add new knowledge that could be relevant when evaluating transwomen\u2019s eligibility to compete in the women\u2019s category of athletic competitions.\u201d\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "Transgender women (biological males) are apparently working their way into the once all-female sport of Roller Derby, and some female", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo_Michael-Snyder-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
