Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, urging them to publicly deny the existence of any evidence of collusion during the 2016 election.\n\nCoats and Rogers refused to comply with the requests, which they both deemed to be inappropriate, according to two current and two former officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private communications with the president.\n\nTrump sought the assistance of Coats and Rogers after FBI Director James B. Comey told the House Intelligence Committee on March 20 that the FBI was investigating \u201cthe nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russia\u2019s efforts.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s conversation with Rogers was documented contemporaneously in an internal memo written by a senior NSA official, according to the officials. It is unclear if a similar memo was prepared by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to document Trump\u2019s conversation with Coats. Officials said such memos could be made available to both the special counsel now overseeing the Russia investigation and congressional investigators, who might explore whether Trump sought to impede the FBI\u2019s work.\n\n[Flynn takes the Fifth, declines to comply with Senate Intelligence Committee subpoena]\n\nWhite House officials say Comey\u2019s testimony about the scope of the FBI investigation upset Trump, who has dismissed the FBI and congressional investigations as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d The president has repeatedly said there was no collusion.\n\nCurrent and former senior intelligence officials viewed Trump\u2019s requests as an attempt by the president to tarnish the credibility of the agency leading the Russia investigation.\n\nA senior intelligence official said Trump\u2019s goal was to \u201cmuddy the waters\u201d about the scope of the FBI probe at a time when Democrats were ramping up their calls for the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel, a step announced last week.\n\nSenior intelligence officials also saw the March requests as a threat to the independence of U.S. spy agencies, which are supposed to remain insulated from partisan issues.\n\n\u201cThe problem wasn\u2019t so much asking them to issue statements, it was asking them to issue false statements about an ongoing investigation,\u201d a former senior intelligence official said of the request to Coats.\n\nThe NSA and Brian Hale, a spokesman for Coats, declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation.\n\n(Jenny Starrs,Julio Negron/The Washington Post)\n\n\u201cThe White House does not confirm or deny unsubstantiated claims based on illegal leaks from anonymous individuals,\u201d a White House spokesman said. \u201cThe president will continue to focus on his agenda that he was elected to pursue by the American people.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the requests to Coats and Rogers, senior White House officials sounded out top intelligence officials about the possibility of intervening directly with Comey to encourage the FBI to drop its probe of Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, according to people familiar with the matter. The officials said the White House appeared uncertain about its power to influence the FBI.\n\n\u201cCan we ask him to shut down the investigation? Are you able to assist in this matter?\u201d one official said of the line of questioning from the White House.\n\nRep. Adam B. Schiff (Calif.), the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee, said the report is \u201cyet another disturbing allegation that the President was interfering in the FBI probe.\u201d Schiff said in a statement that Congress \u201cwill need to bring the relevant officials back to testify on these matters, and obtain any memoranda that reflect such conversations.\u201d\n\nThe new revelations add to a growing body of evidence that Trump sought to co-opt and then undermine Comey before he fired him May 9. According to notes kept by Comey, Trump first asked for his loyalty at a dinner in January and then, at a meeting the next month, asked him to drop the probe into Flynn. Trump disputes those accounts.\n\nCurrent and former officials said that Trump either lacks an understanding of the FBI\u2019s role as an independent law enforcement agency or does not care about maintaining such boundaries.\n\nTrump\u2019s effort to use the director of national intelligence and the NSA director to dispute Comey\u2019s statement and to say there was no evidence of collusion echoes President Richard Nixon\u2019s \u201cunsuccessful efforts to use the CIA to shut down the FBI\u2019s investigation of the Watergate break-in on national security grounds,\u201d said Jeffrey H. Smith, a former general counsel at the CIA. Smith called Trump\u2019s actions \u201can appalling abuse of power.\u201d\n\nTrump made his appeal to Coats days after Comey\u2019s testimony, according to officials.\n\nThat same week, Trump telephoned Rogers to make a similar appeal.\n\nIn his call with Rogers, Trump urged the NSA director to speak out publicly if there was no evidence of collusion, according to officials briefed on the exchange.\n\nRogers was taken aback but tried to respectfully explain why he could not do so, the officials said. For one thing, he could not comment on an ongoing investigation. Rogers added that he would not talk about classified matters in public.\n\nWhile relations between Trump and Comey were strained by the Russia probe, ties between the president and the other intelligence chiefs, including Rogers, Coats and CIA Director Mike Pompeo, appear to be less contentious, according to officials.\n\nRogers met with Trump in New York shortly after the election, and Trump\u2019s advisers at the time held him out as the leading candidate to be the next director of national intelligence.\n\nThe Washington Post subsequently reported that President Barack Obama\u2019s defense secretary and director of national intelligence had recommended that Rogers be removed as head of the NSA.\n\nUltimately, Trump decided to nominate Coats, rather than Rogers. Coats was sworn in just days before the president made his request.\n\nIn February, the Trump White House also sought to enlist senior members of the intelligence community and Congress to push back against suggestions that Trump associates were in frequent contact with Russian officials. But in that case, the White House effort was designed to refute news accounts, not the testimony of a sitting FBI director who was leading an open investigation.\n\nTrump and his allies in Congress have similarly sought to deflect scrutiny over Russia by attempting to pit U.S. intelligence agencies against one another.\n\nIn December, Trump\u2019s congressional allies falsely claimed that the FBI did not concur with a CIA assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Trump win the White House. Comey and then-CIA Director John Brennan later said that the bureau and the agency were in full agreement on Moscow\u2019s intentions.\n\nAs the director of national intelligence, Coats leads the vast U.S. intelligence community, which includes the FBI. But that does not mean he has full visibility into the FBI probe. Coats\u2019s predecessor in the job, James R. Clapper Jr., recently acknowledged that Comey did not brief him on the scope of the Russia investigation. Similarly, it is unclear to what extent the FBI has brought Coats up to speed on the probe\u2019s most sensitive findings.", "description": "The director of national intelligence and the NSA director refused because they believed the requests were inappropriate.", "authors": ["Adam Entous", "Reporter Who Wrote About National Security", "Foreign Policy", "Ellen Nakashima", "National Security Reporter", "May"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/05/22/National-Politics/Images/98hearingA.jpg?t=20170517", "published_at": "2017-05-22"}
