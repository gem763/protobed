He then retired, with a full salary for the rest of his life.\n\nMotata was found guilty of drunk driving in the Johannesburg high court in 2009 and was sentenced to a fine of R20 000 or 12 months imprisonment.\n\nThe JSC appointed a tribunal under former judge Achmat Jappie to investigate the complaints against Motata from Afriforum, the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace and a senior advocate.\n\nThe tribunal found Motata had indeed behaved in a racist manner at the accident scene and had been guilty of gross misconduct.\n\nHe had also behaved in a manner unbefitting of a judge by maintaining that he had not been drunk \u2013 despite all evidence to the contrary.\n\nThe tribunal had already recommended that Motata become the first judge in democratic South Africa to be impeached and that he should be stripped of all salary and retirement benefits afforded to judges.\n\nBut the JSC has the final decision, and this weeks decided to contradict the tribunal.\n\nThe JSC is chaired by chief justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, but the majority of its members are politicians, among them Julius Malema. In addition, the position for one of the nine judge presidents is presently occupied by John Hlope, of the Western Cape, who is also being investigated by the JSC.\n\nOn the matter of the alleged provocation, Jappie found that the Motata\u2019s evidence that he was provoked into making racist statements because he was insulted is not evident from the record of the hearing.\n\n\u201cAnd the judge at no stage during the exchange of pleadings in these proceedings alleged he was provoked by the \u2018k-word.\u201d\n\nDespite this, the JSC on Thursday said Motata\u2019s racially charged comments were improper, but found mitigating circumstances in the fact that the judge was drunk \u2013 something he had still denied before the tribunal \u2013 and because he was provoked by Baird\u2019s alleged use of the k-word.\n\nIn addition, the JSC wiped the charge regarding Motata\u2019s conduct during his criminal case off his slate, because they had found out that the senior advocate who laid a charge against Motata did so at the request of a JSC member. That was improper and unacceptable, said the JSC.\n\nThe JSC accordingly found that Motata was only guilty of misconduct, not gross misconduct. For this reason he was only give a fine of R1.1 million, which he must pay within 24 months.\n\nAccording to the most recent notice published in the government gazette, judges now earn more than R1.8 million per year.\n\nBaird said the JSC\u2019s decision was a slap in the face.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s contemptible that the JSC has now used Motata\u2019s untruths in which he depicted me as a racist in order to exonerate him.\u201d\n\nThis is why he will now take civil steps to restore his reputation.\n\nKallie Kriel, chief executive officer of AfriForum, said they would assist Baird in his case.", "description": "Nkola Motata, a former judge who was convicted of drunk driving in 2009, can expect a summons from the owner of the home he drove into while intoxicated in 2007.", "authors": ["Johan Eybers"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7923/6662740b831d47cea4b0d1e08d028df3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
