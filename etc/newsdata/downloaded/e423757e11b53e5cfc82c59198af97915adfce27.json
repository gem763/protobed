But the two sides were still poles apart on customs, always likely to be the stumbling block, and so it has proved.\n\nThe manner in which the tentative talks have virtually collapsed is instructive. An astonishing briefing to The Spectator by a Downing Street source shows that Mr Johnson has learned nothing from Theresa May\u2019s experience.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nLike her, he is trying to \u201cdivide and rule\u201d EU member states \u2013 in this case, threatening to withdraw cooperation on sensitive matters such as defence and security from countries which support an extension of the UK\u2019s EU membership beyond 31 October. This was both reckless and naive, since it was bound to drive the 27 even closer together. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, was right to warn Mr Johnson: \u201cWhat\u2019s at stake is not winning some stupid blame game. At stake is the future of Europe and the UK as well as the security and interests of our people.\u201d\n\nSimilarly, threatening to disrupt the EU during the extension period is unlikely to move the markets in Brussels. The EU27 are much smarter than some in the UK government think; they are unlikely to be provoked into refusing the extension the prime minister will now likely be forced to seek under the Benn Act to prevent a crash out.\n\nPerhaps No 10 hoped that the threat of withdrawing Mr Johnson\u2019s proposals and backing no deal would push the EU into serious last-minute negotiations. More likely is that the aggressive briefing, and a similar one about the Johnson-Merkel discussion, mark the start of a \u201cblame game\u201d that was always the most likely outcome.\n\nIndeed, it was almost certainly in the Johnson playbook all along. On becoming prime minister, he put most of the government\u2019s energies into preparing for no deal, and was in no hurry to engage with the EU about a deal. Only when the Benn Act threatened his planned 31 October departure timetable, did he put the same effort into striking an agreement. It was always likely to be too little, too late, and so it has proved.\n\nSo now we are probably heading for an extension and a general election, which the Conservatives will fight on a \u201cno delay\u201d ticket in the hope of seeing off the threat from Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party. That will be widely seen as a \u201cno deal\u201d ticket, especially if the talks with the EU end acrimoniously \u2013 and Johnson allies are doing their best to ensure they do.\n\nThe intemperate briefings give the impression that some in Downing Street think it is all a game to be played for electoral advantage. For them, the \u201cblame game\u201d works at several levels. Mr Johnson can blame the extension on the EU for not accepting his proposals and backbenchers in all parties, Jeremy Corbyn and Jo Swinson, for supporting the Benn Act. He will probably blame the judiciary too, since the act is likely to be tested in the courts before he grudgingly requests an extension. Much easier than accepting responsibility for his own actions, which would be a novelty.\n\nMr Johnson has clearly chosen his path to what he hopes will be an election victory. He is gambling on winning Labour-held, Leave-voting seats in the north and midlands, some of which have not returned a Tory MP for decades. He hopes his \u201cno delay\u201d manifesto will unite the Leave vote behind his party.\n\nYet he seems to have conveniently forgotten that 4 million Tory supporters voted Remain in the 2016 referendum. Will they vote for a party committed to a no-deal Brexit? It is unlikely. There is no guarantee that this damaging, unedifying game will hand Mr Johnson the victory he wants.", "description": "Any remaining hopes that\u00a0Boris Johnson\u2019s\u00a0proposals for a\u00a0Brexit\u00a0deal would win the EU\u2019s backing seem to have been extinguished after a\u00a0tense phone call\u00a0between him and", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/08/11/johnson-merkel.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
