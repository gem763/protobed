Ted Lieu (D-CA) said there was \u201cmore than enough\u201d evidence to draft articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump.\n\nLieu said, \u201cImpeachment is one of the greatest powers of Congress. It should always be our last option, reserved only for those instances until we can\u2019t wait until the next election. We\u2019re at one of those times because the president continues to solicit foreign powers to interfere in our electoral politics.\n\nHe continued, \u201cThe evidence that has already come out, there is more than enough to draft articles of impeachment right now.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThe president might want to watch the video of his remarks yesterday on the South Lawn. I served in active duty in the military because I believe America is an exceptional country, and we are all Americans. The American president should never, ever solicit a foreign government to target a political rival. That is un-American, it\u2019s wrong, and it\u2019s abuse of power.\u201d\n\nFollow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN", "description": "During an appearance on CNN Friday, Rep.
