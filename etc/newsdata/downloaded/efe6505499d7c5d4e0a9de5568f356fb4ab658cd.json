Ron Johnson says he was blocked by President Donald Trump from telling Ukraine's president that U.S. aid was on its way amid accusations Trump was withholding it until the eastern European nation investigated his political rival.\n\nTrump rejected Johnson's request in August after also refusing in May to back new Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Oshkosh Republican told reporters Friday.\n\n\u201cI was surprised by the president\u2019s reaction and realized we had a sales job to do,\u201d Johnson said during a constituent stop in Sheboygan. \u201cI tried to convince him (in August) to give me the authority to tell President Zelensky that we were going to provide that. Now, I didn\u2019t succeed.\"\n\nU.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., speaks with members of the media before meeting with the Middleton Chamber of Commerce at Serendipity Labs in Madison, Wis., Thursday, Oct. 3, 2019. Johnson Thursday that there was nothing wrong with President Donald Trump asking China and the Ukraine to investigate former Democratic Vice President Joe Biden and his son. More\n\nJohnson told reporters Trump said he was considering withholding the aid because of alleged corruption involving the 2016 U.S. election. Johnson stood by the president, saying he was sympathetic to his concerns and didn't see any bad motives on his part.\n\n\"What happened in 2016? What happened in 2016? What was the truth about that?\u201d Johnson said about Trump's concerns.\n\nWith his comments Friday, Johnson made clear that he was aware of allegations Trump was withholding aid to Ukraine for political reasons weeks before the public knew.\n\nTrump, who faces a fast-moving impeachment inquiry over the matter, has denied the claim and Johnson has defended the president \u2014 but Johnson's story helps House Democrats confirm a key aspect of the probe.\n\nJohnson was part of a delegation that attended Zelensky\u2019s inauguration in May. He and others briefed Trump on the inauguration and urged Trump to back Zelensky but the president resisted the idea, Johnson said Friday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in New York on Sept. 25, 2019. More\n\n\u201cWe all went in there having come in from the inauguration and, you know, we were trying to encourage the president to show a great deal of support,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cOval Office visit, appoint an ambassador who could be appointed quickly on a bipartisan basis \u2014 because we came back from meeting President Zelensky pretty confident, pretty encouraged that he really does understand what his mandate is and he\u2019s dedicated to fulfilling it.\"\n\nTrump was not receptive to the message from the delegation, which included Johnson, Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union; and Kurt Volker, the State Department special envoy to Ukraine at the time. Volker stepped down last week and testified behind closed doors Thursday as part of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nJohnson told the Wall Street Journal on Friday that Sondland told him that Ukraine would appoint a prosecutor who would, as Johnson put it, work to \"get to the bottom of what happened in 2016 \u2014 if President Trump has that confidence, then he\u2019ll release the military spending.\"\n\n\u201cAt that suggestion, I winced,\u201d Johnson told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cMy reaction was: Oh, God. I don\u2019t want to see those two things combined.\u201d\n\nHe said he asked Trump about it and the president denied it.\n\n\"He said \u2014 expletive deleted \u2014 \u2018No way. I would never do that. Who told you that?'\u201d Johnson told the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Johnson said the call lasted 10 to 15 minutes and Trump said he was holding the money back because of corruption concerns.", "description": "Sen.
