It's the type of screen you'd find on ultra-high-end TVs and smartphones, and few laptops have OLED screens available.\n\nThe screen makes everything you do on the laptop look gorgeous, but it's only available on the $1,850 XPS 15 model that comes with Intel's 9th-generation Core i7 chip or the $2,550 Core i9 model.\n\nThat might seem expensive, but it's a bargain compared to Apple's $2,400 MacBook Pro that comes with almost identical specs.\n\nWhile I used the $2,550 model for the review, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except a professional who needs the power of the Core i9 processor.

So why shouldn't laptops get them, too? Many of us arguably spend more time in front of a computer screen than TVs and smartphones, after all.\n\nAs with premium TVs and smartphones with OLED screens, the XPS 15 with a 4K OLED screen demands a larger chunk of your bank account \u2014 a minimum of $1,850, to be precise.\n\nBut, in several respects, this isn't the worst deal in the world \u2014 not by a longshot. Other Windows 10 laptops with similar specs hover around the same price tag. And compared to Apple's $2,400 MacBook Pro with the same specs, the $1,850 XPS 15 feels like a bargain.\n\nCheck it out:", "description": "The XPS 15 is one of the few laptops that has an OLED screen.
