Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg got grilled by lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, and some of the most pointed questioning came from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\n\u2018Do you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of fact checking on political advertisements?\u2019 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\n\nThe New York congresswoman pushed Zuckerberg to clarify Facebook\u2019s policy that it will not fact check political ads.\n\n\u201cYou announced recently that the official policy of Facebook now allows politicians to pay to spread disinformation in 2020 elections and in the future. So I just want to know how far I can push this in the next year,\u201d she said, offering a scenario where a political ad targeting black voters told them the wrong election date. Zuckerberg said such an ad would be banned, since it falls under Facebook rules banning calls for violence or voter suppression.\n\n\"So, you won't take down lies or you will take down lies? I think that's just a pretty simple yes or no.\"\n\n\n\nComplete exchange between @RepAOC @AOC and Mark Zuckerberg at today's House Financial Services Cmte hearing.\n\n\n\nFull video here: https://t.co/heT7Psnlp1 pic.twitter.com/0iiWtfU5gQ \u2014 CSPAN (@cspan) October 23, 2019\n\n\u201cSo there is some threshold where you will fact-check political advertisements. Is that what you\u2019re telling me?\u201d Ocasio-Cortez asked. \u201cWould I be able to run advertisements on Facebook targeting Republicans in primaries saying that they voted for the Green New Deal? I mean, if you\u2019re not fact-checking political advertisements, I\u2019m just trying to understand the bounds here, what\u2019s fair game.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongresswoman, I don\u2019t know the answer to that off the top of my head,\u201d Zuckerberg replied.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be able to do that,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI think probably,\u201d Zuckerberg said.\n\n\u201cDo you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of fact checking on political advertisements?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cWell, Congresswoman,\u201d he answered, \u201cI think lying is bad, and I think if you were to run an ad that had a lie in it, that would be bad. That\u2019s different from it being ... in our position, the right thing to do to prevent your constituents or people in an election from seeing that you had lied.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you won\u2019t take down lies, or you will take down lies? I think this is a pretty simple yes or no,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIt depends on the context that it shows up,\u201d Zuckerberg responded.\n\nOpinion: It\u2019s up to us to separate the truth from the lies on Facebook\n\nZuckerberg was also challenged by Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., on whether he would be willing to spend a day doing the job of a Facebook content monitor, many of whom reportedly suffer from mental trauma from viewing a steady stream of violent and disturbing content. Zuckerberg declined to do so.\n\nThe public face of Facebook was also challenged over the Cambridge Analytica scandal and came under intense questioning over the company\u2019s proposed Libra cryptocurrency.\n\nFacebook shares FB, +2.09% slipped slightly Wednesday but have been largely unfazed by the various controversies the social-media giant has been involved in over the past year. Its stock is up 43% so far in 2019, compared with the S&P 500\u2019s SPX, +0.28% 20% year-to-date gain.\n\nRead on: Want to delete Facebook?
