But there\u2019s a more fundamental question: Just what are the suburbs anyway?\n\nIn a statistical sense, they are surprisingly hard to define.\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau, the primary source of demographic data, doesn\u2019t offer a lot of insight; it distinguishes only between urban and rural areas.\n\nSo The New York Times decided to develop its own method for defining suburbia. From there, we were able to evaluate the demographics and, by extension, the political implications of demographic change.\n\nThe key finding: Suburbia should not be considered a distinct entity, but two separate realms. The difference between inner-ring and outer-ring suburbs goes well beyond geography.\n\nIn fact, reexamining the 2016 presidential election through that lens, we found that the fault line in party preference was precisely at the boundary between old and new.\n\n\u2014 Quantifying Suburbia\n\n\u201cMuch of America looks suburban,\u201d economists Shawn Bucholtz and Jed Kolko wrote last year. But just because we can see and feel \u201csuburban\u201d doesn\u2019t mean we can easily count it.\n\nThe absence of an official federal definition of suburban, they said, \u201cmakes it hard to measure the reach and impact of federal programs and to produce vital statistics about Americans and their communities.\u201d\n\nThe two proposed a system for quantifying suburbs based on how residents describe their neighborhoods in the American Housing Survey, a technique similar to a survey that Kolko, an occasional Upshot contributor, conducted as chief economist at Trulia in 2015.\n\nFor our version, we decided to look at both the density of people and the density of building development. Analyzing census-tract data from the American Community Survey and spatial data from satellite imagery, we created a rural-suburban-urban density continuum index for more than 70,000 neighborhoods in the continental United States.\n\nWe evaluated how many people lived in each census tract in proportion to the land mass, and measured the development density by analyzing the pixels from satellite imagery.\n\n\u2014 A Scale of 1 to 10\n\nThe satellite imagery, published by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics consortium, portrays the U.S. mainland as millions of tiny dots. Each dot is color-coded to represent a different land use \u2014 like forest land, farmland, pavement and buildings. For every census tract on the continent, we counted the dots and measured the percentage representing developed land.\n\nWe then converted the percentages to a 1-to-10 scale, and did the same with each tract\u2019s population per square mile. We then combined the two factors into a single index representing the combined density of people and buildings. For neighborhoods with unusual divergences between the two factors \u2014 industrial parks that were heavily paved but that had low population density, for example \u2014 we always assigned the higher index score.\n\nWe categorized the tracts that scored 1 or 2 as rural, and those that scored 9 or 10 as urban.\n\nEverything in between was suburbia, although we eventually divided the suburbs into two groups as well. The reason? When we started running the numbers for demographics and 2016 election results, we realized that the more-dense suburban tracts were, as a group, far different from the less-dense tracts.\n\nWe called less-dense suburbs \u201couter ring,\u201d and denser suburbs \u201cinner ring.\u201d\n\nThe comparison totally ignores political boundaries, and intentionally so. In this world, the consideration is the density of neighborhoods, so we observe that 99% of New York and San Francisco residents live in urban density, but only 60% of Phoenix residents do, as well as 17% of Indianpolis residents and 4% of those who live in Jacksonville.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t differentiate all aspects of the suburban experience. For example, people might prefer a suburban community because of the school system or because of their job situation.\n\nBut our system correlated pretty strongly with demographic trends and even more strongly with voting patterns in the 2016 election.\n\nIn past stories, we\u2019ve deployed a county-level method. There are various \u201ctypology\u201d schemes that describe counties based on whether they are inside a metropolitan area, and whether they are the metro\u2019s primary county or adjacent to the primary county.", "description": "The suburbs are up for grabs.Anybody who's paying attention to the 2020 election knows that.
