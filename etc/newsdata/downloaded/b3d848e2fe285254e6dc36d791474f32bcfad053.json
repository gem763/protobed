Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) called the decision \u201cmorally repugnant,\u201d while Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) attacked it as \u201cpositively sinister.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, the People\u2019s Protection Units (YPG) members who fought valiantly against the Islamic State deserve American gratitude, and Trump should have strongly discouraged Turkey from attacking them. But the situation is complicated. The policy of assisting a faction of Syrian Kurds, the YPG, to fight the Islamic State has been a ticking time bomb since it began under the Obama administration, in 2014.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe short-term imperative to combat the militant group, which is also known as ISIS, created a strategic contradiction with foreseeable consequences that are now on painful display. Turkey, a NATO member, never accepted U.S. support for the group, which is directly linked to a terrorist organization that has long fought an insurgency against the Turkish state. Nor did every politician now criticizing Trump \u2014 whose decision-making has been characteristically chaotic \u2014 think this alliance was wise in the first place. The main surprise here is that U.S. diplomats and military officers made this untenable situation work as long as it did.\n\nPresident Barack Obama did not align the United States with the YPG with any enthusiasm. He was reluctant to intervene in the Syrian civil war. But he was alarmed by the emergence of the Islamic State, which he believed threatened the United States and its regional allies. The United States launched an air campaign in September 2014 to prevent the group from seizing control of the Kurdish town of Kobane near the Turkish border, later airdropping supplies to YPG forces defending the city. Rather than putting American boots on the ground, the United States wanted to partner with local fighters to defeat the Islamic State. Turkey objected to continued U.S. cooperation with the YPG and proposed an alternative Sunni force, but the United States did not believe those fighters were sufficiently \u201cmoderate\u201d and suspected that they (like Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan) were more focused on overthrowing Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime than eliminating the Islamic State. Erdogan also wanted a buffer zone to keep YPG forces away from Turkey\u2019s border, one that would also provide a haven for the refugees flooding his country, a proposal Obama did not support. Faced with an immediate risk and no good options, U.S. Central Command began assisting the YPG. It quickly developed an affinity to its brothers-in-arms, even wearing YPG patches in solidarity \u2014 until Turkey objected.\n\nErdogan opposed this partnership because of the YPG\u2019s links to Turkey\u2019s Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), which is designated as a terrorist organization by both Ankara and Washington. The PKK\u2019s armed struggle against the Turkish state for Kurdish rights has resulted in more than 40,000 deaths, including several bombings in Istanbul and Ankara that killed dozens of civilians in 2016 alone. The United States does not classify the YPG as a terrorist entity \u2014 a legal distinction that allowed the Obama administration to justify its cooperation with the group. Both groups operate under the same command structure, and fighters move freely between them. Indeed, the YPG is militarily effective in part because of its members\u2019 experience in Turkey. Links on the ground are clear: After the YPG defeated the Islamic State in the Syrian city of Raqqa, fighters unfurled banners showing Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned founder of the PKK.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTurkish officials were unimpressed by U.S. efforts to make the YPG more palatable by adding Syrian Arab fighters and creating a new umbrella organization called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). They note that Gen. Raymond Thomas, former head of U.S. Special Operations Command, has said publicly that he asked the YPG to \u201cchange your brand\u201d and described the inclusion of \u201cdemocratic\u201d in the group\u2019s name as a \u201cstroke of brilliance.\u201d\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), among the harshest critics of Trump\u2019s decision this week, was initially sympathetic to Turkish concerns and called the partnership with the Syrian Kurds \u201cthe dumbest idea in the world\u201d in an April 2016 Senate hearing, given the PKK connection.\n\nThe YPG\u2019s decision to fight the Islamic State was not made to help the United States. The group had its own reasons \u2014 in addition to defending its territory, the YPG sought to connect three northern Syrian cantons into a single autonomous region dominated by Kurds (similar to the Iraqi region of Kurdistan, which is led by a different faction of Kurds). This territory, however, borders the southeastern part of Turkey, where much of its Kurdish population lives. Turkey worried that the United States\u2019 strengthening of the YPG in Syria could encourage the PKK to renew conflict at home. A 30-month cease-fire and peace talks that Erdogan had begun with the PKK broke down in July 2015, partly because of spillover from the conflict in Syria. (Some Syrian Arabs resented the YPG\u2019s growing presence in areas that were not historically Kurdish and accused the group in summer 2015 of forcibly displacing Arab villagers.)\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAlthough Washington sought to assuage Ankara, it made promises that proved hard to keep. When the Obama administration asked the YPG in spring 2016 to cross the Euphrates River to clear the predominantly Arab town of Manbij of Islamic State fighters, it was acting against Erdogan\u2019s express wish that the YPG remain east of the river \u2014 a natural boundary that separated the cantons. The United States publicly promised Turkey the fighters would leave afterward, yet some still remain. When the Trump administration armed the YPG for the Raqqa operation, which began in June 2017, it promised to collect the weapons afterward. A U.S. official described this idea as \u201casinine;\u201d predictably, it didn\u2019t fully happen.\n\nIn its eagerness to defeat the Islamic State, the United States failed to address the long-term consequence of creating a Syrian Kurdish region that was flatly unacceptable to Turkey. And given that the United States described its cooperation with the YPG as \u201ctemporary, transactional, and tactical\u201d \u2014 as a senior State Department official put it \u2014 it is hardly surprising that Erdogan pressed for an end date.\n\nTurkey has conducted military operations in Syria before, to create a buffer zone along the border, prevent the establishment of an autonomous Kurdish entity, and provide a space to return refugees. In August 2016, the Turkish military launched Operation Euphrates Shield to clear the Islamic State from its border (from Jarabulus on the Euphrates River to Azaz in the west, near the Kurdish enclave of Afrin) and block the Syrian Kurds from creating a contiguous region. In January 2018, Operation Olive Branch directly targeted YPG fighters in Afrin \u2014 who were working with Russian rather than U.S. military advisers. The U.S. reaction was restrained, acknowledging Turkish security concerns yet urging it to act in a proportionate and measured way.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTo prevent Erdogan from further military action, senior U.S. officials worked with their Turkish counterparts in recent months on plans to establish a limited buffer zone in Syria, along part of the Turkish border. The two sides conducted joint patrols and established a joint operations center. The United States also asked the YPG to pull back forces and remove fortifications along the border, which now leaves them defenseless. Yet Erdogan grew impatient with the failure to agree on details and demanded a 20-mile deep and 300-mile wide corridor \u2014 far larger than the narrow strip envisioned by Washington.\n\nTrump\u2019s hasty decision to withdraw U.S. advisers from the Syrian border, and at least tacitly approve a Turkish military operation, was sloppy and cruel. The lack of a coherent policy process and garbled messaging made a dangerous situation even worse. Renewed fighting will harm civilians in a now peaceful part of a war-torn country, enable the Islamic State to regroup, and empower Russia and Iran, who are backing the Assad regime and hungry for more influence.\n\nEnding the alliance with the YPG may be inevitable, but Trump\u2019s critics are right that the United States can\u2019t simply walk away without tarnishing its reputation as a reliable partner. With Turkey\u2019s Operation Peace Spring now underway, the United States should insist it be limited in scope and not target major Kurdish-controlled towns, that it ensure that Islamic State prisoners held by the YPG are not released, and that it not provoke a humanitarian crisis among civilians.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe United States should continue supporting efforts to find a political solution to the broader conflict in Syria, including decisions about long-term governance and security arrangements. The YPG produced expedient results in one corner of Syria, but it was never expected to liberate the entire country. A likely outcome of a Turkish incursion is that the YPG makes a deal with the Syrian regime. Throughout the conflict, the YPG never joined opposition groups seeking to overthrow the regime, which, in turn, did not conduct extensive operations in areas where the YPG was based.\n\nDespite deep frustration with Turkey\u2019s strongman leader, the United States must preserve its relationship with that country. It is a challenging ally and has strayed from NATO principles \u2014 for instance, by purchasing Russian military equipment and by cracking down on political opponents and the press. But it remains an important Muslim-majority ally in a critical region. And, given its geography, it has a clear interest in a stable Syria. The United States should remain focused on ensuring that the Syrian neighbor with the most to lose remains invested in the efforts to decisively defeat the Islamic State.\n\nAD", "description": "The tactical decision to back the YPG created a ticking time bomb.", "authors": ["Amanda Sloat", "Amanda Sloat Is A Robert Bosch Senior Fellow At The Brookings Institution.
