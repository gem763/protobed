It is hoped that will prompt more travellers to travel by rail.\n\nThe government also plans to increase tax relief for commuters - compensating higher fuel costs from a new levy on carbon dioxide emissions - and for people modernising buildings to waste less energy.\n\nOther new rules are aimed at giving incentives to municipalities to allow the construction of wind turbines, which has recently slowed.\n\nAfter months of wrangling, ministers agreed last month a sweeping climate package. It is built around a gradually increasing CO2 price from 2021, on sectors that have thus far escaped green taxes.\n\nThe deal came after Berlin was forced to admit it would miss a 2020 target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent compared with 1990 levels.\n\nWhile environmentalists immediately labelled the changes insufficient, conservatives and the far right have challenged it, saying it goes too far.\n\nFind Your Escape by signing up for the Traveller24 Weekly Newsletter \u2013 Subscribe here.
