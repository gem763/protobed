Oh, and don't forget, their dividends help prop up retirees' incomes, and many other people's.\n\nFor their part, the banks trotted out a series of underwhelming comments to justify only passing on partial cuts to mortgage holders, as bank share prices continued to fall amid a savage global market sell-off and expectations profits will fall further.\n\nFresh out of the damaging banking royal commission, the bank chiefs could be forgiven for keeping their heads down and not inflaming politicians any further.\n\nThere's plenty of stakeholders in the mix with strong views about what level of profit is the right amount for the banks to generate. But the reality is, the banking sector is a regulated one, and it's unlikely the banks, or their shareholders, will make that call.\n\n\"This is a whole new world,\" says Warren Hogan, a former ANZ chief economist and a professor at University of Technology Sydney, when asked how the big four will adjust to a low interest rate environment.\n\nMark Johnson, a former Macquarie Group director who led a 2009 government review into financial services competition, says we're fighting a bigger battle than one that is just about the bank profitability. For Johnson, this debate is all politics, with little substance.\n\n\"This government has gone from opposing the royal commission to now adopting the anti-bank sentiment it has created. You could very easily hold the opinion now that this is an anti-business government,\" he told AFR Weekend from Colorado in the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere are populist pressures all around the world at the moment and it is manifesting itself in a relatively mild way in Australia, but this is part of it.\n\n\u201cThe banks must push forward. If they succumb to short-term political populism it will be to their long-term detriment.\"\n\nSo are the banks really going to be hit that hard by falling interest rates?\n\nThere's little doubt their golden era is well and truly over. Simply, a bank is a leveraged play on the economy, and if the economy is weaker, so too are bank profits.\n\nThe banks must push forward. If they succumb to short-term political populism, it will be to their long-term detriment. \u2014 Mark Johnson\n\nMore precisely, banks' net interest margins \u2013 the difference between bank funding costs and the amount they charge for loans \u2013 will be crimped as rates fall lower, reducing profits.\n\nA portion of the banks' deposits don't pay interest, and is therefore free funding.\n\nSo when the cash rate is cut, lower lending interest rates reduce the banks' profit margins.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnalysts have previously estimated that a 25 basis point cut that was passed on in full would shave about 5 per cent from bank profits. Each additional cut, however, would hurt bank profits by more than 5 per cent because the margin squeeze would become tighter and harder to avoid.\n\nEvans & Partners analyst Matthew Wilson said a 1 per cent cash rate would probably reduce the big banks' return on equity (ROE) to about 9 per cent, well below their previous 13 per cent.\n\nCompanies that have a ROE of about 9 per cent include infrastructure and mining group Downer EDI, salmon farmer Tassal Group, Origin Energy, jeweller Michael Hill International and the APN Industrial REIT, to name a few.\n\nFor the regulators and the central bank which is relying on the banks to help kickstart economic growth by passing on as much of the cuts as possible, the question is: what's the right ROE for the banks?\n\nThat's subjective, and what's right for investors, won't be the same as what's right for regulators, the central bank or even the politicians. Where 10 years ago there was pride that Australian banks generated outsize profits and returns, this is now a liability.\n\nThe RBA financial stability report repeatedly referred to global banking returns, arguing Australian banks remained amongst the most profitable lending institutions in the world.\n\nBut there's far more going on than just the impact on net interest margins. In particular, the fallout from the banking royal commission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA timely reminder of the escalating costs of that was delivered this week by National Australia Bank, which revealed it will set aside an extra $832 million to refund ripped-off financial advice customers, sending the total cost to the bank of the fees-for-no-service scandal rocketing past $2 billion.\n\nIn addition, by overcharging customers, banks had artificially puffed up their margins, which means there's more fall-out than simply remediation charges.\n\n\"Return on equity is trending down without a shadow of a doubt. Perhaps if they continue to refuse to pass on rate cuts the ROEs can hold, but the trend is still down,\" says one analyst.\n\n\u201cThe banks face a toxic mix \u2013 you\u2019ve got fading credit growth, fading NIM [net interest margins], fee cuts, decreased treasury earnings, additional costs associated with increased regulatory compliance, higher capital requirements in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nAnd \u2013 as the RBA highlighted \u2013 competition is also increasing.\n\nUntil recently, the major banks have been one of the market's biggest and best performers.\n\nFor decades \u2013 with an occasional bump or two \u2013 deregulation, mopping up regional banks, wiping out global interlopers and becoming the go-to stocks for dividend yield was a winning formula.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey've also been the backbone of the index. Now, they account for about 23 per cent of the index.\n\nThe real golden era was between 2011 and 2015 when the banks zoomed from accounting for about 24 per cent of the ASX 200 to 32 per cent in 2015. Now, they've fallen back to levels similar to 2011.\n\nSo yes, banks are going to have to divvy up profits more carefully. And yes, investors will need to get used to lower returns, and with that, smaller dividends. Indeed, Morgan Stanley's banking sector team has forecast near-term dividend cuts for ANZ and Westpac, and the other two majors facing slashed payout ratios.\n\nBut where will it end?\n\nJohnson, now a senior adviser at investment bank Gresham Partners, accepts that bank profits are now going to be lower as margins become squeezed and regulatory scrutiny intensifies.\n\n\u201cReturn on equity will be a couple of percentage points down from where we have been. On a world scale they have been very profitable and have been pretty well run for 95 per cent of customers or more,\" he says.\n\n\u201cThere will certainly be profit pressure in the near term, thanks primarily to the cost of remediation. This environment is unprecedented in the last century in Australia.\"\n\nWhile bullish on their long-term viability, Johnson says the banks face increasingly challenging headwinds, well beyond the margin squeeze of a low interest rate environment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cCompetition will certainly increase, particularly with open banking. And how they respond to that has not become clear.\n\n\u201cThey will almost certainly always be strong institutions because APRA won\u2019t let them backslide, but how are they going to remain competitive, with the pressure from new entrants, technology and this political issue?\"\n\nThe regulatory headwinds also seem unlikely to abate, as post-Hayne litigation takes shape in the courts and customer remediation programs continue.\n\nSome European banks have toyed with so-called negative interest rates, charging customers for deposits.\n\nRod Sims, the feared chief of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, has made it clear he even wants to revisit the topic of competition in banking.\n\nAlthough Liberal MPs had pushed back against the move, the tough talk on rates from the Prime Minister and Treasurer sent decidedly mixed signals to the banks.\n\nIf something doesn't give, the big fear is that the big four, like the RBA, will be pushed into unconventional methods. Some European banks have toyed with so-called negative interest rates, charging customers for deposits.\n\nAs funding cost pressures accelerate, some onlookers have suggested Australia's banks may even be tempted down this path. Alternatively, they may look at reintroducing charges such as ATM fees, which have emerged as a solution in low-margin cycles before.\n\nNational Australia Bank chief customer officer and former New South Wales premier Mike Baird has said maintaining profitability is crucial in enabling the bank to \"lend, back small businesses to grow and ultimately support the economy\u201d.\n\nIt seems lack of trust is no longer the big banks' biggest headache.", "description": "A spat between the federal government and big banks over variable home loan rates has shone a light on the uncharted waters the banking system is wading into.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1.6444%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/ba90ee6113d78b7b197fb5c59f43690dc3b495a2", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
