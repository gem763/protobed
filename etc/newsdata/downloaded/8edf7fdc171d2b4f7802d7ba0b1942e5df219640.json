Then the hate groups came to Charlottesville, ostensibly to protest the monuments\u2019 removal. The violent clashes that led to the death of Heather Heyer and the injury of dozens, and the sight of Confederate flags waving alongside Nazi flags, brought new urgency to the conversation about the meaning of Confederate symbols.\n\nCities like Baltimore and New Orleans quietly sent their monuments packing. Descendants of General Robert E. Lee and General Stonewall Jackson have said statues of their ancestors have become tributes to white supremacy and need to go. And many brought up the words of Lee himself, who was opposed to memorializing the Confederacy after the war was over.\n\nBut one group of citizens remains unconvinced\u2014the 13 plaintiffs in the lawsuit known as Monument Fund v. Charlottesville.\n\nThe people and organizations suing to stop the city from moving its Confederate statues straddle a spectrum that ranges from First Families of Virginia to a heritage organization that has members who were here August 12 with a secessionist, neo-Confederate gang.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got the bow tie, upscale people tied to the League of the South people who want to secede and are slavery apologists,\u201d says activist and UVA professor Jalane Schmidt.\n\nThree years ago, some City Council members and local activists raised the idea of removing the Confederate statues from downtown. The city appointed a community commission that spent months examining the issue and ultimately presented City Council with two options to consider: relocating the statues to McIntire Park or re-contextualizing them by transforming the existing sites. In February 2017, City Council voted 3-2 to remove the Lee statue, and in April voted to sell it.\n\nThen came August 12. Following the trauma that made Charlottesville a national hashtag, former \u201cno\u201d votes Mike Signer and Kathy Galvin joined Wes Bellamy, Kristin Szakos, and Bob Fenwick in saying that both the Lee and Jackson statues should go.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the issue in the lawsuit: whether councilors violated Virginia state law, which forbids the removal of war memorials, when they voted to send the Confederate generals on their way.\n\nThe lawsuit is approaching its second anniversary March 20. It\u2019s scheduled to be in court March 11, but plaintiff spokesman Buddy Weber is dubious that it will go to trial then because Jones Day, one of the largest law firms in the world, is representing four of the five councilors and has asked for a jury trial.\n\nIn the two years the case has been active, Judge Rick Moore has ruled that the councilors do not have immunity and are personally liable for voting to remove the monuments.\n\nIn January, Delegate David Toscano carried a bill to allow localities to decide for themselves whether they want Confederate statues in their midst. The bill was killed in subcommittee.\n\nWhile much has been written about\u2014and much blame thrown at\u2014those who first raised the idea of removing Confederate monuments from the center of town, very little attention has been paid to those still fighting the city\u2019s decision. C-VILLE reached out to the plaintiffs to find out why they joined the suit and whether anything had changed for them since 2017.\n\nHere\u2019s what we found out:\n\nEdward Dickinson Tayloe II\n\nTayloe, 76, comes from a First Family of Virginia that was one of the largest slave-owning dynasties in Virginia. His ancestor, John Tayloe II, called \u201cone of the richest men of his day,\u201d built Mount Airy plantation in Warsaw.\n\nJohn Tayloe III, ancestor of lawsuit plaintiff Edward Dickinson Tayloe II, was one of the wealthiest men of his generation and \u201cbred horses and slaves,\u201d says the New York Times review of Richard Dunn\u2019s A Tale of Two Plantations.\n\nTayloe\u2019s great-great-grandfather, Benjamin Ogle Tayloe, invested in his brother Henry\u2019s plan to start a cotton plantation in the Black Belt of Alabama in 1835, according to Richard Dunn\u2019s 2015 book, A Tale of Two Plantations: Slave Life and Labor in Jamaica and Virginia.\n\nAn 1807 ban on importing slaves had opened the domestic slave trade for Virginia and other coastal states. The Tayloes had a surplus of enslaved laborers at their Mount Airy plantation and they sent them to the Deep South.\n\nIn 1838, the Tayloe brothers forced 57 slaves to walk 800 miles to Alabama, where most were sold. It was \u201cthe cruelest act that I have found recorded in the Tayloe papers,\u201d writes Dunn.\n\nBenjamin Ogle Tayloe continued to send rebellious slaves to Alabama as a warning to remaining slaves, says Dunn.\n\nBetween 1833 and 1854, the Tayloes marched 120 enslaved people to Alabama, and another 98 were sent during the Civil War, says Dunn. The domestic migration of enslaved people separated families, made Virginia a major slave exporter, and further enriched the Tayloes.\n\nPlaintiff Tayloe\u2019s father, Edward Thornton Tayloe IV, was vice-chair of the Charlottesville Redevelopment and Housing Authority when the decision was made to raze the African American community of Vinegar Hill over the objections of its residents, many of whom were unable to vote on the issue because of a poll tax.\n\nAnd the plaintiff, a portfolio manager, was past president of the Lee-Jackson Foundation, which has an endowment of nearly $4 million, according to 2014 IRS filings, and awards scholarships to students who write essays examining the legacies of the Confederate generals.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Tayloe saw combat during the Vietnam War and served in Special Forces, and has a \u201cspecial interest in the protection and preservation of war memorials in the city.\u201d The Lee-Jackson Foundation contributed money in 1997 to the restoration of the Lee and Jackson statues, says the suit.\n\nA woman answering the phone at the Tayloe residence referred a reporter to spokesperson Weber.\n\nThe plaintiff\u2019s cousin, Tayloe Emery, who lives at Mount Airy plantation and who used to work at C-VILLE Weekly, bristles at a reporter\u2019s inquiry about whether family members share his uncle\u2019s enthusiasm for Confederate monuments. He writes in an email, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that our family name is being dragged around by the media and that reporters have the audacity to ask me stupid questions, like \u2018do all of your family support Confederate monuments?\u2019\n\n\u201cThe answer is of course, no. The vast majority of my Virginia family are against Confederate monuments and anything that pays lip service to white nationalism in any way, shape, or form. Though many of us do in fact disagree with this lawsuit, we still support family members who may think differently on the subject and we hope that through continued conversation that they might see things from a different perspective and understand the bitter feelings and abhorrent racism associated with Confederate monuments.\u201d\n\nSays Schmidt, \u201cFor generations this family has been roiling the lives of black people, and this is what [plaintiff Tayloe] chooses to pursue.\u201d\n\nAnthony Griffin\n\nBritton Franklin Earnest\n\nVirginia Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans\n\nSmithfield resident Tony Griffin, 57, is a Sons of Confederate Veterans \u201ccommander,\u201d and Frank Earnest, who lives in Virginia Beach, holds the title \u201cheritage defense coordinator.\u201d\n\nEarnest, 63, has been representing the Sons for almost 30 years, he says. \u201cWe are the bloodline descendants of the Confederate Army,\u201d and when people start \u201cmudslinging\u201d about the Confederacy, they\u2019re \u201ctalking about my great-great-grandfather.\u201d\n\nThe Sons of Confederate Veterans contributed money to the 1997 restoration of the Lee and Jackson statues, and to the litigation, according to the lawsuit. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see monuments to defending our state removed,\u201d says Earnest.\n\nEarnest was in town August 11, 2017, for a Katie Couric interview and then got the heck out of Dodge. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty bad when you know a riot is coming,\u201d he says.\n\nBut the violence and open white nationalism of the Unite the Right rally have not changed Earnest\u2019s mind about Confederate monuments. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that comes or goes. They honor our ancestors.\u201d\n\nAnd he maintains the SCV has nothing to do with the white supremacist and neo-Nazi groups that showed up here, adding that it advised its members to stay away. \u201cWe have always denounced racist groups over our hundred-year history,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have nothing to do with those people.\u201d\n\nYet some Sons of Confederate Veterans members were here and hold dual affiliations with League of the South, which describes itself as a \u201cSouthern nationalist organization.\u201d Its website honors John Wilkes Booth for his service \u201cto the South and humanity.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re an organization of thousands,\u201d says Earnest when asked about brothers George and Gregory Randall. He believes they\u2019re still SCV members. \u201cI don\u2019t think we determined anyone in SCV did anything that rose to the level of complete expulsion.\u201d\n\nAnd, he says, Sons of Confederate Veterans are \u201cin no way associated\u201d with League of the South.\n\nSons of Confederate Veterans member George Randall carries the flag of neo-Confederate League of the South at Unite the Right. Photo: Rodney Dunning\n\nGregory Randall, who portrays General Stonewall Jackson in Civil War reenactments, and his twin George were in Charlottesville August 12 with League of the South.\n\nGeorge Randall, who lives near Fredericksburg, says he keeps his memberships separate and describes Sons of Confederate Veterans as a \u201chistorical\u201d group while League of the South is \u201cmore political.\u201d\n\nOf the latter, he explains, \u201cWe\u2019re secessionists.\u201d He cites his ancestors and the Lost Cause narrative in objecting to Confederate monument removal. \u201cWe were invaded.\u201d And he insists, \u201cThe war had nothing to do with slavery.\u201d\n\nHe also blames Wes Bellamy for the whole monument mess, and says Bellamy is a \u201cblack supremacist.\u201d\n\nSays Randall, \u201cI\u2019m tired of everything being about race, race, race.\u201d He objects to being called a white supremacist for wanting to \u201cprotect our culture. If you stand up for your people, you\u2019re a Nazi or racist. It has nothing to do with hate.\u201d\n\nRandall was here for a lawsuit hearing in 2017 to provide security for an unnamed person, he says, but did not seem keen on returning for the upcoming court date because the last time he was here, his tires were slashed.\n\n\u201cI think Charlottesville sucks,\u201d he says, denouncing \u201canarchist communists\u201d and \u201cantifa\u201d whom he says threw urine and feces at him and his League of the South colleagues August 12. Says Randall, \u201cYou can\u2019t wear a MAGA hat. I think it\u2019s a crying shame.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid we have a couple of rogue members in Charlottesville?\u201d queries Earnest. \u201cProbably, but we told them not to come.\u201d\n\nIs there a perception that the Sons of Confederate Veterans is a racist organization? \u201cHow much more prejudiced and bigoted can you be to ask that?\u201d says Earnest, who has had a lot of experience talking to the press, not all of it to his satisfaction.\n\nFor instance, he was not pleased with a November 28 Washington Post story about him titled \u201cSins of the Fathers: The Confederacy was built on slavery. How can so many Southern whites believe otherwise?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was very disappointed,\u201d he says.\n\nCharles L. Weber Jr.\n\nBuddy Weber was in the U.S. Navy for 27 years, serving as a combat pilot before getting his law degree from UVA in 1998. He was chair of the city GOP, and in 2013, he ran for City Council with former city cop Mike Farruggio.\n\nAttorney and Vietnam War vet Buddy Weber worries that if memorials to unpopular wars can be removed, Vietnam War monuments could be next. Photo: Elli Williams\n\nWeber, 73, initially was appointed defense attorney for Heather Heyer\u2019s murderer, James Fields, but cited his role in the lawsuit as a conflict of interest.\n\nHe says he signed on as a plaintiff for two reasons. As a lawyer and firm believer in the rule of law, \u201cit\u2019s my earnest belief City Council had violated the law, whether you believe the statues should stay or go,\u201d he says.\n\nAnd as a veteran of the \u201cvery unpopular\u201d Vietnam War, he worries that those memorials could be next, negating the sacrifice citizens made of life and limb to defend this country. Virginia state law \u201cprotects these memorials from the shifting tide of public opinion,\u201d he says.\n\nIf the General Assembly decides to change that, it can, he says, but he thinks Toscano\u2019s bill to allow localities to make their own decisions about Confederate monuments is \u201ca cop out.\u201d\n\nWeber also distances himself from those who showed up to support the Confederate monuments in 2017, taking the battle to court instead. \u201cWe do it without lighting tiki torches,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t personally feel tarred because we have no association with them.\u201d\n\nLloyd Smith\n\nThe founding partner of law firm Tremblay and Smith and a founder of Guaranty Bank and Virginia Broadcasting, the parent company of today\u2019s NBC29, died last summer at age 85.\n\nFrom 1997 through 1999, the former Marine represented a private group of citizens who raised money to restore the Lee and Jackson statues. That was a major reason he signed onto the lawsuit, says his son, Garrett Smith.\n\n\u201cThe city agreed to maintain the statues in perpetuity,\u201d he says, adding that his father always felt that when he represented people as clients, he continued to represent them.\n\nLloyd Smith \u201chad a great love of history\u201d and would visit Civil War battle sites, says Garrett Smith. \u201cHe believed the facts of the Civil War and the oppression of enslaved people was a history that needed to be told and understood.\u201d\n\nAccording to Smith, when Weber and attorney Fred Payne were helping to organize the lawsuit, they knew his father as \u201ca Democrat and he represented a different group. He wasn\u2019t a hardcore conservative Republican.\u201d\n\nHe says his father was saddened by the events of August 2017, but Garrett Smith doesn\u2019t think that changed his father\u2019s mind about the statues. \u201cThe city had become a flashpoint for a larger national debate.\u201d\n\nFrederick W. Payne\n\nAttorney Fred Payne declined to comment for this story. In the first court hearing on the case May 2, 2017, Payne testified as an expert on Civil War uniforms because he \u201cgrew up with Confederate insignias since he was 10 years old.\u201d\n\nFred Payne, an attorney and lawsuit plaintiff, has testified as an expert on Civil War uniforms. Staff photo.\n\nThe founder of Payne and Hodous in 1992, he serves as county attorney for Fluvanna, and was deputy county attorney for Albemarle from 1974 to 1987. He was also was an assistant commonwealth\u2019s attorney for the county in 1979, according to the Payne and Hodous website.\n\nPayne graduated magna cum laude from Yale, and got his law degree at UVA. He\u2019s been president of the Charlottesville Albemarle Bar Association, as well as head of the city and county criminal bar association.\n\nOne of Payne\u2019s better-known cases was his defense of widow Shirley Presley, who, in 2002, strung razor wire to block Rivanna Trail hikers from a path on her property along the river. The Rivanna Trail Foundation neglected to get her permission or an easement for that portion of the trail. A judge ruled in Presley\u2019s favor on a code violation, and she settled her $1.5 million lawsuit against the city and foundation in 2008.\n\nJohn Bosley Yellott Jr.\n\nThe Monument Fund\n\nJock Yellott is the fourth plaintiff in the lawsuit who\u2019s an attorney. He\u2019s also executive director of the Monument Fund, a nonprofit formed in October 2016 to help fund the statues\u2019 defense. In 2017, it raised nearly $119,000, according to its IRS 990 form.\n\nBecause of his fundraising, Yellott, 64, has a financial interest in the outcome of the suit, and he conducts history tours describing the monuments, according to the complaint. He testified that he walks his dog through Market Street or Court Square parks daily. He did not return C-VILLE\u2019s call.\n\nBetty Jane Franklin Phillips\n\nPhillips, 82, is described in court documents as a collateral descendant of Paul Goodloe McIntire, who donated the controversial statues and the once-segregated parks they inhabit, along with a number of other monuments, parks, and buildings around town. The Keswick resident is a Lane High School graduate. She did not respond to phone messages from C-VILLE.\n\nEdward Bergen Fry\n\nNed Fry, 31, is the youngest of the plaintiffs. His great uncle Henry Shrady was the sculptor McIntire hired to create the Lee statue, and Shrady also did the Ulysses S. Grant statue in Washington near the Capitol.\n\nFry is himself a sculptor and graduated with a degree in sculpture from Virginia Commonwealth University. The CHS grad did not get back to us to discuss further his participation in the lawsuit, but at a 2016 Blue Ribbon Commission on Race, Memorials and Public Spaces hearing, he said he was in favor of keeping the statues because, \u201cThey are historical works of art and, more importantly, because Henry Shrady is my great-great-great uncle.\u201d\n\nVirginia C. Amiss\n\nThe 94-year-old plaintiff remembers riding the trolley from downtown to the Rotunda when she was 7 years old to take violin lessons, and that\u2019s when she decided she wanted to study nursing at UVA, she wrote to Virginia magazine in 2010. She graduated in 1946, and worked at UVA and in Houston, as an operating room supervisor.\n\nAmiss had had dental surgery and didn\u2019t feel up to talking when C-VILLE reached her, and she did not respond a follow-up call.\n\nWhile she is suing to keep the Confederate statues, she was not a fan of other sculptures installed around town by the city\u2019s Art in Place program, a nonprofit dedicated to public art. In 2005, she asked City Council to eliminate the $5,000 it gave to the program. As Cvilleindymedia.org reported, \u201cAt the last meeting, her immortal words rang out: \u2018Rearranged junk is still junk.\u2019\u201d\n\nOn Facebook, she supports prayer in school\u2014and in the White House.\n\nAnd through marriage, Amiss is related to Unite the Right organizer Jason Kessler. According to Ancestry.com and U.S. Census records, her husband, Lester \u201cRandy\u201d Amiss was first cousin to Kessler\u2019s great-grandfather, LaSalle Norvell.\n\nStefanie Marshall\n\nAlbemarle resident Marshall is chair of the Monument Fund and has \u201cpersonally expended money and effort in cleaning graffiti from the Lee monument in 2011 and 2015,\u201d says the complaint.\n\nShe and her husband own construction company M3, which specializes in masonry. The company supports the Fraternal Order of Police, Live Arts, The Paramount Theater, Albemarle Charlottesville Historical Society and various local charitable organizations, according to its website.\n\nThe lawsuit is not the first time the county resident has had a problem with city government. In 2016, she took issue with City Council\u2019s decision to honor Khizr and Ghazala Khan, and told council: \u201cIt seems to me that in order for a Gold Star family to be honored and recognized by the current City Council, they must speak at the Democratic National Convention. This is not appropriate, nor is it acceptable. It reeks of choosing to honor specific families or individuals because they fit your narrative.\u201d\n\nMarshall, 52, did not respond to a message from C-VILLE.\n\nCorrection March 7: Tayloe Emery is a cousin, not nephew of Edward Tayloe, and this Stefanie Marshall did not graduate from Albemarle High.", "description": "", "authors": ["Lisa Provence", "C-Ville", "Matt", "Lisa"], "top_image": "https://www.c-ville.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/TW170921_620.jpg", "published_at": "2019-03-06"}
