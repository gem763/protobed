(AP) - Richard Mandella experienced the highest high and lowest low at Santa Anita on Saturday, with Omaha Beach successfully winning his comeback after a six-month layoff while another of the trainer\u2019s horses died of a suspected heart attack.\n\nFormer Kentucky Derby favorite Omaha Beach rallied to beat 1-5 favorite Shancelot by a head in the $300,000 Santa Anita Sprint Championship.\n\nHours earlier, Ky. Colonel dropped dead after a jog on the training track, Mandella confirmed to The Associated Press.\n\nIt was the 33rd horse death at the track and second in Mandella\u2019s barn since December.\n\n\u201cIt was devastating,\u201d Mandella told the AP by phone. \u201cI can only remember one other heart attack in 40 years of training.\u201d\n\nKy. Colonel, a 5-year-old gelding, had five wins in 20 career starts and earnings of $138,505. He last raced in May at Golden Gate Fields in Northern California. He was owned by Preston Madden.\n\nKy. Colonel returned to Mandella\u2019s barn about 10 days ago after being turned out at a farm for some rest, the trainer said. The gelding wasn\u2019t involved in a timed workout when he collapsed.\n\n\u201cI wish I knew the answer,\u201d Mandella said.\n\nKy. Colonel will undergo a required necropsy to confirm the cause of death.\n\nLater, Omaha Beach\u2019s victory earned him an automatic berth in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Sprint next month over the same track. The colt doesn\u2019t have a lot of experience as a sprinter, however.\n\nUrged on by Mike Smith\u2019s left-handed whip, Omaha Beach hooked up with pacesetter Shancelot past mid-stretch and they dueled to the finish in front of 7,466.\n\nOmaha Beach ran six furlongs in 1:08.79 and paid $7.20, $2.40 and $2.10 at 5-2 odds. It was the colt\u2019s fourth straight win and first since the Arkansas Derby on April 13.\n\nShancelot returned $2.10 and $2.10, while Flagstaff was another 2 1/2 lengths back in third and paid $2.10 to show in the six-horse field.\n\nMandella said that besides the BC Sprint, the BC Mile and the BC Classic are also under consideration for Omaha Beach.\n\nSmith called Omaha Beach a throwback to the kind of classic horses that can race anywhere from three-quarters of a mile to 1 1/4 miles.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s extremely fast and he\u2019s got tremendous stamina,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWhen you need him to be quick, he is. He can do it all.\u201d\n\nThe colt was the favorite for the Kentucky Derby in May, but he was found to have an entrapped epiglottis that forced him out of the race. He later had throat surgery.\n\nThe colt was set to return sooner, but a virus kept him from running at Del Mar. Then he was going to run in Kentucky, but a workout leading up to the race didn\u2019t go well, so Mandella changed plans yet again.\n\nSeeing nothing else suitable, the Hall of Fame trainer kept Omaha Beach at his home track for the Grade 1 race.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just very relieved to have him back,\u201d Mandella said.\n\nEarlier in the day, about 50 workers and supporters of horse racing rallied outside the track\u2019s main entrance.\n\nThey toted signs expressing their love of horses and support for the jobs and lifestyle the industry provides in California. Passing motorists honked and waved in support.\n\nProtesters have trod the same ground in recent months to criticize the deaths of 32 horses at the track since December and urge that the sport be abolished. However, none of them was among the pro-racing crowd at the rally, where a five-piece band played and trainer Doug O\u2019Neill delivered tacos for lunch.\n\n\u201cJust want to be a voice of how proud we are of our horses and our jobs and our lives,\u201d said O\u2019Neill, who trained Kentucky Derby winners I\u2019ll Have Another in 2012 and Nyquist in 2016. \u201cTrainers, grooms, hotwalkers, exercise riders, we\u2019ve chose this as our career. It\u2019s very important to keep our voice very much alive and at the forefront.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Neill said he expects more such rallies or as he called them \u201ccelebrations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many workers both frontside and backside that just feel paralyzed,\u201d he said. \u201cHaving these kind of celebrations where we can all talk together and be with each other and really show that we are truly the backbone of the business, this is the reality, the love, the passion.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Neill and others holding signs expressed dismay that protesters have been heard more loudly than those who participate daily in the industry.\n\n\u201cWe know what our issues are,\u201d said Christine Sanchez of Lake Forest, who has owned racehorses and is now a breeder. \u201cWe\u2019re not just sitting back.\u201d\n\nJames Corral, a retired jockey who rode 11 years on the Southern California circuit, said he wishes the protesters would better educate themselves on the issues.\n\n\u201cI would like them to know a lot more before they announce and promote,\u201d he said.\n\nDallas Keen, a 62-year-old trainer who has been involved in racing for most of his life, said he supports the reforms instituted by The Stronach Group, which owns Santa Anita.\n\n\u201cPeople are being extra cautious now as maybe they weren\u2019t before,\u201d he said. \u201cThese horses get the best life any animal could have.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Neill said he believes reforms involving medication, veterinary records, and training have created positive results.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing this over 30 years and I\u2019ve never seen one thing of animal abuse,\u201d he said. \u201cIf there was an accidental fatality due to abuse, that\u2019s one thing. We got hardworking people that have chosen to care for horses for their livelihood and we\u2019re getting hit over the head. It doesn\u2019t add up to me.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Richard Mandella experienced the highest high and lowest low at Santa Anita on Saturday, with Omaha Beach successfully winning his comeback after a six-month layoff while another of the trainer's horses died of a suspected heart attack.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Beth Harris"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/05/santa_anita_horse_racing_31877_c0-165-2520-1634_s1770x1032.jpg?3d4ffab48a3f11d68dd86aa7ee4a9c8eed8dbaa6", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
