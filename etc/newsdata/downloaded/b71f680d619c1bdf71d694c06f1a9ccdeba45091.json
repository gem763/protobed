If so, you need to think again.\n\nBecause the greatest of all pharaohs was not from Egypt.\n\nHe was called Taharqa and came from the Kingdom of Kush in what is now Sudan.\n\n'He ruled everything from what is today Khartoum all the way down the Nile through Egypt to the Mediterranean,' says Pearce Paul Creasman, professor of anthropology at the University of Arizona.\n\nChannel 4 documentary Lost Pharaohs Of The Nile, recounts 'Black Pharaohs' living in The Kingdom of Kush including Taharqa (pictured leading a festival)\n\n'The territory he controlled was probably more by volume than at any other time in Egyptian history.'\n\nThe story of Taharqa and the other 'Black Pharaohs' from Kush is told in a fascinating Channel 4 documentary, Lost Pharaohs Of The Nile.\n\nThey were not the pale-skinned Egyptians we associate with pharaohs, but black Africans.\n\nAnd they were just as powerful and sophisticated as their northerly neighbours.\n\nThe Kingdom of Kush flourished from around 1,000BC to 350BC, more recently than the more famous pharaohs Tutankhamun and Ramses II, who ruled before 1,000BC in Egypt.\n\nDuring the Kush period, the two kingdoms vied for power, and between about 760BC and 650BC, notably during the reign of Taharqa, the Black Pharaohs controlled all of Egypt and Kush.\n\nRachael Dann (pictured) of the University of Copenhagen, explores the burial chamber of Queen Qalhata, wife of one of Taharqa's predecessors\n\nYet they've been overlooked throughout history, and the programme follows historians and archaeologists working in Sudan who are determined to restore their reputation.\n\n'There was persistent denial that black Africans could have built a powerful civilisation worthy of the same attention and respect as Egypt,' says Geoff Emberling, archaeologist at the University of Michigan.\n\nYet the ancient Kush city of Mero\u00eb boasts more pyramids than in all of Egypt.\n\nTaharqa's pyramid is at the royal necropolis of Nuri, and although it has been explored already, there is another pyramid, or a burial chamber deep beneath it, that has yet to be fully explored.\n\nIt is completely flooded by the waters of the Nile, and the documentary follows Professor Creasman and his team as they dive to explore what lies beneath the murky waters.\n\nProfessor Creasman and his team explore a burial chamber beneath Taharqa's pyramid at the royal necropolis of Nuri. pictured: The Royal Pyramids of Meroe, Kush's third capital\n\n'As far as I am aware no one has dived a tomb anywhere in the world before, and certainly no one has dived a pyramid,' says Professor Creasman.\n\nThe first bucket they pulled up brought with it shards of Kush pottery and gold leaf, suggesting great treasures could lie beneath.\n\nIndeed, Prof Creasman is certain there is a sarcophagus with the remains of King Nastasen, who ruled the Kingdom of Kush between 335BC and 315BC.\n\nThe professor intends to return next year to find out more.\n\nBut he \u2013 and all the other experts working in Sudan, including Rachael Dann of the University of Copenhagen, who is exploring the burial chamber of Queen Qalhata, wife of one of Taharqa's predecessors \u2013 will have a race against the clock.\n\nThere are plans to build hydroelectric dams which could flood important sites, as the building of the Aswan Dam in Egypt in the 1960s caused sites there to be destroyed.\n\nJust as the kingdom of the Black Pharaohs is being rediscovered, much of it could soon be lost.\n\nLost Pharaohs Of The Nile, 13 October, 8pm, Ch4.", "description": "New Channel 4 documentary, Lost Pharaohs Of The Nile, examines the overlooked history of 'Black Pharaohs' living in the Kingdom of Kush, now known as Sudan.", "authors": ["Harry Wallop For Weekend Magazine"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/01/17/19164676-0-image-a-8_1569946579142.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
