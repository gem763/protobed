The dispute began after a South Korean supreme court ruling last year ordering Japanese companies to compensate Koreans forced to work in Japanese mines and factories when the Korean peninsula was a Japanese colony. But Japan insists that all compensation claims were settled by a postwar peace treaty.\n\nThe decision triggered a trade spat that has since spread to the tourism sector, and even preparations for next summer\u2019s Tokyo Olympics.\n\nIn the ad, the 97-year-old model Iris Apfel is asked by the 13-year-old designer Kheris Rogers how she dressed when she was her age. Apfel replies: \u201cI can\u2019t remember that far back.\u201d But the version with Korean subtitles gave Apfel\u2019s reply as: \u201cOh my God, how can I remember what happened more than 80 years ago?\u201d\n\nThe Korea Herald said some viewers interpreted the time reference as an attempt to ridicule former sex slaves and forced labourers, whose recollections of abuses have been questioned by rightwing politicians and academics in Japan.\n\nIn response, Uniqlo pulled the ad in South Korea and from its YouTube account days after it first appeared, but said it had not intended to cause offence.\n\n\u201cThe advertisement in question is a part of a global advertisement series to mark the 25th anniversary of fleece and it has no links to any political or religious agendas, belief or organisations, but we decided to stop airing the ad as we take it seriously that many people felt uncomfortable,\u201d Uniqlo said.\n\nIt said the Korean-language subtitles had been worded that way to highlight the age gap between Apfel and Rogers.\n\nSome historians say the Japanese imperial army coerced or tricked as many as 200,000 women and girls \u2013 most of them from Korea \u2013 to serve in frontline brothels.\n\nUniqlo, which has 186 stores in South Korea, was already among several high-profile targets of a South Korean boycott of Japanese goods.", "description": "Japanese clothing company pulls advertisement from South Korean TV after outcry", "authors": ["Justin Mccurry"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eed0c06e001f61538f64f750b93a5432d5c09afc/667_0_4579_2748/master/4579.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=875828c0755c1222f26398214a66e9ee", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
