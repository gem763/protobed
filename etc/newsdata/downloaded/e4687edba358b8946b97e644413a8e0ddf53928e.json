Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nLast night, the New York Times reported that Alexander S. Vindman, the top Ukraine expert in the National Security Council, will testify to the House that he expressed grave concerns about President Trump\u2019s politicized extortion of Ukraine\u2019s president. Vindman will be the first White House official who took part in the July 25 phone call to testify. The Republican response to Vindman\u2019s testimony is already clear: They are smearing him as a Ukrainian spy.\n\nThe Times reports that, in his capacity as NSC Ukraine adviser, Vindman was often contacted by Ukrainian officials who were confused about the extortionate demands being made on them by Rudy Giuliani. Laura Ingraham seized upon this sentence last night:\n\nOh my God, look at the spin they are using right now, actually saying that Vindman is a Ukrainian double agent....this is so freaking bananas pic.twitter.com/ritg9QcNgV \u2014 KRK (@Page1ANews) October 29, 2019\n\n\u201cHere we have a U.S. national-security official who is advising Ukraine while working inside the White House apparently against the president\u2019s interest,\u201d said an incredulous Ingraham on her nightly show. \u201cIsn\u2019t that kind of an interesting angle on this story?\u201d former Bush-administration lawyer John Yoo replied. \u201cSome people might call that espionage.\u201d (Alan Dershowitz, the third member of the colloquy, smiled along.)\n\nThis morning on Fox News, the smear campaign continued. \u201cIt seems very clear that he is incredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense,\u201d said former congressman Sean Duffy. \u201cI don\u2019t know that he\u2019s concerned about American policy \u2026 We all have an affinity to our homeland where we came from \u2026 he has an affinity for the Ukraine.\u201d Fox & Friends host Brian Kilmeade added, \u201cWe also know he was born in the Soviet Union, emigrated with his family. Young. He tends to feel simpatico with the Ukraine.\u201d\n\nVindman is a decorated Army lieutenant colonel and an Iraq War veteran with a Purple Heart. That, of course, does not mean his conduct cannot be criticized. But Vindman testifies that he reported all his concerns over Trump up the chain of command, following procedure and working within official channels.\n\nIt was the object of his concern, Rudy Giuliani, who was going around official channels. Indeed, Giuliani was pressuring Ukrainian officials not only on behalf of Trump as a private client \u2014 a completely inappropriate interference in foreign policy \u2014 but also on behalf of the Russian gangsters who were paying him and running a side hustle shaking down Ukraine\u2019s energy department.\n\nThe Republican position is that there\u2019s no loyalty problem involved in having American foreign policy conducted by an off-the-books lawyer with no security clearance who was apparently on the payroll of the Russian Mafia. The security problem is the NSC official advising an American ally about how to deal with the goons demanding that the ally subvert the independence of its judicial system and insert itself into the American election, and also that it give the goons a little taste of the gas-import business. The Republicans\u2019 logic is that Giuliani and his sleazy clients represent \u201cthe president\u2019s interest,\u201d as Ingraham put it. And the president\u2019s interest, however corrupt or improper, is the national interest. If you are working at cross-purposes with Rudy and his thugs, you must be disloyal to America.", "description": "The New York Times reports Alexander S.
