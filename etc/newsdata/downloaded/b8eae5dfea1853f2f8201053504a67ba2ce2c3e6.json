Also, he should be locked up in solitary confinement.", "language": "en", "text": "We must end Trump\u2019s assault on norms of political civility by \u2026 assaulting the hell out of those same norms?\n\nDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure Waters believes he\u2019s entitled to a criminal trial before he\u2019s thrown in a dungeon.\n\nWe\u2019re about 10 days into this Ukraine business and already we have the president demanding that the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee be arrested for treason and Waters insisting that Trump himself be sent to the hole. What are the tweets going to look like after he\u2019s actually impeached?\n\nI'm calling on the GOP to stop Trump's filthy talk of whistleblowers being spies & using mob language implying they should be killed. Impeachment is not good enough for Trump. He needs to be imprisoned & placed in solitary confinement. But for now, impeachment is the imperative. \u2014 Maxine Waters (@RepMaxineWaters) October 1, 2019\n\n\u201cThe people who talk this way about Trump wouldn\u2019t stop at Trump,\u201d says Tim Carney. Indeed. This isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s fantasized about locking Trump up either, notes The Hill. I can\u2019t help but suspect that boasting to Republican voters that their favorite politician will lose not just office but his freedom if Democrats have their way isn\u2019t the best pitch to win over righties troubled by the Ukraine business.\n\nMeanwhile:\n\nWhy isn\u2019t Congressman Adam Schiff being brought up on charges for fraudulently making up a statement and reading it to Congress as if this statement, which was very dishonest and bad for me, was directly made by the President of the United States? This should never be allowed! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2019\n\nHopefully someone\u2019s explained to him by now that misleading the public about a conversation the president had, as Schiff did at last week\u2019s hearing, is douchey and unfair but it isn\u2019t \u201ctreason.\u201d Next that person can explain to him why it\u2019s not a crime of any sort. You don\u2019t need to be a lawyer to be a good president but restraining your impulses to arrest your political opponents will at least get you in the ballpark of respecting the Constitution. To borrow Carney\u2019s line, a person who talks this way about Schiff wouldn\u2019t stop at Schiff.\n\nOne other wrinkle to Waters\u2019s tweet. It\u2019s basically Democratic boilerplate at this point that Trump deserves prison but claiming that he deserves solitary confinement is a strange flourish. I don\u2019t know why Waters thought of that; all I can guess is that she wanted to suggest that Trump should be tortured, that \u201cmere\u201d prison is too good for him, and settled on solitary confinement as the most politically correct way to make that point. The irony is that that\u2019s not really politically correct anymore among supporters of criminal justice reform. Paul Manafort\u2019s stint in solitary confinement this past summer inspired a brief wave of commentary about how SC is in fact a form of torture, especially when it\u2019s accompanied by draconian conditions like total darkness for most or all of the day. Waters is actually catching some flak from progressives for endorsing it on social media this afternoon. You have to go pretty far in insulting Trump for lefties to say, \u201cToo far.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s Colbert last night with Hillary Clinton kicking off a \u201cLock! Him!
