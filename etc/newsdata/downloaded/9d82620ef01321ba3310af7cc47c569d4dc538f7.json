And, in true Kylie style, she was ever-dedicated to her outfit with a mic, top hat, and blonde wig. She also had her BFF Stassie Karanikolaou dressed at Britney Spears, and the two filmed a little tribute to the pop stars' iconic performance by dancing around to \"Like a Virgin\" and kissing:\n\nNote to self: Must step-up this year's Halloween costume.\n\nFollow Abbi on Instagram.\n\nLike this article?
