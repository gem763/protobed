He is free on his own recognizance.\n\nIn addition, prosecutors have said they intend to have up to a dozen other women not associated with the criminal charges testify that Gooding behaved like that with them in similar settings \u2014 bars, hotels and restaurants \u2014 as far back as 2001.\n\nThe judge, Curtis Farber, said he'll rule in December on whether any of those women can take the witness stand.\n\nHeller has argued the case against Gooding is an example of the #MeToo movement run amok and that overzealous prosecutors are looking to turn \"commonplace gestures\" into crimes.", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
