Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nDon\u2019t scratch Ezekiel Elliott from the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 starting lineup Sunday against the New York Giants just yet.\n\nPer multiple reports, the running back left his holdout headquarters in Cabo San Lucas in hopes that a contract extension with the Cowboys will be finalized before the Week 1 home game against their NFC East rivals. Elliott is expected to be in Texas on Tuesday.\n\nInitial chatter Tuesday indicated the two sides were close to a deal for a $90 million, six-year extension that would tie Elliott to Dallas through 2026.\n\nElliott bolted for Mexico in July as the Cowboys boarded a team charter for Oxnard, Calif., site of their summertime training camp.\n\nElliott, 24, has two years remaining on his rookie contract and is scheduled to earn $3.853 million in 2019 and $9.099 million in 2020. The two-time NFL rushing champion is targeting a deal that would make him the highest-paid player at the position.\n\nAccording to ESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter, a five-year contract extension with right tackle La\u2019el Collins expected to be official on Tuesday freed up almost $6 million in salary cap space. Some of that could be earmarked for Elliott, although the Cowboys have a queue of skill-position talent waiting to be paid.\n\nQuarterback Dak Prescott, who did not hold out, is reportedly chasing a contract worth $35 million or more per season.\n\nWide receiver Amari Cooper is in the final year of his deal, and the receiver market continues to escalate. Saints star Michael Thomas signed a $100 million deal averaging $20 million over five years in August, and Falcons All-Pro Julio Jones is in line to raise the bar higher in his ongoing negotiations with Atlanta.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Don't scratch Ezekiel Elliott from the Dallas Cowboys' starting lineup Sunday against the New York Giants just yet.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190903&t=2&i=1425799381&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF821DB-OCASP"}
