Standing at the San Antonio Spurs scorer\u2019s table around the midway point of the first quarter, he simply tied his shorts, caressed powder into the palm of his hands and stepped on the court to make his Wizards debut.\n\nPlaying his first game since April 7, Thomas, who missed all of preseason and the first two games while recovering from a left thumb injury, playednearly 20 minutes of the Wizards\u2019 124-122 loss to the Spurs. Thomas recovered from a slow shooting start to hit 6 of 14 attempts for 16 points. He also finished with five assists and three rebounds.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\"I haven\u2019t played in a real game in a while so it was just getting a feel for the game,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThe first half was tough for me, I couldn\u2019t even like feel the ball. It was just different for me, so I was just happy to be out there and be able to compete for my teammates. My teammates were happy for me so that was great and I\u2019m just glad to be back.\u201d\n\nThe ball might have felt weightless in his hands, but old habits never quite die. Seconds after Thomas got his first touch, a shot went up. It missed, as did his next three shots.\n\nStill, Thomas, who has a career average of 13.8 field goal attempts per game, didn\u2019t hesitate. He figures that if he is to return to his normal self this season with the Wizards, he can\u2019t let up.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI mean, that\u2019s just who I am. I\u2019ve got to play the right way. Play to my strength, which is scoring the basketball and making plays,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cMy job is to be aggressive and to make plays and score. That\u2019s what I\u2019m going to do no matter what.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBradley Beal is one of the three remaining players on the Wizards\u2019 roster from the 2017 Eastern Conference semifinals against Boston. That playoff series was also the last time Thomas, who averaged 28.9 points that season, starred as a dynamic scorer. Since, Thomas has been stalled by a hip injury, which required arthroscopic surgery in 2018. The procedure limited Thomas over the past two seasons as he bounced around the league. But on Saturday night, Beal recognized his old foe in a familiar uniform.\n\n\u201cI.T. did an excellent job, his first game back,\u201d Beal said of his new teammate. \u201cHe gave us a lot of energy, a lot of offense, running the team. He came in, was a huge spark for us.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nOne I.T. time play happened at the 9:11 mark of the second quarter when Thomas hit a running, one-legged jumper. The unorthodox shot from about 25 feet out swished but Thomas\u2019s shoe was so close to the line that the field goal was initially ruled as two points. Eventually, after a review, the scorer rewarded Thomas with his second three-pointer of the half.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cNot too many people cannot play a game in six weeks, play in San Antonio, and have the game he had,\u201d Coach Scott Brooks said of Thomas, a two-time all-star. \u201cOnly a few people in the league can do that. He plays with toughness, and obviously there was rust tonight, and he is unsure of himself on the offensive end with the rhythm of our plays, and with the strengths and weaknesses of the players out there. It will all come along and it\u2019s a long process.\u201d\n\nAfter that shot, Thomas concluded his first rotation and returned to the sideline, where he adjusted a heating pad on the area of his right hip. Later, during his second-half stint, Thomas\u2019s efficiency improved as he made 4 of 8 attempts.\n\nAD\n\nThough Thomas didn\u2019t check his wrist Saturday night, he believes that soon it will be his time again.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI felt good. I mean, know I\u2019m going to be rusty. I know it\u2019s going to take some time to get back to where I was before injury but I\u2019m going to take it day by day,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be some bad days, there\u2019s going to be some good days but I\u2019m going to be even keel throughout the process knowing that if I keep taking steps forward, I\u2019m going to get closer to where I was and hopefully surpass that.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "Thomas scored 16 points in just over 19 minutes Saturday night against the San Antonio Spurs.", "authors": ["Candace Buckner", "National Basketball Association With An Emphasis In Covering The Washington Wizards."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/n6X9c7hx5ysWIpJ5sEkVKGCzlzE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/TXGR7BXYN4I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
