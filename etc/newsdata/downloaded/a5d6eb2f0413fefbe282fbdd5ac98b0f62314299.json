She said the issue is so special to her, it stays in its sleeve.\n\n\u201cI have had this Destiny issue for just over 4 years, it still stays in its sleeve. It\u2019s no secret what a pivotal role Noni Gasa played in my life when it comes to building my self-esteem and loving myself as I am,\u201d the 31-year-old wrote.\n\nThe presenter went on to provide statistics showing that when young women see people who look like them in major media, they see themselves in a better light, accept their looks and celebrate their features. Which is what Noni did for a young freckled Hulisani.\n\n\u201cStudies show that better representation in media and advertising can have a positive impact on girls. 8 in 10 South African women say that this would enable girls to grow up without feeling that they are being judged just on their looks and 8 in 10 believe that it would mean that girls were not held back by gender stereotypes.\u201d\n\nHulisani celebrates herself so much that even when others try to put her down, she rises above the negativity and shows kindness and maturity instead.\n\nThe Venda beauty also praised Noni for her hard work and determination.\n\n\u201cIt is for the reasons above that this cover made an impact on me the way that it did. For years we had known and seen Noni in front of the cameras and on the runway. This cover was different because the focus was not her beauty, style, and grace, but instead it told the story of how she had packed her life, moved overseas to further her studies, and had now returned to head up PR for Woolworths. Just when I thought Noni couldn\u2019t inspire me more, she did. She was more than her looks, I have no doubt she always knew that, but because of this cover and this story, the world did too.\n\n\u201cSeeing someone who looks like you being represented in the media like this can never be underrated. It reminded the little girl in me that just because I look different from many other children, my dreams and goals are still valid. It reminded me that even though I look different from other children, I still matter.\u201d\n\nOver the years Noni Gasa has proven to be a force to be reckoned with, and most recently the Project Runway SA judge launched a bursary for one deserving student seeking to pursue a career in fashion.\n\nShe\u2019s passionate about unearthing the next generation of African talent and is calling for applications from prospective design students who are unable to afford private education. With sponsorships from Woolworths, Elna and Rain, the winning candidate will have their full tuition as well as their living expenses covered for three years, to the value of R460 000.\n\n\u201cThe success of Thebe Magugu, Laduma Ngxokolo and Rich Mnisi have made it possible for the African child to dream more audaciously and they are proof that we have all it takes to compete against the best in the world. I believe that, through this incredible opportunity, we\u2019ll discover and develop the next big name in the game and an ambassador for the African continent,\u201d Noni said.", "description": "Representation matters, especially for the marginalized.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9218/594db007119e4ef983da5cf275ba3450.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
