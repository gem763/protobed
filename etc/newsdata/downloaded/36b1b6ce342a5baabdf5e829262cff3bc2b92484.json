Greenwood will play definitely, first start since Cardiff last year, and he needs game time.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a process,\u201d Solskjaer added. \u201dIt\u2019s for them to grow as players and human beings, and being robust enough to go out at Old Trafford.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to get results and if you don\u2019t throw them in you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got. I don\u2019t see any other way of doing this, I\u2019ve always done it wherever I\u2019ve been. That\u2019s my belief as a coach: to give a chance, an opportunity.\u201d\n\nGreenwood became the youngest United player to represent the club in Europe since Norman Whiteside in March, when he appeared as a substitute in the famous 3-1 victory over Pairs Saint-Germain.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s still very young but he\u2019s been maturing in the last six months since I came in,\" Solskjaer said regarding the young striker, who only turns 18-years-old next month.\n\n\u201cI remember the kid who just wanted to play with mates in the U18s, and now he\u2019s knocking on the door and his appetite for football must be growing.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t want to put too much pressure on him. Go out there, enjoy yourself, work hard and make the right finish. He\u2019s one of the best finishers I\u2019ve seen.\u201d\n\nThough United\u2019s treatment room remains busy, Diogo Dalot and Jesse Lingard are available to Solskjaer once again after recovering from a hip injury and illness respectively.\n\nFred is likely to feature, with Solskjaer hoping that the \u00a352m signing can rejuvenate his United career after a difficult first year at the club.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been patient, working hard. He\u2019s not a young boy but he\u2019s still young in his English career and hopefully he will kick start his season tomorrow.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see more and more of Fred. He\u2019s had some great games in midfield with Scott against PSG and Arsenal, and we\u2019re just waiting for that to flourish.\u201d", "description": "Mason Greenwood and Axel Tuanzebe are set to start Manchester United\u2019s\u00a0Europa League opener against Astana as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer turns to youth in Europe.
