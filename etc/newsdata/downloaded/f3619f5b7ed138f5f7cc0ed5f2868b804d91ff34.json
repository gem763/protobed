Andy Vasquez, Staff Writer, @andy_vasquez\n\nFLORHAM PARK \u2014 Sam Darnold is the face of the Jets\u2019 franchise. So it\u2019s understandable that fans, teammates and coaches are excited about his return to the field Sunday against the Cowboys (4:25 p.m., CBS).\n\nThere\u2019s hope that the 22-year-old can jump start the Jets\u2019 struggling offense. But in the three games that Darnold missed with mononucleosis, things were bad enough that it\u2019s obvious he won\u2019t be able to turn this thing around on his own.\n\n\u201cYou are what your record says you are, and right now we\u2019re not a very good offense,\u201d offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains said. \u201cSam is not a magic wand. He is a really good player that is going to lift the execution of this team and he\u2019s a really gifted player with the ball in his hands and we\u2019re really excited to have him. But there\u2019s still things we need to clean up, fundamentally, technically, to make sure the other 10 guys are going about their job the right way.\u201d\n\nThe Jets (0-4) scored only nine points on offense in the three games Darnold missed. And their only touchdown was a gift: they capitalized after the Eagles muffed a punt in the red zone on Sunday. Much of that is on Luke Falk, the third-string quarterback who was forced into action after backup Trevor Siemian (ankle) as lost for the season.\n\nNew York Jets quarterback Sam Darnold (14) drops back to pass during the first half against the New Orleans Saints at MetLife Stadium.

But it was more than just Falk. Most obviously, the offensive line was dreadful, leading to a shakeup before the Eagles game: right tackle Brandon Shell was benched for Chuma Edoga and injured left guard Kelechi Osemele was replaced by Alex Lewis.\n\nBut everyone had a hand in the struggles.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not executing the way we need to up front and it\u2019s not always just the line,\u201d Loggains said. \u201cIt\u2019s a wide receiver not running the right route, it\u2019s a [running] back chipping when he\u2019s not supposed to chip, it\u2019s a quarterback holding the ball too long \u2026 It\u2019s not one thing, there\u2019s a bunch of things. We need to clean it up as fast as we can. It needs to happen faster, we need to execute that stuff better, we need to coach it better.\u201d\n\nDarnold is going to make the Jets\u2019 offense better no matter what. He\u2019s already proven that he can make an impact at this level. But he won\u2019t make it much better if the Jets keep making the same mistakes, and he knows it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said it since we\u2019ve been together: This offense is capable of a lot, capable of scoring a lot of points,\u201d Darnold said. \u201cIt\u2019s just up to us as an offense to go out there and execute and do it.\u201d\n\nDarnold says that having two weeks of practice time to get ready for the Cowboys will be helpful. He feels like his conditioning close to where it was before the mono, and his arm feels good. But it\u2019s been more than a month since he\u2019s played and he knows that there will be an adjustment period.\n\nSam Darnold of the NY Jets during pre game warm ups before the 2019 season opener between the Buffalo Bills vs the New York Jets from MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ on September 8, 2019.

The doctors cleared him, so that\u2019s no longer a risk. But Darold is still taking precautions.\n\nHe\u2019ll wear specially fit padding around his abdomen, and because it doesn\u2019t restrict his movement Darnold plans to wear it for the rest of the season. It will be a constant reminder of the mono that knocked him out for three games, but Darnold says taking a big hit to the midsection isn\u2019t a concern for him.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m out there playing, I\u2019m not worried about guys hitting me or anything,\u201d Darnold said. \u201cI\u2019m trusting the guys up front to do their thing and I\u2019m trusting the receivers to go out and get open when it\u2019s time to pass the ball. So for me, it\u2019s all about trust. When I do get hit, I know that I\u2019m not in danger anymore. [The doctors are] letting me go out there and play because it\u2019s safe, so I\u2019m not worried about that.\u201d", "description": "Sam Darnold is the face of the Jets\u2019 franchise.
