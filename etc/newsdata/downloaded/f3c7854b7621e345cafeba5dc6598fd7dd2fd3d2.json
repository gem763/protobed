They found him looking ashen-faced and discovered a \u2018pulsing abdominal mass\u2019.\n\nIt also stated that Nilsen had been left to \u2018lay in his own faeces, deteriorating for two-and-a-half hours\u2019 after rejecting the opportunity to be seen for longer in the healthcare wing on the morning of May 10 last year.\n\nLisa Noble, the head of healthcare at Full Sutton, said Nilsen had been reluctant to engage previously with healthcare assistants in the prison.\n\n\u2018He did not particularly like healthcare, and he did not particularly like healthcare staff,\u2019 she told the day-long hearing.\n\nThe inquest heard how, like all men over the age of 65, Nilsen was offered an abdominal aortic aneurysm screening on the NHS, but turned it down.\n\nProfessor Marks was told how the chances of the aneurysm being fatal would have been significantly reduced had it been discovered at a screening before it had ruptured.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
