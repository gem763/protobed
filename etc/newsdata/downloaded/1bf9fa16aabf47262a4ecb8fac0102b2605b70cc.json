We can't move anywhere\".\n\n\"Try and get a pram past on the pavement. You just can't, it's always chocker,\" she said.\n\nNeighbour Georgina Robinson said: \"They say they can park anywhere because they pay road tax and there are no double yellow lines.\"\n\nSome people \"can get aggressive, so it can be intimidating\", she added.\n\nImage caption Almost 50 vehicles have been removed from residential roads\n\nAdam Jupp, from Manchester Airport, said: \"We're working with the council on a scheme to publicise firms with secure parking so people can make an informed choice.\n\n\"We've also been working with the city's highways team on changes to the road layout - yellow lines and closing off one-way streets - to hopefully disrupt some of this behaviour.\"\n\nCouncillor Rabnawaz Akbar, executive member for neighbourhoods, said: \"This problem has not gone away and there is still work to be done, but I am confident the message is starting to sink in. Wythenshawe cannot be treated as an overflow car park.\"", "description": "Manchester City Council asked residents to report issues after some cars were vandalised.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D1F5/production/_101794735_parking.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
