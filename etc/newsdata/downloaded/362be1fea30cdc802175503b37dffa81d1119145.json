According to a report by BBC, a British woman discovered a horrible issue in the Galaxy S10 that lets anyone unlock the phone using the fingerprint sensor.\n\nThat means you probably can go around and unlock anyone\u2019s Galaxy S10 phone. The device uses an ultrasonic 3D sensor to register your fingerprint and unlock the phone \u2014 or at least it\u2019s supposed to.\n\nAs The Sun reported earlier this week, a British woman bought a cheap gel-based screen protector off eBay, and she registered the fingerprint of her right hand. Later she found she could use her unregistered fingerprint from her left hand to unlock the phone.\n\nSamsung said it\u2019s aware of the issue and will soon fix it through a software update. Till then, if you own a Galaxy S10, you should turn off the fingerprint unlock functionality, and use any alternative methods such as face unlock, or password to unlock your phone.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ivan Mehta", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F02%2FSamsung-Galaxy-S10-fam-3-of-10.jpg&signature=6a6566adc7f1a8dbf7537195151e52cb", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
