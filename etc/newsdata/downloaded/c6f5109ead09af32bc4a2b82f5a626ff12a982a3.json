The\n\nblue-chip Dow was nominally lower than last week's close.\n\nBoeing Co BA.N and Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N shares led\n\nboth the S&P 500's and the Dow's declines.\n\nBoeing dropped 6.8% after Reuters reported that text\n\nmessages between two employees suggested the planemaker misled\n\nthe Federal Aviation Administration about the safety of the\n\ngrounded 737 MAX aircraft. Johnson & Johnson announced it would recall baby powder in\n\nthe United States after regulators found trace amounts of\n\nasbestos in a sample, sending its shares falling 6.2%.\n\nGrowth of China's gross domestic product slowed to its\n\nweakest pace in nearly 30 years as the bruising trade war with\n\nthe United States took its toll, stoking fears of slowdown\n\ncontagion. The International Monetary Fund has lowered its forecast for\n\nglobal growth this year to 3%, which would mark the slowest\n\nexpansion since the financial crisis. \"There's no question that there's signs out there that the\n\neconomy is weakening,\" said Peter Cardillo, chief market\n\neconomist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.\n\nToday's market weakness \"has to do with (GDP) news out of\n\nChina, Boeing and Johnson & Johnson,\" Cardillo added, saying\n\n\"market sentiment in terms of earnings is positive.\"\n\nThird-quarter earnings season has hit full stride, with 73\n\ncompanies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 83.6% have\n\ncome in above average estimates, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nStill, analysts currently see S&P 500 earnings dropping by\n\n3.1% compared with last year, which would mark the first\n\ncontraction since the earnings recession that ended mid-2016.\n\nSchlumberger NV SLB.N gained 1.3% after the oilfield\n\nservices company posted its largest quarterly loss ever as a\n\nresult of a $12 billion charge as Chief Executive Olivier Le\n\nPeuch moved to shift focus toward software and services.\n\nAmerican Express Co AXP.N reported better-than-expected\n\nthird-quarter profit as consumers boosted their spending. Still,\n\nthe credit card issuer's shares dipped 2.0%. Coca-Cola Co's KO.N revenue beat expectations and an\n\nupbeat forecast gave its shares a 1.8% boost. Kansas City Southern KSU.N jumped 7.3% after the railroad\n\noperator also beat profit expectations, on increased petroleum\n\nshipments to Mexico. Next week, market participants look forward to high profile\n\nresults from Procter & Gamble Co PG.N , United Parcel Service\n\nInc UPS.N Caterpillar Inc CAT.N , Boeing, Microsoft Corp\n\n, Ford Motor Co F.N , 3M Co MMM.N , Twitter Inc\n\nTWTR.N , Amazon.com , and others.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 255.68 points,\n\nor 0.95%, to 26,770.2, the S&P 500 lost 11.75 points, or\n\n0.39%, to 2,986.2 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 67.31\n\npoints, or 0.83%, to 8,089.54.\n\nOf the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, seven closed in the\n\nred, with tech , communications services and\n\nindustrials suffering the biggest percentage declines.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a\n\n1.03-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.41-to-1 ratio favored decliners.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 29 new 52-week highs and two new lows;\n\nthe Nasdaq Composite recorded 51 new highs and 59 new lows.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 6.24 billion shares, compared\n\nwith the 6.55 billion average over the last 20 trading days.", "description": "US STOCKS-Boeing, J&J, dismal China data drag Wall Street lower", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXNPEC1A06T_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
