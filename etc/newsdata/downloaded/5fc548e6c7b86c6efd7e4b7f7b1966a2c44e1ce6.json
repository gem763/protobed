Key to the investigation will be determining whether Wray's partnerships with his players counted as salaries or benefits in kind, and what exactly was declared to the salary cap manager.\n\nSaracens responded to questions from Sportsmail in March by insisting that all co-investment and the house-sharing between Wray and players had been declared.\n\nHowever, some weeks later Premiership Rugby (PRL) issued a statement announcing there would be a formal review into the evidence as they were not aware of all the co-investment arrangements 'between connected parties and players'.\n\nSaracens blamed a 'minor internal oversight' for not having disclosed all the details and denied any wrongdoing, issuing a statement saying that 'co-investments are not part of the salary regulations'.\n\nPRL declined to comment.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE BY LAURA LAMBERT: The new Premiership season will start under the cloud of the salary cap investigation into Saracens, as a judgment may not be made until next month.", "authors": ["Laura Lambert For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/21/19805554-0-image-a-37_1571257199448.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
