It represents everything they hate about this country. It represents not just gun owners and Second Amendment supporters, but those who vote Republican, those who are mostly rural, those who participate in hunting culture, those who are from small towns, those who aren\u2019t like the snobby and insufferable morons who infest our country\u2019s cities. The Left hates these people. They\u2019re the lesser-educated country bumpkins who, to them, are preventing this nation from reaching its full potential in the political correctness Olympics. Those who are stopping a far-left extremist agenda, like taxpayer-funded abortion up until the moment of birth. We\u2019re in the way. And because of that, they have to go after the institutions that protect and fight for our interests. In San Francisco, the progressive cesspool of a city decided to label the NRA, the nation\u2019s oldest civil rights organization, a domestic terror group (via Fox News):\n\nThe San Francisco Board of Supervisors has passed a resolution declaring the National Rifle Association a \u201cdomestic terrorist organization\u201d and urged the federal government to do the same \u2013 the latest escalation in the heated rhetoric from Democrats regarding the NRA in the wake of several deadly mass shootings. The resolution, which passed Tuesday and says the U.S. is \u201cplagued by an epidemic of gun violence,\u201d accuses the NRA of using \u201cits considerable wealth and organization strength to promote gun ownership and incite gun owners to acts of violence.\u201d \u201cAll countries have violent and hateful people, but only in America do we give them ready access to assault weapons and large-capacity magazines thanks, in large part, to the National Rifle Association\u2019s influence,\u201d the resolution says. The document resolves to assess the relationships that those who do business with the city have with the group and says \u201cthe City and County of San Francisco should take every reasonable step to limit those entities who do business with the City and County of San Francisco from doing business with this domestic terrorist organization.\u201d [\u2026] \"This ludicrous stunt by the Board of Supervisors is an effort to distract from the real problems facing San Francisco, such as rampant homelessness, drug abuse and skyrocketing petty crime, to name a few,\u201d the statement said, according to KTVU. \u201cThe NRA will continue working to protect the constitutional rights of all freedom-loving Americans.\"\n\nThere is no such thing as \u201cassault weapons,\u201d so we once again have to deal with the idiocy and ignorance of the Left when it comes to gun rights, firearms, and the U.S. Constitution. Millions of Americans own AR-15 rifles. There are untold millions of high-capacity magazines and violent crime is still low. Even with the recent rash of mass shootings, they\u2019re not increasing in frequency and neither are school shootings. There aren\u2019t enough dead bodies to change my mind on Second Amendment rights. I will remain entrenched in my support for gun rights. So, go ahead\u2014call me a monster, left-wingers. I hate you too.\n\nThere has to be a realization that we share next to nothing with these cretins. They\u2019re dangerous. They\u2019re anti-American. And they can\u2019t be trusted. I mean look at San Francisco, a bastion of homelessness, hypodermic needles, and crap everywhere. That\u2019s governance under Democrats for you. So, before you get your rocks off going after the NRA, maybe clean up your own cesspool first.", "description": ".10/02/2019 12:26:47PM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien", "Guy Benson", "Timothy Meads", "Katie Pavlich"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/71/5a51771e-17fe-497a-8d50-df5d97d5e8b2.png"}
