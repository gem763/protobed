At the Samsung Developer Conference today, the company teased a new device that folds more like the clamshell phones of olds.\n\nIt\u2019s an intriguing form factor \u2013 one that\u2019s already alleged to show up in the rumored Motorola RAZR phone next month. By folding vertically rather than horizontally, the device is able to maintain a more typical smartphone size and aspect ratio when open. This should make the device more familiar to use and provide a more comfortable aspect ratio for watching movies. But once folded, it takes up a smaller footprint.\n\nAttendees of #SDC19 got a sneak peek at a brand new form factor Samsung is exploring for the foldable category of devices. #SamsungEvent pic.twitter.com/rGtpvNj0SJ \u2014 Samsung US Newsroom (@SamsungNewsUS) October 29, 2019\n\nIt seems like it could provide a good compromise between the Galaxy Fold\u2019s productivity and a traditional phone\u2019s comfort and familiarity, though Samsung teased some new functionality too, such as folding the phone halfway to prop the camera up during a stream. Because the screen appears to be smaller than the normal Galaxy Fold\u2019s, it could come at a lower price point too.\n\nUnfortunately, Samsung didn\u2019t do much else beyond teasing. There\u2019s no word on when we\u2019ll hear more about the device, or even confirmation on whether it\u2019ll ever come to fruition; Samsung says it\u2019s \u2018exploring\u2019 new form factors. Still, considering the company was encouraging developers to make their apps ready for the new folding mechanism, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see it pop up in the next year or two.\n\nFor more gear, gadget, and hardware news and reviews, follow Plugged on Twitter and Flipboard.", "description": "", "authors": ["Napier Lopez", "October"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/plugged?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2FSnag_16e7896.png&signature=cf922ef29399a60a82b2165f043a6cc4", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
