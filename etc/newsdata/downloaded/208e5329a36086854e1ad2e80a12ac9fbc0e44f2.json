In others the haircuts are different and a \u201cgender neutral facial structure\u201d is used, says the Emojipedia website.\n\nThe attempt at on-screen inclusivity has not pleased everyone however, with some suggesting the icons indicate how gender-nonconforming people should look.\n\n\u201cHow do u determine that these emojis are how gender-neutrality should be represented or that these emojis even represent most gnc people,\u201d wrote one Twitter user.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why they weren\u2019t just all neutral to begin with,\u201d wrote another.\n\n\u201cRegular old smileys were neutral. I don\u2019t know why we had to go and start gendering everything in the first place.\u201d\n\nWhen it unveiled the designs earlier this year, Apple said they would \u201cbring even more diversity to the keyboard\u201d and \u201cfill a significant gap\u201d in the selection of emojis.\n\n\u201cUsers will now be able to select any combination of skin tone, in addition to gender,\u201d it said.\n\nApple also serves up some niche offerings in the new update including a plate of falafel, a skunk and a banjo.\n\nBusinesses have paid increasing attention to becoming more inclusive in recent times.\n\nToy maker Mattel for example released gender-neutral dolls last month with none of the curves or large muscles of the traditional Barbie or GI Joe, while many small fashion brands and make-up companies are marketing non-binary products.", "description": "San Francisco (AFP) \u2013 Apple has put out new gender neutral emojis of most of its people icons \u2014 including punks, clowns and zombies \u2014 as", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/7ff7d0_apple-gender-neutral-emojis-haircuts-clothes-or-facial-structures-differ-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
