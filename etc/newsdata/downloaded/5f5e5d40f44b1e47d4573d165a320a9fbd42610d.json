The nine-dash line is controversial in Southeast Asia because it encompasses maritime territory that is contested by several countries in the region.\n\nThe channel used a different map when covering the story on Scott Van Pelt's \"SportsCenter\" Tuesday night, the Sports Business Journal reported.\n\nESPN declined to comment on the map when contacted by The Hill.\n\nHouston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey's tweet supporting Hong Kong upset China, putting the NBA in the middle of appeasing the country and free speech. Several Chinese businesses have cut ties with the NBA, and NBA events scheduled for this week have been canceled.\n\nESPN's majority owner is The Walt Disney Company, which has its own business interests in China. As a result, ESPN's coverage of the controversy has itself come under heavy scrutiny.\n\nUpdated at 10:05 a.m.", "description": "ESPN is facing backlash for its use of a map during a Wednesday broadcast that showed Taiwan as being owned by China.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/espn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
