There was one on with two outs. They had a three-run lead. Hudson never wanted this; he never wanted to close. He had expressed this before. And there on the mound, with more than 43,000 screaming fans, with the chance to secure a sweep of the St. Louis Cardinals, he felt seized by the moment. He felt adrenaline and anxiety. His control slipped.\n\nBut now it was over. They had the trophy. They were going to the World Series, so Hudson allowed himself to admit the truth.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI hate closing games,\u201d he said. \u201cI hate closing.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s his stuff. It\u2019s the vibe. It\u2019s the way the innings seem to unfold. All of it unnerves Hudson because, although he has been the Nationals\u2019 best reliever since they acquired him at the trade deadline \u2014 posting a 1.44 ERA in 25 regular season innings \u2014 everyone in baseball understands the ninth inning is different. Pitching coach Paul Menhart, Manager Dave Martinez and former closer Sean Doolittle all nodded solemnly when they discussed the mental toughness it takes.\n\nThis pressure is still relatively new to Hudson. He didn\u2019t come up pitching the end of games; the right-hander was once one of baseball\u2019s best young starters with the Arizona Diamondbacks. But back-to-back Tommy John surgeries derailed his career and turned him into a journeyman. The 32-year-old started this season with the Los Angeles Angels, but they released him before the season. He latched on with the Toronto Blue Jays and posted a 3.00 ERA in 48 innings, enough to draw mild interest in a thin trade market.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Nationals acquired him as one of three main pieces to revamp their historically bad bullpen. They used him as the fireman, the pitcher they would deploy with runners on base or against the toughest part of the lineup. He succeeded right away, stranding nine of his first 10 inherited runners. Then he became the team\u2019s most important reliever.\n\nDoolittle suffered a knee injury around that time in mid-August and landed on the injured list. Martinez needed to replace him, so he tapped the hot hand. The right-hander protested, but the manager held firm. Martinez framed the transition to Hudson as no big deal because, no matter when he pitches, he needs to \u201cclose\u201d an inning.\n\n\u201cI know the ninth inning\u2019s a different beast. I get it,\u201d Martinez said. But he told his relievers, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about what inning it is; just get outs\u201d \u2014 because he \u201cwanted them to understand that\u2019s the way they need to approach it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHudson remained hesitant because he thought his stuff didn\u2019t suit the role. He threw too many strikes and allowed too much contact; he relied on a four-seam fastball or slider 90 percent of the time; he didn\u2019t have \u201cthat big, sweeping breaking ball that lot of [closers] have.\u201d\n\nAnd something went haywire every time he pitched the ninth, he noted, such as broken-bat singles or bloopers. He called his success at stranding runners \"fluky.\" He repeated that the team needed Doolittle in the ninth inning to get where it needed to go.\n\nDoolittle returned to the team in early September, but he wasn\u2019t himself. No one else in the bullpen had stepped up, so Martinez kept riding Hudson. Doolittle was unfazed by a transition to the fireman role because he had done just about everything in his career. He didn\u2019t talk to Hudson about how he might handle the ninth inning, but he wasn\u2019t surprised that his teammate didn\u2019t like the role.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of guys that don\u2019t, to be honest,\u201d Doolittle said. Doolittle acknowledged \u201cthere\u2019s no gray area\u201d in closing. You can pitch well and allow a run that\u2019s not your fault. You can make one mistake and cost your team the game. You will, no matter what, be defined by the result. The only comfort is the playoffs somewhat equalize that pressure.\n\n\"In the postseason, the seventh, eighth, ninth all feel the same,\" Doolittle said. \"That energy at the back end of a game . . .\" He trailed off, then nodded toward Hudson's locker. \"He's handled it really well.\"\n\nIn Game 4 against the Cardinals, the situation unraveled quickly. Hudson hit the first batter and walked the second to load the bases. Pinch hitter Matt Carpenter was the go-ahead run. Hudson pounded the strike zone away and, on a 2-2 fastball, got Carpenter to ground out to second base.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe adrenaline and the energy in the stadium got to me a little bit,\u201d said Hudson, who added, \u201cI was just throwing in that eighth inning, and I got away with it.\u201d\n\nAfter the eighth inning, the right-hander sat on the bench. He breathed. His heartbeat slowed. He harnessed the emotional surge, and he left the dugout for the ninth more confident. He felt changed on the mound, and he stopped hurling pitches. He executed them. He threw 10 fastballs, and his last one, belt high and away, got Tommy Edman to lift a flyball to center field.\n\nVictor Robles squeezed the final out. Hudson threw his glove in the air and leaped into the arms of his catcher. It was unbridled joy and presented a paradox that, even later in the clubhouse, he seemed unsure how to reconcile. He thought of that moment, and right after he confessed \u201cI hate closing,\u201d he admitted another truth: \u201cBut that's the best feeling in baseball.\u201d\n\nThat trade-off is stressful, and it\u2019s uncomfortable. But it\u2019s one he wouldn\u2019t mind making again.\n\nMore on the Nationals:\n\nAD", "description": "The reliever isn\u2019t keen on the role, but he got it done in the NLCS finale and is set to have the same role in the World Series.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/HaAwXd7yK5th3L10oMpsa_t6vvs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NT2RLXXR5II6TO362IBG5YGBTE.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
