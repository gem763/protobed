What else is there to say?\n\nIt\u2019s so glaringly corrupt that Mulvaney felt obliged to acknowledge at one point today that even he was skeptical at first about hosting a diplomatic event at a business owned by Trump. But \u2014 wouldn\u2019t you know it \u2014 he\u2019s reliably informed that the Trump National Doral resort is in fact the perfect physical location to host such an event.\n\nFifty states, 300 million people, untold millions of properties, and Trump\u2019s own business turned out to be ideal. For an event to be held in June of next year, when temperatures in Miami will be pushing 90 degrees.\n\nThe saving grace here is supposed to be the fact that the event will be produced at cost, with no profit to Trump. I\u2019m guessing that outside auditors won\u2019t be allowed to verify that. But even if it\u2019s true, it\u2019s obvious how the Trump brand benefits. Retailers are forever lavishing freebies on A-list celebrities because they understand that the publicity derived from doing so will help them move merchandise. Same with Doral and the G7. Philip Klein:\n\nMulvaney also claimed that the Doral has agreed to do the event at cost, and so Trump won\u2019t profit. But there\u2019s no way of ensuring that is the case, and there\u2019s certainly no reason to take the word of this White House on it. Regardless, however, even if the resort somehow doesn\u2019t profit directly from the conference, it will no doubt benefit from the prestige associated with hosting such an event, and be free publicity for the resort on the world stage\u2026 But Trump is simply shameless. He is consistently brazenly dishonest and proudly unapologetic about his statements and actions, because he is incapable of feeling personal shame. In this case, in the midst of an impeachment inquiry stemming from his abuse of power, he\u2019s just going to lean in. What\u2019s especially shameless is that the White House is announcing this in the midst of a daily campaign to attack Hunter Biden for profiting from his dad\u2019s public office.\n\nVirtually every strand of corruption that Trump has been accused of since taking office is present here. Even before he was sworn in he refused to properly divest himself of his business holdings, setting himself up for charges later that he was using his office to profit personally. The question of emoluments, i.e. personal payments from foreign governments, has also dogged him. That\u2019s potentially involved here too. Meanwhile, as Klein says, he\u2019s busy screaming every day about Hunter Biden making money off of his father\u2019s connections. In this case it\u2019s the president himself who\u2019s making money, which makes it appear even more doubtful that he was genuinely concerned about Joe Biden corruptly abusing his office as VP when he leaned on Ukraine to fire its lead prosecutor. He was looking for a dirt on an election opponent, not \u201cfighting corruption.\u201d\n\nBut the most amazing thing is how gratuitous it is. He\u2019s about to be impeached; aides like Gordon Sondland keep coming forward and giving damaging testimony to Democrats; Republicans in the House and Senate are worried about what else might come out and how impeachment might play next fall. On top of all that, they\u2019re furious at his heel turn against the Kurds in Syria. You would think he\u2019d go out of his way not to put them in any new and avoidable cringeworthy political jams. Instead he turns around and awards the G7 to his own business. Even his usual allies can\u2019t explain away this one:\n\nHolding the G-7 at a Trump property is one of the most foolish, unseemly things the WH could do. The President enjoys waiving red flags in front of bulls, but this fight isn\u2019t worth it. \u2014 Ari Fleischer (@AriFleischer) October 17, 2019\n\nIs he trying to get the Senate to remove him? At this point, every Republican who votes on impeachment and removal will be thinking, \u201cIf we don\u2019t get rid of him and he ends up reelected, what insanity will we have to defend two years from now, when he\u2019s no longer accountable to voters?\n\nI\u2019m glad at least that Trump deputized Mulvaney to make this announcement. No one better embodies the essential fraudulence of the tea-party era than this guy, who made a name for himself in Congress preaching small government and greater accountability and now spends his days as a pitiful toady to a strongman, arguing with a straight face that naked conflicts of interest are Actually Good. If he had a shred of dignity, he\u2019d resign.", "description": "Conflict of interest.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/mm.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
