The fact that Atom Smasher finished last should not detract from the excitement that accompanied the smashing of atoms. It was by smashing atoms \u2014 well, splitting them \u2014 that the lab-coated boffins at the Carnegie Institution stretched the boundaries of knowledge.\n\nAtom Smasher the horse was apparently named after a type of machine that was constructed at universities and research centers, including, in 1938, on the campus of the Carnegie Institution for Science. It was officially called the Atomic Physics Observatory \u2014 or APO. With its domed top, the APO resembled an observatory, though it was designed to study the tiny and nearby, not the vast and far away.\n\nWrote The Washington Post in 1937, while it was under construction: \u201cIt looks like the head of a huge robot, but it\u2019s a scientific billiard cue, a gun to shoot protons, neutrons, electrons and other fragments of atoms caroming off other atoms at a speed of hundreds of miles a minute.\u201d\n\nThe contraption was a huge Van de Graaff generator of the sort you can see throwing off sparks and raising hair at science museums. This one was capable of generating 3 million volts.\n\nWhile the dome of an astronomical observatory opens to reveal the telescope within, the APO was sealed and pressurized. A large metal globe rested on legs and was tapered at the bottom like an upside-down teardrop. It was 55 feet tall. A handsome masonry base was built around the legs so the APO would look more like a traditional observatory and less like a death ray.\n\nInside the metal structure were two long loops of rubber that stretched vertically over rollers positioned near metal brushes. Motors spun the rollers, spinning the loops and generating static electricity. Scientists could then use these forces in their experiments, shooting atomic particles at each other (that is, at other atomic particles; not at other scientists).\n\nThe APO had been in operation barely a year when it was involved in an experiment that the Washington Star dubbed \u201cone of the most dramatic in the annals of science,\u201d one that involved \u201ca whispered secret, an exiled old lady, a suggestion dropped at a Washington meeting of the keenest minds in the scientific world, feverish night and day work, and the setting loose of such titanic forces as man has not hitherto dreamed of producing.\u201d\n\nThe lady was Lise Meitner, an Austrian physicist who had fled Nazi Germany and settled in Sweden. Meitner and her nephew Otto Frisch were in correspondence with physicists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann from Berlin\u2019s Kaiser Wilhelm Institute. Meitner realized that the results of an experiment the German pair described could mean only one thing: They had successfully split a nucleus of uranium by bombarding it with neutrons, releasing energy.\n\nA month later, the \u201ckeenest minds\u201d in science happened to be gathered at George Washington University for a theoretical physics conference organized by GWU and the Carnegie Institution. Niels Bohr was among the attendees. Bohr caused a stir when he announced the Germans\u2019 success with nuclear fission.\n\nThe Carnegie people decided to try it for themselves. On Jan. 28, 1939, the team fired up the atom smasher and got the same results.\n\n\u201cThe energy released was infinitesimal,\u201d said Steven Shirey, a senior research scientist in Carnegie\u2019s Department of Terrestrial Magnetism who can see the APO from his office window. \u201cAll they were trying to do was demonstrate it would happen. Before you can build a chain reaction, you have to prove the reaction worked.\u201d\n\nIt was a step toward an even bigger reaction: the atomic bomb.\n\nAdvances in technology eventually rendered Carnegie\u2019s atom smasher obsolete. It last ran in 1975. Its dome was sanded and painted in 2017. Today, the building is mostly used for storage. And on snowy days, kids still come to sled in its shadow.\n\nQuestions, please\n\nSend your questions about the Washington area to answerman@washpost.com.\n\nTwitter: @johnkelly\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.", "description": "The atomic age took a big step forward in an odd building on Broad Branch Road.", "authors": ["John Kelly", "Local Columnist"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/E5RK57GP7MI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
