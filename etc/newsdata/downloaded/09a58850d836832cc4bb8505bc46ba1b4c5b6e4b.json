(Photo: Spirit Halloween/AP/Party City)\n\nNo parent wants their child called out on Halloween for being culturally offensive.\n\nGoogle tells us many search to learn if the costume their child wants to wear might be racist or insensitive. Many of us moms and dads grew up wearing Native American head dresses and Geisha garb and didn't hear boo about it. Sadly.\n\nNow headlines scream about whether it's OK to go door to door dressed as Moana or Aladdin. Well is it?\n\nWe turned to Neal Lester, Arizona State University Project Humanities Director, who has led countless discussions on cultural appropriation to answer that.\n\nCultural appropriation, simply put, is \"taking elements of someone else's culture without permission,\" Susan Scafidi, author of \u201cWho Owns Culture: Appropriation and Authenticity in American Law,\" previously told USA TODAY.\n\nUse that bump as an accessory: 8 adorable and funny ways to dress up your pregnant bump for Halloween\n\nA dose of pure joy: These cute Halloween pet costumes are everything we need right now!\n\nHalloween is a landmine of cultural appropriation examples for parents because, Lester said, \u201cit\u2019s easy to see Disney characters and cartoon character animations and imagine those costumes are safe.\u201d\n\nThey can be. But recent years tell us they aren\u2019t always.\n\nRecent examples of cultural appropriation\n\nMoana costumes have been fiercely debated since the movie\u2019s 2016 debut. Some Polynesian and non-Polynesian groups took issue with dressing up as the female lead.\n\nAuli\u2019i Cravalho, the Hawaii-born actress who voiced the title character, said last year that she had no problem with fans of all ethnicities dressing as her character for Halloween.\n\nAuli'i Cravalho, the actress who voiced Moana in the hit Disney film, said it's OK for people to dress up as her character for Halloween.

Wilson, Getty Images for Disney)\n\nHowever, Disney pulled its Maui costume two years earlier that featured a long-sleeved brown shirt with tattoos like those worn by Polynesian chiefs. The costume received international condemnation.\n\nThe costume\u2019s trouble is with the change of skin color and its markings, Lester said. People didn't understand the culture that those tattoos represent and \"you\u2019re literally wearing someone else\u2019s identity.\u201d\n\nOver the years, other Halloween children\u2019s costumes were also recognized as either racist or insensitive including a prisoner, a hobo, a ninja, Day of the Dead representations, a Native American and Pocahontas.\n\nAnd with movies like \"Black Panther\" and \"Coco\" leading to more culturally diverse costumes, some parents fear wearing the costumes. Other parents are wondering if is OK for their kids to wear them.\n\n\u201cI would say this isn\u2019t a universal question some parents are asking, this is a question that white parents are asking,\u201d Lester said.\n\nCultural appropriation Q&A: Is it OK for a white kid to dress up as Moana for Halloween?\n\nDetails matter in popular kids' costumes\n\nLet's get down to it. Lester doesn't like lists, but if your Halloween costume includes any one of these popular Disney princesses or characters, he offers what mostly amounts to common sense.\n\nThis Aladdin-like costume sold Spirit Halloween has some parents wondering, is this OK for my child? (Photo: Spirit Halloween)\n\nParents should be careful with these costumes:\n\nAladdin , the street urchin turned prince thanks to a genie and Disney movie of the same name.\n\n, the street urchin turned prince thanks to a genie and Disney movie of the same name.

Black Panther, the Marvel comics superhero and one of the Avengers.\n\nBut can your child, not of that race or culture, wear those costumes?\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Lester said, adding. \"I would not darken my skin.\"\n\nSkin darkening, in any respect, \"moves into a whole cultural history,\" he said.\n\nDon't turn admiration into appropriation\n\nLikewise, he said, stay away from embellishing purchased costumes or watch for buying children's costumes with things like:\n\nCulturally significant tattoos\n\nSombreros, ponchos, mustaches or anything that depicts a Mexican stereotype\n\nNative American feathers or anything depicting Native Americans\n\nA bindi or things depicting Indians\n\nBox braids, dreadlocks, Fulani braids, also known as cornrows\n\nHijab\n\nThe list is not exhaustive and Lester said Halloween can turn into a nightmare for someone trying to get creative while \"honoring\" someone else's culture.\n\n\"On some level people have to be more respectful and more mindful, it doesn\u2019t make you any more appreciative,\" Lester said. \"That kind of dressing makes you more suspect.\"\n\nIf a parent still has lingering doubt whether a costume is admiration or appropriation, Lester said pay attention.\n\n\"If a parent is questioning that in any way, it probably suggests to me it\u2019s something you shouldn\u2019t do,\" he said.\n\nMORE SEASONAL STORIES\n\nContributing: Alia E.
