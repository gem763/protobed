In early October, Australian tech firm Power Ledger announced the second blockchain-based energy trial in Japan in order to track surplus solar energy levels and electricity trading. In August, U.S. Department of Energy awarded a $1 million grant to organizations developing a commercial blockchain energy transaction platform.", "description": "Global blockchain apps to generate $19 billion in cumulative revenue over the next decade, hitting an annual market size of $7.7 billion in 2028", "authors": ["Helen Partz"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvMjU2MzYyOGFhNmNiZjE3NWIzM2NmNmRmNjM0MTRmZWMuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
