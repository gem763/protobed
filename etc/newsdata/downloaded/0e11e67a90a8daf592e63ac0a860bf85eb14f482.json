Alston ruled that the law violates the 14th Amendment and forcing couples \u201cto disclose their race in order to receive marriage licenses burdens their fundamental right to marry,\u201d CNN reported.\n\n\u201c(T)he statutory scheme is a vestige of the nation\u2019s and of Virginia\u2019s history of codified racialization,\u201d Mr. Alston wrote.\n\n\u201cThe Commonwealth of Virginia is naturally rich in its greatest traditions,\u201d he added. \u201cBut like other institutions, that stain of past mistakes, misgivings and discredited legislative mandates must always survive the scrutiny of our nation\u2019s most import institution \u2026 the Constitution of the United States of America.\u201d\n\nThe lawsuit against the Virginia State Registrar originated from three couples who said they were denied marriage licenses for not disclosing their race.\n\nAttorney General Mark Herring announced in September a new policy that would be instituted requiring a \u201cDeclined to Answer\u201d box under the race question, plus requiring court clerks to issue marriage licenses \u201cregardless of an applicant\u2019s answer or non-answer to that inquiry.\u201d\n\nThe plaintiffs said at the time that they didn\u2019t think the issue was fully \u201cresolved\u201d and planned on continuing to press the case and have the law removed altogether, The Washington Post reported.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good first step, but as far as we know the case is still going to go forward, and we\u2019re hoping the judge doesn\u2019t declare it moot,\u201d said one of the plaintiffs, Ashley Ramkishun. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t resolve the fact that there\u2019s still a law in place in Virginia \u2014 the state could change its mind at any point in regards to whether the race question is optional or not.\u201d\n\nMr. Alston agreed, saying Mr. Herring \u201cprovided a construction of the statute that is expressly at odds with its plain meaning,\u201d and while the clerks \u201cswore to uphold General Herring\u2019s interpretation,\u201d Mr. Herring\u2019s \u201cinterpretation lacks the force of law.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
