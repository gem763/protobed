At the time Eskom said the tariff awards left it with a projected revenue shortfall of about R100 billion.\n\nEskom said in a statement on Friday its board of directors had decided to challenge the tariff awards after reviewing the reasons for Nersa\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cWe have put in an application for urgent interim relief, which is necessary to avoid financial disaster for Eskom. We are seeking an order to address this shortfall in a phased manner,\u201d Eskom chief financial officer Calib Cassim was quoted as saying.\n\nIn arriving at its decision, Nersa had offset a R23 billion a year bailout granted by the government against Eskom's allowable return on assets, Eskom said, arguing that approach ran counter to Nersa's own methodology and defeated the whole point of the bailout.\n\nEskom's finances are hobbled by its massive R450 billion debt burden, racked up partly to pay for two mammoth coal-fired power stations, Medupi and Kusile. But Eskom also argues its financial position has been severely damaged by years of low tariff awards which have not allowed it to recover its costs. \u2013 Reuters", "description": "Struggling power utility Eskom said on Friday it was challenging in court the regulator's latest tariff decision, a move it said was necessary to avert financial disaster.", "authors": ["Alexander Winning"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/8311/448dc11837cc40d881119da20d26106c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
