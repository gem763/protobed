Mane put Liverpool ahead in the 40th minute with a fine finish. It was his eighth goal of the season and 50th in the league for the Reds. Then, after Leicester equalised, it was Mane who won a penalty when he was fouled by Marc Albrighton and Milner converted the spot-kick.\n\nMOHAMED SALAH (Liverpool)\n\nThe Egypt forward suffered an ankle injury that forced him to limp off during Liverpool\u2019s win against Leicester. Salah was hurt in the last minute after Leicester midfielder Hamza Choudhury trapped the Liverpool star\u2019s ankle under his body with a crude lunge. Reds boss Jurgen Klopp didn\u2019t confirm the extent of Salah\u2019s injury.\n\nJORDAN AYEW (Crystal Palace)\n\nThe Ghana striker scored his third goal of the season to give Palace a VAR-assisted 2-1 win at West Ham. Ayew slotted home from close range in the 87th minute, but it took a long VAR review before Martin Kelly was confirmed as onside when he headed down for the Palace forward to finish.\n\nITALY\n\nKWADWO ASAMOAH (Inter Milan)\n\nGhana defender Asamoah struggled to contain his former club Juventus as Inter Milan lost 2-1 to suffer their first Serie A defeat this season. The 30-year-old \u2014 who won six league titles with Juventus before moving to Inter in 2018 \u2014 got his sixth start this season.\n\nAMADOU DIAWARA (Roma)\n\nGuinean midfielder Diawara, playing just his third game from Roma, suffered a knee injury after half an hour in their 1-1 home draw against Cagliari. The 22-year-old, who arrived at the capital side from Napoli this season, has reportedly suffered a torn meniscus and could be out for up to two months.\n\nFRANCK KESSIE (AC Milan)\n\nKessie scored the winner from the penalty spot to get AC Milan back on the winning trail with a 2-1 victory in Genoa after three consecutive defeats. It was the Ivorian\u2019s first goal this season and extended his impressive record from the spot, converting nine of the 10 Serie A penalties he has taken, including the last four.\n\nCHRISTIAN KOUAME (Genoa)\n\nIvorian Kouame earned a late penalty for Genoa when he was brought down by AC Milan goalkeeper Pepe Reina. But Reina, a 2010 World Cup winner with Spain, denied Lasse Schone from the spot as a winless Genoa run stretched to five games.\n\nGERMANY\n\nACHRAF HAKIMI (Dortmund)\n\nMorocco international Hakimi got on the scoresheet when his fierce cross cannoned off Freiburg defender Lukas Kuebler to put Dortmund 2-1 up in the second half of their 2-2 draw. Hakimi, who scored two goals in Dortmund\u2019s midweek Champions League win at Slavia Prague, was a consistent threat.\n\nSALIF SANE (Schalke)\n\nSenegal centre-back Sane helped Schalke take a late lead at home to Cologne when his towering header was nodded home by midfielder Suat Serdar. However, his side blew the chance to usurp Bayern Munich in top spot when they conceded a 91st-minute goal to draw 1-1 in Gelsenkirchen.\n\nIHLAS BEBOU (Hoffenheim)\n\nTogolese forward Bebou played a crucial role in his side\u2019s surprise 2-1 win at previously unbeaten Bayern Munich. After forcing a save from Manuel Neuer midway through the first half, Bebou\u2019s jinking runs asked questions of a disjointed Munich backline, allowing strike partner Sargis Adamyan to capitalise, scoring twice.\n\nFRANCE\n\nVICTOR OSIMHEN (Lille)\n\nThe 20-year-old Nigerian forward grabbed his league-best seventh goal of the season to salvage a 2-2 draw against Nimes. Osimhen lashed home an equaliser from close range on 79 minutes after a goalmouth scramble. He has scored in all six home games for Lille in all competitions\n\nMOSES SIMON (Nantes)\n\nNantes head into the international break as the closest challengers to Paris Saint-Germain in Ligue 1 after Simon\u2019s 86th-minute header secured a 1-0 win over Nice. The on-loan Nigerian headed in a cross from Kader Bamba for his second match-winning goal since arriving from Spanish club Levante.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 Sadio Mane goes into Senegal\u2019s friendly against Brazil in Singapore on Thursday after playing a pivotal role for Liverpool in a", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/07/5b295c_senegalese-sadio-mane-scores-liverpool-leicester-city-anfield-african-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
