The decision was announced on a post on his personal website and mirrored on Medium. Kibler\u2019s decision, he wrote, is a reaction to what he described as Activision Blizzard\u2019s \u201cincredibly harsh\u201d treatment of Hearthstone pro Chung \u201cBlitzchung\u201d Ng Wai.\n\n\u201cI reached out to Blizzard and informed them that I no longer feel comfortable casting the Grandmasters finals at BlizzCon,\u201d Kibler said in his post. \u201cI will not be a smiling face on camera that tacitly endorses this decision. Unless something changes, I will have no involvement in Grandmasters moving forward.\u201d\n\nAfter winning a match during Hearthstone\u2019s Asia-Pacific Grandmaster tournament on October 6, Chung declared his support for the ongoing protests in Hong Kong. In response, Activision Blizzard suspended Chung from Hearthstone for a year and rescinded his tournament winnings. Chung\u2019s suspension has become an international incident drawing condemnation from U.S. Senators.\n\n\u201cI feel what Blitzchung did was very brave,\u201d Kibler said in his post. \u201cHe knew that his actions would likely have serious consequences, not just for his future in Hearthstone but possibly even for his personal safety, and I commend him for the fortitude that takes.\u201d\n\nKibler pointed out that he did feel that Chung had violated Activision Blizzard\u2019s rules as they\u2019re written, which are incredibly broad. According to Activision Blizzard, Chung was guilty of \u201cengaging in any act that, in Blizzard\u2019s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Activision Blizzard does] not want to set the precedent for their official broadcasts being used as political tools,\u201d Kibler said. \u201cThe players agreed to particular rules for behavior, and [Chung] violated those rules.\u201d Kibler also noted his own politics, but said when he\u2019s working for Activision Blizzard or a similar company, he checks his politics at the door.\n\nBut Kibler thinks Activision Blizzard went too far.\n\n\u201cI could understand a fine, or even a short suspension from competitive play, but removal from Grandmasters, clawing back the prizes he already earned, and banning him for a full year seems completely overboard,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t pretend to understand the intricacies of the geopolitical situation in China and Hong Kong or the full extent of Blizzard\u2019s business interests there, but to me this penalty feels like it is deeply rooted in both.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat kind of appeasement is simply not something I can in good conscience be associated with,\u201dhe said.\n\nBlizzard and Kibler did not respond to our request for comment.\n\nFollow Matthew on Twitter .
