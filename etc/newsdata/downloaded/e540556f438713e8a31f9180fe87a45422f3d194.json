I just broke down and cried when I saw that whole crowd attack my baby.\n\n\"They had my baby and her little cousin handcuffed. My baby was complaining about how tight the handcuffs were.\"\n\nShe tried to step in but the security guards tackled her and pinned her to the ground.\n\nAnother video shows Octavia, wearing striped jumpsuit, was resisting when at least two guards held onto her limbs.\n\nThe incident has caused her early contractions and she had to be rushed to the hospital.\n\nShe explained while she's on the stretcher: \"I'm in the hospital right now because security threw me on my stomach several times and tackled me down.\n\n\"It's not cool.
