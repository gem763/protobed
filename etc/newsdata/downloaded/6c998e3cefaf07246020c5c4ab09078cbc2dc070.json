(AP) - Safety Alohi Gilman thought he\u2019d be on the other side of the Notre Dame-Southern California rivalry when he decided to transfer from Navy three years ago.\n\nUSC was closer to his home in Laie, Hawaii, he has family in California, he knew a number of Trojan players, he liked the school\u2019s storied history and had visited the campus while in high school. Plus, being from the same hometown as former Notre Dame standouts Manti Te\u2019o and Roby Toma, he wanted to set his own course. But he still made a visit to South Bend.\n\n\u201cBefore I even stepped on campus I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m not coming here,\u2019\u201d said Gilman, who back then planned on making another visit to the USC campus.\n\nHe never made it. Although the Fighting Irish were coming off a 4-8 season and the Trojans had just finished 9-3 and ranked No. 3, Gilman said he found a bond with Notre Dame.\n\n\u201cI felt as if the program was going in a better direction, in my opinion, than USC at the time,\u201d he said.\n\nNotre Dame, 4-1 this year and ranked No. 9, beat the Trojans 24-17 last season to finish 12-0 and clinch a playoff berth. The Trojans (3-2) are coming off their first losing season since 2000 and have been inconsistent, handing 15th-ranked Utah its only loss and losing to BYU (2-3).\n\nNotre Dame coach Brian Kelly describes the USC offense as \u201cdeadly,\u201d saying Michael Pittman, Tyler Vaughns and Amon-Ra St. Brown comprise the best receiving corps Gilman and the Irish will face.\n\nPittman ranks 10th in the NCAA in receiving with 35 catches for 501 yards, Vaughns has 31 catches for 414 yards and St. Brown, whose brother Equanimeous was a Notre Dame receiver from 2015-17, has 24 catches for 238 yards. Last year against the Irish, Vaughns had 12 catches for 120 yards and a touchdown, St. Brown had 10 catches for 94 yards and Pittman had seven catches for 91 yards.\n\n\u201cAll three of them are explosive players, can snatch the ball out of the air, run good routes and are able to get separation. So they are part of the full package,\u201d Gilman said. \u201cEach of them has their own skill sets, so together they are a good combo.\u201d\n\nThe Trojans have a different look this year with a quick-strike, pass-heavy offense under coordinator Graham Harrell. Despite using three quarterbacks because of injuries, the Trojans rank 26th in the nation in passing offense at 292 yards and two touchdowns per game\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re keeping pressure on you in that they\u2019re looking to push the ball vertically down the field much more than perimeter quick outs and runs after catch,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThis is a big play offense.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a problem for the Irish with starting cornerback Shaun Crawford out with a dislocated elbow. TaRiq Bracy will be making his second start in Crawford\u2019s place and be backed up by Donte Vaughn, who the Irish hope to redshirt.\n\n\u201cFrom there, that\u2019s where it gets interesting,\u201d Kelly said, noting that after Vaughn the Irish have to depend on inexperienced freshmen. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to be creative in coverages and make sure we put our younger players, if in fact they\u2019re called on, in a position to succeed.\u201d\n\nGilman, who is second on the team with 29 tackles, said the Irish are looking forward to the challenge. He said what makes the rivalry so special is that there are a lot of players like him who were recruited by both schools, which causes \u201cbad blood.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom both sides, although we feel like we\u2019re different, we\u2019re very similar in ways, which kind of makes the rivalry more sweet,\u201d he said.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Safety Alohi Gilman thought he'd be on the other side of the Notre Dame-Southern California rivalry when he decided to transfer from Navy three years ago.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tom Coyne"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/10/notre_dame_gilman_choice_football_17810_c0-128-3455-2142_s1770x1032.jpg?034efda2dc37225288030aa4eca1ab801d366db0", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
