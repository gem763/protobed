His Joker never had a chance", "language": "en", "text": "Would it really be surprising that Jared Leto had tried to stop Todd Phillips\u2019s Joker from being made? This is what a piece in the Hollywood Reporter suggests, though the claim is said to have been denied by a representative for Leto and by Warner Bros.\n\nIt might seem ridiculous to fans that a film that has taken more than $700m (\u00a3541m) at the global box office and (at least initially) wowed critics could have been swatted from the schedules at the whim of an actor who barely appeared as the clown prince of Gotham in 2016\u2019s Suicide Squad. And yet that would be to forget the circumstances in which Leto found himself cast as Batman\u2019s nemesis five years ago, and was subsequently thrown to the slavering hounds by Warner Bros.\n\nIn 2014, when the studio announced that Leto was to star as the Joker, the actor-turned-musician had just won his first Oscar, for playing a transgender drug addict in Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e\u2019s Dallas Buyers Club. Before this, he had hardly acted for five years, preferring to focus on his suddenly successful rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars. By all accounts, Leto was choosing roles very carefully during this period, so it came as a shock (and coup for Warner Bros) when he was announced as the world\u2019s most infamous supervillain.\n\nBy all accounts, Leto threw himself into the role with method mania, reportedly sending a letter and video to fellow stars apologising for not joining them for early rehearsals, accompanying his missive with a live rat for Margot Robbie (his on-screen paramour, Harley Quinn), some bullets for Will Smith (Deadshot) and a dead pig for the entire cast. Warner suits, aware of the potency such a blend of recent Oscar-winner and iconic role would bring to the table, must have been head over heels at the publicity.\n\nWith all this fuss, fans expected Leto\u2019s Joker to emerge as the leader of the Suicide Squad, a gang of colourful Dirty Dozen-style supervillain miscreants put together by questionable authorities (Viola Davies\u2019s Amanda Waller) to take down an even worse threat: Cara Delevingne\u2019s acting. We will never know quite what the original plan was, but when David Ayer\u2019s film finally emerged, Leto was reduced to a bit-part player. A bit of torture here and there, some hanging around with Harley in nightclubs, and then completely absent from the movie\u2019s main narrative.\n\nThe Oscar winner could perhaps have been forgiven for thinking that this would never have happened in the 70s. Imagine if Robert De Niro had gained 60 pounds for Raging Bull, only to be told that his scenes had been excised. Then imagine the shock when Warner green-lit a Joker origins movie starring Joaquin Phoenix as a completely different version of the supervillain. This was precisely the kind of movie Leto probably thought he was going to be making at some point when he signed on to play the part. The dream opportunity to get under the character\u2019s powder-caked skin.\n\nLeto had every chance to assume he'd be playing the Joker in further movies \u2013 otherwise why cast him in the first place?\n\nThis kind of thing would never have happened at Marvel, either. The last time a star was cast in a big role at the Disney-owned studio, then kicked to the kerb, was 2010, when it was announced that Ed Norton, the somewhat sickly green giant in 2008\u2019s The Incredible Hulk, would not reprise the role in The Avengers (unless one counts Terrence Howard\u2019s replacement by Don Cheadle as Colonel James Rhodes in 2010\u2019s Iron Man 2, reportedly over pay). Leto had every chance to assume he would be playing the Joker in further movies over the next decade \u2013 otherwise why cast him in the first place?\n\n'Tormented' Suicide Squad stars have on-set therapist Read more\n\nThanks to Warner\u2019s chaotic approach to comic-book world building, that never happened. The Hollywood Reporter now suggests Leto-Joker is done as a going concern, something that ought to have been pretty obvious as soon as James Gunn\u2019s Suicide Squad 2 and Cathy Yan\u2019s Birds of Prey were announced without the actor\u2019s involvement. In any case, neither movie had an obvious place for the cackling villain, so it would not be a surprise to learn that Leto turned them down \u2013 perhaps fearing a repeat of earlier experiences.\n\nPhillips\u2019s Joker is the movie Leto really needed to showcase his talents and begin developing a multi-movie character arc, but Phoenix was handed the role instead. The whole thing smacks of terrible planning. Like the unfortunate Arthur Fleck himself in Phillips\u2019s film, it seems Leto never really had a chance.", "description": "The actor\u2019s Suicide Squad character had been sidelined long before Todd Phillips\u2019s film starring Joaquin Phoenix as Batman\u2019s arch enemy was greenlit", "authors": ["Ben Child"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4eea3f7b5f6df1b96099e5e923ad1c8ae784aa0/128_0_1922_1153/master/1922.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=aeb0daac162401e30033a54b3d2219b0", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
