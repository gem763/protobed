This one is trying to trick people into giving up their personal information with a fake iPhone 11 competition where the recipient appears to have won a device.

The entire industry needs to put in place a solution otherwise those telcos, without safeguards in place, will be a magnet for fraudsters,\" the minister said in a media release.\n\n\"Criminals will continue to look for new ways to rip off Australians using the telephone system. That is why tackling telecommunications scams is a priority for the Morrison Government.\"\n\nOne way to do this was by using two-factor authentication to verify the user's identity when requests are made to port mobile numbers. The media release confirmed while major telcos such as Telstra, Optus and Vodafone had already enabled this method, other telcos representing more than one million mobile services around Australia had yet to implement the same.\n\nPorting scams occur when a hacker manages to take control of a user's phone number without their authorisation. This means they can assume your identity.\n\nACCC's Scamwatch says if you notice your phone is showing 'SOS only' where the reception bars usually appear, that could be cause for porting concerns. It recommends choosing difficult passwords and PINs to guess and updating them regularly, deleting any suspicious text messages or emails, avoiding software that auto-completes online forms as well as using security software to conduct virus scans.\n\nBut if you think you've already been scammed, you can report it to Scamwatch.", "description": "The Morrison Government has announced it's planning to further regulate telco providers to make sure they're protecting their customers against porting scams....", "authors": ["Tegan Jones", "Bradley Brownell"], "top_image": "https://edge.alluremedia.com.au/m/g/2019/10/mobilecharging.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
