Google is also changing the colour of the logo from green to black to make it easier for visually impaired people to see it.\n\nBehind the scenes, Google has beefed up the security of Android in order to combat the growing scourge of cyber attacks and scam apps proliferating on the platform.\n\nThere are more than 2.5 billion devices around the world that use Android, meaning any lapse in security can have profound consequences for its users.\n\nA recent report published last month revealed that malicious apps on Google Play had been downloaded more than 8 million times by Android users.\n\n\"Android devices already get regular security updates,\" Google wrote in a lengthy blog post introducing Android 10.\n\n\"In Android 10, you'll get them even faster and easier. With Google Play system updates, important Security and Privacy fixes can now be sent directly to your phone from Google Play, just the same way all your other apps update. So you get these fixes as soon as they are available.\"\n\nAs part of the new update Google also introduced dark mode - a highly-anticipated feature among Android users in recent years.\n\nThe new Dark theme is designed to \"take it easy on your eyes\" when using a smartphone in low-light conditions. Google claims it will also help prolong a device's battery life.\n\nOther new features in a sound amplifier to boost sound and filter out background noise, as well as gesture navigation to move between apps using swipes.\n\nThis last feature means the back button, which has been a staple of Android operating systems in recent years, has now been removed.\n\nInstead users will need to learn how to \"get around with a swipe and a pull\". Google claims this new system is designed to be quicker and more intuitive, though it is already proving controversial among Android users.\n\nFinally, Android 10 comes with support for folding phones, meaning its interface can seamlessly transition between different screen shapes.\n\nBoth Samsung and Huawei plan to release folding smartphones later this year in the form of the Galaxy Fold and the Mate X, though their launch has been delayed due to issues with the mechanism.\n\nTheir delayed launch means they could come already shipped with the new operating system.", "description": "Google has released Android 10, the latest version of its hugely popular mobile operating system.
