He lived up to his name and he is a great fighter.\n\n\u201cI knew I could beat him with the jab alone, but he had me himself so respect to him.\u201d\n\nIn tartan shorts, Taylor overcame a swollen right eye and a cut above it late on to come through on a majority decision.\n\nHis strong jab troubled Prograis throughout and although the New Orleans boxer gave as good as he got, the Scot had too much in the end, landing big blows in rounds six and seven.\n\nJosh Taylor celebrates winning the super-lightweight unification (Paul Harding/PA)\n\nWhile Taylor\u2019s record now reads 16 fights, 16 wins, the American no longer has a zero in the loss column with this his first defeat in 25 bouts.\n\nPrograis added: \u201cThe better man won on the night. No excuses, but I will be back. I am pretty sure Josh enjoyed it, hopefully we can do part two.\u201d\n\nDerek Chisora delighted the home crowd earlier in the evening with a fourth-round victory over David Price to win the WBO Inter-Continental heavyweight belt.\n\nFighting on the undercard of the Taylor-Prograis fight, Finchley resident Chisora dominated from the first bell and almost finished the Liverpudlian at the end of the third.\n\nPrice was saved by the bell, but he was dropped in the fourth by a body shot and his corner made the decision to throw in the towel not long after.\n\nChisora, 35, told Sky Sports: \u201cI am an old boy in this game. I came to destroy. I knew if I caught him, he was gone.\u201d\n\nMerseyside fighter Price struggled to land blows on his opponent and in the third the bout almost came to an end.\n\nThe Olympic bronze medallist was caught by several combinations and, despite a brief response, it was the bell at the end of the third which saved him.\n\nA chat with his corner was not enough time for the heavyweight veteran to regroup and he dropped to the canvas after a body shot midway through the fourth.\n\nDereck Chisora celebrates winning the inter-continental heavyweight championship (Paul Harding/PA)\n\nDespite attempting to continue, his team had seen enough and Chisora could celebrate the 32nd win of his career.\n\nHe paid tribute to his rival and close friend afterwards, adding: \u201cDavid Price stepped up to save the show so shout out to David Price, his family and his team.\u201d\n\nJoseph Parker was Chisora\u2019s original scheduled opponent before the New Zealander pulled out due to illness.\n\n\u201cIf we can get Joseph Parker as soon as possible \u2013 I hope he doesn\u2019t get a spider bite \u2013 let\u2019s do it as soon as possible,\u201d Chisora added.\n\nBut Chisora\u2019s manager David Haye added: \u201cI like the Oleksandr Usyk fight. That would be a fantastic fight.\u201d\n\nHe promised a WAR, and that is exactly what he brought!
