The sheriff said the fire spread rapidly and flames blocked both exits out of the lower deck, where passengers and one crew member were sleeping in tight quarters.\n\nThe captain and four crew members awake on the upper decks jumped off the front of the vessel, swam to an inflatable boat at the back and steered it to a ship anchored nearby. Authorities have interviewed them but haven\u2019t said what efforts they made to help the 34 people trapped aboard before abandoning ship. The crew member presumed dead was asleep below deck with the passengers, Mr Brown said.\n\nIt appears the crew sent multiple mayday calls, including one from the Conception in which a crew member could be heard saying he couldn\u2019t breathe.\n\nTwenty bodies have been pulled from the sunken vessel that had been anchored close to the shore of Santa Cruz Island, about 20 miles (32 kilometres) off the coast and northwest of Los Angeles. Four to six other bodies have been spotted underwater, and divers are looking for the remaining people who are missing.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report", "description": "Three sisters who were helping celebrate their father's birthday are thought to be among the 34 people killed when a diving boat caught fire off the coast of\u00a0Southern California.
