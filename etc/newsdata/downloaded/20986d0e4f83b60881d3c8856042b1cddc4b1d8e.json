Jordan argued strongly that Ofcom did not have the authority to step in and examine the case and refused to cooperate with the external investigation.\n\nHe told the media regulator there \u201cis no proper basis for Ofcom\u2019s proposed action\u201d due to the agreement that governs which BBC complaints can be assessed by the external regulator. Jordan said Hall had already reversed the decision and the Munchetty row neither counted as exceptional circumstances nor an incident where Ofcom had the power to launch an investigation of its own accord.\n\n\u201cI am disappointed, therefore, that Ofcom is assessing a broadcast with a view potentially to undertaking an investigation for which it has no clear jurisdiction, rather than handling complaints it has received about the programme in the normal way,\u201d he said.\n\nThe public broadcaster has guarded the independence of its in-house complaints process, usually only allowing Ofcom to step in when viewers are unsatisfied with the original BBC ruling. In this case, the viewer is believed to have been satisfied with the original ruling against Munchetty, casting doubt on whether the media regulator had the authority to step in under the existing arrangements.\n\nIn its own assessment of the exchange between Walker and Munchetty, the media regulator concluded it had not broken Ofcom\u2019s broadcasting code rules on due impartiality.\n\nOfcom said the discussion about Trump was compatible with its rules because it was in the context of a chat between two hosts on the BBC Breakfast sofa. They said viewers understood the difference in tone between traditional news bulletins and the magazine-style programme, which \u201chas over many years featured informal exchanges between the presenters on news items\u201d.\n\nIt concluded: \u201cThis style of analysis can be engaging for viewers and can enhance public understanding of the news. Audiences are familiar with this format and, in our view, it would have shaped their expectations of the presenters and programme in this case.\u201d\n\nOfcom\u2019s Kevin Bakhurst, himself a former senior BBC News executive, said the case raised concerns about whether the public broadcaster\u2019s complaints process could still command the confidence of the public, not least because it could not explain on what basis \u2013 other than public outrage \u2013 the director general had overturned the original decision.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be requiring the BBC to be more transparent about its processes and compliance findings as a matter of urgency,\u201d he said.\n\nA BBC spokesman said: \u201cWe note Ofcom\u2019s finding and the fact they agree with the director general\u2019s decision.\u201d", "description": "Regulator says it has \u2018serious concerns\u2019 around transparency of BBC\u2019s complaints process", "authors": ["Jim Waterson", "Afua Hirsch", "Lenny Henry", "Adrian Lester", "Krishnan Guru-Murthy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/704714cd49500fb607f34f8116659064408da32a/290_164_4067_2441/master/4067.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a587256279bc8c478de7eb197107b161", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
