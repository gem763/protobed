However, three teams \u2014 Michigan State, Maryland and USC \u2014 dropped out of the rankings after losing to unranked opponents over the weekend.\n\nRanked No. 18 last week, Michigan State had the biggest fall after a miserable offensive performance in a 10-7 loss to Arizona State. Meanwhile, the Sun Devils made their debut in the AP poll this week at No. 24 following the win.\n\nMaryland was ranked No. 21 thanks to an impressive 63-20 win over previously ranked Syracuse. But the Terps\u2019 stay in the rankings did not last long thanks to a 20-17 road loss to Temple.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nUSC, No. 24 last week, returned to an unranked status after losing on the road to BYU in overtime.\n\nArizona State is now ranked after upsetting Michigan State in East Lansing.
