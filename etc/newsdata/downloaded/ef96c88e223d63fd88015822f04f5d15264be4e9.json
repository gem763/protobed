So, it's no surprise that his hometown of New York provides an endless source of creative and personal inspiration.\n\n\"I love people and I love just seeing out on the street a gesture, a flash of color, the way someone's leaning against a bus stop or an umbrella opening and passing by you,\" he said. \"Just these little daily life moments that happen in New York, that somehow I just am forever intoxicated by.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 / 16 The Archbishop of Newark, pictured in the center.
