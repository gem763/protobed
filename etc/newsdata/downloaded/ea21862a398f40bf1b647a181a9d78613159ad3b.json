They were in a high-level coordination with American intelligence.\u201d\n\nAhmed said the chaos of the initial Turkish invasion did not stop Kurdish spies in the anti-terrorism unit of the Syrian Democratic Forces from continuing to gather and analyze information gleaned about Baghdadi\u2019s location. The New York Times reported that the initial tip about al-Baghdadi\u2019s location came in the summer, following the arrest of one of his couriers and one of his wives.", "description": "", "authors": ["Eli Lake", "Finance.Yahoo.Com News"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
