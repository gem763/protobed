China still faces new U.S. tariffs set to kick in on Dec. 15, on top of the existing 25% tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports.\n\nThat is likely to weigh on businesses and consumers.\n\nChina's gross domestic product growth slowed more than expected to 6.0% year-on-year in the third quarter, its weakest pace in almost three decades.\n\nFor the whole of 2019, GDP growth is expected to cool to 6.2% and then hit 5.9% in 2020, according to a Reuters poll, underlining the growing challenges faced by Beijing in its efforts to stabilise the economy.\n\nIn September, a slide in China's exports picked up pace while imports contracted for a fifth straight month, official data showed.\n\nProfits at China's industrial firms fell in September for the second consecutive month as the cooling economy and trade war weighed on corporate balance sheets.\n\nFor January-September, industrial firms earned profits of 4.59 trillion yuan, down 2.1% from a year earlier, and worse than the 1.7% reading in the first eight months.\n\nChina unexpectedly kept unchanged its new benchmark lending rate in October after reductions in August and September, suggesting Beijing is keen to avoid overly loosening monetary policy for fear it may push up already-high debt levels across the economy.\n\nThe government has been trying to spur domestic demand for over a year through higher infrastructure spending, but the measures have been slow to gain traction.\n\nA private survey - the Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI)- which focuses more on small- and medium-sized, export-driven Chinese firms, is expected to show factory activity expanded in October.\n\nHowever, it is still forecast to show subdued growth with the headline gauge edging lower to 51.0 from 51.4 in September.\n\nThe official PMI and its sister survey on the services sector will be released on Thursday.\n\nThe Caixin manufacturing PMI will be published on Friday and the Caixin services PMI survey will be out on Nov. 5.", "description": "China's factory activity seen contracting for sixth month on trade pressure: Reuters poll", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9S0BR-OCATP_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
