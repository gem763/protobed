The popular character will depart later in the year following the star\u2019s decision to say goodbye.\n\nAt the moment, the character is engaged to Liam Cavanagh (Jonny MacPherson) and the couple have been seen competing with Sam Dingle (James Hooton) and Lydia Hart (Karen Blick) for a wedding competition.\n\nThe pair took a while to get together and Bernice almost blew it when she suspected that her doctor boyfriend was a killer. But she won him round with a Wild West event and a proposal in scenes which prove that Emmerdale is certainly going to lose a lot of sparkle when she departs.\n\nIt has not been confirmed whether Bernice will get a happy ending with Liam or whether they will have a split in store but Kate Brooks recently confirmed that there would be an emotional rollercoaster for the popular villager.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSamantha took to Twitter to share the news that she had finished with the show, saying: \u2018Yesterday was my last filming day on Emmerdale. I shall miss the laughs and have made some great friends. But sometimes it\u2019s good to leave the party when you\u2019re having a good time\u2026..\u2019\n\nYesterday was my last filming day on Emmerdale.
