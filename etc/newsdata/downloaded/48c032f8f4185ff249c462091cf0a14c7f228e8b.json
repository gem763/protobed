The thing about Sophie, Maisie, Issac and me is that we were together for so long,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Richard [Madden] was definitely in that too. We became like actual siblings, we would literally fight each other. We have a very sibling relationship.\u2019\n\nKit appeared at Comic Con (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nFans are still coming to terms with the fact the show isn\u2019t making a return in its current form (we\u2019ve got a prequel coming up, so we\u2019ve got something to get keen about), and also they still feel a little robbed by a supposed lacklustre ending.\n\nGame Of Thrones came to a controversial end in May this year, sparking fan petitions which called for the show\u2019s final episodes to be remade.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nEven last week poor Sophie got a taste of her own trolling medicine when she became subject to GOT ribbing while attending an NFL match after showing her allegiance to the Chicago Bears.\n\nThe 23-year-old actress turned up for the NFL match on 6 October in London which saw the Chicago Bears face the Oakland Raiders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe made her presence known by posting a video on the Chicago Bears social channels, saying: \u2018To all the Bears fans, I\u2019m here, I\u2019m repping you, shout-out Chicago Bears.\u2019\n\nUnfortunately for Sophie, the Bears lost out to the Oakland Raiders 24-21, which prompted some casual shade from the winning team\u2019s social channels.\n\nSharing Sophie\u2019s video, the Raiders tweeted: \u2018That game had a better finish than Thrones.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
