Their names \u2014 and, if applicable, party affiliation \u2014 are listed on the physical ballot you'll receive from the poll clerk.\n\nUnlike many other countries, Canada allows for same-day voter registration. That means if you aren't yet registered to vote, you can also do that today at your assigned polling station.\n\nIn some recent provincial elections, electors have been able to cast a ballot at any polling station in the province. The same rules do not apply in a federal election. On election day, you can only vote at your assigned polling station, which is typically housed in a nearby school, place of worship or community building.\n\nAll electors need to have some form of identification \u2014 proof of both identity and address \u2014 to present when they go to vote. The easiest option is a driver's licence. You can also bring your VIC and a recent utility bill. A Canadian passport and bank statement will also suffice.\n\nClick here for a full list of ID options that Elections Canada clerks will accept.\n\nVoting hours vary across the country\n\nA voter walks into a polling station during advance polls on Oct. 11 in St-Georges Que. (Jacques Boissinot/Canadian Press)\n\nHere are the voting hours for each time zone. All times are local.\n\nNewfoundland \u2014 8:30 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.\n\nAtlantic \u2014 8:30 a.m. \u2013 8:30 p.m.\n\nEastern \u2014 9:30 a.m. \u2013 9:30 p.m.\n\nCentral \u2014 8:30 a.m. \u2013 8:30 p.m.\n\nMountain \u2014 7:30 a.m. \u2013 7:30 p.m.\n\nPacific \u2014 7:00 a.m. \u2013 7:00 p.m.\n\nThis means polls in Newfoundland and Labrador will close at 7 p.m. ET \u2014 and all polls will be closed by 10 p.m. ET.\n\n(There are no longer results blackout rules in Canada, so first results for areas where polls are closed will be available starting shortly after 7 p.m. ET.)\n\nBy law, all eligible voters must have at least three consecutive hours to cast their vote on election day.\n\nIf your hours of work do not allow for that, your employer must give you time off. You may be able to shift later or leave work early; it is up to your employer to decide when you should take this time off to vote.\n\nIn the highly unlikely event that your local polling station has changed, Elections Canada will tell local news media, who will pass the message on to you through social media and news broadcasts.\n\nStaff will also be on hand at the old polling station to direct electors to the new location.\n\nBe wary of texts and calls\n\nThe agency said electors should be wary of any calls, emails or texts telling you that your polling station has moved.\n\n\"Elections Canada does not call, email or text electors about where to vote or about moving a polling station,\" the agency said.\n\n\"It is very rare that we would move a polling station after we've sent the voter information cards. We move polling stations only in exceptional situations \u2014 for example, if there is a fire at the original polling station.\"\n\nBecause of weather-related issues, some electors in Manitoba will be able to vote by special ballot.\n\nAs a reminder, electors are forbidden from filming or taking pictures inside the voting place.\n\nYou cannot show, film or take a picture of a marked ballot \u2014 it is illegal because it violates the secrecy of the vote under the Canada Elections Act.\n\nAnd, of course, you can only vote once.", "description": "After a 40-day campaign, millions of Canadians will cast ballots today in the country's 43rd general election.", "authors": ["Parliamentary Bureau", "John Paul", "J.P.", "Tasker Is A Reporter In The Cbc'S Parliamentary Bureau In Ottawa.
