Today\u2019s first major update to World of Warcraft Classic adds the three-part Dire Maul dungeon, filed with Ogres, elves and assorted evil.\n\nDire Maul was an epic undertaking back in the day, crafted as a challenge for players from level 55 right on up to the original level 60 cap. While the East Wing of the dungeon was open to all, Dire Maul West and North required keys, lockpicks, or explosives to explore. This is the dungeon where players would journey to earn class-based trinkets with special stat enhancements or to procure the mystical Orb of Deception, a magical item capable of transforming players into members of the opposite faction.\n\nAnd now it\u2019s all of those things once more in World of Warcraft Classic. Along with all of that old dire content, today\u2019s update also adds quests for epic Paladin and Warlock mounts, so expect players of those two classes to be even more insufferable for a bit.\n\nBest of all, the addition of Dire Maul to World of Warcraft Classic means the Alliance side can stop arguing about whether \u201cDM\u201d means Deadmines or Dire Maul in Westfall general chat. Or perhaps the arguing will only get stronger. We\u2019ll see.", "description": "Now that players have had a month and a half to get used to World of Warcraft as it was in late 2004, it\u2019s time to scootch forward to early 2005.
