I promise we will do all we can to prevent them in the future.\"", "description": "Scotland Yard has been accused of \"institutional stupidity\" as the long awaited report into its handling of the VIP paedophile scandal identifies a catalogue of catastrophic failings by the Force.", "authors": ["Martin Evans", "Crime Correspondent", "Janet Daley", "Juliet Samuel", "Michael Deacon", "Sarah Champion"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/10/04/ss-composite-image-2019-10-4-10-25-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqVzuuqpFlyLIwiB6NTmJwfSVWeZ_vEN7c6bHu2jJnT8.png?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
