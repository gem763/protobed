The drone isn\u2019t flying.\n\n\u201cSo we just have to improvise with plan B. Holding the drone at head height. Not drone flying, but drone holding.\u201d\n\nThe group blamed the authorities for jamming the signal between the control panel and the drone.\n\n\u201cThe police will be happy with this, the passengers will be happy,\u201d the voice on the video is heard saying. \u201cWe unfortunately are not so happy.\u201d\n\nThe first touchdown of the day, at 4.36am, was Qantas flight 9 from Perth in Western Australia.\n\nThe first departure, TAP Portugal to Lisbon, departed as normal shortly after 6am.\n\nOn Thursday, seven members of the group \u2013 five men and two women \u2013 were arrested by the Metropolitan Police \u201con suspicion of conspiracy to commit a public nuisance in relation to operations at Heathrow airport on Friday 13 September\u201d.\n\nThey included Roger Hallam, co-founder of Extinction Rebellion.\n\nAfter the arrests, the activists said: \u201cThe Heathrow Pause action will carry on exactly as planned, peacefully and non-violently, regardless of today\u2019s events.\u201d\n\nThe group said it will continue with the plan later on Friday and over the weekend.\n\nA spokesperson for the airport said: \u201cHeathrow\u2019s runways and taxiways remain open and fully operational despite attempts to disrupt the airport through the illegal use of drones in protest nearby.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work with the authorities to carry out dynamic risk assessment programmes and keep our passengers flying safely on their journeys today.\u201d\n\nThe Met imposed a \u201cdispersal order\u201d across a wide area around Heathrow from 4.30am on Friday.
