Very New York.\n\nOne of the rooms inside The Curtain, a six-storey brick hotel in London's trendy Shoreditch area\n\nThe reception area is dark and moody, with a long green sofa and lots of bare brick. We\u2019ve booked the lowest category of room for a whopping \u00a3263.\n\n\u2018That seems a lot,\u2019 says my wife as we make for the fourth floor. Within seconds of walking into the poky slit of a room, it becomes clear it\u2019s an excessive price.\n\nI call reception and tell a young woman from Hungary that there must be some mistake \u2014 \u00a3163 perhaps, but not \u00a3263. She says she\u2019ll come and show us another option for the same price, but that it\u2019s a wheelchair access room.\n\nProblem is she doesn\u2019t appear for 15 minutes because she\u2019s the only one on the front desk. At these prices, you might expect someone to show you to your room in the first place, or offer to help with your bag.\n\nThe Lounge in The Curtain. The Inspector booked the lowest category of room for a 'whopping' \u00a3263\n\nWe agree to move down the corridor. It\u2019s an improvement \u2014 we can see some sky through a window that opens \u2014 but it\u2019s dreary, and hastens our visit to the rooftop bar, where there\u2019s a small outdoor pool and the Lido restaurant serving Mediterranean staples.\n\nEvery single person is taking selfies, and the sleepy waitress seems strangely disengaged for what\u2019s meant to be such a hip hang-out. So we make for the basement and Red Rooster, an outpost of the Harlem restaurant which counts Barack Obama as a fan. There\u2019s live music, a slinky bar and a merry crowd.\n\nAfter the disappointing Southern Heritage starter, with not enough burrata, too much peach and barely ripe tomatoes, we share one of the signature dishes: Obama short-ribs with ricotta gnocchi and succotash.\n\n\u2018You\u2019ll love it,\u2019 says a perky waiter. We don\u2019t. There\u2019s lots of it, but not much to it. We should have had the burger.\n\nBreakfast is served in the Lido, where there\u2019s a hearty buffet, but we are charged extra for an espresso. Which seems mean and not at all cool.", "description": "The Curtain is a six-storey brick building wedged between office blocks and opposite a 24/7 car wash in London's Shoreditch area.
