A bright blue banner with the simple message \u201cGoodbye\u201d, his statement exploded across social media, largely because of its content but also because of his choice in font.\n\n\u201cWhat was supposed to be a place for fans to connect with each other has turned into a place that is everything I detest and can\u2019t or won\u2019t condone,\u201d he wrote.\n\ntruly lmfao r.i.p. the jeremy renner app pic.twitter.com/VWFx201ZNb \u2014 karen han (@karenyhan) September 4, 2019\n\nSo what happened to Renner\u2019s beautiful app to turn it into a Frankenstein\u2019s monster of trolling and dick jokes? The answer, if you are over the age of thirty, probably won\u2019t shock you.\n\nA lot of the chaos came from a function on the app discovered by writer Stefen Heck. Heck discovered that all push notifications from the app appeared on your phone as if they had been sent my Jeremy Renner himself.\n\n\u201cWhat this means,\u201d writes Heck, \u201cas you\u2019ve probably figured out by now, is that if you post \u201cLookin\u2019 good, Mr. Renner!\u201d under a blurry video of Jeremy driving a dump truck and someone named football_jersey97 replies with \u201cThere is diarrhea shooting out of my penis,\u201d your phone will buzz and you will receive a notification with the words \u201cJeremy Renner: There is diarrhea shooting out of my penis\u201d next to a little picture of Jeremy Renner\u2019s face.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all wonderful stuff.\n\nHeck\u2019s realisation first came on Twitter and it is there where his now-viral discovery lead others to try their hand at manipulating Jeremy Renner\u2019s secret garden. In a story of obviously-that-would-happen-on-the-internet, the Official Jeremy Renner app was run over with people posting under screennames like \u201cJeremy Epstein\u201d and \u201cCasey Anthony\u201d, trolling white power hashtags, and messages in comment threads that were more fitted to science fiction forums.\n\nEven those who found themselves blocked by the app\u2019s administrators were able to reach out one final time through the app\u2019s iTunes reviews.\n\nlmao they actually let my review of the jeremy renner app go up pic.twitter.com/6iKZ3fUx1P \u2014 josh sorensen ????\ufe0f\u200d???? (@namebrandjosh) September 3, 2019\n\nIt is safe to say that, while owning an official app in the first place is a weird move from someone with the cultural footprint of Jeremy Renner, this is not why he created his app.\n\nBefore the chaos, Rennerds (the name of his fandom which I have just made up) came together in a combined enjoyment of Renner\u2019s extremely 21 Pilots-esque debut album and a love of all things Renner. What\u2019s not to love? Dude\u2019s like 50 and had a mohawk. He\u2019s Hawkeye. He\u2019s Hurt Locker. He\u2019s other things too, I\u2019m sure. Now those Rennerds have been left to wander the internet, lost and aimless, desperate to find solace in some other community drawn together by their love of all things Jeremy Renner.\n\nI for one am excited for one happens next.", "description": "", "authors": ["Brad Esposito"], "top_image": "https://www.pedestrian.tv/content/uploads/2019/09/ththth.jpg"}
