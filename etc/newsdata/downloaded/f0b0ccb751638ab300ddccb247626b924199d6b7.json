Not just us (officials0 but the fans will travel a lot. We will pollute a lot because of that. We will think about it,\u201d he told a news conference after UEFA\u2019s executive committee met in the Slovenian capital.\n\n\u201cWe are thinking about doing more for the environment anyway, we have a children\u2019s foundation and do a lot for children around the world... but we didn\u2019t do much about the environment,\u201d said Ceferin, who has been UEFA chief since 2016.\n\n\u201cWe start to think about it now because you can\u2019t protect children if there is no environment for them to live in.\u201d\n\nUEFA will plant 50,000 trees in each of the 12 host countries for the Euro 2020 tournament which will conclude with the semi-finals and final at Wembley Stadium in London.\n\nThe decision to hold a pan-European tournament was taken before Ceferin came to power at UEFA and he said it was unlikely to be repeated.\n\n\u201cNot just because of the environmental reasons but also it is very challenging for us to organdie an event like that, we have different legislation, we have (a) visa and non-visa system, we have European Union and non-European Union, we have Brexit which we don\u2019t know if (the UK) is non-European Union or not,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt is quite challenging and I don\u2019t think we should organdie such a big event. It is symbolically very nice, pan-European, East, West, North, South, it is the 60th anniversary but to do it every time I would say it is too challenging.\u201d", "description": "European football's governing body UEFA said it will plant 600,000 trees across 12 countries as part of its commitment to offset carbon emissions from travel to next year's expanded European Championships but conceded it may have to do more.", "authors": ["Simon Evans", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
