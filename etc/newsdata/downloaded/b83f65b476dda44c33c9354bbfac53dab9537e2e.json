Trump supporters gathered outside of the event\u2019s venue to express their support for the president. Videos show supporters shouting \u201cTrump\u201d and holding American flags, Trump-Pence 2020 banners, and homemade signs reading, \u201cImpeach Pelosi\u201d:\n\nNancy Pelosi visits South Carolina for an event.

This is a very sad time for our country. This is a very somber time for our country,\u201d she said, calling the emergence of the Trump-Zelensky phone call an \u201cexplosion.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeptember 17 of this year, that very day, was the day that this explosion occurred and we found out about the telephone conversation, which is completely in defiance of the Constitution of the United States,\u201d Pelosi claimed.\n\n\u201cSome people say, \u2018Why are you doing this, he\u2019s not worth it to divide the country this way,'\u201d she continued. \u201cHe might not be, but our Constitution is worth it, and our democracy is worth it.\u201d\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) admitted on Thursday that the House may proceed with impeachment before fleshing out the facts.\n\nAt the same time, (the White House has) apparently every incentive to try to make it drag on forever. And there may very well come a point where we have to make the decision that the effort to obstruct has become such an impediment that we have reached a decision point \u2014 even in the absence of being able to fully follow and flesh out the facts surrounding the president\u2019s Ukraine conduct.\n\nHouse Democrats have yet to hold a full House vote on the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe Pelosi protest follows a similar effort by Trump supporters in Nevada this week, who surrounded Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) at the Reno-Tahoe International Airport and demanded her to \u201cstop the impeachment\u201d of President Trump:", "description": "Trump supporters in South Carolina sent a clear message to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) on Friday evening.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/GettyImages-1171347837-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
