I thought I was going to be fired but it was the opposite and people called in saying much it impacted them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt taught me about the power of vulnerability and being honest \u2014 people will respect that. I think vulnerability does show strength \u2026 there is no weakness in that.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: ESPN Founder Bill Rasmussen Advanced the Ball on Covering All Sports-Except One\n\nThat strength in sharing our weaknesses was a theme throughout the summit, especially on Monday\u2019s \u201cWorld Class Athlete Panel\u201d with international sports stars Becky Lynch, Katrin Tanja Davidsdottir, Liz Cambage and Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce.\n\n\u201cWhen first I started playing basketball, I couldn\u2019t put one foot in front of another, I was so uncoordinated,\u201d WNBA single-game scoring record-holder Cambage said. Along with getting over having two left feet, the Australian national team player said she has been \u201cstruggling with depression and anxiety since I was a teenager. I got into a vicious cycle of drinking and smoking.\u201d Hitting rockbottom in 2016 and landing on a 24-hour suicide watch was \u201cmy big wake up that I really needed to change where I was in life,\u201d Cambage said. \u201cEveryone has a different story and we all need to support each other.\u201d\n\nIrish-born wrestler Becky Lynch, who is the only woman to hold the WWE Raw and SmackDown Women\u2019s Championships concurrently, admitted that she failed Phys Ed. when she was 13. \u201cI thought they passed everyone just by showing up! I stood there afterwards with my field hockey stick in my hand and had a hard talk with myself,\u201d Lynch said. That teenage reflection prompted her to join a wrestling school, which led to contracts in Canada and Japan. \u201cThen my visa ran out and I had to move home to Ireland and live with my ma,\u201d Lynch admitted.\n\nSubsequent jobs included working as a personal trainer in Orlando, Florida and as a flight attendant (\u201cwhich believe it or not, is not really like being a wrestler\u201d), acting class and stunt work, before she finally got the confidence back to go for a WWE tryout. \u201cThen everything came into place and all that passion came back,\u201d Lynch said.\n\nAlso Read: ESPN to Launch Daily Sports Show on Quibi in 2020\n\nFrom the fight for equal pay to diversity and inclusion, here are some of the top thought-provoking and conversation-sparking quotes from the 2019 espnW Summit.\n\nStory continues", "description": "The world\u2019s top female athletes, leaders in sports media and industry figures gathered this week for three empowering and inspirational days packed with impactful conversations that went way beyond their love of sports.From pro athletes overcoming depression and suicidal thoughts to the peril of having", "authors": ["Debbie Emery"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uhCR9rCbyGMd7lCAWswiJA--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MTg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thewrap.com/69d8c660b25f405b8082fb301139d19c", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
