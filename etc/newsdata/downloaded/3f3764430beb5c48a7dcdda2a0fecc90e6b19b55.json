Now he\u2019s training for next year\u2019s Olympics without a guarantee he can compete.\n\nMollaei was the defending world champion, and Israel\u2019s Sagi Muki his biggest rival for the gold medal. There was one problem \u2014 Iran has a policy of boycotting all competitions against Israelis, even if that means an athlete\u2019s training was all for nothing.\n\nMollaei told The Associated Press he was ordered to lose a preliminary bout against a Russian in order to cover up the reason for his withdrawal. When he refused and won, he received more intimidating calls from senior officials. \u201cFor once, I decided to live as a free man for myself, and prove to the world that I am a brave man,\u201d Mollaei said in a recent interview in Germany, where he\u2019s living in an undisclosed location.\n\n\u201cI did this for my human soul. For myself. I wanted to practice and compete with freedom, with peace of mind,\u201d said Mollaei, speaking in Persian. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to worry about whom to compete with and whom not to compete with. I\u2019ll compete with anyone, to honor the Olympic charter.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Mollaei lost a bronze-medal bout and didn\u2019t face Muki, who won gold. The International Judo Federation, which is supporting Mollaei, said he received demands to withdraw from an Iranian deputy sports minister, embassy staff and the head of the Iranian Olympic Committee.\n\nMollaei\u2019s likeliest route to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics is now the International Olympic Committee\u2019s team for refugees. The IJF is helping him but said he will need refugee status from the United Nations.\n\nIn this photo taken Sept. 12, 2019, Iranian judoka Saeid Mollaei poses for a portrait photo at an undisclosed southern city of Germany. Mollaei has been in hiding since he left the Iranian judo team last month, saying he had been ordered to withdraw from the world championships on political grounds. Michael Probst\u2014AP\n\nSo far, adapting to life in Germany is hard. \u201cEven the clothes you can see on me (are gifts). I had nothing when arrived in Germany. I just decided to come and I came,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a lot of gifts from friends and this is how I live now, with the help of a few friends and the IJF. I\u2019m still waiting to see what will happen later, how I can compete, but obviously from the very beginning of my arrival here in Germany I started my training. Where and how I will compete later, I don\u2019t know yet.\u201d\n\nMollaei said he has not asked for asylum in Germany. Instead, he is living on a visa issued when he competed in German club events, and is cautious about security.\n\nPowerfully built, with broad shoulders, Mollaei speaks softly and chooses his words carefully. \u201cEven when I want to contact my family I do it through a friend in Tehran because my family is under surveillance and I can\u2019t talk about many issues,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have much contact with any of my friends.\u201d\n\nMollaei told the AP he had been given similar orders to avoid Israeli competitors on three previous occasions. The last time was in February, when he failed to appear for the medal ceremony at a competition in France because it would mean sharing the podium with Muki. \u201cAlmost all Iranian athletes have received such orders when it is linked to Israeli athletes,\u201d he said.\n\nIranian officials have said Mollaei was somehow manipulated into leaving the team, and that he would be welcomed if he returned home. He is skeptical, pointing to an Iranian letter to the IJF in May pledging to comply with Olympic non-discrimination rules. At the time, it was hailed as a signal Iran would end its sports boycott of Israel. \u201cI can assure you that they didn\u2019t comply with the Olympic Charter. So how can we trust them?\u201d Mollaei said of Iran\u2019s sports officials.\n\nMollaei\u2019s break with the Iranian authorities comes at a time when activists are using sports to defy government demands.\n\nFemale Iranian activists have campaigned for years to be allowed to attend sports stadiums, particularly for men\u2019s soccer games, and staged protests at last year\u2019s World Cup in Russia. Last week, Iranian news outlets reported 29-year-old soccer fan Sahar Khodayari had died after setting herself on fire upon learning she could spend six months in prison for trying to sneak into a game.\n\nMollaei expressed sympathy for Khodayari and other female campaigners. \u201cI wondered why this happened, why Iranian women can\u2019t freely live like other girls, and enjoy sports and enjoy watching sports,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, and why such difficulties should only happen to Iranians and the Iranian sport community.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. I\u2019m just sad and disappointed. I just hope that one day the girls and athletes in my country can live freely and can enjoy life.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "Saeid Mollaei has been in hiding since he left the Iranian judo team last month, saying he was ordered to withdraw from world championships", "authors": ["James Ellingworth"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/saeid-mollaei-iran-judo-hiding.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
