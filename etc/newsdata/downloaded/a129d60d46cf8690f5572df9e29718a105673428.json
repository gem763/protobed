Kelvin McKay via REUTERS.\n\nThe nurse at the federal government-run clinic, the only source of emergency care in this remote indigenous community, told the officers the 37-year-old could sober up in jail, according to testimony at a 2018 inquest. Minutes after leaving the clinic, the police sped back. Matawapit had no pulse and could not be revived.\n\nAt the inquest, the nurse testified that in sending Matawapit on to jail, she had been following a standard protocol for intoxicated patients in the northern reserves. Government officials testified there was no such thing.\n\nThe coroner found that in the nearly six years between the death and the inquest, there was no evidence of any formal review of the case \u201cor any learning from the events of that evening\u201d akin to typical procedures in hospitals or emergency rooms. Matawapit\u2019s death, attributed to heart disease, likely would have passed under the radar but for the fact that she died in police custody, which made the inquest mandatory.\n\nOver at least nine years, the Canadian federal government has not consistently tracked, let alone investigated, poor outcomes at clinics on indigenous reserves, according to a Reuters analysis of documents, including internal reports and meeting notes obtained through public records requests.\n\nRecord-keeping on deaths and other critical incidents at the clinics, which provide basic and emergency care to about 115,000 people, has been erratic and fragmented, Reuters found. The incidents often are detailed in separate provincial computer systems, when they are tracked or reported at all.\n\nAs a result, there is no way for the federal government to know how often patients die or suffer injury at the clinics or how that compares to the rest of the Canadian health system.\n\nThe federal government\u2019s First Nations and Inuit Health Branch (FNIHB), which funds 79 clinics and manages 50 of them, is hampered in identifying potentially harmful patterns and preventing future mistakes, documents and interviews with medical experts indicate.\n\nWhether turning away apparently intoxicated patients in the northern reserves \u2013 described in the coroner\u2019s verdict as the \u201cnorthern protocol\u201d- has been a widespread practice is difficult to say. Reuters was able to find one other similar death, detailed in Manitoba police records, that occurred five months after Matawapit\u2019s. The federal government enacted a policy saying it was \u201cnot appropriate\u201d to hold intoxicated patients in cells - but only after last year\u2019s inquest brought the issue to light.\n\nReuters\u2019 findings come as the country is in the midst of a public reckoning with the legacy of settler colonization, a hotter issue today than in nations such as the United States and Australia where European settlers also displaced local peoples.\n\nWith an indigenous population that is growing and gaining political clout, Prime Minster Justin Trudeau came to power in 2015 promising \u201creconciliation\u201d with aboriginal people. Reduced to a minority government in this week\u2019s election, he needs the support of other parties to govern and will face pressure from the left to address poverty, poor housing and health problems that are especially acute on remote reserves.\n\nIt will not be an easy task. Even reviewing critical health care incidents could be a challenge because of the multiple jurisdictions and providers involved, said Michael Green, a professor at Queen\u2019s University who was once chief of staff at a small northern hospital that often received patients from clinics in indigenous communities.\n\nBut \u201cwithout review, there\u2019s no opportunity to learn and make the system safer for everybody,\u201d he said.\n\nStaff at FNIHB, part of Indigenous Services Canada, say they strive to provide the best possible care and have been working on a replacement reporting system, slated to roll out next year.\n\nThe effort, which documents show began in 2014, has been planned behind closed doors and has not previously been reported, although pilot programs are running in Manitoba and Alberta.\n\nDocuments reviewed by Reuters indicate the system is designed to provide national case tracking and a consistent process for investigating and following up on cases.\n\nRobin Buckland, executive director of primary healthcare at FNIHB, said the current system is \u201cnot a bad policy\u201d but the agency is working to build an environment in which staff members can learn.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut we want it to be right, and we want to implement it well.\u201d\n\nReuters was not able to reach the nurses involved in treatment described in this story.\n\n\u201cWe truly believe that nurses are working hard to deliver the best health care possible, under difficult work conditions,\u201d said Debi Daviau, president of the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada, which represents permanent staff nurses and other civil servants.\n\n\u2018SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS\u2019\n\nFor years, indigenous communities have complained about poor treatment on remote reserves, which are often hundreds of miles from top-tier or specialized medical services in major cities. Matawapit died in a community more than 300 km (186 miles) from the nearest major highway.\n\nFor a map of reserves see: tmsnrt.rs/32uE3yk\n\nThese federally funded clinics, usually called nursing stations, struggle to retain nurses, often filling gaps with the help of private staffing agencies.\n\nServices there need more government scrutiny, not less, some critics say.\n\n\u201cWe are treating members of the First Nations communities as second-class citizens,\u201d said Emily Hill, a senior staff lawyer with Aboriginal Legal Services, which represented the Matawapit family at the inquest. \u201cThis is a large government health service. You would expect there to be layers of oversight and accountability.\u201d\n\nDocuments reviewed by Reuters show FNIHB staffers have repeatedly called for a modern reporting system for poor or unexpected outcomes.\n\nThe FNIHB started to track critical incidents in 2006. By 2010, however, a federal audit found that \u201cmonitoring and analysis at both the national and regional level is not occurring.\u201d\n\nFour years later, a FNIHB working group said that a common national policy was needed with \u201cclear processes for reporting and tracking\u201d incidents, according to meeting notes reviewed by Reuters.\n\nIn 2016, an internal report by a member of the working group looked at how other public organizations, including federal prisons, reviewed outcomes. Every policy was found to be more \u201crobust\u201d than the one at FNIHB.\n\nThe report, reviewed by Reuters, said that while some patient safety incidents had been recorded in a national database between 2006 and 2014, regions had stopped using it because of the difficulty in collecting data.\n\nFederal policy focused mainly on nurses\u2019 well-being, not patients\u2019, the report said.\n\nThe nurse at the Matawapit inquest illustrated that point, testifying that a debriefing after the patient\u2019s death was geared \u201cmore to how we were feeling as opposed to what we did.\u201d\n\nA SIMILAR DEATH\n\nOn November 28, 2012, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in God\u2019s Lake Narrows, Manitoba, responded to a report that Tracy Okemow, 31, was drinking and threatening suicide. Police found her next to two empty pill bottles labeled \u201cmetformin,\u201d a diabetes drug, according to a police review of the incident seen by Reuters. She agreed to go to the local nursing station.\n\nThe nurses told officers they had consulted with a doctor off the reserve who felt her \u201cconsumption of medication was not of concern and she could be incarcerated until sober,\u201d according to the police report.\n\nOkemow spent the night in jail. A witness later told police that she seemed to be in agony. In the morning, she was flown to a Winnipeg hospital, where she died the next day of metformin toxicity, the report said.\n\nThere was no inquest or federal inquiry. \u201cIn the case of Ms. Okemow, the death occurred outside of a federally operated facility \u2013 therefore FNIHB did not undertake a formal review,\u201d Indigenous Services Canada said in a statement.\n\nOff reserve, healthcare is under provincial jurisdiction.\n\n\u2018THEY BRUSH US OFF\u2019\n\nThe federal government has reviewed some patient deaths, often after they draw media attention. Documents reviewed by Reuters show officials have found serious systemic problems, including nurses who are stretched thin and do not always appreciate the seriousness of patients\u2019 symptoms.\n\nAfter two children died from complications of strep infections in 2014, an internal review looked at a \u201csampling\u201d of young people who had died, and called for better recruitment and retention of nurses, as well as more physician services.\n\nA 2018 review looked at a 15-month-old toddler seen on a Saturday night for a seizure and infections. The nurse on duty did not consult a doctor, and the child died the next day. The report called for better oversight of nurses, as well as changes to shifts and staffing to address fatigue.\n\nFNIHB\u2019s Buckland said the agency is working to improve hiring and retention amid a global shortage of healthcare workers.\n\nIn Manitoba, the family of Tyson McKay is suing the federal government, alleging that the 32-year-old man died of a heart attack 31 hours after visiting a clinic complaining of chest pain in 2015. The suit alleges the nurse did not perform the appropriate tests that could have diagnosed his condition.\n\nIn a court filing, the government said a staffing agency was responsible for ensuring the nurse was qualified. The staffing agency defended its care and referred questions to the government.\n\nKelvin McKay, Tyson\u2019s 41-year-old brother, has been going to the clinics since childhood. He said he sees a pattern.\n\n\u201cNurses come in and out of our community, and they fail to take the time to get to know our people, and they think we come in with fake illnesses. They brush us off. And that\u2019s not how it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d\n\nFor a graphic on clinics on indigenous reserves often distant from major cities, click here\n\n(This story refiles to add dropped word in paragraph nine)", "description": "Ina Matawapit was barely conscious - intoxicated and suffering from a blow to the head - when police drove her to the North Caribou Lake clinic in Ontario, Canada, one summer evening in 2012.", "authors": ["Allison Martell", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191024&t=2&i=1444464022&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9N0R4", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
