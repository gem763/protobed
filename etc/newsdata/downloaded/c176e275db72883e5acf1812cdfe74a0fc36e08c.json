Aside from wrangling over its position on Brexit, Labour has been devising the most radical rethink of business\u2019s role in the economy and society since the 1980s.\n\nRebecca Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, and John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, want big companies to give employees a 10% stake in their business and a seat on their boards. They plan to renationalise rail, water, energy and Royal Mail, increase corporation tax and the minimum wage, and extend workers\u2019 rights. Companies doing business with the government will have bosses\u2019 pay capped and there will be a tax on financial transactions.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty more \u2013 and this should be no surprise. McDonnell and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn have waited decades for a chance to run the country and probably thought it would never come. If they make it to Downing Street, why would the veteran leftwingers tinker at the edges?\n\nThe Confederation of British Industry is taking Labour seriously and will be doing the rounds at Labour\u2019s party conference in Brighton this week, where Long-Bailey, a Corbyn ally, is likely to announce plans to boost infrastructure and manufacturing.\n\nJosh Hardie, the CBI\u2019s deputy director general, said the lobby group held regular meetings with Corbyn and McDonnell, and his members supported ideas such as infrastructure, \u201cengaging\u201d with workers, and investing in skills. Business also prefers Labour\u2019s version of Brexit \u2013 staying as close as possible to the EU \u2013 to the Tories\u2019 willingness to crash out.\n\nThere is a growing recognition that capitalism isn\u2019t working for most people and there needs to be a sea change Carys Roberts, IPPR\n\nBut Hardie has concerns, too: \u201cOften the Labour solutions are ideological rather than based on evidence. We don\u2019t agree with their approach because we think it will have damaging consequences for our country and communities.\u201d\n\nHe added that nationalisation would be a big distraction on top of Brexit and, along with giving workers shares, would send the wrong signal to investors. The economy, he said, was too fragile to increase the burden of taxes and wages on businesses.\n\nThere may be something to this, but are Labour\u2019s proposals really so extreme? Many European countries have state-run utilities and railways. Labour\u2019s plan to increase corporation tax from 19% to 26% would simply restore it to the 2011 rate. Theresa May once proposed putting workers on boards. Labour\u2019s plans, including a \u00a3250bn investment bank, show a greater commitment to industry than the Tories, who didn\u2019t even talk about industrial strategy until recently.\n\nIf anything, received wisdom is swinging in Labour\u2019s direction. You don\u2019t have to be a Marxist to believe capitalism has big problems. The financial crisis, the climate emergency and the rise of populism have left business leaders wringing their hands about how to save capitalism from itself.\n\nLast month, Apple, Amazon and Wall Street bank JPMorgan were among 200 big US companies that redefined their purpose as \u201cimproving our society\u201d and not just making money for shareholders. Similar debates are taking place in the UK.\n\nCarys Roberts, chief economist at the Institute for Public Policy Research thinktank, said: \u201cThe policies that are being proposed aren\u2019t actually as radical as some people are making out.\n\n\u201cThere is a growing recognition in quite unexpected circles that the way capitalism is set up isn\u2019t working for most people and that there needs to be a sea change.\u201d", "description": "Corbyn and McDonnell would shake things up, but what\u2019s so extreme about state-owned rail or workers on boards?", "authors": ["Sean Farrell"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b3431bd79a9a97218435df5760d51da55037875/0_164_4231_2539/master/4231.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e8d8bda3a2384b08040c1d4a1d6118ba", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
