Cheered on by thousands of fans, the Kenyan world record holder and Olympic champion completed four laps of a 9.4km circuit around the Prater, a park in the centre of the Austrian capital.\n\nKipchoge achieved the feat with a team of 41 in-and-out pacemakers, seven at a time, whose positions were guided by lasers projected on the road from a support car in front. These assisted conditions, and the fact the run was not part of an open event, mean his achievement will not count as an official world record.\n\n\u2018I feel let down\u2019: Mo Farah turns on media over questions on Alberto Salazar Read more\n\nHe remained on target throughout the effort, running each kilometre consistently in around 2\u201950\u201d. Five pacemakers ran shoulder-to-shoulder in front of Kipchoge, with one man on either side.\n\nBranded the \u2018Ineos 1:59 Challenge\u2019, the attempt was initially scheduled to take place in Battersea Park in London. The 34-year-old previously attempted the feat at Monza in Italy in 2017, falling short by 26 seconds.\n\nKipchoge said: \u201cI am feeling good. It has taken 65 years for a human to make history in sport. After Roger Bannister [running a sub four-minute mile in 1954] it took another 65 years \u2026 I\u2019m happy to be the man to run under two hours. No human is limited, and I\u2019m expecting more people to do it after today.\n\n\u201cThe 41 pacemakers are among the best athletes in the whole world \u2026 to all of them I want to say thank you, thank you for doing the job. We made history together.\u201d\n\nSir Jim Ratcliffe, Ineos chairman and CEO, said: \u201cThat last kilometre, where he accelerated and he came through on his own, it was super-human really. I can\u2019t believe he ran the first half-marathon in under an hour, and then he had to do that again.\u201d\n\nSpeaking in Vienna during Kipchoge\u2019s run, four-times Tour de France champion Chris Froome said: \u201cIt\u2019s phenomenal, it\u2019s fantastic, it\u2019s just incredible to watch him \u2013 it looks like he\u2019s not even breathing. He\u2019s just gliding over the road. It\u2019s fantastic to be here, and be part of this atmosphere.\u201d\n\nThe Kenyan-born cyclist added: \u201cTo have someone doing something as monumental as this, it\u2019s such a boost for all the athletes over there in Kenya. It\u2019s showing that the impossible is do-able.\u201d", "description": "Eliud Kipchoge made history in Vienna by running the first-ever sub two-hour marathon in a time of 1hr 59min 40sec", "authors": ["Guardian Sport"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25c79e14de5a7534bf3fad9e64f54ae07e7727c8/0_153_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6b31b162012d742c5a33a231f5f5f1cf", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
