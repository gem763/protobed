The second was into Ukraine\u2019s role in the 2016 presidential election, a reference to a conspiracy theory that \u2013 counter to the consensus view of US intelligence agencies - held that it was Ukraine that had interfered in the vote in the Democrats\u2019 favour, rather than Russia in favour of Trump.\n\n\u201cDuring that phone call, Ambassador Sondland told me that President Trump had told him that he wants President [Volodymyr] Zelenskiy to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election,\u201d Taylor said in his statement.\n\nHe added: \u201cSondland said \u2018everything\u2019 was dependent on such an announcement, including security assistance.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic representative Stephen Lynch, a senior member of the House oversight and reform committee, was quoted in Politico as saying the testimony was a \u201csea change\u201d that \u201ccould accelerate\u201d the impeachment inquiry.\n\nThe New Jersey representative Tom Malinowski, a Democrat, said it was \u201cthe most thorough accounting we\u2019ve had of the timeline\u201d.\n\nTaylor had flown to Washington in response to a congressional subpoena and in defiance of an administration gag order.\n\nThe Politico website quoted a source in the private briefing as saying Taylor\u2019s opening statement was 15 pages long and prompted \u201ca lot of sighs and gasps\u201d.\n\nTaylor\u2019s testimony was keenly awaited by Democrats on the House committees, who saw him as a key witness. The long-serving diplomat was brought out of retirement in June after the former ambassador to Kyiv, Marie Yovanovitch, was abruptly removed from her post.\n\nBill Taylor is a very credible person who has an unimpeachable record so what he says \u2026 is going to be very important Michael Carpenter\n\nIn diplomatic texts released by Congress, it is Taylor who most clearly expresses the quid pro quo being presented to the Ukrainian government by Trump\u2019s emissaries, and his deep concern about it.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor wrote on 9 September to Sondland, who was coordinating efforts to persuade the government in Kyiv to conduct investigations of Trump\u2019s political opponents. Taylor threatened to quit over the issue.\n\nTrump suspended $400m in military aid to Ukraine a few days before a 25 July phone call to Zelenskiy. In the released version of the call, when the Ukrainian president raised the matter of US military support Trump responded: \u201cI would like you to do us a favour though \u2026\u201d\n\nThe US president went on to ask for the investigation aimed at discrediting former vice-president Joe Biden and the Democratic party.\n\nTaylor\u2019s text makes clear that the trade-off was apparent to the US diplomats involved in discussions with the Ukrainian leadership, and that at least one senior diplomat, the US envoy in Kyiv, had raised a red flag about it.\n\nCongressional investigators were expected to question Taylor about the events leading up to that text that convinced him military aid was being held in an effort to pressure Kyiv.\n\nThe White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, admitted last week that a deliberate trade-off was presented to the Ukrainian government.\n\n\u201cWe do that all the time with foreign policy,\u201d he told reporters at the White House. \u201cI have news for everybody. Get over it. There is going to be political influence in foreign policy. Elections have consequences.\u201d\n\nMulvaney later tried to withdraw the remarks, claiming they had been misconstrued. The Democratic leaders of the House committees believe Taylor\u2019s testimony will put in the spotlight the most damaging allegation, that Trump withheld aid that was essential to Ukrainian efforts to confront Russian military intervention in its Donbass region, in order to secure political advantage in the 2020 election.\n\nHe was not happy about what happened to ambassador Yovanovitch Friend of Bill Taylor\n\n\u201cI think the written record is very significant because it demonstrates that there was a clear understanding, amongst the participants who spoke with Ukrainian authorities, that there was a quid pro quo and the security aid was being used to leverage,\u201d said Michael Carpenter, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense who covered Ukraine issues in the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cBill Taylor is a very credible person who has an unimpeachable record and so what he says about those messages and how he conveys his concerns about the quid pro quo is going to be very important to the inquiry going forward.\u201d\n\nTaylor is a tough witness for the White House and its supporters to undermine. He is a Vietnam war veteran with a long and distinguished record as a diplomat, including a prior stint as ambassador to Ukraine.\n\nAfter Yovanovitch was removed, Taylor was recommended as a replacement by the then special envoy on Ukraine, Kurt Volker. From his position at a thinktank, the US Institute of Peace, Taylor had closely followed Ukrainian politics. He needed no preparation to take on the role.\n\nPlay Video 5:26 Could Donald Trump actually be impeached? \u2013 video\n\nBefore taking up the post, however, Taylor requested a meeting with the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, and other top officials for reassurance about administration policy, according to a friend.\n\n\u201cHe was not happy about what happened to Ambassador Yovanovitch but he saw there was a need for someone with ambassadorial title who was well-known to the Ukrainians,\u201d Taylor\u2019s friend said.\n\nCracks in the firewall: Republicans' support for Trump begins to falter Read more\n\n\u201cHe wanted to do a quick check on the administration policy on Ukraine,\u201d the friend added. Taylor had been an early supporter of supplying US lethal military aid to Ukraine to confront Russian intervention. \u201cThe administration has actually been quite good on Ukraine but there was the question of whether the president was fully invested in it.\u201d\n\nTaylor was assured the administration was a firm supporter of arms supplies to Ukraine, so Trump\u2019s order to suspend deliveries came as a shock.\n\nIn appearing before the committees, Taylor is not observing a gag order imposed by the White House and the state department \u2013 a further sign that the wall of silence the administration has sought to erect around the Ukraine scandal continues to crumble.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very difficult for people who don\u2019t seek the limelight,\u201d said Tara Sonenshine, a former under secretary of state for public diplomacy. \u201cI think it\u2019s also very difficult to be in this foreign policy community and have to buck the tide.\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s a man of honour and a man of honesty and can always be counted on to do what\u2019s right.\u201d", "description": "Ambassador Bill Taylor\u2019s testimony to House committees met with \u2018sighs and gasps\u2019", "authors": ["Julian Borger"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97f151703ce8a44336fb2da0a7b717db57eba814/0_24_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=bb745f661f71bd3b61b31b2a4483cbb1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
