Everything, probably. After all, it\u2019s your camera, satnav, email, social media hub, games machine, digital wallet, video viewer and portal to the internet. Oh, and it makes phone calls. Priorities today are different from even a few years ago: big screens are popular \u2013 edge-to-edge screens especially. But the desire for good battery life remains unchanged.\n\nThere are two operating systems to choose from: iOS which runs only on Apple devices like the iPhone or iPad and Android, from Google. Android is the system which every manufacturer other than Apple has now adopted (even companies like Nokia and BlackBerry who previously went their own way).\n\nThe advantages of iOS include the smooth, seamless way it integrates with Apple products such as your iPad, Mac and the smart HomePod speaker. Android users, however, will find switching from one Android brand to another, say from Huawei to Sony, a painless process, as Google insists on a degree of uniformity for companies using the platform.\n\nThe move to screens which cover the whole of the front of a phone, or almost, has led to something called \u201cthe notch\u201d, a cut-out at the top of the display where the camera sits. In the case of the iPhone XS, XS Max and forthcoming XR phones, that\u2019s where the TrueDepth camera sits, which delivers high-quality facial recognition that obviates the need for a fingerprint sensor.\n\nOther phones have this notch, and sometimes facial recognition \u2013 but Apple\u2019s system is the only one that\u2019s good enough for you to remove the fingerprint sensor, and it works safely with the digital wallet, Apple Pay.\n\nOther phones have fingerprint sensors too, on the back in every case here, apart from the BlackBerry.\n\nMany phones now have twin rear cameras (and one even has three). Often these are lenses with different focal lengths to help overcome the feature that phone cameras lack: optical zoom. If one camera has twice the focal length of the other, you effectively have a 2x zoom. Twin lenses also mean you can shoot both cameras at the same time and software can work out what\u2019s what, so it can create a delightful bokeh effect where the subject is in sharp focus and the background artistically blurred.\n\nNote that most flagship phones now lack a traditional headphone jack, so you\u2019ll need to use the supplied headphones, an adaptor with your favourite headphones, or wireless cans. Most phones, though not the latest iPhones, include an adaptor \u2013 in Apple\u2019s case you can buy it separately for \u00a39.\n\nYou can trust our independent reviews.

No\n\nCamera (rear): 12MP wide, 12MP telephoto. 12MP ultra-wide\n\nCamera (front): 12MP\u200b\n\nDimensions: 144 x 71.4 x 8.1mm\n\nWeight: 188g\n\nHeadphone jack? No\n\nThe latest top-flight iPhone is the best yet. It has three rear cameras which are capable of great versatility and solid, realistic effects including a deft portrait mode where the subject is in pin-sharp focus and the background delicately blurred. There\u2019s also a night mode which launches automatically in low light to boost light in a realistic and attractive way. The third camera is an ultra-wide lens which lets you take in much more of the location easily.\n\nJust as importantly, the latest iPhones have significantly improved battery life so that the phone will really last all day with no issue, which is great for peace of mind. Video capture is also exceptionally good, with super-high resolution 4K video and the facility to shoot video while you\u2019re in still picture mode by holding the shutter button. The front-facing camera is also improved, now a 12MP camera like the three on the back.\n\nThe new processor is blazingly fast, Face ID, Apple\u2019s superb and secure face recognition system is improved to work at more angles, and the software now has a dark mode (available to all iPhones running iOS 13). It comes in two sizes. The iPhone 11 Pro has a 5.8in display and the iPhone 11 Pro Max a 6.5in screen. The larger model costs \u00a3100 more.\n\nPre-order now Available from Friday, September 20\n\nSamsung Galaxy S10+: \u00a3899, Samsung\n\nScreen size and resolution: 6.4in, 1440 x 3040 pixels, 522ppi\u200b\n\nScreen technology: OLED\n\nStorage capacity: 128GB/512GB/1TB\u200b\n\nExpandable storage? Yes\n\nCamera (rear): 12MP wide-angle, 12MP telephoto, 16MP ultra-wide\n\nCamera (front): 10MP plus 8MP\u200b\n\nDimensions: 157.6 x 74.1 x 7.8mm\n\nWeight: 175g\u200b\n\nHeadphone jack? Yes\n\nThe latest in the Galaxy S series from Samsung come in three versions: S10e, S10 and this model, the S10+, while a Galaxy S10 5G will follow later in the year. The S10+ has a dazzlingly attractive, high-resolution screen which is bright and vivid. It has a very cool fingerprint sensor which is buried in the display itself. Press, and a ripple effect appears and the phone unlocks. It also has two-way wireless charging. This means that not only can you charge the phone by placing it on a wireless charging pad, you can turn the phone into a charger. When you launch the Wireless PowerShare app, it will charge another compatible phone by holding the two together and it doesn\u2019t need to be another Samsung phone, just any wireless chargeable handset. Until now, the Huawei Mate 20 Pro was the only phone with this feature, but the Huawei P30 Pro also has this feature. Samsung has its own virtual personal assistant, called Bixby. Though no match for Siri, it\u2019s getting better (though she sometimes sounds very stroppy, which isn\u2019t always what you want).\n\nThe three rear cameras are very fast and work well even in low light. The ultra-wide lens is great for landscapes. Battery life is strong and performance is fast. Instead of a notch out of the display, the front facing cameras (there are two of them) peep out from a small cut-out in the screen. This is by far the smartest-looking phone yet from Samsung.\n\nBuy now\n\nApple iPhone 11: From \u00a3729, Apple\n\nScreen size and resolution: 6.1in, 1125 x 2436 pixels, 458 pixels per inch\n\nScreen technology: LCD\n\nStorage capacity: 64/128/256GB\u200b\n\nExpandable storage? No\n\nCamera (rear): 12MP wide, 12MP telephoto\n\nCamera (front): 12MP\u200b\n\nDimensions: 150.9 x 75.7 x 8.3mm\n\nWeight: 194g\u200b\n\nHeadphone jack? No\n\nThe latest iPhone comes in six different colours, including two brand-new shades, purple (really more of a lavender, but very nice) and green. It has two cameras, identical to the wide and ultra-wide lenses on the iPhone 11 Pro, plus the same 12MP front-facing camera. It also shares the same super-fast processor as the Pro models, so this is a powerful phone. It also has great battery life and many other features including face ID.\n\nThe display here is LCD, not the more expensive OLED on the other new iPhones, but Apple has managed to create an LCD with very narrow bezels (frame around the screen) which most rivals have failed to do.\n\nLike the Pro, it has access to Apple\u2019s millions of apps, sublime operating system and reputation of outstanding security. Battery life, already good on the iPhone XR which it follows, is even better here. This iPhone, unusually, is at a lower price than its immediate predecessor. That phone, the iPhone XR, also remains on sale and has dropped in price to \u00a3699.\n\nPre-order now Available from Friday, September 20\n\nHuawei P30 Pro: \u00a3899, Carphone Warehouse\n\nScreen size and resolution: 6.47in, 1080 x 2340 pixels, 398ppi\u200b\u200b\n\nScreen technology: OLED\n\nStorage capacity: 128/256/512GB\u200b\n\nExpandable storage? Yes\n\nCamera (rear): 40MP, 20MP, 8MP\u200b\n\nCamera (front): 32MP\u200b\n\nDimensions: 158 x 73.4 x 8.4mm\n\nWeight: 192g\u200b\n\nHeadphone jack? No\n\nThe P30 Pro is an outstanding cameraphone. All the cameras are designed in conjunction with Leica and offer amazing versatility. As the focal length of each sensor is set, the phone switches seamlessly between lenses as you zoom in and out. There\u2019s the main lens, a 5x telephoto and a super-wide lens which is 0.6x the main lens. A fourth camera, called time-of-flight, helps to measure depth to maximise sharpness on the pictures you take. Beyond the cameras, the P30 Pro has a long-lasting battery and fingerprint sensor under the display. It also has two-way wireless charging so you can help a friend with a low battery if they have wireless charging capability. Huawei has recently had issues with the USA but recent interventions by the president suggest that the situation has calmed. Huawei has also said that recent phones like the P30 Pro will definitely get the next major update from Amazon.\n\nBuy now\n\nSony Xperia 1: \u00a3849.99, Carphone Warehouse\n\nScreen size and resolution: 6.5in, 1644 x 3840 pixels, 643ppi\u200b\n\nScreen technology: OLED\u200b\n\nStorage capacity: 64/128GB\u200b\n\nExpandable storage? Yes\n\nCamera (rear): 12MP, 12MP, 12MP\u200b\n\nCamera (front): 8MP\u200b\n\nDimensions: 167 x 72 x 8.2mm\n\nWeight: 178g\u200b\n\nHeadphone jack? No\n\nThis is Sony\u2019s first phone with three cameras. All are 12MP resolution but have different focal lengths to provide a telephoto lens with the equivalent of 2x optical zoom of the main one, and a wide-angle lens that\u2019s 0.6x the main camera. The display on this phone is very eye-catching \u2013 it has 4K resolution, the same as a UHD full-size TV. Add to this the fact that it\u2019s an OLED screen devised in conjunction with Sony\u2019s TV division, and includes HDR capabilities and it means watching movies or shows on this screen is pretty eye-popping. The phone is longer and narrower than many, which may not suit everyone. It also lacks wireless charging \u2013 Sony says it wanted the slimmest phone it could make. Strong battery life, and a stunning display.\n\nBuy now\n\nHuawei Mate 20 Pro: \u00a3799, Carphone Warehouse\n\nScreen size and resolution: 6.39in, 1440 x 3120 pixels, 538ppi\u200b\n\nScreen technology: OLED\n\nStorage capacity: 128GB/256GB\u200b\n\nExpandable storage? Yes\n\nCamera (rear): 40MP wide-angle, 8MP telephoto, 20MP ultra-wide\n\nCamera (front): 24MP\u200b\n\nDimensions: 157 x 72.3 x 8.6mm\n\nWeight: 189g\u200b\n\nHeadphone jack? No\n\nLike the Samsung Galaxy S10+, this has two brilliant innovations, a fingerprint scanner in the screen itself and two-way wireless charging so you can recharge a friend\u2019s phone. The triple rear cameras, all made in conjunction with Leica, are amazing, matching sharpness with detail and rich colours. The camera is very fast and takes reliably good shots. Huawei has built artificial intelligence into the camera to adjust images according to the subject (a cat will have more detail in the fur but a picture of a dog will enhance its eyes). The design is very eye-catching and the phone feels good in the hand.\n\nBuy now\n\nSamsung Galaxy Note9: from \u00a3849, Samsung\n\nScreen size and resolution: 6.4in, 1440 x 2960 pixels, 516ppi\n\nScreen technology: OLED\n\nStorage capacity: 128GB/512GB\n\nExpandable storage? Yes\n\nCamera (rear): 12MP wide-angle, 12MP telephoto\n\nCamera (front): 8MP\n\nDimensions: 161.9 x 76.4 x 8.8mm\n\nWeight: 201g\n\nHeadphone jack? Yes\n\nSamsung is one of the few companies that builds a traditional headphone jack into its flagship phones \u2013 and there\u2019s no notch on the display either. The Note9 is so named because it has a stylus, called the S Pen, which pops out of the base of the handset and is used for scribbling notes on the large display, for instance. The latest S Pen also works as a wireless trigger: press the button and it\u2019ll shoot a photo on the phone\u2019s camera or advance your presentation to the next slide.\n\nThe screen is big but so is the battery \u2013 the biggest ever in a Samsung phone \u2013 and it lasts a full day with ease. This is also a phone with a very polished design. Because Samsung adds its own look to the Android operating system, it can take longer for the latest updates to arrive, compared to a phone from Nokia or Google, for instance.\n\nBuy now\n\nOppo Reno 10x: \u00a3699.99, Carphone Warehouse\n\nScreen size and resolution: 6.6in, 1080 x 2340 pixels, 387ppi\u200b\n\nOppo Reno 10x: \u00a3699.99, Carphone Warehouse\n\nScreen size and resolution: 6.6in, 1080 x 2340 pixels, 387ppi\n\nScreen technology: OLED\n\nStorage capacity: 128/256GB\n\nExpandable storage? Yes\n\nCamera (rear): 48MP, 13MP, 8MP\n\nCamera (front): 16MP\n\nDimensions: 162 x 77.2 x 9.3mm\n\nWeight: 210g\n\nHeadphone jack? No\n\nThe Oppo Reno 10x has an all-screen front, a trick it carries off by burying the selfie camera inside the phone itself, like on the OnePlus 7 Pro below. But here the camera swings out in a shark-fin extension that looks great. As does the large display which is pin-sharp and colourful. On the back are three cameras including one with a focal length five times the regular lens. Because of optical image stabilisation and clever software, it means the camera delivers really excellent 10x zoom images. The camera software is not as advanced as on the Huawei P30 Pro which remains the outstanding cameraphone.\n\nBuy now\n\nOnePlus 7 Pro: From \u00a3649, OnePlus\n\nScreen size and resolution: 6.67in, 1440 x 3120 pixels, 516ppi\u200b\n\nScreen technology: OLED\u200b\n\nStorage capacity: 128/256GB\u200b\n\nExpandable storage? No\n\nCamera (rear): 48MP, 16MP, 8MP\u200b\n\nCamera (front): 16MP\u200b\n\nDimensions: 162.6 x 75 x 8.8mm\n\nWeight: 206g\u200b\n\nHeadphone jack? No\n\nTo make this phone as near to all-screen on the front as possible, OnePlus has hidden the front-facing camera. It pops up on a motorised mechanism from within the body of the phone when you need to use the face recognition to unlock the handset or take a selfie. It also has a fingerprint sensor, buried under the display. The three rear cameras are definite improvements on the previous (and already good) OnePlus cameras. There\u2019s no wireless charging but it comes with a fast charger so you can charge the phone from pancake-flat to 50 per cent in less than half an hour. There\u2019s also a 5G version of this phone which is almost identical to look at. That\u2019s available on EE, on contract only.\n\nBuy now\n\nMotorola One: \u00a3269, Motorola\n\nScreen size and resolution: 5.9in, 720 x 1520 pixels, 287ppi\n\nScreen technology: LCD\n\nStorage capacity: 64GB\n\nExpandable storage? Yes\n\nCamera (rear): 13MP, 2MP depth sensor\n\nCamera (front): 13MP\n\nDimensions: 150 x 72 x 7.97mm\n\nWeight: 162g\n\nHeadphone jack? Yes\n\nThis is a great budget phone, squeezing in a nearly all-screen display and dual cameras for a much lower price than you might imagine. And if you like the look of the iPhone XS, this isn\u2019t dissimilar, and hides the fact that the screen doesn\u2019t reach all the way down by putting the Moto logo there. It uses Android One, a platform which, because it uses a very plain version of the Android operating system, guarantees speedy updates for at least two years.\n\nTwin rear cameras work using a medium-resolution sensor with a lower-resolution second sensor just used for depth sensing, to improve sharpness in low light and elegant bokeh effects. This is a fun and enjoyable phone to use.\n\nBuy now\n\nBlackBerry Key2: from \u00a3469, Blackberry\n\nScreen size and resolution: 4.5in, 1080 x 1620 pixels, 434ppi\n\nScreen technology: LCD\n\nStorage capacity: 64/128GB\n\nExpandable storage? Yes\n\nCamera (rear): 12MP\n\nCamera (front): 8MP\n\nDimensions: 151.4 x 71.8 x 8.5mm\n\nWeight: 168g\n\nHeadphone jack? Yes\n\nIf you like to text on a physical keyboard instead of a glass screen, the BlackBerry is ideal. The screen is the smallest here, though still big enough for watching video, if not, an epic movie. The keys themselves are tremendous; comfortable and with enough travel to make typing at speed a reality. They are also smart keys and you can \u201cswipe\u201d letters or words onto the screen. And there\u2019s an extra secret, as the space bar is also the fingerprint sensor.\n\nA special key lets you move quickly between apps, which is useful and quickly becomes second nature. And BlackBerry is known for its high security options that sit on top of the Android operating system. The cameras are good enough, though outshone by others here. Battery life has always been key to BlackBerry and is decent in the Key2.\n\nBuy now\n\nNokia 7.1: \u00a3299, Carphone Warehouse\n\nScreen size and resolution: 5.8in, 1020 x 2280, 432ppi\u200b\n\nScreen technology: LCD\n\nStorage capacity: 32GB\u200b\n\nExpandable storage? Yes\n\nCamera (rear): 12MP, 5MP depth sensor\n\nCamera (front): 8MP\u200b\n\nDimensions: 149.7 x 71.2 x 8mm\u200b\n\nWeight: 160g\u200b\n\nHeadphone jack? Yes\n\nNokia phones are now made by HMD Global, a Finnish company which has the licence to use the name and has much in common with the previous Nokia, including continuity of many designers and engineers. That\u2019s evident in the stylish design here, the phone feels solid and appealing. Nokia has had an association with lens company Zeiss for years and that continues with this model \u2013 the camera is highly capable. Nokia uses a very plain version of Android (apart from the camera, the apps are all standard Google), which means Android updates come quickly. Nokia phones have outstanding build quality and this is no exception.\n\nBuy now\n\nGoogle Pixel 3 XL: from \u00a3869, Google\n\nScreen size and resolution: 6.3in, 1440 x 2960, 523ppi\n\nScreen technology: OLED\n\nStorage capacity: 64/128GB\n\nExpandable storage? No\n\nCamera (rear): 12.2MP\n\nCamera (front): 8MP\n\nDimensions: 158 x 76.7 x 7.9mm\n\nWeight: 184g\n\nHeadphone jack? No\n\nThe Pixel series are the only Android phones where software and hardware are made by the same company. The new Pixel 3 comes in an XL and a smaller regular size. The XL has a notch at the top of the screen, and it\u2019s a slightly weird looking one at that, but the smaller phone does not. Google has eschewed the dual camera system favoured by many, making effects like bokeh happen entirely through software.\n\nThis may sound like a poor solution, but in fact it works extremely well and like other phones here, Google uses AI to improve exposures and other details for better results. It performs especially in low light thanks to a Night Sight feature \u2013 though the Huawei P20 Pro is also very proficient in near-dark situations. It also uses AI as a system to screen calls automatically, the company claims. Google\u2019s own-brand phones always have the very latest software first, which is useful.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Smartphones\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone 11 Pro is tremendous, with astonishingly good cameras and, just as important, significantly improved battery life. For many, the much-cheaper Apple iPhone 11 will satisfy the most demanding expectations. The Huawei P30 Pro has a fingerprint sensor under the display and an astonishing camera set-up that\u2019s better than everything else here \u2013 though the iPhone Pro camera has a new feature called Deep Fusion coming this autumn that may put it in the lead again.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
