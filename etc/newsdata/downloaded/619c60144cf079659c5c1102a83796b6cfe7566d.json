I just grow'.\n\nHe was blasted by presenters Piers and Susanna Reid who accused him of not taking climate change seriously.\n\nPiers told him: 'Had you made a coherent, powerful, science-based argument, you could have made a real impact.'\n\nHis van pumps out around 2.7 tonnes of CO2 each year, leaving him with a carbon footprint that is the same as a return flight from London to Sydney, according to the Sun\n\nAt one point, the exchange was interrupted by Mr Everson who said he had to take a phone call - pulling out a banana from his pocket and answering it like a phone.\n\nExplaining why he did this, he told the paper: 'Have you ever seen an interview with Piers Morgan? You can tell Piers it gets dark at night and he will shout you down. We decided not to let him do that to me.'\n\nA video of him being apprehended by three Met Police officers on Monday, as he carried a sign saying 'I'm locally-sourced and environmentally-friendly' and shouted 'give peas a chance', has been viewed millions of times online.\n\nHe was arrested under the Public Order Act but was later released without charge.\n\nMr Everson also uses the equally strange moniker 'Lunchy Munchy\u2019 and is a senior member of the 'Friendsnotfood' group in the West Country\n\nIn a bizarre exchange on the ITV programme this week he was repeatedly asked what his aims were and whether he 'identifies as a broccoli'.\n\nMr Broccoli simply replied: 'I am Mr Broccoli Head. I'm just a humble broccoli. I've always been a piece of broccoli.'\n\nQuizzed on what he wanted the government and big businesses to do about climate change, he quipped: 'We are in extremely hot water environmentally speaking. It's going to go pear shaped.'\n\nHe was slammed by Piers, who he repeatedly referred to as 'Peas', and was told he 'didn't know the facts'.\n\nThe GMB anchor said: 'Why should I listen to you? You've brought London to a standstill for two weeks, we give you the chance to come on national television to present your case and you sit there dressed like a broccoli.'\n\nSusanna fumed: 'It's a serious point. You're not going to win anyone over dressed as a broccoli.'\n\nAsked whether he 'practices what he preaches' and has electronic gadgets that pollute the environment, Mr Everson replied: 'I just grow. I'm just a broccoli. I don't have electricity.'\n\nBut a picture of him posted on social media shows he got a taxi to the ITV studios to take part in the show - and not public transport.\n\nIt comes after Piers blasted Extinction Rebellion co-founder Skeena Rathor for getting a chauffeured car to the west London studios when she appeared on the show last week.\n\nAfter advocating a plant-based diet, the vegan activist was asked why it would save planet, but couldn't provide an answer.\n\nHe said 'I'm not a scientist' and 'a plant based food system is great for the environment', before his fellow Animal Rebellion activist chimed in: 'My client is just a broccoli, it's very easy to cherry pick the science. It's easy to talk about individual change.'", "description": "Activist Roland Everson, 46, has been outed as the driver of a diesel-guzzling Mercedes-Benz Sprinter.
