This will aid NASA as it prepares to return to the moon in 2024 as part of its Artemis program.\n\nThe LRO has an orbiter that scans the moon, building the image one line at a time. It also has a laser altimeter, which uses laser pulses to help build the image of the moon.\n\nNoah Petro, an LRO scientist at Goddard, said Wright's work is important, even if people don't realize that he's helping them.\n\n\u201cHe can help tell the story using the LRO data, and illustrate difficult-to-communicate ideas or concepts, of whatever the story might be,\u201d Petro said in the statement. \u201cSo I think he\u2019s already had some influence on how people consume the information, when they don\u2019t even know it.\u201d\n\nWright likened the use of 3D animation software to filming live action, using lights, cameras, props and sets, adding \"visualization is more like filming a documentary. You\u2019re being factual, but you\u2019re also creating a narrative.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re putting the pictures back into context, Wright continued, saying \u201cwe\u2019re putting them back where they came from.\u201d\n\nThe CGI Moon kit can be accessed here.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP", "description": "NASA has created a 3D map of the moon, using CGI and data and imagery from its Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.", "authors": ["Chris Ciaccia"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/nasa-moon-gif.gif", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
