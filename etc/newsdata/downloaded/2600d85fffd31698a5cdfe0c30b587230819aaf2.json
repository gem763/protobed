PRECIOUS-Gold holds above $1,490 on weak Chinese data, Brexit prospects\n\n* Gold supported by dollar, which is near 8-week low\n\n* Palladium sees best week since Sept. 13\n\n\n\n(Adds details; Updates prices)\n\nBy Karthika Suresh Namboothiri\n\nOct 18 (Reuters) - Gold prices held above $1,490 on Friday\n\nas disappointing data from China reinforced concerns that its\n\ntrade spat with the United States had begun taking a toll on\n\nglobal economies, while the Brexit deal waits for parliamentary\n\nbacking.\n\nSpot gold rose 0.1% to $1,492.45 per ounce as of 0522\n\nGMT. Prices had gained about 0.2% in the week.\n\nU.S. gold futures GCcv1 dropped 0.1% to $1,496.10 per\n\nounce.\n\nThe European Union backed a new Brexit deal with Britain on\n\nThursday, which prompted an uptick in Asian shares in early\n\ntrade. However, gains were capped after disappointing Chinese\n\neconomic growth data. MKTS/GLOB While markets promptly cheered progress in talks, doubts\n\nerupt if Prime Minister Boris Johnson will be able to secure the\n\nUK parliament's backing for the agreement if he is to take\n\nBritain out of Europe on Oct. 31.\n\n\"The Brexit deal did not have as much a negative impact on\n\ngold as expected. This means that there are still concerns that\n\nit might not get passed in the parliament,\" said Brian Lan,\n\nmanaging director at dealer GoldSilver Central in Singapore.\n\n\"Gold will be range-bound until and unless we have some\n\nclarity on Brexit and other geo-political risks,\" Lan said\n\nadding that he expects gold to trade around $1,475 and $1,503\n\nper ounce in the short term.\n\nWorries surrounding a trade war between the United States\n\nand China still lingered, with China's economic growth slowing\n\nmore than expected to 6% year-on-year in the third quarter, the\n\nweakest pace in almost three decades. The world's two-largest economies have imposed tariffs on\n\neach other's goods in a dispute over China's trade and\n\nindustrial policies that has slammed the brakes on global\n\neconomic growth. Gold is often used at such times as a hedge\n\nagainst uncertainty.\n\nThe dollar index at a near eight-week low has also\n\nlent support to the metal. USD/\n\nANZ Bank said in a note it expects gold to receive support\n\nfrom elevated macro and geopolitical risks, with under-supplied\n\nPGM (platinum group metal) prices likely to push higher.\n\n\"The palladium market is still structurally tight, keeping\n\nprices resilient with intermittent volatility.\"\n\nAmongst other precious metals, palladium XPD= rose 0.1%\n\nhigher to $1,760.67, a day after hitting a record high of\n\n$1,783.21 an ounce. The autocatalyst metal was up 3.6% for the\n\nweek, and set for its best since the week of Sept. 13.\n\nPlatinum XPT= shed 0.2% to $885 per ounce while silver\n\ninched 0.1% higher to $17.54.\n\n\n\n", "description": "PRECIOUS-Gold holds above $1,490 on weak Chinese data, Brexit prospects", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPED0M02I_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
