REUTERS/Tingshu Wang\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver opened a pre-game news conference talking about the future of basketball in Japan before being peppered with questions about the uproar over a tweet by the Rockets\u2019 general manager in support of pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\n\nGeneral manager Daryl Morey apologised on Monday for any hurt caused by the tweet, which he deleted over the weekend after drawing swift condemnation from China\u2019s government, fans and the team\u2019s partners.\n\nBut the damage was already done, with Houston losing sponsors and broadcasts in a key market for the National Basketball Association.\n\nIn the latest fallout, Chinese state television said on Tuesday it would not air NBA exhibition games played in the country this week.\n\nSilver said he had issued an additional statement on the China row on Tuesday in part because of CCTV\u2019s announcement that it would no longer be airing the preseason games between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Brooklyn Nets.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something we expected to happen. It\u2019s unfortunate,\u201d Silver said of CCTV\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cBut if that\u2019s the consequences of us adhering to our values, we still feel it\u2019s critically important to adhere to those values,\u201d he said, stressing the NBA\u2019s commitment to freedom of expression for its employees.\n\nSilver said he would travel to Shanghai as planned on Wednesday and attend the Lakers-Nets game on Thursday night.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my hope when I\u2019m in Shanghai, I can meet with the appropriate officials and discuss where we stand and can put those remarks from Daryl Morey in an appropriate context,\u201d he said.\n\nRockets star James Harden brushed off the situation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a distraction. We\u2019re focusing on our team and getting better. We have a great opportunity ahead of us and honestly we\u2019re focused on every single day,\u201d he told a post-game news conference.\n\n\u201cOur sole focus is on the Rockets.\u201d\n\nBut Houston head coach Mike D\u2019Antoni had a much testier response for a reporter after the game, in which the Raptors beat the Rockets 134-129.\n\n\u201cI know you have your job to do and ask questions. I\u2019m here to play basketball and coach basketball. That\u2019s what we did tonight. And that\u2019s what we will comment on,\u201d he said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Men walk past a poster at an NBA exhibition in Beijing, China October 8, 2019.
