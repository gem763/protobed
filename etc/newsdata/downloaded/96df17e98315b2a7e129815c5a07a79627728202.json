Here\u2019s why that\u2019s important: DoH keeps your internet browsing private and secure by hiding DNS requests \u2014 from your ISP, from software on your system (like parental control apps or other blocking software), and from anything else that might try to suss out what you\u2019re up to.\n\nThe feature is due in late September but you can manually enable it right now. Here are the required steps.\n\nDoH will soon be a default feature for a small subset of Firefox users once the update rolls out, and a broader rollout once everything is confirmed to work without issue. The feature also happens to be available in Firefox browsers right now for those who don\u2019t want to wait\u2014all it takes is a few tweaks in the settings menu:\n\nScreenshot: Brendan Hesse, Firefox\n\nOpen a new Firefox tab on desktop.

Scroll down to Network Settings and click \u201cSettings.\u201d Scroll down and tick the box next to \u201cEnable DNS over HTTPS.\u201d Once enabled, you can configure your DNS provider settings. Click the drop-down box and select \u201cCloudflare\u201d to use the default DNS provider and settings\u2014which we suggest for the general user\u2014or select \u201cCustom\u201d to manually set up your own if you have a separate service you wish to use. (For what it\u2019s worth, one of the reasons Cloudflare and Mozilla partnered up is because Cloudflare agreed to collect as little traffic data as possible from Firefox users.)\n\nThe above steps are the \u201ceasy way\u201d of turning on DNS over HTTPS in Firefox; there\u2019s also a more complicated way that allows you to mess with the settings as you go.", "description": "Mozilla will enable Firefox\u2019s DNS over HTTPS (DoH) service by default for all users.
