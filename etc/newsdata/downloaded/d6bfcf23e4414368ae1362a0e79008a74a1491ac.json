It\u2019s naturally fresh, glossy and pretty with a little bit of a rebellious side! The skin is dewy with a glow, a fresh but polished complexion and 80s style blush for youthful-looking, rosy-pink cheeks.\n\n'For the pastel pop paintedeye, I took inspiration from the brilliant, beautiful colors in the collection - it\u2019s all about creating shapes on the eyes, using blocks of color, softly blurred and blended, not too defined. The lips were kept natural-looking and balmy with a soft pink stain.'\n\nSpeaking about Sofia's work, designer Olivia Rubin couldn't stop gushing about the makeup look she created for the show, describing it as 'original, innovative, and feminine'.\n\nSupplies!
