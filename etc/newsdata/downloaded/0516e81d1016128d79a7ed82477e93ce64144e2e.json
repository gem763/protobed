He stands out in the House caucus as being a centrist among centrists. How centrist? He, uh, didn\u2019t endorse Obama in 2012. He didn\u2019t vote for ObamaCare in 2010 either. He\u2019s pro-life. And he supported DOMA before the Supreme Court flushed it.\n\nI mean, in fairness to AOC, if you\u2019re looking for someone in Congress who meets the description of \u201cDINO,\u201d it\u2019s Dan Lipinski.\n\nIn 2018, after running effectively unopposed for years, he faced the same sort of dangerous primary challenge from the left that Ocasio-Cortez herself successfully mounted against Joe Crowley in New York. Lipinski held on in his race, though, defeating progressive Marie Newman 51/49, a margin of about 2,000 votes. Newman\u2019s running against him again in 2020 and trying to line up big-name left-wing support to push her over the top this time. And so AOC faced a dilemma. On the one hand, nothing would be more natural for her than to back a grassroots progressive \u201cchange the party\u201d primary effort in Illinois like the one that swept her into Congress last year in Queens.\n\nBut on the other hand, some of her House Democratic colleagues resent her because they fear she\u2019s lining up challengers to them in their districts. You may remember that that issue figured in complaints about her now former chief of staff, Saikat Chakrabarti. Chakrabarti was one of the co-founders of the far-left Justice Democrats PAC, the same group that supported AOC against Crowley and is now supporting Newman against Lipinski. His outspoken criticism of centrist Dems in the House and his relationship with the PAC made Democrats from blue districts nervous that he and AOC might try to get them primaried. Hence AOC\u2019s other option here \u2014 renounce support for any primary challenges this year in the name of comity, which would improve her relationships with her House colleagues. But it would also piss off progressives who sent her to D.C. to try to remake the party in their image.\n\nPlay nice or support the revolution: That was her choice in deciding whether to stay out of Lipinski\u2019s race or support Newman. She chose revolution.\n\n\u201cMarie Newman is a textbook example of one of the ways that we could be better as a party \u2014 to come from a deep blue seat and to be championing all the issues we need to be championing,\u201d Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview. Of Mr. Lipinski, she said: \u201cThe fact that a deep blue seat is advocating for many parts of the Republican agenda is extremely problematic. We\u2019re not talking about a swing state that is being forced to take tough votes.\u201d\u2026 \u201cThis campaign is about putting someone in place that is in alignment directly with the district on issues like affordability for the middle class and working families, the Green New Deal,\u201d Ms. Newman said in an interview on Monday, adding that she and Ms. Ocasio-Cortez \u201cshare some very similar values.\u201d\n\nFormer RNC guy Doug Heye has seen this movie before on the right side of the political aisle:\n\nThe House Democratic Freedom Caucus begins deciding who is a good Democrat and a bad Democrat. https://t.co/Er5TEEhQM3 \u2014 Doug Heye (@DougHeye) September 17, 2019\n\nTargeting Lipinski was the safest, most judicious way for Ocasio-Cortez to dip a toe into the process of primarying her own colleagues. He\u2019s waaaay out on the right wing of the party, after all. And she\u2019s not the first progressive Democrat in Congress to endorse Newman in this race: Rep. Ro Khanna has already done so, notes the Times, and the head of the DCCC had to cancel a fundraiser for Lipinski earlier this year when the left howled at her for trying to prop him up. (The Democratic leadership and the DCCC continue to support his reelection, however.) Lipinski\u2019s also a white guy and some of the House Dems who have been most worried about AOC-backed primary challenges (e.g., Lacy Clay) are black, fearing that their very blue districts make them a prime target for a primary challenge by Justice Democrats. Focusing on Lipinski may be a signal from Ocasio-Cortez that she\u2019ll avoid targeting minority lawmakers. It\u2019s simply the least controversial primary challenge that AOC could possibly have supported.\n\nTo everyone, that is, except Dan Lipinski. Here\u2019s that reaction I mentioned up top. Hoo boy.\n\nThose first two paragraphs sound almost Republican, which I suppose is on-brand for Lipinski. But there\u2019s a method to his madness, perhaps: Primary elections in Illinois are open, meaning that you don\u2019t need to register as a member of a party beforehand to vote in its primary on Election Day. Lipinski\u2019s apparently going to try to use AOC against Newman by highlighting her support, hoping that the district\u2019s Republican minority will flood into the Democratic primary and hand him a victory to spite her. Between that, his incumbency, and his family legacy, there\u2019s at least a chance that he\u2019ll hold the seat despite her best efforts. Imagine if the Ocasio-Cortez endorsement ends up as the kiss of death in a blue district.\n\nShe didn\u2019t care for Lipinski\u2019s response, by the way:\n\nThis is a real quote from a Democrat representing a safe blue seat. Aggressive statements like these are so casually thrown from corporate candidates towards grassroots ones, yet they never get branded as \u201cdivisive,\u201d despite their rhetoric. We should ask ourselves why that is. https://t.co/wb3AOz5285 \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 17, 2019\n\nOne last note on this via Jon Ward. If AOC was hesitant to jump into Lipinski\u2019s race, she may have felt obliged after she surprised a few people last week by endorsing Ed Markey for reelection to the Senate in Massachusetts. Left-wing revolutionaries aren\u2019t supposed to back incumbents who are being challenged by young progressives, right? The difference with Markey is that he\u2019s the sponsor in the Senate of her Green New Deal plan. She owed him one and she delivered. We\u2019ll see if it helps him fend off a primary challenge from Joe Kennedy.", "description": "Popcorn.", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Ed Morrissey"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/a-4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
