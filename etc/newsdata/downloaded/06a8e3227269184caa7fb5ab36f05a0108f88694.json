It brought the number of people from the island of Ireland who have been arrested to five, fuelling suspicion an Irish smuggling gang was part of the network that transported the migrants.\n\nThe sprawling police investigation stretches from the Irish border, England, continental Europe and Vietnam, where many of the victims are believed to have come from.\n\nRobinson, who is known as Mo, was arrested early on Wednesday morning after police were alerted to the discovery of 31 men and eight women in the back of a lorry trailer in Grays, Essex. Robinson had picked up the trailer, which had arrived in Purfleet from Zeebrugge, with his Scania lorry cab less than an hour earlier.\n\nEssex police said the Crown Prosecution Service had decided to charge the driver. \u201cHe is due to appear at Chelmsford magistrates court on Monday 28 October charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people, conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration and money laundering.\u201d\n\nFriends and relatives of Robinson have protested his innocence.\n\nA portrait of some of the alleged victims has emerged from Vietnam where relatives of missing migrants have come forward.\n\nDCI Martin Pasmore told reporters he had met the Vietnamese ambassador to the UK, Tran Ngoc An, and that investigators will share fingerprints with Vietnamese authorities to try to identify the dead. The bodies have been taken to Broomfield hospital in Chelmsford for postmortem examinations.\n\nThe 23-year-old Northern Irish man arrested at Dublin port on Saturday is understood to be a person of interest to Essex police. Gardai held him over an unrelated outstanding court order concerning an offence in Ireland. He was due to appear in court later on Saturday.\n\nOn Friday British police made three other arrests.\n\nJoanna and Thomas Maher, both aged 38, are a married Irish couple living in Warrington. Before being arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and on suspicion of manslaughter they told reporters they had sold the truck 13 months ago. They expressed disgust at the migrants\u2019 deaths.\n\nAlso on Friday, police arrested a 48-year-old man from Northern Ireland at Stansted airport on suspicion of conspiracy to traffic people and on suspicion of manslaughter.\n\nIn Belgium, police are hunting the driver who delivered the trailer to the port of Zeebrugge before it arrived in Purfleet port, where Robinson collected it and drove a short distance before reportedly discovering the dead migrants and raising the alarm.\n\nGlobal Trailer Rental Europe, an Irish company based in Co Monaghan, owns the trailer. It rented it on 15 October to an Irish haulier based in a nearby town.\n\nWhen the Guardian visited the area on Saturday residents who identified themselves as relatives of the haulier said he was not at home. They declined to comment.\n\nGPS data from the refrigerated unit shows it left Monaghan on 15 October and crossed into Northern Ireland and then back south into Ireland, sources have said. It then travelled from Dublin port to the UK overnight on 16 October, and crossed to mainland Europe that evening.\n\nThe trailer travelled to Dunkirk and Lille in France, and Bruges in Belgium. Dunkirk is a 40-minute drive from Calais and is a known site for people smugglers preying on migrants seeking to cross the Channel to the UK.\n\nThe data from the tracking device, which has been passed to Essex police investigating the deaths, also shows the trailer made a journey between the UK and mainland Europe on 22 October.\n\nVery few identification papers were found in the lorry, said Pasmore. He appealed for those who may know the victims \u2013 who were initially said to be Chinese \u2013 to come forward.\n\n\u201cIt may well be that there are people watching this tonight that are thinking \u2018I\u2019m here in the UK and I\u2019m here illegally and I want to come forward, I want to obviously try and identify my loved ones and be reunited,\u2019 but they are frightened to come forward,\u201d Pasmore said.\n\nHe explained he had met with a \u201cfacilitator\u201d of one of the websites run for the Vietnamese community to help build trust between it and the police, hoping to encourage people to \u201ctake that leap of faith\u201d and make contact with Essex police.", "description": "Mo Robinson, 25, has also been charged with human trafficking and money laundering", "authors": ["Rory Carroll"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/816632a45bfa59374fe8e493e58a907cf0b052e0/0_401_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=179f00707d3e7d213e77be9565413c03", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
