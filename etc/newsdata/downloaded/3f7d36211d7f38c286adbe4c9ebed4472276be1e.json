Next to it is Mike\u2019s old car.\n\nThe two speak in a flashback at the movie\u2019s beginning where Mike tells him he would head to Alaska if he were Jesse.\n\nIn case you don\u2019t recall, the El Camino Jesse drives at the movie\u2019s start used to belong to Todd.\n\ncaption Todd was one of the men who held Jesse hostage for months. source Netflix, AMC/Ursula Coyote\n\nBack on \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d Jesse wanted to own an El Camino of his own. When he goes to buy a car back on season two, he winds up going with the Toyota instead.\n\nNow that he\u2019s driving the car of his dreams, he can\u2019t even hold onto it. Not only does he have terrible memories of it, but the cops are after it.\n\nSkinny Pete tells Badger he thinks he got Cheeto dust stuck in an Xbox controller, which may be a nod to the way Walt saw Jesse and his friends.\n\ncaption Badger and Skinny Pete are playing video games at the movie\u2019s start before Jesse arrives. source Netflix\n\nOn season two, episode nine of \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d Walt calls Jesse up asking for him to acquire a list of objects. When Jesse tries to tell Walt he\u2019s busy, Walt tells him that smoking marijuana and eating Cheetos \u201cdon\u2019t constitute plans\u201d in his book.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of funny years later to see that\u2019s exactly what Pete and Badger are doing. When Jesse arrives to Skinny Pete\u2019s house, Badger asks him if he wants to smoke to take the edge off. Hank was also a fan of Cheetos on the show.\n\nJesse devours a Cup of Noodles at Skinny Pete\u2019s house.\n\ncaption It\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve seen ramen in the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d universe. source AMC, Netflix\n\nIt was one of Jesse\u2019s first meals he ate after escaping the compound where the white supremacists forced him to cook crystal meth for months.\n\nThe food choice could be a reference to season one, episode five (\u201cGray Matter\u201d) when Walt and Skyler went to a birthday party for Elliott Schwartz. At the celebration, the wealthy guests bought expensive gifts for Elliott, but Walt opted for the cheaper, sentimental route and gave him a single packet of ramen. It was a nod to the food they survived on while they were struggling grad students, long before Gray Matter Technologies was established.\n\nSaul Goodman\u2019s office is no longer part of the small plaza with local businesses.\n\ncaption It\u2019s been replaced by the Duke City Sports Bar. Duke City\u2019s a nickname for Albuquerque, where \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d takes place. source AMC, Netflix\n\nDuring a quick moment, the shopping mall area is quickly seen on screen and Goodman\u2019s legal office is nowhere to be found.\n\nThe crooked lawyer, played by Bob Odenkirk, never makes an appearance in \u201cEl Camino,\u201d but it alludes to what happened to him after the series finale. Of course, fans watching \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d spinoff, \u201cBetter Call Saul,\u201d know that Goodman is now working at a Cinnabon in a mall.\n\nLos Pollos Hermanos\u2019 Albuquerque location has been replaced by a restaurant named Twisters, which fans will recognize by name.\n\ncaption Twisters is an actual restaurant! source AMC/Netflix\n\nThe fast-food chain collapsed after Gus Fring\u2019s death at the end of season four.\n\nTwisters isn\u2019t any old restaurant. It\u2019s a real burgers and burritos restaurant that you can really visit that was used to film scenes on \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d\n\nA DEA agent refers to a machine gun that was used to kill a bunch of men.\n\ncaption The agent seems a bit baffled by how it was assembled. Of course, viewers know how it all went down if they watched the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d finale. source Netflix, Ursula Coyote/AMC\n\nHe\u2019s referring to the one that was custom built by Walter White to take out the white supremacists holding Jesse captive on the season five finale.\n\nWhen Jesse wakes up in Skinny Pete\u2019s house he originally freaks out when he looks up because he sees a cage door above him.\n\ncaption Jesse is haunted by visions of being trapped in his cell. source Netflix, AMC\n\nIt becomes clearer as the movie plays, but Jesse thought he was back in his cell where he was locked up for months instead of in a bedroom.\n\nOld Joe shows up early in the film. If the name doesn\u2019t ring a bell, he appeared on the show on seasons three and five.\n\ncaption Old Joe first appeared on season three, episode six of \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d \u201cSunset\u201d when he helped Jesse and Walt destroy their RV. Larry Hankin returns for \u201cEl Camino.\u201d source AMC\n\nJoe owned and operated the junkyard Walt and Jesse turned to in order to have the RV disposed of and to borrow a very large magnet to dispose of evidence.\n\nOld Joe brings up one of the show\u2019s most iconic moments when he yells out, \u201cMagnets!\u201d\n\ncaption \u201cMagnets!\u201d was a fan-favorite line on the show. The scene from the season five premiere shows Joe working with Walt, Mike, and Jesse. source Ursula Coyote/AMC, Kirsten Acuna/Insider composite\n\nOld Joe references the time Jesse suggested that they use the power of magnets to destroy Gus\u2019 laptop. The computer was locked in an evidence room and contained incriminating surveillance footage from the superlab. It was Jesse\u2019s idea to use magnets during season five, episode one (\u201cLive Free or Die\u201d) to scrub the laptop.\n\nIn \u201cEl Camino,\u201d Old Joe tells Jesse that he had \u201czero confidence\u201d in the plan at the time. Joe even yelled, \u201cMagnets,\u201d which was reminiscent of Jesse saying, \u201cYeah b\u2014-, magnets!\u201d on the show after a test run of the plan proved to be a success.\n\nRead more: The 15 best \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d quotes\n\nSkinny Pete gives Jesse his beanie to further help him fly under the radar.\n\ncaption Jesse used to wear beanies on earlier seasons as seen on the pilot episode above. source Netflix, AMC\n\nThis was a nod to the beanies that Jesse wore at the start of the series, back when his wardrobe was comprised of baggy pants, oversized T-shirts, and hoodies.\n\nWhen Todd lets Jesse out of the cage in the flashback scene, he warns Jesse not to step out of line or he\u2019ll have to visit \u201cthe little boy,\u201d referring to Brock Cantillo.\n\ncaption Brock and Andrea\u2019s photo hung in the place where Jesse cooked meth as a reminder for what he was working to protect. Walt poisoned him on season five. source AMC/Breaking Bad screencap/Netflix\n\nTodd previously shot Brock\u2019s mom, Andrea, during season five, episode 15 (\u201cGranite State\u201d) after Jesse tried to escape and stop cooking for the neo-Nazis.\n\nJesse drives by Holly avenue and Arroz road a few times in \u201cEl Camino.\u201d\n\ncaption Did you notice the significance of the street signs? source Netflix\n\nThe Spanish word \u201cArroz\u201d translates to \u201crice\u201d in English. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the street names are a nod to \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d writer and creator Vince Gilligan\u2019s girlfriend, Holly Rice. Holly avenue could also be a reference to Walt\u2019s daughter\u2019s name.\n\nJesse hears about a woman over the radio who will likely be another one of Walter White\u2019s victims.\n\ncaption Walt told Lydia he drugged her tea with ricin on the series finale of \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d source Ursula Coyote / AMC\n\nThe radio is referencing Lydia, who was poisoned by Walt. She\u2019s still alive in \u201cEl Camino,\u201d but the radio report says she\u2019s \u201cnot expected to survive.\u201d\n\nRead more: 12 \u2018Breaking Bad\u2019 stars who returned for Netflix\u2019s sequel movie \u2018El Camino\u2019\n\nJesse notices that Todd has a pet tarantula.\n\ncaption Jesse spots a familiar tarantula in Todd\u2019s apartment. source Netflix, AMC\n\nOn season five, episode five, Todd kills a boy on a motorbike after he finishes robbing a train with Walt, Jesse, and Mike. The kid found a tarantula in the desert at the episode\u2019s start to take home as a pet. Todd had swiped it off of him.\n\nIn \u201cEl Camino,\u201d we see Todd with the same tarantula in his apartment.\n\nTodd\u2019s salt and pepper shakers at his apartment are shaped like grenades.\n\ncaption It greatly contrasts the apartment\u2019s pastel-colored walls. source Netflix\n\nThe shakers stood out in the room. They\u2019re the only hint in the apartment that\u2019s full of almanacs and snow globes that something\u2019s off.\n\nThey seemed like they may be representative of how Todd could be a ticking time bomb. On the outside, he looked pretty well put together, but you never knew when he was going to explode and do something irrational like kill a young boy or his cleaning lady.\n\nJesse looks for Todd\u2019s money under a kitchen sink.\n\ncaption This was one of the more humorous callbacks to \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d source AMC/Netflix\n\nThat\u2019s where Jesse hid the meth in his home when Walt went searching for it on season two.\n\nIn a flashback scene, Todd strangled his cleaning lady, Sonia, to death with his belt. Todd was later strangled to death by Jesse.\n\ncaption Jesse may have wanted Todd to feel some of what Sonia felt. source Netflix, AMC\n\nIn the \u201cEl Camino\u201d flashback, Jesse was uncomfortable with Todd nonchalantly killing the innocent woman simply after she found his money stashed in an encyclopedia.\n\nA lot of focus was put on the fact that the woman appeared to be choked to death by Todd using his own belt. This could explain why Jesse used his shackles to strangle Todd during the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d series finale (\u201cFelina\u201d).\n\nJesse sees his parents on the news and they mentioned he was good at drawing.\n\ncaption Jesse goes through a bunch of his old drawings on season one. source Netflix/AMC\n\nWhen Jesse returns home on season one, he goes through some of his old drawings. It\u2019s one reason he\u2019s probably interested in Jane who also has an appetite for art.\n\nJesse drops $125,000 on Ed\u2019s counter when he sees him.\n\ncaption Jesse previously waited for Ed on season five, episode 11 (bottom image). source Netflix/AMC\n\nSaul Goodman told both Jesse and Walt that if they ever needed to escape and get out of town to call the number on a back of a card and say: \u201cI need a new dust filter for my Hoover MaxExtract PressurePro model 60 \u2013 can you help me with that?\u201d\n\nSaul and Walt both used his services effectively. You had to give the man on the other end of the phone, Ed, $125,000 in exchange for a new identity and he moved you discretely to a new location.\n\nIt didn\u2019t go as smoothly for Jesse who couldn\u2019t remember the exact words you had to say, but who did have the money on hand. He just wound up being charged twice by Ed. Jesse previously bailed on a trip with him on season five, episode 11 when he realized Walt lied to him.\n\nWhen Jesse calls his parents, he asks about Jake.\n\ncaption Jake is away on a school trip in London. The last time Jesse saw him was on season one, episode four. source AMC\n\nJake was his younger, seemingly perfect, brother, who could do no wrong in his parents\u2019 eyes. When Jesse visits him on the show\u2019s fourth episode, he was trying to hide the fact that he was smoking pot. Jesse took the blame for him.\n\nBrock and Andrea\u2019s photo can be distinctly seen late in the movie during a flashback.\n\ncaption Jesse had used the paperclip originally to try and escape. source Netflix\n\nJesse had that exact photo with him when he was in the cage, and used the paperclip to unlock his handcuffs and attempt to escape during season five, episode 15.\n\nJesse lets an insect crawl on his hand, which is a callback to the opening scene of a season two episode.\n\ncaption Jesse lets a bug crawl on him on season two and in the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d movie under very different circumstances. source AMC/Netflix\n\nAt the start of \u201cPeekaboo,\u201d Jesse spotted a bug on the ground and let it crawl onto his hand. After he let it go, Skinny Pete walked up to him and stomped on it.\n\nBugs have been prominent throughout the original series for Jesse and can be seen as possible allusions to certain deaths.\n\nTake a close look at the two sets of images and you\u2019ll notice the contrasting colors, emotions, and even the placement of Jesse show the changes in his character and how he went from a cheery, simple drug dealer to a scarred abuse victim and murderer.\n\nThe flashback of Walt and Jesse at Owl Cafe took place after the four-day cooking marathon from season two.\n\ncaption In case there\u2019s any confusion, this scene with Walt and Jesse takes place during season two. You can see the bullet holes in the RV as Walt looks at them. source Netflix\n\nIn the flashback, Jesse is seen taking a much-needed tub bath, talking to a girl on the phone (presumably Jane), and walking out of a hotel with Walt. Then, they go to the eatery, where Jesse piles food onto a plate. At the table, Walt begins to cough. You can also see their RV outside the eatery, with duct tape covering the bullet holes on the door.\n\nWalt talks to Jesse about his future and encourages him to go to college and pursue a business degree. The pair also discuss finding a buyer for the batches of crystal meth (valued at $1.3 million) that they cooked.\n\nThis flashback took place during season two, episode nine (\u201c4 Days Out\u201d), where Walt forced Jesse to go cook with him in the desert rather than spend the weekend with Jane. After a series of things that went wrong (from running out of water to having a dead car battery), Walt and Jesse were able to make their own battery and get the engine running again. At the end of the episode, Walt found out his cancer was in remission.\n\nWalt forgets that Jesse has his GED even though he was there at his graduation ceremony.\n\ncaption In a flashback, Walt and Jesse discuss his plans for the future. He says he\u2019s interested in sports medicine. source Netflix\n\nThis seemed important because it showed that Walt was really self-absorbed and was not a \u201cdetails-oriented\u201d man even back on season two.\n\nHe was only concerned with himself and the larger picture. When he spoke with Gus throughout the series and said they were the same, Gus told him that wasn\u2019t true because he wasn\u2019t a careful man. Walt\u2019s narcissism, pride, and inability to really listen to others were all part of his downfall.\n\nBryan Cranston didn\u2019t shave his head to return for the movie.\n\ncaption Cranston is wearing a bald cap. source Netflix\n\nIf you watch through the credits, it says Cranston was wearing a bald cap made by KNB and Greg Nicotero. That\u2019s the same team who do all of the zombie makeup for AMC\u2019s \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d\n\nWhen Jesse gets to Alaska, he drives off in a blue Toyota.\n\ncaption Jesse may not have wound up with the blue El Camino, but he did wind up with a blue car. source Netflix, AMC\n\nInstead of having a fancy car, Jesse goes back to his roots driving around a modest Toyota like he did earlier on \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d\n\nThe shade of blue of the car is reminiscent of a few things. It\u2019s the same color as the meth he and Walt made, which brought him to that moment. It\u2019s also similar to the color of the original El Camino Jesse considered buying on season two for $9,000 before turning it down.\n\nThe end of \u201cEl Camino\u201d includes a flashback of Jesse and Jane, which took place after the pair visited the Georgia O\u2019Keefe museum in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\ncaption The two visit the museum on season three, episode 11. source Netflix\n\nIn \u201cEl Camino,\u201d a scene is included that shows Jesse and Jane in a car together, similar to a moment seen in a flashback at the start of season three, episode 11. They talk about the philosophy of going where the universe takes you. Jane, who died during season two, tells Jesse that she let the universe guide her all her life, and it didn\u2019t work out too well.\n\nShe suggests that Jesse should forge his own path instead, which is exactly what he does at the very end of the movie.", "description": "Business Insider - Six years after the hit AMC series ended, Netflix released a film centered on Jesse Pinkman.
