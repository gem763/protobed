The two were accused of attacking four anti-fascist counter-protesters at an event at New York City\u2019s Metropolitan Club, where Gavin McInnes, the founder of the Proud Boys, was slated to speak.\n\nMore from Rolling Stone\n\nAlthough Hare and Kinsman argued during the trial that they had acted in self-defense, security camera footage first obtained by the New York Times appeared to contradict that claim, showing Hare and another Proud Boy, Geoffrey Young, initiating the violence by charging the protesters and throwing punches at them. They faced a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison, and apologized in court during sentencing for their involvement in the altercation.\n\nDuring sentencing, State Supreme Court justice Mark Dwyer condemned Hare and Kinsman for setting a dangerous precedent for other activists to engage in politically motivated street violence. \u201cI know enough about history to know what happened in Europe in the Thirties,\u201d he said. He also appeared to allude to McInnes\u2019 role in inciting the altercation, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame when some people jump up and down on a platform and their followers, their soldiers, get in trouble.\u201d\n\nThe Proud Boys is an all-male group that has been referred to by anti-extremism researcher Samantha Kutner as a \u201cviolent crypto-fascist-extremist organization.\u201d The organization has a history of engaging in violent rhetoric and physical altercations with members of antifa, a loosely organized collective of anti-fascist protesters. Current Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio marched in the 2017 Charlottesville Unite the Right rally, which resulted in violent altercations between the far-right and anti-fascist protesters, leaving one protester dead.\n\nThe Proud Boys has been characterized by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) as a hate group, citing its use of \u201cwhite nationalist memes,\u201d \u201caffiliations with known extremists,\u201d and \u201canti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric.\u201d McInnes has disputed this characterization, referring to the group as a \u201cmen\u2019s club that meets about once a month to drink beer\u201d and filing a defamation lawsuit against the SPLC earlier this year. The group has also long maintained that it only commits violent actions in self-defense, a claim refuted by a map Kutner has created tracking the number of violent altercations involving the Proud Boys across North America, which she tells Rolling Stone now exceeds 130 between 2016 and 2019.\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, Heidi Beirich, director of the Intelligence Project at SPLC, says she was happy that Kinsman and Hare had been \u201cheld accountable,\u201d and that Judge Dwyer had placed their actions in the appropriate context with his comments \u201cabout what street violence has led to in the past,\u201d indicating that the larger threat posed by the group is being taken seriously.\n\nThe trial has been \u201ca horrible embarrassment for [the Proud Boys], a group that claims to be peaceful and non-hateful regardless of all that\u2019s happened,\u201d she says. Dwyer\u2019s remarks at sentencing suggest \u201cthis is really just a bunch of street thugs.\u201d\n\nAlthough McInnes publicly stepped down as leader of the group last year, he still maintains an active presence on the encrypted messaging app Telegram, where he responded on Tuesday to Kinsman and Hare\u2019s sentencing. In his messages, he claimed that Hare and Kinsman had acted in self-defense after an \u201cambush\u201d and that they were being used as \u201ccannon fodder\u201d by the \u201celites.\u201d He also accused the media of perpetuating an anti-Proud Boys narrative, identifying six journalists who covered the trial and accusing them of having influenced the judge\u2019s sentences.\n\nMcInnes\u2019 attempt to push a \u201cvictimization narrative\u201d on Telegram, combined with his doxxing of journalists, is horrifying, insofar as it is obviously intended to spur \u201charassment and intimidation of those they feel are responsible for \u2018ruining\u2019 the men\u2019s lives,\u201d says Kutner.", "description": "The judge's remarks at sentencing indicate that despite its pretenses otherwise, the Proud Boys is \"really just a bunch of street thugs,\" says one researcher", "authors": ["Ej Dickson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/irbJ6rzPJcJ4B0x5sN.gLg--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/rollingstone.com/e305126e915aea6270cec4becfc9799b", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
