That\u2019s a bankrupt model - one that puts institutions ahead of the students they are supposed to serve,\u201d Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement, referring to schools and the NCAA.\n\nNewsom signed the bill during an appearance on the HBO program the \u201cThe Shop\u201d alongside the show\u2019s host, Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James, a vocal supporter of the measure.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so incredibly proud to share this moment with all of you,\u201d James, who bypassed college basketball and went straight from high school to the National Basketball Association, wrote on Twitter. \u201c@gavinnewsom came to The Shop to do something that will change the lives for countless athletes who deserve it!\u201d\n\nThe measure states that endorsement deals should not have any effect on student scholarships provided by colleges. It also permits student athletes to employ agents.\n\nThe measure could make California colleges more attractive to top recruits in high-revenue sports like football and basketball.\n\nThe bill\u2019s sponsors have said it also could encourage star players to stay in school rather than dropping out to turn professional.\n\nThe Indianapolis-based NCAA said the California law risks confusing current and future student athletes by creating different rules for colleges in different states.\n\n\u201cA patchwork of different laws from different states will make unattainable the goal of providing a fair and level playing field,\u201d the NCAA said in a statement.\n\nThe NCAA reported total revenues of more than $1 billion last year, about 80% of which came from television and marketing rights fees.\n\nThe Pac-12 Conference, whose member schools are located in Western states including California, said in a statement it is \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the move, expressing concern about \u201cmany unintended consequences related to this professionalism\u201d in college sports.\n\nFILE PHOTO: California's Governor Gavin Newsom speaks during the California Democratic Convention in San Francisco, California, U.S. June 1, 2019. REUTERS/Stephen Lam\n\nIn a call with reporters on Monday, Newsom seemed unconcerned that the NCAA might sue or ban California colleges from NCAA competition and said the measure aims to establish a new status quo by addressing a social-justice issue.\n\n\u201cThis is going to force a radical departure from the existing rules and regulations around the NCAA. They\u2019re either going to be rolled over by it, public opinion and other states\u2019 rules, or they\u2019re going to have to wake up and lead,\u201d Newsom said.\n\nNew York, Colorado and South Carolina are considering similar legislation to follow in California\u2019s footsteps.", "description": "California cleared the way on Monday for college athletes to profit from brand sponsorships and endorsement deals, as Governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation making it the first U.S. state to give them that potentially lucrative opportunity.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435683330&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T1AU", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
