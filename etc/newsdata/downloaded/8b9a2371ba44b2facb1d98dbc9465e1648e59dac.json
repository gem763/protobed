Rafael Reif is facing down his own illustrious institution and alumni as current and former students call for him to step down.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, Reif revealed that senior MIT administration members knew that the Media Lab had accepted money from Epstein\u2019s foundation as recently as 2017.\n\nReif also disclosed that MIT\u2019s own investigation surfaced a 2012 thank-you letter to Epstein bearing Reif\u2019s own signature. The note thanked Epstein for a gift to MIT Physics Professor Seth Lloyd.\n\nIn his statement, Reif described the gift as the first\u2014\u201cas far as we know now\u201d\u2014that MIT accepted following the billionaire pedophile\u2019s 2008 conviction for procurement of minors for prostitution. \u201cAlthough I do not recall it, it does bear my signature,\u201d Reif wrote.\n\nCalls for the MIT president\u2019s resignation bubbled up less than 24 hours after Reif came clean about the administration\u2019s involvement with Epstein.\n\nIn an MIT women\u2019s alumni Facebook group, former students expressed outrage at the news, asking the group\u2019s administrators where they should direct their demands for Reif\u2019s resignation. The group\u2019s administrators directed the members to write to MIT Corporation, the research university\u2019s board of trustees.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, current students and alumni held a protest event called \u201cThey Knew: Speak-out against MIT-Epstein Scandal.\u201d At the time of writing, almost 100 people had RSVP\u2019d to the event, held at MIT\u2019s Stratton Student Center.\n\n\u201cAccepting money linked to Jeffrey Epstein wasn\u2019t just disgusting and immoral,\u201d the group\u2019s organizers wrote. \u201cIt violated MIT\u2019s own donor policies. Any senior administrators who knew about these donations MUST RESIGN IMMEDIATELY.\u201d\n\nThe event\u2019s speakers included MIT alum and Cambridge City Council member Quinton Zondervan and MIT Media Lab Research Assistant Arwa Michelle Mboya.\n\nAnother speaker calling for Reif\u2019s resignation drew a surprising comparison, likening the venerated research university\u2019s enlightened public image\u2014versus its shady behind-the-scenes dealings\u2014to the NFL.", "description": "One speaker at a protest event calling for Reif's resignation likened MIT's behavior to the NFL.", "authors": ["Taylor Hatmaker", "Senior Technology Editor"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568410155/190913-hatmaker-Rafael-Reif-tease_ie7vg2", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
