Led by captain Owen Farrell, the full 23-man squad walked purposefully into a V formation to take on the All Blacks' challenge as TJ Perenara began the war dance.\n\nIt set the tone for a stunning performance in Yokohama, with England needing just 98 seconds to score the first try through Manu Tuilagi.\n\nEngland formed a V formation in acceptance of New Zealand's pre-match Haka routine\n\nThe team were watched very carefully by the officials as they carried out their response\n\nThere was initial confusion, with Joe Marler initially thinking he was meant to walk round to the 10 metre line, but referee Nigel Owens and his assistants were quick to usher the players back beyond halfway.\n\nThe plot was hatched by Eddie Jones a couple of days before the game. Owen Farrell then asked the players if they wanted to do it, and they all agreed.\n\nAfter the epic match, here is what the English players said about their newly-iconic manoeuvre.\n\nEngland captain Owen Farrell stares down the Haka as his players face up to the famous dance\n\nOwen Farrell, England captain, said: 'We knew we had to be within a radius. We wanted to not just stand there and let them come at us. We wanted to keep a respectful distance, but we didn't want to just stand in a flat line.'\n\nMako Vunipola, England prop, said: 'Eddie gave us the idea. We wanted to be respectful but we wanted to also make sure that they understood that we would be ready for the fight.\n\n'Joe Marler said he got confused. He thought he was supposed to go all the way around them (in a circle) and go to their 10 metre line! Because of that, he's the one who has to pay the fine. He dishes it out a lot so the boys would be more than happy if he has to pay it!\n\n'We put accountability on ourselves to back it up and I thought we did.\n\n'We knew it would rile them up, it probably felt like we disrespected them. We meant no offence by it, we just wanted to let them know that we were ready for the challenge ahead. And they let us know in the first couple of contacts. It was a ferocious contest, which is what you expect. I'm just very proud and happy for the boys.'\n\nBilly Vunipola is told to step further away from New Zealand's performance ahead of the match\n\nAaron Smith, New Zealand scrum-half, said: 'We don't really do it to scare them. We do it for us, to represent our people, to represent New Zealand. The All Blacks have been doing it for 110 years.\n\n'I was looking at the guy straight opposite me and that was Owen Farrell. He was giving me a few winks.'\n\nNew Zealand carry out their famous war dance as they attempt to intimidate Eddie Jones' men\n\nBilly Vunipola, England No 8: 'It was just about trying to shock them. We talked about it all week. Maro said it, everyone said it, we wanted to shock them with our first 20 minutes because that's when they begin their process of wearing teams down. We didn't want to be one of those teams.\n\n'The Haka is a challenge and we wanted them to know that we accepted and respected the challenge, but also that we didn't want to just take it. That was the thought behind.'\n\nWithin 98 seconds of the match starting, England had scored a try and did not led the lead go\n\nTom Curry, England flanker: 'We just wanted to come at them early doors. That's the first bit of the game so it's about trying to set a standard early. They can't score tries off the Haka. It worked, so we're happy.\n\n'I kind of felt it made them more up for it. As soon as we started moving towards them they seemed to accept the challenge. I thought it was good.\n\n'We went in there knowing we weren't going to take a backward step. We wanted to show that from the outset. That's the first moment you get in front of them so it was important to show we weren't taking a backward step.'", "description": "WILL KELLEHER AT THE YOKOHOMA STADIUM: England set the platform for their historic Rugby World Cup semi-final victory over New Zealand with a striking response to the All Blacks ' Haka.", "authors": ["Will Kelleher For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/17/20220354-0-image-a-7_1572106909299.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
