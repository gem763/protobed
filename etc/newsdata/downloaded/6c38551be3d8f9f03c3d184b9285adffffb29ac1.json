Many would argue that in the 22 months in that position, she has not lived up to the role.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to know what coalition could now form. The opposition parties united to oust her, but that is about the only thing they agree on. They are diverse and many have aspirations of leadership themselves. There\u2019s not an obvious majority coalition that can form.\"", "description": "Romania's government has collapsed following a no-confidence vote - only weeks ahead of a Presidential election.\n\nIt follows claims of corruption and protests against what many viewed as the administration of Prime Minister Viorica D\u0103ncil\u0103\u2019s attacks on the rule of law.", "authors": ["John Paul Ging"], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/22/25/02/1000x563_cmsv2_b144c3b2-3f46-56dd-884c-b98fd676a6d5-4222502.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
