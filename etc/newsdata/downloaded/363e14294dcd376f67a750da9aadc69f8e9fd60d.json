There are also new spaceship fights, and a promise that fans will get a deeper look at bounty hunting \u2014 a \u201cdifficult profession.\u201d The time for peace has come to an end.\n\nSet in between Star Wars: Episode VI \u2014 Return of the Jedi and the rise of the First Order in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the show follows a new character played by Pedro Pascal (Game of Thrones). Pascal described him as \u201ca mysterious lone gunfighter in the outer reaches of the galaxy,\u201d during a panel for The Mandalorian at this year\u2019s Star Wars Celebration in April. The series is heavily inspired by fan-favorite character Boba Fett and his father, Jango.\n\nExecutive producer Jon Favreau previously told The Hollywood Reporter that the goal is to showcase a \u201cdarker, freakier side of Star Wars.\u201d The first trailer for the series took on a Mad Max tone, with helmets on stakes, and ominous shots of people in the desert. Still, the trailer certainly leaned into more traditional Star Wars action, including scenes featuring fighting spaceships, battling droids, and face-to-face confrontations.\n\nThe Mandalorian is one of Disney+\u2019s most ambitious projects, with the series costing \u201caround $100 million\u201d to make, according to Disney CEO Bob Iger. That puts each episode at approximately $12.5 million, on par with some of Game of Thrones\u2019 final episodes. It will be released weekly, with the final episodes being released in conjunction with Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker in December.\n\nThe Mandalorian will premiere on November 12th, when Disney+ launches. Disney+ costs $6.99 a month. A bundle with sports streaming service ESPN+ and ad-supported Hulu is also available.", "description": "A new trailer for Disney\u2019s first ever live-action Star Wars show, The Mandalorian, has arrived, just a couple of weeks ahead of Disney+\u2019s highly anticipated launch.
