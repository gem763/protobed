Other respondents reported how white students glamorised the use of the n-word, using it as a greeting. The report, by the race equality specialist Sofia Akel, warned this put black students in particular \u201cat risk of entering racially charged environments and subject to immense discomfort\u201d.\n\n'A demeaning environment': stories of racism in UK universities Read more\n\nAn additional 43% of the 195 students surveyed said they had experienced everyday racialised microaggressions, such as white students and staff questioning their nationality due to being a person of colour.\n\nNearly two-fifths (37%) of respondents said they felt excluded from participating in university life due to racial discrimination, and more than a third reported that they had modified their ethnic or cultural identify, such as adopting a \u201cwhite voice\u201d or using a different name, in an attempt to avoid being targeted.\n\nMany respondents described a \u201cracial battleground\u201d in lectures, with their white peers\u2019 racism going unchallenged by white lecturers, who would also dismiss or suppress the voices of BME students and make racist assumptions about their knowledge and academic abilities.\n\nThe report connected this to BME students receiving poorer degree grades than their white peers, noting that almost half (49%) of respondents felt that Goldsmiths\u2019 curriculums did not represent the lives and achievements of BME people.\n\nThe study also highlighted Islamophobia on campus, with several female Muslim students reporting being afraid to wear their veil due to fear of reprisals for being wrongly perceived as extremists.\n\nMore than three-quarters (79%) of those surveyed said they did not know where to report a hate crime at Goldsmiths. Many lacked confidence in its complaints procedures, with only a third saying they trusted the university to handle reports of racism appropriately.\n\nProf Elisabeth Hill, Goldsmiths\u2019 deputy warden, said: \u201cThese findings are simply unacceptable and paint a clear picture, which cannot be ignored. This report demands a response from everyone at Goldsmiths and illustrates the amount of work we must all undertake to address these vital matters.\u201d\n\nShe said work was underway to meet the recommendations of the report, which included mandatory race-awareness training for staff, a review of complaints procedures and improving the number of BME senior managers.\n\nThe report follows an occupation at the university by Goldsmiths Anti-Racist Action protesters, which ended in July after senior managers agreed to meet their demand for a series of measures to tackle institutional racism at Goldsmiths.\n\nGoldsmiths has previously appointed Dr Nicola Rollock to address the BME attainment gap at the university. She said: \u201cWhat\u2019s really striking about this report is that BME students are coming to an institution that looks mixed and edgy and radical but they are having to negotiate, fight and strategise every step of the way to deal with racism. This is not just happening in their dealings with white students but with white lecturers too. This report is damning but I\u2019m struck by the preparedness of senior managers to acknowledge they\u2019re not getting it right.\u201d", "description": "Quarter of black and minority ethnic students surveyed say they have faced racism from white staff or peers", "authors": ["David Batty"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/117a9050bf5363417d6b382ee386446a78957c5a/0_23_4780_2868/master/4780.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=44a5ca7b291cd6567eb0c6a89d5a022f", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
