He\u2019s so amazing.\u2019\n\n\u2018He\u2019s like a puppy to be honest. He\u2019s starting his life over from the beginning again.\u2019\n\nAlthough Merlin, who vets believe is four, now has a happy home, he still hasn\u2019t fully recovered from the abuse and has sessions with a trainer to deal with fear aggression.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKim, who lives on a farm with nine cats, seven horses and second dog, says that when Merlin first met her son Sam, 23, he would bark or run away as soon as he walked into the room.\n\nKim says Merlin is like a \u2018puppy who is just beginning his life again\u2019 (Picture: Kim Wise)\n\nThey suspect his abuser may have been a man of a similar age.\n\nShe said: \u2018He just couldn\u2019t take to him at all. He really struggled with him.\n\n\u2018And we feel that it was a person of a similar age that might have hurt him.\u2019\n\n\u2018Sam had to help him confront the issue by just quietly not letting him run away.\n\n\u2018And then he realized that he wasn\u2019t going to do anything.\u2019\n\nStuart Neve, who runs Compassion Animaux Bretagne in Central Brittany with his wife Maria, says that when they first found Merlin, it took an hour and a half for a pet whisperer to approach him because he was so scared.\n\nHe said: \u2019He was terrified, very very timid.\n\n\u2018He had to be constantly kept on a lead to make sure he couldn\u2019t get out.\n\nMerlin has sessions with a dog trainer to help with his trauma (Picture: Stuart Neve)\n\n\u2018All he wanted to do was run off. You couldn\u2019t get near him at all to stroke him at all.\n\n\u2018The first thing we wanted to do was give him a big hug, but we couldn\u2019t.\u2019\n\nMaria and Stuart, who are from Cheshire, take in abandoned animals who are seen as having \u2018no hope\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThey are currently taking care of a ten-year-old Labrador with terminal cancer who has months to live and another dog they rescued from a refuge who was starving himself after his dog friend passed away.\n\nSpeaking about Merlin, Maria said: \u2018People were saying \u2018look at him, no one\u2019s going to adopt that dog, he\u2019s got no tail, you can see all the scars\u2019.\n\n\u2018You can still see all the scars on him and he\u2019s the most beautiful dog.\u2019\n\nCompassion Animaux Bretagne receives no funding for vets bills and the couple are not paid for their hard work.\n\nConsider adopting one of their animals into a loving home, or donating to support their mission here.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
