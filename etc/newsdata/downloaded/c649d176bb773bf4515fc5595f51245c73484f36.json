Trump has acknowledged he held back the aid, but denies doing anything improper. On Tuesday, he said he was concerned the United States was contributing more to Ukraine than European countries. He has previously said he was worried about corruption in Ukraine.\n\nIn surveys of registered voters since the start of August, Trump has trailed Biden by 14 percentage points in a Fox News poll, by 15 points in a Washington Post-ABC poll, by 12 points in an Investor\u2019s Business Daily/TIPP poll and by 16 points in a Quinnipiac University poll.\n\nWhen matched against four other Democratic candidates \u2014 Sen. Warren Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Sen Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg \u2014 Trump did not have an advantage against any of them. At best he trailed within the range of sampling error.\n\nRecent polling has also shown Trump without a clear lead against top Democrats in several of the mostly closely contested states in 2016.\n\nIn Michigan, for instance, an EPIC-MRA poll in August asked whether registered voters would support Trump against four different Democratic candidates.\n\nTrump trailed Biden by 10 points, a statistically significant edge. Warren and Sanders held slight edges over Trump of 4 points and 5 points, respectively, while Harris had a 3-point lead, which was within the margin of error.\n\nIn Wisconsin, a Marquette Law School poll in August found Trump tied or behind Biden, Sanders, Warren and Harris among registered voters. Biden led Trump by 9 points; Sanders had a slight 4-point edge, while Warren and Harris were tied with Trump.", "description": "Recent national polling has shown the president trailing the top Democratic 2020 White House hopefuls.", "authors": ["John Wagner", "National Reporter Leading The Post'S Breaking Political News Team", "Scott Clement", "Polling Director"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/KxT8JwDflHpQP7z52nZe7qe9iQk=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZDSTV3G63UI6TDOIJGHKXQJJUA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
