Letters may be edited.\n\nWhen Your Crappy Job Is Not the Real Problem\n\nI\u2019m a litigation attorney and am absolutely miserable. Recently, I went on a dream vacation abroad with a friend for a week, but concerns about work plagued me just about every day. I woke up from nightmares about work several times and felt incredibly guilty about not billing enough time. When I returned from vacation, I intended to take an additional day off to recover from jet lag, but I woke up from another work nightmare and went to the office despite feeling exhausted. I feel like I can\u2019t escape my job. It\u2019s all I think about as I try to fall asleep. I wake up well before my alarm most days because I\u2019m worried about work. I\u2019ll cut activities with friends short because I start to worry that I need to get more work done. I also find myself becoming the buzzkill, as I regularly end up discussing my unhappiness with work. There are parts of the job that I love, and I\u2019ve produced some great work. But I spend most of my days on tasks that I hate. I think it\u2019s time to either find a new job that\u2019s a better fit or get out of the legal profession entirely. The problem I\u2019m facing is that I\u2019m at my third firm in a bit over two years and have only been here for about three months, which I\u2019m afraid will throw up major red flags to prospective employers. I\u2019m trying to decide if I should just tough it out for a while longer, start applying for new positions, or quit and take the time to recover from this career and reinvent myself for something new. \u2014 Dallas\n\nKnowing I was nearing the end of my tenure as your Work Friend, an IRL friend recently asked me if the gig had made me think differently about work. I told her that I had decided there were only four types of work problems:\n\nMy boss annoys me.\n\nMy co-workers (usually millennials) annoy me.\n\nI am dissatisfied with the type of work I do and/or don\u2019t know what to do next.\n\nI don\u2019t actually have serious work problems but am anxious about that.\n\nNumbers 1 and 2 can be tricky to solve, but the stakes are never as high as you think. If you are frequently in rooms where you like absolutely everyone, congrats, I guess, but functioning in the real world requires dealing with a lot of very annoying people! That\u2019s not to say you just have to get over a boss who clips his nails or eminent-domains your work, but, buddy, the world does not need your four paragraphs of flowery prose about the exact ways in which he sucks. Most people suck. (Fun fact: Millennials do not suck more than most.) You can deal with them or quit and go looking for a place where a smaller minority of them do, but bear in mind that you might suck, too, so don\u2019t assume that working for yourself will be any better.\n\nNumbers 3 and 4 are the sticky ones, because fundamentally they\u2019re about your psychology. Jobs aren\u2019t sentient, which means you can\u2019t talk any sense into them, which means the only good way to solve problems is by talking some sense into yourself regardless of whose fault they are. I do believe that most work problems (and nonwork problems) would be mostly solved if every man would sign up for therapy, but men tend to react quite poorly when you tell them that. :(\n\nSo, Dallas. Your tough situation has led you to misidentify your actual problem, which has nothing to do with how prospective employers see your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and is in fact about your relationship with your work more generally. You don\u2019t say why you left those other two jobs, but I\u2019m going to take a wild guess that this is not the first time you\u2019ve felt serious anxiety about work. While I love my current job, I recognized far too much of myself in your letter. I have stress dreams about work all the time! My spouse and I have each ruined our share of fun activities by fixating on our jobs! Whether sitting at my desk or having drinks with friends, I frequently have flashes of realizing if I don\u2019t do this particular task right this instant I will never achieve anything in life! Because I very recently started a new job after a tumultuous exit from my old job that has left me worried about my former colleagues, I\u2019ve spent the last two months having anxiety about both the old job and the new job!", "description": "TBH it\u2019s pretty rude that your work causes you endless stress and never even goes to couples\u2019 therapy with you.", "authors": ["Megan Greenwell"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/business/24WORKFRIEND-01/22WORKFRIEND-01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
