That\u2019s why one ride-share driver did not see her attacker coming.\n\nThe 40-year-old woman told FOX40 she was driving a Lyft passenger to his Motel 6 in Tracy Tuesday when she says the man opened her car door and forcibly pulled her out.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know if he was armed, dangerous or, you know, what was going to happen,\u201d she said Thursday.\n\nThe man allegedly dragged her to his motel room and locked her inside.\n\nThe Lyft driver says the man then reached for his belt buckle.\n\n\u201cHe took his hand and he jammed my face into his groin,\u201d the woman said.\n\nThe assault happening within minutes -- but she said the seconds felt like hours.\n\nShe waited for the man to fall asleep before making her escape.\n\nShortly after the attack, the woman notified her friend and fellow Lyft driver about what had happened.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary. It\u2019s not right. Thank God she\u2019s alive,\u201d he said.\n\nHe recalled the moments he found her and called 911.\n\n\u201cShe looked very disheveled. She looked very altered,\u201d the friend said. \u201cShe was very lethargic. She was not alert to place. And I was quite concerned of her medical condition, as well as the fact that I believed that a sexual assault had occurred.\u201d\n\nTracy police arrested the suspect, now identified as 35-year-old Emmanuel Moreles, at the motel. He\u2019s now facing felony charges of kidnapping and oral copulation in the San Joaquin County Jail.\n\nFor his alleged victim, the nightmare is far from over.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the shakes, I\u2019ve got the tremors. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s getting in the car,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said the attack left her traumatized and she wishes her employer did more to keep her safe.\n\n\u201cI want the company to learn it\u2019s not just the riders they need to protect, it\u2019s also their drivers,\u201d the driver said. \u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m still alive but, you know, I could be six feet under right now.\u201d\n\nFOX40 reached out to Lyft about the incident and the company issued the following statement:\n\nSafety is fundamental to Lyft. What the driver described is disturbing, and the rider\u2019s access to Lyft has been permanently removed. We responded immediately and have continued outreach to the driver since the incident. We stand ready to assist authorities and will continue to help in every way we can.\n\nBut what the Lyft drivers said they really want is more protection and better screening so that dangerous passengers cannot harm another person behind the wheel.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is safety. There\u2019s nothing vetting any of these people that are getting in the back of these vehicles,\u201d the victim\u2019s friend told FOX40. \u201cIt just frightens me.\"", "description": "TRACY -- It\u2019s a job that\u2019s supposed to be safe.
