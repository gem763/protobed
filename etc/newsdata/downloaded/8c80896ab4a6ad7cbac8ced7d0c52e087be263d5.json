These include memoirs such as Howard Cunnell\u2019s moving account of his daughter\u2019s gender dysmorphia and reassignment, Fathers and Sons; and Thomas Page McBee\u2019s The Amateur, which recounts the author\u2019s preparations for a boxing bout against a cis male after transitioning. Several recent debut novels, including Garth Greenwell\u2019s What Belongs To You, Daniel Magariel\u2019s One of the Boys and Matthew Sperling\u2019s Astroturf, have also explored this terrain. The perniciousness of masculinist ideology is a recurring theme in Edouard Louis\u2019s fiction \u2013 The End of Eddy, History of Violence and Who Killed My Father \u2013 and is also at the centre of Ben Lerner\u2019s forthcoming third novel, The Topeka School.\n\nJJ Bola\u2019s contribution is unusual in that it is explicitly aimed at younger people. Before becoming a writer \u2013 he has three poetry collections and a novel, 2017\u2019s No Place to Call Home, to his name \u2013 Bola spent many years as a youth worker helping young people with behavioural and mental health problems, so he knows a thing or two about the feelings of insecurity and low self-esteem experienced by many young men today. While self-help gurus of the Jordan Peterson type nudge their readers towards the consolations of chauvinism \u2013 and, in so doing, fuel a grievance culture \u2013 Bola insists the only solution is to dismantle the entire concept of maleness as we have hitherto known it and replace it with \u201ca masculinity that sees the necessity of the equality of genders for it to not only survive, but to thrive\u201d.\n\nHe is under no illusions about the scale of this task, which will require \u201ca collective cultural and social transformation and shift in consciousness\u201d. To this end Mask Off seeks to bridge the gap between two constituencies: the scholarly and activist milieux, which have their own established vernacular of critique and dissent; and the wider community of uninitiated younger readers who, while potentially sympathetic to feminist politics, may find some of its terms of reference opaque or intimidating. This slim primer is part of a new Pluto series called Outspoken, which the publisher describes as comprising \u201cpunchy political books for young people\u201d. Bola introduces the reader to concepts such as slut-shaming, male privilege, emotional labour, victim-blaming and intersectionality.\n\nMask Off is interspersed with pertinent autobiographical vignettes. Bola was a basketball player in his youth, competing in national-level tournaments before a bout of severe depression put paid to his ambitions. In recent years a number of high-profile athletes have spoken openly about their mental health struggles, something which would have been almost unthinkable barely a decade ago. The \u201cmask\u201d of the book\u2019s title refers to the pretence of brutish insentience men are conditioned to adopting from an early age. Shedding this facade made Bola happier in himself: \u201cI even sneak a cheeky cry while chopping onions to cook, so I can get all my cries out at once.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Mask Off: Masculinity Redefined is published by Pluto (\u00a39.99).
