A pair of pants or boots can save your life.\n\nWhile snakes aren't breeding at a higher rate, Mr Reynolds says the increased number of encounters may give that appearance (stock image)\n\n\u2018Snakes will always defend themselves if they are scared.\n\n\u2018If you're in the area and you do find a snake stay very still or if people are too scared to stay still- slowly back away moving one leg after the other,' he said.\n\nPeople are urged to always call a snake catcher as attacks can occur if when those without experience try to remove the animal themselves.\n\nIn 2018, 270 snake bites were recorded by the Victorian Poisons Information Centre.\n\nSnakes are protected by law throughout Australia and those who kill or harm them can be prosecuted under the Nature Conservation Act 2014.", "description": "Toowoomba-based snake catcher Alex Reynolds told Daily Mail Australia that as breeding season comes to end in mid-October, male\u00a0snakes will be on the move to get their final-fix.", "authors": ["Tita Smith For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/08/19647902-0-image-a-3_1570951193137.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
