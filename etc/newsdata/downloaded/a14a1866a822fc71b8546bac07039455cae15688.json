Over two dozen businesses and financial institutions have announced tentative support for the project, which Facebook believes will streamline payments and serve \u201cunbanked\u201d communities.\n\nThe Bank of England has previously expressed concern about Libra but supports the idea of a digital currency, arguing that a network of sovereign \u201ccentral bank digital currencies\u201d could offset the dominance of the dollar. Reuters revealed last month, meanwhile, that Facebook met with UK officials three times prior to Libra\u2019s announcement in June.\n\nFacebook\u2019s Zuckerberg to testify before Congress on Libra\n\nIn expanded guidelines, the Bank of England warned that Facebook would have to share responsibility for the digital currency with its counterparts, some of which are already reconsidering their involvement, or have already left, such as payment processing giant PayPal.\n\n\u201cThe resilience of the proposed Libra system would rely on the stability of not just the core elements of the Libra Association and Libra Reserve but also the associated critical activities conducted by other firms in the Libra ecosystem such as validators, exchanges or wallet providers,\u201d the committee said. \u201cThis emphasised the need to ensure end-to-end resilience.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, officials in the United States have been far less welcoming of the proposed currency. Congressmen earlier this week called on several of Facebook\u2019s high profile partners to abandon the project, and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is due to testify before the House Financial Services Committee later this month.\n\n\n\n", "description": "The Bank of England has issued rules of engagement ensuring that the launch of Facebook\u2019s \u201cLibra\u201d currency doesn\u2019t take the economy by surprise.", "authors": ["Ben Munster"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/5ScN4baKy5K4ZTmtpcblbg--~B/aD00NzA7dz05MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/decrypt_251/da094f1f90c0eb4fe7d82933562bc655", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
