Save me the time. I will win but it will take a ton of time,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cDon\u2019t fuck with our timing. We give you nice things. Leave them as they were intended to be seen.\u201d\n\nNo @Netflix no. Don\u2019t make me have to call every director and show creator on Earth to fight you on this. Save me the time. I will win but it will take a ton of time. Don\u2019t fuck with our timing. We give you nice things.

Why support & finance filmmakers visions on one hand and then work to destroy the presentation of those films on the other??? https://t.co/T7QdYAQGHU \u2014 Brad Bird (@BradBirdA113) October 28, 2019\n\nAnt-Man director Peyton Reed also voiced his displeasure, calling the new feature a \u201cterrible idea.\u201d\n\nDear @Netflix, This is a terrible idea, and I and every director I know will fight against it. Sincerely, Peyton Reed https://t.co/iPq10ywKfz \u2014 Peyton Reed (@MrPeytonReed) October 28, 2019\n\nBreaking Bad actor Aaron Paul said the new functionality would allow Netflix to take control \u201cof everyone else\u2019s art and [destroy] it. Netflix is far better than that. Am I right Netflix?\u201d\n\nStop. As the person talked about in this article I felt the need to speak out. There is NO WAY @netflix will move forward with this. That would mean they are completely taking control of everyone else\u2019s art and destroying it. Netflix is far better than that. Am I right Netflix?\ud83c\udfa5 https://t.co/fZDnYzvStN \u2014 Aaron Paul (@aaronpaul_8) October 28, 2019\n\nThe actor later added: \u201cI love Netflix. Always have. Always will. This simply can not be true. That is all. No way will they destroy the art they have on their platform. Plain and simple.\u201d\n\nI am honestly praising @Netflix as a company. Don\u2019t listen to the media. Rumors are a funny thing. I love Netflix. Always have. Always will. This simply can not be true. That is all. No way will they destroy the art they have on their platform. Plain and simple. \ud83c\udfa5 https://t.co/uvxWMpeqhx \u2014 Aaron Paul (@aaronpaul_8) October 28, 2019\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg. Have a tip?
