Even in the closest contest of the three-game set, things still looked lopsided in the Yankees\u2019 favor.\n\nThe Bombers held up their end of the potential slugfest, but their pitching stifled the power of a team that crushed a record 307 homers in the regular season. Minnesota was limited to four solo shots in the series and left nine runners on base in Game 3.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nNew York pitching compiled 33 strikeouts in the three games, limiting the Twins to just seven runs. Minnesota\u2019s 15 years without a postseason win represents the longest current streak in baseball.\n\nLuis Severino got the start after rotator cuff inflammation and a Grade 2 lat strain limited him to just three appearances in the regular season. The 25-year-old right-hander completed four scoreless innings on 83 pitches, allowing four hits and two walks while striking out four.\n\nTommy Kahnle and Chad Green combined for two scoreless innings in relief for New York. Zack Britton walked off with a reported ankle injury after allowing a lead-off homer to Eddie Rosario in the eighth inning.\n\nAroldis Chapman recorded a five-out save to secure the win for New York. It was the first time Chapman went 1.2 innings to log a save since Game 5 of the 2017 ALDS against the Cleveland Indians.\n\nGleyber Torres\u2019s 376-foot solo shot \u2014 complete with an umpire review to make sure the Yankees weren\u2019t the beneficiaries of another Jeffrey Maier-type situation \u2014 opened the scoring in the second inning Monday. He was the youngest Yankee to go deep in the postseason since that Derek Jeter homer 23 years ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt was the first homer and fourth RBI of the postseason for the 22-year-old superstar, who went deep 38 times this summer. He also doubled twice, scored on Didi Gregorius\u2019 seventh- and ninth-inning base hits and saved a run on an excellent sliding stop in the fifth.\n\nCameron Maybin added a late solo shot off Sergio Romo in the ninth inning.\n\nGleyber Torres contributed three extra base hits, an RBI and a run in the Yankees clincher on Monday.

Cave unsuccessfully dove for an Urshela sinking liner in left, misplaying a base hit into a double. Gardner slapped a two-out, two-strike chopper to the right of the third baseman Miguel Sano -- a spot that was vacated seconds before the pitch -- for his third RBI of the postseason.\n\nAaron Judge: The 6-foot-6 right fielder\u2019s defense helped to keep the Twins off the board in a few key moments. No spot was bigger than his leaping catch on Sano\u2019s liner in the sixth which would have easily scored Luis Arraez from second. He also held Jake Cave to a single on a bullet off the wall with an excellent throw into the infield.\n\nJake Odorizzi: It\u2019s not easy to hold this Yankees team to just three runs. New York made quick work of the Twins\u2019 starters in the series\u2019 first two games, but Odorizzi worked five solid innings Saturday, yielding a pair of runs on five hits with five punchouts. Minnesota skipper Rocco Baldelli saved Odorizzi for Game 3 at Target Field. That side of the game all went according to plan, but Minnesota\u2019s offense didn\u2019t do their part.\n\nMUST-SEE MOMENT\n\nSeverino looked like he was working with all the rust of a pitcher who was making his fourth start of the year in October. He didn\u2019t display great command but his night was defined by his ability to keep the train on the tracks and get big outs in big moments.\n\nThe Twins squandered an early opportunity in the second inning. Minnesota had the bases loaded with nobody out, but Severino got Sano to pop out on the infield and whiffed Marwin Gonzalez and Cave to get out of the inning without yielding a run. Severino again stranded a pair of runners with a strikeout of Mitch Garver in the third.\n\nIn addition to his two RBI singles, Gregorius made a diving catch on a Jorge Polanco liner with two runners on in the ninth inning.\n\nDidi wanted that champagne!pic.twitter.com/fzMZPEBL5z \u2014 Yahoo Sports MLB (@MLByahoosports) October 8, 2019\n\nWHAT THEY\u2019LL BE TALKING ABOUT\n\nForecasting the Yankees next opponent, the question arises about whether they\u2019ll be able to dominate the Houston Astros or Tampa Bay Rays the way they did the Twins. The Yankees were 12-7 against the AL East rival Rays in the regular season, and 3-4 in the series against Houston. Justin Verlander and Gerrit Cole present a challenge on a very different level from what the Yankees saw in the past three games.\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT\n\nThe Yankees await the winner of the series between the Astros and Rays. Tampa Bay fought off a sweep with a 10-3 win against Zack Greinke at Tropicana Field on Monday afternoon.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The New York Yankees defeated the Minnesota Twins, 5-1, on Monday night at Target Field to complete a sweep of the American League Division Series.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SbscVSTYK9PynIitRxjR1w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XvXJEmrHJ04Ay82FYcpRQQ--~B/aD0yMDgxO3c9MzEyMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/9d76c390-e981-11e9-bfbb-9611c6a3bcd9", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
