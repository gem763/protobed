It's not confined to one,\" Dr Julia Chisholm, a children's cancer consultant at the Royal Marsden Hospital, told the BBC.\n\nNTRK mutations are relatively rare, but other targeted therapies are in development.\n\n'Kinder treatments'\n\nIt marks a move away from treating a \"breast cancer\" or \"bowel cancer\" or a \"lung cancer\" and towards precision medicine that takes advantage of the genetic make-up of each patient's tumour.\n\nDr Chisholm told the BBC: \"The beauty is it targets the abnormality.\n\n\"There are a number of biochemical pathways that are common in many different tumour types.\n\n\"I think this is the way things are going and this is about better outcomes, curing more patients and producing kinder treatments with reduced side-effects.\"\n\nThe decision by European regulators does not mean it will be instantly available for patients in the UK.\n\nBut earlier this year, NHS England described tumour-agnostic drugs as a \"revolutionary\" and \"exciting new breakthrough\" in cancer and said preparations were under way to ensure patients were given access to them.\n\n\"The benefits for patients - in particular children - of being able to treat many different types of cancers with one drug is potentially huge, helping them to lead longer, healthier lives,\" NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens said at the time.\n\nProf Charles Swanton, Cancer Research UK's chief clinician, said the drugs were \"exciting\".\n\nHe added: \"The NHS will need to ensure the right genomic testing is available across the country to identify patients who could benefit so it's good that the NHS is already thinking about how to get this to patients with cancer as soon as possible.\"\n\nDr Brendon Gray, from Bayer, the drug company that developed larotrectinib, said: \"As the first tumour-agnostic medicine approved in Europe, larotrectinib represents a real shift in cancer treatment.\"\n\nFollow James on Twitter.", "description": "The drugs can attack a range of cancers, rather than those in just one part of the body.", "authors": ["James Gallagher", "Health", "Science Correspondent", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/9EDF/production/_108917604_royalmarsden_57074171569.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
