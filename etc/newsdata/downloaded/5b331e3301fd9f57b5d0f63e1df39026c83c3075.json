I feel very confident.\"\n\nTwo years ago, Mason jumped 2.26 on his first attempt before he \"lost focus\" and missed all three tries at 2.29, failing to qualify for the world final in London. He placed 18th, as he did in 2015 after finishing 25th two years earlier.\n\n\"It gutted me that he didn't make it out of prelims because that was a really big opportunity for Mike to medal,\" Mason's coach Jeff Huntoon recalled in May during an interview with CBC Sports.\n\nWATCH | Mike Mason qualifies for world final for first time:\n\nCanada's Michael Mason clears 2.29, advances to high jump final. 0:14\n\nEarlier this year, Mason said he felt stronger and healthier than at any time in his career following chronic hamstring woes up to and including the 2016 season.\n\nMental game a challenge\n\n\"I knew I needed to get healthy and stronger in a lot of areas if I wanted to compete at a high level and was serious about going to a fourth Olympics [next summer],\" says Mason, whose typical training week includes two jump practices, two running workouts and three days of lifting weights.\n\nThe mental game then became Mason's challenge. Staying relaxed, calm and \"in the moment\" is a daily reminder to remain controlled in his approach on the runway to get in proper position for take-off.\n\n\"I've been working really hard to stay focused, not waste any energy, and it seems to be working,\" he said.\n\nHuntoon said it was a \"calm and collected\" Mason who jumped a 2019 world-leading 2.31 on April 5 at the Sam Adams Invitational to break fellow Canadian Derek Drouin's Thorrington Field stadium record of 2.28 from 2017.\n\nTuesday was Mason's highest jump since that day in April in Santa Barbara, Calif. He squeezed into this year's Diamond League Final with his first win of the season on the pro circuit and finished fourth (2.27) in Zurich on Aug. 29.\n\nMason's teammate, Django Lovett, cleared 2.22 on Tuesday and didn't advance.

He was sixth two years ago in London, eighth in 2015 and 34th in 2011.\n\n\"In the past, I would go into these races thinking, 'I have to hit this split, I have to go through the mile [or 1,500 metres] at this time' and I don't think that plays to my strength as a racer,\" Hughes told CBC Sports in July 2018. \"I race my best and run my fastest when I just worry about competing.\"\n\nHughes announced in July via Instagram that he was leaving the Portland-based Bowerman Track Club.\n\n\"My main priority is to continue competing this summer,\" he wrote, \"but with a focus on trying to find happiness again, getting back to enjoying the [daily] routine and joys of being a professional runner.\"\n\nTwo other Canadians joined Hughes in Tuesday's race.
