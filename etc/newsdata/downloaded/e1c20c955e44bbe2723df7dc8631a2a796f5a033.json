Unnecessary commuting (13%)\n\nThe average commute has increased since 1980.

And that's just the average, which means that some of us are spending a lot more than that. (I've known people with three-hour commutes \u2014 one way.)\n\nLet's suppose that you have a commute that's only of average length. By the time you retire, you'll have spent approximately 5.6 years behind the wheel, which is roughly 13 percent of the time that you've committed to work.\n\nWhile some jobs (like equipment maintenance) require an employee to be on site, almost all office jobs can be conducted from a home office.
