Turkey considers the YPG a \"terrorist\" group.\n\nHere are the latest updates:\n\nThursday, October 10\n\nSDF says it stopped advancing Turkish military\n\nA Kurdish-led group and Syrian activists claimed that despite the heavy barrage, Turkish troops had not made much progress on several fronts they had opened over the past hours.\n\nBut their claims could not be independently verified and the situation on the ground was difficult to assess.\n\nMustafa Bali, a spokesman for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, said their fighters have repelled Turkish forces ground attacks.\n\n\"No advance as of now,\" he tweeted Thursday.\n\nTurkey using 'air power' to advance through border\n\nAl Jazeera's Zeina Khodr said the Turkish military is using air raids as well as artillery bombardment to target the defences of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), mainly along the border.\n\n\"We still don't know how much of an advance Turkish soldiers and their local allies - the opposition [Free Syrian Army] - have made, but according to officials and defence ministry sources, the operation is moving ahead smoothly,\" Khodr said, speaking from the Turkish border town of Akcakale.\n\nThe SDF, Khodr explained, are out-numbered and out-gunned, and the flat terrain will make it easy for the Turkish army to advance. The first phase of the operation is concentrated on the 100-kilometre stretch of territory between two Syrian border towns: Tal Abyad and Ras al-Ain.\n\nTurkey's Defence Ministry shared a brief video of its commandos in action, and said Turkish jets and artillery had struck 181 targets east of the Euphrates River in Syria since the operation began.\n\nNo go-ahead on Turkish operation: Pompeo\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington did not give Ankara \"a green light\" for a military offensive into Syria.\n\n\"That's just false,\" he said in an interview with PBS channel, but did not elaborate other than to say that Turkey has a \"legitimate security concern\".\n\n\"They have a terrorist threat to their south,\" Pompeo said. \"We've been working to make sure that we did what we could do to prevent that terror threat from striking the people in Turkey while trying to achieve what is in America's best interest: the threat from radical Islamic terrorism emanating from Syria.\"\n\nPompeo said the US was leaving Syria because it had achieved its goal of eliminating ISIL's control of the territory, which the SDF had played an instrumental part in.\n\n\"We'll continue to be in a position to do what we need to do to keep the American people as safe as we possibly can from this threat,\" he said.\n\nTurkish lira steady after launch of Syria offensive\n\nThe Turkish lira was steady against the dollar early on Thursday after Turkish troops and their Syrian rebel allies launched a ground operation against a Kurdish militia in northeast Syria overnight.\n\nThe lira was little changed at 04:21 GMT compared with a day earlier when it closed at 5.8679. It had weakened 0.5 percent on Wednesday when the operation began with air raids.\n\nUS airmen denounces 'abandoning fierce allies'\n\nUS Air Force Major Jason Baker - who flew combat missions and provided support to Kurdish-led ground forces in the fight against ISIL in 2016 - wrote in an opinion piece in USA Today that the SDF was crucial in defeating the armed group in northern Syria.\n\n\"The Kurds have proved time and again their capability as a disciplined, effective fighting force and their commitment to the kind of stable, moderate governance that is sorely lacking in the region \u2026 The [US] administration's plan of abandoning them now would not just be a reversal of long-established policy, it also would be a betrayal of one of America's few reliable regional partners.\"\n\nAustralia worried about Turkish operation, ISIL resurgence\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday he had been in contact with the Turkish and US governments overnight, but admitted to being worried about the situation in Syria following Ankara's announcement of a military operation.\n\n\"We are very concerned about what this could potentially mean for the Kurdish people,\" he said.\n\n\"We're concerned about what this could mean for the potential for the resurgence of Daesh,\" he added, using the Arabic acronym for ISIL.\n\nRead more updates here", "description": "Turkish troops cross Syrian border east of the Euphrates River as UN expresses 'alarm' over Ankara's military push.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/9/807597d09395443380c748db951d8e85_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
