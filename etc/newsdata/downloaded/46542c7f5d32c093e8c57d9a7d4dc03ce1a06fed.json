With the exception of aluminum, she said, it now costs more to collect and process materials than they are worth in scrap value.\n\nAD\n\nSaid Collins: \u201cIn 2019, we have this unprecedented situation where the markets for different material types all declined at the same time.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAlso, our recycling rates as a nation have been flat for 15 years.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not recycling better than we did more than a decade ago,\u201d said Adam Ortiz, director of Montgomery County\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection.\n\nAnd the contents of our recycling bins aren\u2019t of the best quality. Too much of it is contaminated with food or stuff that can\u2019t be recycled.\n\n\u201cThe pizza box is a good example,\u201d Ortiz said.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t just throw the entire Domino\u2019s or Papa John\u2019s box in the cardboard recycling. \u201cTear it in half,\u201d he said. \u201cPut the top part in the recycling and put the greasy part in the trash.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nSingle-stream recycling \u2014 in which everything goes in the same bin \u2014 can suffer when shards of glass from broken bottles get stuck in cardboard fibers, making the paper less desirable.\n\nIt degrades the glass, too, which is why many jurisdictions have told residents not to include glass in their recycling bins but to put it in with the trash.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThe problem is that most of the glass going through most of the single-stream systems across the country is of poor quality and, therefore, harder to process and make into a profitable commodity for the waste management companies,\u201d said Scott DeFife, president of the Glass Packaging Institute.\n\nHe said glassmakers actually want recycled glass \u2014 it\u2019s known as cullet \u2014 but only if it\u2019s the primo stuff.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that communities will think out of the box in terms of alternative collection of glass to increase the amount of good-quality material in the glass recycling stream,\u201d DeFife said.\n\nThat could include what seems like a step backward: asking citizens to take their glass to collection points.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not recycling as well as we should,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cWe have a lot of non-recyclables that get mixed in. Then there are a lot of disposable materials that seem recyclable but aren\u2019t \u2014 like Styrofoam \u2014 that get mixed in. All of that degrades the quality of the commodity.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that manufacturers continue to package things in ways that make recycling difficult, combining paper with plastics and making it hard to recycle either.\n\nAD\n\nPlus, Ortiz said, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of plastics that are not recyclable that are being used in consumer products.\u201d\n\nFor example, those red disposable cups popular at keg parties shouldn\u2019t go in with your plastic recycling. They\u2019re made of No. 6 plastic, which is not easily recyclable. The same thing applies to those little plastic disposable bathroom cups. I have to tell My Lovely Wife that she can stop painstakingly picking them out of the trash.\n\nOn the plus side, some companies are stepping up their game. Improvements are being made at material recovery centers to better sort recycling. Some pulp mills are switching from virgin fiber processing to working with recycled fibers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWhat can we do as individuals? Practice good recycling hygiene. Learn what\u2019s recyclable and what isn\u2019t. Visit your county or city\u2019s Web page and see exactly what they want.\n\nJust as importantly, reduce your overall consumption and reuse as much as you can, including shopping bags.\n\nIt can be hard to see the impact from such practices. And it\u2019s easy to get discouraged. But I think there\u2019s a value beyond what money a city or county gets from selling its plastic and glass \u2014 or is spending to dispose of it.\n\nFor me, each Wednesday is a weekly reminder that what I buy and use has an effect on the planet and that what may seem inconvenient \u2014 schlepping my plastic newspaper bags to the grocery store \u2014 is better for Earth.\n\nThere\u2019s one other thing: While prices for many recyclable commodities have fallen, aluminum remains strong.\n\n\u201cWhen you buy beer or wine, buy it in a can,\u201d Ortiz said.\n\nI\u2019ll drink to that \u2014 ideally with a reusable cup.\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.\n\nAD", "description": "Glass in our cardboard and non-recyclables in our bins are just some of the problems.", "authors": ["John Kelly", "Local Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ckNU4lk0UbQOnlL2tnSJs6Vghuo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/53IZ6GQV5AI6LBCXJNBRX57NJQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
