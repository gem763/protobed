Private vehicles are plying on the roads but the absence of public transport is adding to people\u2019s woes. All educational institutions, including schools, colleges and universities are without students as uncertainty and atmosphere of scare are preventing them to attend the classes.\n\nDespite the authorities\u2019 claims that there are no restrictions in any part of the valley, curbs under Section 144, banning assembly of four or more persons, continue to remain enforced in Srinagar and other towns across the territory. Though the administration said that normalcy has returned to the territory, yet its recent publishing of full-page ads in leading Srinagar-based newspapers, asking residents to resume normal life and open their businesses is ample proof that things are not normal in the territory.\n\nThe occupation authorities are likely to re-impose curfew-like restrictions, today, in the Occupied Kashmir valley to prevent people from holding a march towards the UN office in Srinagar.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Normal life continues to remain affected for the 75th straight day, Friday, in the Occupied Kashmir valley and Muslim majority areas of the Jammu region.", "authors": ["Web Desk"], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Kashmir-7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
