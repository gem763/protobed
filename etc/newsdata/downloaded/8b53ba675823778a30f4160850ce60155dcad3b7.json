At the time, Japan would have been intent purely on targeting a quarter-final place at the World Cup - most likely in second behind strong favourites Ireland in their pool, let\u2019s face it - and hardly thinking obsessively about withholding any of their strengths or strategic secrets from the Boks.\n\nThey also threw their optimal staffing resources at South Africa in Saitama, as evidenced by the fact that 11 of their starting line-up there also began the pool-closing crunch against Scotland on Sunday, with two others on the bench (and Amanaki Mafi, normally their first-choice No 8 who began against the Boks, has been curtailed by injury subsequently).\n\nBoks matching Japan\u2019s fitness\n\nArriving as the first of all competing, visiting countries at RWC 2019 has been another Rassie Erasmus masterstroke, it seems.\n\nWhile that brought the risk of tour fatigue setting in at some point, by all accounts the Boks have been at very worst \u201ccomfortable\u201d thus far in the Land of the Rising Sun ... but more importantly, particularly well-adjusted to the challenging levels of humidity.\n\nThe Bok head coach had already placed a suitably high emphasis on smart conditioning ahead of the tournament - including deftly keeping key personnel \u201cout of competition\u201d at certain times to allow a good focus on gym and stamina-based work - and getting to Japan early has only aided the squad further in acclimatisation.\n\nSome teams, and notably those from more western parts of Europe, have huffed and puffed more noticeably through the group stage at times.\n\nJapan have a strongly tempo-based game ... but South Africa should be equipped to live with it.\n\nSA\u2019s \u201ctwo packs\u201d arsenal \u2026 and KO phase-suited game plan\n\nWhether Erasmus opts to go with a more conventional 5-3 forwards/backs bench split for the quarter-final or repeats his \u201cItaly trick\u201d of even favouring 6-2, the Boks will throw pretty much \u201ctwo packs\u201d at the less physically-blessed Japanese engine room, particularly when it comes to quality of tight-five resources.\n\nSo South Africa ought to be in a position to have a front five capable of (more than?) neutralising their opponents for 50 minutes or so, before the introduction of further gnarly specimens who either maintain or enhance mastery for the remaining half-hour of the knockout match.\n\nIt is just one reason why the Boks should gradually throttle the host nation into submission - though just another is that the 1995 and 2007 champions traditionally, anyway, play a brand of conservative-themed rugby that is often enough tailor-made for knockout play.\n\nThe Boks\u2019 (likely) greater freshness on Sunday\n\nYes, there is the possible hazard - I have drawn attention to it before - of the Boks beginning the quarter-final feeling a wee bit undercooked after a breeze through the three pool games that followed the opener against the All Blacks ... plus the fact that their \u201cfirst team\u201d will not have started since the Italy triumph (49-3) on reasonably distant October 4.\n\nBut they are shrewd enough - both from the booth and among the wise leadership heads on the field - to be alert to that possibility and knowing how to crank up the intensity in a hurry if it becomes necessary.\n\nA counter view, and one I am more inclined to value, will be that South Africa gradually reap some benefit on the day from their period of \u201cR & R\u201d ... whereas the Japanese side, now playing at a searing level they are not mentally accustomed to, feel the residual effects of their frantic mini-final, if you like, against Scotland, played only a week ahead of the big Bok date.\n\n*Follow our chief writer on Twitter: @RobHouwing", "description": "The Springboks have all the right ammunition to end the host nation\u2019s gallant World Cup run in Sunday\u2019s quarter-final, says a bullish <strong>Rob Houwing</strong>.", "authors": ["Rob Houwing", "Chief Writer"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7929/a677d6b19a374b8daeb5e34d64c233af.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
