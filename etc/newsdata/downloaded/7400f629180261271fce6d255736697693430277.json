US president Donald Trump has joined Amazon-owned livestreaming platform Twitch.\n\nTwitch is best known as a social video streaming platform for gamers but does host other content, including politics.\n\nThe verified DonaldTrump Twitch account, spotted earlier by Reuters, has just one video in the recent broadcast section so far: A livestream of a Trump rally which took place in Minneapolis yesterday evening.\n\nAlongside the saved video of this broadcast is a growing selection of user generated clips culled from the stream, with titles such as \u201cThis is our president.\u201d, \u201cLOL\u201d, \u201cKEK\u201d and \u201cpepelaugh\u201d.\n\nAnother clip remarks on how a single black man \u2014 who\u2019s visible in the top corner of the shot of the audience behind Trump \u2014 vanishes as \u201cthey zoom him out of the picture\u201d.\n\nTrump is not the only high profile US politician to be taking to Twitch to broadcast campaign rallies in real time ahead of next year\u2019s presidential election.\n\nDemocratic senator Bernie Sanders, who is making a pitch to be the party\u2019s presidential candidate, joined the platform a few months ago. And at the time of writing Sanders still has more followers than Trump on Twitch (88,795 vs 37,754).\n\nOver on Twitter, meanwhile \u2014 Trump\u2019s go-to social media soapbox for skewering opponents and deflecting criticism, via his preferred medium of the early morning attack tweet \u2014 the president has ~65.6M followers.\n\nSo Twitter is very unlikely to be concerned that its highest profile user is flirting with Amazon\u2019s social streaming platform. (Though it\u2019s much less clear how happy \u201cJeff Bozo\u201d will be about Trump getting on Twitch.)\n\nTrump has dabbled with using Twitter\u2019s own video streaming tool, Periscope. But the choice of Twitch for streaming his campaign rallies looks mostly like a case of horses for courses. Periscope is more for on-the-fly mobile streaming, whereas Twitch is a platform built for playing to (and building) a \u2018lean back\u2019 audience.\n\nTroll culture also thrives on gamer Twitch. And Trump is of course edgelord of the trolls. Ergo he should fit right in.\n\nWith Periscope Twitter has been taking a stronger approach to tackling abusive comments in recent years (and also trying to fight fake and spam content) \u2014 in line with its stated desire to increase \u2018conversational health\u2019 on its platforms. So it\u2019s probably happy to have dodged a bullet here.\n\nCertainly Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey has more enough flying his way over whatever Trump choses to tweet next.", "description": "The reelection campaign will be livestreamed.
