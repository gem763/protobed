Circuit, but a motion submitted to Howell Monday seeking a stay of her decision sought to use statements by Pelosi to quarrel with Howell\u2019s claim Friday that the Mueller grand jury materials bear on events \u201ccentral to the impeachment inquiry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Speaker has announced that the House impeachment inquiry will focus narrowly on the whistleblower complaint and issues surrounding Ukraine,\u201d DOJ lawyer Elizabeth Shapiro wrote. The Justice Department brief cites a Washington Post article about Pelosi\u2019s statement and, in an unusual move, quotes an assessment by the authors of the story that the Judiciary Committee and its chairman, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y), have been \u201cat least temporarily relegated to the wings.\u201d\n\nHowell\u2019s ruling last week granted the Judiciary Committee access to portions of Mueller\u2019s final report that were redacted as grand jury secrets. She also said the House panel is entitled to underlying grand jury information cited in the report. Her ruling rejected arguments from Trump and White House counsel Pat Cipollone that the ongoing impeachment inquiries were invalid because there was no formal House vote to authorize them. She also said legal precedents dictate that impeachment is a judicial proceeding that falls within a legal provision permitting disclosure of grand jury information that would ordinarily would be secret.\n\nHowell, an appointee of President Barack Obama, gave the Justice Department until Wednesday to turn over the requested records. She gave Democrats until noon on Tuesday to respond to the Justice Department. House lawyers have indicated they plan to oppose any extension of the DOJ\u2019s Wednesday deadline.\n\nJustice Department lawyers argued that allowing Howell\u2019s decision to take effect would essentially deprive the administration of the ability to present its \u201cstrong arguments\u201d that her ruling was mistaken.\n\n\u201cA stay is warranted because, without a stay, the Department will be irreparably harmed,\u201d Shapiro wrote. \u201cOnce the information is disclosed, it cannot be recalled, and the confidentiality of the grand jury information will be lost for all time \u2014 particularly if Petitioner United States House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary \u2026 decides to publicize the now-secret grand jury materials, which it has asserted the power to do through a simple majority vote.\u201d\n\nIf Howell denies the stay motion, the Justice Department will likely make a near-identical request to the D.C. Circuit. It commonly grants such motions, at least briefly, so it can consider how to proceed.\n\nThe appeal will be assigned to a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit, which has seven Democratic appointees and four GOP appointees on its active bench. The House committee or the Justice Department could also seek review by the full bench of the D.C. Circuit or the Supreme Court.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b3/d4/d77b4aa14fb88d0e53b293390eec/181109-robert-mueller-gtty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
