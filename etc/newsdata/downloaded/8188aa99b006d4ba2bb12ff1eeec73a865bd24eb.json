He wants the focus to be on the game, on his players expressing themselves and, hopefully, revelling in the thrill of qualifying.\n\nAs ever, though, there have been side issues, with the potential problems in Sofia at the top of the agenda. Borislav Mihaylov, the president of the Bulgarian Football Union, revealed on Thursday he had written to Uefa to express his frustration at comments made by Southgate and others, which he suggested had been pre-emptive.\n\nBulgaria\u2019s stadium has been partially closed for two matches \u2013 the second of which will be against England \u2013 because of racist abuse from their supporters in the June qualifiers against the Czechs and Kosovo.\n\nMihaylov called upon Uefa to sanction England if they went against its protocols and he did not conceal his anger. \u201cI personally find these comments [from Southgate] offensive due to the unjust branding of the local spectators as people inclined to discriminatory behaviour,\u201d Mihaylov said. \u201cI cannot allow for such derogatory claims to continue being spread in the mass media.\u201d\n\nSouthgate, who suggested his players would respect Uefa protocols, made the point that England would be foolish not to look at the country\u2019s own issues with racism and he mentioned the alleged abuse in a National League game between Hartlepool and Dover in September.\n\n\u201cI can totally understand why the Bulgarian president feels as he does because we have purely been responding honestly to questions we\u2019ve been asked,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThat will then be relayed and the way it\u2019s pitched could appear provocative.\n\n\u201cWe are not trying to create a situation, far from it. We\u2019re all hoping that over the next 72 hours we\u2019re just talking about two football matches.\n\n\u201cI have to say again, we don\u2019t look at other countries in a way that we don\u2019t shine a mirror on our own. What happened in Hartlepool a couple of weeks ago was probably worse than things I\u2019ve seen or heard about in many other countries in the world.\u201d\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nRaheem Sterling, who has been a passionate anti-racism campaigner, said at the moment that he had \u201cfull faith in Uefa\u201d and its protocols. He talked more about his ambition to win silverware with England, having done so at club level with Manchester City, and he admitted he found extra motivation from the fact the Euro 2020 final will be held at Wembley, close to where he grew up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s something you think of all the time [winning with England], especially after coming so close in the World Cup,\u201d Sterling said. \u201cI feel that a lot of the players don\u2019t just want to be involved in tournaments and finish in the quarter-finals or the semi\u2011finals and say that was a good run.\n\n\u201cEvery single player and the manager all want to go into tournaments with the thought of winning. It\u2019s definitely something we all dream of.\u201d\n\nSterling is part of a highly rated group of England attackers alongside Harry Kane, Jadon Sancho and Marcus Rashford, while Southgate also name\u2011checked Callum Hudson\u2011Odoi and Arsenal\u2019s 18-year-old Bukayo Saka.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s exciting but we have to do it in big games, big tournaments,\u201d Sterling said. \u201cThat\u2019s when we\u2019ll be judged as a great front three or not.\u201d", "description": "Gareth Southgate has moved to smooth relations with Bulgaria after he and the England squad were accused of making \u2018derogatory\u2019 remarks", "authors": ["David Hytner"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02031ad411fcfb377a5b07087f60ffbccb5d49db/0_13_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b967401ffb4e4bc1bd09b777b2ffd57c", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
