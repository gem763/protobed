She instructed them to return Oct. 10.\n\nAD\n\nGraham, who has been in D.C. jail since his arrest, was charged with first-degree sex abuse after a woman reported that he violently assaulted her last year.\n\nAD\n\nDuring his opening statements to the jury last week, Graham told jurors how he met the woman and she accompanied him to his home.\n\nGraham told the jury the sexual encounter that followed was consensual and that the two \u201cmade magic,\u201d which he explained to the jurors meant \u201csex.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t you think the defendant is handsome?\u2019: Rape case takes unusual turn when accused represents himself at trial\n\nThe next day, the 21-year-old woman took the witness stand and, at times tearfully, said Graham choked her, threw her on the bed and held her down while removing her leggings before raping her. It was an extremely balmy July 4 afternoon, she said, and Graham had invited her to step into his air-conditioned home until her bus was scheduled to arrive.\n\nAD\n\nWhen it was time for Graham to cross-examine the woman, he strayed from the questions Howard McEachern, his court-appointed advising attorney, had written for him and asked questions that included: \u201cDo you think the defendant is handsome?\u201d Graham also asked the woman: \u201cHave you ever seen the film \u201850 Shades of Grey\u2019?\u201d and \u201cDo you consider yourself an emotional female?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAt one point, Graham snapped, \u201cI\u2019m the lawyer,\u201d to McEachern when he tried to advise Graham on an issue regarding an exhibit, causing one juror to gasp.\n\nThe next day, McEachern met with D.C. criminal psychologist Teresa Grant, who had been observing Graham in the courtroom. The two approached Dayson with concerns that Graham\u2019s mental illness was impeding his ability to defend himself.\n\nAD\n\nDayson had ordered a mental evaluation on Graham in June, and he was found competent to stand trial, although a psychiatrist diagnosed him with an \u201cunspecified bipolar and related disorder.\u201d\n\nGrant, following a 24-hour forensic study ordered by Dayson, determined the stress of the trial had caused Graham\u2019s competence to drastically decline. That finding prompted the judge to order Graham to St. Elizabeths, where he will undergo treatment and further evaluation.\n\nAD\n\nDuring the Thursday hearing, Graham argued he was competent to proceed.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Kenya Davis also argued she believed Graham was competent based on his knowledge of the proceedings. If the case does not move forward, the woman may have to testify again. Prosecutors who handle sexual assault cases try to spare victims the experience of having to recount the alleged crime multiple times.\n\nAD\n\nDayson said she will wait for a further update on Graham\u2019s mental status before deciding whether to move forward with the trial or order a mistrial.\n\nA mystery 32 stories up: Is a grandfather, 68, leaping of the D.C. area\u2019s tallest buildings?\n\nCoast Guard lieutenant accused of plotting mass attack pleads guilty to gun, drug charges\n\nDriver who struck and killed cyclist and activist David Salovesh sentenced to 8 1/2 years in prison\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "During D.C. trial, defendant asked woman who accused him of rape: \u201cDo you think the defendant is handsome?\u201d", "authors": ["Keith L.
