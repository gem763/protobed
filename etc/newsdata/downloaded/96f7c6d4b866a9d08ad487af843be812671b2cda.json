Andy Biggs, the Arizona Republican who chairs the conservative House Freedom Caucus, and has the support of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., and House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., among other ranking Republicans in the lower chamber of Congress.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE NAMES OF THE CENSURE CO-SPONSORS\n\nDemocrats have the majority and control the floor in the House, but Republicans could still attempt to force a vote on the matter.\n\n\u201cSchiff simply does not have the gravitas that a weighty procedure such as impeachment requires,\u201d Biggs wrote in an opinion piece for Fox News. \u201cHe has repeatedly shown incredibly poor judgment. He has persistently and consistently demonstrated that he has such a tremendous bias and animus against Trump that he will say anything and accept any proffer of even bogus evidence to try to remove the president from office.\u201d\n\nFox News has requested comment from Schiff's office.\n\nBOLTON INSTRUCTED FORMER RUSSIA ADVISER TO ALERT NSC LAWYER OVER UKRAINE, ADVISER TESTIFIES\n\nSchiff, who is leading one of the committees investigating Trump in the impeachment inquiry announced by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has been under fire from conservatives for the \u201cparody\u201d of the president\u2019s call with Zelensky that he read at the testimony last month of Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.\n\nMaguire was on Capitol Hill to defend his handling of the explosive whistleblower complaint detailing how Trump pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.\n\nThe complaint contains allegations related to Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky in July, when he urged him to investigate alleged corruption involving the Bidens.\n\nThe White House last month released an unclassified version of the transcript of the phone call. The memo, which does not reflect a \u201cverbatim transcript\u201d but is based on \u201cnotes and recollections\u201d of those memorializing the call, shows Trump suggesting he pursue some kind of investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden.\n\nGIULIANI 'DISAPPOINTED' IN BOLTON AMID CLAIM HE TOLD AIDE TO ALERT LAWYER TO UKRAINE PROBE\n\nOn the dais during Maguire\u2019s testimony, Schiff gave his own exaggerated version of the phone call.\n\n\u201cI have a favor I want from you,\u201d Schiff said while appearing to read from a paper. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to say this only seven times, so you better listen good. I want you to make up dirt on my political opponent, understand? Lots of it, on this and on that.\u201d\n\nSchiff has defended the version of the phone call he read at the testimony and chalked up his fictional summary of the controversial phone call to parody.\n\n\u201cMy summary of the president\u2019s call was meant to be at least, part, in parody,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThe fact that that\u2019s not clear is a separate problem in and of itself. Of course, the president never said, \u2018If you don\u2019t understand me I\u2019m going to say it seven more times\u2019; my point is, that\u2019s the message that the Ukraine president was receiving in not so many words.\u201d\n\nGAETZ SPEAKS OUT AFTER SCHIFF THROWS HIM OUT OF IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY HEARING\n\nSchiff\u2019s explanation, however, did little to quell the outrage of his Republican colleagues who were already on the defensive following Pelosi\u2019s announcement last Tuesday of the impeachment inquiry into Trump.\n\n\u201cChairman Adam Schiff has been lying to the American people for years,\u201d McCarthy said in a tweet announcing that he signed on to co-sponsor Biggs\u2019 resolution. \u201cNow he is so desperate to damage the president that he literally made up a false version of a phone call. Enough is enough.\u201d\n\nThe president also voiced his anger with Schiff \u2013 who he has labeled with the nickname \u201cShifty Schiff\u201d -- calling the California Democrat \u201cdesperate\u201d and accusing him of lying to Congress.\n\n\u201cRep. Adam Schiff fraudulently read to Congress, with millions of people watching, a version of my conversation with the President of Ukraine that doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cHe was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call, but he completely changed the words to make it sound horrible, and me sound guilty.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSchiff, however, did not take Trump\u2019s taunt sitting down, firing back an accusation that the president was trying to \u201cshakedown\u201d a foreign leader and then trying to cover it up.\n\n\u201cYou engaged in a shakedown to get election dirt from a foreign country,\u201d Schiff said in a tweet. \u201cAnd then you tried to cover it up.\u201d\n\nFox News' Mike Emanuel contributed to this report.", "description": "The motion to censure House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., for his \u201cparody\u201d reading of President Trump\u2019s July phone call with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky during a hearing last month has picked up steam with Republicans and reached 125 co-sponsors.", "authors": ["Andrew O'Reilly"], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/09/27/694940094001_6089891043001_6089893388001-vs.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
