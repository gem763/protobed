The company has not given a timeline for the resumption of full output. source close to the matter told Reuters the return to full oil capacity could take \"weeks, not days.\" Arabia's oil exports will continue as normal this week as the kingdom taps into stocks from its large storage facilities, an industry source briefed on the developments told Reuters on Sunday. think the attacks would be a wake up call for investors, who have failed to price in risk within the price of crude.

China's Shanghai crude oil futures rose to its trading limit, gaining 8% at the open.
