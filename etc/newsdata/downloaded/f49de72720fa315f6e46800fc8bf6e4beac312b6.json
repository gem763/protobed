It was an old one my mom had lying around with a duck head as the handle. I felt like a Brooklyn Mary Poppins with its head peeking out of my tote. The only problem was that as an umbrella, it kind of sucked. The hinges rusted and put holes in the fabric and it didn\u2019t come with an outer bag. I decided it was time to retire the duck umbrella and get myself one that will last me more than one summer. That\u2019s where the Blunt Metro came in.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing like finding an umbrella you truly love and this one is pretty damn close. The XS is perfectly-sized for me (I\u2019m 5\u20191\u201d for context)and is extremely comfortable to hold. And because the frame and ribs are made from fiberglass, one big gust of wind won\u2019t turn it inside out and force you to shove it into a corner trash can in anger. It\u2019s built to withstand gusts of up to 55 mph, though I don\u2019t really want to test that, to be honest. The fabric is rip-resistant and will keep you protected from UV rays that will still get you on a cloudy day. But, by far, my favorite feature is something most won\u2019t notice. The sleeve that the umbrella comes in has a zipper that expands the top opening to easily slide in a wet umbrella. The only thing I would add would be an auto-close feature, but that\u2019s just a small detail. The days of struggling to shove a non-neatly folded umbrella into a sleeve that\u2019s just barely bigger than it are no more. This is the umbrella to end all umbrellas. | Get it on Amazon >\n\nMORE FROM SCOUTED:\n\nScouted is internet shopping with a pulse.
