And while it\u2019s kind of late to the game at this point, Tumblr is at least putting its own twist on the feature with stickers that fit distinctly with its strange, \u201890s-internet vibes.\n\nFilters and stickers will be available inside Tumblr\u2019s Android app, iOS app, and iMessage app starting today. They\u2019ll work on top of both photos and GIFs, and they get applied in a way that\u2019ll be very familiar if you\u2019ve used Snapchat (or anything that\u2019s been inspired by it) before \u2014 you swipe to go through filters, and you can rotate, shrink or expand, and position stickers wherever you\u2019d like.\n\nThere are over 100 stickers right now (including a corgi, \u201cassorted moons,\u201d and a \u201cwobble grid\u201d), and Tumblr plans to add temporary stickers every so often for special events, like Valentine\u2019s Day and Black History Month.\n\nHere are some Tuesday morning vibes, illustrated by Tumblr stickers:", "description": "Tumblr is the latest app to add photo filters and stickers.
