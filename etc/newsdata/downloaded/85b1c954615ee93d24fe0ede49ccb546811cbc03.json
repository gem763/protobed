(AP) - Although youth keeps them from fully appreciating their programs\u2019 shared past, these Penn State and Pittsburgh players could occupy a significant place in the rivalry\u2019s history.\n\nThe game Saturday between the No. 13 Nittany Lions (2-0) and Panthers (1-1) will be the 100th meeting in the intrastate series that began in 1893. It ran from 1900-31 and 1935-1992 before becoming a four-game series in the late 90s.\n\nBut their fourth meeting since 2016 could be the last, for the foreseeable future.\n\nPitt athletic director Heather Lyke asked the Nittany Lions in 2017 about extending the series, but Penn State declined. That\u2019s in part because of less flexibility with a schedule that includes nine Big Ten conference games. The Panthers play just eight in the Atlantic Coast Conference.\n\nBoth Lyke and Penn State athletic director Sandy Barbour declined requests from The Associated Press this week to discuss the future of the rivalry.\n\n\u201cWe are not closing the door,\u201d Penn State coach James Franklin said. \u201cWe are open to a bunch of different discussions, whether that is home and home, whether that is neutral site, whatever that may be. But it sure would make it a lot easier if we both were playing eight conference games or nine conference games.\u201d\n\nBarbour and Franklin have noted that Penn State wants to play one Power Five opponent and two Group of Five schools each year.\n\nPitt coach Pat Narduzzi has said he\u2019d like the rivalry to continue. The Panthers won in 2016, with Penn State taking the last two games.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big game because it\u2019s a rivalry game, in state,\u201d Narduzzi said. \u201cYou know, again, I\u2019m going to emphasize to our kids, you might be the last team to ever get to play this game.\u201d\n\nCOUNTER INTEL\n\nThe Nittany Lions spent a lot of time in camp changing their signaling system for this game.\n\nThey had to do so after safety John Petrishen transferred to the Panthers in August. The Western Pennsylvania native played in just 16 games over three years for Penn State, but was particularly familiar with the team\u2019s communication methods, Franklin said.\n\nPenn State\u2019s offense doesn\u2019t huddle and relies on sideline signals for all on-field communication.\n\n\u201cI think you pick it up pretty quickly,\u201d tight end Nick Bowers said. \u201cYou kind of get the gist from the other signals, but I mean, for the most part, it\u2019s just about your preparation.\u201d\n\nPASSING FANCY\n\nThe Panthers are trying to modernize their offense under first-year coordinator Mark Whipple, a makeover designed to achieve more balance after Pitt has relied heavily on the run in recent years. The early results are mixed. Pickett was erratic in the opener against Virginia, thanks in part to an offensive line featuring four new starters. The Panthers took a step forward against Ohio, with Pickett throwing for a career-high 321 yards. The going may be tougher against the Nittany Lions.\n\n\u201cKenny has that in him every game,\u201d wide receiver Maurice Ffrench said. \u201cWe all just have to click.\u201d\n\nFORMIDABLE FRONT?\n\nPitt\u2019s defensive line has taken a step forward despite losing starters Rashad Weaver and Keyshon Camp to season-ending knee injuries. The Panthers rolled up six sacks against Ohio, with Jaylen Twyman collecting three, the most by a Pitt defensive tackle since NFL star Aaron Donald in 2011.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got some young guys in there just playing their first games,\u201d Narduzzi said. \u201cI think that\u2019s something you have to look at, and it\u2019s not what we want it to be. It\u2019s not where we wanted to be (but) we\u2019ll just continue to get better every week, I think, with those young guys playing for us.\u201d\n\nTHIRD DOWN WOES\n\nDespite racking up 1,010 yards and 124 points through the first two weeks, the Nittany Lions have been dreadful on third downs. They have converted just 3 of 17 third-down tries.\n\n\u201cFor us to take the next step, we need to continue to be explosive on first and second down and be more efficient on third down, and then we\u2019ll be really difficult to deal with,\u201d Franklin said.\n\n___\n\nSports Writer Will Graves contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Although youth keeps them from fully appreciating their programs' shared past, these Penn State and Pittsburgh players could occupy a significant place in the rivalry's history.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Travis Johnson"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/13/ohio_pittsburgh_football_05093_c0-105-2485-1553_s1770x1032.jpg?881392ca18ffaf6fc4d64ee3e8f9724d33dad83a", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
