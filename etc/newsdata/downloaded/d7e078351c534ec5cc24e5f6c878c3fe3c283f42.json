It\u2019s easy to bump into European expats in the city, and we seem to be drawn magnetically to each other \u2013 so there are a lot of Germans, French people, and fellow Brits who make up our friendship group. There are, of course, a lot of Americans too. And somehow, the conversations we have over beers always come back to one issue: healthcare.\n\nYou don\u2019t appreciate how bad the healthcare system is in America until you live here, though you can read about some of the worst excesses of it from the safety of your British laptop: the parents charged $39 (\u00a330) to hold their own newborn baby, the fact that most cancer patients accrue more than $10,000 in debt because of their treatment. What you don\u2019t realise is the psychological impact that has on the entire country.\n\nAfter being in the US for just 10 months, I already know someone who broke down in tears when she found out she needed abdominal surgery for a serious condition because she feared her parents would have to sell their house to pay for it. (The fact that she had a grave illness didn\u2019t even factor in to the upset.) I have another who fell out with a family member who called her an ambulance after she slipped and broke her ankle, because the ambulance costs are so high. She would rather have chanced it in a taxi with her bone sticking out of her leg.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThese people already have health insurance, which they pay about $300 per month for out of their salaries. But the way the system is set up means that you co-pay alongside your insurer for some conditions, and still have to pay lump sums yourself \u2013 usually in the multiple thousands of dollars \u2013 before you even reach the threshold where the insurance will pay out.\n\nAll of that casts the \u201cAmerican dream\u201d in a very different light. People here are paid much higher salaries than their British counterparts, and they tend to all have well-tended savings accounts from a young age. After student loans were brought in in the UK, I don\u2019t have any British friends who have savings (I have none myself.) Living \u201cpaycheque to paycheque\u201d is seen in America as living in poverty.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to think of that meaning they\u2019re an affluent country. But the truth is that it takes just one broken leg, one case of appendicitis or one emergency C-section to wipe out savings made for decades by professionals on good salaries. That\u2019s not the same for anyone with an NHS safety net waiting for them back home.\n\nMy fiance describes the living situation in Europe as \u201chaving the edges shaved off\u201d. Few Europeans believe they\u2019re destined to become billionaires, whereas any American you meet will tell you they think it\u2019s a possibility. And Europe has stringent controls in place where America has few: in European countries, for instance, you have to put your house on a landlord\u2019s mortgage before you can rent it out, whereas in the state of New York, not only are you allowed to rent out your own house but a state law prevents your landlord from stopping you from subletting. In other words, you could potentially build your fortune by renting a load of properties yourself and subletting them to other tenants for a profit; you can have a property empire without ever even owning a property. \u2018Murica!!\n\nIt\u2019s this lack of red tape which means people regularly make millions in America (especially in New York) but it also means even the wealthy live precariously. Elderly people in their eighties and nineties work in theme parks and pharmacies to top up their healthcare provisions, then move to Florida where inheritance tax doesn\u2019t exist so their children can benefit. Pregnancies are met with anxiety and panic because the baby has to be insured 24 hours after it\u2019s born, to the tune of around $600 per month.\n\nNobody leaves their job to go freelance after the age of 25, because that\u2019s when you lose the ability to be covered on your parents\u2019 health insurance. People stick with their jobs way past the time when they are miserable because of it. The opioid crisis chugs on because big pharmaceutical companies allowed it to happen for profit.\n\nIn other words, injecting \u201ccompetition\u201d into healthcare is something people need like a hole in the head \u2013 and it changes your whole society. And as I watch Brexit unfold from afar, my greatest worry is that the UK will vote a hole in the head into being.", "description": "A couple of nights ago, my flatmates and I were having drinks in our Brooklyn apartment with the multinational bunch of friends we\u2019ve picked up while living in New York.
