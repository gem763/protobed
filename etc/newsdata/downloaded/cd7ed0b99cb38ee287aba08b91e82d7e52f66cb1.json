If a no-deal Brexit was probable, the budget would be delayed until afterwards, when the impact was clearer.\n\nIn July the OBR predicted borrowing could jump by 30 billion pounds a year by 2020/21 if Britain leaves the EU without a transition deal on Oct. 31, triggering a recession.\n\nTuesday's statistical changes had less impact on public sector net debt, the total amount of money that Britain's government owes. This stood at 1.78 trillion pounds or 80.9% of GDP in August, excluding public-sector banks, down from a post-financial crisis peak of 85.1% in October 2017 but still double pre-crisis levels.", "description": "UK borrowing plans thrown off target by higher spending and student loans", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8N0IW_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
