Biden holds a 12-point lead over Sen. Elizabeth Warren in the race for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, according to a survey finalized on Monday.\n\nMr. Biden had the support of 33% of potential Democratic primary voters and caucus-goers, and was followed by Ms. Warren of Massachusetts at 21% and Sen. Bernard Sanders at 19%, according to the Morning Consult poll.\n\nThe numbers were essentially unchanged compared to last week, amid the Sanders campaign\u2019s announcement late Friday that the Vermont senator had suffered a heart attack.\n\nSen. Kamala D. Harris of California was next at 6%, followed by Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, at 5%, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas and entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 3% apiece, and Sen. Cory A. Booker of New Jersey at 2%.\n\nThe survey is a contrast to the latest Real Clear Poltics average of recent polling, which shows Mr. Biden leading Ms. Warren by less than a percentage point.\n\nThe survey of 16,529 registered voters who said they might vote in a Democratic primary or caucus was taken from Sept. 30 to Oct. 6 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 1 percentage point.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
