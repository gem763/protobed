Both were down almost 4% over the week, representing WTI\u2019s biggest weekly loss in 10 weeks and Brent\u2019s biggest in seven.\n\nBrent and WTI were also hit by a Wall Street Journal report citing unnamed sources saying that Saudi Arabia had agreed a partial ceasefire in Yemen, said analysts in the Reuters Global Oil Forum.\n\nBrent is just above its level before attacks on Saudi facilities on Sept 14, which initially halved the kingdom\u2019s production.\n\nSources told Reuters this week that Saudi Arabia had restored capacity to 11.3 million barrels per day.
