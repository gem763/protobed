She has been voted one of the most corrupt women in Congress four separate times. Her family has made money off her being a \"public servant\" and she has passed just three bills in her nearly thirty year career. Since President Donald J. Trump's first year in office, Rep. Waters has re-branded herself as the \"Auntie Maxine\" of the \"resistance\" and has led raucous women in \"Impeach Trump!\" chants. But, on Tuesday Moonbat Maxine took her mantra to a whole new level -- Trump deserves far more than simple impeachment. She told her followers that he deserves prison time and solitary confinement.\n\n\"I'm calling on the GOP to stop Trump's filthy talk of whistleblowers being spies & using mob language implying they should be killed,\" Rep Waters tweeted.\n\n\"Impeachment is not good enough for Trump,\" she continued. \"He needs to be imprisoned & placed in solitary confinement. But for now, impeachment is the imperative.\"\n\nI'm calling on the GOP to stop Trump's filthy talk of whistleblowers being spies & using mob language implying they should be killed. Impeachment is not good enough for Trump. He needs to be imprisoned & placed in solitary confinement. But for now, impeachment is the imperative. \u2014 Maxine Waters (@RepMaxineWaters) October 1, 2019\n\nOf course, it is unclear what exactly Rep. Waters believes to be Trump's crimes. Since at least October 2017, she has been saying that he should be removed from office by Congress. The latest bouts of Trump Derangement Syndrome have manifested in the Democrats' call for impeachment due to a phone call with Ukraine. That phone call occurred in 2019, so how could Rep. Waters have been calling for impeachment three years ago?\n\nWell, the answer is that it never really is about impeachment. It is about tarnishing the presidency in anyway she can. She was the first to call for impeachment, and now needs to up the ante and call for imprisonment. Her congressional salary is a waste of taxpayer money. Arguably, if anybody should be impeached, it should be Rep. Waters for her shady financial dealings. In 2010, the Financial Services Committee charged her on three counts of wrongdoing. But, nine years later she now serves as the chair of the Financial Services Committee. Gee, it must be nice to continuously fail upwards in Washington, D.C.\n\nWhat's more though is that it remains unclear how other Democrats like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will react to Rep. Waters' lunacy. In the past, AOC has declared solitary confinement to be \"government torture and human rights violations.\"\n\nPaul Manafort is being sent to solitary confinement in my district - Rikers Island.\n\n\n\nA prison sentence is not a license for gov torture and human rights violations. That\u2018s what solitary confinement is.\n\n\n\nManafort should be released, along with all people being held in solitary. https://t.co/9rERLDSzrD \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) June 5, 2019\n\nWill any leftist like AOC ask Rep. Waters to tone down her rhetoric for the sake of the country? I doubt it.", "description": ".10/01/2019 20:30:04PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/269/daceffdd-f1bf-4820-a4fd-7f29c6000254.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
