Bernie Sanders and businessman Andrew Yang have both turned down invitations to speak at an upcoming Democratic presidential town hall devoted to LGBT issues.\n\nCNN said in a press release that the two candidates would not be attending due to \u201cscheduling conflicts.\u201d\n\nThe town hall will be hosted by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation in Los Angeles and is scheduled to run about five hours long, featuring nine top-polling 2020 White House hopefuls discussing issues affecting the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer communities.\n\nTitled \u201cPower of our Pride,\u201d the program will air on Oct. 10, one day prior to National Coming Out Day, Oct. 11.\n\nThe current lineup is: businessman Tom Steyer; Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey; former Vice President Joseph R. Biden; Sen. Kamala Harris of California; Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.; former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke of Texas; Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota; and former HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro.\n\nAdditional candidates could be invited should they qualify to appear on stage in the October debates.\n\nMr. Sanders omission is notable as the HRC accused the Vermont senator of \u201cattacks\u201d during the 2016 election for saying the advocacy organization was a part of \u201cthe political establishment.\u201d\n\nThis will be CNN\u2019s second topical town hall hosted independently of the Democratic National Committee. The first was a climate change town hall which featured seven hours of candidates discussing environmental issues. Despite being an issue of significant concern to Democratic primary voters, it was ultimately a ratings bust for the network.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
