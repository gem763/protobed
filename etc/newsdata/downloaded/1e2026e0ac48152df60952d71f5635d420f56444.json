To get things done so quickly, the inquiry was limited to the president's dealings with Ukraine and whether he abused his power in an effort to politically harm his potential 2020 opponent Joe Biden.\n\nIn the past few days, Democrats have begun to indicate that timeline may be unrealistic, as the investigation brings up new angles that beg further digging and the administration works to thwart the inquiry. \u201cYou know shocking things happen every single day,\u201d Democratic Rep. Jim Himes said.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell reportedly hopes to have a Senate trial, which would be held only if the House votes to impeach, finished by Christmas. If two-thirds of senators vote to convict, Trump would be removed from office.\n\nWhy there\u2019s debate:\n\nThere is a large contingent of conservative lawmakers and voters who see impeachment, regardless of its scope, as a political farce that shouldn't be happening at all. However, polling shows a growing number of Americans support the inquiry.\n\nThose who favor a narrow inquiry say the Ukraine scandal shows clear impropriety that is easily understood by voters. Adding other angles, especially the sprawling Mueller report, could overwhelm the resources of the investigation and muddle the ultimate message that comes out of it. There is also concern among Democrats that an expansive inquiry would drown out the message of the party's presidential candidates in the months leading up to the 2020 election.\n\nAdvocates for broadening the inquiry, many of whom were calling for impeachment before the Ukraine scandal broke, argue that focusing only on Ukraine essentially gives Trump a pardon for what they see as a long list of other abuses of power \u2014 including enriching himself through the presidency, obstruction, and harmful foreign policy decision making. Impeachment is the most powerful investigative tool Congress has and it should be used to give the country a full accounting of the president\u2019s deeds, they argue.\n\nWhat\u2019s next:\n\nThere are a number of steps that will likely need to be completed before a vote can be held, even if the inquiry stays focused on Ukraine. So far, witness testimony has happened behind closed doors. Democrats reportedly would like to hold public hearings and bring in big-name witnesses, such as former national security adviser John Bolton, for questioning. They\u2019re still hoping to complete the inquiry by the end of the year, reports say.\n\nPerspectives\n\nThe inquiry should be expanded\n\nThe administration is obstructing the inquiry.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s now clear that it\u2019s impossible to contain impeachment, since Trump\u2019s only response to being challenged is to become ever more brazen. ...That\u2019s the way it is with impeachment: Trump and his cronies have no ability to defend themselves in a legal manner, so they\u2019ll pile misconduct on top of misconduct.\u201d \u2014 Jeet Heer, The Nation\n\nTrump using the office to enrich himself is a prime example of impeachable conduct.\n\n\u201cI understand Democrats\u2019 desire to keep impeachment focused on abuses of power, but if they don\u2019t use the process to investigate and prosecute Trump\u2019s corrupt self-dealing, it\u2019d be a huge mistake. It\u2019s a canonical abuse of power.\u201d \u2014 Vox founder Ezra Klein\n\nFocusing on Ukraine means letting Trump get away with everything else.\n\n\u201cFor House Democrats to wait this long and then impeach a reckless, lawless, racist, tax-dodging president only over his interactions with the president of Ukraine would be to effectively give Trump a clean bill of health on everything else. Going into an election year, Democrats would be unilaterally disarming \u2014 unable to offer further substantive criticisms of Trump\u2019s crimes and abuses of power across the board.\u201d \u2014 Mehdi Hasan, The Intercept\n\nThe public deserves to know everything that\u2019s happened.\n\n\"The American people are entitled to the truth about all this administration has done, and there should be a formal accounting of Trump\u2019s wrongdoing for the public and for posterity. Impeachment is the only opportunity our political system offers Democrats to accomplish this outside of an electoral process structurally tilted in Trump\u2019s favor.\" \u2014 Osita Nwanevu, New Republic", "description": "Democrats have limited their impeachment inquiry into the president to just allegations involving Ukraine.
