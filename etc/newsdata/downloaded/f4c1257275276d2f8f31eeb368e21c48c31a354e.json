And well-hydrated, silky soft hair, is more manageable when humidity strikes.\n\nOlaplex's products, including the No.5 Bond Maintenance Conditioner (left) and the No.3 Hair Protector (right) are known for their ability to strengthen even the most damaged and frail hair\n\nRated an average 4.5 out of 5 stars on Amazon, the treatment has received nothing but praise, with one shopper dubbing Olaplex No. 6 Bond Smoother as 'the best leave-in treatment'.\n\n'The best thing for your hair. Literally a small amount goes a very long way. My hair always feels smoother after using this. This has become a holy grail for my hair,' they continued.\n\nAnother agreed: 'Lovely product, leaves hair feeling silky smooth with no frizz.'\n\nEVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT OLAPLEX NO.6 BOND SMOOTHER What hair type is it for? Olaplex Educator Coco Wilbanks explains that Olaplex No.6 'will work for you no matter what your hair type is. Just remember that a little bit does go a very long way'. Will it weigh my hair down? 'Well, not as long as you use the amount we recommend.' That means a very small amount. Do you use it on wet or dry hair? 'The answer is both, you can use Olaplex No.6 on wet or dry hair,' says Coco. 'You just go ahead and apply wet or dry mid lengths to ends and style as desired.' Will it repair my hair? 'It's going to strengthen, hydrate and protect your hair.' Can I use it every day? Coco explained how 'you're more than welcome to use Olaplex No.6 every day if you want to. But you may not find you have to due to the fact our results last up to 72 hours.' Is it a heat protectant? 'It does have heat protectant in it, but it isn't rated for 450 degrees. So we find that Olaplex No.6 is ideal for protecting when blow drying.'
