(NASA)\n\nOn the brink of Category 5 status, Cyclone Kyarr is a monster. The Indian Ocean beast \u2014 dubbed a top-tier \u201csuper cyclonic storm\u201d by the India Meteorological Department \u2014 is the first storm of such intensity to rage in the Arabian Sea in 12 years.\n\nWhile Kyarr will remain largely out to sea, it\u2019s \u201cvery likely to maintain\u201d intensity through Monday night before beginning to curve west-southwest. It has also helped propel 2019 into the top spot for most active North Indian cyclone season on record.\n\nThe storm now\n\n\n\nA multi-day satellite loop shows the rapid organization and intensification of Kyarr. (NASA)\n\nNow, Kyarr has maximum one-minute sustained winds of 150 mph, with gusts approaching 185 mph in the storm\u2019s eyewall, the zone of most extreme winds. That puts it 7 mph below the threshold of equivalent Category 5 status.\n\nSatellite imagery captured its stunning symmetry Monday morning, Kyarr exhibiting its well-structured banding and translucent, mistily veiled eye. Crystal-clear skies can be seen to the northwest of the storm, where sinking outflow air suppresses any cloud growth. Outflow channels are also visible in the banded, wispy tendrils of cloud protruding like fingers out of the storm\u2019s southern tier.\n\nIt will probably begin weakening within the next 24 hours beginning Tuesday morning, expending its massive energy as it ticks down to tropical storm or Category 1 strength over the weekend.\n\nWhere it\u2019s going\n\n\n\nThe Joint Typhoon Warning Center calls for Kyarr to meander westward while slowly weakening as it approaches the Gulf of Aden. (JTWC)\n\nForecast agencies began tracking the incipient cyclone as early as Oct. 20, when a weak area of low pressure began to materialize over the southeast Arabian Sea. On Oct. 2, it organized into a tropical storm; between Oct. 25 and 26, Kyarr lurched in strength, rapidly intensifying into a Category 3-equivalent storm. Studies have documented an increase in these rapid intensification events likely tied to climate change.\n\nOn the forecast track, Kyarr\u2019s destructive wind field will evade land for the time being, though waves over the open ocean could top 50 or 60 feet.\n\nThe system will pass north of Yemen-owned Socotra before meandering into the Gulf of Aden. Its then rapidly decaying remnants will thread the needle between Somalia and Yemen but could throw a bit of moisture to the ordinarily water-starved landscape to the north.\n\nIf any rain does occur there from this oddly tracking cyclone, it would be highly unusual: Bosaso, Somalia, and Al Mukalla, Yemen, average less than 1 and 2 inches of rain annually per year, respectively.\n\nCoastal Oman could also see a few showers. Otherwise, Kyarr by then should have lost most of its strength, its circulation largely dissipating as it churns westward. Wind is not expected to be a threat on land.\n\nThe significance\n\nIt has been a landmark year for hurricanes in the North Indian Ocean. In fact, it has been the Indian Ocean\u2019s most energetic cyclone season on record, with reliable, satellite-based bookkeeping dating back to 1972.\n\nThus far, 2019 Accumulated Cyclone Energy, or \u201cACE,\u201d has hit 53.9 units. ACE is a measure of how much kinetic energy a cyclone is dishing out through its winds. Consider that the average year-to-date ACE for the North Indian Ocean is no more than 10 units. 2019 has exceeded that benchmark by a landslide; the previous seasonal record was 46.1 ACE units in 2007.\n\nLarge inter-annual variability is expected from year to year, with a \u201cnormal\u201d season very abnormal. Kyarr is the North Indian Ocean\u2019s seventh named storm this season, marking the first time more than half a dozen had spun up in a single season since 1998.\n\n2019 could also claim one more top spot: the most \u201cmajor hurricane days\u201d in a given season.\n\nThough hurricanes are called \u201ccyclones\u201d in the Indian Ocean (and \u201ctyphoons\u201d in the North Pacific), a figure called \u201cmajor hurricane days\u201d tracks the number of days for which one major hurricane-equivalent cyclone roams the North Indian Ocean each season. If two major hurricanes do so simultaneously, each day they both exist would go down as two major hurricane days.\n\nThe record \u2014 5.25 days, achieved in 2007 and 1999 \u2014 may come close to falling. As of Monday morning Eastern time, the 2019 tally was up to 4.5 major hurricane days, 18 hours short of the record, with Kyarr forecast to remain at major hurricane status through at least Tuesday morning.\n\nKyarr also set the record for the lowest barometric pressure ever observed in the Arabian Sea. Its 915 millibar sea-level air pressure is what you would expect in a \u201ctypical\u201d atmosphere if you climbed more than a half mile high. That \u201cdeficit\u201d of air draws air inward like a vacuum, fueling the system\u2019s strong spiral winds.\n\nSuper Cyclonic Storm #Kyarr has the lowest pressure on record in the Arabian Sea, with a central pressure of just 915hPa.\n\n\n\nEstimated winds are joint strongest on record, alongside Cyclone #Gonu pic.twitter.com/JPBwQ77yh7 \u2014 Met Office (@metoffice) October 27, 2019\n\nThe Indian Ocean Dipole\n\nThe banner year for Indian Ocean storms may have gotten a little help from the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), a large overturning circulation in the tropical atmosphere over the Indian Ocean.\n\nWhen the feature is in its positive phase, anomalously warm water pools in the Arabian Sea and west North Indian Ocean, which may help fuel more intense storms. Cooler sea surface temperatures exist farther east, over Australia and the Maritime Continent. This fosters broad rising motion to the west, with subsidence \u2014 or sinking \u2014 to the east. That rising motion enhances convection, shower and thunderstorm activity, with the relatively weak upper-level winds allowing that convective activity to more easily aggregate into a tropical disturbance.\n\nRecently, the Indian Ocean Dipole\u2019s positive amplitude has been at near-record strength. Western waters have been baking, helping spur an active monsoon season across India, as well. Meanwhile, the scales have tipped farther east in Australia, where scant rainfall heralds prolonged drought that has been parching the continent.\n\nThe Australian Bureau of Meteorology expects the Dipole strength to grow even more before breaking some in the next one to two months.\n\nThe Indian Ocean Dipole (temperature gradient across the tropical indian ocean) that is causing half of our drought) is nearing record territory: https://t.co/lB8jHzKCW4 pic.twitter.com/U5TH3d6Nch \u2014 Tamworth Weather (@2340weather) October 23, 2019\n\nMeanwhile, another tropical wave south of Sri Lanka may develop into a tropical cyclone by Saturday.", "description": "It has also helped make 2019 the most active North Indian cyclone season on record.", "authors": ["Matthew Cappucci", "Meteorologist", "Capital Weather Gang", "October At Am", "Matthew Cappucci Is A Meteorologist For Capital Weather Gang.
