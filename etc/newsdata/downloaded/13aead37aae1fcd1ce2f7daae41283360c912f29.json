And after looking at this British off-roader closely, I think I\u2019ve fallen in love.\n\n\u201cThou shalt not covet thy neighbour\u2019s automobile\u201d is the most basic of automotive commandments, but I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ve just broken it, dooming myself to vehicular hell (which, in case you were wondering, is just an eternal road trip at 129km/h in a buzzy compact car in desperate need of an overdrive gear). But you\u2019d understand my sin if you had this incredible green siren luring you from just outside your window:\n\nIt\u2019s a 1995 Land Rover Discovery in the perfect colour both inside and out (it has a tan interior!), and with the perfect transmission \u2014 a five-speed manual.\n\nUnder the hood is a 3.9-litre V8 that apparently doesn\u2019t work.\n\nI say \u201capparently,\u201d because this Discovery belongs to my old friend from high school, Justin, who rather cryptically asked me a few months ago if he could dump his Discovery off at my house. He\u2019d recently left his residence in North Carolina to start a masters program in Minnesota, and since the $3,000 Land Rover Discovery that he\u2019d recently purchased was now kaput for reasons unknown, and he didn\u2019t have space to put it in his college town in MN, he asked me for a favour.\n\nAlso, he sent me the photo below, which, if we\u2019re honest, would have convinced any sane car enthusiast to agree to this rather odd arrangement. Seriously, look at how perfect this Disco is:\n\nThat\u2019s about the extent that I know about this car \u2014 it belongs to my friend, it broke somehow (I don\u2019t have the details), my friend didn\u2019t have the space to store it in his new residence, and now I\u2019m taking it in as an automotive refugee.\n\nThe paint really is as nice as it looks in these pictures, and the body is, overall, in decent shape, with not much visible rust, though I haven\u2019t inspected the underbody yet.\n\nI did check the oil in the 3.9-litre V8, and it looked alarmingly gelatinous. Between that and all the strange oil additives in the back of the vehicle, I\u2019m a bit concerned. Something tells me that, when I try to fire this old Rover V8 up, it\u2019s going to sound terrible.\n\nSince Justin is my good friend, I\u2019m happy to help mend this fabulous off-roader from Solihull. Justin will fly into Detroit every now and then, and we\u2019ll get to work bending wrenches on whatever is wrong with this gorgeous machine. Based on the little he\u2019s told me, the motor \u2014 which has about 273,588km on it \u2014 likely needs a rebuild.\n\nI\u2019ve already got a vehicle that needs its V8 rebuilt, my 1979 Jeep Cherokee Golden Eagle, so this winter may turn my garage into a V8 Motor Rebuild Fest, which honestly sounds pretty exciting. Who knows, once we\u2019ve revived these two big V8 4x4s, maybe we\u2019ll put them head-to-head on some sort of epic off-road journey.", "description": "For reasons I don\u2019t fully understand, a beautiful, green, manual transmission, non-running, 1995 Land Rover Discovery has taken up residence in my backyard.
