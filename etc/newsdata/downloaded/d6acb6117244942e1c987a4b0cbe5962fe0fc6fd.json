The primary driver was player welfare.\n\n\"The tournament has dedicated nurseries where back-up turf is meticulously prepared in line with Rugby World Cup standard.\n\n\"While the look of the turf may not be perfect, as would be expected with a very recent installation, we confident that the pitch will perform superbly.\"\n\nIreland trained normally on Friday, but pictures and videos showed grooves in the Fukuoka surface.\n\nIreland raised concerns over the duress the surface would come under from the set-piece, with the scrum particularly highlighted as a potential problem area.\n\n\u201cYou guys are pretty smart individuals, and you would have seen the pitch yourselves,\u201d said Ireland scrum coach Greg Feek.\n\n\u201cThey told us in an email, both teams know about it. We knew they had had to relay the pitch.\n\n\u201cSo we just went out there, had an inspection and we\u2019ve been given all the assurances by World Rugby that it\u2019s safe to play on and that\u2019s all we can ask for.\n\n\u201cObviously I don\u2019t want to predict anything or cause any more controversy at this stage.\n\n\u201cWe just try to back the players, trust that the pitch will do its job.\n\n\u201cWe were trying to alleviate any concerns when we were out there, but then it\u2019s just a matter of wait and see.\n\n\u201cThe referee will be aware of it, and what\u2019s key is the communication is there.\u201d\n\nSpecialist scrum coach Feek admitted the set-piece battle could well be where the below-par pitch is most tested at the weekend.\n\nAsked whether scrummaging could prove the biggest problem, Feek continued: \u201cThat\u2019s always my concern, no matter whether it\u2019s training or on the match pitch.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes to a static isometric position where there\u2019s a couple of big packs going at it you\u2019re always going to be cautious and ask the questions.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019ve just got to prepare our guys as best we can but make sure the scrums stay up, not just for safety but also for the match too.\u201d\n\nIreland must beat Samoa with a bonus-point to guarantee safe passage to the World Cup quarter-finals.\n\nScotland\u2019s final Pool A clash against Japan in Yokohama on Sunday remains under threat of cancellation due to Typhoon Hagibis.\n\nA cancellation there would see the match ruled a scoreless draw with both teams awarded two points. That would leave Ireland unable to leapfrog Japan to top the pool, so even a bonus-point win over Samoa would then tee up a last-eight clash with New Zealand.\n\nIreland\u2019s strongest grievance with the state of the pitch in Fukuoka revolves around player safety, with the very obvious joins in the sections of turf creating problems for footing or stray studs.\n\nWing Keith Earls suggested the surface perhaps looks more problematic than it feels underfoot.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look great to be honest with you, but it\u2019s flat and quite firm,\u201d said Earls.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel too bad to run on. It\u2019s been inspected and deemed playable and that\u2019s the way it felt out there today.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be the same for both teams, and we\u2019ll just have to get on with the job.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting from PA", "description": "Ireland\u00a0and\u00a0Samoa\u00a0have been assured that the Fukuoka pitch is fit to play ahead of their decisive Pool A\u00a0World Cup\u00a0clash.
