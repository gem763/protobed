A spokesman for the rebels said that the YPG had not fully withdrawn from the border area and that a new round of clashes were expected.\n\n\"Getting the United States out of Syria was the one big interest Turkey, Russia and Iran had in common,\" said Nicholas Danforth, senior visiting fellow at the German Marshall Fund.\n\n\"But now Russia's longstanding support for restoring the Syrian regime's sovereignty will come into direct conflict with Turkey's desire to project its interests and territory in northern Syria,\" he said.\n\nSome 300,000 people have been displaced and 120 civilians killed since Turkey's incursion, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitor.\n\nThe U.S. House voted 403-16 for a resolution calling on Trump to impose sanctions and other restrictions on Turkey and Turkish officials over its offensive in Syria.\n\nIn Geneva, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government condemned what it called the occupation of its land while the Syrian opposition demanded justice at the opening of a U.N.-backed panel meant to usher in reconciliation, political reforms and free and fair elections as a basis for a lasting peace.\n\n(Additional reporting by Daren Butler and Ezgi Erkoyun in Istanbul and Stephanie Nebehay in Geneva; Writing by Jonathan Spicer Editing by Mark Heinrich)", "description": "ANKARA/AMMAN, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Syrian army troops clashed with Turkish forces near the border town of Ras al Ain on Wednesday, Syrian state media reported, as Ankara said it reserved the right to launch another cross-border offensive against the Kurdish YPG militia.
