Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had this to say to the New York congresswoman:\n\nOne of Ocasio-Cortez's constituents loses her mind over climate change during AOC's townhall, claims we only have a few months left: \"We got to start eating babies! We don't have enough time! \u2026 We have to get rid of the babies! \u2026 We need to eat the babies!\" pic.twitter.com/uVmOnboluI \u2014 Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 3, 2019\n\nAt this point we\u2019re not sure if the woman was commenting sincerely or if it was some sort of stunt:\n\nThe fact that we don\u2019t know if that woman was serious or not shows how insane the left has gotten. Save the planet! Eat the babies! https://t.co/FctBTfC86Z \u2014 Jessica Fletcher (@heckyessica) October 4, 2019\n\nBut in any case, Rep. Ocasio-Cortez later tweeted that she was concerned:\n\nHey everyone! We had a fabulous town hall tonight & I\u2019ll be highlighting some moments from it. At one point I was concerned there was a woman in crisis & want to ensure we treat the situation compassionately. Let\u2019s not mock or make a spectacle. &let\u2019s work on Medicare for All! \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 4, 2019\n\nAnd after that, when the video made the rounds on Twitter and other social media, AOC blamed the right\u2019s reaction (including a tweet from President Trump calling AOC a \u201cwack job\u201d) for possibly contributing to the person\u2019s \u2014 well, let\u2019s just say \u201cnegative\u201d outlook and suggested course of action:\n\nThis person may have been suffering from a mental condition and it\u2019s not okay that the right-wing is mocking her and potentially make her condition or crisis worse. Be a decent human being and knock it off. \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) October 4, 2019\n\n\u201cConservatives pounce.\u201d We\u2019ve heard that before. It\u2019s probably to be expected, but still, many found it extremely self-unaware on AOC\u2019s part that if the woman has truly been scared to the point of that particular over-reaction about climate change that AOC wouldn\u2019t take any responsibility:\n\nIf she\u2019s got mental problems they are exacerbated by the scare mongering you are a part of re the climate. If you want to be compassionate tell the truth. \u2014 Dondi's Girl (@dantes_daughter) October 4, 2019\n\nMaybe you should stop scaring people especially the feeble minded into thinking we only have 12 years left to live\u2026 Take some damn responsibility! \u2014 I Yam What I Yam (@Nvr4Get91101) October 4, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s certainly not the \u201cright-wing\u201d that\u2019s trying to scare the pants off people about climate change.\n\nWhen you tell people they're all literally going to die if we don't do something within 12 years to save the planet, you inspire this kind of derangement. Grow up and stop blaming everyone else for everything that's wrong and own the big part you're playing in this madness. https://t.co/hliciLMFpL \u2014 CDB (@quietnolonger) October 4, 2019\n\nYou gotta admire how she can turn herself not rejecting a proposal to actually eat babies into an attack against the right-wing. https://t.co/ZUaEPJjN9G \u2014 Jaroslav \u017den\u00ed\u0161ek (@ZenisekJaroslav) October 4, 2019\n\nMaybe be a decent human being and stop fueling their paranoia? It's your hyperbole that's driving that, not right wing trolls. \u2014 Nathan (@LabelsAreLazy) October 4, 2019\n\nSelf-awareness is hard for some.", "description": "\"You are part of this derangement.\"", "authors": ["Doug P.", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Ocasio1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
