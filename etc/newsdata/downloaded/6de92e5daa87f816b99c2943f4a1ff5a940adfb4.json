She was okay and probably scored five out of 10 as opposed to the 10 out of 10 in her alleged photos.\"\n\nAs he goes on to describe the encounter, the reviewer seems disgruntled at the woman refusing to take part in particular sex acts or kissing.\n\nHis review paints a picture of a man left totally aggrieved by the concept that a sex worker has the right to say no to sex acts she does not want to do.\n\nHis review says: \"In short she was totally useless, absolutely crap at her job and to be recommended only to my very worst enemies.\n\n\"The whole thing was a rip-off disaster and she and her 'pimp' should be avoided at all costs.\"\n\n(Image: LiverpoolEcho WS)\n\nAnother man who took to the site to complain about the perceived standard of sex work logged on to describe an encounter in \"central Liverpool\".\n\nThe venue, while unspecified, is described as having plenty of parking and being \"very easy to get into discretion wise\".\n\nHowever, despite describing the woman involved as attractive and \"clean\", he goes on to launch into a troubling rant - again entirely prompted by a sex worker saying no to things she did not want to do.\n\nPosting on the site, the reviewer says: \"Terrible. I first phoned her and she said it was okay to come at 5pm and to text when I got there. I wanted to see if she was okay with the things I wanted to do so text her a list which included, letting me [carry out various sex acts].\n\n\"I made it clear I was asking because I wanted her to be comfortable. Waited five minutes and a text came back saying 'yes I like all these things.'\n\n\"Great, but when I got there she was very nervous, so was I, so that didn't help me at all, I decided to give her a massage thinking it might make us both feel more comfortable and ended up [performing a sex act on her].\n\n\"When it came to [another sex act] she now said it was with condom only. Not wanting to ruin things I said okay, thinking I could still [perform another sex act on her] as I wanted.\n\n\"She said no, again not wanted to ruin it I asked her to [perform another sex act] and that was a no too. At this point she started pretending she didn't understand anything and it was a complete turn off.\n\n\"Just to elaborate a little, I am a young man, considered good looking and in good shape so this wasn't a case of me being an old man and turning her off.\"\n\nHe reels off all the things she listed on her profile, before saying: \"As I was leaving I explained she was a fraud and asked for a discount, that was a straight no and it was becoming apparent that she did understand English perfectly.\n\n\"She isn't worth visiting, she just wants to get you there take your money and do nothing for it.\"\n\nPerhaps what's most worrying about this review is the idea that the sex worker is allowed no room to change her mind.\n\nIn a sexual encounter that doesn't involve the exchange of cash, basic rules of consent dictate that a woman is entirely entitled to say she wants something, then change her mind and decide she doesn't.\n\nBut when this comes to sex work, this exchange shows a man left feeling entitled to do whatever he wants because he paid \u00a360 for the pleasure.\n\n(Image: LiverpoolEcho WS)\n\nSex work is just that - work. A transaction takes place. Money is exchanged for services.\n\nBut unlike any other form of paid work it involves incredibly intimate acts and regardless of money exchanging hands, a woman should feel safe and comfortable to say no.\n\nSelling sex for \u00a360 and being asked for a discount at the end of it is a demeaning exchange - but sadly it's not an isolated incident based on these reviews.\n\nThe review section includes a section where punters can describe the location, whether they're visiting a brothel or meeting up with an escort in a hotel.\n\nSome of the same sites creep up over and over again in the reviews - and the locations are far from inspiring.\n\nOne is based on an industrial estate in north Liverpool, another is located up a fire escape above a business premises in Aintree.\n\nThe mundane descriptions of parking and access appear somewhat incongruous in the context of reviews detailing sordid sex acts.\n\nOne review says: \"The parlour is under new management. It is one of the very few parlours still operating in Scouseland.\n\n\"Access is up a fire-escape in rather open public view. Lots of easy parking. The new madam is obliging and welcoming. The rooms are large, but rather sparse and basic rather than cozy.\"\n\nAnother man, who met an escort in an apartment, says: \"Plenty of safe on street parking nearby (pay and display), and the apartment block is discreet with an intercom system at the main entrance.\"\n\nWhile most of the reviews talk about parlours, brothels or hotel visits on a one-on-one basis, one reviewer describes a sex party hosted in the city centre.\n\nPaying \u00a380 to be involved, the reviewer writes: \"Liverpool is pretty poor for parlours and mostly similar for escorts. I expect most people drive or goto Manchester or Bolton for their fun.\n\n\"I've never seen any parties being held in Liverpool, so was really surprised when I saw that [these two women] were planning one for November.\n\n\"Great location, city centre, near to the business side of town and one of the train stations. Quiet, parking nearby also.\n\n(Image: Colin Lane/Liverpool Echo)\n\n\"Buzzed on the intercom, safe and easy to get into - no awkward getting past hotel reception. very smart inside, main living room to relax in and have drinks and nibbles. One big bedroom and bathroom.\n\n\"Since it was the first time for both girls in Liverpool, it was a little quiet, not a huge turnout, next time hopefully more - so this was a great chance for those that turned up to enjoy ourselves.\"\n\nWhile many of the reviews offer a worrying glimpse into the reality experienced by sex workers in the city, others paint a different picture.\n\nReviews posted of many Liverpool escorts describe women who are entirely in control and who are treated with respect by their clients.\n\nOne of the most recent reviews on the site comes from a man who spends long periods away and recently arrived back in the UK.\n\nDescribing the escort involved, he says: \"[She] is lovely - truly cute, confident, bubbly.\"\n\nHe adds: \"In the room she quickly changed into the most stunning, very classy dress, and it was clear that the pictures were correct.\"\n\nAfter having sex, the man describes how he had \"a few cuddles\" and a \"good chat\" with the woman, saying she alone is \"worth a trip to Liverpool\".\n\nMany men on the site say they were looking for a \"girlfriend experience\" with a woman who would offer them more than a quick sexual encounter.\n\nIn one review, a man writes: \"[She] did everything to provide the girl friend experience - I was not rushed, she was so nice and I will be going back to see her again. Treat her with respect and you will get the best out of her. Thanks again.\"\n\nFrom the seedy entries by men posting worrying reviews to the mundane parking information and glowing feedback from happy customers, PunterNet is a strange place.\n\nThe reviews catalogued on the site can often make for uncomfortable reading - but they offer a rare view into a world that largely operates in the shadows of society.", "description": "PunterNet sees men posting 'reviews' of sex workers they have slept with", "authors": ["Emilia Bona", "Image", "Liverpoolecho Ws", "Colin Lane Liverpool Echo"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20574572.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Secrets-from-the-grim-sex-work-site-where-men-review-Merseysides-brothels.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
