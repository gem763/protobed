The iOS 13.1.1 rolled out at the end of September.\n\nPreviously, the Taiwan flag emoji was already not present for iPhones in mainland China. An article on the Apple blog Hiraku says that any device model with the \"CN\" or \"ZA\" region, meaning China and Hong Kong, will not be able to use the Taiwan flag emoji. The same applies if users have a device from another region but has been set to Hong Kong or Macau.\n\nBusiness Insider has reached out to Apple for comment.", "description": "Hong Kong and Macau users reported the the Taiwan flag emoji has disappeared for iPhone users in iOS 13.1.1 or above.", "authors": ["Rosalie Chan"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d98f46e528879224e337176?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
