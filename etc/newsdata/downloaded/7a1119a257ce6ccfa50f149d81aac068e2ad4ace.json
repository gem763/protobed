(http://pyrogenesis.com) (TSX-V: PYR) (OTCQB: PYRNF) (FRA: 8PY), a high-tech company, (the \"Company\", the \u201cCorporation\u201d or \"PyroGenesis\") that designs, develops, manufactures and commercializes plasma atomized metal powder, plasma waste-to-energy systems and plasma torch products, today announced that further to its press release dated June 20th, 2019, with respect to the $3.64M sale of a Non-Military Land-Based Waste Treatment System, the Client has not complied with the terms of the Sale, thus the Company has decided, after numerous extensions, to terminate the Contract.\n\n\n\nAccording to the terms of the Sale, the Client was obligated to pay a total of 40% in down payments (approx. $1.46M) before July 31st, 2019. After many deadline extensions provided by PyroGenesis to cure this default, and numerous failures by the Client, the most significant of which was to not pay on time, the Sale (including the limited territorial exclusivity agreement) is now terminated. To date, the Client has paid approx. $839,370 and these payments have been retained by PyroGenesis pursuant to the General Terms and Conditions of the Sale.\n\n\u201cRegretfully in the course of doing business, this type of event happens at times. However, PyroGenesis secures itself from these risks by having payments managed in such a way that our projects remain cash flow positive throughout their completion. The amounts received to date will be accounted for in Q3-2019,\u201d said Mr. P. Peter Pascali, President and CEO of PyroGenesis. \u201cFurthermore, PyroGenesis is actively reviewing the judicial and extra-judicial rights and recourses available to it, so that it may protect and safeguard its rights and interests with respect to the Client\u2019s failure to fulfill its contractual obligations. On a brighter note, we will be re-engaging with other potential clients who were interested in this product line, but with whom we could not continue discussions due the Terms and Conditions under the Contract which we have just terminated.\u201d\n\nOf note, PyroGenesis\u2019 land-based waste system transforms waste to syngas, a gaseous fuel which can then be used to make electricity, heat, or fuels, as required by the end-user. Using PyroGenesis\u2019 system, the inorganic fraction of the waste is converted into a glassy slag which is inert, non-toxic, and has been demonstrated to be suitable as a building material, and even jewelry.\n\nAbout PyroGenesis Canada Inc.\n\nPyroGenesis Canada Inc., a high-tech company, is the world leader in the design, development, manufacture and commercialization of advanced plasma processes and products.
