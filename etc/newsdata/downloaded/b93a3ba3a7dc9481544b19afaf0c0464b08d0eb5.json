This exhibition is to break down these stereotypical images and show that there are no limits to what you are capable of, how you can look or how you can dress based on your gender.\"\n\nThe images exhibited were created in the aftermath of an event in 2012 when the Swedish city of Gavle displayed new posters that aimed to reflect the life and people in the city. Days after the event, a citizen raised concerns about the posters.\n\nAfter investigating the complaint, government officials found that most of the pictures depicted boys and men engaging in a variety of activities while the girls and women watched on passively. In addition, there were no elderly, citizens of other races, same-sex couples or people with disabilities featured. The city realized that the posters were not a true reflection of society and had the posters taken down.", "description": "Gender roles in focus at photo exhibition", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/14/5da3d936a310cf3e97a11713.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
