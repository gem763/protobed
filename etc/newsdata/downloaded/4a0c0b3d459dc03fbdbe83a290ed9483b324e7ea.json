Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) walked onto the stage and immediately declared her pronouns as \u201cshe, her and hers.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe, her and hers? Mine too,\u201d Cuomo responded, eliciting what appeared to be some groans from the studio audience.\n\n\u201cAlright,\u201d Harris replied after a moment\u2019s silence.\n\nCheck out the exchange here:\n\nKAMALA HARRIS: My pronouns are she, her and hers.\n\n\n\nCHRIS CUOMO: Mine, too.\n\n\n\nHARRIS: Alright. pic.twitter.com/09gJ2pygjd \u2014 Dan Diamond (@ddiamond) October 11, 2019\n\nCuomo tweeted an apology soon after, saying he \u201cshould not have\u201d responded in the way he did. \u201cI am an ally of the LGBTQ community, and I am sorry because I am committed to helping us achieve equality,\u201d he wrote.\n\nPLEASE READ: When Sen. Harris said her pronouns were she her and her's, I said mine too. I should not have. I apologize. I am an ally of the LGBTQ community, and I am sorry because I am committed to helping us achieve equality. Thank you for watching our townhall. \u2014 Christopher C. Cuomo (@ChrisCuomo) October 11, 2019\n\nThe backlash was swift on Twitter, however, where LGBTQ advocacy groups called out the prime time anchor. GLAAD tweeted \u201cit was so disappointing\u201d for Cuomo to mock Harris\u2019 declaration \u201con such a major stage.\u201d\n\nKamala Harris declared her pronouns on such a major stage and she should be applauded but instead it was so disappointing for Chris Cuomo to mock it in that moment. #EqualityTownHall #PowerOfOurPride \u2014 GLAAD (@glaad) October 11, 2019\n\nThe National Center for Lesbian Rights, meanwhile, tweeted that \u201cpeople\u2019s pronouns are not a punchline.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a year where LGBTQ Americans are finally being recognized on the national Presidential stage, making jokes about gender pronouns is beneath your dignity. Please do better in the future,\u201d the organization added.\n\nDear @ChrisCuomo, people\u2019s pronouns are not a punchline. In a year where LGBTQ Americans are finally being recognized on the national Presidential stage, making jokes about gender pronouns is beneath your dignity. Please do better in the future. #EqualityTownHall \u2014 National Center for Lesbian Rights (@NCLRights) October 11, 2019\n\nOthers called Cuomo\u2019s comment \u201cUNACCEPTABLE,\u201d \u201cnot okay\u201d and \u201csuper gross.\u201d\n\nYUCK. @ChrisCuomo just made a joke that his pronouns are She/Her/Hers.\n\n\n\nBigotry isn\u2019t cute especially at an #EqualityTownHall. \u2014 Blair Imani (@BlairImani) October 11, 2019\n\nKamala: My pronouns are she/her/hers by the way.\n\n\n\nCuomo: Yeah, mine too.\n\n\n\nUNACCEPTABLE. \u2014 Blair Imani (@BlairImani) October 11, 2019\n\nAnyone else think it's uncool for Chris Cuomo to treat pronouns like a joke at a debate centered on LGBTQ issues? \u2014 Rebecca Green (@wordofgreen) October 11, 2019\n\n.@ChrisCuomo needs to apologize for mocking @KamalaHarris\u2019 use of pronouns. For a self-proclaimed ally, he sure demonstrated how utterly out of touch with our community he actually is. \u2014 Phillip Picardi (@pfpicardi) October 11, 2019\n\nSuper gross of Chris Cuomo to answer \"mine too\" when Harris said her pronouns were she/her/hers \u2014 Melissa Gira Grant (@melissagira) October 11, 2019\n\nSenator @KamalaHarris comes onstage, and introduces her pronouns as \"she/her.\"\n\n\n\nModerator @ChrisCuomo jokes back \"Me too!\"\n\n\n\nYikes. Do better, Chris. #EqualityTownHall \u2014 Lambda Legal (@LambdaLegal) October 11, 2019\n\nWoops - biggest gaffe of #EqualityTownHall now belongs to @ChrisCuomo who appears not to understand what stating one's pronouns means, or to think it's funny, or something. \u2014 Jay Michaelson (@jaymichaelson) October 11, 2019\n\nDid Chris Cuomo just make a pronoun joke? pic.twitter.com/NaZQAvNWH3 \u2014 \ud83d\udc7b 169 A.D.2d 254 (N.Y. App. Div. 1991) \ud83d\udc7b (@AnthonyMKreis) October 11, 2019\n\nAs soon as she is introduced, @KamalaHarris immediately shares her pronouns. Then @ChrisCuomo promptly ruins the important moment. #EqualityTownHall pic.twitter.com/GqjVXBwmfx \u2014 Zack Ford (@ZackFord) October 11, 2019\n\nMy feed is filled with gasp reactions of @ChrisCuomo \u201cjoking\u201d about pronouns, while it might seem funny to him, it has cost thousands of lives for people who don\u2019t respect people\u2019s pronouns.\n\n\n\nI hope HE uses this to make an apology BUT also to educate viewers #EqualityTownHall \u2014 Samy Nemir-Olivares (@Samynemir) October 11, 2019\n\nI hope folks at @CNN and @HRC check him on this and he makes a public apology. Fuck that. You don\u2019t get to moderate a historic LGBTQ town hall, barely be able to say LGBTQ, and make a pronoun joke @ChrisCuomo https://t.co/EtHKEIbwdo \u2014 Eliel Cruz (@elielcruz) October 11, 2019\n\nNow up: Kamala Harris.\n\n\n\nShe comes out and says, \u201cMy pronouns are \u2018She her hers.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nChris Cuomo actually responded with a \u201cjoke,\u201d saying: \u201cMine too.\u201d\n\n\n\nWTF. \u2014 Chris Geidner (@chrisgeidner) October 11, 2019\n\nIt's cool that the dem nominees had an LGBTQ town hall where nobody challenged Chris Cuomo's disrespectful trans joke. \u2014 Alan de Bottom (@badwithcolour) October 11, 2019\n\nIn what world did Chris Cuomo think saying \"mine too\" when @KamalaHarris stated her pronouns were she, her, and hers was funny? #NotAJoke #EqualityTownHall \u2014 Katt \ud83d\udc31\ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 (@katt_resists) October 11, 2019\n\nWhen Chris Cuomo jokes about pronouns, trans and nonbinary people suffer. I already live in a reality where my pronouns are treated like a joke. The last thing I want to hear during an LGBT+ forum is a cis, presumably straight white man make a mockery of trans people. \u2014 Mx. Spooky 4 Jesus (@famedfairy) October 11, 2019\n\nTranslation: I am apologizing to minimize backlash. I think the pronouns in your bio are a joke.#CNNTownHall #cnn #Cuomo https://t.co/V4vHxhbpbq \u2014 Childfree Libertarian (@ColoLibertarian) October 11, 2019\n\nChris Cuomo just mocked Sen.
