Macquarie is building disability housing with NDIS funding and is the only financial services representative on the NDIA\u2019s Specialist Disability Accommodation (SDA) Reference Group.\n\nOn September 21, The Saturday Paper went further, revealing that Nugent was also conducting NDIA business on Macquarie\u2019s email server. For that reason, incredibly, the federal government has no access to her (outgoing) correspondence \u2013 a fact confirmed by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. Hillary\u2019s emails, Helen\u2019s emails \u2013 it\u2019s Benghazi all over again!\n\nThe NDIA told Morry Schwartz\u2019s masthead that \u201cDr Nugent is a non-executive director. Non-executive directors typically do not have an email address linked to the organisation of which they are a director.\u201d\n\nBut Dr Nugent is non-executive chairman, and not only has an NDIA email address, but has two \u2013 one in her name and the other in her title\u2019s. We pointed this out to the agency and, by return, received this enigma: \u201cThe Agency\u2019s previous response was simply meant to clarify that it is not unusual for Non-Executive Directors to have an email address not linked to the organisation of which they are a Director.\u201d Which is revisionism of outlandish audacity; bureaucratic doublespeak destined for a picture frame.", "description": "It is not the highest standard of corporate governance for the personal data of NDIS participants to be transmitted to or from an investment bank.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/12f4602f6132b3c6b8eff7a667490592a90882df", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
