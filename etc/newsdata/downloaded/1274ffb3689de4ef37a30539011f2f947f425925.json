And this could put downward pressure on prices in California,\u201d Cororaton said.\n\nDean Jones, principal and owner at Seattle-based brokerage Realogics Sotheby\u2019s International Realty, said the focus was shifting to \u201csecondary gateway markets\u201d such as Seattle, because of their strong economies and relative affordability.\n\nJones said Seattle was wooing international buyers with properties selling for a third or half the price of real estate in San Francisco or Los Angeles.\n\nOne 41-year old businessman from Tianjin in China, who is looking for properties with a U.S. broker and asked not to be named, told Reuters he hoped the trade war would be resolved soon and that he was considering waiting it out before buying.\n\n\u201cThe United States is a livable country where the natural environment, climate, education, medical care, commodity prices are all satisfying,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201c(But) if the trade war keeps intense, it may affect my income and I will probably reduce (my investment).\u201d", "description": "U.S. home sales to Chinese buyers are likely to drop to an eight-year low in the year ending next March as a prolonged Sino-U.S. trade war hits demand, according to estimates from Chinese real estate website Juwai.com.", "authors": ["Dominic Roshan Kl", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
