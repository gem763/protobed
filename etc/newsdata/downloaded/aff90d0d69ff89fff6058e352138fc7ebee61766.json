And I revisited the issue again last year.\n\nI\u2019m not the only one making these arguments. In a column for Reason, Stephanie Slade explained why Pope Francis is deeply misguided.\n\nI\u2019ve had some harsh words to describe Pope Francis. \u2026the pontiff\u2019s ignorance of basic economics has led him to a bad conclusion about which public policies are best able to reduce the crushing yoke of poverty in the world. \u2026as a matter of empirical fact, markets are the single greatest engine for growth and enrichment that humanity has yet stumbled upon. \u2026He seems to be arguing that an outlook that places the individual above \u201cthe common good\u201d is morally suspect. \u2026his statements betray a shallowness in his understanding of the philosophy he\u2019s impugning. If he took the time to really engage with our ideas, he might be surprised by what he learned. \u2026what Pope Francis calls an \u201cantisocial\u201d paradigm\u2026is better known by another name: the liberty movement, a cooperative and sometimes even rather social endeavor among people who cherish peaceful, voluntary human interactions.\n\nSadly, there\u2019s zero evidence that Pope Francis has learned any economics since taking up residence in the Vatican.\n\nFor instance, he just visited Mauritius, a small island nation to the east of Madagascar.\n\nHis economic advice, as reported by Yahoo, was extremely primitive.\n\nPope Francis on Monday urged Mauritius, a prosperous magnet for tourists and a global tax haven, to shun an \u201cidolatrous economic model\u201d that excludes the youth and the poor\u2026 While the island is a beacon of stability and relative prosperity, Pope Francis honed in on the struggles of the youth\u2026 \u201cIt is a hard thing to say, but, despite the economic growth your country has known in recent decades, it is the young who are suffering the most. They suffer from unemployment, which not only creates uncertainty about the future, but also prevents them from believing that they play a significant part in your shared history,\u201d said the pope. \u2026Since independence in 1968, Mauritius has developed from a poor, agriculture-based economy, to one of Africa\u2019s wealthiest nations and financial services hub. \u2026General unemployment is low compared to the rest of the continent at 6.9 percent in 2018 according to the World Bank\u2026\n\nI\u2019m glad the article acknowledges that Mauritius has been economically successful.\n\nThough I\u2019m frustrated by the failure to explain why.\n\nSo I\u2019ll redress that error of omission by showing that Mauritius dramatically expanded economic liberty in the 1980s and 1990s. The nation\u2019s absolute score jumped from 5.11 in 1980 to 8.07 in the most-recent estimates from Economic Freedom of the World.\n\nIt\u2019s done such a good job that Mauritius is now ranked as the world\u2019s 9th-freest economy.\n\nSo what has greater economic liberty produced?\n\nMore national prosperity.\n\nA lot more. Based on the Maddison data, you can see that living standards (as measured by per-capita GDP) have tripled over the past three-plus decades.\n\nI confess that I\u2019ve never been to Mauritius.\n\nSo maybe it\u2019s possible that the country is filled with \u201cidolotrous\u201d folks who think of nothing but money.\n\nBut I\u2019m guessing that people in Mauritius are just like the rest of us. But with one key difference in that they\u2019ve been following the recipe for growth and prosperity.\n\nToo bad Pope Francis instead believes in the Peronist model that has wreaked so much havoc in Argentina.\n\nP.S. The Pope should read Stephanie Slade\u2019s column. Walter Williams and Thomas Sowell also should be on his list.\n\nP.P.S. Methinks Pope Francis should have a conversation with Libertarian Jesus. He could start here, here, and here.", "description": "I first\u00a0opined about Pope Francis in 2013, when I told .10/02/2019 12:55:35PM EST.", "authors": ["Daniel J.
