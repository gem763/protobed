I\u2019d never met him before and I\u2019ll be honest, I\u2019d never seen a human being walk in as big as I did that day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018It\u2019s a difficult situation because Dibsy had heart condition.\n\n\u2018His mum broke down in tears and said, \u201cPlease, I don\u2019t want to bury my son\u201d. I\u2019ve got three kids, I know how that feels.\u2019\n\nMike added poignantly: \u2018It was life and death.\u2019\n\nWhen Piers, 54, accused Mike of fat-shaming Dibsy, the fitness worker defended himself and said: \u2018I was bullied as a kid, I hate bullies and I think fat-shaming is a form of bullying.\u2019\n\nDibsy used to weigh 40 stone and consumed 11,000 calories a day (Picture: ITV)\n\nLocal takeaways agreed to ban Dibsy (Picture: ITV)\n\nDibsy later revealed how he consumed 11,000 calories a day eating fast food from his local takeaways.\n\nBut after a push from Mike, he agreed to allow the restaurants to put up posters stating they would refuse to serve him food, supporting his weight loss mission.\n\n\u2018I\u2019d get up in the morning and eat two or three sandwiches with a pint of milk or juice. Then an hour later I\u2019d be having a sandwich again, then McDonald\u2019s and other takeaways, just every two hours I\u2019d eat the wrong things,\u2019 Disby recalled.\n\nPiers was almost speechless for once (Picture: Rex Features)\n\nHe also admitted: \u2018It was the harsh reality of seeing a picture and realising what I put my mum through. I was selfish.\u2019\n\nWith sheer determination, Dibsy was able to lose 20 stone and will undergo operations to tighten loose skin as a result of his weight loss.\n\nDespite congratulating his guest on the incredible achievement, Piers still thought that Dibsy was being \u2018fat-shamed\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Whichever way you dress this up, that is a form of fat-shaming. You\u2019re basically saying look at this fat guy, don\u2019t serve him fat food,\u2019 the TV host said.\n\nGood Morning Britain airs weekdays at 6am on ITV.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
