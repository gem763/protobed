Of these, 1.4 million have been unique contactless credit and debit cards.\n\nCubic said that in geographical terms, it's the world's largest contactless system covering 40,000 square kilometres.\n\n\"We are now travelling down an exciting new path towards frictionless end-to-end journeys with just one payment for both private and public transport,\" senior vice president and managing director for Cubic in Asia-Pacific Tom Walker said. \"Contactless is moving Australia towards what we would call 'transport nirvana', allowing commuters to access a seamless, integrated multi-state transport network with no prior knowledge of the local ticketing systems.\"\n\nIn announcing the function was coming back in July, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia -- which developed the core payment infrastructure -- said it would extend the benefits earned by Opal users to those using their own accounts.\n\nDaily, weekly, and Sunday travel caps are now in line with Opal caps; the weekly travel reward of half-price travel after completing eight trips can now be earned; Opal transfer discounts will apply; and off-peak pricing for train travel will also be extended to those not using an Opal card.\n\n\"What was previously a transit gate is now essentially a payment terminal, demonstrating yet another example of how technology is enabling faster and more convenient experiences for the community and smarter, more connected cities,\" CBA's executive general manger of Business Customer Solutions Clive Van Horen said.\n\nCubic also recently scored a AU$371 million contract to upgrade Queensland's public transport ticketing system to allow for contactless payment via bankcards, mobile phones, and wearables.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nNSW looks to biometric payments and Netflix-like public transport subscriptions\n\nPaying for transport like shopping at Amazon Go and the 'death' of the timetable as 'mobility-as-a-service' becomes the new way to travel in Sydney.\n\nMoving from planes, trains, and automobiles to 'mobility-as-a-service': A peek into the future of transport in Sydney\n\nThe state of New South Wales is preparing for a future of work underpinned by autonomous vehicles, smart highways, and regional hubs.
