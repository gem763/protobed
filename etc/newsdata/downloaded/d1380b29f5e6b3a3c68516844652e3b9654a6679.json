One side of the car was completely caved in. She couldn\u2019t drive it away and it looked like a total write off. Obviously she was shaken up at the time but Coleen was just thankful no one was hurt.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe source added that Coleen was \u2018secretly happy\u2019 about the crash \u2013 as she could now bag herself a new motor and finally get rid of the \u2018mumsy\u2019 Honda.\n\nFollowing the report, the mum-of-four tweeted: \u2018Thank you for the messages asking if I am ok\u2026 the car crash story was completely wrong\u2026. I wasn\u2019t involved in a crash \u2026the car was damaged by another car.\n\n\u2018Someone on my private Instagram seen the picture and is telling or selling stories to a certain newspaper.\u2019\n\nShe added: \u2018It\u2019s happened several times now over the past couple of years. It\u2019s sad to think Someone, who I have accepted to follow me is betraying for either money or to keep a relationship with the press.\u2019\n\nFast forward to October, and Coleen \u2013 who is married to Wayne Rooney \u2013 has claimed that Rebekah was the one sharing stories after watching Coleen\u2019s Instagram.\n\nAnd it may have been a man called Dave who gave Coleen the idea, as back on 27 January, he replied to the WAG: \u2018Make a false story tell ppl different things see which 1 comes out = find the culprit [sic].\u2019\n\nDave\u2019s now changed his bio to read: \u2018Detective who recently solved the coleen rooney vs rebekah vardy case.\u2019 Take a bow.\n\nColeen shared fake Instagram stories to catch her followers out (Picture: Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images)\n\nColeen shared a statement reading: \u2018For a few years now someone I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing The Sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and my family \u2013 all without my permission or knowledge. After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\n\n\u2018To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except ONE account. (Those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\u2019\n\nColeen continued: \u2018Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did! The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the latest story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to. Now I know for certain which account/individual it\u2019s come from.\n\nRebekah has denied the allegations (Picture: Photo/PA Images via PA Images)\n\n\u2018I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them. It\u2019s\u2026\u2026 Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\u2019\n\nThe latest story Coleen alleges that Rebekah gave to the press was that her Cheshire home had flooded during Storm Lorenzo.\n\nThe report cited a source as saying that Coleen had pushed back the completion date on the renovation to the family home due to the damage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe source said: \u2018The house is Wayne and Coleen\u2019s dream, so to see it being damaged has been horrible for them.\u2019\n\nColeen also cited a story from Heat magazine, claiming that the star wanted to return to television.\n\nRebekah, who is pregnant with her fifth child, has denied the allegations.\n\nShe tweeted: \u2018As I have just said to you on the phone, I wish you had called me if you thought this. I never speak to anyone about you as various journalists who have asked me over the years can vouch for.\n\n\u2018If you thought this was happening you could have told me & I could have changed my passwords to see if it stopped. Over the years various people have had access to my Insta and just this week I found I was following people I didn\u2019t know and have never followed myself.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not being funny but I don\u2019t need the money, what would I gain from selling stories on you? I liked you a lot Coleen and I\u2019m so upset that you have chosen to do this, especially when I\u2019m heavily pregnant.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m disgusted that I\u2019m even having to deny this. You should have called me the first time this happened.\u2019\n\nGot a showbiz story?
