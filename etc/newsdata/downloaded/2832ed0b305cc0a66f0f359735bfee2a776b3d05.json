Local media outlet Apple Daily reported that he remained in a critical condition.\n\nIn total, 66 people were injured and more than 180 arrested, according to the South China Morning Post.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

the UK foreign secretary, condemned the use of live rounds, saying that \u201cwhilst there is no excuse for violence, the use of live ammunition is disproportionate, and only risks inflaming the situation\u201d.\n\nEarlier in the day, tens of thousands attended a march on Hong Kong Island, defying a police ban and risking arrest for participating in an unauthorised assembly. Demonstrators dressed in black chanted the now-enshrined protest anthems of \u201cfight for freedom! Stand with Hong Kong!\u201d and \u201cHong Kong add oil!\u201d \u2013 a Hong Kong saying akin to \u201cKeep going!\u201d, as they marched in the sweltering heat of the day.\n\nUS and British flags waved above the crowds, without what appeared to be a single Chinese flag in sight.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

This is another way for us to express and magnify what we are fighting for.\u201d\n\nTwenty five public transport stations were closed throughout the day and dozens of shopping malls announced they would be closed after the police issued a statement on Monday warning of violent acts planned for National Day.\n\nSmaller rallies were held in six districts, in front of government offices, temples and playgrounds. Clashes began early in the day in Tuen Mun district, when protesters threw bricks and other random objects at officers who responded with tear gas and water cannons.\n\nThe police posted images of an officer injured by corrosive liquid that they say \u201crioters\u201d threw during the clash in Tuen Mun.\n\nLocal broadcaster TVB said that one of its reporters sustained similar injuries.\n\nIn other districts, protesters blocked major roads and formed defensive lines with umbrellas and metal street railings that they connected with zip ties. Some protesters armed themselves with hiking sticks and stalks of bamboo.\n\nIn San Po Kong district, where protesters set small fires in the street, a university student named Truman, who was not taking part in the protests, said that an officer pointed his shotgun directly at him and others after they jeered at police from an elevated footbridge.\n\n\u201cWe had nothing but our words,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the police to respond that way to unarmed people, it makes me feel that they think they are above the law, that they have no guidelines anymore.\u201d\n\nAs clashes continued to escalate into the night, multiple media companies, including local broadcaster RTHK and the South China Morning Post, pulled reporters from the streets as tear gas and rubber bullets were employed.\n\nMany arrests were carried out violently as protesters set fires and threw petrol bombs in neighbourhoods on the peninsular side of the territory after Hong Kong Island protest sights were largely cleared by riot police.\n\nThe citywide protests initially broke out in June over a controversial bill that would have allowed extraditions to China.\n\nThe bill has since been withdrawn, but protesters\u2019 demands have grown to include an independent inquiry into police violence and electoral reforms.\n\nAfter more than a century as a British colony, Hong Kong was returned to China in 1997. The semi-autonomous territory was assured a high degree of autonomy until 2047 but many residents fear that basic rights and freedoms enshrined in the city\u2019s constitution are under threat.\n\nThe clashes in Hong Kong contrasted with anniversary celebrations in Beijing, which included a parade showcasing the country\u2019s military might.\n\nAmong those attending was Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam, who demonstrators have repeatedly called on to resign due to her failure to handle the crisis.\n\nHong Kong chief secretary Matthew Cheung told hundreds of guests at a reception that the city has become \u201cunrecognisable\u201d due to the violence.", "description": "Activists\u00a0have vowed to fight on after a man was shot with a live round by police during violent clashes in Hong Kong, which saw tens of thousands of protesters take to the streets on China\u2019s National Day.", "authors": ["Viola Gaskell"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/01/17/hong-kong-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
