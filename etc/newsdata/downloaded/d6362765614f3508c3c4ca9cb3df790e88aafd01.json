They often are lured by more lucrative contracts, pushed out by jittery executives or just grow tired of the grind.\n\nThe abrupt and immediate departure of Shepard Smith from Fox News falls into none of those categories. On Friday afternoon, the longtime host delivered an emotional farewell to his viewers: \u201cRecently, I asked the company to allow me to leave Fox News,\" said the 55-year-old Smith, who had been with the network since its 1996 launch. \u201cAfter requesting that I stay, they obliged. . . . This is my last newscast here. Thank you for watching today and over the decades. . . . Even in our currently polarized nation, it\u2019s my hope that the facts will win the day. That the truth will always matter, that journalism and journalists will thrive.\u201d\n\nWith that, the host bid adieu to one of the few \u2014 in the view of some, the only \u2014 redoubts of legitimately straight news at Fox News. Network founder Roger Ailes, who died in 2017, designed Fox News in a way that mimics and corrupts the traditional division between news and opinion at American newspapers. When opinion hosts such as Sean Hannity, Bill O\u2019Reilly and Tucker Carlson have twisted the facts beyond repair, the network has always responded that they\u2019re leveraging their liberties as opinion people.\n\nOn the other side of Fox News reside news shows such as the morning program \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom,\" \u201cSpecial Report\" with Bret Baier, and \"The Story\u201d with Martha MacCallum. And then there was Smith\u2019s program, set apart from all other Fox News programs for the blunt honesty with which the show\u2019s host fact-checked President Trump with every last broadcast. Smith routinely made headlines among media observers with his straight delivery and reliance upon easily documented facts to rebut Trump and his allies. No-nonsense delivery of news during the Trump era made Smith\u2019s program a significant aberration at Fox News \u2014 not to mention a sore point for die-hard fans of Hannity & Co., as the Erik Wemple Blog discovered upon visiting a Fox Nation event in Arizona earlier this year.\n\nTo have one anchor discussing the hard facts of Trumpism, while other anchors devise every excuse in their conspiratorial heads \u2014 well, that would create some fissures in even the most rough-and-tumble news organization. And so it was at Fox News, as Smith and Hannity and Carlson engaged in public feuding in regard to one another\u2019s coverage of the president. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t work there,\" said Smith of his opinion counterparts back in March 2018, noting that they exist \u201cstrictly to be entertaining.\u201d\n\nThat, actually, is too kind: They exist to enrich themselves, too, all the while deceiving the American public.\n\n\u201cClueless\u201d is how Hannity described Smith\u2019s comments.\n\nThe feelings have lurked: In late September, Smith butted heads with Carlson after a guest on Carlson\u2019s program called Fox News\u2019s Andrew Napolitano a \u201cfool\u201d for some critical remarks he\u2019d made about Trump. That Carlson didn\u2019t challenge that characterization was \u201crepugnant,\u201d concluded Smith. To which, Carlson said, \u201cUnlike maybe some dayside hosts, I\u2019m not very partisan.\" Though Vanity Fair\u2019s Gabriel Sherman reported that Fox News management told Smith to \u201cstop attacking Carlson,\u201d network spokeswoman Irena Briganti denied to this blog that it was addressed with Smith. \u201cAt no time did anyone \u2014 including anyone in management or a third party \u2014 speak to Shepard Smith regarding that matter. Anything to the contrary is entirely false and wildly inaccurate,\u201d said Briganti in a statement.\n\nIn his public-facing remarks, Smith made no mention of these tensions. Under the agreement he reached with the network, Smith won\u2019t be reporting elsewhere for the \u201cnear future\" \u2014 perhaps a sign that he really wanted out of a network that, especially in its most lucrative hours, works efficiently, enthusiastically and tirelessly as a propaganda bullhorn for Trump. \u201cShepard Smith Reporting\u201d will be replaced with \u201cFox News Reporting,\u201d which will rely on anchoring from Trace Gallagher and Jon Scott, among others.\n\nNeither of those men furnishes the gravitas that Smith brought to the 3 o\u2019clock hour. He\u2019d carved out his own hour of honesty at Fox News on account of unique circumstances: He\u2019d been there forever, he\u2019d covered everything, he could communicate with an audience. There\u2019ll be no replicating what Smith accomplished, and there\u2019ll be no mistaking the implications. Facts are losing their tenuous foothold at Fox News.\n\nRead more from Erik Wemple:\n\nWhat did NBC News know about Matt Lauer?\n\nDoes Tucker Carlson\u2019s audience know he\u2019s taking them for fools?\n\nNBC News boss sends memo defending against Ronan Farrow allegations\n\nReporters at CNBC and NBC News become tangled in leak investigation", "description": "An era at Fox News is over.", "authors": ["Erik Wemple", "Media Critic With A Focus On The Ups", "Downs", "Downs Of The Cable-News Industry.", "Media Critic", "October At Pm", "The Washington Post'S Media Critic", "Focuses On The Cable-News Industry.
