(TWLO) could have further to fall in the weeks ahead. Twilio is a cloud communications platform and the charts and indicators are sending signals that lower prices may lie ahead. Let's check.\n\nIn the daily bar chart of TWLO, below, we can see that prices have been under selling pressure from late July. Prices are trading below the declining 50-day moving average line and below the cresting 200-day line. The trading volume has been heavier in September and October telling us that investors are voting with their feet.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been weakening since the end of July and tells us that sellers of TWLO have been more aggressive. Downside price momentum has slowed from September to October even though prices have made new lows for the move down. This situation or condition is a bullish divergence but it does not mean that prices will rally.\n\nIn the weekly bar chart of TWLO, below, we can see that prices are trading below the cresting or topping 40-week moving average line. There is a zone or area of potential support in the $90-$70 area from late 2018. This area could be tested in the weeks ahead.\n\nThe weekly OBV line shows softness the past three months. The MACD oscillator is below the zero line in a sell mode but the two lines that make up this indicator have begun to narrow toward a potential crossover and cover shorts signal.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of TWLO, below, we can see that the software has determined we are looking at a distribution (selling) pattern and has projected a potential downside price target of $91.\n\nBottom-line strategy: TWLO has been in a downtrend from late July and while the decline may have begun to slow it does not look over. Stand aside until support is tested in the low $90's or until a new base is formed.", "description": "TK...TWLO", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "Twilio Investors Are Voting With Their Feet", "This Cloud Stock Could Weaken Further In The Weeks Ahead", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Doug Kass", "Gary Berman", "Bob Lang", "Carolyn Boroden"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/6f0fc06f-6c4f-11e9-b5b3-03c4504aa620.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
