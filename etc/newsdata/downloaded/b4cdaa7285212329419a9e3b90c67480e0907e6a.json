This year\u2019s biggest \u2014 the Kincade Fire \u2014 has destroyed 206 structures over 76,825 acres so far.\n\nRemarkably, there have been no fatalities. Last year, a single fire that destroyed the town of Paradise killed 86 people.\n\nBut the threat has not passed. Dangerous winds were set to fan flames through Thursday, and some of California\u2019s worst blazes have struck as late as December.\n\n\u201cWe are still at this point not out of the woods in terms of fire season, and we won\u2019t be until there is significant rainfall in both northern and southern California,\u201d said Crystal Kolden, a University of Idaho scientist who specializes in wildfires.\n\n\u2013 Unique dangers \u2013\n\nThis year\u2019s wildfires have been exceptional in several ways, however, with rare \u201cextreme\u201d wind warnings issued around Los Angeles.\n\nFirefighters face a highly unusual challenge \u2014 fires sweeping north and south California simultaneously. The state typically moves firefighters around to focus resources where needed. This year, forces have been split in half.\n\nOctober wildfires in arid southern California are common. But due to climate change, even northern regions have still not had rainfall, said Kolden.\n\n\u201cThe wind is nothing new. But it will be incredibly dry when those winds come,\u201d she said.\n\nIronically, heavy rain back in the spring made the situation worse, said Thomas Wieczorek, head of the Center for Public Safety Management.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good and bad news. While it did end the drought in some parts of the state, it accelerated new growth that has now dried out.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, Californians have faced power outages. These have likely prevented some fires, but have left residents without electricity or internet, and in the dark about the next inferno threat.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this sense of being fairly helpless. And this is unprecedented in that way,\u201d added Kolden.\n\n\u2013 Planning, caution, luck \u2013\n\nIf the wildfires have so far been less destructive than 2017 and 2018, it begs the question \u2014 why?\n\nMultiple factors likely all contribute.\n\nWhile winds are roaring, temperatures in California this week are not especially high.\n\nAnd a lot of proactive work has been done to reduce ignition risk.\n\n\u201cCal Fire hired additional firefighters in preparation for this year, and so far it\u2019s been lucky that fires have been caught somewhat early on, before they\u2019ve had a chance to explode,\u201d said Wieczorek.\n\nWith memories of last year\u2019s fatalities fresh, members of the public could simply just be acting more cautiously.\n\nAnd another aspect is hard to measure.\n\n\u201cOne factor is of course just pure luck, in terms of where the ignition starts and how things go,\u201d said Kolden.\n\n\u2013 Future danger \u2013\n\nEven if 2019 ends up less destructive, omens for the future are not good. Several factors besides climate change put California at greater risk with each passing year.\n\nSuccess preventing fires in recent decades has meant massive buildup of flammable vegetation. One major fear is that the Kincade Fire could leap over Highway 101 into a tinder-box region that hasn\u2019t burned since the 1940s.\n\nCalifornia\u2019s housing boom also raises the risk. As the population soars, newly built homes made of wood provide additional fuel for flames.\n\nAnd while power companies absorb much of the blame for recent fires, other human activity is far more culpable.\n\nA recent study found equipment use \u2014 for instance, weed-trimmers striking rocks \u2014 was the main human cause of fire in California, followed by cigarette butts, campfires and arson.\n\nThe more people live in California, the more often these will occur.", "description": "Los Angeles (AFP) \u2013 Destructive wildfires have ripped through California, threatening homes and famous landmarks, and forcing power outages that", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/30/767b54_terrible-in-terms-sheer-size-destruction-wildfires-in-california-are-not-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
