In an attempt to win their support, he had told them he did not favour \u201carcane procedures\u201d like prorogation.\n\nThey are particularly furious about Johnson\u2019s communications strategy, in which a moderate official line that the prime minister will abide by the law is undermined by \u201cgovernment source\u201d quotes suggesting he will seek to circumvent it and refuse to ask for a Brexit delay.\n\nITV cited one of the government sources saying Johnson would obey the law but: \u201cThat is NOT the same as \u2018the PM will ask for a delay\u2019! HOW we comply with the Benn Act is the real question, and also what would be in our SECOND letter.\u201d\n\nJohnson will attempt to revive morale among his MPs after the humiliation of this week\u2019s supreme court ruling by appearing before the backbench 1922 Committee on Thursday morning.\n\nHe is still insisting that he wants to get a deal. But even some advisers in No 10 are worried that the hardline guerrilla threats of no deal associated with Johnson\u2019s senior adviser Dominic Cummings are backfiring.\n\nThe Guardian view on Boris Johnson: guilty but he won\u2019t go | Editorial Read more\n\nMPs are reluctant to criticise Johnson publicly with an election on the horizon but several indicated there would be willingness to act against their own leader in order to stop a no-deal Brexit.\n\nA leading one nation Tory MP said: \u201cA real sense of doom among Tory MPs is starting to emerge now. Even the ones who gave him the benefit of the doubt. With prorogation, it was a big gamble and it hasn\u2019t paid off. And I think in his position you have to take responsibility for that.\n\n\u201cThere is a feeling that he should be given a bit more time but people\u2019s patience is starting to run out. There is a small but growing sense that he may have to step down. He has got a bit of grace as it\u2019s still the end of September but if we get to the first two weeks of October and there\u2019s no progress then people will start to become more jittery and think about their options.\u201d\n\nAnother one nation Tory said MPs were pinning their hopes on a deal but they could try to replace Johnson with another candidate rather than face the possibility of a vote of confidence that could lead to Jeremy Corbyn entering Downing Street.\n\nIt is unclear whether Johnson could be subject to a confidence vote held by the 1922 Committee within his first 12 months of office or whether half the party could be sufficiently disillusioned with him to vote for ousting him. The most critical 21 MPs have already been thrown out of the party for refusing to endorse Johnson\u2019s threats of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nHowever, some MPs think a party confidence vote is still possible if 15% of the parliamentary party request one and there are other theories circulating about whether he could be persuaded to step aside and cast himself as a \u201cBrexit martyr\u201d who refused to request an extension from the EU.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Johnson took an aggressive stance towards the opposition in the House of Commons, prompting large numbers of his Eurosceptic backbench supporters to break into noisy applause. Other Tory MPs stayed stony-faced without clapping.\n\nAntoinette Sandbach, one of the 21 rebel MPs who had the whip withdrawn, pointedly reminded the prime minister how he had once said he would try to build consensus for a deal across the Commons, which the EU would want to see before giving him any concessions. \u201cCan he update the house on the moves he is making to build consensus?\u201d she asked.\n\nMPs in the One Nation group, which is led by Damian Green, the former de facto deputy prime minister, said they were so worried about No 10\u2019s lack of efforts to build such a cross-party consensus that they were opening up their own channels with Labour MPs representing leave areas to see where the potential lies for a majority for a possible deal.\n\nSenior members of the cross-party MPs for a Deal group were meeting on Wednesday to consider how best to put pressure on Johnson to secure an agreement with the EU27, and table it in parliament.\n\nLabour MPs involved said they have had conversations with a \u201csensible\u201d Conservative MP, who they believe is acting as a conduit to Downing Street.\n\nJohnson\u2019s team had previously appeared lukewarm about the prospects of getting a deal; but after the Benn bill made a no-deal Brexit much more difficult to achieve, MPs sense that the prime minister is increasingly boxed in with no other options.\n\nAs consternation grows among soft Brexit Conservatives, Michael Heseltine, the former Conservative deputy prime minister, told Channel 4 News that he thought Johnson should resign. \u201cIt\u2019s almost inconceivable for me to watch a Conservative government behave in this way,\u201d he said.\n\nHeseltine said he was dismayed to see how his party have reacted to the supreme court ruling and that \u201cin any normal circumstances, the prime minister would have to go\u201d.", "description": "Centre-right MPs already open to trying to get rid of PM if no progress on a Brexit deal soon", "authors": ["Rowena Mason", "Heather Stewart"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11f973b1ca62d9e8dac226013910a82698bebdc6/0_0_2200_1319/master/2200.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ff0634d6b354bbbbda1e594f3fe74f8f", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
