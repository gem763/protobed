She has undergone 10 rounds of chemotherapy and had knee replacement surgery.\n\nAMERICAN AIRLINES APOLOGIZES AFTER 'DANCE MOMS' STAR ABBY LEE MILLER FALLS FROM WHEELCHAIR AT AIRPORT\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a position where her spine is stable so that\u2019s an important part of recovery,\u201d Miller\u2019s oncologist, Lawrence Piro, said on the show. \u201cThat\u2019s really good news.\"\n\n\"Secondly, the surgery happened very quickly, so the time of pressure on the spinal cord and the nerves was as minimized as possible,\" he added. \"And every evidence is that she should be able to recover. But I think that the most important ingredient in her recovery, and what is going to determine her possibility for the future, is her own ability to work at rehab. Three weeks ago we replaced her knee so that would stop being an impediment to standing, bearing weight and walking.\u201d\n\nMiller called walking onstage \"scary\" and told the audience to \u201cput your hands together and pray.\u201d\n\n\u2018DANCE MOMS\u2019 STAR ABBY LEE MILLER SHARES GRAPHIC PHOTO FOLLOWING \u2018EMERGENCY SURGERY\u2019 ON HER BACK\n\nThe entertainer previously told People magazine in May that she's cancer-free.\n\n\"The cancer is completely gone,\u201d Miller revealed. \u201cI\u2019m more than grateful. I\u2019m thankful. I was always grateful but I think I must say \u2018Thank you\u2019 a hundred times a day because I have to rely on strangers; someone to open the door, someone to get the hanger off the rack at the department store, someone to pick up my phone if I drop it. How am I supposed to get it? I\u2019m very grateful and thankful to strangers that have been so kind.\u201d\n\nAs for what keeps her going, Miller said that she feels \"like I have more to do.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cI have goals,\u201d she continued. \u201cI have dreams and I want to see them come to fruition.
