But one group is working to change that.\n\nFairytale Physical Therapy is made of students, physical therapists and performers who volunteer their time to put on performances of popular fairy tales at children\u2019s hospitals across the country.\n\nWhat\u2019s magical about Fairytale Physical Therapy is that it combines the magic of theater with physical therapy by having the patients learn choreography.\n\n\u201cThe movements that we do in the choreography are therapeutic movements. That means it comes from a physical therapist mindset,\u201d Fairytale Physical Therapy co-founder Jenna Kantor explained.\n\n\u201cSomething as simple as marching can be activating your abdominals and also working your balance, which is something [the patients] don\u2019t get to do on a regular basis because they are spending most of their time sitting or laying in a bed,\u201d she said.\n\nABC News\n\nKantor co-founded Fairytale Physical Therapy nearly four years ago with her classmate, Katie Schmidt, when she was a physical therapy graduate student at Columbia University. The two shared a passion for musical theater and wanted to creatively combine their desire to perform with their physical therapy skills.\n\nFrom that passion, Fairytale Physical Therapy originally consisted solely of physical therapists, but has expanded over the years and brought on professional performers as well as other volunteers.\n\nABC News\n\n\"Being in the hospital is really hard,\u201d Sharon Granville, director of Child Life and Creative Arts Therapy at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, told \u201cGMA.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou might possibly have an experience that could be a little scary. And having a chance to come, and enjoy a fun show with singing and acting is just a nice way to spend an afternoon,\" she said.\n\nABC News\n\nThe group recently performed \u201cThe Snow Queen\u201d at New York-Presbyterian Komansky Children\u2019s Hospital in New York City. Kantor, alongside six other professional performers, recreated a rendition of Disney\u2019s \u201cFrozen\u201d with recognizable characters and sing-alongs from the musical.\n\nNearly half a dozen children attended the show along with their parents.\n\nRocio Manrique, whose daughter is a patient at the hospital, was moved to tears by the performance.\n\n\u201cNow that I saw the performance with the people, the artists who have done all this ... one feels more hopeful of fighting against the children's disease, as if you have the illusion of seeing something that someone sings that will bring you joy, a smile,\u201d she said.\n\nABC News\n\nFollowing the show, children get a coloring book with directions on how to recreate the choreography they learned so they can continue to heal and recover. The actors also take time to do arts and crafts with the kids.\n\nKevin Joseph, 11, is a patient at the hospital who spent time with his favorite character, Olaf, who even drew a portrait of him.\n\n\u201cThis was really a fun experience and they did a really good job,\u201d Kevin told \u201cGMA.\u201d\n\nABC News\n\nFor the performers, though, it all comes back to one thing: the kids.\n\n\"Even though I can sit there and sing and feel so good in rehearsals, once you're in front of the kids, it does not matter,\u201d Kantor said. \u201cYou are giving that escape and those healthy movements to them, and that is why it is going for more than four years now.\u201d\n\nShe hopes that Fairytale Physical Therapy will continue to grow and encourages anyone who would like to get involved to reach out. Eventually, she\u2019d like Fairytale Physical Therapy to be able to offer its services at every children\u2019s hospital.", "description": "Fairytale Physical Therapy, made of physical therapists and volunteers, performs fairy tales at children's hospitals that integrate choreography to promote movement.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/fairytale-Group-abc-ps-190925_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
