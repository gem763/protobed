Servers are generally found in countries where there are lax or non-existent laws on website content and intellectual property infringement, and hosting providers do not interfere with what content or services their clients provide when leveraging their bandwidth.\n\nLegal demands are ignored when sent directly to hosting providers. Child pornography forums, illegal trading, malware distribution, and scam operations are only some of the activities that are linked to this form of dedicated hosting.\n\nSee also: The Dark Web: How much is your bank account worth?\n\nThe raids, taking place on Thursday in Traben-Trarbach, Germany, resulted in the arrest of seven individuals suspected of being part of the business.\n\nLocal reports suggest that over 600 officers were involved in the operation. Large quantities of cash, documents, mobile devices, and over 200 servers were seized, according to Deutsche Welle.\n\nCNET: Amazon bolsters Alexa privacy after user trust takes a hit\n\nA 59-year-old has been marked as the main suspect.
