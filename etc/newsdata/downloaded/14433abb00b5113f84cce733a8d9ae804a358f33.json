We also note that condominium prices are soaring due to a significant drop in inventory,\" she added.\n\nSales by geographic area\n\nGeographically, all six main areas of the Montreal CMA registered a strong increase in sales in September, with Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu (+31 per cent) leading the way. This was followed by the North Shore (+25 per cent), Vaudreuil-Soulanges (+22 per cent), the South Shore (+15 per cent), the Island of Montreal (+9 per cent) and Laval (+7 per cent).\n\n\n\nSales by property category\n\nAcross the CMA, as is now the norm, condominiums registered the largest sales increase in September, as condo transactions jumped by 15 per cent (1,381 sales) compared to September of last year.\n\nSales of single-family homes registered an equally strong increase, as sales of this property category also jumped by 15 per cent (1,888 sales).\n\nAs for plexes with 2 to 5 dwellings, sales rose by 11 per cent with a total of 386 transactions.\n\nPrices\n\nProperty prices across the CMA rose significantly in September, particularly for condominiums and plexes. In fact, new records were set for all three property categories.\n\nFor condominiums, the median price increased by 10 per cent compared to September 2018 to reach $290,000.\n\nThe median price of plexes jumped by 10 per cent to reach $555,750.\n\nAs for single-family homes, the median price rose by 6 per cent to reach $355,000.\n\nNumber of properties for sale\n\nThe number of properties for sale in the Montreal CMA fell for a 48th consecutive month in September, as there were 16,830 active residential listings on the Centris system. This is a 21 per cent decrease compared to last year, and the largest drop that has ever been registered for a month of September since data started being collected in the year 2000.\n\nAverage selling times\n\nSelling times currently reflect market conditions that are particularly favourable to sellers, for all three property categories combined. The last time that the average selling time for single-family homes (62 days, -15 days) and condominiums (76 days, -22 days) was this low for a month of September was back in 2004. As for plexes (72 days, -5 days), the last time the average selling time was this low in a month of September was back in 2005.\n\nAbout the Quebec Professional Association of Real Estate Brokers\n\nThe Quebec Professional Association of Real Estate Brokers (QPAREB) is a non-profit association that brings together more than 12,700 real estate brokers and agencies.
