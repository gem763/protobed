Not only is this far from the truth \u2013 women are beautiful regardless of stomach size \u2013 but it is also a rarity to have a perfectly flat stomach.\n\n\u201cThis belief is setting women up for failure because a woman\u2019s stomach isn\u2019t meant to be flat,\u201d Ashley Wood, RN, BSN, contributor at Demystifying Your Health, told Grateful, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nOver and over again, I see friends and strangers killing themselves to suck any bit of bulge from their stomach, feeling inadequate any time they see a stomach roll. For years, I felt the same way, terrified to put on a bathing suit, feeling exposed and ugly, desperate to fit the standards society had told me I needed to meet.\n\nIt feels like every day I see another article that perpetuates this narrative, promising a certain food or exercise move will finally allow me to achieve this mystical flat stomach. It suggests that any problems in life would be solved if I could simply accomplish that goal. Well, I can\u2019t, and that\u2019s actually OK. In fact, it\u2019s great! Letting go of a goal you can\u2019t achieve and allowing yourself to focus on those you can gives you back control of your life.\n\nThis may be hard to believe after what feels like a lifetime of hearing that a flat stomach is gold. So, as with any myth, the best way to tackle it is with facts. Here\u2019s why some women are not biologically built for a flat stomach.\n\nMore: What you should know about your oral microbiome\n\nWOMEN HAVE EXTRA PADDING TO PROTECT VITAL ORGANS\n\nThere is a very big reason why some women cannot achieve a flat stomach, and it is called reproductive organs.\n\n\u201cThe design of a woman\u2019s anatomy is different than men,\u201d Wood says. \u201cIn addition to having room for digestive organs, like your stomach, liver and intestines, it has to have space for your reproductive organs and needs extra padding to protect all of these vital organs. This process of naturally storing fat cells in the stomach area begins during adolescence and young adulthood in preparation for childbearing later in life.\u201d\n\nYes, right when we enter adolescence and start being told exactly what our body should look like is when it starts to take on a mind of its own.\n\nVisceral fat vs. subcutaneous fat (Photo: Barks_japan, Getty Images)\n\nMen and women also lose fat in different ways.\n\n\u201cWhen men lose weight, they tend to lose their visceral fat, which is the layer of fat behind their abdominal muscles, while women typically lose subcutaneous fat, which is the layer of fat just below the skin,\u201d said Caleb Backe, a certified personal trainer and health expert for Maple Holistics. \u201cBoth your visceral and subcutaneous fat contribute to your achieving a flat stomach, which is why some women find it harder to do so than others. Furthermore, factors like hormone regulation play a role in storing visceral fat, which is why many women are not biologically built for a flat stomach.\u201d\n\nTRUST HOW YOUR BODY IS BUILT\n\nJust like it protects your organs, each thing your body does is for a reason. As you fight what your body does, it puts you at odds with what it needs, sometimes to the point of danger.\n\nAriel Johnston, a registered dietitian who specializes in treating eating disorders, cautions clients that they'll likely see fat accumulate around their stomachs.\n\n\u201cWhen weight restoring through increased nutrition, the weight is distributed unevenly and goes to the stomach first,\" she said. \"This is amazing because it is the body\u2019s way of telling us that it needs the extra fat layer there to protect itself. The mechanism behind this isn\u2019t fully understood, but after adequate time and nourishment, the fat is redistributed throughout the body.\u201d\n\nYes, your stomach will go up and down, looking different at certain times than others. \u201cIt is normal for the stomach to expand after a big meal to accommodate for the food nourishing your body. This isn\u2019t necessarily bloating; just your body doing it\u2019s work to break down food in the stomach,\u201d Johnston says.\n\nHaving a flat stomach is not the key to being healthy or happy. There are some days in which I see my stomach poke out in my shirt or still cringe at first look when I\u2019m in my undergarments, but life is simply too short to go after something unattainable while hating myself.\n\n\u201cI tell my clients that a slightly rounded tummy or some rolls is normal and that their worth is so much more than what they look like in a swimsuit,\u201d Johnston says.\n\nMore: 6 breast cancer survivors share the biggest lessons they learned\n\nInstead of diets and habits that promise women something they don\u2019t need to and can\u2019t achieve, let\u2019s start celebrating women for who they are.\n\nStop worrying about what your tummy looks like; instead, focus on how it feels.
