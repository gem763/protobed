He is seen above in court Tuesday\n\nSabrina Strong, an attorney for Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries, gestures as she speaks during a hearing to settle disagreements between Johnson & Johnson and the State\n\nBalkman said the correction will be reflected in a final order that he issues at a later date.\n\nOklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter declined to comment on the judge's decision, saying it would be inappropriate to do so while the judge was still working on the final order.\n\nThe company also sought a reduction in the judgment based on pre-trial settlements totaling $355 million that the state reached with Oxycontin-maker Purdue Pharma and Israeli-owned Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.\n\nJudge Balkman said the correction will be reflected in a final order that he issues at a later date\n\nAttorneys for Oklahoma, however, argued that the $572 million judgment covered only the first year of the state's estimated cost of abating the opioid crisis and that the judge should make clear that he could order the company to pay more in the future.\n\n'We'll take one year. But the evidence showed it will take more than that,' attorney Brad Beckworth told the judge. 'This (opioid crisis) has been going on for more than a decade, and it's gotten worse.'\n\nAttorneys for the state have argued abating the crisis would cost between $12.6 billion for 20 years and $17.5 billion over 30 years. Attorneys for Johnson & Johnson have said that estimate is wildly inflated.\n\nFollowing a seven-week trial this summer, Balkman ruled Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries helped fuel the opioid crisis with an aggressive and misleading marketing campaign that overstated how effective the drugs were for treating chronic pain and understated the risk of addiction.\n\nOklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter says opioid overdoses killed 4,653 people in the state from 2007 to 2017.\n\nOklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter during a hearing Tuesday about the opioid crisis in Oklahoma\n\nDuring the trial, Hunter called Johnson & Johnson a 'kingpin' company that was motivated by greed and noted that two of the company's subsidiaries produced much of the raw opium used by other manufacturers to produce the drugs.\n\nAttorneys for the company have maintained they were part of a lawful and heavily regulated industry subject to strict federal oversight during every step of the supply chain. Lawyers for the company have said the judgment was a misapplication of public nuisance law and previously filed an appeal with the Oklahoma Supreme Court.\n\nOklahoma's case against opioid drug makers is being closely watched because it was the first state opioid case to make it to trial and could help shape negotiations over more than 2,000 similar lawsuits filed by state, local and tribal governments consolidated before a federal judge in Ohio.", "description": "Oklahoma judge\u00a0Thad Balkman made a $107 million miscalculation when he ordered the company to pay $572 million to help the state's opioid crisis.", "authors": ["Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/03/19761110-0-image-a-16_1571194050385.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
