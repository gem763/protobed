Back then, the world was 25 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than it is today.\n\nThe model\u2019s results, which align with geological evidence, suggest that when carbon-dioxide levels in the atmosphere increase, additional increases in CO2 then have an even bigger impact on the climate than they would have otherwise. That doesn\u2019t bode well for our own climate future.\n\nGetting the Eocene modeled right for the first time\n\nSimulating the conditions of a world long gone can make climate models \u2013 which scientists use to predict of the future of climate change \u2013 more accurate.\n\n\u201cWe are constantly using these climate models to do future projections. And the future climate, we know, could be very different than the one we are experiencing and observing,\u201d Jiang Zhu, the lead author of the study and a postdoc fellow at the University of Michigan, told Insider.\n\ncaption During the Eocene, carbon-dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere were nearly double today\u2019s levels. source Jay Matternes/WikiMedia Commons\n\nDuring the Eocene, Zhu said, the atmosphere had more than double the concentration of carbon dioxide that it does today. But until now, models just didn\u2019t simulate it correctly.\n\nSo Zhu and his coauthors opted to use a model that the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) relied on in its 2014 report (the group\u2019s most recent assessment).\n\nThat model\u2019s calculations turned out to match up with what scientists already knew based on geological evidence: that the Earth had warm temperatures globally during the Eocene, with only a small difference in temperatures between the poles and the equator. The epoch began with a temperature rise of 5 to 9 degrees Celsius.\n\nBefore the Eocene even started, global sea levels were estimated to be 40 to 100 meters higher than they are currently. Then sea levels rose even more for millions of years due to a lack of ice on the poles. In the Arctic Circle, there were crocodiles, palm trees, and sand tiger sharks.\n\nThe Eocene could give us clues about what\u2019s to come\n\nIf we don\u2019t curb greenhouse-gas emissions by the end of the century, it\u2019s predicted that the concentration of CO2 in Earth\u2019s atmosphere could reach 1,000 parts per million; that\u2019s the same as the level during the early Eocene.\n\nWe are currently at 415 parts per million \u2013 the highest level ever in human history.\n\nsource Getty Images/Kevin Frayer\n\nThe Eocene isn\u2019t the only era in Earth\u2019s history that\u2019s important to study to better anticipate future climate change, though. A study published last year suggests that climates like the one during the Pliocene era will become the norm as soon as 2030.\n\nZhu said his study shows how using a combination of geological data and climate models can provide the clearest image of the past \u2013 and the future.", "description": "Business Insider - During the Eocene era, Earth's atmosphere had much more CO2.
