I don\u2019t think anybody could understand that, but in all fairness I had no idea, which probably sounds difficult to understand \u2026 but when I first met my now-husband my friends were really happy because I was so happy, but my British friends said to me, \u2018I\u2019m sure he\u2019s great but you shouldn\u2019t do it because the British tabloids will destroy your life\u2019.\u2019\n\nMeghan, 38, said that, as an American, she \u2018very naively\u2019 thought this did not make any sense, adding: \u2018I\u2019m not in tabloids. I didn\u2019t get it, so it\u2019s been complicated.\u2019\n\nThe couple have faced mounting criticism after reportedly taking four private jet journeys in 11 days this summer, rather than opting for commercial flights, despite speaking out on environmental issues.\n\nMeghan, 38, said that, as an American, she \u2018very naively\u2019 thought this did not make any sense (Picture: ITV)\n\nSinger Sir Elton John said he provided the couple and their baby son Archie with a private flight to \u2018maintain a high level of much-needed protection\u2019 (Picture: ITV)\n\nMeghan is suing the Mail on Sunday over a breach of privacy after it published a private letter between her and her estranged father (Picture: ITV)\n\nSinger Sir Elton John said he provided the couple and their baby son Archie with a private flight to \u2018maintain a high level of much-needed protection\u2019.\n\nHe also hit back at what he called \u2018these relentless and untrue assassinations on their character\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeghan is suing the Mail on Sunday over a breach of privacy after it published a private letter between her and her estranged father.\n\nHarry has also begun legal action at the High Court in relation to the alleged illegal interception of voicemail messages by Sun, News of the World and Daily Mirror journalists.\n\nDuring the couple\u2019s recent southern Africa tour, journalist Tom Brady also asked Meghan if she could continue to cope with the pressure and what would happen if she could not.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex during their African Journey (Picture: ITN)\n\nReferring to Prince Harry as H, she said she has tried to put up with the scrutiny (Picture: ITV)\n\nShe told him: \u2018In all honesty I have said for a long time to H \u2013 that is what I call him \u2013 it\u2019s not enough to just survive something, that\u2019s not the point of life. You have got to thrive. You have got to feel happy, and I think I really tried to adopt this British sensibility of a stiff upper lip.\n\n\u2018I tried, I really tried, but I think what that does internally is probably really damaging, and the biggest thing that I know is that I never thought this would be easy but I thought it would be fair, and that is the part that is hard to reconcile but (I) just take each day as it comes.\u2019\n\nBradby pointed out that her position of privilege, wealth and fame comes with scrutiny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeghan responded: \u2018When people are saying things that are just untrue, and they are being told they are untrue but they are allowed to still say them, I don\u2019t know anybody in the world who would feel that\u2019s OK and that is different from just scrutiny.\n\n\u2018I think the grass is always greener. You have no idea. It is really hard to understand what it\u2019s like.\n\n\u2018The good thing is that I have got my baby and I have got my husband and they are the best.\u2019", "description": "The Duchess of Sussex has described the past year as a member of the royal family as 'hard' and said her British friends warned her not to marry Harry.
