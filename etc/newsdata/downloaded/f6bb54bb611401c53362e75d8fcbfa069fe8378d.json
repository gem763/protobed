I felt a bit sorry for the people that have these views,' he added.\n\n'I feel it is not a reflection of the views of the whole country and I feel that the appropriate steps were taken.\n\nEngland regrouped at half time and decided to come out and play the second half of the game\n\n'It didn't affect my feeling but I was aware that we had to follow the right protocols, and not think it does not affect me so I won't report it.\n\n'I have a duty to people that don't have a voice or that perhaps are abused and it does hurt or get to them. I don't know why it does not affect me, it just doesn't.'\n\nWhile step two of UEFA's protocol was not initiated, Mings was satisfied with the process and pleased with how the players stuck together.\n\nWhen asked if he felt the protocols had worked, he said: 'They did, yes.\n\n'I didn't hear anything in the second half. I can't speak for everybody, but I can speak for myself. So I think fans were removed and if that was the case then I think the protocol has definitely worked.\n\nThe UEFA racism protocol was followed and reached stage two of three during the first half\n\n'We were here to play football, so we didn't want to really be having these conversations but it was important we made a collective decision.\n\n'We represent a lot of people and we have to not just make a stance for ourselves, but we have to make it clear these things won't be accepted. So it was important to consult everyone at half-time and everybody made the decision, and we played on the whole game.'\n\nHaving found out he was in line to make his debut, Mings flew out some of his family at short notice to cheer him on - a decision he does not regret despite the events of the night.\n\n'I'm immensely proud, it is a dream come true for sure,' he said of his debut.\n\n'It is the pinnacle of English football, everybody dreams of representing their country, everybody knows my journey. I was extremely proud and had my friends and family in the crowd, so I don't think they will let it overshadow this.\n\n'I was absolutely happy they were here tonight and it will be a memory we will talk about for a long, long time - a good memory.'", "description": "Tyrone Mings revealed he heard racist abuse in the warm-up ahead of his England debut as a 6-0 thrashing of Bulgaria was overshadowed by abhorrent behaviour from the home fans.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/00/19715764-0-image-a-41_1571095919295.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
