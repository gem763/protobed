Should men who look like this be taxed? (Image: W. W. Bode/Public Domain)\n\nBeards\u2014once associated strictly with hermits and wizards\u2014have become one of the hottest fashion accessories for men in the past few years, with celebrities, athletes, and style-conscious men around the globe growing, grooming, and styling their facial hair to match the latest trends. But despite their current popularity, beards remain deeply divisive and this week, one British barber and businessman has floated a radical proposal to discourage hirsute faces, or at least make some money off the men who refuse to renounce them.\n\nAnthony Kent is proposing a UK beard tax; surprisingly, he\u2019s not the first person to have the idea.\n\nThe proposal, a \u00a3100 tax on the bushiest of beards, with a reduced \u00a350 fee for those with more modest growth, has a historical basis. According to the Worcester News, Kent discovered tales of Henry VIII\u2019s 16th-century tax levied on the bearded men of England, and inspiration struck. He explained, \u201cMy head started whirring away and I started thinking you might be onto something here. I thought\u2014they need to reduce the deficit, so maybe they can start taxing beards with them being so prevalent at the moment!\u201d\n\nClaims that Henry VIII introduced a beard tax in 1535 (despite possessing his own set of well-groomed whiskers) have found their way into numerous books, blog posts, and (of course) Wikipedia, but the tale seems to be apocryphal. One prolific blogger on the life and times of Henry VIII has noted that while he has found evidence that beard-pulling was a crime punishable by fines, primary sources for the 16th-century beard tax have been difficult to locate. Similarly, Dr. Alun Withey, an academic historian of medicine and the body, told the BBC in April that contemporary documents do not support the existence of Henry VIII\u2019s beard tax.\n\nWhile the prior existence of an English beard tax is dubious, there is well-documented historical support for the taxation of facial hair; specifically, Russia\u2019s Peter the Great began taxing beards in 1698, a policy that created significant controversy at the time.\n\nPeter developed anti-beard sentiments after his 1697 grand tour of Western Europe. The tour famously convinced the monarch that Russia was desperately behind-the-times \u2014 economically, scientifically, and sartorially \u2014 and inspired him to undertake substantial efforts towards modernizing his country. As Mental Floss explains, he initiated his grand modernization with quite a \u201cbarber-ous\u201d gesture:\n\nAfter Peter\u2019s triumphant return to Russia at the end of his European voyage in 1698, a joyous reception was thrown in his honor. In attendance were his commander of the army, his frequent second-in-command Fyodor Romodanovsky, and a host of assorted aides and diplomats. Suddenly, the crowd\u2019s mood went from elation to horror as Peter unexpectedly pulled out a massive barber\u2019s razor. As biographer Robert K. Massie writes, \u201cAfter passing among his [friends] and embracing them\u2026 he began shaving off their beards\u201d with his own hands! Given his political stature, none of his associates dared question this stunning turn of events.\n\nAn article in Coins Weekly regarding the mass shaving incident adds that only the Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church was spared. Long, flowing beards were considered a symbol of manhood, integrity, and piety according to Orthodox ideals, with Ivan the Terrible writing, \u201cShaving the beard is a sin the blood of all martyrs will not wash away. It would mean blemishing the image of man as God created him.\u201d\n\nGiven this cultural preference for beards, Peter turned to taxation to incentivize shaving; with an exception for priests, men who refused to shave their beards were taxed 100 roubles a year\u2014a small fortune at the time, according to Russia Today. Peasants were held to a modified version of the tax and only required to shave when entering a city (or pay a fine of one kopek to keep their luxurious facial locks).\n\nA Russian beard token, signifying that the bearer of this coin has paid to look like that. (Photo: US State Department/Public Domain)\n\nTo verify that a bearded man had paid his tax and did not need to be forcibly shaved (and yes, noncompliant men were forcibly shaved) \u201cbeard tokens\u201d were minted and given as proof that the tax had been paid. The token bore an image of the Russian eagle on one side and a bearded face on the other, and were inscribed with the phrases \u201cThe tax has been taken\u201d and \u201cThe beard is a superfluous burden\u201d.\n\nPeter\u2019s beard tax was abolished in 1772, ending the world\u2019s most ambitious regulation of facial hair. But Kent is not the first person to unearth the concept. In 2014, Dr. Alun Withey discovered evidence that a New Jersey state legislator attempted to introduce a graduated beard tax. Convinced that beards provided a furry mask for the morally unseemly, the legislator suggested a taxation scale that can only be summarized as \u201cstrange.\u201d Dr. Withey explains:\n\nFor an \u2018ordinary beard\u2019 the tax was levied at $1 per year. This was fairly straightforward. But, from then on, things got a bit strange. For those men whose whiskers exceeded six inches long the charge was $2\u2026per inch. A bald man with whiskers was punished to the tune of $5, while goatee beards were clearly high on the undesirable list, coming in at a hefty $10 levy. The final (and rather inexplicable) stipulation was that, if any man sported a \u2018red beard\u2019 (i.e. ginger), an extra 20% was chargeable.\n\nAs mentioned above, Kent\u2019s proposal is much more modest, but it remains to be seen whether the Chancellor of the Exchequer will take up this attempt to capitalize off fashion trends. But if you\u2019ve been trying to convince a loved one to do away with their beard, you may want to contact your local representative about taxation opportunities.", "description": "", "authors": ["Erik Shilling", "July", "Matthew Taub", "September", "Eric Grundhauser", "January", "The Conversation", "May"], "top_image": "https://assets.atlasobscura.com/media/W1siZiIsInVwbG9hZHMvYXNzZXRzL2NlNGQ3ODM2MTM5ZDY4ZmUwNV9CZWFyZF90cmltbWluZ19jaGFydF8xODg0LmpwZyJdLFsicCIsImNvbnZlcnQiLCIiXSxbInAiLCJjb252ZXJ0IiwiLXF1YWxpdHkgODEgLWF1dG8tb3JpZW50Il0sWyJwIiwidGh1bWIiLCI2MDB4PiJdXQ/Beard_trimming_chart_1884.jpg", "published_at": "2016-05-14"}
