It was probably inevitable that this season-long battle would come to a head at her sister Becca\u2019s wedding. The really surprising thing is that Alma actually manages to juggle both without anyone being wholly neglected.\n\nAt first, it looks like Alma is going to prioritize her investigation of Jacob\u2019s murder, to the detriment of the rest of her family. For reasons I\u2019m not totally clear on, she scheduled her interview with Charlie Banderhorn \u2014 who Jacob has identified as a prime suspect in his death \u2014 on the same day as Becca\u2019s wedding.\n\nAlma meets Banderhorn at the hotel bar, pretending to be a prospective employee while fishing around to see if he\u2019ll reveal anything about his interest in Jacob\u2019s research. Banderhorn is a bore, and Alma gets drunk, and when she accepts an invitation to go back to his hotel room, it seems like this subplot might be headed in a particularly dark direction. If even Jacob is telling her not to pursue a thread, you know it\u2019s a bad idea.\n\nBut once they\u2019re actually in Banderhorn\u2019s hotel room, Alma\u2019s questions are a little too transparently direct, and a frantic phone call from Becca fills in the rest of the story. Banderhorn is a creep, but like Darrold Harris, he\u2019s firm in his conviction that Jacob\u2019s \u201cresearch\u201d was actually just pure nonsense. \u201cStop looking,\u201d he says, as he puts an uncomfortably familiar hand on her bare shoulder.\n\nAlma gets out of there and races down to Becca\u2019s first-look photo shoot, which has already been delayed to account for her absence. And when Alma arrives and Becca, quite understandably, is annoyed with her, Alma explodes in response, mocking her sister for marrying a man whose touch she hates just weeks after her one-night stand with a bartender.\n\nReed, of course, arrives just in time to hear all of it. And just like that, it looks like the wedding is off. And then Alma uses her ability to rewind time, changing her own actions to be an apologetic and supportive sister, and giving Becca the picture-perfect first-look she wanted.\n\nThis is, needless to say, a much more dramatic use of Alma\u2019s ability than moving a set of car keys, and it\u2019s worth thinking through the implications of it. It is undeniably shitty to show up late to your sister\u2019s wedding and yell about her cheating on her soon-to-be-husband for both of their families to hear. But Undone has also gone out of its way to show us that Becca is not particularly into Reed Hollingsworth, and probably shouldn\u2019t be marrying him.\n\nIn the end, that\u2019s Becca\u2019s call and not Alma\u2019s, so the ultimate outcome here is probably the right one. But if Alma\u2019s ability enables her to go back in time and change things, over and over again \u2014 well, what is the limit? How many times should she re-roll a bad choice or an awkward conversation before she lets the actual, natural consequences of her impulses push her life forward? Is it even possible to live an authentic life if you\u2019re hell-bent on undoing everything you don\u2019t like about your life?\n\nFor a cautionary example of what Alma could become, look no further than Jacob, who has spent the entire season ignoring Becca\u2019s upcoming wedding and is not particularly interested in it now that its here. Looking around the wedding, Jacob sighs: \u201cThis is all temporary.\u201d\n\nThis strikes me as a particularly tragic aspect of time travel: If everything is reversible, nothing really matters. But if Alma actually manages to reverse Jacob\u2019s death, I guess it\u2019s also kind of true. There will be a massive, seismic shift in the Winograd-Diaz family, which will never suffer the trauma of losing Jacob in that car wreck. Maybe Jacob won\u2019t be at the wedding. Or maybe there won\u2019t be a wedding at all. Maybe Alma will never meet Sam. Maybe anything. If you rewind the clock that far and take a different path, the ripple effects will be incalculably massive.\n\nWhatever the truth of Jacob\u2019s death \u2014 and whether or not it\u2019s actually reversible \u2014 we\u2019ll find out shortly. In a bit of a deus ex machina, Alma meets a woman who specializes in Mesoamerican tribal dance. Their conversation is enough to make Alma realize that Jacob may have been onto something with his research on indigenous cultures. Through dancing, she eventually sees a mirror leading her to the fateful Halloween night when Jacob died, and propels herself into it.\n\nBoth dancing and indigenous culture have been recurring motifs throughout Undone \u2014 most notably in the stunning montage at the end of episode two \u2014 but I have to admit, I\u2019m a little disappointed the solution Alma was looking for came from a nameless character we\u2019ve never seen before and are unlikely to see again. But however she got there, Alma is finally nearing the end of her journey. I\u2019m very eager to see the destination.\n\nPieces of Mind\n\n\u2022 I tried to freeze-frame the brief shot of Jacob\u2019s car going over the cliff on Halloween night, but it was too quick and too blurry to make anything out. Any last-minute theories before the season finale? If so, lay them out in the comments below.\n\n\u2022 I like the recurring gag of the battery on Alma\u2019s cracked phone almost being dead, which is wildly in character for her.\n\n\u2022 Reed Hollingsworth\u2019s dad, Layton \u2014 played by Sex and the City\u2019s John Corbett \u2014 is wearing a big dumb black cowboy hat at the rehearsal dinner, which he swaps for a big dumb white cowboy hot on the day of the wedding.\n\n\u2022 Charlie Banderhorn is played by Brad Hall, a former Weekend Update host on SNL who you might also know as Mr. Julia Louis-Dreyfus.\n\n\u2022 Alma, improvising a last-second tribute to Reed during her maid of honor toast: \u201cSolid dude, firm handshake. L\u2019Chaim!\u201d\n\n\u2022 If you had to sum up Undone\u2019s overarching ethos, it would probably sound something like Alma\u2019s pep talk to Becca: \u201cYou\u2019re human and you\u2019re not perfect, which is totally perfect and wonderfully human.\u201d\n\n\u2022 What time is golf o\u2019clock, anyway?", "description": "The battle between the demands of Alma\u2019s day-to-day life and those of her dead father come to a head, inevitably, at Becca\u2019s wedding.
