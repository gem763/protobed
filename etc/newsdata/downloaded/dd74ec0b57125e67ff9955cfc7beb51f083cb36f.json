On your way, take in crumbling military battlements and the ruins of a 16th-century castle, before ascending to the summit, atop of which an enormous Christ sandstone statue perches.\n\nHit the beach\n\nThere are two main beaches in San Sebasti\u00e1n: Playa de la Concha, with its well-heeled locals sipping espresso from the whitewashed beach caf\u00e9s; and Playa de la Zurriola, where sunkissed surfers and groups of teenagers congregate at hip eateries and craft beer bars.\n\nThe latter is the place to burn off last night\u2019s pintxos in the surf: head to Kirol Musk, a surf shop in the Gros neighbourhood, to hire surfboards or body boards. From \u20ac5 per hour, open Tuesday to Saturday, 11am-1.30pm; 5-8.30pm. Novices can learn to catch a wave with a lesson from the friendly team at Pukas Surf, from \u20ac57 per person during the summer, \u20ac44 in winter.\n\nSoak up some culture\n\nThe San Telmo museum, in the heart of the old town, is housed in a 16th-century former Dominican convent, and in 2011 a modern extension was added. It\u2019s home to more than 35,000 artefacts which celebrate Basque culture, spanning art, photography, archaeology and history. In the adjacent Church of San Telmo, take in a visual retelling of San Sebasti\u00e1n\u2019s rich past on the Sert canvases, by Barcelona artist Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Sert. Open Tuesday to Sunday, 10am-8pm; admission \u20ac6 per adult.\n\nWhere to stay\n\nHoused in a picture-perfect 19th-century townhouse near the Gros district, Villa Soro is San Sebasti\u00e1n\u2019s chicest boutique hotel. Expect stylish rooms with antique furniture, plus a grand reception area decorated with unique pieces by Basque artists. The free bike hire is a handy extra. Doubles from \u20ac129, room only.\n\nOpened in 1912, Hotel Maria Cristina, an imposing Belle Epoque building overlooking the River Urmea, is worth splashing out on. There\u2019s a suite named after once-regular guest Bette Davis, and the rooms have movie star-worthy chandeliers, enormous bathrooms and giant, comfy beds. Doubles from \u20ac295, B&B.\n\nEnjoy stylish Scandi-style design, an effortless electronic check-in system and great value at TALO Urban Rooms in the suburban Amara district. The peaceful terrace is a lovely spot to enjoy a pastry from the nearby bakery for breakfast with a coffee \u2013 a fuss-free (and money-saving) alternative to the traditional hotel breakfast. Doubles from \u20ac62, room only.\n\nWhere to eat\n\nYou\u2019ll find some of Spain\u2019s best eating among the busy pintxos bars of the old town. Stop for one or two bites in each, and yell your order from the blackboard with gusto. Every bar has its own speciality: at Paco Bueno, an unassuming-looking joint with old football posters hanging on the walls, it\u2019s all about the crisp, deep-fried tempura prawns, while leather-skinned gents prop up the bar at nearby Bar Txepetxa for the glistening, silver anchovies, skewered with green olives, and a glass of minerally local txakoli wine. Ganbara, meanwhile, specialises in saute\u00e9d wild mushrooms topped with a golden egg yolk.\n\nGet to Bar Nestor early: it makes two wobbly-centred tortillas each day at lunch and dinner, and each usually sells out within the hour. If they\u2019re gone, a blush-red tomato salad and the regional speciality, chuleta (steak), with its burnished-brown crust, is a worthy substitute.\n\nGandarias is a popular, old-school spot for exemplary jam\u00f3n Ib\u00e9rico, and La Vina is revered for its incredible soft-centred baked cheesecake (make like the locals and pour a little sweet Pedro Xim\u00e9nez sherry over yours).\n\nFor a taste of the modern, molecular pintxos San Sebasti\u00e1n is known for, head to La Cuchara de San Telmo for foie gras with local cider syrup, and Zeruko for beef sashimi smoked tableside.\n\nHad your fill of pintxos? World-class restaurants abound here, from book-ahead, blow-the-budget stalwarts such as three Michelin-starred Arzak and Mugaritz, to modish neighbourhood eateries like Topa Sukalderia. Here, a young team creates Mexican Spanish fusion dishes made with local ingredients: think squid cooked in a dark, chocolate-scented mole sauce.\n\nDiscover the rising stars of tomorrow during bargain lunches held in the canteen the Basque Culinary Centre, a training academy founded by a collective of the city\u2019s most respected chefs. The dish of the day, as cooked by the students, plus dessert costs just \u20ac7.50, and the cooking is top-class. Open Monday to Friday, 10am-4pm.\n\nWhere to drink\n\nThe Gros neighbourhood, near the Zurriola surfer\u2019s beach, is home to the city\u2019s flourishing craft beer scene. Find an enormous selection of brews, made locally and from further afield, at Ka\u00f1abika\u00f1a. Nearby, Mala Gissona is a buzzy micro-brewery and bar \u2013 try its Shackletown IPA, with its apricot and peach notes.\n\nExpect a warm welcome at family-run Bar Desy, a 30-year-old institution with an array of new-wave craft beers, plus classic pintxos to soak up the booze.\n\nIf you don\u2019t fancy beer, Gintoneria is the perfect pit-stop to try a G&T made with one of the extensive selection of gins on offer. They\u2019re served in huge, dome-shaped glasses filled with ice, and come with fragrant garnishes.\n\nThe apple orchards in the mountainous regions surrounding San Sebasti\u00e1n mean local cider is plentiful. During the barrel opening season from January to April, many of the cider houses, or sagardotegi, which pepper the hills around the city open their doors, offering a set menu of salt cod tortilla and chuleta alongside unlimited cider for a bargain \u20ac30 per person. If you\u2019re visiting out of season, Petritegi is the only sagardotegi that\u2019s open all year round.\n\nWhere to shop\n\nAs you\u2019d expect in a city that\u2019s obsessed with food, the markets, delis and artisan shops here will make it tricky to stick to your baggage allowance. Locals shop for fresh veg, seafood and spices at La Bretxa market, while across the road, tiny deli Aitor Lasa sells dried mushrooms, local cheeses and preserves.\n\nOpened in 1914, Semillas Elosegui is a treasure-trove shop with heaps of pulses and seeds in paper bags lining the shelves.\n\nFor the most melt-in-the-mouth ib\u00e9rico ham, head to Zaporejai, where owners Aurkene and Sylvain will happily let you try before you buy.\n\nFinally, for a sweet fix, stop at fancy patisserie and caf\u00e9 Pasteleria Oiartzun for a toothsome vasco peque\u00f1o almond tart.\n\nArchitectural highlight\n\nWith its angular form jutting out over Zurriola beach, the Kursaal Convention Centre is a dramatic modern building that\u2019s at odds with the palatial architecture on the other side of the coast. Designed by Rafael Moneo, it hosts art exhibitions, dance, opera and concerts, and is home to a Martin Berasategui restaurant.\n\nNuts and bolts\n\nWhat currency do I need?\n\nEuros.\n\nWhat language do they speak?\n\nSpanish and Basque.\n\nShould I tip?\n\nTipping isn\u2019t obligatory in Spain, but think 7 per cent of the bill at a restaurant.\n\nWhat\u2019s the time difference?\n\nSan Sebasti\u00e1n is one hour ahead.\n\nWhat\u2019s the average flight time from the UK?\n\nYou can fly from London to Bilbao in just under two hours, which is easily accessible via a 75-minute bus to the centre of town.\n\nPublic transport\n\nIt\u2019s easy to walk the length of San Sebasti\u00e1n, and the city is cyclist-friendly, too. There are also regular local buses run by Dbus.\n\nBest view\n\nTake the rickety, 100-year-old funicular railway through shaded forests to the top of Mount Igeldo for fabulous views across the city below, the Aralar mountains and the curved La Concha beach.\n\nInsider tip\n\nWhile you\u2019ll see many prepared pintxos laden over the counters of the bars, make like the locals and always order fresh from the blackboard. They joke that the ready-made bites are saved for the tourists.", "description": "San Sebasti\u00e1n \u2013 or Donostia, as it\u2019s known in Basque \u2013 has everything you want in a weekend away.
