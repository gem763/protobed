We asked Armando Sgrignuoli, the production designer behind CBC's Frankie Drake Mysteries, who definitely knows a thing or two about that. Sgrignuoli's task is to provide the world in which the titular character \u2014 Toronto's first female private detective (at least inside this fictional world) \u2014 can solve her some Roaring Twenties-related crimes.\n\nWatch the video:\n\nSee how Frankie Drake Mysteries production designer Armando Sgrignuoli brings 1920s Toronto to life. 3:19\n\n\"Part of the key to good design is to draw the audience into a space,\" Sgrignuoli says in this video by filmmaker March Mercanti. \"It reinforces aspects that can never be scripted, because in a script you can only fill in so much.\"\n\n\"So when we walk into a character's space such as Frankie's, the design should reinforce her character.\"\n\n(CBC Arts)\n\nAs Sgrignuoli gives us a tour of those very designs, his attention to detail makes it easy to forget what we're watching on the screen is filmed in modern day Toronto. But one thing we shouldn't forget is that he isn't doing it alone.\n\n\"Design is a very collaborative operation,\" he says. \"The construction team, the decorating, the scenic, the props...it's various departments that come together to create that one frame.\"\n\n(CBC Arts)\n\n(CBC Arts)\n\n(CBC Arts)\n\nSeason 2 of Frankie Drake Mysteries premieres Monday, September 24 at 9pm (9:30 NT) on CBC Television.\n\nWatch CBC Arts: Exhibitionists on Friday nights at 11:30pm (12am NT) and Sundays at 3:30pm (4pm NT) on CBC Television.", "description": "There are some things you just can't script.
