Other sci-fi concepts currently being explored include using brain signals to control drones [File photo]\n\n\u2018However, at the moment, having reviewed these options it is a no for us on ethical grounds.\u2019\n\nIn the Second World War, British and US troops were given amphetamine-based substances to make them more alert, a policy which continued into more recent conflicts.\n\nSuch drugs have also been linked to war crimes and incidents of fratricide. US pilots who accidentally dropped bombs on Canadian troops in Afghanistan in 2004 had taken amphetamines.\n\nIn the same year it emerged that the Ministry of Defence was stockpiling Provigil, a drug used to keep special forces soldiers awake for days on end.\n\nForeign powers such as Russia and China (above) are feared to be in a pharmaceutical arms race to develop chemicals that give soldiers superhuman speed, strength and aggression, according to Lieutenant General Chris Tickell [File photo]\n\nNow it is understood that Britain\u2019s enemies are going much further, conducting genetic-engineering experiments on troops, including adding DNA to enhance physical and mental performance.\n\nOther sci-fi concepts currently being explored include using brain signals to control drones.\n\nForeign scientists are even looking at whether DNA from a cat could be added to human eye cells so soldiers can see better in the dark.\n\nCurrently British soldiers are banned from taking steroids and between 2012 and 2015, 250 troops were kicked out of the Armed Forces after testing positive for banned muscle-boosting supplements.\n\nLast night one serving soldier said steroid use was already prolific in UK special forces. He said: \u2018The SAS and other units are influenced by their US counterparts who think nothing of taking dangerous supplements because they need to be faster and stronger than their enemies.\n\nLast night, defence sources said the debate in which Lt Gen Tickell took part last week had \u2018hypothesised many possibilities\u2019.\n\nThe MoD said: \u2018The general was participating in a discussion on the digital age, potential future ethical considerations and human advancements in warfare. Our drugs policy remains as previously stated.\u2019", "description": "Foreign powers are feared to be in a pharmaceutical arms race to develop chemicals that give soldiers superhuman speed, strength and aggression, according to a Lieutenant General.", "authors": ["Marc Nicol For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/01/4826896-0-image-a-11_1572135974593.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
