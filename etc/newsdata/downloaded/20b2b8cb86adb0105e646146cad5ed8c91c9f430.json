You can also still upload NSFW images to Imgur as long as they\u2019re marked \u201chidden.\u201d\n\nThe move came because, as Imgur wrote in its post, \u201cover the years, these pages have put Imgur\u2019s user growth, mission, and business at risk.\u201d That\u2019s oddly strong language to use, and it points to Reddit\u2019s own problems with moderation.\n\nThough the site has lately been quarantining or outright banning subreddits that break its terms of service, it\u2019s possible that Imgur doesn\u2019t like the risk to its brand that comes with being intimately associated with Reddit. The site was founded in 2009 as a solution to Reddit\u2019s image hosting problems; over the years, it\u2019s grown into a community in its own right. (Some \u201cImgurians,\u201d as they\u2019re known, even attended Camp Imgur, a camping trip the company threw in 2015.) Today, the website gets about 274 million visits monthly, which makes it one of the most popular sites in the US.\n\nImgur\u2019s decision to stop hosting Reddit\u2019s NSFW content came about, in the company\u2019s words, because they wanted \u201cImgur to be a fun and entertaining place that brings happiness to the Internet for many, many years to come.\u201d That emphasis on longevity is a hint: it means they don\u2019t see Reddit as necessarily the best way forward.\n\nFor Reddit, on the other hand, it\u2019s hard to say what impact the move will have. The site introduced native image hosting three years ago, so the effect will likely be cultural. Imgur\u2019s move, however, is an indication that Imgur and Reddit might be grown up enough to part ways.", "description": "In a blog post published earlier this week, image-sharing site Imgur wrote that it will be discontinuing its support for Reddit\u2019s NSFW communities.
