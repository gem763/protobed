The paper was actually released online by accident last month by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which contributed on the research alongside Google, and was quickly removed. Now the full paper is live.\n\nThere's just one problem: IBM thinks Google has overstated its achievement.\n\nThe controversy is the latest example of major technology companies trying to one-up each other in quantum computing, a futuristic realm with no clear winner yet. Microsoft and Intel have also been working actively in the area.\n\nQuantum computing is utterly unlike today's computing. Our existing PCs and mobile devices express information that ultimately gets boiled down to ones and zeros. Quantum computers work in quantum bits, or qubits, which is more nuanced \u2014 information can be a one and a zero at the same time.\n\nThis technology has promise. It could come in handy to solve problems that modern computers aren't so good at. It could improve the computing of artificial intelligence models, and it could help with materials science and chemistry work. It could even be used to break encryption one day, and Google is aware of that possibility.\n\nGoogle's Nature paper talks about an experiment that researchers conducted with a custom 54-qubit processor called Sycamore. The goal for Google was attaining quantum supremacy \u2014 essentially doing something with a quantum computer that would take an impractically long time with normal computers. Google has been focused on the challenge of quantum supremacy \u2014 a concept that dates to 2012 \u2014 for some time.\n\n\"Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times \u2014 our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years,\" the researchers wrote in the paper.\n\n\"This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.\"\n\nGoogle tapped its own computing infrastructure as well as Summit, currently the world's most powerful supercomputer, to simulate the quantum work and then extrapolate.\n\nIBM took issue with the 10,000-year calculation.\n\n\"We argue that an ideal simulation of the same task can be performed on a classical system in 2.5 days and with far greater fidelity,\" IBM's Edwin Pednault, John Gunnels and Jay Gambetta wrote in a blog post. They said quantum supremacy in the strictest terms had not in fact been accomplished.", "description": "Companies including Google and IBM are pouring money into the development of quantum computers, but these sophisticated systems don't have many practical applications yet.", "authors": ["Jordan Novet"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106198807-1571848425507handoutgooglepichaiquantum.jpg?v=1571849326", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
