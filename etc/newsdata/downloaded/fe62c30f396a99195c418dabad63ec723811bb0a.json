Gone are the skull and crossbones signs, the need to wear a flak jacket.\n\nBut 22 years after Diana\u2019s visit boosted international funding to clear the soil \u2014 and 133 countries signed a treaty banning land mines \u2014 explosives keep hurting rural Angolans, who are still grappling with the aftermath of a bloody civil war that ended in 2002.\n\n\u201cThere is still a huge amount to do,\u201d Prince Harry told a London audience in June. \u201cThe fact that funding has been reduced by 90 percent over the last decade is pretty shocking.\u201d\n\nThe United States was Angola\u2019s leading backer as it strove to remove land mines planted during the 27-year conflict, funneling $129 million to the effort since 1993.\n\nOver the years, however, funding has dried up as battles in Afghanistan, Somalia and elsewhere have grabbed international attention.\n\nAngola, which is entering its fourth year of recession, is struggling to finish the job. The government recently pledged $60 million toward the cleanup, but that\u2019s not enough to reach its goal of demining the country by 2025.\n\n\u201cAt the current rate of funding, Angola won\u2019t be land-mine-free until 2046,\u201d said Alex Vines, head of the Africa Program at Chatham House, a global think tank.\n\nSafely removing land mines is expensive, he said. Specialists use metal detectors and drones that find irregularities in soil.\n\nWhen Diana\u2019s helicopter landed in Huambo in 1997, the United Nations estimated that millions of land mines were scattered throughout the country, which is the size of Texas and California combined.\n\n\n\nPrincess Diana holds a land mine during her visit to a mine field in January 1997.

Other suppliers included companies in Portugal, Cuba, South Africa and Germany.\n\nAbout 1,200 minefields remain in Angola, covering 26,000 acres, according to the Halo Trust, the British mine-clearance nonprofit organization that is hosting Prince Harry.\n\n\u201cThese are often the poorest people with less access to social services,\u201d said Ralph Legg, Halo Trust\u2019s program manager in Angola.\n\nThe problem worsens in Angola\u2019s rainy season when water pushes land mines into fields people think are safe.\n\nIn July, a man who works for a lumber company stepped on one, according to victim advocates. He remains hospitalized.\n\nAt least 88,000 people in Angola have been wounded by land mines, by the Halo Trust\u2019s latest count. The death toll is unknown.\n\nThe fight against buried explosives has grown more complicated since Princess Diana put on her flak jacket , said Paul Heslop, the demining specialist who walked her through the field in Angola.\n\nMozambique, which was also riddled with land mines after a civil war, announced it was clear in 2015 after a two-decade push. But combatants in Iraq and Syria, for instance, have unleashed a deadly era of homemade bombs.\n\nHeslop hopes Prince Harry\u2019s visit raises as much awareness as his mother\u2019s.\n\n\u201cHer images were broadcast around the world,\u201d he said, \u201cagain and again and again.\u201d\n\nRead more\n\nNigerian children who escaped Boko Haram say they faced another \u2018prison\u2019: Military detention\n\nThe \u2018Amazon of Africa\u2019 faces a big challenge: No addresses\n\nA U.S.-funded nuclear project to zap a killer fly into extinction is saving West Africa\u2019s cows\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "About 1,200 minefields remain in Angola, covering 26,000 acres.", "authors": ["Danielle Paquette", "West Africa Bureau Chief", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/ZBZ_XO9aCgsi-e8kgdYjO79J6xo=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/HQMGKKG7XQI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
