Boris Johnson and his government don\u2019t want vulnerable people who they see as being different to them coming to our country.\n\n\u201cThose are the same arguments that were used against me and other Jewish people coming here 80 years ago.\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.
