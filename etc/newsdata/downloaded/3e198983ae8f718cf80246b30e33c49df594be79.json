I\u2019m so f\u2014ing glad we got Osuna!\u201d referring to Astros closer Roberto Osuna. The reliever had previously been suspended for 75 games in violation of Major League Baseball\u2019s domestic violence policy after being accused of assaulting the mother of his child in 2018.\n\n\u201cOur initial investigation led us to believe that Brandon Taubman\u2019s inappropriate comments were not directed toward any reporter,\u201d the Astros said in Thursday\u2019s statement. \u201cWe were wrong. We sincerely apologize to Stephanie Apstein, Sports Illustrated and to all individuals who witnessed this incident or were offended by the inappropriate conduct. The Astros in no way intended to minimize the issues related to domestic violence.\n\nAlso Read: Sports Illustrated Publisher Cuts 40 Staff Jobs, Plans to Replace Laid Off Workers With Contractors\n\n\u201cOur initial belief was based on witness statements about the incident. Subsequent interviews have revealed that Taubman\u2019s inappropriate comments were, in fact, directed toward one or more reporters. Accordingly we have terminated Brandon Taubman\u2019s employment with the Houston Astros. His conduct does not reflect the values of our organization and we believe this is the most appropriate course of action.\n\n\u201cWe are thankful to Major League Baseball and to everyone that cooperated in the investigation,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cAs previously stated, the Astros are very committed to using our voice to create awareness and support on the issue of domestic violence. We fully support MLB and baseball\u2019s stance and values regarding domestic violence. We will continue to make this cause a priority for our organization.\u201d\n\nIn its initial statement, the Astros had accused Sports Illustrated and its reporter, Stephanie Apstein, of \u201cfabricating\u201d and giving \u201cmisleading\u201d information about the incident and defended Taubman, despite multiple reporters corroborating the incident. On Tuesday, MLB stepped in to conduct its own investigation of the incident, before eventually firing Taubman on Thursday.\n\nRead original story Houston Astros Assistant GM Fired After \u2018Unprofessional\u2019 Exchange With Female Reporters At TheWrap", "description": "The Houston Astros have fired assistant GM Brandon Taubman days after he made inappropriate comments toward female reporters.Following the Astros\u2019 dramatic victory over the New York Yankees to clinch the American League pennant and a berth in the World Series on Saturday night, Sports Illustrated reported", "authors": ["Daniel Kohn"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AiyPnGZSa9TjJnBUf20VNQ--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MTg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thewrap.com/8d2568c0df01415f226cf64dee8221ac", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
