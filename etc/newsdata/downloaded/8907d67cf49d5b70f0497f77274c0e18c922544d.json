Asked by Colbert whether it was time to, \u201cdare I say, lock him up,\u201d she said that launching an impeachment inquiry to look at the evidence was the right step. The Founding Fathers, she said, created a provision for impeachment for times when the president has \u201csubverted the Constitution, has abused power, has put the nation at risk.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI believe strongly that this particular incident has had such a huge impact because we\u2019ve known for a long time that he was a corrupt businessman who cheated people, and we\u2019ve known that he and his campaign asked for aid from Russia,\u201d she said of Trump. \u201cWe\u2019ve known that. But to see him in the office of the president putting his own personal and political interests ahead of the national security of our country just pierced through whatever confusion or denial people had.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton: Trump is an \u2018illegitimate president\u2019\n\nShortly before the show was taped, the Wall Street Journal reported that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was listening in on the phone call at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, in which Trump sought the Ukrainian president\u2019s assistance in investigating his main political rival, former vice president Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nColbert didn\u2019t miss the chance to get Clinton\u2019s thoughts on the revelation.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHow many times when you were secretary of state did you have to say to Barack Obama, you can\u2019t extort foreign countries to get dirt on your political enemies?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cYeah, that never happened,\u201d Clinton responded, laughing.\n\nShe said that in a moment like that, the secretary of state\u2019s job is to \u201cmake sure that, number one, he knows what the president is going to say on those calls,\u201d which she described as \u201cusually highly prepared\u201d with the help of the State Department, Pentagon and others.\n\n\u201cAnd because you\u2019ve got a president who doesn\u2019t listen to anybody and doesn\u2019t follow instructions whatsoever,\u201d she continued, drawing laughs from the audience, \u201cI\u2019m not sure [if] they\u2019ve even given up on trying to give him any sorts of preparation because they don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to say.\"\n\nAD\n\nBarr personally asked foreign officials to aid inquiry into CIA, FBI activities in 2016\n\nHow would she feel as secretary of state, Colbert asked, if the president was \u201csending Rudy Giuliani out to actually handle foreign policy.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nClinton didn\u2019t mince words: While presidents or secretaries of state might use an envoy or special adviser to relay a message, she said, \u201cagain, it is supposed to be carefully thought through.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd from what we\u2019ve seen on television,\u201d she continued, \u201ccarefully thinking through is not one of Rudy\u2019s strong points.\u201d\n\nFrom there, the talk finally turned to the book, with the co-authors chatting about the experience of writing a book together for the first time \u2014 a process Chelsea Clinton said was made more difficult by her mother\u2019s insistence on writing longhand. But when Colbert held up a page of Clinton\u2019s handwritten notes, joking that they \u201clook a bit like you\u2019re up in a cabin writing your manifesto,\u201d she was ready for a change of topic.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat is so embarrassing,\u201d she said between belly laughs. \u201cLet\u2019s go back and talk about impeachment.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nTrump amps up attacks on whistleblower as some Republicans call for more strategic response to impeachment\n\nRussian TV has enthusiastically covered the Trump-Ukraine scandal\n\n\u2018He\u2019s wild as a March hare\u2019: Republicans decline to defend Rudy Giuliani\n\nTrump has talked about uprisings on his behalf before.
