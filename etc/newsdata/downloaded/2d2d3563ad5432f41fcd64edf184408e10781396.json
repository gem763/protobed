REUTERS/Toby Melville/Pool\n\nMore than a quarter of British government bonds by value are inflation-linked and the higher rate of RPI than other measures of inflation means investors receive an estimated annual windfall of 1 billion pounds a year.\n\n\u201cI can confirm that the government has no current plans to stop issuing gilts linked to RPI,\u201d Javid said in a letter to the chair of an economics committee in the upper house of Britain\u2019s parliament which recommended a change earlier this year.\n\nJavid said he recognised there were flaws in the RPI measure but scrapping it would \u201cpotentially be highly disruptive for the wide range of users of RPI\u201d which could be damaging to the economy and the public finances.\n\nHe said the government was focused on Brexit for now but would launch a consultation about when to accept a recommendation by Britain\u2019s statistics regulator to align the RPI with another measure of inflation, the CPIH.\n\nBut any such change would not happen before 2025, Javid said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that they are not leaving open the option of going earlier in the consultation but at least we are moving on from where we were,\u201d David Norgrove, chair of the UK Statistics Authority, told Reuters after Javid\u2019s announcement.\n\nInsurance firms are big buyers of index-linked bonds to help them pay private pensions that are linked to RPI, and they would have been losers from any immediate change.\n\nBut RPI is also widely used for setting annual increases in rail fares and student loan repayments, meaning commuters and students face higher increases than they would if the fares and loans were based on CPIH.\n\n(This story corrects to show consultation is about when, not whether, to make change to inflation measure)", "description": "British finance minister Sajid Javid said on Wednesday he had no current plans to stop the sale of inflation-linked government bonds which are based on a flawed measure of price growth, the Retail Price Index (RPI).", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426051324&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830IE"}
