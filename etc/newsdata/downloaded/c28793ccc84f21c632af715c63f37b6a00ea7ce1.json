A bawl, a sob, a weep, even a whimper \u2014 if tears are flowing down one viewer\u2019s cheeks, you can bet than everyone else is aware.\n\nThis auditory quirk makes Toronto a particularly effective venue for taking the pulse of which fall movies are hitting viewers in the hearts. As the 2019 festival enters its final days, here\u2019s your guide to the films that got the faucets flowing this year.\n\nThe Am-I-Crying-or-Laughing Cry Movie: Marriage Story\n\nPreviously, the only people who cried during Noah Baumbach movies were people who knew Noah Baumbach in real life and had just figured out which character was based on them. But the director\u2019s latest film, a portrait of the crumbling relationship between a controlling theater director (Adam Driver) and his L.A.-bound wife (Scarlett Johansson) feels warmer, less acidic. It\u2019s a slow-motion tragedy, as spouses who\u2019ve sworn they\u2019re going to separate amicably gradually find themselves put into a position where the only logical choice is hating each other. But, like a baker adding butter to a croissant, Baumbach also takes care to knead a thin layer of comedy into every scene. As the divorce proceedings spiral out of control, Driver and Johansson get into a ferocious argument where they take turns screaming the foulest insults they can muster at each other. It\u2019s an emotional wringer, and it also got some of the most laughs I\u2019ve seen at the festival this year. I wouldn\u2019t call Marriage Story a true tearjerker, but it\u2019s a solid bet your eyes will get misty at least once. It\u2019ll be up to you to figure out which emotion that\u2019s coming from.\n\nThe Nostalgic Cry Movie: A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t ruin my childhood,\u201d the wife of journalist Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys) tells him as he prepares to interview Mr. Rogers in Marielle Heller\u2019s latest film. Fans of the gentle children\u2019s-television host might have said the same thing upon watching the Beautiful Day trailer, which seemed to hint toward a kind of bog-standard biopic-iness. Luckily, the movie is a little more nuanced than that. Rather than a simple biopic, it holds Rogers (Tom Hanks) at a slight distance, making him into an unnervingly nice guardian angel who helps Vogel sort out his own daddy issues. The Rhys material aims for viewers\u2019 hankies, but it hasn\u2019t worked for everyone. Luckily the Hanks scenes sing \u2014 sometimes literally, as when Heller re-creates the aesthetic of Mister Rogers\u2019 Neighborhood for the film\u2019s framing devices. You might start to well up at the sight of your cherished childhood memories so expertly brought back to life, but for this viewer, the dopamine rush brought about by seeing that trolley in action again was more than enough to crowd out any tears.\n\nThe Inevitable Cry Movie: Just Mercy\n\nNo scene I\u2019ve seen at TIFF this year provoked more tears than one that comes at the midpoint of the legal drama Just Mercy. The film tells the story of legal advocate Bryan Stevenson (Michael B. Jordan), a high-flying Harvard Law graduate who moves to Alabama and volunteers his services to death-row prisoners, most of them black men who have run afoul of the racist criminal-justice system. Despite his efforts Stevenson is not always successful, and midway through the film, one prisoner\u2019s bid for a stay of execution is denied. In an extended sequence, we follow the man on his last night alive; by the end if it, the audience in my screening was absolutely silent, save the sound of sobs echoing from every corner of the theater. Just Mercy is among the more divisive of this year\u2019s films: Industry types and the public have been gushing over it, while critics generally consider it a boring piece of paint-by-numbers inspiration. (One told me the movie \u201cseems to be running for office.\u201d) It\u2019s considered a strong contender for the festival\u2019s People\u2019s Choice Award, an honor that usually presages a Best Picture nomination, and if the film does take home the prize, it\u2019ll have those tears to thank.\n\nThe Cathartic Cry Movie: Waves\n\nWaves made, well, a splash when it debuted at Telluride last week, seemingly coming out of nowhere to become one of that festival\u2019s most acclaimed films. (Opinions differ on whether A24 didn\u2019t know what it had in Waves, or whether it had intentionally downplayed it to produce the exact reaction it received.) Trey Edward Shults\u2019s movie came to TIFF riding a swell of hype, and the reception at its Tuesday-night premiere was only slightly less ecstatic. Waves follows an upper-middle-class black family led by a domineering dad (Sterling K. Brown), whose son (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) is cracking under the pressure, while the daughter (Taylor Russell) is trying her best to keep everything together. The film\u2019s first half will be familiar to anyone who\u2019s seen Euphoria or Spring Breakers \u2014 a swirling camera, lots of neon, nonstop go-go-go energy. The whole thing climaxes in a sequence that was my second-most-stressful viewing experience of the entire festival (Uncut Gems was No. 1), after which the film switches focus, formats, and gears, and turns into something else entirely. It becomes an earnest story of forgiveness, a sweet coming-of-age tale, and also kind of a romantic comedy? I\u2019m still not sure exactly what the second half of Waves is, but I do know that, when Russell\u2019s character finally opens her heart up to her father, I cried like she was my very own daughter.\n\nThe \u2018RIP David Bowie\u2019 Cry Movie: Jojo Rabbit\n\nFinally, I must shamefully admit that none of the above movies made me tear up the way that Jojo Rabbit did. And if you think I\u2019m an easy mark now, wait till you hear what did it. Taika Waititi\u2019s Nazi movie hasn\u2019t received the warm critical embrace it might have expected at TIFF \u2014 it came billed as a satire, but it\u2019s actually just a comedy, one that doesn\u2019t have much to say beyond \u201cracism is crazy.\u201d But the relationship between the titular Hitler Youth (Roman Griffin Davis) and the Jewish girl his mother is hiding in their home (Thomasin McKenzie) is awful sweet, and at one pivotal moment of the film, the duo dances to \u201cHelden,\u201d David Bowie\u2019s German-language cover of \u201cHeroes,\u201d which just so happens to be my absolute favorite version of the song. I got that familiar sore-throat feeling, and then the tears stormed down my face. Yes, I\u2019m the goober who cries at \u201cHeroes.\u201d Maybe you will be, too.", "description": "As the Toronto International Film Festival nears the end, here is a guide to all the movies that are sure to get your faucets flowing this fall.", "authors": ["Nate Jones"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/12/11-tiff-tear-jerkers.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
