She is the author of Wild Swans, Mao: The Unknown Story (with her husband, the historian Jon Halliday) and Empress Dowager Cixi: The Concubine Who Launched Modern China. Her books have been translated into more than 40 languages and sold more than 15m copies outside mainland China, where they are banned. Her latest, Big Sister, Little Sister, Red Sister: Three Women at the Heart of Twentieth-Century China, charts the lives of the Soong sisters, who were among the most significant political figures of early 20th-century China.\n\nYour new book explores the dynamic between three women in a family, as did Wild Swans\u2026\n\nWild Swans shows how life was different for each of the women \u2013 my grandmother, my mother, me. This book is also about very different lives, but because of political beliefs not generations. Big Sister [Soong Ai-ling] and Little Sister [Soong Mei-ling] were passionately anti-communist, whereas Red Sister [Soong Ching-ling] supported Mao. To start with, I didn\u2019t want to write about the sisters; they were like fairytale [characters]. But while I was doing research, I realised how extraordinary they were, with all their mental agonies, moral dilemmas and heartbreaks.\n\nDid you aim to show how the political is personal?\n\nYes \u2013 the sisters\u2019 personal lives were more intimately connected with politics even than in Wild Swans. These women were right at the centre of Chinese politics \u2013 Ching\u2011ling was married to the father of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen. Two of the three sisters miscarried and could never conceive again. Their miscarriages were a direct result of Chinese politics. Of the three sisters, there is just one descendant, living in Texas, who is the son of Ai-ling\u2019s youngest son [Ling C Kung] and Hollywood star Debra Paget, who was Elvis\u2019s lead lady in Love Me Tender.\n\nThe book is dedicated to your mother\u2026\n\nMy mother inspired me to write Wild Swans and she\u2019s been so supportive of all my work. She lived under Chiang Kai-shek \u2013 she was a student activist, fighting his regime \u2013 and through Mao\u2019s rule. She\u2019s 88 now and living in China.\n\nDo you visit her?\n\nNot often, because since the publication of my biography of Mao [in 2005] I\u2019ve lost the freedom to travel in China. I\u2019m allowed to go back 15 days a year to see my mother.\n\nHow does that feel?\n\nI feel very bad. She\u2019s just come out of hospital. I wish I could just jump on a plane and go and see her. Fortunately, we can Skype. My mother is extraordinary. I still draw strength from her capacity to make me feel that everything is OK, that I should just be myself. She can take anything: glory, danger, hardship.\n\nAsking questions has been at the heart of your research process\u2026\n\nMy mother inspired me to ask questions. She came to stay with me in 1988 and said, \u201cI want a serious talk\u201d, and started to tell me stories including how she and my father had to walk from Manchuria to Sichuan, a journey of more than 2,000 miles. My mother suffered a miscarriage on the way. As she was talking, I began to think I must write all this down.\n\nHow did it shape you growing up in a country with cultural censorship?\n\nI had always wanted to be a writer as a child but couldn\u2019t spell out this dream to myself because during the Cultural Revolution all writers were condemned. To be a writer was the most dangerous profession. I wrote my first poem aged 16 and destroyed it. When I was working spreading manure in the paddy fields aged 16 and 17, I was always writing in my head. In my home town there was a black market selling books that had been banned. My 13-year-old brother was very entrepreneurial. He made money dealing Mao badges and used it to buy books, which he hid in a hole he dug in the garden.\n\nSo you\u2019ve always felt the power of words\u2026\n\nHuge, huge power. My father loved writing and encouraged us to write diaries. But I had to destroy my diary during the revolution.\n\nWhat are your early memories of living under Mao?\n\nI was in nursery school aged about four and my mother came to see me but had to return to detention before midnight [during the Cultural Revolution, Chang\u2019s parents were denounced, imprisoned and tortured]. I remember she held my hand through the barrier and then pulled her hand away and was gone because her time was up.\n\nMao ordered flowers to be destroyed\u2026\n\nWhen I was in school we all had to go out and remove grass from the school lawn as he had just issued the order that cultivating flowers and grass was a bourgeois habit. In my house there was always a vase with flowers \u2013 one day it disappeared, and the parks became wastelands. When I first came to Britain and saw flowers I was beside myself with joy.\n\nThe People\u2019s Republic of China celebrated its 70th anniversary on 1 October but it\u2019s been a turbulent year, with the protests in Hong Kong\u2026\n\nWhile researching my book I discovered that there was a period between 1913 and 1928 when China was practising democracy \u2013 and people took to it with remarkable ease. So it\u2019s not something completely alien to the Chinese. I\u2019m holding my breath and waiting to see what happens.\n\nYou\u2019ve witnessed some of the most brutal periods of history. Are you an optimist?\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to return to those brutal periods now. I feel on the whole the world is moving forward, although there are many attempts to turn the clock back, but I think we\u2019re in a more civilised and humane world. I\u2019m feeling hopeful.\n\n\u2022 Jung Chang is at Southbank Centre\u2019s Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, on 19 October\n\n\u2022 Big Sister, Little Sister, Red Sister: Three Women at the Heart of Twentieth-Century China is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a325).
