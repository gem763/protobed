Add Interest\n\n\"While our positions are carefully considered and deeply held, there is much room for healthy debate and differing opinions,\" the webpage reads. \"We hope being clear about our positions is helpful.\"\n\nThe page is intended to \"provide customers, investors, policymakers, employees, and others our views.\"\n\nLisa Werner/Moment Editorial/Getty Images\n\nThe company says that the federal minimum wage in the U.S. is \"too low and should be raised,\" and argued that doing so would \"help address growing income inequality\" and benefit tens of millions of individuals and families. Amazon, which has aggressively pushed for tax incentives from U.S. municipalities as it has expanded, said the company believes \"corporate tax codes should incentivize investment in the economy and job creation.\"\n\nIt also said that \"human-induced climate change is real, serious,\" and that \"action is needed from the public and private sectors.\"\n\nIn addition, Amazon said diversity is \"good for business,\" the rights of LGBTQ+ people \"must be protected\" and that it supports \"the rights of immigrants and immigration reform.\"\n\nOn the tech front, the e-commerce giant also said that it believes governments at all levels \"should have access to the best technology\" and that this is important for the \"ongoing safety and security of the country.\"\n\nIn terms of business, Amazon outlined that it believes \"counterfeiters should receive stronger penalties under federal law\" and \"consumer data privacy should be protected under federal law.\"\n\nAmazon, however, has come under scrutiny from critics over some of these issues in the past.\n\nLast month, over a thousand Amazon workers walked off their jobs in support of the Global Climate Strike, saying in a statement that CEO Jeff Bezos\u2019 climate pledge is \u201cnot nearly enough\u201d to tackle the company\u2019s role in climate change.\n\nIn June, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY, made headlines after claiming that Amazon is paying its workers \u201cstarvation wages,\u201d and that Bezos being a billionaire was predicated on this. Amazon has refuted the congresswoman\u2019s comments.\n\nThe following month, in July, some Amazon workers at a suburban Minneapolis plant planned a strike on the company\u2019s Prime Day shopping event. An organizer said their goal was to \u201cput pressure on Amazon to protect us and provide safe, reliable jobs.\u201d", "description": "The e-commerce giant Amazon published a lengthy statement,", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/amazon-01-as-gty-190920_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
