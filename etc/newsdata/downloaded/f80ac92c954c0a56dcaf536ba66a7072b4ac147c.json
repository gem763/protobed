Currently 12.5 BTC, after the halving, the reward will fall to 6.25 BTC.\n\nPrevious halving events have triggered upward price motion, leading to suggestions that 2020 will be no different. Additional studies, notably the popular Stock-to-Flow model, have corroborated the theory that Bitcoin price must surge as the mining reward decreases.\n\nComparing historical data, Crypto Rand noted that the 2012 and 2016 halvings removed $302,400 and $8.19 million per week from circulation respectively. 2020\u2019s \u201cmost dramatic\u201d halving, the analyst forecast, will remove $63 million.\n\nInvestor Alistair Milne broadly agreed, adding that at its current price of $8,200, there will be $51.7 million less in new Bitcoin each week.\n\n\u201cTo those that think Bitcoin's inflationary schedule is less effective with time ... At current values (~$8200), 2020's halving will remove $51.7million/week of newly mined Bitcoin from the sell-side,\u201d Milne summarized on Monday.\n\nPrice on track for gains\n\nAs Cointelegraph reported, Bitcoin\u2019s drop to $8,200 placed it firmly in line with the Stock-to-Flow model\u2019s expectations. Previously, when the price was higher, it was effectively \u201cfront-running\u201d the historically accurate measure.\n\nNonetheless, the positive outlook is not shared unanimously. In an interview earlier this month, Jihan Wu, co-founder of mining giant Bitmain, warned the halving may not necessarily lead to the return of bullish sentiment.\n\n\u201cThere are many uncertainties, but now is a good time to invest in crypto mining,\u201d he said. Bitmain plans to operate the world\u2019s biggest Bitcoin mining farm in Texas, the company revealed in a press release on Monday.", "description": "Historical evidence puts next year\u2019s event in context as Bitcoin network\u2019s next watershed moment", "authors": ["William Suberg"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvYTVkYTE2OTYyOTcwMTVkNThlYjYxMDUyNzAwYWZlZjguanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
