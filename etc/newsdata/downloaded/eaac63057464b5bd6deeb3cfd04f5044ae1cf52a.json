While the product itself has been around for years, the pairing of the name \u2014 the French word for wild or savage \u2014 with Native American symbolism was new. And the connotation, along with the use of cultural traditions to sell a product, outraged some who saw it.\n\n\"Wild or sauvage ... really is an old way to think about Indigenous people,\" said Toronto-based Indigenous fashion designer Lesley Hampton.\n\n\"If we are we representing Indigenous people as savage, then what are you telling your kids? What are you telling anyone?\"\n\nCanadian-born Twilight actress Tanaya Beatty, who was featured in the promotional short film alongside Depp wandering through the desert rock, said in a lengthy Instagram post Friday she believed Dior had good intentions, but was \"misguided.\"\n\nControversy gets people talking\n\nThe public outcry was strong enough that Dior eventually yanked the videos from its social media accounts, but not before highlighting its efforts to consult with Native Americans on the project, including the group Americans for Indian Opportunity.\n\nWatch: Why people are angry over the imagery and product name deemed culturally insensitive\n\nLuxury fashion house Dior is facing backlash over its latest advertisement. It features Indigenous imagery and what many are calling an insensitive brand name. For its part, the brand says it took care to be culturally sensitive. But critics say those efforts are still tone deaf. 1:53\n\nThe non-profit firm told CBC News it was \"not consulted on nor informed of the Dior PR/Marketing campaign\" but was involved in the project to ensure inclusion of Indigenous staff, artists, actors and writers and \"to educate the production teams on Native American contemporary realities.\"\n\n\"The controversy will start an international conversation and share information about contemporary Native peoples,\" said executive director Laura Harris.\n\nSome brands are catching on to the potential of this kind of controversy, particularly when a politically charged climate can mean strong reactions, worldwide re-tweets and valuable back-and-forths online.\n\nCapturing attention\n\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\"Today, that is how you capture attention,\" said Sam Fiorella, a social media marketing instructor at Toronto's Seneca College.\n\n\"These marketing companies understand there is no middle ground: 'We're not going to get 100 per cent of the audience. So let's go for the 50 per cent that will back this ad up.'\"\n\nFiorella points to two companies in particular that he believes went this route: Gillette, with its toxic masculinity campaign urging men to take more accountability for their actions, and Nike, with its decision to feature NFL player Colin Kaepernick, who has been without a team since his decision to take a knee before games during the U.S. national anthem.\n\nA controversial Gillette ad earlier this year urged men to take more accountability for their actions, in part because of the impact their example can set for the next generation. (Procter & Gamble)\n\nBoth companies faced a mix of support as well as the threat of boycotts.\n\n\"Knowing that we're in a very divisive world right now, it's pretty much 'us' versus 'them,' left vs right,\" said Fiorella. \"It's all so antagonistic that there is a market for that type of advertising.\"\n\n'Culturally insensitive industry'\n\nSome social media users suggested Dior might have done the same thing.\n\nThis is so glaringly wrong and offensive, this can only be intentional and deliberate. They know exactly what they are doing. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/dior?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#dior</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/diorsauvage?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#diorsauvage</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/diorparfums?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#diorparfums</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/9PJTdHhnrR\">https://t.co/9PJTdHhnrR</a> \u2014@lindseylaveaux Strong likelihood this was intentionally made to outrage and offend. Welcome to life and marketing in 2019 \u2014@officecandy\n\nBut Fiorella isn't so sure.\n\nAfter all, the luxury fashion industry has made numerous missteps recently that have provoked fiery reaction online and furthermore, called into question the lack of diversity at decision-making levels.\n\nGucci faced backlash earlier this year over a sweater many people said resembled blackface.\n\nPrada pulled a line of figurines for the same reason.\n\nBurberry was forced to apologize in February after featuring a hoodie with a noose-like knot, sparking accusations it was glamourizing lynching and suicide.\n\nDolce & Gabbana faced fury in 2018 after posting a series of promotional videos on China's social media platform, Weibo, showing an Asian woman trying to eat Italian food with chopsticks.\n\nGucci, which faced backlash over this sweater for resembling blackface, is one of many high fashion companies which has come under fire recently for culturally inappropriate attire or advertising. (Twitter/@MikeishaDache)\n\nEven Dior encountered criticism last year after an ad meant to pay homage to Mexican heritage failed to include any Mexican representation. Instead, it featured Silver Linings Playbook star Jennifer Lawrence.\n\n\"It's a tone-deaf and culturally insensitive industry and they've been getting away with it for a long time,\" said Fiorella. \"But some of the backlash is starting to sink in and make some waves.\"\n\nGucci, Prada and Burberry have hired new executives responsible for improving diversity and inclusion in the workplace and in advertising.\n\nDior was set to officially launch its campaign for Sauvage on Monday, but since the ads have been pulled, it's unclear how the company will continue its promotion. Given all the attention on social media, though, it might not have to do much \u2014 especially if its higher-end buyers aren't bothered.\n\n\"If it is your core consumer who is displeased, then your product is in danger,\" said Curtis. \"If the backlash to a controversial campaign appeals to your target audience, then it can be beneficial.\"", "description": "Dior pulled a new cologne ad after the luxury brand was accused of cultural appropriation, but not before it generated multiple mentions, hashtags and conversations on social media.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5266349.1567195090!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/sauvage.jpg"}
