We are fortunate in the sport we are in to not see any of that stuff happen to us. You just hope things will get better for them.\n\n\u201cOn a personal level I am delighted that he has got his first cap. It could have been in better circumstances, but I\u2019m happy to see a mate do so well.\u201d\n\nJoseph was speaking ahead of England\u2019s Rugby World Cup quarter-final against Australia this Saturday in what will be a repeat of their 2007 last-eight showdown.\n\nThe Bath centre looks set to return to the matchday squad with Jack Nowell\u2019s inclusion looking increasingly unlikely, with the wing struggling to recover from a hamstring injury and missing training once again on Tuesday. If Joseph is subsequently handed the final shirt in the matchday squad, he will be needed to cover the wing as well as his natural outside centre role, with Henry Slade offering back-up at full-back, but it appears unlikely that he will force his way into the starting XV ahead of Owen Farrell and Manu Tuilagi, who have started two of England\u2019s three matches at centre so far this tournament.\n\nAustralia also have a settled pairing in the shape of Samu Kerevi and James O\u2019Connor, and though Joseph believes he England are better suited to concentrate on their own abilities, he recognises the individual talents that the two Wallaby midfielders will bring.\n\n\u201cObviously you will have a look at the opposition, but you concentrate on yourself, what your game plan is going to look like,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cKerevi is a fantastic player, I have seen him develop and get better and better over the past few years. He is such a threat with ball in hand and we have seen that in this World Cup, he loves getting his hands on the ball and loves his offloading game. He is destructive when he gets his hands on the ball.\n\n\u201cIt has changed slightly with the change of personnel. You could argue O\u2019Connor is going to release his outside backs a bit more than [Tevita] Kuridrani. But our system doesn\u2019t change, we work in unison \u2013 10, 12, 13 we are all working together and are going to solve it together.\u201d", "description": "England\u00a0centre Jonathan Joseph is relieved he doesn\u2019t face the same vile racism that has overshadowed the national football team\u2019s 6-0 victory over Bulgaria, after seeing close friend Tyrone Mings among those racially abused on his Three Lions debut.", "authors": ["Jack De Menezes"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/15/08/jonathan-joseph.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
