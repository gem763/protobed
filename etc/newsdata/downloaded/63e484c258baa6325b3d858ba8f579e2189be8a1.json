They get nothing from me,\u201d McCain cut in, referring to when Ivanka and Ivanka\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner, attended Sen. John McCain\u2018s service last year.\n\nPresident Trump was excluded from Meghan\u2019s dad\u2019s memorial after a long history of denigrating him, which continued after he died.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not good people,\u201d Meghan said on The View.\n\nContrary to how she described it, though, Ivanka and Kushner were reportedly invited by Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of Sen. McCain\u2019s closest friends, with widow Cindy McCain\u2018s permission.\n\nRELATED: Meghan McCain Is \u2018Team Chrissy\u2019 Against Trump After He Attacks Chrissy Teigen and John Legend\n\nIVANKA & TRUMP JR\u2019S \u201cCOLD WAR\u201d?

She is resourceful, confident, and secure. \u2026 The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great,\u201d Meghan said then.\n\nFrom left: Meghan McCain, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner | Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic; Samir Hussein/WireImage More\n\nOn The View on Tuesday, she had more cutting words for Ivanka, who has become the face of the Trump administration\u2019s workforce and women\u2019s policies. Meghan has criticized Ivanka before, joining others who say she and Kushner are unqualified for such high-profile political positions.\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t know what she [Ivanka] does all day. \u2026 I know she does women\u2019s initiatives but that\u2019s all very nebulous,\u201d Meghan said.\n\nThe White House quickly pushed back.\n\n\u201cThe idea that the hosts of The View or a reporter at The Atlantic have any factual reads on what goes on within the Trump family is completely asinine,\u201d spokeswoman Jessica Ditto tells PEOPLE.", "description": "Meghan McCain: Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner 'Not Good People'", "authors": ["Adam Carlson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sNcMdmqj1EzrUbwXq0WQkw--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/27138d48614ea45746f85d3ae8dda7f6", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
