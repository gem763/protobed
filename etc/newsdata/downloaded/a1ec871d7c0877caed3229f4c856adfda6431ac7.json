They said they were coming for us and for our set-piece \u2026 But credit to my boys, we ground it out. Thanks to this amazing crowd, you should really be proud of your team. They play a style that\u2019s fearless.\u201d\n\nIt was hard to take for Japan with the emotion spilling over for the players.\n\nEmotional scenes as Japan players embrace each other after tough quarter-final loss against South Africa#JPNvRSA #RWC2019 #WebbEllisCup pic.twitter.com/RfU8PqUS9h \u2014 Rugby World Cup (@rugbyworldcup) October 20, 2019\n\nCoach Jamie Joseph summed up the feelings best.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really proud with what we\u2019ve achieved at the World Cup,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m just disappointed for the players because they give so much to the group and they give so much to the country.\u201d\n\nBut Japan finish the World Cup sitting eighth in the world following the loss, after going into the game at a record high of sixth, one position ahead of the Wallabies.\n\nThe final quarterfinal was a hard slog with the first half ending 5-3.\n\nWhile there were divisive calls, a decisive performance from referee Wayne Barnes ensured the focus stayed on the game.\n\nA straight yellow card for South African prop Tendai Mtawarira appeared controversial after a tip tackle almost ended up horribly wrong.\n\nThe commentators labelled it \u201cugly\u201d immediately but it was quickly resolved.\n\nWhile some felt Mtawarira or \u201cThe Beast\u201d was lucky, it didn\u2019t take away from the match.\n\nRight, in the ground that looked like a red card. He landed on his head. Was television different? #JPNvRSA \u2014 Karl Brophy (@KarlBrophy) October 20, 2019\n\nFor a guy of Beast's experience, that was really unnecessary. #JPNvRSA \u2014 Gasant Abarder (@GasantAbarder) October 20, 2019\n\nIt was a match that had both sides riding their luck however.\n\nA call just before the end of the half, the Springboks were denied a try as Damian de Allende was denied a try after he was deemed to have been tackled and then continued to run.\n\nWallabies legend Phil Kearns said \u201cthat\u2019s a try every day of the week\u201d but conceded that the world was behind Japan.\n\nJustin Harrison said it was a flip of a coin but it was good to see a referee make a decision.\n\nFormer England star Stu Barnes agreed, especially with a tip tackle sending South African prop Tendai Mtawarira to the sin bin.\n\n\u201cThe yellow card for The Beast, clear tip, you know how it is now, it\u2019s a lottery,\u201d he said. \u201cI could not believe he didn\u2019t check, it was so close to being simultaneous head and neck. But if it went to TMO, it would have been what everyone was talking about, was it red or not but because he was decisive, we\u2019ve sort of moved on from it.\u201d\n\nKearns said it\u2019s something that is worth changing after but shouldn\u2019t have changed during the event.\n\nThe first half was widely praised with social media as Japan stayed with the might of South Africa.\n\nThis has been one of the most extraordinary halves of rugby I've ever seen. #JPNvRSA \u2014 Sarah Maunder (@s_maunder) October 20, 2019\n\nOh I really, really don't know about that call. What a half, though. #JPNvRSA \u2014 James Maasdorp (@MaasdorpJR) October 20, 2019\n\nUnfortunately, the second half was all South Africa as the Springboks ground the Brave Blossoms out of the game.\n\nThree penalty goals for Handre Pollard have the Springboks the 14-3 lead before the Springboks rolling maul did the job, putting scrum half Faf de Klerk over to all but ice the game at 21-3 with 14 minutes left in the game.\n\nHeartbreaking to see Japan crashing out like this, but what an achievement it was to reach the QF in the first place. Only way for them to get better is to be given regular tier 1 competition #JPNvRSA \u2014 Alfred Joyner (@alfredjoyner) October 20, 2019\n\nArigatou, Japan. It was beautiful while it lasted.
