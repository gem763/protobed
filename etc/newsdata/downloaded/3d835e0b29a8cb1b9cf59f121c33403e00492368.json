(Erik Cox Photography/Flickr)\n\nIt was one fine fall day. About as good as is gets, really, with highs mainly in the 60s to near 70. Not only that, but we saw lots of sun and minimal wind. If you haven\u2019t yet gotten enough, there\u2019s more on the way tomorrow. And it\u2019s also looking good for Game 3 tomorrow night.\n\nListen to our daily D.C. forecasts: Apple Podcasts | Amazon Echo | More options\n\nThrough tonight: Like last evening, temperatures dip quickly as the sun sets. Unlike last night, added moisture should keep temperatures from falling enough for any frost concerns. There could be patchy fog, though, especially near water or in valleys and after midnight. Lows range from the low 40s in the cool spots to the low 50s downtown.\n\nView the current weather at The Washington Post.\n\nTomorrow (Friday): A south wind is pumping in slightly higher moisture at the ground and aloft. This means we should see increased cloudiness, compared with today, but plenty of sun. Highs aren\u2019t far from where they ended up today, or mainly the upper 60s to around 70. The south wind blows around 5 mph.\n\nAn early look at Game 3 of the World Series shows partly cloudy skies, light winds and temperatures falling through the low and mid-60s around the start time, then toward 60 as the game goes on.\n\nSee Matt Rogers\u2019s forecast through the beginning of next week.
