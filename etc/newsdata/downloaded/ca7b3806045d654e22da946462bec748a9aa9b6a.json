Guyger, an off-duty officer who had just finished a long shift, fired two shots at Jean, who had been watching TV and eating ice cream.\n\nAfter a dramatic seven-day trial, the jury rejected Guyger\u2019s self-defense claim and delivered what Jean family attorneys called a historic decision.\n\n\u201cThis is a huge victory not only for the family of Botham Jean but, as his mother told me a moment ago, this is a victory for black people in America,\u201d civil rights lawyer Lee Merritt said after the verdict was returned. \u201cIt\u2019s a signal that the tide is going to change here; police officers are going to be held accountable for their actions and we believe that will change policing culture all over the world.\u201d\n\nGuyger faces a sentence of five years to life in prison, without the possibility of probation. The sentencing phase of the trial will continue on Wednesday.\n\nThe shooting, which occurred the evening of Sept. 6, 2018, touched off days of protests in Dallas and demands for police reform. Many saw it as part of a pattern of police wielding deadly force disproportionately against people of color.\n\nBut the unusual facts of the case made it unique among fatal shootings involving police, most of which are never even prosecuted.\n\nGuyger, who is white, offered a tearful defense and repeated apologies on the stand Friday.\n\n\u201cI shot an innocent man,\u201d she said during her testimony, the first time the public had heard from her since the shooting.\n\nGuyger\u2019s lawyers have said the 31-year-old, who was fired from the police force shortly after she killed Jean, was exhausted and scared when she heard someone inside the unit she thought was her own. She opened the door, saw a \u201csilhouette figure\u201d in the dark apartment and feared for her life, they said.\n\n[\u2018I shot an innocent man,\u2019 says former officer on trial for murder]\n\nGuyger said Jean walked toward her after she asked to see his hands. She fired two shots. By her own admission, she was shooting to kill.\n\nBut because she believed she was in her own home, her legal team argued, she was within her rights, acting in self-defense. It was \u201ca series of horrible mistakes,\u201d the lawyers said \u2014 \u201cawful and tragic, but innocent.\u201d\n\n\n\nAssistant District Attorney Jason Hermus, right, gives Botham Jean's mother, Allison Jean, a hug after closing arguments on Monday. (Tom Fox/Dallas Morning News via AP)\n\nDallas County District Court Judge Tammy Kemp ruled Monday that the jury could consider the \u201ccastle doctrine,\u201d a controversial law that says your home is your castle and you have a right to defend it.\n\nOn Tuesday, lawyers for the Jean family joined the chorus of critics, saying it was \u201casinine\u201d for the doctrine to go before the jury. Jean family attorney Benjamin Crump compared it to the controversial stand-your-ground law, describing both as attempts to \u201ccome up with justification to kill an unarmed black person.\u201d\n\nThe prosecution cast Guyger as careless and negligent \u2014 armed, distracted and too quick to pull the trigger. Prosecutors called her defense \u201cgarbage\u201d and \u201cabsurd.\u201d\n\nThey said a reasonable person would have noticed the illuminated apartment numbers that read 1478, rather than 1378, and would have seen Jean\u2019s red doormat. She wasn\u2019t paying attention, prosecutors said, because she was too caught up in a sexually explicit conversation she was having with her partner on the police force.\n\n\u201cI mean, my God,\u201d said Jason Fine, the Dallas County Assistant District Attorney. \u201cThis is crazy.\u201d\n\nProsecutors also questioned why Guyger opened the door when she suspected someone was inside, arguing that police training teaches officers confronting a burglar to take cover and call for backup.\n\n\u201cFor Amber Guyger, Mr. Jean was dead before that door ever opened,\u201d said Jason Hermus, the lead prosecutor.\n\n[A steamy chat distracted an officer when she entered the wrong apartment and killed a man, prosecutors say]\n\nJurors had to decide whether Guyger was guilty or not guilty of murder or manslaughter.\n\nDuring the first part of the sentencing phase on Tuesday, Jean\u2019s mother, Allison Jean, told the jury how her son, a middle child, brought together his brother, his sister and the rest of the family. He was the glue, she said.\n\n\u201cMy life has not been the same,\u201d Allison Jean said. \u201cIt\u2019s just been like a roller coaster. I cannot sleep. I cannot eat. It\u2019s just been the most terrible time for me.\u201d\n\nThe state also sought to portray Guyger as a prejudiced person, pointing to her private correspondence and social media posts. In one text message to another officer, she said she was working with several black officers.\n\n\u201cNot racist but just have a different way of working and it shows,\u201d one message read.\n\nGuyger is expected to take the stand for a second time when sentencing resumes.\n\nAs Jean\u2019s family and their supporters celebrated the ruling in the hallway outside the courtroom, Merritt and fellow attorney Benjamin Crump repeated the names of other unarmed black people whose killers \u2014 most of them members of law enforcement \u2014 hadn\u2019t faced legal consequences: Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Sandra Bland, Tamir Rice, Eric Garner and Antwon Rose among them.\n\n\u201cFor so many unarmed black and brown human beings all across America,\u201d Crump said, \u201cthis verdict today is for them.\u201d\n\nAfter the verdict was returned, the Jean family attorneys said the unique facts of this case left little doubt the jury would find her guilty. Jean was in his own home, unarmed, committing no crime and not acting aggressively, they said.\n\nJean was also, Crump said, \u201cnear-perfect\u201d \u2014 college-educated and a certified public accountant working for one of the world\u2019s most prestigious firms. But justice should be served equally to everyone, no matter their race, class or education, he said.\n\n\u201cThis jury had to make history in America today, because Botham was the best that we had to offer,\u201d Crump said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t take all of that for unarmed black and brown people in America to get justice.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s database of fatal police shootings\n\nAn undocumented man was killed when cops went to the wrong home.
