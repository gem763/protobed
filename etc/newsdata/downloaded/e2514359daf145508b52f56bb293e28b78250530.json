First, he had it all \u2013 the most talented actor of his generation. Then he lost it all spectacularly in a blaze of drugs and jail sentences. Then he regained everything a hundred times over, becoming the world\u2019s richest and most beloved star in a string of films that made heavy use of his personality. And now comes the next stage, in which he does a bizarre Welsh accent at a polar bear in a hat. That\u2019s right, the trailer for Dolittle is out.\n\nIn Dolittle, Robert Downey Jr plays Doctor Dolittle, a man who can converse with animals. It\u2019s based on High Lofting\u2019s book The Voyages of Doctor Dolittle, and not The Story of Doctor Dolittle. We know this because the trailer doesn\u2019t contain any gratuitous racial epithets, or a scene in which Robert Downey Jr bleaches the face of an African man. So what is it about? Glad you asked. Let\u2019s take a look.\n\n1. The trailer opens with a shot of a parrot soaring through the air as the obligatory slowed-down version of a popular song (in this instance, What a Wonderful World) plays in the background. The message is clear. This is a film of great majesty. To watch it will be to be rendered awestruck by the glory of nature.\n\n2. Then we dive inside. This is a great old house, clearly owned by a magnificent eccentric. Not only does he allow a monkey full run of the place, but he\u2019s also constructed some sort of food delivery monorail. He must be kind, and gregarious, and deeply wonderful. I can\u2019t wait to meet him.\n\n3. Ah, here he is. Doctor Dolittle himself. Not just that, but Doctor Dolittle played by the world\u2019s biggest star unshackled from the world\u2019s biggest role. Robert Downey Jr is here to show that he\u2019s a endearingly gifted actor, and this is how he does it. He\u2019s gazing soulfully at a hat. Just like he did in Chaplin. What a salve this must be to the three people who preferred Chaplin to Iron Man 3.\n\n4. But what of Doctor Dolittle\u2019s animal friends? Here, as What a Wonderful World begins to surge towards its bombastic climax, we meet a funny parrot who says silly things. You\u2019re right, Dolittle trailer, it is indeed a wonderful world.\n\n5. But the funny parrot is not alone. Doctor Dolittle\u2019s friends also include an exuberant duck, an excitable gorilla, a regular dog, a dismay-filled monkey and what appears to be the lead singer of the early-90s alternative rock band Spin Doctors in polar bear form. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m especially looking forward to meeting the polar bear.\n\n6. There is also an octopus. Dolittle has chosen to address the octopus by sticking his head into a tank of water. What you can\u2019t see in this scene are all the shots of the octopus trying to work out what accent Robert Downey Jr is doing. \u201cAre you from Yorkshire?\u201d he asks. \u201cOr Irish? Seriously, throw me a bone here. You\u2019d better not be pretending to be from south-east Asia, Downey, because I thought we were ditching all of the racist stuff from the Dolittle books.\u201d\n\n7. Also, don\u2019t get too attached to the gorilla, because he\u2019s on a ship that gets bombed, so will almost certainly end up dead. OK, don\u2019t shoot the messenger.\n\n8. Finally, there is a tiger who wants to eat Robert Downey Jr. He probably succeeds, too. It\u2019s quite hard to talk down a hungry tiger. Being able to talk to animals isn\u2019t going to help him a jot. The moral of Dolittle, then, seems to be: \u201cJust because you can, it doesn\u2019t mean you should.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "description": "It\u2019s a weird but wonderful world as the rebooted animal lover bangs on in a bizarre Welsh accent to his marauding menagerie", "authors": ["Stuart Heritage"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8348bcabd80ad53a3be2528ab74d3c4a9151f18f/232_46_1062_637/master/1062.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=7ae614b39f4380eacf2211bb214ee907", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
