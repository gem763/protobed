But Iran's President Hassan Rouhani, who arrived in New York on Monday for the U.N. General Assembly, has said there will be no negotiations until Trump eases or lifts sanctions, which the U.S. agreed to do under the original deal.\n\nWhen asked by ABC News on Monday whether Rouhani would meet Trump, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded emphatically, \"No!\"\n\n(MORE: Trump heads to UN amid tensions with Iran, questions over call with Ukrainian leader)\n\nPHOTO: Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif departs from the 2019 Climate Action Summit which is being held in advance of the General Assembly of the United Nations at United Nations Headquarters in New York, September 23,2019.

We'll have to see what happens. We're doing just fine,\" he told reporters as he entered the U.N.\n\nHours later, during a photo op with Singapore's prime minister, Trump talked up his tough sanctions.\n\n\"We have a lot of pressure on them right now -- more pressure than they've ever had. ... A lot of things are happening with respect to Iran. A lot more than you would know. A lot more than the media knows, OK? I\u2019ll be discussing it a little bit tomorrow,\" he said, one day before his address to the U.N. General Assembly.\n\nPHOTO: President Donald Trump departs after a meeting at the United Nations for a global call to protect religious freedom ahead of the General Debate of the General Assembly of the United Nations at U.N.

French President Emmanuel Macron spoke to Trump on Monday morning before his meeting with Rouhani on Monday evening, he told reporters -- with a Trump meeting possible for Tuesday.\n\nPHOTO: A handout picture provided by the Iranian presidency on September 23, 2019, shows President Rouhani attending a farewell ceremony at the Mehrabad airport in Tehran, shortly before leaving Tehran for the UN General Assembly in New York.

In a joint statement Monday, they said they had concluded, \"Iran bears responsibility for this attack. There is no other plausible explanation.\"\n\nBut the diplomatic divide with the Trump administration over the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA, remains.\n\n(MORE: US-Iran diplomatic deal seems dead as Tehran breaches new nuclear limit)\n\nThe U.S. and Europe now agree on the need to begin negotiations with Iran on a new agreement. The joint European statement said, \"Time has come for Iran to accept negotiation on a long-term framework for its nuclear programme as well as on issues related to regional security, including its missiles programme and other means of deliver.\"\n\nBut how to get to those talks is the source of division. The Europeans have proposed an interim agreement where Iran returns to compliance with the nuclear deal in exchange for the U.S. permitting some economic aid to Iran, for example through a $15 billion line of credit. If the two sides agreed to that, a diplomatic source told ABC News, the hope is that they could begin negotiations on a new deal that extends the nuclear deal's limits on Iran and addresses its ballistic missile program.", "description": "With the Middle East on high alert after an attack on Saudi oil facilities, world leaders were jockeying at the United Nations on Monday to respond to the attack and find a resolution to heightened tensions between the U.S. and Iran.
