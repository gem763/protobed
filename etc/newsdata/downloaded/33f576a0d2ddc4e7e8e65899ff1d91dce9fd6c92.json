Of the 100 competitors in the final of the Fortnite World Cup, none were women, and just one of the more than 200 players in the Overwatch League is a woman. The apparent egalitarianism of digital competition has clearly not translated into a truly even playing field. In response, a number of organizers have turned to creating women-only events. They\u2019re clearly serving a need, but that need remains complicated.\n\nWhile many of the arguments against these events are easily dismissed (no, it\u2019s not reverse sexism to give marginalized genders their own space), segregated tournaments aren\u2019t always popular, even among those who push for the inclusion of more women and nonbinary competitors in e-sports. It\u2019s a reasonable discussion to have: if our end goal is tournaments that aren\u2019t uniformly male, can putting on separate tournaments be part of the solution?\n\nGirl Gamer Festival obviously thinks so. It\u2019s a series of women-only events that\u2019s been running since 2017, this year taking place in multiple cities all over the world. Attending in late September in Madrid, I wanted to find out what the festival\u2019s goals were. In particular, I wanted to know whether its ultimate aim was to make itself obsolete.\n\nThe Movistar Esports Centre in Madrid only has a capacity for about 70 spectators, but the seating was full as 10 women took the stage for their first League of Legends match. When they began to play, one team\u2019s shot-caller was audible over the rest of the noise, corralling her team, choosing targets, and celebrating when things went their way. It was quickly apparent that many of the people in the crowd were already on her side, but those of us who went in without favorites soon started cheering for her and the rest of her team, Movistar Riders, too.\n\nWhen organizer Fernando Pereira says that one of the goals of Girl Gamer is creating competitors who can \u201cact as role models that inspire younger girls in developing an interest in [competing],\u201d it\u2019s this shot-caller who I think of. I\u2019m not the young girl that Pereira presumably has in mind \u2014 given how young e-sports pros typically are, I\u2019m usually older than everyone competing \u2014 but there is still a certain inspiration in getting to see someone like you lead, be confident and carefree, and win onstage.\n\n\u201cIt is always great to play on stage.\u201d\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not just about me and the other women watching. The women onstage are the ones getting the most out of the event. Pereira says they aim to create \u201ca platform that offers opportunities for women to grow and develop their competitiveness in e-sports.\u201d It\u2019s a stepping stone, in other words, for them to begin to compete in the mixed-gender events \u2014 clearly something that\u2019s necessary, if it works.\n\nThe event did have that kind of energy. After the shot-caller finished her match, she ran to talk enthusiastically with her family in the audience, like any young participant might as they\u2019re learning the ropes in their first competition, cheered on by those who know them.\n\nGirl Gamer Festival doesn\u2019t only aim to open the proverbial door with who they invite, but also where these events take place. This year, they were in Sydney, Madrid, S\u00e3o Paulo, and Seoul. Other than the last location, these are rare spots for e-sports events, limiting opportunities for people who live outside the major centers of America, South Korea, and China. Pereira also has aims to expand: \u201cWe want to be able to reach more regions that have been left out in this year\u2019s circuit, while building more mechanisms that would allow us to run year-round online competitions in multiple games.\u201d\n\nThe simple opportunity may be the springboard that some female competitors need. \u201cLearning how to properly play at LAN tournaments is a very important experience,\u201d Maya \u201cCaltys\u201d Henckel, an AD carry player for League Of Legends team OOB, tells me. OOB were the victors at Girl Gamer Madrid, and they will be competing in Dubai in December for the overall trophy. \u201cProviding a safe environment for female players to start somewhere in e-sports [is important] as it is still a very sexist field,\u201d botlaner Laure \u201cShiny\u201d Delaroche agrees.\n\nOn top of experience and a foot in the door, any e-sports competitor benefits from visibility, which may lead to fans and opportunities in the future. \u201cIt is always great to play on stage so everyone can watch our games and support us,\u201d toplaner Na\u00efma \u201cFreyja\u201d Gradi tells me.\n\nAlong with providing experience and coverage to these women, which is something any budding competitor needs, some Girl Gamer events also provide additional help. \u201cWe use the opportunity to run conferences and seminars that educate the players about the e-sports industry and developing their career paths, while teaching their parents how to best support their children and create better relationships at home,\u201d says Pereira.\n\nBy doing all of this, he does see the possibility that events like Girl Gamer Festival could ultimately be part of making themselves unnecessary. \u201cOnce women actually start being accepted and integrated into professional teams in top tier tournaments, it might stop making sense to have separate gender events,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cThis is a generational problem that will take quite a long time to fix.\u201d\n\nThe players, too, see it as a step toward increased numbers of women at mixed events. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t, and I hope it won\u2019t be, a dead end for women willing to compete,\u201d Delaroche says. \u201cI hope everyone will be used to seeing women in competitive games at some point, and look at players for their performance instead of their gender. But to me, we need to go through all those steps before this happens.\u201d Gradi agrees: \u201cOnce there are enough women in mixed events without sexist situations then it won\u2019t be necessary anymore.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s an understandable sense with everyone I speak to that this is still a long way off. Right now, we\u2019re still at a point where women are kept out of supposedly \u201cmixed-gender\u201d teams for reasons like having to share a team house, which is what happened to Molly \u201cAvalla\u201d Kim. Misogynistic skepticism often leads to accusations of cheating, which happened to Kim \u201cGeguri\u201d Se-Yeon. And higher levels of harassment often lead to women leaving the scene, in the case of Kate Mitchell. All of these examples come from one single e-sport, Overwatch, which is often considered to be one of the most welcoming, thanks to Blizzard\u2019s advertising centered on a somewhat more diverse cast of characters and events like Pride celebrations.\n\nAn event like Girl Gamer Festival does not solve all of these problems, but it does give women an avenue forward that might not have been accessible otherwise. \u201cAs with all the issues surrounding equality, this is a generational problem that will take quite a long time to fix,\u201d Pereira says. \u201cWe can only do the best we can in doing our part in promoting change.\u201d", "description": "The Girl Gamer Esports Festival in Madrid was a chance for women to get experience in competitive gaming, playing titles like League of Legends onstage.", "authors": ["Jay Castello", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M72NgH62nE8FPqy4N1r93kbkE2Y=/0x25:1280x695/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19307717/GIRLGAMER_Stage.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
