Those who headed northeast gave rise to farming populations, while those who went south became coastal foragers, the scientists believe.\n\nAncient Khoisan bushman cave drawings.

Further studies, which have looked at whole genomes, point to populations who migrated out of Africa originating in the continent\u2019s east.\n\n\u201cThese and many other data suggest that we are an amalgam of ancestry from different regions of Africa with, of course, the addition of interbreeding from other human groups outside the continent,\u201d he said.\n\nSarah Tishkoff, a geneticist at the University of Pennsylvania, also raised doubts. \u201cHow can they know that there aren\u2019t old lineages in other regions if they\u2019re not included in the study?\u201d she said.\n\nRebecca Ackermann, an archaeologist at the University of Cape Town, said the study appeared to brush aside extensive evidence that suggests the roots of our species are Pan-African and beyond. \u201cDrawing sweeping conclusions about places of origin from analyses of this tiny part of the modern genome is deeply problematic and outdated,\u201d she said.", "description": "Modern humans emerged 200,000 years ago in a region of northern Botswana, scientists claimed, in what appeared to be the most precise location of mankind\u2019s \u2018ancestral homeland\u2019 yet discovered.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/og_image_scmp_generic/public/d8/images/methode/2019/10/29/b9a01cbe-fa0d-11e9-acf9-cafedce87d15_image_hires_141427.jpg?itok=lhZgxrP0&v=1572329677", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
