On Tuesday, among the flood of headlines came the following remarkable one from Hello! magazine:\n\n\u201cRoyal FIRST! Meghan Markle surprises in denim jacket at the beach in Cape Town with Prince Harry\u201d\n\nLet us do a slower reading of that: Meghan Markle, who\u2019s the Duchess of Sussex, made the unprecedented decision to wear a denim jacket \u2014 historic denim, if you will. According to Hello!, Markle paired the jacket (from Madewell) with black jeans and flats during a trip to Monwabisi Beach in Cape Town, where she and Prince Harry learned about a program that aims to help young people struggling with their mental health.\n\nOn the subject of the jacket, Hello! reports that it was \u201ccertainly a royal first for a royal lady on an official engagement.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not unlike Meghan to push the boundaries of what\u2019s viewed as acceptable for a duchess to wear. At her very first Trooping of the Colour, Markle made the bold decision to sport an off-the-shoulder Carolina Herrera gown; she\u2019s also garnered quite a bit of attention for wearing black clothing, especially at weddings. Sometimes she breaks royal protocol, causing a flurry of panicked headlines from British tabloids \u2014 but sometimes she simply reimagines what it means to be a chic royal in 2019 without breaching unwritten rules. The historic denim, according to the tabloids, is a-okay.\n\nCongrats to all of us on this major \u201croyal first!\u201d\n\nStay in touch.
