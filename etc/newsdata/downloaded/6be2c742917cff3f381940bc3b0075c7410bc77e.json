The #1 rule at Lusher is to \u2018Be Kind,\u2019 and we live this motto every day,\u201d the principal said, according to local CBS affiliate WWL. \u201cChick-Fil-A has been politically outspoken about its views, and we feel it is not part of Lusher\u2019s culture of kindness and community.\u201d\n\nThe meal was being provided by the College Football Playoff Foundation, which said it will bring the teachers food from another restaurant instead. The organization\u2019s Tony Fay said he respected the school\u2019s decision, WWL reported.\n\nChick-fil-A made headlines this spring after the left-wing ThinkProgress released a report saying the Chick-fil-A Foundation donated $1.8 million in 2017 to Christian and socially conservative groups with an alleged history of anti-LGBTQ bias.\n\nThe report renewed criticism of the fast-food chain that first started in 2012 after CEO Dan Cathy, a conservative Christian, revealed his disapproval of gay marriage.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
