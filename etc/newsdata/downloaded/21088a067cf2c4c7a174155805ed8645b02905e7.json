(Radio-Canada)\n\nNo exceptions\n\nThe city said it will not comment on the case now that a formal complaint has been filed to the Commission des droits de la personne et des droits de la jeunesse.\n\nBut city lawyers advised council as the policy was being formed the province of Quebec's tax law forces Gatineau to apply the levy equally to all households.\n\nA Gatineau daycare has also spoken out about the pressures that diapers put on its limit and said it was also told it won't get an exception.\n\nBeaudry's city councillor said she hasn't given up pushing for an accommodation.\n\nParc-de-la-Montagne-Saint-Raymond Coun. Louise Boudrias said she is working with councillors to try to accomodate the Beaudry family and others facing a similar problem. (Radio-Canada)\n\n\"I find it sad that a citizen has to go to that extent to make a point,\" said Louise Boudrias in French in an interview with Radio-Canada.\n\nThe city is taking a few weeks for a transition period before applying the levy, but Boudrias said she'd like to see a solution before the family has to begin paying the extra fees.\n\n'We are not polluters'\n\nThe Beaudry family's discrimination case must be approved as valid before being investigated formally by the commission.\n\nThe case makes two points: that the levy is a discriminatory extra tax against his family and that the use of terminology like \"polluter-pay\" as written in the policy is negative terminology that misrepresents the family's situation.\n\n\"We are not polluters,\" said Beaudry.\n\n\"We are not using an extra service, we need that service.\"", "description": "Pierre Beaudry's 29-year-old son is living with a disability that causes him to wear diapers, forcing them to pay extra garbage fees.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5296117.1569365005!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/pierre-beaudry.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
