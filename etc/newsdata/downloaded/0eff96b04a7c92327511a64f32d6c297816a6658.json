By portraying Trump\u2019s requests as a \u201cconspiracy theory,\u201d the media believe they can convince the public that Trump was just looking for dirt as opposed to the truth, which is how the facts prove Trump\u2019s requests are perfectly reasonable.\n\nThe first is the Biden family using then-Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s influence to enrich themselves by way of Hunter Biden\u2019s sweet $50,000 a month \u2014 a month! \u2014 gig with a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nThe second involves Ukraine\u2019s meddling in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nWe know for a fact Ukraine meddled in the 2016 presidential election to boost Hillary Clinton because the same media now telling us this belief is a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d have already reported that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 presidential election to boost Hillary Clinton.\n\nHere\u2019s the far-left Politico back in January of 2017:\n\nUkrainian government officials tried to help Hillary Clinton and undermine Trump by publicly questioning his fitness for office. They also disseminated documents implicating a top Trump aide in corruption and suggested they were investigating the matter, only to back away after the election. And they helped Clinton\u2019s allies research damaging information on Trump and his advisers, a Politico investigation found. A Ukrainian-American operative who was consulting for the Democratic National Committee met with top officials in the Ukrainian Embassy in Washington in an effort to expose ties between Trump, top campaign aide Paul Manafort and Russia, according to people with direct knowledge of the situation. The Ukrainian efforts had an impact in the race, helping to force Manafort\u2019s resignation and advancing the narrative that Trump\u2019s campaign was deeply connected to Ukraine\u2019s foe to the east, Russia. \u2026 Politico\u2019s investigation found evidence of Ukrainian government involvement in the race that appears to strain diplomatic protocol dictating that governments refrain from engaging in one another\u2019s elections.\n\nWe also learn that Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign and the DNC sought dirt from Ukraine, which is exactly what Trump is being falsely accused of:\n\nA daughter of Ukrainian immigrants who maintains strong ties to the Ukrainian-American diaspora and the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, [Alexandra] Chalupa, who had worked in the White House Office of Public Liaison during the Clinton administration. Chalupa went on to work as a staffer, then as a consultant, for Democratic National Committee. \u2026 In an interview this month, Chalupa told Politico she had developed a network of sources in Kiev and Washington, including investigative journalists, government officials and private intelligence operatives. \u2026 The day after Manafort\u2019s hiring was revealed, she briefed the DNC\u2019s communications staff on Manafort, Trump and their ties to Russia, according to an operative familiar with the situation. A former DNC staffer described the exchange as an \u201cinformal conversation,\u201d saying \u201c\u2018briefing\u2019 makes it sound way too formal,\u201d and adding, \u201cWe were not directing or driving her work on this.\u201d Yet, the former DNC staffer and the operative familiar with the situation agreed that with the DNC\u2019s encouragement, Chalupa asked embassy staff to try to arrange an interview in which Poroshenko might discuss Manafort\u2019s ties to Yanukovych.\n\nAnd this is only the half of it. There is also the matter of the DNC server, which the corrupt media, the FBI, and Robert Mueller all claim was hacked by the Russians to aid and abet the Trump campaign.\n\nWhat the media refuse to report now, though, is that the server has never-ever-ever-ever been scrutinized by the FBI or anyone trustworthy. The only organization that has looked at the server is a private security group called CrowdStrike that \u2014 surprise, surprise \u2014 asserts Russia hacked the server; and everyone, including our own FBI, are just taking their word for it because it fits the narrative.\n\nIt\u2019s beyond outrageous the FBI and media have blindly accepted these results.\n\nThe reasons CrowdStrike is suspect is that 1) disgraced former FBI Director James Comey has admitted the FBI wanted to see the server but was never given access, 2) CrowdStrike\u2019s co-founder Dmitri Alperovitch despises Russia through a group called the Atlantic Council, which is funded by NATO and a Ukrainian billionaire who is very close to Hillary Clinton and George Soros, and 3) CrowdStrike received $100 million in funding from Google Capital, which is owned by Eric Schmidt, a billionaire committed to Democrats, which made him a big time Hillary Clinton supporter in 2016.\n\nSo the whole thing stinks to high heaven, and there is no good reason for the DNC not to turn the server over to the FBI, especially when blaming Russia for the DNC hack (which may ultimately prove true) is just a little too neat when you look at the players involved.\n\nDespite all this, the fact that Trump would like to know what the hell went on in Ukraine is still derided over and over again in the media as a \u201cconspiracy theory,\u201d even though \u2014 and this is important \u2014 the Department of Justice has opened an ever-expanding investigation into Ukraine\u2019s involvement in the 2016 election.\n\nThe Washington Examiner:\n\nThe Justice Department revealed that U.S. Attorney John Durham, picked by Attorney General William Barr to look into the origins of the Trump-Russia investigation, is investigating whether Ukraine was involved in any 2016 election efforts. \u201cA Department of Justice team led by U.S. Attorney John Durham is separately exploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election,\u201d DOJ spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said Wednesday. \u201cWhile the Attorney General has yet to contact Ukraine in connection with this investigation, certain Ukrainians who are not members of the government have volunteered information to Mr. Durham, which he is evaluating.\u201d\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) is also interested in investigating Ukraine\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election. Here he is on Sunday with Maria Bartiromo:\n\n\u201cI think Ukraine was involved in the 2016 election. I think they were trying to hurt Trump,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThey may have been working with the Democrats. And I want someone to look at Ukraine\u2019s involvement in our 2016 election like [Robert] Mueller looked at the Russian involvement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Politico article [referenced above] is very disturbing, where DNC members went to the Ukrainian embassy to try and find dirt,\u201d he added.\n\nBetter yet, when speaking of the Ukrainian prosecutor then-Vice President Joe Biden bragged about getting fired, Graham added, \u201cAnd I\u2019d like to call the prosecutor and have him testify\u2026 Isn\u2019t it kind of odd that the only person that Biden wanted fired was the one investigating his son?\u201d\n\nGraham makes a great point.\n\nBiden and his media enablers have defended Biden using U.S. aid as a quid pro quo to get this prosecutor fired because the prosecutor was seen as corrupt. Okay\u2026 But riddle me this: With all the corruption in Ukraine, why this guy and only this guy \u2014 why the guy who says he was digging into the energy company that hired Hunter Biden for $50,000 a month \u2014 a month! \u2014 when Hunter Biden knows nothing about Ukraine or energy?\n\nAll of this reminds me of the Russia Collusion Hoax when the media\u2019s early reporting detailing how the Obama administration spied on the Trump campaign was memory-holed after Trump accused Obama of spying on his campaign. The media were willing to make stone cold fools of themselves, willing to pretend that all that previous reporting never happened, in order to protect Obama.\n\nWhat a spectacle.\n\nAnd now we have the media doing the same with respect to Ukraine.\n\nNearly three years ago, the media proudly reported, not only about how Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election, but how the DNC sought dirt from a foreign government, and how Comey admitted CrowdStrike and the DNC refused to turn over the server.\n\nBut now\u2026 NOW that it is convenient to the Impeach Trump Narrative, the media have been forced to ignore this previous reporting in order to attack Trump\u2019s legitimate concerns about Ukraine and CrowdStrike as a \u201cconspiracy theory.\u201d\n\nFollow John Nolte on Twitter @NolteNC.
