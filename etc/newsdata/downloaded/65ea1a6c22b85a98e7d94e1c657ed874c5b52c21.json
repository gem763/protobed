But like bitter medicine, they are inevitable,\" he said. \"We have to return life to normal in all provinces and respect the law.\"\n\nThe prime minister said protesters' calls to end corruption were \"correct\" but said the government must be helped to carry out its duties. Ministerial amendments must be approved by parliament.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what the protesters' response to Abdul-Mahdi's statements will be.\n\nThe death toll from three days of protests in Iraq climbed to 26 and more than 1,500 wounded people, as some protesters tried to rally in some areas on Thursday but were dispersed by the security forces, said Ali al-Bayati, a member of the Iraqi Independent High Commission for Human Rights.\n\nHe said that up to 1,509 people were wounded, including 401 security members, pointing out that most of them have left hospitals following treatment.\n\nThe rallies have erupted spontaneously, mostly spurred by youths demanding jobs, improved services such as electricity and water, and an end to endemic corruption in the oil-rich country.\n\nDemonstrations erupted in the capital Baghdad and in several provinces across Iraq on Tuesday and Wednesday, but later turned violent in Baghdad as clashes erupted with the police.\n\nThe protests also spread to other Iraqi provinces when hundreds of protesters attacked and burned several provincial government buildings and offices of leading political parties.\n\nOn Thursday, sporadic protests continued during the day despite a curfew that was imposed in Baghdad starting from 5:00 am local time on Thursday. It will continue until further notice.\n\nAgencies - Xinhua", "description": "BAGHDAD - Iraq's premier on Friday sent a message to protesters, saying their \"legitimate demands\" have been heard and urging them to go home while comparing security measures imposed in the wake of this week's violence, including a curfew, to \"bitter medicine\" that needs to be swallowed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/05/5d97dd84a310cf3e979fd112.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
