We won't pay the taxes. Let the banks pay them,\" they intoned.\n\nHeiko Wimmen, analyst with the International Crisis group, said it appeared Monday's measures were not enough.\n\n\"These mostly technical solutions may put the country on a sounder fiscal footing, but they appear inadequate to the challenge of the protests, which now demand broader, systemic change,\" he said.\n\nThe country's main parties, including those of President Michel Aoun and the Shiite movement Hezbollah, have warned against the impact of a government vacuum and supported the reform package.\n\nMr Hariri met top ambassadors in Beirut on Tuesday, hoping to restore confidence that Lebanon can handle its ballooning debt and unlock a huge aid package.\n\n\"We believe after the announcement of the decisions of the Cabinet yesterday, that we're going to get very positive reactions from them,\" senior government adviser Nadim Munla told reporters.\n\nLebanon's economy has been sliding closer to the abyss in recent months, with public debt soaring past 150 per cent of GDP and ratings agencies grading Lebanese sovereign bonds as \"junk\".\n\nFears of a default have compounded the worries of Lebanese citizens exasperated by the poor quality of public services.\n\nResidents typically suffer daily electricity shortages and unclean water.\n\n\"This protest movement is the only chance the people have,\" said Mounir Malaaeb, an elderly man from the southern city of Tyre who came to the capital to join the rallies.\n\n\"If we give the government another chance we would be crazy. We have been giving them chances since the 1990s.\"\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the Lebanese army was trying to reopen a number of major roads that have been blocked by angry demonstrators for days, the National News Agency said.\n\nIt remained unclear how long protests will last and whether they will maintain their current size, which ranged from thousands to tens of thousands across the country, according to estimates.\n\nGiven the size of the gatherings, the six-day-old mobilisation has been remarkably incident free, with armies of volunteers providing water to protesters and organising first aid tents.\n\nAfter the sun sets, focused protests evolve into an open-air party with loud speakers blasting songs as demonstrators cook food on grills, play cards or smoke from a hookah pipe.\n\nMr Hariri seemed aware that the measures he announced would not quench the people's thirst for change, saying on Monday that the aim of the economic reform plan was not simply to stop people from taking to the streets.\n\nLebanon fought a devastating 15-year civil war until 1990 and many of the country's politicians were warlords fighting along sectarian lines.\n\nOutside of Lebanon, expats in Europe, the US and Africa staged sit-ins and demonstrations in solidarity.\n\nThey gathered in Paris, Switzerland, Cyprus and in several parts of the United States, where they waved Lebanese flags and chortled anti-government slogans.\n\nAFP", "description": ": THE BUSINESS TIMES Government & Economy - [BEIRUT] Lebanese protesters kept the country on lockdown Tuesday as they gathered for a sixth consecutive day demanding new leaders despite the government's adoption of an emergency economic rescue plan. .
