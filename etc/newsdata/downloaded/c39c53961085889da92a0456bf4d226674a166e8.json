Whereas now \u2013 quite understandably \u2013 the haul of 82 as achieved decades earlier by Sam Snead is uppermost in golf\u2019s vernacular it is the figure of 18 \u2013 as relating to Jack Nicklaus and major wins \u2013 that has always seemed to be Woods\u2019s barometer.\n\nWhat can be said without fear of contradiction is that Woods\u2019s latest success, achieved by three shots at the Zozo Championship in Japan on Monday morning, adds to his extraordinary year. The 43-year-old indulged in sporting fairytale by winning his 15th major, the Masters, in April, upon return from the depths of physical despair. Woods cut a jaded figure during so many events thereafter, fuelling speculation about to what extent his Augusta glory had impacted both physically and mentally. When news broke of a fifth knee surgery, as undertaken in August, it felt as if Woods\u2019s career was again heading for neutral gear.\n\nTiger Woods equals Sam Snead\u2019s PGA Tour record with 82nd title Read more\n\nNot so. Woods comfortably held off Hideki Matsuyama to claim a trophy from an 11th different country whilst a professional. Snead was 52 when he won his last PGA Tour title.\n\n\u201cI probably thought about the record when I got north of 50, but then unfortunately I went through some rough patches with my back and didn\u2019t play for a number of years, so that record seemed like it was out of reach,\u201d Woods said. \u201cHaving had my fourth back procedure and being able to come back and play at a decently high level again, it put the number back in the conversation again. Lo and behold, here we are tied.\n\n\u201cAs far as playing until 52, I hope that\u2019s the case. If you would have asked me a few years ago, I would have given you a different answer, but certainly the future looks brighter than it has. The body can\u2019t do what it used to but I can still think my way around the golf course.\u201d\n\nWoods complied rounds of 64, 64, 66 and 67 to reach the 19 under par total sufficient to keep home hero Matsuyama, three shots behind, and the remainder of a stellar field at bay. Rory McIlroy recovered admirably from an opening 72 to share third at 13 under. \u201cStressful,\u201d was the adjective Woods used to describe his feat; albeit he is still to be overhauled when holding at least a three-shot lead with 18 holes to play.\n\n\u201cThis week was a good sign for the future,\u201d Woods added. \u201cHopefully I can be as consistent as Sam was, well into my 40s and early 50s.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s satisfying to dig my way out of it and figure out a way. There were some hard times trying to figure it out but I\u2019ve come back with different games over the years, moving patterns and this one\u2019s been obviously the most challenging. Then having another procedure a couple months ago and again coming back and winning an event? Not easy to do.\u201d\n\nThe PGA Tour\u2019s commercial department will need scraping from the ceiling. The first staging of this tournament, in Chiba, drew massive crowds with even the delayed finish owing to storm disruption not impacting on the topic on everybody\u2019s lips. It helps the Tour in the here and now, of course, to have strong interest in Japan and a global spotlight on Woods making records in the here and now. Tiger remains very good for business, long after so many had written him off. An endearing photo, of Snead signing an autograph for a very young Woods, was circulated via the Tour\u2019s social media channels as the dust settled in Japan.\n\nEffusive analysis arrived from Woods\u2019s fellow players. \u201cHis ball striking was a joke; his distance control was something I\u2019ve never seen,\u201d said Gary Woodland, who partnered Woods during rounds one and two. \u201cHe looked like the best player in the world. It was impressive to watch.\u201d Woods has actually risen to No 6 in the world rankings.\n\nWoods still has captaincy duties for the US team at the President\u2019s Cup to perform before rounding off his 2019. In what provides a further nod towards the cash register \u2013 albeit there is now competitive reasoning \u2013 it would be a surprise if he doesn\u2019t name himself as a wildcard pick.\n\n\u201cOnce he gets that confidence up, he\u2019s tough to beat,\u201d asserted Woods\u2019s caddie, Joe LaCava. More than five months are still to run before Woods begins his Masters defence. The wait feels like a form of sporting cruelty.", "description": "Drawing level with Sam Snead\u2019s PGA Tour victories record set in 1965 with win Japan is a fine achievement but Woods has his sights set on greater milestones to come", "authors": ["Ewan Murray"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69757b7b64d408c15a14e0faf95da8f8aa407d7e/0_35_4738_2842/master/4738.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a0817b60b802ab9ab115df51d78a8b18", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
