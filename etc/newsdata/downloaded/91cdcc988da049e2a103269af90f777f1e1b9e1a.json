Is that what you're asking?,' he asked.\n\nBut a persistent Thurston continued to stand his ground.\n\n'He called six to go again and then on the back of that you scored off the back of that,' he replied.\n\nTrent Robinson was very reluctant to give his take on the call that won his side the grand final\n\nThe frustration on Robinson's face to the grilling clearly showed.\n\n'Look, I don't see that, do you, you felt as though we got lucky there JT?' he angrily replied.\n\nBut Thurston was still keen to get Robinson's thoughts, despite the exchange becoming more heated.\n\n'Honestly, if you're bringing that up at this time, there could have been lots of decisions we could have gone through,' a fired up Robinson replied.\n\n'What are my thoughts on that? I thought that we were under the pump for a lot of that game and we fought hard and we won the game.\n\n'I felt like a lot of controversy at different times, we decided to take advantage of it, and we decided to make a difference and change the momentum of the game and we did.'\n\nThe Roosters scored a match winning try in the next set to claim back to back premierships\n\nReferee Ben Cummins signals six more tackles for the Raiders before changing his mind\n\nFans took to social media to praise Thurston on standing his ground while slamming Robinson for not answering the question.\n\n'JT addresses the elephant in the room because everyone else is too scared to. Trent Robinson answers in the perfect way to try and act if nothing was wrong. That\u2019s how you\u2019d answer if you were guilty,' one fan tweeted.\n\nOne woman added: 'Trent Robinson\u2019s reaction to JT\u2019s incredibly fair question about the #sixagain decision was pretty ordinary. JT had every right to ask about an appalling decision that had a massive impact on the game,' one woman tweeted.\n\n'Unlike Robinson, Thurston didn't mince his words when he expressed his thoughts on the decision earlier in the coverage.\n\n'Dumbfounded. I'm dumbfounded by that,' Thurston told Nine.\n\nThe Roosters went on to become the first side in 26 years to win back to back premierships\n\n'You can hear the referees calling it, 'Six again, six again'. And then he's changed his mind. It was changing the call on the run.\n\n'It is not a good look at all. I would be pretty shattered if I was the Raiders. The next set, Tedesco scores and wins them the match. Really, it is not a great look. As a team, you want to take the referees out of the equation and win the game being a consistent footy team.\n\n'It's just a huge, huge call.'\n\nA shattered Raiders coach Ricky Stuart was just as reluctant as Robinson to comment on the controversy during his post-match press conference.\n\n'It's not the time to talk about it,' Stuart said.\n\n'You know, the Roosters achieved something very special tonight in winning two grand finals in a row. I don't want to take the spotlight off that.'", "description": "Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson has clashed with NRL great Johnathan Thurston live on air over the controversial refereeing call that won his side back to back premierships.", "authors": ["Kylie Stevens For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/06/15/19363412-0-image-a-83_1570372917850.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
