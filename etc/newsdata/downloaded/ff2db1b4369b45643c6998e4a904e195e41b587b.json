The goal of this plan would be to prevent Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s troops or Russian forces from taking control of Syria\u2019s oil fields, which are mainly in Kurdish-held territory in the northeast part of the country. It would also enable the military to retain a foothold in the fight against ISIS militants.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who has opposed Trump's initial decision to withdraw all 1,000 U.S. troops in northeast Syria, presented the idea to the president last week, the Wall Street Journal reported.
