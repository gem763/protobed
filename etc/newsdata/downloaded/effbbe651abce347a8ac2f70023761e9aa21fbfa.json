If you\u2019re trying to find the perfect gift for a friend or colleague, the answer is in your chats, emails, and social media: search their messages for the phrase \u201cI want.\u201d\n\nShep McAllister, Senior Director of Commerce at Lifehacker\u2019s publisher G/O Media, stumbled on this trick while looking for a team gift for Senior Commerce Editor Chelsea Stone: \u201cWe were all in a Slack group chat brainstorming what we wanted to get our coworker Chelsea as a graduation gift. I remembered her mentioning a bag she wanted in Slack a few days prior, and so to find the link, I searched for her Slack username and \u2018I want.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt turned out Chelsea had used that phrase dozens of times, along with \u201cI need,\u201d and several of these instances were about a specific item the team could buy. They went with the bag \u2014 Chelsea says she loves it \u2014 but, Shep says, \u201cwe had several other good ideas from the Slack search we could have gone with as well.\u201d\n\nSo if you need to get a gift for a friend, colleague, or loved one, search everywhere that you\u2019ve chatted with them: Slack, Google Hangouts, emails, texts, any other messaging apps. Search their Facebook and Twitter posts too.\n\nIf you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll see a few direct links to what they want. More likely, you\u2019ll see mentions of more general categories, or problems they\u2019re trying to solve \u2014 problems that your gift could solve.\n\nYou will, of course, stumble on a lot of your friend\u2019s other wants and needs. You might even feel like a stalker! But you\u2019re only looking through the messages they already shared to you or to a public forum, and for a good reason. You can finally give them something they asked for, instead of giving up and buying them whiskey stones.", "description": "It feels great to buy someone something they specifically want, while still keeping it a surprise.
