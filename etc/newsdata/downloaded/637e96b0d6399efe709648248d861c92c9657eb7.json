Biden\u2019s life \u2014 the 1972 car crash that killed his wife and baby daughter \u2014 has drawn renewed attention over a falsehood that the former vice president repeated for years: that the other driver was drunk.\n\nFrom 2001-07, Mr. Biden indicated at least twice that the tractor-trailer driver who hit his wife\u2019s car had been drinking, even though the state official who oversaw the investigation and the driver\u2019s daughter said that wasn\u2019t true.\n\nDuring the 2008 presidential campaign, Pamela Hamill, the daughter of driver Curtis C. Dunn, called on Mr. Biden to apologize publicly after he told a crowd that her father \u201cdrank his lunch\u201d before the accident, according to a 2008 article in the Newark [Delaware] Post.\n\n\u201cA tractor-trailer, a guy who allegedly \u2014 and I never pursued it \u2014 drank his lunch instead of eating his lunch, broadsided my family and killed my wife instantly and killed my daughter instantly and hospitalized my two sons,\u201d Mr. Biden said in 2007.\n\nIn a 2001 speech at the University of Delaware, he referred to an \u201cerrant driver who stopped to drink instead of drive\u201d and \u201chit my children and my wife and killed them,\u201d according to a 2008 report in NewsBusters, citing a 2001 \u201cInside Edition\u201d report.\n\nMr. Biden apparently stopped making the claim after a burst of media attention.\n\nIn a January article in Politico, Ms. Hamill said that Mr. Biden called her to apologize following a 2009 CBS report on the discrepancy.\n\n\u201cHe apologized for hurting my family in any way,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we accepted that \u2014 and kind of end of story from there.\u201d\n\nMr. Dunn, who died in 1999, hit the station wagon driven by 30-year-old Neilia Biden as she drove to buy a Christmas tree with the Bidens\u2019 three young children: Beau, 4; Hunter, 3, and Naomi, 13 months.\n\nThe rig overturned as Mr. Dunn swerved to avoid the collision, but he \u201cran to the wrecked car and was the first to offer assistance,\u201d the Post reported.\n\nNow-retired Delaware Superior Court Judge Jerome O. Herlihy, who oversaw the investigation as chief deputy attorney general, told Politico, \u201cShe had a stop sign. The truck driver did not.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, he told the Post that rumors about alcohol playing a role in the accident were \u201cincorrect.\u201d\n\nThis is awful. Did you know for years @JoeBiden told people his wife and 13-month-old daughter were killed by a drunk driver, when in fact the accident was tragically her fault. The truck driver was haunted by the accident until he died.https://t.co/f41yNvU8RY \u2014 Rosie memos (@almostjingo) October 16, 2019\n\n\n\nTownhall\u2019s Guy Benson called the vice president\u2019s inaccurate references to drinking, which first appeared in 2001, \u201cbizarre and disturbing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole situation is sad enough, why embellish it with what amounts to be an unsupported smear of a man who \u2014 according to the authorities \u2014 was not drunk, did not cause the accident, and immediately sought to \u2018render assistance\u2019 to the victims?\u201d asked Mr. Benson in a Thursday op-ed.\n\nAn extremely difficult and sensitive topic to cover.\n\n\n\nWhoa: Did Joe Biden Falsely Smear the Truck Driver Involved in the Car Crash That Killed His First Wife and Daughter? https://t.co/j6TXTXgoCG \u2014 Townhall.com (@townhallcom) October 17, 2019\n\n\n\nJoe Biden Lied for Years about the Car Accident that Claimed the Life of his Wife and Daughter\n\nhttps://t.co/rpcVyg0MTu \u2014 RedState (@RedState) October 17, 2019\n\n\n\nMr. Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential primary front-runner, has been criticized for embellishing his speeches with exaggerations and inaccuracies, such as his claim that he met with Parkland students at the White House after the 2018 shooting, even though he left office in January 2017.\n\nRedState\u2019s Elizabeth Vaughn said Mr. Biden\u2019s \u201cmischaracterization of this accident doesn\u2019t surprise me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of a pattern of behavior that we\u2019ve come to associate with Biden,\u201d she said in a Thursday post. \u201cHe has a history of embellishing events which have occurred and occasionally inventing entire stories out of whole cloth if it serves his purpose. Put another way, this man\u2019s word is not to be trusted.\u201d\n\nThe Biden boys recovered from injuries sustained in the crash, which happened six weeks after Mr. Biden was elected to his first term in the Senate. Beau Biden died in 2015 of cancer.\n\nIn the 2008 article, Ms. Hamill said she worried that without a Biden rebuttal, the \u201cdrunk driver\u201d angle could eventually take root in the public narrative. The claim had already appeared in several articles about Mr. Biden leading up to the election.\n\n\u201cSuppose he becomes the next vice president,\u201d she told the Post. \u201cMovies could be made about him and books could be written about him, all falsely portraying my father as a drunk driver. We need to set the record straight and clear my father\u2019s name right now before this goes any further.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
