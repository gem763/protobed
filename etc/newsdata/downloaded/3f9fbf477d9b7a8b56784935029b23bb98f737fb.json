Horowitz learned firsthand as a CEO how elusive it can be when he took stock of his company, only to discover it was made up of \u201cscreamers who intimidated their people,\u201d others who \u201cneglected to give any feedback,\u201d and at least one compulsive liar who excelled at sucking up to Horowitz and also making up stories from whole cloth.\n\nHorowitz says creating culture was a missing part of his education, and in this new book \u2014 a follow-up to his best-selling \u201cThe Hard Thing About Hard Things\u201d \u2014 he does his best to fill that gap for other CEOs, using his own experience, as well as lessons gleaned from historical figures Toussaint Louverture and Genghis Khan, along with Shaka Senghor, a contemporary who served time for murder and today is a criminal justice reform advocate.\n\nIt\u2019s an instructive and novel combination, and we suggest picking up the book, especially if you love history. In the meantime, we sat down recently with Horowitz to talk about its timing and whether some of the biggest cultural blow-ups in the startup industry \u2014 Uber and WeWork \u2014 could have been avoided. These excerpts have been edited for length and clarity. Note that we\u2019ll have more of the conversation \u2014 including Horowitz\u2019s thoughts about dual-class shares \u2014 for readers of Extra Crunch on Monday.\n\nTC: You\u2019ve just written a book about culture that\u2019s coming out just as a lot of questions are being raised about culture because of WeWork. What happened there?\n\nBH: [Cofounder Adam Neumann] had a certain kind of culture there. He had some holes \u2014 some great strengths and great holes. And sometimes that happens. When you\u2019re really good at part of it, you can delude yourself into thinking that you\u2019ve got everything you need, when you have some massive incompleteness.\n\nAdam is so amazing. Like, the way they got all the money and everything. And the vision was so spectacular. And everybody there believed it, and they recruited some phenomenal talent. But when you\u2019re that optimistic, it does help to have something in the culture that says [allows] people to bring you the bad news, like, if the accounting is all over the place or what have you.\n\nTC: As with Uber\u2019s Travis Kalanick, whose culture also came under fire, Neumann operated in very plain sight. He wasn\u2019t hiding who he was or what he was spending.\n\nBH: Right, everybody knew how Travis was running the company. Everyone in Silicon Valley knew, let alone everyone on the board. The culture was published. You can look up Uber\u2019s values [from that period].\n\nTravis designed, I think, a really compelling culture, and believed in it, and published it. And the consequences of what he was missing were also super well-known. It\u2019s only when board members think people are coming after them that [they take an interest in these things].\n\nTC: What are the biggest lessons in these two cases?\n\nBH: I obviously know more about Uber [as a Lyft investor who follows the space]. In Uber\u2019s case, it\u2019s a very subtle thing. Travis had a really good code. But he had a bug in it.\n\nI think it was reported that, like, Travis encouraged bad behavior. I don\u2019t think he did at all. I just think he didn\u2019t make it clear that legal and ethical [considerations] were more important than competitiveness. As a result, when left to their own devices, in a distributed organization where there was a lot of distributed power, that combination had people doing things that were out of bounds.\n\nAnd he was making everybody so much money. And the company was growing so fast that, for the board members, I suspect they were like, \u2018As long as it\u2019s making money, I\u2019m not going to worry about what happens next.\u2019\n\nTo me, the unfair part is, like, they shouldn\u2019t get any credit at the end. Whatever you\u2019re blaming Travis for [you should blame them, too] because they didn\u2019t see it, either. I think that\u2019s a charitable way of putting it.\n\nThe reason I wanted to go through [how to create business culture] in the book is so if you\u2019re a new CEO, you can see, look, this thing looks like a small problem, but it\u2019s going to become a big problem. Ethics are a bit like security issues. They\u2019re not a problem at all until they\u2019re a problem. Then they\u2019re existential.\n\nTC: Why was this issue on your mind?\n\nBH: A few things. First, it was the thing that I had the most difficult time with as a CEO. People would say, \u2018Ben, pay attention to culture, it really is the key.\u2019 But when you were like, \u2018Okay, great, how do i do that?\u2019 it was like, \u2018Um, maybe you should have a meeting about it.\u2019 Nobody could convey: what it was, how you dealt with it, how you designed it. So I felt like I was missing a piece of my own education.\n\nAlso, when I look at the work I do now, it\u2019s the most important thing. What I say to people at the firm is that nobody 10 or 20 or 30 years from now is going to remember what deals we\u2019ve won or lost or what the returns were on this or that. You\u2019re going to remember what it felt like to work here and to do business with us and what kind of imprint we put on the world. And that\u2019s our culture. That\u2019s our behavior. We can\u2019t have any drift from that. And I think that\u2019s true for every company.\n\nOn top of that, the companies in Silicon Valley have grown so fast and become so powerful that they\u2019re getting a lot of criticism about their culture now, which, some of it is fair enough. But the proposed solutions are wacky . . . so it kind of felt like somebody had to make a positive contribution and not just a critique about, like, okay, here\u2019s what you ought to do.\n\nTC: They\u2019re also distributed, as you noted with Uber, but I don\u2019t think you talk about remote workforces in this book. Do you have thoughts about establishing a culture where individuals are scattered here and there?\n\nBH: I didn\u2019t talk about remote workforces and that one is interesting because it\u2019s evolving because the tool sets are changing. It used to be nearly impossible for an engineering organization to be distributed and to be effective, because the information flow wasn\u2019t good enough and the build systems weren\u2019t good enough. And so for years, Microsoft would only buy companies that they could move to Redmond.\n\nLately, due to things like Slack and Tandem, people are getting better results with it. And I think a lot of the cultural techniques intersect with the tools quite a bit. But then you have to set the culture through electronic media more than you would walking around, catching somebody doing thing in a meeting.\n\nWe just did a thing on email the other day. We have this cultural value, which is: we don\u2019t like to criticize entrepreneurs. I don\u2019t care if we think your idea is stupid or whatever. You\u2019re trying to create something from nothing. You\u2019re trying to chase your dream. We support that, period. So if you get on Twitter and do what Bill Gurley does and say, \u2018That company is a stupid piece of shit. It\u2019ll never made a $1 and blah blah blah,\u2019 like, you get fired for that. [Similarly] on our podcast, we have a news segment and I didn\u2019t want us to do a story on \u2018WeWork, the cautionary tale.\u2019 That\u2019s not us. And it\u2019s a cultural statement. There are a million people who are going to write that story; we were like, let them write that story.\n\nSo you don\u2019t have to be in person to set the tone, but you do have to be thoughtful about the way you do it, and who all hears it.\n\nTC: Why weave in the cultural figures that you have? There are so many people you could have included, and you focused on these three individuals.\n\nBH: It\u2019s a weird origin story, but Prince years ago put out an album called 3121, and he opened this club in Vegas called the 3121, and he would perform there, like, every weekend. And the show would start at 10 and he would show up at midnight or 1 a.m., but during that time in between, he would show these old films with these really interesting dancers in these elaborate clothes. And you\u2019d just be watching these old guys, and then Prince would start to splice in [his own movies, including] \u201cUnder the Cherry Moon\u201d and \u201cPurple Rain,\u201d and you\u2019d go, well those are the dance moves from those guys [in the older films] and that\u2019s a quote from those guys And you realize: that was what he was trying to express. And I thought, you know, I finally really understand him. And I thought, you know, [these three] have really influenced my views on culture [for a variety of reasons] and it would be a good way to tell this story.\n\nMore on Monday . . .", "description": "Ben Horowitz, the co-founder of the venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, has a new book coming out this coming Monday titled \u201cWhat You Do is Who You Are,\u201d that takes a look at how to create \u201cculture\u201d at a company.
