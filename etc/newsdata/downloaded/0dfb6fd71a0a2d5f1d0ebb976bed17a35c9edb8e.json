A field organizer for Sunrise Movement in Des Moines, she was attending the Polk County Steak Fry, the single largest gathering of Democrats in the state of Iowa, and she had her questions ready for Joe Biden when she met him.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m part of the Sunrise Movement and we\u2019re fighting for a Green New Deal,\u201d Mankel says in a video that captured the moment, which went viral on Twitter yesterday. She\u2019s face-to-face with Biden, who is already grabbing both of her hands. He responds, \u201cWell, you get a better deal from me than anybody,\u201d and suddenly releases and grabs them again. He talks over her while Mankel continues her very specific line of questioning. \u201cI\u2019m just wondering how can we trust you when you\u2019ve continually broken your pledge not to take fossil-fuel money and held fundraisers with a CEO,\u201d she challenges. \u201cI have not, that is not true,\u201d Biden replies \u2014 still holding her hands. (A few weeks ago, Biden attended an event co-hosted by Andrew Goldman, a former adviser and co-founder of a fossil-fuel company called Western LNG.)\n\n\ud83c\udfed @JoeBiden's climate plan doesn't call for a ban on fracking natural gas\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfed\ud83c\udfed Andrew Goldman, who recently hosted a fundraiser for Biden, co-founded a natural gas company\n\n\n\n\ud83c\udfed\ud83c\udfed\ud83c\udfed Heather Zichal (Biden's climate adviser) has made a million dollars off of natural gas\n\n\n\n\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14 pic.twitter.com/dbDQZIuRC5 \u2014 Sunrise Movement \ud83c\udf05 (@sunrisemvmt) September 23, 2019\n\nMankel keeps going. \u201cHow about your climate adviser Heather Zichal \u2014 she\u2019s actually made a million dollars from the fossil-fuel industry?\u201d she asks. \u201cWe need a Green New Deal, not more corruption.\u201d Then the former vice-president takes her left hand in both of his, pats it like he\u2019s just given her a nickel to go buy something nice for herself, and says, \u201cThank you for being \u2014 for admiring me so much.\u201d He turns away from her and smirks. A guy watching in the background chuckles.\n\n\u201cThat look at the end of the video is me realizing I blew it,\u201d Mankel told the Cut. Biden\u2019s holding her hands had thrown her off, she said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure how clear it is, but my hands are limp, and I pulled them away at first,\u201d she continued. \u201cI was prepared for him to challenge me or turn away from me; I wasn\u2019t ready for him to take my hands in his and speak to me as if I couldn\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\nFor months, Biden has faced criticism over the way he physically interacts with women \u2014 be it through invading their personal space in a way that feels uncomfortable and demeaning or under a veneer of grandfatherly affection.\n\nBut Biden has another tactic he uses on women, often younger ones, who confront him: sarcasm at their expense. When he sneeringly tells Mankel, \u201cThanks so much for admiring me,\u201d he\u2019s winking at supporters, who can laugh at the harping Biden has to deal with from people like Mankel when all the guy is trying to do is eat a fried steak. He expressed the very same sentiment to another woman elsewhere in Iowa: writer Lyz Lenz, who confronted Biden about his record on LGBTQ issues while moderating a panel over the weekend. \u201cYou\u2019re a lovely person,\u201d Biden said sarcastically to Lenz onstage after she pressed him on the fact that he had originally voted for both Don\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell and the Defense of Marriage Act before later voting to repeal them. As he passed her on the way out, she says he told her \u201cdryly,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a real sweetheart.\u201d\n\nFor Biden, who has yet to really pin down his own convictions as a candidate beyond his service as VP to Barack Obama, politics is theater. And his sarcasm reveals who is audience is. When he joked, \u201cGo easy on me, kid,\u201d to Kamala Harris onstage during the Democratic debates in July, he was barely talking to her. He was talking about her, around her, referencing his own seniority while appealing to those who might agree with a characterization of Harris\u2019s criticism on his record on race as unreasonable or inappropriate. By turning the joke around on Harris \u2014 and on Mankel and on Lenz \u2014 he avoids engaging with the substance of his female critics\u2019 arguments and casts himself as a more rational, even-keeled foil. (Consider the way Biden alternatively handles confrontation with male opponents, some of whom have come at him with real aggression: When Julian Castro needled him for seeming to \u201cforget\u201d his own health-care plan at another debate, Biden pushed back, jostling with Castro for the last word.)\n\nThe intent of smiling, joking, and walking away from a female critic is to neutralize her very right to make the critique. For Mankel, a young woman genuinely trying to find out how Biden feels about issues that matter to her, it almost worked. His dismissive reply meant she was left feeling like she was at fault for failing to engage the candidate. Now she feels that \u201cthe VP simply didn\u2019t see me as a community member worth listening to.\u201d \u201cI had real questions,\u201d she said. \u201cAn we want real answers, damn it.\u201d", "description": "Two interactions between Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and critics show has a habit of responding with sarcastic condescension to young women who dare question his record.", "authors": ["Bridget Read"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/25/25-joe-biden-getty-2.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
