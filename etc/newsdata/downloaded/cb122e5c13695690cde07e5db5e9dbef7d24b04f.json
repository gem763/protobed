That includes 9,277 in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nIt has been trimming its total as part of a plan to cut costs. Walgreens has been hit by challenges including reimbursement cuts and lower price increases for branded drugs.\n\nDrugstores also face competition in areas outside their pharmacies from online options like Amazon.com.\n\nWalgreens said Monday that it has raised its annual savings target from its cost cutting program to $1.8 billion by fiscal 2022, up from a previous goal to exceed $1.5 billion.\n\nOn top of shuttering the clinics, the company has also reportedly been cutting staff at its headquarters.\n\nMore than 100 employees at the Deerfield, Illinois, office were let go, according to sources for the Chicago Tribune.\n\nWalgreens Global Chief Financial Officer James Kehoe reportedly told an earnings call on Monday that 'restructuring' was underway at the firm's HQ.\n\nThe Tribune also reported that staff were told they will not get annual bonuses this year.\n\nIn the final quarter of fiscal 2019, Walgreens earnings tumbled 55% to $677 million, due in part to charges from its cost-cutting program. Adjusted results totaled $1.43 per share.\n\nRevenue climbed 1.5% to $33.95 billion.\n\nThe results surpassed Wall Street expectations. Analysts expected, on average, earnings of $1.41 per share on $33.86 billion in revenue, according to Zacks Investment Research.\n\nBoylan termed the quarter good but not great. He said in a research note that Walgreens sales turned out better than expected, and that should continue.\n\nThe analyst said he expects Walgreens to grow its business as health plans narrow the network of pharmacies they cover in exchange for a break on pharmacy costs.\n\nShares of Walgreens slipped 12 cents to $55.30 in Monday afternoon trading.\n\nThe stock had dropped 19% since the beginning of the year as of Friday's close. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones industrial average, of which Walgreens is a component, has climbed nearly 16%.", "description": "Walgreens will shutter nearly 40% of clinics in its stores as it looks to cut costs.
