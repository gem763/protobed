Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\nWhat happened in the Commons tonight?\n\n(Image: UK PARLIAMENTARY RECORDING UNIT HANDOUT/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nMPs voted in favour of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill at its second reading (which despite the name is its first hurdle).\n\nThis is legislation that turns Boris Johnson's Brexit deal into UK law.\n\nIn a historic move, MPs finally backed it 329-299 - which naturally is 52% to 48%.\n\nBut crucially, they voted against the \u2018programme motion\u2019.\n\nThe programme motion sets how much time the Commons has to scrutinise a Bill.\n\nJohnson had wanted to restrict this to just three days in order to meet his \u201cdo or die\u201d pledge to leave the EU by October 31.\n\nMPs said that was too short for such a momentous piece of legislation and voted down the programme motion by 322 votes to 308.\n\nWill EU leaders agree to delay Brexit?\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nYes, it looks like it.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk tonight sent a message to all 27 EU leaders telling them they should delay Brexit for three months.\n\nThis is in accordance with the request MPs forced Boris Johnson to send over the weekend.\n\n\"Boris Johnson's decision to pause the process of ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement, and in order to avoid a no-deal Brexit,\" Mr Tusk wrote.\n\n\"I will recommend the EU27 accept the UK request for an extension. For this I will propose a written procedure.\"\n\nA written procedure suggests a special summit in Brussels would not be convened.\n\nWhat happens now with the Brexit deal?\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBoris Johnson had warned he would pull the whole Withdrawal Agreement Bill if he lost the vote on the programme motion.\n\nInstead he \u201cpaused\u201d the Bill while he waits to see what Brussels decides.\n\nBut he could now drop the Bill after all and push for an election after the EU indicated it'll back a three-month delay to January 31.\n\nThat is because he had previously threatened to do exactly that if a three-month extension was granted. He had told MPs: \u201cI will in no way allow months more of this.\n\n\u201cIf Parliament refuses to allow Brexit to happen, and instead gets its way and decides to delay everything until January or possibly longer, in no circumstances can the government continue with this.\n\n\u201cWith great regret I must say the Bill will have to be pulled and we will have to go forward to a general election .\"\n\nCan Boris Johnson actually force an election?\n\nNo. No matter what he claims, he needs MPs' permission. More of this further down this article.\n\nCan Brexit still happen on October 31?\n\n(Image: Peter Summers)\n\nTechnically yes, but it\u2019s very unlikely. The only way is if EU leaders refuse an extension.\n\nNotably the PM and No10 refused to guarantee the UK will still leave on October 31. The pledge - usually throughout his speeches - was notably absent tonight.\n\nBut the PM said he would ramp up preparations for a no-deal exit just in case.\n\nWill Brexit happen with a deal by October 31?\n\n(Image: Peter Summers)\n\nNo.\n\nWhatever happens Boris Johnson will now have missed this deadline, despite saying he would rather \u201cdie in a ditch\u201d than remain in the EU after that date.\n\nEven if the EU grants him a short extension there is no guarantee his Bill will get through Parliament in its current form.\n\nThat is because Opposition MPs have tabled amendments to the Bill.\n\nThey include calls for the UK to stay in a customs union, for a second referendum and a move to stop Johnson crashing out without a deal later down the track.\n\nMPs who voted for the Withdrawal Bill at the second reading, including many of the 19 Labour MPs who backed it this time, could turn against it at the final showdown if these amendments are not accepted.\n\nWill there be a general election?\n\n(Image: Peter Summers)\n\nThat depends on the length and terms of any extension.\n\nThere are three paths to an election.\n\nBoris Johnson could try again to overturn the Fixed Term Parliament Act but this requires a majority of two thirds of MPs (434).\n\nThis means Labour can block the move.\n\nThe second way is for Johnson to try to repeal the Act entirely but this would allow opposition parties to amend the Bill.\n\nThey could add votes at age 16 or a second referendum as the price for granting an election.\n\nThe other method is for the Prime Minister to be ousted in a vote of no confidence.\n\nMPs would then have fourteen days in which to form an alternative government.\n\nIf that proves impossible an election follows 25 working days later.\n\nThe risk with this is either Jeremy Corbyn or a government of national unity could take over and then arrange for soft Brexit that would be put to a referendum.\n\nHow did MPs vote on the deal tonight?\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nMPs voted 329-299 for the second reading of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - a majority of 30.\n\nBear in mind this was only a vote 'in principle' on the first steps of the Brexit deal.\n\nMany of the 19 Labour backers were expected to back amendments on a customs union or second referendum which PM said was unacceptable. Meaning they could have turned against it later.\n\nBut it was backed by 285 Tories, 19 Labour MPs and 25 Independents - most of them ex-Tories who lost the whip last month for trying to block no-deal.\n\nEurophile Ken Clarke, former ministers Amber Rudd, David Gauke, and author of the Letwin amendment Oliver Letwin were among those who backed the deal.\n\nA number of former and suspended Labour MPs also voted to give the deal a reading at Committee Stage, including Kelvin Hopkins and John Woodcock.\n\nIt was opposed by 217 Labour MPs, the SNP, Plaid Cymru, the Independent Group for Change, 8 Independents and the DUP. Opponents were furious at the deal for watering down workers' rights and leaving a customs border in the Irish Sea.\n\nFive Labour MPs abstained or did not vote - Derek Twigg, Justin Madders, Yvonne Fovargue, Ronnie Campbell and committed Brexiteer Kate Hoey. Independents Caroline Nokes and Chris Williamson also did not vote.\n\nWho were the 19 Labour MPs who backed the deal at second reading?\n\nKevin Barron\n\nSarah Champion\n\nRosie Cooper\n\nJon Cruddas\n\nGloria De Piero\n\nJim Fitzpatrick\n\nCaroline Flint\n\nMike Hill\n\nDan Jarvis\n\nEmma Lewell-Buck\n\nJohn Mann\n\nGrahame Morris\n\nLisa Nandy\n\nMelanie Onn\n\nStephanie Peacock\n\nJo Platt\n\nRuth Smeeth\n\nLaura Smith\n\nGareth Snell\n\nHow did MPs vote on delay tonight?\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nMPs voted 322-308 to reject Boris Johnson's 'programme motion' to rush his deal Bill through Parliament in three days.\n\nIt was backed by 285 Tories, 18 Independents and 5 Labour MPs - Sir Kevin Barron, Jim Fitzpatrick, Caroline Flint, Kate Hoey and John Mann.\n\nIt was opposed by 233 Labour MPs, the SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru, DUP, 15 Independents and The Independent Group for Change.\n\nThree Labour MPs abstained or did not vote - Ronnie Campbell, Rosie Cooper and Derek Twigg. As did Independents Caroline Nokes and Chris Williamson.\n\nWhat Boris Johnson's Brexit deal means - recap\n\nBoris Johnson finally agreed a Brexit deal with the EU on 17 October 2019, though it still needs approval by MPs and is now on ice.\n\nThe 64-page list of amendments keeps a transition period up to 31 December 2020 and the \u00a339bn divorce bill. But it scraps the Irish backstop, an insurance policy designed at preventing a hard border between Northern Ireland the Republic.\n\nIn the backstop's place would effectively be a hybrid system:\n\nNorthern Ireland and Britain would share a legal customs territory - technically forcing customs checks on goods crossing the 310-mile border with the Republic. But in practice, to avoid checks at the border, the checks will instead happen when goods reach Northern Ireland on the island of Ireland. Critics say this puts a customs border across the Irish Sea - more of this below. Northern Ireland and the Republic would share some EU single market rules - forcing checks on manufactured and agricultural products crossing the Irish Sea.\n\nThe Northern Ireland Assembly - known as Stormont - will get a vote every four years on whether to let EU law continue. But this vote could be passed by a simple majority - denying the DUP a veto on staying under EU laws long-term.\n\nMeanwhile commitments on workers' rights are deprioritised - moved to the non-legally-binding Political Declaration for agreement later.\n\nFor a full explainer click here.", "description": "Yet again a night of drama in the Commons has ended in delay.
