We\u2019re doing a number of things very very well, but we\u2019ve been way too inward-looking.\n\n\"You\u2019ve seen with the change in structure. We\u2019ve had too many layers, we\u2019ve had too much process and we\u2019ve been way too inward-looking in terms of producing our own content, the way in which we go to market.\n\n\"This is about having a completely fresh view.\"\n\nMore appointments coming\n\nMs Valente, who will join Seven on October 21, is Mr Warburton's first major executive appointment following his return to Seven in August, when he took over from former chief executive Tim Worner. She will be one of eight direct reports to Mr Warburton after he slashed the number of divisions reporting to him last week from 17.\n\nAlso reporting to Mr Warburton are chief revenue officer Kurt Burnette, commercial director Bruce McWilliam, chief financial officer Warwick Lynch, chief people and culture officer Katie McGrath and Seven West Australia chief executive Maryna Fewster.\n\nSeven is about to appoint a chief digital officer and is also looking for a chief content officer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeven's strong performance in news, AFL and morning television has kept its share of total ratings for 2019 at a healthy level, but it has taken a hit in the valuable 7.30pm prime-time slot, Mr Warburton said.\n\n\"While we\u2019ve lost a bit of momentum in our 7.30 schedule, at least the content we\u2019re putting to air in October is much more back to stuff you can feel proud about in terms of Seven \u2013 Secret Bridesmaids' Business, Bride & Prejudice and Dirty Dancing,\" Mr Warburton said.\n\n\"But we\u2019ve launched those programs at a time when the others, particularly Nine, has had The Block in market for a long period of time, and other than a couple of hours a week where Ten have been beating us with The Masked Singer ... we\u2019re still incredibly strong through all the demographics in the last couple of weeks.\"\n\nMr Warburton will unveil Seven's major programming changes, shows and strategy for 2020 later this month. He has said he wants to retire old formats, target new demographics, bring Seven's average viewer age down and launch new shows more effectively \u2013 projects in which the new CMO will have a key role.", "description": "James Warburton has given his former APN Outdoor colleague a wide brief across Seven's portfolio.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.54%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_1411%2C$y_349/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c09635f6235bd0498fe08997678f0abe3f11f689", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
