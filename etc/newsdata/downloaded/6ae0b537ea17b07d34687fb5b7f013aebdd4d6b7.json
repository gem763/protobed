REUTERS/Thomas Mukoya\n\nNAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya\u2019s economy grew by 5.6% in the second quarter of this year, down from expanding 6.4% in the same period a year earlier, the statistics office said on Monday.\n\nIt attributed the deceleration in growth to a slowdown in the key farming sector, which accounts for close to a third of output, manufacturing and transportation.\n\n\u201cAgriculture\u2019s performance as well as that of electricity and water supply were mostly hampered by a delay in the onset of the long rains,\u201d the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said in a report.\n\nFarming, which includes forestry and fishing, grew by 4.1% during the period, down from 6.5% a year earlier.\n\nThe governor of the central bank Patrick Njoroge last week maintained a full year growth forecast of 6%, citing robust bookings in the tourism sector.\n\nThe bank will review its forecast after Monday\u2019s release of the second quarter data, he said.\n\nWith a well-diversified economy that does not depend on a single commodity or sector, the East African nation has enjoyed rapid growth rates in recent years, but critics say the growth is not enough to lift many citizens out of biting poverty.", "description": "Kenya's economy grew by 5.6% in the second quarter of this year, down from expanding 6.4% in the same period a year earlier, the statistics office said on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435554032&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8T10I-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
