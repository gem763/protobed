Some took liberties with the question, instead choosing to recount a more personal hardship.\n\nHere are their answers.\n\nJoe Biden highlighted personal loss, recalling how his wife and daughter died in a car accident in 1972, six weeks after he was elected to the Senate. \u201cI lost my faith for a while,\u201d Biden said. He also mentioned the death of his son, Beau, to brain cancer in 2015. He said he recovered by \u201cfinding purpose\u201d and devoting himself to public policy.\n\nElizabeth Warren described the difficulties she faced as an expectant mother in the workplace. She said she was dismissed by the principal at the public school where she was teaching. \u201cHere\u2019s resilience,\u201d she said. \u201cI said, \u2018I\u2019ll go to law school.'\u201d\n\nBernie Sanders chose two difficulties, the first growing up working poor as the son of an immigrant and the second struggling to break into politics. After several unsuccessful bids for office, he became mayor of Burlington, Vt., he said, \u201cwith a 10-vote margin.\u201d\n\nKamala Harris also highlighted political courage, saying she faced skepticism in each political bid she made. \u201cI was told each time, \u2018it can\u2019t be done,'\u201d she said. She ultimately broke racial barriers, she said, drawing on lessons from her mother about perseverance.\n\nPete Buttigieg recounted the difficulty he faced coming out as gay while he was serving as the mayor of South Bend, Ind., which he described as a \u201csocially conservative community.\u201d He feared the move would be \u201cthe ultimate career-ending professional setback.\u201d The lesson, he said, was about knowing \u201cwhat\u2019s worth more to you than winning.\u201d\n\nAndrew Yang described hurdles he faced in trying to start a business after he gave up practicing law. He ultimately became a successful entrepreneur, but not before losing scores of investors and a great deal of money. \u201cMy parents still told people I was a lawyer,\u201d he quipped.\n\nCory Booker cited his unsuccessful campaign for mayor of Newark, in 2002, when he \u201ctook on the political machine,\u201d as he put it. \u201cAnd boy, did they fight back.\u201d He ran again four years later and won.\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke described the experience of watching his hometown of El Paso become the location of a mass shooting that left 22 people dead in August. O\u2019Rourke, who has made gun control a focal point of his campaign, vowed, \u201cWe were not defeated by that, nor were we defined by that.\u201d\n\nAmy Klobuchar highlighted personal hardship, first her father\u2019s alcoholism and his difficult decision to seek treatment and then her newborn\u2019s illness that motivated her to advocate for a measure in Minnesota guaranteeing new mothers and their babies 48-hour stays in the hospital.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro described returning home to San Antonio after law school and facing an ethical dilemma. He was simultaneously working as a lawyer and serving on the San Antonio city council. When his law firm pressed him to vote for a land deal that he opposed because of insufficient environmental protections, he quit the firm, he said, siding with \u201cthe people I was there to represent.\u201d", "description": "Ten Democratic candidates will be on stage Thursday night for the third debate of the presidential primary race. The previous two debates have been held over two nights, but the Democratic National Committee tightened the donor and polling requirements for participation, decreasing the field.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-washpost-wordpress-uploads/primetime/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/09/12200342/2019-09-13T000048Z_1400696501_HP1EF9D001C2D_RTRMADP_5_USA-ELECTION-DEBATE.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517"}
