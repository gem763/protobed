A party needs at least 116 seats to have an absolute majority.\n\nThe polls put the PSD on between 24% and 31%, with the two far-left parties which propped up the prime minister\u2019s previous minority government, the radical Left Bloc and the Communists, at 9-12% and 5-7% respectively.\n\nNegotiations to form a government will start on Monday and could last days or weeks depending on the final result. In 2015, Costa \u2013 who had finished second behind the PSD \u2013 took less than two months to seal an unexpected alliance with the Left Bloc and Communists known as the geringon\u00e7a, or improvised solution.\n\nFour years later, however, the hard-left is pushing for increases in public spending and has accused Costa of veering to the right. The prime minister has already ruled out a formal coalition, but may try to renew his governing pact with one or both parties.\n\nHe may also have another potential governing partner in the upstart People-Animals-Nature party (PAN), which was on course to capture two to six seats, up from just one when it first entered parliament in the last election. The party has said it is ready to support Costa if he commits to its environmentalist proposals.\n\nCosta, 58, has reversed some of the more unpopular austerity measures, including cuts to public sector wages and pensions, introduced by the previous PSD-led government in the wake of the eurozone debt crisis, while still managing to bring the country\u2019s budget deficit down to nearly zero.\n\nHe has won praise both at home and in Brussels for combining fiscal discipline with successful measures to stimulate the economy, which is now growing faster than the EU average, helped by rising exports and a booming tourism industry that saw more tourists visit Portugal last year than it has inhabitants.\n\nThe PSD, still associated in the public mind with deep cutbacks and a three-year recession that ended in 2014, was unable to profit enough from a series of recent scandals to hit the Socialists, ranging from a nepotism row to the alleged involvement of a former minister in an army cover-up of the theft of weapons from a military base.\n\n\u201cThe most probable outcome is a Socialist party minority government with support from radical left parties or, less likely, the small environmentalist party PAN,\u201d said Federico Santi, an analyst at political risk consultancy Eurasia Group.", "description": "Party set for a second term with more seats but just short of 116 seats needed to rule outright", "authors": ["Jon Henley"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef90673c07680845e5d65a22770fbacd6cc55ce5/0_95_5319_3191/master/5319.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=164cfb5ac1dc9cc1986673ec2a634787", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
