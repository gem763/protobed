The Trump administration is withholding the complaint from Congress, sparking outrage and endless speculation about just what, exactly, Trump might have said.\n\nTo the U.S. president\u2019s fiercest critics, the situation is already prompting talk of impeachment and even conviction \u2014 what if Trump agreed to an illicit quid pro quo with a foreign leader for political gain?\n\nAccording to multiple news reports, Trump told his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, that relations with the U.S. would improve only if Zelensky ordered an investigation into the Bidens.\n\n\u201cIf this actually happened, @realDonaldTrump should be impeached and removed from office without delay,\u201d George Conway, a conservative attorney and frequent Trump detractor who is married to White House adviser Kellyanne Conway, wrote Thursday on Twitter.\n\nTo the U.S. president\u2019s defenders, it\u2019s just another case of media bias and an angry anti-Trump cabal inside the government lashing out \u2014 what\u2019s the whistleblower\u2019s agenda? And so what if the president pressured foreign leaders to root out potential corruption?\n\n\u201cIt looks to me like another deep state attack,\u201d Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), a top Trump booster, said Friday morning on Fox News. \u201cWe have seen this over and over and over in this administration from anonymous sources deep inside the bureaucracy.\u201d\n\nYes, we\u2019ve been here before.\n\nAlmost every time a controversy emerges that seemingly imperils Trump\u2019s presidency, the same playbook unfolds. Amid angry calls for impeachment, Trump\u2019s allies largely sidestep a debate over the event itself, cast blame elsewhere and start rationalizing the president\u2019s behavior. Countless times already, it\u2019s worked as an effective counterattack that gives Trump cover as he defends his norm-busting behavior.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re seeing a steady arc of removing constraints and institutional norms that continue to erode so that it\u2019s really anything goes as to what he\u2019s willing to say and do to advance whatever grievance he has at the moment,\u201d said Randall Samborn, a former federal prosecutor and spokesman on the George W. Bush-era special counsel investigation into who leaked the identity of CIA operative Valerie Plame.\n\n\u201cThere just don\u2019t seem to be any constraints upon him institutionally or legally or as a matter of political discretion to refrain from doing or saying almost anything,\u201d he added.\n\nOne of the biggest frustrations so far stems from the inability to know precisely what\u2019s happened, even as new details are dribbling out in the media.\n\nTrump\u2019s Justice Department is refusing to relay the content of the complaint to Congress \u2014 as is normally required by law \u2014 prompting Democrats to suggest a cover-up and threaten lawsuits. Others, including Trump defenders, have raised the possibility that the U.S. president\u2019s communications are constitutionally protected.\n\nTrump on Friday did not deny that he discussed Biden with a foreign leader and told reporters the allegations against him were lodged by a \u201cpartisan\u201d intelligence official.\n\nBut according to multiple news reports, Trump told his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky, that relations with the U.S. would improve only if Zelensky ordered an investigation into the Bidens.\n\nFriday\u2019s Wall Street Journal story reports that Trump urged Zelensky about eight times to work with Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal lawyer, to get to the bottom of questions surrounding whether Biden, when he was vice president in the Obama administration protected his son from a probe of his ties to a Ukrainian gas company \u2014 allegations that have never been substantiated.\n\nTrump on Friday did not deny that he discussed Biden with a foreign leader and told reporters the allegations against him were lodged by a \u201cpartisan\u201d intelligence official, despite acknowledging that he did not know the official\u2019s identity.\n\nTrump also asserted that his exchanges with fellow heads of government are \u201calways appropriate\u201d and that \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter what I discussed,\u201d before going on to say that \u201csomebody ought to look into Joe Biden\u2019s statement\u201d on Ukraine.\n\nGiuliani for months has been calling on Ukrainian investigators to examine the Bidens, and he also has been pressing for a probe into whether the country\u2019s officials played a more sinister role in the 2016 presidential election to undercut Trump.\n\n\u201cThat is an astounding scandal of major proportions which all of you have covered up for about five or six months,\u201d the former New York mayor said during a heated CNN interview on Thursday night during which he accused the media of avoiding the story.\n\nIn fact, news coverage on the issue has increased in recent months \u2014 not all of it positive for Biden, who is the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.\n\nThe New York Times has documented Giuliani\u2019s interest in getting a Biden investigation launched in Ukraine, and the president\u2019s lawyer went on Fox in May to announce he was canceling a trip to the country where he\u2019d planned to press its new leaders personally for the probe into Trump\u2019s potential 2020 opponent.\n\nBloomberg, meanwhile, quoted Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general that month saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing by the former vice president or his son.\n\nThree powerful Democrat-led House committee have since launched their own investigation into whether Trump and Giuliani have pressured Zelensky and the Ukrainian justice system \u201cin service\u201d of the president\u2019s reelection bid.\n\nBiden on Friday blasted the \u201cclear-cut corruption\u201d at play and called on Trump to immediately release the transcript of the call in question and allow the whistleblower notification to be sent to Congress.\n\n\u201cThis behavior is particularly abhorrent because it exploits the foreign policy of our country and undermines our national security for political purposes,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nThe whistleblower saga could have serious ramifications for the impeachment debate that has been raging for months inside the House Democratic Caucus.\n\nThe revelation that Ukraine was involved in the whistleblower\u2019s complaint has sparked all manner of reply from Trump allies. One new line of defense to emerge is that the issue is merely a policy dispute.\n\n\u201cFox & Friends\u201d host Brian Kilmeade, for example, argued on Thursday morning that the complaint boils down to, \u201cdo you like the president's policy on Ukraine,\u201d which he called better \u201cthan Barack Obama\u2019s policy ... where you just let the Russians steamroll the whole country and give them blankets to help them out.\u201d\n\nBut national security lawyers and whistleblower experts say that\u2019s not possible. Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the intelligence community, made a determination that the complaint constitutes an \u201curgent concern\u201d that falls squarely within his purview.\n\n\u201cThere is no way on earth this is just a mere policy dispute,\u201d said Bradley Moss, a national security lawyer who specializes in whistleblower cases. \u201cThe statute itself specifically and unequivocally excludes mere differences of opinion on public policy matters. So even if the whistleblower had just been disputing a policy, the inspector general would\u2019ve taken that, reviewed it, and not raised it to the level of urgent concern.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe IG has determined, though, that this concerns a real, serious abuse of the law relating to the operation of an intelligence activity,\u201d Moss said.\n\nIrvin McCullough, a national security analyst for the Government Accountability Project who focuses on intelligence community and military whistleblowing, agreed, noting that the inspector general has already determined \u201cthat this goes far beyond a policy disagreement.\u201d\n\nStill, McCullough acknowledged, the inspector general is now \u201cbetween a rock and a hard place.\u201d If he went straight to Congress with the substance of the complaint, he could be fired. \u201cBut he still needs to retain his independence,\u201d McCullough said. \u201cIt\u2019s a completely unprecedented situation.\u201d\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Trump\u2019s GOP allies are giving the president cover as House Democrats openly suggest that the withheld whistleblower complaint could be roped into their impeachment efforts.\n\n\u201cI just go back to what we\u2019ve had to endure at the Justice Department, what we\u2019ve had to endure at the FBI with these same sorts of attacks and, frankly, unprecedented resistance measures by bureaucrats to try and stop an elected president from carrying out the policies that the people voted for,\u201d Hawley said on Fox.\n\nRep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.) suggested in an interview Thursday on C-SPAN that the entire claim could be fake, pointing to recent reporting about sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh that Republicans have largely dismissed.\n\nAnd House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) for his part appeared unaware that the Trump administration was withholding the complaint from the congressional intelligence committees.\n\n\u201cWho is the whistleblower \u2014 is he still working? Because I don\u2019t know anything about him,\u201d he told reporters Friday. \u201cI\u2019ve heard rumors it\u2019s somebody who left. Why did he leave? And now this comes up.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy also said the whistleblower could have come to Congress to report his or her allegation.\n\nLawmakers who support impeaching the president have said the continued White House \u201cobstruction\u201d of Congress could be an impeachable offense on its own.\n\nBut that would come with its own serious consequences, including potential termination or loss of a security clearance. Whistleblower protection laws allow officials to go straight to the congressional intelligence committees, but once the director of National Intelligence steps in \u2014 as acting director Joseph Maguire did \u2014 that option is essentially nullified. Those laws are also meant to protect the whistleblower\u2019s or her identity and prevent reprisals.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, are considering going to court to obtain the whistleblower complaint. Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) suggested this week that lawmakers could also withhold funding from the intelligence community in order to put pressure on Maguire.\n\nThe whistleblower saga could have serious ramifications for the impeachment debate that has been raging for months inside the House Democratic Caucus. Democrats said the decision to keep Congress in the dark over the whistleblower\u2019s allegations is part of a pattern by the Trump administration to stonewall congressional oversight efforts.\n\nLawmakers who support impeaching the president have said the continued White House \u201cobstruction\u201d of Congress could be an impeachable offense on its own. Democrats, including Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), have noted several times this week that the third article of impeachment targeting President Richard Nixon centered on obstruction of Congress.\n\n\u201cIf the president does not allow the whistleblower complaint against him to be turned over to Congress, we will add it to the articles of impeachment,\u201d said Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.), a member of Democratic leadership who sits on the Judiciary Committee.\n\nNancy Pelosi issued a lengthy statement on the controversy Friday, but notably omitted any mention of impeachment.\n\nBut Democrats have also struggled to use former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation to build public support for impeachment, and the party\u2019s senior leaders \u2014 most notably, Speaker Nancy Pelosi \u2014 continue to resist it.\n\nSome Democrats argue the whistleblower saga could mark a turning point.\n\n\u201cWhen you have the president calling in from other countries and whistleblowers are talking about compromising who he has deemed a political enemy, this is serious,\u201d said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a liberal firebrand who has long supported impeachment. \u201cThis is very, very serious.\u201d\n\nPelosi issued a lengthy statement on the controversy Friday, but notably omitted any mention of impeachment.\n\n\u201cIf the president has done what has been alleged,\u201d the California Democrat said, \u201cthen he is stepping into a dangerous minefield with serious repercussions for his administration and our democracy.\u201d\n\nHeather Caygle and Quint Forgey contributed to this report.", "description": "It\u2019s a familiar response when controversy seems to imperil Trump\u2019s presidency.", "authors": ["Darren Samuelsohn", "Natasha Bertrand", "Andrew Desiderio", "Matthew Choi", "Daniel Lippman"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1169818614-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
