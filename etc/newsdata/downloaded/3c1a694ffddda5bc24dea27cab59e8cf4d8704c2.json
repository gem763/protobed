The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said they would fight to defend their \u201cown people,\u201d potentially relegating the battle against Islamic State.\n\nA number of Trump allies, including Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, said the move was \u201ca shot in the arm for the bad guys.\u201d Analysts said a U.S. pullback could ultimately play into the hands of Russia, whose military intervention helped turn the tide of the Syrian civil war in favor of President Bashar al-Assad.\n\nTrump\u2019s Confounding Syria Moves Again Spur Policy Confusion (1)\n\nSyria\u2019s Kurdish militant YPG group has been a U.S. partner in the fight against Islamic State in Syria and has tens of thousands of captured militants and their families in its custody in camps and detention centers in northeastern Syria. The U.S. has said Turkey would be responsible for those detainees but it was not clear whether there was a mechanism in place to ensure they would not escape and regroup.\n\nTurkey sees the YPG as a threat due to its link to the separatist PKK, another Kurdish group the Turkish government been battling for decades. It\u2019s considered a terrorist organization by the U.S. and the European Union.\n\nFahrettin Altun, Erdogan\u2019s chief of communications, had written on Twitter early Wednesday that Turkish troops, along with the Free Syrian Army, would cross the border shortly.\n\n\u201cYPG militants have two options: They can defect or we will have stop them from disrupting our counter-ISIS efforts,\u201d he wrote.\n\n(Recats with detail in paragraph 2, lira in paragraph 4, defense minister in paragraph 5.)", "description": "Turkish Troops Begin Crossing Into Syria After U.S. Stands Aside", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic1e863aa1aed03e1161fff39da757cfac.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
