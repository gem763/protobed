If that\u2019s your goal, it\u2019s becoming harder to reach.\n\nThe income needed to exit the bottom 99% of U.S. taxpayers hit $515,371 in 2017, according to Internal Revenue Service data released this week. That\u2019s up 7.2% from a year earlier, even after adjusting for inflation.\n\nSince 2011, when Occupy Wall Street protesters rallied under the slogan \u201cWe are the 99%,\u201d the income threshold for the top 1% is up an inflation-adjusted 33%. That outpaces all other groups except for those that are even wealthier.\n\nTo join the top 0.1%, you would have needed to earn $2.4 million in 2017, an increase of 38% since 2011. The top 0.01% threshold has jumped 46%.\n\nMeanwhile, the top 0.001% -- an elite group of 1,433 taxpayers -- earned at least $63.4 million each in 2017, up 51% since the Occupy protests.\n\nThe median taxpayer, at the 50th percentile, has seen income rise 20% since 2011.\n\nRising inequality is a top focus of the Democratic presidential campaign.\n\n\u201cWe cannot afford to continue this level of income and wealth inequality,\u201d Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders said during Tuesday\u2019s debate. \u201cWe cannot afford a billionaire class, whose greed and corruption has been at war with the working families of this country for 45 years.\u201d\n\nThough the rich in the U.S. are doing well, they also pay the greatest share of taxes. The top 1% earned 21% of the country\u2019s income, and paid 38.5% of federal individual income taxes. The top 1% paid a greater share of income tax to the U.S. Treasury than the bottom 90% combined (29.9%).\n\nWorking-class taxpayers do pay many other taxes, including federal payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare, and state and local levies. However, the bottom half of the income distribution pays very little toward the federal income tax.\n\nThe top 50% -- taxpayers with an adjusted gross income of $41,740 or more -- paid 97% of taxes, and earned 89% of income reported to the IRS.\n\nThe income tax brings in about half of all federal revenues, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nOverall, the IRS data show the U.S. collected $1.6 trillion in income taxes from 143.3 million taxpayers reporting a total of $10.9 trillion in adjusted gross income in 2017, the most recent year available.\n\nThe IRS data don\u2019t reflect the effects of the tax overhaul signed by President Donald Trump at the end of 2017. The law lowered individual income tax rates while eliminating many deductions and slashing the rate on U.S. corporations to 21% from 35%.\n\nIRS data through 2017 largely show that average tax rates paid have increased in recent years.\n\n(Updates with Bernie Sanders quote from Tuesday\u2019s debate in 8th paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Alex Tanzi in Washington at atanzi@bloomberg.net;Ben Steverman in New York at bsteverman@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Pierre Paulden at ppaulden@bloomberg.net, ;Alex Tanzi at atanzi@bloomberg.net, Steven Crabill, Peter Eichenbaum\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Explore what\u2019s moving the global economy in the new season of the Stephanomics podcast.
