That is thanks to our responsible fiscal management and the hard work of many New Zealanders,\" he said.\n\nThe surplus figure is $NZ4 billion above estimates, boosted by a one-off revision of the rail network, which accounts for $NZ2.6 billion of the bumper result.\n\nA record tax take has also bolstered government coffers.\n\nFrom the country's $NZ300 billion GDP, the Crown took core tax revenues of $NZ86.5 billion - 28.8 per cent of GDP, the highest figure in a decade.\n\nIn short, more Kiwis are in jobs, they're earning more, and they're giving more back - along with their bosses - to the government in tax.\n\nTreasury secretary Caralee McLiesh, reporting her first set of financial statements after taking the role last month, called it \"a strong result\".\n\n\"A large part of the increase in tax revenue from last year was the result of the growing economy,\" she said.\n\nCorporate profits, employment and wage growth were higher than expected in the budget, delivered by Robertson in May.\n\nThe surplus sets the government up for an election year cash splash, tax cut, or both.\n\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern's first-term government will tick over the two-year mark at the end of October, with an election expected in the second half of 2020.\n\nThe government has already foreshadowed some of this spend.\n\nA four-year capital expenditure package, targeted towards hospitals, school buildings and rail, will see a lower surplus next year.\n\nRobertson ruled out a cut to GST rates but was giving little away as to whether other taxes would be in his sights before election 2020.\n\n\"Calls for tax cuts are very normal,\" he said.\n\n\"Any decisions around tax are part of the budget process.\"\n\nThe financial results come at a time when the opposition National Party have focused its political attacks on plummeting business confidence levels.\n\nRobertson used the country's books as a rebuttal to those surveys.\n\n\"The results show businesses are investing, employing more workers and paying higher wages, while at the same time reporting stronger profits,\" he said.\n\n\"It's important that we don't talk ourselves into a downturn just because it suits some people's negative narrative.\n\n\"Unemployment, interest rates and government debt are all low, giving the economy a solid platform to keep growing and and face any global headwinds.\n\n\"We are growing faster than the likes of Australia, the UK, Canada and the EU.\"\n\nAT A GLANCE: NEW ZEALAND GOVERNMENT FINANCES\n\nBudget surplus: $7.5 billion\n\nNet debt - $57.7 billion (up $0.2 billion)\n\nNet debt share of GDP - 19.2 per cent (down from 19.9 per cent)\n\nCapital investment - $6.7 billion\n\nNet worth - $146.3 billion (up $10.7 billion)\n\nAssets - $365.7 billion\n\nLiabilities - $219.4 billion\n\nNet worth share of GDP - 48.8 per cent (up from 46.9 per cent)\n\nAT A GLANCE: NEW ZEALAND ECONOMY\n\nGDP: $300 billion\n\nReal GDP growth: 2.6 per cent\n\nPopulation growth: 1.6 per cent\n\nTotal full-time equivalent workers: 1.591 million (up 30,100)\n\nAverage hourly wage: $31.84 (up 3.5 per cent)\n\nAverage unemployment: 4.1 per cent (down 0.3 per cent)\n\nInflation: 1.7 per cent (up 0.2 per cent)\n\n* All figures from the Government's Financial Statements for the year ending June 2019, and in NZ dollars.\n\n** $NZ1 = $A0.93.", "description": "The New Zealand government has reported an economy and budget in rude health, posting its biggest surplus in 11 years.Finance Minister Grant Robertson was...", "authors": ["Australian Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
