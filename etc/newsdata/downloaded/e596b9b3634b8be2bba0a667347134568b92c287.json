In the background, a teacher is seen to secure a classroom door; students run for cover in a library while a shooting breaks out in the background.\n\nNew sneakers are suddenly perfect for running away from a gunman, a child explains. A new jacket \u2014 \u201ca real must have\u201d\u2014 becomes a tool for barricading a door from a shooter, another says. A third student uses the skateboard his parents got for him to break a window in his classroom he can flee through.\n\nThe list continues. Scissors are a tool for defense; new socks are used as tourniquets. Finally, a girl huddled in a bathroom, feet up on the toilet so no one can detect her, texts her mother, \u201cI love you,\u201d on a brand new cellphone and pink sequin phone cover.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

The video ends as the bathroom door opens and footsteps, presumably the gunman\u2019s, approach.\n\nDeveloped by Sandy Hook Promise, a group that formed in the aftermath of the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December 2012 that aims to protect children from gun violence, the video is the organization\u2019s new public-service-announcement. It was made as part of the group\u2019s \u201cKnow the Signs\u201d campaign, which urges people to recognize the warning signs and threats that can often precede school shootings and other acts of violence. The video premiered on the Today Show on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe PSA is purposefully grim, designed to spark conversations about prioritizing the prevention of violent acts in school and aims to promote a more hands-on approach to ending violence, said Mark Barden, a co-founder and managing director of Sandy Hook Promise whose son, Daniel, died in the 2012 shooting.\n\n\u201cIn our video, we show the awful, painful reality that children across the country face as school shootings become more frequent,\u201d Barden said in a statement. \u201cBut we also make it clear that it doesn\u2019t have to be this way: When we teach students to Know the Signs, and empower them to report warning signs to trusted adults, we can prevent school shootings and save lives.\u201d\n\nSandy Hook Promise has previously released other impactful PSAs. Last year, the group released a video that showed a shooting from the gunman\u2019s point of view.\n\nWrite to Mahita Gajanan at mahita.gajanan@time.com.", "description": "Sandy Hook Promise's latest PSA video shows students sharing their back-to-school items as a school shooting breaks out.", "authors": ["Mahita Gajanan"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/screen-shot-2019-09-18-at-11.55.40-am.png?w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
