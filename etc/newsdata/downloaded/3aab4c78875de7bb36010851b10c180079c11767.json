The quickly growing cannabis genetics and micropropagation company threw a party for its supporters, suppliers, investors and partners just outside the secure facility to mark the occasion.\n\nCelebrating the Grand Opening of apollogreen, the cannabis lab that will change the industry by supplying plantlets\n\nSays apollogreen CEO Tyler LeBlanc, \u201cThis project has been years in the making and now that the plantlets are in, it was time to thank everyone who propelled the company to this point in history. We are thrilled to launch, what we believe, will be a game changer in the cannabis industry globally.\u201d\n\nIn attendance at the celebration were also MP Francis Drouin and Mayor Pierre Leroux, long-time supporters of the project.\n\napollogreen is an industrial-scale, B2B genetics and micropropagation company that supplies premium quality (safe, lab-tested, and disease-free) cannabis and hemp starter plants to the global market. In July 2019, Health Canada granted apollogreen three licences for standard cultivation, standard processing and federal medical sales.\n\nSays Leroux, \u201cWe are pleased to welcome such an innovative company as apollogreen into our 417 Industrial Park. Our local businesses are such an important factor in why Russell Township has been named one of the best places to live in Canada, and we congratulate them on this wonderful day.\u201d\n\nThe traditional method of starting a cannabis production of a new genetic can take months from seed to harvest. Licensed producers can drastically reduce non-revenue-producing growing time by purchasing apollogreen\u2019s flower-ready starter plants. In only a few weeks, licensed producers can be harvesting high quality, highly differentiated cannabis and hemp products that are lab-tested and free of defects and contaminants.\n\napollogreen\u2019s 5,000 sq. ft. Phase 1 facility is at 400 Commerce Street, Vars and has begun the innovative cultivation of plantlets. A Phase 2 building will be started after the next round of investment is complete.\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nCertain statements contained in this news release constitute forward-looking statements or forward-looking information under applicable securities legislation.
