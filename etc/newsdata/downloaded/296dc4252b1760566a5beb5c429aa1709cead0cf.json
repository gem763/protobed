The match against No. 23-ranked Namibia will be his 141st cap, moving him level with Ireland\u2019s Brian O\u2019Driscoll in second place on the all-time list, seven behind former New Zealand captain Richie McCaw\u2019s record for most international appearances.\n\nBut there\u2019s a lingering statistic that he wants to improve. The Italians have never progressed out of the pool stage at the Rugby World Cup, and the prospects this time are daunting in a group containing defending champion New Zealand and South Africa - which have a combined five titles - Namibia and Canada.\n\nThe Italians have lost eight of their nine tests in 2019 - the only win coming against No. 20-ranked Russia - and are 1-2 in head-to-heads with Namibia, although the two losses were in 1991.\n\nParisse made his World Cup debut against New Zealand as far back as 2003, when he was still a teenager, and played four games at each of his first three World Cups. Injuries restricted him to just one start four years ago in England.\n\n\u201cThe fifth - I hope it will be my best,\u201d Parisse said on Friday. \u201cThe first World Cup was a huge match and I will never forget my first try against Canada in 2003. The 2007 edition in France left me the most disappointed, as we had a really good chance of qualifying for the quarterfinals but we lost to Scotland.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m nearer the end of my career than the start, I\u2019m aware of this, but I\u2019m not going to start thinking about it. It is something to be proud of, but my main aim is to think about helping the squad.\u201d\n\nItaly coach Conor O\u2019Shea said Parisse\u2019s influence on the squad was invaluable.\n\n\u201cHe is probably the best Italian rugby player of all time,\u201d O\u2019Shea said. \u201cHe never thinks about himself, only about the team.\n\n\u201cMaybe it is his last World Cup. I hope for him and the rest of the squad that it is his best.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Shea made nine changes to the starting lineup which lost 37-0 to England on Sept. 6, saying it was crucial to start with wins over Namibia and Canada before thinking about the All Blacks and Springboks.\n\n\u201cWe need to show our true level, our true ability and try our best to meet our ambitions,\u201d he said. \u201cThat starts against Namibia.\u201d\n\nNamibia is contesting its sixth World Cup and has a 0-19 record, making it the team with the most number of games without a win at the tournament.\n\nIn the injury-enforced absence of Johan Deysel, lock Tjiuee Uanivi will lead Namibia into its first test since June. Darryl De La Harpe was selected in the centers to make his 50th test appearance.\n\n\u201cIn the next four weeks we\u2019ll be judged on how well we\u2019ve done over the past four years,\u201d head coach Phil Davies said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a good position. We know we\u2019re fit enough. We have an adaptable way of playing and it\u2019s a great opportunity, a great challenge.\n\n___\n\nLineups:\n\nItaly: Jayden Hayward, Mattia Bellini, Tommaso Benvenuti, Luca Morisi, Edoardo Padovani, Tommaso Allan, Tito Tebaldi; Sergio Parisse (captain), Maxime Mbanda, Braam Steyn, Federico Ruzza, Alessandro Zanni, Tiziano Pasquali, Luca Bigi, Nicola Quaglio.
