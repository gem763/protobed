These are managed with drugs or surgery.\n\nEven during periods when the disease is in remission, and medication is controlling gut inflammation, symptoms can persist in every day life.\n\nThe King's College London study offers fresh hope of a safe and cost-effective way of relieving the symptoms suffered by thousands.\n\nA diet low in carbohydrates could relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in just a month, a study by King's College London has found for the first time\n\nLead researcher Dr Selina Cox said: 'We know that the low FODMAP diet is effective in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\n\n'This is the first randomised, trial showing that it's effective in reducing common gut symptoms.\n\n'This improves health-related quality of life in patients with IBD when they are in remission.'\n\nInflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, involve chronic inflammation of the digestive tract.\n\nFifty-two patients were used in the study. They all had persistent symptoms of IBD - despite their inflammation being under control with medication.\n\nWHAT IS INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE? Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a medical term that describes a group of conditions in which the intestines become inflamed (red and swollen). Two major types of IBD are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Ulcerative colitis affects the large intestine (colon) whereas Crohn's disease can occur in any part of the intestines. Symptoms may include: Abdominal cramps and pain frequent\n\nWatery diarrhoea (may be bloody)\n\nSevere urgency to have a bowel movement\n\nFever during active stages of disease\n\nLoss of appetite and weight loss\n\nTiredness and fatigue anaemia (due to blood loss) People of any age can get IBD, but it's usually diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 40. The conditions are chronic and cannot be cured so treatment usually relies on medication and lifestyle changes to manage the symptoms, but may include surgery. IBD is thought to affect some three million people in the US, over 300,000 Britons, and 85,000 Australians.
