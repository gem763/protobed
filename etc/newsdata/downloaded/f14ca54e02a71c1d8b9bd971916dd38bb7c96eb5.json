(AP) - Von Miller expects more from the Broncos\u2019 defense.\n\nFollowing a last-second Week 2 loss to the Bears, the three-time All-Pro edge rusher said it was time to \u201cget back in the lab and keep practicing.\u201d\n\nThrough two games, Denver (0-2) hasn\u2019t forced a turnover or recorded a sack, both uncharacteristic of a Miller-led defense. But first-year coach Vic Fangio isn\u2019t worried.\n\n\u201cNot at this point, OK,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing I will say is I was disappointed in our rush in the last drive (on Sunday), but prior to that in these first two games they\u2019ve been unusual games as it related to pass rush.\u201d\n\nMiller, fellow pass-rusher Bradley Chubb and the rest of the Broncos will look to get a victory this Sunday against the Packers at Lambeau Field, a place where Denver has never won (0-5-1).\n\nAaron Rodgers, who for the third straight week will be staring down yet another prolific tandem of pass rushers, knows it\u2019s only a matter of time before the Broncos\u2019 defense starts piling up the sacks, especially with Fangio at the helm.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a fantastic coach,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI\u2019m happy for him to get the opportunity after so many years being a great assistant in the league. I haven\u2019t spent a lot of time with him, but I have a ton of respect for the way he\u2019s gone about his business over his career.\u201d\n\nFangio faced Rodgers-led offenses seven times as Bears defensive coordinator from 2015-18. Fangio went 2-5 in those matchups, including a 1-4 mark in games played in Green Bay.\n\nFangio was in charge when the Bears forced Rodgers out of the game and into the locker room in the second quarter of the season opener last season, only to watch the two-time MVP throw three touchdowns and help the Packers overcame a 20-point deficit.\n\nPackers left tackle David Bakhtiari primarily will be dealt the task of slowing down Chubb, who had 12 sacks last year as a rookie. Right tackle Bryan Bulaga will be on Von Miller watch. Miller is two sacks away from 100 for his career. He would be the 34th player in NFL history to reach the century mark.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re very, very good players,\u201d Bulaga said. \u201cSo regardless of what their numbers say, that\u2019s not what bothers me. It\u2019s watching tape of those guys win consistently, especially for Von, being able to do it for, what, nine years now? I mean, he\u2019s been doing it for a long time. He didn\u2019t forget how to rush the passer. I can promise you that.\u201d\n\nDIFFERENT DEFENSE\n\nThe Broncos held Rodgers to 77 yards passing the previous time the teams met. But that was way back in 2015 when Denver\u2019s defense was leading the franchise to its third Super Bowl title and sending Peyton Manning into retirement as a champion. Only three defenders who started against the Packers that game are still starting: OLB Von Miller, DE Derek Wolfe and CB Chris Harris Jr. (the only returning offensive starter is WR Emmanuel Sanders).\n\nANOTHER AARON\n\nRB Aaron Jones had 116 yards and a touchdown on career-high 23 carries in the Packers\u2019 win last week against the Vikings. Jones figures to be a large part of coach Matt LaFleur\u2019s offensive plans going forward as he continues to seek a balanced offense.\n\n\u201cWhen I first saw him when he came up with them, I looked out and said, \u2018Where\u2019d they get this guy?\u2019 Fangio said of Jones. \u201cAnd I think he was a sixth-round pick, and I\u2019m saying, \u2018Jeez.\u2019 He\u2019s powerful. He\u2019s got really good balance. He runs tough. He\u2019s a capable pass receiver out of the backfield. They do everything with him. They got a steal there.\u201d\n\nREINFORCEMENTS ARRIVE\n\nThe Broncos haven\u2019t had their full defense together so far with ILB Todd Davis (calf) and CB Bryce Callahan (foot) missing the first two games. Callahan was limited in practice and odds are he won\u2019t be back for the Packers. But Davis, the team\u2019s leading tackler last season, finally looks ready to return to the lineup. He\u2019s been out since tearing his left calf on the first day of training camp in July.\n\nALL EYES ON JIMMY\n\nTE Jimmy Graham has been unable to practice this week for Green Bay because of a groin injury, which could affect his status for Sunday. Meanwhile, the Packers signed TE Evan Baylis to the 53-man roster.\n\nHOLDING HABIT\n\nThe Broncos are bedeviled over left tackle Garett Bolles\u2019 holding habit, which has somehow gotten worse under the tutelage of Hall of Famer Mike Munchak.\n\nAfter getting flagged four times against Chicago in Week 2 - the most by any NFL player in the past five seasons - Bolles disputed some of the penalties and suggested he was the victim of an undeserved reputation. That promoted backlash from coaches, teammates and even GM John Elway, who asked, \u201cDoes he know what holding is?\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Keith Jenkins on Twitter: https://twitter.com/MrKeithJenkins\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Von Miller expects more from the Broncos' defense.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Keith Jenkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/16/aptopix_bears_broncos_football_85122_c0-106-2521-1575_s1770x1032.jpg?98e9b69567d1a72ca4f529de389c6f551772dc31", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
