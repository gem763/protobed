I did manage to find, for example, the microbrewery dungeon that\u2019s completely optional. But I completely missed this fully-functioning roller coaster that you can ride, despite the dozens of hours I\u2019ve spent playing the game. As of this morning, I have now ridden this roller coaster. You should too.\n\nI was alerted to its presence by a post on the Borderlands 3 subreddit from a user who sounded just as incensed that they had not previously known about it. \u201cWhy was I not made aware of such a cool thing?\u201d user __JinxY__ asked the universe, posting a video of a character riding a roller coaster in game and shooting targets along the tracks.\n\nImmediately recognising that roller coasters are awesome regardless of context, I immediately yelled the same thing at my computer. Then I booted up my Borderlands 3 save to find it for myself.\n\nThe coaster isn\u2019t even that well-hidden. It\u2019s just off the beaten path in the Splinterlands, a region of Pandora you visit late in the game while on a quest to rescue another character.\n\nSince you come to the Splinterlands in the middle of a quest chain that has you doing lots of driving around, it\u2019s tempting to just make a beeline for the main quest goal \u2014 which is a chop shop across the map \u2014 and ignore everything else. Also, Pandora is a desert, so there\u2019s not much to catch the eye while you\u2019re on the road.\n\nCompletists (and Burning Man attendees, I suppose) know, however, that the desert is precisely where one would go to find interesting things. You can find it either by chance or if you make a habit of finding every Typhon Log hidden on each map. If you do that, you\u2019ll eventually find yourself at the foot of a stairwell near the centre of the Splinterlands. That stairwell leads up to, well, a damn roller coaster. With really no other context.\n\nBecause this is Borderlands, there are some dudes to shoot first, but get past them and you are free to board the roller coaster, fire at the lever that starts it, and have fun trying to hit the targets on the track. Hit them all and you\u2019ll unlock a room with some sweet loot.\n\nI love that this seems to be here for no reason other than that it\u2019s cool. I didn\u2019t find a side quest nearby, wasn\u2019t sent here on a main story quest, and was otherwise ignorant of its existence for nearly a full month after this game\u2019s release despite, again, having played this game for many hours. You can\u2019t even call it an easter egg, because it\u2019s not like it\u2019s that hidden.\n\nAll you have to do is veer a little bit off the direct path during the story quest and you\u2019ll crash into it. But maybe you, like me, did not see this until someone did the kindness of showing it to you. If I can spare you the anguish of missing out on a roller coaster where you thought there was none, it\u2019ll all be worth it.", "description": "It\u2019s so easy to miss things that are hiding right under your nose, especially in a video game as big as Borderlands 3.
