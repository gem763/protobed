The prayers of the nation are with the friends and families of the victims and the entire Midland and Odessa communities, and our deepest gratitude goes out to the first responders, who are bringing help and healing during this tragic time. \u201cEnough is enough. Every day, the epidemic of gun violence inflicts a devastating toll in communities in every corner of our country, forcing far too many to endure heartbreak and tragedy. The Republican Senate must end its obstruction and finally pass the commonsense, bipartisan, House-passed gun violence prevention legislation that the country is demanding. \u201cTonight and in the days to come, all Americans stand with the Midland and Odessa communities. May it be a comfort to those grieving the loss of their loved ones that so many mourn with and pray for them at this difficult time.\u201d\n\nSchumer took to Twitter to call on McConnell to bring forth H.R. 9, the universal background check bill Democrats passed in the House.\n\nOur thoughts are with the victims, their families, & everyone injured in the shooting in Odessa & Midland, TX.\n\n\n\nThank you to the first responders who risked their lives to stop the threat.@senatemajldr should bring up H.R. 8 the week Congress returns. We must #endgunviolence. \u2014 Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) September 1, 2019\n\nIt's always amazing to watch anti-gunners call for gun control legislation before we know anything about the gunman. We don't know his identity, other than him being a white man in his 30s. We don't know what kind of firearm he used, other than it was a \"rifle.\" We don't know how he obtained his firearm. We. Know. Nothing. And yet these people make assumptions about how some gun control law could have prevented the tragedy.", "description": "Here we go..09/02/2019 3:18:53AM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/17/a8f425b6-099a-460f-b254-d899bd8089dc.png"}
