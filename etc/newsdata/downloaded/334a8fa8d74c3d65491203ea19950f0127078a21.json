It\u2019s unacceptable \u2015 100%,\u201d Morgan said.\n\nWatson said of the incident that he initially denied the officer\u2019s claims that he wrote \u201cpropaganda,\u201d then answered affirmatively \u201cfor the purposes of expediting this conversation\u201d before he was handed back his passport.\n\nWatson has filed a civil rights complaint as a result, though he has yet to receive an update on the matter.\n\nHe told HuffPost that Morgan\u2019s latest statement is a step in the right direction.\n\n\u201cWe are encouraged by the acting commissioner\u2019s remarks today, and the overall positive and pragmatic responses this incident has generated,\u201d Watson said Tuesday over email.\n\nOn Saturday, a CBP spokesperson told HuffPost the agency is aware of the \u201calleged inappropriate conduct at Washington Dulles International airport and we are investigating the allegation.\u201d\n\nSeveral similar cases of alleged harassment have been reported throughout the past year. British journalist James Dyer tweeted in August that he was derided as a member of the \u201cfake news media\u201d by a CBP agent at Los Angeles International Airport.\n\nIn February, CBP issued an apology to BuzzFeed News reporter David Mack for an agent\u2019s \u201cinappropriate remarks\u201d made at New York City\u2019s JFK Airport. According to the outlet, Mack was targeted with an aggressive line of questioning over his coverage of President Donald Trump.", "description": "The condemnation comes just days after a passport screening official allegedly asked a reporter four times if he writes \"propaganda.\"", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9cba4a200000d5054f80f1.jpeg?cache=gwvurqp3m3&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
