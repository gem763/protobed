Josh Hawley (R-MO) is calling on the United States Senate to investigate China\u2019s influence on American education.\n\nAccording to a local news report, Sen. Josh Hawley is continuing his call for a federal investigation into China\u2019s influence on American college campuses. Hawley\u2019s concerns center on an education group called the \u201cConfucius Institute,\u201d a Chinese-government agency that has built partnerships with American colleges and universities.\n\nThe Confucius Institute is steeped in controversy. Critics have accused the organization, and by extension, the Chinese government, of seeking control over messaging at American universities. June Tuefel Dreyer, a professor at the University of Miami, claimed that the Confucius Institute told them that they are not allowed to discuss the Dalai Lama, Tibet, Taiwan, China\u2019s military.\n\nMartin Davidson, chief executive of the British Council, told the New York Times in 2012 that the Confucius Institute bribes colleges with funding in exchange for control over the campus\u2019 discourse on China.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese are very clear on what they are trying to achieve,\u201d Davidson said at the time. \u201cThey want to change the perception of China \u2014 to combat negative propaganda with positive propaganda. And they use the word \u2018propaganda\u2019 in Chinese. But I doubt they have to say, \u2018We\u2019ll only give you this money if you never criticize China.\u2019 The danger is more of self-censorship \u2014 which is a very subtle thing,\u201d\n\nIn a letter to leaders at the University of Missouri and Webster University, Sen. Hawley argued that it is inappropriate for do business with an organization would ask them to censor speech.\n\nBut Confucius Institutes are more than a means of cultural exchange. As Li Changchun, a senior member of the Chinese Communist Party, stated in 2009, the Confucius Institutes are \u2018an important part of China\u2019s overseas propaganda set-up.\u2019 Hanban is governed by the leaders of twelve Chinese ministries, including those handling foreign affairs, state media, and propaganda. Partnering universities sign contracts that prohibit them from \u2018tarnishing the reputation\u2019 of Hanban, and Hanban sends teachers and textbooks from China that are designed to promote a positive image of the PRC and suppress any discussion of the \u2018three Ts\u2019: Tibet, Taiwan, and Tiananmen Square. These Confucius Institutes are, in short, a tool for China to spread influence and exercise soft power in its rivalry with the United States.\n\nStay tuned to Breitbart News for more updates on this story.", "description": "Sen.
