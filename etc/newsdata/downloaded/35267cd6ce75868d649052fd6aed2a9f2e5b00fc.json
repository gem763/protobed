Get there. Can you get there?\u2019 I saw the first baseman come off the bag,\u201d Wong said. \u201cThen I was like, \u2018Go! Go!\u2019\u201d\n\nAustin Meadows tied the game with a two-run homer in the eighth before the Rays (87-59) were helped by the two errors on the same play in the 11th of a 5-3 win Tuesday night. They have won six in a row, and 11 of 12, to stay 1\u00bd games ahead of Oakland for the top AL wild-card spot after the A\u2019s won 21-7 at AL West-leading Houston.\n\nAfter the errant throw by Clase (2-3), second baseman Rougned Odor picked the ball up and threw it high into left field as a runner was diving back into second base. Nate Lowe scored the tiebreaking run from third, and Guillermo Heredia followed with an RBI single.\n\n\u201cThat was kind of a funky play,\u201d Rays manager Kevin Cash said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got guys one through nine that hustle down the baseline, make the pressure plays, put pressure on the defense,\u201d Lowe said.\n\nJoey Wendle led off the Rays eighth with a triple off just-entered reliever Rafael Montero, and Meadows followed with his 29th homer to tie the game at 3-3.\n\nWendle\u2019s RBI single in the fifth was the only run Tampa Bay got in seven innings off Rangers starter Lance Lynn.\n\nThe Rangers, coming off a four-game sweep at Baltimore, had runners at second and third in the ninth after a double steal before Isiah Kiner-Falefa\u2019s inning-ending fly out.\n\n\u201cWe did nothing at the end of the game to win the game, and that\u2019s what\u2019s frustrating to me,\u201d Rangers manager Chris Woodward said. \u201cJust little things that we obviously didn\u2019t execute, at the plate, in the field.\u201d\n\nEmilio Pagan (4-2) struck out two in a perfect 10th before Peter Fairbanks worked the 11th for his first career save.\n\nFairbanks was traded from Texas to Tampa Bay on July 13 for rookie infielder Nick Solak, who hit a two-run homer in the fourth for the Rangers and had a two-out infield single off the pitcher he was traded for in the 11th.\n\nThe Rangers didn\u2019t have a base runner against lefty starter Ryan Yarbrough until Shin-Soo Choo was hit by a pitch leading off the fourth. Choo came home an out later when Willie Calhoun lined a double into the left field corner, and Solak followed with his third homer in his 20 games since his big league debut Aug. 20.\n\nThose were the only three runs allowed by Yarbrough, who struck out seven and walked one in seven innings. The lefty hasn\u2019t lost in his last 15 appearance (seven starts) since early June.\n\nSHORT HOPS\n\nLynn departed with a 3-1 lead and in position for his first win in his last seven starts. He is 0-4 since a win at home Aug. 2 against Detroit for his 14th victory that at the time matched the major league lead. \u2026 Rangers batters struck out 13 times, giving them 1,439 for the season and passing Detroit\u2019s 1,437 for the most in the majors.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nRays: CF Kevin Kiermaier thought he would be back in the lineup, but Cash held him out after he left the previous game Sunday with a stiff neck. An MRI showed no issues. \u2026 LF Tommy Pham was also out with a forearm/elbow issue. He could return Wednesday, maybe as the DH. \u2026 LHP Blake Snell, out since July 22 because of surgery to remove bone chips from his elbow, is scheduled to go two innings or 30 pitches for Triple-A Durham in Game 3 of the International League championship series Thursday. His first rehab start was Saturday in the semifinal series clincher for the Bulls.\n\nRangers: All-Star slugger Joey Gallo, who last played July 22 before right wrist surgery, took some swings against live pitching. Woodward said Gallo looked fine and felt decent. The hope is that Gallo can play a few games before the end of the season. \u201cHe\u2019s had such a good year and he\u2019s made so many strides forward, I\u2019d like to send him off with something positive he did on the field, not out of the training room,\u201d Woodward said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nThe Rays will start the middle game of the three-game series with right-handed reliever Andrew Kittredge on the mound. The Rangers opted against using an opener and will let Ariel Jurado start even though he has allowed 27 runs (21 earned) his last 23 2/3 innings.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kean Wong was churning hard to get to first base and keep the Tampa Bay Rays going in the 11th inning when his two-out slow roller was being bobbled by the pitcher.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Stephen Hawkins"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/11/rays_rangers_baseball_93404_c0-129-2420-1539_s1770x1032.jpg?652aae0525770950050a741c9d573e4a99fd2494", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
