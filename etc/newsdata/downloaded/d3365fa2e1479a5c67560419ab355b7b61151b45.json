REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo\n\nThe Fed \u201cwill act as appropriate to sustain a low unemployment rate and solid growth and stable inflation,\u201d Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida said in New York, repeating a phrase Fed Chair Jerome Powell has used ahead of meetings when the Fed did cut rates, as well as in June, when it didn\u2019t.\n\nThe U.S. consumer and economy are in a \u201cgood place,\u201d and the U.S. labor market is \u201cvery healthy,\u201d Clarida said. At the same time, risks include slowing global growth, uncertainty over trade, and persistent low inflation overseas, all of which impact the U.S. economy.\n\n\u201cWe have eight meetings a year, we take them one at a time. We are not on a preset course,\u201d he said.\n\nClarida\u2019s circumspect comments came at the end of a day where traders bid up expectations of two more Fed rate cuts this year after the Institute for Supply Management (ISM)\u2019s non-manufacturing activity index dropped to its lowest reading since August 2016.\n\nSeparate data earlier in the week showed an index of U.S. factory activity contracting to its lowest level in more than a decade.\n\nThe reports may signal that a slide in exports, business sentiment and business investment is spreading to the consumer, whose spending accounts for the bulk of the $20 trillion U.S. economy.\n\n\u201cIf we wait for weakness in global growth and manufacturing and business investment to seep into other parts of the economy... I think we likely have waited too long,\u201d Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan told a group in a Houston suburb after that report.\n\nRelated Coverage Fed's Clarida says central bank will set policy meeting by meeting\n\nThe Fed\u2019s two rate cuts so far this year have reduced the likelihood of a severe downturn, Kaplan said, but have not eliminated it, adding that he has an \u201copen mind\u201d as regards to rate-setting and is watching \u201cextremely carefully\u201d for evidence of broader economic weakness.\n\n\u201cWe will go to our next meeting, have a discussion about what\u2019s appropriate, and I\u2019m extremely open-minded to making an adjustment if that\u2019s what the appropriate policy is,\u201d Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans said in Madrid, before the services report.\n\nThe Fed has cut rates twice this year as U.S. businesses were hit by rising trade tensions with China, political risk including Britain\u2019s potentially chaotic divorce from the European Union, and weakening economic growth in Germany and elsewhere.\n\nBut not all 17 Fed policymakers backed the cuts; in September, several wanted rates to stay where they were, and one wanted a deeper rate cut.\n\nU.S. household spending and jobs growth have so far remained strong, momentum that U.S. central bankers have attributed at least in part to the Fed\u2019s pivot from a tightening stance as recently as 10 months ago. At the same time, inflation has lingered below the Fed\u2019s 2% goal.\n\nFed policymakers have said they are on the lookout for any signs that the hit from trade uncertainty and a weakening global economy is no longer confined to the U.S. export and manufacturing sectors.\n\nRate futures traders now see an 88% chance of a quarter-of-percentage-point rate cut at the Fed\u2019s October 29-30 meeting, and a better-than-even chance of a fourth rate cut by year\u2019s end that would bring the central bank\u2019s target range to 1.25% to 1.5% and completely reverse all of last year\u2019s tightening.\n\nU.S. stocks also rose Thursday on expectations of further Fed rate cuts.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans visits the online music retailer Sweetwater, in Fort Wayne, Indiana, U.S. September 14 2018. REUTERS/Ann Saphir/File Photo\n\nA U.S. government report on September jobs growth, out early Friday, could be pivotal as Fed policymakers weigh whether trade uncertainties are reaching deeper into the U.S. economy.\n\nCleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, who was against the decision to cut rates in July, on Thursday pushed back against the idea that the labor market could strengthen much further than it is now. Unemployment in August registered at 3.7%, well below most economists\u2019 view of a sustainable level without pushing up on inflation.", "description": "Two Fed policymakers on Thursday signaled they are open to delivering another rate cut after a report showed the growth in the vast U.S. services sector is slowing, but the Fed's No. 2, speaking late in the day, gave little away on his own thinking.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hiller", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436845414&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF921RY"}
