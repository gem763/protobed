In which case we are left to choose between its darker rivals, between a comfortable decadence in which virtue erodes and the reaper beckons, or else some variant on Efrafa\u2019s totalitarian alternative.\n\nWhich option you choose depends on which destination you fear most. One anxiety in the Western world right now, palpable on both the right and the left, is that the plush, end-of-rabbit-history warren is liberalism\u2019s dystopian destination: a sleek and fattened inhumanity, a terrible mix of comfort and cruelty, a loss of basic human goods under the pressure of capitalism or secularism or both.\n\nThe other anxiety, dominant in the embattled liberal center, is that the people who want more than what modernity is currently delivering \u2014 whether they\u2019re socialists or populists or integralists or something else entirely \u2014 are in various ways really just interested in building up Efrafa: either a literal police state with strongmen and zealously guarded borders and tight control of reproduction, a Gilead or Fortress Europe, or else a police state of the imagination, with ideological commissars ever on patrol.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ross Douthat", "Nytimes.Com Opinion Watership-Down-Liberalism.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
