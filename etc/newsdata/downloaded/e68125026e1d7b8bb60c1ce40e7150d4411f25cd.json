Turkey denies the allegations.\n\nTurkey's Western allies - which saw Kurdish forces as an effective tool in the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (the ISIL group or ISIS) - condemned its offensive.\n\nTurkish presidential aide Ibrahim Kalin hit out at the magazine on Twitter on Thursday, saying, \"It is clear why they [the French] attack our president. They are in panic as their game was spoiled and their pawn in Syria, PKK, suffered a heavy blow.\"\n\nHe said France's colonial history had led to the slaughter of thousands of people, and noted the country's past involvement in the slave trade.\n\n\"They [France] are trying every way to protect their puppets but to no avail,\" he said, referring to the YPG. \"Kurds are not your contractors and they will not be. Your colonising days are over.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has been one of the leading Western critics of Turkey's operation in Syria, describing it as \"crazy\". He has also expressed frustration at NATO's inability to check Turkey, an alliance member.\n\nLe Point's Gernelle said Erdogan's reaction to the article proved a point the magazine had made in a May 2018 cover story about the Turkish president.\n\n\"He's accusing us of the crime of lese-majeste, which confirms our earlier cover that called him a dictator. We're free to write what we want. Evidently he has a problem with freedom\".\n\nLe Point said it had suffered harassment and intimidation by Erdogan's supporters after labeling him \"The Dictator\" on a 2018 cover, and Macron was rebuked by Turkey's foreign minister for rallying behind the magazine.\n\nTurkey says the YPG does not represent the Kurds and that its operation in Syria only targets fighters. Kurds make up about 18 percent of Turkey's own population of 82 million.\n\nErdogan has also accused the YPG of conducting its own ethnic cleansing against Arabs living in the border area.\n\nThe Turkish president, who often files lawsuits against those critical of him or his policies, said on Thursday it was better for Arabs to live in the area, pointing at a map of northeastern Syria.\n\n\"These are not suitable for the lifestyle of Kurds ... because they are virtually desert regions,\" he said in an interview with state broadcaster TRT.", "description": "Le Point accuses the Turkish president of ethnic cleansing in northeastern Syria.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/16/870c23a5ce9046ebb734a06d4ad827e5_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
