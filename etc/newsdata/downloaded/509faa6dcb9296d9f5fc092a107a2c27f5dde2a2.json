The city said there were reports of gas leaks north of Walnut Hill. Most of the damage within Dallas was limited to the northwest, with Evans defining the area as bordered by Royal Lane to the north and Northwest Highway to the south, as well as Harry Hines Boulevard to the west and Interstate 75 to the east.\n\nNearly 140,000 electric customers were without power as of 4 a.m., according to Oncor\u2019s online outage map. The electric utility said storms across East Texas had caused significant damage to power lines.\n\n\u201cCurrently there is not an estimated time of restoration, however we are working to restore power as quickly and safely as possible,\u201d Oncor said in a statement on its website.\n\nAround 65,000 of the affected electric customers were within Dallas, according to the city, which said it would open a shelter by 2 a.m.\n\nSearch teams conducted primary assessments on accessible structures for six hours overnight, but were hampered by \u201climited access and lack of proper lighting,\u201d Evans said. A second set of teams were to resume search efforts in daylight.\n\nSeven people escaped a structure that collapsed in northwest Dallas, but Dallas Fire-Rescue were searching to see if anyone was left inside, Evans said. WFAA-TV reported that a convenience store collapsed in the storm, but the clerk told the station that everyone who was inside made it out safely.\n\nEvans said the department had also received multiple calls from people injured in their homes by broken glass.\n\nOn Twitter, Dallas Fire-Rescue said one of its own stations sustained significant damage during the storms overnight, and included photos that appeared to show a collapsed roof and debris. Evans said in another release that none of the firefighters at Station 41 were hurt, but the station was left \u201cuninhabitable after the roof, and other parts of the structure, was mostly removed by the high winds.\u201d\n\nA radio station, KNON-FM, went off the air as the studio suffered major damage from the tornado. Lew Morris, one of the hosts of \u201cReckless Rock Radio\u201d was preparing for the show at the station while another show was broadcasting. He told The Associated Press in a Facebook message that the power at the station went out first, followed by the \u201cdistinctive whistle\u201d of a tornado within three minutes.\n\nHe said there were three staffers in the building, which he described as having a lot of large glass windows. He told the host of the show that had been broadcasting to follow him to the bathroom, to get away from all the glass.\n\n\u201cWe then heard the building shaking and could hear the glass windows shattering everywhere along with debris banging around. We waited until all the noise died down,\u201d Morris told the AP. \u201cWe walked out to see the studio he was just broadcasting from destroyed.\u201d\n\nMorris - whose own car was covered by a tree - said the third staff member took shelter in a stairwell. It\u2019s unclear when the station will begin broadcasting again, but Morris says he\u2019s heard there might be a temporary set-up from which they can broadcast.\n\nGodwin, the meteorologist, said the size and severity of the tornado won\u2019t be known until crews arrive to survey the damage. NWS warning coordination meteorologist Jennifer Dunn told the AP there may have been two or more tornadoes in north Texas, but reiterated that the extent wouldn\u2019t be known until later Monday afternoon, after survey teams assess the damage.\n\nThe storm happened as multiple severe thunderstorm watches and warnings covered portions of four counties, including Dallas County, and more stormy weather was expected in the area during the overnight hours.\n\nNorth of Dallas, the city of Richardson said in a release that thoroughfares \u201cused by thousands of morning commuters\u201d will be closed while workers clear debris and repair downed traffic lights. No injuries in the affluent suburb were reported, but more than 7,000 Oncor customers within Richardson lost power, including some school campuses. Richardson is home to the University of Texas at Dallas and bills itself as \u201cthe second largest employment center in the Dallas/Ft. Worth metro area.\u201d\n\nThe city of Sachse, a northeast suburb of Dallas, said in a release that six houses \u201csustained significant high-wind damage after severe weather moved through the area Sunday night.\u201d Four homes were left uninhabitable, but no injuries had been reported.\n\nCiting extensive damage to campuses, the Dallas Independent School District canceled Monday classes at six schools: David G. Burnet Elementary School, Leonides Gonzalez Cigarroa Elementary School, John J. Pershing Elementary School, Walnut Hill Elementary School, Edward H. Cary Middle School and Thomas Jefferson High School. The district also advised students that bus routes from those campuses to magnet and choice schools would not run Monday. The Episcopal School of Dallas also canceled classes and asked people to avoid campus \u201cuntil further notice while damage is assessed and crews work to clean up.\u201d The schools are all in northwest Dallas.\n\nDallas police said officers in one part of the city were going door-to-door to check on residents.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Mallika Sen contributed from New York.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The National Weather Service confirmed a tornado touched down in Dallas on Sunday night, causing structural damage and knocking out electricity to thousands.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/21/us_severe_weather_11673_c123-0-2877-1607_s1200x700.jpg?9f5106f14b50df59afcf250a317d44907ab0e118", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
