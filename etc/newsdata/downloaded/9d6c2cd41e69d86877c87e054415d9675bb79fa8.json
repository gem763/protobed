Al Iaquinta at UFC 243: Best photos view 22 images\n\nDan Hooker continued to thrive as a lightweight on Saturday when he earned his biggest win in the division against Al Iaquinta at UFC 243.\n\nHooker (19-8 MMA, 9-4 UFC) improved to 6-1 when competing at 155 pounds after picking apart Iaquinta (14-6-1 MMA, 9-5 UFC) over the course of three rounds to take a unanimous decision and help him move further up the pecking order in what\u2019s arguably the sport\u2019s most stacked division.\n\nThe lightweight bout was the UFC 243 co-main event at Marvel Stadium in Melbourne, Australia. It aired on pay-per-view following prelims on ESPN2 and UFC Fight Pass/ESPN+.\n\nBoth fighters started cautiously, trading leg kicks and trying to work their way in for hard punches. Hooker\u2019s low kicks appeared to work to great effect early, but Iaquinta had some answers with his hands while also going for takedown attempts. Iaquinta got in on a good takedown, but Hooker stopped it and punched him with elbows before taking control on the ground and doing some good work. Iaquinta ultimately got up, but Hooker continued to be productive through the end of the round.\n\nWith the low calf kicks a significant weapon in the first, Hooker went right back to it to begin the second round. The damage was clearly irritating to Iaquinta, who was forced to repeatedly change stances. He did his best to fire back and got deep in on another takedown with around 90 seconds remaining, but Hooker showed tremendous defensive ability in keeping his opponent off. He followed with a massive shot that dropped Iaquinta, however, Hooker could not finish before the round expired.\n\nIaquinta\u2019s corner honestly told him he was down two rounds going into the third, but it was Hooker who came out strong to begin the final frame. He went back to his low kick attacks and kept Iaquinta at bay with a nice jab, too. With his nose bloodied, Iaquinta tried to make a final charge in the final minutes of he fight. He simply couldn\u2019t penetrate Hooker\u2019s guard, though, and walked into more damage. Forever tough, Iaquinta wouldn\u2019t be finish, but when 15 minutes expired, it was clear Hooker had won.\n\nThe judges agreed, giving Hooker 30-27, 30-27 and 30-26 scores. It was Hooker\u2019s sixth win in his past seven fights, while Iaquinta has dropped three of his past four.\n\nAfter the win, Hooker called out former interim lightweight champ Dustin Poirier.\n\n\u201cDustin Poirier, I\u2019m going to smash your face in,\u201d Hooker said in his post-fight interview with Jon Anik. \u201cMeet me in New Zealand 2020, and I will end you.\u201d\n\nI'm fighting the Irishman next. You're close but not yet buddy keep punching @danthehangman \u2014 The Diamond (@DustinPoirier) October 6, 2019\n\nDan can fight Cowboy\u2026 I'm chilling out until something really excites me.
