REUTERS/Denis Balibouse\n\nThe first meeting of Syria\u2019s so-called Constitutional Committee, composed of government and opposition members as well as civil society, is a step forward in what the United Nations says will be a long road to political rapprochement.\n\nExperts question whether the government of President Bashar al-Assad would be willing to give away much at the negotiating table after consolidating its military control on the ground.\n\nIn opening remarks at an opening ceremony, Ahmad Kuzbari, the committee\u2019s government co-chair, hit out at \u201cterrorism\u201d and hailed \u201cthe sacrifices and heroic deeds\u201d of our army.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe occupation of our territory, the spoliation of our resources, the continuing imposing of unilateral sanctions threaten the entire political process as well as being in contradiction with international legitimacy\u201d.\n\nOpposition co-chair Hadi al-Bahra said 65 percent of Syria had been damaged, adding: \u201cIt is time for us to believe victory in Syria is achieving justice and peace not winning the war.\u201d\n\nGovernment and opposition delegations sat stony-faced opposite each other in a gilded hall at the U.N. European headquarters in Geneva, convened by U.N. Special Envoy Geir Pedersen with the backing of major powers.\n\nThe 150-member committee is designed to pave the way for political reform and free and fair U.N.-supervised elections in the country, where the war has killed hundreds of thousands of people and forced millions to flee since March 2011.\n\nThe government, Syrian opposition and civil society groups each have 50 members serving on the panel. Each delegation includes Kurds, but there is no representation from the SDF militia or its main Kurdish YPG component.\n\nA sub-group of 45 is charged with drafting a new constitution or revising the 2012 one.\n\n\u201cThis is a historic moment,\u201d Pedersen said, while recognizing that it was not easy for the delegations to sit in the same room and the \u201croad ahead will not be easy\u201d.\n\n\u201cBut the fact you are here sitting face-to-face ready to start a dialogue and negotiations is I believe a powerful sign of Syrians everywhere, both inside and outside the country.\u201d\n\nThe co-chairs did not shake hands at the end of the 45-minute ceremony.\n\n\u201cIt is just the beginning of a very difficult process which is going to be extremely challenging to manage,\u201d Iran\u2019s foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told a news conference on Tuesday night after meeting his counterparts Turkey\u2019s Mevlut Cavusoglu and Russia\u2019s Sergei Lavrov in the Swiss city.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\n\u201cIt must be Syrian-owned and Syrian-led, it must be viable and seen as such by the Syrian people,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI think overall you find a good representation of all the Syrian people within the committee,\u201d al-Bahra told Reuters when asked about the Kurds.\n\nTurkey, which supports Syrian rebels, joined Iran and Russia, the main backers of Assad, in claiming credit for the initiative.", "description": "Syria's government condemned what it called the occupation of its land and the opposition demanded justice and peace on Wednesday at the opening of a U.N.-backed panel designed to bring about political reconciliation ending years of civil war.", "authors": ["Stephanie Nebehay", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446505221&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0TS", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
