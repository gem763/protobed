For example, maybe I will only turn it on when it reaches 30 degree Celsius outside.\n\nTeresa Kwok, 14, South Island School\n\nI plan on reducing my carbon footprint by not driving. I want to learn, but I know it isn\u2019t good for the environment. There\u2019s no real need to drive anyway, because there is plenty of public transport that I can take instead.\n\nEunice Yip, 18, Hong Kong Shue Yan University\n\nGiven the seriousness of the climate crisis, I think it is important that people make big changes in the way we live our lives. For me, this includes things like using a fan instead of the air conditioning and reducing the amount of meat in my diet. However, individuals can only do so much to tackle the climate emergency. The world\u2019s economy is designed to use up much of the planet\u2019s resources, making drastic action by businesses and governments important as well.\n\nJoshua Lee, 21, University of Hong Kong\n\nThe Amazon rainforest fires and Hong Kong: what's our impact and what can we do?\n\nTo reduce my carbon footprint, I will turn off the lights and I not use as much single-use plastic. I will help raise awareness of climate change at school and at home. I will write about it on social media as well. I care about our Earth!\n\nRhea Saxena, 13, King George V School\n\nI believe that global warming is of the utmost importance. Despite that, I am not willing to boycott school, as this would disrupt my schedule and that of my teachers. Putting my grades at risk would not help fight climate change. I would gladly attend a rally on a weekend, as this causes no disruptions to class and still supports the cause. I will also try to take public transport and use a fan instead of the air con during the summer.\n\nYuhan Huang, 13, German Swiss International School\n\nTo reduce my carbon footprint, I try to avoid wasting food, and I pack my own lunch instead of buying takeaway. I also walk instead of using transport if I know I\u2019m only going a short distance. I believe raising awareness of the climate crisis is very important and I support the people who are brave enough to do so.\n\nKai U Cheang, 17, Macao Anglican College\n\nA guide to the impact of cow's milk, almond milk, and soy milk on your health and the environment\n\nTo reduce our carbon footprint, many of us only take public transport, limit how much meat we eat, or become a vegetarian or a vegan. We donate money to groups that tackle the climate crisis. As a group we\u2019ve also been trying to brainstorm ways that we can tackle the climate crisis. We have a meeting with legislators to discuss our next steps. We\u2019re also brainstorming ideas to promote a sustainable lifestyle to Hongkongers. We are also thinking about taking part in the next climate strike.\n\nEwan Windebank, 17, Rosaryhill Secondary School (on behalf of organisers of Student Action for Climate Change Hong Kong)\n\nAt home, I use a small fan as much as possible to reduce the amount of time I have the air conditioning on. I have also introduced \u201cGreen Mondays\u201d at home, which means my family does not eat meat on Mondays. Adopting a flexitarian diet is a good way to reduce carbon emissions. I have also stopped eating beef.\n\nBelinda Ng, 19, University of Cambridge", "description": "Inspired by Greta Thunberg's #FridaysForFuture, teens share how they're doing their part for the environment", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/shutterstock_466476530.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
