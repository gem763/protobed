Although it was not immediately clear what punishment prosecutors would seek, Texas is a death penalty state.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sad to share with you that we\u2019ve lost one of our own,\u201d Harris county sheriff Ed Gonzalez said on Twitter. Dhaliwal \u201cwas unable to recover from his injuries\u201d, he said.\n\n\u201cThere are no words to convey our sadness. Please keep his family and our agency in your prayers.\u201d\n\nDhaliwal was shot about 12:45pm on Friday. Footage from a dashboard camera showed him having a conversation with the driver, then walking back toward his squad car. The driver\u2019s door swung open and he ran up behind Dhaliwal and shot him, the Houston Chronicle reported.\n\nOfficers escort the body of deputy Sandeep Dhaliwal, who was shot and killed after a traffic stop on Friday.

He was promoted to a deputy in 2015. He had three young children and was a practicing Sikh.\n\nDhaliwal made national headlines when he was granted permission to wear a turban and beard as part of his uniform in one of America\u2019s largest sheriff\u2019s offices.\n\n\u201cSandeep was a trailblazer for the Sikh-American community,\u201d Bobby Singh, south-east regional director for the Sikh American Legal Defense and Education Fund, said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cHe served not just the Sikh community here in Houston with honor and dignity, but all of his community.\u201d\n\nAmanda Williams sent us these photos & message.\n\n\"My son, Connor, met Deputy Dhaliwal at the Goforth memorial. They were smitten with one another from the moment they met. He was such a wonderful man. Such a tragic loss.\"\n\nHouston is in mourning -> https://t.co/kCuqauuWE4. #abc13 pic.twitter.com/7aArx9Ke5w\n\n\n\n\u2014 Steve Campion (@SteveABC13) September 27, 2019\n\nHouston mayor Sylvester Turner called Dhaliwal \u201ca bold and groundbreaking law enforcement officer in the eyes of our county, our state, our nation\u201d. Texas senator Ted Cruz said the state was \u201cmourning a hero\u201d.\n\nThe turban is a traditional sign of faith for Sikh men, which typically covers uncut hair and is worn with a long beard. According to the Sikh Coalition, a civil rights group, a turban is \u201ca public commitment to maintaining the values and ethics of the tradition, including service, compassion, and honesty\u201d.\n\nIn 2012, Washington DC became the first major US police force to make explicit accommodations for Sikhs to preserve their appearance on duty. An estimated 500,000 Sikhs live in the US as a whole.\n\nDhaliwal tried to fit into American culture when he was young by shaving his beard and removing his turban, he told India Abroad, an Indian-American news weekly. He was once told he could only mop floors because of his poor English, the outlet reported.\n\nCommunity-led candlelight vigil was held tonight in honor of @HCSO_D5Patrol Deputy Dhaliwal. Please continue to keep his family & his @HCSOTexas family in your thoughts & prayers. Deputy Dhaliwal was LOVED by this community. #HouNews pic.twitter.com/oD7M78RXxm \u2014 Major Mike Lee (@HCSOPatrol) September 28, 2019\n\n\u201cI found it very insulting, and decided I will work overtime on my education and my English,\u201d Dhaliwal said. He later started a trucking business, according to CBS.\n\nDhaliwal changed careers in his late 20s and took a \u201chuge pay cut\u201d to join the sheriff\u2019s department, Gonzalez told India Abroad.\n\nPermission to wear his articles of faith took time to wind through the department but was eventually made possible by a formal police department policy.\n\nDhaliwal said the permission to wear his turban and beard \u201cwas a very American thing to do. You can be a good American and you can practice freely your religion.\u201d\n\nAccording to India Abroad, the same day it was announced Dhaliwal could wear his articles of faith, he was given the day off. Instead, Dhaliwal went to work, to show his new uniform to his colleagues.", "description": "Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal was one of the first to wear the traditional Sikh articles of faith as part of his uniformSandeep Singh Dhaliwal, center, a Harris county sheriff\u2019s deputy, was known as a trailblazer for being one of the first to wear a turban and beard as part of his uniform.
