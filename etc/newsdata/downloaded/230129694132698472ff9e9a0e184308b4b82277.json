The Index COMP, -0.40% was 1.8% from its all-time closing high at 8,330.21, also hit on July 26.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the market?\n\nWall Street is fixated on an attack of Saudi oil production facilities that happened on Saturday, knocking out 5.7 million barrels of daily production, representing about 5% of the world\u2019s oil output.\n\nThe largest-ever disruption to oil production, as it has been described by experts, has momentarily overshadowed a much-anticipated gathering of the on Sept. 17-18 and unsettled the investment community even as all three major stock benchmarks stand on the verge of carving out record peaks.\n\ncrude for October delivery CLV19, +9.63% the U.S. benchmark contract, was up more than 10%, or $5.71, at $60.54 a barrel on Monday, set for its biggest one-day climb since February of 2016, while November BRNX19, +10.26% jumped more than 19% at its peak, which would have marked its sharpest-ever daily rise, but has since pulled back to a gain of $6.58, or almost 11%, to trade at $66.75 a barrel. That would also mark the sharpest daily run-up for the international benchmark grade since 2016.\n\nSurging oil prices hold the potential to disrupt the global economy if the rise is sustained, experts say. Climbing prices would also come as global economies, including China, a major importer of oil, have shown signs of economic strains.\n\nOn Sunday, President Trump said he authorized the release of oil, if needed, from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, or SPR, to mitigate any price surges. The U.S. holds about 630 million barrels of oil in the reserves, which is viewed as the biggest such stockpile of crude.\n\nHowever, market participants are worried about the duration of the oil disruption to Saudi Arabia\u2019s production and the possibility of further escalation between Saudi Arabia and those responsible for the Saturday attack of its Abqaiq plant and Khurais oil field. Houthi rebels have claimed responsibility for the attack but the U.S. has blamed Iran, which the Islamic Republic has forcefully denied.\n\nWashington and Tehran are locked in their own dispute after Trump pulled out of a global nuclear pact with the country and imposed fresh sanctions on its oil exports.\n\nStill, some strategists appeared somewhat sanguine about the impact of the Middle East drama on U.S. markets.\n\n\u201cIt will take a lot to disrupt the bull case for US stocks and the today\u2019s selloff that stemmed from the Saudi oil field attacks could see buyers eventually re-emerge,\u201d wrote Edward Moya, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA, in a daily research note. \u201cThe possibility of a US military escalation remains a key risk but that is probably not going to happen,\u201d he said.\n\nInvestors were also looking forward to a meeting of the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest-rate setting committee beginning Tuesday and concluding Wednesday, after which Chairman Jerome Powell will announce the central bank\u2019s latest policy decision.\n\nExpectations that the Fed will cut interest rates a second time this year, by a quarter percentage point to between 1.75% and 2% have fallen in recent days, after surprisingly strong consumer price-growth and retail sales data released last week spoke to the strength of the U.S. economy.\n\nFed funds futures markets now place a roughly 80% chance that the Fed will cut rates Wednesday, down from about 95% last week, according to CME Group (NASDAQ: ).\n\nWhich stocks are in focus?\n\nShares of oil producers Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: ). XOM, +2.02% and Chevron Corp. (NYSE: ) CVX, +1.63% were set to lead the higher on Monday, with Exxon shares up 4% in premarket action, while Chevron Corp.\u2019s stock rose 3.5%.\n\nWalt Disney (NYSE: ) Co. DIS, -0.98% chief executive Robert Iger has resigned from the board of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: ). AAPL, -0.10%, the company said Friday evening. Earlier last week, Apple revealed a new streaming service that will compete with a planned service by Disney.\n\nShares of General Motors Co (NYSE: ). GM, -2.70% fell 2.5% in premarket trade, after nearly 50,000 United Auto Workers went on strike amid negotiations between worker and management for a new four-year contract.\n\nHow are other markets trading?\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -2.18% fell 6 basis points to 1.84% after the bond market saw the biggest weekly sell off in several years. Bond prices fall as yields rise.\n\nGold prices GCZ19, +0.60% jumped 0.8% to $1,511.60 an ounce, while the U.S. dollar DXY, +0.25% relative to a basket of leading rivals.\n\nIn Asia overnight Thursday, Hong Kong\u2019s HSI, -0.83% fell 0.8%. In Europe, the SXXP, -0.41% fell 0.4% while the U.K.\u2019s commodity-heavy UKX, -0.30% declined 0.2%.\n\nOriginal Post", "description": "Stocks Analysis by MarketPulse (Ed Moya) covering: FTSE 100, Dow Jones Industrial Average, Hang Seng, General Motors Company.
