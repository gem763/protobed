This is because she knows how powerful change can be in her own life.\n\n\u201cI had acne, and felt really ugly for many years,\u201d she says. \u201cI hated dating. After I got rid of it I had a new confidence.\n\n\u201cWhen I did makeovers, I could see how much the women shifted. I like seeing that shift.\u201d\n\nSo it\u2019s no surprise the makeover queen has now turned her attention to the transformative power of make-up with her range Trinny London. It has been a labour of love from the start.\n\nAfter raising \u00a3150,000 from investors, Trinny ran out of money during the research and development phase. Her solution? To sell a sizeable chunk of her wardrobe.\n\n\u201cThis raised \u00a380,000, which enabled me to work for another year,\u201d she says. And her hard work paid off as the brand\u2019s sales are up 500% in the past year.\n\n(Image: BBC)\n\nWhen it comes to make-up, Trinny says less is definitely more. She recalls seeing Kylie Jenner in a restaurant in Portofino, Italy, over the summer.\n\n\u201cShe was sitting in this beautiful restaurant wearing so much make-up. She just didn\u2019t need it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve just started this new thing where I go up to people in the street and re-do their make-up.\n\n\u201cWomen tend to use foundation as armour. I want to give them the opportunity to see something different, which will empower them.\u201d\n\nShe is just as opinionated about fashion as ever and admits to being something of a control freak about her own look.\n\n\u201cSome stylists over the years may have had some not very nice things to say about me,\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s hard when I go on a shoot, and someone thinks they know how to dress me. I can\u2019t let go of what I know really works.\u201d\n\nBut she is more than happy to laugh at her own style mistakes. Yes, she regrets the too-short short skirts, the orange fake tan and the poker-straight ironed hair of her younger years.\n\nThroughout our chat, Trinny has been busy directing her make-up artist to do my make-up.\n\nThe end result is fantastic \u2013 she really has knocked years off me.\n\nI ask Trinny how she feels about getting older, saying a lot of my friends say they now feel invisible.\n\nShe tackles this subject in her typical no-nonsense style. \u201cFeeling old is about what\u2019s going on inside your head,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIf one week you suddenly don\u2019t feel good in something, or no longer feel attractive, it\u2019s not real. Nothing has changed outwardly in seven days.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\u201cRather than worrying, ask yourself how you can shift gear. I use guided meditation. It\u2019s about resetting yourself internally.\u201d\n\nFor Trinny, it\u2019s all about confidence.\n\n\u201cWalking into a room with real presence is something we should all be able to do until we die,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cAnd what do you need to get that? Well, the right clothes are a good start. It\u2019s about that that first impression. And finding your style allows you to do that.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, she\u2019s done. I take one last look at my glowing skin and head for the door, determined to take my new-found sense of presence with me", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: When Amber Graafland met Trinny Woodall, she ended up getting an unexpected makeover", "authors": ["Amber Graafland", "Molly Pike", "Image", "Anna Martensson", "Bbc"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20708240.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Trinny-Woodall.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
