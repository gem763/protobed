While it\u2019s true that some couples break up even after 10 years of seemingly wedded bliss, Office stans of the Internet flipped out Teigen\u2019s harsh prediction. One such outraged superfan was Pam herself, Jenna Fischer. Fischer joined Angela Kinsey on WHHL to play a game of Where Are They Now with all your favorite Scrantonites. According to Fischer and Kinsey Jim and Pam are still together, Phyllis had Bob Vance killed for the insurance money, and Ryan and Kelly are still on-again-off-again. Oh, and Stanley has new families across the country.\n\nActually you know what? Phyllis and Bob are def still together. Dwight and Angela still together. Michael and Holly definitely together. Mathematically (i got a C+) SOMEONE here has to be divorced. It\u2019s Jim and Pam. \u2014 christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) October 14, 2019", "description": "Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey were on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen to speak on what the Office characters would be doing now. Holly and Michael are still together, not in Scranton. Angela and Dwight have many children. And Bob Vance died", "authors": ["Bethy Squires"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/17/17-jenna-fischer.w1200.h630.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
