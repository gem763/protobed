It is, as per tradition, a delightful and strange assortment.\n\nThe top meme category on the platform this year was the good old \u201cshower thought,\u201d a genre of shareable epiphany you can probably trace back to the advent of the shower, or at least the 2011 creation of the r/showerthoughts subreddit. Number two was \u201cshitpost,\u201d a term as old as forum culture itself. But two of the biggest newbies on the list were genres that originated on Tumblr pre-2017, took off virally on other platforms, then circled back to where they came from, cementing their massive popularity: the gay pride version of the 2014 horror film character The Babadook, and \u201cwholesome memes,\u201d which is less a specific meme, and more a style defined by impossibly sweet sincerity, a contrast to and tonic for the tone of the rest of the web.\n\n(Also new to the list, a meme format spun off from the 2009 Owl City hit \u201cFireflies,\u201d in the news again this year because singer Adam Young decided to address the song\u2019s shaky science in a viral tweet.)\n\nThere were few surprises in the platform\u2019s list of its top communities, with artists, study bloggers, photographers, and poets holding onto the top four spots from last year. The highest-ranked community making that list for the first time is the 11th-place \u201cwitchblr\u201d \u2014 a growing group of people who blog mostly about witchcraft and adjacent occult fascinations. This includes Lana Del Rey fans who listened carefully to the pop queen\u2019s advice on how to hex the president and play with magical orbs inside the Hollywood sign, as well as tarot-readers, hokey emoji spell enthusiasts, serious students, and those who just enjoy a general aesthetic of \u201cwitchiness\u201d as it relates to lifestyle blogging, interior design, food, self-help, or internet-y expressions of modern feminism.\n\nAs the epicenter of fan fiction and its most popular subgenre, slash fic, Tumblr\u2019s list of top ships is pretty much the definitive word on which pop culture romantic pairings (both canon and imagined) are the biggest of the year. For 2017, that includes characters from anime, network television, YouTube, and a K-pop band. The non-canon pairing of Keith and Lance, from the web series Voltron: Legendary Defender, is number one, followed by Magnus Bane and Alec Lightwood of Freeform\u2019s Shadowhunters. Victor Nikiforov and Yuri Katsuki from Yuri!!! on Ice debuted on the list at number three, with YouTubers Daniel Howell and Phil Lester at number four. Park Jimin and Jeon Jungkook \u2014 two members of BTS, the most popular K-pop band on the site \u2014 debuted at number five.\n\nThe entire top 10 is made up of same-sex pairings, though Tumblr meme librarian Amanda Brennan pointed out to The New York Times that it skews less stringently male/male than usual. Two pairings from the CW\u2019s Supergirl also made the top ten \u2014 Kara Danvers and Lena Luthor; Maggie Sawyer and Alex Danvers \u2014 as did Waverly Earp and Nicole Haught, of the new Syfy series Wynonna Earp.\n\nThe most popular actor on the platform was Spider-Man: Homecoming\u2019s Tom Holland, largely thanks to a viral meme positing that he is constantly hiding frogs in his mouth. The biggest movies of the year were Wonder Woman and Moana, partly because literally every frame of the former was a beautiful GIF-able painting, and likely because Tumblr is full of young women who care loudly about diverse representation.\n\nWhile the most popular solo artists on Tumblr this year were unsurprising \u2014 Harry Styles, Taylor Swift, Rihanna, and so on \u2014 the top 10 for musical groups is a healthy and odd mix of pop-punk, boy bands, pop-punk boy bands, and boy bands that no longer exist:\n\n1. Gorillaz 2. Twenty One Pilots 3. Fifth Harmony 4. One Direction 5. 5 Seconds of Summer 6. Fall Out Boy 7. Little Mix 8. Paramore 9. The 1975 10. My Chemical Romance\n\nAll this is to say that the young people of Tumblr are unpredictable, and I love them.\n\nLast year\u2019s Fandometrics data haul prompted us to point out the unique usefulness of Tumblr, writing that its young audience made the most of a terrible year by \u201cmaking GIFs of Daisy Ridley, indulging in the sweet life story of a caterpillar, drawing pok\u00e9mon covered in flowers, photographing puppies covered in flowers, imagining that their favorite TV characters were in fact in love, looking at the Moon, and discussing a number of diverse progressive issues.\u201d\n\nThis holds true for 2017, despite several massive shakeups in the company\u2019s management, and a general feeling of uncertainty about the site\u2019s future. Just add in a little more looking at the Moon and a whole lot of lady superheroes, and you\u2019ll have an updated portrait of what is maybe the last nearly universally pleasant place on the internet. It would be cool if Verizon did not destroy it in 2018.", "description": "The teens had another good year on the internet\u2019s only good platform", "authors": ["Kaitlyn Tiffany", "Dec"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aKHc7WnBqFWgGmyOgT8zBpis7OU=/0x51:638x385/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8627223/Screen_Shot_2017_06_04_at_11.02.22_AM.png", "published_at": "2017-12-04"}
