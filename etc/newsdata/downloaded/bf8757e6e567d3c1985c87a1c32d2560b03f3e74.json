Photo: Pool/Getty Images\n\nFor the second day in a row, former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is making headlines for gently tiptoeing toward criticism of President Trump. Today, it\u2019s in The Atlantic, where the man dubbed \u201cMad Dog\u201d betrays that nickname by refusing to talk specifically about his problem with Trump, whom he reportedly finds to be of \u201climited cognitive ability, and of generally dubious character.\u201d\n\nAs Jeffrey Goldberg writes, Mattis is \u201cin an unparalleled position\u201d to comment on Trump\u2019s fitness for office. And he clearly has some thoughts on the matter. That was evident in the adapted essay published this week by The Wall Street Journal, which featured Mattis\u2019s critiques of Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy and isolationist tendencies.\n\nSo why not directly address Trump, Goldberg asked. Mattis responded by referencing the \u201cFrench concept of devoir de r\u00e9serve.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe duty of silence. If you leave an administration, you owe some silence. When you leave an administration over clear policy differences, you need to give the people who are still there as much opportunity as possible to defend the country. They still have the responsibility of protecting this great big experiment of ours. I know the malevolence some people feel for this country, and we have to give the people who are protecting us some time to carry out their duties without me adding my criticism to the cacophony that is right now so poisonous.\u201d\n\nA commitment to the \u201cduty of silence\u201d is not what one expects from a \u201cMad Dog,\u201d or from a guy who is about to embark on a book tour for his memoir. But Mattis insists that \u201cattacking\u201d Trump could \u201cweaken him when we\u2019re up against real threats.\u201d And, he says, he wouldn\u2019t want to criticize Trump when \u201cwe could be at war on the Korean peninsula, every time they start launching something.\u201d\n\nFor now, Mattis says, he owes his silence about the man whose behavior he describes as sometimes \u201ccounterproductive and beneath the dignity of the presidency.\u201d But the silence is \u201cnot eternal.\u201d At some point, he says, he\u2019ll no longer be worried about weakening Trump and he\u2019ll be willing to speak out. The question is when.", "description": "Mattis says that there\u2019s a period during which he owes his silence, but \u201cit\u2019s not going to be forever.\u201d", "authors": ["Adam K.
