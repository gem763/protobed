Axios reported on Saturday that Trump told House Republicans he made the call at Perry's request.\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201910/1095/1155968404_6092897841001_6092893058001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\nPerry also said he discussed the issue of corruption broadly with Zelensky and his predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, but only as part of an effort to make the nation more appealing for energy investment opportunities. No public evidence has emerged to show that Perry asked Zelensky to investigate Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nPOLITICO was first to report about how Perry urged Ukranian officials to put the U.S. businessmen on the supervisory board of Naftogaz. An Associated Press story subsequently outlined similar allegations, though Perry steadfastly denied any impropriety.\n\n\u201cThe idea that the AP story basically said that we said, \u2018you put these people on there\u2019 is just not correct. That was a totally dreamed-up story, best I can tell,\u201d Perry said. \u201cWe gave recommendations at the request of the Ukrainian government and will continue to.\u201d\n\nThe Energy secretary said he did not recall whether his recommendations included Michael Bleyzer, head of a private equity firm based in Houston, but said he\u2019d known him for years and would recommend him for a host of roles.\n\n\u201cBest I can tell, he\u2019s a really brilliant, capable businessman who I would recommend ... for a host of different things in Kiev,\u201d Perry said. \u201cHe knows the country. He\u2019s from there. So, why not?\u201d\n\nThe other energy executive was Robert Bensh, a Houston oil executive currently with Pelicourt LLC.\n\nPerry also denied he was planning to step down from his position, which POLITICO, the New York Times and Washington Post reported last week.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here. I\u2019m serving. They\u2019ve been writing the story that I was leaving the Department of Energy for at least nine months now. One of these days they'll probably get it right. But it\u2019s not today. It\u2019s not tomorrow. It\u2019s not next month,\u201d Perry said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/91/8b/fac957f24ff095f0b14b980bcf1e/191007-rick-perry-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
