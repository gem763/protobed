REUTERS/Manaure Quintero/File Photo\n\nUNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s attendance at a meeting solely about Venezuela during the U.N. General Assembly this week was a \u201cclear sign\u201d that pressure on President Nicolas Maduro would increase, Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido\u2019s chief diplomat said on Monday.\n\nTrump and U.S Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are expected to attend a meeting with Western Hemisphere leaders to discuss Venezuela on Wednesday, envoy Julio Borges told reporters.\n\nGuaido - who in January invoked Venezuela\u2019s constitution to assume a rival presidency, arguing Maduro\u2019s 2018 re-election was illegitimate - is seeking to use the U.N. meeting to pressure Latin American and European countries to take actions to force Maduro out of power.\n\nMore than a week ago, Guaido announced the end of a dialogue process between Maduro and the opposition, brokered by Norway\u2019s Foreign Ministry, arguing the socialist government was not serious about reaching a deal for new elections.\n\n\u201cSince it was Maduro who closed the door in the face of a solution that would have built an absolutely democratic transition process by going to elections, that means now it is up to us to write a new chapter of sanctions and pressure,\u201d Borges said.\n\nGuaido has been recognized as Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader by the United States and most Western countries, but Maduro retains the recognition of the 193-member U.N. General Assembly.\n\nMaduro calls Guaido a U.S.-backed puppet seeking to oust him in a coup, and says his representatives walked away from the negotiating table in protest against U.S. sanctions.\n\nBorges on Monday met with U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, who in a July report found that Venezuelan security forces had committed thousands of extrajudicial killings as part of Maduro\u2019s crackdown on dissent.\n\nBorges said they discussed ways to \u201cdeepen\u201d the investigation into rights violations in Venezuela as well as \u201cpunish\u201d those responsible, without giving details.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump's attendance at a meeting solely about Venezuela during the U.N.
