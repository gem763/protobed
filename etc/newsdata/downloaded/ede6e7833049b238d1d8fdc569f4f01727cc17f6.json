Mitt Romney of Utah became one of the first congressional Republicans on Sunday to call for more information about President Donald Trump\u2019s alleged efforts to get Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\u201cIf the President asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme\u201d Romney tweeted. \u201cCritical for the facts to come out.\u201d\n\nIf the President asked or pressured Ukraine\u2019s president to investigate his political rival, either directly or through his personal attorney, it would be troubling in the extreme. Critical for the facts to come out. \u2014 Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) September 22, 2019\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee is investigating a whistleblower complaint filed last month that reportedly accuses Trump of repeatedly pressuring Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the former vice president, who is currently running for president.\n\nTrump claims Biden called for the removal of a notoriously corrupt prosecutor in Ukraine to hamper an investigation into a Ukranian gas company, where his son Hunter served on the board of directors. Ukrainian authorities have said there\u2019s no evidence to suggest any wrongdoing by Biden.\n\nThe complaint was deemed credible and of \u201curgent concern\u201d by Michael Atkinson, the inspector general for the U.S. intelligence community. But Acting Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire, whom Trump appointed last month, has so far refused to share the complaint with Congress.\n\nThe explosive allegations, which, if true, could amount to a U.S. president seeking assistance from a foreign government to help his reelection campaign, have reignited calls for impeachment from many Democrats.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who has been reluctant to open an impeachment inquiry against Trump to the ire of her progressive colleagues, warned Sunday that efforts by the Trump administration to block Congress from seeing the complaint would lead to \u201ca whole new stage of investigation.\u201d\n\nBut Republicans have largely defended the president in the wake of the allegations. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) told reporters Sunday there\u2019s \u201cno direct evidence\u201d that Trump asked Zelensky to investigate Biden.\n\nTrump, however, has acknowledged that he discussed Biden during the July phone call with Zelensky. His personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, told The Washington Post on Sunday that he doesn\u2019t \u201cdo anything that involves my client without speaking with my client\u201d when asked if Trump approved Giuliani\u2019s requests that Ukrainian officials investigate Biden.\n\nSen. Pat Toomey (R-Penn.) told NBC on Sunday that he doesn\u2019t know \u201cthe context\u201d of Trump\u2019s call with Zelensky, but said it\u2019s \u201cnot appropriate for any candidate\u201d to \u201cask for assistance from a foreign government.\u201d\n\nTrump claimed his conversation with Zelensky was \u201cperfect\u201d but said he would consider releasing a transcript of the call, which Biden has urged him to do.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what actions Romney believes should be undertaken to ascertain the full facts of Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine.\n\nA representative for Romney did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.\n\nRelated coverage\n\nDonald Trump Is Asking A Foreign Country To Help Him Win.
