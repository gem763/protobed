Is there a slim chance?\"\n\nAmanda suggested that as Rebekah is pregnant, she might not want to get involved in such a big celebity drama.\n\nShe continued: \"Because I\u2019m being quite mindful of the fact that she\u2019s up the duff, she\u2019s pregnant, she\u2019s got a baby in there and we need to be mindful of all of the stress this might be causing but you know, we cannot stop reading about it \u2013 I\u2019m human!\"\n\nAlso on team Rebekah is her pal and fellow WAG Nicola McLean, who said she's had to take her kids out of school because of the backlash.\n\n(Image: Twitter)\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nNicola revealed that Rebekah \"can't stop crying\" as she argued that until it's proven that Rebekah did leak the stories she shouldn't be hounded online.\n\nThe stories contained fake things that had happened to Coleen, including choosing her next baby's gender, a flooding in her house and a return to TV, which all got leaked to the press.\n\nWayne Rooney's wife knew then exactly where they had come from, and took to Twitter to accuse her selling stories.\n\nColeen wrote: \"For a few years now someone who I trusted to follow me on my personal Instagram account has been consistently informing the sun newspaper of my private posts and stories.\n\n(Image: Internet Unknown)\n\n\"There has been so much information given to them about me, my friends and family - all without my permission or knowledge.\n\n\"After a long time of trying to figure out who it could be, for various reasons, I had a suspicion.\"\n\nColeen then revealed the details of her plan to expose the perpretator.\n\nShe explained: \"To try and prove this, I came up with an idea. I blocked everyone from viewing my Instagram stories except one account (those on my private account must have been wondering why I haven\u2019t had stories on there for a while.)\n\n\"Over the past five months I have posted a series of false stories to see if they made their way into the Sun newspaper. And you know what, they did!\n\n(Image: David Fisher/REX/Shutterstock)\n\n\"The story about gender selection in Mexico, the story about returning to TV and then the later story about the basement flooding in my new house.\n\n\"It\u2019s been tough keeping it to myself and not making any comment at all, especially when the stories have been leaked, however I had to.\n\n\n\n\"Now I know for certain which account / individual it\u2019s come from. I have saved and screenshotted all the original stories which clearly show just one person has viewed them.\n\n\"It\u2019s......... Rebekah Vardy\u2019s account.\"", "description": "Coleen, 33, claimed Rebekah, 37, had taken fake stories from her private Instagram and sold them, which she denies", "authors": ["Molly Pike", "Image", "Ken Mckay Itv Rex", "Instagram", "Twitter", "Internet Unknown", "David Fisher Rex Shutterstock"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18903410.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_This-Morning-TV-show-London-UK-03-Apr-2019.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
