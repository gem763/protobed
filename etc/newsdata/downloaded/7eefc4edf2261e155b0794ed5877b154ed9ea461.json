Thomas/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn a potentially major development affecting two of the four protected \u201cearly states\u201d in the 2020 Democratic presidential nominating process, the Democratic National Committee let it be known that it\u2019s going to disallow the \u201cvirtual caucus\u201d option for remote access to delegate selection events in Iowa and Nevada next February. The Des Moines Register broke the story:\n\nThe decision was confirmed to the Des Moines Register late Thursday by two sources close to the conversations. It follows a meeting of the DNC\u2019s Rules and Bylaws Committee last week in San Francisco, where members voiced concerns about the security of the Iowa plan and the potential for hacking.\n\nFirst Iowa, and then Nevada, have developed plans to let otherwise eligible voters cast their votes in caucuses by phone rather than showing up in person. What will make the apparent red light maddening to party officials in the two states is that the DNC forced them to make this option available in response to complaints \u2014 many of them from 2016 Bernie Sanders supporters, though Hillary Clinton offered similar criticism back in 2008 \u2014 that the traditional caucuses (and more generally, the traditional nominating process) excessively restricted participation. Iowa (followed by Nevada) wound up choosing a teleconference model for remote caucusing as more feasible than an absentee-ballot system or caucusing-by-proxy. But then this happened, as Bloomberg reported last weekend:\n\nAt a closed-door session of the Rules and By-Laws Committee on Thursday, the DNC told the panel that experts convened by the party were able to hack into a conference call among the committee, the Iowa Democratic Party and Nevada Democratic Party, raising concerns about teleconferencing for virtual caucuses, according to three people who were at the meeting.\n\nThe trouble \u2014 for Iowa, at least \u2014 with something less techno-dependent like mail ballots is that it could make the caucuses begin to resemble a primary and run afoul of New Hampshire\u2019s law requiring its secretary of state to do whatever is necessary, including moving its primary to the previous year, to maintain its first-in-the-nation status.\n\nIt probably didn\u2019t help the reputation of the \u201cvirtual caucus\u201d system that it was even more fiendishly complicated than the traditional Iowa event, as Vox explains:\n\nThe plan the Iowa Democratic party came up with would have given virtual caucus-goers six different days/times to call and choose their candidates. The last available day would have been February 3 \u2014 caucus day itself. Users would have dialed a phone number, entered a unique pin and their date of birth to verify their identities, and ranked up to five 2020 candidate choices over the phone.\n\nWhat was trickier is how these people\u2019s votes were to be counted and how much they would have accounted for. Here\u2019s how it was supposed to work: All of Iowa\u2019s four congressional districts would have been allocated up to an additional 10 percent of the overall state delegate equivalents (or, the delegate totals from each county). In other words, if one congressional district had 400 people going to their delegate convention, they would get an extra 40 delegates that could be awarded based on the results from the virtual caucus.\n\nThis wrinkle exacerbated complaints about Iowa\u2019s \u201cdelegate equivalent\u201d system for reporting caucus results; the DNC had already required that raw caucus totals be made public (to this day, many Bernie Sanders supporters believe he, not Clinton, would have won Iowa in 2016 had raw votes been reported). Two pots of raw votes \u2014 one of live caucusgoers, one of virtual caucusgoers \u2014 made the whole thing even more unwieldy.\n\nNevada had a simpler system whereby people could call in votes during one two-day window, but it has to go back to the drawing board as well.\n\nWith the Iowa and Nevada caucuses less than six months away, the DNC may simply decide to give Iowa and Nevada a waiver from its rules for 2020 and then work on fixing the system for the future \u2014 or perhaps even make more fundamental reforms in the nominating system. If that happens, a lot of campaign planning based on the virtual caucuses will have been wasted. Iowa political analyst Pat Rynard speculates about the potential impact:\n\nPolitically speaking, the biggest beneficiary of this debacle is Joe Biden. One of the best strategies to winning the Iowa Caucus is to inspire, organize and bring out a lot of new, first-time caucus-goers. Candidates like Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, Cory Booker and Julian Castro are all very well-suited to do just that. While Biden has strong support among the older and long-time caucus veterans who always show up, it is harder to see how he would turn out a whole new generation of caucus-goers like Barack Obama did in 2008 or Sanders did in 2016.\n\nThe virtual caucus would have greatly aided candidates who were focused on new voters. Even though they were still emphasizing showing up in person, campaigns would happily direct their supporters who simply can\u2019t make it out on caucus night into the phone option.\n\nHowever, even if this caucus runs like a more traditional year, Warren\u2019s superior ground game still poses the greatest threat to Biden. But Biden\u2019s chances are certainly better without the virtual option, and any margin of victory from anyone who might pass him may be smaller.\n\nIt\u2019s possible as well that having provoked the reforms that led to the virtual caucus system, Sanders supporters will view the DNC action as another Establishment effort to \u201crig\u201d the results. But this really isn\u2019t a very good time in political history to adopt potentially hackable technologies for voting events. So Iowa and Nevada may just be between a rock and a hard place for now \u2014 with all those candidates adjusting on the fly.", "description": "After a teleconference to discuss 2020 \u201cvirtual  caucuses\u201d for Iowa and Nevada was hacked, the DNC, which insisted on new methods of caucusing in response to charges of \u201crigging,\u201d got cold feet and disallowed the plans, leaving everyone in limbo.", "authors": ["Ed Kilgore"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/02/13/13-iowa-caucus.w1200.h630.jpg"}
