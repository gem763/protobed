He\u2019s not a teen, and he\u2019s a former smoker, so he thought substituting a vape for cigarettes was a healthy decision when he switched two years ago. But then, he wanted to quit the Juul, too. He tried multiple times, cold turkey, to no avail. The Juul addiction stuck around, at least until he found sugar snap peas.\n\n\u201cI carry around this big bag of sugar snap peas to keep me occupied and replace the Juul,\u201d he says. \u201cI used to say \u2018phone, keys, wallet, Juul\u2019 \u2014 that\u2019s what I needed to have before I left the house. But now it\u2019s \u2018phone, keys, wallet, peas.\u2019\u201d\n\nKorman\u2019s not alone in trying to kick his Juul habit. What started as a way for some people to wean themselves off cigarettes has turned into a new kind of addiction made worse by the ability to vape just about anywhere. In other cases, people who started vaping just because the Juul was around have developed new nicotine habits. For both types of users, quitting has proven immensely difficult.\n\nKorman says he\u2019s been eating a pound of sugar snap peas a week instead of reaching for his Juul. He decided to quit last month because the habit was costing him around $8 a day, the price of a single Juul pod. He also went on a health kick and realized he changed his diet and exercise habits, but still held onto his electronic nicotine stick.\n\nThe real motivation, though, came after recent reports about a mysterious severe lung disease linked to vaping. \u201cYou\u2019re saying I\u2019m going to be broke and dead?,\u201d he asks. \u201cNo thank you.\u201d\n\nWhile vaping was initially positioned as a smoking cessation tool, it\u2019s increasingly being cast in a darker light. A mysterious lung disease has killed at least six people in the US with more than 450 cases reported, and officials believe it\u2019s linked to vaping \u2014 though the exact cause is still unknown. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has asked anyone who uses a vape to stop while they investigate, and the American Lung Association did the same. Senator Mitt Romney has asked the Food and Drug Administration to recall e-cigarettes, and President Donald Trump called this week for a ban on all flavored e-cigarette pods. Meanwhile, Juul is under investigation for marketing to minors and positioning its devices as a healthier alternative to cigarettes without FDA approval. Juul\u2019s own CEO told non-cigarette smokers to not use his company\u2019s products. \u201cDon\u2019t vape,\u201d he said. We reached out to Juul for this report and did not immediately hear back.\n\nThis message has reached the vapers. There\u2019s been a significant uptick in the amount of discussion on social media about quitting Juuls and other vapes, according to data from Sprout Social, a company that monitors social media trends. Between August 11th and September 9th, there were more than 60,000 Twitter mentions about quitting or stopping the use of Juuls or vapes, compared to only 16,000 at the same time last year. The data shows a noticeable spike in people tweeting about quitting vaping in late August, around August 26th, a few days after the first person died of the lung disease. The spike in Juul users tweeting about quitting started on September 1st, the same day The New York Times published a story that called the lung disease an \u201cepidemic.\u201d\n\ndamn my whole crew quitting the juul this is the new trend \u2014 former juuler (@cla666ire) September 7, 2019\n\nShannon Dunlop is one of the people who recently quit. She started vaping because her partner kept a Juul in their bedroom. He used it before bed, and she tried it, only to get hooked. She used it for six months or so and then began Juuling in her work\u2019s bathroom.\n\n\u201cI was triggered,\u201d she says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that I got so addicted to something that never even really called to me in the first place.\u201d\n\nDunlop tried quitting by hiding her two Juuls in a drawer and not buying pod refills. That didn\u2019t always work because sometimes she just bought more pods. Instead, her addiction broke when she went for a jog one day and her chest started hurting. She thought her Juul habit might be to blame.\n\n\u201cQuit the Juul now I\u2019m just addicted to nicotine gum\u201d -Confucius (551 B.C) \u2014 lil tweet (@harrise1117) September 9, 2019\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018I hate this thing,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe I am out of shape, but whatever, fuck the Juul.\u201d\n\nWhen she got home, she grabbed the Juuls out of her stash, turned on the sink, and drenched them in water. She posted the whole ordeal on Instagram Stories, ending the video by tossing a Juul in the trash.\n\n\u201cI took this huge stance and told my friends what I had done, so I felt like if I bought [more] pods, I\u2019d just be a fucking idiot,\u201d she says.\n\nquitting juul be like: i have eaten 3 bags of werthers in the past 32 hours \u2014 WEES @COMMS OPEN (@weeskunkz) August 25, 2019\n\nThe Juul, once a trendy meme, is now a menace. At its peak of coolness, and before everyone realized how unamusing this addiction would become, BuzzFeed published a story of vape memes called \u201c24 tweets about Juul\u2019s that only teens will find funny.\u201d Vice tried to figure out Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner\u2019s favorite Juul pod flavor. The New York Times published a piece about 2017, the year it points to as kicking off the \u201cJuul wave,\u201d saying that Juuls had become \u201cToo Cool.\u201d The rate of high school students vaping increased by 78 percent between 2017 and 2018, according to the FDA and CDC.\n\n\u201cWhat resonates with our generation is the memes,\u201d one teen told the Times. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the Juul on TV. But you\u2019ll see a bunch of memes about Juuling. It\u2019s just, like, making it more socially acceptable \u2014 it\u2019s perpetuating the thing that vaping is cool.\u201d\n\nBut Juul has lost its cultural cachet. The lung disease news seems to be the main catalyst for the shift to quitting, and Juul users are turning to the usual nicotine-quitting recommendations that have helped people stop using cigarettes for decades.\n\nVapers say they\u2019ve tried nicotine gum, patches, or pouches to taper their use, or try to replace their oral fixation with things like toothpicks. Some have looked into using essential oils or CBD to stop cravings. Others go to more extreme lengths, tossing their Juul into the ocean, out car windows, and into dumpsters.\n\nQuitting juul tonight, pray for me pic.twitter.com/yAbzGJOn2C \u2014 Jessie Fancher (@j_fanch37) September 8, 2019\n\nI just threw my juul out the window at work, im quitting it \u2014 Vann \u2076 (@anthony_vann3) August 23, 2019\n\nTo indicate how dramatic my friends are, Erin just recorded herself throwing her Juul into a street garbage bin to tell me that she\u2019s quitting \u2014 sarae (@honkytonky_) July 24, 2019\n\nFroste, a Twitch streamer associated with 100 Thieves, says he just recently quit the Juul after hearing about all the health risks associated with vaping. He started because he was hooked on cigarettes, but he says vaping took a dark turn when people started using them anywhere, unlike a cigarette.\n\n\u201cYou can hit it anywhere you want,\u201d Froste says. \u201cWherever \u2014 a restaurant, a car, anywhere, even on a plane.\u201d\n\nHe says he quit cold turkey nine days ago after tapering his use, but now finds himself hungry all the time and needing water. He also has physical withdrawal symptoms, like a headache, cough, and sore throat.\n\n\u201cYeah, it kind of sucks, but it\u2019s not like I would rather go back to Juuling,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re honestly one of the dumbest things that have become popular and cool with young kids.\u201d\n\nIf you or anyone you know is trying to quit vaping, the National Cancer Institute has an online resource available for teens.
