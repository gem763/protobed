Adam Schiff, D-Calif., ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, speaks after a closed meeting on Capitol Hill, Tuesday, June 6, 2017, in Washington. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nNothing about what the Democrats have done so far in regards to the impeachment process has been according to previously recognized rules and precedents.\n\nThey\u2019ve failed to even have a floor vote of the full House to open an inquiry as has been done in the past. That has also allowed them to skirt the rules requiring such things as bipartisan questioning in hearings. That\u2019s prompted some to believe they aren\u2019t serious, are playing to their base or are hoping to shake some more information loose to get Trump.\n\nRepublicans have ripped them for ignoring proper process so far. The White House has said they do not have to comply with the requests from Democrats if Democrats aren\u2019t even proceeding with a vote on a formal inquiry.\n\nBut there\u2019s another big problem in how they are proceeding, as Byron York of the Washington Examiner points out.\n\nThere have so far been two hearings in the House Democrats\u2019 effort to impeach President Trump over the Ukraine matter. Both have been held in secret. One was Thursday, the other Friday, and the public does not know what was said in either. Two more are scheduled for this week and will be held behind closed doors, too. The hearings are part of an effort to remove the president from office. There could not be a matter of more pressing public concern. There could not be a matter in which the American people have a greater stake. And yet the public has no idea what is being discovered. Last week\u2019s sessions weren\u2019t just secret. They were super-secret. The first hearing, in which the witness was former Ukraine special envoy Kurt Volker, was held in what is known as a SCIF, which stands for sensitive compartmented information facility. It is a room in the Capitol built to be impervious to electronic surveillance so that lawmakers can discuss the nation\u2019s most important secrets without fear of discovery. The second hearing, in which Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson testified, was also held in the SCIF.\n\nObviously, there was nothing terribly secret in the Volker and Atkinson hearings, as York notes. GOP came out of the meeting saying that nothing supported the impeachment hearing.\n\nSo why would you hold it in the SCIF unless you simply didn\u2019t want the public to hear what he had to say which apparently didn\u2019t support the Democrats\u2019 agenda?\n\nRepublicans are ripping the lack of transparency and pointing the finger at Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) who is leading the flawed effort.\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff is running an impeachment inquiry secretly, behind closed doors, and he\u2019s making up the rules as he goes along,\u201d said Republican Rep. John Ratcliffe. \u201cThese proceedings should be public,\u201d added Republican Rep. Jim Jordan. \u201cDemocrats are trying to remove the president 13 months before an election based on an anonymous whistleblower \u2026 and they\u2019re doing it all in a closed-door process.\u201d \u201cThis is nothing more or less than a show trial for the media,\u201d said Rep. Devin Nunes, ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee, noting that with secrecy rules in place, the public knows only what is leaked to the press. \u201cThe Democrats leak what they want to leak to build narratives.\u201d\n\nThis week they have more interviews coming up which will also be held in secret.\n\nSchiff argues that the secrecy is needed to protect the whistleblower. But that\u2019s nonsense. One doesn\u2019t have to use his name and one can set parameters as to restrict identifying information.\n\nBut trying to use that as an excuse to keep the whole proceedings secret from the American public is Orwellian, screams \u201ccoup\u201d and abuse of power. They don\u2019t want you to know what\u2019s going on, they want to filter it, feed you their narrative and have media spin it for them.\n\nIt isn\u2019t about respect for the American people and or the Constitution, it\u2019s all about how they can seize power. That\u2019s fundamentally wrong and need to be called out.", "description": "Democrats Trying to Impeach Trump in Secret Hearings", "authors": ["Nick Arama", "Brandon Morse", "Brad Slager", "Seton Motley", "Sister Toldjah", "Posted At Pm On October"], "top_image": "https://www.redstate.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ap-adam-schiff.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
