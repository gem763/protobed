More than a handful, members of the shared office space WeWork found out this week.\n\nEmployees of an unnamed company renting space in a Washington DC WeWork building returned to work after the weekend to find they were unable to enter the office \u2013 an umbrella had fallen sideways, jamming the door.\n\nNeeraj Agrawal, a spokesman for cryptocurrency non-profit Coin Center, tweeted photo evidence of the predicament, which quickly went viral.\n\nNeeraj K. Agrawal (@NeerajKA) My friend\u2019s entire company is locked out of their WeWork office because an umbrella fell, jamming the door.\n\n\n\nNo one can figure it out. It\u2019s been like this for 2 days. pic.twitter.com/ggaUkgYRFR\n\nAs the tweet made the rounds, dozens of armchair door-un-jammers weighed in on the best options to free the umbrella and get the workers inside. Among the suggestions: cut a hole in the door, drill a hole in the wall next to it or shimmy a wire through the crack in the door. But none of these solutions worked, said Mike Ponticelli, an employee who talked to Vice.\n\n\u201cTwo of my coat hangers went down in the fight,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was a \u2018does not compute\u2019 moment, because the situation had absolutely no apparent solution. I really appreciate everyone\u2019s ideas on Twitter, but we tried everything.\u201d\n\nPonticelli and his three colleagues were trapped outside the office for more than two days, sharing just one computer charger and watching their empty office from outside the glass windows.\n\nUltimately, WeWork got an engineer to drill a hole in the ceiling and lift the umbrella out of the way using wire and the workers were able to enter again. WeWork declined to comment on the incident, as it is in a quiet period ahead of its upcoming IPO. The most lasting lesson from the incident, said Agrawal, whose tweet has more than 115,000 favorites and 20,000 retweets, is that everyone on the internet thinks they are right.\n\n\u201cI had countless people telling me exactly how to fix it and they were totally wrong, but they were such smug jerks about it,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cThe internet is bad.\u201d", "description": "A tweet bearing photo evidence of the predicament quickly went viral, inspiring many to suggest solutions", "authors": ["Kari Paul"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7a9409a829da96e7e1bdd265611d6ad63b0bb02/0_213_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f4f1da927b52e0f0dc299fd4945fba32", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
