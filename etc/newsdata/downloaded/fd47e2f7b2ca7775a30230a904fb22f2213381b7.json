Both longs and shorts reduced exposure, so it slightly undermines the bullish increase of positioning. Still, Wednesday\u2019s FOMC meeting is in focus this week, which could see either bulls or bears return to the table to provide further clarity.\n\nGBP Large Speculative Positioning Chart\n\nGBP: With net-short exposure increasing by Tuesday\u2019s close, we can only assume short-covering has fuelled the bullish breakout on GBP/USD on Friday. After hitting 1.25 following its breakout from compression, price action suggests there could be further upside and traders could look to buy dips above 1.24.\n\nAUD Large Speculative Positioning Chart\n\nAUD: Baby steps, but we can\u2019t help but notice the bullish divergence forming between the net-short exposure and price action. Sure, price action remains in a clear downtrend, but gross-short exposure has reached historical extremes usually associated with rallies, and short-exposure is beginning to dwindle. So we\u2019ll be keeping a close eye on positioning for the Aussie, as it is reminiscent of the slow turnaround seen on CAD earlier this year.\n\nLarge Speculative Positioning (As % Of Open Interest)\n\nAs of Tuesday 10th September:\n\nGold bugs reduced net-long exposure at their fastest rate in 4-months\n\nTraders were their most bullish on platinum in 18-months\n\nShort covering supported copper prices\n\nGold Large Speculative Positioning Chart\n\nGold: Gold prices finally came off after signaling a bullish sentiment extreme in the preceding weeks. With traders reducing net-long exposure by -3101k contracts, it's their most aggressive long-reduction in over four months. However, short positioning was mostly unchanged (at just -449 contracts), so it appears this is part of a much-needed correction, as opposed to a bearish case for gold. Besides, with geopolitical tensions rising once more, gold prices could remain stubbornly high.\n\n\"Disclaimer: The information and opinions in this report are for general information use only and are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or sale of any currency or CFD contract.
