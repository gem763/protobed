President Moon Jae-in presided over a meeting last Thursday and called on Finance Minister Hong Nam-ki to expand fiscal spending.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Economy and Finance, Korea's national-debt-to-GDP ratio reflecting sovereign bonds to finance supplementary fiscal spending is projected at 39.5 percent. Next year a fiscal deficit is expected when government spending surpasses W500 trillion for the first time (US$1=W1,196).\n\nIn that event Korea's debt is expected to surpass W780 trillion and the debt-to-GDP ratio to rise to 40.3 percent.\n\nHong reportedly urged caution, but Moon pointed out that the average debt-to-GDP ratio of OECD member countries is 100 percent and asked Hong to provide a rationale for setting the 40-percent ceiling.\n\nCheong Wa Dae officials, meanwhile, were still busy painting a rosy picture of Korea's economy. Jung Tae-ho, the senior presidential secretary for job creation, claimed a \"comprehensive look\" at various economic indicators shows the employment situation \"is improving compared to last year, which is encouraging.\"", "description": "National Debt to Reach 40% of GDP This Year", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://image.chosun.com/facebook/newson.gif", "published_at": "2019-05-20"}
