His personality was awesome,' promoted rape, and posted about attacking women in public.\n\nIn 2018, Reddit passed Facebook and became the third most popular website in the US, behind only Google and YouTube.\n\nWhile Reddit generates more than 14 billion page views a month and has 330 million active users, the site has fewer than 500 paid employees and relies heavily on volunteer moderators to help enforce its policies.\n\nReddit isn't the only social media company focusing on harassment. This week Instagram introduced a new 'Restrict' button that will allow users to restrict another person's access to their account and mute their comments in case of persistent or hostile comments\n\nIn the past, moderators have been targeted just as frequently, and sometimes more frequently, than ordinary users.\n\n'By doing your volunteer job as a mod you're putting yourself at risk, because, apparently, [Reddit's] tools are not enough to contain these psychos,' said Robert Allam, a moderator of the popular r/tifu subreddit.\n\n'Reddit just keeps allowing these fresh accounts to be made in batches. Most of them are suspended accounts that broke the rules, but they come back for more.'\n\nReddit isn't the only social media company focusing on harassment.\n\nWHAT ARE THE EIGHT DIFFERENT WAYS PEOPLE CAN BE CYBER BULLIED? According to Dr Larisa McLoughlin, a researcher at the University of the Sunshine Coast in Australia, cyber bullying can include both overt (name calling, mocking, shaming) or covert (exclusion, isolation) aspects. Cyberbullying can involve written-verbal behaviors such as phone calls, text messages and comments on social media. Eight examples of cyberbullying involve: Trolling : purposefully posting hurtful comments to provoke a response. Flaming : an array of aggressive comments from one to another. Visual Behaviors : posting, sending or sharing pictures or videos, usually to cause embarrassment. Exclusion : intentionally excluding someone from an online group or, in the case of online gaming, excluding a player from groups or teams. Catfishing : falsifying online identities to trick the victim into romantic relationships. Impersonation : using the victim's name and account to damage the victim. Stalking : for example sending multiple text messages to the victim to show the bully knows exactly what they are doing, where they have been. Threatening violence : for example threatening some form of traditional bullying, such as a physical fight.\n\nThis week Instagram introduced a new 'Restrict' button that will allow users to restrict another person's access to their account and mute their comments in case of persistent or hostile comments.\n\nIt's meant to give people a way to filter out abusive behavior without formally reporting a user, which might cause them to become even more hostile.\n\n'Once you Restrict someone, comments on your posts from that person will only be visible to that person,' according to Instagram.", "description": "Reddit has become infamous for its abusive and toxic users.
