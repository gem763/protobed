So it\u2019s being viewed as the enabling foundation for a raft of futuristic technologies \u2014 from connected and autonomous vehicles to real-time telesurgery.\n\nBut increased network capabilities that support many more critical functions means rising security risk. The complexity of 5G networks \u2014 marketed by operators as \u201cintelligent connectivity\u201d \u2014 also increases the surface area for attacks. So future network security is now a major geopolitical concern.\n\nGerman business newspaper Handelsblatt, which says it has reviewed a draft of the incoming 5G security requirements, reports that chancellor Angela Merkel stepped in to intervene to exclude a clause which would have blocked Huawei\u2019s market access \u2014 fearing a rift with China if the tech giant is shut out.\n\nEarlier this year it says the federal government pledged the highest possible security standards for regulating next-gen mobile networks, saying also that systems should only be sourced from \u201ctrusted suppliers\u201d. But those commitments have now been watered down by economic considerations at the top of the German government.\n\nThe decision not to block Huawei\u2019s access has attracted criticism within Germany, and flies in the face of continued US pressure on allies to ban the Chinese tech giant over security and espionage risks.\n\nThe US imposed its own export controls on Huawei in May.\n\nA key concern attached to Huawei is that back in 2017 China\u2019s Communist Party passed a national intelligence law which gives the state swingeing powers to compel assistance from companies and individuals to gather foreign and domestic intelligence.\n\nFor network operators outside China the problem is Huawei has the lead as a global 5G supplier \u2014 meaning any ban on it as a supplier would translate into delays to network rollouts. Years of delay and billions of dollars of cost to 5G launches, according to warnings by German operators.\n\nAnother issue is that Huawei\u2019s 5G technology has also been criticized on security grounds.\n\nA report this spring by a UK oversight body set up to assess the company\u2019s approach to security was damning \u2014 finding \u201cserious and systematic defects\u201d in its software engineering and cyber security competence.\n\nThough a leak shortly afterwards from the UK government suggested it would allow Huawei partial access \u2014 to supply non-core elements of networks.\n\nAn official UK government decision on Huawei has been delayed, causing ongoing uncertainty for local carriers. In the meanwhile a government review of the telecoms supply chain this summer called for tougher security standards and updated regulations \u2014 with major fines for failure. So it\u2019s possible that stringent UK regulations might sum to a de facto ban if Huawei\u2019s approach to security isn\u2019t seen to take major steps forward soon.\n\nAccording to Handelsblatt\u2019s report, Germany\u2019s incoming guidance for 5G network operators will require carriers identify critical areas of network architecture and apply an increased level of security. (Although it\u2019s worth pointing out there\u2019s ongoing debate about how to define critical/core network areas in 5G networks.)\n\nThe Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) will be responsible for carrying out security inspections of networks.\n\nLast week a pan-EU security threat assessment of 5G technology highlighted risks from \u201cnon-EU state or state-backed actors\u201d \u2014 in a coded jab at Huawei.\n\nThe report also flagged increased security challenges attached to 5G vs current gen networks on account of the expanded role of software in the networks and apps running on 5G. And warned of too much dependence on individual 5G suppliers, and of operators relying overly on a single supplier.\n\nShortly afterwards the WSJ obtained a private risk assessment by EU governments \u2014 which appears to dial up regional concerns over Huawei, focusing on threats linked to 5G providers in countries with \u201cno democratic and legal restrictions in place\u201d.\n\nAmong the discussed risks in this non-public report are the insertion of concealed hardware, software or flaws into 5G networks; and the risk of uncontrolled software updates, backdoors or undocumented testing features left in the production version of networking products.\n\n\u201cThese vulnerabilities are not ones which can be remedied by making small technical changes, but are strategic and lasting in nature,\u201d a source familiar with the discussions told the WSJ \u2014 which implies that short term economic considerations risk translating into major strategic vulnerabilities down the line.\n\n5G alternatives are in short supply, though.\n\nUS Senator Mark Warner recently floated the idea of creating a consortium of \u2018Five Eyes\u2019 allies \u2014 aka the U.S., Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK \u2014 to finance and build \u201ca Western open-democracy type equivalent\u201d to Huawei.\n\nBut any such move would clearly take time, even as Huawei continues selling services around the world and embedding its 5G kit into next-gen networks.", "description": "Germany is resisting US pressure to shut out Chinese tech giant Huawei from its 5G networks \u2014\u00a0saying it will not ban any supplier for the next-gen mobile networks on an up front basis, per Reuters. \u201cEssentially our approach is as follows: We are not taking a pre-emptive decision to ban any actor, or any company,\u201d [\u2026]", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/GettyImages-1132351929-e1559551926489.jpeg?w=751", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
