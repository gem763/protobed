On that front the hosts certainly delivered. Kabuki performers clad in elaborate customs and masks? Tick. A miniature-sized Mount Fuji rising elegantly from the centre of the pitch? Naturally. A life-sized Richie McCaw holding the Webb Ellis Cup above his head? You bet.\n\nAs opening ceremonies go, it did what exactly it said on the tin. It was the words of World Rugby chief Bill Beaumont, though, that consideration must be given to. \u201cOver the next six weeks we will experience the very best of rugby and the very best of Japan as excitement sweeps this great nation,\u201d he declared, with Crown Prince Akishino \u2013 a royal upgrade on 2015\u2019s Prince Harry? \u2013 stood by his side. Because, outside of this spectacle, delivered on a typically humid evening in the Japanese capital, you wonder what is really in store for the Rugby World Cup as it unfolds over the coming weeks.\n\nLet\u2019s roll back 24 hours to the heat and hustle of a small, boxy izakaya in Yokohama, situated at the heart of the city\u2019s Noge district. Hunched over a bowl of ramen, chop sticks dipping in and out of the hot broth beneath, Ayako looks confused. It could be something to do with the hapless journalist stood in front of her, stumbling through mispronunciations of the most basic Japanese words, but there\u2019s no doubt of her response when it becomes clear what\u2019s being asked. \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t watch rugby,\u201d she says, eager to return to her meal. Ayako, a teacher from the local area, cannot speak for everyone. But she\u2019s certainly not alone.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nIn this particular corner of Yokohama, there\u2019s little to suggest that the Rugby World Cup has touched down on Japanese shores. There\u2019s no rugby-themed paraphernalia in sight. On the TV, highlights from the sumo wrestling at Tokyo\u2019s Ry\u014dgoku Kokugikan draws the interest of those sat at the bar. Outside and beyond, posters and adverts promoting the tournament are hard to come by. Talking to the locals themselves, there\u2019s a distinct absence of anticipation and excitement. Many are aware but simply not bothered. When it comes to sport, their interests lay elsewhere.\n\nThe numbers confirm this. According to a recent white paper, there are around 100,000 registered rugby players in Japan \u2013 this for a country with a population of 126.8 million. Volleyball has four times that number, football ten. The average match in the domestic rugby league draws crowds of around 5,000.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

The disproportionate focus on the two events would suggest so. The Olympics logo catches your eye wherever you go in the capital. TV screens on trains in and out of the city flicker repeatedly between adverts for the Games, with gold medallist hopefuls such as Naomi Osaka, Kaori Icho and Kiyo Shimizu given an abundance of airtime.\n\n\u201cThere is definitely more focus on the Olympics, they have been talking about that for years,\u201d Jeff, a sumo ticket seller who lives an hour outside Tokyo, tells The Independent. \u201cBesides a few friends I have who post about rugby pretty much non-stop, I\u2019ve only seen large-scale awareness of the World Cup in the last few months or so of my daily life.\u201d Tokyo 2020, it seems, is the overwhelming source of pride for the country.\n\nSet against this backdrop, has World Rugby rolled the dice in bringing its crown jewel to Japan? At a time when international rugby remains the preserve of an elite core of financially-endowed countries, officials will argue that this year\u2019s tournament represents one thing more than anything else: opportunity.\n\nAs a tier-two nation knocking on the door of its bigger rivals, Japan can lead the way in breaking down such barriers, bridging the gap and expanding the sport beyond its traditional homelands. Already we\u2019ve seen signs of the Japanese public\u2019s willingness to embrace the culture and colour of the Rugby World Cup. The sight of 15,000 locals signing the Welsh national anthem to welcome Warren Gatland\u2019s side to Kitakyushu is exactly the sort of marketing-friendly, viral content that organisers need to drive rugby into the national consciousness.\n\nThe success of the Cherry Blossoms in the tournament will prove similarly crucial. The average league attendances almost doubled after Japan beat South Africa in 2015. Imagine, then, what an impressive running on home soil will do for the sport here. It\u2019s certainly not beyond the realm of possibility. Japan moved up to ninth in the world rankings this summer \u2013 a record-equalling best \u2013 after claiming victory in the Pacific Nations Cup. The side has come a long way over the years and, with the backing of the crowds, there\u2019s every reason to believe they could edge either Ireland or Scotland to second place in Pool A.\n\nIf the promise Bill Beaumont made on Friday night is delivered, Japan and the watching world is in store for quite the treat over the coming months. Yes, the decision to host rugby\u2019s grandest event here may be a gamble \u2013 but isn\u2019t that what sport is all about? Inspiring, capturing the imagination, pulling in new fans, sparking a passion that previously wasn\u2019t there. The Japanese have quite the challenge on their hands but if they can\u2019t manage it, then who can?", "description": "\u201cFrom rugby enthusiasts to fans of Japanese culture,\u201d World Rugby had promised \u201csomething for everybody\u201d ahead of the opening ceremony here in Tokyo.
