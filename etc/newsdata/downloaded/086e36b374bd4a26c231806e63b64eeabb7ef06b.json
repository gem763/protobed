Mitigate the impact of Philadelphia\u2019s pass rush\n\nWashington is missing its best offensive lineman, which could be a serious problem. The Eagles aggressively pursue the passer and will be able to seize on the team\u2019s perceived weaknesses at left tackle (36-year-old Donald Penn) and left guard (either Ereck Flowers, a failed tackle, or rookie Wes Martin).\n\nCase Keenum is an unwanted QB who keeps winning jobs. He \u2018wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u2019\n\nQuarterback Case Keenum is not fast but is adept at avoiding the pass rush. This game could be a test of his ability to keep the Redskins from falling into long-yardage situations.\n\n2. Get defensive penetration up front\n\nJonathan Allen, Matt Ioannidis and Daron Payne have played together long enough that the Redskins\u2019 defensive front is on the cusp of becoming one of the NFL\u2019s best. In the brief time the first-team defense was on the field in the preseason, the three got tremendous surges into the offensive backfield, rattling the quarterback and shutting down the running game. It is essential for Washington\u2019s defense to get to Carson Wentz and stop the Eagles\u2019 ground game before it gets started.\n\n3. Get Guice going\n\nDespite rushing for more than 1,000 yards last year, Adrian Peterson might not be active for this game: The Redskins are handing their running offense to Derrius Guice. And while Guice is a more dynamic runner, he\u2019s also an unknown quantity. He missed all of last season with a torn ACL and only played one half this preseason. Washington is counting on him to break off big early runs and keep it from the dreaded second and eight that bogged down its offense last year.\n\n4. Win the field position game\n\nQuietly, punter Tress Way was one of the most valuable Redskins last season. He went the year without a touchback and often forced opponents to move the ball 70 or more yards to score. Washington hopes to play a ball-control game this year, relying on what it hopes will be an effective but slow-moving offense and a dominant defense. To make that work, the Redskins have to make effective use of their possessions, at least getting the ball close to midfield much of the time.\n\n5. Let the young receivers fly\n\nThe Redskins let Josh Doctson go in large part because they believe in young wide receivers Trey Quinn, Terry McLaurin and Kelvin Harmon. Quinn and McLaurin are first-team receivers, and the coaches love Harmon\u2019s ability to fight for passes in the air. With tight end Jordan Reed (concussion) questionable, even more pressure could be put on Quinn, McLaurin and the others to get open and catch passes.\n\nMore Redskins:\n\nCase Keenum is an unwanted QB who keeps winning jobs. He \u2018wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u2019\n\nDaniel Snyder dreamed of owning the Redskins. Two decades in, success remains elusive.\n\nLandon Collins has always acted older than his age. At 25, he\u2019s a leader for the Redskins.", "description": "Washington will need to withstand Philadelphia\u2019s pass rush with a group of mostly inexperienced receivers.", "authors": ["Les Carpenter", "Reporter Covering Washington Redskins"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZNBBPIVPLRCQBH4ITV4SB7MPAE", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
