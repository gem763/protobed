The company is creating a new cryptocurrency named \"Atari Token.\"\n\nThe Atari Token is being created specifically for use on a new digital platform that Atari is working with an outside party to build.\n\nThe new platform is being built on blockchain technology.\n\n\n\nForget about \"Pong\" \u2014 Atari's next big move is into an entirely new industry: cryptocurrency.\n\nAtari SA, the French holding company that now oversees all \"Atari\" properties, announced earlier this month that it's working on a cryptocurrency named \"Atari Token.\" Moreover, that cryptocurrency is intended for use on a new digital entertainment platform.\n\nAtari itself isn't creating either. Instead, a company named Infinity Networks is collaborating with Atari on the project. In exchange for a \"long-term license\" to use Atari's name, Infinity Networks is creating a blockchain-based platform \u2014 a storefront, essentially \u2014 for various forms of digital entertainment, \"ranging from video games to movies and music.\"\n\nAdditionally, Atari is taking a minority stake in Infinity Networks in exchange for use of Atari's brand name (in addition to potential future royalties and earnings from the platform).\n\nThe history of Atari game consoles was on display at the 2015 Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. Matt Weinberger\n\nIf all of this sounds a little strange to you, that's because it's all pretty strange. Atari's history is long and storied, and it's directly intertwined with the rise of the video game industry.\n\nThe company is largely credited with having created the game industry \u2014 first with games like \"Pong\" and \"Breakout\" in arcades, and then with home game consoles like the Atari 2600. It's also notorious for having helped bring about the crash of the game industry in the early '80s.\n\nSince those days, Atari has devolved from a game developer/publisher and hardware manufacturer to little more than a famous brand name. The current incarnation of \"Atari\" is a re-branding of a French company previously named Infogrames. There are actually several different business entities named some derivation of \"Atari\" at this point \u2014 Atari SA is the parent company that's responsible for the Atari Token and this upcoming blockchain-based digital storefront.\n\nThat parent company is currently attempting a big turnaround for Atari, and it looks like the latest efforts are working. The announcement alone was enough to bolster Atari SA's stock \u2014 Bloomberg reports that it leapt by more than 60% on the news. It's unclear when the new platform will launch, or when Atari Token will become available for purchase.", "description": "Atari's got an ambitious plan to create its own cryptocurrency, called Atari Token, and launch a digital entertainment platform \u2014 all at once.", "authors": ["Ben Gilbert"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5a87110cd030721c008b4649?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2018-02-16"}
