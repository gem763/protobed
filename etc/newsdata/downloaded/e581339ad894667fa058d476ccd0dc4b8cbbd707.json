You know, that incredibly long block of text you scroll quickly by without reading?\n\nGuard is a site that uses AI to read epically long privacy policies and then highlight any aspects of them that might be problematic.\n\nOnce it reads through a site or app\u2019s privacy policy it gives the service a grade based on that policy as well as makes a recommendation on whether or not you should use it. It also brings in news stories about any scandals associated with a company and information about any security threats.\n\nTwitter, for instance, has a D rating on the service. Guard recommends you avoid that app. The biggest threat? The company\u2019s privacy policy says that it can sell or transfer your information.\n\nFor now, you\u2019re limited to seeing ratings for only services Guard has decided to analyse, which includes most of the major apps out there like youTube, Reddit, Spotify and Instagram. However, if you\u2019re interested in a rating for a particular app you can submit it to the service and ask it to be done.\n\nAs the list of supported services grow, this could be even more of a solid resource in looking into what you\u2019re using on your phone or computer and understanding how your data is being used.", "description": "Whenever you sign up for a new app or service you probably are also agreeing to a new privacy policy.
