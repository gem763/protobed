The report should reveal to traders clues about demand trends in the wake of the slowing global economy. Additionally, losses are likely being softened by optimism over U.S.-China trade relations.\n\nAt 09:51 GMT, December WTI crude oil is trading $55.37, down $0.44 or -0.79% and December Brent crude oil is at $61.24, down $0.33 or -0.54%.\n\nInventories in Focus\n\nLast week\u2019s unexpected drop in U.S. inventories, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), drove prices sharply higher so this week\u2019s report has taken on added importance since traders want to know if the decline was part of a developing trend, or just a \u201cone-and-done\u201d move.\n\n\u201cThe inventory read last week is still reverberating through trading, although we did see that finally start to give way last night, but we can see there is very little appetite to go with it today,\u201d said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.\n\nThe API will release its report at 20:30 GMT later today. The EIA will show its numbers on Wednesday at 14:30 GMT. In the meantime, investors are trying to digest the early forecast calling for an inventory build of around 700,000.\n\nAnother number to watch will be U.S. crude oil stockpiles at the Cushing, Oklahoma futures hub. Stockpiles for WTI crude oil are forecast to have risen about 1.5 million barrels in the week through October 25, traders said earlier in the session, citing data from market intelligence firm Genscape.\n\nTrade Talk Optimism, OPEC Production Cuts\n\nDespite the early weakness, the markets are still being underpinned by the hope that the United States and China would reach at least a partial trade agreement sooner than expected. This idea was supported by President Trump on Monday when he said he expected to sign a significant part of the trade deal with China ahead of schedule but did not elaborate on the timing.\n\nCrude oil bulls are also hoping OPEC and its allies continue to push for deeper production cuts at their December 5 -6 meeting.\n\nThis article was originally posted on FX Empire\n\nMore From FXEMPIRE:", "description": "The API will release its report at 20:30 GMT later today.
