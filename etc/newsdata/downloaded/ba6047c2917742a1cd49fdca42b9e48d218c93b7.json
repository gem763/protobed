In the next hours, the Americans threw the Pentagon\u2019s arsenal at them, including B-52 strategic bombers. The attack was stopped.\n\nThat operation, in the middle of the American-led campaign against the Islamic State in Syria, showed the extent to which the United States military was willing to protect the Syrian Kurds, its main ally on the ground.\n\nBut now, with the White House revoking protection for these Kurdish fighters, some of the Special Forces officers who battled alongside the Kurds say they feel deep remorse at orders to abandon their allies.", "description": "", "authors": ["Eric Schmitt", "Nytimes.Com World Middleeast Kurds-Syria-Turkey-Trump.Html"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
