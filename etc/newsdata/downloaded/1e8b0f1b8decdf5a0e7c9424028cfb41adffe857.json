Without the ability to access the internet, she says she was unable to even complete a basic food shop.\n\nDee contacted BT, using her mobile phone, to say that she had been cut off but ended up spending over four hours speaking to five different people to raise a complaint.\n\nAt this point, BT said she would have to wait two weeks for the connection to be reinstalled.\n\nDee, unemployed due to medical grounds - a BT customer for 30 years - was disappointed by the news that her service had been cut and that it would take weeks to repair.\n\nShe said: 'The situation caused me considerable distress.'\n\nAs the couple had no internet, Dee's partner, who also acts as her carer, had no choice but to travel 40 miles into work every day, leaving her alone from 7am to 6pm.\n\nThe commute can take him over three hours a day \u2013 costing him money he would otherwise not have to spend and leaving Dee potentially at risk.\n\nBT said the connection was not installed after Dee initially told them she was moving house\n\nDee added: 'I don't understand why BT can turn my service off but not turn it back on.'\n\nBT gave Dee a \u00a350 credit on her account and told to get an internet dongle for \u00a310.\n\nHowever, to get this dongle her partner had to sign up for a contract at the cost of \u00a335 a month for a minimum of two months.\n\nWhen they got this working it only provided a basic speed that wasn't quick enough to establish the connection Dee's partner needed in order to work - or even for her to do online shopping.\n\nAfter This is Money contacted BT about Dee's issue, she received two visits from engineers. However, both were unannounced.\n\nOn the first visit, she was only made aware that the engineer was there when he called to say he was outside. Dee had to cancel an appointment she was en route to and come back home.\n\nDespite this, the engineer was unable to reconnect the phone or the broadband.\n\nThe next visit came the day after with the engineer, again, arriving with no prior warning.\n\nThe engineer was at her property for four hours and eventually got everything to work properly although her landline has been assigned a new number.\n\nDee has not yet been given a new number so although she can make calls, she is unable to give the number out for people to call her.\n\nA BT spokesperson said: 'We're really sorry for the time taken to reconnect Ms Stanton's services and apologise for the inconvenience caused.\n\n'When Ms Stanton informed us she would be moving house we processed a home move order to transfer her BT services to the new address.\n\n'However, we made a mistake and transferred Ms Stanton's services sooner than she requested. All of Ms Stanton's BT services have now been fully restored.'\n\nDespite now having working phone and broadband, Dee has not yet received any compensation for BT's error.\n\nHowever, BT said that she will be compensated for her loss of service in line with the Ofcom Automatic Compensation Scheme and it is in discussions with Ms Stanton regarding an additional gesture of goodwill.", "description": "Dee Stanton, from Nottinghamshire, found that her phone line and broadband was cut off without warning at the end of September.", "authors": ["Grace Gausden For This Is Money", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
