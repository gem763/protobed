David hasn't done anything amazing so doesn't deserve it at all in my opinion,' wrote one, before the show aired, while a second penned: 'Team Alice tonight - my favourite from really early on.'\n\nHowever, it was international health adviser David, 36, from London, who baked his way to victory in the last episode of the tenth series - much to the surprise of viewers and social media users alike.\n\n'My heart broke for Steph tonight she should have won,' wrote one, while a further added: 'Gutted for Steph. If it had been judged on consistency instead of the final she would\u2019ve won it hands down.'\n\nDavid Atherton (pictured), 36, from London, baked his way to victory in the last episode of the tenth series, which aired on Channel 4 tonight\n\nThe winner impressed judges Paul Hollywood and Prue Leith in tonight's nail-biting grand finale of the culinary competition (pictured altogether)\n\nBefore the show aired, fans took to social media to express their views on who they wanted to win (pictured)\n\nA third commented: 'Steph deserved to win regardless of how the last week went,' while a fourth added:\n\n'Well done David!! You were my dark horse all the way through and you pulled it out of the bag in the final. Well deserved.'\n\nIn the opening signature challenge the three remaining amateur bakers were asked to create the 'ultimate chocolate cake.'\n\n'Your cake needs to be creative and decorated to a professional standard - in just two hours,' explained presenter Sandi Toksvig.\n\nWhile David's was cake was dubbed 'too boozy' by the judges, they praised Steph's efforts and enthused: 'Now that's a black Forest gateau!'\n\nWhile creating his twice-baked Stilton souffl\u00e9, David admitted he once used a souffle tray for a plant pot, as he didn't know what it was. Pictured with Noel Fielding\n\nFan favourite Steph (pictured) failed to impress in the technical challenge, with judges comparing her souffl\u00e9 to a 'pancake'\n\nFor the technical challenge the finalists were tasked with tackling one of the most trickiest of delicacies - a twice-baked Stilton souffl\u00e9.\n\nBefore leaving the tent in order to judge blind, judge Paul Hollywood warned: 'On this challenge, you have to be delicate.'\n\nBut while Alice's attempts were 'under baked' and 'too gooey,' Steph's were branded more like 'pancakes' or 'soups' - and it was David's which were congratulated for being 'delicious.'\n\nFor the showstopper challenge and their very last chance to impress, the remaining trio were instructed to make an edible illusion.\n\nAdding an extra dimension to the bake, it had to be made of only cake, sweet bread and biscuits, while also representing a unique memory for the bakers.\n\nDavid came first in the technical challenge, Alice placed second and Steph was given last place (pictured)\n\nThe judges didn't hold back on their reviews of the amateur baker's Stilton souffle challenge.

It was never on my mind that I could win this,' beamed David, who was presented with the coveted cake stand, as well as flowers and the praise of her fellow bakers.\n\n'Week after week not being the Star Baker, just making it to the final was a win for me.'\n\nWhile many viewers admitted they never could have predicted the outcome, Twitter was inundated with messages of support to congratulate him on the win.\n\n'So glad David won #GBBOFinal - I know folk are annoyed with the outcome but it's who was best on the day. Roll on next year!,' wrote one, while a second commented:\n\n'Congrats to David! The right person won. He was consistent throughout. He kept his cool and pull out all the stops when it really counted.'\n\nA third added: 'Great win for David and well deserved. Steph and Alice were worthy finalists.
