They are the kind of Hindu charity said to bring good fortune \u2013 and newspapers often carry adverts from such facilities asking for donations.\n\nBut after successful schemes by public cow shelters in the state to let businesses and NRIs \u2013 non-resident Indians \u2013 adopt individual cows, the Madhya Pradesh (MP) government is now rolling this scheme out to let anyone get involved, and hopes the new website will speed up the process.\n\nWith a rise in cow protection vigilantism and state laws banning the slaughter of cattle, India is suffering from a stray cow crisis.\n\nIn MP alone, the government says there are 700,000 dairy cows who have stopped producing milk and been abandoned by their owners.\n\nEarlier this year, the MP government pledged to fund 1,000 new cow shelters \u2013 a promise which surprised some, since the state had recently changed hands from the Hindu nationalist BJP party of Narendra Modi \u2013 more associated with cow protection \u2013 to the progressive and secularist Congress party.\n\nCongress at the time said it too was a party that cared about cows, and claimed that the BJP had failed to build a single new shelter in its previous 15 years in power in the state.\n\nThe state minister for animal husbandry, Lakhan Singh Yadav, said the new website and app would help bridge the \u201cproblem of funds\u201d in setting up new shelters.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

As well as the main offering of adopting a cow for between 15 days and a lifetime, users on a tighter budget will also be able to purchase specific items the animals might need \u2013 from fresh green fodder and medicines to fans that keep them cool in the heat of the day.\n\nWhile this is believed to be the first government website set up just for cow adoption, it is not the first state to come up with creative solutions to the same problem.\n\nLast month the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh said it was putting up 100,000 abandoned cows for actual adoption, and that any charitable citizens who took a cow into their homes would be paid a monthly stipend of Rs900 (\u00a310) to help cover upkeep.\n\nAnd in Rajasthan, the Congress government proposed a scheme in January to pay tribute to those who (financially) adopted cows during events on Independence Day and Republic day. The policy was dropped, however, when it turned out it had first been proposed by the previous BJP administration.", "description": "Cows have long been venerated as sacred animals by India\u2019s Hindu majority, but now a state government is developing plans to bring this devotion into the 21st century.
