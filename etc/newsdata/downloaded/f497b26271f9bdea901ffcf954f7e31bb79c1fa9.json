He Would Have Detested Trump\u2019s Russia Fawning.", "language": "en", "text": "David L. Marcus is the author of two books about education and parenting.\n\nMy cousin Roy Marcus Cohn\u2014counsel to Senator Joe McCarthy, consigliere to Mafia bosses, mentor to Donald Trump\u2014had almost no principles. He smeared Jews even though he was Jewish. He tarred Democrats even though he was a Democrat. He persecuted gay people even though he was gay.\n\nYet throughout his life, he held fast to one certainty: Russia and America were enemies. Roy often told me the Kremlin blamed the U.S. for Russia\u2019s failure to prosper, so Russian leaders were bent on destroying our democracy.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIf Roy had lived another 30 years, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d be pleased to learn that his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 was elected president. But I am equally sure Roy would be appalled by Trump\u2019s obsequious devotion to ex-KGB officer Vladimir Putin. In his nasal tone, Roy would warn that Putin follows the Soviet playbook by interfering with elections in Western Europe; invading sovereign nations such as Ukraine; and assassinating dissidents and journalists.\n\nI am intimately familiar with Roy Cohn\u2019s views. Over nearly a decade, starting as a college student, I interviewed my cousin about his chaotic personal life and his deceitful deals as a prosecutor and power broker. I also shadowed him for a magazine story, in what turned out to be his final year.\n\nIn our conversations, Roy halfheartedly justified his ethics in cheating on his taxes, changing a dying man\u2019s will and defending mob figures including Anthony \u201cFat Tony\u201d Salerno. But whenever the subject of Russia arose, Roy was unequivocal: The \u201cevil empire\u201d would stop at nothing to undermine Washington and its allies. He railed about Americans becoming \u201ccomplacent, even stupid\u201d as the Cold War ended.\n\nFor most Americans, the Army-McCarthy hearings\u2014the televised congressional spectacle in which Roy served as chief counsel to Senator McCarthy\u2014exposed Roy\u2019s absurd witch hunt for \u201creds\u201d in the military. Roy, though, had a different perspective. When I asked about those humiliating hearings 25 years later, he boasted that by exposing alleged communists in the government (many of them closeted gay people), he had staved off the \u201cMarxist-Leninist-Stalinist menace.\u201d\n\nRoy also was unapologetic about the 1951 spy trial that divided the country. He had no misgivings about his private discussion with a judge\u2014illegally\u2014to ensure that Ethel Rosenberg was put to death in the electric chair along with her husband Julius. But, I pressed him, what about historians who say that Ethel, a mother of two, was innocent? \u201cEthel was a ringleader for the Soviets,\u201d Roy shot back.\n\nEvidence later indicated that Roy wasn\u2019t entirely wrong about the Rosenbergs: The U.S. had learned about the espionage by cracking Soviet spy codes. But Roy remained utterly untroubled about his role in perverting the judicial process. And what would Roy \u201cDeath to Traitors\u201d Cohn say today about Trump sharing classified information with the Russian foreign minister and the Russian ambassador?\n\nRoy died of complications of AIDS in 1986, five years before the Soviet Union\u2019s official demise. I believe even Roy would have been less hostile to Russia during the brief honeymoon of glasnost reforms. But I have little doubt he would see Putin\u2019s regime as the American nemesis.\n\nWith his innuendo and accusations, Roy was tweeting conspiracy theories long before Twitter. I can imagine him blasting Trump for cozying up to Putin. I think he would have unleashed hashtag-filled invective about Trump ignoring his own intelligence agencies on the threat of Russian covert activities in the U.S. He would\u2019ve started a tweet-blizzard when Trump urged the Group of Seven industrialized nations to readmit Russia.\n\nRoy might have forgiven Trump for laughing off Putin\u2019s transparent lies about meddling in our 2016 election\u2014after all, Trump won. But Roy would be horrified at the president praising Putin as a \u201cterrific person\u201d and \u201cstrong leader.\u201d And as much as he enjoyed applying leverage to get something he wanted, Roy would have likely denounced Trump for withholding military aid from a country that had been invaded by Russia just to score political dirt on an opponent.\n\nAlthough he has been dead for a third of a century, Roy is resurrected. This month, two documentaries about him are out. One is \u201cBully. Coward. Victim: The Story of Roy Cohn,\u201d by Ivy Meeropol, granddaughter of the Rosenbergs. She shows Roy besmirching gay State Department officials as \u201cperverts\u201d susceptible to espionage. The other film, \u201cWhere\u2019s My Roy Cohn?,\u201d includes footage of Roy denouncing the Communist Party in the 1950s in terms that he\u2019d surely use about Russia today: \u201cIts object is the overthrow of the government of the United States.\u201d\n\nRoy\u2019s remains rest in our family mausoleum, behind a simple epitaph: \u201cLAWYER AND PATRIOT.\u201d That\u2019s a double lie. He was disbarred in his last days. And during his 59 years, he desecrated Congress, the courts and other American institutions.\n\nLately, I find myself wishing my cousin was around to become a true patriot\u2014by exposing the perils of our president\u2019s infatuation with an old KGB colonel. When it comes to Russia, Donald Trump might not like the answer to his question: \u201cWhere\u2019s my Roy Cohn?\u201d", "description": "As dangerous as Cohn was to American institutions, he never wavered in defending the U.S. against the \u2018evil empire.\u2019", "authors": ["Michael Kruse", "Matthew Karnitschnig", "David L.
