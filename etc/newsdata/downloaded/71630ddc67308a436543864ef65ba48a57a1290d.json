No quid pro quo here, move along.\n\nBrit Hume started to pick apart the piece by pointing out a bit that was pure speculation:\n\nAnd this is also pure opinion: \u201c\u2026.discussion with Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia shows the extent to which Mr. Trump sees the attorney general as a critical partner to\u2026 show that the Mueller investigation had corrupt and partisan origins.\u201d https://t.co/4ssBSs8GNF \u2014 Brit Hume (@brithume) September 30, 2019\n\nAlso note \u2014 @realDonaldTrump said this to reporters in May-the AG \u201cis going to look at a lot of documents\u2026& I hope he looks at the UK, & I hope he looks at Australia, &I hope he looks at Ukraine. I hope he looks at everything, b/c there was a hoax perpetrated on our country\u201d https://t.co/7pmfwfBIeY \u2014 Bret Baier (@BretBaier) September 30, 2019\n\nNot sure how the New York Times considers that breaking news if Trump told them back in May he was going to do it.\n\nGood recall. Of course a serious investigation into the #SteeleDossier is going to involve Australia. Sheesh. These breathless hot takes from folks who apparently don\u2019t know that there is a significant investigation into dossier, FISA abuse, compromise of FBI/IC standards. https://t.co/Tw405QsxmH \u2014 Hugh Hewitt (@hughhewitt) September 30, 2019\n\nThey knew but they are in full panic mode now. Fasten seatbelts bumpy ride ahead. \u2014 James Roberts (@JamesRoberta7) September 30, 2019\n\nEveryone should have known the swamp dwellers would not go quietly. This is playing out like an episode of Designated Survivor. It\u2019s only going to get worse. They can\u2019t afford to wait till Election Day to \ud83d\uded1 Trump. Their lies will be exposed by then. \u2014 BrianMH (@blocks_learning) September 30, 2019\n\nYour damn right Trump should be investigating those countries there was a major coup attempt and he has every right and quite frankly obligation to find out what happened\u2026. \u2014 Bart Rule (@bartrulez) September 30, 2019\n\nSuddenly Democrats find the word investigation dirty when it comes to looking under the hood of their clown car.. \u2014 Bird Nerd \ud83e\udd86\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83e\udd86\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@rescuemomoffive) September 30, 2019\n\nThe NYT article makes me want to vote for Trump in 2020 simply because he is the rare politician who actually does what he said he would do. \u2014 PCH Political (@pchpolitical) September 30, 2019\n\nAnd the president was and is right. There\u2019s been a slow simmering Cabal headed towards hijacking our democracy. Perhaps the president is right that evil and good will clash ultimately if this goes any further \u2014 SMMB56 (@SMB56) September 30, 2019\n\nSince when is the sitting president not allowed to look into a coup attempt perpetrated by elements of our own CIA, FBI, and State Department on his campaign and presidency? The president does not have LESS rights than any other American. \u2014 Willow (@Willowinski) September 30, 2019\n\nComey said they couldn\u2019t verify the dossier so if it was used(it was)to start the surveillance of Team Trump don\u2019t we deserve to know where the false info came from? \u2014 Tim Towner (@towner_tim) September 30, 2019\n\n60M+ are wondering the same thing. \u2014 daniel mceleney (@DMceleney) September 30, 2019\n\nAnd we should investigate. Didn\u2019t we investigate Trump/Russian meddling for 3 years? \u2014 PoorRichard (@PoorRic78938881) September 30, 2019\n\nWow Bret, that is a bombshell report! So the President ordered a corruption probe back in May. Dems won't like this. \u2014 ac (@accampbell2) September 30, 2019\n\nRelated:", "description": "\"Of course a serious investigation into the Steele dossier is going to involve Australia.\"", "authors": ["Brett T.", "Posted At Pm On September"], "top_image": "https://twitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/BritHume.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
