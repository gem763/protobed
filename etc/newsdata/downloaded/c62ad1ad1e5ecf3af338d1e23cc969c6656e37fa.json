(Photo: Motherhood Maternity)\n\nBeing pregnant during Halloween is probably the most exciting time to be carrying a little bundle of joy. Yes, because you're bringing life into this world, but also because your baby bump can be used as a prop for the festive holiday.\n\nThere are plenty of ways your bump can serve as a darn good accessory. If your child is going to make you go through nine months of pregnancy and childbirth, you may as well have a little fun with it, right?\n\nHere are just a few ways you can dress up when you're pregnant.\n\nPumpkin\n\nThis one is obvious. Halloween, pumpkins, a round bump\u2014it just makes sense. Make it yourself by decorating an orange shirt. Or you can purchase one.\n\nSkeleton with a baby skeleton\n\nYou can still be spooky while pregnant. If you're all about the DIY, dress up in all black and outline the skeletal anatomy in white. When it comes to your belly, draw a baby skeleton, of course. You can also just buy one too.\n\nMother Earth\n\nI mean, you are giving birth to an important being so you're basically Mother Earth already. Grab a long white cloth and wrap it around yourself so that your belly peeks out, then paint (or have someone else do it) your bump blue and green so it looks like a globe.\n\nBasketball net\n\nWe're telling you, the bump can be used for anything at this point. Decorate your belly so that it looks like a bright orange basketball. Then grab a crop top and hang netting similar to a basketball net on the bottom of it and let it hang over your belly (basketball).\n\nIf you have a Halloween partner in crime, make them dress up as their favorite ball player.\n\nGumball machine\n\nGrab a white top and red bottoms and cover your belly in colorful poof balls. For a cute partner costume, have your person dress up as a quarter.\n\nAvocado\n\nBefore dressing up as an avocado, be forewarned that you may suddenly have millennials following you around with a hunger in their eyes.\n\nTo pull off the avocado look, just wear an all brown outfit and make a cardboard or styrofoam cut-out of an avocado, but instead of coloring in the pit, make a whole instead. Place the avocado around your neck like a sandwich board and make sure your brown belly peeks out from the hole.\n\nMiley Cyrus' wrecking ball\n\nYour baby's about to come into your life like a wrecking ball pretty soon, so may as well dress them up like one now.\n\nWear all black, cut out a circular patch of grey or metallic cloth that's the size of your belly and stick it on your bump. Then get a silver chain and attach it to the grey ball. Make sure you get a barbie doll dressed in a white tank (like Miley in the \"Wrecking Ball\" music video) and get it to intertwine with the chain too.\n\nBaseball player\n\nThis is a unique take on dressing up like a baseball player. Wear your favorite MLB player's outfit, but when it comes to your belly, decorate it so it looks like an actual baseball.\n\nPrego pasta sauce\n\nGet it? For this one, just wear all red (or you can simplify it by wearing a red top) and decorate it with your favorite sauce ingredients: green pepper, tomato, mushrooms, etc. Then just write the words \"Prego\" across your shirt and you're done.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/parenting/2019/10/17/pregnant-halloween-costumes-funny-cute-ideas-dress-bump-maternity/3944813002/", "description": "Being pregnant makes Halloween all the more fun because now you get to use your baby bump as an accessory for your costume.", "authors": ["Rasha Ali", "Published A.M.
