To mark the month, we\u2019re sharing stories of breast cancer journeys.\n\nHanna Thompson and Metta Siebert are 35-year-old identical twins who attended college together and now talk daily, even though they live thousands of miles apart.\n\nEarlier this year, the sisters were each diagnosed with breast cancer. Their diagnoses came within just weeks of each other.\n\n\u201cIt was a one-two punch to say the least,\u201d Siebert told \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cI remember it was a Friday night [when I heard] and I was in my kitchen and I just kind of slumped on the floor and stayed there for 30 minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou only have so much in your mental reservoir and that day it got pretty depleted,\u201d she said.\n\nSiebert, a nurse practitioner in Kansas, was diagnosed first, in June. She felt a lump on her left breast while she was in the shower and went to the doctor.\n\n\u201cThe entire process from feeling the lump to starting chemotherapy was about one month,\u201d she said.\n\nSiebert\u2019s diagnosis got Thompson, an attorney in California, thinking more about a lump she felt in her right breast while breastfeeding her now-15-month-old son prior to Metta\u2019s diagnosis.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a clogged duct and wasn\u2019t too concerned, but after Metta was diagnosed I saw my doctor and they sent me to get a mammogram and then a biopsy on the same day,\u201d she said. \u201cAbout a month later I had my first chemo.\u201d\n\nHanna Thompson\n\nBoth sisters have Stage 2A breast cancer. They are both currently undergoing chemotherapy, although different types.\n\nBoth sisters also plan to have a double mastectomy after finishing chemotherapy. They both found out after their diagnoses that they carry the BRCA2 gene, which greatly increases their risk of breast and ovarian cancers.\n\n\u201cNow with the BRCA2 gene [our diagnoses] make more sense but at the time it was very much surprising and debilitating,\u201d said Siebert, mother of a 5-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son.\n\nMetta Siebert\n\nSiebert's and Thompson's doctors both say the fact that they both got breast cancer is not unusual because they carry the BRCA2 gene. The sisters also have a family history of breast cancer.\n\nWhat is more unusual, though, is the fact that they were diagnosed so close together.\n\n\"It is quite extraordinary I think for them to be diagnosed within weeks of each other,\" said Dr. Michelle Melisko, an oncologist at the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, who is treating Thompson. \"But being identical twins, they share the BRCA gene and that gene is what\u2019s really responsible for them developing this pre-menopausal breast cancer.\"\n\nMetta Siebert\n\nSiebert's oncologist, Dr. Gregory Crane of the University of Kansas Cancer Center, also described the timing of the sisters' diagnoses as \"a bit atypical.\"\n\nHe, like Melisko, pointed out though that Thompson and Siebert followed a similar pattern for lots of families that have multiple people with cancer, where one person's diagnosis motivates other family members to get cancer screenings.\n\n\"I\u2019ve treated moms and daughters with breast cancer, usually where a mom is diagnosed and then a daughter goes and gets screened and is diagnosed,\" Crane said.\n\nSiebert and Thompson said their already-close bond was forged even stronger by cancer. Though they texted daily before breast cancer, they now talk and text multiple times a day to share support and tips on everything from treatment plans to the best techniques to use to shave their heads.\n\nMetta Siebert\n\n\"We\u2019re talking all the time,\" said Thompson. \"Metta is being hit hard by her chemo so I\u2019m there to discuss it and offer options from my doctors and just commiserate.\"\n\n\"I think that it just bonds you in a whole other way that you didn\u2019t think you were going to be bonded in or ever wanted to be bonded in,\" said Siebert. \"If there's one shimmer of light in this terribleness it\u2019s that at least I have my sister with me.\"\n\nThe sisters have started a GoFundMe account to help cover the costs of treatment and missed work, especially as they prepare for their double mastectomies ahead.\n\nSiebert and Thompson said they have learned that \"cancer does not discriminate,\" as they were both in great health and led healthy lives before their diagnoses. Thompson won a silver medal in fencing at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nMetta Siebert\n\nThey also want people to learn from their experience and get screened for the BRCA gene mutation if they have a strong family history of breast cancer.\n\n\"It can save your life,\" said Siebert.\n\nThis report was originally published on Aug. 7, 2019.", "description": "\u201cIt was a one two punch to say the least.\u201d", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/sisters-01-as-ht-190806_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
