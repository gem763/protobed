So resist the temptation to play pointless power games with those around you.\n\nTAURUS April 21-May 21 **\n\nAvoid being too black and white about issues today! There are many shades of grey at the moment, as you negotiate and navigate your way through a changing personal or professional landscape.\n\nGEMINI May 22-June 21 ***\n\nWork, wellbeing, exercise, pets, health and helping others are all favoured today. But avoid being impulsive about a friendship issue that will take plenty of time, tact and patience to resolve.\n\nCANCER June 22-July 23 ***\n\nToday\u2019s planetary patterns favour friendships, romance, sport, hobbies and serious conversations. But \u2013 with Saturn and Pluto activating your relationship zone - it won\u2019t all be smooth sailing!\n\nLEO July 24-Aug 23 **\n\nBeing a bossy Lion \u2013 or a demanding Diva - will get you nowhere fast today. In order for your relationships to blossom, you need to give others plenty of personal space and room to shine.\n\nVIRGO Aug 24-Sep 23 ***\n\nCompanionship and conversation are highlighted, as you reminisce with loved ones about the good times. You\u2019re also in the mood to watch a movie, listen to music or visit an art gallery.\n\nLIBRA Sep 24-Oct 23 ***\n\nExpect a good day, especially if you plan carefully. If you network, are flexible, and don\u2019t assume you have all the answers, then pleasant and productive relations with others will follow.\n\nSCORPIO Oct 24-Nov 22 **\n\nToday\u2019s Sun/Pluto square boosts your temperamental streak and your Scorpio control-freak tendencies. You\u2019ll find the more stubborn you are, the more challenging the day will be.\n\nSAGITTARIUS Nov 23-Dec 21 ***\n\nDon\u2019t give in to the urge to splurge. The more disciplined you are with cash and credit, the better. Many Sagittarians are in the mood to research their ancestors and draw up their family tree.\n\nCAPRICORN Dec 22-Jan 20 **\n\nThere is the potential for compulsive behaviour and power struggles today, especially with authority figures or work colleagues. So strive to be less demanding and much more consultative.\n\nAQUARIUS Jan 21-Feb 19 **\n\nWhen it comes to a personal issue or a family matter, you may have to ask some hard questions and take a firm stand. You won\u2019t get far if you just escape into your own private world.\n\nPISCES Feb 20-March 20 **\n\nGroup activities or joint finances look problematic, as someone tries to take over. Your natural inclination is to procrastinate but, the more passive you are, the more stressful the day will be.\n\nYOUR DAY\n\nThe Sun/Pluto square makes for a very intense day.\n\nHAPPY BIRTHDAY\n\nExpect some challenges over the coming year. If you approach them in a measured and composed way, then you\u2019ll eventually taste success.\n\nCopyright Joanne Madeline Moore 2019", "description": "See what the stars have in store for you today.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/5994/df6bb52e44bc40dba6882a84c920b792.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
