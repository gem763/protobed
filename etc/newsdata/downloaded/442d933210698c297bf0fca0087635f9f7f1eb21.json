An open letter is calling for the council to acknowledge Gandhi\u2019s \u201cvile comments\u201d and reverse the decision, which it says is an \u201cinsult\u201d to Manchester\u2019s black and Kashmiri communities.\n\nThe statue was given as a gift by a charitable organisation, the Shrimad Rajchandra Mission Dharampur, which cited the \u201cnon-violence and compassion\u201d on show in the city after the Manchester Arena terrorist attack in 2017. It was paid for by the Manchester-based Kamani family, the founders of the fashion retailer Boohoo.\n\nThe letter, organised by the Decolonise Network at the University of Manchester, says Gandhi referred to Africans as being \u201csavages\u201d, \u201chalf-heathen natives\u201d, \u201cuncivilised\u201d, \u201cdirty\u201d and \u201clike animals\u201d.\n\nA book published in 2015 by two university professors painted a complicated picture of the Indian freedom fighter, highlighting derogatory comments about black Africans and efforts to prove to British colonial rulers that South Africa\u2019s Indian community was superior to black Africans while living in the country.\n\nOne of the organisers of the letter, Sara Khan, said the group felt the need to raise awareness of Gandhi\u2019s comments as soon as they heard about proposals for the statue two weeks ago, \u201cgiven that it is October \u2013 Black History Month\u201d.\n\nAlthough a statue of the anti-colonial activist might seem a more surprising target than those of Horatio Nelson or Cecil Rhodes, Khan said \u201canti-black racism\u201d in south Asian communities was not addressed often enough.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a tendency to homogenise people of colour and our communities,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a function of colonial ideology \u2013 it\u2019s just as important to talk about it when it is people of colour who reproduce racist ideas as when they come from white people.\u201d\n\nShrimad Rajchandra Mission Dharampur said the campaign \u201cappears to diminish Gandhi\u2019s rich and complex history and his principles of tolerance, peace and unity\u201d.\n\nThe organisation cited Gandhi as an inspiration to African leaders such as Nelson Mandela and the civil rights movement, including Martin Luther King. \u201cWhile we welcome a searching public discussion of the past, it is misleading to fixate on comments made in Gandhi\u2019s early life as a lawyer under British colonial influence,\u201d it said.\n\nIn response to the charity\u2019s assertion that it was \u201cnon-political\u201d and not aligned with any national government, Khan said the idea that Gandhi was a \u201cspiritual figure\u201d who transcends politics \u201cis something we should reject\u201d.\n\nShe also rejected accusations that movements targeting statues were attempting to rewrite history, saying: \u201cThere\u2019s no rewriting at play here, it\u2019s more about centring a narrative that isn\u2019t spoken about.\u201d\n\nThe English literature student, who is her university\u2019s liberation and access officer, said the reaction to the campaign had been \u201cintense from both sides\u201d. While she had received support including from the NUS black students\u2019 campaign, Manchester University\u2019s Indian society has released a statement endorsing the statue. She said she had also faced Islamophobic abuse online since the campaign was reported in the media, but added: \u201cWe feel very strongly that we don\u2019t want to the statue to be erected.\u201d\n\nThe letter also references the #GandhiMustFall campaign, which successfully halted the erection of a Gandhi statue in Malawi. A statue was also removed by the University of Ghana in Accra after protests from students and faculty members, who argue the Indian independence leader considered Africans \u201cinferior\u201d. Gandhi\u2019s views on India\u2019s caste system have also been the subject of fierce debate.\n\nIts final demand to the council is to consider erecting a statue instead to a black anti-racist activist with connections to Manchester, such as the feminist Olive Morris or anti-apartheid campaigner Steve Biko.\n\nA spokesperson for Manchester city council, which did not receive any objections during the planning process, said that while they were aware of \u201csome debate about Gandhi\u2019s life, most people in the city will see the statue in the context in which it was intended \u2013 to spread a message of peace, love and harmony\u201d.\n\nProf Meena Dhanda from the University of Wolverhampton said it was unsurprising that \u201cthe more people have begun reading Gandhi rather than merely idolising him, the more they are finding out about his racism\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cAs scholars have shown, he was terrified of intermixing, he upheld caste rules that restricted marriage outside one\u2019s caste. He stereotyped people, for instance, he wrote \u2013 \u2018Mussalman as a rule is a bully and a Hindu a coward\u2019 and \u2018Kaffirs are as a rule uncivilised\u2019.\n\n\u201cDespite his political actions harnessing the force of \u2018non-violence\u2019, his underlying metaphysical views were deeply at odds with modern sensibilities. To use him as an apostle of peace whilst ignoring the very beliefs that cause ruptures within modern diverse communities is ill-advised.\u201d", "description": "Students say remarks by Indian freedom fighter mean proposed sculpture would be an \u2018insult\u2019", "authors": ["Maya Wolfe-Robinson", "Ian Jack"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a021dfbf126d0306454a0ac85345a52a729652eb/0_502_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ac6dee9d1984fd9db6e35e0e59139f10", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
