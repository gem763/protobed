These are strange times for democracy,\u201d Corbyn told BBC television.\n\nAn opinion poll on voting intentions, carried out by Survation for the Daily Mail, put the Conservatives on 29%, down 2% from the previous poll, with Labour unchanged on 24%. The pro-EU Liberal Democrats were on 18% and the Brexit Party 17%.\n\nDavid Lidington, who was deputy prime minister under May, said that obeying the rule of law was a fundamental principle of the ministerial code. \u201cDefying any particular law sets a really really dangerous precedent,\u201d he told BBC radio.\n\nLidington resigned just before Johnson took office.\n\nJohnson says the only solution to the Brexit deadlock is a new election, which he wants to take place on Oct. 15 and could give him a new mandate to quit the EU on schedule.\n\nTwo-thirds of parliament\u2019s lawmakers need to back an early election, but opposition parties, including Labour, said they would either vote against or abstain on this until the law to force Johnson to seek a Brexit delay is implemented.\n\n\u201cWe need a clear statement from the prime minister that he is going to abide by that act of parliament,\u201d Corbyn said.\n\nJohnson failed to win enough support in a vote on Wednesday for an election. Another vote is scheduled for Monday.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A pro-Brexit supporter protests between European Union flags outside the Houses of Parliament in London, Britain, September 5, 2019.
