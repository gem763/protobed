This is a successor tot he Google Wifi product it introduced a couple of years ago, but with a number of improvements. The new Nest Wifi consists of two types of devices, one a router that plugs into your modem, and one \u2018point\u2019 amplifies the signal and extends the network, and it\u2019s more powerful so you only need these two things.\n\nIt\u2019s available to pre-order, and will ship on November 4. It comes in a 2-pack or a 3-pack variant, for $249 or $349 respectively, and will be available in eight countries at launch.\n\nGoogle says that Nest Wifi offers 2x better speed than Google Wifi, with up to 25% better coverage. That\u2019s from the two-piece system, which Google says is probably enough to cover the same space as the three-puck Google Wifi original system.\n\nThe hardware is designed to be placed out in the open \u2013 Google paid attention to design here to make sure it looks good enough to keep it where it\u2019ll work best to provide signal. And the \u2018point\u2019 has a built-in speaker and microphone array, with onboard Google Assistant support, making it double as a smart speaker \u2013 which really does add to the overall value in terms of what you\u2019re getting for the money.\n\nLike Google Wifi, it offers simple set-up, parental and guest controls, as well as \u201cseamless setup\u201d for smart home devices rom within the Google Home app.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, Google said that Google Wifi has been the top-selling mesh Wifi system in both the U.S. and Canada since its launch, so it\u2019s clearly seeing a lot of success in this category. The company was also quick to point out that it has provided 15 updates to the original hardware since its launch, adding new features and improving performance, so expect a similar slew of post-purchase updates for Nest Wifi, too.", "description": "Today at its Google hardware event, Google introduced new mesh routers called Nest Wifi.
