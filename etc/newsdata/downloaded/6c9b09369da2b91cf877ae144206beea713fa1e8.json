REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo\n\nThe company will start mass production of U.S. component-free 5G base stations next month, founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei told a forum on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe carried out the testing in August and September, and from October on we will start scale production,\u201d Ren said, adding that initially it would begin making 5,000 U.S. component-free 5G base stations a month.\n\nAnnual production next year is expected to hit 1.5 million units, compared with 600,000 estimated for this year which includes those made with U.S. components and those without.\n\nThe world\u2019s largest telecoms gear maker has been on a U.S. trade blacklist since May over concerns its equipment could be used by Beijing to spy. Huawei has repeatedly denied such allegations but has taken steps to minimize the impact.\n\nThe sanctions have resulted in the loss of access to key technologies and the latest version of its Mate 30 flagship phone, for example, will not come with Google Mobile Services.\n\nWill Zhang, Huawei\u2019s president of corporate strategy, told Reuters the performance of the U.S.-free base stations was \u201cno worse\u201d and the company \u201chas had positive surprises\u201d. He declined to give details.\n\nRen said Huawei would still like to use U.S. components if possible because the company has \u201cemotional ties\u201d with long-time U.S. suppliers.\n\nRen said this month he is open to selling the firm\u2019s 5G technology - including patents, code, blueprints and production know-how - to Western firms for a one-off fee.\n\nOn Thursday he went further, saying Huawei was willing to license its 5G mobile technology to a U.S. company, and that he was not afraid of creating a rival by making Huawei\u2019s technology available to competitors.\n\nThe offer could also include chip design know-how, he added.\n\nHuawei, also the world\u2019s No.2 smartphone vendor, has said the U.S. ban could push its smartphone unit\u2019s revenue lower by about $10 billion this year.", "description": "Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] said it has started making 5G base stations without U.S. components and that total production of 5G base stations should more than double next year as more countries introduce the technology.", "authors": ["Sijia Jiang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1434103857&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P0SI", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
