And it bucked views by top officials that the Turks\u2019 threat of an incursion against the Kurds was a bluff, according to current and former defense officials and people familiar with the U.S. government\u2019s efforts to forestall a new Turkish military operation.\n\n\"Everyone was absolutely flabbergasted by this. I tell you that as a fact,\" retired Adm. James Stavridis said Monday on MSNBC, describing what he saw as the view from the Pentagon. \"Nobody saw it coming, and that is a real problem when you're trying to conduct not only foreign policy ... but also military operations. That kind of whipsawing effect is extremely detrimental, not only in this tactical situation, but strategically as our planners try and prepare in other theaters, from North Korea to Afghanistan.\"\n\n\u201cPOTUS went rogue,\" said a person familiar with the U.S. government\u2019s policy deliberations on the issue.\n\nA person familiar with the U.S. government\u2019s policy deliberations on the issue said Trump is operating against the advice of his national security leaders \u2014 noting that Sunday night's announcement came just three days after Defense Secretary Mark Esper spoke by phone with Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar.\n\n\u201cPOTUS went rogue,\" the person said. \"It\u2019s not too surprising for those of us who\u2019ve been following him, but it was a surprise and went against what Esper was talking to Akar about.\u201d\n\nLast week, the Pentagon and Special Representative for Syria Engagement James Jeffrey, the State Department\u2019s point man for the country, believed they had a system in place \u2014 a safe zone and program of joint patrols known as the \u201csecurity mechanism\u201d \u2060\u2014 to prevent the Turks\u2019 long-threatened incursion against the Syrian Democratic Forces. Turkey views the U.S.-backed paramilitary group as a terrorist organization, since many of its members are part of Kurdish guerrilla groups that have fought the Turkish government.\n\nOn the phone call, Esper told reporters Friday, he and Akar agreed that the safe zone system was the best approach to securing the Turkish-Syrian border. \u201cI made very clear to him, and he agreed as well, that we need to make the security mechanism work,\u201d Esper said. \u201cWe have air patrols going on, we had another ground patrol just happen. \u2026 I just told him, let's keep working at it. That's the best path forward for all of us, so that's what I'm focused on right now.\u201d\n\nAs of Saturday, Pentagon officials were still taking Esper's safe-zone comments as their guidance. \u201cIndicators of Turkish military movements were pretty sparse \u2014 although folks were getting a little antsy about it,\" a Defense official said. \"Obviously, things have changed over the past 24 hours.\u201d\n\nIn a statement Monday, Pentagon spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman said that \u201cthe Department of Defense made clear to Turkey \u2060\u2014 as did the President \u2060\u2014 that we do not endorse a Turkish operation in Northern Syria\u201d and will not be involved in it.\n\n\u201cSecretary Esper and Chairman [Mark] Milley reiterated to their respective Turkish counterparts that unilateral action creates risks for Turkey,\u201d Hoffman added.\n\nJack Keane, a retired Army general who has advised Trump on national security issues, said he didn't believe Trump meant to endorse the Turkish move, and that on the phone call yesterday, as he understands it, Erdo\u011fan told Trump that Turkey had no other option but military action \u2014 ignoring the safe zone system that has been getting underway.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the U.S. decision is endorsing Turkish military action by getting out of the way,\u201d Keane said. \u201cWhen Erdo\u011fan brought up the Syrian issue on the phone call, I understand he presented it as if [Erdo\u011fan] had no other choice, which is surprising given that negotiations were ongoing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a pathway to a diplomatic solution, and I sense as the Turks look at this clear-eyed, there may be enough motivation to get us back on the pathway\u201d \u2014 Jack Keane, a retired Army general\n\nYet whether the U.S. endorses Turkish military action or is merely stepping out of the way will make little difference to the Syrian Kurdish troops who suffered thousands of casualties driving ISIS out of Syrian strongholds, said another defense official, who was not authorized to speak on the record about the situation. \u201cI don\u2019t see a difference. And more importantly, the Kurds don\u2019t either,\u201d the second official said.\n\nThe announcement Sunday night also surprised the State Department\u2019s special representative for Syria, Jim Jeffrey, and his aides, according to the person familiar with the U.S. government's deliberations. Last week, Jeffrey and his aides \u201cthought Turkey was bluffing, that the bluff was for domestic audiences, and that they could make the safe zone work,\u201d the person said. \u201cThere was talk about how to manage Turkey, albeit without giving them a permanent presence,\u201d including by informing Turkey that even after U.S. troops eventually left, U.S. aircraft would still patrol the region.\n\nThose plans appear to be out the window after the Trump-Erdogan call, the person said.\n\nBut Keane suggested they might be salvaged as the Turkish military realizes the difficulties of fighting against the Syrian Democratic Forces \u2060\u2014 especially if those forces, lacking U.S. air support, instead turn to the Assad regime for protection.\n\n\u201cThere was a pathway to a diplomatic solution, and I sense as the Turks look at this clear-eyed, there may be enough motivation to get us back on the pathway,\u201d Keane said.\n\nQuint Forgey contributed to this report.", "description": "The decision defies the current thinking of the US president\u2019s national security leaders.", "authors": ["Wesley Morgan", "Quint Forgey", "David Cohen"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1173686774-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
