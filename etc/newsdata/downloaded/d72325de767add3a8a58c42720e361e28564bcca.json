President Harry S. Truman attended the premiere. (Oscar L. Chapman Papers/Harry S. Truman Library and Museum)\n\nColumnist\n\nBack in the late 1940s and early 1950s, outdoor historical dramas were popular. There was \u201cThe Lost Colony\u201d in North Carolina and \u201cThe Common Glory\u201d in Williamsburg. I have fragmentary memories of maybe having seen one in Rock Creek Park in the early \u201950s. Is that possible?\n\n\u2014 Mac Coinich, Annandale\n\nIn the summer of 1950, Washingtonians were excited about a new 4,000-seat performance space set to open. Its name: the Sesquicentennial Amphitheater, \u201cSesqui\u201d for short.\n\nDoesn\u2019t really roll off the tongue, does it? You probably know it by a different name: Carter Barron Amphitheatre. It was Carter T. Barron, the Washington representative of the Loews Theater chain, who spearheaded construction of the outdoor venue.\n\nBarron was executive vice chairman of the National Capital Sesquicentennial Commission, formed to commemorate the 150th anniversary of the establishment of Washington as the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nMany ideas were proposed to celebrate Washington\u2019s sesquicentennial, but the only one to get off the ground \u2014 or on the ground \u2014 was the amphitheater constructed in a natural bowl in Rock Creek Park near 16th Street NW and Colorado Avenue. Playwright Paul Green (1894-1981) was commissioned to create a piece christening it.\n\n\n\nThe souvenir program for the 1951 production of \u201cFaith of Our Fathers.\u201d (Historical Society of Washington)\n\nGreen \u201creally was on the cutting edge of all kind of things. And he was terribly bold,\u201d said John Roper, author of the 2003 biography \u201cPaul Green, Playwright of the Real South.\u201d\n\nA white North Carolinian, Green was a devoted integrationist, the perfect choice for a theater that, because it was on federal land, was required to be integrated. His Pulitzer Prize-winning 1927 play \u201cIn Abraham\u2019s Bosom\u201d is about an African American field worker eager to open a school for black children.\n\nGreen had spent time in Europe and collaborated with Kurt Weill and Lotte Lenya. He\u2019d made good money in movies, too, penning the screenplay for 1932\u2019s \u201cThe Cabin in the Cotton,\u201d in which Bette Davis delivers the immortal line \u201cI\u2019d like to kiss you, but I just washed my hair.\u201d\n\nBut Green had tired of Broadway and Hollywood and was eager to find a new way to connect with audiences. His idea: a genre he called \u201csymphonic drama.\u201d These would be large productions that explored and celebrated aspects of U.S. history and were mounted in the very places where that history took place.\n\n\u201cThe Lost Colony\u201d debuted in Manteo, N.C., in 1937 and continues to this day, only ceasing operations during World War II when it was feared the theater lights might attract German submarines. \u201cThe Common Glory\u201d in Williamsburg opened in 1947 and ran for 30 years.\n\n\n\nAn additional image from opening night. (Oscar L. Chapman Papers/Harry S. Truman Library and Museum)\n\nFor Washington the city, Green chose as his subject Washington the man. The show was called \u201cFaith of Our Fathers\u201d \u2014 or \u201cFOOF,\u201d as newspaper headline writers quickly dubbed it \u2014 and it covered George Washington\u2019s public life from 1783 to 1798.\n\nMany in the cast and crew of 120 were taken from the theater departments of local universities. (Also in the show, as Pierre L\u2019Enfant, was Pernell Roberts, who later starred in \u201cBonanza\u201d and \u201cTrapper John, MD.\u201d)\n\nThe show opened on Aug. 4, 1950, with President Harry S. Truman in the audience. Brooks Atkinson of the New York Times was among those underwhelmed by Green\u2019s play. \u201cThe inspiration it seeks to convey is dissipated amid a clutter of quick, poster-like episodes and laborious changes of scenery,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe hometown crowd was just as critical. \u201cImpressive but disappointing\u201d was the verdict of The Washington Post\u2019s Richard L. Coe, who wrote: \u201cTo fill his huge stage, [Green\u2019s] scenes must be broad and heavy, the very qualities he at the same time is trying to tone down in his central figure.\u201d\n\nCoe did praise the lighting, by James Waring, and the music, especially the chorus led by Washington National Cathedral\u2019s Richard Dirksen.\n\nGreen was known to tinker with his creations and that was true of \u201cFaith of Our Fathers.\u201d When the play returned for its second season in 1951, the author promised \u201ca different attitude.\u201d He told Coe: \u201cWe have a new beginning and a new ending. The action now starts when Washington was 27 years old and carries him through 40 years until the laying of the Capitol cornerstone.\u201d\n\nGreen added more \u201cIndian ritual dances,\u201d choreographed by Myra Kinch, as well as scenes from the battle of Lexington and Washington\u2019s inauguration.\n\nThe space had a new name, too, in honor of Barron, who the previous November had died of a brain tumor at age 45.\n\nAlas, the changes didn\u2019t help. Ticket sales never achieved the desired level. Plus, residents near the amphitheater complained about the \u201cnoise and dust\u201d of the show. \u201cFaith of Our Fathers\u201d closed after its second season and never came back.\n\nBut over the ensuing decades, Carter Barron Amphitheatre did host all manner of entertainments. Deferred maintenance closed it in 2017. A National Park Service spokeswoman told Answer Man they\u2019re committed to reopening after design work for the rehabilitation is completed in 2020.\n\nTwitter: @johnkelly\n\nFor previous columns, visit washingtonpost.com/john-kelly.", "description": "Paul Green\u2019s \u201cFaith of Our Fathers\u201d was supposed to be the \u201cLost Colony\u201d of Washington.", "authors": ["John Kelly", "Local Columnist", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/CTu5xe5R-ji6BF_IFzYuAlvXkc4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GBRERKG36YI6TINFCYVYVHE4UI.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
