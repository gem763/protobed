It is hard not to be impressed with its job-creation capacity. Since the low point of the 2007-2009 Great Recession, payroll employment has increased by 21.7 million jobs, with strong growth under both President Barack Obama and President Trump.\n\nJust how much credit they deserve for the economy\u2019s recovery is unclear. An alternative explanation is that the underlying rhythms of the business cycle drove the expansion. It\u2019s an open question. Trump claims that but for the Federal Reserve\u2019s high interest rates, economic growth would be stronger. His critics respond that his chaotic \u201ctrade wars\u201d have weakened business confidence and corporate investment.\n\nHowever this argument is resolved \u2014 both points might be true, or neither \u2014 there are bigger issues. As the economist Joseph Schumpeter (1883-1950) asked years ago: Can capitalism survive? Can our system, whatever its label, achieve a better balance between economic growth and economic security? Can we get the benefits of \u201cdisruption\u201d without the social costs?\n\nThe conventional wisdom is that the economy has already become more disorderly. Old-style capitalism is on the upswing. Workers and managers are more exposed to disruptive change. But does the evidence corroborate conventional wisdom?\n\nConsider a new study by economist Joel A. Elvery of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, who examined how workers\u2019 occupations had altered from 1860 to 2015.\n\nHe placed all workers in one of 23 large occupational groupings (examples: farmers, laborers, engineers and managers) and then monitored what happened to the various groupings over time. The sharp decline of some occupational groups and the rise of others gauged the magnitude of economic disruption.\n\nSome changes, though familiar, were stunning. Farming (including fishing and forestry) dropped from 43 percent of employment in 1860 to 1 percent in 2015. In an interview, Elvery credited mechanization (tractors and the like), better seeds, more fertilizers and more irrigation for the shift. Over the same period, the number of non-farm laborers fell from about 10 percent of employment to about 4 percent. The bulldozer was a crucial cause, Elvery noted. \u201cOne bulldozer could do the work of 50 people,\u201d he said. The impact was enormous.\n\nThe study\u2019s overall conclusion, however, was surprising and counterintuitive. Americans have been conditioned to think that present economic disruptions are at, or near, historical highs. Markets are cruel, hardhearted and volatile; job insecurity is on the rise. But that\u2019s not what the study found. Instead, it concluded: \u201cAfter 100 years of dramatic change, the mix of occupations has been more stable since 1970.\u201d Occupational disruption is about half the level of the peak decades, the 1900s and the 1940s.\n\nIn theory, the stability of the occupational structure can be reconciled with rising economic insecurity. As Elvery pointed out, people can lose their jobs without switching occupations. For example: Unemployed journalists can \u2014 perhaps \u2014 find other journalism jobs, as opposed to becoming rocket scientists. But, again, this does not seem to be what\u2019s happening.\n\nA more likely possibility is that, in many different ways, the U.S. economy is becoming less dynamic. The most significant evidence of this is \u201cThe Rise and Fall of American Growth,\u201d by economist Robert J. Gordon of Northwestern University, an encyclopedic overview of technological change since the Civil War. Greatly simplified, Gordon\u2019s thesis is that the innovations up to 1970 (cars, airplanes, telephones, indoor plumbing, television, air conditioning, modern pharmaceuticals and more) dwarf the Internet as a source of rising living standards.\n\nOther indicators point in the same direction. The business start-up rate has declined. Workers are moving less frequently to find new jobs. Productivity growth (a.k.a. overall efficiency) has lagged. Large firms are returning sizable amounts of cash to their shareholders, arguably because they can\u2019t find attractive investment opportunities or, possibly, because they have become more risk-averse.\n\nThe relative stability of the occupational structure fits the pattern. What connects all these trends is an impulse to stay with what\u2019s familiar. Although this is understandable for individuals, the consequences for society as a whole may be less benign. The capacity to raise incomes is essential for political legitimacy because it increases private living standards and provides funds for government.\n\nWhen that capacity gets corroded, the result is a more contentious society as various groups compete for limited economic resources. But we are left with a paradox: People\u2019s feelings of insecurity have outrun actual instability. To restore dynamism, we may need more change. That is the long-term peril that should worry Americans on this Labor Day.\n\nRead more from Robert Samuelson\u2019s archive.", "description": "There is a long-term peril that Americans should worry about this Labor Day.", "authors": ["Robert J.
