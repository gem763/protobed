And it\u2019s easy to snark at them as indulgent divas. A bridezilla without a groom.\n\nAD\n\nOr you can see this as a feminist update of the moldy debutante tradition, when a girl entering womanhood is officially placed on the market. Here I am, world. This is who I\u2019ve become, at 30. And I don\u2019t need a wedding to wear tulle.\n\n\u201cAnd, really, how often do we take time to celebrate a woman\u2019s aging?\u201d said Iulia Gheorghiu, Gortaire\u2019s friend and chief of operations for this caper.\n\nOr maybe there are the women who want a do-over of how their parents commemorated it.\n\n\u201cWhatever your story, turning 30 offers the chance to do it all your way,\u201d said a story about the \u201cdoble quince\u201d trend in the Latina-focused digital publication Mit\u00fa. \u201cThe doble quince has become a popular way for Latinas to celebrate their heritage and their 30s in style.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBut you can also consider the women like Gortaire, who never had the traditional fete popular in Latino and Caribbean cultures celebrating a girl\u2019s entry into womanhood.\n\nAD\n\nIt had been only five years since Gortaire\u2019s family arrived from Ecuador and settled in Florida when she turned 15, and they were saving and struggling as new immigrants. So her 15th birthday was a simple family affair, her gift a silver cross. No florid swirls of taffeta, music and banquet spreads that many quincea\u00f1eras now feature.\n\nKaren Castro knows the feeling \u2014 she had it doubly bad. Her parents were also Ecuadoran immigrants. And growing up in Ohio, she saw more-established immigrant families throwing extravagant quincea\u00f1eras. She also watched the country club crowd throw Sweet 16 parties for their daughters. She turned 15, then 16, with little fanfare.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thinking that maybe I\u2019ll do this, too,\u201d said Karen, who is 29 and will turn 30 in February. She was a friend of Gortaire\u2019s in graduate school and now works for the U.S. State Department, having just returned from a long assignment in China. She\u2019s ready \u201cto have that party and sort of celebrate my life today. Why not?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThis makes the Double Quincea\u00f1era a third-culture tradition, the bridge that children of immigrants build between old-world culture and their lives as Americans today.\n\nIn Ecuador, they call a quincea\u00f1era a \u201cfiesta rosada,\u201d or \u201cpink party,\u201d because they are usually drenched in pink. But Gortaire cringed at the thought of a full-on Pepto-Bismol scenario.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI have a pink tulle skirt that I got online,\u201d she explained, in the final weeks of her 20s, when we met to talk about her party. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to wear it with these silvery boots and a jean jacket with pearl accents. I can\u2019t take it too far; that\u2019s not me. It has to be genuine.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, she made her grand entrance at a trendy beer garden, Hook Hall in the Parkview neighborhood of Northwest Washington. It had picnic tables and cornhole boards on AstroTurf, and the whole scene was aglow with crisscrossed strings of bistro lights.\n\nAD\n\nThey created a custom drink for this fiesta. \u201cYou get to drink at a double quincea\u00f1era!\u201d Gheorghiu reminded me, as she ticked off the reasons a woman turning 30 should take the time to celebrate her life. (The drink is called the \u201cFranny\u201d \u2014 elderflower, grapefruit juice, club soda and gin \u2014 and it\u2019s pink.)\n\nAD\n\nSome traditional quincea\u00f1eras have attendants in matching pastel dresses, bridesmaid-style, and guests in gowns and even tuxedos.\n\nGortaire\u2019s guests came in sequins, suits, jeans, gowns and leather, the best outfits they could summon to celebrate their slightly eccentric friend.\n\nAs her cousin\u2019s Latin-pop playlist boomed, Gortaire\u2019s diverse life unfurled around her. There was her improv group crowd, the female drum squad she performs with, colleagues from her event planning company, graduate school roomies and (human) friends from the dog park.\n\nAD\n\nThe evening officially began as everyone raised the glasses of pink Frannys and a friend in sequined pants crowned Gortaire with a tiara.\n\nAD\n\nShe joked that she may have to go to bed early after the party. \u201cI\u2019m 30 now, so I have to get up to go to the farmers market.\u201d\n\nAfter plenty of drinks and the cutting of a cake, she performed the traditional candle ceremony, handing a lit candle to the people who have been important in her life.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about celebrating who I\u2019ve become at 30, and the people who helped me get there,\u201d she said.\n\nShe had little speeches thanking the indispensable work colleague, the roommates, the neighbors who took care of her, the ride-or-die friends.\n\nThen she had a surprise for most of the people there \u2014 something that would make her unique event even more significant.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis next one is for me,\u201d she said, holding the final candle. \u201cSpecifically a part of myself that I always knew was in me, but I didn\u2019t quite recognize what it was,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nDeep breath.\n\n\u201cSo, to the queer little Francis within and amongst all of you, I want to recognize her and be proud of her and from this day forward, be proud and open about that part of my life and identity,\u201d she said.\n\nHer friends gasped and cheered, some got a little teary. Many of them had no idea Gortaire is queer.\n\nIt was a coming out, after all, of a fully realized woman. In a tiara.\n\nRead more Petula Dvorak:\n\nAD", "description": "Celebrating 30, with tulle, tiaras and a surprise announcement.", "authors": ["Petula Dvorak", "Local Columnist"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/rvGHShsQJ78R6aE63puJoqx1Nbo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AY74TBXVVQI6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
