It was later expanded after some political opponents overthrew him and took power in 1979. The couple were detained in Iran in July amid reports that they were flying a drone near Tehran without a permit. The woman is thought to be locked in Evin jail (pictured) In the 1980s dissidents and members of the People's Mujahidin of Iran were hanged there and even today the prison still operates a death row system. Most prisoners in the jail are high-profile long-term political opponents, and in some cases pawns to be used in bargains with other countries.

We just arrived. It's actually really beautiful.'\n\nThe video is no longer on the couple's YouTube channel and their fans had begun to worry about their long silence.\n\nThe arrests came amid heightened tensions between Iran, and Britain and Australia.\n\nMelbourne University Academic Kylie Moore-Gilbert, who specialises in Middle East politics with a focus on Gulf states, had been detained for 'some months' before King and Firkin were arrested.\n\nHer case also came to light last month.\n\nBut negotiations over the fate of the university lecturer, accused of 'spying for another country', are ongoing, Payne said.\n\n'She has been detained for some considerable time and has faced the Iranian legal system and has been convicted and sentenced,' the foreign minister said.\n\n'We don't accept the charges on which she was convicted and we would seek to have her returned to Australia,' Payne added, declining to comment further.\n\nNews of the arrests last month came after Canberra announced it would contribute a frigate and surveillance aircraft to a US-led mission to protect shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, with tensions high in the Gulf region.\n\nPayne has maintained the cases of those detained were not related to diplomatic tensions.\n\nNews of the release of King and Firkin comes just weeks after an Iranian woman arrested in Australia and sentenced in the United States was returned home.\n\nNegar Ghodskani was sentenced last month in Minneapolis to 27 months in prison for violating sanctions against Tehran but was released following time served in custody in Australia and the United States.\n\nAfter her extradition to the US, she confessed to participation in a conspiracy to illegally export technology to Iran in breach of sanctions, according to the US Justice Department.\n\nShe was pregnant when she was arrested in 2017 in Australia where she was a legal resident. She gave birth while in Australian custody and her son was sent to Iran to live with his father.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in April floated a potential prisoner swap with a British-Iranian mother being held in Tehran.\n\nHe suggested exchanging Ghodskani for Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, in jail in Tehran for alleged sedition.\n\nZaghari-Ratcliffe was also separated from her child while in custody.", "description": "Jolie King and her Australian boyfriend Mark Firkin were released from Evin prison in Tehran after all charges were dropped.
