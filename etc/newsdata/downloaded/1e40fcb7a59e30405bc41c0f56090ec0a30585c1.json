REUTERS/Henry Nicholls/File Photo\n\nSpeaking at his party\u2019s annual conference in Manchester a month before Britain is due to leave the EU, Javid said his department would prepare a comprehensive response, working with the Bank of England.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has split parliament, his party and the electorate by promising to deliver Brexit on Oct. 31, with or without a transition agreement - at the risk of triggering shortages of food, medicine and fuel.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve tasked the Treasury with preparing a comprehensive economic response to support the economy, working closely with the Bank of England,\u201d Javid said. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to draw on the full armory of economic policy if needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cDeal or no deal, we will be ready.\u201d\n\nTreasury officials said that response would need to be set out in a budget but declined to say when that budget would happen or what it might contain - to the chagrin of the CBI business lobby group.\n\n\u201cIt feels like there was a page missing from his speech. It was silent on how the Government and the Treasury would respond to the serious rupture caused by failing to secure a deal with the EU,\u201d said Carolyn Fairbairn, CBI director-general.\n\nBritain is not scheduled to hold an election until 2022, but most commentators expect one in the coming months. Johnson\u2019s Conservatives have lost their majority in parliament and divisions over Brexit are paralyzing policymaking.\n\nThe government wants an election, but its opponents in parliament have refused to endorse one until a \u2018no-deal\u2019 Brexit on Oct. 31 has been definitively ruled out.\n\nWith a campaign platform in mind, Javid tried to shift the focus to what he called \u201cthe people\u2019s priorities\u201d - issues that the party believes matter more to voters in the long run.\n\nEND LOW PAY\n\nHe said the government would aim to raise the so-called National Living Wage to two-thirds of median earnings - an international threshold below which workers are classed as low paid, and extend the same minimum wage to younger workers.\n\nJavid said this would make Britain one of the first countries to end low pay.\n\nIt would take minimum pay for those aged over 21 to 10.50 pounds ($12.93) an hour, based on current forecasts - up from a current 8.21 pounds, applicable to those aged at least 25.\n\nHe estimated the move would benefit 4 million people.\n\nThe British Chambers of Commerce, another business lobby, said the increase was a laudable ambition but must be done on the basis of economic evidence, and with time for businesses to adjust.\n\nJavid also committed 5 billion pounds to improving fast broadband access in harder-to-reach areas, announced a strategy to improve bus services, and set out how billions already set aside for road improvements will be spent.\n\nAfter nearly a decade of deficit-reducing spending cuts under Conservative-led governments, the recently appointed Javid, a 49-year-old free marketeer, has promised to rewrite the rules that define spending and borrowing limits.\n\nThe new framework is expected to allow higher levels of state-funded infrastructure investment.\n\n\u201cWe will be smart and responsible in the way we invest for the long term,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can do this by taking advantage of incredibly low interest rates and borrowing to build, not borrowing to waste.\u201d", "description": "Finance minister Sajid Javid pledged on Monday to prepare Britain for a no-deal Brexit, saying the \"full armory of economic policy\" would be on hand if needed.", "authors": ["William James", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190930&t=2&i=1435576131&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8S0W5", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
