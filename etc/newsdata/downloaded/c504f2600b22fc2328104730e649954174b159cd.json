Deepest condolences go out to the bereaved.\u201d\n\nGaylor Mulbah, who lives next door to the school, said he woke Wednesday morning to the noise of chaos.\n\n\u201cI came outside thinking there were armed robbers,\u201d he said, \u201cbut everything was blazing. People were running, screaming, calling for help.\u201d\n\n\n\nA man looks into a burned building after a fire swept through a school in a suburb of Monrovia, Liberia. (Reuters)\n\nMulbah, a teacher at another school, said he tried to get to the boys but the heat was too intense to go near the building. Steel security bars blocked the windows.\n\nMakeshift dwellings clogging the alleys around the school also caught fire, stalling rescuers. \u201cIt took two, three hours for the fire brigade to get in,\u201d Mulbah said.\n\nThe boys who attend the Quranic Islamic School are known in the neighborhood as quiet and respectful. They often stay up late reading prayers, Mulbah said.\n\nIt is unclear how many students lived in the dormitory, but authorities said few were able to escape the inferno.\n\nB. Abel Learwellie, executive director of Camp for Peace Liberia, a nonprofit organization in Paynesville City, said he cannot recall a disaster so deadly in the country of approximately 4.8 million since a landslide killed hundreds of miners nearly four decades ago.\n\n\u201cThe police are still searching for bodies,\u201d he said. \u201cWe pray the souls of these innocent children rest in peace.\u201d\n\nFires kill an estimated 250,000 people each year \u00adworldwide, with the majority of victims in low- and middle-\n\nincome countries, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nExperts say low-quality housing, aging infrastructure and a lack of funding for safety inspections heighten the risk.\n\nIsaac Solo Kelgbeh, press secretary for Weah, said the government has launched a probe into how the Paynesville City fire spread so quickly. Most homes in Liberia lack smoke detectors and fire extinguishers, he said \u2014 an issue officials want to fix.\n\n\n\nPeople carry a body before a funeral at the 17th Street Islamic Mosque in Monrovia, Liberia, on Wednesday.
