Susana Victoria Perez has more. Buzz60\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson is on a media tour to promote his new book, but every talk show he stopped by kicked off by addressing the elephant in the room \u2013 his sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nIn Tyson's appearance on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" on Monday, the late night host asked him what he learned about his experience being in the midst of his own #MeToo movement.\n\nIn 2018 two women, identified as working with Tyson or in his scientific field, accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior.\n\nTyson denied the allegations at the time, and after investigations concluded, the astrophysicist was able to keep his job at the New York's American Museum of Natural History.\n\nThe \"Cosmos\" host told Colbert about the importance of support he's been receiving.\n\n\"I learned that I had friends in times of need, and in a time of stress, that's what I learned from this year,\" Tyson said. \"As a scientist, I spend most of my time thinking objectively about the world, thinking a little less about emotion about feelings and when I needed it most, people were there for me: friends, family, fans.\"\n\nThe \"Star Talk\" host echoed the same sentiment on \"The View\" and \"CBS This Morning.\"\n\nCBS host Anthony Mason also asked Tyson what he learned from his year long experience.\n\n\"I learned to care about the support I\u2019ve received, from friends, family, a fan base that was there throughout the entire time and a lot of that fan base was sort of represented spiritually and emotionally and intellectually in this collection of letters where it's people sharing their deepest issues angst about the world,\" Tyson said referencing his new book \"Letters from an Astrophysicist.\" \"All I'm saying is in the past year I learned to value that more than ever before.\"\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson stops by talk shows to promote new book and discusses sexual misconduct allegations.
