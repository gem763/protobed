That won\u2019t wipe out our rainfall deficit, which coming into today was close to 5 inches below normal since Sept. 1. But it\u2019s a start. Dry weather returns tomorrow into the weekend with gradual warming, and perhaps another shot at some rain by late Sunday or Monday.\n\nGet our daily forecasts on your Amazon Alexa device.

That means a duo of partly to mostly sunny days with Friday highs in the low-to-mid 60s and still a bit of a breeze, and Saturday highs in the mid-to-upper 60s with light winds. Confidence: Medium-High\n\nSunday trends a bit warmer with highs in the upper 60s to mid-70s, but we\u2019ll have to watch the chance of some rain approaching from the south later in the day.
