Since this backpack is also available to buy here, we are publishing it for our readers on this side of the pond.\n\nAs a reporter, it\u2019s not very often I get a chance to write about things I enjoy. Usually, I\u2019m writing about social or political issues, interviewing people across the U.K. and the world about their experiences and lives. But here I am, to gush to you about the love of my life: my Knomo backpack. I found my Knomo the way anyone does: through creepily targeted ads on Instagram. I was clicking around backpacks on other sites, and suddenly Knomo began to appear in my feed. I remember thinking the bags were expensive at first. And it\u2019s true, they are, with backpacks costing at least $130, compared to $50 for a Herschel. But when I saw how the Knomo Beauchamp backpacks are designed to fit a laptop, sneakers, notepad, and more, it looked like a winner.\n\nLet me explain. I don\u2019t carry a lot with me when I report, so you\u2019d think any old backpack would do the job \u2014 but I\u2019ve been through quite a few. I love Herschel backpacks, but the ones with a laptop-holder area are too bulky, and the ones without have no compartments at all \u2014 meaning it can cause a total fluster trying to dig to the bottom of the bag, desperately trying to claw around to find my pen.\n\nThe Knomo Beauchamp has multiple compartment areas \u2014 zips at the front, a laptop area, zips inside for more valuable items, side holders, everything. It\u2019s light, durable, and has never let me down. When I was on a bus in Guatemala on a story, I could pull my portable charger out of the front pocket to charge my phone up to rearrange an interview when the bus broke down. And when I sat on a train traveling across Vietnam, I could stash two b\u00e1nh m\u00ecs in my bag along with a ton of other snacks, with room to spare. Best yet, all of those items have been well-protected from the rain, thanks to the bag\u2019s water-resistant fabric.\n\nThis year, now that I\u2019m based back in (and reporting from) London, I am still hopelessly attached to my bag. And when I\u2019m on the tube, I see a lot of other women with a Knomo, which suggests it\u2019s far from being for travelers exclusively \u2014 it\u2019s clearly a commuter bag too. Best of all, it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s traveled the world with me, though it very much has (it\u2019s accompanied me to Hong Kong, to the Great Wall of China, on a bus ride through El Salvador to Mexico) \u2014 it shows no marks, or scratches, and has no missing bits. Even if I decided to leave journalism tomorrow, I\u2019d still cling to my Knomo, as it\u2019s the only bag I\u2019ve ever found that fits the items I need on the go in the city (charger, water bottle, book) without the need to cram them in. Plus, you know, it looks cute.\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
