The President has been crystal clear no quid pro quo's of any kind.\"", "description": "Acting U.S. Ambassador Bill Taylor left Ukraine on Wednesday for a return to Washington.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/4238690/1000x563_nbc-191016-william-taylor-se-136p_4e7028ebbf1e756390b20741c781677d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
