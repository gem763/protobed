In its fourth-quarter outlook the bank cites the U.S.-China trade war (though the news today on that front was optimistic), as well as the possibility of auto tariffs, weighing on the global economy. Central banks seem ready to help, though fiscal support is more in talk than practice. And the risks to the global economy weigh to the downside.\n\n\u201cEspecially if exacerbated by additional downside shocks, the downturn could become nonlinear and morph into a fully-fledged global recession.\u201d BNP Paribas expects more negative revisions to earnings forecasts as the global economy slows further, which will shift the market focus to earnings from valuations.\n\nNaturally with this perspective, they prefer defensive stocks over cyclicals. \u201cWe expect increased dispersion of stock returns, with companies that have pricing power and low labor costs as a percentage of earnings likely to be more resilient. We view companies with higher balance sheet leverage and already-low margins as most at risk in a late-cycle environment,\u201d they said.\n\nBNP Paribas are bond bulls and expect the yield on the 10-year Treasury to drop to 1% by the fourth quarter.\n\nThe markets\n\nFollowing the 237-point rally on Wednesday for the Dow industrials DJIA, +0.91% on hopes for eased tensions in Hong Kong, U.S. stock futures ES00, +0.86% YM00, +0.91% NQ00, +1.12% rallied on China trade talks.\n\nGold futures GC00, -0.58% fell and the yield on the 10-year Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, +3.10% rose.\n\nAsian ADOW, +0.93% and European SXXP, +0.60% stocks rose.\n\nThe buzz\n\nNews that U.S.-China trade talks will continue in early October in Washington spurred another risk-on day, following what was described as a call that \u201cwent well\u201d between China Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. German manufacturing orders slumped in July in another reminder of the state of the global economy.\n\nQuite a bit of data on the U.S. labor front, with the ADP employment survey, jobless claims and productivity figures all on tap. Messaging service Slack Technologies WORK, +8.03% may be active as it reported strong revenue growth and deepening operating losses.\n\nChart of the day\n\nUBS has cut its 10-year yield forecast by a quarter-point, to the same level BNP Paribas has: 1%. That is due to its lowered global growth forecasts. The chart shows, during the last rate-cut cycle, how Fed interest rate cuts spurred the market into expecting even more rate cuts. UBS now sees five quarter-point cuts by the end of 2020.\n\nRandom reads\n\nA study finds vegans and vegetarians may be at a higher risk of stroke than carnivores.\n\nThe president of the United States showed a doctored map of a hurricane to justify an incorrect weather forecast he made.\n\nA man opened a can of Heinz KHC, +0.77% baked beans\u2014to find precisely one inside.\n\nNeed to Know starts early and is updated until the opening bell, but sign up here to get it delivered once to your email box.
