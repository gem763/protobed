She puts her trim figure down to intermittent fasting, daily yoga sessions and high-octane boxing workouts.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nBut what has the actress done to her face?\n\nA spokesperson for Glow by MYA explains: \"I would suggest Jennifer has had anti-wrinkle injections, often referred to as Botox, to her forehead and around her eyes (crow's feet).\n\n\"This non-surgical treatment will create a smooth forehead and limit any frown or expression lines. The treatment will normally last three to six months; as muscle action gradually returns, the lines and wrinkles begin to reappear and need to be treated again.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\n\"This procedure can give the appearance of smoother skin if you are looking to achieve a youthful appearance, or it can be used as a preventative measure to slow the process of ageing.\n\n\"Jennifer has previously spoken openly about having a rhinoplasty (often referred to as a nose job) to correct a deviated septum in her twenties. This surgery could explain the change in Jennifer's nose but we believe she may have asked for a slender more natural bridge and tip, making it a cosmetic rhinoplasty.\n\n(Image: WireImage)\n\n\"The result of the procedure is very natural and still in keeping with the natural proportions of her face. The cost of a rhinoplasty procedure depends on many different physiological factors, the techniques used and the surgeon performing the procedure. They typically range from \u00a36,000 to \u00a310,000.\n\n(Image: Jimmy Kimmel Live)\n\n\"Jennifer's age-defying appearance may have had a little help from surgical and non-surgical procedures, although it's obvious she has amazing genes.\"", "description": "Jennifer Aniston looks incredible at the age of 50 - but has she had some help in the looks department by a surgeon or two?", "authors": ["Emmeline Saunders", "Image", "Getty Images", "Wireimage", "Jimmy Kimmel Live"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20706601.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Jennifer-Aniston.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
