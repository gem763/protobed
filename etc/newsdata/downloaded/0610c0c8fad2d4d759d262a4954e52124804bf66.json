This sanction was placed on him following an internal investigation into claims he sexually harassed students in 2014 and 2015.\n\nBut the college has now said its earlier statement announcing Hutchinson would be \u201cpermanently withdrawing from college life\u201d was \u201cincorrect\u201d.\n\n\u201cDr Hutchinson will continue to attend certain college events and to exercise his dining rights, but will not attend events primarily aimed at students or alumni except by agreement with the college,\u201d the college added in a statement.\n\nHutchinson automatically became a professor emeritus upon his retirement and would be able to enjoy the \u201crights and privileges\u201d associated with this honour, it said.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dr Peter Hutchinson was banned from Trinity Hall and from contacting students in 2017. Photograph: Chris Radburn/PA\n\nCleodie Rickard, 23, was among the 10 students in August 2015 who detailed separate incidents of \u201cinappropriate, sexual and sexist comments\u201d that Hutchinson allegedly made in 2014 and 2015 in seminars, supervisions and other teaching sessions and social events at the college.\n\n\u201cI am absolutely outraged and insulted that [the] college would believe this would pass us by and we would not act on the news,\u201d she said. \u201cI am incredibly disheartened that yet again, after a four-year process to get him removed, the forces of power and patronage win out over empty commitments to zero tolerance and support and safety for students of the college.\u201d\n\nRickard added that the college had not yet notified her of its decision and felt as if its reputational concerns outweighed any genuine concern for her wellbeing.\n\nAnother complainant, Ellie Pyemont, tweeted that those who had experienced sexual misconduct while at Trinity Hall \u201chave been treated appallingly\u201d.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that the college ignored red flags & instead appear to have allowed \u2018acquittal tea parties\u2019 in their grounds after he was acquitted of sexually assaulting me in 2005.\u201d\n\nThe latest news comes after the University of Cambridge made efforts to improve its central procedures amid a recent scandal over how it has handled sexual harassment complaints.\n\nHuman rights barrister Dr Charlotte Proudman, a junior research fellow at Queen\u2019s College, called Hutchinson\u2019s reinstatement a \u201cslap in the face for survivors of sexual harassment\u201d. She added: \u201cThe college has given fellows a licence to abuse their power with impunity. Women students are not safe in their own colleges!\n\n\u201cNext time the college could be responsible for irreparable harm. We need urgent reform.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday more than 70 current and former Trinity Hall students, fellows and staff had signed a draft open letter calling for Hutchinson\u2019s removal. It also calls for the college to \u201ccritically review\u201d how it deals with cases of sexual harassment and assault and publish the results transparently as well as giving tutors training on how to support student victims.\n\nDr Priyamvada Gopal, a reader at Cambridge\u2019s English Faculty, said that there was more chance of a \u201cpredatory culture\u201d flourishing in colleges because it could not be addressed by the university centrally.\n\n\u201cColleges often tend to act in ways that counter the central university\u2019s efforts to address problems, including around sexual harassment,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is time for the university to take a more proactive role in addressing collegiate culture and its abuses. Collegiate autonomy acts to cover a multitude of sins and this won\u2019t wash in the long run.\u201d\n\n\u201cWithout further reforms and clear safeguards, including external monitoring, the safety conditions of students vulnerable to sexual harassment will not improve.\u201d\n\nHer views were echoed by Dr Tiffany Page, a University of Cambridge sociology lecturer, who said that students are being failed by colleges\u2019 \u201clack of procedures for dealing with staff sexual misconduct\u201d.\n\n\u201cThere is a complete lack of accountability for decisions made and students are not the priority at Trinity Hall,\u201d she said. \u201cPeter Hutchinson should be removed as an emeritus fellow through his misconduct and there should be policy in place to ensure this never happens again.\n\n\u201cThe spotlight needs to be shined on Cambridge colleges, which have so far managed to escape investigation into their treatment of students and accountability for preventing sexual misconduct and other forms of discrimination against their students.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if there is any means by which University of Cambridge could intervene in the college\u2019s decision, a spokeswoman said: \u201cThe colleges are all semi-autonomous. The college has made [its] decision. The central university is not involved.\u201d\n\nTrinity Hall has been approached for further comment.", "description": "Readmission of Dr Peter Hutchinson to Trinity Hall events a \u2018slap in the face for survivors of sexual harassment\u2019", "authors": ["David Batty", "Aaron Walawalkar"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9cb95ee62a112e03a1913fc554b6a68039d1329/0_177_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=79cac9ce40f6fb364e8a20890131b8a8", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
