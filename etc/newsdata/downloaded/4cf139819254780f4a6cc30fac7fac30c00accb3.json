But President Donald Trump's policies are also very much to blame here.\n\nTrump promised to buck economic thought and go full protectionist. Economists warned him this would damage the global economy, but he didn't listen.\n\nFeel free to walk by the White House and scream \"I told you so!\"\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nWhen Donald Trump became the 45th president of the United States, he promised to launch an economic experiment.\n\nIgnoring the past few decades of economic liberalization, multilateralism, and openness, Trump promised to close the economy, renegotiate our trade deals nation by nation, and refocus the US economy on a relatively small sector, manufacturing, which makes up less than 20% of the economy.\n\nTo some, that experiment was a refreshing turn from the steady plod toward globalization that Americans have experienced for the past 50 years. To others \u2014 especially to economists \u2014 this was folly.\n\nProtectionism, as experts well know, is bad news. They reminded Trump that steel tariffs have only brought the US pain \u2014 but Trump slapped them on our allies anyway. He was warned about his tax policies; about disrupting the North American Free Trade Agreement, our trade deal with Canada and Mexico; about ripping up the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a major trade deal forged by the Obama administration and supported by members of both parties; and about confronting China alone. But Trump did it all anyway.\n\nAnd so the world found out what happens when the most powerful country in the world takes 100 years of economic knowledge and flushes it down the toilet. Experiment, on.\n\nVoila, America\n\nHere we are, three years into the Trump administration's experiment, with a recession rapping at the door of the US economy. How do we know?\n\nThe pesky yield curve keeps inverting, showing us that investors are worried about what's around the corner for the US economy.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, Wall Street waited with bated breath for one number, from the ISM services survey, which told us that 80% of the US economy had slowed to levels unseen since 2016.\n\nThe services contraction came amid manufacturing's slump, which has been with us since last year and just reached its lowest point since 2009.\n\nPeople have lost interest in buying big-ticket items like washing machines.\n\nChief financial officers across the country are feeling gloomier than they have in three years.\n\nEmployment numbers remain strong \u2014 though hiring is slowing \u2014 and consumer confidence remains somewhat steady. But allow me to remind you that those are lagging indicators. When a recession comes, the consumer is the last to know.\n\nRunning with scissors\n\nRecessions are cyclical; that's a fact. But there are things you can do to hasten them, and the Trump administration has done all it can to do that. His policies have basically been the economic equivalent of running at breakneck speed with a pair of very sharp scissors.\n\nTrump ran on a platform of ignoring the rules of economics and turning personal grievances into policy. Now we know what that can do to the mightiest economy on the planet.\n\nTrade wars have disrupted agriculture and manufacturing, ripping up supply chains and costing the government billions in aid. Erratic policies have spooked Wall Street and exhausted and frustrated our allies. The world is now a place where the United States cannot be trusted, and that is a world where growth is slower. Just about every respectable economist in the game told Trump this would happen, but he and his allies didn't want to hear it.\n\nSo now we're here, in a moment that the World Trade Organization says could produce \"a destructive cycle of recrimination.\" When there is no trust between counterparties in markets and everyone gets desperate, there can be unintended consequences. Monetary and fiscal policies will shift as countries try to get used to a world growing more slowly, and this could, the WTO said, \"destabilize volatile financial markets\" and \"produce an even bigger downturn in trade.\"\n\nSometimes rules are rules for a reason.", "description": "Trump came into office promising to throw out the economic rule book, and that has turned out just about as badly as one might expect.", "authors": ["Linette Lopez"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d964b5f8cefa000277dae29?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
