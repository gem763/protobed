India wants safeguards to be built into the proposed pact to prevent a sudden surge in imports.\n\nBut Thailand said the trade agreement was on track to be concluded while it chairs the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) this year - and ideally before an RCEP summit on Nov. 4.\n\n\"We still have a good feeling ... that all 16 members, including India, are willing to try to solve the remaining differences,\" said Auramon Supthaweethum, director-general of Thailand's Department of Trade Negotiations. \"Our target is still to have a good deal by the end of this year.\"\n\nFirst proposed by China, RCEP comprises the ASEAN member states and six Asia-Pacific countries: China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand. ASEAN has existing free-trade agreements with all six Asia-Pacific countries.\n\nRCEP members were working on two parallel negotiations, on market access in goods and services, and on a draft agreement text, the official said.\n\nMarket access negotiations, conducted bilaterally, were already 80.4% completed, with 16% of the remainder \"near conclusion,\" Auramon said, adding that an outstanding 3.6% still need to be discussed urgently.\n\nCountries that don't have existing free trade agreements with each other may, such as China and India, may take longer in their talks, said Auramon.\n\nIndia has reached an agreement in principle with other countries to include a safeguard mechanism that would trigger duties if goods are deemed to have been dumped from a partner country, a source with knowledge of the negotiations told Reuters in India last week.\n\n\"Members are spending the remaining period trying to get rid of some differences and trying to conclude talks,\" she said.\n\n\"Because it's done bilaterally, we don't know the details of their discussions,\" she added.\n\nFourteen chapters of the 20-chapter text have so far been approved by all members, Auramon said.\n\nASEAN and its partners will hold three more RCEP-related meetings before an RCEP summit early next month, where ASEAN leaders expect to announce the success of the talks.\n\n\"It's a significant year, with global trade disputes and uncertainties, and nobody wants to lose out,\" Auramon said.
