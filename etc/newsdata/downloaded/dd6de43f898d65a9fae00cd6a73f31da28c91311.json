He also stated that the U.S. Supreme Court has \u201crepeatedly and unequivocally\u201d held that a state cannot ban abortion before viability.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLawyers with the American Civil Liberties Union, Planned Parenthood and the Center for Reproductive Rights filed a challenge to the law in June.\n\nGeorgia was among several states this year to pass legislation banning abortions in early pregnancy, working to get the issue in front of the conservative majority on the Supreme Court. The laws are all facing ongoing challenges in court.\n\nGeorgia\u2019s law specifically stated that a fetus is a \u201cnatural person\u201d and \u201chuman being\u201d once a heartbeat is detected.\n\nThe law included exceptions for incest, rape and situations of medical futility or where the health of the mother is at stake. But the federal judge on Tuesday wrote the exceptions \u201cdo not save it from being an otherwise unconstitutional pre-viability abortion ban.\"\n\nAD\n\nThe state characterized the law not as a ban but rather a \u201crestriction.\u201d Lawyers on behalf of the state argued Georgia had an interest in protecting the life of the unborn and that the \u201cprecise contours\u201d of that interest remain undefined.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWhat is clearly defined, however,\u201d Jones wrote in response, \u201cis that under no circumstances whatsoever may a State prohibit or ban abortions at any point prior to viability, no matter what interests the State asserts to support it.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s office could not be immediately reached for comment, but a Kemp spokeswoman, Candice Broce, told the Associated Press that the governor is reviewing the decision.\n\n\u201cDespite today\u2019s outcome, we remain confident in our position,\u201d Broce wrote in a statement. \u201cWe will continue to fight for the unborn and work to ensure that all Georgians have the opportunity to live, grow, and prosper.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEmily Nestler, a senior staff attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights, celebrated the judge\u2019s decision, calling the law \u201ca clear attempt to overturn Roe v. Wade,\u201d the 1973 Supreme Court ruling allowing abortion rights.\n\nTalcott Camp, deputy director of the ACLU\u2019s Reproductive Freedom Project, called it \u201ca victory for people in Georgia and a reminder that these attacks on abortion access are illegal.\"\n\nShe added: \u201cAbortion is still legal in all 50 states. We won\u2019t stop fighting until we defeat all efforts to block access.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The Georgia law banned abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected.", "authors": ["Samantha Schmidt", "Reporter Covering Gender", "Family Issues"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/cNqnkCANfzRmjUPRxoMR6H4KDWo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/JDQJXZHEQYI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
