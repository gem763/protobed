Higher rates are set for wealthier nations, and lower rates for poorer countries.\n\nThe system is reviewed every four years during a quadrennial congress, and the UPU says it ultimately aims for every country to fall under the same rules.\n\nWhy is the US opposed to the current system?\n\nSeveral countries have expressed their opposition, but last October the US became the first to threaten withdrawal.\n\nIt argues that China, a major global exporter, is now the biggest beneficiary of the system because it is a major economic power but still pays lower rates than the US.\n\nUS firms say that, as a result, it can cost significantly more to post an item within the US than shipping it from abroad. Officials say this is unfair to US manufacturers and facilitates the shipment of counterfeit goods.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption White House trade adviser Peter Navarro (left) says the UPU's system is \"broken\"\n\nThe US wants changes to the postal treaty to allow countries to set their own rates for parcels weighing under 2kg (4.4lb). They are already allowed to do so for bigger packages.\n\nDuring talks on Tuesday, President Donald Trump's hardline trade adviser Peter Navarro called for changes to the system \"that everyone in this room knows is broken\".\n\n\"The mission here today is to retool this system for the brave new world of e-commerce,\" he told delegates on Tuesday.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nThe three-day conference will end on Thursday, and unless a deal is reached, the US says it will make good on its threat to withdraw.\n\nThe process of withdrawing from the treaty will take at least a year, and would require the US to set up its own bilateral agreements with countries around the world.\n\nDuring talks, the US has signalled that it is willing to accept a two-phased option allowing it to impose new rates immediately, while giving other countries five years to do the same.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption UPU director general Bishar Abdirahman Hussein has warned of \"major disruption\" if the US were to withdraw\n\nMr Navarro said Washington could quit without any problems, and UPU spokesperson David Dadge told the BBC that the UN body had a plan of action should the US decide to withdraw.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Mr Hussein warned that \"major disruption is on the way if we don't solve the problem today\".\n\nHe said every country would have to \"figure out how to send mail to the United States\".", "description": "The US has threatened to quit the \"broken\" 145-year-old scheme that sets postal rates.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/141E/production/_103905150_gettyimages-526176702.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
