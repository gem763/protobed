I\u2019m likely way off, but I would go out with that. I\u2019d be on board and it would explain a lot.\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nAnother asked: \"Is Nate Faith's son?\"\n\nA third added: \"I'm feeling like I'd prefer him to be Faith's son, but his vendetta seems to be against Cain specifically. Is it going to be a repeat of Debbie, where Cain knocked someone up but didn't know, and Faith kept it from him?\"\n\nMeanwhile some still believed Cain was his father, with a viewer tweeting: \"So Nate is Cain\u2019s son?! How are they gonna spin that? Ha.\"\n\nEmmerdale airs weeknights at 7pm on ITV, with an extra episode at 8pm on Thursdays.", "description": "Emmerdale's Nate will find his true identity exposed in upcoming scenes, with him thought to be linked to Faith and Cain Dingle", "authors": ["Charlotte Tutton", "Image", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20542918.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_EHP_CHP_091019emmerdale_5633JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
