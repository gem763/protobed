Today, we\u2019re unfortunately in just such a state: Global PMI indices are flashing recession, the U.S., U.K. and to an extent Canada are facing political uncertainty, and talk of trade wars continues to escalate.\n\nThis may motivate an investor to go to cash, which, contrary to what many may believe, is exactly the wrong thing to do in such times. Unfortunately though, this happens to be one of the most common actions taken especially among many of the do-it-yourself portfolios that we\u2019ve reviewed.\n\nSo if you\u2019re tempted to hit that sell button and park the money under your mattress, here are three reasons why you should reconsider.\n\nInflation and death by a thousand paper cuts\n\nRay Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater, offers some great perspective on why going to cash is simply a bad idea.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the worst thing you could do because it is the surest tax on your money. You will bleed slowly to death, because the after-tax returns are lower than inflation by a little per year.\u201d\n\nEven though inflation is quite low at the moment, it is well above short-term deposit rates and so having too much of a cash weighting could have a profound impact such as not saving enough for retirement or accelerating the depletion of one\u2019s assets for those living off of them during retirement.\n\nFor example, we ran a planning analysis for a fictitious retired couple spending a combined $100,000 per year with $2.25 million in assets (blend of registered and non-registered) and a two per cent inflation rate. In the first scenario we assumed a 50/50 split in the assets between cash and equity which resulted in a terminal value (age 67 to age 90) more than half that than if their assets were in a 5/45/50 cash, fixed-income and equity portfolio. This is quite significant given we assumed fixed income only earned a 1.75 per cent premium to cash.\n\nMarket timers beware\n\nPutnam Investments recently did a great study showing the impact of what happened if an investor missed the 10, 20, 30 and 40 best days in the market from Dec. 31, 2003 to Dec. 31, 2018.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s say an investor\u2019s market timing resulted in them missing out on only the 10 best days in the S&P 500 over the past 15 years. This resulted in a $10,000 investment growing to $15,481 (2.96 per cent annualized return) or almost half that of the $30,711 (7.8 per cent annualised return) if they had stayed fully invested. If they missed out on the 20, 30 or 40 best days their $10,000 investment would be much worse at only $10,042, $6,873, $4,943, respectively.\n\nLower returns and greater risk than fixed income\n\nMany believe that going to cash is a safest way to protect against a market correction. That said, history has shown that fixed income has proven to offer a lot more downside protection to a portfolio without having the same performance drag risk.\n\nFor example, we ran our own numbers over the same aforementioned 15-year period but assuming a 30-per-cent weighting to a blend of short- to long-term U.S. treasuries versus a 30-per-cent weighting to cash both offsetting a 70 per cent weighting to the S&P 500.\n\nWe calculate that a portfolio with fixed income only gave up 39 basis points in annual performance to an all-stock portfolio compared to a 168 basis point deficit in the portfolio that held cash. Importantly, the worst year of the portfolio with fixed income was a 20.5 per cent loss better than the 37.1 per cent loss in the all-stock portfolio and surprisingly, the 25.5 per cent loss in the portfolio with cash.\n\nIn conclusion, we think cash should play a role in a portfolio especially if one has upcoming liquidity requirements but making moves on fear over a market correction can prove to be quite costly.\n\nMartin Pelletier, CFA is a Portfolio Manager and OCIO at TriVest Wealth Counsel Ltd, a Calgary-based private client and institutional investment firm specializing in discretionary risk-managed portfolios as well as investment audit and oversight services.", "description": "If you\u2019re tempted to hit that sell button and park the money under your mattress, here are three reasons why you should reconsider", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/money-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
