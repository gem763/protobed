The trial began in June 2017.\n\nThe accident led to a complete shutdown of all nuclear reactors in the country. Despite widespread anti-nuclear sentiment, several reactors have since resumed operations after passing special safety checks.\n\nTepco is facing various legal cases seeking compensation over the disaster, after several workers developed illnesses after cleaning up the Fukushima plant.", "description": "It was the only criminal case to arise out of the world's worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/149CA/production/_108862448_befunky-collage354.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
