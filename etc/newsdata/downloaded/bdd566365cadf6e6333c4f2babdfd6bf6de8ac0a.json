What\u2019s more, they seem to feel that his unwillingness to speak about the Hong Kong protesters voids all of his prior advocacy efforts, the school he built in Akron, the spotlight he\u2019s brought on police brutality and state-sanctioned violence and his lobbying for greater gun control according to those critics. Edwards isn\u2019t having it: \u201cThat\u2019s not just disingenuous, it\u2019s degenerate,\u201d he said.\n\nDavid West, who played 15 years in the NBA and currently serves as chief operating officer of the Historical Basketball League, agreed. \u201cTed Cruz, Marco Rubio? I immediately I put up a red flag when those two folks are involved in anything,\u201d said West. \u201cWe\u2019ve \u2018ve dumbed down the conversation to \u2018LeBron is pro-China and he won\u2019t speak out on issues in Hong Kong.'\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Robert Silverman", "Nbcnews.Com Think Opinion"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
