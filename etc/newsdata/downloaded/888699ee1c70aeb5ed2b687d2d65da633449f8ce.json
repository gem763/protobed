To fix it they took off the tiles and put wood underneath to make it straight.\n\n\"Under the window it was meant to be a pattern but it was wonky - my two-year-old could build better than that.\"\n\nThey claim the managing director Mr Williams said all costs incurred associated with the house would be refunded to the husband and wife.\n\nBut Sarah said when she sent the bills to Bellway - including solicitor and evaluation fees - Bellway replied they refunded the couple for the full reservation and 'additions' to the property.\n\nHowever, the house building company said they would not refund the family for any other fees.\n\nIn an email seen by the ECHO, Bellway wrote: \"We are advised that a refund for any other fees in relation to your purchase was not agreed during your discussions at these offices with our Managing Director.\"\n\nSarah added: \"We sent all our bills to them and then they wrote back and said that the discussion never happened.\n\n\"We would only be given the money back we directly gave to them, however when we spoke to him he said he would refund any costs which have incurred to with the house including the solicitor fees.\n\n\"We are now \u00a31,000 out of pocket, we have two young children under two and it took it a long time to get that money together.\n\n\"Me and my husband had nothing new the whole time and we had cheap cars to save money.\"\n\nThe Chan family are now having to live in a property owned by Sarah's parents - they said if they didn't have this the would be homeless.\n\nThe mum of two added: \"We're living in my mum and dad's property, which they were about to sell - so now they're out of pocket too.\n\n\"If it wasn't for this property we would be homeless.\"\n\nSarah alleges after being told their reservation was cancelled, their property was once again being advertised on Rightmove, shortly afterwards.\n\nThe family said they now have to wait until May to move into a new property they reserved and have filed a county court claim.\n\nA spokesperson for Bellway Homes said: \u201cAs an NHBC five star accredited housebuilder, we are incredibly proud of our customer service and feel that it would be inappropriate and unprofessional to comment on individual customer cases which remain a private matter between ourselves and our customers.\u201d", "description": "Mum-of-two Sarah Chan, 27, says her family would be left 'homeless' if they hadn't been able to move into her parent's home temporarily", "authors": ["Olivia Williams"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20542003.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_RIP-Couples-saw-house-reservation-cancelled-after-complaining-kitchen-was-nailed-with-screws.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
