CNN's Jim Acosta is one of the so-called \"reporters\" who has been at the forefront of Trump's battle with the press.\n\nLast year, the White House suspended his hard press pass after he pushed an intern holding a microphone. Eventually, CNN sued to have the hard pass reinstated. They won the lawsuit, Acosta's press pass was reinstated and things went back to \"normal.\" Throughout the entire ordeal Acosta seemed confused about why he was being denied access to the White House. In his mind, he was a journalist who was simply \"doing his job\" and \"reporting the news.\"\n\nOn Friday, Acosta shared pictures and videos from his trip to Minneapolis to cover President Trump's Keep America Great Again rally. It's standard practice for journalists to share these sort of things, especially as they happen. But Acosta proved exactly why President Trump and average Americans take issue with the legacy media. In his first tweet he speculated what the 2020 election will be about.\n\n\"2020 will be 2016 all over again and then some. Bashing immigrants, stoking hatred of the press, protesters being ejected, fringe viewpoints, and police in riot gear... all on display at Trump\u2019s rally in MN,\" he said on Twitter.\n\n2020 will be 2016 all over again and then some.

A red sign. Go figure.\n\nApparently wanting secure borders is \"bashing immigrants.\"\n\nApparently calling out the media's blatant leftist agenda masqueraded as \"neutral reporting\" is somehow \"stoking hatred of the press.\"\n\nApparently wanting to drain the swamp is somehow a \"fringe viewpoint.\"\n\nAnd he wonders why the American people loath the mainstream media? Gee. Wonder why.\n\nThe rest of his thread features pictures and videos of a few disruptors and even police in riot gear.\n\nProtester ejections throughout the evening. This woman did not go quietly. Others did. pic.twitter.com/EYuOhlSqPV \u2014 Jim Acosta (@Acosta) October 11, 2019\n\nA man waved a Trump sign in this protester\u2019s face. pic.twitter.com/cqEbiz8NUv \u2014 Jim Acosta (@Acosta) October 11, 2019\n\nWe spotted Minneapolis police in riot gear mounting up as the rally was wrapping up. pic.twitter.com/XJyvWrHgis \u2014 Jim Acosta (@Acosta) October 11, 2019\n\nBut guess what he fails to include or even condemn? The leftist Antifa protestors who were setting things on fire and disrespecting police officers. In typical Antifa fashion, they were attacking those they disagree with.\n\nBREAKING: Protesters burn Trump hats and flags outside Trump rally in Minnesota. #MinneapolisTrumpRally (CBS News) pic.twitter.com/LutoJAeakq \u2014 Corp Main News (@corp_main) October 11, 2019\n\nA man in a blue jacket seemed to be leaving the Trump rally by himself when he was spotted by a protester who yelled: \u201cThere\u2019s a Nazi over here!\u201d A group of protesters then attacked the man, slapping and pushing him.

You're right. 2020 will be just like 2016. You and your leftist cohorts will continue to turn a blind eye to violence, especially when it's launched at conservatives. You will continue to ignore Antifa and act like they're simply \"lone attacks\" even though they show up en masse to various events across the country with the goal of hurting others.\n\nGreat journalism there.", "description": "But it's not all that surprising..10/12/2019 12:01:06PM EST.", "authors": ["Beth Baumann", "Matt Vespa", "Katie Pavlich", "Timothy Meads", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/295/541e044e-c5ca-46d7-95c8-22f874c9555f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
