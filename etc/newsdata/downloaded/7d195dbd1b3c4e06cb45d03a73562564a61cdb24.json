The forest yields 165,000 acres of old growth trees and 20,000 acres of new growth trees, according to the agency.\n\nThe draft environmental impact statement will be submitted to the Federal Register later this week, according to the USFS.\n\nPresident Trump Donald John TrumpBusiness school deans call for lifting country-specific visa caps Bolton told ex-Trump aide to call White House lawyers about Ukraine pressure campaign: report Federal prosecutors in New York examining Giuliani business dealings with Ukraine: report MORE first directed Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue George (Sonny) Ervin PerdueWe must reject the 'go big or go home' mentality of modern agriculture Overnight Energy: Perry denies he is planning to resign | Workers sue over Trump rule on pork inspections | Video shows cacti at national monument being bulldozed for border wall Workers sue over Trump administration rule that speeds inspection of pork products MORE to lift the restrictions on the Tongass under the \u201cRoadless Rule\u201d earlier this month, The Washington Post reported in August.\n\nSeveral Alaskan lawmakers have long sought an exemption to the rule in the area, arguing it would be a boost to the local economy.\n\nThe Post reported that multiple conversations between Trump and Alaska Gov.

In early September, after a hearing with the acting director of BLM William Pendley, the congressman called a subpoena \u201cthe next step.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hearing validated some things we had been considering and also justifies us going further in the consideration of a subpoena to get those reorganization papers. I think that\u2019s the next step,\u201d Grijalva said at the time.\n\nNear the end of the month, frustration with Interior had extended to both parties.\n\nAt a Sept. 26 hearing with Interior\u2019s newly confirmed solicitor, Grijalva said the committee had sent 24 requests to Interior, with only three responses providing enough information to be deemed satisfactory.\n\n\u201cInterior\u2019s refusal to cooperate means this committee cannot do the oversight envisioned in our Constitution,\u201d Grijalva said at the hearing. \u201cThat has not stopped the Trump administration from delaying, obstructing and sometimes just ignoring our efforts to conduct oversight.\"\n\nRep.

He promised lawmakers he would follow up on a number of requests they made, including a request for planning documents tied to Interior\u2019s decision to move 300 Washington-based BLM employees to various offices across the West.\n\nThe senior staffer said many of those requests, some of which had Oct. 4 deadlines, have not been fulfilled.\n\nRead more here.\n\nNOT A CROWD PLEASER: New details released Thursday as part of the Trump administration\u2019s plan to boost ethanol are getting low marks from key corners of President Trump\u2019s base: corn farmers and the oil and gas industry.\n\nThe proposal gets to the heart of what has angered farmers across the Corn Belt \u2014 waivers given to small refineries that exempt them from adding ethanol to the fuel they produce.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced earlier this month that it would require other larger refineries to add those exempted gallons into their fuels. But the formula unveiled by the agency Tuesday would require those refineries to add ethanol based on projections rather than the actual number of gallons exempted.\n\nThis is angering ethanol groups that had praised the policy just a little over a week ago.\n\n\u201cIf the Oct. 4 announcement from EPA was a big step forward, today\u2019s supplemental proposal is a step backward,\u201d Renewable Fuels Association President and CEO Geoff Cooper said in a release, asking for an intervention from Trump himself. \u201cThis proposal is not what was promised by the administration.\u201d\n\nEthanol producers worry there will be a major disconnect between the actual number of gallons of ethanol that are not blended into the fuel supply after the EPA doles out waivers and the number of gallons the government projects will be exempted.\n\n\u201cWe are outraged the Environmental Protection Agency did not implement the details that were presented and outlined by the president only eleven days ago,\u201d the Iowa Corn Growers Association said in a statement. \u201cAny proposal that does not account for actual waived gallons under the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) fails to restore the integrity of the law.\u201d\n\nThe EPA in August announced it was giving out 31 such waivers to small refineries, bringing the total to 85 under the Trump administration, a sharp uptick from the fewer than 10 that were issued under former President Obama.\n\nThat proved a catalyzing event for farmers, particularly in Iowa, who have been putting political pressure on Trump for find a fix.\n\nTrump has since been struggling to please both corn farmers and the oil and gas industry with his attempts to reform the RFS program, alternatively angering one side or the other with each hint at a new proposal.\n\nOn Tuesday, both groups were united in their displeasure. The oil and gas industry opposes changes to the waiver process mainly because it doesn't think larger refineries should have to take on the gallons small refineries pass up.\n\n\u201cWhile the granting of widespread small refinery exemptions should not be occurring in the first place, there is simply no logic in forcing complying refineries to bear the burden of decisions outside of their control. We are evaluating our options and fully intend to vigorously challenge this misguided policy,\u201d Frank Macchiarola, vice president of downstream and industry operations at the American Petroleum Institute, said in a statement to The Hill.\n\nRead more here.\n\nON TAP TOMORROW:\n\nOn Wednesday, the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee will hold a hearing on aquaculture.\n\nLater that day, the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works will hold a hearing on how disease impacts wildlife management.\n\nOUTSIDE THE BELTWAY:\n\n-Two Washington tribes make first call for removal of Columbia River dams, The Seattle Times reports.\n\n-Shrinking ice leaves subsistence hunters with little in Alaska town, Alaska Public Media reports.\n\n-Oregon may allow BYO food containers in stores, restaurants, the Associated Press reports.\n\nICYMI: Stories from Tuesday...\n\nDemocrats inch closer to issuing subpoenas for Interior, EPA records\n\nTrump's latest plan to boost ethanol miffs both corn groups and the fossil fuel industry\n\nUniversity of Iowa faculty told not to promote Greta Thunberg appearance\n\nTrump administration issues plan to reverse limits on logging in Tongass National Forest", "description": "TONGASS LOGGING GETS GREENLIT AGAIN: The Trump administration is teeing up plans to reverse a long-standing limit on logging in Alaska\u2019s Tongass National Forest.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/logging_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
