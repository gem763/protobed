And America\u2019s seniors are demanding answers.\n\nFor decades, citizens have feared losing Medicare. Why? Because America\u2019s seniors have endured half a century of the same all-talk, no-action politicians promising results and delivering consequences.\n\nConsider this:\n\nFor 45 years, today\u2019s retirees have witnessed their family and friends who wear the uniform of our Armed Forces injured on the front lines only to return home to wait in line \u2014 surviving enemy fire to later be victimized by VA personnel who could not be fired for incompetence or even sadism. Although these veterans fought for their country, their country returned the favor by fighting against them \u2014 refusing VA choice, accountability, and whistleblower protection and protecting their own, not their best.\n\nFor 44 years, our seniors buried the terminally ill who were denied by their \u201crepresentatives\u201d the Right to Try potentially life-saving treatments.\n\nAnd in recent years, these same citizens watched their loved ones with pre-existing conditions suffer the catastrophe of Obamacare \u2014 a gateway drug to universal healthcare that delivered skyrocketing premiums, crushing penalties, and dangerous wait-times. From medical mistakes, this country suffers over five times the number of casualties we suffered in the Vietnam War \u2014 every year. From opioids, senior citizens have stood at the graves of their children and grandchildren whose painkillers did not kill their pain \u2014 but killed them.\n\nIn less than three years, however, President Trump has delivered what a lifetime of election cycles and career politicians couldn\u2019t \u2014 and he did it just in time to stop the radical Democrats from not just gutting Medicare, but giving it away as \u201ca universal human right\u201d to clear a \"path to healthcare for all Americans\u201d \u2014 while dumping Granny off a cliff to make room for illegal immigrants.\n\nSo long as Donald Trump is president, no one is going to be pushed around. Unlike the Do-Nothing Democrats, this president does not respond to the power of the purse because he is returning power to the people.\n\nTo stop the politicization of healthcare and accelerate personalization, President Trump recently signed an Executive Order on Protecting and Improving Medicare for Our Nation\u2019s Seniors, which protects seniors from a hostile takeover of their healthcare while empowering them to take back control of their own medical decisions.\n\n\u201cWe have to reject the socialist model that rations care, restricts access, slashes quality, and forces patients onto endless waitlists,\u201d the president declared. \u201cInstead, we believe in freedom. We believe in choice. We believe in the highest standard of care in the world.\u201d\n\nIn addition to protecting patients from the pillagers intent on turning \u201cMedicare for All\u201d into medical care for none, President Trump is fighting to:\n\nExponentially and sustainably improve Medicare by providing more choices with additional plans, allowing patients more quality time with their doctors during appointments.\n\nStreamline the approval process for life-saving and rehabilitative treatments.\n\nReduce regulations and increase transparency while establishing a firm link between payment and value.\n\nEliminate billions of dollars in waste, fraud, and abuse.\n\nAs every American knows, healthcare is not about rhetoric, but results. It\u2019s not about universally insuring, but individually ensuring the right to the highest quality of care delivered under budget and ahead of schedule.\n\nForgotten for decades, America\u2019s seniors and their families are now enjoying the record-setting results the President is delivering by reforming bloated government-run programs and reshaping them into patient-first healthcare.\n\nDo-Nothing Democrats may savor slogans, but President Trump is saving lives by saving Medicare \u2014 and healthcare \u2014 for all.\n\nNatalie Harp is an entrepreneur and Advisory Board member for Donald J.
