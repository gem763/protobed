Japanese researchers have even tested miniature prototypes in space.\n\nExperts say a space elevator could be possible with current technology, especially if we were to build it on the moon. A lunar elevator would not have to contend with the Earth's gravitational force or space debris.\n\nThere are still many details to iron out, though, including how to build such a monumental structure.\n\nVisit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\n\nA growing number of scientists and space-technology enthusiasts are looking into ways to construct a huge elevator, either on Earth or the moon, that could transport cargo to and from space.\n\nIn a study published in September, which has not been peer reviewed, two graduate students proposed a version of a space elevator that would stretch from the moon to Earth's satellite-level orbit. They said the structure could be built with current technology.\n\n\"They're right, and we were right first, that the lunar elevator is feasible technology,\" Michael Laine, president of space-elevator development company LiftPort Group, told Business Insider.\n\nOther advocates of space elevators have argued for years that building such a structure is feasible with current technology and could open up new frontiers of space exploration.\n\nHere's how a space elevator would work.", "description": "A space elevator could make it easier, cheaper, and more sustainable to transport cargo and people from the surface of Earth or the moon to space.", "authors": ["Morgan Mcfall-Johnsen"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d95320678c0cd159e75d576?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
