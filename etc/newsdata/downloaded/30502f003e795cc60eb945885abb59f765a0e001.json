Some can be passed from mother to child during pregnancy or childbirth -- notably chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis. Syphilis can also be transmitted by coming into contact with infected blood.\n\nRead More", "description": "One in every 25 people globally, on average, has at least one of four sexually transmitted infections: chlamydia, gonorrhea, trichomoniasis and syphilis, according to new figures.", "authors": ["Nina Avramova"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/170427163234-condoms-in-wrapper-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-06"}
