Keen butted in again with what would prove to be his final, fatal mistake. \u201cIt is not analytical \u2013 it\u2019s gut feeling,\u201d he revealed. So the emperor has no clothes! For the first time, Keen had conceded that there was no evidentiary basis whatsoever for his scaremongering. He had simply pulled those unsubstantiated opinions out of his behind!\n\nAs I explained during the debate, I can get very negative on house prices, as I did in April 2017 when we projected a 10 per cent national peak-to-trough loss (they ended up falling 10.7 per cent). Indeed, I can conceptualise situations where prices fall more than 20 per cent. But this requires a range of contingencies that do not exist today, nor are they likely to prevail any time soon.\n\nContrarian projection\n\nThe sharp recovery in house prices that we forecast in April this year is coming to pass and on track to meet our contrarian projection for up to a 10 per cent increase in national home values over the 12 months following the RBA\u2019s second rate cut. This is because housing is, as Goldman Sachs argued during the week, a key part of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.\n\nSydney and Melbourne dwelling values are now up almost 4 per cent since their trough in May and June, respectively, and I expect this brisk price action to continue with gusto. In this context, the Reserve Bank of Australia\u2019s governor, Phil Lowe, was right to cut the cash rate to a new record low of 0.75 per cent on Tuesday. The RBA has a legislated mission to deliver price stability and full employment. While the latter objective has been historically subordinated to the RBA\u2019s focus on inflation targeting, Lowe knows that to get core inflation back to his desired 2 per cent to 3 per cent band, he has to first reduce the unemployment rate back down to its fully employed threshold.\n\nThe RBA used to think that full employment represented a jobless rate of 5 per cent. But updated research suggests that it has trended down consistently over time and now lies somewhere between 4.0 and 4.4 per cent, miles below Australia\u2019s current jobless rate of 5.3 per cent.\n\nThe sharp recovery in house prices is on track to meet our contrarian projection for up to a 10 per cent increase in national home values over the 12 months following the RBA\u2019s second rate cut. Supplied\n\nIf Lowe can get the 100,000 Aussies currently out of work who should be earning a pay packet back into jobs \u2013 eliminating excess labour market slack \u2013 wages growth and ultimately inflation will follow. The problem is that Lowe confronts an effective lower bound on his overnight cash rate of 0.5 per cent below which the banks will not pass on rate changes to customers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn this note, the banks were absolutely justified in only hand-balling through half of Tuesday\u2019s cut: as their return on equity approaches the cost of equity, they need to prioritise solvency and profitability above subjective notions of fairness.\n\nThis ineluctably brings one to the conclusion that the RBA has to embrace a broader range of tools to influence rates across the economy, including quantitative easing (QE), which we predicted back in May.\n\nOn board for QE\n\nWhile at the time everyone seemed to dismiss the possibility (it is now the consensus view), it was obvious to us that the RBA would need to cut to below 0.5 per cent to satisfy its inflation and employment goals, which would, ipso facto, require QE.\n\nDuring the week Goldman Sachs belatedly came to the QE party. Its economists explained that replicating the RBA\u2019s large-scale model of the Australian economy revealed that \u201cthe RBA would need to implement a negative one per cent cash rate if it wants to achieve its unemployment and inflation goals over its two- to three-year horizon\u201d.\n\n\u201cAssuming the RBA refrains from implementing negative rates in practice, we estimate that an equivalent amount of stimulus could be delivered by lowering rates to their effective lower bound and implementing a QE program worth around $200 billion.\u201d\n\nOne useful insight here was that the main conduit for the RBA\u2019s stimulus would be a \u201crebound in asset prices, particularly house prices\u201d, which \u201cprovides a material tailwind to consumption and dwelling investment over the next few years\u201d. Crucially, Goldman finds that the \u201cimpact of stimulus on other channels, including the exchange rate, is projected to be fairly muted\u201d.\n\nThis is significant because it tells us that the RBA\u2019s QE program will, as the central bank has hinted, need to involve a \u201cpackage of measures\u201d. Limiting it to just purchases of government bonds to influence the exchange rate is not going to do the job, as sure as night follows day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the emergence of Aussie QE is a huge deal for investors and portfolio construction, I need to emphasise that it is not really \u201cunconventional\u201d. The RBA\u2019s job is to manage interest rates across the economy. Limiting itself to just the overnight cost of risk-free borrowing as represented by the cash rate actually makes little sense given borrowers\u2019 debts price off rates that embed a credit risk premium.\n\nMore precisely, the medium-term cost of borrowing is made up of two key components: the risk-free rate as proxied by the RBA\u2019s cash rate (or yields on government bonds) and a credit spread above this benchmark. There is no use reducing government bond yields if this move is offset by a widening of bank funding costs, which happens every other year. And there is no concern with creating mispricings: senior-ranking bank credit spreads are eight to 10 times wider than before the crisis despite a halving of the risk-weighted leverage on bank balance sheets.\n\nOther RBA options\n\nIn other jurisdictions, like Europe, with less bank intermediation and much larger corporate bond markets (where companies borrow directly from investors), the central bank has targeted risk-free rates, bank credit spreads and purchased corporate bonds to reduce the risk premiums on these securities.\n\nBut in Australia the corporate bond market is tiny and offers no realistic opportunity for QE. This leaves the RBA with several options. It can reduce long-term risk-free rates by buying AAA rated government bonds, which is in practice no different to what it does with its overnight cash rate, just at longer maturities. This will put downward pressure on the exchange rate, which will furnish some stimulus.\n\nIt can then also compress the cost of APRA-regulated bank intermediation, and insist that these savings are passed on to both depositors and borrowers, by extending out the term of its current liquidity operations.\n\nThe RBA lends directly every day to the banking system via so-called repurchase (repo) arrangements, which are secured by collateral banks post with it. This collateral is known as a \u201crepurchase-eligible\u201d asset and includes government bonds, highly-rated senior-ranking bank bonds and AAA rated asset-backed securities.\n\nUnder a repo transaction, the RBA buys these assets and then sells them back to the bank at a pre-set price in the future. It would, as a final simple option, be easy for the RBA to complement its purchases of government bonds with outright purchases of all assets that are already eligible for its repo facilities. Combined, these measures would have an enormous impact on the overall cost of borrowing. It is, therefore, misguided to think that the RBA has run out of ammo \u2013 it still has massive firepower that it has yet to deploy.\n\nWhen I am not hunting housing bears, I enjoy tracking great white sharks through our specialised search and rescue drone.
