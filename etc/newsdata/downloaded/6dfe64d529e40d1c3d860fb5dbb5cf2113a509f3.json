In \"The Terminator,\" he's the machine sent back in time by the world-dominating, super-intelligence force Skynet to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the future mother of revolutionary John Connor.\n\nShot in the eye, Schwarzenegger's machine shows a moment of vulnerability looking in the mirror, before plucking his eyeball out to reveal the machine's burning red lens. The sunglasses are functional, covering the robotic eye, and Terminator heads back to his killing work.\n\n\"The funny thing is, the red light still glows through the sunglasses,\" says Schwarzenegger, chuckling.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger showed a bit of humanity when he was injured in \"The Terminator.\" But then he put on the sunglasses. (Photo: MGM HOME ENTERTAINMENT)\n\nWhile the Terminator and his sunglasses were eventually destroyed, Schwarzenegger returned in 1991's \"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" as a reprogrammed T-800 model. This time, he's a force for good, sent by the adult John Connor from the future to protect his younger self (and mother Sarah) from a new T-1000 Terminator.\n\nSchwarzenegger's first order of \"Terminator 2\" business was procuring a motorcycle and clothes from a biker-bar customer, taking a pair of mirrored Persol Ratti sunglasses in the scene's final moment.\n\n'He's going on a motorcycle, so he needs sunglasses,\" says Schwarzenegger. \"He takes them, looks cool, and takes off.\"\n\nSunglasses are so tied to Terminator that Schwarzenegger was able to riff on the theme for laughs in 2005's \"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.\" His Terminator takes an outfit from a male stripper and dons Elton John-esque star-shaped specs. These don't last long.\n\nThe allure of the sunglasses is so profound that Schwarzenegger, Cameron and Miller debated at length whether the star, now 72, would don them again in \"Dark Fate.\" \"We wanted to play with it,\" says Schwarzenegger.\n\nOne scene in the script featured Schwarzenegger, now a human-like machine called Carl who works with Sarah Connor, looking in the mirror, as he did in the original film. He then puts on a new pair of sunglasses.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger doesn't need his sunglasses at night in \"Terminator: Dark Fate.\" (Photo: PARAMOUNT)\n\n\"(Cameron) loves a good introspective look in the mirror to find the soul. He did it in 'T:1' and he did it here,\" says Miller. \"That was in the script, that Arnold puts on the sunglasses, looks at himself, and walks to the car.\"\n\nMiller shot the scene, but also shot scenes where Schwarzenegger looks in the mirror and decides not to put the dark glasses. \"To put on those sunglasses meant the opposite of what we were trying to say,\" says Miller.\n\nThe director acknowledges that even his film editor, Julian Clarke, chose the sunglasses-wearing scenes initially.\n\nLinda Hamilton returns, with sunglasses, in \"Terminator: Dark Fate.\" (Photo: PARAMOUNT)\n\n\"He told me, 'I just want to see him put the (expletive) sunglasses on and it\u2019s a big audience moment, they are going to be excited about it,' \" Miller recalls him saying.\n\nWe won't say which scene \u2013 sunglasses on or off \u2013 was ultimately chosen. But it's telling that a hardened Sarah Connor wears sunglasses for the bulk of \"Dark Fate.\"\n\n\"Sarah is hiding behind sunglasses,\" Miller says, explaining how Connor has initially lost her humanity. \"She\u2019s a Terminator in the beginning of this movie.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/27/terminator-35th-anniversary-arnold-schwarzenegger-donned-killer-gargoyle-sunglasses/2480133001/", "description": "The final touch: Arnold Schwarzenegger's cool killing machine pulled on wraparound Gargoyle sunglasses in \"The Terminator\" 35 years ago.", "authors": ["Bryan Alexander", "Published P.M.
