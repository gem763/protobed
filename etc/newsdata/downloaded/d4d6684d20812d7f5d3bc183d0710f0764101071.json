Shut down completely. Why bother when the world is such a mess and people don't seem to care.\n\n\"I'm going to take a moment away to gather my thoughts. Thank you to those of you who do give a damn about the world.\"\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nThat post, which has now been deleted, followed previous messages on his Instagram story in which he wrote: \"It's taken me 32 years to understand the impact I am having on the world and I'm figuring out daily what I can do to play a better part.\n\n\"I want my life to mean something and honestly up until now my life's had no meaning. being a part of the issue is not meaningful. Being part of the solution is and I'm striving to do better.\n\n\"I urge you, to do some research, find the compassion I know you have within you to recognise what you are contributing to in terms of what you eat which keeps the meat and dairy industry flourishing and therefore deforestation, animal cruelty, our seas and climate decaying on a daily basis.\n\n\"Go Vegan, it is the only way to truly save our planet today. It can be done so quickly, all you have to do is put your mind to it.\n\n\"I'm sad right now with the thought of where this world is going. Extinction of our race becoming more and more likely as we over use our resources. The world is a messed up place.\n\n(Image: Instagram)\n\n\"World leaders either uneducated or don't care about the environment at all. Agriculture farming is the largest pollutant we currently have by over 50%, far more that our travel industry combined.\n\n\"I'm sad to see so many people, even close friends ignore what is happening daily. Education is key and we were taught that eating animal products was good for us but we've been lied to for 100s of years.\"\n\nThe Mercedes driver recently urged his fans to boycott shows featuring marine animals and called on them to educate themselves about the \"horrible\" things that happen to animals in captivity.\n\nHe wrote: \"So I'm back in Japan, one of my favourite places in the world. One of the most beautiful, peaceful wonderful places,\" he wrote.\n\n\"The culture, the people, the food and cities are wow. But do you know, this happens here in Japan. Please please don't go and support these shows around the world, don't buy tickets to show your kids.\n\n\"Instead, educate them of these horrible things that have happened to the dolphins, whales, and other sea life. These beautiful creatures shouldn't suffer.\"\n\nThe five-time world champion also previously revealed his concerns about the meat industry, and its potential effects on the environment, animal welfare and human health.\n\nHe told the BBC in 2017: \"I stopped eating red meat two years ago. I have generally been pescatarian for the majority of the year and now I've cut fish.\n\n(Image: XPB Images/Press Association Images)\n\n\"As the human race, what we are doing to the world... the pollution [in terms of emissions of global-warming gases] coming from the amount of cows that are being produced is incredible.\n\n\"They say it is more than what we produce with our flights and our cars, which is kind of crazy to think. The cruelty is horrible and I don't necessarily want to support that and I want to live a healthier life.\"\n\nHamilton, meanwhile, will win his sixth championship a week on Sunday in Mexico City if he takes the chequered flag and team-mate Bottas finishes fifth or lower.\n\nBut the Mercedes cars have struggled at the high-altitude venue in recent seasons, and Hamilton fears he will have to wait for a title, which will move him to within one of Michael Schumacher's record.\n\n(Image: FRANCK ROBICHON/EPA-EFE/REX)\n\nThe US Grand Prix follows the round in Mexico before the season's final races in Brazil and Abu Dhabi.\n\nHamilton, 34, added: \"For me it has never been a case of wanting to rush things. Valtteri has driven well all year long, and done well, and he will most likely do a very solid job over the next few races.\n\n\"So we still have a battle and the fight continues. Mexico is our Achilles heel, our worst race of the year, so it is going to be a tough one for us. The last few have been pretty shocking.\n\n\"It going to be very hard to beat Ferrari there. I don't anticipate it will be Mexico where I win it the title.\"", "description": "Hamilton, who is on the brink of clinching his sixth F1 world title, missed out on victory at the Japanese Grand Prix last weekend", "authors": ["Matt Maltby", "Image", "Getty Images", "Instagram", "Xpb Images Press Association Images", "Franck Robichon Epa-Efe Rex"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20569689.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_F1-Grand-Prix-of-Japan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
