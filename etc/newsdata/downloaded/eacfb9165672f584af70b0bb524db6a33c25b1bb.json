Scheduling conflicts unfortunately are prohibiting us from having this dinner at this time.\n\n\u2018We will keep you posted as to when it will be rescheduled for. Thank you for understanding, Lauren and Simon.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe original invite jokingly said: \u2018Simon is turning 50\u2026 + 10! Please join us to celebrate\u2019, under a picture of Cowell as a child.\n\nThe dinner at La Famiglia was scheduled for 6.30pm on 30 October.\n\nSimon has launched the X Factor live shows (Picture: Rex/Syco)\n\nA spokesperson for The X Factor star said: \u2018The decision was made to postpone the dinner yesterday morning.\n\n\u2018Simon\u2019s priority is his incredibly busy work schedule over the next month and this, of course, includes the current series of The X Factor as well as other TV and music projects.\u2019\n\nCowell actually turned 60 0n 7 October and marked the birthday with a small dinner in Los Angeles.\n\nHe is expected to rearrange his birthday party for December \u2013 because why not stretch out the celebrations for two months?\n\nHowever, a source told Mail Online: \u2018Simon had planned a suitably extravagant event for his 60th and had guests flying in from all over the world to celebrate.\n\n\u2018Cancelling just days before has really thrown people\u2019s plans up into the air.\u2019\n\nTo be fair, looking at the menu of La Famiglia, we\u2019d be pretty sad at missing out, with linguine with lobster, spaghetti vongole, sea bream and T-bone steak on the menu at the fancy Italian restaurant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSimon \u2013 who is dad to five-year-old Eric \u2013 kicked off the X Factor: Celebrity live shows last week, so he has plenty on his plate.\n\nThe star came under fire from axed contestant Olivia Olson, who was furious at Simon saving Martin Bashir over her, given that Cowell had told her she could win the whole competition.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
