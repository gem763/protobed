The resonant story of a dog who waited patiently for his master to return, even after his master passed away, is a guaranteed way to tug on the heartstrings of even the most stone-hearted of people.\n\nTo this day, Hachiko is remembered in pop culture references, cinema and a variety of sculpted statues, with the most famous of these being the bronze Hachiko statue that waits outside Shibuya station, exactly where the real Hachiko waited for his owner each day.\n\nThe statue in Shibuya is a popular meeting place, and shows up in all manner of manga and games. And now, as a new tourism initiative, you can buy your very own tiny Hachiko statues to take home with you!\n\nExcept you shouldn\u2019t expect these ones to wait around as long as the statue itself, or even the original dog. You see, these recreations of Hachiko are made from milk chocolate.\n\nWith such beautiful, high-detail replications made out of a foodstuff that almost everyone can agree on, the box makes a great souvenir for international travelers, but even Tokyo natives can appreciate the work that went into this cute, canine candy.\n\nThe box itself is emblazoned with stylish designs reminiscent of the Taisho era that Hachiko lived through, and even the font on the box was specially engineered for the promotion of Shibuya.\n\n\u25bc Designed by local students and based on the work of Shibuya residents with disabilities, usage fees for the font go towards disability support in Shibuya.\n\nOne box will set you back 1,200 yen plus tax, and will initially be sold at the grand opening of the Shibuya Sky observation deck, part of the newly developed Shibuya Scramble Square. Visitors to Shibuya Sky will be able to purchase their box of Hachikos at the gift shop on November 1, alongside other Shibuya-repping products like sake and protective charms.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t make it \u2014 the Hachiko chocolates will be also be available at other department stores, specialty stores and mass retailers later.\n\nUnfortunately, being a dog, Hachiko wouldn\u2019t be able to enjoy his own tasty chocolate treat even if he were alive. Thankfully, Tokyo already gave him the best present a dog could ask for: a memorial statue to immortalize him together with his human owner, reuniting them for good.\n\nSource: PR Times via Japaaan Magazine\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- Hachiko, Japan\u2019s most loyal dog, finally reunited with owner in heartwarming new statue in Tokyo\n\n-- Shibuya\u2019s Hachiko has a new feline pal, and they look absolutely adorable together!\n\n-- Sadly, seven sudden snow Hachikos in Tokyo are probably too cute to be true\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/10/29/now-you-can-buy-hachiko-legendary-loyal-japanese-dog-as-a-luscious-luxury-chocolate/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "The story of Hachiko is famous not only throughout Japan but across the world.
