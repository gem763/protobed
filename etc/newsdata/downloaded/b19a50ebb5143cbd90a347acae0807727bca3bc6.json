Styling by DC Style Factory. (Matt McClain/For The Washington Post)\n\nOn a recent Wednesday afternoon, I found myself in a Washington Post studio dressed to the nines for a photo shoot. Thanks to Rosana Vollmerhausen and Brianna Thomas, of DC Style Factory, nary a crease nor wrinkle was apparent while every hair stood at attention. This was the culmination of an experiment I had undertaken to see how politicians get camera-ready. Over the previous week or so, I had chatted with two people who have coached candidates on public speaking and met with one of them in person for media training. I had also made appointments with two stylists, one to style me and the other to critique my wardrobe.\n\nImage consultants can get a bad rap \u2014 in his announcement video, Trump primary challenger and former congressman Joe Walsh said he rejected advice to enlist an image consultant \u2014 but they are, for better or worse, a reality of American politics. By subjecting myself \u2014 a reporter with a face for print \u2014 to a makeover of sorts from these consultants, I hoped to better understand what it is like to walk a mile in the shoes of politicians who are under their tutelage. (Unfortunately, the actual shoes I was wearing \u2014 $350 Magnannis \u2014 would, along with the rest of my $1,404.50 ensemble, need to be returned to the store, so I was avoiding errant steps for fear of scuffing.)\n\nI started my journey with Beverly Hallberg of District Media Group; she took me through 90 minutes of media training, during which I learned just how ill prepared for television I am. My first \u201con-camera\u201d go earned me a C-minus from Hallberg, whose clients include members of Congress. Hallberg taught me to smile more; correct my gloomy eyebrow slope, which is better suited to saints being martyred in medieval paintings; speak louder and avoid trailing off; shorten my sentences; and nix excessive \u201cyou know\u201d and \u201cum\u201d fillers. By the second take, I\u2019d improved to a C-plus.\n\nRates for the kind of services Hallberg provides start at $500 per hour. Her clients often fear initially that media training is meant to change them, and some consultants do try to turn clients into \u201ca cookie-cutter reflection of whoever they think is the ideal spokesperson,\u201d she told me. \u201cWhat I want to make sure is that the camera doesn\u2019t change who you really are as a person.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe author in his usual outfit: blazer, polo shirt and jeans. (Matt McClain/For The Washington Post)\n\nMy next stop was the Silver Spring, Md., home of Rosana Vollmerhausen, founder of DC Style Factory. Over two visits, she and stylist assistant Brianna Thomas spent a combined 2\u00bd hours fitting me with looks they styled for the photo shoot. I learned to match socks to pants rather than shoes, and to pull my pants up a lot more.\n\nBetween my appointments with Vollmerhausen and Thomas, I met Lauren Rothman of consulting firm Styleauteur in my apartment, where I let her loose in my closet. She put my vulnerability at ease by being more cheerleader than sanctimonious critic. I was advised to ditch my signature uniform: blazer, polo shirt and jeans. \u201cThe blazer and the polo are two separate verticals,\u201d she said. \u201cIt looks like you tried to do business casual.\u201d (Her definition of business casual requires a button-down shirt, not a polo.) My pleated pants \u201cadd five to 10 pounds of weight in your seat, and that\u2019s not something that you want,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat that says to me is that you probably haven\u2019t bought slacks in a while.\u201d (She wasn\u2019t wrong.)\n\n\u201cYou want to look accessible, but you don\u2019t want to literally look like one of your constituents, because you\u2019re a little elevated,\u201d Vollmerhausen told me. \u201c \u2018I\u2019m a regular guy and a little better than a regular guy.\u2019 \u201d You can see that difficult balance on display in the 2020 Democratic primary \u2014 perhaps especially in the case of two of the style outliers on the stage. First, there\u2019s Bernie Sanders\u2019s shlumpy self-presentation. Hallberg thinks Sanders pulls off the bedraggled shtick authentically but wouldn\u2019t coach clients to use his hand gestures or posture. To Rothman, Sanders is a throwback to a time when visiting your congressman\u2019s office and seeing a mustard stain on his tie made him \u201crelatable.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s Andrew Yang\u2019s much-talked-about no-tie gamble. Rothman believes his no-tie look broadcasts executive presence. \u201cYou\u2019re having 14-hour days. There are different temperatures, and you\u2019re just being efficient in your look,\u201d she said. (For the record, no image consultant advised Yang to go tieless, said campaign press secretary Randy Jones. \u201cIt might be a better story if that were the case, but that isn\u2019t the case.\u201d)\n\nOn the public speaking front, some people are naturals but everyone needs help, said Sally Kohn, who has worked with politicians at all levels and was part of the team that prepared speakers for the 2016 Democratic National Convention. \u201cThe sort of mystery behind the curtain is that no one who seriously does this and certainly does this well ... has not been trained,\u201d she explained. \u201cI think it\u2019s so healthy for our democracy to expose all that goes into politicians\u2019 imagery.\u201d As we chatted by phone, Kohn checked my Twitter avatar and pegged my aesthetic as \u201cdisheveled intellectual.\u201d I wasn\u2019t remotely offended.\n\nIn fact, conferring with all these consultants made me quite aware of why I\u2019m more comfortable as a reporter than as a politician. The constant preening and tweaking means that running for office is the equivalent of every day being your wedding \u2014 with everyone fussing over you constantly. It must take nerves of steel and borderline megalomania to tolerate this situation over and over again. By contrast, the experience made me want to make myself smaller; rather than wanting to ascend increasingly prominent stages, I simply wanted to shrink into a corner.\n\nAnd yet, I also ended up with a great deal of respect for both the politicians themselves and the consultants who shape them. To those who dismissively accuse polished politicians of being fake, I would note that \u201cbeing fake\u201d is hard work. Constantly putting one\u2019s best foot forward \u2014 even in $350 shoes \u2014 is frankly exhausting. It\u2019s also exactly what we should want the leaders who represent us on a global stage to do. And if they need help making choices, they ought to ask for guidance, whether for global trade policy or belts.\n\nPoliticians have incentive to deny enlisting this help because many voters may view these services as tony. Having been through the process, however, I can clearly see its merits. I\u2019m not running for office \u2014 but if I were, I would proudly pledge to make image and speaking consultants part of my inner circle.\n\nMenachem Wecker is a writer in Washington.\n\nMore from the Magazine:\n\nWhy officials from Colorado to Texas to D.C. are trying to protect lemonade stands\n\nHundreds of people have filed to run for president in 2020.
