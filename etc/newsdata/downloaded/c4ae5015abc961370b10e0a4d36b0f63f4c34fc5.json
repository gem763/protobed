Nine of the 12 defendants, mostly former members of the Catalan government, were given prison sentences of up to 13 years.\n\nThe people of Catalonia have long desired independence, resentful that the wealth created in their region is being redistributed to the other regions of Spain. In 2017, Spain declared that the independence referendum was illegal and moved to suppress the vote. The European Union supported Spain and its aggressive police tactics against those seeking independence.\n\nPep Guardiola posa veu a @tsunami_dem en un comunicat internacional em\u00e8s per la @BBC i @AFP pic.twitter.com/8mWLgbanJr \u2014 Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic (@tsunami_dem) October 14, 2019\n\nAfter the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic, a newly founded Catalonia separatist group, called on people to occupy the El Prat Airport. In an act of civil disobedience, the group also distributed fake boarding passes at the airport in order to cause delays. Over 100 flights were cancelled due to the disruption.\n\nSpanish newspaper El Pais reported that large crowds of mostly young people were shouting: \u201cWe are going to make a Hong Kong!\u201d\n\nThe protests at the Barcelona airport were reminiscent of actions taken by pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong over the summer, when thousands of demonstrators descended on the Hong Kong airport, forcing the airport to cancel all flights.\n\nSpanish police used foam bullets and batons to drive back the largely peaceful protestors from the airport. One man lost an eye after being shot by the police with either a foam or rubber bullet. So far, over 200 people have been injured in protests since the court ruling on Monday.\n\nWATCH: Demonstrators occupy Barcelona's El Prat airport where police in riot gear fired foam bullets and used batons to drive back the thousands of protesters pic.twitter.com/WYMGjcijyC \u2014 Bloomberg TicToc (@tictoc) October 15, 2019\n\nSimilar to the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic\u2019s success is due in large part to their use of encrypted messaging services such as WhatsApp and Telegram. There are currently over 300,000 people following the group\u2019s main Telegram channel and another 178,000 followers on Twitter.\n\nUsing encrypted messaging apps not only serves as a means of protecting the identity of the leaders but allows the movement to be more organic and grassroots-based.\n\nHead of LaBase Communication Studio, \u00c0lex Comes, told El Mundo: \u201cThey get that the slogans from political parties are not as influential as hearing from people close to you, from your family, it adds greater credibility to the message. It is not told by a politician, but your brother-in-law.\u201d\n\nVer\u00f3nica Fumanal, a political communications expert, said: \u201cEverything is perfectly designed. The power of WhatsApp or Telegram is that they generate a pyramid. You start with a group of 10. If those 10 generate other groups of 10, you already have 100. And if those 100 have another 10, you no longer have 1,000, you have 10,000.\u201d\n\nNot much is currently known about Tsunami Democr\u00e0tic as an organisation. The group\u2019s leadership remains anonymous, and their website was registered in Saint Kitts and Nevis, a small Caribbean island nation in the Antilles, further cloaking them from Spanish authorities.\n\nThe socialist government in Madrid, fearful of the separatist group\u2019s rise, has tasked Spanish intelligence agencies to investigate the group.\n\nThe Minister of the Interior, Fernando Grande-Marlaska, speaking to La Vanguardia, said: \u201cThere are investigations. We will end up knowing who is behind these movements of the Democr\u00e0tic Tsunami.\u201d\n\n\ud83c\udf0aComen\u00e7a la nova onada i n'ets protagonista. Canviem l'estat de les coses.
