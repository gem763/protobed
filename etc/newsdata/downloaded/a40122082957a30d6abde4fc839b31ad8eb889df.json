His early tweets contain some typos, including a double preposition. \u201cI had a simple and very nice call with with the new President of Ukraine, it could not have been better or more honorable, and the Fake News Media and Democrats, working as a team, have fraudulently made it look bad,\u201d he writes. A White House spokesman, Hogan Gidley, goes on \u201cFox & Friends\u201d to deny reporting from multiple news outlets that White House staff were alarmed by the call. \u201cNo one I\u2019ve talked to is concerned at all about this,\u201d Gidley says.\n\n7:31 a.m. Trump\u2019s chief adversary, House Speaker Nanci Pelosi (D-Calif.), makes her first public appearance of the day, arriving at an MSNBC set on a rooftop across from the U.S. Capitol. On \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d Day 4 is a special event. Rising sun. Brisk fall breeze. Pelosi has come with a glittery American flag brooch and talking points to hammer like a nail gun: \u201cThis is about national security.\u201d \u201cThis is a sad time for our country.\u201d \u201cWe have to be prayerful.\u201d \u201cHe gave us no choice.\u201d Attorney General William P. Barr has \u201cgone rogue.\u201d The bottom line: \u201cThe president of the United States used taxpayer dollars to shake down the leader of another country for his own political gain. The rest of it is ancillary.\u201d\n\n8:29 a.m. Trump calls on Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) to resign and \u201cbe investigated\u201d for reading a fake transcript of the president\u2019s call with Ukraine at a hearing yesterday. In Trump\u2019s telling, Schiff was \u201csupposedly reading the exact transcribed version\u201d and \u201cGOT CAUGHT.\u201d Schiff, who as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee is emerging as a key point person in the impeachment drama, had actually been a bit more nuanced. He introduced the fabulism by calling it \u201cthe essence of what the president communicates.\u201d The moment was nonetheless potentially misleading, especially because sound bites are regularly chopped without context on social media.\n\n9:04 a.m. The White House releases a memo headlined, \u201cThe swamp is beyond parody, but the American people aren\u2019t laughing.\u201d The argument is that Democrats are spending their time on a \u201cpolitical circus\u201d instead of \u201creal, pressing concerns\u201d such as strong border security, real gun safety, affordable prescription drug prices and a new North American trade deal. \u201cYou can\u2019t make this stuff up,\u201d the memo reads.\n\n10:20 a.m. Not much happening at the moment. A good time to catch up on the stories you might have missed last night. A Washington Post deep dive into former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani\u2019s efforts to cultivate \u201ca bevy\u201d of current and former prosecutors in Ukraine. A Post visual guide to everyone mentioned in the whistleblower report. The Atlantic\u2019s captivating interview with Giuliani, which Elaina Plott conducted from the back of an Uber. \u201cIt is impossible that the whistleblower is a hero and I\u2019m not,\u201d Giuliani told Plott. \u201cAnd I will be the hero! These morons. When this is over, I will be the hero.\u201d\n\n10:37 a.m. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), whose presidential campaign has been struggling to gain traction, calls for an investigation of the State Department\u2019s apparent role in Giuliani\u2019s meetings with Ukranian officials. She cites Giuliani\u2019s appearance the night before on Fox News, in which he showed text messages he claimed to be from State Department officials urging him to reach out. Harris also addresses a tweet to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, telling him to \u201cinstruct State Department staff to preserve any communications involving\u201d Giuliani.\n\n10:50 a.m. CNN reports the White House had offered a statement confirming a central allegation of the whistleblower complaint: Records of Trump\u2019s call with Ukraine were moved to a separate server inside the White House. National Security Council lawyers \u201cdirected that the classified document be handled appropriately,\u201d the White House statement reads.\n\n11:21 a.m. Former secretary of state Hillary Clinton takes a shot at Trump during an appearance at Georgetown University. \u201cNow we know that in the course of his duties as president, he has endangered us all by putting his personal and political interests ahead of the interests of the American people,\u201d she says.\n\n11:30 a.m. Lara Trump, the president\u2019s daughter-in-law and a senior adviser on his campaign, goes on Fox News to say Democrats are \u201cunfortunately\u201d tarnishing their name and overplaying their hand. \u201cJust because it might not have been something every president would have said doesn\u2019t make it an impeachable offense,\u201d she says of the president\u2019s phone call to Ukraine.\n\n11:40 a.m. The Senate convenes for a pro forma session, which is like opening a store but locking the cash register. Nothing can really happen. Like members of the House, senators began a two-week break today. Schiff has said his staff will continue working during the break.\n\n12:14 p.m. The Post reports that a group of lawmakers in Ukraine are seeking to launch a new probe into Burisma Holdings, the gas company where Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter served on the board during his father\u2019s time as vice president. The younger Biden has not been accused of wrongdoing.\n\n12:53 p.m. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) becomes the last Democratic candidate for president who has qualified for the October debate to announce that she supports impeachment proceedings against Trump. She had been attacked Thursday night on this point by the primary opponent running for her House seat. \u201cThis inquiry must be swift, thorough, and narrowly-focused,\u201d Gabbard says in a statement shared by a campaign adviser. \u201cIt cannot be turned into a long, protracted partisan circus that will further divide our country and undermine our democracy.\u201d\n\n2:17 p.m. The House Appropriations and Budget committees announce sending a letter to the White House demanding documents and answers by next week regarding the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cinvolvement in the withholding of foreign aid, including nearly $400 million in crucial security assistance funding for Ukraine.\u201d\n\n2:30 p.m. The Associated Press alerts that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has previously committed to holding a trial of Trump if the House votes to impeach him. \u201cIf the House were to act, the Senate immediately goes into a trial,\u201d McConnell told NPR in March. The regular rules for conducting an impeachment trial in the Senate are spelled out in the United States Senate Manual, and they include lots of specificity: When the House delivers the impeachment articles, the senate sergeant at arms must proclaim the following words, \u201cAll persons are commanded to keep silence, on pain of imprisonment, while the House of Representatives is exhibiting to the Senate of the United States articles of impeachment against\u201d whoever is being impeached. The chief justice of the United States \u201cshall preside,\u201d and the doors to the chamber \u201cshall be kept open,\u201d unless directed otherwise for deliberation.\n\n3:41 p.m. Trump previews how he hopes the impeachment fight will play out in the 2020 election if Biden becomes the Democratic nominee. He posts a 30-second campaign ad. \u201cBiden promised Ukraine a billion dollars if they fired the prosecutor investigating his son\u2019s company,\u201d the narrator says, over ominous music. \u201cBut when President Trump asks Ukraine to investigate corruption, the Democrats want to impeach him.\u201d Much of this is misleading. Biden threatened to withhold aid that had been promised to Ukraine if it did not fire the prosecutor; he did not promise to give $1 billion for doing so. The Ukranian prosecutor in question did not have an active investigation of the company where Biden\u2019s son worked at the time. Biden\u2019s son was never a subject of the investigation. The Democrat\u2019s current impeachment investigation focuses on Trump\u2019s specific request to the current Ukranian president for aide in an investigation of Biden, his political rival. Such details might get lost in a war of sound bites and paid advertising.\n\n4:03 p.m. The House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees announce a new subpoena of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for documents related to the Ukraine investigation that were requested earlier this month and never delivered. The letter concludes by alleging that Pompeo\u2019s continued refusal to provide the documents \u201cimpairs Congress\u2019 ability to fulfill its Constitutional responsibilities to protect our national security and the integrity of our democracy.\u201d\n\n4:58 p.m. The Washington Post reports that Rudy Giuliani, the president\u2019s personal attorney who has been helping lead Ukraine outreach, is scheduled to make a paid appearance at a Kremlin backed conference in Armenia. Russian President Vladimir Putin is scheduled to attend. Giuliani declined to say how much he will make. \u201cI will try to not knowingly talk to a Russian until this is all over,\u201d he says.\n\n6:09 p.m. Giuliani tells reporters he will no longer attend the conference. \u201cJust found out Putin was going and I don\u2019t need to give the Swamp press more distractions,\u201d he tells The Post in a text message.", "description": "Trump argued he did nothing wrong in his \u201cvery nice call\u201d with the Ukrainian president. Nancy Pelosi said Trump\u2019s behavior \u201cgave us no choice.\u201d And new details emerged in the scandal gripping Washington.", "authors": ["Michael Scherer", "National Political Reporter Covering Campaigns", "Congress", "The White House", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6iPdujho_S4-aZ-ZTnV2qMJw5zY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QVFAZGXBMII6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
