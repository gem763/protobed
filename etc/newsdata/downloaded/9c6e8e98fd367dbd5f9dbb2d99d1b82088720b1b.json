Auction houses in the U.S. and elsewhere are beginning to feature Cubans, and prices are on the rise. Established artists such as Fabelo, painter Carlos Alfonzo, and the mutli-disciplinary Manuel Mendive now occupy auction catalogs alongside 20th century Cuban luminaries like Wilfredo Lam.\n\n\u201cWe saw strong demand for Cuban contemporary artists\u2019 works in our May sale,\u201d says Diana Bramham, Specialist, Latin American Art Christie's New York. \u201cIn recent years, we have [also] noticed an uptick in demand for certain contemporary Cuban artists, such as Mendive and Fabelo.\u201d\n\nAnother member of Cuba\u2019s new artistic vanguard, Carlos Quintana, recently had a palazzo full of his large-format paintings on display during the Venice Biennale, and relative newcomer Hector Frank\u2019s artwork is being featured at an upcoming show from Oct. 18 to Nov. 10 at New York\u2019s Toth Gallery, which specializes in Cuban art.\n\nIn April 2019, after being postponed for a year due to damage from Hurricane Irma, Havana hosted its 13th Biennial. The city\u2019s famed Malecon seawall was dotted with installation art and Old Havana\u2019s cultural institutions played host to exhibitions showcasing both up-and-coming local talent and more well-known players, such as the French street artist JR.\n\nIn April 2019, Havana hosted its 13th Biennial, featuring international players such as the French street artist JR. Michael Magers\n\nBut this growing interest in Cuban art is jeopardized by the Trump Administration\u2019s increasingly confrontational stance toward Cuba, which is making it harder for foreign art buyers to visit the island and acquaint themselves with local artists.\n\nAccording to new data from Cuba\u2019s National Office of Statistics and Information, tourism from the U.S. dropped more than 20% in the wake of the new sanctions. These moves have many Cubans referencing the hardships of the \u201cSpecial Period,\u201d during which the island suffered particularly harsh living conditions after the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nLiving under sanctions is nothing new, though the optimism of the Obama era seemed like the beginning of more openness across the board. Part of Cuba\u2019s allure has long been a reputation for creative expression married with technical skill\u2014a combination that can be seen not only across the country\u2019s more well-known cultural exports, such as dance and music, but also in the innovation required by Cubans on a daily basis to go about their lives under often extreme economic conditions.\n\nArtists are no exception. Hector Frank, 58, is a rising star in the contemporary Cuban art world. An intellectual with a gift for understanding all things mechanical, Frank\u2019s main source of income up until the early 2000s came from his work as an electronics repairman. He painted at night in his spare time.\n\nFrank\u2019s social circle, however, was filled with some of Cuba\u2019s top artistic talent, and when they saw the work he was creating in his spare time and without any formal training, it was clear he had a voice. Friends nudged Frank to continue painting, and he\u2019s never looked back.\n\nBryant Toth, who cut his teeth in New York\u2019s hospitality industry, will host Frank's work at his eponymous gallery in New York. Toth, 31, first visited Cuba nearly 10 years ago, when a mentor and early proponent of Cuban art invited him on a trip to Havana. Enamored with the work being produced there, Toth has visited the island nearly 40 times in the last decade to develop and build relationships with artists.\n\nBryant Toth has visited the island nearly 40 times in the last decade to develop and build relationships with artists. Michael Magers\n\nToth and Frank embody the type of relationship necessary to bridge the gap between increasingly sought-after talent and limited market access, which is one of the unique challenges Cuba presents.\n\nBoth men acknowledge that Cuba\u2019s fractious relationship with the United States can bestow a \u201cforbidden fruit\u201d status to the island\u2019s art. That physically accessing the market is increasingly a challenge (especially for U.S. citizens), and that many of Cuba\u2019s creators are less well-known to mainstream collectors, only serves to heighten the sense one is discovering something new.\n\nThat transactions can frequently happen outside the traditional gallery model, and with few experts or institutions to verify legitimacy, also creates potential challenges. Bramham points out that buyers, \u201cparticularly those interested in collecting modern Cuban art works, should always confirm the provenance of a work and also make sure that the recognized expert on the artist has confirmed the authenticity.\u201d\n\nFor some, however, the difficult-to-access nature of the market only heightens its appeal. Fredrik Eklund, star of the Bravo reality show Million Dollar Listing and a collector of Frank\u2019s work, fell in love with Cuban art because, \u201cit\u2019s more rare, [which] makes it more special, you don\u2019t see it everywhere. Because it\u2019s harder to get.\u201d\n\nToth\u2019s gallery is designed to make Cuban art slightly easier to get outside of Cuba, while also bringing a little bit of Cuban culture to New York. His openings often feature live Cuban music alongside craft cocktails and plenty of opportunities to interact with the artists themselves.\n\nFrank describes the pair\u2019s relationship as one of collaborators more than anything. \u201cBryant wants me to make a statement,\u201d he says. \u201cHe wants me to say something from my point of view as a Cuban. But he helps me understand my market as well.\u201d", "description": "Auction houses and galleries are starting to feature the island\u2019s artists\u2014and prices are on the rise", "authors": ["Michael Magers"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-115309/social", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
