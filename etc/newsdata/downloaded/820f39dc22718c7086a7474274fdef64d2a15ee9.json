He just seemed to take a shine to me. He was called Noosa. He was adorable. I realised I felt something that wasn\u2019t pity or fondness. There was a flicker of something more else there.\u201d\n\nHe discussed adoption with partner David Furnish. In the end they found he was living happily with his grandmother and a sister.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nLater that year meeting 14-month-old Ukrainian Lev convinced Elton he really wanted to be a dad.\n\nIt proved impossible to adopt little Lev but anonymously Elton worked with a charity to get him and his brother out of an orphanage and fund their lives with their grandmother.\n\nElton adds: \u201cWhen the Russians invaded Ukraine, we worked with the same charity to evacuate them to Kiev. We\u2019ll always keep an eye on them.\u201d\n\nWhen their oldest son was born at 2.30am on Christmas Day 2010 that visit to Ukraine was still close their hearts.\n\nElton says: \u201cWe called him Zachary Jackson Levon. Everybody assumes the last name came from a song Bernie and I wrote, but they\u2019re wrong: he\u2019s named after Lev. He had to be.\n\n\u201cLev was like an angel, a messenger, who taught me something about myself. Lev was the reason we were there, on a maternity ward, holding our son, knowing our lives had completely changed forever.\u201d\n\nPrincess Diana\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\nThe pair were close friends until they fell out when she withdrew support for a book raising funds for AIDs.\n\nThey reunited after the mxz0urder of Gianni Versace, and there is one very famous photograph of the princess consoling the red-eyed grief-stricken singer during the service.\n\nBut Elton says: \u201cShe wasn\u2019t doing anything of the sort. She was leaning past me, reaching for a mint that David offered her. The warm words of comfort coming from her lips at that exact moment were actually: \u2018God, I\u2019d love a Polo.\u2019...\n\n...being 24hrs from death\n\nElton has revealed he was close to dying after contracting a major infection following surgery for prostrate cancer.\n\nTouring South America in 2017 the pain became so unbearable he was forced to fly back to the UK.\n\nTaken for a scan at King Edward VII\u2019s Hospital, London, he was told he was suffering a rare condition that left fluid leaking from his lymph nodes. And it was so serious the hospital feared it didn\u2019t have the equipment to cope.\n\nElton says: \u201cI lay awake all night, wondering if I was going to die. In the hospital, alone at the dead of night, I prayed, \u2018Please don\u2019t let me die, please let me see my kids again\u2019.\u201d He was in intensive care for two days but after doctors drained the lymphatic fluid and gave him with antibiotics he spent seven weeks at home recuperating and learning how to walk again.\n\nRod Stewart\n\n(Image: Mirrorpix)\n\nThe two great contemporaries have pet names for each other \u2013 Elton is nicknamed Sharon and Rod is Phyllis.\n\nElton writes that when people joked about his hair loss Rod sent him a helmet-shaped hairdryer women used to sit under in salons. In relation Elton sent his rival back a Zimmer frame covered in fairy lights.\n\nHe recounts a story of when Rod was playing Earl\u2019s Court and the promoters advertised the gig by flying a blimp with his face over the venue. Elton says: \u201cI called my management, who hired someone to shoot it down: Apparently it landed on top of a double-decker bus.\u201d\n\nThe phone soon went. Rod was on the other end and he really did want to talk about it. \u201cWhere\u2019s my f***ing balloon gone? It was you, wasn\u2019t it? You cow! You bitch!\u2019\u201d\n\nJohn Lennon\n\nFirst Lennon was his idol, then another great friend. Elton was \u00addevastated at his murder in New York in 1980. In the previous decade the pair had enjoyed drug-fuelled times.\n\nElton relates one highlight when he and the Beatle were holed up in a hotel suite in New York working their way through a pile of cocaine and there was a knock at the door.\n\nElton was terrified it was the police but peeping through the spyhole he realised it was Andy Warhol and went to let him in.\n\nThe knocking continued but Lennon was having none of it \u2013 asking if Warhol had \u201cthat f***ing camera with him\u201d. Lennon had to ask if Elton wanted to be seen with \u201cicicles of cocaine hanging out of your nose.\u201d\n\nElton obviously did not \u2013 and so the world\u2019s most famous pop artist was left in the hotel corridor.\n\n(Image: Redferns)\n\nwatching porn with his mum at 30,000 feet\n\nIn the seventies Elton used the Boeing 720, which featured bar, an organ, dining tables, sofas and a TV with a video recorder. Once when travelling on board with his mother, she insisted on watching the pornographic film Deep Throat starring Linda Lovelace while she was eating her lunch. \u201cEveryone\u2019s talking about it, aren\u2019t they? What\u2019s is about then?\u201d she said.\n\nElton remembers the reaction, and his mum\u2019s words: \u201cOh gawd, no, what\u2019s happening now? Oh! I can\u2019t look! How\u2019s she doing that?\u201d\n\nPop judgment\n\nElton\u2019s manager John Reid played him a pressing of the hit song Bohemian Rhapsody which he described as the \u201ccampest thing I have ever heard in my life\u201d thinking it would never be a hit.\n\nShopping\n\nDon\u2019t go shopping after a three-day cocaine binge, or: \u201cYou wake to a phone call informing you that you have bought a tram. A Melbourne W2 class drop-centre combination tram, that the voice at the end of the phone is informing you has to be shipped from Australia to Britain, where it can only be delivered by hanging it from two Chinook helicopters.\u201d\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nDancing\n\nThe 1983 song I\u2019m Still Standing was a song requiring a confident video. Helicopter shots were planned with body-painted dancers and Elton cruising in a Bentley.\n\nNot only that but Arlene Phillips \u2013 later a Strictly Come Dancing judge \u2013 would choreograph the dancing.\n\nElton was keen to show off his moves honed at Studio 54. But he says: \u201cVisibly stunned Arlene went pale and suddenly scaled down my \u00adinvolvement in that side of things.\u201d\n\nIn the end all he was left to do was click his fingers...\n\nTerrifying Iggy Pop\n\n(Image: GETTY)\n\nIt was 1973 and Elton had been to see The Stooges at a club called Richards in Atlanta in the US. He thought it was \u201cjust the greatest thing I\u2019d ever seen\u201d, so went again the following night\u2026 this time dressed as a gorilla.\n\nHe thought it would be amusing and add to the chaotic performance.\n\nInstead he says he learned one vital fact about surprising stars while dressed as an ape. He says: \u201cAlways check to see whether or not the person you\u2019re surpassing has taken so much acid before the show they\u2019re unable to differentiate between a man in a gorilla costume and a gorilla.\u201d\n\nInstead of finding ape-man Elton hilarious, Iggy Pop screamed and ran away terrified.", "description": "The Rocket Man's latest autobiography, titled 'Me', details everything from Elton's misadventures and mishaps to indiscreet tales about his friends \u2013 made up of the most famous names on the planet", "authors": ["Steve Myall", "Image", "Getty Images For Ejaf", "Reuters", "Mirrorpix", "Redferns", "Pa", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20531919.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_23rd-Annual-Elton-John-AIDS-Foundation-Academy-Awards-Viewing-Party-Inside.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
