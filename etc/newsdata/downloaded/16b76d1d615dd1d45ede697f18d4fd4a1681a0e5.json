It kinda just matches us,\u201d Snodsmith told BuzzFeed. \u201cWe just like to have fun.\u201d\n\nBut the couple\u2019s actual engagement photos turned out to be a long way from what they envisioned, as Hewett, 23, explained on Twitter.\n\nSo me and Alyssa took our engagements pictures yesterday. She found a Pinterest picture that she wanted to try and recreate\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI botched it pic.twitter.com/oSSUCB4o6A \u2014 Big Stack Dibbles Jr (@collinhewett17) October 20, 2019\n\nHewett takes full blame for the Champagne spillage.\n\n\u201cI was trying so hard to pour it slowly that when it started to kind of trickle out at the end, I over-adjusted and it came pouring out all over her,\u201d he told Time.\n\nSnodsmith told EliteDaily the spill happened 10 minutes into the picture-taking session, \u201cso I thought my makeup and hair was going to be ruined for the rest of the photo shoot. But it wasn\u2019t!\u201d\n\nFortunately, she brought a second outfit!\n\nOf course, photo fails are fail-safe on Twitter. Accordingly, Hewett\u2019s post made a big splash, being liked nearly a half-million times since he posted the pics on Sunday.\n\nThe reaction was strong enough that Snodsmith chimed in a few hours later.\n\nSnodsmith said she\u2019s happy the couple\u2019s bubbly moment is immortalized forever, and promised the pictures \u201cabsolutely\u201d will be framed in their future home.\n\n\u201cKnowing our friends and family, they will probably broadcast them at our bridal showers and our wedding,\u201d she told EliteDaily.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect Hewett and Snodsmith to reenact the Champagne photos when their wedding takes place next summer in Grand Rapids, Michigan.", "description": "Collin Hewett and Alyssa Snodsmith envisioned a romantic picture of him pouring Champagne into her mouth.
