Here\u2019s a bit of the one published today by the Financial Times (the others are at Bloomberg and Yahoo):\n\nThat disparity between the soaring rhetoric that powered his sweeping victory in 2015 \u2014 \u201csunny ways\u201d and \u201cdoing politics differently\u201d \u2014 and his performance over the ensuing four years has come to haunt Mr Trudeau. \u201cIf you set yourself up to be a paragon of virtue and lord it over everyone, you need to continue to be virtuous,\u201d said Lydia Miljan, an associate professor of political science at the University of Windsor, who draws a direct line from Mr Trudeau\u2019s handling of the SNC controversy to his troubles now. \u201cWhen the mighty fall, they fall hard.\u201d\n\nMired in two scandals, one professional and one personal, Trudeau has decided his best bet is to run against two people who aren\u2019t in the race: Donald Trump and Doug Ford, the brother of deceased former Mayor of Toronto Rob Ford.\n\nHe isn\u2019t running for federal office, but Doug Ford\u2019s name is everywhere in and around Canada\u2019s largest city: in local debates, on doorsteps as candidates canvas and in attack ads\u2026 Ragging on Ford has become Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s favorite pastime. Last week, he mentioned Ford seven times in about 30 minutes \u2014 equaling references to Conservative leader Andrew Scheer \u2014 during a campaign stop in Markham, a suburb in the Greater Toronto Area, or GTA. This bellwether battleground has about as many seats in Parliament as the entire province of Alberta, making it key to forming a majority government.\n\nThere\u2019s a strategy behind this. Trudeau believes his survival will depend on winning the suburbs around Toronto, areas he won easily four years ago. But his fortunes have declined since then, so now he\u2019s running a campaign trying to frighten Canadians away from voting for his opponent. Another target of that campaign is President Trump:\n\nTrudeau has avoided criticizing the American president, but after weeks of stagnant poll numbers, he embraced the role of Trump\u2019s foil, saying he is the only candidate who can stand up to Trump and \u201cthe forces of populism and chaos around the world.\u201d \u201cThe challenge for Trudeau always was trying to keep this big, high-profile, international expectation that he\u2019s Obama\u2019s successor, the progressive hero of the global world,\u201d said Ian Brodie, former chief of staff to Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper. \u201cWith Trump, being the inheritor of Obama\u2019s progressive mantle doesn\u2019t do any good.\u201d\n\nTrudeau got an assist in his role as Obama\u2019s successor this week when Obama himself endorsed him. The Associated Press points out the hint of desperation behind this:\n\nSensing Trudeau is now in trouble, Barack Obama made an unprecedented endorsement by a former American president, urging Canadians to re-elect Trudeau and describing him as a hard-working, effective leader who takes on big issues like climate change.\n\nTrudeau was asked if he had requested that endorsement and he didn\u2019t deny it. So the desperation didn\u2019t arise with Obama, it\u2019s coming from within Trudeau\u2019s own camp.\n\nSo what do the polls say? They have shown a tight race for weeks but today Toronto Sun opinion columnist says Trudeau\u2019s chance of pulling out a win is looking slim:\n\nLooking at all the polling available, Scheer and his Conservatives will win the most seats come Monday. That includes the latest polling done for the Toronto Sun as part of the DART & Maru/Blue Voice Canada Poll. Nationally, this poll puts the Conservatives ahead of the Liberals with a four-point lead. DART has Scheer\u2019s party at 33% voter support compared to 29% for Justin Trudeau\u2019s Liberals and 21% for Jagmeet Singh\u2019s NDP. The Greens come in at 7% and the People\u2019s Party at 2%. \u201cThe polling suggests a minority parliament for either the Conservatives or the Liberals, dependent on two major factors \u2014 voter turnout and geography,\u201d said pollster John Wright, a partner at DART.\n\nUsually the party that wins the most seats forms the government by forming a coalition with one of the smaller parties, but NDP leader Jagmeet Singh has already said he won\u2019t form a government with the conservatives. So there are a lot of wrinkles left to iron out next week, but it appears to be dawning on many people this week that Trudeau is in real trouble. We\u2019ll find out Monday if the experts and the polls were correct. As we saw here in 2016, that\u2019s not always the case.", "description": "\"When the mighty fall, they fall hard.\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Trudeau-2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
