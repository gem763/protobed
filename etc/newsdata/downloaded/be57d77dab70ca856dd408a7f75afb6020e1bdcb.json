Mbappe made his return from a thigh injury in the 82nd minute as he replaced Pablo Sarabia, scoring with a low shot from inside the box six minutes later. One minute into added time, Icardi netted for the third match in a row when he tapped in from Mbappe\u2019s cross.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Angel Di Maria once again proved his worth with a double that earned Paris St Germain a 4-1 win at Nice and a five-point lead in the Ligue 1 standings on Friday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2698511-55792530-2560-1440.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
