So, Larson will be the only driver unfazed by whatever may happen this weekend at Talladega, the final superspeedway race of the year, followed by the second-round elimination race at Kansas Speedway in two weeks.\n\nHowever, both he and Johnston made it clear they aren\u2019t about to start mailing it in.\n\n\u201cWe still have to try to put points on the board, whether it\u2019s bonus points or race-win points,\u201d said Johnston. \u201cThere are a lot of guys that have five, six wins and a lot of bonus points that are going to roll over to that next stage; so anything we can do to close the gap on that \u2026 Martinsville being in that last round, that\u2019s not the greatest place for us; but we feel like Texas and Phoenix are places we can win at.\n\n\u201cI think our focus is going to be on what can we do better going to Martinsville to make sure we have a solid run there and leave there with the most points that we can,\u201d Johnston added.\n\nKyle Larson became the first driver to advance to the Round of 8 after his win Sunday at Dover International Speedway.

Earning max points each week is still the focus, and having a strong run at Kansas could potentially result in learning something the team could translate to Texas.\n\n\u201cPhoenix with the repave races a lot like an intermediate, so I think there\u2019s still a lot you can learn by going to Kanas and being strong. But I think, more than anything, just keep executing by trying to come out of each and every weekend with the most points possible,\u201d said Johnston. \u201cI don\u2019t think taking our eye off of that prize is probably the right thing to do at this point for us.\u201d\n\nDover was a timely victory in more ways than one \u2014 not just in taking the pressure off Larson but in terms of points. A victory bumped Larson\u2019s playoff point total from six to 11. Playoff points are always a big emphasis for playoff teams as they have proven to be valuable in the quest to make it to the title race in Miami.\n\nOPINION: Did failure to make playoffs cost Stenhouse his ride?\n\nBOWMAN: Doesn't really care that Wallace threw a drink in his face\n\nCHAMPIONSHIP CONTENDERS: Meet the 2019 playoff drivers\n\nSeven drivers have more playoff points than Larson, including Kyle Busch who has 46, Martin Truex Jr. with 42, and Denny Hamlin with 31. Given that, Larson didn\u2019t fall into the trap of saying he\u2019s now a title favorite.\n\n\u201cDepending on who makes it out of this round, I\u2019m still going to be a ways back on points to Martin, Kyle, Kevin (Harvick) and Joey (Logano) to start the next round,\u201d Larson said. \u201cTo start today, I would be like 18 points back of (Brad) Keselowski, so that\u2019s still a lot to overcome. It\u2019s going to be even bigger probably to start the next round.\n\n\u201cBut Texas \u2014 we could go there and win. We could go to Phoenix and have a good shot to win. Martinsville, hopefully, we can go have a good run there.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see,\u201d Larson continued. \u201cIt\u2019s just nice to get a win, get some playoff points and just kind of chip away at the deficit that we\u2019re in compared to those guys.\u201d\n\nMartinsville, Texas, and ISM Raceway (near Phoenix) make up the Round of 8. All are tracks that Larson has not won at before, and Martinsville seems to be the team\u2019s biggest concern. Larson finished 18th there earlier this year and has just one top-10 finish in 11 starts at the Virginia track (third in the spring 2016 race).\n\nLarson has four top-10 finishes in 12 starts at Texas. He finished 39th in the spring race after crashing midway through the race. Of the three tracks, Larson has the best average finish at ISM (13.5) where he\u2019s earned five top-10 finishes in 11 starts and will go there with two consecutive top-six finishes.", "description": "Kyle Larson and the rest of the No. 42 Chip Ganassi Racing team might be stress-free for the next few weeks, but there is still a job to be done.", "authors": ["Kelly Crandall", "Published P.M.
