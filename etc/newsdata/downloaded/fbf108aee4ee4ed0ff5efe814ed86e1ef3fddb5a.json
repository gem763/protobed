She was talking about Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and yesterday\u2019s Time magazine bombshell report that he once wore brownface to an \u201cArabian Nights\u201d party while a teacher at a private school in Vancouver in 2001. (Since Time\u2019s story broke, other instances of Mr. Trudeau in blackface and brownface have surfaced, including a video.)\n\nMy friend was referring to how Mr. Trudeau is seen on the world stage, but especially in the United States, a country that had a tendency to pretend that Canada didn\u2019t exist until Mr. Trudeau came along. And her text encapsulated a distinction I\u2019ve noticed in how Americans have been receiving this story compared with Canadians. For Americans, Mr. Trudeau\u2019s downfall from liberal media darling \u2014 remember Rolling Stone\u2019s 2017 cover, \u201cWhy can\u2019t he be our president?\u201d \u2014 to disgraced politician has been swift. For Canadians, it has been a long time coming.\n\nIt all started back in 2015 when Mr. Trudeau won a surprising majority victory over the longtime Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Cozying up to then-President Barack Obama, the two young, charismatic world leaders had what the press affectionately called a \u201cbromance.\u201d\n\nBut south of the border, excitement over Mr. Trudeau didn\u2019t really reach its zenith until November 2016. Before that, the prime minister, with his self-described feminism and his openness to Syrian refugees, had cast himself as Canada\u2019s answer to the charismatic and cosmopolitan liberalism of the Obama years. Now, however, for American liberals, he was no longer cute kid brother but foil: Mr. Trudeau offered the perfect juxtaposition to the crassness of Donald Trump. Every detail, from his luxurious hair to his stylish socks, seemingly served to emphasize their differences.", "description": "For Americans, Justin Trudeau\u2019s undoing has been swift.
