It was a super typhoon.\"\n\nSong is a professional storm watcher who is becoming increasingly worried about the impact of climate crisis on the towering coastal city, home to seven million people\n\nThe super typhoon she was describing was Mangkhut , which churned its way across the South China Sea, killing dozens of people in the Philippines and southern China in September 2018.\n\nMangkhut also slammed into Hong Kong , with wind gusts of up to 256 kilometers (159 miles per hour). Before the storm hit,the Observatory issued its highest level warning -- Typhoon Signal Number 10.\n\nThe ferocious storm system wreaked the worst damage the densely populated city had seen in decades. And yet, Hong Kong escaped without any loss of life.\n\nIn part, the city got lucky. The storm did not make landfall during high tide, which could have caused much more destructive storm surges.\n\n\"Otherwise,\" Song says, \"the devastation would have been even worse.\"\n\nSong and the other scientists at the Observatory are charged with warning this vulnerable coastal city about the threat of extreme weather.\n\n\"We have no doubt that climate change is happening right now,\" Song says.\n\nPhotos: In photos: Typhoon Mangkhut A man looks out of a damaged building in Hong Kong after Typhoon Manghkut.

Hide Caption 66 of 66\n\nEarly warning systems\n\nThe Hong Kong Observatory was first established by the territory's former British colonial rulers in 1883, after a deadly typhoon slammed into the colony.\n\nBack then, a typhoon gun was used to warn locals about oncoming storms. When it was decided that wasn't loud enough, three bombs were detonated in quick succession at the Water Police Station in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon. In 1917, the first numbered local warning system was implemented, although the typhoon bomb practice continued until 1937.\n\nNow, the Hong Kong Observatory sends data direct to residents' cellphones from its traditional base on a hilltop at Tsim Sha Tsui.\n\nThe building originally offered sweeping views across Victoria Harbor, allowing scientists to keep a vigilant watch, but today it is surrounded by much taller modern high-rises that block the view of the sea.\n\nInstead, meteorologists rely on a variety of different systems to provide advance warning of potential threats.\n\nThe Hong Kong Observatory radar station and two other stations at the top of Tai Mo Shan, Hong Kong's tallest peak.\n\nMountain top radar\n\nFrom the top of Tai Mo Shan, Hong Kong's tallest peak, visitors can look down at commercial planes descending on their approach to the city's international airport.\n\nIt is here, at around 970 meters (3,182 feet) above sea level, that the Observatory operates one of its first lines of defense against typhoons.\n\nThe Tai Mo Shan Weather Radar is contained in a giant white sphere perched on top of a stone foundation. From the outside it looks like an enormous soccer ball.\n\nThe fiberglass sphere contains an 8.5 meter wide (27.5 foot) antennae dish. It is just one of several Hong Kong weather radars, which scan the surrounding skies for precipitation at a range of up to 500 kilometers (310.6 miles).\n\nThere are very limited meteorological instruments over the sea, according to Ray Kong, a scientific officer with the Observatory. \"Weather radar and also satellite are the only meteorological tools for us to monitor the tropical cyclones or some other weather (approaching) from the south of Hong Kong,\" says Kong, who speaks during a tour inside the weather radar's sphere, the echo of his voice ping-ponging off the fiberglass.\n\nRay Kong, a scientific officer at the Hong Kong Observatory, in front of the Tai Mo Shan weather radar. It is perched atop Hong Kong's tallest peak.\n\nStorm drop\n\nOnce a major storm system is detected, the Observatory has developed another technique for gathering firsthand data.\n\nKK Hon, another scientific officer with the Observatory, sends planes over the typhoons to collect valuable information about the strength, direction and pace of the moving weather system.\n\n\"We need special methods,\" he says. Instead of relying on imagery from satellites, Hon wants data gathered from deep inside the storm.\n\nThe mission may sound dangerous, but Hon insists air crews can fly safely over the typhoons -- if they go high enough.\n\nFrom there, they parachute cylindrical tubes full of weather sensors called \"dropsondes\" directly into the typhoon.\n\n\"The dropsonde itself is equipped with a data probe which measures important weather parameters like wind, temperature, pressure and also GPS altitude position. These are then transmitted through radio transmission back to the aircraft.\"\n\nThis tactic allows scientists to chart a three dimensional image of the typhoon.\n\nThe control room of the Tai Mo Shan radar station used for weather forecasting in Hong Kong as seen in July 2017.\n\nThe coming storm\n\nIn the 1960s and 70s, Hong Kong suffered hundreds of fatalities due to tropical cyclones.\n\nBut better building codes, public awareness campaigns and improved weather forecasting have dramatically lowered the number of casualties in recent years.\n\nThat said, scientists at the Observatory worry about what the future holds.\n\n\"We do expect typhoons will get stronger in the future with climate change,\" says Sandy Song, senior scientific officer.\n\nShe knows there are powerful skeptics when it comes to the question of climate change, including US President Donald Trump. In response, Song points to weather data the Observatory has been gathering since its founding more than a century ago.\n\nThe island city is getting hotter, and the sea levels around it are rising. The Observatory has recorded an average temperate increase of 0.13 degrees Celsius (0.23 degrees Fahrenheit) each decade from 1885 to 2018. During the last 30 years, the rate of warming increased to 0.17 degrees per decade.\n\nMeanwhile, according to data collected since 1954, the average sea level in Victoria Harbor has been rising 31 millimeters each decade.\n\nClimate scientists have long warned that higher sea surface temperatures will help fuel extreme weather, including more powerful typhoons.\n\nSong says humans must change their behavior by reducing carbon emissions to mitigate climate change.\n\nOtherwise, weather radars and parachute drops may not be enough to protect this city from the next typhoon.", "description": "The Hong Kong scientists charged with warning the vulnerable coastal city about the threat of extreme weather.", "authors": ["Ivan Watson", "Rebecca Wright"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/191014212933-hong-kong-typhoon-technology-watson-pkg-vpx-00012706-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
