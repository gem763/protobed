It was reported to the FBI during Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation process last year but was not investigated.\n\nKavanaugh was ultimately confirmed by a 50-48 margin in the Senate after multiple sexual misconduct allegations were made against him.\n\nKavanaugh has vehemently denied all previous allegations against him, and he declined to answer questions about the new allegations to the Times on Saturday.\n\nSeveral prominent Democrats, including some 2020 presidential candidates, have called for Kavanaugh's impeachment from the Supreme Court in light of the new allegation.\n\nTrump rushed to Kavanaugh's defense over the weekend, before the correction was issued, tweeting Sunday that \u201cRadical left Democrats\u201d and the \"LameStream Media\" want to scare Kavanaugh into \"turning Liberal.\"\n\n\"Now the Radical Left Democrats and their Partner, the LameStream Media, are after Brett Kavanaugh again, talking loudly of their favorite word, impeachment,\" he tweeted. \"He is an innocent man who has been treated HORRIBLY.
