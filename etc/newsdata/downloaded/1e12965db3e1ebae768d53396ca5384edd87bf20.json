In an auction system, sellers of stock can increase the amount they want to sell as the price goes up. Slack saw the perfect combination of a high stock price with a high volume of shares traded. Traditional IPOs are \"archaic and nepotistic,\" as venture capitalist Bill Gurley says. The direct model allocates stock to the highest bidders, which is much more logical.\n\nWhat to watch: Slack and Spotify \u2014 which also opted for a direct listing \u2014 didn\u2019t raise any new equity capital when they went public. But they can do so at any time, now that there's a deep and liquid market for their stock. And future IPOs might also use an auction system to allocate stock, a bit like Google did in 2004.\n\nThe bottom line: No matter how plugged in to the markets they are, IPO bankers will only ever be able to talk to a small subset of investors before they take a company public. The Slack auction \u2014 just like the Zoom IPO before it \u2014 shows just how unexpectedly large the bid can be when a hot, fast-growing company hits the market. It's silly for companies not to take full advantage of that upside.", "description": "No one received preferential treatment and there was no possibility of scandalous kickback behavior.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/aXpsF-zY76mw1_y7bZUXCr-rkag=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/06/23/1561307716853.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-23"}
