He was fond of narrating that the berry pulao was still cooked according to his late wife's original recipe. He would also never fail to point to a large framed picture of Queen Elizabeth and talk about how much he loved the royal family.\n\n\"He used to have a huge rooster that used to flap around the restaurant. I don't remember its name but I think it had a minor role in a film,\" Siddarth Bhatia, co-founder of The Wire news website and Mumbai chronicler, told the BBC.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Inside India's 'dying' Irani cafes\n\nMr Bhatia, who used to visit the restaurant since the 1980s, also described Mr Irani as a \"canny businessman\".\n\n\"I think the hipster crowd discovered the place a few years ago - they all loved the chatter of this eccentric old man. His charm attracted people in droves in a city where restaurants are known for being a little impersonal,\" he said.\n\nMany past and present patrons of Britannia also paid tribute on social media, and some shared memories of their favourite encounters with Kohinoor.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @ashoklalla Not a MasterChef, not a nouveau food blogger or influencer, yet he won hearts and legions of happy, customers through his endearing food & storied banter as he ran Ballard Estate's Britannia for 7+ decades.\n\n\n\nBoman Rashid Kohinoor, you've earned your rest at 97.

If you went slightly inside, you would see the place was filthy, but it was what I called an 'Instagrammable restaurant' - the food, the ambience and the man were all major attractions,\" Mr Bhatia said.\n\n\"Mumbai will miss him\".", "description": "The iconic owner of Britannia restaurant met the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge after a viral campaign.", "authors": ["Ayeshea Perera", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/AD13/production/_108970344_gettyimages-519810942.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
