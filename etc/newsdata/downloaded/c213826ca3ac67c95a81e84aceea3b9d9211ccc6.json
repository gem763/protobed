Kamala D. Harris Saturday for skipping the event and said he\u2019s done more for black Americans than she ever will.\n\nCalling the California Democrat a \u201cbadly failing presidential candidate,\u201d the president said she is ducking the \u201cvery wonderful largely African American event today because yesterday I received a major award, at the same event, for being able to produce & sign into law major Criminal Justice Reform legislation, which will greatly help the African American community (and all other communities),\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted.\n\nMs. Harris responded to the president Saturday on Twitter, \u201cMy whole life I\u2019ve fought for justice and for the people \u2014 something you\u2019d know nothing about. The only part of criminal justice you can claim credit for is the \u2018criminal\u2019 part.\u201d\n\nShe did attend the forum Saturday, after initially backing out in protest of an award that Mr. Trump received.\n\nMs. Harris asked attendees, \u201cWhat do we have in Donald Trump? Someone who dares \u2014 dares \u2014 to use the word \u2018lynching,\u2019 with the blood that has been poured on the soil of South Carolina and so many places, and dares to talk about his victimization?\u201d\n\nThe president referred this week to House Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry as a lynching. At the conference, he said he sympathized with others who have been victims of prosecutorial abuse.\n\nMs. Harris added, \u201cLet\u2019s also be clear that anybody walking into a courtroom today does not have the ability to fire a prosecutor. And yet he tried to fire [special counsel Robert] Mueller, and he fired [FBI Director James] Comey.\u201d\n\nThe president spoke Friday at the Presidential Justice Forum in Columbia, South Carolina, at Benedict College, a historically black institution. He received the Bipartisan Justice Award, presented by Matthew Charles, one of the first prisoners freed by the First Step Act earlier this year after serving three years in prison.\n\n\u201cI would not be a free man today if Donald J. Trump had not supported and signed the First Step Act,\u201d he said. Referring to his work on criminal-justice reform, Mr. Trump tweeted, \u201cThis and best unemployment numbers EVER is more than Kamala will EVER be able to do for African Americans!\u201d\n\nSeveral other Democratic presidential candidates, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Indiana, are attending the event this weekend. Ms. Harris is a former California state attorney general.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
