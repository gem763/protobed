After all, they\u2019re hard to replace due to their sentimental value and usually, they\u2019re quite pricey too.\n\nOne woman was absolutely distraught after she accidentally binned her ring during a clear out.\n\nJo Carter from Monmouthshire, south-east Wales, was used to keeping her \u00a33,000 engagement ring in an old candle in the bathroom.\n\nBut when she had a massive tidy, she disastrously threw the candle out.\n\nThe 36-year-old burst in to tears and confided in husband Craig Carter, 38, who alerted the Five Lane Household Waste and Recycling Centre.\n\nThe next day, two workers, named as Rhys and Darren, had to rummage through hundreds of bags of waste to find the missing ring.\n\nBeing the supportive husband he is, Craig was there to help the bin men identify the right one.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOnce Craig spotted a familiar black bag, Rhys and Darren ripped it open and lo and behold \u2013 a shiny band with lots of sentimental value was inside.\n\nThe ring in question (Picture: Wales news service)\n\nJo was delighted with the outcome and the help of the bin men who searched for 45 minutes.\n\nShe said: \u2018It has huge sentimental value and is also very expensive and not insured.\n\n\u2018My husband Craig went to the tip and two amazing human beings trawled through hundreds of bags to find it. Their kindness and good hearts have had me in tears.\n\n\u2018I thank them from the bottom of my heart. What a community we live in. Thank you to Rhys and Darren.\u2019\n\nMonmouthshire Councillor Jane Pratt said: \u2018I am exceptionally proud of our staff at our Five Lanes Household Waste and Recycling Centre for helping bring a happy ending to this story.\n\n\u2018This is an excellent example of our staff going above and beyond to help our community.
