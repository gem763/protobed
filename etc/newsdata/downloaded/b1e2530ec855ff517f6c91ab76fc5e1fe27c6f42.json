At once terrifying and transcendent, the novel received the ALA Medal for Excellence in Fiction and the French Prix Award. It also set the stage for Denfeld\u2019s breakout 2017 bestseller, \u201cThe Child Finder.\u201d That novel introduced readers to Naomi Cottle, a private investigator who specializes in missing children. Set in Oregon (Denfeld lives in Portland), its tone is eerie and dreamy, as readers hear the alternating narrations of Naomi and the abducted girl she hopes to find in the Oregon wilderness.\n\nNaomi Cottle returns in Denfeld\u2019s latest novel, \u201cThe Butterfly Girl.\u201d This time, she\u2019s in search of her younger sister. As children, Naomi and her sister were abducted and held prisoner for several years. Only Naomi managed to escape. Ever since, she has been haunted by her sister\u2019s fate: Did she survive to adulthood? Who was their captor?\n\nNaomi focuses her search on Portland. There she crosses paths with Celia, an 11-year-old runaway who has fled sexual abuse at the hands of her heroin-addicted mother\u2019s vile partner, Teddy. Like Naomi, Celia had abandoned her own younger sister when she left home. Celia now takes refuge in a ravine beneath a highway overpass with other homeless children who dumpster dive for food and prostitute themselves for a few dollars or the promise of a hot meal or drugs. During the day, Celia finds solace in the city library, absorbed by natural history books about butterflies. Sometimes, she returns home to check on her sister, Alyssa, and their mother, always leaving before the violent and predatory Teddy returns.\n\nAs in \u201cThe Child Finder,\u201d the tale unfolds from the perspectives of an imperiled girl; her captor; and the dogged, damaged Naomi. The cynical, steadfast, streetwise Celia does much of the novel\u2019s heavy lifting. Bright and devoid of self-pity, Celia is bent on saving her sister. Having seen her accusations against Teddy dismissed, she steels herself to rescue Alyssa from Teddy\u2019s predations, knowing all too well what she\u2019s up against.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nAs Naomi observes: \u201cPeople act as if reporting childhood sexual abuse solved the problem, but Naomi knew that most cases didn\u2019t end in conviction. What no one talked about was what life was like for the victims after acquittal.\u201d\n\nDenfeld reminds us that storytelling remains one of the most powerful means we have of confronting our darkest human impulses, and sometimes overcoming them. It\u2019s unfortunate that this time, while her pacing is swift, her prose, unfortunately, is often workmanlike, lacking the sheer bravura strangeness of the previous novel.\n\nNaomi, intent on both her missing sister and the increasingly vulnerable Celia, too often seems merely diligent than indefatigable. The tale\u2019s resolution relies heavily on coincidences, a few of which strain even a seasoned suspense reader\u2019s credulity. Still, few people write as well about childhood sexual trauma as Denfeld does \u2014 its origins, the legacy that can extend for generations for both victim and perpetrator and especially the coping strategies that victims develop to survive.\n\nElizabeth Hand\u2019s 15th novel, \u201cCurious Toys,\u201d was published this month.\n\nThe Butterfly Girl\n\nBy Rene Denfeld\n\nHarper. 264 pp. $26.99\n\nAD", "description": "\u2018The Butterfly Girl\u2019 explores the long shadow of abuse.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Hand"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/E8iWoLTWILVvS4rljpMtGChGyks=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MAKGO5W6IMI6TMMZ6Y4L6LBUB4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
