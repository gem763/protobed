Iowa's caucus on February 3 is always closely followed, because it's the first election night and indicates how things might go. It's a sign of what lies ahead.\n\nOthers, like \"Super Tuesday\" on March 3, are important because they show a larger number of results.\n\nBusiness Insider previously broke down the differences between primaries and caucuses. In a primary election, voters can turn up to vote for whichever candidate they prefer. There are two types: open and closed. Open primaries mean anyone can vote, even if the person is planning to vote for Republicans later. Closed primaries only allow those who are registered in the party to vote.\n\nCaucuses are when voters head to venues and listen to debates and candidates' supporters, and then decide who to vote for. Candidates often need to meet certain thresholds in order to get delegates.\n\nHere are all the important nights you need to know in the lead up to Election Day on Tuesday, November 3, 2020.", "description": "We've compiled all the election nights for the Democrat and Republican primaries and caucuses that will determine the US 2020 presidential nominees.", "authors": ["James Pasley", "Ruobing Su"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9e4c9e3b33a725d21ee853?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
