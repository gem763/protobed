By far one of my favorite melodies I\u2019ve heard from pop all year.\n\n\"Dream, Girl,\" Hailey Whitters\n\nI listen to this song every day while I\u2019m getting ready. This is my self-love anthem that gives me a boost of sunshine when I hear it.\n\n\u201cBluebird,\" Miranda Lambert\n\nThis song is a warm cup of coffee in the morning swinging on a porch swing. It\u2019s nostalgic and fresh at the same time and pulls on my heart strings.\n\n\"Good Bad & Ugly,\" Runaway June\n\nThis song reminds me of my sweet future husband and makes me giddy when I hear it. I see myself and my relationship in this song so clearly.\n\n\u201cJerome,\u201d Lizzo\n\nI've been a die hard Lizzo fan for years and her vocal on this song just kills me. It\u2019s so soulful and strong.\n\nMore: Lizzo, the flute-playing singer, is back in the studio with a 'really different' sound\n\nTae Dye's picks:\n\n\"Chasing You,\" Morgan Wallen\n\nI love the way the hook of this song means different things. It gets stuck in my head all the time.\n\n\"Cool,\" Jonas Brothers\n\nThe Jonas Brothers were the first concert I ever went to and I am so glad they came back with new music.\n\nMore: The Jonas Brothers are even better now than they were 10 years ago\n\n\"Someone You Loved,\" Lewis Capaldi\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 introduced me to this song and every time I hear it now I think of him.\n\n\"What Could\u2019ve Been,\u201d Gone West\n\nI wish I wrote this!\n\n\"Liar,\" Camila Cabello\n\nI am a fan of anything this girl does. The music video to this song is out of the box and I love it.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2019/10/18/maddie-taes-favorite-songs/2443168001/", "description": "The country duo are on tour with Carrie Underwood and released a new EP \"Everywhere I'm Goin',\" Oct. 18.", "authors": ["Usa Today", "Published A.M.
