According to the source, Loughlin, 55, wants to see how Huffman deals with her time behind bars. \u201cShe wants to debrief Felicity after jail to find out what it was like and what her advice would be,\u201d says the source. \u201cShe feels like Felicity\u2019s time in jail will be an indicator on her own time, and she\u2019s extremely curious to know how it goes.\u201d\n\nFelicity Huffman | Joseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty More\n\nThe source continues: \u201cShe\u2019s definitely hoping that Felicity\u2019s time in prison will go easy for her, because that will be a positive sign that, if Lori has to serve time, that she\u2019ll be able to weather it as well. Of course, it\u2019s still very important for her to be exonerated of all charges against her. She still maintains her innocence, and hopes it won\u2019t come to that. But if she does end up serving time in prison, she wants to know what she\u2019s getting into.\u201d\n\nOn March 12, the U.S. attorney\u2019s office in Massachusetts indicted Huffman, Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli in the shocking nationwide scam dubbed Operation Varsity Blues. Nearly 50 other parents, coaches, exam proctors and admissions counselors are accused of actions such as paying for boosted SAT scores and lying about students\u2019 athletic skills in order to gain them acceptance to elite colleges including Yale, Georgetown and Stanford.\n\nLoughlin and Giannulli allegedly paid $500,000 to Singer to falsely designate daughters Olivia Jade Giannulli, 19, and Isabella Rose Giannulli, 20, as recruits to the University of Southern California crew team, though neither actually participated in the sport.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Lori Loughlin \u2018Is Remorseful\u2019 and \u2018Has Definite Regrets\u2019 Amid College Admissions Scandal: Source\n\nSteven Senne/AP/REX/Shutterstock More\n\nHuffman allegedly paid $15,000 to admissions consultant William \u201cRick\u201d Singer and his nonprofit organization, Key Worldwide Foundation (\u201cKWF\u201d), which prosecutors said was actually a front for accepting bribes. Singer then allegedly facilitated cheating on Huffman\u2019s daughter\u2019s SAT test by having a proctor correct the teen\u2019s answers after the fact.", "description": "Lori Loughlin Reached Out to Felicity Huffman: Source", "authors": ["Steve Helling"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kTSkaTLmYJfCajZ2Nr1W9A--~B/aD02MzA7dz0xMjAwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/people_218/6f63e683d562b744a47fa40f007634a6", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
