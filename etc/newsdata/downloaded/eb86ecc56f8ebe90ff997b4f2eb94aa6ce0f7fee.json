She spent both moments in front of the cameras defending herself after scolding a young female reporter in what she claimed was a private phone call, dismissing rumors that she is being considered for chief of staff and accusing House Democrats of ignoring due process standards in their march toward impeachment.\n\nIt was a quintessential Conway drive-by, replete with artful political spin and exaggerated comparisons. She said Trump would \u201cprobably have more rights\u201d than he\u2019s been afforded during the impeachment inquiry if he received \u201ca parking ticket or moving violation,\u201d and praised Mick Mulvaney\u2019s \u201ccommendable\u201d job as acting White House chief of staff while appearing to confirm that Trump has been soliciting advice about his top aide.\n\nIt was also the first time Conway has spoken to reporters outside the White House this month. That ended a 12-day hiatus from the airwaves and a month-long absence from the driveway \u2014 where she\u2019s briefed reporters a dozen times since July \u2014 that led White House officials, Trump campaign aides and some of Conway\u2019s biggest fans to ask themselves, \u201cWhere\u2019s Kellyanne?\u201d\n\nThat question emerged again Thursday night in the wake of reporting that Trump has recently considered designating a communications guru to steer the White House through impeachment. Conway, who did not respond to repeated requests for comment, was not mentioned in reports about the role.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s nowhere to be seen and I think that\u2019s deliberate,\u201d said a Republican close to the White House.\n\nIf ever the president\u2019s aides were given a reason to avoid coming to his defense, it likely happened during Mulvaney\u2019s impromptu briefing at the White House last week. Hours after he seemingly confirmed that the White House withheld foreign aid to Ukraine as leverage to get political dirt on Trump\u2019s opponents, Mulvaney was forced to conduct cleanup in a statement.\n\nThe episode underscored the risk Trump surrogates face each and every time they publicly defend the president, but it also illuminated how Conway has managed to shield herself from the bipartisan blowback Mulvaney encountered by avoiding the kinds of details that have become fodder for Democrats wielding subpoena power.\n\n\u201cIn times like this, going in front of the media as a Trump surrogate means you can quickly get turned into a pretzel,\u201d said a person close to Trump. \u201cSo the best way to deal with these circumstances is to be error-free, or just put your head down.\u201d\n\nConway has attempted to do both. In her only two TV appearances since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the impeachment probe on Sept. 24, the former pollster has avoided discussing the mechanics of foreign assistance to Ukraine or the reason a transcript of Trump\u2019s infamous call with Zelensky was almost immediately moved to a highly classified system overseen by the National Security Council.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not part of what the NSC or the situation room does with that,\u201d Conway shot back, when asked about the transcript\u2019s top-secret status by Fox News\u2019 Martha MacCallum in an interview on Sept. 26.\n\nSpeaking to Fox News\u2019 Maria Bartiromo on Oct. 13, Conway, who has repeatedly flouted ethics laws that are meant to restrict executive branch employees from skewering political candidates or promoting party loyalty, kept redirecting the conversation to focus on Biden and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Adam Schiff \u2014 once again avoiding the granular details related to the administration\u2019s policy toward Ukraine.\n\n\u201cShe has a law degree and understands that this is not your normal talking-points situation,\u201d said a former White House official, who added that Conway and others are concerned \u201cabout going out and being contradicted\u201d by the president.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

In televised interviews, top administration officials and Senate Republicans have forcefully critiqued the integrity of the impeachment process by accusing Democrats of selectively leaking witness statements and ignoring the precedent set by previous presidential impeachments.\n\nA resolution introduced Thursday by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), for example, condemned Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry exclusively on the grounds that they have abandoned \u201cmore than a century\u2019s worth of precedent and tradition in impeachment proceedings\u201d and denied Trump the \u201cbasic fairness and due process accorded every American.\u201d The resolution was signed by 44 of the Senate\u2019s 53 Republican members and did not weigh in on the president\u2019s actions that triggered the impeachment probe.\n\nThe absence of surrogates who are willing to repeatedly defend him on substance hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by Trump, who privately pressured Graham to do more to push back against the inquiry as chairman of the powerful Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nSooner or later, the president is likely to notice that Conway \u2014 long seen as one of his most visible and forceful defenders \u2014 has also eschewed attention since the impeachment inquiry began, according to the former White House official.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to be a cheerleader when it\u2019s easy, but when you\u2019re the happy warrior and you\u2019re suddenly not on air, it becomes obvious to a lot of folks very quickly,\u201d the former official said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/59/eb/730876df4380807f7bce15f43d7e/191025-kellyanne-conway-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
