AP\n\nIt stands out among environmental groups by disrupting \"business as usual\" with mass protests that mix doomsday mourning with sometimes-joyful street theatre. The demonstrations demand governments \"tell the truth\" about the severity and immediacy of climate change, and ask them to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2025, years earlier than any official target.\n\nNow, the group's American members \u2014 at least 200 protested Monday \u2014 are importing those tactics to a country where climate-change denial is more common.\n\nOrganisers and onlookers were unsure if the group's tactics \u2014 demonstrators getting arrested, shutting down traffic \u2014 could work in the United States. But they agreed that with climate becoming more prominent on the political agenda here, it was worth a try.\n\n\"The political situation is so different, with people not even agreeing that there is a climate crisis,\" said Jack Baldwin, a news media liaison for the group.\n\nOrganisers say New York \u2014 with its liberal population, vulnerability to sea-level rise, growing youth climate movement, and ambitious new city and state climate legislation \u2014 is a good place to accelerate the group's push into the United States.\n\nAnd Wall Street, a centre of the global financial system that the group blames for the continued use of fossil fuels, was a good first target.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut to succeed in the United States, said Russell Gray, an organiser with Extinction Rebellion, the group will have to improve on its efforts to form coalitions with poor communities of colour, which have been disproportionately affected by environmental problems.\n\nActivists with the Extinction Rebellion movement demonstrate outside the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. AP\n\n\"For people who are just trying to live their lives, freaking out about climate change and wondering what they can do about it, Extinction Rebellion provides a theory of change: using mass protests against corporate power to force systemic change,\" said Gray. \"If it works, it can solve those other problems too,\" he said, like issues of education, health care and inequality that may seem more pressing to many Americans.\n\nMost passersby seemed unbothered and largely supportive of the protest Monday, although one shouted, \"Get a job!\"\n\n\"The cost of these profits is the blood their money is soaked in,\" a man with a bullhorn called out at the corner of Wall and Broad streets, where the imposing columned facade of the New York Stock Exchange overlooks one of the country's oldest streets. Moments earlier, protesters had held a \"die-in\" under the famous \"Charging Bull\" statue, dousing it with fake blood.\n\nAnother speaker blamed \"Wall Street oligarchs\" for the warming seas that have likely intensified hurricanes in places like Puerto Rico and the Bahamas.\n\nA man in a fuchsia paisley tie and pinstriped suit pronounced the protest \"nonsense\", adding, \"Human activity has nothing to do with the sun heating the Earth!\" and then calling the demonstrators \"shills\" for \"whoever's paying for it\". Though Extinction Rebellion recently received a $US350,000 ($520,000) pledge from millionaire philanthropists via the Climate Emergency Fund, organisers say most of its support comes from small individual donations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrading was not disrupted \u2014 most is done online nowadays \u2014 but at least one financial company commented on the protests: UBS issued a statement promoting \"sustainable investments\" like electric cars.\n\nThe crowd consisted of people of all ages and styles: a \"grim reaper\" in a white skeleton mask and cloak; a grey-haired woman in a gauze-and-feather fascinator and a pearl necktie; a group calling itself the Red Brigades, whose members wore red costumes with white face paint.\n\nDanica Novgorodoff, a mother of two and a graphic novelist from Brooklyn working on a children's book about climate change, marched with her 7-week-old daughter, Ada, in a stroller.\n\n\"I want to make sure there's still a livable world for them to live in,\" she said.\n\nAustralian Financial Review cartoonist David Rowe illustrates Australia's climate politics on Wednesday.
