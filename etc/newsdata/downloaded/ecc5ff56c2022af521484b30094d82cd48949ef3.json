President Donald Trump\u2019s critics are crying foul, this time because the American Bar Association (ABA) rated Walker \u201cnot qualified.\u201d Not surprisingly, there\u2019s more to the story.\n\nFour studies (here, here, here, and here) over the last two decades have all found systematic bias by the ABA in its ratings of Republican nominees. It\u2019s no wonder that Democrats, led by Senators Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) have claimed that the ABA rating is the \u201cgold standard\u201d for evaluating nominees.\n\nThe ABA states its rating policy in bold on its ratings website: \u201cIn all circumstances, the majority rating is the official rating of the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary.\u201d Presidents of both parties have nominated individuals with \u201cnot qualified\u201d ABA ratings, and most have been confirmed without any opposition.\n\nIn August 1993, for example, President Bill Clinton nominated Alexander Williams to the U.S. District Court in Maryland. Both the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate approved the nomination without opposition.\n\nOne year later, Clinton nominated David Katz to the U.S. District Court in Ohio. Again, both the Judiciary Committee and full Senate approved the nomination without any opposition.\n\nIn September 2001, President George W. Bush nominated David Bunning to the U.S. District Court in Kentucky. At his hearing, then Judiciary Committee Chairman Leahy said: \u201cNeither the ABA nor the Senate Judiciary Committee expect [the ABA\u2019s] recommendations to be dispositive.\u201d It wasn\u2019t. Both the committee and full Senate approved the Bunning nomination without opposition.\n\n>>>View the Judicial Appointment Tracker\n\nIn May 2003, Bush nominated Roger Benitez to the U.S. District Court in California. After unanimous Judiciary Committee approval, Benitez received just a single negative vote for confirmation.", "description": "Today the Senate confirmed Justin Walker to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky.
