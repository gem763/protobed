He idolizes fan favorite Donald Cerrone in that sense, and while he would like to model his career after \u201cCowboy,\u201d he said he must avoid his errors, too.\n\n\u201cSometimes I can learn from \u2018Cowboy\u2019 because sometimes he takes fights he shouldn\u2019t take,\u201d Vera told MMA Junkie on Wednesday. \u201cTony (Ferguson) and (Justin) Gaethje back to back? You don\u2019t fight two dogs like that back to back. Fight one of them, fight someone else, then fight again. But back to back? It\u2019s not smart. But that\u2019s why \u2018Cowboy\u2019 is \u2018Cowboy.\u2019 I love the guy. Since I\u2019m younger and newer I try to take the best of him and when he makes mistakes, I won\u2019t repeat them.\u201d\n\nVera said he doesn\u2019t believe fighting at UFC on ESPN+ 19, which takes place at Amalie Arena and streams on ESPN+, was a mistake. He said Tampa is a convenient location for friends, family and fans from Ecuador to come watch him fight, and that\u2019s a massive motivation to compete against Ewell.\n\nTo hear more from Vera talking about his goals, matchup with Ewell, potential fights with Jimmie Rivera and Petr Yan, watch the video above.", "description": "Marlon Vera said fighting Andre Ewell at UFC Tampa is another example of him modeling his career after Donald Cerrone.", "authors": ["Mike Bohn", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Farah Hannoun", "John Morgan"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/marlon-vera-ufc-tampa-pre-fight-interview.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
