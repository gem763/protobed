Opponents refuse to endorse an early election unless he rules out leaving the EU without a deal, which could cause a disorderly Brexit, but a snap poll is likely sooner or later.\n\nIt is a risky move. If Johnson fails to carry out a pledge to leave the EU on Oct. 31, frustrated Brexit supporters like Bowkett could be driven into the arms of the Brexit Party founded this year by eurosceptic Nigel Farage, polls show.\n\nJohnson could lose power, the main opposition Labour Party could enter government and Brexit might never happen.\n\nEven if Johnson can persuade the EU to accept a revision of the deal reached by Theresa May, it is unlikely to be enough to appease voters like Bowkett.\n\n\u201cIf that happens, all this fighting will have been pointless,\u201d Bowkett said. \u201cWe will be the laughing stock of the world.\u201d\n\nInside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Inside Politics newsletter The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

But so far Mr Johnson, who also risks losing votes to Labour and the pro-EU Liberal Democrats, has rejected its overtures.\n\nBrexit supporters\u2019 frustration is evident in the streets beneath Lincoln\u2019s Norman castle. Many said they wanted to exit the EU so that some of the large sums Britain pays into the bloc\u2019s coffers can be reinvested in their community.\n\nThey say there are few good jobs, the transport system is underfunded and that immigration is putting extra pressure on local services. Such is the perceived number of arrivals from eastern Europe that residents refer to the road Portland Street as Poland Street.\n\nJohn Roland, a retired engineer, plans to back the Brexit Party. \u201cI feel like we need some fresh blood,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Nigel Farage\u2019s party is trailing well behind the Conservatives and Labour in opinion polls, one survey found that support would double from nine percent to 18 percent if Britain had not left the EU by 31 October.\n\nThe poll commissioned by Represent Us - which is pushing for a second Brexit referendum \u2013 found the Conservatives\u2019 lead over Labour would evaporate in these circumstances.\n\nJohn Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, said a decisive factor in the election would be whether eurosceptic voters have more confidence in Johnson or Farage over Brexit.\n\n\u201cThat could be the crucial debate on which any election might well turn,\u201d he said.\n\nKarl McCartney, the Conservative candidate for Lincoln and the local member of parliament between 2010 and 2017, acknowledged the threat from the Brexit Party.\n\n\u201cWe know if we do not leave... the Brexit Party is the main danger, not the Labour Party,\u201d he said.\n\nFarage, who has spoken at two rallies in Lincoln in the last five months, sees few options for Johnson and has proposed Conservative and Brexit Party candidates do not run against each other in more than 80 of the 650 parliamentary constituencies.\n\n\u201cI very much hope that Boris Johnson will simply look at the numbers,\u201d Mr Farage said. \u201cIf we stand against them, they cannot win a majority.\u201d\n\nReuters", "description": "James Bowkett is one of a growing number of Brexit voters who is considering abandoning the Conservative Party in the next election.
