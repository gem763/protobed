The company has raised a total of $1.5 billion, including three separate funding rounds. It has grown rapidly through acquisition of other brokerages, and was the sixth-largest US brokerage by transactions in 2018.\n\nCompass, which is a high-profile name among a wave of companies looking to put a tech spin on real estate transactions, has had an eventful few weeks.\n\nA number of top execs left the company in September, including head of communications Jason Post and chief operating officer Maelle Gavet. Gavet had told the Wall Street Journal in April that the company was \"not yet at a stage where I have a very clear monetization strategy because we haven't really talked about it.\"\n\nRead more: Compass' ex-CFO just launched wealth-tech startup Harness Wealth. Here's how it's helping advisers battle Betterment and Wealthfront for trillions in millennial and Gen-X assets.\n\nGavet left on September 24 \u2014 the same day Adam Neumann stepped down as CEO of SoftBank-backed co-working company WeWork. According to media reports, SoftBank is now struggling to raise its $108 billion Vision Fund 2 after WeWork did not go to IPO and Uber's underperformed.\n\nCompass hired CTO Joseph Sirosh from Microsoft's AI program last year as part of its plan to build more tech tools for agents and customers. The company says it now has more than 400 software engineers, product managers, and product designers.\n\nThe tech upgrade announcement, according to a company press release, brings the company closer to creating \"the industry's first end-to-end software platform.\" The new features include a recommendation tool and upgrades to its listings map.\n\nRead more: A startup real estate broker that puts a twist on commissions just raised $2 million in seed funding led by an early Compass investor\n\nThe recommendation tool would be familiar to anyone who has perused Netflix's Suggestions For You section. There will be two options \u2014 \"Similar Homes\" will find homes that share characteristics with what a customer is currently looking at, while\"Recommended For You\" will suggest homes that are similar to ones a customer has previously searched for.\n\n\"AI and machine learning have revolutionized entire industries and real estate is no exception,\" said Sirosh in a statement.\n\nThe upgrades also include an update to the Collections feature, which launched in March of 2017. The tool allows agents and customers to monitor a portfolio of properties they might be interested in. The upgrades bring a new design as well as commenting capabilities for agents and customers.\n\nOther changes include searching across multiple localities at once; the ability to see the listing agent for every property, including non-Compass properties; and a map update that differentiates Compass's own listings from those from other brokerages.\n\nRead more: A startup that wants to be a Zillow for commercial real estate just raised $10 million in seed funding from Greycroft and leading real estate players", "description": "This announcement, according to a company press release, brings the company closer to creating \u201cthe industry\u2019s first end-to-end software platform.\u201d", "authors": ["Alex Nicoll"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d9cf8153b33a71e831161e3?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
