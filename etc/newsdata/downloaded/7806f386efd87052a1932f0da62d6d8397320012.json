Where did my youthful terror go? | Grace Dent", "language": "en", "text": "As Extinction Rebellion flooded Whitehall with rivers of fake blood this month, and its youthful members conspired to gridlock nationwide traffic, I was reminded again of a half-term holiday in Cumbria in 1984 when I made and consumed a lot of packet soup. It was the powdered variety of Knorr\u2019s Farmhouse Vegetable, which looked like wallpaper paste with carrot flecks and bullets of salty starch laughably called \u201ccroutons\u201d. Yet the preparing of this soup, the stirring, the simmering and the drinking, gave me a small, temporary sense of comfort because, aged 11, all day and all night, I worried about nuclear bombs.\n\nOr not so much the bombs themselves, but the terrifying end-of-days carnage that would follow, that I\u2019d heard talk of on Panorama or via CND leaflets. I fixated on the matter of saving my cats, Soot and Fred, while the Dents crouched under the kitchen table. Should I put the cats in a cardboard box? What if the bomb scared them away? Would it be safe to go out and look? I cried alone at night, worrying how I could possibly be strong enough to dig a hole to bury my mother when she inevitably died, gasping, of radiation sickness. I fretted especially about what I would eat once the shops had been looted, the factories and fields decimated, leaving me the sole survivor, tasked with saving the universe. This was why I was secretly stockpiling packets of Knorr soup in a shoebox under my bed, rebelling against my own extinction.\n\nAnd although, 34 years later, I am still very much here, for this reason I find it hard to be vexed by the scared young people blocking bridges and lying prostrate on motorways. At a TV studio recently, one starry type, who I will leave anonymous, huffed into makeup demanding I vacate my interview slot so that she could go first, as it had taken her three hours to cross London. \u201cIt\u2019s taken us all three hours, babes. No one is personally targeting you. Buy some trainers and walk if the road is blocked,\u201d I snapped, as the runner attempted to do the green room equivalent of putting a tea towel over my parrot cage to quieten me.\n\nExtinction Rebellion may be, to some of us, annoying little shits, but they do it on our behalf \u2013 and this problem is real. I find Greta Thunberg\u2019s stiff, hollow-eyed and terrified expression painful, as it is borne of a lot of lost sleep. It is the exact same expression I wore as I stirred that soup, full of visions of the end of the world. Each youthful sort seriously ballsing up your mini-break has their own Room 101 of nightmares; of drowning parents, of water-bloated corpses, of airborne viruses, and how they\u2019ll keep their own cats dry when a large downpour finally washes away Cornwall.\n\nImportantly, only youthful types feel so passionately that all of these things go against what is right. My personal terror over nuclear war dissipated as I grew older and more accustomed to the wider truth: that existential dread comes in many, many flavours, and the pure fact is that every one of us will die of something crap eventually \u2013 so hey, better just make the best of things, eh? Perhaps you feel like me \u2013 as you push plastic cartons into the recycling, knowing they cannot be recycled \u2013 and still hope for the best. You know the planet is getting hotter, but on the upside Margate was lovely in late September.\n\nToday\u2019s demisexual kids are swimming against the tide of hookup culture. Good luck to them Read more\n\nSo I thank the youth for their passion, their fury, because my genre of middle-aged gloomy stoicism is no use at all when it comes to any sort of world-saving venture. No one needs me on an Extinction Rebellion march platform saying things like: \u201cWell, sure, global heating is bad, I\u2019m with you on that, but to be quite honest I\u2019ve seen what dying slowly of Alzheimer\u2019s or cancer is like, and one big flood out of nowhere seems like a good deal to me.\u201d Or, \u201cLook, I used to worry about nuclear war, but that sort of went out of fashion. Just like horror about the environment might, too, because there is usually a diverting new terror just around the corner.\u201d\n\nI no longer worry much about the end of the world; instead, I live every day for the tiny moments of joy that buffer the inevitable. We are all dying \u2013 could be next week, could be in 20 years, could be later. It struck me recently, after a decade of caring for my parents, that I am most likely to die aged 85+, plodding endlessly between a dozen contradictory doctor\u2019s appointments, or waiting for a letter for a test; not in a bang or a flash, but waiting to have blood taken, reading an old copy of Closer.\n\nThis week, I lived for the small joys of meeting a nice waggy dog in a pub, which fell into my arms pathetically; a slow-cooker pasta puttanesca sauce; laughing with my brother on WhatsApp about old rave tunes; and booking a ticket to see Judy with Ren\u00e9e Zellweger. I did not eat any packet soup or worry overly about the environment. It\u2019s the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine.", "description": "When it comes to tackling the climate crisis, my genre of middle-aged gloomy stoicism is no use at all", "authors": ["Grace Dent"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2687596bbdb3b57bc1dbf164b0bf0dab6160d19d/0_550_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=88a1d92acccc5707258f38d77a8b37ee", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
