Some of his recreations include depictions of Belle, Cinderella, Ursula, and even Tarzan.\n\nFrom Cruella de Vil to Moana, these are some V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen\u2019s reimaginings of Disney characters.\n\nThe project started with V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen\u2019s favorite Disney character, Ursula.\n\ncaption Ursula as seen in \u201cThe Little Mermaid.\u201d source Disney\n\n\u201cOne day, back in 2011 I just randomly thought I\u2019d challenge myself and have a little fun in Photoshop and explore what the character of Ursula from \u2018The Little Mermaid\u2019 could look like in real life,\u201d V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen told Insider.\n\nThe result was this realistic portrait of Ursula.\n\ncaption V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen\u2019s Ursula. source Courtesy of Jirka V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen\n\n\u201cUrsula is my all-time favorite Disney character,\u201d V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen said. \u201cWith her, I feel like I\u2019ve captured her essence, the way I remember her from my childhood.\u201d\n\nUrsula isn\u2019t the only Disney villain he created.

All of this photo compositing and manipulation are brought together by doing digital painting by hand,\u201d he said.\n\nHe even brought Princess Jasmine to life with his unique technique.\n\ncaption Princess Jasmine. source Cartoon Movies/ YouTube\n\nJasmine is the princess from Disney\u2019s \u201cAladdin.\u201d\n\nIn V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen\u2019s image, Jasmine is still sporting the same clothing and hairstyle.\n\ncaption V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen\u2019s Princess Jasmine. source Courtesy of Jirka V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen\n\nV\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen decided to recreate Jasmine when it was announced in 2017 that Disney would create a live-action movie of \u201cAladdin.\u201d\n\nV\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen said it is difficult for him to recreate newer Disney characters, like Elsa, because he did not grow up with them.\n\ncaption Elsa. source Disney UK/ YouTube\n\nElsa is one of the princesses from Disney\u2019s 2013 hit \u201cFrozen.\u201d\n\nInstead of working from memory, V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen said he had to do more research with characters like Elsa.\n\ncaption V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen\u2019s Elsa. source Courtesy of Jirka V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen\n\n\u201cThe newer characters that I did not grow up with are somewhat more challenging for me,\u201d V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen said.\n\nMoana is another newer Disney princess he reimagined.\n\ncaption Moana. source DisneyMusicVEVO/ YouTube\n\nDisney\u2019s 2016 movie \u201cMoana\u201d introduced a new princess, Moana, who is from a fictional Polynesian island.\n\nV\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen drew Moana to look like a real person.\n\ncaption V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen\u2019s Moana. source Courtesy of Jirka V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen\n\n\u201cSo many requests for this one, and I finally found some time give her a go,\u201d V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen wrote on his Instagram about his depiction of Moana.\n\nThe artist also recreated some of the most famous male Disney heroes, like Hercules.\n\ncaption Hercules. source Panda TV/ YouTube\n\nHercules is a classic character in the Disney canon.\n\nIn V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen\u2019s reimagining, Hercules still has his trademark biceps, cape, and headband.\n\ncaption V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen\u2019s Hercules. source Courtesy of Jirka V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen\n\nAlthough he has a more realistic face, there\u2019s still a superhero-like quality to the character.\n\nTarzan is another character the artist updated.\n\ncaption Tarzan. source Elsie Lovelock/ YouTube\n\nThe first \u201cTarzan\u201d film premiered in 1999 and follows a man who was raised by animals.\n\nHere, Tarzan looks like a real man despite his fantastical origin story.\n\ncaption V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen\u2019s\u2019s Tarzan. source Courtesy of Jirka V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen\n\nTarzan\u2019s signature long hair is also in V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen\u2019s reimagining.\n\nDisney\u2019s male love interests, like John Smith from \u201cPocahontas,\u201d even got the V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen treatment.\n\ncaption John Smith. source Holden Norgorov/ YouTube\n\nJohn Smith is the white settler who becomes Pocahontas\u2019 love interest in the Disney film.\n\nV\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen made John Smith come to life in this portrait.\n\ncaption V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen\u2019s John Smith. source Courtesy of Jirka V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen\n\nThe blonde hair is remarkably similar to the Disney animation.\n\nLastly, V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen turned Prince Eric from \u201cThe Little Mermaid\u201d into a more realistic man.\n\ncaption Prince Eric. source yanjun lin/ YouTube\n\nPrince Eric is Ariel\u2019s love interest in \u201cThe Little Mermaid.\u201d\n\nV\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen said he loves that people are \u201cstimulated or inspired\u201d by his recreations, like this one of Prince Eric.\n\ncaption V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen\u2019s Prince Eric. source Courtesy of Jirka V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure to see people react to these in such a positive way, whether it is feeling nostalgic and reconnecting with these characters on a new level, or just getting a sense of joy in seeing something that visually floats their boat,\u201d V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen said.", "description": "Business Insider - Jirka V\u00e4\u00e4t\u00e4inen has recreated some of the most classic Disney characters, like Belle, Cinderella, Ursula, and Elsa, to appear more realistic..
