REUTERS/Siphiwe Sibeko/File Photo\n\nThe crisis-hit utility, which produces more than 90% of South Africa\u2019s electricity, has been hobbled by technical and financial problems, and implemented days of power cuts last week after a number of its generating units broke down.\n\nOn Monday Eskom said its 2,000 megawatt Hendrina Power Station had suffered a \u201cmulti unit trip\u201d, but that the failure would not lead to nationwide electricity cuts as it had reserve capacity to rely on.\n\nThe firm did not give details about the cause of the breakdowns at Hendrina, one of its oldest coal-burning plants with more than 40 years in operation, only saying it was investigating the matter.\n\nEskom\u2019s latest power cuts, just weeks before a credit review by Moody\u2019s, highlights the challenge Ramaphosa faces in rescuing the firm, whose problems hurt his efforts to restore investor confidence and turn around a flagging economy.\n\nIn statement, Ramaphosa said the return of power cuts underscored the urgent need for action, and the government will do all it can to restore Eskom to viability and tackle its \u201cdaunting\u201d level of debt.\n\nThe company\u2019s debt stood at more than 440 billion rand ($29.79 billion) in 2018/19, when the company reported a mammoth 20.7 billion rand annual loss.\n\n\u201cWe will soon be announcing the appointment of a permanent Eskom CEO who, together with a strengthened board, will be tasked with turning the entity around,\u201d he said, adding the person would be guided by a special paper on Eskom which would also be released shortly.\n\nSpecific measures he highlighted included the long-planned restructuring of Eskom into three entities, improving Eskom\u2019s credit rating and tackling the high levels of debt owed to the company by defaulting municipalities, government departments and individual customers.\n\nEskom said on Sunday that no power cuts were currently planned for Monday, though the power system remained constrained and they could be implemented at short notice if necessary.\n\nThe utility\u2019s chairman and acting CEO, Jabu Mabuza, said last week that a new CEO for the company would likely be announced before the end of October.\n\nMabuza temporarily took on the executive role in May after Phakamani Hadebe resigned as CEO, citing personal reasons and the \u201cunimaginable demands\u201d of the position.\n\nThe utility has had 10 chief executives over the last decade.\n\n($1 = 14.7721 rand)", "description": "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Monday that the government will soon announce a permanent chief executive for state-run Eskom, after the struggling power utility reintroduced rolling blackouts last week.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443376387&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K0DE-OZABS", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
