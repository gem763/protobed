Ever since the breakup was reported four (FOUR!!) days ago, there have been rumors that Kylie got back together with her ex Tyga, speculation that wait\u2014Kylie might actually be back with her other ex Jaden Smith, accusations that the breakup is a PR stunt, and allegations that Travis cheated on Kylie.\n\nTravis' alleged mistress Rojean Kar (aka YungSweetRo) spoke up about the cheating rumors in her IG yesterday, writing, \"None of these rumors are true, it\u2019s just the internet creating a false narrative. Please stop spreading lies & leave him, her & I alone because it\u2019s affecting real lives. Thank you.\"\n\n\"Yungsweetro\" posted something about rumors between Travis Scott and her. She said everything is fake.

Last night he wrote on Instagram, \"It's [sic] really affecting when u see false things said about u once again these false stories about me cheating are just simply not true. Focusing on life, music, and family at this moment is what's real\"\n\nView photos Photo credit: Instagram More\n\nAnd FYI, apparently the reason that Travis and Kylie broke up is that they were fighting a lot, and Kylie was ready for marriage and another baby while Travis wasn't. But before you burn all of your Kylie/Travis memorabilia, know that E! also reports that \"it\u2019s not a firm split,\" and they \"aren\u2019t officially calling it quits on their relationship.\" In other words, there's a chance that these two might get back together.\n\nYou Might Also Like", "description": "He also says that the \"false stories\" about him are \"really affecting.\"", "authors": ["Alanna Lauren Greco"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/_iARaKGSJbowKhKX_yyIKA--~B/aD03MjI7dz0xNDQwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/6701ffca61a529c1d2a7bd7dd54a103f", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
