That\u2019s obvious. What\u2019s not so obvious is that even though both companies do a pretty good job of (mostly) catching bullshit apps, there are still plenty that sneak through because they just toe the line between scammy and barely helpful.\n\nEach company\u2019s app reviewing teams are good, but some app developers know the rules well enough to exploit unsuspecting users as much as they can. And that brings us to this week\u2019s Tech 911 question, sent in by Lifehacker reader Jess. She writes:\n\nA few months ago, I gave one of my pre-teen nieces my iPhone 5S when I upgraded. For the most part I don\u2019t worry about what kind of apps she\u2019s downloading because she\u2019s pretty tame in that area. Which brings me to my question. She downloaded an app called Cleanly - Safe Cleaner and I am concerned it\u2019s there to steal data as opposed to something beneficial. The app bills itself (literally) as a means to clean up unwanted screenshots and blurry photos automatically while also Hoovering up a bunch of other information. Their privacy policy seems non-existent but it\u2019s really on a different page. Honestly, I feel like I\u2019ve reached the part in my life where I feel like I don\u2019t understand technology as well as I should and need a second opinion to help me (and others like me) parse through the app jargon bullshit. Addendum: the age rating in the App Store says 4+ but the terms and conditions explicitly say none under the age of 18 without express consent of an adult. That adds to my suspicions about this app having nefarious intentions. Kids are less likely to read or notice and therefore give up more info willingly.\n\nSo, here\u2019s the good news. I can\u2019t find \u201cCleanly,\u201d or at least, the app you describe with that name, anywhere on Apple\u2019s App Store. It\u2019s possible the developer pulled the app or that even Apple itself stepped in and went, \u201cYou\u2019re a scam, go away.\u201d To give you a quick and easy answer, I think it\u2019s safe to uninstall this app from your niece\u2019s phone. I doubt she\u2019ll miss it.\n\nGenerally speaking, your intuition is correct. While I haven\u2019t used the app myself, and I don\u2019t want to call something a scam without actually having seen it, the general description you provide does raise my eyebrow. I don\u2019t think anyone needs an app to root through their photos to clean out screenshots\u2014especially since that\u2019s easy enough to do via the \u201cscreenshots\u201d media type in Photos. I would be nervous about assigning over permissions to my photos to an app like that (and whatever else the app wants to be able to do as a condition of its use).\n\nAs for the privacy policy, to be frank, I wouldn\u2019t use that as an ironclad defence against scammers. An app\u2019s developer can create a privacy policy, and it can make an app look and sound completely secure. Said developer also doesn\u2019t have to follow the privacy policy\u2014they made it, after all, and there aren\u2019t any \u201cprivacy police\u201d from Apple that are going to make sure a developer is holding up to its end of the bargain as far as your data goes (unless there\u2019s some big public complaint by a bunch of users).\n\nThis is, obviously, less of a concern when a giant, well-known company has a privacy policy, but even then, I wouldn\u2019t take what you find in these as gospel.\n\nThe App Store age rating really relates to the content within the app, rather than the app\u2019s intended purpose. For example, as part of the app submission process, a developer will have to go through a little questionnaire that looks like this:\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the app you mentioned is probably \u201crated\u201d for a very low age, since there\u2019s little that could really be considered offensive within the app itself. And, as mentioned, age limits or other restrictions the app\u2019s privacy policy says have no real teeth on the App Store. The policy can say you must be 65 or older to use the app, and any adult who wants to will still be able to download and use it.\n\nWhere does this leave things? Unfortunately, in the hands of the downloader more than anything else. The best course of action you can take, aside from running through your niece\u2019s phone once a month to check for crappy apps, is to talk to her. I\u2019d give her a few suggestions to keep in the back of her mind when she goes to download future apps:\n\nThink about the app\u2019s purpose. Do you really need it on your phone? Is it doing something that you could probably do yourself, like deleting or organising data?\n\nLook at the app\u2019s product page. Seeing lots of misspellings? Grammar that doesn\u2019t make sense? Something off-putting about the screenshots? Maybe it\u2019s worth ignoring the app.\n\nDon\u2019t take an app\u2019s promises at face value. It never hurts to run a quick web search to see if anyone else has reviewed, talked about, or used an app you\u2019re considering downloading. Odds are good that the odd app you found is more likely to be unwanted than a diamond in the rough.\n\nRead App Store reviews. Does an app have any? If not, get nervous. Does an app have a decent number of five-star reviews, and only five-star reviews, that are all phrased really strangely? Avoid. Let others help you figure out whether an app is legit or not\u2014or trying to entice you into downloading it with fake reviews\u2014before you download it.\n\nConsider an app\u2019s permissions. If it wants to access your camera and microphone, but it\u2019s supposed to be helping you clear out your contact list, that should feel like a very strange request that warrants a little extra research.\n\nDon\u2019t download apps that don\u2019t come recommended. When in doubt, this is a great way to avoid scammy apps: Don\u2019t download things that haven\u2019t already been vetted by other, more professional entities: online reviewers, your favourite tech websites, Apple itself, et cetera. Just because your friend thinks some weird app that puts dumb stuff on your face is worth a download doesn\u2019t mean that you should run to the App Store and grab it immediately. A little due diligence can save you a lot of future stress\u2014and help keep your data private and secure.\n\n[email protected]", "description": "There are a lot of apps you can download on Apple\u2019s App Store and the Google Play Store.
