The chair of Carsales\u2019 audit, remuneration and nomination committee, Kim Anderson, specifically cited the impact of the Hayne royal commission, and the \u201cchanging executive remuneration climate\u201d in proposing to tweak the weighting of Carsales' short-term and long-term incentives, such that non-financial measures increase from 30 per cent to 40 per cent.\n\nEnter the ASA, which has a few problems with the Carsales model.\n\nIn its voting intention statement, the lobby group says that while it agrees with the board that the intention behind the decision to move to 40 per cent is \u201csound in the light of the Hayne royal commission and the strong focus on shareholders wealth\u201d, it sees the comparison between Carsales and the banks as a bit of a stretch.\n\nCulture change\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see this business in the same way as the large banks and that if it is about culture change then the board should demonstrate what it is doing about that, rather than just drop the target.\u201d\n\nThe use of the word \u201cdrop\u201d is pointed here because the ASA does not believe non-financial measures should account for more than 30 per cent of bonus metrics. Which is, of course, a very long way from where the prudential regulator would like to see things go.\n\nImportantly, that\u2019s not the ASA\u2019s only problem here. It has additional concerns about how Carsales structures its non-financial measures, which are vague, to say the least. They include the delivery of certain strategic projects (not named), individual goals of executives (not specified) and the achievement of people and culture targets (undefined).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the ASA rightly says, investors have \u201cno way of ascertaining if the non-financial measures are robust with the current level of disclosure\u201d.\n\nNevertheless, this is a fascinating live case study about the difficulties in getting bonus structures right.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly possible to argue the Carsales board has sensibly taken the temperature of policymakers, regulators and the community, and increased the emphasis it places on non-financial risk \u2013 without going quite as far as the culturally challenged banking sector.\n\nCarsales chief executive Cameron McIntyre. Justin McManus\n\nAnd it\u2019s quite possible to argue the ASA is underplaying the importance of non-financial risk by setting its philosophical cap at 30 per cent, although to be fair, the ASA policy and advocacy manager Fiona Balzer says her group isn't wedded to that and has held discussions with APRA about where the right cap is.\n\nBut equally, the Carsales example underscores the problem with incentive measures of any kind \u2013 financial or non-financial \u2013 that are poorly defined and difficult to measure.\n\n(It\u2019s notable that in the Carsales notice of meeting, the company sets out in 178 words and plenty of detail the definition of look-through revenue and adjusted net profit after tax that are attached to the main financial targets for its chief executive Cameron McIntyre\u2019s short-term incentives. The non-financial incentives are described in three dot points and 68 words.)\n\nIt\u2019s hard to get around the idea that there\u2019s a gap between the theory and the practice here. While there is no doubt the royal commission has emphasised the importance of properly managing non-financial risks, once these measures are tied to shareholder funds they must be treated rigorously.\n\nShareholders are right to expect that as much detail as possible will be provided about the benefits that will be delivered through the non-financial metrics and how they will be measured, and where possible, independently verified and tracked from year to year.\n\nAs Balzer says, APRA's hunger for a greater focus on non-financial risks does not mean it wants measures that are rubbery or not tied to a company's mission.\n\nClearly, this will be a work in progress.", "description": "The Australian Shareholders Association's opposition to Carsales' increased focus on non-financial risk is a fascinating case study on how bonuses are changing.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_125%2C$y_238/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/59b5c4bd8e9e3e5ea6a06a2c009b96e626ff06bf", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
