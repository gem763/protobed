REUTERS/Athit Perawongmetha/File Photo\n\nBANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand\u2019s King Maha Vajiralongkorn has stripped his royal consort of her titles and military ranks for being \u201cdisloyal\u201d, the palace said late on Monday.\n\nThe announcement came just months after Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi, 34, was made a royal noble consort by the king in July, the first such appointment in almost a century.\n\nSineenat had breached a code of conduct for courtiers and was \u201cdisloyal to the king\u201d, a two-page palace statement said.\n\nSineenat\u2019s appointment as consort followed the king\u2019s marriage to the deputy head of his personal bodyguard, Suthida Tidjai, 41. He named her his queen, just days before his coronation in May, with the title of Queen Suthida Vajiralongkorn na Ayudhaya.\n\nThe statement also described Sineenat as \u201cungrateful\u201d.\n\n\u201cRoyal Noble Consort Sineenat is ungrateful and behaves in ways unbecoming of her title. She is also not content with the title bestowed upon her, doing everything to rise to the level of the queen,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cShe lacks the understanding of the good traditions of the royal court. She displays disobedience against the king and the queen.\u201d\n\n(The story corrects spelling of name in paragraph one to Vajiralongkorn.)", "description": "Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn has stripped his royal consort of her titles and military ranks for being \"disloyal\", the palace said late on Monday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191021&t=2&i=1443364021&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9K113", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
