There were tears on a weekend in Yosemite...\n\n'We\u2019d been through nothing like that before. A language of grief and the social forms I was versed in did not seem adequate to the occasion.\n\nPain: The beloved documentary maker, 49, who married the TV producer in 2012, made the heartbreaking reveal in his new autobiography Gotta Get Theroux This (pictured in March 2015)\n\n\u2018But sadness was complete and if I\u2019m honest, I didn\u2019t understand what she was going through. It still seemed abstract to me whereas for Nancy the babies had been real'.\n\nLater, Louis revealed the trauma of Walter's arrival which left the couple scarred, as he said: 'When they raised the baby\u2019s head, tiny, cross faced and smeared like a bagel in what looked like cream cheese and jam I glanced at Nancy...\n\n'I thought \u201cwe\u2019re not doing this again\u201d. He\u2019d arrived after a harrowing - section one afternoon at St Mary\u2019s Hospital in Paddington...\n\n'Nancy looked half-dead afterwards, as pale as a vampire. The procedure had been delayed and delayed for various reasons. We felt like passengers whose flight kept getting cancelled...\n\n(pictured in May this year)\n\n'The same sense of boredom and impotence but also fear. Then when it was going on there was a sense of hushed urgency and conferences. Vital signs were dipping and my mind naturally went to the worst place.'\n\nPrior to discussing the arrival of Walter and their heartache, Louis revealed that Nancy had spoken to him about having desires for other men, which made him realise he had been focusing on work rather than their marriage.\n\nHe went on to propose to her on bended knee with a business card from a Hatton Garden jewellers after 10 years as a couple.\n\nLouis was previously married to Susanna Kleeman from 1998 to 2001, however in the book he confirmed the marriage was one of convenience when she first moved to New York. The former couple met during his time at Oxford University.\n\nTroublesome: Last year, Louis admitted he does not discuss his iconic and much-loved documentaries with Nancy, so as not to \u201ctrouble\u201d her (pictured in a promo shot for 2003's Louis And The Brothel)\n\nLast year, Louis admitted he does not discuss his iconic and much-loved documentaries with Nancy, so as not to \u201ctrouble\u201d her.\n\nHe said: 'One of the things my wife has to deal with is that when we\u2019re in company, the conversation revolves around my work almost to a disproportionate extent, so when I get home she\u2019s not, like, \u2018Well, what happened today on the mother and baby unit, darling?\u2019 I don\u2019t always trouble her with the details.'\n\nBefore making one of his boundary-pushing documentaries, in which he attended a blind-folded sensual dinner, details of which make-up the foreword of his book - he admitted such a task would not faze Nancy.\n\nHe said: \u2018She\u2019s a very understanding and cool person, not the sort of person to get insecure and in a flap about something like that...\n\n'I don\u2019t remember what she said. Probably something like, \u201cBy the way, you still haven\u2019t taken out the rubbish\u201d'.\n\nGotta Get Theroux This is out now", "description": "The beloved documentary maker, 49, who married the TV producer in 2012, made the heartbreaking reveal in his new autobiography Gotta Get Theroux This", "authors": ["Ciara Farmer For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/08/20119858-0-image-a-19_1571903324984.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
