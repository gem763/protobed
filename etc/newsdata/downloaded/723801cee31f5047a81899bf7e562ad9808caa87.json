Yet, it\u2019s the thrill of the chase that makes this so rewarding.\n\nSetting out from Bergen, flanked by the wooden warehouses of Bryggen Wharf on a snowy January morning, it was easy to sense the apprehension felt by the 16th-century salt-cod traders as they embarked on the treacherous journey into the frozen North, where the daylight diminishes with each degree you travel closer to the pole.\n\nThe conditions on board the Viking Sky are, thankfully, better than in centuries past. There are just over 900 passengers on the ocean ships and around one crew member for every two travellers. The ships are hygge hideaways of understated Scandi-chic, perfect for hunkering down on those inky Arctic nights, when the winds howl and stateroom doors rattle.\n\nThe comfy lounges are filled with books about Shackleton, Franklin, Amundsen and Nansen, painstakingly selected by Mayfair library-builders Heywood Hill, booksellers to the Queen. A traditional spa continues the Nordic theme, with a steam room, sauna and even a snow grotto, allowing for the full Scandinavian bathing ritual of fire and ice.", "description": "The highs and lows of hunting for the Northern Lights on a cruise", "authors": ["Sarah Knapton", "Science Editor"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/Travel/Cruise/RESTRICTED-NORTHERN-LIGHTS-ITINERARY-NORWAY-xlarge.jpg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
