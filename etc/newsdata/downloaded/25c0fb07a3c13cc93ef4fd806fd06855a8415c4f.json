Though Paul made minimal contact, if any, Russell ended up falling to the floor as the ball went through the net.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAlmost instantly, Russell got right up in referee James Williams\u2019 face, upset a foul wasn\u2019t called.\n\nWilliams quickly hit him with a technical foul, and then a second when Russell didn\u2019t back down \u2014 ejecting him from the game.\n\nAfter draining a floater in the third quarter, D\u2019Angelo Russell got into an official's face thinking he deserved a foul. Quickly, Russell was thrown out of the game. (Ezra Shaw/Getty Images)\n\nRussell, who dropped 20 points in the Warriors\u2019 season-opening loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday, finished with just six points when he was ejected on Sunday.\n\nSteve Kerr unbothered by the D\u2019Angelo Russell ejection: \u201cI can\u2019t lecture anyone on keeping their composure.\u201d pic.twitter.com/j68jO3S0MS \u2014 Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) October 27, 2019\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s frustration all around,\u201d Warriors coach Steve Kerr said, via Anthony Slater of The Athletic. \u201cI get frustrated with officials. I can\u2019t lecture anybody on keeping composure. That would be ironic. Stuff happens. We have another game tomorrow, and we\u2019ll bounce back.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Thunder led the contest from the jump, mounting a massive 33-point lead at halftime \u2014 which marked Golden State\u2019s largest halftime deficit since 1997. Fittingly, that deficit in 1997 was against the Seattle Supersonics, who became the Thunder upon moving to Oklahoma City in 2008.\n\nThe Warriors simply couldn\u2019t get going on Sunday. They shot a measly 32.6 percent from the field and went just 5 of 33 from the 3-point line. Led by 22 points and eight rebounds off the bench from Dennis Schroder, the Thunder took full advantage, picking up their first win of the season. Danilo Gallinari was right behind Schroder with 21 points, shooting 4 of 9 from behind the arc, and Shai Gilgeous Alexander added 19 points and nine rebounds.\n\nStephen Curry led the Warriors with 23 points and eight rebounds. Draymond Green, Marquese Chriss and Eric Paschall each finished with 10 points, marking the only Golden State players to hit double figures.\n\nIf Russell\u2019s reaction in the third quarter is any indication, it\u2019s clear that frustration in the Bay Area is rising \u2014 fast.\n\nWhile that\u2019s understandable, given the immense success the Warriors have had in recent years, Kerr isn\u2019t too concerned about their new struggles just yet.\n\nSteve Kerr has been ramping down expectations and warning of what will likely be a jarring new reality for the rebuilding Warriors this season: \u201cI realize I\u2019m making plenty of excuses. But they\u2019re real.\u201d pic.twitter.com/04GpDXldNk \u2014 Anthony Slater (@anthonyVslater) October 27, 2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s two games into the season,\u201d Kerr said. \u201cAs I said, we don\u2019t have a sense of who we are as a team yet. We haven\u2019t established much. We\u2019re playing without centers, and we\u2019re playing with nine new players. I realize I\u2019m making plenty of excuses, but they\u2019re real. We had just an incredible amount of roster turnover and lost guys who had years and years of service in this league and institutional knowledge. We have to build that back up with these young guys, and it takes time. This is not easy.\u201d\n\nGreen, though, was much more blunt in his analysis of the Warriors.\n\nDraymond: \u201cThe reality is we fu***** suck right now.\u201d \u2014 Nick Friedell (@NickFriedell) October 27, 2019\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "After draining a floater in the third quarter, D\u2019Angelo Russell got into an official's face thinking he deserved a foul.
