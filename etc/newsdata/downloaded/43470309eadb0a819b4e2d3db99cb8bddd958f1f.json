It generally results in stiff joints and muscle weakness.\n\nWill learnt to play table tennis when his grandmother bought him a table following his cancer diagnosis.\n\nHe joined the local club at the age of 12 and went on to represent Kent's able bodied men's team before winning the gold medal at the 2016 Paralympic games.", "description": "A source saud that the chances of the Paralympian, 31, dancing on Saturday are 'less than slim,' and it is thought that a formal decision will be announced in the coming day.", "authors": ["Laura Fox For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/01/20356298-0-image-a-94_1572399547037.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
