We\u2019re not even sure what the Hell she\u2019s trying to say here but it\u2019s probably safe to assume she is saying socialism is good and capitalism is bad.\n\nWhen the public democratically decides to invest in ourselves, in working people, they call it socialism. When a billionaire-captured government forces the public to pay for their misdeeds at the expense of working people, they just call it the cost of capitalism. https://t.co/nUgMpRBiYB \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 23, 2019\n\nAOC, that\u2019s not how this works.\n\nThat\u2019s not how any of this works.\n\nThankfully, we're not a democracy; which is aptly described as 2 wolves and a sheep making dinner plans. But to your broader point, it is indeed wrong to have government intervene in the market. GM should have been allowed to go under.

Who told you that. \u2014 Happy Hillbilly (@hillbilly_happy) September 23, 2019\n\nEveryone agrees government and corporations are in bed at the expense of people everywhere. Everyone also agrees that socialism is not the answer, not is wanted by the American people.
