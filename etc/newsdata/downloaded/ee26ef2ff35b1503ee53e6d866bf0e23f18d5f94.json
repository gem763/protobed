It is saving for a rainy day (maintaining a 2 per cent of GDP budget surplus) but seems to be ignoring the thunderstorm that has descended upon it.\n\nGermany has benefited from the euro experience and Chinese consumer expansion, but it hasn't escaped a collapse in industrial production. It doesn't even appear to have a policy response to correct this. On the heels of Mercedes and VW, BMW last month announced cuts to its German workforce. This has made the European Central Bank do the policy heavy-lifting.\n\nReversal rate\n\nAustralia, too, is overly focused on the balanced budget and its prized triple-A credit rating. Indeed, Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe has spoken of other policies that may be needed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBusinesses are craving a pick-up in confidence that would arrest the slide in investment. And it's not just Germany \u2013 the rest of Europe continues to consolidate fiscally. Elsewhere, populist government actions \u2013 in the US, UK and southern Europe \u2013 have caused the business uncertainty.\n\nAs I've written before, the path of European and Japanese rates is critical to Australia, because of the floor created in the global interest rate market by negative yields. But they are also a magnet, such as when investors sell their negative-yielding Japanese government bonds (JGBs) and German bunds to their central banks to buy higher-yielding Australian and US government bonds. In turn, this drags Australian and US yields lower.\n\nWe have just shared another conclusion with our clients: that European and Japanese interest rates are at the \u201creversal rate\u201d. This is the rate where instead of boosting bank lending, interest rates are low enough to have a contractionary impact on the banking sector \u2013 and thus the economy.\n\nSo, a higher bar now exists for deployment of further QE or deposit rate cuts. We agree that Australia is increasingly likely to turn to QE.\n\nDo we think that's a good policy? No, but that doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t be deployed \u2013 especially while the fiscal response is absent. While that is the case, the grinding convergence of Australian bond yields towards the global floor remains a threat.\n\nChris Dickman is a senior portfolio manager at Altius Asset Management", "description": "In many advanced economies, policy is not being conducted in a way that assists in providing some certainty to the decision-making process of local business.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.6252%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/a7bcc1e2d4afcfd6d32d6d41d51196ae0f22ed0a", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
