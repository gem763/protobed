He\u2019s a disgrace.\u2019\n\nn One of the vice presidents of the European Parliament, Heidi Hautala, was quick to dismiss the Johnson Brexit deal.\n\nThe Finnish Green MEP said: \u2018It\u2019s no good. It\u2019s not a very serious proposal.\u2019 Asked by Iain Dale on LBC if she had read the Prime Minister\u2019s offer to the European Commission, she replied: \u2018Err, no. But I am more or less aware of the proposals.\u2019\n\nClearly not a very serious parliamentarian, then.\n\nFading soup-erstar\n\nI-spy: Theresa May, who stayed away from the Tory conference, queuing alone for soup in Portcullis House in the Commons. In her Downing Street pomp she was always surrounded by a coterie of advisers.\n\nTheresa May stayed away from this year's Conservative Party conference in Manchester\n\nRadio 4 Today terrier John Humphrys said 'no' to appearing on BBC\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing\n\nStrictly? No cha-cha-chance\n\nDoesn\u2019t John Humphrys hanker to don sequins and delight the nation on the BBC\u2019s Strictly Come Dancing?\n\n\u2018I have been asked twice over the years, and the answer each time was \u201cno\u201d. The answer remains \u201cno\u201d,\u2019 the former Radio 4 Today terrier asserts.\n\n\u2018Poor old John Sergeant made a fool of himself. He\u2019s a great mate of mine and, moreover, he turned making a fool of himself into a very successful career. So good on him, but it\u2019s not for me.\n\n\u2018Anyway, I\u2019ve got two left feet.\u2019", "description": "ANDREW PIERCE: John Bercow's critics will now be even more infuriated by his planned appearance on a TV chat show in Ireland just days before the crucial EU summit.", "authors": ["Andrew Pierce For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/01/19375936-0-image-a-17_1570407324223.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
