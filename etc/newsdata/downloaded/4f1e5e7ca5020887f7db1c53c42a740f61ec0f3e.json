Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) listens to President Trump make an announcement at the White House in November 2018. (Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\nSen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) has all but admitted to the game he\u2019s playing with President Trump. The man who once derided Trump as a \u201cbigot\u201d and a \u201ckook\u201d during the 2016 campaign has acknowledged his pro-Trump conversion may not be entirely earnest, but he emphasized that it does carry benefits, both for his political fortunes and for his policy goals. \u201d\u2026 If you know anything about me, it\u2019d be odd not to do this,\u201d Graham said earlier this year.\n\nThe arrangement appears to be running into trouble.\n\nGraham has made a habit of defending most everything Trump does and being one of his most vocal attack dogs. But there\u2019s one area in which the senator attempts to cash in the goodwill he accumulates: foreign policy. Graham will often make or tweet gentle suggestions of a more hawkish course than Trump is taking, without directly calling Trump out.\n\nThat changed Tuesday, though, when Graham saw fit to explicitly deride Trump\u2019s Iran policy.\n\n\u201cClearly what we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t working,\u201d Graham told the Daily Beast.\n\nGraham then tweeted the message and directly invoked Trump, even tagging his Twitter handle. \u201cThe measured response by President @realDonaldTrump regarding the shooting down of an American drone was clearly seen by the Iranian regime as a sign of weakness,\u201d Graham said.\n\nThe measured response by President @realDonaldTrump regarding the shooting down of an American drone was clearly seen by the Iranian regime as a sign of weakness. \u2014 Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 17, 2019\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to call out Trump; it\u2019s another to accuse him of coming across as weak. Trump obviously didn\u2019t like it, and he hit back.\n\n\u201cNo Lindsey, it was a sign of strength that some people just don\u2019t understand!\u201d Trump responded.\n\nNo Lindsey, it was a sign of strength that some people just don\u2019t understand! https://t.co/EU8AvfH7j9 \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 18, 2019\n\nBut Wednesday, Graham wasn\u2019t exactly backing off the idea that he was directly criticizing Trump. This time, Graham said that new sanctions Trump had announced were insufficient when it comes to changing Iran\u2019s behavior. (The administration has said Iran was behind a recent attack on Saudi oil fields, which would be one of many recent provocative acts.)\n\n\u201cThe maximum pressure campaign has worked in the sense it\u2019s crippled the regime\u2019s economy, it\u2019s made life difficult for the regime. But it has not changed their behavior,\u201d Graham told reporters. Asked whether Trump\u2019s sanctions were sufficient, Graham said: \u201cIn the past they haven\u2019t been, but time will tell. ... My belief is that additional sanctions will fall short.\u201d\n\nTrump was then asked about this criticism, and he again went after Graham in personal terms, highlighting his support for the Iraq War.\n\n\u201cAsk Lindsey how did going into the Middle East \u2014 how did that work out? And how did going into Iraq work out?\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo, we have a disagreement on that. And we have plenty of time to do some dastardly things\u201d to Iran.\n\nNone of this is to say the relationship is irreparably damaged; Trump will often joust with people he respects in very personal terms before making up with them later. But Graham\u2019s adjustment in strategy is curious. Why change things up and go at Trump so directly, when he knows it could just lead to him being pushed outside Trump\u2019s inner circle?\n\nIt seems the strategy of appeasement wasn\u2019t paying the kind of dividends Graham hoped or that they had previously been paying. The row between Trump and Graham comes shortly after Trump ousted his most hawkish aide, former national security adviser John Bolton, amid signs that his foreign policy on issues such as Iran and the Taliban may have been softening.\n\nJust last week, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) more gently called out Trump\u2019s decision to plan the Taliban negotiations in the first place (while making a point to also praise him for scrapping them). She and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) then wound up fighting over which of them Trump is closer to politically.\n\nAs I noted at the time, the fact that a Cheney (daughter of Dick) and a Paul (son of Ron) were fighting over this and that both had plausible arguments shows how amorphous and malleable Trump\u2019s foreign policy can be. That\u2019s why people like Graham have set aside their personal pride and rhetorical consistency (and perhaps their true feelings about Trump) in the name of having a seat at the table. Given Trump can be influenced, the rewards for remaining relevant to him can be huge.\n\nBut it\u2019s also an odd relationship in which people like Graham apparently feel as though they have to broadcast these messages for all to see, rather than or in addition to communicating them privately to Trump. And apparently, Graham\u2019s message isn\u2019t being received by Trump right now \u2014 or at least, not to the senator\u2019s satisfaction.", "description": "Over the last 24 hours, there have been signs of trouble in paradise.", "authors": ["Aaron Blake", "Senior Political Reporter", "Writing For The Fix", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/_ew2H6pRQog0mx5_PNQyqiktu_4=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KCTOXGSAEUI6TBNNO6PPAX6Z3A.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
