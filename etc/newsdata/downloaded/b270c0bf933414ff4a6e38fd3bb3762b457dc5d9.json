Something subtle. Something noticeable only because so little \u00adchanges in the months-long slog of a baseball season.\n\nPlayers came home from their final road trip of the regular season to find someone had lined the circumference of their large, oval clubhouse with plastic. The person had rolled up sections above lockers and tied them with twine. With eight games left at that point, the Nationals could be just days away from spraying all manner of bubbly \u00adbeverages.\n\nThe Nationals weren\u2019t there quite yet, but they later inched closer with a 7-2 drubbing of the Philadelphia Phillies in the opener of a five-game series. They shaved their magic number to clinch a spot in the postseason to three and reclaimed sole possession of the National League wild-card lead with a half-game edge over the idle Milwaukee Brewers. The Chicago Cubs, who had the night off as well, sank to 4\u00bd back of the Nationals. Seemingly the only question left is whether the one-game playoff will be in Milwaukee or Washington.\n\n[The Nationals are in great shape or they\u2019re a flawed mess, depending on how you look at them]\n\nThe Nationals didn\u2019t seem pleased with the reminders of their postseason positioning. Starter Patrick Corbin and Manager Dave Martinez shrugged off the plastic, but it frustrated Adam Eaton. The right fielder said he discussed the decision with someone and \u201cit won\u2019t happen again.\u201d He joked he wanted to \u201cdo a Chris Sale and rip every single one of them down,\u201d referencing his former teammate on the Chicago White Sox who once infamously cut up jerseys in the clubhouse before a game because he didn\u2019t want to pitch in them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not happy with that,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cIt\u2019s a distraction in my book, and [it] shouldn\u2019t have happened.\u201d\n\nThe Nationals won with offense, which they hadn\u2019t done much during their struggles of the past three weeks. They homered three times in the first three innings \u2014 Eaton to right in the first, Yan Gomes to center in the second and Trea Turner to left in the third. Eaton\u2019s career-high 15th homer fulfilled a Nationals fan\u2019s pick for \u201cDinger of the Day\u201d in a stadium promotion. The choice of the 30-year-old outfielder impressed the team.\n\n\u201cI want that fan,\u201d Martinez said, laughing. \u201cThat's pretty impressive. That\u2019s the first thing we all said [in the dugout], \u2018Get that guy down here!\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnthony Rendon and Asdr\u00fabal \u00adCabrera drove in runs in the fifth to push the lead to 5-0 on a night when Corbin was dealing. The left-hander allowed one run over six innings, and he showcased usual dominance with his slider while flashing a new development with his fastball. The game plan called for some up in the zone at times because the Phillies have laid off his slider in the past, and Corbin threw some Monday \u201ckind of short,\u201d Martinez said.\n\nCorbin got Bryce Harper to swing through a 94-mph heater in the third inning for a strikeout, and he fanned Rhys Hoskins with the same approach in the fourth. The swing-and-miss stuff up in the zone is a promising development should the Nationals follow through on what they\u2019ve discussed for the past month and use Corbin as a matchup lefty out of the bullpen in the postseason.\n\n\u201cMy fastball felt really good today,\u201d Corbin said. \u201cI thought I was able to locate it. . . . Kind of kept them off balance. Didn\u2019t want to leave any breaking balls there for them to do some damage.\u201d\n\n[Playoff chases are fun, aren\u2019t they, Nats fans? Why are you hiding under your desk?]\n\nThe bullpen secured nine outs with Fernando Rodney in the seventh, Daniel Hudson in the eighth and Javy Guerra in the ninth. The Nationals warmed Sean Doolittle for the final frame before Phillies reliever Edubray Ramos walked in a pair of runs in the eighth.\n\nThe plan for Doolittle instead of Hudson for the ninth was still notable \u2014 not long ago, a four-run lead in the ninth would still have been a situation for Hudson. Doolittle still hasn\u2019t had a save opportunity since his return from the injured list at the beginning of this month.\n\nThis team is still dealing with the implications of its poor play to start September \u2014 which included losing 10 of 16 and squandering the cushion it built all summer \u2014 but for one night at least, it didn\u2019t need to worry about its closer at all.\n\nDoolittle\u2019s readiness to resume closing duties would be the latest development indicating the team\u2019s resurgence. Players and coaches expressed relief that, after spending the past three weeks almost exclusively on the road, they had finally returned home for the season\u2019s final week. Martinez, who had a medical scare early last week, received positive results on a scheduled, follow-up doctor\u2019s visit. He walked out of the clubhouse before the game, flashed a double thumbs-up and chirped, \u201cClean bill!\u201d\n\nNo one embodied this team\u2019s past six weeks better than Eaton. The right fielder was scorching in August and then hurt his knee. He returned hobbled and has slumped through much of September.\n\nBut Monday, he mashed a 444-foot homer into the second deck in the first inning, singled in the third, legged out a bunt hit in the fifth and walked in the eighth.\n\n\u201cI am in the best shape in September I\u2019ve been in my entire career, by far,\u201d he said. \u201cJust being able to run, I feel very strong.\u201d\n\nEaton was back, and so was his team. The Nationals jogged off the field Monday night one day closer to unfurling the plastic in the clubhouse.", "description": "Nationals blast three homers and Patrick Corbin takes much of the fight out of the Phils to reduce Washington\u2019s magic number to clinch a playoff spot to three.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter", "September At Pm", "Sam Fortier Is A Sports Reporter For The Washington Post."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GppRmxCSp3rCQZf6vC5rFhB-pTU=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/OPQZVHG6MMI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
