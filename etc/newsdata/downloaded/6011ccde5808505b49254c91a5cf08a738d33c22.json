Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called it a \u201cstar chamber\u201d process this week, and even Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who is one of President Trump\u2019s most vocal critics inside his own party, said he would like to see a vote in the full House of Representatives authorizing the inquiry.\n\nBut the biggest problem with Republican critiques is that Democrats in the House are following a playbook for investigations that was first written by Republicans in large part over the past several years.\n\nDepositions held behind closed doors? That\u2019s what happened with the congressional investigation into the 2012 attack on a U.S. diplomatic facility in Benghazi, Libya.\n\n\u201cOf the 50-some odd interviews we have done thus far, the vast majority of them have been private,\u201d said Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., who chaired the House Select Committee on Benghazi, in 2015.\n\n\u201cThe private ones always produce better results,\u201d Gowdy said.\n\nGowdy also kept a close hold on transcripts rather than releasing them, as House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff, the California Democrat overseeing the inquiry, is doing now.\n\nSubpoenas issued without consultation with the minority? That too was part of the Republican playbook. Most committee chairs didn\u2019t even have the power to do that until Republicans held control of the House from 2010 to 2018. In their zeal to investigate the Obama administration, House Republicans doubled the number of committees where the chair could issue unilateral subpoenas demanding witnesses come to testify or be deposed.\n\nAnd while chairing the House Oversight Committee, Republican Darrell Issa of California issued more than 100 subpoenas without minority input during his investigations into the Obama administration.\n\nSen.

In fact, that was done in 1974 and 1998 \u2014 in the run-up to the impeachment hearings of Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton \u2014 because a full House vote was required to authorize committee staff to conduct depositions, which occur behind closed doors. Republicans, however, got rid of that requirement.\n\nDemocrats allowed one committee \u2014 House Oversight and Government Reform \u2014 to set its own rules for staff depositions in 2007. Republicans then extended that power to almost all committees in 2017.\n\nRepublican complaints that the president\u2019s attorneys have not been allowed to sit in on the depositions have had more resonance, since Nixon\u2019s attorneys were part of the House Judiciary process in 1974.\n\nBut comparisons to the 1998 impeachment of Bill Clinton are of limited value on this point. Much of the investigative work into Clinton was done by independent counsel Ken Starr, and the House moved quickly to impeachment without much of an investigative process.\n\nMolly Reynolds, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said that the House is now \u201cstill very much in a fact-finding inquiry\u201d at this point.\n\nThat could soon change, as public hearings may commence as soon as mid-November, bringing in for public testimony some individuals who have spoken to staff.\n\nBut for now, Reynolds said, the question to ask is, \u201cWhat stage of the process are we at and what level of transparency is appropriate for that?\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "The biggest problem with Republican critiques of the impeachment inquiry is that Democrats in the House are following a playbook for investigations that was first written by Republicans in large part over the past several years.", "authors": ["Jon Ward", "Senior Political Correspondent"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/v_ovQzFVS3zdjvgBebBG.g--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/04af28f0-f69c-11e9-a9c5-92a2387cfa55", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
