The actress and lifelong activist was demonstrating on Capitol Hill with the group Oil Change International. She said yesterday on her website that, \u201cI will be on the Capitol every Friday, rain or shine, inspired and emboldened by the incredible movement our youth have created.\u201d She added, \u201cI can no longer stand by and let our elected officials ignore \u2014 and even worse \u2014 empower the industries that are destroying our planet for profit. We can not continue to stand for this.\u201d A police spokeswoman said that 16 protestors had been arrested this afternoon for \u201cunlawfully demonstrating\u201d and were charged with \u201ccrowding, obstructing or incommoding.\u201d Fonda was among the 16, and even though her day of action ended in a police car today, you can bet she will be back on track for the next of her \u201cFire Drill Fridays,\u201d which will take place every week for the next four months. If the law wants more Jane Fonda, they\u2019ll know exactly where to find her.\n\nMultiple protesters, including Jane Fonda, arrested on the steps of the Capitol building, where they were demanding action on climate change. https://t.co/RvBB1jn0wW pic.twitter.com/sl4LOASqWB \u2014 Evan McMurry (@evanmcmurry) October 11, 2019", "description": "Jane Fonda has vowed to protest in D.C. every Friday going forward on behalf of climate change, and her first \u201cFire Drill Friday\u201d action ended in handcuffs.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/11/11-jane-fonda.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
