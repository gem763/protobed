Research suggests a high-fibre diet is crucial for healthy bowels, as these bacteria break down fibre into substances that have anti-inflammatory properties. But diets high in salt, saturated fat and red meat can lead to increased risk of inflammatory diseases. \u201cSpecific bacteria have been linked to bowel cancer,\u201d says Prof Philip Quirke of the University of Leeds. \u201cWe think that the maintenance of them is probably linked to diet, because you find higher rates of bowel cancer in places with high red meat consumption, and lower levels in areas where diets are based more on high fibre content.\u201d\n\nFollow the rhythm of your bowel\n\nOne of the main causes of bowel problems, such as constipation, is interruptions to the natural rhythm of the body. \u201cBowel activity is normally greater when you wake up and after each meal, especially after breakfast,\u201d says Dr Maura Corsetti of the University of Nottingham. \u201cBut in today\u2019s world, many people don\u2019t make time for this. Instead they delay bowel movements when they feel a stimulus, because they\u2019re rushing out of the house or at work. This can lead to a bowel that is not opening regularly. So when you feel the desire to go, you should go.\u201d\n\nReduce stress\n\n\u201cThe gut is full of nerves, and during times of stress they release neurotransmitters that can generate inflammation in the gut,\u201d says Dr Elizabeth Mann of the University of Manchester. \u201cIt\u2019s well known that stress worsens many diseases, and this is one of the pathways by which this occurs.\u201d Exercise is an effective method of reducing stress, and it has an additional positive effect on bowel health by speeding up transit times.\n\nTake antibiotics only when absolutely necessary\n\nAntibiotics can be necessary to clear infections, but this comes at a cost: they disturb the normal balance of bacteria in your gut, wiping out many of the microbes that have health benefits.\n\nBreastfeed your baby\n\nBecause the gut microbiome is mostly formed before the age of two, feeding patterns in early childhood play a crucial role in determining bowel health in later life. Scientists say there is evidence that breastfeeding babies can result in them having a far healthier gut, as can a diverse, healthy diet when they transition to solid foods. \u201cThis is important, because if you don\u2019t develop a diverse microbiome early in your childhood, then you may be more at risk of inflammatory diseases such as asthma and eczema,\u201d Quirke says.", "description": "Diet is crucial, but don\u2019t forget to exercise, reduce your stress levels \u2013 and go when you need to go", "authors": ["David Cox"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f32b990638ab4f99fb2aea8ac61307bf02b43ff1/596_776_4467_2681/master/4467.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6ee413263e2409f6515eba8fbfc98524", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
