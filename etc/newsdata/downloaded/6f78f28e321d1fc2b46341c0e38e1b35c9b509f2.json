Kim has previously visited Mt Paektu before making major decisions such as the 2013 execution of his powerful uncle and his 2018 decision to embark on diplomacy with Seoul and Washington.\n\n\u201cHis march on horseback in Mt Paektu is a great event of weighty importance in the history of the Korean revolution,\u201d KCNA said.\n\n\"Having witnessed the great moments of his thinking atop Mt Paektu, all the officials accompanying him were convinced with overflowing emotion and joy that there will be a great operation to strike the world with wonder again and make a step forward in the Korean revolution.\"\n\nThe images were released days after the country's first nuclear negotiations with the United States in more than seven months fell apart.\n\nAnalysts said the symbolism underscored North Korea's determination to stand up to international pressure over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.\n\n\u201cThis is a statement, symbolic of defiance,\u201d said Joshua Pollack, a North Korea expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California.\n\n\u201cThe pursuit of sanctions relief is over. Nothing is made explicit here, but it starts to set new expectations about the coming course of policy for 2020.\u201d\n\nKim Jong Un rides through snow-covered landscapes on Mt Paektu [KCNA via AP Photo]\n\nSymbolism\n\nNorth Korean documents say Kim's grandfather and national founder Kim Il Sung had an anti-Japan guerrilla base on Paektu's slopes during Japan's 1910-45 colonial rule of the Korean Peninsula.\n\nThe official biography of Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il, says the second-generation leader was born on Paektu when a double rainbow filled the skies.\n\nThe white horse is also a propaganda symbol for the Kim family that has ruled North Korea for seven decades.\n\nState media have occasionally shown Kim, his sister and his father riding white horses. The symbolism goes back to Kim Il Sung, who according to the North's official narrative, rode a white horse while fighting against Japanese rulers.\n\nKCNA said Kim also visited nearby construction sites in Samjiyon County and complained about the US-led sanctions imposed because of the North\u2019s nuclear programmes.\n\n\"The situation of the country is difficult owing to the ceaseless sanctions and pressure by the hostile forces and there are many hardships and trials facing us,\" Kim was quoted as saying.\n\n\"But our people grew stronger through the trials and found their own way of development and learned how to always win in the face of trials.\"\n\nSpace talk\n\nNorth Korea has been targeted with a total of 11 rounds of sanctions since 2006. The sanctions have been toughened since 2016 when Kim began conducting a series of high-profile nuclear and missile tests, and they include a full ban on key exports such as coal, textiles and seafood.\n\nDuring his second summit with President Donald Trump in Vietnam in February, Kim demanded the United States lift the newer and more biting sanctions in return for dismantling his main nuclear complex, a limited denuclearisation step.\n\nTrump rejected that offer, and the summit collapsed without reaching any deal.\n\nThe two leaders held a brief, impromptu meeting at the Korean border in late June and agreed to resume talks. But talks broke down again after nuclear negotiators met in Stockholm earlier this month with\n\nNorth Korea blaming the US and threatening to resume nuclear and long-range missile tests.\n\nSeveral experts said they suspected the North might instead conduct a space launch, which would enable the country to show off its economic and technological power less provocatively than by testing a missile.\n\nThe language in Wednesday\u2019s state media report suggested Kim might be \u201ccontemplating some major policy decisions,\u201d said Rachel Minyoung Lee, an analyst with NK News, a website that monitors North Korea.\n\n\u201cThe report in Korean has characterised Kim\u2019s climb up to Mt Paektu on horseback as a new \u2018myth\u2019, and that, together with the images of him on a white horse, appear to have been designed to create maximum propaganda effect, which I believe media will play up in the days to come,\u201d Lee said.", "description": "Mt Paektu and the white horse are central to the Kim family's mythology and visits often herald major policy moves.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/16/6346f9fcd5cb4aeeb6b3d7d6291a6e1e_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
