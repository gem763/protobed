And some days it\u2019s hard to write your feelings of your not in the right place.\n\n\u2018The last few weeks I\u2019ve been in a really weird place\u2026 I find it hard to talk about it .. I guess it\u2019s anxiety and pressure of life \u2026 and when I actually reached out to someone they said I was draining [sic].\u2019\n\nThe 39-year-old encouraged her fans to be kinder to everyone as no one wants to hear that they\u2019re \u2018draining\u2019 when they\u2019re going through a tough time.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I feel like this is why some people keep their emotions to themselves,\u2019 Caroline continued. \u2018I certainly hate talking about my feelings.\u2019\n\n\u2018And being a burden is my biggest fear\u2026. I\u2019m lucky to be able to pick myself up when things feel sh*t. But what happens if someone can\u2019t . Be nice to people.\n\n\u2018You never know what\u2019s going on . Ever\u2019.\n\nThe star previously opened up about her experiences with depression, which she says started after her Strictly Come Dancing victory in 2014 and lasted a year.\n\nShe told The Sun: \u2018It all started the day after I won Strictly. I woke up and felt like somebody had covered my body in cling-film.\n\n\u2018I couldn\u2019t get up and just couldn\u2019t pick myself up at all that next year. I felt ridiculous, being so sad when I\u2019d just won the biggest show on telly and had such an amazing job.\n\nCaroline continued: \u2018People see the celebrity lifestyle and assume everything is perfect, but we\u2019re just like everyone else. Everyone is battling something emotional behind closed doors \u2014 that\u2019s life. Fame doesn\u2019t make you happy.\u2019\n\nMental Health Awareness week had many celebrities open up about their struggles, including Jameela Jamil on her PTSD, her boyfriend James Blake on suicidal thoughts and Danielle Lloyd on her anxiety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith online bullying leading to a lot of anxiety and depression \u2013 and in some cases, suicide \u2013 remember to be kind to one another.\n\nNeed support?
