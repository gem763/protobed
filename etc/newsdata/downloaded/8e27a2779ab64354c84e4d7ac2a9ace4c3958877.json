Subscribe to the newsletter here .\n\nWhat stays up on the internet, and what comes down? It\u2019s a defining question of the age \u2014 and the subject of yesterday\u2019s newsletter \u2014 and on Wednesday, it came to Congress.\n\nThe occasion was a hearing of the House Energy and Committee Commerce and its subcommittees on communications and technology and consumer protection and commerce. The intent was to \u201cexplore whether online companies are appropriately using the tools they have \u2014 including protections Congress granted in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act \u2014 to foster a healthier Internet.\u201d\n\nSection 230, as my colleague Adi Robertson noted earlier this year, is \u201cone of the internet\u2019s most important and most misunderstood laws.\u201d These days, members of Congress typically describe it as a priceless free pass given to tech companies to exempt them from most legal requirements to moderate the content on their platforms. In fact, it was created to enable platforms to moderate content \u2014 and became law because Congress wanted tech companies to moderate more content than they previously were.\n\nJeff Kosseff, who wrote a book on 230, explained it to Robertson:\n\nThen we get to these early internet services like CompuServe and Prodigy in the early \u201890s. CompuServe is like the Wild West. It basically says, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to moderate anything.\u201d Prodigy says, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have moderators, and we\u2019re going to prohibit bad stuff from being online.\u201d They\u2019re both, not surprisingly, sued for defamation based on third-party content. CompuServe\u2019s lawsuit is dismissed because what the judge says is, yeah, CompuServe is the electronic equivalent of a newsstand or bookstore. The court rules that Prodigy doesn\u2019t get the same immunity because Prodigy actually did moderate content, so Prodigy is more like a newspaper\u2019s letter to the editor page. So you get this really weird rule where these online platforms can reduce their liability by not moderating content. That really is what triggered the proposal of Section 230. For Congress, the motivator for Section 230 was that it did not want platforms to be these neutral conduits, whatever that means. It wanted the platforms to moderate content.\n\nAnd so the platforms continued to moderate content, eventually growing to an unimaginable size, and employing tens of thousands of moderators around the world. But owing in large part to their size, many bad things continue to take place on their servers: fraud, harassment, revenge porn, election interference, and so on.\n\nIt was in that context that Congress met today to complain about all of the things, and threaten to return us to a world where 230 did not exist, and \u2014 uh, platforms had no legal incentive to moderate content at all?\n\nI regret to say that almost everything that followed was very dumb. This exchange, captured by a writer from Boston University, illustrates how. On one side you have Reddit CEO Steve Huffman, who describes the company\u2019s hybrid approach to moderation: the company sets a \u201cfloor\u201d of rules for users, but individual communities can raise the \u201cceiling\u201d by adding additional rules that suit their needs.\n\nAnd then on the other side you have an elected official rattling off empty action-movie one-liners:\n\nReddit\u2019s Huffmann, in his submitted remarks, described how the company works: \u201cThe way Reddit handles content moderation today is unique in the industry. We use a governance model akin to our own democracy\u2014where everyone follows a set of rules, has the ability to vote and self-organize, and ultimately shares some responsibility for how the platform works.\u201d At least one committee member found that sort of approach far too weak. \u201cYou better get serious about self-regulating,\u201d Congressman Bill Johnson (R-Ohio) said to the panelists, \u201cor you\u2019re gonna force Congress to do something that you might not want to have done.\u201d\n\nYou hear that, Huffman? If you don\u2019t \u201cget serious,\u201d whatever that might mean, Congress might \u201cdo something.\u201d Something \u201cthat you might not want to have done,\u201d to boot!\n\nIt seems to me that if you were concerned about the balance of power between technology companies and their users in 2019, you might start with their enormous size and well documented anticompetitive behavior. Elsewhere in the government, to the credit of agencies like the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, civil servants are doing just that. But to look at the unintended consequences of tech platforms and diagnose the cause as a law that incentivizes them to remove the bad stuff \u2014 well, maybe it\u2019s Congress who better get serious.\n\nAll of this would be comical had lawmakers previously \u201cdone something\u201d about Section 230, with awful results. Last year, Congress passed FOSTA-SESTA, a bill nominally intended to fight sex trafficking. It threatens any website owner with up to 10 years in prison for hosting even one instance of prostitution-related content. As a result, sites like Craigslist removed their entire online personals sections. Sex workers who had previously been working as their own bosses were driven back onto the streets, often forced to work for pimps. Prostitution-related crime in San Francisco alone \u2014 including violence against workers \u2014 more than tripled.\n\nThis is the kind of legislation you get from a Congress that is intent on doing something but too ignorant of technology, of history, and of the law to know what. I suppose that a hearing in which members ask technology companies to explain themselves is a step forward. I hope that Congress was listening, however little evidence there is that they were.\n\nThe Ratio\n\nToday in news that could affect public perception of the big tech companies.\n\nTrending up: Twitch is giving channel moderators more tools, and has promised to make enforcement actions more public. CEO Emmett Shear talks with The Verge\u2019s Bijan Stephen about the moves.\n\nTrending down: The Buffalo Chronicle, a Facebook page devoted to publishing false stories about Canadian politics, has had a recent string of viral successes spreading misinformation about Justin Trudeau.\n\nTrending sideways: Mark Zuckerberg is giving an \u201cunfiltered take\u201d on free speech tomorrow via live Facebook video. He\u2019s going to discuss big threats to free expression around the world, and apologized in advance for the length.\n\nGoverning\n\n\u2b50Democratic presidential candidates spent 15 minutes during Tuesday night\u2019s debate mixing it up over what to do about Big Tech. The discussion \u2014 ranging from digital privacy to how to handle jobs eliminated by automation \u2014 illustrated how the tech backlash has moved to the center of mainstream political discussion. Here\u2019s Recode\u2019s Theodore Schleifer:\n\nThe combat mostly centered on Elizabeth Warren, the new presidential frontrunner who has made her proposal to break up tech companies like Facebook a cornerstone of her presidential run. Many of her competitors said they were not willing to go as far as her, although several decided to take their own whacks at Silicon Valley from other angles. Beto O\u2019Rourke offered the most direct criticism to Warren\u2019s plan, even comparing her approach to Trump\u2019s rhetoric about the press. \u201cWe will be unafraid to break up big businesses if we have to do that \u2014 but I don\u2019t think it is the role of a president or a candidate for the presidency to specifically call out which companies will be broken up,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cThat\u2019s something that Donald Trump has done in part because he sees enemies in the press and wants to diminish their power. It\u2019s not something that we should do.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic party is aggressively working to combat foreign election interference and coordinated misinformation campaigns ahead of the 2020 election. They\u2019re using new software tools to track trending disinformation on Twitter, and asking candidates to keep an eye out for fake news related to the debates. (Ryan Lizza / Politico)\n\nElizabeth Warren says that unlike Facebook, TV networks will refuse ads with a \u2018lie\u2019 \u2014 but that\u2019s not entirely true. Broadcast networks are generally required to run candidate ads under federal law. But issue ads, including the Trump campaign\u2019s misleading one about Joe Biden and the Ukraine prosecutor, aren\u2019t covered by the rule. (Amy Sherman / PolitiFact)\n\nThe Libra Association had its first official meeting in Geneva yesterday and elected a board of directors. The moment was supposed to be a passing of the baton from Facebook to its independent governing board, which is stacked with Facebook insiders. David Marcus told Bloomberg the association is trying to address legitimate concerns from regulators. (Kurt Wagner / Bloomberg)\n\nBlizzard suspended three more Hearthstone players for showing their support of Hong Kong protestors during an official competition. The six-month suspension comes just over a week after the company suspended a professional player, Ng \u201cBlitzchung\u201d Wai Chung, for similar conduct. (Julia Alexander / The Verge)\n\nChina is racing to develop its own global cryptocurrency as Libra struggles to stay on course. The currency will be backed by the yuan and work with payment platforms including WeChat and Alipay, giving it an advantage over Facebook\u2019s coin, which currently has no major payment platforms backing it in the United States. (Kate Rooney / CNBC)\n\nThe fallout from the Hong Kong protests has largely been covered as a story about Chinese influence. But is it actually an example of China\u2019s weakness? The government has been flipping out about a tweet, an app, and a gamer \u2014 none of which seem to pose a significant threat. The question is ... why? (Zeynep Tufekci / The Atlantic)\n\nEU antitrust regulator Margrethe Vestager ordered Broadcom to halt possible anticompetitive practices while an inquiry is underway. The chipmaker has been accused of using exclusivity agreements to block customers from using products made by rivals.

The site \u2014 run by a South Korean citizen \u2014 contained more than 200,000 videos. (Zack Whittaker / TechCrunch)\n\nIndustry\n\n\u2b50 Ads Inc. raked in millions by using Facebook to find marks for its dubious monthly subscriptions. Customers thought they were signing up for a free trial of a celebrity-endorsed product \u2014 then, it all fell apart: Nice investigation from Craig Silverman at BuzzFeed:\n\nBurke\u2019s genius was in fusing the scam with a boiler room\u2013style operation that relied on convincing thousands of average people to rent their personal Facebook accounts to the company, which Ads Inc. then used to place ads for its deceptive free trial offers. That strategy enabled his company to run a huge volume of misleading Facebook ads, targeting consumers all around the world in a lucrative and sophisticated enterprise, a BuzzFeed News investigation has found.\n\n\u2b50 Millions of public Flickr images, many of them of children, landed in a database called MegaFace that is used to train and test artificial intelligence systems. That\u2019s largely legal in the United States \u2014 but not in Illinois, which has some of the strictest privacy laws in the country. Now, 6,000 Illinoisans whose images ended up in the database can sue. Kashmir Hill and Aaron Krolik from The New York Times have the story:\n\nAs residents of Illinois, they are protected by one of the strictest state privacy laws on the books: the Biometric Information Privacy Act, a 2008 measure that imposes financial penalties for using an Illinoisan\u2019s fingerprints or face scans without consent. Those who used the database \u2014 companies including Google, Amazon, Mitsubishi Electric, Tencent and SenseTime \u2014 appear to have been unaware of the law, and as a result may have huge financial liability, according to several lawyers and law professors familiar with the legislation.\n\nGoogle\u2019s Nest is replacing Works with Nest, its former third-party licensing program, with a more tightly controlled version. By restricting access to audited partners, the company hopes to avoid a Cambridge Analytica-like privacy scandal.
