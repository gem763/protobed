Was he okay with the video? Was this video a sign that Brown's time with the Raiders was close to finished?\n\nBut one question seemed to dominate the conversation more than any other \u2014 how did Brown produce such a high-quality video, complete with cinematic shots and an orchestral score?\n\nAs it turns out, it was Alejandro Narciso of SDLN Creative that helped Brown produce the video. But as he told ESPN's \"The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz,\" the production and publishing of the video didn't go all that smoothly.\n\n\"It actually wasn't supposed to be that kind of video at first,\" Narciso, 25, told Le Batard's show. Narciso said he was used to producing \"hype\" videos and had approached Brown about putting something together ahead of the Raiders game against the Broncos on \"Monday Night Football.\"\n\nBrown agreed, and Narciso took footage of Brown as he trained in order to put the video together. After Narciso put together his original cut of the video, Brown told him that the situation had changed a bit. \"[Brown] asked me, 'Yo, this video you made is amazing, but it's too positive right now,'\" Narciso told Le Batard.\n\nRead more: Antonio Brown is reportedly set to join the New England Patriots after bizarre departure from Oakland Raiders\n\nNarciso was with Brown when Gruden called and decided to use the recording in the video. However, he later realized that it would be illegal to use the recording of Gruden without his consent according to California law. Before starting from scratch again, someone suggested sending the video to Gruden and asking for permission.\n\n\"When we were waiting for Gruden's response [I thought] he's going to say, 'Listen AB, I love you man, but that's disrespectful. I can't be having you post our own private conversations,\" Narciso told Le Batard.\n\n\"Gruden gave permission?!\" Le Batard interrupted in shock.\n\n\"And then he responds like 15 minutes later,\" Narciso continued. \"Three texts, he goes 'Wow. I love it. Loved it. I love it.' I was like 'Whaaaat?!' And then we were like, alright, here's our consent.\"\n\nYou can watch a clip of Le Batard interview with Narciso below.\n\nNarciso also told Le Batard that reports of Brown consulting with social media experts were not true, saying \"He's his own consultant, he knows what he's doing.\"\n\nHe also said that the initial reaction to the video was a bit overwhelming, telling Le Batard \"I'm used to everyone just commenting fire emojis.\"\n\nYou can listen to Le Batard's entire interview with Narciso here.\n\n13 winners and losers of Week 1 of the NFL season\n\nMultiple Dolphins players reportedly requested to be traded after embarrassing 59-10 loss because the team is tanking\n\nTop 13 waiver-wire pickups for Week 2 of fantasy football\n\n'Not bad for a running back': Lamar Jackson silenced his doubters with a brilliant performance", "description": "Alejandro Narciso of SDLN Creative told ESPN's \"Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz\" about how the video came to fruition.", "authors": ["Tyler Lauletta"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d73100e2e22af388f34e7f3-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
