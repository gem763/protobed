An all-black carbon fiber / graphite exterior, few branding details, and the keyboard / mouse layout that ThinkPads have historically been known for are all present on the X1 Extreme. Those features kind of make it look dated, even though it\u2019s one of the most powerful and capable laptops I\u2019ve used all year.\n\nAs configured, this review unit is a steep $3,149, though you can get an entry-level X1 Extreme for as little as $1,673. This particular laptop is similar to HP\u2019s 15-inch Spectre x360, a convertible laptop for consumers. In addition, the Lenovo has a ton of business-centric features, such as multiple layers of security (facial and fingerprint recognition), a legacy port selection (USB-A and SD card ports), MIL-STD 810G certification with a spill-proof keyboard, and a long battery life.\n\nThinkPads are made for business, government, military, and IT users, and this one ticks all the boxes for them. Surprisingly, it\u2019s a great laptop for the rest of us, too.\n\nOur review of Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Extreme Verge Score 8 out of 10 Good Stuff Crisp and bright 4K screen\n\nI am sold on that keyboard\n\nGreat battery life\n\nSD card slot Bad Stuff Fan noise gets worse on your lap\n\nWho actually still needs TrackPoint?\n\nDesirable configurations are very expensive\n\nThe speakers aren\u2019t that great Buy for $3,149.00 from Lenovo\n\nThis is a laptop that\u2019s also a tank\n\nIf you work in an industry that the ThinkPad X1 Extreme is designed for, one of the first things you\u2019ll be concerned with is durability. Thankfully, Lenovo invested a lot in the X1 Extreme\u2019s carbon fiber / graphite chassis. It can withstand an accidental liquid spill on the spill-proof keyboard (a hallmark feature of ThinkPad keyboards), and thanks to its MIL-STD 810G durability certification, it can also take some knocks and drops. There\u2019s zero flex or give in the palm rest, keyboard, touchpad, or lid; it\u2019s a rock-solid body.\n\nThinkPad X1 Extreme specs Processor: Intel Core i7-8850H (2.60GHz)\n\nGraphics: GeForce GTX 1050TI with Max Q (4GB DDR5)\n\nRAM: 32GB DDR4\n\nDisplay: 15.6-inch UHD (3840 x 2160) w/ Dolby Vision HDR\n\nStorage: 1TB SSD PCIe\n\nSecurity: TPM 2.0 chip, Windows Hello facial and touch recognition\n\n6-row, spill-resistant, backlit keyboard with TrackPoint\n\nTwo Dolby 2 Watt speakers\n\n80Wh battery\n\nCarbon fiber / graphite body with aluminum alloy bottom\n\nMIL-STD 810G durability certification\n\nWeighs 4.06 pounds\n\nBesides being durable, I think the X1 Extreme has one of the more tasteful ThinkPad designs in recent memory. It\u2019s not a thick, corporate laptop. Instead, has a svelte aesthetic with a smooth, matte finish.\n\nUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t take long before you start to see the oil from your palms and fingertips all over the X1 Extreme. On the bright side, since the keyboard is spill-proof, you won\u2019t have to worry about using a little cleaning solution to wipe it down.\n\nLenovo has done its ThinkPad users another service by having a variety of current and past-gen ports available. It\u2019s refreshing to already have the ports you need without having to reach for a dongle like with so many other modern computers.\n\nOn the left-hand side, you\u2019ll come across two Thunderbolt 3.0 ports, an HDMI out, an Ethernet extension port, power port, and audio jack. On the other side are two USB 3.0 Superspeed ports, a Smart Card reader, and a full-size SD card slot. If you plan on editing or viewing tons of photos or video on the road, that SD card slot is your ticket to a dongle-free lifestyle.\n\nThe hallmark of every ThinkPad laptop is its keyboard, and the X1 Extreme doesn\u2019t disappoint. The keys have a familiar layout and shape, with a tactile feeling that\u2019s comfortable and only takes a few hours to get used to. I can see myself spending hours at this keyboard. It\u2019s just that good. Lenovo also included a backlight with low or high brightness settings, which is useful when you need it.\n\nWhile I may love the X1 Extreme\u2019s keyboard, I don\u2019t have the same sentiment toward the Precision touchpad. For pointer control and tracking, it\u2019s good \u2014 albeit a bit on the small side \u2014 and it has full Windows 10 gesture support. My issue is with the layout that pays homage to past ThinkPads. It\u2019s unusual to position the mouse buttons above the touchpad, rather than below it. If you consider the ThinkPad\u2019s method, there\u2019s less travel time between the keyboard and touchpad, but on the other hand, it requires you to get used to it.\n\nThe red circle in the middle of the keyboard is Lenovo\u2019s TrackPoint input device. It looks like a joystick, but it\u2019s not. The TrackPoint is a pressure-sensitive device that allows you to move the cursor around without moving your hands from the keyboard. I don\u2019t have any use for it, and I always ended up using the touchpad.\n\nThe screen is bright and beautiful\n\nLenovo has every reason to be proud of the X1 Extreme\u2019s 15.6-inch glossy 4K touchscreen. It\u2019s a bright screen, so you can easily read text outdoors or in office lighting. Images have so much color pop, contrast, and saturation that I thought I was looking at a Samsung display. Also, you can lay it completely flat and watch Netflix in 4K and HDR.\n\nHowever, the ThinkPad X1 Extreme falls a bit short in the speakers department. Lenovo touts that the two 2W Dolby speakers have an impressive range, but that\u2019s just not the case. Compared to consumer laptops like the HP Spectre x360 and the Razer Blade 15, dialogue in The Punisher produced by the speakers came without any gravitas from the lows. Meanwhile, highs can sound a bit too squeaky to bear at high volumes, making the speakers one of the X1 Extreme\u2019s lowest points.\n\nThe ThinkPad X1 Extreme review unit that I\u2019ve been using has a high-end spec sheet, which directly contributes to its high price tag and its blazing performance. The ThinkPad X1 Extreme uses a faster Core i7 processor than Razer\u2019s Blade 15, which is a consumer-facing gaming laptop. Between the speedy processor, beefy 32GB of RAM, dedicated GTX 1050Ti Max Q graphics, 4K screen with 100 percent sRGB color coverage, and massive 1TB solid state drive, there\u2019s enough power here to make the X1 Extreme your daily driver. I don\u2019t know about you, but when a laptop has more RAM than my desktop, it becomes the de facto machine to get Lightroom and Photoshop work done.\n\nYou can even get away with playing a few of the less graphically intense PC games, like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive or League of Legends in 4K at med-high settings and still maintain 60 fps.\n\nYou can get away with some light 4K gaming\n\nUnfortunately, there are a few issues that arise when the X1 Extreme is pushed to the extreme. If you\u2019re playing a game, watching a video for 20 minutes, or otherwise spending extended time using the ThinkPad, you\u2019re eventually going to hear the fans spin up, pushing hot air out of the chassis. That\u2019s perfectly normal! It\u2019s not distracting when it\u2019s on a table, but when it\u2019s on your lap, it\u2019s loud. It seems as if the whistling sound is caused by the vents on the bottom plate getting blocked when it\u2019s on your lap or a bed, for example. In those scenarios, the fans are definitely distracting.\n\nThankfully, whether it\u2019s on your lap or not, there isn\u2019t too much heat dissipation that you can feel on the laptop\u2019s palm rest. Instead, you\u2019ll feel most of the heat on the bottom aluminum plate, which is why I recommend using it on your lap sparingly.\n\nSecurity is a big part of the X1 Extreme\u2019s arsenal. Besides having a TPM 2.0 chip for encryption, Lenovo has fitted this ThinkPad with two forms of Windows Hello authentication: fingerprint and facial recognition. Other high-end laptops like the Spectre x360 also have fingerprint and facial recognition, but the ThinkPad seems to do a more consistent and faster job with both.\n\nFacial and fingerprint recognition? Check\n\nLenovo advertises a 15-hour battery life for the ThinkPad X1 Extreme. But in my experience \u2014 with Bluetooth off, display brightness set to 50 percent, keyboard backlighting off, and the high-performance power plan in Windows 10 enabled \u2014 I reached about 10 or 11 hours of browser usage. That includes visiting YouTube, using Google Docs to write this review, and reading The Verge.\n\nConsidering this laptop has a 4K screen and a Core i7 chip, I think 10 hours of battery life is great. You can charge the X1 Extreme\u2019s battery from 0 to 80 percent in just 30 minutes with its surprisingly small power brick, thanks to Lenovo\u2019s rapid charging. Unfortunately, the included brick does not use the X1\u2019s USB-C ports, and you can\u2019t use it to fast-charge your phone, though you can charge the battery through them with another adapter.\n\nOne of the best laptops of the year\n\nThe ThinkPad X1 Extreme is one of my favorite laptops of the year. It takes the best traits of mainstream consumer laptops (4K, Dolby, and Precision touchpad), blends it with gaming laptop features (Max Q discrete graphics and HDR), and adds in the best qualities of a business laptop (durability, security, and a low-profile). Of course, it\u2019s not without its faults: the X1 Extreme\u2019s speakers aren\u2019t the best by far, the fans can get noisy, and the aluminum bottom plate can get pretty toasty on your lap.\n\nIf configured to be a high-end machine, the ThinkPad X1 Extreme is probably the best business-oriented Windows 10 laptop you can buy. I\u2019d even go a step further and say it\u2019s one of the better machines to come out this year. Lenovo has proven that a business laptop can also be used as a powerful, everyday computer.", "description": "ThinkPads are the most durable and recognizable business machines on the market, and they have been for 25 years. Most of the X1 Extreme\u2019s aesthetics borrow from that heritage. Still, can a $3,000 (as configured) laptop be as compelling as consumer options?", "authors": ["Stefan Etienne", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UWzdQbI6yA8kaFHLZhrwvalBhHQ=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13280163/akrales_181012_3017_0015.jpg", "published_at": "2018-10-26"}
