Having now formally recognised that climate change is a health emergency, the peak organisation representing doctors in Australia is calling on the Morrison government to promote an active transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy; adopt mitigation targets within an Australian carbon budget; promote the health benefits of addressing climate change; and develop a national strategy for health and climate change.\n\nThe AMA president, Tony Bartone, argues the scientific evidence is clear. \u201cThere is no doubt that climate change is a health emergency. The AMA accepts the scientific evidence on climate change and its impact on human health and human wellbeing,\u201d he says.\n\nBartone says the climate science suggests warming will affect human health and wellbeing \u201cby increasing the environment and situations in which infectious diseases can be transmitted, and through more extreme weather events, particularly heatwaves\u201d.\n\n\u201cClimate change will cause higher mortality and morbidity from heat stress,\u201d the AMA president says. \u201cClimate change will cause injury and mortality from increasingly severe weather events. Climate change will cause increases in the transmission of vector-borne diseases. Climate change will cause food insecurity resulting from declines in agricultural outputs. Climate change will cause a higher incidence of mental ill-health.\n\n\u201cThese effects are already being observed internationally and in Australia.\u201d\n\nBartone told Guardian Australia the motion adopted by the federal council had followed an ongoing discussion among stakeholders, and medical practitioners within the AMA membership.\n\nHealth and medical groups, including Doctors for the Environment, the Climate and Health Alliance, the Royal Australian College of Physicians, and the Australian Medical Students\u2019 Association wrote an open letter to all political parties in April pointing out the \u201csignificant and profound impacts climate change has on the health of people and our health system\u201d.\n\nEU to push Australia to clean up petrol standards as part of free trade deal Read more\n\nThe AMA president said the decision to pass the motion followed on from those events both domestically and internationally, and was \u201cpretty much unanimous\u201d internally. \u201cI don\u2019t recall anyone speaking against it,\u201d he said.\n\nAsked whether the current government was pursuing ambitious enough policy action to combat the risks of climate change, whichthe Morrison government argues it is, Bartone said \u201cit\u2019s really difficult to say because this issue is clouded in conjecture and conflicting reports\u201d.\n\nHe said all of the political groups in the Australian parliament had a responsibility to move past the toxic partisan politics that had characterised the debate and find durable solutions to a difficult public policy challenge.\n\nBartone said the AMA would continue to assess the evidence about climate change as it emerged and update its stance to reflect the science.\n\nThe latest official data released last week confirms that greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise in Australia. National emissions increased by 3.1m tonnes in the year to March to reach 538.9m tonnes, a 0.6% jump on the previous year.\n\nEmissions in Australia have increased every year since the Abbott government repealed a national carbon price after taking office in 2013.", "description": "Exclusive: AMA points to \u2018clear scientific evidence indicating severe impacts for our patients and communities\u2019", "authors": ["Katharine Murphy"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e013821498a6ffe63b01506916f2107fb4d957c/0_263_4699_2820/master/4699.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3da1bf9d2572129ae7d4f66ec9a1b503"}
