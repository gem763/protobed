Photo: Warren Orchard/Netflix\n\nAs we quickly approach Halloween proper, movie fans are turning to streaming services for scares more than ever. It helps that Netflix maintains a steady output of original movies for the season, adding to its already impressive collection of horror films.\n\nWe watched as many of the horror offerings under the Netflix Original banner as possible and ranked the best ones. Two notes on qualifications. First, it has to have the already-iconic Netflix boom-boom title card, so stuff that they picked up but don\u2019t consider a \u201cNetflix property\u201d for whatever reason (like the great Under the Shadow) doesn\u2019t qualify. Second, it has to be a horror movie. There are some thrillers (like Hold the Dark and Rebirth) and sci-fi action movies (like Spectral) that aren\u2019t quite technically horror. With that said, here are Netflix\u2019s best twelve original horror flicks.\n\n12. The Babysitter (2017)\n\nMcG\u2019s 2017 horror-comedy has developed something of a cult following in the two years since it dropped on Netflix, to the degree that the team behind it are actually working on a sequel. It helps that Samara Weaving has become a bigger star behind hit films like Ready or Not. She\u2019s also the best thing here, playing Bee, a sweet babysitter who looks like she may be the first crush for the kid she watches, a 12-year-old named Cole. One night, Cole gets up to see what Bee does after he goes to bed \u2014 only to discover that the object of his preteen affection is actually the leader of a demonic cult. This is a deeply stupid movie, but in the kind of way you sometimes want around Halloween: a comedy-horror hybrid with a game performance from future star Weaving. (The bad news is that she\u2019s reportedly not returning for the sequel.)\n\n11. In the Tall Grass (2019)\n\nNetflix dropped a new genre movie every week in October, and most of them fell pretty flat \u2014 but this flick from writer-director Vincenzo Natali was the best of the bunch. The Cube director adapts a short story by Stephen King and his son, Joe Hill, about a pair of siblings (Laysla De Oliveira and Avery Whitted) who hear a boy crying out for help in a field of tall grass by the side of a relatively deserted road. They head into the weeds to try and save the boy, only to quickly learn the error of their ways. It\u2019s a great concept that\u2019s, admittedly, a bit overwritten by Natali, but it contains a fun performance from Patrick Wilson, as well as some visual strength that the filmmaker likely brought with him from his excellent work on Hannibal.\n\n10. Malevolent (2018)\n\nStill in the \u201cyeah, it\u2019s okay\u201d section of the top ten is one of Netflix\u2019s most recent offerings, a ghost story that takes a hard turn into something closer to torture porn in the final act. There\u2019s some really effective filmmaking before then, largely due to the grounded, in-the-moment performance from Florence Pugh, an about-to-breakout star who went on to feature in films by David Mackenzie (Hell or High Water), Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird), and Ari Aster (Hereditary). Here, she plays a faux ghostbuster, conning people out of their money with her brother, who finds out that some ghosts are real. The end of this movie is a mess, but Pugh does enough good work in the first hour to justify a look.\n\n9. 1922 (2017)\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be a list of horror movies without a Stephen King adaptation or two, and this Zak Hilditch period piece is based on one of the master\u2019s novellas from the 2010 anthology, Full Dark, No Stars. Thomas Jane is excellent as Wilfred James, a Nebraska farmer with a very unhappy wife, played by Molly Parker. When it become clear that Wilf\u2019s wife is insistent on moving back to the city, the farmer decides she has to go, even convincing his son to help him. It\u2019s essentially one of King\u2019s riffs on murderous guilt \u00e0 la The Tell-Tale Heart, with a seemingly good man going from one awful deed to flat-out insanity. It can\u2019t quite hold for its running time (as often happens with short stories turned into long films), but there\u2019s some unforgettable imagery here.\n\n8. Calibre (2018)\n\nThis is the only film on this list that one could argue isn\u2019t really a horror film, but the final act gets so Wicker Man weird that we\u2019ve decided it qualifies. It starts as a pretty terrifying thriller, the inciting incident being a hunting accident in which one of the protagonists accidentally shoots a child. It gets worse from there. When they decide to try to hide their crimes, things go downhill fast. Here\u2019s the moral message: When one of your mates says \u201cno harm done\u201d after the murders of two people, you know you\u2019re in trouble.\n\n7. Cargo (2018)\n\nIsn\u2019t it amazing that there are any new stories to tell in the zombie subgenre? Just when you think they\u2019ve run out of ideas, along comes an effectively human story such as this piece, starring the always excellent Martin Freeman of Sherlock and The Hobbit fame. He stars as Andy, a man deep in the Australian outback, where things go very undead. The clever twist here is that the bitten don\u2019t turn instantly \u2014 they have 48 hours to come to terms with their impending appetite for brains. It makes for a melancholy take on the genre we haven\u2019t really seen before, other than in the other Netflix zombie flick with a twist \u2026\n\n6. Ravenous (2017)\n\nJust as Cargo has a somber tone, this French-Canadian zombie flick captures the depressive state that would fall over the world if most of its residents became hungry for flesh. What works so well about director Robin Aubert\u2019s Ravenous is the world creation he offers us via the brief glimpses of a few surviving characters. The film jumps around a rural landscape, finding a few random survivors just waiting for their next horrifying encounter. Fans of a certain AMC series, take note: Ravenous has echoes of The Walking Dead in the way it captures how the survivors may actually be worse off than those who died.\n\n5. The Perfection (2019)\n\nUnless it\u2019s been spoiled for you, it\u2019s impossible to know exactly where Richard Shepard\u2019s cuckoo bananas movie is headed. At first, it feels like an intense relationship drama not unlike Black Swan but then it takes a sharp turn into something more akin to the body horror pioneered by David Cronenberg. And then it takes another turn into something even darker and stranger. Allison Williams and Logan Browning take us through this twisted journey of violin prodigies who, well, you just need to see it for yourself. Don\u2019t let anyone else spoil it for you.\n\n4. I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House (2016)\n\nProbably the most divisive film on this list is writer-director Osgood Perkins\u2019s (son of Psycho star Anthony) moody ghost story, a film way more interested in getting under your skin than making you jump. The Affair star Ruth Wilson stars as a live-in nurse at what could be a haunted house. With long takes and creepy sound design, Perkins\u2019s film is a challenging one, but it\u2019s a movie that does that one important thing that all the best ghost stories do: coming back to you in the middle of the night like a cinematic haunting.\n\n3. Hush (2016)\n\nArguably more of a thriller than a horror film, Mike Flanagan\u2019s second film on this list qualifies in the same way that The Strangers or even Scream qualifies \u2014 it\u2019s one of the few \u201cslasher pics\u201d from the last few years that actually works. The reason it does is because it\u2019s one of the few to have an original idea. (Well, at least as original as 1967\u2019s Wait Until Dark, which probably inspired it.) If you\u2019ve been watching Hill House and wondering where you recognized Kate Siegel\u2019s Theo from, it\u2019s from here: She co-wrote and starred as Maddie, a deaf writer terrorized in the middle of the night. It\u2019s effective, hair-raising filmmaking, with a great turn from Siegel.\n\n2. Apostle (2018)\n\nEvery horror section needs a batshit-crazy entry, the kind of gorefest you put on in the middle-of-the-night portion of your movie marathon just to keep everyone awake. The first hour of this slow burn from The Raid director Gareth Evans may be a tough haul if you start this at 3 a.m., but the second hour will wake everyone up. What first appears to be a gritty riff on The Wicker Man becomes an insane, gory riff on, well, The Wicker Man. Starring Dan Stevens (with a key supporting performance Michael Sheen), The Apostle follows a man invading a cult to find his kidnapped sister, and the closing scenes are as loony as anything you could watch on Netflix \u2014 or anywhere else really. Some love it, some hate it, but no one will forget it.\n\n1. Gerald\u2019s Game (2017)\n\nIs it possible for a later work to make a previous one better? When we see a filmmaker exploring similar themes in a recent work, it often highlights how he did so in earlier films. Such is the case with Mike Flanagan\u2019s Gerald\u2019s Game, which was a good movie last year but feels even better in light of Hill House, and not only because both feature great performances by Carla Gugino and Henry Thomas. Flanagan expertly pulls out the human themes of Stephen King\u2019s story of a woman trapped in a waking nightmare and how the trauma of her past influences her survival chances, and Gugino gives the best performance on this list \u2014 fearless and unforgettable.", "description": "Looking for the best horror movies on Netflix?
