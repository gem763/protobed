Today, the fertile land is part of a booming Israeli wine industry.\n\nBut two wineries serve up a different story with every glass: the Arab-Palestinian tradition of winemaking.\n\nAshkar winery, located near the border with Lebanon, and Jascala winery, further east in upper Galilee, are the only commercial Palestinian-owned wineries inside Israel.\n\n\u201cWe fill a niche,\u201d said Nemi Ashkar during a tour of his winery in Kafir Yassif. His main clients are Arab-owned restaurants in cities such as Nazareth, Haifa and Acre, as well as restaurants in Tel Aviv seeking to avoid wine made on controversial Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. He also sells to the famed Israeli chef Yotam Ottolenghi.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ashkar winery owner Nemi Ashkar and his father, Maarof, 91 \u2013 who are both Christians \u2013 relax after monthly church prayers in Iqrit.

His family is Christian and part of the Arab communities that remained in Israel after its founding in 1948. Another 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled, and their descendants today remain refugees. Israel\u2019s Arab citizens have historically played a marginal role in national politics; but the country\u2019s Arab-majority parties are now a core part of the bloc in Israel\u2019s parliament trying to oust the long-standing prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, after communities turned out in high numbers in the latest election.\n\nFor Ashkar, the most important part of his business is the label inscribing each bottle, designed by his daughter, a graphic designer. It shows Iqrit, his family\u2019s ancestral home, and its church, which is all that remains after Israeli authorities destroyed the village in 1951. \u201cI\u2019m telling the story of Iqrit with this wine,\u201d he said.\n\nAmid the fighting in 1948, the 500 residents of Iqrit voluntarily left with a promise from Israeli forces that they could return soon. It never happened. Instead, after the war, Israel placed Arab communities in the new country under military rule. On Christmas Eve of 1951, Israel razed the village, destroying everything but the Greek Catholic church and adjacent cemetery.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jascala winery here in the valley of Jish started to formally make its produce in 2003 and produces 30,000 bottles a year.

What remains of the village feels as if it\u2019s on top of the world, isolated from the passage of time by gentle breezes and engulfed by waves of green hills all around.\n\nWinemaking had long been a favourite pastime in Iqrit. While alcohol is forbidden in Islam, wine was popular among Arab Christians, although its presence in the Middle East has severely diminished over the last century.\n\n\u201cIt was a hobby,\u201d Ashkar said. \u201cMy family and my grandparents were winemakers just for family use.\u201d Back then, they used uncultivated, native grapes for a sweeter taste than today\u2019s wines from commercial varieties.\n\nThe Ashkar family\u2019s love of winemaking did not diminish with their move to Kafir Yassif, 30 km away. But it wasn\u2019t until 2005 when Ashkar, working in Israel\u2019s tech industry, took a work trip to Silicon Valley and felt inspired by the winegrowers of northern California. He started making wine again and in 2010 founded the winery.\n\nThe first vineyard Ashkar bought grapes from is run by a Jewish-Israeli man, on land he said used to be part of Iqrit. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, Israel\u2019s lands authority confiscated Iqrit\u2019s land, as it did for other depopulated Arab-Palestinian villages, and now through various bodies loans some of this land out. In practice, it\u2019s extremely difficult for a non-Jewish citizen to lease state land.\n\nAshkar said he had good business relations and was now friends with the owner of the vineyard. As he moved into the commercial market in 2009, he started to buy grapes from two other nearby vineyards without an Iqrit connection and, a decade later, is looking to expand again.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People in Lebanon celebrate wine and the Arab makers in Israel reflect its growing popularity in the region.

Winemaking was a long-standing tradition for the Kharish family, also Christian, and in 2003 they decided to start something more formal.\n\nBrothers Nasser and Richard are now the heart of the operation: Nasser, 40, cultivates the grapes, and Richard, 44, is the winemaker.\n\nNasser had just finished a degree in political science when he returned home to help his ageing father with the farming, then being done by workers from Thailand. He decided to stay.\n\n\u201cI feel really connected to the land,\u201d he said of life on the vineyard. \u201cIt\u2019s different from anything I\u2019ve done in my life. It\u2019s so satisfying \u2026 All of the time you\u2019re dealing with something that grows with you.\u201d\n\nJascala now makes 30,000 bottles a year and sells it mainly in Ramallah and Jerusalem, as well as Haifa, Nazareth and Tel Aviv.\n\nThere is, however, a limited market within Israel for non-kosher wine: both Ashkar and Jascala are not kosher according to the Jewish dietary restrictions that dominate Israel\u2019s food market. Kosher wine can only be produced by Sabbath-observing Jews in regulated conditions or alternatively boiled, which lessens the quality.\n\nAn Israeli citizen, Nasser Kharish, said he also identified as Palestinian, which \u201cis difficult for Jewish Israelis to hear that. But it\u2019s true. I\u2019m Palestinian. I\u2019m part of the people.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI don\u2019t really feel that the Jewish-Israeli producers look at me differently as Palestinian or as Arab, [like] that they don\u2019t want me or don\u2019t like me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey treat me as a winemaker.\u201d", "description": "Restaurants that want to avoid the drink made on controversial settlements are the main clients", "authors": ["Miriam Berger In Iqrit"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e18407c895b113f9566f1777cb2849d74641e1c3/173_709_3859_2315/master/3859.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9c1d97379557080413e9654d4e785fb0", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
