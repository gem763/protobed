That made it imperative for Labor leader Anthony Albanese to tell his union paymasters to dump the Trump talk on our new trade agreements with Indonesia, Hong Kong, and Peru. The Australian Council of Trade Unions predictably carps about more foreign workers arriving, or the investor protections the agreement gives to Indonesian companies (as it does to Australian companies in Indonesia). Mr Albanese told them to look instead at the jobs that Indonesia\u2019s development plans might create around Australia, at the NSW steel or the Queensland farm produce which might be sold.\n\nAs Paul Keating would surely argue, an economically strengthened Indonesia, and a deal which creates another closer strategic link to Jakarta, can only be good for Australia. Indonesia\u2019s newly re-inaugurated President Joko Widodo wants to take Indonesia into the Transpacific Partnership, or even bring Australia into the Association of South-East Asian Nations club. Both organisations embody multilateralism in the Asian region, and are a critical counter-balance to the sheer weight of China. Even just such a suggestion, from a nation whose diplomacy and leadership has traditionally been low-key, is important and is built upon by the free trade deal.\n\nA free trade deal would give Australian businesses better access to Indonesia's huge domestic market. Bloomberg\n\nUnlike neighbouring export tigers such as Singapore or Malaysia, Indonesia is a vast inward-looking economy driven by domestic consumption and its 50 million strong middle class. Its domestic markets are dominated by opaque vested commercial and political interests. For Mr Joko, that makes his Australian trade deal more valuable as a means to open up the Indonesian economy to the global marketplace, driving both domestic efficiencies and new export opportunities. Australia took that step four decades ago. Linking this to Indonesia will exploit the two nations\u2019 economic complementarity in areas like services, mining expertise, and Indonesian workers to help care for ageing Australians. That will make both sides more prosperous in the process.", "description": "A deal with Indonesia is a strategic and economic advantage.
