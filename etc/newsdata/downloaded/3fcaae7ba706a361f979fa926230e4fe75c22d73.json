Lehtikuva/Mikko Stig via REUTERS\n\nThe Finnish company, rival to Sweden\u2019s Ericsson (ERICb.ST) and China\u2019s Huawei, slashed its 2019 and 2020 profit outlook last week, saying profit would come under pressure as the company spends more to fend off rivals in the fast-growing 5G networks business.\n\nNokia has recruited 350 staff in Finland this year, 240 in its mobile networks unit and many dedicated to developing SoC (system on chip) integrated circuits - a key element for its 5G equipment, a Nokia spokeswoman said via email.\n\n\u201cIt is true that we have hired 5G development personnel lately, not only in Oulu but also in Tampere and Espoo,\u201d the head of Nokia\u2019s networks unit Tommi Uitto was quoted saying in Finland\u2019s largest daily Helsingin Sanomat.\n\nThe company has sped up its hiring since he started in his position a year ago, Uitto added.\n\nNokia shares plunged 21% last Thursday after the company posted disappointing third-quarter results and slashed its outlook. Nokia shares are down 30% this year.\n\nNokia reshuffled its management a year ago, replacing former head of mobile networks Marc Rouanne with Tommi Uitto, a Finn described by the company as an \u201cexpert in radio technologies\u201d.\n\n\u201cRoughly a year ago I made a change in the networks unit\u2019s leadership. With that I wanted to ensure that we have the right understanding and aim on how we will proceed with 5G. I am convinced that we now have it,\u201d Nokia\u2019s chief executive Rajeev Suri wrote in an emailed statement to the paper.\n\nNokia\u2019s key customers in its biggest 5G market - North America - have limited their spending due to proposed mergers.\n\nLast week, Nokia warned about losses from mergers such as T-Mobile US Inc\u2019s (TMUS.O) proposed $26.5 billion tie-up with Sprint Corp (S.N), which in October won formal approval from the Federal Communications Commission.\n\nNokia is a key supplier to both telecoms companies, which have slowed spending as their potential merger faces court challenges.\n\nNokia\u2019s performance is in sharp contrast with that of its Swedish rival Ericsson which last week beat quarterly earnings expectations and lifted its market forecast for this year and its sales target for 2020.", "description": "Telecom network equipment maker Nokia has hired hundreds of engineers in Finland this year to speed up its 5G development, the company said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446497309&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0MX", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
