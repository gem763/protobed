If Facebook really wants to bring financial services to the \u201cunbanked,\u201d it should try doing it on a smaller scale than these companies\u2019 presence promised. And even then, the probability of failure will be high.\n\nIt\u2019s clear why PayPal Holdings Inc., Stripe Inc., eBay Inc., MasterCard Inc. and Visa Inc. have decided not to join the Libra Association, which Facebook has been organizing to run the proposed digital currency. They took seriously the recent warning of Senators Brian Schatz of Hawaii and Sherrod Brown of Ohio that because of their membership, they could \u201cexpect a high level of scrutiny from regulators not only on Libra-related payment activities, but on all payment activities.\u201d The concern is that a cryptocurrency used in conjunction with encrypted messaging could potentially be used in illegal transactions, and anyone involved in creating such an opportunity would be suspect.\n\nU.S. regulators are perfectly capable of scuppering major cryptocurrency projects. On Oct. 11, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced it had stopped Telegram Group Inc. from distributing digital tokens, so-called Grams, to the investors who contributed $1.7 billion to the creation of the cryptocurrency last year. These include major U.S. venture capital firms such as Benchmark, Sequoia and Lightspeed. The same could easily happen to Libra.\n\nThat\u2019s the problem with starting so big. Telegram\u2019s token offering was the biggest ever recorded. Facebook made a big announcement on Libra and presented a list of partners that read like a Who\u2019s Who of the payments industry. They envisaged global launches for their cryptocurrencies. Of course regulators and politicians were alarmed.\n\nTo avoid this kind of outcome, Facebook \u2014 whose stated goal with Libra is to offer affordable payment services and loans to people currently priced out of the financial services market \u2014 could have tried the strategy that got results for one of its remaining partners, Vodafone Group Plc.\n\nVodafone launched M-Pesa, Kenya\u2019s storied \u201cmobile money,\u201d in 2007, and one of the project\u2019s major assets was the Kenyan central bank\u2019s consent to the launch without any formal regulation. Vodafone\u2019s local cellular operator, Safaricom Plc, quickly built up a network of stores where people without bank accounts could pay in and receive cash, and old-fashioned mobile phones began to double as wallets for transfers and purchases. The lack of regulatory intervention and the large physical network, fed by relatively generous commissions, made sure that by 2019, M-Pesa claimed 37 million active customers in seven African countries.\n\nBut attempts to transplant the service to many other markets have failed. Vodafone has closed M-Pesa in India (in part because of regulatory obstacles), South Africa (low customer interest), Romania and Albania (apparently it was unprofitable). Vodafone discovered there was no cookie-cutter solution. In different countries, lenders, retailers and mobile operators offered competing services, and regulatory scrutiny varied.\n\nTo find countries in which to launch such an electronic money service, one would need to go down the list of nations with large populations of the unbanked. The top 20, according to the World Bank, includes big ones, such as China, India, Indonesia and Brazil.\n\nBut in most of these countries, people are already using some form of digital money in lieu of dealing with traditional financial institutions. That\u2019s why the list of 20 countries with the smallest percentage of people who have recently made or received digital payments looks completely different.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s not easy to find a country where a lot of people have neither a bank account nor access to other kinds of financial services. And then there\u2019s a chance that the cash-using population of a specific country wants to stay that way. One possible reason M-Pesa didn\u2019t quite work in Albania and Romania is that these countries have large informal economies. With up to a third of gross domestic product \u201cin the shadow,\u201d traceable electronic transactions are unattractive compared with cash.\n\nStory continues", "description": "(Bloomberg Opinion) -- It\u2019s just as well that big companies that process and facilitate payments have quit Facebook\u2019s Libra cryptocurrency project, fearing a regulatory backlash.
