John Allen, the former commander of American forces in Afghanistan and former special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS, condemned Trump\u2019s policy in northern Syria, telling CNN, \u201cThere is blood on Trump\u2019s hands for abandoning our Kurdish allies.\u201d\n\nAllen added, \u201cThis is what happens when Trump follows his instincts and because of his alignment with autocrats.\u201d\n\nLast night, Trump\u2019s former Defense secretary, retired four-star Marine Gen. James Mattis had a little fun at his former boss\u2019 expense. Referencing disparaging comments about him Trump made to congressional leaders this week \u2013 the president called him \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general\u201d \u2013 Mattis joked, \u201cI\u2019m honored to be considered that by Donald Trump because he also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress. So I guess I\u2019m the Meryl Streep of generals and frankly that sounds pretty good to me.\u201d\n\nBut perhaps most striking of all is a new op-ed in the New York Times from retired Adm. William McRaven, the former commander of the U.S. Special Operations Command, and the military leader best known to Americans as the Navy SEAL who oversaw the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden.\n\nMcRaven wrote about some recent military events he attended, and at one of them a retired four-star general grabbed his arm and shouted, \u201cI don\u2019t like the Democrats, but Trump is destroying the Republic!\u201d It led the retired admiral to reflect on the president\u2019s willingness to break faith with American allies and American principles.\n\nIf our promises are meaningless, how will our allies ever trust us? If we can\u2019t have faith in our nation\u2019s principles, why would the men and women of this nation join the military? And if they don\u2019t join, who will protect us? If we are not the champions of the good and the right, then who will follow us? And if no one follows us \u2013 where will the world end up? President Trump seems to believe that these qualities are unimportant or show weakness. He is wrong. These are the virtues that have sustained this nation for the past 243 years. If we hope to continue to lead the world and inspire a new generation of young men and women to our cause, then we must embrace these values now more than ever. And if this president doesn\u2019t understand their importance, if this president doesn\u2019t demonstrate the leadership that America needs, both domestically and abroad, then it is time for a new person in the Oval Office \u2013 Republican, Democrat or independent \u2013 the sooner, the better. The fate of our Republic depends upon it.\n\nThe headline on the opinion piece read, \u201cOur Republic Is Under Attack From the President.\u201d\n\nThis comes on the heels of Mark Bowden\u2019s recent piece for The Atlantic on what it\u2019s like for U.S. troops to serve under Donald Trump. \u201cIn 20 years of writing about the military, I have never heard officers in high positions express such alarm about a president,\u201d the article noted.\n\nAlas, we can probably guess how Trump will respond. Indeed, after earlier McRaven criticisms last year, the president sat down with Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace and dismissed the decorated admiral and his service.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a Hilary Clinton backer and an Obama backer,\u201d Trump falsely asserted. Referring specifically to the bin Laden raid, the president added, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it have been nice if we got Osama Bin Laden a lot sooner than that, wouldn\u2019t it have been nice?\u201d\n\nAs we discussed at the time, Trump\u2019s support for our military is limited to those in the military who agree with him, and his respect for four-star admirals and generals is conditional on whether or not they say nice things about him.\n\nOf course, at this rate, the number of admirals and generals eager to say nice things about him appears to be dwindling.", "description": "It's been quite a week for retired American military leaders who have serious concerns about Donald Trump.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/styles/ratio--1_91-1--1200x630/public/videos/n_hallie_brk_trump_financial_191011_1920x1080.jpg?itok=vkG06OP9", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
