He rose through the ranks to lieutenant general in 2011.\n\n\"Before being appointed as acting provincial commissioner for KwaZulu-Natal, Mkhwanazi occupied several positions within the service including that of head: special task force (STF) and divisional commissioner: human resource development, as well as the acting national commissioner of police.\"\n\nMkhwanazi holds a BTech degree in policing as well as a national diploma in police administration.\n\nSitole said the Western Cape provincial commissioner position would be temporarily filled by Lieutenant General Sindile Mfazi, the current deputy national commissioner of management advisory services.\n\n\"Mfazi's appointment forms part of the national stabilisation intervention currently being implemented in the Western Cape.\n\nThe SAPS management is confident that the appointment of Mfazi into this acting position will add value to the intervention programme while the process of appointing a permanent provincial commissioner is unfolding,\" Sitole said.\n\nPosition to be filled soon\n\nThe process to appoint a permanent provincial commissioner will begin on August 1 and is expected to be completed by the end of the same month, Sitole said.\n\nThe national commissioner expressed his \"heartfelt gratitude\" to Jula for the work he had done in the Western Cape.\n\n\"Having served in KwaZulu-Natal for the majority of his police career, coupled with the position of provincial commissioner of the Western Cape, makes him one of the most experienced to take up the vacant position of provincial commissioner: KwaZulu-Natal,\u201d said Sitole.\n\nSitole also thanked Mkhwanazi for moving from Pretoria.\n\n\"Lieutenant General Mkhwanzi's experience and expertise speaks volumes of his capability to hold the position of divisional commissioner: operational response services,\" said Sitole.\n\n\"I hold all these managers in high regard and I am sure that they will optimally guide those under their command to ensure a safer South Africa.\"\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
