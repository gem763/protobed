The data from Donald Trump\u2019s favorite network showed, among other things, that 51% of Americans support the president\u2019s impeachment and removal from office. The same results pointed to large segments of the population criticizing Trump\u2019s \u201cdealings with the Ukrainian president.\u201d\n\nNot surprisingly, a variety of news outlets, including the New York Times, took note of the Fox poll. According to Trump, that\u2019s a mistake.\n\nPresident Trump on Monday blasted The New York Times for using in one of its stories last week\u2019s Fox News poll that said a majority of respondents wanted his impeachment. \u201cThe Fox Impeachment poll has turned out to be incorrect,\u201d he tweeted Monday. \u201cThis was announced on Friday. Despite this, the Corrupt New York Times used this poll in one of its stories, no mention of the correction which they knew about full well!\u201d\n\nIn reality, there was no correction to \u201cmention.\u201d The president appeared to reference this New York Post piece, which argued that the sample in the Fox News poll included too many Democrats.\n\n\u201cPrinceton, New Jersey, pollster Braun Research, which conducted the survey, noted 48% of its respondents were Democrats,\u201d the New York Post\u2019s analysis read. \u201cBut the actual breakdown of party affiliation is 31% Democrat, 29% Republican and 38% independent, according to Gallup.\u201d\n\nThere are two important angles to this. The first is the flaw in the New York Post\u2019s analysis, which may make Trump feel better, but which is nevertheless mistaken. The second is the re-emergence of poll denialism.\n\nLet\u2019s tackle these one at a time. At first blush, the effort to discredit the results from the Fox News poll may seem compelling: if Gallup says 31% of the electorate is Democratic, while Fox\u2019s poll says it\u2019s 48%, then many might look at the results as weighted and misleading. The trouble is, the New York Post may not have looked closely enough at the Gallup data its analysis cited.\n\nGallup asked self-identified independents, \u201cAs of today, do you lean more to the Democratic Party or the Republican Party?\u201d With these \u201cleaners\u201d added to the mix, the Democratic electorate goes from 31% to 49%.\n\nAll of which tells us the sample in the Fox News poll wasn\u2019t especially slanted after all. When Trump asserted yesterday that that poll \u201cturned out to be incorrect,\u201d this was \u201cannounced,\u201d and there was a \u201ccorrection,\u201d he was completely wrong on each point.\n\nBut it\u2019s the bigger picture that\u2019s worth keeping in mind in the coming months, because the president is likely to keep trying to discredit survey results that fail to satisfy him.\n\nIn April 2018, Trump called into a radio talk show and argued that when it comes to understanding his public support, the responsible thing to do is take his approval rating and then \u201cadd another 7 or 8 points to it.\u201d The president said this accounts for those people who like him, but are too embarrassed to admit to pollsters.\n\nSoon after, at a rally in North Dakota, Trump pointed to a non-existent group of people to bolster his practice: \u201cThey said, some great people, they said, \u2018Any time Trump gets a poll, add 12 to it.\u2019\u201d\n\nMore recently, Trump argued that people can add 15 percentage points to independent data on his public support, simply because he says so.\n\nIf this sounds vaguely familiar, it\u2019s because poll denialism was a staple of Republican thought seven years ago. The Atlantic had this report in November 2012:\n\nMitt Romney and Paul Ryan both believed the public polls were wrong, and that they\u2019d win on Election Day. Their wives did, too. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was one person who saw this coming,\u201d a senior adviser told CBS News\u2019 Jan Crawford. An advisor said of Romney, \u201cHe was shellshocked.\u201d When Romney claimed on Election Day that he hadn\u2019t written a concession speech, it sounded like trash talk. Apparently it wasn\u2019t. How could they not have seen it coming? [\u2026] Conservatives began claiming the polls were wrong, that they vastly overestimated what turnout levels would be among blacks, Latinos, and young people. UnSkewedPolls.com changed the number of Democrats and Republicans in polls to show Romney leading everywhere. You\u2019d expect Romney\u2019s campaign to play this up publicly to maintain supporters\u2019 enthusiasm \u2013 like when political director Rich Beeson said the Sunday before the election that Romney would win more than 300 electoral college votes. But you don\u2019t expect them to actually believe it. But Romney, his wife, Ryan, and his wife apparently did.\n\nIn the months leading up to Election Day 2012, many Republicans managed to convince themselves that independent pollsters simply didn\u2019t know what they were doing. A site called UnSkewedPolls.com became quite popular in GOP circles because it took real results and shifted the data in a Republican-friendly direction, based entirely on the idea that all professional pollsters were relying on an inaccurate turnout model.\n\nThose beliefs were ridiculous; Barack Obama cruised to a relatively easy re-election; GOP officials were stunned, and UnSkewedPolls.com became a punchline and a cautionary tale about the dangers of poll denialism.\n\nSeven years later, some Republicans \u2013 including the one in the Oval Office \u2013 apparently missed the point of that cautionary tale.", "description": "Republican poll denialism in 2012 created a cautionary tale.
