James Clyburn: 'There would be strong support against the Bill of Rights' today", "language": "en", "text": "House Majority Whip James Clyburn said Sunday that he doubts the Bill of Rights would survive a vote in today\u2019s political climate.\n\n\u201cI really believe sincerely \u2014 the climate that we\u2019re in today \u2014 if the Bill of Rights, the first 10 amendments of the United States Constitution, were put before the public today, I\u2019m not too sure that we would hold onto the Bill of Rights,\u201d the South Carolina Democrat told MSNBC on Sunday.\n\n\u201cEspecially when I see what people are doing with the Second Amendment and no telling what they would do with the First Amendment, as well as the others,\u201d he said.\n\nMSNBC\u2019s David Gura responded by calling Mr. Clyburn\u2019s comments \u201cstartling.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou really believe that?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Mr. Clyburn replied. \u201cThere would be strong support against the Bill of Rights. Go through the Bill of Rights and I\u2019ll tell you I run into people every day who would like to see so much of those guarantees uprooted.\u201d\n\nMr. Clyburn made the remarks while defending his support for the controversial 1994 crime bill, which critics argue has disproportionately targeted low-income and minority communities. Sen. and Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has proposed repealing the bill, but Mr. Clyburn said Sunday that throwing things out is not the American way.\n\n\u201cI do not agree with pulling things up by the root,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t tear stuff up in order to improve on it. \u2026 We don\u2019t start over in this country, we correct our faults.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
