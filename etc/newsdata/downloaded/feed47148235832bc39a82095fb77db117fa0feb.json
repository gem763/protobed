If the lorry came from Bulgaria, getting into Britain via Holyhead is an unorthodox route,\" Seamus Leheny, Northern Ireland policy manager for the Freight Transport Association (FTA), said.\n\nBoris Johnson said he is receiving \"regular updates\" on Essex Police's murder investigation while specialist teams work at Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays .\n\nThe bodies, which include that of a teenager, were found there in the red and white lorry's container at around 1.40am.\n\n(Image: Sky News)\n\nDan Peters, from a hydraulic maintenance company on the industrial estate, said it was \"terrible\" news.\n\n\"We\u2019re not able to gain access to our units to open up for daily business,\" the Pirtek managing director said.\n\n\"Obviously, it\u2019s terrible news.\"\n\nHere is everything we know so far about this appalling tragedy.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nWhen were the bodies found?\n\nEmergency services confirmed they were called to the industrial park at 1.40am this morning.\n\nThe 39 people were pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nSince then, officers made the arrest and have continued enquiries.\n\n\"We have arrested the lorry driver in connection with the incident who remains in police custody as our enquiries continue,\" a police spokesman said.\n\n\"I appreciate this cordon is going to disrupt the activity of local businesses in the area and we will work to ensure that disruption is kept as short as possible. We are working with Thurrock Council to mitigate against any impact our investigation scene will have locally.\u201d\n\n\"A cordon has been put in place and access to and from the Waterglade Industrial Park remains closed.\"\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n(Image: Skty News)\n\nHow did the lorry arrive there?\n\nPolice say the lorry, said to be from Bulgaria, entered the county at Holyhead in North Wales on Saturday, October 19.\n\nFerries sail out of Holyhead port to Dublin in Ireland.\n\nIt is the principal link for road vehicles to get from England and Wales to Ireland.\n\nMore than two million people travel through the port each year, which is operated by Stena Line Ports Ltd.\n\nRoad Haulage Association chief executive Richard Burnett said the lorry could have travelled on a ferry from Cherbourg, France, to Rosslare, Ireland, before driving to Dublin and taking another ferry to Holyhead, North Wales and then reaching Kent by road.\n\nHe told PA: \"It's highly unlikely that if this vehicle has come from Europe that it's been physically checked.\n\n\"Because of the migrant issue at Dover and Calais, you've got far more checks that are taking place there. You've got heartbeat monitors, you've got dogs, you've got CO2. Those checks are done as you drive through.\n\n\"Cherbourg, because it's a low volume port, you probably won't have the same security measures that they have in Coquelles, Calais, for the high number of vehicles that are stepping through there and that's been one of the main migrant routes historically.\n\n\"If this is somebody trying to smuggle a significant number of people through then maybe Cherbourg has been picked because it's a little easier to get through.\"\n\n(Image: EssexLive/ WS)\n\nWhat route did the lorry take?\n\nThe container containing the bodies of 39 people was collected in Belfast and then travelled to Dublin, it has been revealed.\n\nThe truck travelled down the M1 motorway past Dundalk and Drogheda and on to Dublin in the last few days.\n\nIt is suspected that the bodies were in the container was it made its way across the border into the Republic.\n\nIt then went through Dublin Port where it experienced no delays and onto the ferry to Hollyhead in Anglesea, Wales.\n\nFrom there it travelled through the UK to the industrial estate in Essex were it was found.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHow have officers been investigating?\n\nSince the young man was arrested, Essex Police continued enquiries.\n\nThey've worked with Thurrock Council to help mitigate against any impact our investigation scene.\n\nBut access to and from the industrial park remains closed.\n\nForensic tents and police cars have been pictured at the scene throughout the day.\n\nThey continue to appeal for information in the \"lengthy investigation\".\n\nThey also intend to identify the victims in the next stage of the probe.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nHas anything like this happened before?\n\nA similar incident happened 19 years ago in Kent.\n\nIn June 2000 the bodies of 58 Chinese migrants were found in the back of a lorry in Dover.\n\nTwo other migrants survived.\n\nDutch lorry driver Perry Wacker was convicted of manslaughter in 2001 and jailed for 14 years.\n\nIn 2003 nine members of the Chinese snakehead gang - an organised crime group - were jailed for their part in the tragedy.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nWho has reacted to the tragic news?\n\nBoris Johnson said he was \"appalled\" to hear of the tragedy.\n\nThe Prime Minister tweeted: \"I\u2019m appalled by this tragic incident in Essex.\n\n\"I am receiving regular updates and the Home Office will work closely with Essex Police as we establish exactly what has happened. My thoughts are with all those who lost their lives & their loved ones.\"\n\nHe also said he is receiving \"regular updates\" on the murder investigation.\n\nThurrock MP Jackie Doyle-Price tweeted: \u201cSickening news of 39 people found dead in a container in Grays. People trafficking is a vile and dangerous business. This is a big investigation for Essex Police\n\n\u201cLets hope they bring these murderers to justice\u201d.\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel tweeted: \"Shocked & saddened by this utterly tragic incident in Grays. Essex Police has arrested an individual and we must give them the space to conduct their investigations.\"\n\nDUP leader Arlene Foster has also tweeted about the tragedy.\n\nShe wrote: \"Horrifying news coming from Essex this morning. Thinking of those who have impacted and their families during such a distressing time.\"\n\n(Image: Sky News)\n\nWhat is expected to happen next?\n\nPolice said this will be a lengthy process.\n\nThe force wants to identify the victims and establish their nationalities.\n\nIt continues to appeal for the public's help.", "description": "Essex Police are investigating one of the biggest murder investigations in British history after the bodies were found in the lorry container at Waterglade Industrial Park in Grays", "authors": ["Bradley Jolly", "Image", "Sky News", "Pa", "Skty News", "Essexlive", "Ws", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20705047.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Bodies-found-in-lorry-container.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
