She was there alongside her daughter, Chelsea, to promote the book they co-wrote, \"The Book of Gutsy Women,\u201d a collection of essays about more than 100 inspirational women throughout world history.\n\n\u201cSo let the impeachment inquiry proceed,\u201d Clinton added. \u201cI know that they will do a thoughtful, thorough job. Nobody should jump to any conclusions.\u201d\n\nLast week House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the inquiry after the White House released a memo of a controversial July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. That was followed by the release of an anonymous whistleblower complaint against the president, which was based on the conversation. It detailed repeated attempts by Trump and his allies to enlist Ukrainian officials to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, including allegations the administration delayed almost $400 million in military aid to Ukraine as leverage. Depositions and hearings on the matter will begin this week.\n\nTrump has tweeted a series of demands for the identity of the whistleblower and threats against House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff, who is leading the probe.\n\nHillary Clinton discusses the House impeachment inquiry on \"Good Morning America.\" (Photo: ABCNews.com) More\n\nClinton, who lost the 2016 presidential election to Trump despite winning the popular vote, said she thinks the president\u2019s attempt to \u201cfind out\u201d the identity of the whistleblower, a member of the intelligence community, at this stage in the inquiry process would be \u201cvery dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom everything we know, and we don\u2019t know much, this is an experienced person who saw things that bothered him. That\u2019s what the whole whistleblower statute is for, and it is to protect their identity. And I understand he\u2019s going to testify, and we\u2019ll let the process unfold,\u201d she said.\n\nThe whistleblower made an agreement to provide an \u201cunfiltered testimony\u201d before Congress, Schiff confirmed Sunday. The whistleblower\u2019s attorney has said Trump\u2019s attacks are putting his client\u2019s life at risk.\n\nClinton, whose husband, President Bill Clinton, was impeached over a sex scandal in 1998 but survived a vote in the Senate, defended Pelosi\u2019s decision to abandon her resistance to impeachment and open an inquiry last week.\n\n\u201cI think there was no choice,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cBut what I hope the Democrats will do is not only proceed in a very deliberative way on the impeachment inquiry, but tell the American people what they\u2019ve accomplished. They passed legislation on gun safety, improving health, lowering prescription drug costs, doing so many things that the American people really want and need, and it goes to the Senate and dies.\n\n\u201cSo I think the Democrats have to go on two tracks here, but they will do that,\u201d Clinton added.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Hillary Clinton dismissed concerns that Democrats are overreaching in their impeachment inquiry into President Trump, calling the evidence at the center of the probe \u201cdramatic and irrefutable.\u201d", "authors": ["Kadia Tubman"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Ov2aKs2mFS4nyHf7p2timA--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/148a34f0-e471-11e9-bfd5-f4ef0bedc2a7"}
