Challenges remain for sure, but we see UBER at a potential turning point.\"", "description": "Here are the biggest calls on Wall Street on Friday", "authors": ["Michael Bloom"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105960151-1560257859338gettyimages-1149152732.jpeg?v=1572002465", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
