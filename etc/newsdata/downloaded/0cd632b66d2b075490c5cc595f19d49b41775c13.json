The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -1.13% retreated 91 points, or 1.1%, to close at 7,908.68. The small-capitalization Russell 2000 index RUT, -1.97% saw a steeper drop, losing 1.9% to 1,493.43.\n\nThe S&P 500 closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since Sept. 4.\n\nWhat\u2019s driving the market?\n\nWall Street will be closely watching the Automatic Data Processing Inc.\u2019s private-sector employment report for signs of weakness in the U.S. economy after the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s survey on manufacturing registered at 47.8, down from 49.1 in July, below the 50.2 estimated by economists polled by MarketWatch, representing the worst reading since June 2009. Any reading below 50 indicates contraction.\n\nAlso published Tuesday, the JPMorgan IHS global manufacturing index for September remained below 50, the dividing line between expansion and contraction, for a fifth straight month.\n\nEconomists polled by Econoday estimate that private-sector employment for September will come in at 152,000, which would compare with 195,000 for ADP in August. The ADP reading is set for 8:15 a.m. Eastern Time.\n\n\u201cADP data could reverse negative market economic sentiment if the data comes in at a respectable level. This would indicate the private sectors has not yet pulled the plug on hiring helping investor\u2019s to shake off the fears of a slowdown leading to recession,\u201d wrote Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities, in a Wednesday report.\n\nThe ADP payrolls report comes ahead of the more closely followed U.S. Labor Department\u2019s nonfarm-payroll report due on Friday.\n\nSigns of weakness in the U.S. economy may prompt the Federal Reserve to further lower interest rates at its late October meeting, after two quarter percentage point cuts in back-to-back central-bank policy meetings, market participants said.\n\nHow did other markets trade?\n\nThe yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, -0.31% was down nearly 2 basis points to 1.63% on Wednesday.\n\nIn commodities markets, West Texas Intermediate crude-oil for November delivery CLX19, +0.39% was up 7 cents, or less than 0.1%, to $53.68 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.\n\nGold for December delivery GCZ19, +0.36% added 70 cents, or less than 0.1%, to reach $1,489.50 an ounce.\n\nIn Asia, Chinese equity benchmarks were closed in observance of the 70th anniversary of Communist rule. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 NIK, -0.49% meanwhile, fell 0.5%, wiping out a similar loss from Monday. European stocks traded lower, with the Stoxx Europe 600 SXXP, -1.52% down 1.6%.", "description": "U.S. stocks are set to open lower on Wednesday ahead of a reading on private-sector employment that could help affirm the health of the domestic economy,...", "authors": ["Mark Decambre"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-GE184_beigeb_ZG_20180222091715.jpg"}
