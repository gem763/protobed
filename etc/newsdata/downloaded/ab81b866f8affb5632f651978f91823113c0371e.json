A yearly take-home of less than \u00a34,000 is the norm.", "description": "It is the latest landmark for Massey-Ellis after she became first woman to officiate in the Community Shield", "authors": ["Gareth Bicknell", "Image", "Photoeye.Co.Uk", "Getty Images Europe", "Sipa Usa Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article13410600.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Premier-League-Football-Burnley-v-Huddersfield-Town-230917.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
