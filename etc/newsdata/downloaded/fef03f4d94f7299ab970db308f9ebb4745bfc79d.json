He played a key role in organizing \u201chate camp\u201d trainings for the group's members at an abandoned building known as \u201cDevil's Tower\u201d in Skagit, Washington, and in Nevada's Death Valley. Cole also helped craft the group\u2019s eye-catching propaganda.\n\nAtomwaffen Division is an underground neo-Nazi guerrilla organization which had 23 chapters throughout the United States as of mid-2018. Since its inception in 2015, Atomwaffen members have been implicated in five homicides and several bomb plots, and are the subject of an intensifying national investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. It makes common cause with other militant fascist groups like the Base and Sonnenkrieg Division in the United Kingdom, where authorities have charged a number of members with terrorism-related offenses.\n\nAs The Daily Beast reported, the Seattle Police Department obtained an \u201cExtreme Risk Protection Order\u201d against Cole on September 26 to confiscate his concealed carry firearms permit and any firearms he owned for at least a year. That same day, SPD seized five rifles, a shotgun, three semiautomatic handguns and four lower receivers (the firing mechanism of a rifle that can be used to craft untraceable \u2018ghost guns\u2019) from Cole's father's house outside Arlington, in Washington State's Snohomish County.\n\nAccording to court records, none of the guns or the lower receivers seized from Cole were registered in Washington State's licensed firearms database.\n\n\u201cLaw enforcement officials are increasingly concerned about the respondent's access to firearms and his involvement in the Atomwaffen Division, a known terrorist group,\u201d Seattle Police Sergeant Dorothy Kim wrote in a petition for an Extreme Risk Protection Order.\n\nAs further evidence, Sgt. Kim cited Atomwaffen Division propaganda calling for \u201cRace War Now,\u201d and the group's adherence to \u201cacceleration theory,\u201d which urges actions that undermine the existing social order to \u201cexacerbate the feeling of alienation among white supremacists and a greater impulse to engage in violence or destructive behavior.\u201d\n\nCole's \u201cwords, actions and behavior suggest he has taken additional steps towards a plan with his ideologically motivated violence. Specifically, the coordinated camps with firearms training, overseas travel with Atomwaffen paraphernalia-flags/skull masks, threats to kill (gas the Kikes) and the possession of firearms, suggest an imminent risk to public safety if Cole is permitted to continue to purchase or possess firearms,\u201d Sergeant Kim wrote.\n\nThe request to seize Cole's guns was reportedly made to Seattle Police by the FBI, which did not have enough information to file criminal charges but believed Cole posed a serious threat to public safety.\n\nMultiple law enforcement sources told The Daily Beast that Cole had been the target of an FBI investigation following his February 2018 identification by ProPublica. However, law enforcement made no contact with him until December 28, 2018, when Cole landed in Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on a flight from London. Customs and Border Protection pulled Cole aside for secondary screening. Records of that interview were included by the Seattle Police Department in their emergency risk petition last month.\n\nDuring the interview, Cole told CBP agents he had traveled to the Czech Republic, Poland and Ukraine with two friends from Washington State, Aidan Bruce-Umbaugh and Edie Allison Moore. The trip, Cole said, was to \u201csee the historic architecture and museums in Eastern European countries.\u201d The three also attended a heavy metal festival while in Kyiv. The 2018 edition of Asgardsrei, a festival several National Socialist black metal bands have played in the past, was held in Kyiv from December 15-16 last year. Photographs from the concert posted to social media show an Atomwaffen Division flag brandished by individuals in the crowd.", "description": "Police HandoutKaleb James Cole, the 24-year-old leader of Atomwaffen Division's Washington State Cell stripped of his firearms by a \u201cred-flag law\u201d late last month, was deported and banned for life from Canada earlier this year, according to court records, which also showed that he had been previously", "authors": ["Ali Winston"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/UiMJ0viseIi30JTVWTfl9g--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/d61b3a3d09d0d76e87e162411d5bf04a", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
