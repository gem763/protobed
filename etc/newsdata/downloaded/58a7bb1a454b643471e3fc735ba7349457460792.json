It's been the same for a long time,' seven-time Supercars series champion Whincup said.\n\n'We are just pushing the limits, that is what sport is all about.\n\n'The tougher the competition gets, the more you have to run closer to the limit.\n\nHis Ford (pictured) was written off and McLaughlin did not contest the Gold Coast 600's 300km finale, leaving his plans of securing back to back Supercars championships on Sunday in tatters\n\nThe damaged Shell V-Power Racing Team Ford (pictured) is removed from a tow truck after Scott McLaughlin crashed out during qualifying in the Gold Coast\n\n'The competition is causing the errors.
