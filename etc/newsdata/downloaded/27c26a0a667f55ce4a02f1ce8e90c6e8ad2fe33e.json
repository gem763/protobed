Is that Domino\u2019s? I would like a large cheese pizza with an ominous side of surveillance, please.\n\nEarlier this year, Domino\u2019s, the worldwide purveyor of mediocre pizza, introduced a snazzy tool called the Dom Pizza Checker to its Australia and New Zealand locations. According to its website, in-store cameras \u201cuse advanced machine learning, artificial intelligence and sensor technology to identify pizza type, even topping distribution and correct toppings\u201d. If your food doesn\u2019t match your order, or internal quality standards, workers are ordered to make it again. Basically, Big Brother is watching your pizza.\n\nAt first glance, this may sound benign. The tech ensures customers receive consistent quality; what could be wrong with that? The answer, dear reader, is that it is 2019: everything is problematic \u2013 even pizza. Nick Knight, who runs Domino\u2019s in the region, provided more details about the tool at a recent investor day, revealing that it will be incorporated into a \u201c\u2018scorecard\u2019 bonus system\u201d for franchises and used to identify underperforming stores. In short, it is a workplace surveillance tool. Welcome to \u2013 as the tech website iTnews put it \u2013 \u201cthe great pizza panopticon\u201d.\n\nOf course, Domino\u2019s would like you to know that there is nothing remotely creepy about this. \u201cDom Pizza Checker is a tool used to train our team members \u2026 not to punish those who make mistakes,\u201d a Domino\u2019s spokesperson told iTnews. But even if that is true, even if we give Domino\u2019s the benefit of the doubt, the Pizza Checker\u2019s all-seeing eyes and calculating AI should still give us pause for thought. Domino\u2019s, after all, is far from the only company tracking workers: workplace surveillance is becoming increasingly pervasive and worryingly sophisticated.\n\nIn fact, there is a good chance your employer is watching you right now. According to the research firm Gartner, 50% of businesses monitor employees, a figure it expects to rise to 80% by 2020. This monitoring takes a variety of forms. Your employer may be taking remote screenshots of your computer. It may be logging your keystrokes or recording your Google searches. It may be tracking the time you are spending reading this, so it can plug that data into an algorithm to analyse your behaviour and predict whether you are likely to quit. It may even be monitoring your facial expressions or tone of voice and gauging your mood.\n\nMany of us are resigned to \u2013 and perhaps even fine with \u2013 the idea that our employer can scan our emails or keep track of how much time we waste on social media. But we are entering a new world of workplace surveillance in which we are watched 24/7 and every move is scrutinised. And things are only going to get more intrusive as corporations treat us less like human beings and more like machines. Last year, for example, Amazon patented an \u201cultrasonic bracelet\u201d to be worn by workers to \u201cmonitor performance of assigned tasks\u201d. Meanwhile, companies are implanting chips under workers\u2019 skin and China is monitoring employees\u2019 brain waves. It won\u2019t be long until we have all been implanted with chips that keep track of our productivity and trigger a self-combustion protocol when we are no longer deemed useful to our AI overloads. But, hey, while the future may look bleak, at least there is consistently prepared pizza to look forward to.\n\n\u2022Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist", "description": "The company, which uses a smart scanner to analyse whether food has been made correctly, is far from the only business to use tech to track workers, writes Arwa Mahdawi", "authors": ["Arwa Mahdawi"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/edbeb5c6ed19f167eda4c876ea705c21b3cbdafe/1_0_4165_2500/master/4165.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=9d6a511cde1d42125584df422edbdfff", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
