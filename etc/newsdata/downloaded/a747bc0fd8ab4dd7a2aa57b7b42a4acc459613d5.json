Belligerent meddling is now embedded in the west\u2019s world view. But just as there is rarely a good time to intervene in other people\u2019s troubles, so there is rarely a good time to stop. Were there a way in which a US army could swiftly bring peace and concord to northern Syria it might be different. There is none. Nothing in the modern history of the Middle East \u2013 not the Taliban or the Saddam or Assad regimes \u2013 has equalled the horror unleashed by the US\u2019s \u201cwars of 9/11\u201d. They have come to seem as interminable as they are unspeakable.\n\nAs in any intervention, narratives evolve and alliances are formed. Most foolish was the encouragement and aid offered since 2015 to rebels in the Syrian civil war fighting against Bashar al-Assad \u2013 a war which David Cameron was inexplicably eager to have the UK join.
