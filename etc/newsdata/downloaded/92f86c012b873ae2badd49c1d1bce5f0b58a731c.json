Pictured, Theresa May\n\nPsychologist Marcus Cred\u00e9 of the Iowa State University reviewed every single published study into power poses, exploring their methods and analyses.\n\nHe found that nearly all of the studies had been poorly designed and only compared power poses to contractive stances, like slouching, rather than normal poses.\n\nAccording to Professor Cred\u00e9, this oversight has distorted the results, as it is impossible to tell if the power pose is making you feel better or if the contractive pose just makes you feel worse.\n\n'There has literally never been a study that compared a power pose to a normal pose and found any positive effect for a power pose,' Professor Cred\u00e9 said.\n\n'I find this pretty stunning because of the multi-million-dollar industry that has been built up around power posing.'\n\n'It is not dissimilar to a drug being sold to the public without a single study ever having been able to show that the drug works better than placebo or doing nothing.'\n\nThe power pose \u2014 assuming the kind of large stance popularised by Wonder Woman, or Beyonc\u00e9, pictured left \u2014 became popular in 2010.

Pictured, Lynda Carter as Woman Woman, assuming her iconic pose\n\nIn fact, Professor Cred\u00e9 said that only four of the nearly 40 studies into power posing were designed in a way that could properly explore the stance's impact.\n\nOne of these studies, for example, examined how dominant people felt when assuming slouched, neutral and power poses.\n\nYet it found that people's feelings of dominance were highest when assuming a neutral stance \u2014 and that the power pose was instead associated with feeling less powerful in comparison.\n\nThe other three studies, which examined the effect of the three poses on mood, did find that the different poses elicited feelings.\n\nHowever, Professor Cred\u00e9 noted that the results of all these studies were driven by the negative effect of the slouching stance, rather than any positive effect coming from power posing.\n\nA US researcher has analysed the body of existing research on power posing and found that most are poorly designed or found no meaningful effect\n\n'The only conclusion researchers should draw from the existing literature on postural feedback is that contractive poses such as slouching should be avoided, which is hardly novel,' Professor Cred\u00e9 said.\n\n'I recall my elementary school teachers yelling at us about slouching and not what has been sold here.'\n\nThe full findings of the study were published in the journal Meta-Psychology.", "description": "Psychologist Marcus Cred\u00e9 of the Iowa State University reviewed every single published study into power poses, exploring their methods and analyses.", "authors": ["Ian Randall For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/02/14/19206540-0-image-a-16_1570023120213.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-02"}
