It was sort of a diatribe, a nasty diatribe.\u201d\n\nLater, Pelosi said she prays \u201cfor the president all the time, and I tell him that\u2014I pray for his safety and that of his family. Now, we have to pray for his health\u2014because this was a very serious meltdown on the part of the president.\u201d\n\nIn tweeting out a series of photos from the meeting, Trump also accused Pelosi of having a \"meltdown.\"\n\nDo you think they like me? pic.twitter.com/TDmUnJ8HtF \u2014 Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2019\n\nHe then questioned whether something was wrong with Pelosi mentally and asked for prayers for her.\n\n\"Nancy Pelosi needs help fast! There is either something wrong with her \u201cupstairs,\u201d or she just plain doesn\u2019t like our great Country. She had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her, she is a very sick person!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nNancy Pelosi needs help fast!
