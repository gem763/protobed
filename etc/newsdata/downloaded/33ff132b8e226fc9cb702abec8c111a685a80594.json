Now Team GB must ride Olympic mania", "language": "en", "text": "In one of the rooms on the first floor of a building at Keio University\u2019s imposing Hiyoshi campus in Kawasaki, the students have pinned a series of messages on the walls as part of their preparations for greeting the British team when they arrive to use the facilities ahead of next summer\u2019s Tokyo Olympic Games.\n\n\u2018We sold fish \u2019n\u2019 chips at the cafeteria,\u2019 one of them says. \u2018Its aim was to increase awareness within Keio University students towards Team GB coming to Hiyoshi Campus for their pre-Games preparation camp \u2014 600 fish \u2019n\u2019 chips were all sold out.\u2019\n\nAt the campus of one of Japan\u2019s most prestigious universities, there is the same appetite to welcome their British visitors. Signs that say \u2018Go GB 2020, Friends of Great Britain\u2019 have been erected on the perimeter hoardings that border the athletics track. The same slogan has been painted on the stairs above the swimming pool.\n\nThe 2020 Olympics and Paralympic Games will be held in Toyko next summer\n\nAnd on the way to the vast indoor sports hall where Britain\u2019s gymnasts, fencers, boxers and weightlifters will hone their routines in the days before the Games, students have lovingly cultivated a butterfly and flower garden as a way of integrating British culture into the campus.\n\n\u2018Omotenashi\u2019, it says on the fence outside, the word that encapsulates Japan\u2019s proud determination to offer hospitality without expectation of reward.\n\nThe mood is the same at the Yokohama International Swimming Pool, the superb complex where Adam Peaty and the rest of Britain\u2019s swimmers will train before their events, always among the first of the Games.\n\nA large sign dominates the entrance hall. \u2018Team GB,\u2019 it says in big capital letters, \u2018Welcome to Yokohama City.\u2019\n\nAt both venues, officials greeted the British Olympic Association delegation that visited this month with the kind of solicitude that spoke of their pride in hosting the team. That pride was also reflected in some of the literature Keio University produced.\n\nPaintings from local children hang along a fence towards the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo\n\n\u2018As Team GB finished second and Paralympics GB second at the 2016 Rio Games in the overall medal count,\u2019 one pamphlet reminded its readers, \u2018this is a valuable opportunity for Keio students to come into close contact with some of the best athletes in the world.\u2019\n\nBritain will find it hard to get close to its astonishing haul of 67 medals from the Rio Olympics, the first time since the modern Olympic era began in 1896 that a country has increased its medal tally at the summer Games immediately following one it hosted.\n\nBut the atmosphere at the training venues and the quality of the facilities is testimony to the BOA\u2019s meticulous preparations for Tokyo and their determination to provide their athletes with the very best support when they get to Japan.\n\nIt is also a reflection of the special place that the Olympics have in Japanese history and the sense of excitement about their approach that is growing by the day.\n\nThe Rugby World Cup has been well supported here, aided by the emotional outpouring of support for the Brave Blossoms during their intoxicating run to the quarter-finals but, even though the Olympics are still nine months away, the Games already have a far higher profile.\n\nThe first signs you see when you walk through arrivals at Haneda Airport are for Tokyo 2020.\n\nJapan Railways have an extensive advertising campaign based around the Olympics in their stations. The wifi password at a leading hotel chain in the capital is Tokyo2020.\n\nRugby World Cup has been well supported, aided by the Brave Blossoms' run to the quarters\n\nIt is hard to appreciate just how much it means and just how well supported it will be until you get here. London 2012 was a platform for the British to show just how much we loved sport.\n\nAlready, there is a feeling here that Tokyo 2020 will match that mania and then exceed it. Rio was dogged by suggestions that Brazilians were not engaged in the Games. That will not be an issue here.\n\nAt the Japan Olympic Museum in the shadow of the beautiful new Olympic Stadium, built in the centre of the city in the green space around the Meiji Shrine, on the site of the arena that staged the 1964 Games, a fascinating exhibition charts the country\u2019s history with the Olympic movement.\n\nTokyo would have staged the Olympics in 1940 but the Japanese government withdrew their support for the Games because they were preoccupied with the costs of their 1937 invasion of China.\n\nThe Olympics were then awarded to Helsinki before they were cancelled because of the outbreak of the Second World War.\n\nWhen Tokyo became the first Asian city to stage the Games in 1964, it was a symbol of Japan\u2019s rehabilitation after the atrocities it had committed in China, its attack on Pearl Harbour and the horrors that were visited on its own civilians by the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nThe museum has photographs of the Olympic torch being carried through Hiroshima. And there is footage of the flame being lit at the opening ceremony by Yoshinori Sakai, an athlete born on the day of the destruction of Hiroshima.\n\nHosting the Olympics was seen as an opportunity to readmit Japan to the international community as a democratic and peaceful nation and the 1964 Games remains one of the most significant events in the history of modern Japan. Two years after they staged a lavish opening ceremony on October 10, 1964, the Japanese government declared the date a national holiday.\n\nLondon 2012 was a platform for the British to show just how much we loved sport\n\nAt Keio University, one of the officials hosting the BOA delegation mentioned that she had always had a day off on her birthday because she was born on October 10.\n\nThe holiday is still in place, although it has now been adjusted so that it happens on the closest Monday to the anniversary of the 1964 opening ceremony, allowing Japanese workers a long weekend.\n\nIt is easy to sense already that this will be an exuberant, celebratory Games, embraced by their host nation.\n\nThere will be controversies in the run-up because there always are but, unlike the Games in Rio, it is hard to see it being anything other than a unifying factor.\n\nAcross the road from the museum, they are working on the Olympic Stadium, due for completion early next year. At Keio University, they are preparing for another run on fish \u2019n\u2019 chips.\n\nDOES FOOTBALL VALUE PEOPLE OR MONEY?\n\nLast year, the NFL agreed to pay more than \u00a3780million to former American football players \u2014 and their families \u2014 who had been diagnosed with chronic brain trauma.\n\nAfter experts at Glasgow University concluded last week that former professional footballers are three and a half times more likely to die of dementia than people of the same age range in the general population, demands for compensation and financial provision to be paid to relatives and sufferers will surely have to be met here.\n\nCall me cynical but that may have been one of the reasons why the football authorities were so slow to act in England when it came to commissioning research over dementia.\n\nIt may also be one of the reasons why World Rugby finally appears to be taking the issue more seriously by punishing dangerous tackles more.\n\nIn football, where concussion protocols still seem to be observed inconsistently, most of the criticism has been aimed at the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association.\n\nSurely the FA and the clubs also had, and have, a duty of care to those who played?\n\nOur game ought to put a little bit more of its money into looking after the people who helped to make it the cash-cow it has become. The PFA have \u00a350m in cash reserves, apparently. It might be time to use it.\n\nWorld Rugby finally appears to be taking the issue of concussions more seriously\n\nNIKE BOOTS ITS MORALS\n\nYou know you\u2019re in trouble when you are upbraided by a member of the Trump administration for moral failings but that is what happened to Nike last week in a row over its subservience to China.\n\nHouston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey caused a furore recently by tweeting support for pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong and Nike promptly removed Rockets merchandise from its Chinese stores. US vice-president Mike Pence accused Nike of \u2018checking its social conscience at the door\u2019.\n\nSomewhere, presumably, Paula Radcliffe will be waiting to give an interview to the BBC rebutting the latest slur on the good name of her paymasters.", "description": "OLIVER HOLT - CHIEF SPORTS WRITER: There is a feeling here in Japan that Tokyo 2020 will match 2012's mania and then exceed it.
