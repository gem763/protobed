We lost.\u201d\n\nSeveral dozen campers still at the site could stay until Sunday, he added.\n\nAs the event turned into something of a damp squib, a US military unit apologised for a tweet that used the spectre of a stealth bomber being deployed against any young people who tried to break into the remote desert base in Nevada.\n\nThe tweet, posted on Friday on the Twitter account of the Defense Visual Information Distribution Service (DVIDS), took aim at UFO fans and curiosity seekers who poured into the Nevada desert this week, after an online campaign to \u201cstorm\u201d the US military base long rumoured to house government secrets about extraterrestrial life and spaceships.\n\nAlongside a photo of military men and women standing at attention in uniform in front of a B-2 stealth bomber, it read, \u201cThe last thing #Millennials will see if they attempt the #area51raid today.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, DVIDS said on Twitter that an employee of its DVIDSHub account posted a tweet that \u201cin NO WAY supports the stance of the Department of Defense. It was inappropriate and we apologize for this mistake.\u201d\n\nIn Rachel, Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn owner Connie West said she was sad to hear the Hiko festival didn\u2019t succeed. In a voice hoarse from stress and lack of sleep, she said a noon-to-midnight slate of \u201cAlienstock\u201d event musical entertainment would continue for the several thousand revellers camping on her property and nearby federal land.\n\n\u201cThis is the most fabulous time,\u201d West said. \u201cI\u2019m just so grateful that people came. This is their event as much as it is mine.\u201d\n\nLincoln county sheriff Kerry Lee said it was \u201cpretty calm\u201d early on Saturday in Rachel and Hiko. In Nye county, Sheriff Sharon Wehrly said no one showed up at a main entrance and an auxiliary gate at the once-secret Area 51 US air force facility.\n\nWehrly revised to 100 each the number of people who appeared at each of those gates early on Friday near Amargosa Valley, a 90-minute drive west of Las Vegas.\n\nLee, about a two-hour drive north of Las Vegas, said revelers gathered until about 4am at two gates between Hiko and Rachel, and said about 20 people broke from among revelers and \u201cacted like they were going to storm but stopped short\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Law enforcement monitor a gate to Area 51. Photograph: Jim Urquhart/Reuters\n\nLee and Wright reported one arrest, for disorderly conduct, at the \u201cArea 51 Basecamp\u201d event.\n\nEarlier, officials reported five arrests, including one man treated for dehydration by festival medics in Rachel.\n\nLee said a man reported missing on Friday morning after heading Thursday from a festival campground in Hiko toward an Area 51 gate was found safe in the evening.\n\nThe mood among the assembled remained mostly harmless. While costumed space aliens were a common and sometimes hilarious sight in events that began on Thursday, no one had reported seeing actual extraterrestrials or UFOs.", "description": "Crowds for internet-fuelled event in low thousands, officials say, as man reported missing is found and a few tresspassers are arrested", "authors": ["Associated Press In Hiko"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f09b9841baf91ecd9447dd2eeda3ca0f2f98c4ba/0_325_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d276d3f35543f7f5495a2fe449dad8f0", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
