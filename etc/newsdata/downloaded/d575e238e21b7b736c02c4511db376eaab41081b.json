That's roughly 120,000 jobs.\n\n\"Quebec is dealing with a serious labour shortage, and needs immigration to help meet the challenge,\" said Singh.\n\n\"It's a critical issue.\"\n\nThe NDP's platform also commits to bolstering immigration settlement in rural areas of Quebec. Many immigrants arrive in Quebec with no French language skills, which affects their ability to work in the province. Singh said that a funding increase from an NDP government would help to target those language barriers.\n\nQuebec will already receive $25.5 billion from Ottawa this fiscal year in the form equalization payments and health and social transfers. In the 2017-2018 fiscal year, $490 million was allocated for immigration supports.\n\nBut the provincial government isn't completely sold on the idea of increasing immigration.\n\nLeaning on temporary foreign workers\n\nThe CAQ government intends to accept around 20 per cent fewer immigrants this year, or 40,000 instead of the nearly 52,000 accepted last year.\n\nHowever, Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault said temporary foreign workers can counter the shortage.\n\nHis government recently launched a $21-million plan to make it simpler for smaller businesses to recruit foreigners. It includes subsidizing recruitment missions by Quebec companies overseas and offering to cover $1,000 in moving expenses for the workers.\n\nThe province also announced $34 million for measures aimed at better integrating immigrants into the workforce.", "description": "NDP Leader Jagmeet\u00a0Singh says his government would give a boost to Quebec's immigration funding to help prepare immigrants to fill the province's labour shortage.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5272320.1567716065!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/ndp-jagmeet-tor-20190902.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
