The question farmers and investors are asking focuses on crop yield.\n\nProduction is expected to be down from last year. The USDA says corn production will fall 4% and soybean production will fall 19% compared to 2018. That might usually help prices increase but uncertainty about the harvest, which may be better than predicted, is keeping prices down.\n\nThe Teucrium Corn Fund (CORN) closed down 1.6% Tuesday, while the Teucrium Soybean (SOYB) was essentially flat. Soybean farmers who are hit hard by the U.S.\u2019s trade war with China have been able to use government relief payments to stay in business, according to the Fed. But Kauffman said the value of farmland is also helping sustain farmers.\n\n\u201cFarmland values or the value of farm real estate has been holding up pretty well. So, there have been some silver linings, but I still would characterize it as a relatively downbeat environment with risks still high,\u201d he said.\n\nDemand for loans\n\nThe Kansas City Fed survey found that demand for agricultural loans remained high but bankers expect it to fall in the coming months. Seventy-five percent of those bankers also reported they denied at least 1% of all applicants the money they wanted to borrow.\n\nWhile that is an improvement over previous years, Kauffman said lending conditions are tight. \u201cI think that there still is a lot of concern about what cash flow might look like within the agricultural sector and so you\u2019re seeing some lenders still taking a very conservative approach to lending.\u201d\n\nAdam Shapiro is co-anchor of Yahoo Finance On the Move.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance", "description": "Farmers just began harvesting their crops but a wet spring and the U.S.-China trade war are creating uncertainty that is depressing crop prices.", "authors": ["Adam Shapiro"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/kil5JdVX029fzNGsg6zlAA--~B/aD0yNjU2O3c9NDMxNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/e6cc5e80-ce8b-11e9-b73e-d7797c5406a4", "published_at": "2019-09-03"}
