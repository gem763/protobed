The timing could not be worse for Charles Li and HKEX.\n\nRiots on the streets of Hong Kong have, if anything, become more intense during more than four months of unrest, closing underground stations and easy access to the towers which are the home to the region's rip-roaring capitalism.\n\nThose bastions of free markets, HSBC, Standard Chartered, Jardines and Swire (owner of Cathay), have been required to offer their obeisance to a system of government which is rocking.\n\nRiot police officers fire rubber bullets toward anti-government protesters in Kowloon, Hong Kong, yesterday. The riots have become more intense during more than four months of unrest\n\nThe best thing that can be said is that in spite of all the provocation, and examples of shootings with live bullets, the tanks of Tiananmen have not rolled in.\n\nEven if HKEX amends the terms of its \u00a332billion bid by upping the price and improving the mix of cash and paper, one can hardly imagine investors biting their hand off at present.\n\nThe fact that more than half of the HKEX board is made up of Hong Kong government appointees raises a potentially insurmountable governance barrier.\n\nIt is hard to see the London, Brussels and New York authorities willingly allowing the London Clearing House, home to trillions of pounds of derivatives contracts, to fall under the ultimate control of unsafe hands.\n\nYet a deal between the two exchanges could be a winner. It would offer the LSE, which has fallen behind other major exchanges in initial public offerings and trading, a huge window on Asia.\n\nThat is why this would be an ideal opportunity for the LSE to adopt the once popular 'Pac-Man defence', whereby the company that is being bid for turns the tables on the predator.\n\nThis looks unlikely to happen in the LSE bid because the new, and still little known, American chief executive David Schwimmer has his eyes on a different prize in the shape of its \u00a322billion bid for Refinitiv.\n\nThe deal was cooked up by investment bankers Goldman Sachs for a Goldman alumnus.\n\nSchwimmer's strategy is to build up the LSE as a repository of financial data. The former Thomson-Reuters screen has lost out in recent times to rival Bloomberg.\n\nBut no major financial group would be without one. The big issue for the LSE is the perception that it might be paying too much to controlling investor Blackstone, which Bloomberg calculates could more than double the value of its investment in Refinitiv in under 12 months.\n\nAs much as it pains one to see Steven Schwarzman's Blackstone private equity kingdom become any richer, Refinitiv must be a better option than the LSE falling into the hands of Hong Kong's wobbling regime.\n\nMighty Quinn\n\nFew UK quoted firms better illustrate the value of a Pacific focus than HSBC.\n\nHong Kong may be in turmoil but it is still the wellspring of double-digit returns. What pulls HSBC back is feeble results in Europe, where it made a \u00a3362million loss last year.\n\nThe United States is no better. After the fiasco of sub-prime lender Household in the 1990s, and Mexican money laundering, it struggles to make decent returns in a market where it has more than \u00a3100billion of capital tied up.\n\nIt was failure to come to grips with some of this that led chairman Mark Tucker to consign chief executive John Flint to the dustbin of history.\n\nCaretaker successor Noel Quinn looks determined not to make the same mistake.\n\nHe is to hack away at 10,000 jobs, in addition to 4,000 already on the line. This is not a vast number, given HSBC's workforce of about 238,000, but could make a significant dent to bloated costs. As digitalisation of banking spreads, the redundancies could be the start of something bigger.\n\nThe timing is just as well. The riots in Hong Kong are unlikely to dislodge HSBC's grip in the region, but could chip away at super-charged growth.\n\nPlastic extinction\n\nOne of the real legacies of the Paul Polman era at Unilever was an early embrace of climate change and a social agenda.\n\nFrom his office on Blackfriars Bridge in central London, successor Alan Jope has an excellent view of the havoc being wreaked by Extinction Rebellion.\n\nHis response is a bold, green agenda under which the Marmite-to-Dove consumer group plans to halve its use of plastic packaging by 2025.
