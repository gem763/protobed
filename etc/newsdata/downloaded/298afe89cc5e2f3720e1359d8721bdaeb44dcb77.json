Fox announced today that Jenna Dewan will host a new dating show for the network called Flirty Dancing that is about exactly those two things: flirting and dancing. In the original U.K. series, pairs of people come together for a blind date, but the twist is, ahead of time they each got a piece of choreography to learn. Upon first meeting they have to execute the dance they learned separately together, and \u201cwithout saying a word.\u201d Here in the U.S. it will be a little different, with solo dancers performing a different choreographed number with two potential suitors, and choosing the person (for love, presumably) they had the best dance connection with. Honestly, it\u2019s as good a metric for measuring romantic chemistry as being stuck on an island with a bunch of people, so why not?", "description": "Jenna Dewan will host a new dating show for Fox called Flirty Dancing, where a blind date will revolve around executing pairs choreography upon first meeting.", "authors": ["Jordan Crucchiola"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/09/09-jenna-dewan.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
