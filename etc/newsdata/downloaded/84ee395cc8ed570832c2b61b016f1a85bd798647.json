The show sounds like a fresh take on the very old trope of the sitcom wife, per the log line: \u201cAlternating between single-camera realism and multi-camera comedy, the formats will inform one another as we imagine what happens when the sitcom wife escapes her confines and forces the world to let her take the lead.\u201d The title of the series is a troll on Kevin Can Wait, the now-canceled Kevin James CBS sitcom that ran from 2016-2018 and carelessly killed off the wife of James\u2019s character, played by Erinn Hayes, because they were \u201cliterally just running out of ideas.\u201d\n\nHayes, of course, loved this new development when it was first announced:\n\nThe news of the series order led to a swift reaction from those who saw how quickly Hayes got thrown in the trash by Kevin James: Surely a show about a sitcom wife inspired by Kevin Can Wait might possibly star \u2026 the former sitcom wife on Kevin Can Wait, right?\n\nAMC has greenlit a comedy about a neglected/ill-used sitcom wife called \"Kevin Can F**k Himself.\"\n\n\n\nWill they at least let Erinn Hayes star? \u2014 Daniel Fienberg (@TheFienPrint) October 1, 2019\n\nnow that this is officially happening, are you going to cast Erinn Hayes please pic.twitter.com/xYBmeFf7fl \u2014 Samantha Rollins (@SamanthaRollins) October 1, 2019\n\nUnfortunately, it sounds like the role Hayes was destined to play isn\u2019t happening \u2014 at least, not yet. A rep for Hayes confirmed to Vulture that the actor currently has no involvement in the project, which is odd considering she\u2019s the first name to come to anyone\u2019s mind when reading that show title. Hayes has other projects lined up, including a Netflix comedy with Rob Huebel that sounds like catnip for Childrens Hospital fans, but really, is it too much to politely request for Hayes to be cast in this, or at the very least considered? We don\u2019t think so.", "description": "This week, AMC ordered a comedy series clearly inspired by \u2018Kevin Can Wait\u2019 titled \u2018Kevin Can F*** Himself.\u2019 \u2018Kevin Can Wait\u2019 alum Erinn Hayes deserves to star, but she is currently not involved in the project.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/02/02-erinn-hayes.w1200.h630.jpg"}
