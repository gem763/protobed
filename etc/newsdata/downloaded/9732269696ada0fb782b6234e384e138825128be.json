This teacher has no business being anywhere near a classroom.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cAn employer can\u2019t legally ask these questions of prospective employees, so why would it ever be okay for a high school English teacher to ask minors in her class,\u201d Mrs. Bartus wondered.\n\nShe has faced all sorts of threats and backlash, but she did the right thing by speaking out. She exposed a very clear and present danger in our nation\u2019s public school system.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TODD STARNES", "description": "A teacher in North Carolina asked students for personal information in order to judge their \"privilege.\"", "authors": ["Todd Starnes", "Todd Starnes Is Host Of"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/e42d25db-generic-classroom-shot.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
