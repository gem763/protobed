I actually want you to write this: I respect Glen Johnson's career that he's already produced,' he told The Times in an interview.\n\n'That's his opinion. If that's how he felt, it's funny that he's coming out now on radio when the disappointing thing for me is I had so much respect for him.\n\n'I sat next to him in the changing room. There was never one time he called me aside and said about my behaviour or anything.\n\n'He's a well respected player, he's a senior player. He's got so many accolades, so I was a bit disappointed that he had to go to the radio to say that.\n\n'He could have said something when I was going through a tough period at Stoke, but if that's how he feels then I can only respect his opinion and I wish him all the best for what he is doing in his career now.'\n\nBerahino is now plying his trade at Belgian club Zulte Waregem after leaving Stoke in August\n\nDuring his interview with talkSPORT, Johnson revealed what Berahino - who was released from his contract in August by Stoke - was like to play with on a day-to-day basis.\n\n'To be honest it's not so much what's gone wrong, it's quicker to say what's gone right. He had the wrong mentality and the wrong attitude from day one,' he said.\n\n'I only know him from the days at Stoke; his days at West Brom, he had a few good months he was hitting the net regularly.\n\n'For whatever reason when he was at Stoke he was always going against the grain. If we were told to be there [at training] at 10, he would turn up at 10 past 10.\n\n'If we were told to wear this, he would deliberately wear something different. It was almost like he had a vendetta against them from the start.\n\n'It was strange to watch really. In training you would see glimpses that he can play. There is something there but he didn't even want to push himself.\n\n'If they wanted us to run faster he would go slower. I am not exaggerating, it would be the same every single day.\n\n'He had the wrong mentality and the wrong attitude from day one,' Johnson said of Berahino\n\n\u201cHe had the wrong mentality, the wrong attitude from day one.\u201d \ud83d\ude21\n\n\n\n\u201cHe was always going against the grain. It was like he had a vendetta.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was every day. I didn\u2019t like him.\u201d \ud83d\udd25\n\n\n\nMust listen from @Glen_Johnson on Saido Berahino\u2019s attitude at Stoke. pic.twitter.com/QnH6mFaelu \u2014 talkSPORT (@talkSPORT) August 8, 2019\n\n'If you were not in the squad, you would have to run after the game. Of course, no player likes doing it because they are angry you weren't playing in the first place.\n\n'You might be running at half 10 at night on an evening or whatever. I understood why players were unhappy about it but that was the rules, but Saido would jog.\n\n'We would supposed to be off on the following Sunday but because Saido didn't run everyone had to come in the next day, even the players that played the game.\n\n'The next day, Saido called in sick. We were only there because of him and he didn't even turn up.\n\n'It was uproar. Where do you go from that? It's total disrespect to the staff, the players.\n\n'And that's what he was like on a daily basis. And considering they paid him with three years left to go tells you everything you know.'\n\nBerahino has made a bright start to life in Belgium - scoring three goals in seven games so far\n\nAsked if he liked Berahino as a person, Johnson said: 'No. I will be brutally honest. I've played with people who might not be up to the level but they are nice and will work hard.\n\n'He wasn't at the level and he didn't try. It's not happened once, has it, it's happened throughout the career.\n\n'He's 26, he should be having a big move right now. He's not played for England. There are reasons for it.\n\n'Everyone pretty much says the same thing. If I was the manager or owner of a club I wouldn't take him if they paid me to play him.'\n\nBerahino scored five goals in 56 appearances for the Potters in two years, having been signed for \u00a312million, and last played for the club in February before leaving. The striker has three goals in his first seven games for Waregem.\n\nHe was convicted of drink-driving in May and was fined \u00a375,000 and banned from driving for 30 months at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court.", "description": "Saido Berahino has expressed his disappointment at Glen Johnson's comments and questioned why he never confronted him during their time together at Stoke.", "authors": ["Luke Augustus For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/30/10/19100724-0-image-a-2_1569836028089.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
