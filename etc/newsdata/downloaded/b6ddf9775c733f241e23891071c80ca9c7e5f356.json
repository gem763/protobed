REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo\n\nTalks aimed at dismantling North Korea\u2019s nuclear and missile programmes have been stalled in a holding pattern since the second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Vietnam ended without a deal.\n\nThe two leaders had agreed to restart working-level talks at a surprise meeting at the heavily-guarded border between the two Koreas in June, but the outcome remained uncertain as North Korea repeatedly launched short-range ballistic missiles and often criticised the United States for continuing joint military drills with South Korea.\n\nThe two countries agreed to have preliminary contact on Oct. 4, followed by the working level talks, KCNA said, citing a statement issued under the name of Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui. It did not mention where the talks would be held, or give any more details.\n\n\u201cThe delegates of the DPRK side are ready to enter into the DPRK-U.S. working-level negotiations,\u201d Choe said in the statement, using North Korea\u2019s official name, the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK).\n\n\u201cIt is my expectation that the working-level negotiations would accelerate the positive development of the DPRK-U.S. relations.\u201d\n\nAlthough North Korea has lately expressed willingness for working-level talks, messages carried by its state media attached a caveat that Washington should show more flexibility. North Korea\u2019s chief nuclear negotiator Kim Myong Gil said in a statement last month that the United States should present the \u201cright calculation method at the upcoming talks\u201d.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in September that Washington was ready to meet North Korean counterparts and believed it was important to do so, although ousted former U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton warned on Monday that North Korea had no intention of giving up its nuclear weapons.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the agreement between North Korea and the United States to proceed with working-level negotiations on Oct. 5.\u201d South Korea\u2019s presidential Blue House said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThrough this working-level negotiation, we hope that substantial progress will be made at an early date to achieve complete denuclearization and permanent peace on the Korean Peninsula.\u201d", "description": "North Korea and the United States have agreed to hold working-level talks on Oct. 5, North Korea's state news agency KCNA said on Tuesday, a development that would break months of stalemate since a failed summit in February.", "authors": ["Joyce Lee", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191001&t=2&i=1435830204&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF902F7", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
