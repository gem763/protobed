Beijing announced it would exempt some U.S. agricultural\n\nproducts from additional tariffs after President Donald Trump\n\nsuggested he could be open to an interim deal, the latest\n\nconciliatory gestures by both sides of the trade war ahead of\n\nnext month's negotiations in Washington. ]\n\n\"Apple is holding back the averages,\" said Peter Cardillo,\n\nchief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New\n\nYork. \"Another factor is we have a huge rally in (Treasury)\n\nyields, the 10-year is up substantially. Those two factors are\n\nholding back the market and dampening the enthusiasm that some\n\nkind of cosmetic trade deal is on its way.\"\n\nHowever, rising Treasury yields did boost interest-rate\n\nsensitive financials , which gained 0.8%.\n\nOn the economic front, U.S. retail sales increased in August\n\nat twice the rate analysts expected, according to the Commerce\n\nDepartment, suggesting that strong consumer spending will\n\ncontinue to support the longest-ever U.S. economic expansion.\n\n\"The consumer is pretty cheerful,\" Cardillo added. \"Going\n\ninto the holiday season the consumer is likely to continue to\n\nspend, and that bodes well as far as the consumer-led economy is\n\nconcerned.\"\n\nEbbing trade jitters and upbeat retail sales data helped\n\nU.S. Treasury yields reach multi-week highs, providing an\n\nattractive alternative to risk-averse investors. Market participants now look to the U.S. Federal Reserve,\n\nwhich is widely expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis\n\npoints at the conclusion of its monetary policy meeting next\n\nweek.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 37.07 points,\n\nor 0.14%, to 27,219.52, the S&P 500 lost 2.18 points, or\n\n0.07%, to 3,007.39 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped\n\n17.75 points, or 0.22%, to 8,176.71.\n\nOf the 11 major sectors in the S&P 500, five closed in the\n\nred, with real estate .SPLRCR suffering the largest percentage\n\nloss, 1.3%.\n\nMaterials was the biggest percentage winner,\n\ngaining 1.1%.\n\nChipmaker Broadcom Inc slipped 3.4% after the\n\ncompany missed quarterly revenue estimates late Thursday and\n\nsaid that while semiconductor demand has likely hit bottom, the\n\ntiming of a recovery remains uncertain. Progressive Corp PGR.N fell 5.6% after the insurer\n\nreported a 36% year-on-year drop in August net income.\n\nLumber Liquidators Holdings Inc LL.N plunged 13.2% after\n\nfounder Thomas Sullivan told Bloomberg he was holding off on\n\nplans to take the company private. Tyson Foods Inc TSN.N , the largest U.S. meat processor,\n\nadvanced 2.0% on China's tariff exemption announcement.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a\n\n1.11-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.21-to-1 ratio favored advancers.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 20 new 52-week highs and one new low; the\n\nNasdaq Composite recorded 82 new highs and 20 new lows.\n\nVolume on U.S. exchanges was 6.93 billion shares, compared\n\nwith the 6.75 billion-share average over the last 20 trading\n\ndays.", "description": "US STOCKS-S&P edges lower as Apple weighs, trade tensions ease", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEA6304Y_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
