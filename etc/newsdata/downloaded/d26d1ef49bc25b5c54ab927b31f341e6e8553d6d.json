Peter Lowy hosted a fundraising lunch on Friday at his Beverly Hills home for the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton. Guests paid $US2700 ($3500) to mingle with the former First Lady, US Senator and Secretary of State.\n\nWhich means at least that P. Lowy can't be on the family's 74-metre megayacht, Ilona, which spent all of last week off the coast of Spain, stopping at Majorca and Ibiza.\n\nIlona even has a helicopter landing pad and hangar for its own Agusta 139 chopper (price tag: $12 million) and was built in 2004 by Dutch shipbuilder Amels. Word is that family patriarch Frank Lowy didn't want to wait three years to build it, so paid double to keep construction going virtually around the clock.\n\nPeter Lowy hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton at his Beverly Hills home on Friday. Michel O'Sullivan\n\nIt underwent its third refit last year at STP in Palma, so it hasn't gone far.\n\nIf Peter's stuck in Hollywood with Hillary, perhaps it's Frank soaking up the delights of the Balearic Islands. Can you see the old fella there in his sluggos, jiving madly at some Nikki Beach day club? Let's hope he stays off the pingers \u2013 we'd hate him take another tumble.\n\nMeanwhile in superyacht land, James Packer's 88-metre icebreaker Arctic P has been in Cartagena (in Spain, not Colombia) at Navantia Shipyard getting a brand new bridge and engine control room plus a new teak \"beach club\" with Jacuzzi and swimming pool. Cue Mariah Carey track I'll Be There.
