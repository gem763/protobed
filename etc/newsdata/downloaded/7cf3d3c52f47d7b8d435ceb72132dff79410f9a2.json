The requirement will also block immigrants who cannot prove they can afford pricey U.S. health insurance policies that are increasingly out of reach of Americans.\n\nThe change is scheduled to take effect in 30 days. Visa applicants will have to prove they \u201cwill be covered by approved health insurance\u201d or can demonstrate that they have \u201cthe financial resources to pay for reasonably foreseeable medical costs,\u201d according to the proclamation.\n\nThe requirement would not apply to refugees or immigrants who gain asylum status. Nor would it apply to noncitizen children of U.S. citizens or people, such as college students, on limited visas.\n\nSubsidized plans purchased under Obamacare would not qualify as acceptable health insurance under the new rule, according to The Wall Street Journal, which was the first to report on the new rule.\n\nThe amount of money that uninsured immigrants would need to cover health care costs was not specified in the proclamation.\n\nThe White House statement lays out the high public cost of treating people without insurance, though it does not distinguish between immigrants and the nearly 30 million Americans who have no health insurance or have inadequate coverage.\n\nHealth care costs that are not paid or reimbursed by insurance are \u201cpassed on to the American people in the form of higher taxes, higher premiums and higher fees for medical services,\u201d according to the White House statement. Such costs have \u201cexceeded $35 billion in each of the last 10 years,\u201d amounting to approximately $7 million on average for each hospital in the U.S., the proclamation states.\n\nThere were an estimated 27.5 million Americans last year without health insurance, or about 8.5% of the population. That\u2019s up from 7.9% (25.6 million people) in 2017, according to census data. That was the first hike in the number of uninsured Americans in more than a decade, the Journal found.\n\nA recent study found that the annual cost of a decent American health insurance plan rose to a record of more than $20,000 last year, the equivalent of buying an economy each year, Bloomberg reported.\n\nAdmitting \u201cthousands of aliens who have not demonstrated any ability to pay for their healthcare costs, exacerbates the problem,\u201d the proclamation says. Data, according to the statement, \u201cshow that lawful immigrants are about three times more likely than United States citizens to lack health insurance.\u201d\n\n\u201cEntry into the United States as immigrants ... who will financially burden the United States healthcare system is hereby suspended,\u201d the proclamation declares.\n\nThe requirement could apply to hundreds of thousands of people who move to the U.S. each year on immigrant visas, which allow people to eventually become permanent residents. Last year, the U.S. issued about 534,000 visas, a 4.6% decline from the previous year\u2019s total, according to the Journal.", "description": "Subsidized Obamacare plans won't count, according to a White House proclamation.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d97f8bc200000f2004ca90f.jpeg?cache=bsfy6aurnv&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
