Whatever cause they are fighting for, it never justifies such violence.\u201d\n\nFor months, the Chinese-ruled city has been facing massive and sometimes violent pro-democracy protests. Protesters have demanded universal suffrage and an independent probe into alleged police brutality.\n\nThe demonstrations began with a now-shelved bill that would have permitted extradition to China, but have evolved into a larger pro-democracy movement.\n\nThe Hong Kong government also released a statement Monday in which protesters' actions were described as \"violent and vandalistic acts which completely disregard law and order.\"\n\n\"Police reiterate that no violent behaviour will be tolerated. Police will continue to take resolute enforcement action so as to safeguard the city\u2019s public safety and bring all lawbreakers to justice,\" the statement said.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping on Sunday issued a stern warning against attempts to divide the country.\n\n\u201cAnyone attempting to split China in any part of the country will end in crushed bodies and shattered bones,\u201d Xi said at a meeting in Nepal, Reuters reported, citing China's state broadcaster CCTV.", "description": "Police in Hong Kong\u00a0on Monday said that protests in the city have reached a \"life-threatening level\" after a bomb exploded and a police officer was stabbed.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/hongkongprotesters_090629019_1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
