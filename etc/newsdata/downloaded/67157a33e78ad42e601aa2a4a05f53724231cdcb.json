McCombs, 55, of Columbia.\n\n\"Roy A. McCombs tragically lost his life today on a picket line standing up for a better life for himself and his coworkers,\" UAW President Gary Jones and Vice President Terry Dittes said in a joint statement. \"On behalf of the UAW, we offer condolences to Brother McCombs and family, friends and co-workers. Today\u2019s accident is heartbreaking for UAW Spring Hill members. We will continue to work to ensure that safety is a priority on the picket line.\"\n\nThe wreck occurred at 6:15 a.m. at a bridge that leads to the plant's south entrance in the boundary of Columbia. The plant's north gate lies within Spring Hill.\n\n\"It was an accident involving a pedestrian and car. The individual pedestrian sadly succumbed to injuries and passed away,\" Columbia Police Department Lt. Jeremy Haywood said.\n\nGeneral Motors workers Greg Hill and John Layden strike near the GM plant in Spring Hill on Wednesday, Oct. 2, 2019.

He also said a crisis team has been called in to aid those affected.\n\n\"No UAW member will be deployed to this location \u2013 today or at any point in the future,\" Herron said.\n\nHerron extended his condolences to the family.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family of Brother Roy McCombs,\" he said.\n\nThe bridge connecting drivers to the south entrance of GM was empty Oct. 22, 2019, after a picket died after a driver struck and killed him.

I am used to traffic growing up in New York City. But as you see, we are still out here. We just keep on going, even though it's a tragedy no matter how you look at it.\"\n\nStrikers near the GM mansion between the entrances have taken a few steps back farther from Highway 31. Some even wore bright safety vests while waving their signs.\n\n\"It's tragic \u2014 ain't no right or wrong to it,\" GM worker Keith Bell said outside the mansion property. \"You can only stand back and be mindful. It's a tragic accident and you have his family dealing with it and the driver's. It's a day of prayer.\"\n\nThe strike, which has been ongoing for 37 days, will continue until the contract between GM and UAW is ratified. Votes on a tentative contract agreement are expected to be in at 4 p.m. Friday, according to Brian Rothenberg, UAW head of communications.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/10/22/gm-uaw-strike-picket-struck-killed-spring-hill-plant/2451544001/", "description": "A United Auto Workers picket was struck and killed Tuesday by a driver outside the General Motors plant in Spring Hill amid an ongoing strike.", "authors": ["Kerri Bartlett", "Emily R.
