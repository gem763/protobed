McCarthy: Pelosi is failing to meet basic standards of due process", "language": "en", "text": "Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s explosive exit from a White House meeting last week \u201cunbecoming of a speaker,\u201d adding that \u201ca leader stays in the room and solves the problem.\u201d\n\nSpeaking on \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d with Maria Bartiromo, McCarthy, R-Calif., who was at Thursday\u2019s meeting that ended abruptly with a walkout at the White House, said, \u201cI\u2019ve been in many of these meetings. This is a pattern of the speaker. When she doesn\u2019t want to come to a solution she really is unbecoming of a speaker, throws a fit and leaves a room.\u201d\n\nThe administration called in congressional leadership for the meeting, which was held against the backdrop of the fast-moving impeachment inquiry. They were set to discuss the situation in Syria after the House had just voted, 354-60, to overwhelmingly oppose the president\u2019s announced U.S. troop withdrawal, a rare bipartisan rebuke.\n\nThe move has opened the door for a Turkish military attack on Syrian Kurds who have been aligned with the U.S. in fighting the country\u2019s long-running war.\n\nPELOSI ANNOUNCES HOUSE WON'T VOTE NOW ON WHETHER TO BEGIN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY\n\nA Democrat familiar with the meeting, who spoke anonymously to The Associated Press, said Trump started off by bragging about his \u201cnasty\u201d letter to Turkish President Recep Erdo\u011fan. In the letter, Trump warned Erdo\u011fan not to be \u201cslaughtering\u201d the Kurds.\n\nPelosi then reportedly mentioned the House vote and Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate leader, started to read the president a quote from former Defense Secretary James Mattis explaining that U.S. troops need to stay in Syria to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State fighters.\n\nThe conversation between Schumer, Pelosi and Trump then escalated, with the president calling the House speaker \u201ca third-rate politician,\u201d according to Schumer.\n\nThe genteel Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the House Majority Leader, then interjected, \u201cThis is not useful.\u201d Hoyer and Pelosi left the meeting and from the White House driveway, Pelosi told reporters Trump was having some kind of \u201cmeltdown.\u201d She told reporters they had to leave because Trump was unable to grasp the reality of the situation.\n\nShe later insisted Trump botched the insult, calling her \u201cthird-grade\u201d rather than \u201cthird-rate.\u201d\n\nLater, on Twitter, Trump said Pelosi was the one who had a \u201ctotal meltdown\u201d and called her \u201ca very sick person!\u201d He also tweeted a picture from the room and wrote, \u201cNervous Nancy\u2019s unhinged meltdown!\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, McCarthy explained his account of what happened at the meeting to Bartiromo.\n\n\u201cThe president starts the conversation and this is a bipartisan, bicameral meeting, and he\u2019s handing a letter out that is a letter that he sent to the president of Turkey, Erdo\u011fan, about not entering that area, about protecting the Kurds,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\n\u201cAs each elected official gathers that letter, they start to read it, they pause, it\u2019s something they have not seen before, The speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, turns it over and, sitting directly across from the president, sets it right down on the table to make a point to him that she\u2019s not going to listen to him.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say, \u201cAnd what\u2019s really creeping in to all this is impeachment. She couldn\u2019t put that aside for one moment to talk about the security of an issue that [we] should be one person with, that we are all speaking together with, one voice. But it was impeachment.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy added, \u201cAnd if you watched her and Senator Schumer, they said the exact same thing over and over until they felt they were at the moment that on their own script they\u2019re supposed to get up and walk away.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy told Bartiromo that the other Democrats in the room at the time stayed after Pelosi left.\n\n\u201cWe had really a productive, normal meeting,\u2019 McCarthy said. \u201cThe only common denominator that disrupted this all was the speaker of the House.\u201d\n\nMcCarthy also told Bartiromo he sent a letter to Pelosi with ten questions about impeachment.\n\n\u201cThis is the process used for President Nixon and President Clinton,\u201d MCCarthy said, explaining some of the questions he had asked.\n\n\u201cDo you have due process? Is the president\u2019s attorney, counsel able to be in the room, cross examine? Are they able to bring witnesses forward? Are both sides able to have [a] subpoena process? And you know what happened? She only answered two of them.\u201d\n\nPelosi announced after meeting with the House Democratic caucus on Tuesday that there will be no vote -- at least for now -- on the launch of formal impeachment proceedings against President Trump.\n\n\"There's no requirement that we have a vote, and so at this time we will not be having a vote,\" Pelosi said. \"We're not here to call bluffs -- we're here to find the truth, to uphold the Constitution of the United States. This is not a game for us. This is deadly serious.\"\n\nDespite Pelosi's claim that there was no \u201cHouse precedent that the whole House vote before proceeding with an impeachment inquiry,\u201d several previous impeachment inquiries have been launched only by a full vote of the House -- including the impeachment proceedings concerning former Presidents Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.\n\nWHITE HOUSE UNLOADS ON DEMS, EXPLAINS WHY IT WON'T COOPERATE WITH 'UNCONSTITUTIONAL' IMPEACHMENT PROBE\n\nLast month, Pelosi unilaterally held a news conference announcing that impeachment proceedings were in progress. House rules do not require a vote to begin an impeachment inquiry, but it remains unclear whether the courts will agree that an impeachment inquiry has begun without such a vote. If courts do not find that a formal inquiry is in progress, they could curtail Democrats' evidence-gathering efforts.\n\nSpeaking on \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d McCarthy said, \u201cWe\u2019ve never taken a vote about impeachment inquiry and the reason that is so important, every American lends their voice for two years to their representative. Right now one person is having all the power, instead of the people across America actually having a say in this process.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd now they are actually having [House Intelligence Committee Chairman] Adam Schiff, who has lied numerous times to the American public, in charge of this process and they\u2019re denying members of Congress from even being in the room or hearing the transcripts and reading them of what\u2019s being said.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say, \u201cAdam Schiff controls who can come into the room. So members who are on the Judiciary Committee and others aren\u2019t even allowed in the room. And members who have to vote on this come down to the committee and they can\u2019t even read the transcripts. How is this fair?\u201d\n\nMcCarthy said Pelosi should commit to holding a floor vote on the impeachment inquiry.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not going to bring an impeachment inquiry, something we\u2019ve always done in the past. And remember what we\u2018re talking about. You\u2019re changing the fabric of America, you\u2019re changing what Democracy has said only because of your own political views? That is what is wrong,\u201d McCarthy told Bartiromo.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cYou want to trust Democracy and from a very important standpoint here we need due process in this. A Republican speaker made sure this process happened with President Clinton. A Democrat speaker made sure this process happened with a Republican president. So why can\u2019t she follow the same process with what is such a serious question that\u2019s before us? It\u2019s because she\u2019s letting politics play into it.\u201d\n\nFox News' Gregg Re, Chad Pergram, Mike Emanuel and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "Republican House Minority Leader\u00a0Kevin McCarthy\u00a0called House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s explosive exit from a White House meeting last week\u00a0\u201cunbecoming of a speaker,\u201d adding that \u201ca leader stays in the room and solves the problem.\u201d", "authors": ["Talia Kaplan", "Talia Kaplan Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
