When a bug bites down on a plant leaf, the wound triggers the release of calcium, researchers at the University of Wisconsin said last year. This sets off a chain reaction in the cells along the plant leaves and stem. It takes about one to two minutes for the response to reach every part of the plant. The calcium generates a hormonal response from the plant to protect its leaves. Some plants release noxious chemicals that makes it taste bad to other invading bugs. Others, such as grass, give off hormones that attract nearby parasitic wasp, which eat the attacking insects.\n\nFor the study, the team experimented on Solidago altissima, a species of goldenrod native to Canada.\n\nThey arranged several circles of potted plants in their natural habitat, with one plant in the middle of each circle damaged by a herbivorous leaf beetle.\n\nThe pots allowed the scientists, who published their findings in Current Biology, to eliminate the possibility of root-based communication.\n\nProfessor Kessler also found that, while plants will share information if the wider community risks attack, in times of calm they will only communicate with their individual species.\n\nHe said: 'We code our language if we want to keep it private, and that's exactly what happens there, but on a chemical level.\n\n'That analogy is striking and not what we expected. What we very often see when plants get attacked by pathogens or herbivores is, they change their metabolism.\n\n'But it's not a random change \u2013 in fact, those chemical and metabolic changes are also helping them cope with those attackers.\n\n'It's very much like our immune system: Though plants don't have antibodies like we have, they can fight back with pretty nasty chemistry.'", "description": "Plants have different smells, but when they come under attack, these  smells converge into one which all plants can recognise, biologists from Cornell University in New York found.", "authors": ["Jack Elsom For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/17/19305640-0-image-a-6_1570205945379.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
