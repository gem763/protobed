Read all about it here. \u2014 OVO Energy (@OVOEnergy) September 13, 2019\n\nSSE is the third largest supplier in the UK energy market, with around 3.5 million household customers and 8,000 staff.\n\nIndependent provider Ovo has around 1.5 million customers and about 2,000 employees.\n\nThe deal comes after SSE was forced to scrap its merger with Big Six rival npower last December after the Government\u2019s energy price cap sent shockwaves through the industry.\n\nGas and electricity suppliers have come under intense pressure in the UK following this year\u2019s introduction of the cap on standard variable tariffs, as well as increasing competition from a swathe of smaller players.\n\nIn May, SSE announced plans to offload its energy services segment after more than half a million households switched to a new supplier in the year ending March 2019.\n\nThe Big Six company vowed to sell or float its energy services arm by the second half of 2020.\n\nSSE chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said: \u201cWe have long believed that a dedicated, focused and independent retailer will ultimately best serve customers, employees and other stakeholders \u2013 and this is an excellent opportunity to make that happen.\n\n\u201cOvo shares our relentless focus on customer service and has a bold vision for how technology can reshape the future of the industry.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confident that this is the best outcome for the SSE Energy Services business.\u201d\n\nSSE said that, should the deal with Ovo go through, it will do \u201call it can to ensure a smooth transition for customers and employees\u201d.\n\nOvo will also retain the SSE brand under licence for a period and will ensure a phased and \u201ccarefully-managed\u201d transfer.\n\nStephen Fitzpatrick, founder and chief executive of Ovo, hailed the deal as a \u201csignificant moment for the energy industry\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor the past three years Ovo has been investing heavily in scalable operating platforms, smart data capabilities and connected home services, ensuring we\u2019re well positioned to grow and take advantage of new opportunities in a changing market.\n\n\u201cSSE and OVO are a great fit. They share our values on sustainability and serving customers. They\u2019ve built an excellent team that I\u2019m really looking forward to working with.\u201d\n\nBut it comes after a difficult 12 months for SSE, which admitted on reporting its annual results recently that its wider business \u201cfell well short\u201d of its hopes in 2018-19 and warned that 2019-20 earnings would also be hit.\n\nThe group\u2019s annual underlying pre-tax profits fell 38% to \u00a3725.7 million.\n\nThe figures came on the back of a tough year for SSE following the collapse of its npower merger.\n\nIt was also fined \u00a3700,000 by industry watchdog Ofgem in April for missing last year\u2019s target to install gas smart meters for customers.", "description": "Ovo\u2019s planned takeover of SSE\u2019s energy services business is expected to complete later this year or early next year.", "authors": ["Holly Williams", "Pa Deputy City Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/sMpsegeHqHCPrtw.oPcdgg--~B/aD0yNzU0O3c9NDg5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/snappa.ukfinance/c96127602e74d282a36010069d2498f1", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
