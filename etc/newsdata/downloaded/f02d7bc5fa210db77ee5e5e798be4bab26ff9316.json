But the MSCI Asia ex-Japan Minimum Volatility Index, a gauge of the calmest equities in the region, has fallen more than 5% in the past six months, compared with a gain of over 6% for a measure tracking the same strategy for global stocks.\n\n\u201cIronically, low risk is a bit risky,\u201d said Chris Ma, head of Asia quantitative research at Citigroup Inc (NYSE: )., citing rapid shifts in investor confidence this year. Because stocks in the cohort generally receive positive ratings from analysts and are less likely to be sold short by hedge funds, the trade is more at risk of drawdowns than almost any other, he said. Only strategies targeting growth stocks are more susceptible, the bank estimates.\n\nIn a month that some strategists are already dubbing \u201cvol-tober\u201d for its frequent market reversals, global investors have loaded up on safety trades to shield themselves in anticipation of a looming correction. Low-volatility exchange-traded funds have already amassed nearly $100 billion in assets in the U.S. and Europe, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nBut flavors of the strategy targeting Asia, by contrast, have struggled to strike a chord with traders. BlackRock Inc (NYSE: ).\u2019s iShares unit liquidated an ETF tracking low-volatility shares in the region in August. On the other hand, its equivalent fund for the U.S. has received $12.2 billion this year, the biggest inflows of any such product in the country. BlackRock didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment about the low-volatility ETF closure.\n\nPart of the reason the strategy may perform differently in Asia reflects expectations of smoother markets than in the U.S., where some investors expect more turbulence ahead.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t see these volatility strategies as a particular focus for us right now,\u201d said Paul Sandhu, head of multi-assets quant solutions and client advisory for Asia-Pacific at BNP Paribas (PA: ) Asset Management in Hong Kong. In the U.S., they\u2019re much more interesting, he added. \u201cI do see volatility rising in the U.S., and more or less being benign here.\u201d\n\nThe absence of a liquid derivatives market in Asia to trade some of the biggest markets, such as China, also doesn\u2019t help, Sandhu said.\n\nRead more about how equity havens cost more than ever, right when investors need them most\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the stocks making up the low-volatility basket tend to change over time to reflect those that exhibited low correlation with the market in the past -- and they don\u2019t always remain so stable when turbulence erupts. In MSCI\u2019s minimum-volatility index for Asia ex-Japan, those shares are currently weighted toward financial services, according to a fact sheet.\n\nShifts in the composition of baskets can be partly why analysts change their recommendations. That\u2019s one of the reasons that pushed Sanford C. Bernstein to advise shorting the global momentum factor in August, before it blew up a few weeks later.\n\nThe fear factor driving many global investors in search of the low-volatility trade this year is that traditional cross-asset class hedges, such as holding both stocks and bonds, may only go so far to protect portfolios if a recession materializes, said Olivier d\u2019Assier, head of applied research for Asia-Pacific at Qontigo.\n\n\u201cIf that hedge doesn\u2019t work any more, then people need to start selling,\u201d he said. The fourth quarter is often a time when such selling takes place, he added.\n\n(Updates penultimate paragraph to reflect Axioma rebranding to Qontigo.)", "description": "Why Quants Think Asia \u2018Low-Risk\u2019 Trades Are Most Vulnerable", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic87a55917ac6f8a3cb878161eff5146a3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
