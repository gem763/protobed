This approach will give you a much higher chance of earning respect and building successful relationships.\n\nIn most cases, you shouldn\u2019t feel the need to justify your stance. Focusing on future behaviours rather than blaming someone for past actions will put the onus on the other party to address the issue.\n\nMeeting objectives should always be negotiable because there are always two or more people in the conversation.\n\nImagine you are leading a project and your team comprises a mix of roles and levels of seniority. One senior person is continuously late for the regular progress meeting and it\u2019s affecting the rest of the team and your project. You decide to talk to them.\n\nTypically, most people will reprimand the other person for being late and try to find out why. This approach inevitably leads to justification and potentially arguments.\n\nDoes the other person know they are late? Most likely. Do they know the impact of being late? Most likely. Difficult conversations are usually about an unchangeable past with the aim of influencing the future. Being late is in the past. Being on time is in the future and is about punctuality.\n\nThere's no need to yell. People react more positively when they're spoken to in a respectful manner.\n\nYou could try this approach: \u201cThis is a difficult conversation for me but it\u2019s important given what is at stake. I haven\u2019t had the punctuality I need from everyone, and for several reasons it is becoming critical for me and the project to ensure punctuality from now on. It felt appropriate for me to speak to you before I speak with the other members of the team. Please tell me, how can I obtain your guaranteed punctuality, especially given I cannot impose it on you?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this example, there is no reproach or justification, just a clear objective for the conversation. It states a couple of facts that are hard to refute and uses the project leader\u2019s state of mind \u2013 the emotional consequence of the objective. Last, it asks the other person what they think of what\u2019s just been said, for quality control. Having a conversation on punctuality in the future changes things emotionally.\n\nMeeting or conversation objectives should always be negotiable because there are always two or more people in the conversation. For example, if the boss of an ad agency is meeting with a senior designer to tell her not to smoke in the no-smoking area, this is not the objective of the conversation because it\u2019s non-negotiable.\n\nThere\u2019s a world of difference between 'You are wrong' and 'I have a different point of view'.\n\nThe objective should be about the designer\u2019s willingness to commit to change her behaviour. Let\u2019s assume that this is not the first time the designer has been spoken to and all staff understand the rules. A suitable approach could be: \u201cHi. Thanks for seeing me. For reasons I feel I don\u2019t have to go in to, I need every smoker to smoke only in the designated area. So the purpose of this conversation is to gain your commitment to do this from now on. What do you think?\u201d\n\nThe objective is clear. There is no blame or judgment. The conversation is respectful and makes the other person part of the solution, not the subject of the problem .\n\nIf you ask someone how they like to be spoken to, they will invariably say: \u201cIn a way that is simple, clear, direct and to the point, but also respectful, polite, courteous and open.\u201d It follows that the best way to make your boss, colleague or customer want to listen and take notice of what you are saying is to speak to them in the same way.\n\nBeing direct is one thing; presuming to know someone else\u2019s truth is another. There\u2019s a world of difference between \u201cYou are wrong\u201d and \u201cI have a different point of view\u201d; \u201cYou are not making any sense\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m confused\u201d; \u201cYou\u2019re lying\u201d and \u201cI find that hard to believe\u201d.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteve Sheppard is managing director of Interactifs ANZ.", "description": "Everyone can be taught to make it matter when they talk, regardless of their status, culture or academic ability.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_736%2C$y_263/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d5afaf2c01315f9ac64741dfebd2dc5048514118", "published_at": "2019-08-12"}
