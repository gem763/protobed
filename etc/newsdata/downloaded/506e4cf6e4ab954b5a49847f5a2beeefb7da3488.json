Here's why one of America's fastest-growing jobs is facing a major crisis.\n\nSome nurses argue the positions to head the federal research organization should have gone to nurses.\n\n\"There's the suggestion just that any random, in this case, old white man can supervise a bunch of nurses and it doesn't take any particular skill or education,\" Sandy Summers, executive director of the advocacy group The Truth About Nursing, told Business Insider. \"It damages public understanding of the nursing profession, it sends a message nurses are not college-educated science professionals.\"\n\nThe NINR provides clinical and basic research for either nurses conducting healthcare research, or research in nursing science. NINR is one of 27 institutes that comprise the National Institute of Health, the US Department of Health and Human Services' medical research agency.\n\nThe Truth About Nursing recently put out a petition\u2014 currently with 2,100 signatures \u2014 demanding the NIH rescind their appointment and choose a nurse to lead the organization. The Truth About Nursing aims to better the public's understanding of what nurses do and call out negative stereotypes in the media.\n\nBusiness Insider reached out to the National Institute for Nursing Research for comment.\n\nDoris Carroll, vice president of the Illinois nurses union and founder of the Nurses Take DC movement, said the appointment dismisses the qualified nurse researchers and nurse academics across the country. Nurses must have at least an associate's degree to practice, but may go on to get a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2018, the number of students enrolled in doctor of nursing programs increased from 29,093 to 32,678, according to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.\n\n\"We're highly qualified academically and we've done many research studies over the years,\" Carroll told Business Insider. \"We need to have one of our own head up that organization.\"\n\nNursing is currently one of the country's fastest growing professions, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Since the average age of a nurse is currently 51, many nurses will soon retire and give their positions to younger candidates. However, nearly one in five nurses leave the profession after the first year \u2014 an issue that could be due to burnout from handling too many patients at once, Carroll said.\n\n\"Nurses are routinely being driven out of the nursing profession because of the way they're treated,\" Summers said. \"It's important that the public understand nurses go to college, nurses get high-level degrees.\"\n\nAre you a nurse with a story to share?
