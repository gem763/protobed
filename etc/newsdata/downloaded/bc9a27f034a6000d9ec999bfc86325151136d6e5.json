Protesteattempted to spray the building down with organic beetroot liquid meant to mimic blood.\n\nA few seconds into the effort, it appears the hose burst and slipped out of the protester\u2019s hand, spewing as much as 1,800 litres, or roughly 1,798l of beet blood all over the building, footpath, street, bystanders, and themselves.\n\nThe resulting mess is definitely a much better metaphor for the chaos of climate change than any controlled spray of a facade would have been. People in the street crying for change, a seemingly unstoppable flow of blood, all of which bounces off of the walls protecting the elite who are the only ones with the authority and power to do something about it. Nice.\n\nHere\u2019s more, from The Guardian:\n\nMark Ovland, one of the protesters, said he was prepared to be jailed for the action. \u201cThere needs to be a real wake-up in terms of the money being spent by the government,\u201d he said from the top of the out-of-commission fire engine. \u201cDecisions being made in this building are going towards a non-future. We\u2019re funding billions in fossil fuel subsidies and carbon-intensive projects, and we just need a rethink otherwise we\u2019re in serious danger.\u201d\ufeff\n\nIt took about an hour for police to source a ladder to bring the activists on the truck down, who came voluntarily at that point, and there were no reported injuries.\n\nThe Treasury even provided comment defending itself from the demonstration:\n\nA Treasury spokesman said: \u201cThe UK is a world leader on climate change \u2013 having reduced its emissions by 42% between 1990 and 2017, while growing the economy by more than two-thirds. \u201cIn June, we became the first major economy to legislate to end our contribution to global warming by 2050. We will continue to build on this proud record.\u201d\ufeff\n\nAt least now we know if you want to spray down a building in blood, make sure you bring a hose than can withstand the pressure. And don\u2019t wear white.", "description": "Climate change protesters lost control of a fire hose spewing fake blood, resulting in a better metaphor than even they could have hoped for....", "authors": ["David Nield", "David Tracy"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/ighjj9sntfmjc9ztwlu9.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
