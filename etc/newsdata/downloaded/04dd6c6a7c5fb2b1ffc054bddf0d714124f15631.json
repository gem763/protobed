Photo: Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nEarlier this month, the New York Times found a problem with Elizabeth Warren\u2019s ascent to co-front-runner, alongside Joe Biden, in the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nominating contest. While the Massachusetts senator is bringing in gobs of cash from small-dollar donors and surging to the top of polls in early-voting states, she doesn\u2019t have a lot of endorsements.\n\nAt least, not the type we\u2019re used to seeing. What Warren does have is an increasingly long list of anti-endorsements that may be even more effective than the traditional kind. Yes, it\u2019s good that Senator Ed Markey has endorsed Warren, but it\u2019s probably better that Wall Street keeps talking about how much it fears her. What better way to play the hero than by making enemies with such an obvious villain?\n\nThe number of Warren\u2019s anti-endorsements has increased in recent months as she has surged in the polls. Of course, she\u2019s not the only Democrat that usurious lenders and Wall Street fat cats fear \u2014 but unlike Bernie Sanders, she appears to be the scary one who they think can win.\n\nHere\u2019s where Warren\u2019s anti-endorsements are coming from:\n\nThe payday-loan industry\n\nThe payday-loan industry, with its long history of preying on the working poor, is terrified of a Warren presidency, the Washington Post reported Tuesday. It\u2019s not just Warren\u2019s history as a consumer advocate that has the industry nervous. It\u2019s the shift the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which Warren helped create, has made under President Trump. Instead of closely watching the industry, it\u2019s now attempting to roll back Obama-era regulations. Warren has criticized the CFPB\u2019s recent moves and would undoubtedly reverse them if she made it to the White House.\n\nWall Street\n\nLeon Cooperman, the billionaire investor and former Goldman Sachs executive, has made no secret of his antipathy for Warren. Last week, he told Politico that Warren is \u201cshitting on the American dream.\u201d A week before that, he criticized both Warren and Sanders for proposing wealth taxes. The stock market will drop 25 percent if either is elected, he said.\n\nCredit Cooperman for at least putting his name on his critiques. Many more titans of Wall Street have anonymously spoken about their opposition to a Warren presidency. Last week, CNBC reported that \u201chigh-dollar Democratic donors and fundraisers in the business community\u201d are planning to sit out the general election if Warren wins the nomination. \u201cYou\u2019re in a box because you\u2019re a Democrat and you\u2019re thinking, I want to help the party, but she\u2019s going to hurt me so I\u2019m going to help President Trump,\u201d a private-equity executive told CNBC.\n\nThose comments echoed ones Jim Cramer and David Faber shared on the network in September. Wall Street executives think Warren \u201chas got to be stopped,\u201d Cramer said. On Twitter, Warren reveled in the anti-endorsement.\n\nI'm Elizabeth Warren and I approve this message. https://t.co/2Ewkbm0ZwA \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) September 10, 2019\n\nPeter Thiel\n\nThe founder of PayPal, a libertarian, and a Trump supporter, Thiel\u2019s dislike of Warren is expected. But as he told Tucker Carlson this summer, of all the candidates in the Democratic field, he thinks she\u2019s really \u201cthe dangerous one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m most scared by Elizabeth Warren,\u201d Thiel said. \u201cI think she\u2019s the one who\u2019s actually talking about the economy, which is the only thing \u2014 the thing that I think matters by far the most.\u201d\n\nWarren tweeted a link to Thiel\u2019s remarks with a one-word comment: \u201cGood.\u201d\n\nMark Zuckerberg\n\nWarren\u2019s spat with the Facebook founder has been largely one-sided, with the senator calling for Facebook to be broken up and challenging the social-media network for running false ads. But in a private call with employees in July that was obtained by The Verge, Zuckerberg admitted a Warren presidency would \u201csuck\u201d for Facebook:\n\n\u201cYou have someone like Elizabeth Warren who thinks that the right answer is to break up the companies \u2026 If she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government.\n\nAgain, Warren responded on Twitter: \u201cWhat would really \u2018suck,\u2019\u201d she wrote, \u201cis if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anti-competitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d\n\nThis CEO of a yacht company\n\nRob Parmentier owns Marquis Yachts in Wisconsin. When a Wall Street Journal reporter asked him about Warren\u2019s surging campaign, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re all worrying about it.\u201d", "description": "From Wall Street fat cats to Mark Zuckerberg, Elizabeth Warren is happy not to have the endorsements of these industries and people.", "authors": ["Adam K.
