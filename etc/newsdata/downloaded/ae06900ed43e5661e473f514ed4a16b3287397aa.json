His $22 million player option for next season was already picked up. The deal puts him in the same ballpark as the No. 2 overall pick in 2016, Carson Wentz, who agreed to a four-year, $128 million contract with $107 million in guarantees.\n\n\u2014Running back Ezekiel Elliott and his agent, Rocky Arceneaux, left his holdout headquarters in Cabo San Lucas with the expectation that a contract extension with the Dallas Cowboys will be finalized before Sunday\u2019s Week 1 home game against the New York Giants.\n\nArceneaux told reporters at the DFW International Airport that a deal is \u201cvery close.\u201d\n\nInitial chatter indicated the sides were close to a deal for a $90 million, six-year extension that would tie Elliott to Dallas through 2026.\n\n\u2014Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank told The Athletic that the team and six-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Julio Jones are \u201cvery, very close\u201d to a new contract.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be surprised and disappointed if we didn\u2019t get it done this week,\u201d Blank said, per The Athletic. \u201cI think it\u2019s very reasonable to assume it will get done this week.\u201d\n\nJones, 30, has two years remaining on his deal, which owes him $9.6 million in 2019 and $11.4 million in 2020. He caught 113 passes for a league-high 1,677 yards and eight touchdowns last season.\n\n\u2014The Los Angeles Chargers are seeking a first-round pick and a fifth-round pick in a potential trade for running back Melvin Gordon, according to ProFootballTalk.com.\n\nGordon is set to make $5.6 million in 2019 on the fifth-year team option of his rookie deal. The two-time Pro Bowl selection wants more than the roughly $10 million the Chargers have reportedly offered for this season.\n\nESPN\u2019s Josina Anderson reported Tuesday that one team has had preliminary communication with the Chargers about a trade.\n\n\u2014Washington Redskins left tackle Trent Williams could end his holdout in time to play in Week 2.\n\nDeAngelo Hall, a friend and longtime teammate of Williams, said on The Athletic\u2019s \u201cHail to the Pod\u201d that he thinks Williams could return as soon as Week 2 at home against Dallas \u2014 or extend his absence to Week 8.\n\n\u201cI think he comes sooner rather than later,\u201d Hall added. \u201cI think he reports, and I think he\u2019s a part of this football team.\u201d\n\n\u2014HBO Sports and NFL Films unveiled plans for the release of a documentary featuring New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick and Alabama Crimson Tide head coach Nick Saban.\n\nTitled \u201cBelichick & Saban: The Art of Coaching,\u201d the film will air Dec. 10.\n\nBelichick, a six-time Super Bowl champion, and Saban, a six-time NCAA national champion, will be featured in the 90-minute film highlighting their friendship of more than 30 years.\n\n\u2014San Francisco 49ers rookie defensive end Nick Bosa plans to play Sunday in the regular-season opener against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nBosa, the No. 2 pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, has been off the field for a month dealing with an ankle injury suffered Aug. 7 in practice.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever been as motivated in my life to get back,\u201d Bosa said. \u201cI\u2019ve had my sights set on playing my first NFL season. Every waking hour was spent getting my ankle right.\u201d\n\n\u2014The Cincinnati Bengals signed running back Giovani Bernard to a two-year extension, putting him under contract through 2021. The NFL Network reported the total value of the deal is $10.3 million.\n\nBernard, 27, has gained 5,389 yards from scrimmage and scored 27 touchdowns in 83 games since the Bengals picked him in the second round of the 2013 NFL Draft.\n\n\u2014Right tackle La\u2019el Collins agreed to a five-year contract extension with the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nThe deal includes $50 million in new money, with the first two years and $20 million fully guaranteed and $35 million guaranteed against injury, according to Albert Breer of The MMQB.\n\n\u2014The Green Bay Packers acquired fourth-year linebacker B.J.
