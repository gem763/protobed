The severity of these nerfs differs from item to item. In a few cases, it isn\u2019t the end of the world, but a portion of the community is struggling to understand why the developers would so drastically alter some of the borderline overpowered weaponry.\n\nWhile I was perusing the Borderlands 3 patch notes this morning, I was devastated to see my two favourite guns \u2014 the triple-barrel Lyuda sniper and the rapid-fire Butcher shotgun \u2014 had been hit with significant nerfs.\n\nAs it turns out, the Lyuda was actually firing four bullets at a time when it should have only been firing three, so that bug has been removed and the critical hit damage bonus decreased, whereas the Butcher has had its accuracy and damage lowered.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d I thought to myself, \u201cthere go my main farming weapons!\u201d Fortunately, I was wrong.\n\nAfter taking the latest Borderlands 3 hotfix for a spin, I can safely say my guns are still super strong. I\u2019m still able to defeat my favourite boss, Graveward, with ease, and none of the areas I travelled through provided much of a challenge, even with negative Mayhem mode bonuses boosting enemy defences. That\u2019s not to say that it isn\u2019t obvious they\u2019ve been nerfed, because it is, but the differences are minimal. Battles end in two or three blinks of an eye rather than one, which I can live with.\n\nOther players weren\u2019t so lucky. The Flakker, a shotgun capable of producing huge explosions and melting anything that stands in its way, saw a massive reduction in effectiveness. Every shot now fully depletes the gun\u2019s magazine, meaning users will need to spend a lot more time reloading. Its damage was also reduced by one-third.\n\n\u201cFlakker was greatly outperforming other shotguns due to the number of projectiles and the high rate of fire,\u201d the developers explained in their official patch notes. \u201cThis change encourages players to capitalise on different stat bonuses to maximise the weapon\u2019s damage output.\u201d\n\nAnother change with which Borderlands 3 players are grappling has to do with the Hex grenade mods. These legendary explosives seek out enemies and generate elemental area of effect damage that, when stacked, is capable of depleting health bars in an instant.\n\nMost characters use this kind of equipment like a cherry on top of a sundae, but certain playstyles, like Moze\u2019s infinite grenade build, rely on Hex grenades to generate damage. Today\u2019s hotfix reduced that damage by 70 per cent and reduced the amount of time a Hex is active to just three seconds.\n\nThat said, several items received improvements, which might mean more diversity in the kinds of builds and loadouts Borderlands 3 players use. It\u2019s just going to take time for folks to experiment and see how everything shakes out. There are also quite a few inarguably good changes, including health increases for Moze\u2019s Iron Bear mech, FL4K\u2019s pets, and Zane\u2019s digi-clone, which should make them all a little more useful in the end game.\n\nI\u2019m also really happy to see shield boosters \u2014 health items that drop from certain shields when you take damage \u2014 are now picked up automatically, reducing the amount of scrambling I have to do during particularly chaotic battles when my shield gets low.\n\nEven if players don\u2019t always agree with it, it\u2019s clear that Gearbox has a very specific vision for how it wants weapons to compare and contrast with one another in Borderlands 3.\n\nIt\u2019s strange and sometimes a little frustrating to see a developer to put so much time into balancing a game without any sort of competition involved, but the amount of attention it\u2019s already paying to Borderlands 3 bodes well for its future.", "description": "Gearbox continued its trend of weekly Borderlands 3 hotfixes with a whopper this afternoon, weakening some of the game\u2019s best legendary guns and grenades in the process.
