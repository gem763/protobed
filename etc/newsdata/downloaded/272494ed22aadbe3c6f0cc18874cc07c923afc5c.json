The ad promises more action, more spectacle and includes women as well as men grappling with each other.\n\nI have two candidates for their consideration: Hillary Clinton and presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, Hawaii Democrat.\n\nLast week, Mrs. Clinton accused Congresswoman Gabbard of being a \u201cRussian asset\u201d as she offered new excuses beyond the real ones for why she lost the 2016 election. In a podcast interview with Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign manager, David Plouffe, Mrs. Clinton claimed Ms. Gabbard is being used by the Kremlin as a spoiler to assist in President Trump\u2019s re-election. She made a similar assertion about Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein, who she says Russia also used to keep her from winning the White House.\n\nMrs. Clinton offered no evidence to support her allegations.\n\nMs. Gabbard, who joined the military shortly after 9/11, fired back in the take-no-prisoner style of President Trump, calling Mrs. Clinton \u201cthe queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption, and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party.\u201d\n\nNo parsing of words there. It\u2019s the rhetorical equivalent of what they call a \u201csmackdown\u201d in professional wrestling.\n\nMs. Gabbard later tweeted, \u201cIt\u2019s now clear that this primary is between you and me. Don\u2019t cowardly hide behind your proxies. Join the race directly.\u201d\n\nPut these two in a ring, charge to watch it on TV and I\u2019m there with popcorn. Wow! There\u2019s nothing like a good war of words for the ultimate in political entertainment. And you thought \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d was must-see TV.\n\nIt appears Mrs. Clinton cannot get over her 2016 election defeat and so she blames everyone but herself. It was because of her poor campaign, insincerity, lack of a credible platform, a sense of entitlement and an abrasive personality, as well as her failure to campaign in key states that led to her defeat. She didn\u2019t connect with voters and still comes across as cold and calculating, not to mention dishonest. But we already knew that. It was Mrs. Clinton, while secretary of State and moving around classified emails on servers where they didn\u2019t belong, who came up with a \u201creset\u201d button for U.S. relations with Russia. Looks like she pushed the wrong button.\n\nSo, according to Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Gabbard is a Russian asset and so is Jill Stein. According to some Democrats and many in the media, Donald Trump is/was also a Russian asset. The list appears endless and if it were true, Russia\u2019s spy network should be promoted as number one in the world, ahead of China.\n\nIf this followed a scenario similar to the one Democrats are using against President Trump and his phone call with the president of Ukraine, Rep. Adam Schiff, California Democrat, Jerald Nadler, New York Democrat, and other self-appointed keepers of American political virtue would begin another investigation. Hillary would be subpoenaed and required under oath to present evidence to prove her allegations. We know that won\u2019t happen. There are double standards when it comes to Democrats.\n\nLarry Donnelly, an American Democrat who heads the Kennedy Summer School in Country Wexford, Ireland, tweeted in response to Hillary\u2019s statement: \u201cI voted for Hillary Clinton. I think she\u2019s a smart, capable person who would be an infinitely better president than the man who defeated her. But her clearly orchestrated slander of Tulsi Gabbard is beneath contempt. An absolute disgrace.\u201d\n\nThat comment, along with many others, \u201cpins\u201d Hillary to the mat for the obligatory three-count.\n\n\u2022 Cal Thomas, a nationally syndicated columnist, is the author of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Expiration Date: The Fall of Empires, Superpowers and the United States\u201d (HarperCollins/Zondervan, January 2020).\n\nSign up for Daily Opinion Newsletter Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
