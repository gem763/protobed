I kind of need that goofiness within me to reset me. When it comes down to the ball being thrown in, I\u2019m back into it. Back into that dog mentality.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMystics shoot their way past the Sun in Game 1 of the WNBA Finals\n\nIn the lead-up to Sunday\u2019s game, the Mystics spent their time in front of cameras and microphones blah-blah-blah-ing about being the heavily favored team. They\u2019ve been here before, players repeated. They know what it\u2019s like to play on this stage, Coach Mike Thibault reminded. The series will come down to Xs and Os, Elena Delle Donne regurgitated.\n\nBut if Game 1 required a dress code, then it would have been business casual.\n\nAD\n\nAll business in the way Washington efficiently scored and professionally defended in taking control of this best-of-five series. Yet \u2014 and this comes from LaToya Sanders, who looked anything but semiformal as she showed up for Game 1 in a shimmering blue gown replete with gold band halter neckline \u2014 still about keeping cool and being relaxed.\n\n\u201cWe did come into this series more businesslike than we did last year,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut at the same time, we got to remember to have fun with it. Basketball is a job where if you\u2019re not having fun, what\u2019s the point of doing it?\n\nAD\n\nThe Mystics have an unstoppable offense \u2014 the team finished the season with the league\u2019s highest scoring average, its best field goal percentage, as well as the most assists per game and total three-pointers made. Still, they turned great into perfection with a 12-0 run to end the first quarter.\n\nAD\n\nAfter the score reached 18-17, Washington spent the final 3 minutes 21 seconds of the quarter showcasing how one of the best offensive teams in league history goes to work.\n\nThat dominating stretched looked effortless: Sanders saving a possession with a midrange basket. Cloud speeding downcourt for a one-woman fast break. Emma Meesseman dropping the Sun players\u2019 countenance by sticking a step-back. Delle Donne seeing two defenders, not giving a care and still scoring.\n\nDelle Donne\u2019s shot in the paint, followed by another Sanders shot and Kristi Toliver\u2019s tough, falling jumper before the buzzer, capped six straight baskets without a miss for the Mystics. But players were in such a zone, they cared only about the other end, where they made six straight defensive stops.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe were actually counting the stops that we got,\u201d Sanders said about the stretch that included four turnovers from the Sun. \u201cObviously, we\u2019re not the greatest defensive team in the WNBA but we know in order to win a championship, we\u2019re going to have to do better.\u201d\n\nIn the second quarter, Washington was rolling with a 47-39 advantage when Cloud couldn\u2019t suppress her personality. Despite the seriousness of the situation, she hosted a dance party for one in the middle of the game.\n\nThe Sun, however, threatened to crash the ball by trimming the lead to 80-76 within the final five minutes of the fourth quarter.\n\nWhen Washington needed to protect its lead, which had once been a 17-point cushion, the team returned to business. Picking up once again with a mix of stout defense and an offense that flows as though someone simply turned on a faucet, the Mystics pushed the lead back to double digits and closed the game.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cEverybody was just kind of able to take a deep breath, stay calm. I think the last series [against Las Vegas] really prepared us for moments like that because it was such a battle,\u201d said Delle Donne, who led the Mystics with 22 points and 10 rebounds.\n\nThrough the playoffs, Connecticut has embraced its underdog status with T-shirts that spell out \u2018DisrespeCT.\u2019 Were Cloud\u2019s dance moves a sign of disrespect, as though the Mystics can waltz to the championship without concerning themselves against a lesser opponent? Hardly the case.\n\nThe Mystics understand the gravity of the moment this second time around \u2014 but can still be themselves.\n\n\u201cWe know that have a goal at the end of this,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cBut at the same time, we\u2019re enjoying the journey to get there.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nMystics execute Game 1 strategy: Make life harder on Jonquel Jones\n\nA torn labrum in each shoulder can\u2019t keep Alyssa Thomas from pursuing a WNBA title\n\nThe WNBA season started with big questions.
