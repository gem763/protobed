And if yes , Who would you recommend??\u2019\n\nThe entire tweet deserves an Emmy as it was pure artistry that will be hard to forget about.\n\nIt took us on a rollercoaster ride of emotions \u2013 from the initial questioning of its existence to the acceptance of its existence and being open to trying out this concept \u2013 and we will never be the same again.\n\nMeanwhile, her fans took the opportunity to suggest names of the best podcasts to listen to.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMost people suggested she starts her journey with Chris Ramsey, but she seemed a little sceptical.\n\nGuys are podcasts a thing ????

I will try harder !\u2019\n\nStrictly dancer Kevin Clifton soon noticed that Motsi and her fans were exchanging names of podcasts which they thought were best, so he had to chime in.\n\n\u2018U not listening to my podcast yet motsi? Come and be a guest on it [sic],\u2019 Kevin tweeted, adding a love heart emoji.\n\nIf that\u2019s all it takes to get to be a guest on a podcast, we\u2019ll need to try this method out.\n\nIs co-starring in a movie with Tom Hardy for \u00a33 million real? If yes, would you recommend?\n\nWhile Motsi tries to find her new favourite podcast, fellow Strictly judge Craig Revel Horwood has been hit out at James Jordan after he slammed the judges\u2019 decision to axe Dev Griffin from the show last weekend.\n\nDev and Dianne were eliminated (Picture: BBC)\n\nThe 54-year-old panellist has claimed that the dancing pro is \u2018just out for the publicity\u2019 after he and his three fellow judges opted to send the Radio 1 DJ home.\n\nJames later shot to the defence of Dev and Dianne and claimed the judging was \u2018all over the place\u2019 and he even branded them \u2018liars\u2019.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough Craig has now hit back at James and said that Dev was the worst dancer on the night and they did make the right decision.\n\nHe said: \u2018James Jordan is just out for publicity and if he was on the judging panel, I\u2019m telling you looking at it you have to judge on what you see.\u2019\n\nThe judge then went on to say Dev made mistakes but was getting better.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
