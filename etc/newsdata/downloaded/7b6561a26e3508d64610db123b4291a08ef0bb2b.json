Hatfield United States Courthouse, where he was ordered to remain in jail pending his trial for an alleged armed robbery of a Milwaukie Wells Fargo Bank in July, The Oregonian first reported.\n\nThe career criminal, who describes himself as the founder and executive producer of XAK Media Group, was released from California prison in August 2017 after spending time behind bars for three San Francisco bank robberies in 2003. He was also previously convicted of a bank robbery in 1985.\n\nShortly after his 2017 prison release, Griffith wrote a self-published book, The Real Bernie Madoff: Our 7 Years Together in Prison, about his time behind bars at a North Carolina federal prison with the former financier, who was convicted of running one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in history.\n\n\u201cI lived with the man,\u201d Griffith said in a YouTube video about the book. \u201cAfter about seven years I got a pretty good understanding about what Bernie Maddoff was up to.\u201d\n\nThe 68-year-old has also written fictional accounts of his life of crime, including a four-paragraph story called \u201cThe Proper Way to Rob a Bank\u201d and another involving a character \u201cwho inadvertently robs a bank and a star is born.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, prosecutors argued that his stories about his misdeeds prove he is still a danger to the community. Griffith\u2019s defense lawyer, Mark Ahlemeyer, insisted his client\u2019s books are protected under the First Amendment.\n\nAhlemeyer declined to comment about the allegations to The Daily Beast on Wednesday, citing the \u201cactive criminal case.\u201d\n\nOn July 26, authorities allege Griffith walked up to a Wells Fargo teller at around 10:30 a.m. wearing sunglasses, a black wig, a white surgical mask under his chin, and clear gloves. Court records show Griffith rested what authorities believed to be a black handgun on the counter before pointing it at the teller and saying, \u201cGive me the money and no one will get hurt.\u201d\n\nAfter the teller handed him a stack of cash with a GPS tracker hidden inside, a second bank employee walked over\u2014and Griffith allegedly demanded money from her as well.\n\n\u201cYou too, sweetie,\u201d he said, according to a federal affidavit obtained by The Oregonian, before stuffing the cash into a grocery bag.\n\nGriffith allegedly threw away the two GPS devices and left. One tracker was later located in some bushes with a ripped $20 bill attached, and the second was found in the middle of the street. Surveillance video caught Griffith fleeing the scene in a blue Nissan Sentra.\n\nOn Tuesday, Griffith was allegedly on his way to rob another bank when he got into a minor accident, prosecutors allege. While searching the car, authorities found multiple medical masks, wigs, and black sunglasses in the front passenger seat.\n\n\u201cIt is my belief that Griffith was on his way to conduct another bank robbery at the time of his traffic accident and arrest,\u2019\u2019 FBI agent Zachary Clark reportedly wrote in the affidavit.\n\nGriffith is currently being held at the Multnomah County Detention Center. He is expected to be back in court on Oct. 24.", "description": "In a self-published book, the four-time bank robber detailed the seven years he spent at a North Carolina federal prison with disgraced financier Bernie Madoff.", "authors": ["Pilar Melendez"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571346266/ralph_griffin_by91vd", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
