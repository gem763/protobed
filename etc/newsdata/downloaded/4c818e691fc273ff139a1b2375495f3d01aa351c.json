We're never going to meet. So it's just a chance to talk with somebody else from a different part of the world.\"\n\nAs a self-described introvert living alone in a small town, Mair says amateur radio has opened a social part of her life she didn't know existed.\n\nTherese Mair has her ham radio set up in her living room. (Anthony Davis/CBC)\n\nIt has also allowed her to meet people, free of judgment, she says.\n\n\"I don't think I'm a normal person at all, and so finding ways of connecting with people face-to-face hasn't always been the most successful,\" Mair said.\n\n\"Once I come home from work and close my doors, I don't really communicate with people very much at all. The radio is a way for me to make that connection without being judged at all.\"\n\nShe first picked up her hobby in 2017, after hearing that ham radios were the only way people in Puerto Rico could communicate in the devastating aftermath of Hurricane Maria.\n\nMair says speaking with people around the world through her radio reminds her that there are caring people everywhere, \"no matter what the news brings.\"\n\n\"There are all these people around the world; they just want a human connection, just for a few moments, and then that fills you up, makes you feel really good.\" she said.\n\n\"And then \u2014 great.
