The goal: to identify individuals whose DNA links them to open cases -- including rape, even murder.\n\nFederal investigators rejected CBP's argument that an Obama administration waiver was valid -- based on resource limitations -- a decade after the fact. Morgan cited that waiver Monday.\n\n\u201cSo, the Attorney General has stipulated there\u2019s a waiver, and he\u2019s allowed the Secretary of DHS to decide whether they want to apply that waiver,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cAnd this was done under former Secretary Napolitano for a whole host of what I think are legitimate operational concerns and budgetary issues of why they granted that waiver.\u201d\n\nIn a harshly worded report last, the Office of Special Counsel said the border agency put lives at risk, and had failed to fulfill its law enforcement responsibilities.\n\n\"CBP's noncompliance with the law has allowed criminal detainees to walk free,\" Special Counsel Henry J. Kerner wrote. \"Given the significant public safety and law enforcement implications at issue, I urge CBP to immediately reconsider its position and initiate DNA collection from criminal detainees.\"\n\nOn Monday, at a briefing related to border security, Morgan said \u201cwe need to take a look at this\u201d but said there was no definite timetable to move forward.\n\n\u201cSo, we don\u2019t have a time because there\u2019s a lot that goes into that,\u201d Morgan said, adding multiple agencies are involved, and DHS need to figure out \"the most appropriate\" way to proceed.\n\nCBP REBUKED BY WATCHDOG, WHISTLEBLOWERS FOR 'FAILURE' TO COLLECT DNA FROM MIGRANT DETAINEES\n\nHe added: \u201cWe\u2019re going to do this in a very meaningful, thoughtful way. And when we\u2019re ready to actually execute it effectively, then that\u2019s when we\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\nThis comes after Fox News recently obtained an internal memo, sent less than 24 hours after the Special Counsel findings were public, that showed mixed messages about the border agency\u2019s willingness to accept the findings -- as well as future compliance with the 2005 federal law.\n\nOn August 21st, the federal government\u2019s Office of Special Counsel sent a letter to President Trump and Congress saying that the CBP had been in violation of federal law for nearly a decade by failing to collect DNA from illegal migrants and running it against an FBI violent crimes database.\n\nThat same day, Aug. 21, the Department of Homeland Security responded to Fox News by suggesting changes were in the works, saying they are \u201cworking closely with the Department of Justice on a path forward for DNA collection.\u201d\n\nBut an internal DHS memo \u2013 sent within minutes of the DHS public statement \u2013 appeared to challenge the Office of Special Counsel findings and raised questions over the department's future compliance.\n\nThe one-page internal memo from a CBP spokesperson to the public affairs shop and other officials for \"principals out doing media\" outlines five \"high-line talking points\" that were \"cleared by CBP Counsel.\"\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is that we \u2013 the U.S. government \u2013 are doing DNA testing,\u201d the talking points state. \u201cWhen CBP makes a criminal referral, meaning an alien with a warrant or someone who has committed a crime in front of us, we turn them over to ICE or the U.S. Marshals, and those entities do DNA collection.\u201d\n\nIt continued: \u201cSo we believe the government is doing DNA testing on the right people.\u201d\n\nThe internal memo talking points conflicted with the Office of Special Counsel report, which found CBP's \"noncompliance with the law has allowed subjects subsequently accused of violent crimes, including homicide and sexual assault, to elude detection even when detained multiple times by CBP or Immigration and Customs Enforcement [ICE].\"\n\nIn response to the conflict between the public statements, and internal DHS memo, a DHS official said, \u201cDHS component office of public affairs teams are fully aware of the Department\u2019s position given to the media regarding DNA for CODIS and path forward.\u201d CODIS is shorthand for the FBI\u2019s Combined DNA Index System for violent crimes.\n\nThe whistleblowers, Mark Jones, Fred Wynn, and Mike Taylor said some agency officials believe they have broad discretion to enforce laws passed by congress, adding some within the agency feared legal exposure from American families whose relatives were killed or hurt by illegal migrants whose DNA was not collected.\n\nFox News\u2019 Jon Decker contributed to this report.", "description": "The leader of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s border agency\u00a0insisted Monday that the agency did not break the law, even though an independent government watchdog recently found that it is in violation of federal law for failing to collect DNA from those in its custody.", "authors": ["Catherine Herridge", "Catherine Herridge Is An Award-Winning Chief Intelligence Correspondent For Fox News Channel", "Fnc", "Based In Washington", "D.C.
