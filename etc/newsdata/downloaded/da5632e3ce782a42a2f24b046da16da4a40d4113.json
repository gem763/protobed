Deals and more deals", "language": "en", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nThe phrase shoppers most want to hear this holiday season is \"let's make a deal.'' And for many, the buying and bargains have already begun.\n\nFor some, the buying season actually begins on the heels of back-to-school, with 20% of shoppers saying they start ticking off their holiday lists in September or earlier, according to deal site RetailMeNot. And retailers were ready, with 61% saying in summertime surveys that their holiday deals would start popping up in September, up from 52% in 2018.\n\nTraditionally, the holiday shopping rush kicked off on Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving. But in recent years, sales have launched weeks earlier. Walmart just announced Wednesday that its holiday deals are starting this Friday, before Halloween has even cleared the calendar.\n\nAn early start may be particularly helpful since there are six fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving, which comes the last week of November this year, and Christmas.\n\nAmazon, which has transformed the overall retail landscape, is also having a specific impact on holiday shopping, with 28% of those surveyed by RetailMeNot saying they bought gifts during Amazon's Prime Day sale in July.\n\nWhat to expect at Walmart:Walmart kicks off holiday deals starting Friday\n\nThe holidays at Target:Target will offer free shipping, Disney shops\n\nIf you prefer to fill your cart with a tap or click, you'll be in good company this year. For the first time, shopping online will be the preference for a majority of holiday shoppers, with more than half, or 54%, saying they will do more holiday shopping via a smartphone or other device and 46% saying they will do more of their purchasing at a physical store, says consultancy PwC.\n\nStill, 90% intend to do at least some of their buying in person, says the International Council of Shopping Centers. And more than 60% say that a quest for bargains will get them through a store's doors more often.\n\nDespite the bargain hunting, spending is likely to be up this year. Shoppers will dole out $1,284 on average for presents, trips to visit loved ones and entertaining, PwC says, a 2.7% bump over 2018.\n\nThe National Retail Federation also expects holiday purchases to rise but has noted that economic uncertainty is the wild card that could dampen shoppers' enthusiasm.\n\nThe industry trade group forecast that sales should increase between 3.8% and 4.2% in November and December as compared to those months last year. That amounts to between roughly $728 billion and $730.7 billion in spending.\n\nEven at the low-end, that's higher than the 3.7% average seen during the previous five years. \u201cThe U.S. economy is continuing to grow and consumer spending is still the primary engine,\u201d NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay said in a statement announcing this year's predictions.\n\nBut questions loom about issues ranging from interest rates to international trade.\n\n\"There are many moving parts and lots of distractions that make predictions difficult,'' said NRF chief economist Jack Kleinhenz. \"There is significant economic unease, but current economic data and the recent momentum of the economy show that we can expect a much stronger holiday season than last year.''\n\nFollow Charisse Jones on Twitter @charissejones.", "description": "For holiday shoppers, the buying and bargains have already begun as retailers roll out sales and customers hunt for deals", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ad5ac72ad7133687d0f09dbcd9363c485b585139/c=0-0-400-225/local/-/media/2019/10/08/USATODAY/usatsports/holiday-gifts-e1508871182103.jpg?width=400&height=225&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
