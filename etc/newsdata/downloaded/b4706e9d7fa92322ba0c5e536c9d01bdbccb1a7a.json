The model that's on sale comes with an 8th-generation Intel Core i7 processor, along with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage \u2014 and that should make it more than powerful enough for the vast majority of use-cases. It's a relatively sleek and stylish laptop too, offering a minimalistic look that rivals even the likes of the MacBook. It's only 0.57 inches thick, and comes with a USB 3.0 port, a headphone jack, and a Mini DisplayPort.\n\nSurface Pro 6 [You save $500 to $600]\n\nThe Microsoft Surface Pro 6 is pretty powerful too, and it's even more portable.
