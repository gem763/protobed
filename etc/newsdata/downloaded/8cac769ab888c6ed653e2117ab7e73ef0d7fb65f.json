I know, I say this as the stock market struggles to decide whether it likes the prospect of lower interest rates, as the confusion continues over Brexit, as the trade war between the U.S. and China boils on, and as an election approaches that may very well have a \"corporate weary\" democratic candidate.\n\nBut, instead of fretting over those issues, you should streamline your approach and get back to the fundamentals: Focus on the actual performance of the businesses. These are the names that I'll be watching.\n\nTuesday\n\nNike\n\nNike (NKE) has provided stable revenue growth annually. While always profitable, Nike has seen a bit more volatility on the income side of things. Nonetheless, the juggernaut remains the king of sports apparel. Nike has been working hard on pressing its direct-to-consumer initiatives. Indeed, \"NIKE direct\" is the fastest growing portion of the business. In fiscal 2019 , sales to wholesalers grew 6% last year, while Nike direct sales increased 13% to $11.75 billion. For all intents and purposes, I think much of the focus moving forward will be on this segment. Many retailers have been struggling. That's no secret. And Nike may very well do better by taking the time to move its products itself, effectively cutting out the middle man. My question moving forward will be what long-term impact this has on margins.\n\nBlackberry Limited\n\nHaving suffered massive fallouts in revenue over the years, Blackberry (BB) has been recreating itself as a software company. A few quarters ago, we saw a surprisingly positive shift as a result of this focus on security software. With a few quarters of profitability, investors began to wonder whether Blackberry was really pulling it off. With actual equity on the balance sheet, and some growing relationships with automakers revolving around software integration, Blackberry might actually be onto something. I'm certainly not buying the shares, but there might be potential here.\n\nWednesday\n\nMicron Technology\n\nMicron (MU) has certainly a bit over chip-demand concerns, as well as the trade disputes with China. Overall, I really tend to not like tech or hardware companies. But the manner at which Micron shares have outpaced the S&P 500 over the past three years is impressive. The stock has recovered much of its pullback from last year, and is currently outpacing the market yet again.\n\nWith tensions so high over trade and manufacturing, Micron is trading at a very low valuation relative to earnings. I think investors are going to be very reactive to signs of true weakness. If earnings falter, the stock will likely follow. If we see an earnings beat, Micron could have some fireworks next week.\n\nCarnival Corporation", "description": "As Brexit, China trade and other big headlines continue, it's time to look at the fundamentals of Blackberry, Nike and others who report this week....NKE", "authors": ["Dave Butler", "Here Are Four Stocks To Watch Amid Turbulent Week In News", "As Brexit", "China Trade", "Other Big Headlines Continue", "It'S Time To Look At The Fundamentals Of Blackberry", "Nike", "Others Who Report This Week.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/acbcd2d0-b290-11e7-b31e-175b4d815ab8.png", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
