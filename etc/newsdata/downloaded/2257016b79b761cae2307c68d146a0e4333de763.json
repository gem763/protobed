I went to Sharon\u2019s [Osbourne] man for that \u2013 and she knows all the best surgeons. Then Simon got on about my hair.\n\n\u2018So I went to a lovely fellow who took some hair off the back of my head and put it on the top. So it\u2019s actually your own hair just put back in the right place.\n\n\u2018And then there\u2019s the teeth. I\u2019ve had my teeth whitened, but everybody does that now. And that\u2019s it.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLouis is making his third return to the judging panel of The X Factor, after previously leaving the show in both 2015 and 2018 respectively.\n\nThis time around, he admits he was not surprised that he was given the axe from the show initially, but is more than happy to be able to come back.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve had more comebacks than Frank Sinatra,\u2019 he joked.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018The first time I got a bit of a shock but I sort of knew it was coming. You have to keep changing things up. I\u2019ve been in this business all my life. I get it.\n\n\u2018Everything has a lifespan. Everything needs tweaking to keep it current. But it\u2019s good to be back. I love being back with Simon. There\u2019s something completely addictive about him.\u2019\n\nThe Irishman also says that he wants to be able to prove critics and viewers wrong with the celebrity format of the ITV singing competition, in which he will judge a lineup of celebrity talent alongside Simon and Nicole Scherzinger.\n\nAnd he promises that there will be some surprises in store.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He\u2019s [Simon] turned the whole thing on its head,\u2019 he added.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s upbeat, it\u2019s entertaining.
