The UK government may not wish to see such a vital symbol of UK financial services strength, and indeed a strategic asset, to be owned by foreigners; effectively it would hand it over to the Chinese through the Hong Kong back door.\n\n\"For the time being, at least the EU also has a say in this. The US will also be eyeing this very, very closely indeed and not liking much at all.\"\n\nA potted history: two years ago, competition authorities in Brussels scuppered the LSE's attempts to tie up with Deutsche Boerse, after a year of talks.\n\nThat was the third attempt by the two exchanges to merge after failed efforts in 2005 and 2000.\n\nAlong the way, it has had bids from the US exchange Nasdaq, private equity firm Macquarie and Swedish stock exchange OM. It tried to buy Liffe, London's futures exchange, but bought the Italian stock exchange in 2007.\n\nIt floated its shares on its own stock exchange in 2001, having demutualised after being owned by big financial firms.\n\nBefore that, in 1986 the LSE was subject to the \"Big Bang\", which marked the end of fixed commissions and the introduction of new technology.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"}
