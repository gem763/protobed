Rodriguez-Cruz is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence for the 2009 murder of his girlfriend, Pamela Butler, who was a federal worker in Washington, D.C.\n\nDuring a Friday press conference, Stafford County Commonwealth\u2019s Attorney Eric Olsen announced that the former military police officer, who was discharged after threatening to harm his female superior twice, has been charged with first-degree murder and the unlawful concealment of his wife\u2019s body, finally bringing a 30-year investigation to a close.\n\nCops: NYPD Officer Ordered Hit on Estranged Husband, Boyfriend\u2019s Kid\n\n\u201cThis is the ultimate act of domestic violence and it\u2019s noteworthy that in the month of October justice is going to be delivered for Marta Rodriguez,\u201d Olson said, pointing out that October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month.\n\nRodriguez was last seen on May 1, 1989, as she walked to a bus stop after leaving her job as a nurse\u2019s aide. Prosecutors allege Rodriguez-Cruz murdered his first wife shortly after she told police he had assaulted and kidnapped her\u2014but before she could testify against him in court.\n\n\u201cIf I can\u2019t have her, no one will,\u201d Rodriguez-Cruz once said, according to 2017 court documents.\n\nThe 28-year-old\u2019s body was found in 1991 on an Interstate 95 median but was not positively identified until last year.\n\nTwenty years after his wife\u2019s 1989 disappearance, Rodriguez-Cruz fatally strangled Butler, an Environmental Protection Agency analyst and his girlfriend of seven months, during a heated argument before hiding her body. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in 2017, at which point he confessed to killing the 47-year-old in her basement in 2009 before slipping her body out of a first-floor window.\n\nAir Force Major Charged With Murder After Missing Wife\u2019s Remains Found\n\nOne of Rodriguez-Cruz\u2019s friends told authorities that he once said it was \u201ceasy\u201d to get rid of a body because \u201cif you dig a hole deep enough, no one will find it,\u201d according to testimony at his plea hearing. As part of his plea deal, Rodriguez-Cruz told police he buried Butler in 2009 along Interstate 95\u2014where Rodriguez was found\u2014but her remains were never discovered.\n\nDerrick Butler, Pamela\u2019s brother, also attended Friday\u2019s news conference and told reporters he was relieved to hear news of Rodriguez-Cruz\u2019s latest charge.\n\nAuthorities believe his pattern of abuse stretches beyond the death of his two former lovers. In 2017, investigators testified that the 53-year-old told his second wife he knew how to make sure a body was never found. Another woman, a security guard at a federal office, also told detectives that Rodriguez-Cruz allegedly duct-taped her wrists, held a gun to her head, and sexually assaulted her in 2004.\n\n\u201cThis man doesn\u2019t impulsively kill. He abducts women, duct-tapes them, sexually assaults them, and then holds them captive,\u201d said Assistant U.S. Attorney Glenn Kirschner said at the 2017 hearing. \u201cDuct tape and a gun are his weapon of choice.\u201d\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\n\nGot a tip?
