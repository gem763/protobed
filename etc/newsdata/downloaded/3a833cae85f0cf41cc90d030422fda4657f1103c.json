The fact is, I didn\u2019t understand how hurtful this is to people who live with discrimination every single day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always acknowledged that I come from a place of privilege but now I need to acknowledge that that comes with a massive blindspot.\u201d\n\nA 2001 photo surfaced Wednesday night showing Trudeau wearing \u201cbrownface\u201d and a turban during an \u201cArabian Nights\u201d party at a private school in Vancouver where he was teaching at the time.\n\nTrudeau admitted to donning blackface a second time to sing Harry Belafonte\u2019s \u201cBanana Boat Song (Day O)\u201d during a high school talent show.\n\nAnd on Thursday, a third instance of Trudeau in blackface emerged.\n\n\u201cWe can confirm that it is him and it\u2019s from the early 1990s,\u201d said a Liberal Party spokesperson in a statement to CBC.\n\nTrudeau said he never mentioned the blackface flaps during a 2015 vetting process because he was embarrassed.\n\n\u201cI never talked about this. Quite frankly, I was embarrassed. It\u2019s not something that represents the person I\u2019ve become or the leader I try to be,\u201d he said.\n\nThe 47-year-old politician is seeking a second term in the Oct. 21 election.", "description": "Speaking to reporters in Winnipeg, Trudeau said he was \"deeply sorry\" for appearing in three images with the skin-darkening makeup.", "authors": ["September"], "top_image": "https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/justin-trudeau-3.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
