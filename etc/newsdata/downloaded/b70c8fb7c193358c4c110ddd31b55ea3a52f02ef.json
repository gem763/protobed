It's the same in rugby.\n\n\"If you look at the All Blacks' record, I don't think there is a team that comes close to them for sustainability. Since the last World Cup, I think they've won 90 percent of their tests. Name me another team in the world that plays at the absolute top level that wins 90 percent of their games.\"\n\nSaturday's semi-final between the All Blacks and England kicks off at 10:00 SA time.\n\nRead the FULL article on the RWC website", "description": "England coach Eddie Jones returns to his beloved cricket when explaining his attitude to rugby leading up to the semi-final with New Zealand.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9390/6d52446d33ac44c4b0e67be10d70cfb6.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
