Salazar is appealing the decision.\n\nDocuments released by the USADA show Parker was aware of experiments that the coach and doctor conducted on employees and athletes, and even Salazar\u2019s own sons, to test how supplements and medicine could enhance performance without breaking anti-doping rules. Parker said he never had any reason to believe the tests violated doping rules.\n\nHere are some questions and answers about the controversy and the possible implications for Nike, the world\u2019s largest sports apparel company.\n\nWHAT WAS PARKER\u2019S INVOLVEMENT?\n\nParker was briefed on Salazar\u2019s experiments, according to emails referenced in reports released by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. Dr. Jeffrey Brown, an endocrinologist who worked with the Nike Oregon Project, updated Parker on an experiment Salazar was conducting on his sons with testosterone gel. Parker showed keen interest in his response.\n\n\u201cIt will be interesting to determine the minimal amount of topical male hormone required to create a positive test,\u201d Parker wrote.\n\nParker was included in other email exchanges between Salazar and Brown about the experiments.\n\nHOW HAS NIKE RESPONDED?\n\nNike has vehemently defended both Salazar and Parker. The company has emphasized that none of the athletes in the Oregon Nike Project has tested positive for drugs. It has noted that the arbitration panel found Salazar never intended to violate doping rules, instead taking pains to comply with the world anti-doping code. The panel said Salazar made \u201cunintentional mistakes.\u201d\n\nIn an open letter to Nike employees, Parker said the tests on Salazar\u2019s sons were not done to figure out how to cheat but were part of a plan to prevent potential sabotage against Salazar\u2019s runners. Parker said that he wanted to understand what was going on.\n\n\u201cNike did not participate in any effort to systematically dope any runners ever; the very idea makes me sick,\u201d Parker wrote.\n\nWHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NIKE AND SALAZAR?", "description": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Nike CEO Mark Parker\u2019s involvement in a doping scandal that brought down renowned track coach Alberto Salazar raises questions", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/AP-Photo_Luca-Bruno-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
