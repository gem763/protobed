Some, however, point out that she simply may be making up for lost time.\n\nWENDY WILLIAMS TEARS UP DISCUSSING ESTRANGED HUSBAND KEVIN HUNTER\n\n\u201cPeople are concerned for [her] well-being especially after leaving Kevin, but it looks like the decision energized her in a lot of ways,\u201d a source close to the media mogul told Fox News. \u201cShe\u2019s having some fun of her own, and rightfully so since her ex-husband obviously did.\u201d\n\nWilliams and her ex, Kevin Hunter, were together for 25 years. They were married for 22 of them and share a son, Kevin Hunter Jr.\n\nOn Sunday, Williams stopped by \u201cWatch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen\u201d and revealed she\u2019s not just seeing one man \u2014 but several.\n\n\u201cI see many men,\u201d Williams stated when asked if she was still involved with the doctor she was seeing over the summer.\n\nWENDY WILLIAMS DISSOLVING HUNTER FOUNDATION FOLLOWING DIVORCE\n\nThe Williams insider said they have reservations surrounding the condition of the gossip queen\u2019s health because of what she\u2019s had to endure with Hunter\u2019s alleged infidelity and how he allegedly fathered a daughter while still married to the syndicated show host.\n\n\u201cYou just hope she\u2019s careful in the way she moves with these men,\u201d said the insider. \u201cBut Wendy is a grown woman and look, a lot of people who love and respect Wendy want to see her do well and want to see her healthy.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody wants to see Wendy in a downward spiral or a relapse, and a lot of people genuinely hope she can continue to live her life the best way she can,\" added the source.\n\nWilliams, whose talk show returns Monday for Season 12, canceled a number of dates on her \"For the Record... Umm Hmm!\" comedy tour due to the \"goal and purpose of the tour\" being \"sidelined by the headlines.\"\n\nHOWARD STERN APOLOGIZES FOR SLAMMING WENDY WILLIAMS\n\nA recurring guest on \u201cThe Wendy Williams Show\u201d echoed the sentiment of the insider, adding that their concern for the author and entrepreneur\u2019s well-being stems from Williams\u2019 history of drinking coupled with her ongoing battle with Graves\u2019 disease.\n\n\u201cWendy would frequently appear stressed when she\u2019d come into the studio for the show,\u201d said the frequent guest of Williams\u2019 physical condition during Season 11 of the show. \u201cYou could tell something was going on with her just by the way she looked in her eyes and in general.\u201d\n\nThe source went on to claim that Williams \"often looked as though she had been drinking heavily either the night before or early that morning [or] she maybe had a late night. I mean the establishments here don\u2019t close until 4 a.m. anyway, so who knows.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a former correspondent for the program joined Williams in slamming Hunter, who was credited on Williams' show as an executive producer despite never being in any of the production meetings, much less on the set.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201c[Hunter] was never in any of the preproduction meetings we had before the show and he basically had everyone ushered off of set the moment they were finished with Wendy,\u201d claimed the correspondent. \u201cThe rule was to never talk to Wendy if you saw her outside of showtime. I honestly don\u2019t know why he was given any credit for the show when he literally brought nothing to it.\u201d\n\nA rep for Williams did not respond to Fox News' request for comment.", "description": "Wendy Williams\u2019 recent behavior in her personal life is worrying some of her closest supporters.", "authors": ["Julius Young", "Julius Is An La Entertainment Reporter For Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/04/kevin-hunter-wendy-williams-display.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
