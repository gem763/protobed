The government\u2019s commitment to orthodoxy is impressive. The risk is that it freezes Alberta in time as the rest of the world moves on.\n\nThe province\u2019s budget is a tribute to the doctrine of low taxes and balanced budgets. Toews aims to erase a $9-billion shortfall in four years almost entirely by cutting spending, while implementing a big corporate tax cut and crossing his fingers that oil prices hold steady.\n\nAnd while the finance minister speaks more softly than his boss, he is no less dogmatic when it comes to airing regional grievances. Toews told reporters that he doubted there was a bridge or school \u201canywhere in Canada\u201d that \u201chasn\u2019t benefited from Alberta energy.\u201d He said he plans to agitate for changes to the equalization program so that it would come to the province\u2019s aid when times are tough.\n\nIf he\u2019s serious about doing a deal on equalization, he might want to stop behaving like a disgruntled benefactor, lest his counterparts point out how much aid could be generated by charging a sales tax.\n\nToews\u2019s budget is replete with examples of how Alberta\u2019s spending exceeds the average of Ontario, British Columbia, and Quebec, yet says nothing about how little revenue the province seeks to collect from the country\u2019s richest per-capita population. He did introduce a stealth increase by proposing to temporarily stop marking the basic income-tax deduction to inflation, but this would change little, as the finance department foresees taxes rising to 45 per cent of total revenue from 44 per cent currently.\n\n\u201cEven if program spending growth is dramatically cut, the government must find a new source of stable revenues,\u201d David Dodge, the former Bank of Canada governor, said in a report on provincial finances earlier this year published by Bennett Jones, the law firm where he now works as an adviser. \u201cA provincial GST could help fill the gap without harming Alberta\u2019s competitive position.\u201d\n\nAlberta\u2019s spending needed a trim to reflect the decline in oil royalties. Public debt charges surged 17 per cent between 2010 and 2018, according to Dodge and his co-author, Richard Dion. That was from a very low base, but still out of step with what was going on in the rest of the country. The second-biggest increase in public debt charges over that period was three per cent in Manitoba.\n\n\u201cTough economic times require tough policy decisions,\u201d said S\u00e9bastien Lavoie, chief economist at Laurentian Bank Securities. \u201cThe bottom line for bond investors is that the UCP government can restore Alberta\u2019s public finances, as long as the budget proposals are efficiently put into action.\u201d\n\nToews plans to drop the provincial tax on corporate income to eight per cent in 2022 from 11 per cent currently, restoring the \u201cAlberta advantage.\u201d The combined federal and provincial rate would be 23 per cent, compared with 27 per cent in British Columbia, 27 per cent in nearby Oregon, and 28 per cent in California. Assuming other jurisdictions resist the urge to race Alberta to the bottom, there will be only a few places in North America where companies pay lower rates on profits.\n\n\u201cThe weight of historical evidence overwhelmingly shows that when we improve our corporate tax advantage, our provincial (gross domestic product) goes up and our share of national GDP increases,\u201d Toews said in his budget speech.\n\nIf only it were so simple.\n\nThe budget matches the minister\u2019s confidence in the power of tax cuts, predicting economic growth of 2.7 per cent in 2020, much faster than the average forecast of nine private forecasters, which was 2.1 per cent. The technocrats appear less certain that lower rates will pay for themselves, however, stating that corporate-tax cut will provide companies a fillip of $4.7 billion, but at a \u201cnet fiscal cost\u201d of $2.4 billion.\n\nRelatively high-tax Quebec will lead the country in economic growth this year, according to Bank of Nova Scotia, a spot normally held in recent years by high-tax British Columbia. Confiscatory tax rates haven\u2019t stopped California and Oregon from become two of the wealthiest places on the planet. One thing all of those places have in common is booming technology industries. Alberta should be in their league, but it\u2019s not, mostly because it\u2019s waiting for a catalyst to bring all of its intellectual property, entrepreneurs and capital together.\n\nIt\u2019s not obvious that one of the lowest corporate rates in North America will do that. Toews scrapped five tax credits aimed at helping startups achieve scale. Purists will applaud that decision. However, a less doctrinaire finance minister might have left them in place to enable a shift away from oil. But Toews made clear this week that a balanced budget matters more than to him than diversifying the economy.\n\n\u201cReducing the corporate tax does not provide any financial advantage before you are profitable, which is true of most new ventures in the initial years,\u201d said Robert Price, founder of Calgary-based B\u014dde, a digital real-estate company. \u201cWhat is the bigger picture approach to successful economic diversification? The UCP tax change is short-term thinking.\u201d\n\nFinancial Post\n\n\u2022 Email: kcarmichael@nationalpost.com | Twitter: carmichaelkevin", "description": "Kevin Carmichael: Toews made clear this week that a balanced budget matters more than to him than diversifying the economy", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/toews.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
