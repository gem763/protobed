In Georgia, for instance, local election officials have claimed the closure of schools and fire houses across the state in predominantly rural areas is a result of an interest in reducing the burden on taxpayers to foot the bill for elections. In Texas, meanwhile, elected officials have conducted a statewide effort to centralise voting into so-called \"countywide polling places\", reducing the number of polling places but allowing voters to cast ballots at any location on election day.\n\nAmong the 13 states that saw major polling closures are at least three states of particular interest, including Arizona, Texas, and Georgia.\n\nTexas \u2014 which boasts a 39 per cent Latino population alongside 12 per cent African American population \u2014 leads the way among all states analysed, with at least 750 polling places closed since 2013, most in counties with heavy Latino populations. Over the past several years, the state has voted reliably in favour of Republicans, but demographic changes including a rise in the Hispanic population has led to some speculation that the state could become a competitive swing state within the next several elections.\n\nArizona, another state with a burgeoning Latino population at 30 per cent, has meanwhile been identified as having the most widespread polling closures, with 320 closures divided up across nearly every county. The county with the most closures, Maricopa County, saw 171 closures in a densely populated area with a 31 per cent Latino population. The state has also been considered reliably Republican, but saw a Democrat win statewide office for the first time in decades in 2018.\n\nIn Georgia, where Latinos make up 31 per cent of the population and African Americans make up 9 per cent, 214 polling places have been closed, and stands out with the highest percentage of closures among all states analysed in the study.\n\nThe state saw some counties close as many as 89 per cent of its polling places, including counties with large African American populations.
