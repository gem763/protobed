Or the people whose job it is to inform them are finding it very tough to do the work and bring those things to light,\" Mr Baker said.\n\n\"It turns that impression we have of our country and its freedoms on its head.\"\n\nThe Right to Know coalition highlighted more than 60 pieces of legislation passed in the last 20 years that have made it harder to report on issues of public interest in the national security realm and punished whistleblowers coming forward with information.\n\nAttorney-General Christian Porter agreed with Mr Morrison, saying some of the demands of the Right to Know Coalition were unrealistic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"There have been demands...that journalists have a blanket exemption from all national security and secrecy laws, or that journalists have a blanket exemption from laws relating to warrants on metadata,'' he said.\n\n\"I'm not so sure that those demands aren\u2019t sort of out on the outer edge of workability and credibility.\"\n\nHe said the best vehicle for making changes to FOI laws and others that were unnecessarily secretive was Parliament's Joint Intelligence and Security Committee.\n\n\"They're sensible things to be considered,'' he said.\n\nMr Porter said the raids on Ms Smethurst and ABC journalists Dan Oakes and Sam Clark \"and the determination as to who may or may not be charged and what the brief of evidence is, is always conducted at extreme arm's length from government by the AFP\".\n\nHe reiterated he would step in to prevent a prosecution of the journalists, should that be recommended.\n\n\"I would be seriously disinclined to consent to the prosecution of a journalist where they've done no more than pursue public interest journalism,'' he said.\n\nLabor leader Anthony Albanese said there should not be a question mark over whether Ms Smethurst and the ABC journalists would go to jail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"The government should shut that down,'' he said.\n\nMr Albanese said people should not be charged for doing their jobs.\n\n\"Journalism isn't a crime, it's an essential part of our democracy,'' he said.\n\nMr Morrison said no-one should be asking for a leave pass to be above the law.\n\nMr Albanese was also concerned about the culture of secrecy that dates back to laws made in World War I and prevent the disclosure of basic information.\n\nThe Right to Know coalition includes Australian Associated Press, the ABC, Australian Community Media, ASTRA, Bauer Media, Commercial Radio Australia, Community Broadcasting Association of Australia, Daily Mail, Free TV, the Media Entertainment & Arts Alliance, News Corp Australia, Nine, Prime Media, Seven West Media, Sky News, SBS, Ten, Guardian Australia and Win Network.", "description": "Newspaper front pages across Australia were censored on Monday as a coalition of media rivals intensify a campaign to remove laws criminalising\u00a0journalism and targeting whistleblowers.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.1576%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_16/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/3405c8f302e8897a998368e0808a52a335807c7c", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
