I was like, 'Yes! This is local!'\"\n\nMidway through the final chapter, she \"literally fist-pumped the air.\"\n\nSaint John writer and educator Karen McLean 'literally fist-pumped the air' when she realized the new Margaret Atwood bestseller she was reading is partially set in New Brunswick. (Julia Wright / CBC)\n\n\"The very end takes place on Campobello Island,\" McLean said. \"Campobello is where two of the main characters wind up at the end of the book.\"\n\nWithout revealing too much, the writer and educator said the island, which is part of Charlotte County and connected by bridge to Lubec, Maine, is portrayed in a \"positive\" way.\n\n\"Atwood is world-renowned,\" said McLean. \"To have our little corner of the world featured so positively, and so prominently, in such a blockbuster is exceptional.\"\n\nThe Testaments, like The Handmaid's Tale, is slated to be adapted for television by the streaming giant Hulu. (McClelland & Stewart)\n\n\"It's really exciting.\"\n\nIt's a big shout-out for a little island, which has a permanent population of just 850.\n\nThe Testaments made headlines earlier this month, when Amazon inadvertently leaked several hundred copies before its Sept.10 release date.\n\nThe novel has topped both Amazon's U.S. and Canadian bestseller lists, been short-listed for the U.K.'s Man Booker Prize, and long-listed for the Giller Prize.\n\nCampobello Island in the Bay of Fundy is where Margaret Atwood chose to conclude The Testaments, her highly anticipated sequel to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. 0:52\n\nThe plot picks up 15 years after the end of The Handmaid's Tale \u2014 Atwood's 1985 sci-fi novel set in the dystopian Republic of Gilead.\n\nIt's a \"lighter read\" than The Handmaid's Tale, according to McLean, narrated by three different women: Aunt Lydia, a main character from The Handmaid's Tale, Agnes, a young woman in Gilead, and a young Canadian woman named Daisy.\n\nKate Johnston, manager of marketing and visitor services at Roosevelt Campobello International Park, which preserves the summer home of late U.S. president Franklin D. Roosevelt and his family, called the literary salute \"pretty cool.\"\n\nAtwood, pictured at a press conference to promote The Testaments, 'has been pretty upfront about the fact that [her novels] are inspired by the events that have been happening in the United States,' said Kate Johnston, manager of marketing and visitor services at Roosevelt Campobello International Park. (Stephanie Jenzer/CBC)\n\nWhile she hasn't yet read the new book, \"I have read The Handmaid's Tale,\" she said.\n\n\"Margaret Atwood has been pretty upfront about the fact that she is inspired by the events that have been happening in the United States.\"\n\n\"Campobello is such an interesting place \u2014 so Canadian, but at the same time it has such a tie to the United States.\"\n\nMcLean said that in the context of the plot, Campobello Island is the \"perfect\" setting for the novel's conclusion.\n\nAn image released by Hulu shows Emmy Award-winning Elisabeth Moss as Offred in a scene from The Handmaid's Tale. (Hulu)\n\n\"It's definitely going to add awareness of our wonderful area,\" she said, adding that she's planning her first visit to Campobello Island after reading the book.\n\nPerhaps most exciting for fans of the hit TV series based on The Handmaid's Tale is that The Testaments is also being adapted into a television drama.\n\nNo word on whether the conclusion will be shot on Campobello, which seems to be having a bit of a media moment right now. On Tuesday, the Island was featured on the CBC show Still Standing with comedian Jonny Harris.\n\nThe Franklin Delano Roosevelt Bridge, which connects Campobello with Lubec, Maine, also plays a role in the conclusion of Atwood's new novel. You'll have to read the novel to find out exactly what that role is. (Julia Wright / CBC)\n\n\"I hope that anyone who enjoys The Handmaid's Tale or The Testaments will want to come and see Campobello,\" Johnston said.\n\n\"It obviously plays a big role in the Roosevelt history \u2014 and a big role in the history of international relations.\"", "description": "It was past midnight, and Saint Johner Karen McLean was burning through The Testaments\u00a0\u2014\u00a0Margaret Atwood's hotly-anticipated sequel to The Handmaid's Tale.\u00a0 Spoiler alert.", "authors": ["Information Morning Saint John Host", "Julia Wright Is A Lifelong Saint Johner", "The Host Of Information Morning Saint John.
