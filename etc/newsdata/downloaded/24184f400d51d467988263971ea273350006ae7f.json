Instead of perusing a display of isolated garments, attendees are now well accustomed to stepping into whole worlds curated for the purpose of showcasing clothes.\n\nTake the V&A\u2019s recent Christian Dior exhibition as one memorable example, where visitors walked right into the designer\u2019s 1950s atelier, or The Met\u2019s Savage Beauty, which invited viewers to see how it felt to watch one of Alexander McQueen\u2019s dramatic catwalk shows.\n\nThe new Tim Walker: Wonderful Things exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum takes this trope and amplifies it. Instead of stepping into a familiar world, one steps directly into the photographs themselves.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe V&A\u2019s latest blockbuster \u2013 following hot on the heels of its most successful exhibition to date, Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams \u2013 is the largest-ever exhibition of Walker\u2019s work. It features over 300 items including props, contact sheets, scrapbooks and short films.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Walker\u2019s work, now is the time go through the looking glass. A leading fashion photographer who rose to prominence in the 1990s, Walker has transcended the perfumed pages of Vogue during his quarter-century career. His work, at once otherworldly, surreal, humorous and at times even grotesque, probes right to the heart of the fashion and people it captures, referencing fairytales, literature and art. Indeed, the artistry of his images often eclipses the subjects themselves.\n\nThe exhibition opens in an unassuming manner; only the melting ceilings hint at the Wonderland to come. A bright white room is filled with over 100 of Walker\u2019s previous photographs, which serve as a taster of his oeuvre. Here we are reminded of Walker\u2019s portraiture \u2013 of the likes of David Attenborough, Timothee Chalamet, Riz Ahmed and Saroise Ronan among others \u2013 that probe right to the soul of its subject. Most haunting of all is his now infamous portrait of Alexander McQueen smoking while resting on a human skull with a lit cigarette perched between its teeth, shot a year before the designer took his own life.\n\nThen we\u2019re onto the main event: 10 rooms containing new projects, each one inspired by various artefacts from the V&A. Over the course of three years, Walker visited the V&A\u2019s numerous storerooms, met with curators and technicians, even scaled the roof of the museum and climbed through the Victorian passages underneath it, in search of the items that would inspire each series.\n\nFor curator Suzannah Brown, Wonderful Things was a lifelong dream: \u201cWhen I was interviewed for my job here in 2008, I was asked, \u2018If you could pick one photographer whose work to curate, who would it be?\u2019 Straight away, I said Tim. To finally have it happen is so exciting\u201d. But, she adds, it was \u201cimportant that we didn\u2019t just create another gorgeous retrospective\u2026 it needed to speak to the museum in a more pertinent way\u201d.\n\nTim Walker: Wonderful Things is no retrospective. It is an entirely new creation; an exhibition that is as much a celebration of Walker\u2019s photography as it is of the rich treasures within the institution that houses it.\n\nWalker\u2019s long-term collaborator, designer Shona Heath, created the exhibition\u2019s sets that bring each image to life, with each room you enter more fantastical than the one you just left. One gallery takes visitors inside a burnt-out cathedral cloister, in which 16th Century stained glass windows have inspired a series of striking photographs of Grace Jones. Another collection takes its cue from a 1600s embroidered casket made by a teenage girl: the gallery becomes a kitsch pink living room and images referencing London\u2019s gay clubbing scene cover the walls.\n\nA particularly enchanting collection, entitled \u201cHandle with Care\u201d, is inspired by the numerous conservationists at the museum, whose invisible but painstaking work takes centre-stage for the first time. Here, an haute couture dress from Alexander McQueen\u2019s 2009 Horn of Plenty collection is displayed, pouring out from beneath its protective dust wrap. Opposite, photographs show models in stiff poses climbing out from sturdy wooden storage boxes. This series is a \u201clove letter to conservators\u201d, says Walker. \u201cSeeing the dress by Alexander McQueen exquisitely wrapped up at the V&A Clothworkers\u2019 Centre, it became a beautiful ghost. I imagined the characters in this photograph as mannequins coming to life in the museum\u201d.\n\nThe photography exclusive to the exhibition is some of Walker\u2019s best work, free from commercial requirement or editorial interference. The images reveal the scope of the photographer\u2019s creative ability. \u201cTo me, the V&A has always been a palace of dreams\u2026 many of the objects that I saw during my research at the museum made my heart swell and I wanted to try to create a photograph that would relate not only to the physical presence and beauty of that object, but also to my emotional reaction to it,\u201d says Walker.\n\nRarely for an exhibition of this size, Walker\u2019s voice is more present than that of the curators (despite his careful celebrations of the latter). Visitors are led by his own words on labels that explain the thought process behind each shoot. It\u2019s an affectingly personal approach.\n\nThe press preview takes place on the final day of London Fashion Week \u2013 Anna Wintour is among attendees who have left the shows to come and see it \u2013 and a week after another fashion magazine ceases print publication. While it\u2019s difficult to imagine a space for the expensive and ambitious shoots of many fashion photographers finding a home in the precarious landscape of print publishing, when it comes to Walker\u2019s images, it feels doubtless that there will always be a place for them, wonderful as they are.\n\nTim Walker: Wonderful Things, curated by Susanna Brown and designed by Shona Heath, runs from 21 September 2019 to 8 March 2020 at the Victoria and Albert Museum.
