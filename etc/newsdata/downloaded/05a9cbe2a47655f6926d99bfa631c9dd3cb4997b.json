This is \u2013 potentially \u2013 your chance.\n\nMORE: Netflix horror movie Hush leaves viewers \u2018scared\u2019 and \u2018peeing their pants\u2019\n\nMORE: Easy ways to make your Halloween costume plastic-free\n\nMORE: Baileys just released red velvet liqueur\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "eCampus has created a three-year programme geared to equip students with the technical skills needed to gain traction on social media.", "authors": ["Serena Coady"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-944250592_1571419071.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
