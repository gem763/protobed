REUTERS/Christian Hartmann/Files\n\nBut gains were limited on lingering concerns of a global economic slowdown.\n\nGlobal benchmark Brent crude oil futures LCOc1 had risen 11 cents to $58.85 by 0103 GMT, up about 0.2% from the previous day\u2019s close. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 had gained 10 cents or 0.2% to $52.91 a barrel.\n\n\u201cOil is starting to see some bullish positions added on the easing of two big tail risks for global demand, the U.S.-China trade war and Brexit,\u201d said Edward Moya, a senior market analyst at OANDA in New York.\n\n\u201cWhile a broader trade deal seems unlikely in the immediate future, the risks for the U.S.-China trade war have been fading.\u201d\n\nLast-ditch talks between Britain and the European Union to get a Brexit deal ahead of a summit of the bloc\u2019s leaders this week ran past midnight to Wednesday, but it was still unclear if London could avoid postponing its departure, due on Oct. 31.\n\nAnalysts have said any deal that avoids a \u201chard\u201d or no-deal Brexit should boost economic growth and in turn oil growth and prices.\n\nProviding more support, OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allied producers \u201cwill do whatever (is) in its power\u201d to sustain oil market stability beyond 2020.\n\nOPEC, Russia and other producers have cut oil output by 1.2 million barrels per day to support the market. Yet an expected rise in U.S. crude inventories this week kept prices under pressure.\n\nStill, concerns of a global economic slowdown due to a lingering trade war between the United States and China and swelling U.S. inventories pressured prices.\n\nU.S. crude stocks probably grew for the fifth straight week, a preliminary Reuters poll showed.\n\nU.S. oil inventory reports are due out from industry group the American Petroleum Institute on Wednesday and the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Thursday.
