May said a pharmacare program is essential and could be funded by increasing corporate taxes.\n\nAll three leaders said they opposed Quebec's religious symbols ban, otherwise known at Bill 21, but none of them would step in to oppose the law.\n\nTonight's Maclean's/Citytv debate is the first of the federal election campaign, although Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau decided not to attend.\n\nMay has participated in federal leaders' debates before, but this is the first showing for Scheer and Singh, who are looking to woo voters with their campaign pitches.\n\nNDP campaign sources say Singh spent weeks preparing for the debate. He spent much of the past two days in mock debates with people standing in for Scheer and May.\n\nAt Wednesday's campaign event, Singh said he would focus on the man not in the room.\n\n\"[Canadians] expect that the prime minister should be able to stand up and respond to questions, hold up and defend his record,\" Singh told reporters. \"[Trudeau's] record is pretty abysmal, but that doesn't mean that he should give up on the debate.\"\n\nSpeaking directly to Canadians\n\nAccording to a Conservative source, Scheer's plan will be to get his message out directly to voters while using the occasion to warm up for the debates that will feature Trudeau.\n\nA second Conservative source told CBC News that Scheer's team recognizes their leader suffers from a name recognition problem and they hope to use tonight's debate to introduce the Conservative leader to voters who do not know him yet.\n\nScheer's team say that he will not be spending the evening attacking Singh and May, because voters do not respond well to attacks and a strong showing from the two leaders would work to split the vote on the progressive side of the political spectrum.\n\nRoad-testing arguments for Trudeau\n\nThe Conservative leader will, however, push back against climate change policy, including the carbon tax, a policy Scheer argues does not achieve its aims.\n\nMay spent Thursday in Toronto preparing for the debate. According to the Green's federal campaign director, Jonathan Dickie, May's team expected Scheer to use the occasion to road test climate change arguments he plans to use against Trudeau in future debates.\n\n\"It's an interesting opportunity without Trudeau there,\" said Dickie. \"The clear front-runner [tonight] is Scheer, so it's a clear opportunity to debate with Scheer without Trudeau there.\"", "description": "Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer challenged both Green Party Leader Elizabeth May and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh on how they will pay for a national pharmacare program at the\u00a0Maclean's/Citytv debate being held in Toronto tonight.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5280680.1568298062!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/election-campaign-may-singh-scheer-composite.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
