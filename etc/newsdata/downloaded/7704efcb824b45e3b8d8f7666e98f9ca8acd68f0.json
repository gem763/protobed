REUTERS/Kham\n\nA billion dong may only be around $43,000, but in the rural, northern-central Vietnamese town of Do Thanh, the money goes a long way, and even farmers live in palatial mansions, paid for with money sent back by family members working abroad.\n\n\u201c70-80% of the villas here have been built with remittances,\u201d said Nguyen Van Ha, chairman of the rural, rice-farming commune in Nghe An province.\n\n\u201cIf you work in Vietnam earning dong, it would take a long time to build a big house like this,\u201d Ha said, gesturing to the large, multi-storey villas flanking the town hall.\n\nIn Do Thanh, even the majestic, renaissance-style church towering over the plush, neighbouring villas was built with remittance money donated by the Catholic community.\n\nMany other victims are believed to come from outside the town, in the surrounding district of Yen Thanh. In the 1980s, Do Thanh used to be one of the district\u2019s poorest villages, according to state media.\n\nOne resident, 19-year-old Bui Thi Nhung, is thought by her family to be among the dead. She left a trail of messages on her social media account documenting her journey through Europe in the days before she boarded the fated vehicle.\n\nDeputy Foreign Minister Nguyen Quoc Cuong told Reuters on Tuesday the nationality of the victims had not been officially confirmed but that Vietnam and Britain were \u201ctrying to speed up identification of the bodies\u201d.\n\nThe grisly discovery last week on an industrial estate near London, a magnet for Vietnamese migrants, has shone a spotlight on people smugglers bringing the poor of Asia, Africa and the Middle East on perilous journeys to the West.\n\nIn Vietnam, poor job prospects, encouragement by authorities, smuggling gangs, environmental disasters and government pressure on Catholics are all factors pushing people to leave.\n\nREMITTANCE RISE\n\nBut even though the cost of getting to Europe can run into thousands of dollars for migrants ready to pay for a so-called \u201cVIP\u201d service, they believe they can make enough money to justify the risk.\n\n\u201cWe know that many residents of this district are living in Britain, but we have no idea what they do there to earn all this money to send back home,\u201d Ha said.\n\nOverseas workers sent nearly $16 billion in remittances to Vietnam in 2018, more than double the Southeast Asian country\u2019s trade surplus for the same period, according to World Bank data that showed remittances had risen 130% over the last decade.\n\nIn Nghe An and neighbouring Ha Tinh province, official policy supports the legal export of labour.\n\nNghe An province alone rakes in some $255 million annually from its overseas citizens, according to state media.\n\n\u201cThe remittance figures might be higher than reported as money transferred through unofficial ways, such as cash or as physical consumer goods, is not counted,\u201d said Nguyen Tri Hieu, a Hanoi-based economist and former government adviser.\n\nMany of the same networks which smuggle people also smuggle cash, in return for commission.\n\nWEED AND NAILS\n\nAbout 70 percent of Vietnamese trafficking cases in Britain between 2009 and 2016 were related to labour exploitation, with migrants lured into jobs growing cannabis illegally and working in nail salons, Britain said last year.\n\nBut many find legal work too, including in Europe, the United States and closer to home in Japan, Taiwan and neighbouring Laos.\n\nIn Nghe An, which borders Laos, GDP per capita stands at $1,636, well below Vietnam\u2019s national average of $2,540.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have enough money to go abroad so I went to Saigon instead,\u201d said Bui Van Diep, a welder, using the old name for Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nHe lives in a small shack in Do Thanh. His cousin, Bui Chung lives in a large, gleaming villa next door - with enough space leftover to park his jet black BMW.\n\nBui Chung left Do Thanh for Britain in 2007, and when he returned home he built his house and started a steel trading business.\n\n\u201cI went from Vietnam to France legally, but from France to the UK illegally inside a container truck,\u201d said Chung. \u201cI chose to go to the UK because the salary is very good and so many people from Do Thanh had already lived there.\u201d\n\nChung worked in a cannabis farm in Britain, and at a Vietnamese-run nail salon where he said he earned around 500 pounds ($640) a week.\n\n\u201cThe Vietnamese community living there help newcomers to find jobs,\u201d Chung said. \u201cThat\u2019s why many people around here are willing to even sell their land to raise enough money to go.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nNow, he believes he made a huge mistake returning home.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve lost a lot of money doing business here. People don\u2019t trust each other,\u201d he said. \u201cI might go back to the UK\u201d.\n\n($1 = 23,200.0000 dong)", "description": "Vietnam's \"Billionaire Village\" doesn't sound like a place people would want to leave, but at least three of the 39 victims found in the back of a lorry in Britain last week set off from there in search of their fortunes.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446500193&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T0RL", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
