But it has happened.\u201d\n\nAt the turn of the millennium, Cattermole, 42, was one-seventh of a famous whole. S Club 7 were presented to the world by impresario Simon Fuller \u2013 looking to repeat his success with the Spice Girls \u2013 as a fully formed pop package: four girls, three boys, singing, dancing, acting. (The \u201cS\u201d is rumoured to stand for \u201cSimon\u201d.)\n\nThe public got to know Jo O\u2019Meara, Bradley McIntosh, Hannah Spearritt, Jon Lee, Tina Barrett, Rachel Stevens and Cattermole playing versions of themselves on their CBBC series, Miami 7, about a British pop group trying to break America. \u201cThe Monkees for the next generation\u201d was one comparison.\n\nWhen the show\u2019s bouncy theme song, Bring It All Back, was released at the end of the season, it shot to No 1 in the UK. Between 1998 and 2002, the group scored three more No 1s \u2013 as well as hits in Europe, Australasia and the US \u2013 and recorded four albums. There were four more TV series and, in 2001, a spin-off group: S Club Juniors.\n\nPromotional press introduced the seven members, aged from 16 to 21: their roles, traits, favourite colours and foods. Bradley was cheeky; Hannah, hyper. Jon was the joker. Jo: raucous. Rachel: fiery. Tina: chatty. Cattermole? \u201cEnthusiastic.\u201d (And liked guacamole.) They were central to what was being bought and sold \u2013 often quite literally, as Hasbro dolls or in lyrics namechecking various brands. You might remember the G-funk jam S Club Party, my personal favourite, in which \u2013 as Tina did her dance and Jon looked for romance \u2013 Paul was getting down on the floor while Hannah screamed out for more.\n\nThough O\u2019Meara and McIntosh shouldered most of the singing, and Stevens seemed to have the most commercial potential, no one member was a standout star \u2013 their success was symbiotic, dependent on being a gang anyone could join.\n\nI was seven in 1998, and there really was no party like an S Club Party. \u201cThe style and energy that was portrayed was coming from us, entirely,\u201d Cattermole says. \u201cThere was no management in that. The actual thing that people were buying into came from us. And to see people get hundreds of millions of pounds, and all the credit \u2013 no. We created that sort of fun energy on our own, despite the pressure they put on us.\u201d\n\nCattermole had very nearly not joined S Club 7. \u201cI honestly was very unsure,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been asked so many times, \u2018Were you sitting by the phone, just waiting?\u2019 But when they did phone me up and offer it to me \u2013 \u2018Hi, we\u2019re so pleased to \u2026\u2019 \u2013 I remember putting the phone down and going: \u2018I don\u2019t know if I want to do that.\u2019 I turned to my friends and said: \u2018If I do this, my life is never going to be the same again.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs a teenager in St Albans, Hertfordshire, he had dreams of making it with his rock covers band or as a character actor. Performing came naturally, he says.\n\nOther members of S Club 7 had been chosen from thousands of applicants at \u201ccattle calls\u201d, what we think of today as X Factor-style; Cattermole never even auditioned. Once in the group, he never had to sing. \u201cThat got me down.\u201d\n\nHe was told it would be at odds with \u201cthe alchemy\u201d, he says sarcastically, imitating a showbiz suit: \u201c\u2018We have picked certain people to do certain roles.\u2019 I can only assume that mine was to answer questions in interviews. I was never asked to show, in the audition process, my singing, my ability to dance \u2013 my ability for anything, other than talking.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jo O\u2019Meara, Paul Cattermole, Bradley McIntosh, Hannah Spearritt, Tina Barrett, Rachel Stevens, Jon Lee in 2001.

Ask me about the theory of relativity!\u201d (Those bios from 1998 did say that his favourite subject at school was physics.)\n\nCattermole paints pop stardom as a boring, thankless existence: a lot of \u201cschmoozing at parties\u201d and being driven around in the back of Chryslers, looking at magazines. \u201cI\u2019m as down for flicking through Heat magazine as the next one: \u2018Ooh, yeah, look at those shoes.\u2019 But not day after day, hour after hour.\u201d\n\nThe perks of plush restaurants and hotels wore off \u201cimmediately\u201d \u2013 not that there was much of that. \u201cWe did everything ourselves, as far as I can remember, from laundry to food preparation.\u201d\n\nAnd mostly to make other people money. Cattermole says that Fuller was signed to Polydor as S Club 7, while he and the other six were just affiliates: \u201cthe worst situation to be in.\u201d He remembers being unable to afford a \u00a3100 bottle of wine even as he was in \u201cone of the world\u2019s biggest pop groups\u201d, and seizes on my mention of the Hasbro dolls: \u201cWe got a pittance for that.\u201d\n\nBut they had each other. Cattermole says he got on with McIntosh (his closest friend) and Lee and Spearritt (\u201cthe nucleus\u201d of the group) in particular. \u201cWe were closer than many pop groups \u2013 people that used to work with us said: \u2018Wow, you guys actually speak, you actually stay in the same room.\u2019 Most of them don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIn March 2002, Cattermole announced that he was leaving S Club 7, ostensibly to pursue his old band, now named Skua and doing nu-metal. \u201cIt had got to the point where things were being handled so badly, I had to go.\u201d\n\nS Club 7 were riding high with their second Brit award for Don\u2019t Stop Movin\u2019, named Best British Single and the seventh-bestselling single of 2001. It was a new, more sophisticated sound for the group, more Billie Jean than bubblegum (in fact Michael Jackson was given a co-writing credit). S Club 7 had never not been successful, but this was the first time they had come close to having street cred. Then they were told the follow-up single would be You, which was saccharine by even their own standards, drawing more from golden oldies than the then-current trend for two-step and garage.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Cattermole on Loose Women in 2018. Photograph: Ken McKay/ITV/Rex\n\nThe group argued for a song to cement their new contemporary sound, one that would be \u201cjust a little bit of a move away from stuff for eight-year-old kids,\u201d as Cattermole puts it \u2013 but were shot down. \u201cWe had absolutely busted our butts off to get the band where it was. The band never disliked You, but it was just like: \u2018Wait a minute, we\u2019re just making this crossover \u2013 we have wanted this for years. We have wanted to be perceived as cool since the very beginning, and you\u2019ve given it to us, but then you\u2019ve taken it away.\u201d\n\nNo one in the group resented him for leaving \u2013 but no one asked him to stay. He would have stayed, he says. \u201cI don\u2019t mind admitting, I was upset.\u201d The years that followed were difficult. Skua was stop-start and never signed to a record label. In hindsight, Cattermole says, he wasn\u2019t up to being in the public eye \u2013 but taking a break didn\u2019t seem possible. S Club, as the group was known post-Cattermole, hung on for one more year, announcing their split on stage in April 2003.\n\nFor all the No 1s, the world tours, the multi-million-pound merchandising and endorsement deals \u2013 including one with Pepsi \u2013 S Club 7 saw very little of their success in monetary terms. Cattermole, O\u2019Meara and McIntosh formed S Club 3 in 2008; a rotating lineup from the group continues to perform, including Spearritt for the first time last month.\n\nThe extent of Cattermole\u2019s money troubles came to light last year after he was found to be selling his Brit award on eBay for a reported \u00a360,000. In an appearance on Loose Women that some criticised as exploitative, Cattermole said that he owed some \u00a330,000 in taxes and more in legal fees. His share from the 2015 S Club 7 reunion tour went towards clearing his debts.\n\nExplosively, Cattermole tells me that his five-year relationship with Spearritt was written into their Hollywood 7 TV show \u2013 \u201cand because of that, it sort of happened\u201d. Reports at the time said they had been secretly dating for six months, necessitating their on-screen kiss, but Cattermole says that was not the case \u2013 it did not happen organically.\n\nHe was forced into the relationship? \u201cYeah, but like I say. It didn\u2019t feel like that because I had totally grown into the idea, quite quickly. I thought she was great.\u201d In 2017, Spearritt lashed out at Cattermole online for speaking publicly about their relationship.\n\nFor the past year and a half Cattermole has lived in Swanage, in Dorset, where his family are based; he has been working odd jobs, most recently as manager of a community radio station. This Thursday he makes a heartwarming appearance on Channel 4\u2019s First Dates Hotel, where he grapples with how to disclose to his date his background as \u201can entertainer\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt was five years of my life,\u201d he says. \u201cI definitely thought, when I was 20, that by the time I was 40 it would be a done thing. And it\u2019s not \u2026 I\u2019ve been answering S Club questions for 20 years. It will be great \u2013 it will be bliss \u2013 to one day not have to, but it\u2019s part of it, and I totally accept that.\u201d\n\nIn July, Stevens teased a reunion on the Lorraine Kelly show to mark the 20th anniversary of their debut album but Cattermole seems to think it unlikely. \u201cThe other guys know I\u2019m up for doing it, but I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nA manager had approached him about it but was \u201crude and offensive\u201d \u2013 typical, he says, of his experience of the industry. \u201cIt\u2019s such a shame that the whole thing has been crushed and crushed and crushed \u2026 I\u2019ve been in meetings and they\u2019ve said, \u2018No but Paul, legacy, legacy, legacy, you\u2019ve got to do the gig because it\u2019s the legacy.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe music\u2019s there, the TV shows are there \u2013 that\u2019s the legacy.\u201d He still gets approached by fans wanting a selfie, who say that S Club 7 helped them through a difficult period in their lives or their GCSEs. \u201cThat is nine times out of 10 the way it goes.\u201d\n\nIt is hard to think of any contemporary music, or even culture, that is as wholeheartedly upbeat. As we\u2019re wrapping up, I tell Cattermole that I still associate their music with the optimism of the millennium. He leaps on the word.\n\n\u201cIt is so important to remember how great so many things about the band were and, like you said, that time in people\u2019s lives. That optimistic time.\u201d\n\nPaul Cattermole is on First Dates Hotel on Thursday 12 September on Channel 4.", "description": "Paul Cattermole found stardom with 90s pop kids S Club 7, but says being in the band brought him only pain and poverty", "authors": ["Elle Hunt"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e1103e93280e33c08134f910288350995e4f973/0_1105_5344_3206/master/5344.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=2873c9409f3b9f5ce021b753803d4a80", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
