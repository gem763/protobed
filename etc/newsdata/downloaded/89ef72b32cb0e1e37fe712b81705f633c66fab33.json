Google Translate helped me ask basic questions in the local language, while Google\u2019s search engine helped me research restaurants. All of that was free.\n\nMy phone company, however, charged me $10 per day for the international service I needed to access Google.\n\nNobody is accusing the phone company of gouging consumers or engaging in anticompetitive behavior. But politicians are swarming Google, with attorneys general for 50 states and territories announcing an antitrust investigation of the tech giant on Sept. 9. The state AGs will look into Google\u2019s dominance of advertising on the Internet, and probe whether it keeps other players out of the business.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who\u2019s running for president, wants to break up Google, along with Amazon and Facebook. She complains that Google has built too thorough a business by acquiring mapping service Waze, thermostat maker Nest and ad firm DoubleClick. She\u2019d force the company to sell off its core search business and then regulate it like a heavily governed utility.\n\nMissouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt in Washington, DC after after a news conference to announce an antitrust probe into Alphabet's Google on Sept. 9, 2019. REUTERS/Bryan Pietsch More\n\nPresident Trump hates Google because he feels, without evidence, that it besmirches conservative politicians like himself through skewed search results. The highly politicized antitrust division of Trump\u2019s Justice Department is now investigating the firm, on top of the other investigations. Shares of Alphabet (GOOGL), Google\u2019s parent firm, are down nearly 8% since April 29, when antitrust rumors began to pick up steam.\n\nA brand consumers love\n\nIf Google is an abusive monopoly, then we need more abusive monopolies! Consumers clearly love being ripped off by Google, ranking it consistently near the top among consumer brands. Google ranks second among Morning Consult\u2019s most-loved brands, for instance. And it ranks third out of nearly 900 companies on Just Capital\u2019s index of \u201cmost just\u201d companies.\n\nConsumers don\u2019t seem to have a problem with Google\u2019s business model, but regulators sure do. Google offers free services because it gets user data in return for those services. The firm uses that data to target ads based on users\u2019 interests, which is a juggernaut business that has made Google a powerhouse.\n\nIf Google or any online firm abuses uses data, it should pay a price. And it has. Federal and state regulators recently fined Google $107 million for improperly tracking kids\u2019 activity on the Internet. Earlier this year, European authorities fined Google $57 million for not properly disclosing how it organizes user data.\n\nRegulators also need to update their own laws and rules to better reflect the realities of the digital economy. The laws governing hostile speech on the Internet, for instance, went into effect during the Internet\u2019s early days, way before social media networks gave haters a public forum for posting noxious content. That needs to be updated.\n\nTurning a search engine into a utility\n\nBut if you\u2019re a politician or regulator who earnestly wants to deploy limited resources to help consumers the most, attacking Google shouldn\u2019t even make the list. The Just Capital rankings actually provide some choice hints about the worst companies in America. Equifax, Fifth Third Bancorp, Marathon Petroleum, Western Union and Wells Fargo are lowest-rated for treatment of customers. For treatment of workers, the worst scores go to Dollar Tree, Dollar General, Flowers Foods, the Extended Stay hotel chain and Amerco, a retailer.", "description": "Consumers love Google.
