Cash in the back pocket already.\n\nFor the bulk of my time behind the wheel at the official international launch this week, I was at the chunky steering wheel of the sporty Focus ST-Line variant, in a fetching shade called Desert Island Blue.\n\nIt is powered by a lean three-cylinder 1.5-litre EcoBoost petrol engine that develops a meaty 182 horsepower, linked to a pretty slick six-speed manual gearbox.\n\nWithin a matter of minutes at the controls I soon realised that this modest hatch is something a little special.\n\nRay took to the wheel of the \u00a321,570 Ford Focus ST-Line car and was mightily impressed with the full package\n\nFlip the car into 'sport' mode and it feels more engaging to drive than sports cars worth five times as much\n\nAs well as being utterly brilliant to drive, the new Focus is pretty nice to look at. Built in Germany, the purposeful looks should make you reconsider the country's native brands\n\nPopping it into \u2018sport\u2019 mode for a stint along the winding mountain roads in the South of France near Nice, it performed well beyond my expectations.\n\nIn fact, in recent months I've driven a variety of sports cars worth five times as much that haven't come close to feeling as engaging as Ford's do-it-all family favourite.\n\nThink of it as a vehicle for all endeavors: perfect for the school run, a shopping expedition, a family holiday or just having a bit of driving fun.\n\nThere was an almost rally-car feel to the handling and a satisfying exhaust note as I revved up out of some tight hairpin bends and roared down long straight stretches of tarmac.\n\nWhen it comes to negotiating corners, the sports-tuned suspension and 10mm lower ride height mean it\u2019s all in sharp Focus, not soft Focus.\n\nThat's not to say it will rattle your bones out of their joints.\n\nIt provides a satisfyingly comfortably ride in the standard drive setting, while \u2018eco\u2019 helps save on fuel economy too.\n\nThat's because there\u2019s a really clever twist to the lean and mean - and green - petrol engine.\n\nThe 2018 Ford Focus is on sale now in both hatch and estate variants. A jacked-up Active crossover is due in 2019\n\nThe Ford Focus has become a tour-de-force for technology. The new-for-2018 car even has a feature that scans the road ahead to prepare for potholes\n\nThe 1.5-litre petrol engine is the first 3-cylinder motor to have an active cylinder shut-down feature. When you're cruising through two, the middle cylinder deactivates to save fuel and reduce the emissions from the double oval exhaust outlets\n\nWhen you\u2019re driving hard and mashing the throttle with your right foot, the full trio of cylinders are in play. But when you are cruising it will shut-down the middle cylinder to use less fuel and produce fewer emissions.\n\nIt\u2019s the first cylinder de-activation system to be used on a three-cylinder car engine and it flicks back and forth seamlessly and smoothly in just 14 milliseconds \u2013 20 times faster than the blink of an eye.\n\n2018 Ford Focus hatchback: Will it fit in my garage? Price: From \u00a317,930 to \u00a327,910 Doors: 5 On sale: now First deliveries: August/September Length: 4378mm Width: 1825 (without mirrors) Height: 1454mm Gears: 6-speed manual/ 8-speed automatic Wheels: 16, 17 and 18 inch Engines: Petrol: 1.0 litre Ecoboost (from 107g/km) 1.5 litre EcoBoost (from 122g/km) Diesel: 1.5 litre EcoBlue (from 92g/km) 2.0litre EcoBlue (from 112g/km) Top speed (1.0 litre petrol): 124mph 0-62mph (1.0 litre petrol): 10 seconds Average MPG (1.0 litre petrol): Up to 60.1mpg Average MPG (1.5 litre diesel): Up to 80.7mpg Other UK body-styles: Now: Estate.

Take your hands of the wheel for a few seconds and you get a warning to put them back on.\n\nWhat's even better is the new technology designed to cope with Britain\u2019s increasingly potholed roads.\n\nUsing sensors mounted at the front of the car that sweep the tarmac ahead every two milliseconds, it hunts out craters in the road so it can automatically adjust the suspension, steering and braking to reduce the impact of pounding through crumbled cavities.\n\nCome to think of it, this sub-\u00a320,000 hatchback is something of a technology tour de force.\n\nIt also has \u2018evasive steering assist\u2019 which automatically steers around other vehicles to avoid collisions, speed-sign recognition, adaptive cruise control, stop-start and enhanced automated parking assistance.\n\nA mobile wi-fi hotspot has connectivity for up to 10 devices, a new Bang & Olufsen 10-speaker sound system that plays your music via your smartphone, and a new app to help owners find their cars in sprawling car parks.\n\nMine also had Ford\u2019s first head-up display, which is incredibly useful for keeping your eye on speed limits and sat-nav directions, without having to avert your eyes from the windscreen and the road ahead.\n\nAs for practicalities, there was plenty of boot space for luggage with a hands-free tailgate that can be opened by performing a kicking motion beneath the rear bumper.\n\nThere\u2019s more leg room, knee clearance and shoulder room thanks to more efficient use of space, and the seats themselves are comforting and supportive for long treks.\n\nIf you need more space and load-lugging capability, the standard five-door hatchback Focus is joined by an even more practical estate model that has room for a dog crate - both on sale now for delivery this autumn.\n\nThe expanded Focus line up also includes the first ever higher riding and rugged Focus Active crossover \u2013 available from next year - and an upmarket more luxurious Vignale version, which should appeal to those who might be thinking about placing a deposit on the latest Audi A3 or Mercedes A-Class.\n\nA four-door saloon version won\u2019t be sold in Britain.\n\nThe 1.5-litre diesel engine provides fewer thrills... I also had a quick blast in a test car with the 1.5-litre diesel EcoBlue engine en route back to Nice airport. This more humble motor produces just 120 horsepower but has plenty of bottom-end grunt. It promises an average return of 65.7 miles per gallon - rising to 70.6mpg when cruising - and emits CO2 emissions of 113g/km. That puts it in VED-band G with a low first year road tax charge of \u00a3205. After the delights of the sporty petrol I'd been enjoying previously on the launch, this was initially a little underwhelmed. It felt comparatively noisy and lacked the bite of the other engine. But I soon forgave it when the return journey included a prolonged stint on the motorway. This is where the diesel motor is in its element, with the smooth power delivery ideal for gulping arduous miles without a fuss. This second test car also came equipped with the new eight-speed automatic transmission. It's easy to set using the rotary button placed in the centre console and moves up and down the 'box so seamlessly that it gear changes will come and go completely undetected.\n\nThe Ford Focus interior has been de-cluttered and fitted with a new 8-inch touchscreen and \u2018sophisticated jewellery elements\u2019 to make it feel upmarket\n\n\u2039 Slide me \u203a While the boot isn't the biggest in class, it's big enough to fit a couple of suitcases. There's a hands-free opening system function too, which operates when you dangle your foot under the rear bumper\n\nIf the hatchback isn't practical enough for you, the Ford Focus Estate might be a better option...\n\nHowever, we don't think it looks quite as good as the hatchback, with the elongated body creating a bulbous silhouette\n\nInside, the cabin has been decluttered and simplified to create a more calming and higher quality atmosphere with soft-touch materials, polished glass, brushed finishes, and \u2018sophisticated jewellery elements\u2019 designed to catch the eye and delight the senses.\n\nIn recent months I've driven sports cars worth five times as much that haven't come close to feeling as engaging as Ford's do-it-all family favourite Ray Massey\n\nThere's also an eight-inch dashboard colour touchscreen with can be operated with pinch and swipe gestures.\n\nThe choice of engines encompasses a 1.0-litre EcoBoost motor delivering CO2 emissions from 108 grams per kilometre with the 1.5-litre EcoBoost managing 120g/km.\n\nFord\u2019s advanced new turbocharged 1.5-litre EcoBlue diesel promises emissions from 94g/km, with the 2.0-litre 150 horse-power EcoBlue engine managing 110g/km.\n\nThe UK is Ford\u2019s biggest market in Europe and last year sold 70,000 Focus cars \u2013 a third of the 210,000 European total. This makes it the UK\u2019s third-best-selling car after the Ford Fiesta and the Volkswagen Golf - the latter of which it will hope to - and, on first impressions, should - overtake.", "description": "It\u2019s only when you climb inside Ford\u2019s new Focus hatchback and drive it that you realise what a cracking family car this really is.
