I don't even tell people that. It was great, I really can see very well.'\n\nThe host then quizzed her: 'Do they give you painkillers or laughing gas?'\n\nConfused, Taylor said: 'They definitely give you some pretty hardcore pills after you have a laser in your eye. What is going on? What's happening right now?'\n\nSurprise world premiere: In the clip, the ME! singer can be seen fumbling with a bunch of bananas while wearing a brown puppy face sweater and a protective plastic shield over her eyes\n\nGoing bananas: 'The wasn't the one I wanted,' Taylor pouts before ripping off another banana\n\nThe blonde beauty looked horrified when the 'Tonight Show' host revealed the source of his knowledge - her mother Alison.\n\nHe said: 'Your mum may or may not have video taped you after surgery and she gave us the video.'\n\nTaylor exclaimed: 'For the television?' as the host explained: 'This is the world premiere. Check this out. This is Taylor Swift, post-surgery. You were, like, freaking out over a banana.'\n\nNext move: Her mom helps her rip off the 'right' banana and then Swift puzzles: 'What do we do with this one now?\n\nIn the clip, a drugged up Swift can be seen fumbling with a bunch of bananas while wearing a brown puppy face sweater and a protective plastic shield over her eyes.\n\nThe hilarious clip showed Taylor getting upset as she tried to take a piece of fruit for a snack while her mother warned her not to cry.\n\nShe snapped off a banana from the bunch then said: 'That wasn't the one I wanted...I tried to get this one.\n\nHer mom helps her rip off the 'right' banana and then Swift puzzles: 'What do we do with this one now? It doesn't have a head. OK, I'm fine, fine.'\n\nThis s*** is bananas: Banana in hand, Swift is then escorted back to her bed so she can get some rest.\n\nResting: Later, Swift can be seen laying in bed comically munching on her treat\n\n'I'll eat it. I'll eat it. It's mine,' Mama Swift answers, with the Blank Space singer whining: 'But it doesn't have a head!' .\n\nBanana in hand, Swift is then escorted back to her bed so she can get some rest.\n\nThe camera then cut to the ME! hitmaker eating her banana while lying down and her mother warning her not to fall asleep while eating.\n\n'Don't fall asleep eating your banana, ok?' Swifts mom says, to which Taylor mutters: 'I'm not asleep. My mind is alive.'\n\nWide awake! 'Don't fall asleep eating your banana, ok?' Swifts mom says\n\nOne liners: 'I'm not asleep. My mind is alive,' Taylor responds\n\nAs the show cut back to the studio, Jimmy urged his guest not to be 'mad' at him, but Taylor admitted she'd be having words with her mother when she got home.\n\n'Don't be mad at me. I may have made some calls,' Fallon says to a shocked Swift when the clip ends.\n\nShe exclaimed: 'Oh my God! That's on television. She was kind enough to drive me there but cruel enough to give it to you.\n\nSurprise! 'Don't be mad at me. I may have made some calls,' Fallon says to a shocked Swift when the clip ends\n\nRelatably embarrassing: 'That's on television?' the Lover singer asks in shock after the video rolls\n\n'I had these goggles on, which are really high fashion, and then they had to tape them to my head. I was crying I think, over a banana. Oh my gosh. I'm gonna tell her something.'\n\nShe also revealed her favorite song on the program during a game called Name That Song Challenge.\n\nThey took turns naming songs played by house band The Roots and Taylor correctly answered Baby One More Time by Britney Spears and Jimmy rightly guessed the next song was Pour Some Sugar On Me by Def Leppard.\n\nFavorite song: Taylor revealed her favorite song Thursday while playing a game on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\n\nTaylor then beat Jimmy to the punch on the next song after just a few beats.\n\n'It's Nelly. It's Nelly. It's Nelly. It's 'Hot In Herre'. This is my favorite song,' Taylor revealed as she danced to the 2002 tune.\n\n'How did you guess that from that?,' Jimmy asked.\n\n'Just like, middle school imprints on you,' Taylor said.\n\nGame time: The 29-year-old pop star faced off against Jimmy, 45, in a game called Name That Song Challenge\n\nQuick answer: Taylor after just a few beats correctly guessed The Roots were playing her favorite song Hot In Herre by Nelly\n\nShe also correctly guessed the 1997 song Kiss Me by Sixpence None The Richer and revealed it was the first song she learned to play on guitar.\n\nTaylor received a standing ovation when she later stepped out for her interview.\n\nShe was promoting her upcoming appearance as musical guest this weekend on Saturday Night Live.\n\nMusical guest: The singer was promoting her upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live\n\nTaylor also spoke about her upcoming Lover Fest tour in the summer of 2020 in support of her new hit album Lover.\n\nShe has seven shows planned in Europe, one in Brazil and two shows at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles as part of the Lover Fest West and two shows at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts as part of Lover Fest East.\n\n'Basically, I just kind of felt like this album, I was going to try something new.
