North Korea is also known as the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK).\n\nShe said the U.S. delegation had previewed a number of new initiatives that would pave the way for progress in the talks, and underscored the importance of more intensive engagement to solve the many issues dividing both sides.\n\nRelated Coverage U.S.'s Pompeo says hopes for progress in talks with North Korea\n\n\u201cThe United States and the DPRK will not overcome a legacy of 70 years of war and hostility on the Korean Peninsula through the course of a single Saturday. These are weighty issues, and they require a strong commitment by both countries. The United States has that commitment,\u201d she said.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s Kim downplayed the U.S. gestures.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. raised expectations by offering suggestions like a flexible approach, new method and creative solutions, but they have disappointed us greatly and dampened our enthusiasm for negotiation by bringing nothing to the negotiation table,\u201d he said.\n\nSwedish broadcaster TV4 reported that the U.S. Special Representative for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, who led the U.S. team, had arrived back at the country\u2019s embassy in central Stockholm.\n\nThe Swedish foreign office declined to give any details on the invitation for new talks, or whether Pyongyang had accepted.\n\nThe meeting at an isolated conference centre on the outskirts of Stockholm was the first formal working-level discussion since U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met in June and agreed to restart negotiations that stalled after a failed summit in Vietnam in February.\n\nA motorcade carrying North Korean delegation heads for Villa Elfvik on the island of Lidingo off Stockholm, Sweden, October 5, 2019. REUTERS/Anna Ringstrom\n\nSince June, U.S. officials had struggled to persuade North Korea to return to the table, but that appeared to change this week when North Korea abruptly announced it had agreed to hold talks.\n\nOn Saturday evening, negotiator Kim Myong Gil accused the United States of having no intention of solving the countries\u2019 difficulties through dialogue, but said a complete denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula was still possible.\n\nHe said it would only happen \u201cwhen all the obstacles that threaten our safety and check our development are removed completely without a shadow of doubt,\u201d an apparent reference to North Korea\u2019s desire to see Washington ease economic pressure on it.\n\nTENSIONS\n\nThe delegation from North Korea, which is under sanctions banning much of its trade due to its nuclear programme, arrived in Sweden on Thursday.\n\nAnalysts have said the leaders of both countries faced growing incentives to reach a deal, although it was unclear whether common ground could be found after months of tension and deadlock.\n\nJenny Town, a managing editor at 38 North, a Washington-based North Korea project, said the readout from the talks did not sound very promising.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\n\u201cI think (North Korea\u2019s) expectations were too high that the removal of Bolton would provide more flexibility on what the U.S. wants as initial steps,\u201d said Town. \u201cWhile certainly it removes some pressure for an all or nothing deal, it seems the gap between what the two sides want as a baseline and are willing to reciprocate still has not narrowed.\u201d\n\nOnly a day after announcing the new talks, North Korea said it had test-fired a new ballistic missile designed for submarine launch, a provocative gesture that also underscored the need for Washington to move quickly to negotiate limits on Pyongyang\u2019s growing arsenal.\n\nSpeaking in Athens on the last leg of a tour of southern Europe while the talks were still underway in Stockholm, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had said he was hopeful of progress in the talks.\n\n\u201cWe are mindful this will be the first time that we\u2019ve had a chance to have a discussion in quite some time and that there remains to be a lot of work that will have to be done by the two teams,\u201d he told a news conference.", "description": "North Korea's top negotiator said late on Saturday that working-level nuclear talks in Sweden between officials from Pyongyang and Washington had broken off, dashing prospects for an end to months of stalemate.", "authors": ["Johan Ahlander", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191005&t=2&i=1437471131&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9406W", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
