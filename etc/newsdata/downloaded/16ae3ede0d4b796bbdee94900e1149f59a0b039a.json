After their draw at Manchester United a week earlier, Liverpool were in danger of losing a little here and maybe that is what made Mo Salah\u2019s 50th goal at Anfield feel so incredibly important.\n\nWhen the Egyptian placed the ball on the penalty spot at the Kop end with 16 minutes left, it felt like a significant moment. Manchester City will certainly have felt that. They are due to play Liverpool in two Sunday\u2019s time.\n\nFor much of the afternoon, Tottenham goalkeeper Paulo Gazzaniga had been magnificent. Agile and secure, the Argentinean had been faultless. But this was not to be another memorable moment for him. Salah\u2019s penalty was struck low and powerfully to the goalkeeper\u2019s left and in a moment a match was won, an obstacle overcome.\n\nMohamed Salah stepped up to score from the penalty spot and put Liverpool ahead against Tottenham at Anfield\n\nThe Egyptian was jumped upon by his captain after getting the Reds back on track after they had earlier trailed in the tie\n\nThe spot-kick had been awarded after Serge Aurier kicked through into the back of the legs of Sadio Mane\n\nThe Senegal star was left in a heap in the penalty area, as the Kop immediately cried in unison for a penalty\n\nAt full-time Salah left the field with his left ankle heavily bandaged up with a large pack of ice, which will concern Liverpool\n\nMATCH FACTS, PLAYER RATINGS AND LEAGUE TABLE LIVERPOOL (4-3-3) Alisson 6; Alexander-Arnold 8, Lovren 6, Van Dijk 6, Robertson 7.5; Henderson 7, Fabinho 7.5, Wijnaldum 6.5 (Milner 77mins 6); Salah 7 (Gomez 84mins 6), Firmino 8 (Origi 90), Mane 7.5 Subs Not used: Adrian, Keita, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Lallana Goalscorers: Henderson 52, Salah pen 75 Booked: Lovren, Alexander-Arnold, Milner Manager: Jurgen Klopp 7.5 TOTTENHAM (4-3-2-1): Gazzaniga 8.5; Aurier 6 (Moura 83mins 6), Alderweireld 6, Sanchez 6, Rose 6; Sissoko 5.5, Winks 5.5 (Ndombele 62mins 6), Alli 5.5; Eriksen 5.5 (Lo Celso 87mins 6), Son 6; Kane 6.5 Subs not used: Austin, Vertonghen, Dier, Davies GOALS: Kane 1 BOOKED: Sissoko, Aurier, Ndombele MANAGER: Mauricio Pochettino 6.5 REFEREE: Anthony Taylor 7 MAN OF THE MATCH: Sadio Mane Season at a glance Live tables\n\nFixtures\n\nScores Premier League\n\nPremier League\n\nChampionship\n\nLeague One\n\nLeague Two\n\nScottish Premiership\n\nScottish Div 1\n\nScottish Div 2\n\nScottish Div 3\n\nLigue 1\n\nSerie A\n\nLa Liga\n\nBundesliga\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat a test this had proved to be for Jurgen Klopp\u2019s players. Tottenham rarely give anything up easily at Anfield, even a version as complicated and unpredictable as this one. And from the moment Harry Kane scored after 47 seconds, they provided Liverpool with as stern a test of their will as they will face this season.\n\nKane\u2019s goal was freakish, ridiculously so. A hopeful shot from Heung-Min Son struck Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren on the shoulder and hit the angle of post and bar. The ball could have dropped anywhere and Kane was the lucky one, stooping to head in after a single bounce.\n\nIn one rather surreal moment, the whole nature of this afternoon was set. The tone of the game was immediately shifted. When Liverpool play \u2013 especially at home \u2013 the opening stages are so important.\n\nIf they score, they are devilishly hard to stop as the opposition are forced to chase and leave space. When something like this happens, Liverpool find themselves confronted by the football equivalent of a wall.\n\nSo this is how it went here. Tottenham celebrated their early goal and then preferred to resist. For almost the next hour and a quarter, up until Salah\u2019s goal, the flow of the football went only one way. Tottenham did not muster another shot on target until they went behind. Liverpool, meanwhile, surged forwards, driven by the knowledge that anything other than a victory would be damaging.\n\nGazzaniga was not extravagant or showy. Instead he did everything that he was required to - parrying, catching, punching, anticipating.\n\nIn the first half he saved very well from Salah twice and also from Roberto Firmino, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Virgil van Dijk. On top of that was a header from Sadio Mane that went wide.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s football was constructive and patient. There was no panic. The threat from full-backs Alexander-Arnold and Andy Robertson was ever present and as the pace of Liverpool\u2019s football intensified, so did the occasionally desperate nature of Tottenham\u2019s play.\n\nJordan Henderson's timed run to the back post saw him get a volley away, early in the second half, to level the scoreline\n\nThe Liverpool skipper fired his effort between defenders Danny Rose and Davinson Sanchez to find the back of the net\n\nHenderson roared in celebration as the decibel levels surged inside Anfield following the equalising strike\n\nHarry Kane broke the deadlock after just 48 seconds by stooping low to get his head on a rebounding effort off the crossbar\n\nKane hit the turf and watched on as his placed effort made its way into the back of the net at the Kop end\n\nBrazilian goalkeeper Alisson quickly launched himself into full stretch but was unable to get his fingers to the ball\n\nAnfield held its breath as the ball crept beyond Alisson and into the bottom corner to give Spurs a surprise early lead\n\nKane raced off to the corner of the pitch in celebration, with Dele Alli and Son Heung-min trailing in his wake\n\nThe Spurs players piled on top of their goalscorer and praised Kane for his quick thinking and sharp reactions\n\nThe goal had come about after Son's long-range effort deflected off Dejan Lovren and onto the Liverpool crossbar\n\nMoussa Sissoko was booked for dissent and Serge Aurier for a foul. Both were understandable.\n\nSomehow Tottenham did reach half-time in the lead. At that stage Liverpool had enjoyed 75 per cent of the possession.\n\nRemarkably, Tottenham could have scored at the start of the second half. A punt from the goalkeeper set Son away and when he rounded Alisson he clipped a shot from an angle against the bar.\n\nThat would probably have won Spurs the game. Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s team are not the cohesive, athletic force they were last season but they are certainly good enough to hold a two-goal lead for 40 minutes.\n\nAs it was, Liverpool continued to beat against the white wall and in the 52d minute they finally equalised.\n\nJordan Henderson drove a cross in from the right and made his way in to the penalty area when it was cleared.\n\nFabinho, excellent all afternoon, picked up the play 30 yards from goal and when his delivery could not be met by Firmino, Henderson was lurking behind everyone to volley left footed back across Gazzaniga and in to the far corner of the goal.\n\nRoberto Firmino was denied by Paulo Gazzaniga, who pulled off a solid double save after stopping Mo Salah seconds earlier\n\nGazzaniga also produced a stunning reflex save to tip Virgil van Dijk's header over the crossbar by inches\n\nScenes soon began to spice up at Anfield as Moussa Sissoko took exception to the actions of Andy Robertson\n\nVan Dijk later went down in the Spurs area and insisted he had been caught in the throat by a stray elbow\n\nThe Liverpool captain\u2019s first Anfield goal for almost four years, it was celebrated wildly by players and manager. With so long still to play, it seemed inevitable that Liverpool would go on and win.\n\nThat they had to wait so long for their second goal was a surprise and the penalty, awarded after Aurier tangled with Mane, was a little soft.\n\nBehind at last, Tottenham did have time to respond and they did so. Alisson saved well from Son and then from a Toby Alderweireld header while Danny Rose shot wildly over.\n\nIt all felt a little breathless for mid-Autumn but that only reflects the nature of the challenge that stands before Liverpool. They have a six-point lead over City but somehow it feels slight. Opportunities, when they arrive, must be taken.\n\nThe atmosphere was crackling at Anfield prior to kick-off as the two sides lined up on the pitch", "description": "IAN LADYMAN AT ANFIELD: Given\u00a0how tight the margins are set to be in another title shoot out between Liverpool and City, it's hard to overstate the significance of Mo Salah's 50th Anfield goal.", "authors": ["Ian Ladyman For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/20/20253974-0-image-a-4_1572206563890.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
