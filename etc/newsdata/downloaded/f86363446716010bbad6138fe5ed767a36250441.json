Expect some showers over eastern parts of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland whilst far southwest England will be windy with rain at times.\n\nTonight:\n\nAnother cold, dry and frosty night for many with a few fog patches about by dawn whilst southwest England remains cloudy and windy with rain at times.\n\nWednesday:\n\nA cold start then most areas fine, dry and bright. Cloudier and windy across southwest England where rain at times, especially during the afternoon and evening.\n\nOutlook for Thursday to Saturday:\n\nBright but cold on Thursday in the northeast. Milder, murky conditions in the southwest with some rain extending northeast to all parts by Friday. Generally unsettled and windy on Saturday.\n\n", "description": "Despite the sunny forecast for today, the Environment Agency has issued 146 flood warnings and alerts for England", "authors": ["Matthew Dresch", "Image", "Getty Images", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20746703.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Met-Office-Issues-Heavy-Snow-Weather-Warnings.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
