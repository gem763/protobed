While models like Gigi and Bella Hadid, Joan Smalls, and Taylor Hill walked through the venue in glittering overcoats, tuxedo jackets, and floor-length sequin gowns, there was even more glamour onstage, where Janelle Mon\u00e1e reigned with an unforgettable performance.\n\nIn a backless, tuxedo-inspired halter top, detached white wrist cuffs, and a sheer plaid skirt with cummerbund, Mon\u00e1e crooned jazz classics like Irving Berlin\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Face the Music and Dance,\u201d Frank Sinatra\u2019s \u201cFly Me to the Moon,\u201d and Nat King Cole\u2019s \u201cSmile.\u201d After a tribute to the designer, the 33-year-old singer moved the party offstage, switching to a high-energy performance and turning the entire room into her own personal musical playground.\n\nWhile singing her 2010 song, \u201cCome Alive (War of the Roses),\u201d Mon\u00e1e danced through the crowd, climbed on top of tables, crawled over the floor, flung food, splashed Champagne in the air, and even sat on a partygoer\u2019s lap, as guests like Anna Wintour, Henry Golding, Cate Blanchett, and Mandy Moore looked on. Indya Moore was also spotted dancing in front of Mon\u00e1e as the singer whipped off her heels and returned to the stage to finish off the performance with some scat-singing.\n\nThere truly was no one better to invoke the spirit of the Jazz Age than Mon\u00e1e. Watch the full performance below.\n\nStay in touch.
