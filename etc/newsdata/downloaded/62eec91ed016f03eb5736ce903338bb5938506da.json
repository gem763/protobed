But, after the mourning ends, her many enemies could well begin circling.\n\nEmmerson Mnangagwa, Zimbabwe\u2019s president and the man who overthrew her husband, promised last year that the Mugabes would be \u201cleft in peace\u201d, but he pointedly ruled out granting them immunity.\n\nHe is certainly no fan of the former first lady, accusing her of trying to kill him by poisoning his ice-cream as they jostled to be named Mr Mugabe\u2019s successor in the months before the coup.\n\nOut of deference to his former boss, President Mnangagwa left her alone. With him gone, he may be less circumspect.\n\nFew politicians or ordinary Zimbabweans would rally to her cause. From the moment the former typist, 40 years her husband\u2019s junior, married Mr Mugabe in 1996, excess seemed to follow excess.\n\nWhen white-owned farms were seized, ostensibly to be redistributed to the poor, she allegedly received 20 of the very best, becoming one of Zimbabwe\u2019s largest landowners.\n\nMr Mugabe\u2019s three children adored their father, who lavished them with presents, such as luxury homes, and a fabulous lifestyle.\n\nIn a country brought to penury by her husband\u2019s misrule, Mrs Mugabe's extravagance will not be forgotten quickly. Mr Mnangagwa would also welcome the distraction a trial of the former first lady would bring from the continuing financial woes Zimbabwe is suffering.\n\nCriminal charges would not come without risk, however. If Mrs Mugabe is placed in the dock, there is no knowing what uncomfortable secrets about Zimbabwe\u2019s ruling elite she may reveal.", "description": "Shorn of her late husband\u2019s protection, Grace Mugabe is likely to be feeling more than a little exposed as she begins her widowhood.
