Against the euro, the pound was down 0.3% at 89.55 pence ( ), the lowest since Sept. 13.\n\nNomura's forex strategist Jordan Rochester said he was taking the Spectator report \"with a huge pinch of salt\".\n\n\"On the surface, it raises the chances of 'no-deal' marginally,\" Rochester said. However, \"because we're in this limbo with Brexit, any headline moves the market\", he said.\n\nLast week, Britain sent a proposal to Brussels to replace the Irish border \"backstop\" - an insurance policy to keep the border open between the Republic of Ireland and the British province of Northern Ireland - but the proposal has been rebuffed by EU leaders.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly vowed to take Britain out of EU on Oct. 31 even without a divorce deal in place, but a law called the Benn Act requires him to seek a delay if the UK cannot agree a withdrawal deal by Oct. 19.\n\nA report in the Daily Telegraph on Monday said Johnson intended to challenge that law in the Supreme Court.\n\n(By Olga Cotaga and Elizabeth Howcroft; Editing by Kevin Liffey)", "description": "Sterling falls to three-week low vs euro as 'no-deal' Brexit worries flare", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF970GZ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
