She will not be personally responsible for paying the $100,000 in monetary sanctions, which will be paid by the government.\n\nThe judge ordered that the fine go to a fund held by the former Corinthian students\u2019 attorneys. It\u2019s meant to help defray the damages and expenses associated with the improper collection of the loans, she said. The judge ordered the government and the attorneys to come up with a plan for administering the fund.\n\nToby Merrill, the director of Harvard Law School\u2019s Project on Predatory Student Lending, which represents the former Corinthian students in the lawsuit, praised the judge\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a rare and powerful action by the court to hold the secretary in contempt,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd it reflects the extreme harm that Betsy DeVos and the Department of Education have caused students who were already defrauded by a for-profit college.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s highly unusual, but not unprecedented, for a federal judge to hold an agency head in contempt or issue fines.\n\nIn 2011, during the Obama administration, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar was held in contempt by a judge over a moratorium on oil drilling. In 2002, during the George W. Bush administration, Interior Secretary Gale Norton was held in contempt in a Native American land trust case. Both contempt findings were ultimately reversed by an appeals court.\n\nAn Education Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Trump administration had asked the judge to avoid holding DeVos and the Education Department in contempt or imposing fines, arguing that the department had \u201cbeen working diligently and in good faith to correct the errors.\u201d The department said in a court filing that it appreciated the \u201cgravity\u201d of the situation.\n\nDeVos earlier this month sparred about the possible contempt finding with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who called for the Education secretary\u2019s resignation over the issue.\n\n\u201cLoan servicers made an error on a small # of loans,\u201d DeVos tweeted at the time. \u201cWe know & we\u2019re fixing it.\u201d She also accused Warren of lying about the issue.\n\nAfter the judge\u2019s rebuke, the Education Department moved to reprimand several employees and also admonished the companies it hires to collect federal student loans, POLITICO reported earlier this month. The department has blamed much of the errors on those student loan servicing companies, though it admitted in a court filing last month that officials had been \u201cnegligent\u201d in overseeing the companies.\n\nThe Education Department has said it is in the process of providing refunds to at least 3,200 of those borrowers who ended up making unnecessary payments. Some of the borrowers paid voluntarily after being incorrectly told they owed money. In other cases, the government erroneously seized borrowers\u2019 federal tax refunds or wages.\n\nOn Thursday, Judge Kim also ordered the Education Department to provide a monthly status report on its attempts to comply with the order and send a notice to borrowers about the situation.\n\nKim said she was leaving open the possibility that if DeVos and the Education Department continue to violate her order she would \"impose additional sanctions, including the appointment of a Special Master to ensure compliance with the preliminary injunction.\"\n\nThe contempt finding and sanctions arose out of an ongoing lawuit against DeVos over her policy that provides only partial loan forgiveness to some borrowers whom the Education Department determines were defrauded.\n\nKim has blocked DeVos from carrying out the partial loan forgiveness policy, ruling that the Education Department ran afoul of federal privacy laws in calculating the amount of relief. The Trump administration has appealed that ruling to the 9th Circuit, where it remains pending.", "description": "A federal judge on Thursday held Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in contempt of court and imposed a $100,000 fine for violating an order to stop collecting on the student loans owed by students of a defunct for-profit college.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAGAekl.img?h=200&w=300&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=314&y=354", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
