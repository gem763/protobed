Day 1001: Faced with evidence of a meeting, Don Jr. admits that he met with a Russian lawyer but says it was about adoptions. Day 1002: Faced with evidence of what the meeting was really about, Don Jr. admits that the Russian lawyer said she had some great dirt on Hillary Clinton, but says he didn\u2019t know that before the meeting. Day 1003 (today): Email evidence indicates that he knew exactly what the meeting was about beforehand. Don Jr. lawyers up.\n\nHere\u2019s the latest from the New York Times:\n\nBefore arranging a meeting with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer he believed would offer him compromising information about Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump Jr. was informed in an email that the material was part of a Russian government effort to aid his father\u2019s candidacy, according to three people with knowledge of the email.\n\nDon Jr. is no longer responding to these stories via Facebook or Twitter. His attorney\u2019s statement is here.\n\nThere\u2019s something crazy going on here, and not just the fact that Don Jr. met with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer. Let\u2019s face it: he\u2019s plenty dumb enough to do something like that. The crazy thing is that someone\u2014or multiple someones\u2014really has it in for Junior. They\u2019ve been releasing information to the New York Times in very, very carefully staged tidbits designed to (a) get Don Jr. to lie on the record, and (b) keep the story going. At this point, Don Jr. has no idea what evidence these folks have, so he has no idea what it\u2019s safe to lie about.\n\nBut why? Why is someone going after Don Jr.? He\u2019s not involved with politics and Don Sr. doesn\u2019t seem to rely on him for anything. So why destroy him? Is it just a way of going after Don Sr.? If so, who\u2019s doing it?\n\nPOSTSCRIPT: The email was from Rob Goldstone, a music publicist who worked with Donald Trump Sr. to bring the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow. David Corn has the whole story here.", "description": "", "authors": ["Kevin Drum", "Political Blogger"], "top_image": "https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/blog_zuma_donald_trump_junior_elevator.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1", "published_at": "2017-07-11"}
