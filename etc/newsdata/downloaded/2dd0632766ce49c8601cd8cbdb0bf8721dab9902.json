That is just simply unacceptable.\n\n\"Those who are overseeing the code of conduct have got to tighter regulate those companies that they have under their banner and make sure that they're doing those checks and balances even before they're setting up new sites.\"\n\nPark Watch, a trading name of Defence Systems Ltd, said it would have made all the necessary checks on its identity before it was allowed to issue any tickets.\n\nThe BPA is investigating and will consider sanctions which could include expelling companies.\n\nThe DVLA said it had already suspended All Parking Services so it can no longer issue parking tickets, but refused to comment on the conduct of Park Watch.", "description": "Undercover journalists issue the fine after applying for a \"self-ticketing\" service.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/6839/production/_109218662_parkingcowboysassembly.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
