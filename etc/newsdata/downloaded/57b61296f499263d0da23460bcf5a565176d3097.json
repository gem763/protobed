He exerted quiet influence from behind the scenes, giving room for extrovert McDermott to play the role of showman and salesman.\n\nThe new leadership combines Morgan's focus on customer relationships in SAP's North American markets with Klein's background in process innovation that is rooted in SAP's German heritage.\n\n\"Bill was able to place SAP firmly in the cloud market and begin a difficult transition to an entirely new way of doing business, all the while still delivering the revenues investors were looking for. That's no mean feat,\" said Joshua Greenbaum, principal at EAConsult.\n\n\"Jen and Christian are in a good position to further SAP\u2019s own transformation while delivering the technology to fuel their customers' own transformations. It won't be easy by any stretch of the imagination, but the foundational elements are in place.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nACTIVIST INVESTOR\n\nMcDermott's exit follows the entry this year of activist investor Elliott, amid broader market concern that his acquisitions - including last year's $8 billion deal to buy customer relationship platform Qualtrics - had caused SAP to lose focus.\n\nHe responded by launching an efficiency drive, promising to expand profit margins by 5 percentage points through 2023. After a wobble in the second quarter, SAP's latest results showed the strategy shift was delivering positive results.\n\nGrowth in new cloud bookings more than doubled to 38%, lifted by a major three-year cloud deal with an unnamed partner, while operating margins expanded by an underlying 1.7 percentage points.\n\nMcDermott, speaking on a late-night call with reporters, denied bowing to pressure from Elliott, saying he would have had to decide on renewing his contract in early 2020. He chose not to, on his own terms, in consultation with Plattner.\n\n\"I've enjoyed a great run and an exciting ride,\" said the 58-year-old New Yorker, who has worn dark glasses since he was blinded in one eye by an accident at home. He will stay on in an advisory role until the end of the year.\n\n\"You get to the point where you've done what you set out to do and then some,\" he added. Asked about his future plans, McDermott answered that it was too early to say before adding with typical ebullience: \"I'm just getting warmed up.\"\n\nSAP has brought fresh management talent to the fore over the past year in preparation for the handover.\n\nMorgan, a polished saleswoman who joined SAP in 2004, was handed board-level responsibility for cloud and 'go-to-market' operations.\n\nKlein, who came to SAP as a student, was promoted to the position of chief operating officer. He has managed SAP's flagship S/4HANA database - the 'brain' for applications that include finance, human resources and logistics.\n\nYet some clients, in particular in its home market, have become increasingly vocal about the challenges of upgrading SAP's complex products for the digital era, instead demanding 'out-of-the-box' solutions.\n\n\"Bill has always had a desire to hear from customers - he wanted to know from me what customers had to say, both the good and the bad,\" says Geoff Scott, head of the American SAP User Group (ASUG).\n\nThat discontent has created an opening for long-time rival Oracle, which trumpeted its success in winning over SAP clients with its own cloud business suite at a recent U.S. user conference.\n\nKlein dismissed Oracle's claims: \"None of the customers that were shown there have left SAP,\" he said.
