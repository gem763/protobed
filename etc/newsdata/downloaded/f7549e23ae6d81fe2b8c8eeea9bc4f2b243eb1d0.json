Mandatory credit Kyodo/via REUTERS\n\nAfter months of mediocrity following his 15th major title at the Masters in April, Woods emerged from metaphorical hibernation to match Sam Snead\u2019s record 82 wins on the PGA Tour on Monday.\n\nHis three-stroke victory at the Zozo Championship, in his first start after knee surgery two months ago, seemingly came out of nowhere, proving once again that quality never goes out of style.\n\nAt 43, Woods does not hit the ball as far as many of his current rivals, but has found a way to win without overpowering a course in the manner of his prime.\n\n\u201cIt never ceases to amaze really,\u201d 2013 Masters champion and former world number one Adam Scott told Reuters, noting the roller coaster that Woods has been on this year.\n\n\u201cWhen he wins the Masters you\u2019re like \u2018he\u2019s going to break Jack (Nicklaus\u2019s record of 18 majors), that\u2019s a guarantee\u2019 and then by August you\u2019re not sure if he\u2019s ever going to play again and now after that break of two months he comes back and wins here off an extended break.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he\u2019s going to tee it up you can never count him out. He\u2019s not consistently dominating like we once was, like we all got used to but he has this incredible talent and gift of getting the golf ball in the hole. His form is going to come and go but that gift is not going away.\u201d\n\nOther major champions were similarly impressed.\n\nRory McIlroy, who at age 30 has 17 PGA Tour victories, duly noted that he would have to win six times yearly for the next decade to approach 82 wins.\n\nAnd this year\u2019s British Open champion Shane Lowry sounded more like a fan than a man who won a major championship three months ago.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s my golfing idol and sporting idol,\u201d said Irishman Lowry. \u201cHe\u2019s the best that\u2019s ever lived. It doesn\u2019t surprise me whatever he does.\u201d\n\nThis year\u2019s U.S. Open champion Gary Woodland played the final two rounds with Woods, and saw up close what the man is still capable of.\n\n\u201cThe ball-striking exhibition I\u2019ve seen the last two days is a joke, so I don\u2019t see him stopping any time soon,\u201d Woodland said. \u201cEighty-two\u2019s pretty special. I think there\u2019s a lot more in store.\u201d", "description": "Tiger Woods' peers have learned over the years never to be surprised at anything he accomplishes and are braced for a further onslaught from the greatest player of their era, and perhaps any era.", "authors": ["Andrew Both", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445754068&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R0DD-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
