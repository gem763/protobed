REUTERS/Aly Song/File Photo\n\nThe number of new energy vehicles (NEVs) sold contracted for the second month in a row, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) showed.\n\nTotal auto sales fell 6.9% from the same month a year earlier to 1.96 million, CAAM said on Wednesday. This followed declines of 4.3% in July and 9.6% in June.\n\n\u201cThe sales in the second half of the year should become better, but we are not sure to what extent the sales would be,\u201d Shi Jianhua, senior official at CAAM said.\n\n\u201cPerhaps the next three years will be at a low or small negative growth. We\u2019re all looking forward to sales picking up, but it\u2019s normal if we don\u2019t get that,\u201d he said, adding the key reason for the poor outlook was low consumer confidence amid a economic slowdown and trade tensions with the United States.\n\nAs recently as three years ago automakers had enjoyed double digit annual growth in the world\u2019s largest auto market, before the brakes came on with the first annual contraction since the 1990s last year.\n\nSales of new energy vehicles fell 15.8% in August, CAAM said, following a 4.7% fall in July - their first decline since January 2017. NEV sales jumped almost 62% last year even as the broader auto market contracted.\n\nNEVs include plug-in hybrids, battery-only electric vehicles and those powered by hydrogen fuel cells.\n\nChina has been a keen supporter of NEVs and has brought in sales quota requirements for automakers.\n\n\u201cDue to the impact of subsidies cut on new energy vehicles, sales for new energy vehicles continued to drop,\u201d Chen Shihua, assistant secretary general at CAAM, said.\n\nSTANDARDS, TARIFFS\n\nCAAM said in July it expected auto sales to fall 5% year-on-year to 26.68 million vehicles in 2019.\n\nIt still expects sales of new energy vehicles to increase, but at a slower pace to 1.5 million, down from a previous forecast of 1.6 million.\n\nChina has been trying since January to boost consumption of a range of goods as the world\u2019s second-biggest economy slows further amid a trade spat with the United States characterized by tit-for-tat import tariffs.\n\n\u201cWe expect these measures will promote the consumption of autos in China,\u201d Chen said.\n\nThe implementation of new vehicle emission standards earlier than the central government\u2019s 2020 deadline by 15 cities and provinces, which account for over 60% of car sales in China, spooked buyers too and hurt sales - particularly of traditional-fuel vehicles - according to CAAM, analysts, dealers and consumers.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nThe prolonged sales decline has made local carmakers such as Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd (0175.HK) and Great Wall Motor Co Ltd (601633.SS) cut expectations for sales and profit.\n\nThe decline has also prompted some global names including Peugeot SA (PEUP.PA) to close plants and adjust workforce.\n\nChina is also re-instituting an additional 25% tariff on U.S.-made vehicles and 5% tariffs on auto parts that had been suspended at the beginning of the year. Carmakers such as Daimler AG (DAIGn.DE) and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) had adjusted their prices in China when the auto and auto parts tariffs were suspended.", "description": "China's auto sales could experience negative to low growth over the next three years, an official with the country's top industry association said, after sales fell for a 14th consecutive month in August.", "authors": ["Yilei Sun", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428588346&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A0DI", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
