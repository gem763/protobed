I fully expect Liverpool\u2019s performances to improve throughout the season.\n\n\u2018Mane\u2019s looking electric and Firminio and Salah are playing the role of helping him out at the moment, but they work so well together that when one\u2019s not playing so well, the other two up their game.\u2019\n\nWhile Murphy expects Manchester City to fall short in pursuit of a third straight Premier League title, he says Pep Guardiola\u2019s side can conquer Europe.\n\nHe added: \u2018City and Pep\u2019s desire to win the Champions League could be enough for them to take it home this season.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018If it comes down to seriously going for either the Premier League, or the Champions League, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see Pep put all his eggs in one basket and go for the Champions League.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018Unless they meet beforehand, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Liverpool and City met in the final.\n\n\u2018Barcelona are always going to be the main threat and Juventus will be right behind them. With the issues currently going on at Real Madrid, I would be surprised if they won it this season.\u2019\n\nLiverpool face in-form Leicester City this weekend while Manchester City welcome Wolves to the Etihad.", "description": "Danny Murphy has backed Liverpool to win the Premier League this season and says defending champions Manchester City can finally secure a Champions League trophy.
