Total revenues were driven by growth in each segment. The company\u2019s results also benefited from a robust performance at Whistler Blackcomb, which overshadowed slow start to the Epic Discovery season in Colorado.\n\n\n\nSegment Results\n\nVail Resorts generates revenues from two segments \u2014 Resort (99.9% of net revenues in fourth-quarter fiscal 2019) and Real Estate (0.03%). Under the Resort segment, the company has Mountain and Lodging services, and other (constituting 72.1% of net revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter), and Mountain and Lodging retail and dining (27.8%).\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Vail Resorts has two reporting segments \u2014 Mountain and Lodging.\n\nThe Mountain segment reported revenues of $157.2 million in the quarter under review, up 19.7% year over year. The metric was mainly driven by higher sales from North America pass sales growth, and increased lift, ski and rental revenues. Sales were also driven by non-pass skier visitation at the company\u2019s western U.S. resorts as well as incremental revenues from the Acquired Resorts.\n\n\n\nThe segment\u2019s EBITDA came in at negative $65.3 million compared with a negative $64.5 million in the prior-year quarter.

Net income is projected to be $293-$353 million.\n\n\n\nOther Development\n\n\n\nVail Resorts has completed the acquisition of Peak Resorts, Inc. (SKIS) for $11 per share. With the completion of this buyout, the company added 17 U.S. ski areas to its portfolio. The newly acquired resorts are located in the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest. Currently, the company has 37 owned and operated resorts worldwide.\n\n\n\nIn a bid to enhance the guest experience at the newly acquired resorts, the company plans to invest nearly $15 million over the next two years. Per Vail Resorts, its annual ongoing capital expenditures are likely to increase by nearly $10 million owing to these latest buyouts.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIt turns out, fresh estimates have trended downward during the past month. The consensus estimate has shifted -13.06% due to these changes.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nCurrently, Vail Resorts has a subpar Growth Score of D, however its Momentum Score is doing a lot better with a B. However, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of D. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, Vail Resorts has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.", "description": "Stocks Analysis by Zacks Investment Research covering: S&P 500.
