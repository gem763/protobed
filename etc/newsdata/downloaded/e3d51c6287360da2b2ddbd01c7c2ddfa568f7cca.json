After a very strong start to September, here\u2019s a look at a few top stock trades going into next week.\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #1: Ford\n\ntop stock trades for F More\n\nShares of Ford (NYSE:F) haven\u2019t made much progress this week, but it\u2019s been a good showing from the bulls. Earlier this week, the company had its credit downgraded to junk status, but Ford stock posted a resilient rally.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOn Friday, the stock briefly reclaimed the 50-day moving average, the same one which rejected F earlier in the week. A move above it puts $9.65 on watch and above that, a potential gap fill up to $10.20.\n\nOn the downside, see that Ford maintains above $9.40-ish. Just below is the 38.2% and rising 20-day moving average to help buoy shares on a possible pullback. Below this week\u2019s low opens up the possibility of $8.75.\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #2: General Motors\n\ntop stock trades for GM More\n\nShares of General Motors (NYSE:GM) have had a quiet week, but that comes after last week\u2019s strong gap up action. Consolidating between $38.50 and $39.50, GM stock is bound to move out of this range at some point.\n\nShould it resolve higher, the first target is $40.50. Above that and a run to the July highs is possible, up near $41.48. If it trades lower and falls out of this consolidation pattern, look for support from the 50-day and 20-day moving averages.\n\nIf they fail as support, it puts the 200-day moving average on watch, with range support at $35.50 below that.\n\n\n\n\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #3: Monster\n\ntop stock trades for MNST More\n\nMonster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST) has a really interesting setup for traders. Uptrend support (blue line) continues to squeeze shares against static resistance at $59. That\u2019s known as an ascending triangle, a bullish technical pattern.\n\nAt $59.27, the stock also has the 38.2% retracement it\u2019s trying to reclaim. Should it finally breakout, look for a possible run to the 50-day moving average. Above that and $63 is possible.\n\nIf the 200-day and $59 resistance reject MNST stock, look for a pullback into uptrend support.\n\nTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #4: Twilio\n\ntop stock trades for TWLO More\n\nAfter the thrashing we\u2019ve seen in high growth stocks, many were hoping for a more impressive rebound. This bounce has been tepid, and that\u2019s putting it kindly. Just look at the action in Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) for instance.\n\nShort of a flood of buy orders, Twilio and others look set to roll over once again. Should TWLO get hit, I would love to see a correction down to the $96 to $98 area, and see whether that draws in buyers.\n\nHigh-growth selloffs are tough. If there are a few companies you really like and are willing to hold for the long term \u2014 and embrace the risk \u2014 nibbling on these declines can be rewarding. But they\u2019re difficult to time. In TWLO\u2019s case, let\u2019s take it one day at a time and see how it holds up on a potentially deeper decline.\n\nBret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.
