It is also a great tool for innovative entrepreneurs. They can use the data gathered by the programme to create new products and new services \u2014 and the jobs and customers that go with them.\n\nCrop View uses Copernicus data to detect differences in vegetation health. Friedemann Scheibler Precision farming, Claas e-services\n\nBut first they have to know how to optimize the incredible mine of information provided by Copernicus\u2019 satellites.\n\nThat\u2019s where Slovenian SME Sinergise comes in.\n\nBacked by European funds from the Horizon 2020 programme, company founder Grega Mil\u010dinski and his teams have developed a solution called Sentinel Hub.\n\n\u201cWith Copernicus, the amount of data has changed significantly, and these data, which are free and good quality, and useful for many cases, are also data which are technically complex,\u201d Mil\u010dinski says. \u201cWith Sentinel Hub, we made it easier and more efficient to use\u201d.\n\nOur #Sentinel2#OpenData enables to derive Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) information which can be used for water management.\n\nHere are four views of the Bellandur Lake, south of HAL airport in #Bangalore#Bengaluru ?? that show fluctuations in water levels pic.twitter.com/xCwPQpKTXF \u2014 Copernicus EU (@CopernicusEU) 20 f\u00e9vrier 2018\n\nBusiness with Copernicus data Copernicus is the EU\u2019s Earth Observation programme. It delivers satellite data on a free, full and open basis.\n\nCopernicus data are used to provide services in six areas: land, marine environment monitoring, atmosphere monitoring, climate change, emergency management and security.\n\nA number of companies and innovative start-ups are using the data to create new applications and services. Useful links Copernicus\n\nEU space policy\n\nSME Instrument\n\nCrop View\n\nSinergise\u2019s customers include the global manufacturing giant Claas, a German company that makes agricultural machinery.\n\nThanks to Sentinel Hub, Mil\u010dinski has developed Crop View, an application that allows new generation agricultural machines to be even more efficient.\n\n\u201cCrop View uses Copernicus data to detect differences in vegetation health and development state within any farmers\u2019 fields boundaries,\u201d explains Friedemann Scheibler, who works on specialist precision farming for Claas e-services.\n\n\u201cWith this information, users get the opportunity to create application maps in a very easy and efficient way, download them, and put them directly on their machine\u201d.\n\nScheibler says he is very happy with the application. First, because it was developed in just six months; and second, because it provides real added value for its customers.\n\n\u201cYou will produce higher yields and better crop quality. You increase the efficiency of applied resources, such as fertilizers. And you limit your environmental (impact), through a more sustainable working practice\u201d.\n\nAs for the Sinergise, it hasn\u2019t stopped expanding: From eight employees 10 years ago, that number has grown to 45 today.\n\nIt also has customers all over the world.\n\n\u201cWe have almost 5,000 users, ranging from a small orchid farm in South Africa to the large organisations like the EU satellite centre,\u201d Mil\u010dinski says. \u201cAll of them are using Copernicus data to empower their business models.
