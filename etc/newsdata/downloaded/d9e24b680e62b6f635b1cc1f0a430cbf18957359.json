Some are reported to be under the age of 18.\n\nThe prominent human rights lawyer, Mahienour al-Massry, was among those being held, her lawyer said. Tarek al-Awadi told AFP news agency she was arrested on Sunday as she walked out of the State Security Prosecutor's office in Cairo, where she had been representing several people detained in connection with the protests.\n\nState media said many social media users had been reposting old footage dating back to the 2011 revolution to mislead the public into believing there was unrest.\n\nMeanwhile, internet monitoring organisation NetBlocks tweeted on Sunday night that Facebook Messenger, BBC News and social media servers had been restricted in Egypt by leading providers.\n\nThe protests were prompted by a call from Mohamed Ali, an Egyptian businessman living in self-imposed exile in Spain who has been posting videos on social media since 2 September that accuse Mr Sisi and the military of corruption.\n\nMr Ali had urged Egyptians to take to the streets on Friday to demand the president step down, and has called for a \"million-strong protest\" this Friday.\n\nPresident Sisi has dismissed Mr Ali's allegations as \"lies and slander\".", "description": "Protests against alleged government corruption erupted in Cairo and other cities over the weekend.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07nz805.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
