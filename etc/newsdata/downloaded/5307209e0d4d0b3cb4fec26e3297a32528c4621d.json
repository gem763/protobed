Cory Booker (D-N.J.) said on Wednesday that if he were elected president in 2020, he would create a White House Office of Reproductive Freedom to ensure access to safe, legal abortion.\n\nThe presidential candidate told Cosmopolitan magazine that the recent attacks on abortion rights are what spurred him to create the idea for an executive-run office. The office would deal with several issues surrounding reproductive freedom, including abortion, birth control, family planning, infertility, and maternal and infant mortality.\n\n\u201cThe White House Office of Reproductive Freedom would be coordinating amongst agencies and activists and groups to try to make sure that we restore and reaffirm a woman\u2019s reproductive rights,\u201d Booker told Cosmo, adding that both abortion care and birth control should be treated as health care issues.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about infertility enough and understand that there are things that should be covered by insurance to help with infertility that are not,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk enough about maternal mortality, infant mortality. So this office will be dealing with reproductive freedom in the largest sense of the understanding.\u201d\n\nIn the last six months, states including Georgia, Ohio and Missouri have all banned abortion as early as the first trimester. Alabama passed the strictest abortion bill in the country in May, banning the procedure in nearly all cases, including rape and incest. The only exception is if the life of the pregnant woman is at risk. Earlier this year, Texas lawmakers considered the death penalty for any woman who gets an abortion.\n\nBooker first floated the idea for an Office of Reproductive Freedom during the most recent presidential debate earlier this month.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, let\u2019s be clear about these laws we see from Alabama to Ohio,\u201d the New Jersey senator said during the debate. \u201cThey\u2019re not just attacks on one of the most sacrosanct ideals in our country \u2014 liberty, the ability to control your own body \u2014 but they are particularly another example of people trying to punish, trying to penalize, trying to criminalize poverty.\u201d\n\nBooker told Cosmo that he will fight for abortion rights whether he\u2019s elected president or not.\n\n\u201cMen should not be taking a back seat on this. They should be leading on this along with women,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot sit here as a man, as a black man, enjoying the rights other people fought for without understanding that I can never pay them back, but I\u2019m going to pay it forward by fighting to make sure we get to a day in America where everyone is free and everyone can enjoy the abundance that comes with a nation that honors liberty and dignity.\u201d", "description": "The Democratic senator from New Jersey explained how he would protect access to safe, legal abortion if he were elected president in 2020.", "authors": ["Women'S Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5db995a82000009b33507386.jpeg?cache=nelaseaist&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
