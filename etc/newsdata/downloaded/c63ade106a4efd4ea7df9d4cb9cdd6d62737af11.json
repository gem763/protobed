It\u2019s the Chinese company\u2019s second round of cuts in the US this year, as NIO laid off 70 employees and closed a San Francisco office back in May. NIO began 2019 with 640 employees in Silicon Valley, according to financial filings.\n\nThe new round of cuts are part of \u201can optimization effort,\u201d according to NIO\u2019s director of North American communications, JoAnn Yamani. She also said they affected \u201cevery department.\u201d NIO\u2019s presence in the US is primarily focused on R&D and engineering.\n\nYamani\u2019s comments echo what the company said following the previous round of layoffs in the US. \u201cAfter four years of rapid growth, we\u2019ve set up a global organization. However, fast development has also posed issues like repetitive functional departments, undefined work tasks, unclear work responsibilities, and insufficient work for certain people,\u201d NIO told The Verge in May. \u201cWe would like to solve them by optimizing management efficiency this year.\u201d\n\nNIO is in the middle of a global restructuring, and sales of its first SUV have tanked\n\nFounded in 2014, NIO started shipping its first vehicle, the all-electric ES8 SUV, in China in the middle of 2018, and the company delivered more than 10,000 of them by the end of last year. NIO also became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange in September 2018, raising $1 billion in the listing.\n\nBut the Chinese startup has struggled in 2019. The Chinese automotive market and the country\u2019s overall economy have slowed throughout the year after decades of growth. At the same time, NIO says the expiration of certain government subsidies for EVs, as well as the trade war with the United States, have both impacted the company\u2019s fledgling business. NIO also recalled nearly 5,000 ES8s thanks to a design flaw in its battery packs that created a fire risk.\n\nIn turn, ES8 sales declined in all but one month in 2019, with NIO delivering only 164 of them in July. (NIO hasn\u2019t released sales figures for August.)\n\nHave information about NIO?

Deliveries of the ES6 began in June, and NIO says it has 12,000 preorders for the newer SUV.\n\nRegardless, NIO is most likely going to miss its target of delivering 40,000 vehicles in 2019. Instead, the startup has spent most of 2019 undergoing a larger restructuring effort. The company has cut its global workforce from nearly 10,000 employees to about 8,000, and is expected to further trim that count down to 7,000. Earlier this year, NIO also abandoned a plan to build its own manufacturing plant in Shanghai, opting instead to continue paying state-owned automaker JAC Motors to contract manufacture the startup\u2019s cars.\n\nIn May, the company indefinitely delayed a forthcoming electric sedan just six weeks after the concept version was announced. NIO also sold its Formula E team after the electric racing series wrapped up its fifth season in July. Just a few weeks later, one of the company\u2019s three co-founders retired.\n\nNIO is not the only Chinese startup with a US presence to experience trouble this year. In July, The Verge reported that Seres (formerly known as SF Motors) laid off 90 of its 300 employees and suspended plans for a US launch, despite being backed by commercial Chinese automaker Sokon.", "description": "The Tencent-backed EV startup is making a second round of cuts in the US, laying off 62 employees from its North American headquarters in Santa Clara, California. NIO has struggled in 2019, in part because sales of its ES8 electric SUV have declined thanks to vanishing government subsidies and the trade war with the US.", "authors": ["Sean O'Kane", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0kYATXvMxe4xPXMynpfpnzhc3hU=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19193092/nio_sf_1288.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
