Meet Angela, the first named African woman in Jamestown", "language": "en", "text": "JAMESTOWN, Va. \u2014 Valarie Gray-Holmes sits quietly, her back to the audience gathered at benches under oak and cypress trees by the James River at Virginia\u2019s Historic Jamestowne.\n\nShe smooths her beige, cotton skirts and grease-stained apron as she waits to be introduced. The peach stripes on her blouse are all but faded and her yellow headscarf is wrapped loosely around her salt-and-pepper hair. As the waves splash against the riverbank, she rises slowly, silently. She turns to the audience and begins her story.\n\n\u201cEvery day I rise, and I come to a place and I cry,\u201d she says.\n\nValarie\u2019s character is a middle-aged woman reflecting on her young life of freedom in Angola in contrast with her lonely life as an enslaved woman in Jamestown. It is a story of pain and suffering: being torn from her community, forced aboard a slave ship, then a pirate ship, to be deposited in this strange and hostile land. She moves in close to a tourist, as if to take her by the hand. \u201cDo you have a name from birth?\u201d she asks. The woman responds. \u201cJane,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cI too, have a name from birth,\u201d she says with a smile. \u201cMy name is...\u201d Her eyes widen as she pauses abruptly, her fingers fly to her mouth. \u201cBut we won\u2019t speak of that now. They call me Angela here.\u201d She backs away, eyes downcast, and resumes her story, the wall between character and audience, enslaved and free, again intact.\n\nKaid Ray-Tipton, 25, of Arlington, Virginia, watched Valarie intensely. After the performance, he raised his hand. His father is black, his mother is white and his wife, Marla, is Burmese American. The couple came to Jamestown to honor their enslaved ancestors and to investigate the history of 1619, 400 years after the first recorded Africans in the Virginia colony landed in nearby Hampton. This was the first time he'd ever heard of Angela. Her story seemed like something he should have already known. And that both angered and embarrassed him.\n\n\u201cWhy Angela, why now?\u201d he asked.\n\nIt\u2019s a question Valarie often hears.\n\nWhy isn\u2019t Angela part of colonial history lessons? Why, 400 years later, are they just hearing her story?\n\n\u201cWhat if now is the time we are supposed to know about Angela?\u201d Valarie tells Kaid. Maybe now the country is finally ready to acknowledge Angela\u2019s importance \u2013 as the first African woman in Jamestown for whom there is a name and a story.\n\nWho is Angela?\n\nAngela was one of 350 enslaved Angolans aboard the San Juan Bautista ship as it sailed from Luanda in mid-1619, bound for Veracruz, Mexico. Captives from the Ndongo Kingdom endured a months-long journey chained and packed into the dark, musty hold of the ship, sitting amid cargo in filth, sickness and death. Only 207 survived the Atlantic crossing.\n\nThe ship was seized near Veracruz by two English privateer vessels, the White Lion and the Treasurer, who took the healthiest 55 or 60 to split between them and sell. The landing of the first \u201c20 and odd\u201d Africans in August 1619 was the primary subject of commemorations all over the nation this year.\n\nThe Tuckers: Hundreds of thousands of Africans were enslaved in America. Wanda Tucker believes her relatives were the first\n\nThe founding family you\u2019ve never heard of: The black Tuckers of Hampton, Virginia\n\nFinding Angela, the first named African woman in Jamestown USA TODAY\n\nAngela was brought to Jamestown a few days later with one or two others. They were among the Africans aboard the Treasurer.\n\nInauspicious as these landings may have seemed, they proved pivotal to the survival of the Virginia colony. The enslaved Africans came as the colony was recovering from drought and starvation that shrank its members from nearly 300 to 60. Tobacco cultivation was showing signs of becoming the viable, profitable industry that would save them. Skilled labor was needed.\n\nThe enslavement of Africans wasn't new to the colonists; by 1619 there were many African servants or slaves in England and the Spanish and Portuguese had built empires in South America and the Caribbean based on African slave labor.\n\nNor was racism. Merchants and nobles had complained to the crown about societal ills they blamed on black people. Despite having African servants herself, Queen Elizabeth issued several proclamations in the late 1500s urging that \"blackamoors\" be driven from the land.\n\nWhile white indentured servants from Europe could be had for cheap to help the Virginia colony prosper, enslaved Africans could be had for free.\n\nFrom these first landings to nearly 250 years later when slavery was abolished, more than 360,000 Africans were taken from their homes to the United States. Angela is part of the origin, both proud and shameful, of the most prosperous nation on earth.\n\n\u201cHer story is the story of all the Africans who follow,\u201d said James Horn, president of the Jamestown Rediscovery Foundation, which conducts archaeological digs at Jamestown.\n\nValarie\u2019s interpretation of Angela\u2019s life is but one part of the effort to tell her story. The other is a three-year, approximately $550,000 National Parks Service grant to the foundation to examine the area where she lived.\n\nIn 1625, six years after her arrival, Angela is listed in the colony muster with the Portuguese spelling of her Christian name \u2013 \u201cAngelo, a Negro Woman\u201d \u2013 living in the household of Captain William Pierce. By then, she had endured the transatlantic ordeal and survived Indian attacks in 1622 that nearly devastated the colony. Angela\u2019s resilience is remarkable since colonists often died within months of arrival, just by dint of weather and disease.\n\nVery few records of enslaved people exist in conventional public records \u2013 African Americans tracing their roots can turn to plantation records and ship manifests, but often African people are listed as property or cargo. The few known details about Angela \u2013 her name, home and country of origin \u2013 and her place at the beginning of the American story make her stand out among the millions of enslaved people who were often nameless and faceless. She is a symbolic holy mother for generations of African Americans searching for their heritage.\n\n\u201cThere is something about having a name and a real person to connect to,\u201d says historian Linda Heywood, who specializes in Central African history. \u201cShe is one of the earliest Africans for whom we know something.\u201d\n\n1619 Voices We asked readers to share their stories, and we\u2019re re-telling them for the historical record.

Listen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTell your story\n\nTelling Angela\u2019s story\n\nBringing Angela\u2019s story to life has become personal for Valarie, who has worked at Colonial Williamsburg and other historic sites for 25 years as an actress. She is a New Jersey native living in Virginia whose parents passed away several years ago.\n\nAt 63, Valarie could imagine Angela\u2019s longing for her family and homeland in the same way that she often thinks about her own younger days. But she admits that researching Angela\u2019s life and writing the script for the role was a challenge since much of what she knew about Africa came from Tarzan movies.\n\nSo she taught herself the history of Central Africa by reading books by Boston University professors Heywood and John Thornton, chatting with the archaeologists and even watching an online animated Canadian feature about Njinga Mbande, Angola\u2019s most revered queen. Horn\u2019s books helped her understand Jamestown, and she relied on the 1611 King James Bible and an 1828 Webster\u2019s Dictionary for language Angela would have known.\n\nBut there was still one big writer\u2019s block.\n\n\u201cI realized I wasn\u2019t able to tell the story of Angela in Jamestown because she wasn\u2019t there,\u201d Valarie said. \u201cShe was in Angola.\u201d\n\n1619: 400 years ago, a ship arrived in Virginia, bearing human cargo\n\nHistory: How an accidental encounter brought slavery to the United States\n\nThe commitment: Enslaved Africans landed in Virginia in 1619. USA TODAY is committed to telling the story, past and present\n\nThe young woman called Angela was a citizen of one of the largest and most influential kingdoms in Central Africa, the Ndongo. Since the mid-1400s, the Portuguese had established trade with the Ndongo kings and queens, whose title Ngola gave the country its name.\n\nLee McBee, staff archaeologist for the Jamestown Rediscovery Foundation, holds a piece of a serving vessel or pot found at the \"Angela\" dig site. Angela or other servants may have handled this sort of vessel. Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY\n\n\u201cFrom the time they (the Portuguese) got here, they were in contact with the Ndongo,\u201d said Edgar Marcolino, 36, a historian in Angola.\n\nMissionaries were in Ndongo as well, recording the history of the people as they converted them to Roman Catholicism. A famous late-17th century watercolor painting by Italian Capuchin priest/historian Giovanni Antonio Cavazzi da Montecuccolo shows the king of Ndongo forging tools in a demonstration of the metal-working prowess for which the Ndongo were renowned.\n\nSlavery had been a concept and condition all over Africa for millennia; enslaved people were currency. Slavery already existed in the social order of Kabasa, a sophisticated city of its day rivaling Lisbon or Rome in influence.\n\nHow \u201820 and odd\u2019 enslaved Africans became millions Explore the graphic\n\nBut by 1617, the Portuguese greed for highly skilled slaves who could mine their metals and grow their food in the New World clashed head-on with the Ndongo, whose rulers pushed back against the Portuguese as they moved farther into Angola and started taking people and resources without their sanction. The Portuguese enlisted a tribal adversary feared for its violence and witchcraft, the Imbangala, to wage war, enslave everyone they could and wipe out the rest.\n\nThe Imbangala scoured Kabasa, some 130 miles east of Portugal\u2019s Luanda colony on the Atlantic coast, rounding up thousands of men, women and children.\n\nAngela was one of them.\n\nYoung women like Angela were valuable to slave traders. They could be worked as hard as the men but also be made to bear child after child, ensuring even more slaves.\n\nThe Portuguese knew the women who came from densely populated towns and villages around Kabasa had versatile skills. They grew the family\u2019s vegetable gardens and raised pigs, cattle and fowl. They cooked the meals, cared for the children and washed their hand-sewn clothes in the rivers. The Portuguese knew these women bartered, bargained and sold their goods at the crowded local markets, speaking in at least two languages: their native Kimbundu and Portuguese. Angela had all the skills necessary to keep a home in the New World.\n\nThe Imbangala knew this too.\n\nExodus: Black History Month Special Edition\n\nMigrations: Blacks fled the South in droves more than a century ago, seeking true freedom\n\nMore: How 13 migrations of African-Americans changed the nation\n\nAs a prisoner, Angela was was marched more than 70 miles to the Fortaleza de Massangano on the Kwanza River. One of the oldest Portuguese forts in Angola, its primary function was to channel enslaved Africans to Luanda.\n\nBecause of poor Portuguese record keeping and oral-only Kimbundu traditions, \u201cwe don\u2019t have a lot of sources to tell numbers\u201d of enslaved people who moved through Massangano, but it was in the thousands, says Marcolino, who teaches middle schoolers just yards from the fort. According to Thornton, about 50,000 slaves were exported from Angola between 1617 and 1621. The countryside between Ndalatando and Luanda remains sparse and silent today, having never recovered from the population drain.\n\nContinue the conversation Sign up here Get email updates about more stories like this\n\nIn full view of the Ndongo citizens of Massangano, Angela and other prisoners were marched past the fort up a narrow, winding path to the pra\u00e7a de escravos, the \u201cSlave Garden,\u201d which overlooks the river.\n\nPrisoners were bathed, baptized and branded before being displayed for sale. Once sold, the Africans were marched to the fort where they would sometimes wait weeks before being forced to go through a tunnel and onto canoes that would take them down the Kwanza River to the courtyards of the merchants who now owned them. After waiting days or weeks in Luanda, Angela would have joined the other captives in being rowed out to the slave ships anchored in the harbor.\n\nEven if Angela was a Christian before her capture, she would have gone through another baptism: the sprinkling of water on her head, the administering of salt under her tongue for wisdom, the receipt of a blessing and a Christian name to replace her Kimbundu name.\n\nThis ritual of enslavement happened over and over just steps from the Church of Nossa Senhora da Victoria, where the Portuguese worshiped.\n\nLife in Jamestown\n\nBut Christian blessings would have been little comfort in a place that felt nothing like home.\n\nThe uncultivated land around Jamestown, with its red clay soil, was similar to the land near Kabasa, but even the oldest oak and cypress trees were younger than the Angolan savanna\u2019s imbondeiro trees.\n\nThe night sky in Jamestown, on the other side of the world from Kabasa, was a constant reminder that she was in a strange land. Even the stars were different here.\n\n\u201cI would think that would be the scariest thing imaginable because of your sense of vulnerability. You are removed from everybody that you know and everything that you know,\u201d said Cassandra Newby-Alexander, a professor of history at Norfolk State University.\n\nShow caption Hide caption Shalandis Wheeler Smith, center, portrays the enslaved African woman Angela in \u201cMother Tongue,\u201d an original play written by Abigail Schumann for the Jamestown Settlement museum....

Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY\n\nAll Angela had was her work. And that was invaluable, as evidenced by her mention by name in the 1625 Virginia Colony muster as one of the four servants living in the Pierce household, the only one black.\n\nAccording to Horn, she was likely enslaved, not indentured. Unlike white servants from Europe, the Africans lacked signed contracts specifying their terms of service and thus could be kept in servitude indefinitely.\n\nIn the Pierce\u2019s city home, Angela worked alongside her mistress, Joan Pierce. Joan was admired for her resourcefulness and will - while her husband was stranded on Bermuda after a hurricane wrecked his ship, she survived the colony\u2019s Starving Time in 1609. She worked and became known for her fig preserves.\n\nAngela likely grew the figs and raised the hogs, keeping house the way she had done in Kabasa. The fact that this enslaved African woman was listed in the muster alongside the other servants as if she were equal indicates the Pierces\u2019 must have had high regard for her.\n\n\u201cTo take someone\u2019s humanity away, the first thing you do is take their name \u2013 you make them nameless and faceless,\u201d says Kym Hall, the NPS superintendent at Colonial National Historic Park, which oversees Historic Jamestowne, Jamestown Island and other nearby sites. \u201cWhen you give her name back, it changes the way you think about (her). It brings her back to life in some small way.\u201d\n\nDigging for answers\n\nArchaeologist Lee McBee, whose team was charged with finding physical evidence of her world, understands Angela\u2019s value like few others.\n\nOn a recent 95-degree day that felt more like 105, he wiped his forehead with a rag, stuffed it in a back pocket of his khaki shorts and leaned against his shovel, taking as deep a breath as he could in the stifling summer heat. His team reminded him to re-hydrate before he resumed scraping the red clay earth, removing hundreds of years of soil one layer at a time. Wheelbarrows and buckets around the square patch of ground held dirt waiting to be sifted through a fine colander.\n\nShow caption Hide caption Lee McBee and his team sorted through hundreds of years of soil looking for colonial-era artifacts that could tell more about the lives of Angela... Lee McBee and his team sorted through hundreds of years of soil looking for colonial-era artifacts that could tell more about the lives of Angela and others who lived and worked at Captain William Pierce's home. Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY\n\nLee's connections to Jamestown are strong. Though he grew up in middle Tennessee, he had been coming to Jamestown since the fifth grade. His history teacher father would take the family on vacations to plantations and battlefields. Lee, 62, earned degrees in education and history and over the years has collected graduate hours toward a doctorate. He made a hobby of joining Revolutionary War re-enactments.\n\nLife kept leading him back to Jamestown. His townhouse is not five minutes from his workplace and is filled with 17th- and 18th-century antiques and replicas. During slow stints in archaeology he taught and coached football in the Charles City County public schools, where he met his wife, Christine, a self-described history nerd. They got married at Jamestown last year.\n\nThe empty-nesters have come to think of Angela as their daughter.\n\n\u201cWe have a purpose,\u201d Christine said, nearly in tears, while sitting in the couple\u2019s kitchen. The purpose is to educate others about Angela\u2019s life and remind them that she was not a commodity.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a person,\u201d Lee said. \u201cYou want them to respect her. She\u2019s not a product or a thing.\u201d\n\nAfter a few years of digging in 10-by-10-foot squares around what used to be Capt. Pierce\u2019s home, Lee\u2019s crew knew the typical yield: oyster shells, tiny pieces of roofing slate, broken bricks, and lots and lots of colonial square-headed nails.\n\nBut good days yield treasures such as a small white pipe bowl dating to the late 17th century; nearly intact amber bottles; pieces of European-made ceramic dishes, vessels that Angela and the other servants might have handled. Another find included a small gold ring, its crystal intact, which would have adorned the hand of a well-to-do woman.\n\nOne of the most cherished finds: four cowrie shells.\n\nShow caption Hide caption Archaeologist Angelina Towery-Tomasura sorts buckets of dirt and objects from the \"Angela\" dig site at Historic Jamestowne.

She helped find some of the most cherished items, four cowrie shells. The shell's origin is the Indian Ocean, establishing an African presence in Jamestown. Nichelle Smith, USA TODAY\n\nAngelina Towery-Tomasura, 23, has been searching for Angela at Jamestown ever since graduating in 2017 from Washington College. She remembers the day they found the first shell early this year. It was uncovered after only a few shovelfuls in a new area. Ironically, they had just spoken with a visitor at the dig site. Her name: Angela.\n\n\u201cIt was just sitting there, on top of the dirt,\u201d Angelina said. \u201cAfter we found it, everyone was real quiet all day.\u201d\n\nThe dime-sized oval shells are ivory and smooth but for the jagged teeth of the opening down the center. Their origin is the Indian Ocean. In Africa they were used as currency and because of their rounded shape, revered as a symbol of fertility.\n\nThey establish an African presence in Virginia like nothing else Lee\u2019s team had found. And the fact that these shells had holes opened at the back indicated they were altered to attach to clothing, jewelry or hair.\n\nThe thought that they might have been Angela\u2019s only reminders of home sobers the team.\n\nThey keep a photocopy of Angela taped to a wall in their shed, an artist\u2019s rendering in graphite, to remind them why they\u2019re here.\n\nEnduring lessons\n\nAngela disappears from official records after 1625. It\u2019s unknown if she ever married or had children. It\u2019s possible she could have been sold or sent to live among other enslaved Africans on Pierce\u2019s Mulberry Island plantation 20 miles south. Some historians and archaeologists like to fantasize that she escaped to freedom.\n\nOr perhaps at long last, after everything she\u2019d endured, Angela died.\n\nIf her grave is identified as one of three near the Angela site, it would give closure to her story, Newby-Alexander said, because testing would reveal whether she gave birth, what her health was like, how long she lived and how she died.\n\nLee McBee, staff archaeologist for the Jamestown Rediscovery Foundation, holds a fragment of a decorated pottery vessel found at the \"Angela\" dig site. Jarrad Henderson, USA TODAY\n\nHall says the parks service is studying other areas on Jamestown Island where African people were known to have lived and skeletal remains have been found. Although the grant money for the Angela site expired in September, other grants may be found to uncover more untold African stories.\n\n\u201cI think what you will see is an evolution of the story, not a cessation,\u201d Hall says.\n\nLee and Christine vow to create a nonprofit in Angela\u2019s name, to teach more children about archaeology and the importance of the First Africans. One of the cowrie shells his crew found is in the Archaearium at Historic Jamestowne. The others will be examined and cataloged by NPS with the other artifacts, then tucked away in a storage facility, available only to scholars and museums for the time being.\n\nLee has already returned to the classroom. \u201cI\u2019m in a perfect place to continue the story,\u201d he says.\n\nSlaves had a harrowing journey to America. We tell it in augmented reality. Explore\n\nValarie, who has performed Angela at Jamestown since March, is on the schedule for the rest of the fall. She will keep interpreting Angela\u2019s life as long as Historic Jamestowne needs her. Like Lee and Christine, she is invested. She has come to need Angela, too.\n\n\u201cWhen I think of Angela, I think of a powerhouse,\u201d Valarie says. \u201cA survivor.\u201d\n\nAngela\u2019s long and impossible journey, her fortitude and her survival, has a lesson for everyone. Valarie believes it is a lesson in hope and healing that supersedes the ways Americans continue to divide themselves.\n\n\u201cI have seen so much interest, so much bonding between races, between religions because of the First Africans and specifically Angela,\u201d Valarie says.\n\n\u201cThere is peace that I feel for her. ... Maybe we have all learned how far this young woman has taken us.\u201d\n\nFor such a time as this.", "description": "Angela stands out as the first enslaved woman with a name in Jamestown.
