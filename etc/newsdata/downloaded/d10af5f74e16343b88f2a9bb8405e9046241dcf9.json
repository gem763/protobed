Delta Flight 2353 was on its way from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale on Wednesday when the captain received an indicator warning of a possible depressurization issue, a spokesperson told Gizmodo by phone.\n\nAfter the issue was flagged, the response was to get the aircraft from its position of 39,000 feet down to 10,000 feet as quickly as possible. That descent lasted roughly seven to eight minutes, the Delta spokesperson said. Though it was controlled, passengers described a panicked and stressful scene inside the cabin.\n\n\u201cThe oxygen masks dropped from the top of the plane and chaos sort of ensued amongst the passengers,\u201d Harris DeWoskin, a passenger on the flight, told ABC-affiliated WSB-TV. DeWoskin described the situation as a \u201chectic moment,\u201d adding that passengers around him were hyperventilating.\n\nA brief clip captured by DeWoskin and shared to Twitter by WFTS reporter Michael Paluska shows deployed air masks hanging from the ceiling.\n\nHarris DeWoskin a passenger on Delta flight 2353 from ATL to FLL described a \u201cpanic\u201d and \u201cchaos\u201d onboard as pilots descended rapidly bc of a \u201ccabin pressurization irregularity en route.\u201d Everyone OK and bused to Fort Lauderdale.

Had an emergency midair from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale. Oxygen masks deployed and we descended quickly and we're diverted to Tampa. I texted my wife and dad I loved them. Told my mom I love her and hugged my son. @wsvn @cbs12 pic.twitter.com/C9QcU9DbYV \u2014 J.T.

The spokesperson said the incident is being investigated.\n\nAccording to flight tracker Flight Aware, the Delta plane departed Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport at roughly 3:37pm local time and following the incident diverted Tampa International Airport, where it landed at 5:12pm. Tampa is a little over an hour from Fort Lauderdale by commercial flight, or nearly four hours by car.\n\nThe Delta spokesperson told Gizmodo that the airline worked to reroute passengers according to their situation and final destination. Most passengers were bussed from Tampa to Fort Lauderdale, the spokesperson said.\n\nIn spite of the event, Tomlinson told BuzzFeed News that the flight crew expertly handled the incident, telling the site that they were \u201creal brilliant, the way they handled themselves.\u201d In a statement, Delta said it would like to \u201capologise to our customers for the inconvenience and delay.\u201d", "description": "All aboard the nightmare machine....", "authors": ["David Tracy", "David Nield"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/zw54hoslrqgstmerlg9l.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
