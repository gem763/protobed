Photo: Getty Images\n\nDemi Moore\u2019s press tour for her new memoir, Inside Out, has mostly consisted of making her ex-husbands look like a bunch of tools, but a new excerpt has, somehow, birthed a legend who\u2019s been walking among us for years: Jon Cryer, Sex Antihero. Per the New York Post, Moore wrote that Cryer lost his virginity to her while they were filming the 1984 dramedy No Small Affair, and that she somewhat regretted the events surrounding their horizontal mambo session. \u201cIt pains me to think of how callous I was with his feelings,\u201d she wrote, \u201cthat I stole what could have been such an important and beautiful moment from him.\u201d However, in an incredible moment of transparency on social media, Cryer responded that, no, he didn\u2019t actually lose his virginity to Moore \u2014 he was just, uh, pretty terrible at sex. His words, not ours.\n\n\u201cWhile I\u2019m sure she was totally justified making that assumption based on my skill level, and the stunned look on my face at the time, I had actually lost my virginity in high school,\u201d Cryer explained. \u201cBut she\u2019s right [with] the other part, I was over the moon for her during a very troubled time in her life. I have nothing but affection for her and not a regret in the world.\u201d\n\nBut she\u2019s right the other part, I was over the moon for her during a very troubled time in her life. I have nothing but affection for her and not a regret in the world. \u2014 Jon Cryer (@MrJonCryer) September 24, 2019\n\nElsewhere in the excerpt, Moore said she started dabbling in some \u201cseriously self-destructive things\u201d during that time period, which included a cocaine addiction and drinking problem. She would later go on to marry Bruce Willis, and then a cute guy from Two and a Half Men who was not Cryer.", "description": "Demi Moore said Jon Cryer lost his virginity to her, however, Cryer said this wasn\u2019t true and he was merely just bad at sex.", "authors": ["Devon Ivie"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/24/24-demi-moor-jon-cryer.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
