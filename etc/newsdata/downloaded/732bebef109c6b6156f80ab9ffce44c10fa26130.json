What we\u2019re not good at is implementing policies aimed solving them.\n\nThis was the consensus reached - ironically - at the Kgalema Motlanthe Foundation\u2019s dialogue among equals.\n\nThe Drakensberg Inclusive Growth Forum, which concludes today, is the foundation\u2019s three-day gathering of high-profile thought leaders and various stakeholders such as government, business and civil society, including the youth, to share ideas and develop action plans in response to the triple challenges of poverty, inequality and unemployment.\n\nThe second instalment of the forum focused on strengthening local government and local economies.\n\nMotlanthe said the forum was a safe space among equals and was not meant to take binding decisions on any matter. Instead, it was meant to draw valuable insights from all attendees to find solutions to some of the most pressing challenges facing the country.\n\nThe Reserve Bank\u2019s [belief] that it can only focus on inflation targeting is completely misguided. It must get involved in economic growth. It must also get involved, for instance, in the crisis we have with Eskom Solly Mapaila\n\nSpeakers at the forum included former deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas, Public Enterprises Minister Pravin Gordhan and local government minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the forum, deputy secretary-general of the South African Communist Party Solly Mapaila said there needed to be a paradigm shift in the way small businesses were viewed. The notion that doing business with them was a favour needed to be dispelled.\n\nMapaila added that state developmental banks were the key to strengthening local government and local economies. \u201cCountries like Germany don\u2019t worry about external investors, important as they are, because they have their own investment capabilities,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe Reserve Bank\u2019s [belief] that it can only focus on inflation targeting is completely misguided. It must get involved in economic growth. It must also get involved, for instance, in the crisis we have with Eskom,\u201d Mapaila said.\n\n\u201cIf we say that Eskom is the single biggest threat to the South African economy, the Reserve Bank must be able to swap that debt,\u201d he said. This would\n\ncreate a point of reprieve that would allow the country to reprioritise resources and planning.\n\nRead: Informal sector needs more support, Motlanthe\n\nFormer finance deputy minister Mcebisi Jonas said South Africans were living in an age when there was a poverty of ideas. \u201cThe usefulness of [the Inclusive Growth] forum is that it brings together significant members of South African society to reflect on how the country should be shaped,\u201d Jonas said.\n\nThe forum, he said, was broader than political parties. \u201cFor me, this is the way forward - reaching consensus across society. We need to have these kinds of conversations in provinces, in local areas, so that we have an increasing platform of views on how to grow the economy and deal with the moral decline the country is facing,\u201d Jonas said.\n\n\u201cXenophobic attacks and violence against women are like conducting sabotage against ourselves as a country. Politicians who are supposed to be saying the same thing, but say different things, are also sabotaging us.\n\n\u201c[Platforms like the Inclusive Growth Forum] help create momentum in society about what needs to be done. The important thing is that we use this to force action in government. We need to put pressure on those in government positions and hold them accountable,\u201d said Jonas.\n\nGordhan said that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) could play a critical role in inclusive growth by providing cheaper and more efficient services to communities, for example.\n\n\u201cSOEs [spend] tens of billions of rands on procurement. We want them to give opportunities to young black engineers and women, and ensure procurement happens in way that\u2019s more evenly spread and doesn\u2019t make only a few people tremendously rich,\u201d he said.\n\nGordhan added that SOEs could also play a key role in teaching young engineers what it took to run a power utility or freight company.\n\n\u201cFor SOEs to reach the point where they make a positive impact on local economies, we need to ensure that they\u2019re stabilised. These institutions have been weakened for one reason or another, including corruption, state capture or policies. We need stronger institutions that can be used by future generations,\u201d he said.\n\nTo achieve this, South Africa needed to overhaul its values. \u201cWe need to understand that it\u2019s not just about [individuals], but also also the country. We also need to continuously adapt to new technologies, new developments and new competition,\u201d said Gordhan.", "description": "The problem with South Africa is that we\u2019re really good at identifying problems and having dialogues on these issues.
