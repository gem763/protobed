Walmart just yesterday announced a new deal for grocery delivery in Canada with Cornershop, using the Cornershop app.\n\nEarlier this year, Walmart tried to buy Cornershop for $225 million, but Mexican antitrust officials blocked the deal.\n\nAs with other large tech companies, Uber has grown far beyond its origins as a ride-hailing service. It already took a step in the food delivery business through Uber Eats, which has proved to be expensive for the company.\n\nEarlier this month, the company launched Uber Works in Chicago, an app that connects gig workers with employers looking for temporary staff. Uber also has invested in electric scooters, shipping and aerial ridesharing with helicopters, which is still in the works.\n\nUber continues to expand despite struggling to make a profit. Uber's contractor-based business model is also under pressure from a California law passed in September, that would force drivers to be classified as employees.\n\nLen Sherman, an adjunct professor of business at Columbia Business School, said the announcement is yet another example of Uber trying to find new ways to engage customers despite having what he said is a broken business model.\n\nSherman said Uber should fix its core business \u2014 ridesharing \u2014 before expanding.\n\nOnce Uber acquires Cornershop, the grocery service will maintain its leadership and report to a board with majority Uber representation.\n\nCornershop was founded in 2015 and delivers groceries in Chile, Mexico, Peru and Canada. Oskar Hjertonsson, founder and CEO of Cornershop, said he hopes to bring the service to more markets around the world.", "description": "The grocery service delivers in Chile, Mexico, Peru and Canada, with plans to expand.", "authors": ["Peter Talbot"], "top_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/10/11/cornershop_press_images_03_wide-98c6df8423487b637892c7da1c2f8674a8e0220e.jpg?s=1400", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
