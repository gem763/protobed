They don't know, what's happening out there,\" Mr Trump said.\n\n\"You have people that want to get rid of those sanctuary cities, they just aren\u2019t able to do it with the people that get elected. A lot of illegal voting going on out there, by the way.\"\n\nMr Trump has repeatedly claimed millions of people voted illegally in the 2016 election, in which he lost the popular vote. But the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and policy institute, has said voter fraud is \"very rare\" and that \"most allegations of fraud turn out to be baseless\".\n\nThe president's focus on so-called sanctuary cities, a term referring to jurisdictions which limit cooperation with federal immigration law enforcement, exaggerated the dangers posed by undocumented immigrants living within them.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

It's in 2026. Gianni Infante - who is a great guy - and we announced it in front of the press, and 2026, and I said, 'Well wait a minute, under the normal rules, I'll be out in 2024, so we may have to go for an extra term'.\n\n\"Oh they go crazy,\" Mr Trump continued, referring to mainstream media outlets. \"Tomorrow you're going to see headlines, 'Trump wants an extra term I told you, I told you, He wants and extra term, he wants an extra term ladies and gentlemen'.\"\n\nThough the president appeared to cast the idea of serving three terms as a joke, he has made similar comments with increasing frequency in recent months.\n\nMr Trump had travelled to North Carolina on the eve of a special election for the large 9th congressional District, which was the subject of allegations of fraud by the victorious Republican campaign in 2018, and where officials subsequently ordered a redo.\n\nMr Trump and vice-president Mike Pence were both there to try and assure success for Mr Bishop.\n\nWhile the seat has long been held by Republicans, and while Mr Trump won North Carolina by around 12 points in 2016, Democrats hope their candidate, Mr McCready, can deliver a bloody noise, building on the party\u2019s success in the 2018 midterms and making further inroads into areas Mr Trump considers his turf.\n\nWith an eye to his own re-election next autumn, the president touted his administration\u2019s accomplishments but also urged voters to give him more time.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why we need four more years,\u201d Mr Trump said at the event that stretched for 90 minutes. \u201cIt\u2019s got to seed \u2014 it\u2019s a plant. It has to grow. It has to grow those roots. That\u2019s why 2020 is just as important. Because they will try to take it away.\u201d\n\nOpinion polling indicates a tight race, with turnout an important factor.\n\n\u201cIt was a very close race,\u201d Mr Trump said at the White House before leaving for Fayetteville. He said he believed Mr Bishop had a good chance of winning and that the contest had become \u201cless close\u201d since his own involvement began about two weeks ago. The president stressed, however, that \u201cI\u2019m not running\u201d.\n\nEarlier in the day, he had tweeted: \u201dNorth Carolina, vote for Dan Bishop tomorrow. We need him badly in Washington! His opponent is a far left sanctuary cities supporter.\u201d\n\nMr McCready, a military veteran who served in the US marine corps, hit back by saying: \u201dActually, there\u2019s one person in this race who has kept this country secure. I signed up after 9/11 to defend us in the marines and fight the terrorists & I\u2019m the only candidate who will stop your and Dan Bishop\u2019s cuts to Fort Bragg.\u201d\n\nLocal media said the president\u2019s claims that the Democrat supported sanctuary cities and open borders was not born out by evidence.\n\nThe News and Observer said while Mr McCready opposed a bill that would crack down on sanctuary policies, he has not stated support for those locations that have vowed not to support the president\u2019s immigration policies.\n\nDuring a debate with Mr Bishop, a staunch Trump supporter and social conservative, on how he would deal with migrant families at the border, he said: \u201cWe absolutely need a secure border. If some Democrats are saying we don\u2019t need a secure border, that\u2019s crazy. Now, I don\u2019t think we need 3,000 miles of wall to do it. I think we can use the type of surveillance technology I used over in Iraq,\u201d\n\nAs he introduced the president, Mr Pence claimed the administration had made major differences over the last two-and-a-half years.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump promised to rebuild the military and President Trump has done that,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has made America great again. But we need another four years to keep America great.\u201d", "description": "In a wild and at times chaotic campaign speech, Donald Trump pushed unfounded allegations\u00a0about voter fraud, launched a false attack on a Democratic congressional candidate and mused about serving more than two terms as president.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe", "Tom Embury-Dennis"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/09/20/trump-northcarolina.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
