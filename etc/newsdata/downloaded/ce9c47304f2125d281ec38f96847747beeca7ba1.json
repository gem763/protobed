I took a screenshot of my bank account as motivation and made it my personal goal to have $1 million in assets in five years.\"\n\nHe landed a digital marketing job that paid $50,000 a year, but \"quickly realized this just wasn't going to be enough money. I wasn't going to be able to get ahead making this and saving 5% to 10% of my income.\"\n\nGrant's solution was to start a side hustle building websites. \"The first website I built was a $300 one for a law firm,\" he tells CNBC. \"That law firm ended up recommending me to another law firm, and in six months, I went from charging $300 per engagement to $5,000.\"\n\nWithin a year, he sold his first $100,000 project and decided to quit his full-time job to focus on growing his consulting business. Five years after taking the screenshot of his $2.26 balance, Grant hit seven-figures.\n\n\n\nIn a post on his blog, Grant, who now lives in Chicago with his wife, outlines the five steps he took that helped him turn $2.26 into $1 million. \"I can't guarantee that you will have the same results, but if you follow even just a few of these steps, you are likely going to be much better off financially than you are today,\" he writes.\n\n1. Get paid what you're worth \"The number one thing that will dictate your future earning potential and get you to $1 million the fastest is how much money you are being paid today,\" Grant writes. \"Unfortunately, you probably aren't being paid what you are worth.\"\n\nThe simplest way to boost your earning potential is to ask for a raise. Grant recommends looking at the salary range for someone with your level of experience in your industry, which will help you understand what you're worth. Then take that information to your boss and emphasize what you bring to the company. Remember, \"it doesn't hurt to ask,\" he tells CNBC. \"A lot of people are ultimately afraid that people are going to say no, and so they undervalue themselves and they undervalue their services.\"\n\n\n\n2. Save a ton of money \u2026 and put it to work \"In order to build wealth you need to be making as much money as possible on your money,\" Grant writes. \"Because you can only make so much money at any career, investing is truly the key to wealth. \"\n\nDuring his five-year journey to seven figures, Grant saved 50% of his income. Today, despite his financial success, he still focuses on living simply and sets aside 40% to 50%.\n\nThe key, Grant says, is to make things automatic: \"Talk to your HR company and have them start depositing at least 20% of your income directly into an investment account before you even see it. This is 20% of your income AFTER contributing to your 401(k). I have mine automatically deposited directly into my Vanguard investment account and the money then gets automatically invested into a mixture of index funds. \"\n\n\n\n3. Develop multiple streams of income\n\nAfter you've maximized your earning potential and are saving a good chunk of your salary, focus on increasing your revenue streams, by finding a part-time job, starting a side hustle or establishing passive income.\n\n\"If your goal to build wealth you need to master the side hustle and make money other ways than just your full-time job,\" Grant writes. \"This can really be anything, including driving for Uber, consulting, or building websites on the side.\"\n\nOnce you start making money from your side gig, invest 100% of the profits, says Grant: \"Once you find a great side gig, you will be tempted to spend that money in your everyday life as your bank account grows \u2014 but I strongly recommend you think of your side hustle as a key to building wealth (over the long term) instead of just being rich today.\"\n\n\n\n4. Invest in what you know\n\nWhile Grant is a big believer in simple index fund investing, he allocates 20% of his investment capital towards individual companies like Apple, Amazon and Google. If you're going to invest in individual companies, go with what's familiar, he says: \"Look at the products you use and consume every day; then research the fundamentals of those companies so you can learn more about their investment potential.\"\n\nIt's a strategy that investing legend Warren Buffett lives by. The billionaire only invests in companies that are within his \"circle of competence,\" a concept he first described in his 1996 Shareholder Letter.\n\nSimply put, stick to what you know. \"Defining what your game is \u2014 where you're going to have an edge \u2014 is enormously important,\" Buffett says. Once you've done that, buy and hold.\n\n", "description": "Grant of Millennial Money went from having $2.26 in his bank account to $1 million.", "authors": ["Kathleen Elkins"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/104287574-grant_millennial_money.jpg?v=1529474247"}
