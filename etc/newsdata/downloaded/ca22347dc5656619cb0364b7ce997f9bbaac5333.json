Immediately recognisable as the spoilt brat who never grew up, but achieved his boyish \u00adambition to be the 20th Old Etonian in No10.\n\n(Image: AFP via Getty Images)\n\nWood, writing in a recent London Review of Books, identifies the Eton mantra of \u201ceffortless superiority\u201d behind a Brexit madness casually instituted, secretly engineered and noisily bolstered by a cabal of old Etonians born between 1963 and 1975, the year we joined the Common Market.\n\nPhew! So we are leaving Europe because a gang of toffs who never wanted for anything \u2013 and never will \u2013 decided that should be the nation\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cCameron, Johnson and Rees-Mogg belong to the same world,\u201d says Wood.\n\n\u201cA world of extreme wealth where there has never been any decline for them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a pity we had to wait until now, when it\u2019s too late, for this candid \u00adexposure of life at the top to emerge.\n\nIf the car workers of Sunderland and Swindon had known what was planned for them, they might have voted \u00addifferently in the referendum.\n\nThe Yeti \u2013 the Abominable No-Man \u2013 stalking Westminster could have been stopped in his big-foot tracks.\n\nDaily Mirror news online", "description": "Let me tell you what my source thinks about his contemporary Alexander de Pfeffel Johnson, who trades under the name of Boris", "authors": ["Paul Routledge", "Image", "Getty", "Afp Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20551981.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Eton-College.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
