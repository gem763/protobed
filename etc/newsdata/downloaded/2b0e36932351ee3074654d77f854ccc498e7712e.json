Police had been watching garbage deposits from a certain part of the city, he said.\n\nSmith said police were obtaining murder warrants against two people previously identified as persons of interest in the case, 39-year-old Patrick Devone Stallworth and his 29-year-old girlfriend, Derick Irisha Brown.\n\nThis undated file photo provided by the Birmingham Police Department shows Patrick Devone Stallworth.
