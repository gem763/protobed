Alexander Gustafsson at UFC 165: Best photos view 12 images\n\nAlexander Gustafsson gave arguably the toughest challenge of light heavyweight champion Jon Jones\u2019 career, and it wasn\u2019t enough.\n\nGustafsson (18-6 MMA, 10-6 UFC), a currently retired three-time light heavyweight title challenger, has fought Jones (25-1 MMA, 19-1 UFC) twice. And he doesn\u2019t see anyone in the division dethroning him for now.\n\n\u201cTill now, I am not certain there is someone to beat him,\u201d Gustafsson told MMA Junkie. \u201cBut like with everything, there will come somebody.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Mauler\u201d took it to Jones like nobody ever had when he challenged for the 205-pound title in 2013. He lost a unanimous decision at UFC 165 in a fight in which he bloodied and battered Jones.\n\nIt was the first time anyone took it to Jones like that and was a fight that many thought Gustafsson won. The two met again five years later at UFC 232, but Jones was able to control Gustafsson with his grappling and took him out in the third round.\n\nWith new names like Johnny Walker and Dominick Reyes emerging at light heavyweight, as well as former middleweight champions Luke Rockhold and Chris Weidman moving up, Gustafsson thinks that should he decide to return, he has some work to do.\n\n\u201cThe division is really interesting now, as there are lot of young guns coming up in the rankings \u2013 and also middleweights moving up,\u201d Gustafsson said. \u201cIt is really interesting times now. So we old dogs needs to work harder.\u201d\n\nJones is coming off a split decision win over Thiago Santos in July at UFC 239. He didn\u2019t take much damage, but the fight was tightly contested. And while some thought Jones lost the fight, Gustafsson thought the champion got the job done.\n\n\u201cI thought Jones won, but he only did enough to win like he has always done lately,\u201d Gustafsson said. \u201cBut that is also the sign of a champion.\u201d", "description": "Alexander Gustafsson doesn't think anyone currently in the light heavyweight division can beat Jon Jones.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Matt Erickson", "The Blue Corner", "Simon Head", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Ken Hathaway", "Mmajunkie Staff"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/alexander-gustafsson-jon-jones-ufc-165.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
