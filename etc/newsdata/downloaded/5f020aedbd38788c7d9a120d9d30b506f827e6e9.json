We spent 582 days dreaming of this moment. We\u2019re still in shock and trying to process our emotions,\u201d he said.\n\nForeign Minister Chrystia Freeland tweeted she was relieved by the news. Canada had worked behind the scenes to press for Mombeini\u2019s release, said a Canadian government official.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to the Canadian government, and specifically Foreign Minister Freeland for their unwavering support from day one. We are also thankful to Iran for allowing our mother ... to finally leave,\u201d Raam said by email.\n\nMombeini returned just five days after Iranian authorities freed an Australian couple who spent more than three months in a prison in Tehran.\n\nThe Canadian government official said Mombeini\u2019s release had removed a \u201cbig obstacle\u201d to the process of improving relations.\n\nCanada cut all diplomatic ties with Iran in 2012.\n\n\u201cWe had had a couple of visits of Iranian officials here and we had visited there a couple of times as part of seeking some level of re-engagement and we put that all on ice after she was subject to the travel ban,\u201d said the official, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation.\n\nBilateral ties between Iran and Canada worsened in 2003 when an Iranian-Canadian photo journalist, Zahra Kazemi, died in Tehran\u2019s Evin prison while in custody.", "description": "Iran has released the wife of an Iranian-Canadian environmental activist who died in a Tehran prison after it barred her from leaving the country for 18 months, her family and Canadian officials said on Friday.", "authors": ["David Ljunggren", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
