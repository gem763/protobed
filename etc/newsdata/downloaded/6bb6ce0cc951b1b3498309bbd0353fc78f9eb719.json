I said before, is it allowed that Sheffield United fight more than us? No it isn\u2019t.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

No. We can play better. I don\u2019t think we had an off-day.\u201d\n\nIn truth Liverpool laboured for 70 minutes and it required a huge stroke of luck courtesy of Dean Henderson\u2019s handling error to make the breakthrough.\n\nThe on-loan Manchester United goalkeeper was left embarrassed after allowing Georginio Wijnaldum\u2019s shot to slip through his hands and then his legs before creeping over the line.\n\nIt allowed Liverpool to extend their winning run to 16 league matches but Klopp knows they were fortunate.\n\n\u201cWe had our moments and we started well but then lost the rhythm. It was really difficult, we didn\u2019t accelerate in the right moments. Our passes had not the right speed,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cAll respect to Sheffield United, they did really well over 95 minutes. They have a proper basis to be a really uncomfortable opponent.\n\n\u201cWe still had big chances. Unlucky for Sheffield United. If it had been a draw, I would say that is what Sheffield deserved and we deserved.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we deserved to lose. We got three points and we are pretty happy.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Liverpool\u00a0manager Jurgen Klopp took a tongue-in-cheek swipe at title rivals Manchester City by claiming he would rather win eight matches 1-0 than beat a side 8-0.
