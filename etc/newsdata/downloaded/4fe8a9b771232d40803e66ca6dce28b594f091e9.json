There may not be an actual war threat currently but there\u2019s always a risk when you\u2019re in these dangerous places.\n\n\u201cAnd it can be extra worrying when you aren\u2019t able to communicate for periods of time... But it won\u2019t be easy watching him go away, and I will worry until I see him again.\u201d\n\n(Image: SOPA Images/LightRocket via Gett)\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nHowever, Kym confessed saying goodbye to Coronation Street wasn't all bad news.\n\nThe soap star, who played Michelle for 14 years, celebrated she would be able to devote more time focusing on things she enjoys and seeing her family.\n\nViewers will see Michelle on-screen for the last time in the lead up to Christmas.\n\nBut the actress insisted she had no plans on slowing down after her exit.\n\nShe added to the newspaper: \u201cA bonus of leaving Coronation Street might be that I get to spend more time enjoying the other things in my life \u2014 the filming schedules can be very fast paced and you spend a lot of time there \u2014 but I\u2019m not planning on slowing down, there are loads of new things that I want to do.\"", "description": "Kym waves goodbye to her character Michelle Connor on Corrie and her army beau Scott as he goes on tour", "authors": ["Lily Waddell", "Image", "Mirror.Co.Uk", "Getty Images", "Sopa Images Lightrocket Via Gett", "Itv"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20528642.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Kym-Marsh-attending-the-ITV-Summer-Party-2019-at-Nobu.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
