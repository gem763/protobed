It also allows for biometric authentication across physical and digital channels, including mobile.\n\nThe multi-year contract will also see Unisys provide service desk support for the existing facial image capture system, case management software, and deliver field services to support TMR service centres across the state.\n\nSee also: Why Australia is quickly developing a technology-based human rights problem (TechRepublic)\n\nAccording to Unisys, Queensland was the first state in the country to introduce a smart card licence that uses biometrics to verify a person's identity when applying for or renewing a driver licence, marine licence, industry accreditation, or industry accreditation.\n\nUnisys has worked with TMR since 2009, during which time it said 4.5 million driver licence applications had been issued.\n\nThe government last week announced a trial of digital licences, with Maryborough and Hervey Bay the first communities to trial the initiative.\n\nAvailable through a smartphone app, it will initially include learner licences, recreational marine licences, and photo identification cards, with the government saying it could expand to other licences at a later stage.\n\nThe government in October said it was \"well on the way\" in the development of a digital identification for the state, announcing at the time locals could soon have the option to store their driver licences digitally on their mobile devices.\n\nMaking the ID available on a smartphone won't see physical cards phased out, however.\n\nThe state isn't the first to head down the digital licence route. New South Wales kicked off a metro trial last November and South Australians have had the option to hold digital driver's licences on their phones since September 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, Unisys was in July awarded a three-year contract valued at approximately AU$16.48 million to design, build, and manage new cloud infrastructure and upgrade the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's (BOM) wide area network to support current weather services.\n\nFor the 2018 financial year, the local arm of Unisys posted AU$10 million in after tax profit, on revenue of AU$239.5 million.\n\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nHome Affairs exempt from disclosing Face Identification Service provider\n\nThe newly minted department has purchased a facial recognition algorithm, but it won't be disclosing from where after receiving immunity from Commonwealth procurement rules.\n\nNSW looks to biometric payments and Netflix-like public transport subscriptions\n\nPaying for transport like shopping at Amazon Go and the 'death' of the timetable as 'mobility-as-a-service' becomes the new way to travel in Sydney.\n\nNEC Australia takes ACIC to court over biometric identification project\n\nThe ACIC cancelled the delivery of the biometric identification services project in June 2018, after the system had been substantially built and testing was already underway.\n\nThe growing legal and regulatory implications of collecting biometric data\n\nAlthough biometric technologies make the authentication experience easier, the actual collection and storage of the data is presenting new security risks.", "description": "The new biometric facial image processing solution is hoping to prevent fraudulent licences from entering rotation in the state.", "authors": ["Asha Barbaschow"], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2018/10/24/c8bd2871-e6ec-495c-a2c0-96dc8baa7e87/thumbnail/770x578/1ffe30eab472e40abe31820f57d59c16/queensland-adult-proof-of-age.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
