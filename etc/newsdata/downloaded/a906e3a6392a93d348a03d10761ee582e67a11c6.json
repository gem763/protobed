And in the parking lot before the game.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising. Brown was a nonstop headache after the Raiders traded for him and gave him a raise. While it\u2019s hard to believe Brown masterminded a devious plot over the summer to land in New England, it also seems possible he knew he had a golden parachute in his final hours with the Raiders when he demanded his release. No matter what, his lack of professionalism will be his Raiders legacy.\n\nWe\u2019ll remember Brown\u2019s time with the Raiders, and not for any good reason. Raiders fans certainly aren\u2019t going to forget.\n\nRaiders fans aren't happy with Antonio Brown.
