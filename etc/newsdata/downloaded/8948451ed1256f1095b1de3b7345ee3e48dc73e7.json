Clandestine audio of him admitting Steven Gerrard was a far better midfielder for England than him?\n\nThe conspiracy theories, about why Frank Lampard handed a start to Ross Barkley against Newcastle, were rife before kick off. He must have something juicy on his boss.\n\nIn reality, Lampard had few other options. There was no N\u2019Golo Kante, and Mateo Kovacic\u2019s fitness was only so-so. As a result, Barkley had to step up.\n\nChelsea midfielder was forced to come off injured before half time with an injury complaint\n\nYet this was a poor audition and disappointing day all round for the 25-year-old midfielder.\n\nAfter scoring twice in England\u2019s 6-0 annihilation of Bulgaria, he forced his way back into Lampard\u2019s team then was forced off with what appeared a minor injury.\n\nHe attempted 21 passes, managed an accuracy of 81 per cent, zero shots, zero chances created. Defence-wise, he committed a total of three tackles and one interception.\n\nStarring alongside Jorginho in a 4-3-3 set-up is an important job. With Mason Mount pushing so far forward, you have to help in providing protection.\n\nThe former Everton star failed to have a shot and created nothing for his Chelsea teammates\n\nMason Mount's excellent form this season has seen him go above Barkley in the pecking order\n\nIf you fail to do so, opponents can do damage on the counter-attack. Here, Newcastle got men behind the ball, then flew forward using Allan Saint-Maximin.\n\nBarkley had to get that balance right, and he roamed forward plenty. Perhaps too much, as Jorginho appeared isolated and Chelsea stretched at times.\n\nLampard is a fan of Barkley\u2019s attack-mindedness, however. As he said this week: \u2018I am loving his arrival into the box. He knows that it is competitive here for a place in midfield.\n\n\u2019One thing I have found from working with Ross is that he really wants to learn and improve.\u2019\n\nBarkley impressed for England during their 6-0 win over Bulgaria and bagged a brace\n\nThere remains room for improvement with Barkley.\n\nHe was one of five English players named in a Chelsea XI for a Premier League match for the first time since February 2013 \u2013 in a 3-2 loss to Newcastle.\n\nOne of the others, Mount, is already ahead of him in the pecking order. Barkley has a job on his hands if he is to work his way into Lampard\u2019s XI regularly.", "description": "KIERAN GILL AT STAMFORD BRIDGE: Lampard had few other options.
