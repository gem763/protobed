In the shots, Hargitay is showing lots of skin, including some killer abs.\n\n\"It's very Wonder Woman-y,\" she said of the look.\n\nView photos Late Night With Seth Meyers More\n\nView photos Late Night With Seth Meyers More\n\nView photos Late Night With Seth Meyers More\n\nShe went on to explain that the film was shot in Australia and the shooting schedule came very close to the holidays.\n\n\"I was so excited because I was going to Australia to play this queen. I get there, hair, makeup, prosthetic pieces, walking around like that feeling pretty good,\" she recalled. \"I was there for November, and then December and then we were getting closer to Christmas and they had me on hold a lot and finally from Dec. 21, I said, 'Hey guys, this is great, but you kept me on hold too long.' It's Christmas! I think that's only fair.\"\n\nSo Hargitay flew home to celebrate with her family and when she called the team back in the new year, she didn't receive the most welcome response.\n\n\"They're like, 'Sweetie, you're good, don't worry about it.' And they fired me!\" she said, jokingly adding, \"I watch my P's and Q's on SVU now.\"\n\nHargitay was replaced by actress Gabrielle Fitzpatrick in the role, but seems to be doing just fine for herself. SVU is now the longest-running scripted drama on TV, passing Gunsmoke and Law & Order this year.\n\nFor more from Hargitay, watch the clip below:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nMariska Hargitay Admits She Was 'Nervous' About Meeting Ice-T When He Joined 'Law & Order: SVU'\n\nMariska Hargitay Reflects on Playing Olivia Benson for 20 Years (Exclusive)\n\nMariska Hargitay Is \u2018Fulfilled\u2019 Playing Olivia Benson for 20 Years on 'SVU'\n\nRelated Articles:", "description": "We can't get over her abs!", "authors": ["Rachel Mcrady"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8vsogOUrccTNSOGvK0jLKA--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/37329448b9ce48aba84d06a71e59a075", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
