It had previously backed a similar resolution put to the AGM of AGL, which has a slower exit planned for its coal power generators.\n\nCGI Glass Lewis said it didn't believe Market Forces had provided clear evidence that Origin had neglected climate risks or acted egregiously.\n\n\"In light of the company's already extensive disclosure of its climate-related considerations and actions as well as its plans to withdraw from coal-fired power generation by 2032, we do not find the adoption of this proposal, as worded, to be necessary or that its adoption would necessarily benefit the company or its shareholders,\" it said.\n\n\"It does not appear that the company's current goals are out of alignment with the broader goals set forth by the Australian government nor do we have any reason to believe that the company would not adopt more stringent emissions reductions should federal or state regulations require it to do so.\"\n\nOn Origin's fracking plans in the Beetaloo Basin in the NT, where the rebel shareholders are questioning whether it has secured proper informed consent from Indigenous groups, CGI Glass Lewis said it did not require a review.\n\nISS said it was satisfied with the information Origin had provided on the consent process it went through with Indigenous groups for the work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOrigin late last week started drilling the Kyalla 117 well at its Beetaloo project, the first drilling of unconventional oil and gas resources in the NT since the territory government scrapped a moratorium on fracking last year.\n\nOn industry associations, CGI Glass Lewis said Origin's board was best placed to determine whether memberships benefited shareholders. But it called on Origin to better explain how it came to the conclusion that its review of memberships didn't find significant differences in positions on climate change.\n\nCGI Glass Lewis also voiced caution on over-commitment risks around Mr Cairns and director Catherine Brenner, but noted their perfect attendance record at board and committee meetings. ISS said Mr Cairns' 12-year tenure as a director meant it now regarded him as non-independent but it still backed his re-election.\n\nThe Australian Shareholders' Association, which represents retail shareholders, also said it would vote shares in line with board recommendations on all the resolutions.", "description": "CGI Glass Lewis and ISS Corporate Governance have declined to back a call for Eraring power station to be closed two years early", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.211%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_64/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/d4d608f1e0b66c9e955e6f38420339ac47d124d8", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
