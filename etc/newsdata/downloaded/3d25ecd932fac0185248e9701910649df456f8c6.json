The idea was that any opposition to the government is a betrayal of the state\u2014that there is no such thing as a \u201cloyal opposition.\u201d\n\nAs I wrote on Tuesday, the beginning of a formal impeachment inquiry should strengthen Congress\u2019s hand as it seeks court enforcement of its demands for information. But should Congress even pursue such requests? Laurence Tribe, a professor at Harvard Law School, (whose recent book, To End a Presidency, co-written with Joshua Matz, explores many political and legal aspects of impeachment) told me in an email:\n\nThe expectation that the evidence thereby made available will be explosive makes the impeachment process more difficult in circumstances like this, where the publicly known facts already justify a conclusion that the president committed high crimes and misdemeanors. That creates something of a paradox. The way in which a formal impeachment inquiry makes potentially incriminating evidence much more readily available tends to raise expectations and indirectly raises the bar for what it takes to impeach a president who abuses his powers for personal gain.\n\nRead more from 1867: The causes for which a president can be impeached\n\nIn other words, what the public already knows is sufficient grounds for impeachment, and trying for more might backfire. If doing so creates an expectation\u2014similar to Mueller fever before the special counsel\u2019s report was issued in April\u2014compliance could produce an anticlimactic result that would lead to impeachment fatigue and claims by Trump that he has been \u201ctotally exonerated.\u201d In addition, many of the requests pending in court now have nothing to do with Ukraine\u2014and while they are impeachment-related, that blurring of the focus may be a problem.\n\nThe Ukraine narrative is simple and clean: The executive branch\u2019s own account of the phone call shows him attempting to enlist foreign interference in an election. That is a high crime and misdemeanor. And perhaps less is more: To adopt other articles of impeachment might simply confuse the issue. Congress already has enough to go forward. In this analysis, the remedy for administration stonewalling is a new article of impeachment\u2014like the one adopted by the House Judiciary Committee in 1974 after Richard Nixon rejected its request for the key White House tapes.", "description": "The rule of law is being shattered, but Congress does have what it needs.", "authors": ["Garrett Epps", "Professor Of Constitutional Law At The University Of Baltimore"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/AP_19262642139698/facebook.jpg?1570039312"}
