Ron DeSantis would not say whether he supports making it easier for Bahamas citizens to relocate to the United States in the aftermath of Hurricane Dorian, which ravaged a portion of the archipelago and has been blamed for at least 44 deaths.\n\nDeSantis on Monday refused to weigh in on a request by U.S. Sens. Marco Rubio and Rick Scott that President Donald Trump ease visa requirements for Bahamas citizens with relatives living in the U.S. All four of the elected officials are Republican.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got to figure out how they are going to do the immigration stuff,\u201d DeSantis said. Neither Trump or the Bahamian government want to facilitate \u201ca big migration\u201d, he added, given that part of the island chain escaped serious damage.\n\nThe state has long had a close relationship to the Bahamas and an estimated 20,000 Bahamians live in south Florida. Parts of the island chain are roughly 50 miles east of the Florida coast.\n\nDorian leveled homes and left thousands without power as the storm churned through the region.\n\nOn Sunday night, more than 100 evacuees who did not have travel visas to enter the U.S. were kicked off a ferry bound for Fort Lauderdale. Federal officials blamed the ferry company for the boarding confusion. Other evacuees have been able to enter Florida with a valid passport and proof of a clean criminal record.\n\nScott on Monday called on U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Bahamian government to work together to clarify rules regarding travel visas.\n\n\u201cAs hundreds of thousands of Bahamians seek refuge or start to rebuild after Hurricane Dorian, we cannot have the kind of confusion that occurred last night in Freeport,\u201d Scott said in a written statement.\n\nDeSantis, Scott and Rubio accompanied the U.S. Coast Guard on a trip to the Bahamas last week. In remarks to reporters following a press conference at Florida State University Monday, DeSantis grew agitated when asked about whether the state was doing enough to help the Bahamas.\n\nHe called the question \u201cridiculous\u201d and said it was not Florida\u2019s job to help out a foreign country. That role falls to the federal government, he said.\n\nState Rep. Shevrin Jones, a West Park Democrat with family living in the Bahamas, said he did not understand DeSantis\u2019s recalcitrance. People from the island nation just need help dealing with the storm\u2019s aftermath and have no desire to remain in the U.S., he said.\n\n\u201cBahamians come here, they shop here, they go back home,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThey are just looking for help.\u201d\n\nDeSantis, a former congressman from northeast Florida, was elected governor with the help of Trump. One of his priorities during his first year in office was to push legislation to crack down on cities that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.", "description": "The Florida governor says the U.S. needs to avoid \"a big migration.\"", "authors": ["Gary Fineout"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/95/94/86ba028f45fb9ca283a9b0f8cd40/ap-19252576251587-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
