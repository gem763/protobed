Seizures can be fatal, too.\u201d\n\nCancer Research UK urged the Government to urgently tell patients and medical staff their plans to deal with any sudden break in the supply of drugs.\n\nThe group\u2019s Emlyn Samuel said: \u201cAll cancer treatments are vital and any delay would be unacceptable.\u201d\n\nThere are also fears supplies of \u00adradioisotopes, needed to run scanners, could be hit. It means \u00addiagnosis of cancers, heart problems and other fatal diseases could be missed.\n\nAnd with a shortage of Hormone Replacement Therapy drugs already gripping Britain, a break in supplies from abroad could hit millions of women suffering the crippling effects of the menopause.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nThe British Medical Association\u2019s Dr Farah Jameel said: \u201cThe \u00admenopause can be a very difficult time for women, so it\u2019s essential they have access to the \u00admedication they need, \u00adparticularly as we head into winter.\n\n\"This is when pressure on NHS is most intense and \u00aduncertainty grows around the fallout of a \u00adpotential no-deal Brexit.\u201d\n\nAntidepressant drug Prozac is also in short supply.\n\nStephen Buckley, of the charity Mind, said: \u201cPeople with mental health problems who use medication to help manage their \u00adsymptoms often rely on a range of treatments. We would urge the Government to particularly prioritise medicines with a short shelf life.\u201d\n\nHaemophilia Society chief executive Liz Carroll added: \u201cPeople living with haemophilia rely on a clotting factor.\n\n\u201cWithout it, some would face the danger of life-threatening bleeds.\u201d\n\nCrohn\u2019s and Colitis UK chief \u00adexecutive Sarah Sleet said \u201ceasy access to drugs and treatments\u201d was essential for sufferers.\n\nShe added: \u201cWithout them patients can get very ill and may need surgery unnecessarily.\u201d \u00adThe National Audit Office warned supplies of medicines crossing the Channel could be reduced to between 40% and 60% of current levels on the first day of Brexit. Almost three million packs of drugs arrive in the UK via the ports.\n\nPharmaceutical firms and the \u00adGovernment have a list of at-risk drugs which is being kept top secret to avoid alarming the public.\n\nBut there are fears even a short period of delay could prove fatal.\n\n(Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto)\n\nThe Nuffield Trust said there are \u00ad\u201cthousands of drugs in this category\u201d. The health thinks tank\u2019s Mark\u200b Dayan added: \u201cThe most difficult areas might be those where different drugs are used and patients cannot simply be safely switched between them. Epilepsy medication would be an example of this. And \u00adchemotherapy.\u201d\n\nBut he warned patients against stockpiling their own medicines.\n\nMr Dayan said: \u201cThis can only make things worse because the most vulnerable who rely on the communal stockpile are likely to lose out.\u201d\n\nIn August, health unions issued a joint letter warning no-deal would be a disaster for patients. It said it would \u201ccause significant disruption to the supply of medicine, lasting up to six months\u201d. The letter added: \u201cThese kinds of delays can be fatal.\u201d\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said: \u201cWe understand the concerns of those who require \u00admedications in their daily lives and want to reassure them we are doing everything \u00adappropriate so they can access the medicines they need.\u201d\n\nThe Haemophiliac\n\nClive Smith has to inject himself with factor VIII clotting agent three times a week to stop internal bleeds.\n\nThe 38-year-old barrister from Ilkley, West Yorks, said: \u201cWhen it comes to the border I would hope that medicines come first. Without medication my joints would start to swell after a couple of days and could cause permanent damage. I\u2019d struggle to go to work or live my daily life.\n\n\u201cThere is a risk to life because if I fell and hit my head I could suffer an internal bleed. My message to the Government is please don\u2019t play politics with our lives.\u201d\n\nThe epilepsy victim\n\nNicola Davies\u2019s daughter Emma is severely epileptic and has severe learning disabilities.\n\nEmma, 37, lives in a home in Chalfont Saint Peter, Bucks. She takes a concoction of drugs of varying dosages to control her seizures.\n\nNicola said: \u201cEmma has uncontrolled epilepsy. It is extraordinarily worrying for us.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely vital they have a continuous supply of this medication. These seizures can be fatal if we can\u2019t bring her out of them.\u201d\n\nThe colitis sufferer\n\n(Image: FABimages Photography)\n\nNancy Greig, 42, has ulcerative colitis and has had her colon removed. The mum of one said: \u201cI wear a bag and I couldn\u2019t leave my bathroom if they run out of supplies of this product.\u201d\n\nThe health service project manager from Ayre, South Ayreshire, said: \u201cOne in four people with ulcerative colitis have this [a bag]. Shortages would make us prisoners in our own homes.\n\n\u201cI have real concerns about these products being manufactured outside the UK.\u201d\n\nHospitals booking hotels so staff can get in amid chaos\n\nHospitals are booking hotel rooms for staff so they can get to work in the event of a no-deal Brexit causing travel chaos.\n\nMaidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust has made bookings across its area and East Kent NHS Trust has rooms in place for the fortnight after October 31. Neither would confirm how many rooms are booked or for how many staff. Maidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust said the move would \u201censure we can run our services safely and effectively under all conditions\u201d.\n\nEast Kent Hospitals Trust said: \u201cWe have booked a small number of hotel rooms close to our emergency hospitals as a precautionary measure.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, Kent Community Health Foundation Trust is making plans for staff to sleep at work. And South East Coast Ambulance Service is looking into accommodation for drivers and paramedics.", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: A Mirror probe reveals feared medicine shortages will put thousands of lives at risk if Britain crashes out of the EU", "authors": ["Martin Bagot", "Image", "Getty Images Istockphoto", "Fabimages Photography"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20441277.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_JS194685459.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
