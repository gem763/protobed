I am ready whenever the decision of the manager is to play me.\u2019\n\nMORE: Unai Emery says he agreed Mesut Ozil exile with Arsenal top brass", "description": "Hector Bellerin has backed Arsenal to get over their frustrating start to the season and insists 'everyone' at the club 'trusts' Unai Emery.
