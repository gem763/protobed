Bella also came second behind Scarlett Johansson for the positioning of her eyes.\n\n'Beyonc\u00e9 ran her a close second, scoring the highest marks for the shape of her face (99.6%) and getting very high scores for her eyes, brow area and lips.\n\n'These brand new computer mapping techniques allow us to solve some of the mysteries of what it is that makes someone physically beautiful and the technology is useful when planning patients' surgery.'\n\nThe Golden Ratio was a mathematical equation devised by the Greeks in an attempt to measure beauty.\n\nWomen with the most beautiful features Dr Julian De Silva pinpointed which stars had the most beautiful nose, eyes, eyebrows, chin, lips, forehead and face shape Nose - Amber Heard 99.7 per cent Eyes - Scarlett Johansson 99.9 per cent Lips - Cara Delevingne 98.5 per cent Eyebrows - Cara Delevingne 94 per cent Chin - Bella Hadid 99.7 per cent Forehead - Kate Moss 98.8 per cent Face shape - Beyonc\u00e9 99.6 per cent\n\nThe ratio can be applied to anything and was used by Leonardo Da Vinci for the perfect human male body in his famous work, the Vitruvian Man.
