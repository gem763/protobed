And according to United Kingdom visa company MoveUp, there was a 22% increase in emigration to the UK in the last two years, with 2018 serving a record breaking year for emigrations.\n\nEmigration options for South Africans are fairly limited, though. Most countries require special skills applied towards applications for specific jobs, or for the applicants to dig deep into ancestral histories.\n\nBut when it comes to Malta, the applicants only need to provide cash, lots of it. Unlike ancestral visas, the process of obtaining Maltese residency or citizenship via investment is relatively quick, and awarded largely without prejudice after a due diligence process.\n\nAnd this is the route many high-net-worth South Africans appear to be following.\n\nThe Maltese government offers both residency and citizenship programmes, which require applicants to spend and invest millions. Each offer the right to live and work in Malta, easy access into the Schengen Zone as a traveller, and in the case of citizenship, it\u2019s also possible to live and work anywhere in the European Union.\n\nAccording to residence and citizenship company LIO Global, the application process is relatively straightforward - but it requires applicants to invest a significant amount of cash, or purchase or rent properties in order to obtain residency.\n\nCitizenship requires both cash investments and a property purchase or rental, and a significantly higher non-refundable \u201cdonation\u201d to the Maltese government.\n\nHere's what South Africans pay, in rand equivalent terms, for residency or citizenship in Malta:\n\nThe cheap route: R490,000 excluding investments starting at R4.1 million.\n\nThe cheapest way to get a Maltese passport is to purchase residency, though even this doesn\u2019t come cheap.\n\nIn order to get a Maltese passport via the Malta Residency and Visa Program, South Africans need to pay a non-refundable deposit of approximately R90,000 before anything is confirmed.\n\nIf successful, the applicant must then pay an additional flat fee of approximately R400,000.\n\nThe direct investment route requires applicants to put at least R4.1 million into government bonds, and leave it untouched for a minimum of five years.\n\nAnother way to gain Maltese residency is to purchase or rent property, either in Malta or on the island of Gozo.\n\nIn order to qualify, purchased property must have a minimum value of around R5.2 million. The minimum property price in Gozo is slightly less - there, applicants will need to spend a minimum R4.4 million.\n\nIf renting, applicants must commit to an annual rental in Malta worth approximately R200,000. In Gozo, the annual rental amount must be approximately R165,000.\n\nResidency status doesn\u2019t require applicants to remain in Malta, and the entire process can be completed in just two physical trips, one to sign the application in the presence of a commissionaire of oaths, and another to submit the residency permit. After this, and the financial commitments, the applicant can enjoy all the benefits from abroad.\n\nThe process is also relatively quick - the Maltese government typically turns these applications around in under six months.\n\nThe expensive route: R10.6 million rand excluding investments starting at R2.5 million.\n\nAfter the success of the residency programme, the Maltese government added a way to purchase citizenship, under the Individual Investor Program.\n\nThis comes with the added benefit of European citizenship, which means successful applicants can live, work or travel to any countries in the European Union.\n\nAs both Malta and South Africa allow for dual citizenship, this programme means South Africans can retain their South African citizenship, too.\n\nMaltese citizenship comes at a significant price, though.\n\nApplicants who pass the due diligence process must make a contribution totally R10.6 million to the country\u2019s National Development Fund.\n\nSpouses and children under 18 who wish to join must pay an additional R408,000 each. And unmarried, financially dependent children between the age of 18 and 26 are also welcome - at a cost of R816,000 each.\n\nThe programme also requires a five year financial investment of approximately R2.5 million, which is returnable.\n\nApplicants must satisfy some degree of legal residency, and purchase or rent property. If purchasing a property, the applicant must spend at least R5.7 million, and hold onto it for five years.\n\nThe applicant can also rent a property for a minimum of five years, instead of buying. This must have a minimum annual value of at least R260,000.\n\nNeither of these properties can be rented out during the five year period.\n\nThe application process for citizenship takes approximately one year to finalise. Once approved, applicants must make at least two visits to Malta - including a stay of between two and three weeks during the first year.\n\nReceive a daily email with all our latest news: click here.\n\nAlso from Business Insider South Africa:", "description": "The popular \"Plan B\" passport doesn't come cheap.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7956/1743569a32dd4b3c859f5070b5259aa6.png", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
