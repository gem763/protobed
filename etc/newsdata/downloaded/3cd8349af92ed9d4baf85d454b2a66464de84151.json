To be considered, companies interested in purchasing \u201cSpot\u201d must explain how they would use the device to aid their business, or possess a development team capable of leveraging the technology in a unique way.\n\n\u201cJust because of the scarcity of the robots that we have, we\u2019re going to have to be selective about which partners we start working together with,\u201d Michael Perry, Boston Dynamics vice president of business development, told IEEE Spectrum, which first reported that Spot was on sale.\n\nBoston Dynamics did not immediately respond to a request for comment on how much individual robots cost to purchase.\n\nSpot uses 360-degree cameras and sensors to navigate obstacles in worksites and is capable of picking itself up if it falls. The robot moves at speeds of up to 3 miles-per-hour and can operate for up to 90 minutes per battery charge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe quadrupedal robot can also perform basic tasks, such as opening doors or grasping objects. It is built to withstand falls as well as fluctuations in external temperature.\n\nVideos of Spot\u2019s development have regularly gone viral on YouTube and other social media platforms in recent years.\n\n\u201cA nimble robot that climbs stairs and traverses rough terrain with unprecedented ease, yet is small enough to use indoors. Built to be a rugged and customizable platform, Spot autonomously accomplishes your industrial sensing and remote operation needs,\u201d the company\u2019s description of \u201cSpot\u201d says.\n\nBoston Dynamics has identified at least three potential uses for the robot. \u201cSpot\u201d can be used for mapping construction sites to create digital progress reports, facilitate remote inspections of oil and gas plants and aid public safety operations by monitoring dangerous situations without endangering humans.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS", "description": "To be considered, companies interested in purchasing \u201cSpot\u201d must explain how they would use the device to aid their business.", "authors": ["Thomas Barrabi"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Spot-2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
