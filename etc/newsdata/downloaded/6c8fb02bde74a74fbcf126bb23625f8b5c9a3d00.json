Rubin confirmed to The Verge today that he\u2019s no longer with the incubator, following a BuzzFeed report that he was \u201cquietly shown the door.\u201d\n\nBut that turn of phrase isn\u2019t quite appropriate \u2014 because Rubin\u2019s smartphone startup Essential happens to share the very same building as Playground Global in Palo Alto, California. The office has an open floor plan with few walls to speak of.\n\n\u201cYes, the Essential office is still located in the Playground space,\u201d an Essential spokesperson confirmed to The Verge.\n\nRubin tells The Verge that it was mutually decided, and Playground simply bought him out so he could \u201cfocus on the tasks at hand.\u201d Here\u2019s Rubin\u2019s statement:\n\nPlayground Global bought out my interests earlier this year when the noise around my divorce and departure from Google made it difficult to focus on the tasks at hand. Playground is still an investor in Essential and we\u2019re continuing to innovate.\n\nThe \u201cnoise\u201d Rubin is talking about here is actually reporting about his alleged sexual misconduct, including an incident where he is said to have coerced a Google employee into performing oral sex in 2013. Rubin received a $90 million golden parachute to leave Google quietly, and then Google continued to keep allegations against him and other executives quiet for years, sparking anger from employees inside the company and helping lead to the 20,000 employee-strong Google Walkout for Change.\n\nThe centerpiece of the BuzzFeed report is a claim that Rubin also walked away from Playground with a payout, this time for more than $9 million, though it\u2019s possible that\u2019s just the company returning his investment.\n\nDespite trying to focus on the tasks at hand, Rubin\u2019s noise isn\u2019t going away. After revealing a new Essential phone this week, he was immediately excoriated by the Android press; Android Police editor-in-chief David Ruddock said that he would reject access from Essential given the serious allegations against Rubin. Responding to Rubin and Ruddock at Wired, Lauren Goode asked whether we can separate troublesome creators from their products any longer.\n\nThis is all Rubin has publicly said about the allegations:\n\n1/2 The New York Times story contains numerous inaccuracies about my employment at Google and wild exaggerations about my compensation. Specifically, I never coerced a woman to have sex in a hotel room. These false allegations are part of a smear campaign \u2014 Andy Rubin (@Arubin) October 26, 2018\n\nIn 2017, Rubin took a temporary leave of absence from his smartphone startup Essential after a report at The Information revealed his 2014 departure from Google came after an \u201cinappropriate relationship with a subordinate.\u201d At that time, it wasn\u2019t clear he stood accused of sexual misconduct.\n\nDespite ending his business relationship with Playground, Rubin is still listed as a \u201cFounding Partner\u201d on Playground\u2019s people page. And he\u2019s still in the building.", "description": "Andy Rubin used to be primarily known as the \"father of Android,\" but he\u2019s also becoming known for leaving companies amid scandal \u2014 in this case Playground Global, the tech incubator he founded after leaving Google in 2014.
