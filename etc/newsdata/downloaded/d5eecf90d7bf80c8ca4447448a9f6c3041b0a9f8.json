It\u2019s not unusual to find rapid shifts in a stock\u2019s share price after earnings are reported, especially if the company says something unexpected \u2013 an earnings beat, or a revenue miss, or a revision to forward guidance will all have an impact on investors\u2019 perceptions.\n\nSo, we\u2019ve opened up TipRanks\u2019 Earnings Calendar, a nifty tool for sorting through the earnings schedule, to find three popular stocks, all with Strong Buy consensus ratings, that are reporting earnings today. We\u2019ll report on their current status; it will be up to you to watch for the earnings releases after markets close.\n\nTwilio (TWLO)\n\nUp first is Twilio, one of Silicon Valley\u2019s cloud server companies. Specifically, Twilio offers a cloud communications platform on the popular software-as-a-service model. Twilio\u2019s cloud software allows customers telecommunications access through the computer server. Customers can use Twilio to send or receive telephone calls, text messages, video, or chat, and the platform has security systems \u2013 user verification and authentication \u2013 built in.\n\nTwilio brings in upwards of $650 million in annual revenue, but like many cutting-edge tech companies it frequently operates with an earnings loss. However, in Q2, reported at the end of July, the company showed a non-GAAP earning of 3 cents per share after revenues jumped 86% year-over-year. Looking ahead to Q3, the forecast is for positive EPS of 1 cent and a 70% annual revenue gain to $287.9 million.\n\nTwilio\u2019s earnings curve has been on an upward trajectory in recent years. In the last 8 quarters, TWLO has beaten the revenue forecast every time, and the EPS forecast six times. Both earnings and revenues have been revised upwards in multiple times in the last three months.\n\nWall Street\u2019s analysts are impressed with TWLO. Writing from Piper Jaffray, Brent Bracelin, ranked number 9 overall in TipRanks\u2019 analyst database, gives the stock a solid Buy rating with a $141 price target, suggesting over 30% upside. (To watch Bracelin's track record, click here)\n\nBracelin noted, \"After declining 29% from the 52-week highs, the stock's risk/reward appears favorable for a profitable share gainer with a $1B-plus run-rate in a secularly growing category within a $66B total addressable market.\" In other words, this is a stock that is primed for explosive growth.\n\nMonness analyst Brian White highlights some different numbers in his note on Twilio. He says, \u201cWe believe Twilio will at least meet our 3Q:19 revenue estimate of $288.5 million (up 71%) and our EPS forecast of $0.02\u2026 We are projecting 3Q:19 base revenue of $278 million (up 80% YoY) and variable revenue of $10.4 million\u2026 We expect Twilio to add 7,500-8,000 customers in 3Q:19, reaching a total of well over 169,000 customer accounts (vs. 161,869 in 2Q:19).\u201d White\u2019s price target is highly bullish, at $175, indicating confidence in a 66% upside potential.\n\nWall Street\u2019s confidence backing this cloud communications app maker is strong, with TipRanks analytics showcasing TWLO as a Strong Buy. Based on 9 analysts polled in the last three months, eight are bullish on Twilio, while only one remains sidelined. The 12-month average price target stands at $149.33, marking a 40% upside from where the stock is currently trading.
