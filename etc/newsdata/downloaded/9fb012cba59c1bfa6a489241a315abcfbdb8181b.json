Tech, as the DNC Geek Squad is known inside Washington headquarters, asked each presidential campaign to report \u201cinauthentic or suspicious activity\u201d to the DNC as well as to the major social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook/Instagram, Google/Youtube).\n\nSince 1992, Democratic Party war rooms haven\u2019t changed all that much from those scenes in The War Room of James Carville and George Stephanopoulos sitting around watching the news and yelling at reporters. But today denizens of Democratic war rooms are more likely to have a computer science background than experience on a big Senate campaign, and the main battlefront after a big debate isn\u2019t Johnny Apple\u2019s front-page interpretation of the event but whether fringe disinformation penetrates the mainstream social media conversation.\n\nIn its note to campaigns, the DNC explained that as with previous debates, on Tuesday night Twitter would also have its own cyber war room set up to monitor \u201cdebate-related discourse for coordinated manipulation.\u201d Campaigns were instructed to \u201cforward any hashtags your campaign expects to use or expects to be used against you (\u2018hatetags') during the debates\u201d to the DNC for monitoring.\n\nDuring tonight\u2019s debate, the DNC will use a software tool called Trendolizer to track trending disinformation. Trendolizer \u2014 think TweetDeck but with lots of fancy graphs \u2014 scrapes data from social media and across the internet to surface hidden content that is on the cusp of going viral. Its \u201cHotness\u201d filter alerts users when something new is about to take off. If it\u2019s potentially damaging misinformation about a Democratic candidate, DNC Tech flags it for its \u201ccounter-disinformation contact\u201d on the affected campaign and recommends that they reach out to one of the third party fact-checkers that Facebook relies upon\u2014such as the AP, Poynter, or FactCheck.org .\n\nA fact-check is crucial: once it\u2019s attached to the news, Facebook will adjust its algorithm and diminish the spread of the story. (In guidance to the campaigns, the DNC is careful to note that \u201cCheckyourfact.com, which is owned in part by Tucker Carlson, is another Facebook third-party fact checker that the DNC is not in communication with.\u201d)\n\nThe DNC flag-and-respond operation is more art than science. Campaigns can ask the DNC to turn the dials up and down on Trendolizer to figure out how much a \"misinfo\" threat has to spread before they are alerted. It\u2019s up to the individual campaigns to figure out whether it\u2019s worth worrying about the fake story or crafting a response.\n\n\u201cWhen contemplating a response to disinformation narratives, campaigns should consider whether misinformation has reached a tipping point where the costs of ignoring the issue are higher than the costs of the amplification that a response might generate,\u201d the DNC privately instructed presidential campaigns on Monday.\n\nIn a previous email the party argued that a good indication of when to respond is when \u201cthe information has left closed communities,\u201d such as 4chan or a fringe blog or social media account. (The DNC views the president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., as a frequent conveyor belt for disinformation, pulling it out of closed communities and dumping it into the mainstream media, and so they watch his account carefully.)\n\n\u201cIt is up to every campaign to figure out where that inflection point is,\u201d said a senior member of the DNC Tech team. \u201cWhen and how do you push back?\u201d\n\nIn the age of political disinformation that may be the most important question facing any Democratic presidential campaign.\n\nA CNN sign hangs on the side of a buidling near an athletic field outside the Clements Recreation Center where the CNN/New York Times will host the Democratic presidential primary debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio. | John Minchillo/AP Photo\n\nIt\u2019s a cliche to say that Democrats care, above all else, about electability this year. That fuzzy concept has been defined in different ways. For some Democratic voters, the most electable candidate is the one with the best policies to contrast with Trump. For others, the concept of electability is about identity, with some voters arguing that only an old white guy can beat Trump, the candidate of white grievance, and others countering that only a woman or person of color can reassemble the diverse \u2014 and winning \u2014 Obama coalition. Sometimes electability is defined as the absence of some glaring personal or political flaw \u2014 a candidate\u2019s age, voting record, or whether he\u2019s authentic.\n\nBut what isn\u2019t talked about as much is that what might make a Democratic nominee \u201celectable\u201d in an era dominated by disinformation warfare, is whether or not the candidate has a strategy and team to combat the kind of false attacks that Trump used to nuke Hillary Clinton and is now beta-testing against Joe Biden. That capability is undoubtedly more difficult for Democratic voters to assess than a candidate's typical attributes and flaws.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s some Democrat watching the field saying, \u2018Oh I think X would be better to take on Trump because X doesn\u2019t have to worry about Y,\u2019 they are naive,\u201d said Philippe Reines, Hillary Clinton\u2019s longtime confidante who has advised several 2020 campaigns about the lessons he learned \u2014 and is psychologically scarred by \u2014 running against Trump in 2016. \u201cBecause Y is either something that marginally exists that they\u2019re going to blow up or Y is something that they\u2019re going to make up. So everyone is going to end up in the same boat. So it really comes down to who is best to handle it, not whose background is freest of vulnerabilities.\u201d\n\n'Dogpiling' and the spotlight effect\n\nCombating disinformation is a collective action problem. The DNC is modest about what their early detection system can accomplish and are quick to direct reporters to the campaigns. The campaigns often send you back to the DNC. \u201cIf you\u2019re already talking to the DNC I think that\u2019s your best bet,\u201d a spokesperson for Warren said. \u201cThey track it better than most campaigns have the capacity to at this point.\u201d\n\nWhile the campaigns and the DNC often browbeat the mainstream media into handling disinformation more responsibly, they can\u2019t do much more than that. Social media platforms, Democrats universally argue, are the most responsible for spreading disinformation \u2014 and the least responsive to correcting it. A campaign can call any editor at The New York Times. When they want to complain about a viral YouTube video accusing a top candidate of hiding a meth lab in his basement, they are instructed to send an email to an anonymous email address (civics-outreach@google.com).\n\nDespite the limitations, the DNC Tech\u2019s archive of confidential correspondence to the Democratic presidential campaigns shows the party has done quite a bit. \u201cI\u2019m not one to say the DNC is pitching a perfect game but they have been really forward thinking about misinformation,\u201d said one top adviser to a presidential candidate. \u201cIt\u2019s the only thing I\u2019ve seen that works.\u201d\n\nBy mid-September, the DNC had reported over 40 \u201cmisinformation incidents\u201d that caused over 4,000 social media accounts to be removed. They helped campaigns connect with an assigned FBI field agent and a contact at the Department of Homeland Security. The DNC regularly warns of sophisticated new phishing attacks. There was a recent attempt to compromise accounts via a fake calendar invite and a warning about the Iranian hacking group Phosphorus, which Microsoft informed the DNC was \u201cattacking accounts of journalists, politicians, and at least one presidential campaign,\u201d reportedly Trump\u2019s.\n\nAfter the September debate, DNC Tech sent out a summary of suspicious activity it spotted by monitoring Twitter. The party found that a Twitter thread by Beto O\u2019Rourke was the target of \u201cdogpiling,\u201d the technical term for when trolls coordinate on one thread to dominate the candidate\u2019s mentions. The Beto dogpile concerned a popular meme that says Beto is a furry .\n\nNot everything deserves a response. When the DNC reached out and reported the furry dogpile to Beto\u2019s campaign, the DNC staffer noted, \u201cI haven't flagged this activity to Twitter as I think the backlash to any action taken by them might be worse than the current activity.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the dogpile, the DNC reported after the September debate \u201c[a]t least three new right-wing narratives targeting candidates,\u201d and that there was a \u201cdirect threat to one candidate, which Twitter removed in the early morning following the debate.\u201d\n\nThe O\u2019Rourke campaign recently faced a false story more concerning to them than the (mostly) harmless furry meme. Last month, a story spread online that the Odessa shooter, who killed seven people, had a Beto sticker on his car. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect kind of misinfo because it seems possible,\u201d said Rob Flaherty, O\u2019Rourke\u2019s digital director. \u201cIt would undercut the whole narrative. If it were a reporter, we could just call them and they would issue a correction.\u201d\n\nAs Trendolizer showed the story spiking in fringe corners of social media, the DNC alerted the O\u2019Rourke campaign and they watched as it seemed to metastasize. Or did it?\n\nIn psychology there\u2019s something called the spotlight effect, which refers to the human tendency to believe that many others notice something about you that you notice about yourself. In reality most people probably don\u2019t notice or care about the mole on your chin that you\u2019re anxious about or that you\u2019re having a bad hair day.\n\nPresidential campaigns spend every day debating the spotlight effect. Flaherty and his team had to decide whether everyone else might be paying close attention to the same thing they were obsessively monitoring.\n\n\u201cWe had internal conversation about what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no playbook. We debated: \u2018Do you say anything to fuel it or not? Are you at a tipping point where it\u2019s worth having that conversation or do you let it die out?\u201d\n\nRichard Stengel, in his new book, Information Wars: How We Lost the Global Battle Against Disinformation and What We Can Do About It, notes that a body of research suggests that repeating a lie, even in a fact-check, just spreads it. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a fake news problem, we have a media literacy problem,\u201d he told me, citing a study about how repeating falsehoods creates what one academic calls a \u201cbelief echo.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe solution is to not state the false belief,\u201d he said. \"If you put the problem in a marketing context, you kill a brand by ignoring it. The head of McDonald\u2019s never talks about Wendy\u2019s. It varies case by case, but if I were a political strategist I would contest Trump on content reasons and policy reasons, but not attack him on his own lies.\u201d\n\nThis is an age-old debate in politics. But most campaigns and Democratic strategists are moving away from the ignore-the-brand view.\n\n\u201cFor 15 years, at least half the time I, or we, would say to Hillary, \u2018Let\u2019s not give that oxygen,\u2019\u201d said Reines. \u201cAnd it was a mistake! You can\u2019t let anything go. We will all go to our deaths never hearing Donald Trump say, \u2018I won\u2019t dignify that with an answer.\u2019\u201d\n\nInside the O\u2019Rourke campaign, his aides watched with increasing nervousness as versions of the false Odessa story gained likes and retweets. The main version of the story grew to 34,000 shares on Facebook (tipping point!). Then again it only had a suspicious 46 comments (spotlight effect!). Eventually O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign decided it should respond to the fake news in a thread by campaign manager Jen O\u2019Malley Dillon.\n\nFlaherty noted several lessons about the episode. One was to err on the side of responding rather than ignoring.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s value in being more aggressive about this stuff,\u201d he said \u201cTraditional political communications tells you that if there\u2019s something in the grocery store tabloid it\u2019s not worth talking about it because it just raises it up. The lesson for us is to be confrontational.\u201d\n\nThe second lesson is that there is a generational divide among Democratic operatives. Older comms people who come out of the grocery store tabloid era are still more likely to argue for trying to deny a story oxygen, while younger staffers, unimpressed by the spotlight effect theory and who grew up only in social media, want to respond to everything.\n\nThe final lesson Flaherty took, which is widely shared by almost everyone I talked to about combating political disinformation, is that Twitter, Facebook, and Google are the problem.\n\n\u201cThe platforms aren\u2019t up to it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy is the responsibility on me as the campaign\u2019s digital director? It\u2019s ludicrous to me that my place in the ecosystem is to flag this stuff for them rather than them coming to me and saying, \u2018Hey, you might have a problem!\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile the disinformation crisis will be among the greatest challenges for whomever the Democrats nominate, only a few campaigns have had to grapple with serious threats so far. An aide to Cory Booker \u2014 who has been vocal in defending Biden from Trump\u2019s false attack linking Biden\u2019s vice presidential diplomacy in Ukraine to his son\u2019s private sector work advising a Ukraine energy company \u2014 pointed out that disinformation has been the presidential campaign equivalent of a first world problem: only the longtime frontrunner has been seriously affected. But she, like her boss, was sympathetic to the bind that Biden is in, especially when it comes to Facebook\u2019s much-criticized decision to exempt political advertising from its fact-checking regime.\n\n\u201cSay the Trump campaign started running an ad that said Cory ran over a dog and started calling him 'Dog Killer,'\u201d she said, adding that Booker has not, in fact, ever killed a dog. \u201cIt\u2019s not true. We all know it\u2019s not true. But Facebook would promote that. Then you might be forcing groups like PETA to weigh in, because they would say, \u2018Oh this is obviously terrible even though it\u2019s untrue.\u2019 Eventually you\u2019re building it up into this whirlwind that actually shouldn\u2019t exist anyway because Facebook should do the responsible thing and not run that ad.\u201d\n\nFacebook has repeatedly responded that they won\u2019t police the speech of politicians. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe,\u201d Nick Clegg, the top communications exec at the company, said recently, \u201cthat it\u2019s an appropriate role for us to referee political debates and prevent a politician\u2019s speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny. That\u2019s why Facebook exempts politicians from our third-party fact-checking program.\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s response to Trump\u2019s false attack about Ukraine has received mixed reviews. Most senior advisers at rival campaigns did not want to criticize Biden\u2019s team either because it seemed like blaming the victim or because it\u2019s too early to know how to assess his strategy.\n\nBut several things stand out. The first is that Biden's campaign waited longer than what the most aggressive outside agitators, like Reines, insist is necessary in 2019. The increasingly popular hawkish view in Democratic circles is that if Trump attacks with a false charge, the target candidate \u2014 not his or her surrogates \u2014 needs to immediately and forcefully respond.\n\nBiden is not generally considered a candidate with strong social media skills, and his long delay in confronting Trump on the issue directly and on camera suggests that the campaign was paralyzed with the traditional debate about the dangers of repeating the lie. (Two Biden aides confirm this was the case.)\n\nThe campaign was more effective in working the refs. Biden\u2019s team sent a flurry of letters to news organizations and social media platforms. The news side of the mainstream media has overwhelmingly responded by carefully reporting that there\u2019s no evidence of Biden trying to help his son. The advertising side of networks, like MSNBC and CNN, responded by refusing to run a Trump ad that included the false allegation.\n\nBut the final lesson, not surprisingly, is that Twitter, Facebook, and Google have been unmoved by the Biden campaign\u2019s appeal to halt the spread of false information. A consensus is emerging in Democratic politics that these platforms are the greatest threat to the party\u2019s eventual nominee.\n\nSeveral advisers to presidential candidates noted that in this new front against the social media giants, it was Warren\u2019s clever effort to shame Mark Zuckerberg that stood out. The Warren campaign ran an ad on Facebook that included a false statement about the platform\u2019s founder and CEO \u2014 that he endorsed Trump for reelection \u2014 that was perhaps more effective than the Biden campaign\u2019s stern letter to the company.\n\nThere is so much anger at Facebook\u2019s role in spreading disinformation that the Booker aide said her fantasy for tonight\u2019s debate would be an even more high-profile version of Warren\u2019s ploy.\n\n\u201cWhat if every candidate on the debate stage just got up there and started spewing absolute lies about Mark Zuckerberg?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sure he wouldn\u2019t like that.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/62/ef/846b88e1441c82503f2c2a822706/191015-dnc-ap-1k.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
