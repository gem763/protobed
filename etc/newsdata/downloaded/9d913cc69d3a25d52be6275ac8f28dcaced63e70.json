While it is nice to carry a phone without a case, at $1,000+ I feel better about putting something on it to protect it from accidental drops.\n\nSamsung includes a screen protector on the Note 10 Plus so with the UAG Monarch you can now get back and side protection for the phone. It's tough to cover up the Aura Glow color, but it's worth protecting your investment.\n\nThe UAG Monarch is available for $59.95 in black and crimson colors. UAG also makes the Plasma ($39.95) and Plyo ($39.95) for the Galaxy Note 10 Plus so there is a model in a style and color to meet your needs.\n\nThe UAG Monarch series is the top end style at UAG, thanks in large part to its double military standard drop protection and integration of leather and metal hardware in the case. The side honeycomb traction grip looks great and makes it easy to hold onto your Note 10 Plus.", "description": "The Galaxy Note 10 Plus has a high level of dust and water resistance, but it has glass front and rear panels so it is susceptible to breakage. UAG's new Monarch case provides drop protection that meets the MIL-STD 810G standard.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/24/ab76419f-191c-473c-a6fc-7b1e70b21bb0/thumbnail/770x578/9501d44b9f1720e50dc6544a3cd5601c/uag-note10-plus-1.jpg"}
