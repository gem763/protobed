(Photo: Bebeto Matthews, AP)\n\nIt's getting closer.\n\nThe T-Mobile-Sprint merger cleared a major regulatory hurdle Wednesday when the Federal Communications Commission formally voted to approve the deal to combine the nation\u2019s No. 3 and No. 4 wireless carriers.\n\nFCC chairman Ajit Pai, who had announced support for the merger back in May, joined his two GOP counterparts in favor of the deal; the two Democratic commissioners voted to oppose it.\n\nThe Justice Department had given its own green light to the $26 billion deal over the summer, leading, among other concessions, for Sprint to sell its Boost Mobile prepaid carrier unit to Dish.\n\nTo placate critics, the would-be merger partners also have agreed to accelerate the deployment of 5G broadband in rural America to help close the digital divide.\n\nThe consumer impact\n\nStill, the impact on consumers remains uncertain.\n\nOpponents insist the deal will result in higher cellphone prices and a loss of as many as 30,000 jobs.\n\nT-Mobile and Sprint have long claimed otherwise and previously committed to not raise prices for three years. Sprint has also suggested in regulatory filings that, absent merger approval, its very long-term viability is in question.\n\nSpotify tips: You're probably not using Spotify right. Here's how to get the most out of your music\n\nIn voicing her opposition to the deal, Democratic Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said in a statement: \u201cWe\u2019ve all seen what happens when markets become more concentrated after a merger like this one. In the airline industry, it brought us baggage fees and smaller seats. In the pharmaceutical industry, it led to a handful of drug companies raising the prices of lifesaving medications. There\u2019s no reason to think this time will be different. Overwhelming evidence demonstrates that the T-Mobile-Sprint merger will reduce competition, raise prices, lower quality and slow innovation.\u201d\n\nHer FCC colleague Geoffrey Starks also weighed in: \"You don\u2019t need to be an expert to know that going from four wireless carriers to three will hurt competition. This merger takes a bad situation and makes it worse.\"\n\nT-Mobile and Sprint aren\u2019t out of the woods yet. Well over a dozen state attorney generals from both parties have sued to stop the merger on the grounds that it will be bad for consumers. While some have since settled, the legal proceedings are ongoing.\n\nEmail: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow @edbaig on Twitter.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/10/16/fcc-approves-t-mobile-sprint-merger-consumer-impact-remains-unclear/3999933002/", "description": "The T-Mobile-Sprint merger cleared a hurdle Wednesday when the FCC formally voted to approve the deal.
