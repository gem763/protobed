And in a perfect world, you\u2019d walk in for your first appointment and that would be it. No need to look any further.\n\nBut let\u2019s say, for example, you picked your therapist while you were in the midst of a crisis and now you feel like you\u2019re too far into your treatment to leave. Or maybe you\u2019ve gone a few times but you\u2019re not really sure that you\u2019re getting what you need from the interaction.\n\nThere are many reasons people find themselves in an established relationship with the wrong therapist or seeing someone they\u2019ve outgrown. We asked experts for red flags that indicate you need to break up with your therapist and find a new one. Here\u2019s what they had to say:\n\n1. Your therapist fell asleep on you\n\nBelieve it or not, this actually happens.\n\n\u201cI have had more people than I can count come to my office and tell me that they\u2019re coming because their previous therapist fell asleep,\u201d Chloe Carmichael, a clinical psychologist based in New York City, told The Huffington Post. \u201cAnd they\u2019ve told me that it\u2019s happened more than once.\u201d\n\nIf your therapist ever falls asleep on you in session, take that as a sign that he or she is not fit to be working with patients and you should find someone new.\n\n2. You feel like your therapist doesn\u2019t support your goals\n\nIt is important that you feel supported. Charmichael gives the example of a troubled relationship: If your therapist thinks you should break up with your partner but you are seeking help to repair the relationship, have a conversation with your therapist about this, she advises.\n\n\u201cI would encourage the person to say, \u2018I want to clarify if we should continue working together, because I want to clarify that we have the same goals. I want to stay with my boyfriend and sometimes I feel like you want me to break up with him. Is that true?\u2019\u201d Carmichael said.\n\nThis kind of conversation provides the opportunity to see if you and your therapist see eye-to-eye, learn about potential red flags he or she might be noticing and agree about the direction in which your life is going.\n\n\u201cYou do not want to be with somebody who comes across as judgmental,\u201d agreed Liana Georgoulis, a clinical psychologist and director of Coast Psychological Services in Los Angeles.\n\nOn the other hand, sometimes you won\u2019t always hear what you want to hear, Georgoulis said. The right therapist won\u2019t always agree with you. And, of course, any therapist has a responsibility to intervene if you\u2019re in an abusive or otherwise dangerous situation.\n\n3. The therapist claims he or she is an expert in every condition\n\nBeware of therapists who say they\u2019re able to help with everything or market themselves as a \u201cJack of all trades.\u201d\n\nMany therapists know which conditions they can help with, and also where they can\u2019t, Carmichael notes. A good therapist will refer you to someone else if your condition falls out of his or her scope.\n\n4. You\u2019re not sure why you are in therapy\n\nTherapy can provide tools for coping with everyday stress or a mental health condition. Make sure you are working with your therapist toward mutually agreed-upon and clearly defined goals.\n\n\u201cSometimes there might be differences in what that work is or how to get there,\u201d Georgoulis said. But ask the professional you\u2019re seeing to outline the treatment plan so you have a good sense of what it is you\u2019re doing together.\n\n5. Your therapist needs reminders\n\nYou should not feel like you need to brief your therapist on events or facts you\u2019ve already covered in previous weeks.\n\n\u201cIf that happens every session, that might be a sign that you want to get a therapist that\u2019s more organized or more attentive,\u201d Carmichael said. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to lead the therapist.\u201d\n\n6. You don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re getting anywhere\n\nLet\u2019s say you went into therapy for anxiety and you\u2019ve learned tools to help you cope better each day. So rather than talk about anxiety, you bring up other issues that you need help working out. But session after session, you just don\u2019t see any progress in these areas.\n\n\u201cSometimes you\u2019ve just gone as far up the mountain as you can with somebody, and it\u2019s justifiably time to say goodbye,\u201d Carmichael said.\n\nGeorgoulis agrees. If you\u2019ve been in therapy for a long time but the needle hasn\u2019t moved on certain issues, bring this up to your therapist. If you are still in pain, or not feeling good, it may serve you to find another person to talk to, she said.\n\n7. You know too much about your therapist\u2019s life\n\nWhen therapists tell patients information about their own lives to make a point or illustrate an idea, it\u2019s called disclosure. Researchers have been debating where the line is when it comes to this technique for ages \u2015 even Sigmund Freud grappled with it, The New York Times reported.\n\nHere\u2019s how Carmichael suggests approaching it: If the therapist is telling you things about his or her own life for an obvious reason and it feels helpful, it\u2019s probably fine. But if you can\u2019t figure out why the therapist is sharing certain stories, or if he or she is taking up your valuable therapeutic time, it could be an indicator that this therapist is not the right fit.\n\nCarmichael suggests finding a therapist who expresses him or herself quickly and distinctly during your time together. \u201cThere\u2019s not room for long winded answers,\u201d she said.\n\n8. You go to therapy just to vent\n\nA core component of good therapy is the therapist\u2019s ability to connect a patient\u2019s thoughts, find patterns and then trace it all back to concrete changes in thinking, Georgoulis said.\n\n\u201cIf a therapist is just letting you come in and \u2018vent\u2019 each week, that\u2019s not a good sign,\u201d she said. Find a therapist who does more than just make you feel better in the moment or provide advice for particular situations.\n\n9. You feel good after every session\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a misconception, I think, that people are supposed to walk away from a therapy session feeling great and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true,\u201d Georgoulis said. \u201cThe work is hard and sometimes you leave therapy sessions feeling challenged or drained. Stuff gets stirred up.\u201d\n\nIf you are always leaving therapy feeling like everything is perfect, Georgoulis urges you to ask yourself if you are truly doing the work. It could be a sign that you need a different therapist who can help you process challenging emotions. So, what should you do? Both experts say the best route to securing the right therapist from the outset is to interview several of them, be straightforward about why you need counseling and ask about specific treatment methods he or she uses.\n\nBottom line, there are many excellent reasons to go to therapy. But once you\u2019re there, consider if the therapist is really the right fit for you. If it\u2019s not the right match, do what you need to do to find the right person.", "description": "Sometimes a person just isn't the right match.", "authors": ["Lifestyle Trends Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58ee7f0e16000020006581ab.jpeg?ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2017-04-13"}
