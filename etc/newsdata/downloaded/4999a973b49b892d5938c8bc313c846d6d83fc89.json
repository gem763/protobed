I fear I\u2019m losing her | Dear Mariella", "language": "en", "text": "The dilemma My relationship with my 19-year-old daughter is at breaking point and I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to lose her. I raised her alone (her father was an alcoholic) and from day one was determined we\u2019d be close. She confides in me and I make sure I\u2019m always there for her. In February I got married. It\u2019s been an adjustment, but my husband and I are settling into life together well. He\u2019s clear it\u2019s not necessary for him to \u201cparent\u201d my daughter and we\u2019re both happy with that. She went to university last year, but became anxious and depressed, and dropped out. She never attended the counselling sessions we signed up for when she returned. She\u2019s now working in an office job which she doesn\u2019t enjoy. Her room is a mess, she doesn\u2019t do any washing and the only time she \u201ccomes to life\u201d is when she\u2019s out drinking with friends. Otherwise she sits in her darkened room watching television. I worry she\u2019s depressed. I\u2019ve told myself to be her \u201crock\u201d while she adjusts to my husband being here, but it\u2019s increasingly difficult because she\u2019s pushing me, becoming quite vile at times. We\u2019ve arranged private counselling, but it hasn\u2019t started yet. Our ability to communicate calmly has virtually gone.\n\nMariella replies I feel for you. Your daughter is clearly going through a difficult patch and that\u2019s hard to witness, let alone negotiate. It\u2019s imperative children find their own feet in the world and I\u2019m becoming increasing convinced the new world order leaves them less and less space to do so. There are financial imperatives compelling youngsters to delay fleeing their feathered nests, but we\u2019re also struggling to instil the basic skills to withstand the outside world.\n\nI grew up expecting very little of life but was determined to see what was on the menu at the earliest possibility. Doing so was no great wrench since back then parents tended, for better or worse, to be far more detached. In my case it seemed perfectly sensible to cut loose from the adults in my life: an alcoholic father who died when I was 15, a mother left coping with five children and no income to speak of, and a violent stepfather. I wonder what my mother must have felt when she watched me set off to seek my fortune in London. I had bad days and good days, abusive experiences and some great adventures, but the words simply weren\u2019t available to me to describe or diagnose depression or trauma, abuse or sexual harassment. Instead mine was the definition of a 1970s childhood \u2013 a very long leash, a few near misses and determined forward momentum.\n\nStop being her \u2018rock\u2019 and let her find her own solid ground\n\nIt\u2019s such a different landscape for children today \u2013 protected from birth, judging the world for what it can give them, blaming missteps on the adults who raised them, fearing the future and the streets. I\u2019m left feeling that the best quality we can try to instil in our kids is fearlessness. My instinct is to fear for my daughter\u2019s safety, but I can\u2019t shield her from the world and, more importantly, I\u2019ll do her a disservice by trying. I am better off pretending to be unafraid for her, encouraging her determined efforts to break away equipped with the bits of self-protective wisdom I\u2019ve managed to accrue.\n\nYour daughter clearly is in need of professional advice, but while you wait for her counselling sessions to begin you may want to take advice (see mind.org) as she\u2019s certainly got symptoms of depression. You might also want to examine your version of your relationship. It\u2019s been a pretty intimate twosome until recently. You will both have embraced particular roles that it may be hard to step away from. My guesswork is worth nothing in the face of proper professional advice, but maybe you may need to stop trying to be your daughter\u2019s \u201crock\u201d and let her find alternative solid ground. She\u2019s got a home, a mother who loves her and a job that doesn\u2019t excite her. If she continues to rely on your fluttering around her trying to smooth her path, the longer her sense of responsibility for her own fate may take to develop.\n\nAlso, move the TV out of her room, leave the mess to mushroom so she\u2019s forced into action, and stop doing her washing. She wants your attention and is going to extreme lengths to get it. Alongside the tough love, find time to hang out together, whether it\u2019s a visit to a gallery, a manicure, or whatever she might enjoy doing with just you. She has grown up with your full, unmitigated focus and it\u2019s difficult to share that spotlight. I\u2019d hazard a guess that the disruptive arrival of a third party in the shape of your husband at a hormonally vulnerable time may be a contributing factor.\n\nYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong, but if you can disengage emotionally, stop trying to solve her woes and instead just listen, you may make more progress. The greatest compliment our children can pay us is to walk into the world without a backward glance. Training them up to abandon you is heart-breaking, but the alternative is even more so. I wish you all luck.\n\nIf you have a dilemma, send a brief email to mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk.
