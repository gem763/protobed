News, Cutler elaborated on the opportunity, explaining: \u201cSize 14 is actually the average size of women in America and I do think that we need to see more of it in media and fashion because most women are that size. So, we need to be accurately represented in brands and media.\n\n\u201cFor Victoria's Secret I am so excited that they decided to put a size-14 woman like me on the wall. I feel like they are headed in the right direction and they are listening to their audience who have requested to see more women of diverse shapes and sizes.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
