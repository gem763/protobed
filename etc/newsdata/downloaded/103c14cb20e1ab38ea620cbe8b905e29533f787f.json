woman.\n\nI would try my hand at anything, from motorbiking to white-water rafting.\n\nBut cycling was my real passion.\n\nAs a member of a cycling club I went out with my husband Denis several times a week, covering at least 150 miles.\n\nIn 2009, we\u2019d been to France to cycle and watch the Tour de France, and we\u2019d had such a good time.\n\nSince I\u2019d retired from the police, we\u2019d wanted to do more cycling holidays.\n\nBut those plans changed on 28 October.\n\nMy husband and I had driven from our home in St Helens to Chester to meet up with cycling club friends.\n\nIt was a lovely dry morning and we were looking forward to a full day on the bikes.\n\nWe parked our car, checked our bikes and set off.\n\nBut we had only travelled a few yards when a seven-and-a-half ton lorry came up behind us.\n\nDenis was hit first as he was behind me.\n\nThen he hurtled into me and the lorry hit me too.\n\nMy husband was thrown onto the grass verge, suffering a broken pelvis and internal injuries.\n\nI was thrown 10 feet into the air and landed straight onto my legs.\n\nI remember landing and shouting, \u2018Help me, help me!\u2019, then nothing.\n\nI suffered a smashed pelvis, four broken vertebrae, broken ribs, a broken knee, and a large cut on the back of my head.\n\nI was rushed to the Countess Of Chester Hospital where I was losing such a massive amount of blood that Manchester Blood Unit had to be contacted to keep supplies going.\n\nMy son Philip was teaching in Liverpool when he got the call to come to the hospital urgently, and was asked, \u2018Do you want a police escort?\u2019\n\nPhilip was faced with the prospect of losing both me and his dad in one fell swoop.\n\nEarly on, he was told not to expect me to live.\n\nDuring my operation, half of the team didn\u2019t think they could do any more for me and wanted to stop.\n\nBut one surgeon, Mr Dimitri \u2013 who was not on call, but had gone in to see\n\na patient, heard a serious accident had occurred and had come to A&E to see if he could help \u2013 said he \u2018just wanted to try one more thing\u2019 to stem the blood loss.\n\nAnd that\u2019s why I\u2019m still here \u2013 it proved to be a life-saving decision.\n\nThey used something called a filter to stop the blood, and I was fitted with a metal cage screwed into my bones to help my pelvis knit back together.\n\nThen I was put on life support for two and a half weeks, and was unconscious with no brain activity.\n\nBut I\u2019m obviously built of stern stuff, and I regained consciousness.\n\nI was fitted with a back brace and neck brace, but I was devastated when I realised what I could and couldn\u2019t do.\n\nTo be honest, I\u2019m still devastated now by my limitations, because of the active life I used to lead.\n\nBut I\u2019m here.\n\nBefore I left the hospital I asked to speak to the surgeon, and he came to see me for a matter of minutes.\n\nI was very emotional meeting him, very tearful.\n\nI said, \u2018What can I say other than thank you.\u2019\n\nI mean, what do you say to someone who has literally saved your life?\n\nHe was very matter of fact and played down his part, replying simply that he was doing his job.\n\nIt was as straightforward as that, to him.\n\nBut he wasn\u2019t going to say he was the most wonderful person ever, even though he was to me.\n\nHim doing his job is very different to someone else doing theirs \u2013 he gave me the chance to do all the things I can do today.\n\nHe gave me back the chance to have a life, despite my injuries.\n\nMy injuries are still extensive.\n\nMy pelvis is twisted, and because of extensive nerve damage, my right leg feels like a heavy weight, as though I have pins and needles constantly and my foot is about to explode.\n\nAlso, because of the nerve damage I need an insole with a foot brace attached, called a \u2018toe off\u2019, which fits into my shoe under my foot and up my leg to try to prevent me from tripping over.\n\nMy hearing on the right side is affected, and I take morphine every day to relieve the pain.\n\nI wasn\u2019t expected to live, but I did.\n\nI wasn\u2019t expected to get out of the bed, but I did.\n\nI wasn\u2019t expected to walk, but I did.\n\nWell, I call it walking, although it takes a great effort to go a short distance, and I have to rely on my crutches.\n\nI remember crying a lot when I first realised how badly I\u2019d been hurt and how much my life would change.\n\nBut when I came out of hospital five months after the accident, I had a decision to make \u2013 sit in a wheelchair and watch the world go by, or go out into the world and get on with my life.\n\nIt was a miracle I still had one, so my choice was clear.\n\nI started off slowly with physiotherapy, walking with a tall frame that I clung onto, then returned to the gym, which has helped tremendously.\n\nI\u2019ve fallen several times since the accident, because my pelvis is so weak and I struggle to balance.\n\nI have to use two elbow crutches to walk.\n\nThis means that during my long recovery I\u2019ve suffered a broken wrist, a snapped tendon in my thumb, a broken knee and femur and broken ribs.\n\nBut they are obstacles and I get over them.\n\nI attended a Fall Prevention class run by the council\u2019s Healthy Living Team, and started exercising using special cycles for disabled people (see right). It\u2019s great going downhill, but not so much coming back up!\n\nI even have a new \u2018grandson\u2019 who I ride with \u2013 a 30-year-old man who is autistic and seems to have adopted me.\n\nWe have lots of fun, and I love our new relationship.\n\nI have the greatest praise for our wonderful NHS.\n\nWithout the paramedics in the first instance and then the doctors, surgeons and nurses, I would not be here today \u2013 although I\u2019m trying to keep away from their services now!\n\nAnd, because I\u2019m a Christian, I have been able to take an extremely positive approach in my disability.\n\nOf course I have my down days.\n\nDenis and I used to walk everywhere holding hands, ever since we were courting, and now we can\u2019t do that because of my crutches.\n\nThat upsets me.\n\nAnd when my granddaughter, Rebecca, first started walking I desperately wanted to play Ring O\u2019Roses with her, but couldn\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s strange how things that seem so trivial can cause so much hurt.\n\nBut I have to be positive.\n\nI might not have the retirement I\u2019d planned with Denis, but I\u2019m still here with him.\n\nAnd Rebecca is 10 years old now and my absolute sunshine.\n\nI am very fortunate I\u2019m able to watch her grow up.\n\nI get sad that I can\u2019t just go out for a long walk on a beautiful day, but I\u2019m never angry or bitter.\n\nI just try to live the best life I can.\n\nI do think about the fact I might not have been here if it wasn\u2019t for the quick thinking of one surgeon, and it\u2019s humbling.\n\nWhen I\u2019m with my family it puts everything into perspective, all that I might have missed out on, so whatever pain I\u2019m in, whatever I go through, it makes life worth living.\n\nAnd it\u2019s better than the alternative \u2013 I don\u2019t like pine!", "description": "Mary Ellison suffered awful injuries when was knocked off her bike and taken to the Countess Of Chester\u00a0 - she wasn\u2019t expected to live but then an off duty surgeon came up with an idea", "authors": ["Janet Tansley", "Image", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20706224.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Mary-Ellison-with-husband-Denised.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
