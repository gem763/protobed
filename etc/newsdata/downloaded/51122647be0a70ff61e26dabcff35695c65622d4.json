REUTERS/Christian Hartmann/File Photo\n\n\u201cAs China further opens its markets, we will make further investments in China,\u201d Xin He, SocGen\u2019s head of global markets, China, told a financial forum over the weekend.\n\nOn the sidelines of the forum, organized by the CFA Institute, He told Reuters that the bank had dropped a joint-venture plan to avoid the hassle of future stake transfers.\n\nInternational investment banks are only able to own 51% of their China operations. That requires a joint venture with local Chinese partners.\n\nChina\u2019s securities regulator unveiled a firm timetable on Friday to open up its financial industry, saying foreign ownership limits will be removed completely for the country\u2019s futures, mutual fund and securities sectors in January, April, and December next year respectively.\n\nA SocGen spokesman in Hong Kong confirmed that the bank had postponed its plans for a local securities business in China until regulators announced more details, and emphasized the bank\u2019s commitment to China.\n\nResponse to the announcement from elsewhere in the financial industry has been mixed.\n\nFidelity International, which has been considering a wholly owned mutual fund business in China, said in an email that it would apply for a license eventually.\n\nBut Michael Lu, China General Manager of Eastspring Investments, a member of Prudential Plc (UK), cautioned that full ownership doesn\u2019t guarantee success in China\u2019s highly competitive mutual fund market. Local experience, partnerships and banks\u2019 sales networks are essential, he added.\n\nPeter Alexander, Managing Director of fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors, said China\u2019s timetable for opening at least provides a enough clarity that certain companies can move forward.\n\n\u201cThe clock is now ticking and a large swath of firms will be concerned if a key competitor is among the very first in the official queue,\u201d Alexander said.", "description": "Societe Generale , France's third-biggest lender, has ditched a plan for a securities joint venture in China in favor of a wholly owned subsidiary, as Beijing said foreign ownership limits on the country's giant financial industry would be gone by the end of next year.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440590336&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D09S", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
