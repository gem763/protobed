The decision to creak open the gates is a reluctant one.\n\nIranian women allowed to watch football at stadium for first time in decades Read more\n\nAfter tickets were released on 3 October for a single, women-only block in the 78,000-seat stadium they sold out within minutes. Women photographed and tweeted pictures of their prized purchases and, as a further three blocks were made available, each was filled in turn.\n\nThe Iranian FA has restricted the number of women able to attend. Around 3,500 are expected, comprising 4.5% of the capacity. Meanwhile BBC Persian Sport has reported that although only 2,500 tickets have been bought by men, the FA will not give more seats to women clamouring to enter.\n\nAs Amnesty International said this week, the restrictions placed on women attending and lack of commitment beyond this single event illustrate that this game is being used as a \u201ccynical publicity stunt\u201d.\n\nThe death of \u201cBlue Girl\u201d Sahar Khodayari a month ago was a horrific but significant step forward in the campaign to open the stadiums of Iran to women. Until that moment, Fifa and the Iranian FA were getting away with dragging their feet, the world governing body having looked the other way for decades as its rules on discrimination and human rights were broken.\n\nYes, Fifa\u2019s president, Gianni Infantino, wrote letters to the Iranian FA, most recently in June, which the world governing body said included requests for a clear timeline and assurances that women wanting to attend the qualifiers would be able to do so and Fifa claims those letters were \u201canswered positively\u201d. But in March 2018 Infantino himself had been inside the stadium hosting the Tehran derby between Esteghlal and Persepolis while 35 women were arrested outside.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A banner displayed at Iran\u2019s game against Morocco during the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

The government and FA are so resistant to making concessions because they do not want to embolden campaigners to fight for further changes or allow them to broaden the conversation.\n\nIt is also a movement that highlights the power of football. If Fifa were to convincingly threaten sanctions and demand immediate change instead of seemingly accepting a somewhat incremental and drawn-out process riddled with excuses (women\u2019s toilets are too expensive, separate entrances have to be arranged, doing it one-off international fixture at a time, etc) then it could play a role in fundamentally altering conditions in a country known for its oppressive restrictions on women.\n\nSome will undoubtedly say we should welcome and cheerlead even the smallest steps in the right direction. But with at least 40 women having been arrested in the past two years, according to Human Rights Watch, some of whom have been prosecuted and have criminal records, and with the \u201cbearded ladies\u201d who attempted to enter in disguise still on bail awaiting charges, there should be no let-up in the pressure being applied internationally and internally.\n\nIf the Iranian government and FA are unwilling to at least drop charges against those who have fallen foul of the outdated ban that is not law but crept in as the political Islam of Ayatollah Khomeini took control of the 1979 revolution which birthed the Islamic Republic of Iran, then no goodwill should be afforded them.\n\nThe Fiver: sign up and get our daily football email.\n\nThis one-off match is not the first: some women were allowed to attend the Asian Champions League final last November with Infantino in attendance. But the progress is painstakingly slow. With zero indication that women will be allowed into domestic games any time soon and the next home international match not until 26 March 2020 there is a big gap in the calendar.\n\nThere is no reason why the doors cannot be flung open to women on Thursday. The token number being allowed through the segregated turnstiles and walkways into seating that has had high metal fencing welded around it, is just that: tokenistic.\n\nAccommodating this gesture is not enough. A complete lifting of the ban, the removal of charges against women facing prosecution and the removal of criminal records for those who have fought to be allowed to enter should be the bare minimum demands placed on the country\u2019s governing body.", "description": "Around 3,500 women will see the World Cup qualifier against Cambodia but a complete end to the ban and other important steps are needed", "authors": ["Suzanne Wrack"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7767affc2f5a4aa2f5bb02f7960b1dcb12a3f7e/0_247_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=1a6b16e20f8f59872687c4b6c8be35e6", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
