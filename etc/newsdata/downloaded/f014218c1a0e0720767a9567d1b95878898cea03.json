Earlier Trump called the protests \u201criots\u201d that were a matter for China to deal with.\n\nSunday\u2019s protest was peaceful, compared with some other rallies that have turned violent in recent weeks, with police responding at various times with water cannons, rubber bullets and tear gas. Riot police were able to hold their lines in a standoff in the Central MTR (mass transit railway) station, near Sunday\u2019s march, where several protesters were detained after a fire was started at one entrance.\n\n\u201cWith the US locked in a trade war with China at this point in time, it\u2019s a good opportunity for us to show (the United States) how the pro-China groups are also violating human rights in Hong Kong and allowing police brutality,\u201d said Cherry, 26, who works in the financial industry, as protesters marched towards the US consulate nearby.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters called on Donald Trump and Washington to \u2018liberate\u2019 Hong Kong.

Many Hong Kong residents fear Beijing is eroding that autonomy.\n\nChina denies the accusation of meddling and says Hong Kong is an internal affair. It has denounced the protests, accusing the United States and Britain of fomenting unrest, and warned of damage to the economy.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s chief executive, Carrie Lam, announced concessions this week aimed at ending the protests, including formally scrapping a hugely unpopular extradition bill, which ignited the unrest in June.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Protesters started a fire at an entrance to the mass transit railway system in the city\u2019s Central district.

Hong Kong has an independent judiciary dating back to British rule.\n\nHowever, the demonstrations have long since broadened into calls for more democracy and many protesters have responded to Lam\u2019s announcement by saying the concessions are too little, too late, and have pledged to fight on.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s protesters have scored one for democracy, but the struggle is far from over | Simon Tisdall Read more\n\nUS legislation addressing China\u2019s actions in Hong Kong will be among the top priorities pushed by Senate Democrats when Congress returns to work after a recess next week, the Democrats\u2019 Senate leader, Chuck Schumer, said on Thursday.\n\nSchumer urged Republican Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader who sets the floor agenda, to bring up a bipartisan bill that would require an annual justification of the special treatment afforded by Washington to Hong Kong, including special trade and business privileges, under the U.S. Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992.\n\nThe legislation, labelled the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, would also mandate that officials in China and Hong Kong who have undermined the city\u2019s autonomy be vulnerable to sanctions.\n\nThe US must stand with the people of Hong Kong Read more\n\nIn their petition, the protesters urged that the bill be passed in full.\n\nTrump alternates between praising the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, as a great leader and casting him as an enemy, while excoriating China for taking advantage of US businesses.\n\nBeijing announced that top officials would head to Washington in early October to hold talks aimed at ending a tit-for-tat trade war, now in its second year, which has roiled markets and hammered global growth.", "description": "Protesters petition US to \u2018resist Beijing\u2019 as demonstrations enter 14th week", "authors": ["Reuters In Hong Kong"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a49499ebe5d8adf136ed3cbb47a38c54b67b7890/0_295_6123_3674/master/6123.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8bb076987f9f9df2da887d309662d096", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
