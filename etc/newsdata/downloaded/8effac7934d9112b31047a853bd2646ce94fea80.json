(That option, unfortunately, isn\u2019t currently available with your own images.)\n\nCustomize your browser\u2019s background\n\nYou can also personalize the page that comes up every time you open a new tab in your browser:\n\nOpen a new tab in Chrome and click the \u201cCustomize\u201d button (or the pencil icon) in the browser\u2019s lower right corner.\n\nSelect \u201cChrome backgrounds\u201d to choose an image from Google\u2019s collection or \u201cUpload an image\u201d to pick an image from your own local storage, then follow the prompts to find and confirm the image you want.\n\nCustomize your browser\u2019s theme\n\nGoogle has promised that soon you\u2019ll be able to click that same \u201cCustomize\u201d button and pick a custom theme that\u2019ll change the colors of your browser\u2019s tab and toolbar area. Until then, however, if you want a theme for your browser, you\u2019ll have to download it from the Chrome Web Store.\n\nFor now:\n\nOpen the \u201cThemes\u201d section of the Chrome Web Store.\n\nFind a theme you like, click it, and then click the \u201cAdd to Chrome\u201d button.\n\nCustomize your Chromebook\u2019s shelf\n\nLast but not least, take control of the Chrome OS shelf \u2014 the dock-like row of shortcuts at the bottom of your screen. Start by selecting exactly what icons appear in that area:\n\nOpen your app drawer (by clicking the circle icon in the lower-left corner of the screen and then clicking the upward-facing arrow on the partial drawer that appears). Right-click any item in the list and select \u201cPin to shelf.\u201d\n\nIf you want to add a website, open the site, click the three-dot menu icon in Chrome\u2019s upper right corner, and then select \u201cMore tools\u201d followed by \u201cCreate shortcut.\u201d\n\nIf you want the site to open in an app-like window, without the usual browser elements on top, click the \u201cOpen as window\u201d option in the \u201cCreate shortcut?\u201d pop-up window that appears. Then click the blue \u201cCreate\u201d button.\n\nDrag and drop any of the icons in the shelf to change their position.\n\nHave you decided that you don\u2019t want the icon in your shelf after all? Right-click on the icon and select \u201cUnpin.\u201d\n\nAnd one final pair of possibilities: If you want your shelf to appear on the left or right side of your screen instead of at the bottom, right-click anywhere inside it, select \u201cShelf position,\u201d then select \u201cLeft\u201d or \u201cRight.\u201d And if you want your shelf to remain hidden by default and appear only when you mouse over it, right-click the shelf and select the \u201cAutohide shelf\u201d option.", "description": "Chrome OS isn\u2019t the most option-packed operating system around, but there are some things you can do to make your Chromebook\u2019s desktop look and work the way you want.", "authors": ["Jr Raphael", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U2yYCtrzMQtHMi2YSGZUf7AJYrI=/0x322:4500x2678/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19260532/L_Perspective_Platinum_Titan.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
