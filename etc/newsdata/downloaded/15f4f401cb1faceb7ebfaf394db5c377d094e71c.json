In the snippets, the former NBC News investigative reporter alleged that the network capitulated to a pressure campaign by Harvey Weinstein to squash Farrow\u2019s expos\u00e9 of the studio mogul\u2019s serial sexual misconduct.\n\nAdditionally, Farrow revealed, NBC executives including Oppenheim and NBC chief Andrew Lack may have had knowledge of a disturbing rape accusation against Today show anchor Matt Lauer long before he was dismissed from the network.\n\nAnd so, during a Thursday call with NBC News employees, Oppenheim faced tough questions from the network\u2019s veteran journalists, many of whom demanded further details on how network brass handled allegations against Lauer, as well as Oppenheim\u2019s relationship with disgraced movie executive Harvey Weinstein.\n\nAccording to multiple employees present on the call, staffers demanded specific answers about when management knew about the Lauer misconduct claims, and confronted Oppenheim on why NBC decided against hiring an outside investigator. One employee declared to the boss that \u201cwe deserve answers from you.\u201d\n\nOppenheim did not have answers for some of the staff\u2019s most pressing questions, sources told The Daily Beast. Most notably, he dodged employee questions about whether Lauer\u2019s accuser Brooke Nevils had informed the network that the ex-anchor had anally raped her when she initially made an internal complaint. At the time, the network claimed the accusation was simply \u201cinappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace\u201d that was \u201ca clear violation of our company\u2019s standards.\u201d\n\nOne staffer pointedly asked Oppenheim: \u201cDid she [Brooke] use the word \u2018assault\u2019 when she reported this?\u201d The network president allegedly \u201cdeflected,\u201d a source said, and did not answer the question, citing a need to protect a \u201cperson\u2019s confidentiality.\u201d The network boss additionally claimed the words \u201cwere carefully chosen to characterize it exactly the same way that her attorney was characterizing it. That confidentiality is not something that I am ever going to breach, not only for her sake. The whole point of that is so she can tell her story whenever, however she chooses to and she is doing so now, I think that is appropriate.\u201d\n\nPete Williams, NBC\u2019s justice correspondent and a highly respected figure at 30 Rock, then asked a follow-up about the \u201cconfidentiality\u201d response.\n\nOppenheim also attempted to distance himself from Weinstein. Farrow excerpts released by The Hollywood Reporter on Wednesday revealed a friendly email exchange between Oppenheim and Weinstein in the months after NBC shut down Farrow\u2019s probe of the disgraced film exec. The NBC News president assured staff that he did not have a close relationship with Weinstein, and had only met him once. As an example, Oppenheim pointed out that he gave a bottle of Grey Goose vodka gifted to him by Weinstein to his assistant, and noted that Weinstein didn\u2019t seem to know that the NBC News president doesn\u2019t drink.\n\nEmployees told The Daily Beast following the meeting that they were not satisfied with the network president\u2019s answers.\n\n\u201cIt is an absolute disgrace these two [Noah and Andy] are dirtying our doorstep,\u201d a senior staffer told The Daily Beast following the meeting. \u201cWe were lied to and are pissed.\"\n\nBut the network bosses have remained defiant in the face of increased pressure, railing against Farrow and other critics.\n\nOn Wednesday, Lack sent a defiant internal memo pushing back on many of the claims in Farrow\u2019s book. He dubbed the former NBC reporter\u2019s assertion that the network may have covered up a rape claim \u201cabsolutely false and offensive,\u201d and alleged that Farrow mischaracterized the network\u2019s handling of his Weinstein investigation.\n\n\u201cIt disappoints me to say that even with passage of time, Farrow\u2019s account has become neither more accurate, nor more respectful of the dedicated colleagues he worked with here at NBC News,\u201d Lack wrote in the memo. \u201cHe uses a variety of tactics to paint a fundamentally untrue picture.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere are the essential and indisputable facts: NBC News assigned the Harvey Weinstein story to Ronan, we completely supported it over many months with resources\u2014both financial and editorial. After seven months, without one victim or witness on the record, he simply didn\u2019t have a story that met our standard for broadcast nor that of any major news organization.\u201d", "description": "Network employees, including star reporter Pete Williams, peppered the NBC News boss with tough questions about the bombshell revelations reported by Ronan Farrow.", "authors": ["Maxwell Tani", "Lachlan Cartwright", "Media Reporter", "Senior Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2930,w_5209,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570728273/GettyImages-881754040_1_yrpndl", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
