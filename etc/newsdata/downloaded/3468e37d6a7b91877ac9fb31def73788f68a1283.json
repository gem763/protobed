Today he lives in Austria.\n\nOne of his party's top members Khaleed Dawood was among hundreds arrested this week in the wake of the weekend's protests.\n\nDuring the 2018 elections, Sisi's most serious rivals were all placed under arrest, while others like Khaled Ali were discouraged from running.\n\nFormer military chief of staff Sami Anan was detained after throwing his hat into the ring.\n\nIn the Egyptian parliament, a small bloc known as the 25-30 makes up some kind of opposition. But they wield little real clout in the 600-seat body.\n\nMuslim Brotherhood\n\nFor decades, the Muslim Brotherhood was the main opposition movement in Egypt.\n\nBut since Sisi took power, it has been banned, outlawed as a \"terrorist\" organisation and dismantled.\n\nFormer senior member and Egypt's first democratically-elected civilian president Mohamed Morsi, who was toppled by the military after mass protests, died in June during a court hearing.\n\nToday, hundreds of former Brotherhood members remain in prison, awaiting trial.\n\nOthers live in exile, often seeking refuge in countries which back their organisation such as Turkey or Qatar.\n\nBut they retain a presence on social media, as well as television channels such as Mekameleen and El Sharq, which broadcast from abroad.\n\nThe group published a statement voicing \"full support\" for the anti-Sisi protests.", "description": "Since ousting Islamist leader Mohamed Morsi in 2011, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has moved to crush opponents, whether Islamists or liberals.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9276/c61d0bd5ae154d698127f71603a2369e.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
