And her plan includes several measures to revamp policing to use less violence and stem discrimination. She also promises to strengthen public defenders and rein in prosecutorial abuses.\n\nAccording to Warren campaign press secretary Saloni Sharma, Warren's pan will \"reimagine how we talk and think about public safety in this country.\"\n\n\"It is a false choice to suggest a tradeoff between safety and mass incarceration. We should spend our budgets on community services that lift people up, not imprisonment. That's how we can de-carcerate and make our communities safer,\" Sharma said in a statement.\n\nLegislatively, Warren says she would push to repeal the 1994 crime bill, a jab at former Vice President Joe Biden, who authored it, and at progressive rival Sen. Bernie Sanders, who voted for it.\n\nWarren's plan comes just two days after Sanders', and there's a lot of overlap between the Senate colleagues.\n\nSanders and Warren both support safe injection sites. They'd both try to do away with solitary confinement, cash bail and the death penalty. There are some differences between the two, however. Sanders wants to legalize marijuana, while Warren favors decriminalizing it.\n\nSanders also first said months ago that incarcerated felons should be able to vote. Warren, however, has yet to match him there with her newest plan.", "description": "\"It's not equal justice when a kid with an ounce of pot can get thrown in jail, while a bank executive who launders money for a drug cartel can get a bonus,\" she wrote in a post on the site Medium", "authors": ["Zak Hudak"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/06/10/2955e2b6-79ff-4ef0-8c5b-81c2ab31522d/thumbnail/1200x630/9495748f9d0a1ab7b1a620a0fa0145f1/ap-19160822725553.jpg"}
