He and facts have a severe dislike for each other. He and facts don\u2019t get along. If you are not going to get along with facts and you have an administration known for lying, then everything becomes a conspiracy theory.\u201d\n\nMany Trump allies and former advisers take a more charitable approach, saying the president often sniffs out intriguing tidbits of information and then highlights them for the American public and media to explore in greater detail.\n\n\u201cI learned to quit worrying a long time ago,\u201d said Jason Miller, former chief spokesman for Trump\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cHe has a pretty uncanny nose for politics. When he has a gut feeling about something, he usually ends up being right.\u201d Miller then pointed to major news events he said Trump had predicted like Brexit, the alleged political biases of the former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe and the Hillary Clinton emails found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner just before the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he worries if one or two details are off,\u201d Miller added. \u201cThe president likes to raise the questions, knowing everyone including the media will then go chasing it.\u201d\n\nBy leaning so heavily on unsubstantiated musings, critics say the president has co-opted the Republican Party into being a fact-less operation.\n\nOne Republican close to the White House said he would far prefer the House Republicans take the lead in refuting the impeachment inquiry one allegation at a time rather than having the president do it hour-by-hour with his various theories and Tweets.\n\n\u201cIt has been disconcerting in recent years to see the party rely more and more on outlandish theories of what the \u2018deep state\u2019 is doing,\u201d said Michael Steele, the former chair of the Republican National Committee. \u201cWhere were all of these people, who suddenly seem to have existed inside the government body, when Ronald Reagan was running the government, or when Bush 41 or 43 were there? Where were all of these people?\u201d\n\nposter=\"http://v.politico.com/images/1155968404/201910/2185/1155968404_6093549104001_6093546356001-vs.jpg?pubId=1155968404\"\n\n\u201cIt is just easier to blame it on some nefarious organization and individuals rather than doing the job you are going to do. If I can blame you, why would I take responsibility?\u201d Steele added.\n\nThe White House press office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAs he hits the 1,000th day of his presidency this week, Trump has continued to move fluidly between fact and fiction. He has frequently been caught in lies \u2014 well over 12,000 since he took office, according to one count \u2014 and rarely cleans them up afterward.\n\nDuring his business career, he was often caught in lies such as saying Princess Diana had taken an apartment in Trump Tower, or he\u2019d call reporters while pretending to be a public relations spokesman named John Miller.\n\nBut back in his real estate days in New York, Trump was not much of an aficionado of conspiracy theories, said Barbara Res, a former top executive for the Trump Organization.\n\nIt\u2019s true that he never took responsibility for anything negative that happened to him or his business and viewed mishaps as a personal attack, Res said, \u201cbut as far as promoting real conspiracy theories, no.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis ideas are more advanced and evolved now, but he has got new problems. The conspiracy theories he is spouting are an answer to that,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump went deep into conspiracy land in 2011 when he latched onto the discredited notion that President Barack Obama was born in Kenya. The state of Hawaii released Obama\u2019s original long-form birth certificate in 2011 to prove he was, in fact, born in the U.S.\n\nYet the \u201cbirther\u201d theory still served as a core part of Trump\u2019s political ascent, even as evidence proved it false and Trump weighed running for president.\n\nObama poked fun at Trump for fomenting the birther movement during the glitzy 2011 White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner as Trump sat stone-faced in the audience.\n\n\u201cNo one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than The Donald,\u201d Obama told the crowd of thousands of journalists, politicians and celebrities. \u201cAnd that\u2019s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter \u2014 like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?\u201d\n\nAs president, Trump has promoted conspiracy theories since his inauguration centered on the idea of the deep state, the Clinton emails or the alleged wiretapping of his New York City campaign quarters by Obama\u2019s federal government. He\u2019s also promoted the idea Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election to help the Democrats: a charge Trump\u2019s former top homeland security adviser recently publicly debunked, citing no evidence for the allegation.\n\nFormer administration officials say it\u2019s now futile to try to talk Trump out of these theories \u2014 with logic, data, common sense or even government intelligence \u2014 once he latches onto an idea.\n\nCertain White House aides such as senior adviser Stephen Miller, or China trade hawk Peter Navarro often help to fuel Trump\u2019s conspiracy-laden mind \u2014 especially with the idea that China is trying to steal all U.S. jobs, or every China exchange student is a spy. The latter is a mantra Miller often has discussed with the president, according to two former officials.\n\nEscaping the Mueller investigation relatively unscathed only emboldened President Donald Trump and his personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, said one close White House adviser. | Carolyn Kaster, File/AP Photo\n\nEscaping the Mueller investigation relatively unscathed only emboldened Trump and Giuliani, said one close White House adviser.\n\nJust a day after Mueller testified about his findings to Congress, Trump made the July 25 call to the Ukrainian president and asked him to investigate Hunter Biden ahead of the 2020 campaign. This phone call and resulting whistleblower complaint now form the basis of the Democrats\u2019 impeachment inquiry, with Democrats saying it was encouraging a foreign government to meddle in a U.S. election.\n\nTrump\u2019s not the first president to feel like he is under attack from foreign adversaries, or the media, or the intelligence community. President John F. Kennedy, for instance, often worried about officials leaking information, whereas President Richard Nixon was privately convinced the Johnson administration had bugged his airplane during the 1968 campaign.\n\nThe differences between Trump and other presidents is that he shares his conspiratorially minded, us-versus-them worldview far more publicly and prolifically, said Timothy Naftali, the founding director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum.\n\nAmericans did not know Nixon\u2019s worldview until tapes of his Oval Office conversations surfaced.\n\n\u201cTrump and Nixon share this belief that the structure of government is working against them,\u201d Naftali said. \u201cNixon\u2019s conspiracy theories sent him down a rabbit hole that destroyed his presidency. We\u2019ll see what happens to President Trump.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Michael Steele", "Former Rnc Chair"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/b5/56/0fa2de1d4686acc31126a88461f8/20191013-trump-wave-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
