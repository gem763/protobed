Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) of treason, a federal crime that carries a potential death sentence.\n\nNow, he\u2019s claiming the speaker is \u201cevery bit as guilty,\u201d accusing her of \u201chigh crimes\u201d and \u201ctreason.\u201d He also called her \u201cnervous Nancy,\u201d a nickname he attempted briefly in June but quickly abandoned.\n\nHe tweeted:\n\nNancy Pelosi knew of all of the many Shifty Adam Schiff lies and massive frauds perpetrated upon Congress and the American people, in the form of a fraudulent speech knowingly delivered as a ruthless con, and the illegal meetings with a highly partisan \u201cWhistleblower\u201d & lawyer... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\n....This makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle\u2019 Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors, and even Treason. I guess that means that they, along with all of those that evilly \u201cColluded\u201d with them, must all be immediately Impeached! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\nTrump was slammed over the baseless accusations, with critics accusing him of trying to distract from the ongoing impeachment investigation.\n\nAnd many pointed out that someone appears to be getting nervous ... but it\u2019s not Pelosi:\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m just laughing at the pathetic \u201cNervous Nancy\u201d. Nancy Pelosi has nerves of steel.

This has been CONFIRMED by Trump himself who released the transcript. \u2014 Tom Coates (@tomcoates) October 7, 2019\n\nWhen you find out about the fraudulent speeches you\u2019ve made, you\u2019re going to be really mad at you \u2014 Devin Nunes\u2019 cow \ud83d\udc2e (@DevinCow) October 7, 2019\n\nYou got the double dip going on Schiff in these tweets, but just \"Nervous Nancy\" for Pelosi?\n\n\n\npffft.
