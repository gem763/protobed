The standard versions of the Pixel 4, which will be announced at an event next Tuesday, will only support LTE. But Nikkei says that Google has begun \u201ctest production\u201d on a model of the phone that includes 5G, too.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear when the 5G model will be previewed or released, though. Nikkei says it could be shown next week, but its sources said the announcement could also be held until spring to appear alongside a new budget phone, a successor to the Pixel 3A.\n\nIt could also be announced months from now\n\nIf the phone is revealed on Tuesday, it\u2019s likely that it would just be a teaser for a launch later on. It sounds as though development isn\u2019t finished, and devices aren\u2019t ready to go into production yet. Such an early tease seems somewhat unlikely: Pixel 3 sales were slow at launch last year, and Google would risk slowing sales of this year\u2019s model by previewing a higher-end version that no one can buy yet.\n\nEither way, the goal seems to be getting a 5G phone on the market within the next year, ahead of a 5G iPhone that\u2019s expected next September. 5G networks are still in their infancy, and for consumers, there\u2019s still not a lot of reason to get one of these phones. But being early to 5G could still help Google get some attention for its phone line.\n\nNikkei reports that Google might also unveil a new smartwatch and a laptop at Tuesday\u2019s event. A new version of the Pixelbook has already been rumored, but a smartwatch isn\u2019t something we\u2019ve heard about. Google hasn\u2019t had much luck with smartwatches in the past (and Android smartwatches aren\u2019t in a particularly great place right now), but given how many are on the market, it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019d be all that hard for Google to put one together if it really wanted to.", "description": "Google has begun \"test production\" on a model of the Pixel 4 that includes 5G, according to Nikkei.
