Dozier, Detroit Free Press)\n\nThe Wolverines pressured quarterback Nate Stanley all game long, finishing with eight sacks and six hurries. Defensive end Kwity Paye led the pass rush with 2.5 sacks and two hurries before leaving in the third quarter with an injury. Others, like linebackers Jordan Glasgow and Cam McGrone, created pressure off blitzes and kept Stanley uncomfortable all game long.\n\nThe Wolverines gave up a few big plays, including a 34-yard pass on third-and-22 and a 22-yard screen pass on third-and-15. But Michigan still was able to force Iowa off the field on each of those drives.\n\nThe defense won the turnover battle. Iowa entered the game with one giveaway on the season, tied for fewest in the nation. Michigan flipped the script. The defense forced four turnovers, recovering a fumble on Iowa's first play of the game that led to a field goal. And the secondary picked off Stanley three times after he had thrown zero interceptions through his first four games.\n\nIt was a masterpiece from the defense and coordinator Don Brown, who dialed up plenty of blitzes and used some zone coverages to stop Iowa's pass game.\n\nIowa's final drive started at its own 43. It proved to be the defense's curtain call. On fourth-and-10 at Michigan's 44, Khaleke Hudson chased Stanley into his own end of the field. He somehow flipped the ball to running back Tyler Goodson \u2014 who was tackled well short of a first down.\n\nMichigan kneeled to emerge with the victory.\n\nAs well as the defense played, the offense had major problems.\n\nAfter hitting a big 51-yard pass to receiver Nico Collins in the first quarter, the Wolverines struggled to gain any sort of yardage. Michigan tallied just 271 total yards, notably struggling through the air. Quarterback Shea Patterson completed just 14-of-26 passes for 147 yards and an interception. Aside from the big play to Collins, who simply beat a defensive back on a jump ball, the Wolverines couldn't connect with their receivers downfield. The run game, meanwhile, averaged just 3.9 yards per carry.\n\nMichigan emerged with a hard-fought win, with Big Ten title hopes still intact. The Wolverines found a way to beat a top-15 opponent, which should count for something.\n\nStill, it was hardly a convincing victory. And the offensive struggles certainly don't portend good things when Michigan has to play Penn State, Notre Dame, Michigan State and Ohio State later this year.\n\nThe Wolverines did just enough to beat Iowa. But they'll need more from the offense going forward.", "description": "Michigan emerged with a hard-fought 10-3 win over Iowa in a game the Wolverines had to win to keep their Big Ten title hopes alive.", "authors": ["Orion Sang", "Published P.M.
