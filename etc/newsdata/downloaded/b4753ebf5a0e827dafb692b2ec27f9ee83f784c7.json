In a situation like this, I don\u2019t want people to feel comfortable.\u201d\n\nBachman, along with fellow comedian Amber Rollo and actor Zoe Stuckless, confronted the disgraced producer, who has been accused by more than 80 women of rape, sexual assault and harassment, at an event called Actors Hour on Wednesday night.\n\n#MeToo two years on: Weinstein allegations 'tip of iceberg', say accusers Read more\n\nWeinstein was in attendance, sitting at a table along with several young women and two body guards.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a comic, and it\u2019s our job to name the elephant in the room,\u201d she said, in a video posted on her social media accounts. \u201cIt\u2019s a Freddy Krueger in the room, if you will. I didn\u2019t realize I needed to bring my own mace and rape whistle to Actors Hour.\u201d\n\nMembers of the audience booed her, and shouted \u201cshut up\u201d, to which Bachman responded, \u201cSorry, that killed at group therapy for rape survivors\u201d.\n\nAt intermission, Struckless and Rollo approached Weinstein at his table. \u201cNobody\u2019s going to say anything? Nobody\u2019s really going to say anything?\u201d Struckless screamed, in a video posted on their Facebook page.\n\n\u201cHis bodyguards herded me out,\u201d Struckless said in a post. \u201cWhen I left the building, crying out of fury and frustration I was quickly surrounded by a group of mostly women who expressed the same fear to raise their voice that I had. They thanked me for speaking up.\u201d\n\nPlay Video 0:27 Harvey Weinstein confronted by actor at New York event \u2013 video\n\nRollo tweeted that afterward, she \u201cwent in and called [Weinstein] a fucking monster and told him he should disappear.\u201d\n\nWeinstein, who posted $1m bail after being arrested on rape charges, has appeared in public only a few times in recent months.\n\nIn a statement to Business Insider, the producer\u2019s publicist Juda Engelmayer said: \u201cHarvey Weinstein was out with friends enjoying the music and trying to find some solace in his life that has been turned upside down. This scene was uncalled for, downright rude and an example of how due process today is being squashed by the public, trying to take it away in the courtroom too.\u201d\n\nWeinstein has denied all accusations of non-consensual sex.\n\nEngelmayer did not immediately respond to The Guardian\u2019s request for comment.\n\nBachman said she had been overwhelmed by support from strangers online and fellow comedians since she confronted Weinstein, though things had \u201cbeen a little crazy\u201d. A rape survivor herself, Bachman recently produced a show called \u2018Rape Jokes: By Survivors\u2019.\n\n\u201cI was really feeling triggered and in a state of flight or fight,\u201d she said of her experience at Actors Hour. \u201cBut I felt like I had to say something.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be accepting that this monster can just come attend an industry showcase,\u201d she said. \u201cI wanted to make people feel uncomfortable about it. And I just hope people stay uncomfortable.\u201d", "description": "Several women heckled after raising questions about producer\u2019s attendance at talent show", "authors": ["Maanvi Singh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08ebb9e300e2ab3b2e90762be4be6cf1c83d0d9a/0_199_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5f399fe7aade794a74a5db84841cf4d8", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
