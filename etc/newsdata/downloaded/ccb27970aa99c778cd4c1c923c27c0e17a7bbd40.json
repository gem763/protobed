Farah left the Oregon Project in 2017.\n\nThe project currently includes Sifan Hassan of the Netherlands, who won the women's 1 500m and 10 000m titles at the IAAF World Championships in Doha last week, and Donavan Brazier, who took the men's 800m gold.\n\nThere is no suggestion that any of these athletes have been involved in wrongdoing, but since Salazar's ban, Farah is facing new questions about why he continued working with the coach even when he knew he was under investigation.\n\nFarah won the Oregon Project's first Olympic gold in 2012 in London in the 10 000m. Galen Rupp, a long-time Salazar protege, took the silver medal behind him, and Farah also claimed the 5 000m gold.\n\nBut behind the scenes, Salazar's colleagues were concerned. Steve Magness, who spent 18 months as Salazar's assistant but quit before the London Olympics, spoke out as a whistleblower when the BBC's investigative show Panorama and ProPublica investigated doping allegations in 2015.\n\nTestimony from various figures alleged microdosing of testosterone, among other suspicious actions.\n\nThe USADA report into Salazar's activities revealed that Salazar kept Nike CEO Parker informed of his experiments with injecting a mixture of amino acid and dextrose at doses clearly above what would be allowed under World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) regulations.\n\nIn another email to Parker, Jeffrey Brown, a doctor who worked with the NOP and has also now been banned, described experiments with testosterone gel.\n\nParker responded to Brown, \"It will be interesting to determine the minimal amount of topical male hormone required to create a positive test.\"\n\nA Nike spokesperson said Parker \"had no reason to believe that the test was outside any rules as a medical doctor was involved\" and that he believed Salazar \"was attempting to prevent doping of his athletes\".\n\nUnder Salazar's guidance, Farah won another golden double at the Rio Olympics in 2016 where Rupp took marathon bronze and another Oregon Project athlete, Matt Centrowitz, won the 1 500m.\n\nBy the time Farah left the group in October 2017, USADA was investigating Salazar and Brown.\n\nThe case against the two went to the American Arbitration Association, with hearings conducted in May and June 2018 setting the stage for the rulings handed down last week.\n\nUSADA chief executive Travis Tygart said Salazar and Brown had \"demonstrated that winning was more important than the health and wellbeing of the athletes they were sworn to protect\".\n\nSalazar has strongly denied any wrongdoing and said he and his athletes \"have endured unjust, unethical and highly damaging treatment from USADA\".\n\n\"The Oregon Project has never and will never permit doping,\" he said.", "description": "The Nike Oregon Project was set up to end the distance-running dominance of the east Africans but has become a huge headache for the US sportswear giant.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9307/9c516ab55e004e388743ea1a927542b0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
