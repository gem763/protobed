That compares with an average of $2.10 in 2018 and a five-year (2014-2018) average of $2.80.\n\nPrices in the Permian have dropped this year because there was not enough pipeline capacity to transport record and growing amounts of gas being produced in the basin. That gas is associated with the region's oil output.\n\nGas production in the Permian is expected to rise to a record 14.9 bcfd in September 2019, up more than 20% from the same month last year, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projections.\n\nCrude oil takeaway capacity in the Permian expanded in early 2019, but Gulf Coast Express is the first significant gas pipe to enter service this year.\n\nWith no new gas pipes, drillers in the Permian flared record amounts of gas during the first quarter of 2019 as their oil production rose to all-time highs, according to data from Rystad Energy.\n\nAfter Gulf Coast Express enters service, several other gas pipes are expected to be built, which could further reduce Henry Hub's premium over Waha.\n\nThose pipes include Kinder Morgan's 2.1-bcfd Permian Highway in 2020 and MPLX LP's 2.0-bcfd Whistler in 2021.\n\n(Reporting by Scott DiSavino Editing by Marguerita Choy)", "description": "Spot natural gas prices at the Waha hub in the Permian basin in West Texas rose to their highest since March as Kinder Morgan Inc's new Gulf Coast Express pipeline prepares to enter service over the next month.
