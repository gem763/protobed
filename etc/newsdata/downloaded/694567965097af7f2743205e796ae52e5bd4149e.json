It was the worst night of my life. I will never forget waiting for hours with my daughter to be rescued.\n\n\"I was one of the lucky ones and I will always remember that, I made it out. Many did not. \"\n\nNatasha has spoken out after firefighters were criticised in the Grenfell disaster inquiry's report, which has accused the government of \"evading scrutiny\".\n\nThe first part of the inquiry report into the June 2017 blaze, which killed 72 people, has been leaked. It focuses on the events of the night.\n\nIn it, inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick criticised London Fire Brigade\u2019s \u201cstay put\u201d policy, and said lives could have been saved if people had been evacuated earlier.\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nResidents were told to remain in their flats for nearly two hours after the fire, which began in a fridge-freezer, broke out.\n\nSir Martin praised firefighters\u2019 bravery, and said the \u201cprincipal\u201d reason the blaze spread so quickly was because the block\u2019s flammable cladding \u201cacted as a source of fuel\u201d.\n\nBut he said many \u201cinstitutional\u201d failures meant the brigade\u2019s preparation for such an incident was \u201cgravely inadequate\u201d.\n\nAnd he censured LFB commissioner Dany Cotton\u2019s \u201cremarkable insensitivity\u201d in saying she would not have changed anything about the night\u2019s response.\n\nThe report also found mistakes made in responding to the Lakanal House high-rise fire, in Camberwell, South London, in 2009, which killed six, \u201cwere repeated\u201d.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nNatasha's main hope is that the mistake that led to the loss of so many lives are never repeated.\n\nShe said: \"This report is for everyone who lost their lives and their families. We must learn what went wrong.\n\n\"We must expose the truth and make sure this never happens again. So many false things have been written about Grenfell. I hope this report will be the start of setting the record straight.\"\n\nThe mum has never blamed her neighbour, in whose flat the fire broke out.\n\nShe said: \"Firstly, this report totally exonerates our neighbour on the 16th floor.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"The fridge started the fire. Our neighbour did everything he could to raise the alarm and protect his neighbours.\"\n\nNatasha also wants to next part of the inquiry to focus on the building itself.\n\nShe said: \"The next phase of the inquiry must put an end to the buck passing and fearlessly go after the people at these organisations who bear responsibility.\n\n\"The report does not blame junior firefighters for the fire as some people are claiming.\n\n\"My family was saved by firefighters that came up to the 11th floor. I owe them my life.\n\n\"The report focuses on the institutional and leadership failings at the top of the fire brigade.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"Many lives were lost, and families deserve for the findings Sir Martin Moore Bick gives to be taken seriously and not dismissed as unfair. His points are fair.\n\n\"He details that the leaders failed to learn lessons from a previous fire at Lakanal House.\n\n\"The leaders should have trained for evacuation and fire safety inspections at the tower should have been done properly.\"\n\nBut Natasha's greatest fear is that the tragedy will happen again if lessons aren't learned.\n\nShe said: \"Tonight, hundreds of people are still going to bed in buildings with dangerous combustible materials on them.\n\n\"The report shows that a simple kitchen fire was all it took for this dangerous materials to catch fire and cause the devastation a Grenfell.\n\n\"We are terrified that this could happen again. The Government should have already got the cladding down and it is inexcusable that that is not the case.\n\n\" The Government need to see this as a national emergency and act now. This is a strong report. It is a fair report. And now change must come.\"", "description": "Natasha Elcock was one of the families who made it out of the tower block thanks to her quick-thinking actions and the firefighters who rescued her and her family", "authors": ["Jane Lavender", "Matthew Young", "Image", "Pa", "Adam Sorenson", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article16496244.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Tower-block-fire-in-London.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
