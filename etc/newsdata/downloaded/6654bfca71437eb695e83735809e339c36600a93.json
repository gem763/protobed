They don puff-sleeved ivory white dresses which perfectly hug their petite frames as they step forward in the Victory Museum in Moscow, today\n\nA girl twirls in a violet satin dress while clutching her partner's shoulder and sharing a smirk during the historic event which pays tribute to the lavish dances of the Tsarist Russia in the Debutante-style event. Others spin holding material in a sublime and synchronised dance routine\n\nYoung Cadet girls cut an elegant figure and poise perfectly as their dance partner's hold out their hand and let them gracefully lean into the Tsarist-style dance. Meanwhile others from the group watch on and line the museum walls in their tuille dresses\n\nA pair of young boys have a breather from the dancing and share a joke with two girls, pictured wearing pretty flowers in their hair and a dusty-pink ballgown, during the annual event\n\nThe group wait patiently for their turn to dance in the event which attracts youth from all over Russia and gives them the opportunity to meet and talk with war veterans and heroes of the Soviet Union. They appear sleek in pastel-coloured dresses which appear similar to the Romanov family's Empress dresses in Russia\n\nBut behind the scenes, the Cadet Ball can be mayhem with teachers calling out orders and frantically trying to get their hair braided in time (pictured). Cadets as young as eight can be recruited but appear older in their flamboyant outfits\n\nBreathtaking: A young girl stands perfectly poised in a Renaissance style dress embroided with miniature purple flowers, and confidently steps out for her performance\n\nPatriotic pride underlies the ball and young girls use sheets of material as props for their elegant dance. The museum was transformed into masterful synchronised dance from Russia's brightest young people, in Moscow today\n\nBustling! Girls step out in ballerina-style shoes and white ballrooms which pay homage to a bygone era while clasping their partner's hand in long gloves. It appears perfectly orchestrated as others follow a routine next to the spectacle of white", "description": "The Victory Museum in Moscow took a step back in time as cadets stepped out in their finery for the annual Kremlin Cadet Ball in Moscow, today.
