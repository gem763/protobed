To the south, the Dead Sea \u2013 the lowest place on the surface of the Earth \u2013 shimmers under an oppressive summer haze. Just a few miles north, the Palestinian city of Jericho bakes in the sun.\n\nIf Benjamin Netanyahu is to be believed, this land \u2013 biblical, strategic, mythical \u2013 will soon be stripped of its status as part of Palestine. It will be declared by unilateral decree as Israel, as much as Tel Aviv or the Red Sea city of Eilat.\n\n\u201cI think Israel will do the impossible,\u201d said Hussein Atiayat, a 65-year-old Palestinian whose family have lived in the valley for generations. \u201cThe whole world is supporting him. So what can the Palestinians do?\u201d he added. \u201cWe are already destroyed: financially, spiritually, socially.\u201d\n\nThe Israeli leader announced his plan in his signature dramatic fashion on Tuesday evening, standing in front of a map of the occupied West Bank and promising to extend Israeli sovereignty over large swathes of it.\n\nNetanyahu is battling for his political survival before next Tuesday\u2019s election, and the announcement was brushed off by some as a campaign stunt. But for Palestinians in the Jordan valley who have lived through half a century of military rule, his words are not to be taken lightly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a simple person, but my vision of what might happen is that we will be locked in our town,\u201d said Atiayat. \u201cLife will be miserable.\u201d\n\nArab leaders denounce Netanyahu\u2019s plan to annex Palestinian territories Read more\n\nIf carried out, Netanyahu will have smashed one of the biggest taboos of the already moribund peace process. Since Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 six-day war, it has kept hold of the land under the appearance of a temporary occupation.\n\nThat occupation would be turned into a delayed military conquest, a scenario that would kill off notions that Palestinians may be able to build a state alongside Israel, rather than live under some form of its rule indefinitely while unable to vote.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had this kind of opportunity since the six-day war, and may not have it again for another 50 years,\u201d Netanyahu said.\n\nAs well as roughly 65,000 Palestinians, the valley is home to about 11,000 settlers whose leaders immediately applauded the prime minister\u2019s speech, calling it \u201ca historic event\u201d and \u201cunprecedented news for the state of Israel\u201d.\n\nThe groundwork has already been set since Donald Trump came to power. The US president recognised Jerusalem, part of which Palestinians claim, as Israel\u2019s capital. And earlier this year, he also recognised Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, a plateau Israeli forces captured from Syria in the same 1967 conflict.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s new plan would slice off the eastern side of the West Bank, leaving the rest encircled by Israeli territory. Coupled with a previous vow he made to annex all settlements, it would also trap Palestinians in disjointed city enclaves.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hussein Atiayat: \u2018I think Israel will do the impossible.\u2019\n\nAtiayat lives in the small town of Auja, just a few miles north of Jericho. Like many Palestinians, he is a refugee, displaced from his ancestral village decades ago by Israeli troops. Now he is deputy mayor of the local municipality and sits at his desk, a photo of the late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat behind him.\n\nUnder Netanyahu\u2019s suggestion, Auja and Jericho will not be brought into Israel but squeezed into a cutoff area, save for three roads to connect it to other Palestinian towns. Including them would have meant recognising tens of thousands of Palestinians as Israel citizens \u2013 something that horrifies many rightwingers who fear it would threaten the country\u2019s Jewish majority.\n\nWhy Netanyahu\u2019s election threats could become reality this time Read more\n\n\u201cIt would be better for us to live in one state. Everyone would get the same rights,\u201d Atiayat said. But Netanyahu made clear that not \u201ca single Palestinian\u201d will be granted citizenship.\n\nSome Palestinians already say they live under a quasi-annexation. Many foreign tourists on bus trips to the Dead Sea will drive right through the Palestinian territories without realising they have left the country.\n\nRoad signs often display Hebrew and frequently ignore Palestinian communities, pointing out Israeli settlements instead, while many petrol stations and shops are Israeli-run. Border crossings with Jordan are controlled by Israel, which has built military bases and even national parks in the valley.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ibrahim Qtishat fears his farmland could suddenly become part of another country.\n\nFor years, Palestinian farmland has been confiscated and handed to settlers, while water is diverted from Palestinian villages and people are regularly blocked from moving around.\n\nIbrahim Qtishat, an agricultural engineer, has lived in Jericho for two decades. Last year, he rented a large farm outside Auja to plant dates. Now his land could suddenly become another country.\n\n\u201cMost of the people in this area are farmers,\u201d he said. \u201cMost will lose their jobs.\u201d\n\nDespite claims of electioneering, the Israeli prime minister\u2019s plan is clear to Qtishat. \u201cNetanyahu doesn\u2019t want to see any Palestinians. If he doesn\u2019t allow people to cultivate, they will leave.\u201d", "description": "Jordan Valley residents fear Netanyahu pledge could kill off notion of a future state of Palestine", "authors": ["Oliver Holmes", "Peter Beaumont"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f03a17ac3c692d58e1dcf5d1c53c635f8d15177/0_166_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1d6b33a773d9501edf799c40fd0bcb40", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
