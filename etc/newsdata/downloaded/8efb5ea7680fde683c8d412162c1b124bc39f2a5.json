Demonstrators had gathered to decry a host of problems that plague the daily life of many Iraqis, among them corruption, a lack of services and unemployment.\n\nIn Baghdad, the capital, police fired tear gas and, later, live ammunition on about a thousand protesters who had marched into a central square, their numbers swelling hour by hour amid a heavy police presence. The tear gas started when the crowd moved on toward the heavily fortified Green Zone. Next came live ammunition, and a frantic dash to carry bleeding protesters away to safety.\n\nIn a statement, the country\u2019s Interior Ministry said that it \u201cregretted\u201d the day\u2019s violence, and blamed \u201ca group of rioters\u201d for inciting it.\n\nIraq\u2019s Health Ministry said that one person had died and 286 were wounded nationwide, among them 40 members of the security forces, with protests also taking place in the cities of Nasiriyah, Diwaniyah and Basra.\n\nAlthough Iraq is experiencing a period of relative stability since the Islamic State\u2019s formal defeat here in 2017, protesters said they saw few improvements in the governance that still shapes their everyday lives.\n\nTransparency International has ranked the country\u2019s institutions as the 12th most-corrupt in the world. Last month, the country\u2019s health minister attempted to resign for a second time, citing widespread mismanagement and \u201cblackmail.\u201d Abdul Mahdi rejected that move, and infighting has left other government positions vacant, taking months to fill.\n\nMany of the protesters in Baghdad held photographs of one of the country\u2019s most famous war heroes, Lt. Gen. Abdulwahab al-Saadi, a former head of Iraq\u2019s counterterrorism force who led the fight to defeat the Islamic State.\n\nSaadi\u2019s removal from his post last week followed weeks of speculation that militia groups loyal to neighboring Iran had pushed for his departure. \u201cYou are the one who liberated Mosul,\u201d the crowds chanted, in reference to the punishing battle to free one of Iraq\u2019s largest cities from the militants.\n\nAs regional tensions simmer, Iraq\u2019s government has found itself stuck between rivals Iran and the United States. Their proxy battles have played out on Iraqi soil before. Fears are now growing that that might happen again.\n\nLoveluck reported from London.\n\nRead more\n\nHundreds of Islamic State militants are slipping back into Iraq. Their fight isn\u2019t over.\n\nDozens of Shiite pilgrims killed in Iraq stampede\n\nAs tensions boil in the Persian Gulf, Iraq seeks to rein in Iran-aligned militias\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "The protests were the largest to date against Prime Minister\u00a0Adel Abdul Mahdi\u2019s fragile year-old government.", "authors": ["Mustafa Salim", "Louisa Loveluck", "Reporter In The Washington Post'S Beirut Bureau", "Focusing On Syria.", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/GhuZqkkje2rGsjIHmsyip5N_VTk=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B7G5MWXERMI6TIZRFXYS2VVIBM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
