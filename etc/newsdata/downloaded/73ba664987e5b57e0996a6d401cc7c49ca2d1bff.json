However, a new opportunity to learn coupled with an increased salary can also cause excitement.\n\nThe new opportunity could also raise interest amongst your co-workers but you need to be on your guard to avoid causing unwanted animosity. Consider not bragging about the new position for 2 main reasons: You don\u2019t want to demotivate your colleagues about their current workspace and you might sound like you are criticising your current employer.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE: Stylish women in science \u2013 these are our favourite looks\n\nAccording to Data Scientist at Glassdoor, Morgan Smart and Chief Economist, Dr. Andrew Chamberlain in their study titled Why Do Workers Quit, The Factors that Predict, Employee Turnover, employees quit their jobs for these 3 reasons:\n\n1 - Most employees leave their company when changing jobs.\n\nEmployees are about three times more likely to leave for a new employer than to stay and move into a new role at their existing company.\n\n2 - When workers change jobs, they usually get a pay raise.\n\nEmployees leave their jobs to get a higher pay instead of making internal moves where they can get a promotion and a higher pay over some time.\n\nREAD MORE: Here's how to avoid ten mistakes that hiring managers notice during interviews so you can land your dream job\n\n3 - When workers leave employers, it\u2019s usually for a better company culture.\n\n\n\nRegardless of whether employees received raises or not, on average workers trade up to companies with better workplace culture for their new roles.\n\nSo far we know that the employer, salary and organisational culture influence the decision to resign, but once you have realised you are unhappy at your current job, what are the mistakes we make?\n\nGiselle Rentsch, a recruitment expert at HR Company Solutions lists the following mistakes to avoid when you resign:\n\n1 \u2013 Being indecisive\n\n\n\nWhen you resign your mind should be made up and it should be because you are ready for that next step in your life. If you choose to use a resignation as a scare tactic there a chance that it might back fire on you.\n\n2 \u2013 Telling your co-workers first\n\nAvoid telling your co-workers about your upcoming resignation first, instead, tell your manager first as it allows them the opportunity to decide how to tell the rest of your colleagues as well as what will be done regarding the handover.\n\nREAD MORE: These are the 5 mistakes HR will immediately overlook your job application for\n\n3 \u2013 Giving short notice\n\nOnce you have decided to make the move to the new company as hard as it is to contain your excitement and not get in your car and go to the new job immediately after your resign, but your know what they say, patience is a virtue.\n\n4 \u2013 Not resigning in person\n\nAn example of what you could say in your conversation with your manager is, \"I have called this meeting today to say thank you for everything you have taught me in my time with the company. As tough a decision as this has been, I have decided it is time to take the next step in my life and therefore I am resigning.\"\n\nREAD MORE: If you've ever struggled with the question \u201cWhat are your salary expectations?\u201d here's a brilliant way to answer it\n\n5 \u2013 Not assisting with the handover\n\nIf you are given the opportunity to work your notice period. Take the time to work closely with whomever will be taking over from you and help ensure that they have everything they need when you are no longer there. Not only is this a very professional way to exit the company but it will also show the integrity you have.\n\nEmployees who stagnate longer in a given role are significantly more likely to leave their employer for their next job, even after controlling. Change is essential.\n\n6 \u2013 Leaving behind personal information\n\nBefore you resign make sure you have deleted all your personal details off your computer and make sure you have the contact details of all the colleagues you still want to stay in contact with.\n\nSign up to W24\u2019s newsletters so you don't miss out on any of our hot stories and giveaways.", "description": "Thank you for the opportunity but I\u2019m done, *slams the door*.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9470/c351e54793934244a4e732c8180b1f89.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
