REUTERS/David W Cerny/File Photo\n\nThe Prague-based lender, which has a sizeable Chinese business, could launch its initial public offering as soon as this month, and is seeking to raise more than $1 billion from the offering in the first of a series of significant IPOs planned in the city.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s markets have been weakened by frequently violent pro-democracy protests and political turmoil over the past three months, slashing a 12% gain for the year to June on the blue-chip Hang Seng Index .HIS to a 3% positive performance by Monday. By contrast the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 .SPI is up 18.8% so far this year.\n\nPolice fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse demonstrators in the Central business district and the upmarket Causeway Bay shopping district on Sunday, as the city endures its worst social unrest since its handover from British rule to China in 1997.\n\nLast month, Alibaba (BABA.N) dealt the city\u2019s investment professionals a blow when it delayed plans for a $15 billion listing in Hong Kong, choosing to hold off until the city\u2019s politics and its markets had stabilized, Reuters reported.\n\nThat deal delay came soon after brewing giant AB InBev (ABI.BR) pulled the $10 billion IPO of its Asia-Pacific operations, citing market conditions.\n\nHome Credit\u2019s forthcoming IPO will be a key gauge of sentiment as typically the last four months of the year are the busiest in Hong Kong for public floats, accounting for an average 51% of the funds raised annually over the past decade, according to Refinitiv data.\n\nShanghai Henlius Biotech, a developer of innovative drugs and biosimilars - which are not exact replicas but are as effective as the original drug - is also expected to launch an IPO of up to $500 million this week.\n\nHillhouse-backed Topsports International Holdings begins informal investor meetings this week according to a term sheet reviewed by Reuters, ahead of a float expected to seek about $1 billion.\n\nVALUATION PUSHBACK\n\nSo far this year, companies have raised $10.8 billion in new listings in Hong Kong - well short of the $16.5 billion raised between Shanghai and Shenzhen, and the $38.4 billion raised in New York.\n\nThe political uncertainty is making investors cautious and will weigh on valuations, bankers have warned.\n\n\u201cIn good markets, generally good issuers would have a bigger say in deal terms and valuations, but that\u2019s not the case any more as the Hong Kong market has turned volatile,\u201d said a banker involved in one of the deals poised to launch. \u201cThe upcoming issuers have to be more realistic and moderate on valuations if they want to get the deal done.\u201d\n\nHome Credit\u2019s week-long informal investor meetings were scheduled to take in cities including Hong Kong, Singapore and London before finishing in New York on Wednesday, according to sources with knowledge of the plans.\n\nThe lender, which focuses on point-of-sale loans as well as cash loans and revolving loan products, has an extensive Chinese business that accounts for almost two thirds of its total loan portfolio.\n\n\u201cThe business (of Home Credit) is definitely a good one and they have great market position. It\u2019s just whether the current market environment can deliver a deal that they think they deserve,\u201d said one source with knowledge of the deal.\n\nAs well as Home Credit, Shanghai Henlius Biotech and Topsports, Chinese lender Bank of Guizhou began meeting with potential investors last week for an IPO of up to $1 billion, while baby-formula maker China Feihe is due to seek approval on Thursday from Hong Kong\u2019s Listing Committee for a float of about the same amount, sources said.\n\n\u201cWith all the uncertain, unpredictable factors in mind, investors would become way more cautious about issuers\u2019 target valuations,\u201d said a banker involved in one of the deals.\n\nHome Credit, Henlius, Topsports, Bank of Guizhou and China Feihe declined to comment.
