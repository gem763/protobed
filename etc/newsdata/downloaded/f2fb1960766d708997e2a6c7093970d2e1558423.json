He reiterated his plans to meet with Liu at the White House on Friday, regarded as a good sign.\n\nA White House official said talks had gone very well, \u201cprobably better than expected.\u201d\n\nA smiling Liu waved to reporters before departing the USTR in a black Cadillac, without answering questions. The two sides were due to meet for a final day on Friday.\n\nNegotiators could agree to low-level \u201cearly harvest\u201d agreements on issues such as currencies and copyright protections, despite increased irritants between the world\u2019s two largest economies, a U.S. Chamber of Commerce official briefed by both sides said earlier on Thursday.\n\nMyron Brilliant, the Chamber\u2019s head of international affairs, told reporters that negotiators were \u201ctrying to find a path towards the bigger deal\u201d with progress on market access and less controversial intellectual property and other issues.\n\n\u201cI believe that there\u2019s even the possibility of a currency agreement this week. I think that could lead to a decision by the U.S. administration to not put forth a tariff rate hike on Oct. 15.\u201d\n\nTrump launched the trade war against China with demands for sweeping structural reforms, but Beijing has indicated it is not willing to fundamentally change the way it controls China\u2019s economy. Asked by reporters on Thursday whether he was prepared to accept a \u201csmaller deal,\u201d Trump did not answer and walked away.\n\nPreviously, the president said he did not want to have a more limited deal, preferring to hold out for one that was broad in scope.\n\nSteady escalations of the tit-for-tat tariffs on Chinese and U.S. goods in recent months have roiled financial markets and stoked fears of a global recession.\n\nStocks rose on optimism that talks would yield at least a partial truce, with the S&P 500 .SPX up 0.64% and the Nasdaq .IXIC up 0.6%.\n\n\u2018GREAT SINCERITY\u2019\n\nThe mood surrounding the talks had soured earlier this week when the U.S. government blacklisted 28 Chinese public security bureaus, technology and surveillance firms, including video surveillance gear maker Hikvision (002415.SZ), over allegations of abuses of Muslim minorities in China.\n\nChina's Vice Premier Liu He gestures to the media between U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer (L) and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin before the two countries' trade negotiations in Washington, U.S., October 10, 2019. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\nWashington also restricted visas for certain Chinese officials over the same issue and Beijing was said to be planning to tighten visa restrictions for some U.S. nationals.\n\nBut Chinese officials indicated more willingness to negotiate and avoid further escalation, according to Chinese state media reports.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese side came with great sincerity, willing to cooperate with the U.S. on the trade balance, market access and investor protection,\u201d Xinhua quoted Liu as saying on Thursday.\n\nThe U.S. Agriculture Department said on Thursday that private exporters reported a snap sale of 398,000 tonnes of soybeans to China, part of a flurry of purchases the top buyer of the oilseed has made since granting tariff waivers to some importers to buy U.S. soy as a goodwill gesture.\n\nThe USDA also reported record-large sales of pork, including 18,810 tonnes for shipment this year and 123,362 tonnes for shipment in 2020.\n\nNON-CORE ISSUES\n\nThe two sides have been at loggerheads over U.S. demands that China improve protections of American intellectual property, end cyber theft and the forced transfer of technology to Chinese firms, curb industrial subsidies and increase U.S. companies\u2019 access to largely closed Chinese markets.\n\nThe discussions were not expected to address the most contentious issues in the talks, leaving them for a possible future negotiations.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nBrilliant, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce official, said the intellectual property issues being discussed were largely \u201c20th century IP protections\u201d involving copyright and trademark infringement, not those to protect data flows, computer source code and commercial data.\n\nA currency agreement would likely follow one that was largely agreed in February by Washington and Beijing that would parallel China\u2019s prior G20 pledges to avoid currency manipulation to gain a trade advantage, said Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time to roll that thing out,\u201d said Allen, who also met with Liu on Wednesday. \u201cIt would be a positive, and would make it easier for the U.S. side to sign a deal.\u201d", "description": "Top U.S. and Chinese negotiators wrapped up a first day of trade talks in more than two months on Thursday as business groups expressed optimism the two sides might be able to ease a 15-month trade war and delay a U.S. tariff hike scheduled for next week.", "authors": ["David Lawder", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439414174&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF991AH", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
