But her waters broke at 23 weeks when the device pricked her amniotic sac.\n\nEvelynn, from Titusville in Florida, US, said: \u2018I bent over outside to pick up some rubbish and didn\u2019t feel anything then, but about an hour and a half later, water poured everywhere all over the kitchen floor.\n\nEvelynn\u2019s newly born daughter Ava is being tube-fed in hospital (Picture: SWNS)\n\n\u2018With all my other pregnancies, the doctors had had to pop my waters in the hospital when I was in labour, so I\u2019d never really experienced them breaking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018I got sent to a specialist pregnancy hospital where they pumped me full of antibiotics for a week before I gave birth to Ava at 24 weeks.\n\n\u2018When they pulled her out, the IUD was tucked under her armpit.\u2019\n\nBaby Ava was born weighing just 1lb 13oz, a fifth of the average newborn\u2019s weight, and her eyes remained fused shut for two weeks.\n\nShe had to undergo heart surgery to repair missing skin between her arteries, which were causing her lungs to fill with blood.\n\nA scan of Evelynn\u2019s pregnancy showing the IUD coil underneath her womb (Picture: SWNS)\n\nEvelynn pictured in hospital with her newborn daughter Ava (Picture: SWNS)\n\n\u2018We still don\u2019t know how long it will be before we get to take her home, but everyday she\u2019s with us is a blessing and we will wait as long as it takes to make sure she\u2019s safe.\n\n\u2018She really is my little miracle.\u2019\n\nEvelynn and her husband Justin, 31, are also parents to Alyssia, 12, Andrew, 11, Mason and Madeline, both six, and Lillie Ann, three.\n\nParaGard is an IUD made of copper and plastic that is fitted into the uterus to provide up to 10 years\u2019 pregnancy prevention.\n\nAccording to the ParaGard website, pregnancy with ParaGard is \u2018uncommon but can be life-threatening and may cause infertility or loss of pregnancy\u2019.\n\nThe website claims that \u2018ParaGard is over 99% effective at preventing pregnancy and one of the most effective methods of birth control available.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
