Instead, the iconic JRPG video game series is tied together by recurring design motifs and themes. A piece of music that gets used in every soundtrack. A legendary sword that shows up in every game\u2019s world.\n\nAnd soon, a beloved mascot creature that\u2019ll appear in Japanese convenience stores.\n\nEvery autumn, you can count on two things happening in Japan: the leaves changing colors, and convenience stores selling a lot of piping-hot steamed buns. In addition to the standard pork bun, it\u2019s pretty easy to find buns with curry or sweet bean fillings, but only at FamilyMart can you get your hands on a Moogle Bun.\n\nSince achieving worldwide fame in \"Final Fantasy VI,\" the Moogle has become a constant presence in the series bestiary.\n\nSo what\u2019s inside the 180-yen Moogle Bun? A mixture of salted pork and chicken, plus onion, bamboo shoot, and shiitake mushroom, so yes, it seems that even Moogle tastes like chicken. Speaking of which, FamilyMart is also adding a new flavor to its Pokechiki bite-sized fried chicken lineup: the Kupo Nut Flavor Pokechiki, named after the Moogles\u2019 favorite verbal tick and tasty treat from the \"Final Fantasy\" games.\n\nThe 200-yen Kupo Nut flavor is apparently analogous to barbecue, with a mix of onion, garlic, and tomato notes.\n\nConsidering how tasty the Final Fantasy Limit Break fried chicken we had at FamilyMart\u2019s rival Lawson was earlier this year, we\u2019ve got high hopes for both of these new Moogle snacks, which will be on sale from Oct 15 to Nov 4, and are definitely thinking about following them up with a stack of Moogle honey toast at the Final Fantasy cafe in Tokyo\u2019s Akihabara neighborhood.\n\nSource: Family Mart via Otakomu\n\nRead more stories from SoraNews24.\n\n-- This giant Final Fantasy Moogle bed could be yours, and doesn\u2019t cost a single yen\n\n-- Quite possibly the greatest food bargain in Japan: tasty convenience store pasta for less than a buck\n\n-- Final Fantasy Universal Studios Japan VR roller coaster shown off in cool rider experience videos\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://soranews24.com/2019/09/28/final-fantasy-fried-chicken-and-moogle-steamed-buns-set-to-become-japans-newest-snack-hits/\n\n\u00a9 SoraNews24", "description": "For the most part, \"Final Fantasy\" doesn\u2019t do direct sequels.
