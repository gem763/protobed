This raised concerns among market pundits about progress on the trade front between two of the world\u2019s most powerful economies.\n\nChinese officials were expected to visit the farms as a goodwill gesture but cancelled the tour after President Trump said that he wasn\u2019t interested in making \u201ca partial deal\u201d with China. U.S. farming, from apricots to soybeans, had to bear the brunt of China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs along with extreme weather conditions for quite some time now.\n\nBut, not all hopes were lost! The countries have agreed to maintain communication and have discussed the details of their next round of trade talks in October. What\u2019s more, the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s office confirmed that the recent talks with China have been \u201cproductive.\u201d China\u2019s Commerce Ministry also added that the talks were \u201cconstructive.\u201d\n\nBy the way, China\u2019s senior agricultural representative did confirm that Chinese officials did not cancel plans to visit U.S. farms because of challenges in trade negotiations. Chinese officals, in fact, added that talks did achieve a \u201cgood outcome.\u201d A report by state-backed media group Yicai stated that \u201cthere was a good outcome from the negotiations in the agriculture area too. The two sides had thorough and candid communications.\u201d\n\nThus, the next obvious question is which are the best stocks to keep an eye on given that the recent China-U.S. trade talks have been productive? Strangely, it\u2019s the same companies that suffered the most when the trade war actually erupted.\n\nWalmart\n\nThe world\u2019s largest retailer Walmart Inc. WMT should be a clear winner when the trade issues finally cool off. After all, almost three-fourths of the merchandise sold in Walmart stores are manufactured in China. And a 10% to 15% increase in the prices of goods it imports from China could easily dent Walmart\u2019s bottom line.\n\nWalmart currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current fiscal-year earnings has moved up 1.4% in the past 60 days. You can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWalmart flaunts a Growth Score of A and has outperformed the broader Retail - Supermarkets industry so far this year (+25.6% vs +22.0%).\n\nDeere & Company\n\nOne of the biggest problems Deere & Company DE is facing is diminishing demand from the United States as the company struggles to sell products overseas due to trade tensions.\n\nFor instance, the tariff China imposed on U.S.-grown soya beans has affected the crop\u2019s sale in China. As a result, domestic farmers aren\u2019t interested in buying agricultural equipment, including tractors and pickers from the likes of Deere. Therefore, the company will largely benefit from a halt in the tariff war.\n\nDeere currently has a Zacks Rank #3. The company\u2019s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 6.3%, better than the Manufacturing - Farm Equipment industry\u2019s projected decline of 4.6%. The company has outperformed the broader industry over the past year (+8.3% vs +7.8%).", "description": "Trade deal hopes rekindle after the United States and China held progressive talks in Washington.", "authors": ["Tirthankar Chakraborty"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.fsKEa_aaXPOFuHhJtOBdQ--~B/aD00MDA7dz02MzU7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/zacks.com/f2d75524e94787655701d86f4ac4b0f6", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
