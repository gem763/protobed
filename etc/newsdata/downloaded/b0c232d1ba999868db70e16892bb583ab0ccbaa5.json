Nikita Wilson, who served in the U.S. Army between 2004 and 2014, spent the last half of her military career as a victim\u2019s advocate with the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention division, WKMG reported.\n\n\u201cThis is something I don\u2019t have to think about again, no notices on the door, no question about if I\u2019ll be able to pay it this month or do I have to be concerned about those types of things,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nBefore she received the house, Wilson had been living in a one-bedroom apartment in Tampa and had dreams of becoming a homeowner.\n\nThanks to the donation, Wilson will be able to live in her three-bedroom Pine Hills home mortgage-free while she still works to help other veterans in crisis.\n\n\u201cThe greatest gift of all from this opportunity is a new level of freedom to do what I was created to do. Show people that they can overcome tragedy, see their true worth, rebuild their lives, and pay it forward,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nWilson is not the first veteran to receive a mortgage-free home. A wounded Marine veteran recently received a mortgage-free home in Savannah thanks to the nonprofit Building Homes for Heroes.", "description": "An Army veteran dedicated to helping other veterans in a crisis center received the surprise of a lifetime when she got a mortgage-free home.", "authors": ["Katherine Rodriguez"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/09/american-flag-waving-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
