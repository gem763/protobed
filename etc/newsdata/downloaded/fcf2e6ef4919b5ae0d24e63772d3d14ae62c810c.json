(Matthew Murphy/Kennedy Center)\n\nDance critic\n\nDogs and cats \u201call must, like undertakers, come to dust,\u201d sings the shaggy Old Deuteronomy in \u201cCats,\u201d but he\u2019s lying.\n\nThe musical itself seems to be immortal. Not content with being one of the longest-running Broadway hits ever, with a global gross in the billions, \u201cCats\u201d is now making its debut at the Kennedy Center Opera House. It runs through Oct. 6, newly energized, powerfully sung and flashier than ever in this touring version of the 2016 Broadway revival.\n\nDoes the news make you cheer or sneer? Either way, you\u2019re in good company. If you love \u201cCats,\u201d this production won\u2019t let you down. If you\u2019re \u201cCats\u201d-curious, it\u2019s unlikely to win you over. For a show that begins and ends with feline fascination and goes nowhere in between, \u201cCats\u201d is oddly divisive. It\u2019s hated for lack of plot, a grandiose and oversynthesized Andrew Lloyd Webber score, zombie wigs and more belly stripes than you\u2019ll ever find in nature.\n\nBut \u201cCats\u201d is loved for all the same things, plus the moonlit spectacle \u2014 and most especially for those seriously bendy bodies in their skintight catsuits.\n\nLove it or hate it (I wobble, with my umbrella, right in the middle), \u201cCats\u201d deserves respect.\n\nThe musical brought theater magic to the people. \u201cCats\u201d is to Broadway what \u201cTreasures of Tutankhamun\u201d is to the museum world. Like that mid-1970s exhibit of funerary artifacts, \u201cCats\u201d is a pop-culture milestone, the ur-blockbuster helping to usher in an era of inflamed fandom, unprecedented attendance and gift-shop riches.\n\nLanding on Broadway in 1982, \u201cCats\u201d carved out a role in our cultural imagination as a measure of what the arts can achieve as far as appealing to the masses. The musical is grounded, after all, in the literary prestige of T.S. Eliot\u2019s cat poems. Then there\u2019s all that big music, the sleek but eye-catching costuming, the evocative back-alley design. And through it all, dancing is king. Specifically, ballet dancing, brilliantly devised by Gillian Lynne, the former Sadler\u2019s Wells ballerina. (Andy Blankenbuehler of \u201cHamilton\u201d fame choreographed the current version based on Lynne\u2019s work.)\n\n[Gillian Lynne: A mover and shaker]\n\n\n\nKeri Ren\u00e9 Fuller stars as Grizabella in this tour. (Matthew Murphy/Kennedy Center)\n\nLynne streamlined ballet into a look that is recognizably feline, and with every move, the cast members embody it. She gave \u201cCats\u201d what few other musicals have now: a style.\n\nAlthough \u201cCats\u201d doesn\u2019t succeed as a great musical, it succeeds as a projection of style. The style is established in the dancing and in all the gestures and movements, and it spreads to the actors\u2019 carriage and even, to some extent, to their singing, where crisp enunciation mimics hissing. This musical elevates style to a decisive standard of expression that unfolds and develops throughout the show.\n\nBob Fosse, of course, could do this (think \u201cChicago\u201d with its knife-sharp precision and tension), as could Jerome Robbins and Agnes de Mille. Their shows were shaped all the way through by their unique physical expression of the themes and tone of the show and by their personal preferences and idiosyncrasies. Blankenbuehler, who gave \u201cHamilton\u201d its hip-hop-infused, of-the-moment kinetic drive, is their nearest heir as a choreographer who works in a distinctive style rather than a forgettably generic one. By contrast, many musicals adopt a patchwork of borrowed movement quotes from others. (\u201cThe Prom,\u201d I\u2019m looking at you.) Broadway has become style-challenged.\n\n[Lies, drugs, cheating and all that jazz: Nicole Fosse opens up about her famous Broadway parents]\n\nThe \u201cCats\u201d style is composed largely of slinky, leggy moves, with an operatic emphasis or a jazzed-up sexiness. It\u2019s heavy on big effects: legs kicked high, whizzing aerial turns, thrilling leaps when everyone leaves the stage at once. As Victoria, the white cat with a stretchy, gravity-defying solo, Caitlin Bond deftly handles the most classically shaped dancing. PJ DiGaetano as Mistoffelees leads the cast in a rousing electric circus, his black velvet suit flashing colored lights.\n\nDan Hoy puts his rich voice to good use as the cat leader Munkustrap. Keri Ren\u00e9 Fuller, as Grizabella, belts out a \u201cMemory\u201d to shake the walls.\n\n\n\nBut as much as the individual characters, it is the show\u2019s style that demands attention. It\u2019s so cohesive that the entire cast handles without strain the silky texture of the movement and the sudden, hyper-alert crouches and twitches.\n\nAs they prowl the aisles, you get a good look at the way they carry themselves, shoulders thrown back haughtily. If the menu is limited (and by God, it is \u2014 this is \u201cCats,\u201d not \u201cWest Side Story\u201d), it is wisely selective. Style is maintained.\n\nI applaud the persistence. It\u2019s evidence of the kind of tyrannical power true style requires.\n\nCats, music by Andrew Lloyd Webber, based on the poems of T.S. Eliot. Directed by Trevor Nunn.
