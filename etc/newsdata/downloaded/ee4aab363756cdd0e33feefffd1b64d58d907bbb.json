The company returned the favor, instilling its commitment to corporate social responsibility in a 75-year-old \u201ccredo\u201d inscribed at company headquarters.\n\n\u201cWe believe our first responsibility is to the patients, doctors and nurses, to mothers and fathers and all others who use our products and services. In meeting their needs everything we do must be of high quality.\u201d\n\nJohnson & Johnson opioid ruling explained \u2013 the key points Read more\n\nThe company has been a household name for more than 100 years with a reassuringly cozy image as the quintessential family brand of baby powder, baby shampoo and the maker of Band-Aids. But it is also the name behind a huge range of drugs and medical devices. And in recent years it has been clobbered by lawsuits and huge payouts involving a dizzying array of products, from an anti-psychotic drug to that famous talcum powder and even a patented opium poppy called Norman.\n\nNow, experts are concerned that one of the world\u2019s most recognizable names and most reliable and valuable companies is caught in no less than an existential crisis, and the public is asking: what happened to Johnson & Johnson?\n\nA series of product misfires and court judgments \u2013 with a potential 50,000 more to come and total potential liabilities of $15bn \u2013 is challenging both public trust and investor faith.\n\nThe pharma giant has seen its reputation drop steadily from ninth place to 57th out of 58 leading pharmaceutical companies since 2014, according to one study by the UK reputation intelligence company Alva.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Demonstrators rally to lower the price of a tuberculosis drug outside the Johnson & Johnson campus in Zug, Switzerland, on 17 October.

In 2016 alone, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received 15,043 reports of serious injury or death linked to Xarelto. In March, Johnson & Johnson and co-maker Bayer agreed to pay $775m to settle about 25,000 lawsuits, though neither of the companies admitted liability.\n\nIn July, Johnson & Johnson asked a judge in Trenton, New Jersey, to dismiss as many as 14,000 lawsuits alleging its talc-based baby powder causes ovarian cancer. According to the complaints, which have been moving through the legal system since 1999, the company failed to inform the FDA that at least three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 had found asbestos in its talc \u2013 in one case at levels reported as \u201crather high\u201d.\n\nPrevious efforts to settle the cases have had mixed results and last year, a Missouri jury ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $4.69bn to 22 women.\n\nJohnson & Johnson says its baby powder is safe and does not cause cancer.\n\nAnd on Thursday, the company agreed to a $117m multi-state US settlement over allegations it deceptively marketed its pelvic mesh products, which support women\u2019s prolapsed pelvic organs, but allegedly caused many cases of bleeding, pain and infections.\n\nAn investigation concluded that the company violated state consumer protection laws by not fully disclosing the devices\u2019 risks.\n\n\n\nBut none of those risk as much discomfort as the company\u2019s role in the US opioids crisis, which has claimed 400,000 lives.\n\nEarlier this month, it settled a major lawsuit in a significant climbdown over its prescription painkiller business, just weeks before a multibillion-dollar trial over the public health epidemic.\n\nJohnson & Johnson agreed to pay two Ohio counties a total of $20m to avoid the first in a series of federal trials testing whether opioid painkiller manufacturers, distributors and pharmacy chains are culpable for the worst drug crisis in US history.\n\nAlthough the settlement was relatively small, it potentially opens the door to payouts totaling billions of dollars to 2,000-plus other counties, municipalities and Native American tribes suing over the damage caused by the crisis.\n\nDozens of states are also suing.\n\nThis all follows a ruling in August when the company lost a civil trial over opioids, where a court in Oklahoma ordered it to pay $572m to the state. The judgment, considered a bellwether, was a defeat for the company on principle but was welcomed by investors who had feared an award as high as $2bn.\n\nTrial lawyers called Johnson & Johnson an opioid \u201ckingpin\u201d and argued that it had minimized the painkillers\u2019 addiction risks.\n\nWhile Johnson & Johnson\u2019s stock rose 2% after the verdict, the judgment presented a public relations problem for the company.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A skeleton of pill bottles with protesters outside a courthouse where a judge heard arguments in a lawsuit against Purdue Pharma in Boston, Massachusetts, on 2 August.

They can\u2019t litigate all of them, so are they going to settle?\u201d\n\nLooking back to the 1980s, says crisis management expert Bill Moran, Johnson & Johnson set the standards for corporate responsibility with its swift handling of the crisis when cyanide-laced Tylenol (the company\u2019s branded paracetamol) killed seven in a bottle-tampering spree, quickly withdrawing the product and redesigning the bottle amid a public awareness campaign.\n\nBut now, Moran said: \u201cWith so many legal judgments against them they\u2019re facing an existential crisis.\u201d", "description": "The household name has been hit in recent years with product misfires and court judgments challenging public trust and investor faith", "authors": ["Edward Helmore"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/805d9c29ec92e019331b5bf3c01d8c3548477c84/0_24_2970_1782/master/2970.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=858b6c76d1549339269ff9c01ca3f28e", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
