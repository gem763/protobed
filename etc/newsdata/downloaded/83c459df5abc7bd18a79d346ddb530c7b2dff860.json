The biggest is that the pro-leave vote was due to northerners,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s true some northern areas were strongly pro-Brexit, but the population there is too small to swing the vote.\n\n\u201cThe real support for Brexit, in terms of numbers of votes, was in places like Cornwall, which was 57% for leave, Hampshire with 54%, Essex with 62% and Norfolk with 57%. It is those southern English voters that are dragging Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland unwillingly out of Europe.\n\n\u201cEveryone blames Wigan and Stoke for Brexit but we should really be blaming Cornwall and Devon.\u201d", "description": "Areas of Wales with big English communities saw larger leave vote in 2016, according to study", "authors": ["Frances Perraudin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/620b6c766945127e9ac540078ed9a979ff55acbf/0_0_2043_1226/master/2043.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=827d53117e7531f23f44f9723134a01f", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
