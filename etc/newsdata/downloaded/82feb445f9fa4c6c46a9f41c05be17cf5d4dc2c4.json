It was as chaotic and frightening as most of the rest\n\nOn his 1,000th day as president, Barack Obama flew to North Carolina to launch a bus tour through smaller communities, selling a jobs act he hoped to get through Congress. Those were the days of politics as usual. Donald Trump spent his 1,000th day seemingly hellbent on self-immolation.\n\nThe 45th president was busy on Wednesday, and the rest of this week, strengthening the case for his own impeachment, with a notable assist from his acting chief of staff. If the old rumours are true \u2013 that Trump never wanted to win election, that he would be happier on the golf course, that he is secretly looking for a way out \u2013 it is hard to imagine what more he could have done to bring it about.\n\n\u201cIt was appalling and counter-productive,\u201d said Bob Shrum, a Democratic strategist. \u201cYou have support for impeachment rising, you have the White House admitting impeachable acts in public and you the president holding rallies where he\u2019s out of control. I think the country\u2019s getting tired of it.\u201d\n\nFor critics, this was the week when Trump finally destroyed America\u2019s reputation abroad, committed the most flagrant ethics violation yet to benefit his own business, lost another cabinet member, got outplayed by his old foe Nancy Pelosi yet again and wrote the most embarrassingly puerile letter to a foreign leader in living memory.\n\nThe context was two self-inflicted wounds of conflict in the Middle East and the impeachment inquiry at home. The situation in northern Syria was rapidly deteriorating after Trump ordered the withdrawal of the US military, widely seen as a callous abandonment of Kurdish allies and the worst foreign policy blunder since the Iraq war. Washington remained gripped by House Democrats\u2019 investigation, sparked by Trump pressuring Ukraine to investigate a political rival.\n\nWhat we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown Nancy Pelosi\n\nThe week brought a steady drip of damaging revelations from current and former diplomats and officials behind closed doors. Among them was Fiona Hill, former top Russia adviser at the White House, who reportedly told the inquiry her boss, the then national security adviser, John Bolton, compared efforts to strong-arm Ukraine to a \u201cdrug deal\u201d and described Trump\u2019s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as \u201ca hand grenade who\u2019s going to blow everyone up\u201d.\n\nIf future historians dig up day 1,000 of the craziest show on earth as a time capsule of the Trump presidency, they will not be disappointed. He continued to defend his treatment of the Kurds, who sought help from Russia-backed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.\n\n\u201cSyria may have some help with Russia, and that\u2019s fine,\u201d Trump insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of sand. They\u2019ve got a lot of sand over there. So there\u2019s a lot of sand that they can play with.\u201d\n\nThe Kurds, he said several times, were \u201cnot angels\u201d.\n\nTrump also wrote a letter for the ages to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. \u201cLet\u2019s work out a good deal!\u201d it said. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to be responsible for slaughtering thousands of people, and I don\u2019t want to be responsible for destroying the Turkish economy \u2013 and I will \u2026 Don\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool! I will call you later.\u201d\n\nAt first, no one could quite believe it was real. But it was. Commentators likened it to the writing of a juvenile and suggesting Trump\u2019s grasp of foreign policy was barely more sophisticated.\n\nBrad Simpson, an associate professor at the University of Connecticut, tweeted: \u201cI am a historian of US foreign policy. I have read many, many letters from US presidents to foreign leaders, and I have never read a letter from the US president so unhinged, so threatening, so bizarre, so completely lacking in basic etiquette. Trump is deeply, deeply unwell.\u201d\n\nAs if to prove the point, Trump sat with congressional leaders in the cabinet room and derided his former defense secretary, Jim Mattis, as \u201cthe world\u2019s most overrated general\u201d. Mattis later shot back: \u201cHe also called Meryl Streep an overrated actress. So I guess I\u2019m the Meryl Streep of generals.\u201d He told Pelosi, per her account, \u201cYou are a third-grade politician.\u201d But it was a photograph of her, a lone woman, standing and rebuking him that will endure.\n\n\u201cWhat we witnessed on the part of the president was a meltdown,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat we have done to the Kurds will stand as a bloodstain in the annals of American history Mitt Romney\n\nOn Thursday, the nightmarish torrent continued as the vice-president, Mike Pence, and the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, brokered a five-day ceasefire in Turkey which was criticised for giving Erdo\u011fan everything he wanted. Trump, meanwhile, cut the ribbon at the opening of a new Louis Vuitton factory in Alvarado, describing the French luxury brand as \u201ca name I know very well. It cost me a lot of money over the years.\u201d\n\nLater, speaking at a campaign rally in Dallas, he likened Turkey and the Kurds to children scrapping on a playground.\n\n\u201cIt was unconventional what I did,\u201d he boasted, using a word that defines his political career. \u201cSometimes you have to let them fight a little while. Sometimes you have to let them fight like two kids. Then you pull them apart.\u201d\n\nBack in Washington, where the House of Representatives had voted overwhelmingly to condemn Trump\u2019s withdrawal from Syria, there was a landmark critique from the Senate floor. Mitt Romney of Utah said: \u201cWhat we have done to the Kurds will stand as a bloodstain in the annals of American history. The decision to abandon the Kurds violates one of our most sacred principles \u2013 that the United States stands with our allies.\u201d\n\nAt the White House, there was a rare press briefing. Astonishingly, the acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney confessed there was indeed a quid pro quo with Ukraine, telling reporters the administration held up aid to pressure the country to investigate whether it had helped Democrats in 2016.\n\n\u201cI have news for everybody: get over it,\u201d he said, brazenly driving a coach and horses through Trump\u2019s own denials. \u201cThere is going to be political influence in foreign policy.\u201d\n\nRealising he had shot himself \u2013 and his boss \u2013 in the foot, Mulvaney retracted his statement a couple of hours later and tried to blame the media. But his sincerity seemed doubtful when the Trump re-election campaign began selling t-shirts emblazoned with the legend: \u201cGet over it.\u201d The \u201co\u201d even had Trump\u2019s peculiar blond hair.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi stands and speaks during a meeting at the White House. Photograph: White House/Reuters\n\nMichael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: \u201cIt does not help when you have Mr Mulvaney stand at the podium and say, \u2018Oh yeah, we do all quid pro quos all the time in foreign policy,\u2019 and then put out a statement because he realised he\u2019d screwed it up for the president.\u201d\n\nSteele reflected: \u201cWhen you take this week and look at the totality of the storylines and narratives that emerged, my analysis leads me to believe that what the president is doing is reacting to a tightening of events around him. They are closing in on him from so many directions at the same time that there is no way out.\u201d\n\nYet Mulvaney had another surprise. He announced that Trump would host next year\u2019s G7 summit at his own Doral resort in Florida. Following widespread anger and disbelief, the president made a rare and humiliating climbdown on Saturday night, tweeting that the decision had been reversed, \u201cbased on both media & Democrat crazed and irrational hostility\u201d, and he would seek an alternative venue.\n\nMulvaney admitted to a quid pro quo with Ukraine. Was that a genius move? | Cas Mudde Read more\n\nAll this \u2026 and Rick Perry too. The energy secretary, who had been drawn into the Ukraine scandal, told Trump that he would quit the cabinet \u2013 crowning a thousand days of turmoil that have seen record White House turnover.\n\nBy then, Fiona Hill\u2019s testimony felt like a lifetime ago and Washington was crying for mercy and a rest. But there were reports from Syria of Turkish mortar fire breaking the ceasefire. Trump said he had just spoken to Erdo\u011fan and \u201cthere\u2019s a ceasefire, or a pause, or whatever you want to call it\u201d.\n\nThe coming weeks are likely to bring only more turmoil on the road to impeachment, to be followed by a trial in the Senate as Trump tests his conception of absolute authority to destruction.\n\nWendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University in Rhode Island, said: \u201cThis is the man who said he could shoot someone in the middle of Manhattan and get away with it.\n\n\u201cHe believes the president is all powerful and can get away with anything. The House is saying there should be constraints on a president and that is resonating with the people. He\u2019s pushing the envelope because he\u2019s pushing it for his whole presidency. Now he\u2019s probably going to go down as the third president in history to be impeached \u2013 and it\u2019s driving him crazy.\u201d", "description": "The 1,000th day of a norm-busting presidency arrived this week.
