Earlier, the leading PC manufacturer introduced a pair of budget Android slates in the form of the Tab M7 and M8, Yesterday, Lenovo added another pair to the collection, though these have some more intriguing features than their cheaper cousins.\n\nThe new Yoga Smart Tab and Smart Tab M8 are part of Lenovo's smart home strategy, with both models featuring Google Assistant built in to control smart lights and outlets and the like right from your tablet. That control comes either when you're using it in your hands or when it's nearby, thanks to built-in mics and voice recognition.\n\nAs is typical for Yoga-branded products, the Yoga Smart Tab features higher-end touches compared to the Smart Tab M8. These include a bigger, higher-resolution screen (1,920x1,080 10.1-inch versus 1,280x800 8-inch), beefier processor (octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 439 versus quad-core MediaTek A22 Tab) and more memory and storage (3GB versus 2GB and 32GB versus 16GB, respectively). It also includes a kickstand that allows the tablet to be used in four different modes and technology to limit blue light emission that can lead to eye fatigue.\n\nThe Smart Tab M8 may lack the more luxurious Yoga experience, but it's also half the price. It comes with an extra that the Tab M7 and M8 ship without: a Smart Charging Station accessory that enables Google Assistant's Ambient Mode, which leaves it always \"on\" to receive your voice commands. If you don't need the portability of a tablet, but want similar functionality, Lenovo has also released an update to its Smart Display product. The latest model has a thinner bezel around its 7-inch touchscreen, improved ambient lighting for photo display, and front-facing speakers.\n\nThe Yoga Smart Tab will be available this month starting at $250, while the Smart Tab M8 and the updated Smart Display will go on sale next month for $120 and $130, respectively.", "description": "The company envisions the 10.1-inch Yoga with distinctive kickstand and the 8-inch M8 with Smart Charging Station as smart home tools as much as entertainment devices.", "authors": ["Sean Portnoy"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/06/183f399a-4e7b-4729-a706-c4e61ea6b611/thumbnail/770x578/f137c9633ce9c02bd8391acc6c82eaf1/lenovo-smart-ab-m8-android-tablet-google-assistant.png", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
