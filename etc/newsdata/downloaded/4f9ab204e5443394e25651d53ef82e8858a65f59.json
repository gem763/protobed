I like it. It's a good stock,\" said Jim Cramer to a caller during the 'Lightning Round' segment of Mad Money on Monday night.\n\nNextEra, in addition to wind and solar, owns and operates generating plants powered by natural gas, nuclear energy, and oil. Let's check the charts.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of NEE, below, we can see an impressive movement from the lower left to the upper right of the chart. NEE has spent nearly the entire time above the rising 50-day moving average line. The 200-day moving average line is bullish too and it was last tested in January. Prices are a bit extended above the 200-day line but that does not necessarily mean we will have a correction.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line has been rising the past 12 months and confirms the price advance. Buyers of NEE have been more aggressive.\n\nThe Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is pointed up in a buy configuration above the zero line.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of NEE, below, we can see that prices have doubled in the past three years. The rising 40-week moving average line has done an excellent job in defining the uptrend and identifying a number of buying opportunities.\n\nThe weekly OBV line is bullish and so is the MACD oscillator on this time frame.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of NEE, below, we have an upside price objective of $237.\n\nBottom line strategy: Maintain longs and add to longs risking to $215.", "description": "Let's check those charts....NEE", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "The Charts Say Nextera Energy Is Headed Higher", "Let'S Check Those Charts.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "James", "Rev Shark", "Timothy Collins", "Carolyn Boroden", "Chris Versace", "Stephen Guilfoyle"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/13f0cbe4-3688-11e8-9dab-c10762dd3ce1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
