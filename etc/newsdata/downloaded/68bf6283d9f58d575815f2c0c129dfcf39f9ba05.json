More than that, they amount to an attempt to destroy his party and, indeed, democracy itself. I am disappointed that he is stepping down as an MP because I would love to see him beaten at the next Election. And beaten he would undoubtedly be.'\n\nAt the 2016 referendum, West Dorset voted 51 per cent to 49 per cent in favour of Brexit.\n\nMr Loder, who was born in Sherborne in the constituency, said locals now wanted the referendum result honoured and the Brexit deal delivered. He said: 'I have been to all corners of this constituency since I was selected. There's a desire to get it [Brexit] done and move on.'\n\nMr Loder, 38, previously chairman of the Tory constituency association, said Sir Oliver's stance was infuriating local voters\n\nIn a motion backed by the Commons yesterday, Sir Oliver delayed any approval for Mr Johnson's deal and effectively required the Prime Minister to comply with the so-called Benn Act and ask Brussels for a Brexit extension.\n\nBut Mr Loder, 38, previously chairman of the Tory constituency association, said Sir Oliver's stance was infuriating local voters. He told The Mail on Sunday: 'Here on the streets of Sherborne today, people are angrier than I have ever known them.'\n\nHe added: 'People have great respect for Sir Oliver as a constituency MP, but it's becoming very difficult to trust what he is saying.\n\n'Bear in mind we, as a Conservative Party, stood on a manifesto in 2017 to deliver Brexit. All of us have wanted to do it with a deal if we possibly can.'\n\nHouse of Commons speaker John Bercow calls the house to order on Saturday, October 19\n\nFarmer's son Mr Loder pledged his support for Mr Johnson's deal and signalled the constituency now wanted an MP who would actually represent their views. He said: 'What people here are now looking for more than anything is to have a new MP here in West Dorset who respects the democratic will of this constituency.'\n\nSir Oliver, who had a majority of more than 19,000 at the last Election, also came under attack from his nearest neighbour in the constituency \u2013 beef farmer Mike Turner, who lives in the village of Synderford, near Thorncombe.\n\nMr Turner, 74, dismissed the MP's actions as 'plain wrong'.\n\nHe added: 'People are not happy about this. Politicians such as Letwin have got to respect democracy and allow this deal to be done. Because I live near him I get people telling me to have a word in his ear. Sometimes a bit more than a word.'\n\nIn Thorncombe's community-run cafe and shop \u2013 where Sir Oliver is among the volunteers \u2013 staff were equally unsympathetic to their MP's actions. Assistant Cheryl Glazier, 54, said: 'He is a valued volunteer but my opinion is that the country needs to get on with leaving.'\n\nSpeaking before MPs controversially backed Sir Oliver's delay motion, cafe customer Clive Lewis, 60, said: 'If he succeeds in delaying Brexit, it will be a disaster.'\n\nSpeaking ahead of yesterday's debate, Sir Oliver (pictured) insisted he was only proposing the delay as an 'insurance policy' to prevent the UK from crashing out on October 31 without a formal agreement. He insisted he would support the Prime Minister's deal\n\nDorset Tory councillor Mary Penfold added: 'People are becoming more and more impatient and we need to support the PM.'\n\nPrivately, party workers and councillors were even angrier. One said: 'It is the last thing we need. It drags the country back yet again and gives our political opponents another weapon. What is he thinking? It's unacceptable.'\n\nHowever, in the MP's village, there was some support for him \u2013 albeit from someone who admitted she was 'not a natural Tory voter'. Margaret Fraser, 76, said: 'Sir Oliver is doing this because he is cautious. Is that such a bad thing?'\n\nThe West Dorset MP was one of 21 Tory MPs who were stripped of the whip last month after voting to block a No Deal Brexit.\n\nSpeaking ahead of yesterday's debate, Sir Oliver insisted he was only proposing the delay as an 'insurance policy' to prevent the UK from crashing out on October 31 without a formal agreement. He insisted he would support the Prime Minister's deal.", "description": "Rebel alliance leader Sir Oliver Letwin faced a furious backlash from his Leave-voting constituency on Friday for thwarting Boris Johnson's Brexit deal.", "authors": ["Brendan Carlin", "Nick Constable For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/21/19935572-0-image-a-98_1571516596625.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
