Plus, this woman shares her heartbreaking rape story to help others.\n\nThe woman says she remembers little of the attack but recalls being in intense pain.\n\n\u201cI remember being very drunk and falling over a lot and then I was in the toilets of the club in so much pain, not wanting to get out, and then I remember being on the street, sitting on the sidewalk,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI was very swollen, I could barely walk and there was a lot of bruising. I was very scared.\u201d\n\nThe men filmed their 16-minute attack, rearranged the woman\u2019s outfit and then left her in the nightclub toilets.\n\nProsecutor Allison Hunter QC said that CCTV footage of the men leaving the club depicts them \u201chugging, high-fiving each other \u2026 laughing.\u201d\n\nThe men admitted to playing the footage of the rape back in a joking fashion.\n\nWant to go steady?
