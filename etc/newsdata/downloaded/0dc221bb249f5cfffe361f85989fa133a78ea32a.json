It did so, in part, by offering a counterintuitive way out of the quandary of game-play\u2019s fundamental aggravation: Someone has to play the game, but that someone needn\u2019t be you. It might even be more fun not to play the game than to play it. Untitled Goose Game is about work\u2019s ubiquity in the guise of one about leisure\u2019s frivolity. And like all labor, the best way to get it done is to farm it out to others. Let the memers honk their geese so you don\u2019t have to.\n\nGame-play\u2014the work of working a game\u2014is fundamentally irritating, at least by comparison to other media forms. It\u2019s easy to pass the eyes over the pages of a book, or to bathe in the waves of image and sound at the cinema or in your living room. Moreover, these forms skip over the boring parts by editing them out: You don\u2019t have to watch a character traverse the stairs, sidewalk, subway, and elevator to get from home to work. But in games, you are the character, and thus you must pilot him (or her, but usually him) through every detail that the simulated world demands. Role-playing gamers sometimes talk about \u201cgrinding\u201d\u2014 completing boring, repetitive tasks to advance their character\u2019s abilities in order to make progress\u2014a term that exactly mirrors the drudgery and toil of labor.\n\nThe game theorist Julian K\u00fcchlich even coined a portmanteau, playbor, to describe the fusion of work and leisure in contemporary life. In Farmville, for example, players exploit their network of friends and acquaintances to advance their progress in the game, and thereby the material benefit of Zynga, the company that publishes the game. In Super Mario Maker, players pay for a software product that invites labor: making Super Mario Bros.levels for other owners of the software to play. Playbor isn\u2019t just for games, either: It also describes the digital economy more broadly. When you post to Instagram or Twitter or Facebook, for example, your leisure (sharing with friends) doubles as unpaid work for social-network services, which use the results to sow others\u2019 leisure. Likewise, when you feel obliged to check work email or Slack at all hours, you confuse work with leisure until no boundary exists between the two.\n\nRead: Video Games Are Better Without Characters\n\nBut email is undeniably work, at least, and social media can be construed as interpersonal communication. Games, by contrast, are supposed to be entertainment\u2014and yet they demand toil in leisure\u2019s pursuit. The game designer Paolo Pedercini sees that contradiction as a fundamental feature of the medium. Games, he argues, are the aesthetic form of instrumental reason\u2014that is, order, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness as art. Tetris aspires for the rule of order rule over disarray; Civilization presents natural resources as a means to global domination. Solutions, control, metrics, and outcomes rule. Even when a game does not literally exploit its players\u2019 leisure for its creator\u2019s gain, it orients the player toward formal, often numerical goals that structure progress and, by extension, define enjoyment. The fact that consultants and entrepreneurs have applied game metrics like points, levels, and badges in institutional settings, dubbing the effort gamfication, only further entrenches the connection between games and work.", "description": "Untitled Goose Game is fun.
