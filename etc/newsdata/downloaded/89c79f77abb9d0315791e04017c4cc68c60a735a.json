He also faced intense criticism from Congress.\n\nThe Federal Reserve has forbidden the bank from growing any larger until it improves its ability to manage and communicate risks across the entire company, and interim CEO Allen Parker earlier this year declined to speculate how soon that could be accomplished. \u201cWe have a substantial amount of work yet to do,\u201d he said in April.\n\nScharf \u2014 who will run the San Francisco-based lender from New York \u2014 was already leading one of the largest banks in the country.
