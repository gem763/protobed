I will never allow it. The criminals will surely face justice,\" Hasina told reporters as she pledged to inflict the \"highest punishment to the killers\".\n\nProtesters have called for the attackers to be harshly punished and for the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), the student wing of Hasina's party, to be banned.\n\n\"Today it is Fahad Abrar and tomorrow it could be any of us. These dorms have turned into a nightmare for students. We demand an end to torture,\" Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology student Fahim Ahmed told AFP.\n\nThe prime minister stopped short of acceding to the protesters' other demand that politics be banned on campuses, saying it was up to individual universities.\n\nFahad had been seen -- in leaked CCTV footage that went viral on social media -- walking into a dormitory with some BCL activists late Monday.\n\nAbout six hours later, his body was carried out by the students and laid on the ground, the footage showed.\n\nThe BCL has earned notoriety in recent years after some of its members were accused of killing, violence and extortion.\n\nLast year its members allegedly used violence to suppress a major anti-government student protest.\n\nThe outfit's president and general secretary were sacked last month over allegations they tried to extort money from a state-run university.\n\nThe United Nations in Bangladesh said the student died \"allegedly for freely expressing his views\".\n\n\"Campus violence in Bangladesh has over the years affected and claimed too many lives, with apparent impunity for those bearing responsibility,\" the global body added in a Facebook post.", "description": "Bangladesh's prime minister on Wednesday vowed to mete out the \"highest punishment to the killers\" of a university student who died after he criticised a deal the leader made with India.
