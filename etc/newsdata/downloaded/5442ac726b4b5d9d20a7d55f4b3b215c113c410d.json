But he is in no doubt about the best of them; Enable.\n\nAt 48, Dettori is approaching the twilight of his career - although there are no signs of it in his riding. British racing is dreading the day the sport's most outgoing personality hangs up his boots and even the jockey, who is giving Peter Pan a lesson in the preservation of youth, knows his clock is ticking.\n\nJockeys, generally, are not a sentimental bunch; they get on, get off, move on to the next one and leave all the loving to the stable lads. The catalyst for a jockey's admiration is nearly always governed by ability.\n\nBut few Flat jockeys can claim a love affair with a horse like that enjoyed by Dettori and the mare. When she goes, pointed out her trainer John Gosden tongue in cheek recently, at least the yard outside her stable will no longer be littered by Dettori's discarded Polo wrappings.\n\nOn Sunday, thousands of British racegoers will follow Enable to Paris as she attempts to become the first horse to win three Prix de l'Arc de Triomphes, a feat which would put her at the top - or very close to it - of the great race mares of all time.", "description": "Frankie Dettori's career, spanning three decades, 17 domestic Classic wins, including the Epsom Derby twice, 14 Breeders' Cups and six Prix de l'Arc de Triomphes (and counting) is never going to be defined by one horse.", "authors": ["Marcus Armytage", "Racing Correspondent", "Paul Hayward"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/racing/2019/10/05/TELEMMGLPICT000142440930-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqH5FQodmmGw6761NrJW4SILuh1nWfQKdr2D4KVexrPYQ.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
