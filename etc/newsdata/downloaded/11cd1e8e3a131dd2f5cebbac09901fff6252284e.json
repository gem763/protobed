He\u2019s a class player and he\u2019s really confident at the moment. He\u2019s going well. We\u2019ve got some plans for him \u2013 but we\u2019ve just got to execute them a bit better.\u201d\n\nAustralia still hold the whip hand knowing one win from the remaining two Tests will retain the urn. As well as dropping Usman Khawaja for the returning Steve Smith \u2013 the right\u2011hander is newly restored to No 1 in the Test batting rankings \u2013 Paine hinted strongly at a recall for Mitchell Starc\u2019s left-arm pace.\n\nEngland have also made a change for what tends to be the bounciest surface in the country as the 6ft 5in Craig Overton comes in for Chris Woakes. It is another seamer who has seemingly got under Paine\u2019s skin, however, after Jofra Archer\u2019s assertion that Australia \u201cpanicked\u201d in Leeds.\n\nPaine said: \u201cJofra\u2019s entitled to his opinion, he\u2019s had plenty of those that\u2019s for sure. We made some mistakes, it happens, we\u2019ve addressed it as a team. We\u2019ve spoken about it honestly. I was certainly one of those people who made mistakes. It happens, we\u2019ve moved on and we\u2019re here ready for a great Test match.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest England\u2019s Ben Stokes concentrates on his timing on the eve of the fourth Ashes Test.

Steve has missed one Test match, he hasn\u2019t been out for 12 months. He came back from a 12-month layoff pretty well, so I expect he will handle six days without batting pretty well.\u201d\n\nThe 12-month absence alluded to followed Smith\u2019s role last year in the ball\u2011tampering scandal, something Paine was happy to make light of when the subject of reverse swing arose. Old Trafford has a reputation for the phenomenon and though a green square may not be conducive this time around, it furthers Starc\u2019s claims for a first outing of the series.\n\nAshes: Craig Overton replaces Chris Woakes for England in fourth Test Read more\n\nAsked whether his side will change their ball management methods with reverse swing in mind, Paine said with a smile: \u201cNo, we just use saliva and shine it on our pants. That\u2019s the way we look after the ball. That won\u2019t change this Test match.\n\n\u201cBut certainly the dryness of the square as well can play a part in that and Starc is a great exponent of reverse swing if he can get it to happen. If that is the case he will be a dangerous proposition.\u201d\n\nPaine\u2019s opposite number, Joe Root, was hopeful the feelgood factor from this summer\u2019s World Cup win and Headingley rolls on. But this will hinge chiefly on how his batting lineup, fresh from a Jekyll and Hyde performance \u2013 67 all out followed by a record chase of 359 \u2013 fare.\n\nAustralia do their best to forget while England remember Craig Overton | Vic Marks Read more\n\nJason Roy has dropped from opener to No 4 in a swap with Joe Denly and a concession that the Surrey right-hander, averaging 9.5 this series, will need the shine taken off the Dukes ball to produce his best.\n\nRoot said: \u201cIt\u2019s not gone exactly how we\u2019d have liked and [Roy] hasn\u2019t scored the runs he would have liked. We\u2019re still trying to find a formula that works for us. It\u2019s been difficult in English conditions and it\u2019s not just us, every side that has come over the top order have not performed.\n\n\u201cJason is a high-quality player and could be better suited to four. We all know what he can do when he gets himself in and hopefully batting a little lower down helps him to do that.\u201d\n\nOverton\u2019s recall comes off the back of 32 wickets at 21 from eight appearances for Somerset this season. The 25-year-old has experience of Ashes cricket too, having played twice during the 2017-18 series and opened his account in Adelaide with the prized scalp of Smith.\n\nRoot said: \u201cThe extra bounce of a taller bowler gives us a different option on a ground that does perform slightly differently. It will balance our attack really well in these conditions.\n\n\u201cCraig is a competitor. You saw him come into Ashes cricket on debut and looked very much at home and got himself in a battle. I expect him to do that again this week.\u201d\n\nOn Stokes, enjoying a golden summer and with two centuries already this series, Root said: \u201cHe\u2019s a great team man who will go out of his way to help anyone. He will always offer advice and is a brilliant senior player and leader who has a good balance of when to say the right things. He\u2019s very passionate and just a genuinely good bloke. The skill and ability he has is a great combination.\u201d", "description": "The Australia captain has been worrying how to get Ben Stokes out in the fourth Ashes Test at Old Trafford", "authors": ["Ali Martin"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f29f7c730f7aab9f17a323f9f10c371e469f221e/0_104_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b2012d4c5661744aaf742bedaa283091"}
