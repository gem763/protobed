Esper said Sunday that President Trump ordered a withdrawal of American forces from northern Syria, a decision that will effectively cede control of the area to the Syrian government and Russia, and could allow a resurgence of the Islamic State.\n\nMr. Esper, appearing on both Fox News and CBS News, said that American troops, mostly Special Operations forces, would move south but not leave the country in the face of Turkey\u2019s incursion into the section of Syria controlled by Kurdish forces, a group of fighters trained and backed by the United States government.\n\nThe Pentagon has slow-walked previous orders by Mr. Trump to evacuate from Syria, to protect its Kurdish partners and hold the ground it took back from the Islamic State. But Mr. Esper\u2019s comments Sunday indicated that this time Mr. Trump\u2019s drawdown order was being acted on with haste.\n\nThe bulk of the roughly 1,000 troops in Syria are positioned in the northeastern part of the country, and the new orders will push those troops further south. Military officials said plans remained fluid, and it was not clear how far the troops would withdraw to. But in any case, the implications were clear: American forces will not be coming to the aid of their Kurdish allies in the face of the Turkish-backed offensive.", "description": "The decision effectively cedes control of the area and could allow a resurgence of ISIS, but the secretary argued American forces would not have deterred the Turkish invasion.", "authors": ["Julian E.
