It also results in ocean pollution with microplastics, and according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), uses some 93 billion cubic metres of water \u2013 enough to meet the needs of five million people \u2013 annually.\n\nRead also: The fashion industry emits more carbon than international flights and maritime shipping combined. Here are the biggest ways it impacts the planet.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that the rise of fast fashion encourages consumers to buy and get rid of apparel at alarming rates.\n\nAccording to a Business Insider article, 85 per cent of all textiles are brought to the dump each year. UNCTAD further estimates that every second, the equivalent of one garbage truck of textiles is landfilled or burned.\n\nIn Singapore, a new survey has found that while as many as 60 per cent of Singaporeans are aware of fashion\u2019s impact on the environment, most do not do anything to change the way they shop for clothes.\n\nRead also: Singapore households waste S$342 million worth of food \u2013 or 68.4 million plates of nasi lemak \u2013 a year\n\nThe YouGov survey commissioned by DBS found that seven in 10 Singaporeans do not make sure that the clothes they buy are sustainably made and sourced.\n\nThe main barriers to changing consumption behaviour were identified as cost (35 per cent), apathy (25 per cent) and a lack of variety and style (18 per cent).\n\nAccording to DBS, seven in 10 Singaporeans buy new clothes at least once every six months\n\nThere is one consolation though: 70 per cent of the 1,060 consumers surveyed said they were open to recycling, swapping or upcycling their clothes if \u201cgiven the right nudge\u201d.\n\nRead also: I quit fast fashion a year ago and discovered 9 reasons to never go back\n\nTo raise awareness on the issue, DBS launched an augmented reality game called \u201cFashion Slowdown\u201d on the Facebook app. The game requires users to blink, and urges players to host a clothes swap or sell their old clothes online.\n\nThe bank has also based the fourth episode of its mini-series Sparks season two on the real life story of Sissi Chao, the 27-year-old founder of REmakeHub. The Shanghai-based social enterprise is dedicated to addressing waste pollution in the fashion industry, through solutions such as recycling and making turning waste into fashion apparel.\n\nKaren Ngui, managing director and head of group strategic marketing and communications at DBS, urged consumers to make small changes in their behaviour for a collective difference.\n\n\u201cEach and every one of us has a responsibility to do our part, be it in big ways or small everyday ways, to reduce our carbon footprint,\u201d she said, adding that the community can \u201creduce, reuse, recycle and adopt more socially-conscious, environmentally-friendly consumption habits\u201d.\n\nRead also: 15 easy things you can do to help the Earth\n\nDBS said that over 200 of its staff swapped over 200kg of clothing at its first-ever clothes swap event in March this year. According to the bank, that is equivalent to saving more than 375,000 litres of water. A second run of the event is slated to happen for employees in October.\n\nFashion waste is one of four sustainability interest groups established by the bank earlier this year. The other three interest pillars are food, plastic and paper waste.\n\nRead also:", "description": "Business Insider - [caption id=\"attachment_1130500\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1000\"] Shoppers shopping at stores during the Great Singapore Sale (GSS) in June 2017.[/caption] Saving the environment may be at the top of this generation's to-do list,\u2026.
