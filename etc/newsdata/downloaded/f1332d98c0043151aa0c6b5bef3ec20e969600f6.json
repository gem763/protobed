The hate group makes money and President Trump makes money. It's a win-win for bigotry.\"\n\nThe club has long raised ethics concerns against Trump after he hosted world leaders there and doubled the price of the private club's initiation fee.", "description": "The club is just one part of Trump's business network that has sparked concerns over ethics guidelines and possible pay-for-play association.", "authors": ["Ellen Cranley"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d98c5275288792128247464?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
