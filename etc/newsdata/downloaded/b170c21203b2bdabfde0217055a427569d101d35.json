Between 10 and 15% of the children of Alzheimer's patients will themselves develop symptoms of the disease.\n\nDiagnosis an average of 13 years earlier when both parents have dementia\n\nThe researchers examined medical records and interviewed the participants and their close friends and family members to determine the age at which dementia began to appear in each participant as well as in their parents. People who had one parent with dementia themselves developed the symptoms an average of six years earlier than the average age their parents were when they were diagnosed. When both parents had dementia, symptoms appeared an average of 13 years earlier in their adult children.\n\nAlthough the researchers assessed multiple factors including genes, cardiovascular disease and education, they found that these factors did not fully determine the cause of earlier symptom manifestation in the adult children.\n\n\". . . [P]eople with two parents with dementia developed the disease much younger than people with one parent. That suggests that it's more than just changes in diagnostic criteria or social attitudes. People with two parents with dementia may have a double dose of genetic or other risk factors that pushes them toward a younger age at onset,\" explained Dr. Day in a statement.\n\n\"Although we're not yet at the point where we can modify people's genes, we can begin to explore how these genes may accelerate or slow down the onset of dementia in these individuals. By learning more about the effect of these genes on Alzheimer's disease, we may be able to develop novel treatments.\"", "description": "New research by American researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis indicates that adults whose parents have dementia are likely to develop the same symptoms an average of six years earlier.
