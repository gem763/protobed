Nearly 60% of the respondents opposed Cho as justice minister. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\n\nMoon, who is currently on a trip to Southeast Asia, asked the National Assembly to submit a hearing report on Cho by Friday, his office said Tuesday, indicating he is leaning toward appointing Cho despite the controversy.\n\nWhile South Korean lawmakers can submit confirmation hearing reports to express support or disapproval of ministerial candidates, the president doesn't necessarily need parliamentary approval to appoint nominees other than the prime minister.", "description": "South Korean reporters have grilled President Moon Jae-in's nominee for justice minister for 11 hours over suspected ethical lapses surrounding his family that have triggered an intense political row and cut into Moon's popularity ratings.
