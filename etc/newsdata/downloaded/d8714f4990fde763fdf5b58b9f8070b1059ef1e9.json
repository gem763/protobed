But that doesn\u2019t mean Democrats are right to start an impeachment process.\n\nRemember, impeachment is a political process, not a legal one. There is no obligation to prosecute. Congress is supposed to do what is in the best interest of the country. And this process could be very bad for America:\n\nThis will probably achieve nothing. To actually remove Trump from office, at least 20 Republican senators would have to vote to convict him. If you think that will happen because of this incident, you haven\u2019t been paying attention to the Senate Republicans over the past two and a half years.\n\nUsually when a leader takes a big risk, it\u2019s because there\u2019s a big upside. But Nancy Pelosi is taking a giant risk and there is little upside. At the end of this process Trump will probably be acquitted by the Senate. He will declare himself vindicated and victorious in his battle against The Swamp. An ugly backlash could ensue \u2014 in both parties.\n\nThis is completely elitist. We\u2019re in the middle of an election campaign. If Democrats proceed with the impeachment process, it will happen amid candidate debates, primaries and caucuses. Elections give millions and millions of Americans a voice in selecting the president. This process gives 100 mostly millionaire senators a voice in selecting the president.", "description": "This political brawl will leave Trump victorious.", "authors": ["David Brooks"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/opinion/26brooksWeb/26brooksWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
