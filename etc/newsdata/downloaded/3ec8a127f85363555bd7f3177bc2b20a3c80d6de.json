Every town. At this year\u2019s Edinburgh festival fringe, her sold-out, roof-raising show To Catch a Dick narrowly missed out on the big prize, making her the first black British woman to be nominated. In Atlanta, Georgia, she recently did a standup gig for an African-American crowd which received the besotted-yet-bemused heckle: \u201cWhat part of \u2018black\u2019 you from?\u201d Meanwhile, back in her home town and namesake, she is continuing her regular gig on ITV2\u2019s panel show, Don\u2019t Hate the Playaz, starting her new Spotify dating podcast, London Actually, and kicking up a Top Boy-related Twitterstorm about black representation (\u201cBlack British culture is not is not just one way, there\u2019s more to us than grime and gangs and knife crime,\u201d she tweeted).\n\nThe offers are pouring in so fast \u2013 gigs, book deals, merchandising \u2013 that all she can do is laugh: \u201cGod, you should see my agent\u2019s emails; it\u2019s, like, ridiculous! She\u2019ll screenshot me the emails and we\u2019ll just go: \u2018Wow!\u2019 Because those people were not returning her emails at the beginning of this year, I\u2019ll tell you that!\u201d\n\nSadly for us in the UK, this is all too little, too late. By the time you read this, 30-year-old Hughes will be in Los Angeles working with Issa Rae\u2019s Insecure co-creator, Larry Wilmore, on the pilot for a sitcom based on her own life. She cannot say much yet, but what she does say is: \u201cI wanna bring black British culture to America; the positive side to black British culture, none of this Top Boy stuff.\u201d\n\nIt has only been three years since Hughes first crossed the Atlantic, but things have moved fast. \u201cI feel like something shifted over there and black women\u2019s stories are wanted now. People like Issa Rae and Tiffany Haddish opened the doors for me, so I can easily walk through.\u201d Over here, however, she has felt stigmatised by her association with kids\u2019 TV (she was a CBBC presenter from 2009 to 2011) and overlooked in favour of her pale, male peers. \u201cI\u2019m definitely riding the wave in America. Here, there\u2019s no wave. Like the fact that Michaela Coel had a whole two seasons of Chewing Gum and then it ended and none of you thought: maybe we should replace this? But everyone\u2019s looking for the next Fleabag! OK. There\u2019s no wave.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: James Drew Turner/The Guardian\n\nWhile it sounds as though Hughes\u2019s heart has irrevocably hardened as far as the British comedy establishment is concerned, she was sincerely moved by her Edinburgh nomination. \u201cI literally fell to the floor. It just meant validation. It was like: \u2018You\u2019re not crazy.\u2019 The whole of my career I\u2019ve been told: \u2018No, not right for us\u2019; \u2018Oh no, we like London, but we don\u2019t think she\u2019s right\u2019; \u2018Oh she\u2019s not right \u2026 \u2019 Never, never, never, never been accepted. Not in this industry, not in this lifetime. And, for the first time, I finally felt accepted \u2026 It will for ever be the best day of my life.\u201d\n\nSo, although the award eventually went to another comedian, Jordan Brookes, for Hughes it was mission accomplished: \u201cMy whole thing about Edinburgh was, basically \u2013 it sounds so big-headed, but it\u2019s the truth \u2013 I was like, make them realise they messed up. Go to Edinburgh one more time, kill it and then leave. To let them know, you can\u2019t keep doing this to your black talent. You just can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nShe has no regrets about moving on from British comedy. She knows it is not her fault (\u201cIt\u2019s literally, systemically, their problem\u201d), yet the rejection still stings. \u201cBecause it\u2019s my home! It\u2019s my people,\u201d she says, sounding genuinely pained. \u201cI wanted to make it here first, but I just knew \u2013 I just knew \u2013 as a black woman, I wouldn\u2019t. There are no black female household names in this country, bar Naomi Campbell.\u201d\n\nSuccess has been a long time coming for London Hughes, especially when you consider how early she started. Her name was bestowed before birth. She was a \u201cmiracle baby\u201d \u2013 her parents were not sure she would survive long outside the womb \u2013 so they went all out and gave her six middle names, with London being the least unusual option. \u201cMy mum wanted to call me Nashwan which was the name of the horse that won the Derby that day and Sonar, after the sonar treatment they used to save my life. So \u2026 \u201d Otherwise, she had what she calls \u201ca normal black British girl experience\u201d growing up in Thornton Heath, south London, the same area as Stormzy. \u201cMy parents worked really hard and my story is not different from anybody else\u2019s. I\u2019m not from a gang, I\u2019m not from a council estate, but I\u2019m not wealthy.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Karla Gowlett\n\nShe gets her stage presence and glamorous style from her mother. \u201cI\u2019m, like, Jamaican culture: we show out,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I was going to church my mum would make sure I looked legit for God. So now I\u2019m a comedian on stage, do you think I\u2019m gonna do it in jeans and a top? Never!\u201d Her humour, she reckons, comes more from her dad, who grew up in Sussex, the black son of white adoptive parents. \u201cMy grandma, God rest her soul, was a very woke woman \u2013 like, she got me black Barbie dolls, and was very cultured, for someone who had no black friends and whose own mother had a cat called \u2018Nigger\u2019 \u2026 So my dad is a very proud black man, but he grew up on Radio 4 shows and I used to listen to them, too. No black girl from south London, at six years old, should be able to quote Round the Horn and The Goon Show, but I could. So for real, like, you cannot put me in a box!\u201d\n\nThat box, and Hughes\u2019s refusal to get in it, also helps explain the twists and turns of her showbiz journey. \u201cSometimes, I feel like I\u2019m not black enough for TV, because I\u2019m not urban \u2026 If I had The London Hughes Show, there\u2019d be no graffiti backgrounds, there\u2019d be no \u2018Nursery Grimes\u2019,\u201d she says, presumably in reference to Channel 4\u2019s The Lateish Show With Mo Gilligan. \u201cIt would just be a show hosted by a woman who happens to be black. I would probably reference my blackness, but it wouldn\u2019t be in a way of: \u201cOh yeah, let me just basically play a racial stereotype.\u201d Like, cool, have shows like that, but then also, have other shows. If you didn\u2019t have any black friends, you lived in Brexit Britain and you looked on TV, you\u2019d think we are all grime rappers.\u201d\n\nIndeed, there is only one point in our interview when the supremely confident Hughes looks uncomfortable, and that\u2019s when she opens up about her own teenage rap alter-ego, Lady Diamond. Why so cringy? \u201cMy mum had just moved us to Brighton and that\u2019s when I felt like I needed to hold on to my blackness the most, because I was surrounded by white people, so, I became a rapper. I had these song lyrics like, \u2018Brap, brap, brap, come to your house \u2026 \u2018 Like, what am I \u2018brapping\u2019? There\u2019s nothing to \u2018brap\u2019! I will not come to your house, I don\u2019t own a gun, I\u2019ve never even seen a gun! So that was annoying because I was holding on to something that wasn\u2019t me.\u201d\n\nNo one who has caught Hughes on Don\u2019t Hate the Playaz will be surprised to learn that she still finds inspiration in hip-hop and feels a particular sense of kinship with Lizzo: \u201cShe\u2019s been going for 10 years; I\u2019ve been going for 10 years. Two years ago she released Truth Hurts; two years ago I was in Edinburgh doing my comedy and nobody cared. Two years later, Truth Hurts goes to No 1; two years later, I get nominated for a comedy award. And we\u2019re both 30. Everything about her is me.\u201d It was also during the Lady Diamond years that Hughes had her first kiss \u2013 with the Godfather of Grime, Wiley, no less (\u201cGreat kisser! I don\u2019t think he even knows who I am\u201d), and threw an 18th birthday party attended by future Channel 4 talkshow host Big Narstie (\u201cSo, basically I joined MySpace because I wanted rappers to date me \u2026 And it worked!\u201d).\n\nBecause she\u2019s London Hughes, her Wiley name-drop is quickly followed by a lively anecdote about the time Prince Charles told her she was too pretty to be a comic. \u201cPrince Charles walked in the room, just oozing sex appeal, with all the badges on. I\u2019m like, \u2018Yaaaasss, Prince! Yaaaaasss!\u2019 I\u2019m the only black girl in the whole room, he makes a beeline for me, cos we know Prince Charles likes black girls ... \u201d Wiley and Prince Charles? It\u2019s a juxtaposition that amuses Hughes, too: \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m saying! Get you a chick that can do both. Round the Horn and twerking!\u201d Yet even as Hughes was mixing in such exulted MySpace circles, and building the bulletproof ego that still powers her performances, she was being bullied; first at school and then by female \u201cfriends\u201d at university. \u201cI thought I was the problem and they kept telling me I was the problem. So growing up I felt I had to be like: \u2018Please like me!\u2019\u201d\n\nNow, she is keen to build more mutually supportive relationships with other women. \u201cLike, I am amazing, but also my amazingness does not take away from yours. That\u2019s what women need to learn,\u201d she says. \u201cEspecially in this industry \u2026 I just wish that there was more of a sisterhood when it comes to females in general, and way more of a sisterhood when it comes to black females \u2026 That\u2019s why I always big-up Thanyia Moore or Lolly Adefope: I haven\u2019t been in a room with Lolly Adefope for years, but I will always talk about her and how proud I am of her. Or Michaela Coel. I don\u2019t chat to Michaela Coel, but I will celebrate her.\u201d\n\nHughes rarely lets her inner people-pleaser get a word in these days, but she does acknowledge the crucial part it played in her development as a comic. One of the thrills of seeing her live is the sense that she never weighs her words or regrets something she has said, however scandalous. And it\u2019s no stage illusion: \u201cNow, I\u2019m this age, I\u2019m like, I\u2019m a queen! Do I like me? Yes, I do, and that\u2019s where the \u2018no-filter\u2019 thing came from. I\u2019m not a nasty person, but I\u2019m free with my mouth and I say what I want and if you don\u2019t like that, fine.\u201d\n\nAnd if you do like that? Better get in there quick. That\u2019s the sound of London Hughes not calling us back: \u201cI want my own sitcom. If you can\u2019t give me that, then don\u2019t ring my phone. I\u2019m in America.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t Hate the Playaz is on Wednesdays, 10pm, ITV2", "description": "From Lizzo to Prince Charles to race and the British standup circuit, the rising comic lets rip", "authors": ["Ellen E Jones"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a93f6fff1dfe6d7540e99bcb80bfe7bf6ac03f79/0_295_1502_901/master/1502.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=364ee65b3737a6bba46f4fbcc4c3c169", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
