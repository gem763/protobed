And you have a Democrat named Dan McCready and he wants open borders,\u201d Trump told his audience. \u201cHe wants sanctuary cities and he\u2019s not going to protect your Second Amendment.\u201d\n\nMcCready, a former Marine and Iraq War veteran, is running for the seat for a second time in a special election on Tuesday, after narrowly losing to Republican Mark Harris in 2016, in an election so tainted by misconduct that Harris\u2019s victory was declared invalid, and he has been replaced as the GOP nominee by Dan Bishop. McCready does support a pathway to citizenship for so-called Dreamers, the children of undocumented immigrants brought to the country by their parents. He does not support open borders, but opposes a bill in the state legislature that would compel North Carolina sheriffs to comply with orders to ICE agents to detain immigrants.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest issues in this election is, in fact, sanctuary cities. McCready supports sanctuary city policies that force prisons and jails to release criminal aliens directly into your neighborhoods,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump\u2019s message in North Carolina was reminiscent of the case he made during the 2018 midterm elections, when Democrats trounced Republicans to retake control of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nBishop joined Trump onstage Monday and echoed the president\u2019s rhetoric, decrying \u201cthe socialist Democrat Party\u201d that he said \u201cseeks the president\u2019s destruction every day.\u201d\n\nTrump, Bishop said, is \u201cthe greatest fighter ever to occupy the White House,\u201d battling attacks from Democrats and the media at every turn.\n\nBishop\u2019s turn at the microphone was interrupted for several minutes when an audience member near the podium was overcome by the heat.\n\n\u201cI guess Dan\u2019s speech wasn\u2019t so good,\u201d Trump joked, his face glistening with perspiration.\n\nTrump also appealed to religious conservatives in the state, complimenting Franklin Graham for his charity\u2019s efforts to aid the Bahamas in the wake of Hurricane Dorian. \u201cOur evangelicals are here tonight,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done for religion is so very important.\u201d\n\nBut the bulk of the president\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d message drew a contrast between the two parties in terms of national identity.\n\n\u201cYou finally have a president who understands that I\u2019m not supposed to be the president of the world, I\u2019m supposed to be the president of the United States of America,\u201d Trump said.\n\nTrump assured the crowd that the \u201cwall [on the border with Mexico] is being built.\u201d He charged Democrats with seeking to give \u201cfree health care to illegal immigrants\u201d and wanting \u201cto bring in unlimited numbers of migrant refugees,\u201d Trump added.\n\nWhether McCready or Bishop wins a district Trump won by 12 points in 2016 will be an early indication of the president\u2019s strength in a once reliably Republican state where Democrats are becoming more competitive.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "The president portrayed a Democrat in Tuesday's special election in North Carolina as too lenient on illegal immigration.", "authors": ["David Knowles"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/tKHMdcpunlBKXRpL0Qd59g--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/e4bf0350-d362-11e9-af8b-d376e438975b", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
