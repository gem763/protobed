September top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 3/11 9. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 4/11 8. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Gennady Golovkin (38-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. Getty Images 6/11 6. Errol Spence (25-0-0) After his impressive win over Garcia in which he didn't drop a round, Spence added another big name to his record. Shawn Porter will be next, to unify the belts and perhaps further close the gap between himself and rival Terence Crawford in the P4P standings. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (16-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion moves up in weight, but injury has delayed his debut against Carlos Takam. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

Getty Images\n\n\"I got caught on the eye and that changed the fight. For the majority I could not see out of the eye. Then there was a clash of heads and I got cut again.\n\n\"I haven't seen the cut, it feels quite bad, but I'm the Gypsy Warrior. It's all heart and determination. If I can keep going, I will keep going.\n\n\"He's a tough guy. I hit him with some chin shots and some body shots and he kept coming. He's 6ft 6ins and undefeated but tonight I was the man.\"\n\nThe fight was a stop-gap before an expected rematch against Deontay Wilder after the pair's controversial draw last December.\n\nAnd although it did not go to plan Fury is confident there will be plenty of time for him to recover for an anticipated February meeting.\n\n\"Deontay Wilder, I want you next, bum. That's my fourth fight, it has put me in good stead for the big dosser, February 22nd,\" he added.\n\nAsked about his immediate plans he said: \"Let the cut heal, have some time to relax with the family.\"\n\nThere was real concern for a time the cut could have caused the fight to be stopped and then Fury would have lost as referee Tony Week - who called in the doctor towards the end of the sixth round - had ruled it was not caused by a clash of heads.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

As you all know he has shown plenty of times before he has a ton of heart and he had to show plenty of that tonight,\" said Fury's trainer Ben Davison.\n\n\"We all know Tyson has the boxing ability and skill set but sometimes you have to be able to fight as well and Tyson was able to show he could do that.\"\n\nWallin admits he targeted the problem area but could not find the decisive blow.\n\n\"With the cut it was a good punch which opened it and I tried to stay on it and I wish I could have capitalised more on it,\" said the Swede, who lost his father to a heart attack in May.\n\n\"It was bothering him because the blood was coming down and he was shaking his head to try to get it off.\"\n\nWith the eye causing him a problem Fury had no idea how long he would be allowed to continue so he tried to step up the attack and landed two big right-handers in the seventh round, one which rocked Wallin back onto the ropes, and a few more punches found their target in the eighth and ninth.\n\nAlthough the Swede looked to be tiring he managed to grind it out to the final round where, sensing his one final opportunity, landed a big left early and Fury was more than happy to cling onto his opponent in an attempt to avoid further trouble.\n\nBut despite Wallin thinking he had done enough there was only winner as Fury claimed a unanimous points victory, 116-112, 117-111, 118-110.\n\nEarlier in the evening Morecambe's Isaac Lowe successfully defended his WBC international featherweight title, extending his unbeaten record, after a hard-fought points win over Ruben Garcia Hernandez.", "description": "Tyson Fury had planned to celebrate his victory over Otto Wallin with a night out on the famous Las Vegas Strip but instead spent it in hospital after coming through a bloody 12-round battle.
