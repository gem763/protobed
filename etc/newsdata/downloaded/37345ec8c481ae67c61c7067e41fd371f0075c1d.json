The most eye-catching of these proposals \u2014 which received overwhelming support from party members Sunday \u2014 would effectively ban private schools.\n\nThe proposal is just one of several designed to drag British politics away from Brexit and back to a debate about public services and domestic policy.\n\nShadow Chancellor John McDonnell will continue the rollout of domestic reform pledges Monday by announcing a plan to establish a National Care Service to mirror the U.K.'s National Health Service, providing free care to all elderly people who require it at home, at an estimated cost of \u00a36 billion, funded through taxation.\n\nBoth policies are likely to galvanize the party's base ahead of the expected election.\n\nBut these radical new ideas were not enough to firmly shift debate \u2014 as Jeremy Corbyn hoped \u2014 and distract from the fact that the Labour leader faces opposition to his Brexit stance from several of his own shadow Cabinet.\n\nLeading figures including Deputy Leader Tom Watson \u2014 who on Friday survived an internal bid to abolish his position \u2014 and Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry are both pushing for the party to make clear at the conference that it backs remaining in the EU. Other senior figures including McDonnell and Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer also want the party to commit to backing Remain in any potential second referendum.\n\nCorbyn, having only shifted to supporting a second referendum earlier this year, has not committed to backing Remain should such a vote be held and wants the party, if it entered government, to first renegotiate a Brexit deal with the EU before calling a second referendum.\n\nLabour's governing body, the National Executive Committee, supported this policy on Sunday, but party officials, unions and shadow cabinet ministers are expected to work late into Sunday night to decide on the exact wording of the Brexit motion that will be put to party members for a vote on Monday.\n\nSunday evening's \"compositing\" meeting will also see a debate on Labour's climate change policy, with activists pushing for it to back a target of zero carbon emissions by 2030, while the GMB union, which has many members in the energy and manufacturing sectors, reject this goal over fears about the impact on jobs.\n\nNew policy announcements from the Labour leadership on climate change are expected to follow later this week, following on from Sunday's private schools plan and Monday's care reform pledge. Long a live-wire topic in British politics, the private school motion says that these schools' \"endowments, investments and properties\" should be \"redistributed democratically and fairly across the country's educational institutions\" and that the government should remove such schools\u2019 charitable status.\n\nJust 7 percent of children in the U.K. attend fee-paying schools, but hugely disproportionate numbers of the U.K.'s economic, cultural and political elite \u2014 including two-thirds of Boris Johnson's Cabinet \u2014 were educated in the private system.\n\nAll eyes on Brexit\n\nDespite the potency of such issues, Brexit still dominated discussion in Brighton.\n\nPolls suggest Labour is losing support from its pro-Remain voters \u2014 roughly two thirds of its backers in the last election in 2017 \u2014 to the unequivocally pro-Remain Liberal Democrat party, which now says it would revoke Article 50, the mechanism which formerly began the process of withdrawal from the bloc, without a referendum if it won an election. But on the other flank, Labour is losing the support of some its pro-Brexit voters to the Conservatives under Prime Minister Johnson, who has pledged to leave the EU with or without a deal by the current deadline of October 31, as well as to Nigel Farage's Brexit Party, which advocates for a no-deal exit.\n\nSpeaking at an event on the sidelines of the conference on Sunday, Thornberry warned the party risked being caught in the \"crusher\" because of its middle-road stance on Brexit.\n\n\u201cMy concern is that unless we do put forward a full program [on Brexit], I\u2019m concerned that we will end up with Boris Johnson being back as prime minister for another five years,\" she said, according to the Scotsman newspaper.\n\nWatson, speaking at a separate campaign event, said he would remain in his post and fight for the party to back a policy of keeping the country in the EU. \"I am going to remain campaigning for Remain,\" he said.\n\nHilary Benn, the Labour chair of the House of Commons\u2019 Brexit committee, also urged his party to be bolder, saying it had a \"duty of care\" to its overwhelmingly pro-Remain activists and members, by telling them now whether the party would back Remain in a second referendum.\n\nSpeaking earlier on Sunday, Corbyn outlined a plan for Labour, if elected, to negotiate a new Brexit deal with the EU, then to hold a \"special conference\" to decide whether to back its own deal or remaining in the EU in a second referendum.\n\n\"I recognize the majority of Labour Party supporters and members support Remain and supported Remain, but a significant minority voted the other way,\" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr program, but committed to abiding by the decision of party members.", "description": "New domestic proposals overshadowed by internal conflict within British opposition party.", "authors": ["Charlie Cooper", "Annabelle Dickson"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1176331444-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
