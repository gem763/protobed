And the rate at which banks lend to each other - the Fed's benchmark - exceeded 2.25%, the top of its desired range.\n\nThe rise prompted the Fed to take action. Four times this week, it injected money into the market, offering to buy up to $75bn in treasuries or other assets from banks in a bid to boost bank reserves and keep them lending.\n\nWhy did the rates suddenly spike?\n\nStrains in the repo market were among the first signals of trouble ahead of the 2008 financial crisis. Back then banks had suddenly become wary of lending, worried there were unforeseen risks associated with assets that had previously been considered safe.\n\nThis time, analysts think what's happening is caused by an issue with money supply.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption The Federal Reserve has intervened to ensure enough cash is available\n\nMoney has been sucked out of the market by two events that happen to have coincided. The first is a tax deadline which means firms need cash to pay what they owe the taxman. The second is the due date for payments on a recent offering of government bonds.\n\nOn top of that the Fed has also been steadily reducing the overall supply of money in the market, aiming to get conditions closer to how they were before the financial crisis.\n\nIs that the mystery solved then?\n\nA lot of people still don't think those explanations are enough to explain the scale of the interest rate rise.\n\n\"The thing that's really confounding is just how much rates moved in a short time,\" says Zachary Griffiths, rate strategist at Wells Fargo.\n\n\"Everyone's kind of trying to get a firmer grasp... on all the different nuances that could have led to such a big move.\"\n\nThere could be other one-off factors triggering this spike, such as an oil bet that went bad after the attack on Saudi Arabia, says Priya Misra, head of global rates strategy at TD Securities.\n\nBut she notes that the repo market also showed signs of stress in April and December, suggesting an underling structural issue - namely that the Fed has gone too far in reducing reserves.\n\n\"We are in uncharted waters,\" she says. \"The Fed is trying to figure out the appropriate level of excess reserves.\"\n\nShould we be worried?\n\nOn Wednesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell conceded that the Fed had not anticipated such a large spike in interest rates, despite warnings of a possible crunch.\n\nMr Powell was also quick to talk down concerns that the issue signals a bigger problem or that the bank had lost its grip on its policy.\n\n\"We don't see this as having any implications for the broader economy, or for the economic outlook, nor for our ability to control rates,\" he said.\n\nAnd the Fed used to conduct these kinds of market operations prior to the financial crisis, without prompting undue concern.\n\nDid the Fed's intervention work?\n\nRates dropped back following the Fed's action, and so far stock markets and other parts of the system don't appear to have been affected.\n\nBut analysts warn that the turmoil is likely continue, saying the end-of-quarter rush to square up company balance sheets could cause more stress.\n\n\"Our big takeaway there is, we're going to have to keep an eye on this,\" says Mr Griffiths.", "description": "The US central bank has pumped more than $200bn into the financial markets this week.
