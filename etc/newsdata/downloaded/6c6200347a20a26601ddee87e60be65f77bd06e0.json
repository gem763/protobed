The 2012-13 NBA season started with Bryant, Howard, and Steve Nash on the cover of Sports Illustrated with the title \u201cNow THIS is going to be fun\u201d. It was not.\n\nHoward is back with the Lakers, a team that desperately needs frontcourt depth. Whether the 33-year-old Howard will be able to supply that is still a question, despite his reasonably productive per 100 possession statistics from last season.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIn 20 minutes per game for the Los Angeles this year, Howard has produced reasonably well for a Lakers squad that wants nothing more than to be a power in the west. Meanwhile, his old teammate Bryant says that Howard will be a big time factor for L.A.\n\nVia LA Times:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy for him because sometimes we don\u2019t realize how much we love the game and miss the game until that window starts closing or its closed,\u201d Bryant said. \u201cThen you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh damn, I really miss playing the game. I want another opportunity to show what I can do.\u2019 Sometimes you don\u2019t know if that opportunity will ever come again. For him, I really believe he\u2019s appreciative of the opportunity and I think he\u2019s going to make a hell of an impact because of the new appreciation he has for playing the game.\u201d\n\nWhether Howard can make an impact has never really been a question. Over the course of his career, health has been the biggest thing holding Howard back. That, and of course the years in which he complained about his post touches despite leading the NBA in that particular statistic.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere\u2019s no qualms for Howard on that front any longer. He\u2019s a bench player, and non-premiere rotation guys can\u2019t exactly dictate things like post touches. He\u2019s there to contribute in any way that LeBron James deems necessary. Of course, Howard had a serious issue with his lower back/sciatic area last season and the worry that over an 82 game drudge he\u2019ll eventually wear down.\n\nIt\u2019s fine that Kobe thinks Howard can contribute. On paper, that\u2019s probably accurate. But over time, the real issue will be whether Howard can actually translate those efficiency numbers by staying on the court.", "description": "The real issue will be whether Howard can actually translate his efficiency numbers by staying on the court.", "authors": ["Dane Delgado"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wJlDAwMeTYJGwtZ0klsatw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjIuMTMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WrmMQQ9dMiWC7NoHkZ2I3Q--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkxNDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/45d5952930d2138d0c597d25c58c6a35", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
