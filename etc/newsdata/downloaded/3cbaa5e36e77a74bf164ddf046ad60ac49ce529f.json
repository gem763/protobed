There is no running water, electricity, bathroom facilities or any certainty of food. A few days ago someone delivered biscuits, but there has been nothing since.\n\nOn the top floor refugees rest in their tents or under mosquitos nets, their few possession in plastic bags strung up on the wall.\n\nOutside children play in the dirt while the men slowly congregate on the shaded steps to pass the time.\n\n\u201cI have finished everything. I have no money, no family,\u201d says 43-year-old refugee Jan Ali, throwing his hands up in the air, \u201cHow can I continue my life in any other place?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have basic facilities, water, anything. It\u2019s impossible to do anything,\u201d says Ali. \u201cThree days ago someone came and gave us food, for today, we don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hazara children playing football in the hallway of the former military building in Kalideres.

Unable to legally work, they are told by the UNHCR, the UN\u2019s refugee agency, that there is no money to support them. Resettlement could be decades away, if it happens at all.\n\nThe situation has been compounded by an Australian government decision last year to cut funding to the International Organisation for Migration for any new refugee arrivals.\n\nThe factors have painfully coalesced on the ground in Kalideres where, after years of waiting to be resettled, hundreds of refugees say their money has run out.\n\nThe Guardian visited Kalideres last April, where hundreds of refugees were camped on the road outside an immigration detention facility, in the hope of being allowed inside.\n\nSome have continued to live on the street since, this July moving en masse to camp outside the UNHCR building in protest, before finally being moved to a military building, where the government provided supplies. But after more than a month, Jakarta\u2019s governor announced it was time to go.\n\nOn the streets with the desperate refugees who dream of being detained Read more\n\n\u201cThat electricity was cut on August 31, that is when we were supposed to go,\u201d explains Hassan Ramazan, a Hazara man from Afghanistan. \u201cBut the people here remain decided. They will stay until they are forced to go.\u201d For the hundreds of mostly ethnic Hazaras here there is nowhere else to go.\n\nThe inhabitants are now entirely reliant on charity. Indonesia is not a signatory to the UN convention of refugees so by international law is not obliged to look after refugees. In December 2016, Jakarta\u2019s governor signed a presidential regulation on the treatment of asylum seekers and refugees that allows local governments to draw from their budgets to offer some support for refugees.\n\nZahra Muhammad Ali, 38, an Afghan mother of six daughters, who travelled to Indonesia after she lost her husband, says the nearby mosque has been giving her food.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Hassan Ramazan, 41, who has been living in the military building in Kalideres for more than two months.

After escaping conflict at home, young Hazara men now spend hours playing war games on their mobile phones. Others try and sleep the day away.\n\n\u201cA lot of people here are suffering from mental problems,\u201d says Mohammad Sadiq, 25, who came to Indonesia six years ago. \u201cPeople are more sensitive, and they fight.\u201d\n\nAround Indonesia, several refugees have taken their own lives in recent years. \u201cWhen I came here I saw some of my friends from Afghanistan and Pakistan, they were not the same. They forget their words. You sit with them for an hour and you see that they are not normal. They are angry and depressed,\u201d says Ramazan during a tour of the camp.\n\nWithin Indonesia\u2019s refugee community there are bright sparks, skilled refugee leaders involved in a host of initiatives, holding classes for photography, art, music and even karate. With a bit of support some have flourished, while others have fallen between the cracks.\n\nWith little hope and few choices, human rights lawyer Trish Cameron says something has to give.\n\n\u201cPeople in refugee communities in Indonesia have no legal way to support themselves,\u201d says Cameron, \u201cOptions to overcome the cycle of despair and vulnerability is either to allow work rights so refugees can support themselves, or commit to the provision of long-term ongoing support from governments, or non-government agencies.\u201d\n\nBut on the ground in Kalideres there is no sense that any of that might happen soon.\n\nWhen they were camped outside the UNHCR office, the refugees were offered a one-off payment, of 1m to 1.6m rupiah (\u00a357 to \u00a390) but hundreds refused, arguing they needed a long-term solution.\n\n\u201cThe last time an officer from UNHCR came here last week, they said our message is not changed, we cannot feed you, provide a place, any shelter for you,\u201d says Ramazan. \u201cAnd I said, our message, our mission and goal is unchanged, too. Do something for us otherwise close your office, resign and go home.\u201d", "description": "Australia\u2019s funding cuts force hundreds of homeless refugees to plead to be taken into immigration detention", "authors": ["Kate Lamb"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e0912bb7e4a4f90e4661ab7b5ed72782edcee39c/0_587_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=88cceea85beda351923697eee97a0793", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
