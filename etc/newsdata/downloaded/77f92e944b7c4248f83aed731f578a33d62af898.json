There are logical reasons for this: Sabonis is good (he was second in Sixth Man of the Year voting last season), yet he and the Pacers are nowhere near agreement on a contract extension, and the Pacers already paid big money for Myles Turner to be their center, how much do they want to pay Sabonis, too?\n\nThat\u2019s sound logic if you\u2019re in the Pacers\u2019 front office.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nIf you\u2019re Sabonis, it can feel like a slap in the face to a guy who put in a lot of sweat and passion for the franchise. That\u2019s what Sabonis sounded like in this quote, via Scott Agnes of The Athletic.\n\nDomas on potentially being dealt: \"There\u2019s not really much to talk about. I know exactly how the Pacers feel about me now, they know how I feel about that, and there\u2019s not much more to say. Let my agents do the rest of it and we\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d He has spoken to his dad. \u2014 Scott Agness (@ScottAgness) October 19, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Pacers are not talking about the report, which started with the well connected and reliable Sam Amick at The Athletic.\n\nMcMillan when asked about yesterday\u2019s reports about Sabonis possibly being on the trade block and where the team may be on an extension: \u201cI don\u2019t talk about contracts.\u201d Is that something you have to talk about with Domas? \u201cI don\u2019t talk about contracts.\u201d \u2014 Nathan Brown (@By_NathanBrown) October 19, 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nStory continues\n\nPacers\u2019 brass needs to talk about this with Sabonis (and likely already have, behind closed doors). If the Pacers trade him, it\u2019s likely not until after Dec. 15 at the earliest (when most players signed this summer can be included in a deal) and probably closer to the February trade deadline. That\u2019s a lot of season to play out, and Sabonis remains a vital part of the Indiana rotation.\n\nThere is likely to be a lot of interest in Sabonis on the market. However, because he\u2019s a center (a position teams are careful not to overspend on in today\u2019s market) and in the last year of his rookie deal \u2014 meaning he becomes a restricted free agent next summer and gets more expensive \u2014 teams are not going to overpay for him. Right now the Pacers are asking for too much and interested teams are lowballing their offers. The sides will meet in the middle.\n\nThat middle could shift if Sabonis has a rough start to the season. Both sides need him to play well and feel comfortable, whatever is going on with the business side of his contract.", "description": "The Indiana Pacers have started to explore the trade market for Domantas Sabonis.
