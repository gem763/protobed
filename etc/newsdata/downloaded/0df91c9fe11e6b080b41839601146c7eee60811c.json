They were also likely worn as jewellery.\n\n\u201cThe Venetian jewel merchant Gasparo Balbi, who travelled through the region, mentions the islands off the coast of Abu Dhabi as a source of pearls in the 16th century,\u201d the culture department said.\n\nThe pearl industry once underpinned the economy of the United Arab Emirates, but the trade collapsed in the 1930s with the advent of Japanese cultured pearls, and as conflicts rocked global economies.\n\nInstead, the Gulf nations turned to the oil industry which dominates their economies to this day.", "description": "Abu Dhabi (AFP) \u2013 An 8,000-year-old pearl that archaeologists say is the world\u2019s oldest will be displayed in Abu Dhabi, according to", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/20/6a4573_archeologists-say-000-year-old-pearl-dig-in-abu-dhabi-is-oldest-in-world-world-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
