Meanwhile, Bethany is distracting herself and asks James Bailey (Nathan Graham) about the politics of being a professional footballer, believing it will make for a good article.\n\nHowever, her writing takes a different course when she struggles with writing a short story for her course, prompting Brian Packham (Peter Gunn) to step in and help her. As Bethany shows the result to James, he is impressed but he soon realises that it is actually a story about her own experiences and it contains an admission that she is in love with Daniel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBethany swears James to secrecy \u2013 and Daniel and Sinead have much bigger problems to deal with as Sinead becomes more and more ill, telling Beth (Lisa George) that she is finding even everyday tasks almost impossible.\n\nKnowing that time is running out and that Sinead won\u2019t be alive to see Christmas, Kirk Sutherland (Andrew Whyment) gets the family together and they make plans to celebrate Christmas early so that she can join in the festivities.\n\nBut as Daniel continues to struggle with losing Sinead, will he end up seeking solace with Bethany \u2013 and will her story come back to haunt her and cast an even darker shadow over Sinead\u2019s already devastating situation?\n\nOne to watch: Friday 18th October at 8:30pm on ITV.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "She drops a huge bombshell in Corrie.", "authors": ["Duncan Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/19_08_coro_bethany_daniel_bistro_02-1656_1569845988.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
