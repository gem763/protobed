And, although top-down change seems unlikely, I now have a plan on how to bring this up with other senior managers, in a way that hopefully nudges a bottom-up change.\n\nAlso, I was amused by readers\u2019 assumptions about where I was writing from. I\u2019m actually working in a supposedly progressive city.\n\nFrom the reader with an overly huggy co-worker:\n\nWe had a serious conversation, and she received that quite well. Everything has been fine since. She seems able to contain the spontaneous hugging, and she\u2019s a wonderful addition to the team. While it wasn\u2019t really bothersome to any of us, my concern was that we weren\u2019t serving her well if we didn\u2019t say that in the professional world it\u2019s not okay and could damage her reputation as a highly competent professional.\n\nReaders of this column from the Sunday Magazine days may remember the 14-year-old seeking advice on how to get a job to help support the family, including two unemployed adult siblings and divorced parents living under the same roof. Here\u2019s an update, two years later:\n\nI\u2019m now a rising junior in high school. My siblings still haven\u2019t gotten jobs, but they have gotten pretty close. We\u2019re still struggling financially, but we\u2019re a lot more stable now ever since my siblings and I moved with my mother out of my father\u2019s house. I would apply for jobs as a 16-year-old, but my mom suggests that I enjoy my childhood while I can.\n\nI have a bit of great news. For over a year I\u2019ve been part of a team developing a modification in a video game. I\u2019m the texture artist. Although I don\u2019t get paid, it\u2019s certainly a great learning experience. Writing and drawing are really fun for me, and I want my future to be about them.\n\nI got into this when I was browsing the online community forums of one of my favorite games and volunteered to help a developer who needed design help for a game modification. I met other community members and became friends with other artists on the project.\n\nEventually we left because the developer was making sexist and racist jokes and treating the female artists worse than the males. Now I am working with other community members on our own game modification, and we hope to earn royalties for it.\n\nWhen someone you\u2019re working for disrespects you, then they\u2019re not worth it. Start your own project or look for someone who will show you the respect you need.\n\nKarla: So you have a side gig doing what you love, and you already have a good sense of what you will and won\u2019t accept from an employer. All I can add is, don\u2019t be shy about asking to be paid for your next gig \u2014 your time and skills are valuable. But you seem to have things well in hand.
