Apple could also launch a new Apple Watch model this fall, according to Bloomberg.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook has also spoken about the importance of managing the amount of time we spend on our smartphones in the past. \"I think they ought to put their phone down and look at who they're talking to or having dinner with,\" Cook said when ABC's Diane Sawyer asked him what he thinks when he sees people in a restaurant staring at their phones. \"But I totally recognize that it is their decision.\"", "description": "Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak says he doesn't use his phone much anymore because of the Apple Watch.", "authors": ["Lisa Eadicicco"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d6957572e22af42512951e8-750-375.jpg"}
