(Photo: Reviewed)\n\n\u2014 Our editors review and recommend products to help you buy the stuff you need. If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today\u2019s newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nIt's Tuesday\u2014but if you were lucky enough to have the day off yesterday, then it feels more like a Monday. To get back into the swing of things, I suggest some online shopping to take the edge of the workweek off. It's even better when you can find products you actually on sale.\n\nToday, for example, you can get Fire TV Sticks, Vitamix blenders, Apple Watches for great prices on Amazon. Not only, are these products highly reviewed by us, but we also price tracked them, so you can assure you're getting your money's worth.\n\n1. $15 off: A 4K streaming stick\n\nReviewers love this streaming device. (Photo: Amazon)\n\nThe Fire Stick 4K is the replacement to the original Fire TV, which is one of our favorite media streaming devices. It has 4K, Dolby, and HDR, and it comes with an all-new Alexa voice remote that controls a number of different features. You can also stream all your favorite shows, movies, and other content just like you can with the Fire TV. Right now, you can get it for $15 off, which is a great price for streaming all favorite fall TV shows.\n\nGet the Fire TV Stick 4K for $34.99 (Save $15)\n\n2. $130 off: An affordable professional blender\n\nBlend your way through smoothies and more with this top blender. (Photo: Vitamix)\n\nSmoothies are delicious even in the cold weather, but if you want a blender that can also make nut butters, soups, and sauces, then we recommend going with a coveted Vitamix. After testing the best professional blenders out there, we found the Refurbished Vitamix 5300 to be the best affordable one. We love this model because of its powerful motor and lower height that fits underneath cabinets. We wouldn't pay full price for a brand new one and the refurbished models work just as well. Right now, you can get one for the lowest price we've ever seen.\n\nGet the Vitamix 5300 Certified Refurbished for $249.95 (Save $129.04)\n\n3.

Right now, you can get one at a great price\u2014just in time for winter. The YnM Weighted Blanket is our favorite affordable weighted blanket because although it's not the soft weighted blanket, it performs well for its price. You can clip a coupon code for $15 or $25 off right now, depending on the size. That means you can order a soft duvet cover for it with that extra cash you're saving.\n\nGet the YnM Weighted Blanket (Twin, 12lb) for $49.90 (Save $15)\n\n4. Under $10: This strainer that's better than a colander\n\nThis is possibly the most innovative strainer. (Photo: Kitchen Gizmo)\n\nPasta might be the easiest thing to cook, but actually straining it is the annoying part. But this genius strainer cuts out the middleman by simply snapping to the side of a pot and draining water without losing any precious noodles. While we haven't tested this product ourselves, but with more than 2,200 reviews and a 4.5 average rating on Amazon, it's a cult favorite kitchen product. Right now, you can get it for under $10 and one of its lowest prices.\n\nGet the Kitchen Gizmo Snap 'N Strain Strainer for $9.99 (Save $3)\n\n5. Lowest price ever: The Apple Watch Series 4\n\nCoinciding with the release of the Series 5, the Series 4 Apple watch lowered to an insane low price. (Photo: Reviewed / Betsy Goldwasser)\n\nAfter the release of the Apple Watch Series 5, Apple decided to give a massive discount to their Series 4 watches\u2014a.k.a their lowest price ever on Amazon. If you're in the market to upgrade your Series 3, or perhaps simply want to join the legions of Apple Watch owners, this is the time to do so. The Apple Watch Series 4 is also the best smart watch that we've ever tested, so you'd be missing out not to score it at this low price.\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
