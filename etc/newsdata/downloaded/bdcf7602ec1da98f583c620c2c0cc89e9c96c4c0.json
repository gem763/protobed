Air pollution at that level can seriously affect those with existing respiratory illnesses, and even those who are healthy.\n\nThe levels have remained above 300 since early Monday morning, or \u201cvery poor\u201d, which can cause respiratory illness after prolonged exposure.\n\nResidents woke up to a pall of grey left behind by acrid smoke from fireworks that remained trapped in the city\u2019s cool air.\n\nThe overall air quality index across the city, however, was at its lowest in three years due to favorable wind speeds and some reduction in the use of fireworks during Diwali, according to SAFAR, a government-run monitor.\n\nPM 2.5, or tiny particulate matter that is less than 2.5 microns in diameter, are considered particularly dangerous because they lodge deep in the lungs. PM 10 is another pollutant that is inhaled when people breathe through their mouths.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nThe Supreme Court had ordered residents to only use safe and environmentally friendly fireworks for a maximum of two hours, and only in designated areas such as parks, but the law was violated in several parts of the city, residents said.\n\n\u201cDelhi does it again!! Now let\u2019s all inhale the poisonous gases and tell each other how wonderful our Diwali was,\u201d said Twitter user Divya Sharma.\n\nDelhi will restrict the use of private vehicles on the capital\u2019s roads under an \u201codd-even\u201d scheme based on vehicle number plates from next week.", "description": "Air pollution in some parts of the Indian capital deteriorated early on Monday to the worst recorded level, officials said, a day after revelers set off fireworks to mark Diwali in celebrations that were more subdued than in previous years.", "authors": ["Neha Dasgupta", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445758620&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R0E6", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
