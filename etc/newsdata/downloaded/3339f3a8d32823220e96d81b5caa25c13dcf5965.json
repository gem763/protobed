Joaquin Phoenix's 'Joker' has definite Batman leanings, and that's a bad thing", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Joaquin Phoenix plays Arthur Fleck, a clown-for-hire and stand-up comic in 'Joker.' WARNER BROS. PICTURES\n\nSpoiler alert! Key plot points and the ending of the new movie \"Joker\" are revealed here, so beware if you haven't seen it yet.\n\nTodd Phillips\u2019 dark character study \u201cJoker\u201d promised to be something truly different for a comic book movie, focusing on the sort of villainous origin story that audiences had never seen before. Until it turns into a quasi-Batman tale and the Joaquin Phoenix showcase heads down a bleak alley we\u2019ve visited so many times before.\n\n\u201cJoker\u201d turns the clock back on Batman\u2019s archnemesis to track the path that would lead a troubled man \u2013 in this case, cackling Gotham City outcast Arthur Fleck \u2013 to becoming a face-painted psycho. And it does all that and more, showing Arthur/Joker as the symbol of fed-up Gothamites ready to revolt.\n\nSpoilers! The 5 most shocking 'Joker' moments that everyone will be talking about\n\nRanked: Every big-screen Joker (including Joaquin Phoenix)\n\nArthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) goes down a bad path that involves garish face paint and green hair in \"Joker.\" (Photo: NIKO TAVERNISE)\n\nThe Joker is needed, but not really that old Dark Knight. It\u2019s not called \u201cBatman: Joker.\u201d Or \u201cBatman: The Wonder Years.\u201d You have Joaquin, you have Joker. That\u2019s all you need guys. So why is Bruce Wayne standing there again, over the bodies of his dead parents, at the end of yet another movie, the first stop on the road to becoming a superhero?\n\nLike other Bat-adjacent projects over the years, it\u2019s almost like they can\u2019t help themselves, as if imagining a Gotham City without the fan-favorite Caped Crusader playing some role would be the highest form of sacrilege.\n\nFox\u2019s recent \u201cGotham\u201d TV series also was meant to show the city in its pre-Batman years, focusing on cop Jim Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and his efforts dealing with a corrupt town full of familiar colorful criminals. However, the series ended up being just as much about young Bruce Wayne (David Mazouz). The final shot of the entire five-season series? Mazouz in a Batsuit.\n\n'It's shaky ground as an actor': Joaquin Phoenix charts an unpredictable path as 'Joker'\n\nReview: Joaquin Phoenix's 'Joker' questions if there's empathy for the devil\n\nHallelujah for small favors, because \u201cJoker\u201d doesn\u2019t have a brooding vigilante running around in a cape and cowl or hanging off gargoyles on tall buildings. The guy in the garish face paint and green hair definitely gets the spotlight. Make no mistake, though: Batman\u2019s there even when he\u2019s not exactly Batman.\n\nEarly on, the very wealthy Thomas Wayne (Brett Cullen) is introduced as a mayoral candidate who wants to clean up Gotham. He and Arthur wouldn\u2019t otherwise have anything to do with one another until Arthur finds out his mom Penny (Frances Conroy) has been writing mysterious letters to Thomas about taking care of her and \u201chis son.\u201d Arthur investigates and finds his birth certificate, which lists Thomas Wayne as his father.\n\nArthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) cares for his mom Penny (Frances Conroy) in \"Joker.\" (Photo: NIKO TAVERNISE)\n\nHis psychological mindset wasn\u2019t great in the first place, with Arthur murdering three Wall Street types who beat him up on the subway and his idol Murray Franklin (Robert De Niro) making fun of Arthur on his late-night show. But he starts to go really off the rails, going to Wayne Manor and interacting with young boy Bruce Wayne (Dante Pereira-Olson) \u2013 and getting rebuffed by protective butler Alfred (Douglas Hodge) \u2013 before ultimately confronting Thomas himself. The elder Wayne punches Arthur in the nose after telling him about Penny's own delusions and that Arthur was actually adopted.\n\nOn a quest for the truth, Arthur goes to Arkham State Hospital and finds evidence of being abused as a child, with Penny being committed for child endangerment and diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder. Arthur finds adoption records, too, and though his real parentage is still left a bit of a mystery, he's driven to kill his mom as his mental state unwinds.\n\nWhile the mere idea of the Joker being a Bat-bro is intriguing in a sense, it just creates connections that don\u2019t really need to be there. However, it\u2019s not the most egregiously unnecessary Easter egg in \u201cJoker.\u201d That comes in the film\u2019s fiery finale.\n\nArthur goes full Joker, getting invited on Murray\u2019s late-night show as a guest while throngs of people in clown masks descend on city hall. Instead of killing himself as he planned, Joker admits to the subway murders that created the \"Kill the Rich\" movement and shoots his comedy idol in the head on live television. That leads to riots in the streets, a night full of Gotham burning and Arthur escaping police custody and posing victoriously on the hood of a squad car with his acolytes cheering.\n\nWhile all this is going down, though, the Waynes leave a night at the movies and take a shortcut down a dark alley to escape the rancor. They\u2019re accosted by one of Joker's followers, a man with a clown mask who shoots the parents and leaves the boy alive \u2013 the beginnings of Batman\u2019s origin that first appeared on a comic page 80 years.\n\nLet\u2019s give the movie one bit of credit: Having a theater with \u201cZorro: The Gay Blade\u201d on the marquee \u2013 a twist on \u201cThe Mark of Zorro\u201d from the comics \u2013 is clever with this Gotham being based on New York circa 1981. But it\u2019s the same tragic incident we see included in Tim Burton\u2019s 1989 \u201cBatman,\u201d Christopher Nolan\u2019s 2005 \u201cBatman Begins,\u201d Zack Snyder\u2019s 2016 \u201cBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice,\u201d the first episode of \u201cGotham\u201d and umpteen times in various comics, cartoons and video games to boot. It\u2019s pretty safe to say at this point if a Wayne shows up in a Batman project, the Grim Reaper\u2019s not far behind.\n\nBruce Wayne (Gus Lewis, left) mourns his parents (Linus Roache and Sara Stewart) in \"Batman Begins.\" Their deaths also factor into the new \"Joker.\" (Photo: DAVID JAMES/WARNER BROS.)\n\nAgain, worth a reminder: This isn\u2019t a Batman movie. It\u2019s \u201cJoker.\" Aren't we supposed to follow the origins of the Dark Knight\u2019s greatest foe, not Bats himself? The scene ties into Gotham\u2019s anti-rich sentiment stoked by Joker\u2019s actions, but it\u2019s not like the villain pulled the trigger himself. (That was Jack Nicholson in \u201cBatman.\u201d) Instead, it\u2019ll just get fans aflutter online that this \u2013 of course! \u2013 foreshadows a meeting between Phoenix and a certain debuting superhero star who became famous for playing a sparkly vampire.\n\nA cynic might believe that\u2019s what Warner Bros. wants \u2013 the Caped Crusader is their sacred cash Bat-cow, after all. However, it\u2019s difficult to put on a happy face for one more disturbing, pointless murder in a movie that\u2019s brutal enough already. And disappointingly, it\u2019s a broken promise that treads familiar bloody asphalt instead of being actually groundbreaking.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/06/joaquin-phoenix-joker-leans-into-batman-connections-spoilers/3857451002/", "description": "Joaquin Phoenix's 'Joker' promised a different spin on Batman's foe.
