The app, which is free to download, is an electronic version of your existing driver licence.\n\nHowever, you might want to take a look at the permissions before hitting that install button. According to Google, downloading the app gives Service NSW access to your camera, calendar, storage and \"confidential information\". Here's what you need to know.\n\nThe NSW Digital Driver Licence can only be accessed through the Service NSW app. On the Google Play Store, applications are required to publicly declare all app permissions. By downloading the Service NSW app, you are consenting to the following:\n\nThis app has access to: Calendar - read calendar events plus confidential information - add or modify calendar events and send email to guests without owners' knowledge Camera take pictures and videos Photos / Media / Files - read the contents of your USB storage - modify or delete the contents of your USB storage Location - approximate location (network-based) - precise location (GPS and network-based) Storage - read the contents of your USB storage - modify or delete the contents of your USB storage Other - receive data from Internet - Google Play license check - full network access - prevent device from sleeping - view network connections - control vibration - pair with Bluetooth devices\n\nThat's, uh, a lot.\n\nNow, it's worth noting that it's quite common for apps to have multiple permissions that seem unusual or unrelated to the app's chief function. More often than not there's an innocent explanation. With that said, giving a government agency access to all of the above might be construed as problematic by some users.\n\nInterestingly, the South Australian digital driver licence asked for similar permissions when it launched back in 2017. At the time, the South Australian government was forced to deny it was inappropriately accessing private information about drivers through the app.\n\nWe're reaching out to Service NSW and will update the article when we hear back. In the meantime, you might want to hold off on downloading that digital licence - the one in your wallet still works just fine.\n\nUpdate:\n\nService NSW has provided Lifehacker Australia with the following statement:\n\nThe Service NSW app is built with a privacy by design approach which prioritises the security of our customers\u2019 private information. There is a list found in the Android Play store which has prompted confusion because it shows a record of all permissions used in older versions of the app. The only special permission requested in the latest version of the Service NSW app is the device camera which allows customers to use the Digital Driver Licence verifying and venue sign-in features. A customer can choose to turn this off and go without the features. The special permissions in previous versions of the app always related directly to features and functionality which existed at the time. If we require special permissions in future, we will ask customers for their consent and clearly explain why we need it. Service NSW has built the app to deliver an exceptional experience and not to monitor our customers.", "description": "Yesterday Service NSW officially launched the Digital Driver Licence (DDL) app for Android and iOS devices statewide.
