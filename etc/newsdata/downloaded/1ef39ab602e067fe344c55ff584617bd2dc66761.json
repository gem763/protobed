But who was patient zero? Strangely enough, it was A$AP Rocky, who wore a Gucci silk scarf to a Los Angeles benefit dinner last November, and also more recently devoted a whole track to this unassuming accessory, the appropriately titled \u201cBabushka Boi.\u201d\n\nIt seems Rocky has found a new convert, and it\u2019s none other than Jaden Smith. Attending the Los Angeles launch of the latest drop from his lifestyle label MSFTSrep this past Saturday, the 21-year-old multihyphenate took the trend into more psychedelic territory, sporting a scarf that was covered in multi-colored tie-dye. It was intended as a nod to the mini-collection, titled \u201cTrippy Summer,\u201d which was produced in collaboration with the sock brand Stance.\n\nSmith is well-known for his willingness to rip up the rule book when it comes to the staid conventions of menswear. And whether it was appearing in a skirt for a Louis Vuitton campaign, or wearing dresses to hang out with friends in Calabasas, he\u2019s never shied away from embracing his feminine side. So it makes perfect sense that he\u2019d be on board with this very flamboyant trend\u2014plus, by throwing tie-dye into the mix, he also managed to give it a fresh spin.\n\nOriginally Appeared on Vogue\n\n", "description": "Even Hollywood royalty have taken to rocking the kaleidoscopic babushka.", "authors": ["Liam Hess"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4fRH.fYkIBNDgfWqBnAseQ--~B/aD0yOTc5O3c9NTI5NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/vogue_137/e3c8939401b86b57e914b866d1ab6891"}
