Scherzer has never pitched in the wild-card round, but he is treating this like any other elimination game. It might seem unlikely the right-hander would even get to those last 15 pitches \u2014 he typically starts on them with a pitch count around 100 \u2014 because do-or-die games usually mean quick hooks. But Manager Dave Martinez intimated Sunday that he wouldn\u2019t lift him at the first sign of trouble.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nMax Scherzer feels as strong as ever for wild-card start\n\nThe manager waved off any concern that his star pitcher felt any lingering effects from the back injuries that forced him to miss six weeks of the second half. He reiterated Scherzer\u2019s last five outings of the season \u2014 less than six innings per start, a 5.16 ERA \u2014 did not represent his actual ability. He blamed the team for limiting Scherzer and assured everyone \u201che\u2019s going to be better than fine.\u201d\n\nLast week, Scherzer told Martinez he\u2019s ready to throw 120 pitches Tuesday. The veteran right-hander\u2019s tone alone showed the manager how \u201cjacked up\u201d his starter is.\n\n\u201cAnd rightfully so,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to play a one-game series. For me, who better to start that game than Max? We talked about [Stephen Strasburg], but if this all works out, now all of a sudden you\u2019ve got Stras and [Patrick] Corbin for the next [series].\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Post analyzed, pitch by pitch, each of Scherzer\u2019s final innings this season and found that, if Scherzer gets deep into the game Tuesday, if he nears his unload inning, the numbers indicate Martinez should not hesitate to leave his starter in. Scherzer has been at full strength for 17 final frames since May and, while his strikeout rate dips slightly, his hit rate, walk rate and ERA do, too. He has allowed four runs in 22\u2154 innings, though all four came within his past three starts.\n\nThe analysis revealed that, in a last inning, Scherzer doesn\u2019t look tired. He pitches just as strong as he does in the first \u2014 sometimes stronger. He throws strikes at nearly the same rate (67 percent) and his fastball just as hard, if not harder. He consistently touches 97 and 98 mph on his last pitches of the game and rises to the situation. He\u2019s allowed three leadoff doubles in his last inning of a game since May and allowed none of those runners to score.\n\nScherzer navigates the end of his outings using almost the same arsenal he starts with. He depends on the fastball (45 percent), change-up (14), curveball (8) and cutter (7) at about the same rate as he does in any other inning. His slider, though, jumps from about 20 percent to 27. Scherzer asserts there\u2019s no special reason he relies on the slider late, it\u2019s not easier to control when he\u2019s tired or more effective against hitters who have seen him a few times by then. Scherzer chooses, moment by moment, whether to pitch by the scouting report or by what he\u2019s feeling good about that day.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat's instincts,\u201d he said. \u201cYou do the same thing over and over again, they'll beat you. You got to be able to change it up.\u201d\n\nBoswell: Sharks are chomping at Nats Park, and I think we\u2019re going to need a bigger bandwagon\n\nScherzer started thinking about his last 15 pitches when he got to college. The kid had, in high school, gotten by even when his velocity fell from the low 90s at the start of the game to the mid-80s when he finished. He realized at Missouri he couldn\u2019t survive on fire and struggled to finish starts. He started throwing more and, in the weight room, strengthened his legs and chest and back, building his body to withstand more innings.\n\n\u201c[That\u2019s] when I finally had to start getting my man strength,\u201d Scherzer said.\n\nMissouri\u2019s pitching coach, Tony Vitello, matched Scherzer\u2019s energy and pushed his young starter to stay stronger later. Vitello preached getting ahead of hitters, and Scherzer found over time that he could do it with swings and misses on his fastball deeper and deeper into games. The Mizzou pitching staff used to compete by throwing at targets on a tarp called the \u201cControl Master,\u201d and catcher J.C. Field watched from behind the plate as Scherzer became one of the best at putting a fastball at the knees, inside or out. What he saw then, at practice and late in games, became the coda to Scherzer\u2019s starts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cBetween the ears, he was stronger than anyone I ever knew,\u201d Field said, adding, \u201cHe would be really hard on himself every time he missed a spot in a bullpen. It was that consistent competitiveness on a pitch-to-pitch basis.\u201d\n\nScherzer has reached heights few could have seen coming in those early days at Missouri. Yet he\u2019s never captured the elusive World Series title. He returned to Detroit earlier this season for the first time since he signed with the Nationals in 2015, and he sat in the Comerica Park visitors\u2019 dugout, expressing disbelief that those Tigers teams never won one. He has had promising chances in Washington, too, but none ever panned out. He\u2019s 35 now and running out of time, closing in on the last 15 pitches of his career.\n\nHe knows it. This team, after the year it\u2019s had, seems to give him as good a chance as any. The Nationals need him in top form Tuesday, first pitch to last. He knows it\u2019ll be a challenge.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t win \u2018em all. I don\u2019t,\u201d he said recently in the Nationals\u2019 clubhouse. \u201cI\u2019ve been beat in those situations plenty of times. But you got to want the ball in that situation no matter what.\u201d\n\nHe was talking about his mind-set in a final frame, but it seemed bigger.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRead more on the Washington Nationals:\n\nNew York to new life: How a humbling sweep set the Nationals straight\n\nCharting the wildest season in Nationals history\n\nThe 12 best moments from the Nationals\u2019 wild 2019 season\n\nSvrluga: Ryan Zimmerman is at the end of his deal, and it\u2019s hard to imagine the Nats without him\n\nBaseball according to Gerardo Parra\n\nAD", "description": "In his starts, the Nationals ace cares most about emptying the tank.", "authors": ["Sam Fortier", "Sports Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/fiTY37FJrSuzKAXUuOYOm8EzyrY=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3NMVLVHANMI6TPT7JTEFAF6DN4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
