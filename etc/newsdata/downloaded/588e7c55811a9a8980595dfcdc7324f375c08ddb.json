Photo: DC Entertainment/Neal Adams; Dick Giordano; Tom Ziuko\n\nOne of the most fascinating aspects of superhero fiction is the ease with which a character\u2019s initial creator can become its least important author. Monthly comic books have been and continue to be the genre\u2019s womb, and they\u2019re a fundamentally iterative medium. As the years and issues wear on, the writers and artists who conceive of characters frequently leave their creations behind, only for new folks to pick them up and run with them. That often means the first version of a figure isn\u2019t nearly as resonant with audiences as a subsequent one, which might take that figure\u2019s core ideas and tweak or overhaul them so that they really sing for an audience.\n\nThere are well-known examples of such character arcs among the good guys: Martin Nodell invented the Green Lantern in the 1940s, but the only reason you\u2019ve heard his name was due to a complete reimagining of his world in the \u201960s by John Broome and Gil Kane. The X-Men originated in a 1963 comic written by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee, but it was only with the arrival of writer Chris Claremont more than a decade later that the mutants truly crystallized into the versions that are currently famous. The reason Daredevil has had a movie and a TV show is because Frank Miller reinvented him in the \u201980s. And so on. But the same thing can happen with villains: Mister Freeze was a tossed-off gimmick until Batman: The Animated Series made him a tragic figure; Magneto gained a core component of his character when he was retrofitted with a Jewish identity; and, perhaps lesser known than the others, there\u2019s the rebirth of the Joker.\n\nNowadays, one tends to think of the Clown Prince of Crime as \u2014 to borrow a term from video games \u2014 the Final Boss of the Batman mythos. He is, as Neil Gaiman put it in a comics story a decade ago, the White Whale to Batsy\u2019s Ahab, the Moriarty to his Holmes. Where Batman pursues a near-fascistic vision of order, the Joker is what Christopher Nolan\u2019s The Dark Knight refers to as an \u201cagent of chaos.\u201d The two are matter and antimatter, oil and water, an unstoppable force and an immovable object, a mythic hero and a trickster god, or any number of other overwrought metaphors.\n\nWhile you can certainly tell great stories with other entrants in Batman\u2019s rogues gallery \u2014 Two-Face, Catwoman, Poison Ivy, what have you \u2014 none of them fascinate the hero and his readers the way the Joker does. There\u2019s a reason he\u2019s the first of DC Comics\u2019 Caped Crusader\u2019s antagonists to get his own movie, which comes out this week: His wanton murderousness is the platonic ideal of everything Batman struggles against. And yet, it was not always thus. In fact, it wasn\u2019t until a now-obscure story was published in 1973 that the Joker turned a corner and started to become what he is now. The tale is called \u201cThe Joker\u2019s Five-Way Revenge\u201d and it appeared in the 251st issue of Batman, which hit stands in July of that year. Written by Denny O\u2019Neil and drawn by Neal Adams, it is one of the most important Batman stories ever told.\n\nPrior to its publication, the Joker was just another Bat baddie. Granted, he debuted in the first issue of Batman back in 1940, but that series was actually only the second one to star Batman, popping up after the protagonist\u2019s own debut in Detective Comics the previous year. Accounts of Joker\u2019s creation differ wildly, as is sadly common for so many figures in the petty, fly-by-night world of superhero comics. Each member of the trio of Batman mythos\u2019 founding fathers \u2014 the late Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson \u2014 at one time admitted that the Joker had been partially inspired by actor Conrad Veidt\u2019s portrayal of a man cursed with a permanent grin in the 1928 film The Man Who Laughs, based on the novel of the same name by Victor Hugo. However, the three men emphasized their own respective contributions when recounting the origins of Joker, often at the expense of one or both of their colleagues. The details get wonky; you can read more in the remarkably detailed Wikipedia entry on the matter. Robinson would eventually claim that he\u2019d always aimed to have Joker become Batman\u2019s archvillain, but the fact is that the character never really ascended to that role until decades after his creation. He appeared regularly in Batman comics, but was no more memorable than other gimmicky bad guys.\n\nExcerpt from Batman No. 251.

In the 1966 movie that emerged from the series, he was merely part of a coalition of villains. The Joker was still just another antagonist, one with the dull twist that he looked and acted like a clown. To make matters worse, the Batman of the early \u201940s to the early \u201970s wasn\u2019t an especially grim or gritty character \u2014 the hero brimmed with sunshine in that age of comic-book self-censorship.\n\nBut the whole gestalt of Batman began to change on a fundamental level in 1969. That\u2019s when O\u2019Neil and Adams took the reins of the character, tasked by editor Julius Schwartz with taking the hero back to his dark roots after the collapse of the bright TV show. The pair were already famed in the world of comics and they wasted no time in their mission to bring Batsy back into the shadows. They specialized in villains, cranking out a run of stories that introduced the tortured mutant Man-Bat and the ecoterrorist mastermind Ra\u2019s al Ghul, among others. But an order from Schwartz made them roll their eyes.\n\n\u201cAt some point, our editor, Julie Schwartz, basically said, \u2018You know, guys, we gotta bring in the clowns,\u2019\u201d Adams recalls. They were headed in a direction of realism when they were told they had to resurrect a historically goofy lineup of past Bat stories. \u201cSo what do you do with a Joker?\u201d Adams remembers them asking themselves. \u201cWell, we took a harder edge. We decided that Joker was just a little crazy.\u201d Prior to that, Joker hadn\u2019t really been given much in the way of motivation or nuance; he was just a guy who liked committing crimes in a silly fashion. O\u2019Neil \u2014 who couldn\u2019t be reached for comment \u2014 and Adams were the first to make the decision: Joker would be a homicidal, mentally unstable maniac. They didn\u2019t explore his origin story, but they would suggest through his actions that there was something innately wrong with him that made him lethally dangerous.\n\nWhat O\u2019Neil and Adams arrived at \u2014 as one might expect from the title of that 251st issue \u2014 was a story of revenge. It was established from the very beginning that theirs was a harsher Joker saga than any before it. Open the comic and see a full-page panel of the Joker\u2019s cackling rictus as he drives a vehicle, complete with ominous narration the likes of which had never been associated with him: \u201cFrom the darkness of a country road somewhere north of Gotham City \u2026 and from the greater dark of a past filled with evil \u2026 comes a terrifyingly familiar face! Thunder racks the earth and lightning scars the sky and wetness streams from the clouds like tears of mourning! It is as though nature itself were weeping! And well it might, for there is death abroad this night!\u201d\n\nOver the course of 23 pages, fans got a tale in which the Joker revisits five of his former thugs, all of whom had betrayed him, attempting to murder each one of them while Batman races to stop him. Batsy is unsuccessful with the first four but just barely manages to save the fifth. All the while, the killings become more elaborate and gruesome. At one point, a notable Joker trope is introduced: He has the chance to kill Batman but chooses not to because the death wouldn\u2019t be grand enough to befit the hero, whom he has a twisted affection for. In the final set piece, Joker imagines an elaborate deathtrap for a thug in a wheelchair, whereby he\u2019ll be pushed into a tank with a ravenous shark. Batman and Joker strike a deal before the thug is killed; Batman will take the thug\u2019s place. But Joker welches on the deal and pushes them both into the tank.\n\nThe climax is, paradoxically enough, the kind of goofy thing that might happen in the \u201960s TV show: an underwater Batman wildly swinging a wheelchair at the wall of a giant aquarium in order to shatter it and escape. He\u2019s successful and manages to catch up to the fleeing Joker when the latter trips and falls on an oil spill that he\u2019d created as part of his murder plot, after which Batsy and Joker partake in some concluding banter. \u201cYou\u2019re not laughing!? Don\u2019t you see the joke?\u201d Batman asks. \u201cNo! Not funny!\u201d is Joker\u2019s reply. Batman rebuts him: \u201cYou\u2019re wrong! It is funny \u2014 to think that you \u2014 my arch-enemy \u2014 would make me grateful for \u2026 pollution!\u201d (I\u2019ll admit that I don\u2019t really find it funny, either, so the Joker gets a point from me.)\n\nExcerpt from Batman No. 251.

Without Batman #251, we likely wouldn\u2019t have had the Joker starring in such films as the Tim Burton\u2013directed Batman, the aforementioned The Dark Knight, or Todd Phillips\u2019s brutal new Joaquin Phoenix star vehicle \u2014 the latter of which is already being billed as the character\u2019s apotheosis. The comic most often mentioned as source material for Joker is Alan Moore and Brian Bolland\u2019s Batman: The Killing Joke, which posited a possible origin story for the Clown Prince of Crime. But as titanic as that 1988 story is, it likely wouldn\u2019t have been possible if O\u2019Neil and Adams hadn\u2019t suggested a brutal interiority and chaotic instability for the character 15 years earlier.\n\nThe character has evolved greatly since 1973, but his fundamental status in the canon hasn\u2019t changed. Adams saw the new film and is confident and more than a little proud that the ideas from his and O\u2019Neil\u2019s 46-year-old comic made it to the bad guy\u2019s biggest moment yet. As he puts it, \u201cI think that the result of that egg that Denny and I laid came out to be a really wonderful chicken.\u201d Sounds about right for a guy who\u2019s into jokes.", "description": "Although Batman foe the Joker was first introduced in 1940, he spent the next few decades as just another gimmicky antagonist.
