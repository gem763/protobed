Lots of people fall into the debt trap because they do things they could easily have avoided. Financial success or financial freedom requires you to have a plan. Your plan does not have to be the best plan under the sun, but you need a plan nonetheless. There are two ways in particular in which people get caught out: lifestyle creep and believing that they have to keep up with their peers.\n\nLifestyle creep or middle class syndrome\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard the saying, \u201cMotho o phela ka sekoloto (You can only live and survive if you have debt).\u201d I first heard someone say this quite early on in my career. It was someone who was older than me and who had been working for much longer than I had. She believed her statement and lived by it throughout her career. With every pay increase, she found another expense on which to spend the money in her budget.\n\nYou earn more, so you spend more, and suddenly find that you are living from payday to payday.\n\nMany people get caught up in lifestyle creep \u2013 also known as middle class syndrome \u2013 when they get a pay rise. You earn more, so you spend more, and suddenly find that you are living from payday to payday. So you work harder, get another raise and repeat the cycle.\n\nLifestyle creep can happen to anyone who is not intentional about money. It occurs when your standard of living increases with every pay increase (or discretionary income increase). Often, what happens is that something that was previously a luxury now becomes a \u201cnecessity\u201d. For example, I know people who had a standard gym membership when they started out in their career, but as their income increased they upgraded to a nationwide membership \u2013 yet their work doesn\u2019t even take them out of town. They have let a luxury become a necessity.\n\nWarren Buffett says this about living from salary to salary: \u201cShould you find yourself in a chronically leaking boat, energy devoted to changing vessels is likely to be more productive than energy devoted to patching leaks.\u201d\n\nWhat he means is that when you\u2019re living in this cycle, it can be hard to find the time or, more importantly, the resources to take a step back and address your financial issues at their core, but that trying to patch up the situation rather than address its root cause can perpetuate the cycle. Some examples of patches on the cycle of living from payday to payday are payday loans or \u201chardship withdrawals\u201d from your retirement fund.\n\nI have personally heard of people who want to quit their jobs so that they can cash in their pension or provident fund to pay off their debts. This is a huge financial mistake. While a financial patch might get you out of a pinch, in the long run it almost always sets you up for failure.\n\nBy contrast, what does \u201cchanging vessels\u201d mean? It means: Looking for regular expenses you can trim;\n\nRe-evaluating your needs versus your wants; and\n\nDowngrading on some high-expenditure items.\n\nEven a year of sacrifice can set you apart from others who are in the same sinking boat. If downgrading means that you have to sell your luxury car for a cheaper and more affordable one or move in with a family member, do it. Changing vessels might take time and effort, but it may be a good long-term solution and one that pays high rewards.\n\n\n\nSka ba hemisa, ska ba fa chance (Keeping up with the Khumalos)\n\nNothing hinders financial progress more than trying to keep up with your peers or friends (some might even call them frenemies). You may have heard young professionals say, \u201cSka ba hemisa, ska ba fa chance\u201d, which loosely translates as, \u201cDon\u2019t let them breathe, don\u2019t give them a chance to shine.\u201d When I hear someone say this, I want to ask them: \u201cWhen are you going to give yourself a chance to flourish financially? When are you going to give yourself a chance to build real wealth?\u201d\n\nInternationally known Chinese-Canadian entrepreneur and business magnate Dan Lok says this about the difference between rich and poor: \u201cBefore they [the rich] buy the fancy watch, they buy the investments. The investment makes them money, and then they buy the fancy watch. But you don\u2019t want to do that, because you have a big ego. You want to show the world and your family that you\u2019ve \u2018made it\u2019. Which you haven\u2019t. You want to look rich versus be rich. You go and buy the expensive watch/car and everybody thinks you\u2019ve made it. You did not make it. You just made yourself poorer. If you can, have the self-discipline and self-control to buy the asset first. Once you buy the assets, you can buy all the luxuries you want. Your assets will pay for them. Your assets make you money. Your investments provide for you; your investments feed you. That\u2019s the difference!\u201d\n\nSpending money you haven\u2019t earned yet\n\nA bad habit many people have is spending money they haven\u2019t earned yet. Let me give you an example: if you work in sales, most companies will offer you an advance against your future earnings. Or, from my own personal experience, I can tell you that when I was asked to write this book, my publisher offered me an advance. But I said, \u201cNo, thank you!\u201d I didn\u2019t want to spend money I hadn\u2019t earned yet.\n\nIt is even worse when people use their credit card or overdraft to spend money on consumables. When it\u2019s time to pay back the amount owing, they often barely remember what they bought, and the pleasure of owning the item they bought has long since worn off.\n\nThis is an Extract from You\u2019re Not Broke, You\u2019re Pre-Rich If you are looking for a guide that is easy to read on how to manage your finances, personal finance coach and founder of Woman & Finance Mapalo Makhu has just released her book You\u2019re Not Broke, You\u2019re Pre-Rich.\n\nIt\u2019s a great guide on how to ditch debt and stop living from payday to payday, and it also deals with relevant topics such as managing black tax and selecting the right investments to grow your wealth. You can purchase a copy of the book at any good bookstore.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "Let\u2019s be real: in many cases our bad money habits hold us back from reaching the seemingly elusive state of financial freedom.
