Tweet less", "language": "en", "text": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Former US president Jimmy Carter has two simple pieces of advice for Donald Trump as he faces the threat of impeachment: tell the truth \u2014 and tweet less.\n\nAsked by MSNBC about the stance of his present-day successor, who has rejected the congressional probe into his dealings with Ukraine as a \u201ckangaroo court,\u201d the Democrat, who just turned 95, had strong words for Trump.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a departure\u2026 from what American people expect,\u201d Carter said, after the White House blocked a top US diplomat from testifying before the House of Representatives.\n\n\u201cSo I think that that in itself is going to be another evidence \u2014 another item of evidence that can be used against him if he continues to stonewall and prevent the evidence to be put forward to the House of Representatives and the Senate to consider,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for advice, as Trump navigates this particularly delicate moment in his presidency?\n\n\u201cMy advice to him would be to tell the truth\u2026 and also to cut back on his Twitter feeds,\u201d said Carter, who served as head of state from 1977 to 1981.\n\nHours after Carter\u2019s comments, the White House slammed the door on any cooperation with the Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe, calling it \u201cconstitutionally invalid\u201d in a letter to Congress.\n\nCarter, who last week became the first American president to reach the age of 95, fell and injured his head Sunday at his home in the southern state of Georgia.\n\nBut he appeared the very next day at a volunteer site for the nonprofit Habitat for Humanity, with a black eye and a bandage covering 14 stitches.", "description": "Washington (AFP) \u2013 Former US president Jimmy Carter has two simple pieces of advice for Donald Trump as he faces the threat of impeachment: tell the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/08/0cbf68_jimmy-carter-in-2017-is-us-president-reach-age-95-carter-advice-trump-tweet-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
