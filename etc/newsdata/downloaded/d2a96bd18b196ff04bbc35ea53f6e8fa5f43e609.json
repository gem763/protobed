The list includes nearly 20 names (a number of which are Yahoo sub-sites), including bigger partners like Reuters, CBS, Sports Illustrated and HuffPo. The available outlets are as follows:\n\nCBS News\n\nReuters\n\nHuffington Post\n\nBloomberg\n\nYahoo News\n\nYahoo Finance\n\nYahoo Sports\n\nYahoo Entertainment\n\nAOL News\n\nAl Jazeera\n\nPeople\n\nEntertainment Weekly\n\nSports Illustrated\n\nCheddar\n\nNewsy\n\nWochit\n\nThere are a number of big names missing, of course \u2014 The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, NPR and CNN all spring to mind. Though, admittedly, these sorts of content deals can be tricky, through a combination of paywalled content and the kind of flash news feature that\u2019s required to serve content through a smart assistant. Amazon promises to \u201ccontinue to expand its news content selection over time.\u201d\n\nOnce the outlets have been chosen, users can access it by asking Alexa to \u201cplay the news.\u201d Alexa-enabled Fire tablets will be getting the app at some point in the near future.", "description": "Beginning today, Amazon will be rolling out a news aggregation app for Fire TV users in the U.S. The app serves up a customizable news experience from a number of different outlets.
