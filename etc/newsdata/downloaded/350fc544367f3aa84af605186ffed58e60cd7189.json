Investors have watched as they have risen from 139p, just over a year after Lewis took over, to 237.2p (up 0.4 per cent, or 0.9p) yesterday, though admittedly they are not yet back at pre-disaster levels.\n\nThe question now is whether there is room to grow while discounters Aldi and Lidl nibble away at the UK giant's market share year-by-year, and the online threat mounts.\n\nLewis said a return to strong profit margins, while maintaining relationships with suppliers, was at the heart of his strategy.\n\nImproved margins have contributed to the strong profit growth of 6.7 per cent to \u00a3494million in the first half, putting the company on track to record \u00a31.8billion of pre-tax profit this year and \u00a32billion next year.\n\nOn an underlying basis, Tesco brought in \u00a31.41billion \u2013 25 per cent more than in the same period last year.\n\nFreddie Lait, chief investment officer of Latitude Investment Management, said this 'powerful ability to generate cash was key' for shareholders.\n\nThis week the interim payout was boosted from 1.67p to 2.65p.\n\nEstimates suggest year-end return could rise from 5.77p last year, to 7.94p this year and up to a generous 9p per share the year after. That would hand \u00a3880million back to shareholders.\n\nSome analysts are predicting share-price growth towards the 285p mark as well.\n\nTesco has highlighted the areas it is targeting for expansion including 750 Express stores in Thailand and 150 in the UK, plus four large superstores.\n\nLewis told investors the group can build and run stores more cheaply, allowing them to bring in returns after just three years.\n\nHe also hopes the online food delivery business, which has already gobbled up more than a third of the market, will double in size in the coming years.\n\nBut Murphy will face significant challenges, including finding new ways to counter Aldi and Lidl, which have boosted their market share to more than 14 per cent, while Tesco's continues to reduce.\n\nAnd just two weeks ago Aldi announced a round of store openings taking them to 1,200 locations by 2025.\n\nOne major shareholder called Lewis 'irresponsible' for leaving before he has shown the \u00a33.7billion takeover of cash-and-carry group Booker can generate long-term returns.\n\nTesco's UK sales growth is in the doldrums and there's trouble in the Central European business where the dominant Polish arm is undergoing a restructuring, with a possible sale rumoured.\n\nBut most investors agree that Tesco is back as the dominant force in British grocery retail. It remains the biggest supermarket by far and profits are forecast to rise steadily to \u00a32.4billion by 2021-22.\n\nThe Share Centre's Graham Spooner said: 'Investors appear not to be too concerned with the change at the top and are instead concentrating on the solid results.'\n\nAssuming Lewis has hidden no unexploded bombs, he has left a good basis for growth \u2013 though in the current retail climate, no business can afford to be complacent.", "description": "Lewis piloted the supermarket group through a \u00a3250m accounting scandal, and brought it back to profit after a \u00a36.4bn annual loss - the worst result in British retail history.", "authors": ["Lucy White For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
