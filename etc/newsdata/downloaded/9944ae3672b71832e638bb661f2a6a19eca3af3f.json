The Dealmaster is back with another round of discounts and price drops. Today's list is headlined by a deal on Amazon's Echo Dot, which you can effectively get for $9 or $11, depending on whether you're a Prime member. Amazon is bundling the diminutive smart speaker for $1 extra when you buy a month of its Music Unlimited streaming service, which costs $8 a month for Prime members or $10 a month for everyone else on its own. If you're a Prime member who is new to Music Unlimited, the bundle will cost $9; if not, it will go for $11.\n\nThe catch is that the deal requires you to enable auto-renewal on the subscription, but you're also free to cancel. (We'd wait until after you receive the Echo Dot just to be safe, though.) Either way, the Echo Dot sees frequent discounts but normally costs somewhere in the $30-50 range, so if you're just interested in the speaker, it's a good deal.\n\nAs with any smart speaker deal the Dealmaster highlights, we're obligated to remind you that the Echo Dot isn't exactly a darling of privacy advocates. Alexa can still be abused by malicious apps , Amazon has admitted it reviews samples of customer audio, and sounds the Echo captures can be used in criminal trials. There's a reason Amazon gives these things away for cheap so often\u2014margins on the hardware aren't its main concern. But chances are you already know how you feel about the privacy-to-utility ratio with devices like this.\n\nIf you don't need another smart speaker in your life, we also have deals on iPads, new 4K TVs from Vizio and Sony, Xbox One controllers, and more. Have a look at the full list below.\n\nDealmaster: An Ars newsletter The Dealmaster is launching its very own newsletter!
