One video also addresses TikTok\u2019s goal of creating a \u201cpositive\u201d social media environment, where creativity is celebrated and harassment is banned.\n\nThis particular value \u2014 that TikTok is for \u201cfun\u201d \u2014 is cited whenever the Beijing-based company is pressured about the app\u2019s censorship activity. Today, TikTok hides under claims that it\u2019s all about being a place for lighthearted, positive behavior. But in reality, it\u2019s censoring topics China doesn\u2019t want its citizens to know about \u2014 like the Hong Kong protests, for example. Meanwhile, it doesn\u2019t appear to take action on political issues in the U.S., where hashtags like #dumptrump or #maga have millions of views.\n\nTo figure out its approach to moderation, TikTok recently hired corporate law firm, K&L Gates, to advise it on how to create policies that won\u2019t have it coming under the eye of U.S. regulators.\n\nIn the meantime, TikTok is tackling the job of crafting the sort of community it wants through these instructive videos. But it\u2019s not just issuing its commands from the top-down \u2014 TikTok partners with its own creators to participate in the videos and then promote them to fans. The first set of videos, released in February, featured a dozen TikTok creators, for example.\n\nThis time around, the company has pulled in a dozen more, including: @nathanpiland, @d_damodel, @juniortvine, @Stevenmckell, @supershaund, @ourfire, @thedawndishsoap, @katjaglieson, @mahoganylox, @chanydakota, @shreksdumpster, and @christinebarger.\n\nThis is a much different approach to community-setting, compared with Twitter, Facebook or Instagram. Those platforms took years before they addressed users\u2019 basic needs for privacy, security and anti-harassment features, like filtering comments, blocking and muting, and more. In the meantime, social media became a haven for trolls and abuse.\n\nTikTok is approaching the problem from a different standpoint \u2014 by consciously creating a community where users are knowledgable and feel empowered to kick out the bad elements from disrupting their fun.\n\nThe only problem is that TikTok\u2019s definition of what\u2019s \u201cfun\u201d and appropriate has a political bent.\n\nCreativity and art aren\u2019t only meant for expressing positive sentiments. And given that TikTok is already enforcing China\u2019s censorship of topics like Tiananmen Square, Hong Kong, and Taiwan to its over 500M+ global monthly users, it wouldn\u2019t be a leap to find the company one day censoring all sorts of political speech and other social issues \u2014 effectively becoming a tool for China to spread its government\u2019s views to the wider world. And that\u2019s far less fun.", "description": "TikTok today released a new set of safety videos designed to playfully inform users about the app\u2019s privacy controls and other features \u2014 like how to filter comments or report inappropriate behavior, among other things.
