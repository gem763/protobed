It's not just in the capital Beirut, but across the country. The message they [protesters] are giving is of defiance and that they will continue to demand the resignation of the government,\" said Al Jazeera's Zeina Khodr, reporting from Beirut.\n\n\"While there are tens of thousands on the street protesting, there are still people who are backing the political parties, so it is not going to be easy to bring a change. These people out there want a nationalist leader whose loyalty is to Lebanon and not a political party.\"\n\nIn an attempt to appease demonstrators, Lebanon's finance minister, following a meeting with Prime Minister Saad Hariri, announced that they had agreed on a final budget that did not include any additional taxes or fees.\n\n191019144536157\n\n\"We want everybody to join us on Sunday and also Monday to topple the government,\" one protester said.\n\nOn Friday, Hariri gave a 72-hour deadline to his partners in government to agree on a solution to the country's economic woes without imposing new taxes.\n\nHezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah, whose movement is part of the government, warned on Saturday that a change in government would only worsen the situation.\n\nThe army on Saturday called on protesters to \"express themselves peacefully without harming public and private property\".\n\nOn Saturday evening, thousands were packed for a third straight night into the Riyadh al-Solh square in central Beirut, despite security forces having used tear gas and water cannon to disperse similar crowds a day before.\n\nAmnesty International said the security forces' reaction was excessive, pointing out that the vast majority of protesters were peaceful.\n\n\"The intention was clearly to prevent protesters gathering - in a clear violation of the right to peaceful assembly,\" it said.\n\nSmall groups of protesters have also damaged shop fronts and blocked roads by burning tyres and other obstacles.\n\nThe Internal Security Forces said 70 arrests were made on Friday on accusations of theft and arson.\n\nBut all of those held at the main police barracks were released on Saturday, the National News Agency (NNA) said.", "description": "Demonstrators are protesting against dire economic conditions in the heavily indebted country.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/20/3beeb0267e8c4e5cbecc8fece674eda0_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
