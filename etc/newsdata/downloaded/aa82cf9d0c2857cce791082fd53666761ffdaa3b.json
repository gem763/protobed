The SALT deduction cap and the IRS rules blocking blue states' workarounds to it are strongly opposed by Democratic lawmakers in high-tax states such as New York and New Jersey.\n\n\"On Wednesday, Senate Democrats will force a vote to nullify the IRS\u2019s horrible rule and put power back in the hands of homeowners,\" Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer Charles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerTurkey says soldier killed despite cease-fire in Syria Schumer calls for FDA to probe reports of contaminated baby food How Trump and Pelosi went from bad to worse MORE (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. \"America\u2019s homeowners shouldn\u2019t be forced to bear the brunt of the GOP\u2019s political games.\u201d\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRepublicans included the SALT deduction cap in their 2017 law in order to raise revenue that could be used to finance other tax cuts and because they thought that the deduction was subsidizing higher state taxes. Key GOP lawmakers defend the cap, noting that most people in high-tax states received a tax cut under the law.\n\nBut the cap has been criticized by Democrats as well as by a few GOP House members in high-tax states, who argue that it hurts their residents and hinders their states' abilities to offer public services.\n\nSeveral high-tax states enacted legislation in an effort to try to circumvent the cap, creating programs under which people could donate to state and local funds and receive a tax credit against their state and local taxes.\n\nBut in June, the IRS issued final regulations that prevent those funds from working as workarounds to the SALT deduction cap, upsetting policymakers in high-tax states.\n\nDemocrats plan to force a vote on the IRS rules by using the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to vote to nullify recently finalized guidance items. Senators can force a vote on a Congressional Review Act resolution with the signature of 30 senators.\n\n\u201cWith this CRA, we will force Republicans in the Senate to take notice,\" said Sen.

In an effort to get Republicans to support their measure, Democrats are pointing out that the IRS rules also curbed the federal tax benefits of donation-and-tax credit programs in red states.\n\n\"Republican senators have been requesting help for constituents who have been harmed by these regulations so they should join Democrats in overturning them,\u201d Senate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden Ronald (Ron) Lee WydenHillicon Valley: Facebook removes Russian, Iranian accounts trying to interfere in 2020 | Zuckerberg on public relations blitz | Uncertainty over Huawei ban one month out US ban on China tech giant faces uncertainty a month out Hillicon Valley: GOP lawmakers offer election security measure | FTC Dem worries government is 'captured' by Big Tech | Lawmakers condemn Apple over Hong Kong censorship MORE (D-Ore.) said.\n\nSchumer had first announced earlier this month that Senate Democrats would force a vote on the rules \u2014 one of several votes to overturn Trump administration regulations that Senate Democrats are forcing this fall.", "description": "Senate Democrats are expected to force a vote on Wednesday to overturn IRS regulations blocking workarounds to a provision in President Trump's 2017 tax-cut law, lawmakers announced Tuesday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/schumercharles_101619gn4_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
