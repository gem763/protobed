Based in cosmopolitan Montreal, the group evokes strong memories of the history of French-speaking Qu\u00e9becois in a song entitled \u201cD\u00e9generations.\u201d\n\nThe song\u2019s title is a play on words, evoking the decline and decay of Qu\u00e9becois society. It eventually became a sensation, but when it first came out its politically incorrect lyrics made it the object of an unoffical media ban. While the song lauds the festive impulse of dancing, it refers critically to abortion, spurns TV, gives unequivocal praise to their ancestors\u2019 (les a\u00efeux) high birthrates, and pours scorn on the new culture of empty nests.\n\nMusicians and artists are often the first to see irony and tragedy in a social crisis. \u201cD\u00e9generations\u201d highlights a recent social shift in Qu\u00e9bec, a reaction against the 1960s consensus. There is a new angst over the goals and assumptions that drove the province headlong into secular modernity, the so-called Quiet Revolution of the 1960s.\n\nThe Quiet Revolution was a disaster for the Church\u2014a case study for adherents of secularization theory. Almost overnight, Qu\u00e9bec emerged as a newly industrialized, twentieth-century society. Quebeckers have since ventured on a collective meander of self-discovery, a vaguely patriotic mission for progress, liberty, and social order that counsels the loosening of older inhibitions. Embracing modernity, Quebeckers have rejected the province\u2019s previously self-imposed isolation. Many believe that a cabal of Catholic prelates, English (Canadian) businessmen, and conservative politicians kept Qu\u00e9bec pious, rural, and poor. This narrative has predominated as Qu\u00e9bec has become more secular, urban, and wealthy.\n\nA quintessential expression of the social-liberal consensus can be found in the opinions of R\u00e9my, a garrulous character in Denys Arcand\u2019s 2003 film Barbarian Invasions . The film canvases a range of emotions and convictions borne of progressive individuality, set against dark forces of the past. In his better-known 1986 film, Jesus of Montr\u00e9al , Arcand promoted a secular Christology, smiting the Church and the corporate ethos along the way for good measure.\n\nBut the wheels of culture seem to be turning. In \u201cD\u00e9generations\u201d by Mes A\u00efeux, the culture vs. Church worldview collapses. The enemy is not the Church, not the English, not a dark past (real or imagined). Instead, the enemy becomes contemporary attitudes and mores. Only yesterday, it seems, expelling the dark past was the great common goal. Now the modernizing consensus seems to be falling apart.\n\nEvidence of change is not limited to folk songs. In 2007, in the context of public hearings on the place of immigrants in Qu\u00e9bec, a columnist for Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al remarked, \u201cYou\u2019d think the years when the Catholic Church lorded over Quebec society were a golden age . . . [that] it wasn\u2019t the Grande Noirceur [Great Darkness], but the Great Enlightenment.\u201d\n\nThe new nostalgia reflects a growing unease. In the face of pluralism, many Qu\u00e9becois feel that they have lost their roots, and this loss feels pervasive. The yearning for rootedness is manifest in the emphasis on the soil in the music video for \u201cD\u00e9generations.\u201d I\u2019ve never thought of Qu\u00e9bec nationalism as of the blood-and-soil type. With the exception of the FLQ (Front de Lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec) terrorism in the 1960s and early 1970s, Qu\u00e9bec nationalism has been a liberal, not a radical movement. These days, it\u2019s even an ethnically inclusive movement.\n\nYet, in order to embolden the listener to the joy of the ancestral dancing at the song\u2019s end, Mes A\u00efeux sings about a plot of land, of farming and of turning a small profit for a large family. The image is one of continuity: The soil gets passed on from one generation to the next. This stands in contrast to the contemporary descendant, who is cooped up with cabin fever (encaban\u00e9e) in a cold city apartment. The song ends with an invitation. The disaffected, loveless, childless products of the Quiet Revolution are then invited to get out and dance the way their grandparents danced.\n\nIn the Qu\u00e9bec of old, dance always had a whiff of defiance. To dance was to express cultural survival in the face of the long odds known as l\u2019hiver, winter. Every March, it is customary to visit a cabane sucre, or sugar shack, after four snowy, wintery months for some pea soup, ham, pancakes and maple syrup, and to celebrate the first fruits of spring in the trees\u2019 flowing sap. Typically, after the meal is finished, much dancing takes place.\n\nTraditional life in Qu\u00e9bec was rooted in the land, its rhythms, the adversities and joys it brings. It was a culture of gratitude. Contrast this cultural landscape with the arid, secular joylessness to which Quebeckers find themselves accustomed, a culture of anxious retirement planning without descendants to care for their parents. (The song refers to the REER, the Canadian equivalent of the American 401k,) It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way. Take Gilles Vigneault, the Quebec nationalists\u2019 singer-songwriter idol who wrote the now famous unofficial Quebec \u201cnational\u201d anthem called Gens du pays , People of the country. The refrain runs: \u201cGens du pays, c\u2019est votre tour / De vous laisser parler d\u2019amour.\u201d (\u201cPeople of the country, this is your turn / To let yourselves speak of love.\u201d) Is Vigneault\u2019s call to love the same as the call to joyful dance in \u201cD\u00e9generations\u201d?\n\nWell, no. Love was killed by the 1960s, precisely as \u201cD\u00e9generations\u201d narrates. Love is reduced to libertinism\u2014flight from an oppressive past straight into the oppression of a childless society. As for abortion, the members of the group reportedly felt obliged (under pressure, one wonders?) to foreswear any pro-life message in their lyrical lament. So, given the intolerance for any public, pro-life dissent, we are left to lament the inability of those singers to let their own lament be the dissent it really is. Confused? Apparently Mes A\u00efeux is too. Degeneration has that effect.\n\nThere are no religious references in the song. Maybe that can be chalked up to studied avoidance, given Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s Catholic roots. And, to this day, Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s Catholic roots are unmistakable, notably the imprint of Catholic social thought. For instance, the largest provincial banking institution\u2014the caisses populaires movement\u2014is a federation of formerly independent co-ops fostered by Catholic clergy a hundred years ago in order to provide savings and loan services for the French-speaking majority who could not access the English-dominated banks. It continues today as a modified form of distributism\u2014that once famous Catholic \u201cthird way\u201d between capitalism and socialism. Each spring, fittingly enough, as \u201ccaisse pop\u201d members, we receive a nice little three-figure dividend, a \u201csmall profit\u201d\u2014not unlike that gleaned from the fruits of the land. Cultural roots in Qu\u00e9bec run deep, close to the land and with a strong collectivist sentiment. But what about Catholicism itself?\n\nEvery Canadian Thanksgiving, my family makes the trek out to Saint Benoit du Lac , a Benedictine monastery in the bucolic eastern townships of Qu\u00e9bec. We go to Mass, buy some tax-free cheese, and pick apples in the monks\u2019 organic orchard. Each year, we see new monks in the sanctuary\u2014grey and white heads are no longer as ubiquitous around the altar. This year, a large busload of young adults affiliated with a new lay movement from the nearby town of Sherbrooke filled the pews. The Church was packed. Puzzling, I thought\u2014what is going on here?\n\nMaybe the unexpected popularity of \u201cD\u00e9generations\u201d finds an echo in real life commitments. In small steps, some Quebeckers are returning to a Christian way of life. The return to the spiritual taproot: one person, one town at a time. One day, perhaps, like the airplay suddenly granted to Mes A\u00efeux\u2019s song, a Christian re-emergence will be there for everyone to see. This will likely take a generation and much more regeneration.\n\nWhile baby boomers are still in thrall to the script of the 1960s, there are new moral sensibilities taking hold right under our noses. It\u2019s not a political protest. It\u2019s not a religious revival\u2014not yet, at least. What we hear is a lament for culture, a dissent, a reflection on Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s roots, a felt desire for something solid, permanent, and life-giving.\n\nPaul Allen is associate professor of theology at Concordia University, Montr\u00e9al.", "description": "Mes A\u00efeux is a Qu\u00e9bec folk-music troupe\u2014with a difference.
