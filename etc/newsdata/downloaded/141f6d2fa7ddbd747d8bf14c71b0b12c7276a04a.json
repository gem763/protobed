Officials said the 97-year-old suffers from dementia and is nonverbal.\n\nUTAH TEEN WHO SURVIVED BEING SHOT IN THE HEAD CROWNED HOMECOMING QUEEN\n\n\"Recently she's been known to hide or hunker down in a location,\" police said at the time.\n\nAs a police helicopter hovered over the neighborhood making announcements that officers were searching for the woman, a group of young sleuths began their own search of the streets for the 97-year-old. Logan Hultman, Kashton Claiborne and Makenna Rogers, who are all 10, and 11-year-old Hope Claiborne set out and eventually found Belford, several hours after she was reported missing, hiding in bushes a few blocks away from their homes.\n\n\u201cShe was right here and she was walking and she was talking to herself. And then when we came, she said, \u2018No, no, no. Go away, go away, go away,'\" Kashton told FOX40.\n\nHope, the oldest of the group, knew then what she had to do.\n\n\n\n\u201cI called 911 and I said that I found this missing woman,\u201d she told FOX40.\n\nTEXAS CHEERLEADER SAVES CHOKING TODDLER DURING HOMECOMING PARADE\n\nRoseville police said when officers arrived on the street in the neighborhood they were \"overwhelmed by the number of residents out of their houses, looking around the neighborhood.\"\n\n\"Our surprised dispatchers took the initial call from this team of junior detectives which helped connect officers to the missing person,\" police said on Facebook. \"This is a great example of our exceptional community coming together to lend a helping hand. This proves a great point, age is just a number and anyone can help out in a time of need.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe search didn't go off without some challenges. Before they found the 97-year-old, Logan told FOX40 he went over a bump on his bike that caused him to fall off. The group had to go back home to get cleaned up.\n\n\u201cSo we came all the way back and my brother patched me up,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLogan\u2019s mother, Alyssa Hultman, said her son gave her a blunt reason why the group found the need to go out searching for the woman on their own.\n\n\u201cHe looked at me like I was almost crazy and said, \u2018Because somebody needed help, mom. And when people need help you go and help them. That\u2019s what we do,\u2019\u201d Hultman told FOX40. \u201cSo that right there, that makes you proud.\u201d", "description": "A group of young neighborhood sleuths in California are being hailed for their efforts to help find a missing woman.", "authors": ["Travis Fedschun", "Travis Fedschun Is A Reporter For Foxnews.Com.
