USA TODAY\n\nSpoiler alert: This story contains the results from Monday's fourth week of \"Dancing With the Stars.\" Sit down with loved ones and watch the episode before reading this definitive rundown.\n\n\"Bachelorette\" Hannah Brown is no longer \"nice,\" pulling out her inner rage for the fourth week of \"Dancing With the Stars\" Monday night. Meanwhile, emotions and anger were spilling out at the judges' table, with Season 17 dancer Leah Remini serving as a guest judge, bringing a strong, often-opposing voice.\n\n\"This is going to turn into a slug-fest,\" said host Tom Bergeron after one exchange between Remini and curmudgeonly veteran Len Goodman.\n\nWho came unscathed and who was sent home in the competition?\n\nEverything to know about week three: Sean Spicer struck with disco 'Fever,' but there was a major loss\n\nThe 'DWTS' bombshell off the dancefloor: James Van Der Beek, wife Kimberly Brook expecting their sixth child\n\nSean Spicer and Lindsay Arnold bring the fire on \"Dancing With the Stars.\" (Photo: Eric McCandless, ABC)\n\nSean Spicer and pro Lindsay Arnold\n\nThe former presidential press secretary has been struggling with the judges, especially with last week's Movie Night tribute to \"Saturday Night Fever\" (a routine called a \"disaster blockbuster\" by judge Bruno Tonioli). But Spicer was confident the paso doble would fit his strident, military-inspired dancing style. The stone-faced Spicer was in character with a hot red flamenco outfit, and four small bonfires burning behind him. Looking more like a bull than matador, he made a valiant, always-smile effort and even attempted a flamenco clap (badly).\n\n\"You're not quite Antonio Banderas yet,\" said Tonioli. \"But you took the bull by the horns.\"\n\nRemini gave some tough love. \"Sean is not a dancer, that's very clear. It's not being mean,\" she said. She gave Spicer the best marks on the panel with a tepid 6, adding, \"You're trying your best.\"\n\nFinal score: 21/40\n\nSinger Ally Brooke and pro Sasha Farber\n\nPop star Brooke was on top of the leaderboard last week, and was perfectly suited to remain in lofty company with an energetic jive to \"Proud Mary.\" Her purple fringe dress would have made Tina Turner beam and the fringes were flying. Brooke ended with her hair extensions frazzled all over her head as she stood over Farber on the floor. The crowd was at loose ends.\n\nJudge Carrie Ann Inaba was blown away, giving an 8, a score matched by all the judges. \"Trying to do Tina Turner is difficult. We have high expectations. But you nailed it,\" said Inaba.\n\n\"You did 'Proud Mary.' I was proud. You should be proud,\" said Goodman.\n\nFinal score: 32/40\n\nComedian/actor Kel Mitchell and pro Witney Carson\n\nMitchell danced well last week, but still ended up in the precarious bottom two when combined with viewer votes. He was spared. Carson vowed to bring out more fun with the duo's cha-cha-cha that they pulled off with infectious joy, Mitchell beaming the entire time.\n\n\"Kel Mitchell, it's on, that's what I have been waiting for,\" Inaba said, standing up from her chair in her excitement. She gave Mitchell his first 8, a score that was matched by all judges.\n\n\"You've got the cha-cha-cha in your pocket,\" said Tonioli. \"I saw your personality coming out here. You were engaged.\"\n\n\"We started from the bottom, and now we're here,\" Mitchell said happily backstage.\n\nFinal score: 32/40\n\n'The Office' star Kate Flannery and pro Pasha Pashkov\n\nFlannery is showing she's a serious contender in the competition and continued to make funny talking about her upcoming Argentine tango. \"At 55, I can't believe I get to dance with a hot Russian,\" she said in the taped intro.\n\nBut the comedic actress had trouble trying to generate passion and heat in Pashkov's arms, even when he lowered her from his arms to the floor to end the dance. The judges weren't buying it.\n\n\"The problem is all about expectation. Your quickstep was so fantastic last week,\" said Goodman, who gave a lower 6. \"You struggled getting the character in the Argentine tango.\"\n\n\"She was holding to Pasha like a cougar holds onto her prey,\" said Tonioli in full beast mode, before dropping a criticism about her dance floor character. \"You lost the smoothness of the Argentine tango.\"\n\nFinal score: 26/40\n\nEmma Slater and James Van Der Beek were \"Walking on Sunshine.\" (Photo: Eric McCandless, ABC)\n\nActor James Van Der Beek and pro Emma Slater\n\nThe \"Dawson's Creek\" star had real-life inspiration for his quick-step to \"Walking on Sunshine.\" He announced that his wife Kimberly is pregnant with the couple's sixth child in the taped interview, a revelation that took place as the pair watched the first ultrasound. Van Der Beek's dance was energetic, with the smiling star jumping off a park bench, kicking up his heels, and working a semi-cartwheel on the bench toward the end.\n\nThe judge know he's a gamer but gave less-gaudy scores for smaller, technical issues.\n\n\"No doubt about it, it was a great routine. And you performed it well,\" said Inaba, who gave a 7 (along with each of the other judge). Inaba pointed out that Van Der Beek was \"out of sync\" with his partner and the two needed to \"match your movements.\"\n\nRemini gushed, \"You're a dancer, and you've been amazing the whole time.\n\nFinal score: 28/40\n\nHannah Brown and Alan Bersten got fierce on \"Dancing with the Stars.\" (Photo: Eric McCandless, ABC)\n\n'Bachelorette' Hannah Brown and pro Alan Bersten\n\nBrown said in the pre-tape interview that she was hurt by Inaba's comments last week comparing her constant smiling persona to a \"cheerleader.\" Brown vowed to \"unleash the beast,\" as Bersten looked to bring out \"anger and rage\" for their paso doble. His solution: Have Brown smash bottles with a stick. \"These are my ex-boyfriends,\" the \"Bachelorette\" said before hitting another.\n\nOn the dance floor, Brown wore a necklace that spelled \"Beast\" and a sheer body suit with a long black skirt. She smiled briefly and then swallowed the expression, going into hit man mode that lasted throughout the number.\n\nTonioli purred that \"the sexy beast is out of the cage, and is irresistible.\" But the judge pointed out that Brown tightened up at the end.\n\nInaba was unapologetic about her \"cheerleader\" comments. \"They were not meant to be hurtful. But comments worked,\" said Inaba, who gave an 8 score, which was matched by all the judges. \"I thought it was so passionate and delightful,\" she added.\n\nFinal score: 32/40\n\nFormer NBA star Lamar Odom and Peta Murgatroyd\n\n\"That's what I am good at, not quitting\" said Odom who has struggled with the dances and the judges all season. But he geared up to open up his sensitive side with a Viennese waltz. Odom put on the passion through, and spun Murgatroyd on the dance floor before holding her face close to his at the end. Murgatroyd was in tears by the end, saying, \"He's just trying so hard.\"\n\nRemini, too, was crying. \"I'm getting emotional, because I don't know if people know how hard you're working and hard this is for you,\" she said, giving the highest score, a 7.\n\nInaba said the dance \"touched my heart\" before giving a low 5. \"If the others have had to climb hills, you have had to climb mountains,\" said Goodman, who gave a 4. The low score had Remini almost leaving in protest. \"That's unacceptable,\" she said, as Tonioli gave a crazy sign with his finger.\n\nFinal score: 20/40\n\nSailor Brinkley-Cook and pro Valentin Chmerkovskiy\n\nBrinkley-Cook is starting to step up each week after being thrown into the dancing deep end, replacing her injured model mother, Christie Brinkley. During training, Chmerkovskiy brought his former partner, Rumer Willis (daughter of Demi Moore and Bruce Willis) for an inspirational talk with Brinkley-Cook. The model's cha-cha-cha to \"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\" was backed with confidence and style.\n\nGoodman called it \"another terrific performance; you have yourself on a roll. It was bright and lovely. It was terrific.\"\n\nTonioli said Brinkley-Cook's \"light is shining brighter every week. It's like seeing a new girl with every dance you do.\"\n\nFinal score: 31/40\n\nCountry singer Lauren Alaina and pro Gleb Savchenko\n\nAlaina has shown some racy moves and outfits in past episodes. But she went to her roots, wearing a flowing yellow dress and dancing a classy foxtrot to Dolly Parton's \"Jolene\" She pulled an intricate twirl that rolled like butter\n\nTonioli called it a \"a class foxtrot\" and Inaba proclaimed that Alaina has \"arrived.\" She received her first 8 scores, from each judge, which made the devout Christian proclaim, \"Praise the Lord.\"\n\nFinal score: 32/40\n\n'Queer Eye' culture expert Karamo and pro Jenna Johnson\n\nKaramo has been looking for a breakout week with sometimes absurdly low scores for his dances. \"I'm not taking it anymore, my scores are going up,\" he proclaimed before the dance. His dance to \"Old Town Road\" seemed to set it up.\n\nHe was dead-on charming and in command, even winking to the camera. But the scores did not drastically improve.\n\n\"You really turned the leading man attitude,\" said Tonioli. \"Full focus. There are no mistakes tonight.\"\n\nGoodman continued to pick, saying there were \"certain elements I liked, certain elements I didn't like.\" He still gave a slightly improved score of 7. The crowd and Remini let the judge have it..\n\nFinal score: 28/40\n\nSo what happened?\n\nTo the shock of everyone, Karamo and Johnson were in the dreaded bottom two. Not as surprising was Odom and Murgatroyd. Due to rule changes, the decision to save one couple was left to the judges. But there was little drama, as Inaba and Tonioli chose to save Karamo. NBA star Odom, on the night of his best dance, was sent home.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2019/10/08/bachelorette-hannah-brown-unleashes-her-rage-dwts-week-4-recap/3816019002/", "description": "You won't recognize Hannah Brown, who was literally, angrily smashing bottles to prepare for Week 4 of \"Dancing With the Stars.\" But who went home?", "authors": ["Bryan Alexander", "Published A.M.
