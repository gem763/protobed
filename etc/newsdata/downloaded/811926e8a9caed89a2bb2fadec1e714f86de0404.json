(Photo by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for MTV)\n\nAnimal rights groups have thanked Taylor Swift for cancelling her planned Melbourne Cup performance.\n\nThe Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses attributed the cancellation to the pressure Swift faced from animal rights activists.\n\nHowever, Victoria Racing Club and Mushroom Events said the cancellation was due to a scheduling conflict with Swift\u2019s promotional tour in Asia.\n\nAnimal rights groups are cheering after Taylor Swift cancelled her planned performance at this year\u2019s Melbourne Cup.\n\nSwift was scheduled to play two of her latest songs from her album Lover at the Flemington Racecourse on November 5. However, animal rights group, The Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses (CPR), called for Swift to say #NuptotheCup due to the number of horse deaths that have occurred following the annual race.\n\nThe group began a change.org petition to get Swift cancel her performance, which garnered 6,640 signatures.\n\n\u201cIf she cares at all about other animals the way she appears to care about cats, she will cancel her show and use her voice to make a strong statement that animal abuse is unacceptable and say #NupToTheCup,\u201d the petition description read.\n\nSwift cancelled her performance on Saturday.\n\nOn Saturday 21 September, Victoria Racing Club (VRC) and Mushroom Events released a statement saying Swift won\u2019t be able to perform at the Melbourne Cup due to a scheduling conflict with her promotional tour.\n\nMichael Gudinski from Mushroom Events said in a statement, \u201cRegrettably, Taylor is no longer able to make it to this year\u2019s Melbourne Cup. Changes to her Asian promo schedule have made it logistically impossible for her to be here. To all of Taylor\u2019s fans, we hope to see Taylor in Australia in 2020.\u201d\n\nWhile CPR praised the move \u2013 taking to Facebook to say thank you to Swift \u2013 it claimed the cancellation was due to the pressure put on the singer by activists.\n\nCPR Communications Director Kristin Leigh said in a statement, \u201cThe pressure on Taylor Swift to cancel her performance was significant. Her fans did not want to see her supporting animal abuse.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhilst the reason being used by the racing industry is a scheduling mix up, it appears to us that she has responded to those calls.\u201d\n\nLeigh added that Taylor would now \u201cbe much more aware of the cruel reality of horse racing than she was a few weeks ago\u201d. \u201cWe are confident she has made this decision based on her love for animals and are very grateful to her for her cancellation.\u201d\n\nPeople for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) also applauded Swift for her \u201ccompassionate decision\u201d to cancel her performance.\n\nPETA spokeswoman Emily Rice told Business Insider in an email, \u201cTaylor Swift dumped the Melbourne Cup, and PETA couldn\u2019t be happier.\n\n\u201cNone of this cruelty is consistent with the kind person we know Taylor to be.\u201d\n\nYES! @taylorswift13 just made the compassionate decision to CANCEL her #MelbourneCup performance. Thank you Taylor for choosing kindness over cruelty! pic.twitter.com/4uRw52ZIfg \u2014 PETA (@peta) September 21, 2019\n\nSome fans on social media applauded Swift\u2019s decision:\n\n@taylorswift13 thank you for pulling out of the Melbourne Cup and not bringing more attention to the abuse of horses for sport. #nuptothecup #melbournecup \u2014 Allana Allman (@AllanaIAm) September 21, 2019\n\nRespect to @taylorswift13 for pulling out of #MelbourneCup \u2013 horses dying for sport. \u2014 Victoria Madden (@sweetpotato12) September 21, 2019\n\nOther fans, however, were devastated after having spent money on flights and accommodation:\n\nJUST REALLY SAD RIGHT NOW AND NOT BECAUSE I ALREADY BOUGHT MY TICKETS, FLIGHTS & ACCOMMODATION FOR MELBOURNE BUT BECAUSE I WAS REALLY EXCITED TO SEE TAYLOR. I UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS HAPPEN.
