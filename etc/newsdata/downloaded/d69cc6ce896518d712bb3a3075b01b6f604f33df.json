Photo: Emilio Madrid\n\nThe highest compliment I can pay to Little Shop of Horrors, now bopping away at the Westside Theater, is that it feels like a high-school production. You might not think that\u2019s praise, considering its A-team cast members \u2014 all pitching hard with nobody saving his arm \u2014 and the uniformly high production values. Under Michael Mayer\u2019s direction, this Little Shop is glossy and plump, its Julian Crouch set tucked comfortably into its little Off Broadway stage. Yet the show\u2019s most charming quality is its feeling of having been put on for the hell of it. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to make money. It\u2019s a dream cast of consummate pros. But \u2014 and my eyes look like hearts while I type this \u2014 the infectious energy is pure amateur.\n\nThe story is familiar, since it\u2019s essentially Faust. The hapless Seymour Krelborn (Jonathan Groff) works for Mr. Mushnik (Tom Alan Robbins) in his terrible flower shop down on skid row. His flower-shop colleague and dream girl Audrey (Tammy Blanchard) is out of reach: She dates the abusive dentist Orin Scrivello (Christian Borle), sure that\u2019s all she deserves. One day, Seymour begins to tend a strange and unusual plant, a Venus flytrap-type monstrosity that he calls the Audrey II. The exotic brings attention; attention brings fame; fame brings money and love. But the plant only eats human flesh. \u201cFeed me, Seymour!\u201d as the old saying goes. And so Seymour lets himself be coaxed into a deal with the devil.\n\nIn 1980, Alan Menken and Howard Ashman decided to adapt Little Shop from Roger Corman\u2019s bananas 1960 B movie The Little Shop of Horrors, which Ashman had loved since he saw it on TV as a 14-year-old in Baltimore. \u201cLater,\u201d he said, \u201cI met tons of people who saw it when they were 14 or 15. I never met anyone who saw it as an adult.\u201d He and Menken, coming off an unsuccessful production, needed a pick-me-up, so they decided to indulge themselves with something purely fun. What could be cozier than a favorite cult movie, goofy as a dog in pants?\n\nCorman had shot in two days. Menken and Ashman, after they\u2019d decided on \u201960s kitsch pastiche, wrote the musical in two months. And when you watch Little Shop you can feel both the teenage enthusiasm and those initial flying rushes toward creation. The show is nearly indestructible: Even junior-high productions can\u2019t ruin it. Alan Menken\u2019s imitation Motown harmonies and yearning suspensions sit as easily on an unprepared voice as one that\u2019s won a Tony. So when you do lavish the show with marquee talents, it feels like superabundance.\n\nChristian Borle (who does indeed have Tonys, for Something Rotten! and Peter and the Starcatcher) is sort of the show mascot. He\u2019s a Chaos Generator through and through, popping up in tiny roles (a passerby, an NBC executive), and exploiting every opportunity for a laugh. Give him an inch, he\u2019ll steal the scene. But when he\u2019s given the scene, like the one with his song \u201cDentist\u201d \u2014 performed with the Greek chorus\u2013like Urchins (sometimes known as the Skid Row Supremes) \u2014 he devours it. His overscale Elvis-pompadour bobbling, he leaps up and down the stoops, or flops into the laps of Crystal (Salome Smith), Chiffon (Joy Woods), and Ronnette (Ari Groover). He tickles his nipple to draw our attention to the embroidery on his dentist\u2019s smock. And all due respect to the Audrey II puppets, each successive version of which is a plushy miracle (designed by Nicholas Mahon and operated by Eric Wright, Teddy Yudain, Kris Roberts and Chelsea Turbin), but the real Muppet onstage is Borle. He makes himself narrow and goggle-eyed like Beaker; he unhinges his jaw like Cookie Monster; he bounds onstage like Miss Piggy at a ball.\n\nGroff has to anchor the show, playing straight man to his crooked plant, so for the most part he does a tidily milquetoast performance, deliberately letting other voices and players dominate him. Suddenly, though, he\u2019ll open the sluice. At one point, provoked by Audrey II \u2014 the big growling plant (Kingsley Leggs) is really getting hungry \u2014 Seymour sings, \u201cI have so, so many strong reservations!\u201d and he swings through the Mushnik & Son flower shop\u2019s door. He steps out into an entirely new voice: twice as loud, twice as strong. You get a sense of what kind of power he\u2019s leashing.\n\nWhile Groff is intermittently keeping his light under a bushel, Tammy Blanchard is knocking her bushel over. The musical\u2019s original Audrey, Ellen Greene (who also played her in the 1986 movie and in a City Center revival in 2017) was a bottle rocket: tiny, powerful, darling. In contrast, Blanchard is big and broken, slurring her words like she\u2019s on Seconal, always stumbling slightly in her heels. Blanchard won an Emmy for playing Judy Garland, and here she fuses the Fay Wray\u2013stylings of Greene\u2019s Audrey to her own, sloppier, late-stage-Judy idea. Her mouth slides over the lyrics for her pleading ballad \u201cSomewhere That\u2019s Green,\u201d which cracks and loses pitch as her heart breaks. Every other thing in this production is a joke. I\u2019m almost positive that Borle is actively trying to get other actors to laugh. So what is this crushing portrait of twilight need and despair doing here? It\u2019s a brilliant performance, but it has a slight stubbornness about it. Whatever else is happening in her cartoon universe, Blanchard won\u2019t treat Audrey\u2019s subtext blithely \u2014 her black eyes really give her pain.\n\nThere\u2019s another not-very-hidden subtext in this show. On the one hand, Little Shop seems like icing on a cupcake \u2014 nothing could be sweeter. You leave humming. You sing around the house for days. But the show is also disturbing, and not only because of Audrey\u2019s bruises. Too often Little Shop\u2013lovers gloss over its racial critique, the deliberate association of alien invasion tropes with anti-black panic.\n\nThe central characters dream of white flight to the suburbs (\u201cgotta get outta here\u201d). Audrey II\u2019s voice has traditionally been a black man\u2019s \u2014 when casting the Four Tops\u2019 Levi Stubbs for the movie, Frank Oz said he wanted someone who \u201cwas real black, real street,\u201d who \u201chad a touch of malevolence but could be real silly and funny at the same time.\u201d Apart from the sheer yikes value of that statement, it\u2019s clear that the juxtaposition of that \u201cstreet\u201d voice with Seymour\u2019s quavering tone is at the heart of much of the show\u2019s humor and threat. Musically, too, the show links race to disruption. Menken and Ashman built the show out of spoofed mid-century musical styles: close-harmony Motown, Broadway cheese, doo-wop, tango, New Orleans funk. The black outsiders \u2014 Audrey II and the choral trio \u2014 tend to get the funk and the Motown; the central group sounds whiter. The choices are specific and pointed. Menken knew what he was about.\n\nSo should a production grapple with those issues? Mayer\u2019s version doesn\u2019t; it\u2019s on a nostalgia trip, interested in good vibes only. And certainly I adored this Little Shop, and I\u2019d recommend it to anyone who can get in. It offers a contact high from the sheer glee of the company, the way they seem to have done it for love, rather than whatever their Equity contracts have gotten them. It\u2019s so pure! But even if you push down your queasy thoughts about race during the effervescent proceedings, they might come bubbling out during the curtain call. With the whole cast lined up in front of you, it\u2019s harder to deny the weird way Little Shop has distributed its opportunities. Out come the Urchins, the three best voices in the show, blendable powerhouses that are basically the show\u2019s brass section \u2014 and you don\u2019t know their characters\u2019 names. And then came Kingsley Leggs, a.k.a. Audrey II. He was in his street clothes (no need for a costume), and he materialized rather shyly for his bow. But surely he\u2019s the star! We needed a little more time to applaud him.\n\nLittle Shop of Horrors is at the Westside Theater through January 19.", "description": "Review: Little Shop of Horrors With Jonathan Groff, Christian Borle,  Tammy Blanchard at the Westside Theater", "authors": ["Helen Shaw"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/17/17-little-shop-of-horrors.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
