Each week in the Urbanist, we take that wisdom one step further by seeking out not just locals but local experts \u2014 those who are especially well versed in their cities\u2019 newest and most noteworthy scenes \u2014 to give us insider recommendations. This week, we asked architectural and urban designer Paola Aguirre Serrano, founder of Borderless urban design studio and a visiting artist at School of the Art Institute of Chicago, for her picks in Illinois\u2019s largest city.\n\n\u201cChicago has an incredible (and complicated) history, but you can feel its ambitious future too. You have the \u2018big city\u2019 \u2014 skyscrapers, the financial district, the Loop (which is what locals call the downtown central business district) \u2014 and the \u2018hyperlocal neighborhood\u2019 feelings in very short distances. It\u2019s a common misconception that everything worth seeing is in the Loop. Each neighborhood is its own universe. I also love the relationship of the city and the water, where man-made meets nature. When architect and urban designer Daniel Burnham worked on the \u2018Plan of Chicago\u2019 in 1909, public space as civic space was a huge ambition. Today, Chicago\u2019s lakefront is 20 continuous miles of accessible public space. I love walking along the shoreline. My husband and I actually started a photography project about this called From the Shore to capture all 1,638 miles of Lake Michigan\u2019s shoreline.\u201d\n\nHer Other Musts\n\nH o t e l s The Palmer House Hilton. Photo: Izzet Keribar/Getty Images/Lonely Planet Image \u201cThe historic Palmer House Hilton (17 E. Monroe St.; 312-726-7500) is so classy and beautiful. It was one of the first hotels in the city and celebrated its 100th anniversary this year. What I love is the scale. It occupies an entire block. As an urbanist, I appreciate how projects and buildings interact with public spaces. I love that it\u2019s a massive hotel, but it doesn\u2019t feel that way. It\u2019s organized in a way that the hotel is flanked by independent retailers, like Merz Apothecary (17 E. Monroe St.; 312-781-6900), which is one of my favorite stores. It\u2019s a European-style boutique drug store. The hotel\u2019s lobby atrium is quite incredible with double-height ceilings, a marble double staircase, balconies, and a mezzanine level. The rooms follow the Classic Revival\u2013style architecture of the hotel with Art Deco interior design. You can walk to all destinations in the Loop from here. The Ambassador Hotel (1301 N. State Pkwy; 312-787-3700) in the Gold Coast neighborhood is one of Chicago\u2019s first boutique hotels where big stars like Frank Sinatra, Humphrey Bogart, and Marilyn Monroe used to stay. The hotel\u2019s opulent lobby and hallways contrast with its minimalist rooms. I like this part of the Gold Coast because the architecture of its townhomes is very delightful. And the lakefront is a ten-minute walk.\u201d\n\nR e s t a u r a n t s Girl and the Goat (top) and Avec. Photo: Courtesy of Girl and the Goat; Courtesy of Avec. Girl and the Goat (top) and Avec. Photo: Courtesy of Girl and the Goat; Courtesy of Avec. \u201cGirl and the Goat (809 W. Randolph St.; 312-492-6262) in the West Loop has great food and dining experience. Try the roasted cauliflower and the pig\u2019s face. I like that you can see the kitchen, it has an industrial feeling. Avec (615 W. Randolph St.; 312-377-2002) also in the West Loop is a super-small restaurant with a long, continuous communal wooden table. All the interiors are wooden. I love their chorizo-stuffed medjool dates. There\u2019s usually a wait at both of these, so make reservations in advance. Acadia (1639 S. Wabash Ave.; 312-360-9500) in the South Loop is a best-kept secret despite having two Michelin stars. The restaurant has a ten-course tasting menu, but I always eat at the bar. The bar menu is more affordable and delicious, with great cocktails. The oysters and burger are really good. The burger comes with bacon-onion jam, truffle mornay, and Gruy\u00e8re cheese. It is a local favorite.\u201d\n\nL o c a l F o o d \u201cWhen you\u2019re ordering a Chicago-style hot dog, keep this in mind: no ketchup, but there will be onions, peppers, and pickle. Jim\u2019s Original hot-dog stand (1250 S. Union Ave.), which sells the famous Maxwell Street Polish sausage, is great. People come from all over the city for this stand. You order from a window, and then you eat your hot dog standing. You can eat it in like four bites. It\u2019s so good. If there\u2019s a line at Jim\u2019s, Express Grill hot-dog stand (1260 S. Union Ave.) is right next to it, and also serves Maxwell Street Polish sausages. It\u2019s the exact same product. Even the sign looks the same as Jim\u2019s, yellow with red letters. Most of the flavor comes from the sausage anyway. Exchequer Restaurant & Pub (226 S. Wabash Ave.; 312-939-5633) in the Loop has the best deep dish. The Chicago one has Italian beef, sausage, onion, and hot giardiniera. The crust is better than other deep-dish pizzas in the city. It\u2019s crunchy but also flavorful.\u201d Photo: Google Maps\n\nC r a f t B e e r Maria\u2019s Packaged Goods and Community Bar (left) and the taproom at Marz Community Brewing.

Photo: Courtesy of Maria\u2019s Packaged Goods and Community Bar; Courtesy of Marz Community Brewing. \u201cWe\u2019re a beer town. There are so many craft breweries in Chicago: Half Acre, Revolution, Lagunitas, Low Rez, Alulu, but my favorite is Marz Community Brewing (3630 S. Iron St.; 773-579-1935) and its affiliated liquor store and bar, Maria\u2019s Packaged Goods and Community Bar (960 W. 31st St.; 773-890-0588), in Bridgeport. At Maria\u2019s, you walk into a small neighborhood store that carries hundreds of craft beers. If you keep walking, you find a door that leads to the bar. There\u2019s also a great little patio. Their beer selection is fantastic. My favorite is called Jungle Boogie, which is an American pale wheat beer that\u2019s very refreshing, crisp, and has just enough bitterness. You can also try one of their cocktails on tap if you are not feeling the beer, like Maria\u2019s Ginger Beer cocktails, made with locally brewed ginger beer.\u201d\n\nB o a t T o u r The docents aboard the Chicago Architecture Foundation Center River Cruise receive hundreds of hours of training about Chicago\u2019s architecture and its history. Photo: Courtesy of CAFC \u201cThe Chicago Architecture Foundation Center River Cruise is a must. It\u2019s the best $45 you can spend to see the city. A 90-minute tour on the Chicago River gives you a very good picture of the Loop. The docents of the CAFC are incredible. On the route, you\u2019ll see Marina City by Bertrand Goldberg (a.k.a. the corn cobs), the Merchandise Mart (the city\u2019s largest building, now full of design showrooms), the new towers on Wolf Point, the bridges at Michigan Avenue and Dearborn Street, the Carbon & Carbide building with the golden crown on top, the Wrigley Buildings, and the Tribune Tower. It\u2019s totally worth it.\u201d\n\nA t t r a c t i o n s a n d P u b l i c A r t Navy Pier. Photo: Courtesy of Navy Pier. Navy Pier. Photo: Courtesy of Navy Pier. \u201cMillennium Park is such a destination. Lurie Garden, which is beautiful and peaceful, and Crown Fountain, which is an interactive public art piece that\u2019s full of kids splashing water and laughing, are my favorite part of the park. Instead of going to the Willis Tower Skydeck, which is on the 103rd floor, go to the Signature Room (875 N. Michigan Ave.; 312-787-9596) on the 95th floor of the Hancock Tower for an evening drink. It\u2019s not as tall, but it\u2019s the same concept. You get up high and can see the city\u2019s grid. The Hancock Tower is highly underrated. I always go at night because you can see all the lights extend beyond the city and into the suburbs. After the renovation of Navy Pier, they added a few beer gardens that are quite enjoyable and relaxing in the summer months. My favorite one, Miller Lite Beer Garden, faces south, so you can see the lake and the skyline. It also has live music. You can take a long stroll along the pier and if you go there on Wednesday and Saturday evenings there are fireworks. The new Ferris wheel also has these larger enclosed pods that you can ride with a group. The Merchandise Mart (222 Merchandise Mart Plaza) has these incredible public art projections. They have this super-big projector on the Chicago Riverwalk, and they project animations and other moving images onto the fa\u00e7ade of the Merchandise Mart. It\u2019s called Art on the Mart and all the works are curated by the city.\u201d\n\nM u s e u m s a n d G a l l e r i e s Clockwise from top: The Modern Wing at the Art Institute, Chicago Art Department, and Comercio Popular.

Michigan Ave.) is a must, especially the architectural experience of the Modern Wing, which houses 20th- and 21st-century painting, sculpture, photography, architecture, and design. The Thorne Miniature Rooms in the basement level are a hidden asset. They have incredibly detailed diorama or architectural models of European and American interiors from different periods, like a New York parlor from the 1850s, that line a hallway behind a window. They\u2019re quite small, built on a scale of one inch to one foot, but you can see all the handmade curtains, furniture, paintings, sculptures, drapery. Many people miss them. The Pilsen neighborhood has a unique character. Every second Friday of the month, all galleries and studios open their doors in the evening. Go to Chicago Art Department (1932 S. Halsted St.), an independent art space in Pilsen. It\u2019s a huge, 15,000-square-foot building with three galleries, studio spaces, and community events hosted by artists. I\u2019ve been to art exhibitions, artist talks, pop-up markets, and fundraisers there. It\u2019s a really nice variety of programming. Comercio Popular (953 W. 18th St.) is a recent discovery. It\u2019s part gallery, part shop that\u2019s run by a local art collective bringing art and products from Mexican designers and makers. It\u2019s really beautiful. They keep the store really simple because they also hold receptions, art shows, performances, and talks there too. I went to a reception there recently, and it was nice to see the products, like clothing from Mexican fashion designer Cara Larga, become the backdrop.\u201d\n\nB e a c h e s Oak Street Beach. Photo: Massimo Borchi/Getty Images \u201cWe have amazing and distinct beaches. Oak Street Beach in Gold Coast gets really busy, and is one of the most visited. In the summer, the crowds are overwhelming, but if you go at the end of summer or early spring it\u2019s really nice. It has the most posh crowd. Because it\u2019s situated at the northern tip of Michigan Avenue, you not only have this great view of the downtown skyscrapers, but you also are walking distance to the Magnificent Mile. North Avenue Beach is super long and really active, miles of people playing games. I like the beaches on the South Side the best, especially 31st Street Beach and Oakwood Beach. They\u2019re quieter and have more of a neighborhood feeling. It\u2019s more family-oriented. On a good summer day, people will be out there starting at 8 a.m. with their own grills and barbecue all day. Also, every summer at Oakwood Beach there\u2019s an art exhibit called Sandbox Symphony with live music, interactive art, local films, and more.\u201d\n\nD a y T r i p s Inside Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s home and studio in Oak Park, Illinois, and outside Mies van der Rohe's Farnsworth House in Plano, Illinois.

Photo: Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation/Getty Images; Carol Highsmith/Getty Images. \u201cOak Park is considered the first suburb of Chicago. There, you can see many Frank Lloyd Wright architecture, including his home and studio (951 Chicago Ave.) and the Unity Temple, which is just three blocks away. (In Chicago, there are two historic Wright sites: the Robie House on the University of Chicago campus in Hyde Park and, in Rogers Park, the Bach House.) When you go to the studio-house, they give you a little pamphlet if you want to do a self-guided tour of the neighborhood\u2060 \u2014 there are lots of other nearby houses by Wright. (The Ernest Hemingway Birthplace Museum, 339 North Oak Park Avenue, is also right there.) I always have brunch at Lake Street Kitchen + Bar Restaurant (1101 Lake St.). The Farnsworth House (14520 River Rd.; 630-552-0052) is a little over an hour\u2019s drive in Plano, Illinois. You have to be an architecture nerd to want to go there. It\u2019s one of the most famous houses by architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and set such a precedent for modern architecture, a steel and glass house that\u2019s elevated from the ground. Milwaukee is also an easy trip from Chicago via Amtrak\u2019s Hiawatha Service, which drops you off right in Downtown Milwaukee, or an hour and a half drive. Be sure to check out the Historic Third Ward, Milwaukee Public Market (400 N. Water St.), and the Milwaukee Art Museum (700 N. Art Museum Dr.). There are a lot of historic buildings in the Historic Third Ward. The Public Market is really fun. It\u2019s a newer structure, a modern building with a warehouse feeling with different food vendors and artisan stands. The Milwaukee Art Museum is an architectural landmark, especially the Quadracci Pavilion by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. And they\u2019re all right next to each other on the Riverwalk District.\u201d", "description": "For a local\u2019s guide to Chicago, Illinois, urban designer Paola Aguirre Serrano shared her favorite things to do in the Windy City, including where to eat Polish sausages, see Frank Lloyd Wright houses, and experience the best architectural boat tour.", "authors": ["Trupti Rami"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/urbanist/2019/10/chicago/cac-tour.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
