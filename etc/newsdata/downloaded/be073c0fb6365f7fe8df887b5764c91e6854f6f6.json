Wow America, let\u2019s impeach your President (even though he did nothing wrong!).\u201d\n\nHis tweet came after the government reported the U.S. economy added 136,000 jobs in September, below forecast but enough for economists to call the labor market still relatively healthy. U.S. stocks SPX, +0.89% rose following the report.\n\nIn the latest development in the impeachment saga, text messages revealed that top U.S. diplomats encouraged Ukraine\u2019s newly elected president to conduct an investigation linked to Biden\u2019s family in return for a potentially high-profile visit to Washington with Trump.\n\nA call between Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky \u2014 in which Trump asked the leader to \u201clook into\u201d the Bidens \u2014 is at the heart of Democrats\u2019 impeachment probe.\n\nTrump has frequently denied wrongdoing in the matter. On Friday, he also said his stated request for China to probe the Bidens had no relation to a trade deal with Beijing. High-level talks are due to resume next week in Washington.\n\n\u201cOne has nothing to do with the other,\u201d Trump told reporters.\n\nSign up for Trump Today and more MarketWatch emails.", "description": "President Donald Trump on Friday invoked fresh data on unemployment to blast the impeachment effort against him, as it was revealed that U.S. diplomats...", "authors": ["Robert Schroeder", "White House Reporter"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HS636_19trum_ZG_20191003212840.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
