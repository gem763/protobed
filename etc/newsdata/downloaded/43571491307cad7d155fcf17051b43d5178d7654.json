Biden Jr. clung tightly to the legacy of the Obama administration in a Democratic primary debate on Thursday, asking voters to view him as a stand-in for the former president as an array of progressive challengers, led by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, brandished more daring policy promises and questioned Mr. Biden\u2019s political strength.\n\nFacing all of his closest competitors for the first time in a debate, Mr. Biden, the Democratic front-runner, repeatedly invoked President Barack Obama\u2019s name and policy record as a shield against rivals who suggested his own record was flawed, or implied his agenda lacked ambition. On health care, immigration, foreign wars and more, Mr. Biden\u2019s central theme was his tenure serving under Mr. Obama.\n\nBy constantly invoking Mr. Obama, a popular figure among Democrats, Mr. Biden sought to mute the ideological and generational divisions that have left him vulnerable in the primary race. To voters who might see him as a candidate of the past, Mr. Biden seemed to counter that the past was not so bad.\n\nIn an early exchange over health care, Mr. Biden referred to Ms. Warren\u2019s support for Mr. Sanders\u2019s \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan. \u201cThe senator says she\u2019s for Bernie,\u201d Mr. Biden said. \u201cWell, I\u2019m for Barack \u2014 I think the Obamacare worked.\u201d", "description": "The Democratic front-runner repeatedly invoked President Barack Obama\u2019s name, while some of his rivals said the party needed to move well beyond the policies of the last Democratic president.", "authors": ["Jonathan Martin", "Alexander Burns"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/12/us/politics/12debate-ledeall-top-new/12debate-ledeall-top-new-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
