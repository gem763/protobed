Could Elizabeth Warren selfies do the same?", "language": "en", "text": "\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren poses for a selfie at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines last month. (John Locher/AP)\n\nThey look nothing alike.\n\nFrederick Douglass \u2014 a black man campaigning for the abolition of slavery in the 1840s \u2014 appears alone in almost every photograph, staring down the camera in isolated, thoughtful splendor. Elizabeth Warren \u2014 a white woman campaigning for the presidency in 2019 \u2014 features today in countless iPhone photos and Instagram feeds, her arm around voter after voter, always bearing the same wide grin.\n\nThe two are separated by race, gender and more than 100 years of history that forged an America that would probably be unrecognizable to Douglass. Still, experts say, their use of photography collapses the distance: Douglass sat for scores of pictures to normalize the idea of black excellence and equality, and Warren\u2019s thousands of selfies with supporters could do the same for a female president.\n\n\u201cIt is cognitively harder for people to think about women in the role of political leader because we haven\u2019t seen a lot of women in political leadership,\u201d said Nichole Bauer, a professor of political communication at Louisiana State University. \u201cWith this selfie factory, she\u2019s normalizing that image \u2014 in the same vein that Douglass used photography.\u201d\n\n[Trump implied Frederick Douglass was alive. The abolitionist's family offered a 'history lesson.']\n\nDouglass, renowned statesman, abolitionist, orator and writer, was the most-photographed American of the 19th century, according to historians. Over the course of his career, he sat for more than 160 separate pictures, later reproduced millions of times and disseminated across the United States.\n\nAs Yale professor David Blight writes in his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, \u201cFrederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom,\u201d Douglass used the photos \u2014 in which he appeared elegantly dressed, his hair perfectly arranged \u2014 as \u201ca means of spreading influence.\u201d Douglass created \u201cfor a wide audience successive images of the intelligent, dignified black man,\u201d Blight argues, in a larger bid to convince the country that black inferiority was a racist myth.\n\nHe was up against more than myth. Born into slavery, Douglass taught himself to read and write (both forbidden activities), escaped enslavement at age 20 and forged a career as the most accomplished orator of America\u2019s abolition movement \u2014 and possibly in the entire country. He lived to see slavery abolished at the end of the Civil War but continued to fight against the country\u2019s racist and inhumane treatment of African Americans all his life.\n\nAlthough in a vastly different context, Warren is today confronting another harmful myth, experts said: that a woman is not presidential and does not belong in the Oval Office. Over the course of her campaign, she\u2019s developed a similar strategy to fight back. At the end of every rally, Warren \u2014 one of three front-runners in the Democratic race, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll \u2014 stays behind to pose for pictures with pretty much every supporter who asks.\n\nA Warren aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal statistics, said Tuesday that Warren has posed for nearly 60,000 selfies with supporters since launching her campaign. In a typical flurry Monday, Warren lingered for an extra four hours after giving a speech in New York to snap roughly 4,000 pictures with attendees, the aide said. The aide declined to comment beyond providing statistics.\n\n[Crowd size takes center stage in 2020 race as Warren event rivals Trump]\n\nWarren selfies are so in demand that her campaign has developed a sophisticated system to process would-be picture takers (a set up so complex it earned its own feature in the New York Times). Though other candidates are also taking selfies, Warren is doing it on a much greater scale than the rest of the field, and seems more focused on photography than any politician in recent memory, experts said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s presenting a public image of herself as somebody who is presidential,\u201d said Alexander Alberro, a Columbia professor who studies the history of photography. \u201cWhat Douglass tried to do was to create a public persona in the face of the negative type of image of African Americans at the time \u2026 so I think the comparison is really good.\u201d\n\nDouglass sat for his first photograph in 1841, near the start of his career.\n\nThough early forms of photography required subjects to remain motionless for hours, Douglass probably had to hold still only for a couple of minutes. The exposure time soon reduced even further: As Douglass\u2019s career advanced, so did the field of photography.\n\n\n\nAfrican-American social reformer, abolitionist and writer Frederick Douglass in one his numerous photographs. (AP)\n\nBecause of rapid-fire technological improvements, \u201cvirtually every Northerner could afford to have his or her portrait taken\u201d by the close of the 1840s, according to Harvard historian John Stauffer, who has written extensively on Douglass\u2019s use of photography. This was a boon for Douglass, who had fallen in love with the medium \u2014 which he dubbed a \u201cwonderful discovery and invention\u201d in an 1861 lecture.\n\n\u201cMen of all conditions may see themselves as others see them,\u201d Douglass wrote of photography. \u201cThe humblest servant girl, whose income is but a few shillings per week, may now possess a more perfect likeness of herself than noble ladies and even royalty \u2026 could purchase fifty years ago.\u201d\n\nOver the next several decades, the abolitionist disseminated his well-coiffed image as widely as possible. Douglass visited photographers\u2019 studios at every opportunity, placed photos of himself on the covers of his autobiographies and handed out small visiting cards stamped with his likeness everywhere he went.\n\nHe knew exactly what he was doing, Stauffer said.\n\n\u201cDouglass defined himself as a free man and citizen as much through his portraits as his words. He also believed in photography\u2019s power to convey truth,\u201d Stauffer wrote in a 2015 essay. \u201cThe truthful image represented abolitionists\u2019 greatest weapon, for it exposed slavery as a dehumanizing horror. Photographic portraits bore witness to blacks\u2019 essential humanity.\u201d\n\n[The day Frederick Douglass died]\n\nHe also saw the mere act of photography as a way to protest America\u2019s racist and unequal society, according to Robin Kelsey, a professor of the history of photography at Harvard. This was because Douglass viewed picture-taking as \u201cthe great equalizer,\u201d Kelsey said: Facing the impartial camera lens, everyone had to \u201cstand and perform their identity,\u201d no matter what that identity was.\n\n\u201cEveryone was in the same boat as a subject of photography,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cAnd these days, Elizabeth Warren is making use of the selfie to assert the same thing: That she\u2019s one of us, she is in the same boat as everyone else, she has to stand before the camera just like us.\"\n\nIf democratizing, Warren\u2019s selfies also assert a very specific identity, experts said \u2014 just as Douglass\u2019s photos did.\n\nFor one thing, the pictures suggest Warren\u2019s distance from wealthy donors, said Amanda Hunter, research and communications director for the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, which promotes women in politics.\n\nWhen Warren announced her presidential bid in February, she promised she would neither attend private fundraisers nor solicit funds from the mega-rich. Posing for photos with anyone who asks underscores that message and challenges \u201cthe stereotype of who gets access to a presidential candidate \u2014 it\u2019s not just the 1 percent anymore,\u201d Hunter said.\n\n\n\nWarren takes the stage before addressing supporters at a rally in New York on Monday. (Craig Ruttle/AP)\n\nIt also questions more fundamental gender-based stereotypes, Bauer said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s showing she\u2019s warm and thoughtful and interested in people through these really direct personal interactions and pictures,\u201d she said. \u201cIt overcomes that image that women in leadership roles are cold, they\u2019re unfeeling, they\u2019re not kind.\u201d\n\nThat could be especially important for former Harvard professor Warren, who will probably confront some voters\u2019 impression that she\u2019s too elite, a denizen of the Ivory Tower unable to understand most people\u2019s lives.\n\nDouglass\u2019s use of photography panned out pretty well in his lifetime. He achieved massive fame and lived to see the abolition of slavery in the United States \u2014 an achievement aided by Douglass\u2019s compelling rhetoric and larger-than-life persona, which he forged partly through photographs.\n\nIn \u201cthe long game of history, Douglass was extraordinarily successful,\u201d in part because of the photos, Kelsey said.\n\nWarren\u2019s photos \u2014 especially those in which she poses alongside young girls \u2014 are reshaping American perceptions of who can serve as president, experts said.\n\n[A woman who ran for president in 1872 was compared to Satan and locked up]\n\nEven if she loses, Bauer said, Warren has already accomplished something important. She\u2019s already left behind an influential legacy \u2014 captured in the thousands of smiling photos stored in thousands of iPhones across the nation.\n\n\u201cWe know individual interactions with female politicians and leaders can affect whether a young girl runs for political office,\u201d Bauer said. \u201cWhatever happens, Elizabeth Warren\u2019s million selfies are just a little bit more of a crack in that glass ceiling.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Hannah Natanson", "Reporter Covering Social Issues In The D.C.
