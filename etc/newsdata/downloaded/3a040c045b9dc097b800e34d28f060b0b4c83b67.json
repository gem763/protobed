Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) was burned.\n\n\u201cMine is the face of freedom,\u201d declares Elizabeth Heng, who lost a congressional bid in California last year, in the thirty-second spot. \u201cMy skin is not white. I\u2019m not outrageous, or racist, or a socialist. I\u2019m a Republican.\u201d\n\nThe ad is the product of New Faces GOP PAC, an independent expenditure political group created in March. The group has raised about $170,000 so far, largely from a number of five-figure individual and corporate donors in California.\n\nNew Faces GOP appears to be purely a Heng-related venture. Of the group\u2019s 22 publicly disclosed donors, Federal Election Commission records show that at least 13 of them also contributed to Heng\u2019s 2018 congressional campaign, which she lost to Rep. Jim Costa (D-CA) by 15 points.\n\nNew Faces GOP\u2019s treasurer also ran the finances of Heng\u2019s congressional campaign. The super PAC\u2019s top vendor, Strategic Perception, also produced ads for the campaign.\n\nHeng was widely viewed last year as a rising Republican star who could improve the party\u2019s prospects with racial and ethnic communities that have generally sided with Democrats. During her campaign, Heng stressed her Cambodian roots\u2014and her family\u2019s persecution at the hands of the country\u2019s brutal communist dictatorship before they fled to the United States.\n\nIn September 2018, a Wall Street Journal columnist even suggested that Heng could be \u201can Ocasio-Cortez for the GOP.\u201d\n\nIt appears that Heng is eager to elevate that analogy. Thursday\u2019s ad featured an image of Ocasio-Cortez that burns out from the center, imagery that quickly drew a comment from the congresswoman. \u201cRepublicans are running TV ads setting pictures of me on fire to convince people they aren\u2019t racist,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cLife is weird!\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you really calling me a racist @AOC?\u201d Heng shot back. \u201cI\u2019m calling all Democrats out for supporting an evil ideology. Or are you just in Congress to hang out with celebrities and tweet out ridiculous ideas like the green new deal?\u201d\n\nThe ad appears to be New Faces GOP\u2019s effective public unveiling. Though it was officially formed in March, the group\u2019s website was created two months later. Most of the files stored on the site were uploaded or created this month.", "description": "The group, New Faces GOP PAC, appears to be a project of Elizabeth Heng, a former congressional candidate who has been hailed as the Republicans\u2019 Ocasio-Cortez.", "authors": ["Lachlan Markay"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568342254/190912-Markay-NewFacesPac-tease_kx4s4w", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
