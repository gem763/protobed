PG&E, which filed for bankruptcy in January after last year's North Bay and Camp Fires, cut off power for hundreds of thousands of Bay Area residents, citing the fire risks associated with high winds and dry weather.\n\nThough most tech companies weren't directly affected, local schools shut down and cities enacted curfews as early at 7 p.m. Surrounded by companies working on alternative energy sources and touting their resourcefulness, the irony was rich, but it was no laughing matter, especially for residents who rely on electric medical devices.", "description": "Much of the Bay Area lost power, a big crypto project lost its mojo and big companies lost the meaning of free speech.", "authors": ["Jennifer Elias"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105074018-GettyImages-669889778.jpg?v=1570829866", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
