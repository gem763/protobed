(AP) - After earning its first NCAA Tournament invitation in a decade one year ago, Mississippi State returns a veteran lineup as it chases a second straight bid.\n\nThe Bulldogs finished 23-11 last season and posted a 10-8 mark in the SEC, good enough for a sixth-place showing in the league and a No. 5 seed in the NCAA Tournament.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited about this year,\u201d Mississippi State coach Ben Howland said. \u201cI think we have a very good nucleus returning from last year\u2019s NCAA Tournament team. Our players had a tremendous summer.\u201d\n\nHeadlining that nucleus is sophomore forward Reggie Perry. The preseason all-SEC selection averaged 9.7 points and a team-best 7.2 rebounds a year ago. Perry originally declared for the NBA draft but opted to return to school for his sophomore season.\n\nOther key returners include senior guard Tyson Carter, junior point guard Nick Weatherspoon and junior center Abdul Ado. Sophomore Robert Woodard was productive off the bench last season and enters the starting lineup this season at small forward.\n\nCarter is the team\u2019s leading returning scorer after averaging 10.4 points a year ago.\n\n\u201cTyson is poised to have his best year as a Bulldog going into his senior season,\u201d Howland said. \u201cHe\u2019s so much quicker and stronger than he was. He\u2019s playing with a lot of confidence.\u201d\n\nMississippi State does have some holes to fill.\n\nQuinndary Weatherspoon, who had a team-high 18.5 points per game last season, was drafted by San Antonio in the second round. The Bulldogs also must replace Lamar Peters at point guard and forward Aric Holman.\n\n\u201cWe lost a lot a lot on the offensive end,\u201d Howland said. \u201cBut I think we have a number of guys who can get their own.\u201d\n\nSome other things to know heading to Mississippi State\u2019s 2019-20 season:\n\nWEATHERSPOON SUSPENSION CONTINUES\n\nJunior point guard Nick Weatherspoon was suspended for Mississippi State\u2019s final 10 games of the 2018-19 season due to what school officials described as a violation of team rules.\n\nThat suspension will carry over to this season. Weatherspoon, the younger brother of former MSU standout Quinndary Weatherspoon, will have to sit the first 10 games of the season to conclude his penalties. His season debut is expected to be against New Mexico State on Dec 22.\n\nWhile Weatherspoon serves the remainder of his suspension, Carter is expected to be the starting point guard for the first 10 games of the season.\n\nSUCCESSFUL OFFSEASON FOR PERRY\n\nPerry already has reeled in several preseason honors and is coming off an impressive summer. Perry was tabbed preseason first-team All-SEC by the league\u2019s media, joining Erick Dampier as the school\u2019s only sophomores ever to earn that honor.\n\nPerry played with the Team USA U19 squad in the 2019 FIBA World Cup this summer. He averaged 13.1 points in that event to earn MVP honors and help lead Team USA to the gold medal.\n\nREDSHIRTS ENTER MIX\n\nA couple of players who redshirted last season should make impacts this year.\n\nDJ Stewart is expected to be a starter at shooting guard to open the season. Stewart likely will move to a reserve role when Nick Weatherspoon enters the lineup.\n\nSophomore center/forward Prince Oduro redshirted last year after transferring from Siena. Oduro is expected to be the primary backup to Ado.\n\nThe Bulldogs also have four true freshmen on the roster this season, led by guard Iverson Molinar.\n\nTRIO OF LEGACY STARTERS\n\nCarter, Perry and Woodard all have fathers who played at Mississippi State.\n\nCarter is the son of former all-SEC standout Greg Carter, who helped lead Mississippi State to the 1991 SEC championship. Robert Woodard Sr. played for the Bulldogs in the mid-80s. Perry is the son of Al Perry, who once recorded 17 assists in a game, which remains the school\u2019s single-game record.\n\nNONCONFERENCE CHALLENGES\n\nThe Bulldogs will have a few tests before entering SEC action this season, and there will be plenty of battles within conference play alone.\n\nMississippi State faces Kansas State in New Jersey on Dec. 14 and visits Oklahoma in January as part of the SEC/Big 12 Challenge. Mississippi State also faces New Mexico State in Jackson, Mississippi, on Dec. 22. New Mexico State, Kansas State and Oklahoma all reached the NCAA Tournament last year.\n\nMississippi State also will participate in the Myrtle Beach Invitational in Conway, South Carolina, an event that features possible matchups with No. 10 Villanova and Utah. The Bulldogs open the 2019-20 campaign at home against Florida International on Nov. 5.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "After earning its first NCAA Tournament invitation in a decade one year ago, Mississippi State returns a veteran lineup as it chases a second straight bid.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Paul Jones"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/24/sec_media_day_basketball_22253_c0-170-4621-2865_s1200x700.jpg?ca57e82001db955cba0245b6a56e217945de7cbe", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
