Few, including the Patriots (who eventually took him in round six), did.\n\nAnd so it\u2019s refreshing when someone who was in the business of evaluating players at the time Brady emerged from Michigan admits to getting it wrong.\n\nFormer Packers G.M. Ron Wolf has done just that, in comments to Bob McGinn of TheAthletic.com. McGinn looks back at the input he received on scouts regarding Brady prior to the 2000 draft, as supplemented by more recent comments from folks like Wolf.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nWolf, whose Packers had Brett Favre, Matt Hasselbeck, and Aaron Brooks at the time, had a habit of drafting quarterbacks in most years of the draft. But Wolf passed on Brady, multiple times.\n\n\u201cSh-t, yeah, I would have [taken Brady],\u201d Wolf admitted to McGinn. \u201cHad I known this guy was who he was. . . .\u201d\n\nUnlike fellow Hall of Famer Bill Polian, who has claimed that he had a first-round grade on Brady, Wolf doesn\u2019t try to sugarcoat the fact that he, like so many others, stepped in the first word from his quote to McGinn.\n\n\u201cWe kind of deviated just a tad from our normal procedure,\u201d Wolf said regarding the 2000 draft. \u201cYou know, whenever one changes something, it jumps up and bites you in the ass. I still think about that. It\u2019s one of those things, you\u2019re never too old to learn. I\u2019m not sure why I didn\u2019t nip it in the bud.\u201d\n\nWolf didn\u2019t see Brady play in person, and he relied on three of his scouts. All of them said no to Brady.\n\nStory continues\n\n\u201cI just know that we really just did a terrible job as an organization on Tom Brady,\u201d Wolf told McGinn. \u201cIt was a joke, the reports we had on him. A disgrace. We had three reports, and three guys said he couldn\u2019t play. We could talk about this for five hours. Whatever they said was completely wrong. . . .\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how you could go to a Big Ten school like that and watch a guy play and his career as it unfolded and think he couldn\u2019t play. You say to yourself, \u2018I\u2019ll never listen to this [bleep] again the rest of my life.'\u201d (And, yes, the first dropping of the \u2018S\u2019 bomb made it past the censors at TheAthletic.com, but the second one didn\u2019t.)\n\nAn unnamed personnel executive responded to Wolf\u2019s observations with this: \u201cEasy to blame the scouts, but the general consensus was that Tom was a free agent.\u201d\n\nEven if Wolf is blaming the scouts, Wolf hired them. It was his operation. If his scouts failed to spot Brady as a potentially great player, then Wolf failed to spot Brady as a potentially great player. Like everyone else did.\n\nExcept for Polian, of course.", "description": "As the legend of Tom Brady somehow continues to grow, plenty of people have tried to say they saw it coming.
