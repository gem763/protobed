(Picture: Wild and Wonderful Photography)\n\nOrion Metheny and Kaylee Schmidt (now Schmidt-Metheny) pretty much have the perfect all-American love story, meeting in their teenage years at their church\u2019s youth group.\n\n\u2018I was 15 (almost 16) and she was 17 (almost 18),\u2019 says Orion.\n\n\u2018We spent a few years long distance as she went to college in Nashville, Tennessee. I graduated high school and went to college in our home town of Morgantown, West Virginia. After graduating, she moved back.\n\n\u2018We got engaged on our four-year anniversary and dated almost 5 and a half years total before getting married.\u2019\n\nThe adorable couple even waited to move in together, with Orion living in the house that\u2019s now theirs alone in the run-up to their wedding. But there was just one thing that hadn\u2019t yet fallen into place.\n\nAlthough Kaylee was excited about spending the rest of her life with Orion, she knew would miss her parents\u2019 cat Nala when she left the family home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe was desperate for a cat, but Orion had never had a pet before.\n\nKaylee has always been a cat lover (Picture: Wild and Wonderful Photography)\n\nIn a now-viral post, their wedding photographer Megan O\u2019Dell detailed what happened next. She was in on the secret the whole time, as Orion planned to get Kaylee a rescue kitten and do the big reveal on their wedding day, surprising her with a furry new family member.\n\n\u2018While Orion wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of indoor pets, Kaylee was an avid cat lover and couldn\u2019t imagine leaving her family cat when she moved to her new home with Orion,\u2019 wrote Megan.\n\n\u2018Orion had a change of heart and went to go adopt a new kitten at the shelter to surprise her with at the wedding, because she would definitely not be expecting it!\n\nWhen the shelter turned him down because he mentioned give it as a wedding present, it was fate that two abandoned kittens were found near his home.\u2019\n\nLittle Chloe is enjoying her forever home (Picture: Wild and Wonderful Photography)\n\nOrion explains: \u2018Kaylee didn\u2019t move in until after the wedding. And we are renting. So it wasn\u2019t that we couldn\u2019t get a kitten, but I needed to make sure that we had the best environment to bring it home to.\u2019\n\n\u2018If it\u2019s something that will bring Kaylee joy and give an animal a loving home then I thought it seemed like a win-win.\u2019\n\nHis 92-year-old grandma Jean helped him, housing the new kitten \u2013 named Chloe \u2013 until it was time for her to go to her forever home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen the big reveal happened, Kaylee\u2019s face was absolutely priceless, and even through still images you can basically hear her saying \u2018do I get to keep it?!\u2019\n\nEDIT: WOW!! You guys, we are totally blown away by the response of this sweet post!!!! <3Just to clear up a few\u2026 Geplaatst door Wild and Wonderful Photography op Maandag 21 oktober 2019\n\nMegan photographed the moment, capturing both Orion and Kaylee absolutely beaming \u2013 and eventually shedding a happy tear.\n\nThey had a wonderful wedding day, and according to Orion, Chloe is \u2018super playful and loves to play with her toys. But she\u2019s also very cuddly and likes to nap while you hold her and pet her.\u2019\n\n\u2018We are giving Chloe all the love and attention,\u2019 he continues.\n\nThe new husband also wanted to clear up that the other rescue cat who was found has a loving home.\n\n\u2018The second kitten found a home! I\u2019d asked around if anyone had any kittens that needed homes,\u2019 he confirmed.\n\n\u2018A family had rescued both kittens but was only able to keep one. So that\u2019s why I only adopted Chloe. I didn\u2019t just leave the second kitten as people seem to be worried about. That\u2019s not my heart to do something like that.\u2019\n\nPlus, he says, \u2018Chloe seems to be adjusting great by herself! So no kitties were abandoned in any way during our story!\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNope, just a brand new fur baby, and some absolutely cracking wedding photos.\n\nMORE: Mum shares trick to keep avocados green and ready to eat year-round\n\nMORE: How I Save: The 28-year-old senior marketing executive in Manchester with \u00a316,750 saved\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Orion surprised his new wife Kaylee with something a little different on their wedding day - a new kitten called Chloe.", "authors": ["Jessica Lindsay"], "top_image": "https://i1.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/PRC_91558757_1571921985.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
