It is a signatory to tough U.N. sanctions on Pyongyang over its past nuclear and missile testing, but has urged the United States to adopt an approach more conducive to dialogue and suggested that sanctions relief be considered.", "description": "The senior U.S. defense official for Asia said on Tuesday the United States wants China to improve its enforcement of sanctions on North Korea and take other steps to press Pyongyang to be more constructive in talks with the United States.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
