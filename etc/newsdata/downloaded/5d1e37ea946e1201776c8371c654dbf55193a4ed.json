October top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 3/11 9. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 4/11 8. Gennady Golovkin (39-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. The boxing legend is now a two-time world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 6/11 6. Errol Spence (26-0-0) Spence beat Shawn Porter to unify the welterweight division as he goes in search of more belts. Danny Garcia looks set to be next. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (16-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion moves up in weight. He faces Chazz Witherspoon on his heavyweight debut. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

Getty Images\n\n\u201cWe will go straight into sparring. He is tall like Price and I am short like Ruiz\n\n\u201cI will just be going in and out, no staying in Sheffield in hotels, that\u2019s why my manager David Haye is here to organise, in and out.\u201d\n\nChisora and Joshua are both graduates of the famed Finchley ABC in north London but they have never crossed paths in the ring.\n\nNow Haye believes the pair can help each other out as they prepare for two very distinct styles.\n\nHaye said: \u201cFor both of their respective fights they are ideal sparring partners, no one could mimic Ruiz\u2019s relentless come-forward pressure like Derek.\n\n\u201cAnd if anyone can reproduce Price\u2019s long-range jab and move style, which AJ will need to adopt to win the rematch, it is Del.\n\n\u201cDerek is in shape and blasted 10 rounds out on Thursday, even if he just gets six to eight rounds with AJ done, it will be good preparation for him and for AJ.\u201d\n\nDespite being managed by Haye, Zimbabwe-born Chisora is currently training himself after an amicable split with former coach Dave Coldwell before this camp started.\n\nHe has also had to deal with a change of opponent after first choice Joseph Parker was forced to withdraw due to a spider bite.\n\nEven so, Chisora has revealed that he is planning to corner himself on fight night against Price.\n\nHe added: \u201cTo be honest with you, I\u2019ll be doing my own corner. David said I have to get a coach but, nah, I don\u2019t want a coach.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been boxing for years, I know how to train myself, just write the programme and follow it myself.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now and that\u2019s what we will be doing on fight night.\u201d", "description": "Dereck Chisora\u00a0has revealed that he will travel to Sheffield next week\u00a0in order to spar former world heavyweight champion and fellow Brit\u00a0Anthony Joshua.
