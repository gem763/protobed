More than 100mm (4in) of rain also fell in less than 24 hours.\n\nWhile the intensity of the storm was nothing like the category 5 hurricane that devastated the Bahamas last week, the widespread damage nonetheless left emergency crews scrambling throughout the collection of Maritime provinces.\n\n\u201cThis is an exercise of days, not hours,\u201d Karen Hutt, CEO of Nova Scotia Power, told reporters on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019re operating in our worst-case scenario.\u201d\n\nPower technicians from Ontario, Quebec, Maine \u2013 and as far away as Florida \u2013 were dispatched to assist local crews restore power. The Canadian military also deployed forces to help clear roads.\n\nBy Monday, as power was restored in some areas, residents were left to assess damage. Many of the streets in Halifax, the largest city on the east coast, had large trees uprooted, tearing up sidewalks and roads and pulling down power lines. At least 200,000 remained without electricity in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador.\n\nLong lines outside fast-food restaurants \u2013 including the coffee chain Tim Hortons \u2013 blocked emergency vehicle routes, prompting city officials to request residents stay at home.\n\nBrett Ruskin (@Brett_CBC) Post-hurricane Tim Hortons lineup in Halifax, Nova Scotia pic.twitter.com/7FveuuHqjk\n\n\u201cPeople need to stay off the roads today. Let us get out there and do our jobs,\u201d Erica Fleck, an assistant chief with Halifax Regional Fire and Emergency, told reporters on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t clear [the roads] until we can actually get to the roads, and 300 cars at a drive-thru right now is really stopping our progress.\u201d\n\nThe Nova Scotia premier, Stephen McNeil, also chastised residents for blocking traffic. \u201cThere\u2019ll be plenty of time for you to come down and get your coffee. You don\u2019t have to do that today. It\u2019s important to allow the level of professionals we have in this province go out and do their work,\u201d he said at a weekend press conference.\n\nPublic schools were closed throughout the region on Monday as crews worked to saw through trees and repair downed electrical lines, hopeful that power would be fully restored later this week.", "description": "Post-tropical storm lashes Maritime provinces, with high winds and torrential rains cut power and cellphone service", "authors": ["Leyland Cecco"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89eca75c98bd18d2aebd8777a983d91caf9c7be3/0_310_3510_2106/master/3510.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9e05b479ed600f3526995afea0f7ce99", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
