Brexit negotiations are dominating British politics and without a majority in the Commons, Johnson has little chance of seeing many of his measures passed into law.\n\nWith that in mind, he is focusing on a push for an early general election -- and Monday\u2019s policy package is likely to form the skeleton of his manifesto for that campaign, which could begin within weeks.\n\nThe Queen\u2019s Speech, delivered during the State Opening of Parliament, lets the government highlight its priorities.\n\nThis speech, Johnson\u2019s first as prime minister, includes a proposal to raise the National Living Wage to 10.50 pounds ($13.25) per hour and is a chance to woo voters ahead of a possible general election.\n\nThe administration will set out a range of legislation aimed at strengthening public confidence in law and order alongside the recruitment of 20,000 police officers, including plans to increase minimum sentences for the most violent and sexual offenders, and create a new legal definition of domestic abuse, recognizing that it can be economic, emotional and coercive as well as physical.\n\nThe government will also outline its aim to introduce tougher penalties for foreign nationals who attempt to return to the U.K. and new measures to speed up the arrest of fugitives sought by Interpol.", "description": "U.K.'s Johnson Outlines His Election Offer in Queen's Speech", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picab97de33a91cf4dcf682ae6a4bbe97ff.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
