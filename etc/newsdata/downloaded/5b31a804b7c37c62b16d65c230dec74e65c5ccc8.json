It also recommends alternative games for those who wish to participate in boycotts.\n\nThe conflict between gamers and developers largely ignited after Activision Blizzard, the maker of games such as Overwatch, Diablo, and World of Warcraft, suspended a professional Hearthstone player from Hong Kong. Chung \u201cBlitzchung\u201d Ng Wai appeared in a gas mask on a Taiwanese cast and called for the liberation of his city.\n\nActivists are recommending players ditch Blizzard titles and pick up those made by developers such as Immutable, which has expressed support for gamers\u2019 free expression, including those wishing to support Hong Kongers. (Screenshot: Fight for the Future)\n\nBlizzard\u2019s response has drawn criticism from gamers across the globe. Citing a vaguely worded policy against conduct that brings players \u201cinto public disrepute\u201d or otherwise \u201cdamages Blizzard\u2019s image,\u201d the company removed Blitzchung from the Asia-Pacific Grandmasters competition and rescinded his prize money, the equivalent of roughly $US10,000 ($14,788).\n\nThe fallout was swift. As #BoycottBlizzard trended worldwide on Twitter, collectible game card legend and Hearthstone commentator Brian Kibler issued a statement calling Blizzard\u2019s response \u201cincredibly harsh\u201d and announcing he would no longer be involved with the Grandmasters competition.\n\n\u201cThe heavy-handedness of it feels like someone insisted that Blizzard make an example of Blitzchung, not only to discourage others from similar acts in the future but also to appease those upset by the outburst itself,\u201d Kibler wrote.\n\nMy photoshops are nothing if not both lazy and fast, but still.#HongKongProtest #Blizzardboycott pic.twitter.com/nsE1VWl0e3 \u2014 Kaipo (@Kaipo_Rozwolf) October 8, 2019\n\nAs Polygon first reported, other gamers decided to punish Blizzard by attempting to get one of its products banned in China: They turned the Overwatch character Mei-Ling Zhou, who is from Xi\u2019an, China, into a pro-Democracy meme that quickly went viral. A small group of Blizzard employees also staged a walk-out at the company\u2019s Irvine, California, headquarters on Wednesday, per the Daily Beast.\n\nAround 12 per cent, or $US173 ($256) million, of Blizzard\u2019s second-quarter earnings came from the Asia Pacific region, according to figures released by the company.\n\n\u201cBlizzard has engaged in blatant censorship, and should act immediately to revoke its ban of Ng Wai Chung, restore his tournament winnings, and repair its relationships with the livestream casters,\u201d said Dayton Young, product director at Fight for the Future. \u201cNo gamers should be punished for expressing their views on politics and human rights. And no game company should ever ban or penalise players for advocating for their own political freedom.\u201d\n\nAdded Young: \u201cGamers deserve to know which companies are willing to engage in censorship on behalf of authoritarian regimes and which companies will defend basic freedom of expression, so we\u2019re calling on all game developers and publishers to make a public commitment to support the rights of their customers, employees, and fans.\u201d\n\nThe Hong Kong protests, which have grown increasingly violent in recent weeks, were triggered in March by a proposed law to extradite people to mainland China and Taiwan. The demonstrations were estimated last month at around 1.7 million strong and have swelled amid allegations of Hong Kong Police Force misconduct. Economic and social inequality are also a driving force.", "description": "A leading U.S. digital rights organisation is joining the battle against top video game companies that might seek to censor gamers for expressing support for Hong Kongers who\u2019ve been protesting Chinese influence over the past 27 weeks....", "authors": ["Victoria Song", "Charles Pulliam-Moore"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/uq1ulgocjxhaggravqwi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
