The movie hits theaters this October. USA TODAY\n\nLOS ANGELES \u2013 The filmmakers and studio behind \"Joker\" have reason to put on a happy face. Despite concerns over its violent themes and ramped-up theater security, audiences flocked to the multiplex to check out the R-rated film this weekend, resulting in a record October opening.\n\nWarner Bros. said Sunday that \"Joker\" grossed an estimated $93.5 million in ticket sales from nearly 4,400 screens in North America. The previous October record-holder was the Spider-Man spinoff \"Venom,\" which opened to $80 million last year. Internationally, \"Joker\" earned $140.5 million from 73 markets, resulting in a stunning $234 million global debut.\n\n\"This was a much larger result at the box office than we had ever anticipated globally,\" says Jeff Goldstein, the studio's president of domestic distribution. \"We're just thrilled that audiences are embracing the movie as strong as they are.\"\n\nSpoilers!

The film from director and co-writer Todd Phillips was always seen as a gamble with one of the studio's most valuable pieces of intellectual property, hence its modest (for a comic-book film) $55 million budget.\n\nBut in the weeks leading up to its release, hype and uneasiness intensified beyond how audiences would react to placing this character in a realistic and unambiguously adult setting with \"Taxi Driver\" undertones. Responding to anxiety that the film might have the potential to inspire violence, theater chains banned costumes or reaffirmed earlier policies regarding masks, and authorities in numerous cities said they were stepping up police patrols around theaters. Some relatives of the 2012 Aurora movie theater shooting even asked Warner Bros. to commit to gun control causes. (The studio said it always has.)\n\nSpoilers! Joaquin Phoenix's 'Joker' has definite Batman leanings, and that's a bad thing\n\nRudy Giuliani as Joker? A Ferris Bueller-esque Mike Pompeo? It's all in 'SNL's opening skit\n\nThough some worried the attention would affect the box office, it did not ultimately dissuade audiences from turning out opening weekend; the box office surpassed industry expectations and may rise even higher when final numbers are reported Monday. Although the film got a B-plus CinemaScore grade from opening night audiences, the studio is optimistic about its long-term playability.\n\n\"Sixty-six percent of the audience was under the age of 35,\" Goldstein says. \"That tells you that the audience will expand out with that younger group as time goes on.\" The younger audience also gave the film a more favorable A-minus on CinemaScore.\n\nPaul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for box-office tracker Comscore, says the convergence of critical acclaim and controversy actually helped the film become bigger than expected.\n\n\"It's the ultimate water-cooler movie right now,\" Dergarabedian says.\n\nHe added that it was important that \"Joker\" was always marketed as a \"very dark, R-rated film.\"\n\n\"It always had an element of mystery and danger surrounding it,\" Dergarabedian says. \"If it were a G-rated film, controversy like this would not be a good thing.\"\n\nIn the landscape of R-rated comic book films, \"Joker\" is nestled between \"Deadpool\" and its sequel, both of which opened with more than $125 million, and \"Logan,\" which launched with $88.4 million.\n\n\"Joker\" was the only new wide release this weekend, which is down from last year when both \"Venom\" and \"A Star Is Born\" opened.\n\nReview: Joaquin Phoenix's 'Joker' questions if there's empathy for the devil\n\n'It's shaky ground as an actor': Joaquin Phoenix charts unpredictable path as 'Joker'\n\nHoldovers populated the remaining top spots. The more family-friendly \"Abominable\" landed in second place with $12 million in its second weekend, and \"Downton Abbey\" took third in its third weekend with $8 million. Rounding out the top five: Jennifer Lopez's stripper movie \"Hustlers\" finished fourth with $6.3 million, while the Stephen King sequel \"It: Chapter Two\" was fifth with $5.4 million.\n\nWith awards buzz behind it, the Judy Garland biopic \"Judy,\" starring Renee Zellweger, added nearly 1,000 screens this weekend and placed seventh with $4.5 million from nearly 1,500 locations.\n\nAnd in limited release, Pedro Almod\u00f3var's critically acclaimed \"Pain and Glory\" launched on four screens to a solid $160,000. Less fortunate was the Natalie Portman-led astronaut drama \"Lucy in the Sky\" which earned only $55,000 from 37 theaters resulting in a dismal $1,500 per screen average.\n\nFinal numbers are expected Monday.\n\nContributing: Kim Willis, USA TODAY\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/06/joker-gets-last-laugh-sets-october-box-office-record/3891149002/", "description": "Joaquin Phoenix's 'Joker' had many reasons to put on a happy face: The movie's violence and worries of copycats didn't keep fans away from theaters.", "authors": ["Lindsey Bahr", "The Associated Press", "Published P.M.
