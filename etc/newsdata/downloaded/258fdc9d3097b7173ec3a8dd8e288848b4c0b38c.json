It wasn't really on Earth, and my character is on Earth.\"\n\nRagnarok -- the third film in Thor's standalone series within the MCU -- largely took place on the violent, distant planet of Sakaar, and Thor's homeworld of Asgard. It was the first Thor film to be helmed by director Taika Waititi, who has also been tasked with overseeing the upcoming Love and Thunder.\n\nThe film will see Jane Foster take on the powers of Thor, and to announce the casting, Portman appeared during the Marvel panel at SDCC in July, where she held Thor's mighty hammer in the air to the delight of the fans.\n\nPortman told ET she's looking forward to working with Waititi and \"I love Tessa [Thompson] and Chris [Hemsworth] so much, so it's exciting to work with them again.\"\n\n\"And I'm very excited to wield the hammer,\" she added with a smile.\n\nAs for her upcoming performance in Lucy in the Sky -- in which she plays an astronaut who returns home from a long trip into space, sparks a romance with a fellow astronaut, and begins to lose touch with reality and her sanity -- Portman explained how it felt to work with Reese Witherspoon, who produced and shepherded the project.\n\n\"Reese was very involved, she helped develop the script so I am very grateful to her for helping create this character and working on details of it with [director] Noah [Hawley] during the development\u2026 it was so lucky,\" Portman said of Witherspoon, who was originally slated to star in the project before she decided to step back behind the scenes and hand the reins over.\n\n\"She's such a powerhouse,\" Portman added. \"She's producing and making work for a lot of us, so I'm very grateful and it was really lucky to get to have a friend to get to call up and be like, 'What do you think about this? What's your take on this? Why did you choose this?' It was very lucky to have her insight.\"\n\nLucy in the Sky rockets into theaters Oct. 4. Thor: Love and Thunder is slated for release in November 2021.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nTaika Waititi on 'Thor 4' and Bringing Back Natalie Portman (Exclusive)\n\nKat Dennings Had the Perfect Reaction to 'Genius' Casting of Natalie Portman as Thor (Exclusive)\n\nCate Blanchett Reacts to Natalie Portman Playing Thor in 'Love and Thunder' (Exclusive)\n\nNatalie Portman Returns as Thor in New Film: Kevin Feige Says 'She Was in Right Away' (Exclusive)\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles:\n\n\n\n", "description": "The actress opened up to ET about rejoining the MCU to reprise her role in the next 'Thor' film.", "authors": ["Zach Seemayer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7t2UN5NYNqDCvlXR9B59Dw--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/5b2962f584f7ef8d0b98d8a2535bf708", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
