In chalk, a sign reads: \u201cSystem change not climate change. Blockade IMARC. Shut the mines down.\u201d\n\nThe small number of protesters was dwarfed by the number of those who had planned to attend.\n\nMore than 1200 people said they were planning to attend on a Facebook event encouraging supporters to blockade the event.\n\nThe protests follow large-scale events at major Melbourne landmarks including Federation Square, Bourke Street Mall and Southern Cross Station.\n\nThe protests, many of which struck at peak hour, caused gridlock for commuters as protesters from Extinction Rebellion joined together to sit in the middle of major intersections.\n\nPolice responded to the mostly-peaceful protests. A number of protesters were arrested.\n\nActing Commander Tully said police would do their best to ensure the protests could be carried out safely but if protesters engaged in any unlawful activity police would respond swiftly.", "description": "Protesters lined up outside a major mining conference this week plan to inflict \u201cmaximum disruption\u201d on the Melbourne CBD this week, according to police.", "authors": ["Rohan Smith"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/997752b873f3f536c44e4dff2907816b?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
