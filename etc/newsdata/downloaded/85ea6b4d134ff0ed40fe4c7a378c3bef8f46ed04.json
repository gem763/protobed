REUTERS/Michael Dalder/File Photo\n\nSpot gold was barely changed at $1,501.39 per ounce as of 0708 GMT. U.S. gold futures were 0.3% lower at $1,509.10 per ounce.\n\n\u201cGold prices are trading with weak momentum. Last week the ECB (European Central Bank) already cut interest rates, now the focus will be on the FOMC (Federal Open Market Committee),\u201d said Jigar Trivedi, a commodities analyst at Mumbai-based Anand Rathi Shares & Stock Brokers.\n\n\u201cThe recent high near $1,560 in gold is a good resistance as of now. I do not think prices will go above it, lest the Fed indicates there will be another rate cut in December.\u201d\n\nEconomists and analysts widely expect the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark rate for a second time this year to counter risks posed by the U.S.-China trade war.\n\nThe chaotic moves in money markets and late-day swings in U.S. federal funds futures mean the CME\u2019s tool shows about a 65% chance that the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points on Wednesday.\n\nDenting safe-haven appeal for gold, Saudi Arabia sought to reassure markets after the attack on Saturday halved its crude oil output, saying full production would be restored by the month\u2019s end. [O/R]\n\nA risk-on sentiment in the market affects demand for bullion, often seen as an alternative investment during times of political and financial uncertainty.\n\nMSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.13%, while the dollar was little changed against a basket of other currencies at 98.36.\n\nSpot gold remains neutral in a range of $1,488-$1,523.61 per ounce, and an escape could suggest a direction, according to Reuters technical analyst Wang Tao.\n\n\u201cGold\u2019s correction below $1,500 after touching this year\u2019s highs above $1,550 is seen as healthy. Further consolidation is expected over the next few weeks, especially as trade headlines continue to exert their influence on near-term price action,\u201d UBS analysts said in a note.\n\nAlso in focus is the Bank of Japan\u2019s policy meeting due on Thursday. The central bank is expected to ease its policy this year.\n\nAmong other precious metals, platinum dropped 0.5% to $938.33 per ounce, while silver eased 0.6% to $17.90 an ounce.
