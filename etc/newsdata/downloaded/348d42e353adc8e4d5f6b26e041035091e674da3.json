Tulsi Gabbard speaks during the Presidential Gun Sense Forum in Des Moines, Iowa, August 10, 2019. (Scott Morgan/Reuters)\n\nEncourage her on life.\n\nHawaii Democrat Tulsi Gabbard recently made some comments that give me a glimmer of hope for a turn in our abortion politics. Interviewer Dave Rubin, describing himself as \u201cbegrudgingly pro-choice,\u201d explained that he seems to be evolving on the issue of abortion in the wake of the extremism we\u2019ve been seeing recently, especially in regard to children born alive after a botched abortion. He noted that Gabbard has had an evolution of her own, having once described herself as pro-life. Gabbard explained that her military deployment to Iraq changed her perspective. She became more libertarian on the issue. \u201cGovernment really shouldn\u2019t be in that place of dictating to a woman the choice that she should make.\u201d She then went on to say: \u201cI would not make that choice. . . . But a woman should have the right to choose.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the surface, that\u2019s a pretty standard Democrat position, akin to the declaration by Mario Cuomo, the late former New York governor, that he personally opposed to abortion. What good is private opposition in the face of the death of innocent life, the pitting of a mother against her child, the trail of misery that is legal abortion, with all the cultural pressures in favor of abortion?\n\nBut these days, it may just be a brave thing to say that you would not make that choice yourself. It may just be a courageous thing to have regret and sadness in your voice, as a Democrat. And then Gabbard did do something that matters, that\u2019s a step toward some real leadership in her party. She drew a line in the sand, identifying the third trimester as a \u201ccutoff point.\u201d \u201cUnless a woman\u2019s life, or severe health consequences, is at risk, then there shouldn\u2019t be an abortion in the third trimester.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen considering Gabbard\u2019s remarks, it\u2019s important to bear in mind that we\u2019re a long way away from Mario Cuomo. His son, as governor of New York, has derided pro-life citizens, and he campaigned a long time for the abortion-expansion legislation that he signed into law and celebrated in bright pink lights on the Empire State Building this year. It\u2019s also been a while since Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201csafe, legal, and rare\u201d position on abortion. Gabbard, in the interview with Rubin, mistakenly attributed it to Hillary Clinton. But Hillary Clinton wouldn\u2019t go there. I was waiting for that moment during the 2016 presidential election. I kept thinking, Surely this woman is going to tone down her extremism on abortion, surely she is going to make a play for pro-life people who were aching for an alternative to Donald Trump. But she never did. Instead, in the debates, she doubled down on her extreme position.\n\nIn Congress, Gabbard has chosen not to co-sponsor legislation to repeal the Hyde Amendment, a longtime ban on federal funding of abortion that Joe Biden has chosen to abandon \u2014 he won\u2019t even stand up to radicals in his party. Gabbard also didn\u2019t join in on legislation that would override state restrictions on abortion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf Tulsi Gabbard feels called to be a reasonable voice on abortion in the Democratic party, I don\u2019t envy her. Party powers are not apt to be kind to her. Planned Parenthood is the ideology of the party. But Planned Parenthood is having some trouble of its own right now. As a new Planned Parenthood president, a medical doctor, couldn\u2019t even hold out even nine months, the length of a pregnancy, before being forced out \u2014 deemed a poor fit for the organization apparently because she wanted to downplay the abortion extremism in its rhetoric. If ever there were a moment begging for someone \u2014 and a woman would be a natural \u2014 to step up to the plate and lead in that party, it\u2019s now.\n\nMany American who describe themselves as pro-choice do not like or prefer abortion, they simply want to know that a pregnant woman with severe challenges or without resources will have options. Some choices for her involve pregnancy assistance of many kinds, including the possibility of adoption \u2014 things that we don\u2019t talk about while we are screaming at one another over abortion. If you listen to the sound of her voice in that interview, Gabbard seems to want something better for America, she seems to know that America is better than our current abortion politics. People of good will should encourage her to use her the spotlight that her primary campaign affords her to be a trailblazer for more life-giving politics.\n\nOne of the most reasonable voices in the Democratic party is Michael Wear, who worked in President Barack Obama\u2019s faith-based office. Earlier this year, he wrote an article for The Atlantic, \u201cThe Abortion Debate Needs Moral Lament.\u201d In it, he observed:\n\nOur politicians spend so much time with people who agree with them, using talking points cleared by or provided by entrenched advocacy groups and pursuing electoral strategies more reliant on base turnout than persuasion, that it has become difficult to tell if they have simply forgotten how to speak with people who hold a different viewpoint or if they simply do not care. So many of these controversies would be avoided if politicians were more familiar with different perspectives on abortion, and the arguments and sensitivities that undergird them.\n\nGabbard sounds like someone who understands, in part because she might have misgivings about the state of the Democratic party when it comes to abortion. She doesn\u2019t have to declare herself pro-life again tomorrow \u2014 though there should be competition for the pro-life vote! \u2014 but she could propose some common-ground initiatives. She could talk about clearing obstacles for women and families. And people who consider themselves pro-life should encourage and welcome this. It would be good for the life of America.\n\nThis column is based on one available through Andrews McMeel Universal\u2019s Newspaper Enterprise Association.", "description": "The Hawaii Democrat offers a glimmer of hope for a turn in our abortion politics.", "authors": ["Kathryn Jean Lopez", "Tobias Hoonhout", "Rich Lowry", "Zachary Evans", "Jim Geraghty", "Mairead Mcardle", "Victor Davis Hanson", "Andrew C.
