To have been a trailblazer in this way, she said, \u201cwas an honor, and with that came a lot of negativity and a lot of judgment towards me, which I\u2019m happy to have held if it made a difference.\u201d\n\nDoes she think it did? I asked.\n\nAfter a long pause she answered, \u201cI do, actually. I know that it really resonated.\u201d But, she added, \u201cIt\u2019s not about me doing it. I was just the instrument by which it was done. Clearly it didn\u2019t do enough because we\u2019re still, this many years later, dealing with it.\u201d\n\n\u2018Women didn\u2019t naturally fit into the system\u2019\n\nNo setback deflated Moore quite like \u201cG.I. Jane,\u201d the Ridley Scott action movie for which Moore underwent weeks of training and a grueling shoot to play a fictional character attempting to become the first woman to complete Navy Seal training. That film was criticized by military veterans for inaccuracies and savaged by reviewers, ending up a box-office disappointment.\n\n\u201cThey weren\u2019t going to let me win,\u201d she said. \u201cThat, to the little girl in me \u2014 that was crushing.\u201d\n\nAmid her divorce from Willis and her mother\u2019s death from cancer, Moore stepped back from her acting work to focus on raising her daughters. Though she continued to produce films like the \u201cAustin Powers\u201d series, she acted only occasionally, in roles like the villain of \u201cCharlie\u2019s Angels: Full Throttle.\u201d She was in her early 40s and wondering if Hollywood had no more use for her.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d say they don\u2019t really know what to do with you, where to place you,\u201d she said. \u201cI was like, oh, well is that supposed to flatter me?\u201d", "description": "After years of scrutiny for her career, relationships and setbacks, the movie star hopes the public sees another side in her memoir, \u201cInside Out.\u201d", "authors": ["Dave Itzkoff"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/22/arts/22DEMIMOORE1/12DEMIMOORE1-facebookJumbo.jpg"}
