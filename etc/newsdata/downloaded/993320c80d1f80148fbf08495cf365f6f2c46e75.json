H\u00f6cke represents AfD\u2019s radical right contingent, whose influence in the party is likely to be strengthened by the result.\n\nPressure mounts on Merkel's heir apparent before state elections Read more\n\nThe Green party was celebrating gains in both states, of 3.3 points in Saxony, where it reached 8.6%, and 3.8 points in Brandenburg, reaching 10.2%, even though it failed to perform as strongly as had been predicted.\n\nBut it is likely to be an important player in the formation of coalitions in both Saxony and Brandenburg, where the SPD-Left party partnership lost its majority. All the major parties have ruled out forming a coalition with AfD, even though the CDU has come under pressure from its right wing to do so.\n\nBecause the slump in the performance of the mainstream parties was not as severe as predicted, the beleaguered grand coalition in Berlin under Merkel will gain some breathing space, as will the CDU\u2019s chairwoman, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer.\n\nShe has failed to convince as a leader since taking over from Merkel in December, but will probably benefit from the CDU\u2019s better than expected showing in Saxony. Merkel, who has led the country since 2005, has said she will not stand for re-election. The next German federal election is expected to be held between August and October 2021.\n\nAnalysis of the results showed that in Saxony, home to the notorious anti-immigrant campaign group Pegida, often seen as the protest arm of AfD, voters\u2019 main motivation for choosing AfD was out of conviction for its political message, while the majority of AfD supporters in Brandenburg said they voted in protest against the policies of the mainstream government.", "description": "Exit polls put party second in German state elections in Saxony and Brandenburg", "authors": ["Kate Connolly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a8f1300806a5be9c046882f71ad9b78f01975d5/780_0_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cbd4c81792fa0531b0642a3910a8c60b"}
