Perhaps a shorter term issue is whether it is time for way the banking sector to stop shooting itself in the foot with the way it talks about its mortgage pricing.\n\nThe sector is howling at claims in The Australian that the banks are reaping an extra $14 billion a year in interest payments, a figure calculated by comparing the fall in the RBA cash rate to the fall in average standard variable rate, which sits at 4.8 per cent.\n\nThe banks say very few customers pay this rate, with discounts shaving between 130 basis points and 150 basis points off the actually rate paid by most mortgagees.\n\nSo why do the banks still quote these average standard variable rates that look so high?\n\nThe answer is that they like the lack of transparency, as it allows them to offer different customers with different circumstances different levels of discounting.\n\nObviously, the banks need to customise rates to account for different levels of risk. But surely in this climate of political and regulatory tension it\u2019s time to find a way to be much more transparent with the community about mortgage rates.", "description": "Why do the banks still quote these average standard variable rates that look so high?
