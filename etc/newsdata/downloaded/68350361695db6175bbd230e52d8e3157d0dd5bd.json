San Miguel de Escaz\u00fa, the capital city of the canton, is in the central district. Santa Ana Canton is on its western boundary, the San Rafael district is on the north and east and the San Antonio district is on the south.\n\nPrice Range\n\nAt the luxury end of the market, prices for single-family houses range from US$500,000 to US$8 million, according to Yalile Alpizar, broker/owner of Costa Rica Luxury. (She added that prices are regularly quoted in U.S. dollars for the international market.)\n\nA US$500,000 house, she said, would be about 300 square meters and would be on a 500-square-meter lot.

Luxury Homes Costa Rica\n\nJohn Ordonez, CEO at Luxury Homes Costa Rica, noted that the wide range of prices reflects the neighborhood\u2019s mix of income levels. Because of this, he said, \u201cNext to a million-dollar home, you can see a very poor family.\u201d\n\nOne-bedroom condos in some of the most sought-after developments, including Central Park, Cerro Alto, Distrito Cuatro, Torre Country, Avenida Escaz\u00fa, Escaz\u00fa Village, Hacienda el Por\u00f3, Valle del Tamarindo, Monteplata and El Cortijo, start at US$180,000, Ms. Alpizar said. At the top of the market, a 400-square-meter penthouse can reach US$2 million, she added.\n\nMr. Ordonez said that he\u2019s seen condo prices go even higher\u2014to US$4 million\u2014 in the most coveted, luxurious towers.\n\nThe difference in condo prices, added Ms. Ibarra, reflects the location, amenities and size of each unit. \u201cThe fact that you can buy a new and nice condo for an average of US$400,000 makes it achievable for young professionals with or without family to live here,\u201d she added.\n\nMore: Saint-Thomas-d\u2019Aquin, a Picture-Postcard Neighborhood in Paris\n\nHousing Stock\n\nLarge estates designed by award-winning local architects dominate the housing market.

You literally can watch the sun rise in the Caribbean Sea and the sun set in the Pacific Ocean all in the same day.\u201d\n\nShe added that the neighborhood\u2019s pack of amenities\u201a\u2014schools, restaurants, entertainment centers, shops, country clubs and medical services\u2014make it highly desirable for those who can afford it.\n\nFrom Penta: The World\u2019s Largest Superyacht Is Built to Help the Ocean\n\n\u201cEscaz\u00fa is one of the most sought-after locations in San Jose among foreigners due to its new infrastructure, amenities and bilingual schools,\u201d Mr. Ordonez added. \u201cIt has beautiful hills and offers amazing views of the city and mountains. I believe people move here because of the weather, and housing is not as expensive as it is in some of the world-class cities in the world.\u201d\n\nThe fact that Escaz\u00fa is close to everything and has everything within its borders for cosmopolitan living makes it special, added Ms. Ibarra.\n\nSited in the mountains of Escaz\u00fa, this 7,416-square-foot home on 1.21 acres is listed for $1.75 million.

Going there is a family tradition; it has great service, excellent meat and the best caramelized plantains.
