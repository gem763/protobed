Photo: Bowie Tang\n\n\u201cWe will not take actions to support [the arrested students], as both parents want to stay low-profile. We respect their wishes,\u201d he said, as the parents of both students are unwilling to disclose the charges against their children.\n\n\u201cI feel bad for the students involved, as both of them are good students. Some of our members feel angry about the arrest.\"\n\nWhen asked about whether he fears his school would reveal information about students supporting and participating in the anti-government rallies, Bowie said he has faith that his principal and teachers would not \u201cbetray\u201d them.\n\n\u201cIn recent weeks, we\u2019ve talked to the principal and teachers several times. They\u2019ve shown care and love to us,\u201d he said. \u201cThe school does not encourage us, but they do not stop us either.\u201d\n\nFace off: Should students take part in social movements?\n\nBowie added that his school\u2019s vice principal and teacher have been present at class boycotts and school rallies. Teachers have also provided physical and mental support for them during the movement.\n\nHe commented that the anti-mask law that came into effect last Saturday was \u201ctotally unacceptable,\u201d and alleged that the government intended to \u201ctake authoritarian control of\u201d Hongkongers by exercising the emergency law.\n\n\u201cI [suspect] the government will use the [emergency law] to extend the maximum period of custody, restrict media [coverage], and so on. The anti-mask law is just a testing ground for them to see how citizens respond to the use of the [emergency law].\u201d\n\nBowie also admitted that he is mentally prepared to be arrested. \u201cAs long as I\u2019m still alive, I won\u2019t give up on this. I\u2019m ready to be arrested,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a Christian, and I think that one of my missions is to fight against tyranny,\u201d he added.", "description": "The teenagers were arrested in Wan Chai and Whampoa, where anti-mask ban protests took place over the long weekend", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/img_8896_2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
