I know about me,' PayPal Co-Founder Max Levchin says", "language": "en", "text": "America\u2019s tech behemoths are facing a reckoning that, most recently, spurred new antitrust probes by a bipartisan group of state attorneys general into Facebook (FB) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL).\n\nIn a newly released interview recorded before that news came out, Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer asked PayPal Co-Founder Max Levchin whether he believes tech giants like Google and Facebook have become \u201ctoo powerful.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey're certainly extremely powerful in the absolute sense,\u201d said Levchin, a computer scientist by training who went on to become a serial entrepreneur. \u201cLike, yes, Facebook probably knows far more about me than I think I know about me \u2014 and that I think anybody should know about me, really because they're an amalgamation of all my friends' knowledge of \u2014 of me.\u201d\n\nMax Levchin speaks to Yahoo Finance's Andy Serwer. More\n\nLevchin made the comments during a conversation that aired in an episode of Yahoo Finance\u2019s \u201cInfluencers with Andy Serwer,\u201d a weekly interview series with leaders in business, politics, and entertainment. His observations about Facebook and Google come as big tech faces unprecedented scrutiny and fines that some say still don\u2019t go far enough.\n\nIn July, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) smacked Facebook with a record-breaking $5 billion fine over its collection of user data. The FTC probe was prompted by reports in March 2018 that Facebook had allowed a consulting firm with ties to the Donald Trump presidential campaign to harvest users\u2019 data without their consent \u2014 a scandal now known simply as \u201cCambridge Analytica.\u201d\n\nFor its part, Google was hit with its third billion-dollar antitrust fine in Europe in March. And just this week, the FTC hit Google with a $170 million fine for violating kids\u2019 privacy on Google-owned YouTube.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re playing with the human condition\u2019\n\nIn his interview with Yahoo Finance, Levchin said Facebook and Google have \u201cenormous\u201d responsibility because of the vast amounts of user data at their fingertips. Levchin, who previously worked at Google as vice president of engineering, said the search giant knows even more about users than Facebook.\n\nAs Yahoo Finance\u2019s tech editor, Dan Howley, has noted, Google knows every place you\u2019ve been if you have location history turned on. It also knows everything you\u2019ve searched on YouTube and likely everything you\u2019ve searched online \u2014 which, as Levchin pointed out, often sheds light on the person searching for that information.\n\n\u201cDuring my time at Google, I met an executive who likened Google search box to an ear, where it's the world's giantest ear,\u201d said Levchin, who is 44 years old and currently CEO of fintch company Affirm. \u201cAnd billions of people come in and whisper into its ear, you know, amazing things, like where do I buy an engagement ring? And, also, do I have cancer? And will I die?\u201d\n\nThe first thing tech companies should do, Levchin said, is to recognize the human beings on the other side of the services they provide.\n\n\u201cYou're playing with the human condition more than you're playing with the balance sheet,\u201d Levchin said. \u201cSo my guess is the first thing they need to do is probably recognize internally, and sort of take very, very seriously, that what they're playing with is a lot more than their profit and loss and features. And ... that's a weighty, weighty set of responsibilities.\u201d\n\nThe responsibilities of tech companies may grow as regulators continue to crack down on them. Facebook is facing yet another FTC probe, and the Justice Department is looking into possible antitrust violations at online platforms that likely include Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Twitter (TWTR), Facebook, and Google.", "description": "PayPal Co-Founder Max Levchin says that Facebook and Google have vast amounts of data on their users.", "authors": ["Erin Fuchs", "Deputy Managing Editor"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/cA2liwTEB82Ng7yADuTYRA--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/1e0e4af0-d0d7-11e9-beaf-ee4f1946fb85", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
