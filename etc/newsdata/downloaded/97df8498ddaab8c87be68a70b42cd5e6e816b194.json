This is how we live now.\n\nAs of this writing, Trump\u2019s channel has almost 9,000 followers, and about 8,700 are watching his rally in Minnesota. The chat is moving rapidly, but there are lot of walls of \u201cIMPEACH,\u201d as well as a lot of emotes. Chat doesn\u2019t appear to be moderated, so view it at your own risk.\n\nMy colleague Nathan suspects some video game streamers\u2019 communities are spamming the chat, as evidenced by emotes of streamer Forsen\u2019s face, but honestly, it\u2019s hard to tell what\u2019s going on at all, which sums up this livestream pretty well.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot of media,\u201d he was saying as I tuned in, to boos in the crowd. \u201cThey are so dishonest and, frankly, they are so bad for our country, and they could be so good. Maybe they\u2019ll change and maybe they won\u2019t. I\u2019ve been waiting for a long time.\u201d\n\nTrump isn\u2019t the first politician to take to the streaming site. Bernie Sanders has been using Twitch to reach supporters, including during the recent Amazon boycott.\n\nAmazon owns Twitch; The Verge points out that Trump has a contentious history with the company, so it\u2019s a bit of surprise to see him on its platform. Maybe that Fortnite vote is more potent than we think.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it better when I go off script?\u201d Trump is saying now.\n\nThis will end well.", "description": "Donald Trump got a Twitch channel, from which he\u2019s currently livestreaming a rally in Minneapolis.
