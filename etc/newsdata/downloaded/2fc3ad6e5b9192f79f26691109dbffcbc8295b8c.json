He responded, \u201cYes, I did [want Trump to win] because he talked about bringing the U.S.-Russia relationship back to normal.\u201d\n\nIn a January report, the U.S. intelligence community concluded that senior Russian officials\u2014including Putin\u2014wanted Trump to win the 2016 election and aimed their alleged interference efforts towards achieving that end. Former FBI Director James Comey told Congress in March that Putin wanted Trump to become president because \u201che very much disliked Clinton,\u201d the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nWhile Putin avoided confirming any interference by Russia, and said that collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin was \u201cutter nonsense,\u201d Trump took Putin\u2019s side and publicly doubted the accuracy of his own intelligence officials in front of his Russian counterpart.\n\n\"My people came to me, [Director of National Intelligence] Dan Coats came to me, some others, they said they think it's Russia,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI have President Putin. He just said it's not Russia. I will say this, I don't see any reason why it would be.\"\n\nWhen directly asked about possible Russian interference, Trump said that \u201cPresident Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial\u201d and the Russian president \u201chas an interesting idea\u201d about the situation. (Putin did not explain what that \u201cinteresting idea\u201d was.)\n\nJust last week, Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers for hacking the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Democratic National Committee, and Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign. The GRU officers are also accused of posing as hackers DCLeaks and Guccifer 2.0 to disseminate the stolen information during the election.\n\nTrump continued, harping on Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and calling it a \u201cdisaster for our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s kept us apart. It\u2019s kept us separated. There was no collusion at all. Everybody knows it\u2026 They will have to try really hard to find something that did relate to the campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main thing\u2013we discussed this also\u2013is zero collusion. It has had a negative impact upon the relationship of the two largest nuclear powers in the world\u2026 It\u2019s ridiculous. It\u2019s ridiculous what\u2019s going on with the probe.\u201d\n\nIn reaction to the press conference, former CIA chief John Brennan called Trump\u2019s comments \u201cnothing short of treasonous.\u201d\n\n\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s press conference performance in Helsinki rises to & exceeds the threshold of \u2018high crimes & misdemeanors,\u2019\u201d Brennan wrote on Twitter. \u201cNot only were Trump\u2019s comments imbecilic, he is wholly in the pocket of Putin.\u201d", "description": "Despite Putin affirming the U.S. intelligence community\u2019s conclusion about the 2016 election, Trump still took the Russian president\u2019s words over his own intel officials\u2019.", "authors": ["Julia Arciga"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1440,w_2560,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1531760256/180716-Arciga-Putin_Admits_He_Wanted_Trump_to_Win-hero_jbzlfv", "published_at": "2018-07-16"}
