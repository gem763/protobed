He repeated 'Emanuela is in heaven'\".\n\n\"That sentence hurt me. An investigation is ongoing, we don't know if Emanuela is alive or dead.\n\n\"In that moment I told myself, 'he knows something, more than us',\" he said.\n\n\"How did she die? Where are her remains? If she is in heaven, where are her remains?\"\n\nOrlandi grew up inside the walled Vatican City. Now retired, he spends some of his time helping families with missing relatives.\n\nHis father died in 2005 without knowing what happened to his daughter.", "description": "Teenager Emanuela Orlandi went missing in Italy 36-years ago, but her big brother Pietro has never stopped looking for her.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/7269/66c419d1f0de4d829d5d2c561453d6b3.jpg", "published_at": "2019-07-11"}
