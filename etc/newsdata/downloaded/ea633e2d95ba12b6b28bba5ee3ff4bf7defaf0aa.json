Cover and refrigerate for 30 minutes.\n\nPreheat the oven to 200\u00b0C.\n\nMeanwhile, combine all the ingredients for the tequila sauce, except the sugar, in a saucepan over a medium heat.\n\nBring to a boil and reduce by half, then add the sugar. Taste, and adjust the seasoning if necessary. Reduce by half again and set aside.\n\nPlace an ovenproof frying pan over a medium heat and add a dash of olive oil. Add the pork chops to the pan and brown on both sides (3 minutes per side).\n\nTransfer to the oven and cook for 8 minutes, remove and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving.\n\nServe with onion rings, a side of green vegetables and the tequila sauce.\n\nTIP\n\nTo make the perfect onion rings, make a batter of 150g flour, 1 egg, a pinch of salt and 15ml baking powder. Combine with ice cold water mixed into the desired thick-batter consistency. The trick to getting them crispy is placing the ice-cold batter into hot oil at 180\u00b0C.\n\nA recipe extract from 'Summer food' by Tjaart Walraven, published by Penguin Random House.", "description": "I celebrate my birthdays with parties with friends every five years: on the decade milestone and in the middle. The night before my 25th birthday (sometimes the celebrations span a few days!), friends and I were in a restaurant and the subject of a popular TV advertisement came up \u2013 a boxer (a dog) would look through the window of a pickup truck and tell the sheep outside, \u2018You\u2019re such a chop, stuck in a hole, stuck in a hole.\u2019 Opinion was mixed on whether the ad was funny or not, but somehow the name \u2018Chop\u2019 stuck, probably fuelled by tequilas along the way. Anyway, inspiration flowed because that night we were subjected to the retro dish of steak and monkey gland sauce. I had to do something and this was the result.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9402/7fb820788efb4b309728fd998bbb1675.png", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
