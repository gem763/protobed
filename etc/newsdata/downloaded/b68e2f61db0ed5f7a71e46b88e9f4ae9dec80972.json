Gen. Julie Payette to dissolve Parliament today, triggering the official launch of Canada's federal election campaign.\n\nAccording to Trudeau's itinerary, the Liberal leader will head to Rideau Hall in Ottawa at 10 a.m. ET, sounding the starting pistol for the Oct. 21 election.\n\nTraditionally, the prime minister visits the Governor General at Rideau Hall with a letter (also known as an \"instrument of advice\") recommending the dissolution of Parliament, followed by a general election call.\n\nAfter agreeing to the election call, the Governor General issues a proclamation on behalf of the Queen. That clears the way for the chief electoral officer to issue formal notices, known as writs, instructing the returning officer in each of Canada's 338 federal ridings to hold an election to choose a member of Parliament.\n\nBeginning at 9 a.m. ET, The National's Rosemary Barton will host special coverage live from Rideau Hall in Ottawa. It will be on CBC News Network and CBC-TV, and streamed on cbcnews.ca, the CBC News app for iOS and Android, and on CBC Gem. On CBC Radio One, Susan Bonner and Chris Hall will have live coverage of the election campaign kickoff starting at 10 a.m. ET.\n\nThe most recent polls show the Conservatives and Liberals deadlocked, after the Tories had enjoyed a lead stretching back to February and the start of the SNC-Lavalin affair.\n\nPolls show majority still up in the air\n\nAccording to CBC's Poll Tracker, the Liberals are projected to win the most seats \u2014 but whether any party can secure a majority is still a toss-up.\n\nTrudeau's Liberals are seeking a second mandate and will spend the next 40 days pitching Canadians on the party's accomplishments \u2014 especially their efforts to lift children out of poverty and create jobs \u2014 while trying to contrast themselves on social issues with their main rivals.\n\nThe Conservatives, meanwhile, will be going after other aspects of the government's record \u2014 especially Trudeau's ethics breach in the SNC-Lavalin affair \u2014 while promising to ease Canadians' economic anxieties.\n\nThe NDP, which is fighting against sinking polling figures and a shrunken war chest, is trying to pitch itself as a viable alternative to the two front-runners and appeal to progressive voters embittered after the Liberals' last four years in office.\n\nThe Green Party is hoping to make a breakthrough in the House of Commons and build on its current two-seat caucus.\n\nA podium is set up outside of Rideau Hall on Sept. 11, 2019. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will head there this morning to ask Gov. Gen. Julie Payette to dissolve Parliament. (Chris Rands/CBC)\n\nFormer Conservative Maxime Bernier is hoping to make a splash with his new party, the People's Party of Canada (PPC), by holding on to his own seat and bringing new MPs to Parliament.\n\nAfter dismantling, replacing its leader and then coming together again, the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois will be looking to win at least 12 seats in Quebec and regain official party status \u2014 a title it hasn't held since 2011.\n\nWhile today's visit to Rideau Hall marks the official launch of the campaign, the parties have been stumping all summer, airing TV and digital ads, circulating their campaign slogans and unearthing nuggets of opposition research.\n\nStrict rules coming into effect\n\nEven before today's events at Rideau Hall, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer had promised to kick off his campaign on Wednesday. He starts in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Que. \u2014 a province where the Tories hope to grow their support \u2014 before heading to the Toronto-area riding of Vaughan-Woodbridge, a relatively new riding held by a Liberal that the Conservatives hope to flip to blue.\n\nNDP Leader Jagmeet Singh, in his first campaign as leader, will be in London, Ont., today. Green Party Leader Elizabeth May will kick off her campaign in Victoria.\n\nTrudeau will also head to B.C., where he will hold a campaign rally in Vancouver.\n\nThe start of the writ period isn't just ceremonial. As of today, strict rules kick in on spending and advertising.\n\nUnder Canada's new fixed-date election rules, the campaign can only run a maximum of 50 days and had to be called no later than Sunday. It will be noticeably shorter than the 78-day 2015 campaign \u2014 the longest in modern Canadian history.", "description": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to ask Gov. Gen.
