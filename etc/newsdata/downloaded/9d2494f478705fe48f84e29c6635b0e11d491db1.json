Morton argues that there\u2019s value in explaining the radicalization process to what he calls the intelligentsia, but there\u2019s also an element of preaching to the choir. Most skinheads aren\u2019t going to be convinced to reform by an Aspen Ideas panel, nor is that really the point of an Aspen Ideas panel. (The Aspen Ideas Festival, which has featured panelists such as Morton, is co-hosted by the Aspen Institute and The Atlantic.) The problem, as Morton sees it, is that former extremists can provide fodder for current extremists by allowing propagandists to point to them and their ideas as the enemy. Formers can, in their eagerness to condemn their own prior worldview, exacerbate the very us-versus-them narrative that helps fuel radicalism in the first place.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re promoting a polarized narrative and don\u2019t realize it, then you\u2019re part of the problem,\u201d Morton says.\n\nDeradicalization and counter-extremism programs, especially those involving former extremists, are relatively new in the United States, but they have a longer history in Europe, according to Lorenzo Vidino, the director of the Program on Extremism, who helped recruit Morton to work there as a researcher. The U.K.\u2019s Quilliam\u2014which describes itself as \u201cthe world\u2019s first counter-extremism organization\u201d\u2014was founded as a think tank in 2007 by three British former radical Islamists.\n\nThe Obama administration launched its own \u201ccountering violent extremism\u201d initiative in 2011, with a variety of programs aimed at helping local law enforcement share information, do community outreach, and try to prevent attacks. The program was always a target for criticism, ranging from complaints about underfunding to accusations that it unfairly focused on and stigmatized Muslim communities. Right-wing extremism, moreover, was not a top priority then, and one organization dedicated to countering it got some funding under Obama but saw it lapse under Trump.\n\nBut there wasn\u2019t a systematic effort to recruit formers into that project early on. Vidino had observed the European experience and thought such a strategy might be useful in the United States, though he told me he was aware of \u201csome of the issues.\u201d\n\nRead: How many attacks will it take until the white-supremacist threat is taken seriously?\n\nThose included the fact that what radicalizes one person doesn\u2019t necessarily radicalize another\u2014so any former\u2019s personal experience might not be persuasive to anyone else. Another concern is that formers themselves might have unresolved personal problems\u2014something that became clear when Morton was arrested on drug and prostitution charges in 2017. The university did not deem it appropriate for Morton to stay after he was charged. \u201cYou go from prison as a well-known jihadi to front page in The New York Times as somebody who\u2019s fighting terrorism\u2014that [would mess] up a lot of people,\u201d Vidino said.", "description": "Some who have renounced their past in neo-Nazi or jihadist movements now hope to save others from the same fate.
