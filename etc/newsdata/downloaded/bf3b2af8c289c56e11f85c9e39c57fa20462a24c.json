REUTERS/Rebecca Cook\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the AFL-CIO labor union on Wednesday warned against speedy passage of the Trump administration\u2019s new trade pact with Mexico and Canada, saying he was especially concerned about labor protection measures in Mexico and adding that any vote on the plan before the end of November would lead to its defeat.\n\n\u201cIf there was a vote on the new #NAFTA before thanksgiving, the agreement would be defeated. Fast action would be a colossal mistake. #1u,\u201d the group\u2019s president, Richard Trumka, said in a tweet.\n\nHis concerns include reservations that Mexico might not make necessary changes to ensure labor reforms, or adequately fund enforcement mechanisms, he separately said in an interview with the Washington Post, which first reported his comments.\n\n\u201cIf they can\u2019t enforce their own laws, we have a real problem,\u201d Trumka told the Post. \u201cNo agreement will be able to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we can get these things fixed, we can get to yes,\u201d he added. \u201cIf we can\u2019t get them fixed, we can\u2019t get to yes.\u201d\n\nHis comments echoed concerns from House Democrats, which must pass the deal secured by Republican President Donald Trump. A top Democratic lawmaker, who led a delegation to Mexico, this week said Mexico must do more to implement labor reforms.\n\nTrump, his administration, congressional Republicans and several key business groups have been pressuring House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to take up the measure before the Thanksgiving holiday in late November.\n\nPelosi, in a letter to House Democrats on Tuesday, said they would \u201ccontinue our discussion of the USMCA.\u201d", "description": "The head of the AFL-CIO labor union on Wednesday warned against speedy passage of the Trump administration's new trade pact with Mexico and Canada, saying he was especially concerned about labor protection measures in Mexico and adding that any vote on the plan before the end of November would lead to its defeat.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191009&t=2&i=1438896598&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF981L1-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
