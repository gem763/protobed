(AP) - Russell Okung didn\u2019t hold back in describing what the past four months have been like for him and his family.\n\n\u201cI definitely looked death right in the face and if it had not been for a family that cared from my well-being despite my own resistance, I might not be here right now,\u201d Okung said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers offensive tackle took part in his first practice Thursday since June 1, when he suffered a pulmonary embolism during an offseason workout at the team facility.\n\nHe is being treated for blood clots and has been on the non-football injury list. Okung does not need to be added to the active roster for up to three weeks as he continues to work his way back.\n\nThe 6-foot-5, 310-pound Okung said his main priority during the past few months was making sure the blood clots were treatable and that he could live a healthy life. Once that was determined, he had conversations with his family about whether to return for a 10th NFL season and third with the Chargers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been an optimist, but family is a priority,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a combination of hard conversations with my family, internally looking at myself and making the decision that it did make sense to keep playing. I don\u2019t think anyone doubted that I could return, but I am grateful.\u201d\n\nOkung has said that he was initially hesitant to see a doctor but that shortness of breath that was affecting him in practice made him visit an urgent care facility, where tests revealed the embolism. Doctors told him the decision to get examined likely saved his life.\n\nOkung is hoping his experiences will serve as a cautionary tale for other pro athletes.\n\n\u201cWhen you talk about athletes and our health, it\u2019s very difficult to go to the doctor or even take care of ourselves. I was forced into that,\u201d he said. \u201cDeep vein thrombosis is an ailment that not a lot of players are paying attention to and it is becoming more prevalent. It is something that players should be checking themselves for.\u201d\n\nIt is unlikely Okung will be ready for Sunday\u2019s game at Tennessee, but he hasn\u2019t ruled it out. He is not worried about his technique and abilities, but the biggest thing is feeling the speed of the game again.\n\nOkung was doing regular position drills with the rest of the offensive line.\n\nCoach Anthony Lynn will update Okung\u2019s status after Friday\u2019s practice.\n\nOkung\u2019s return is a rare bit of good injury news for the Chargers, who suffered a key loss to the offensive line last week when center Mike Pouncey underwent season-ending neck surgery.\n\nThe line currently doesn\u2019t have a lot of experience, with the most seasoned starter having six seasons. Trent Scott, a second-year undrafted player, has been at left tackle.\n\n\u201cAnytime you get a Pro Bowl player back, it is a big lift. Trent has battled his tail off but it would be great having Russell back,\u201d offensive coordinator Ken Whisenhunt said.\n\nHowever, they did place wide receiver Travis Benjamin on injured reserve due to a quad injury he suffered in Sunday\u2019s loss to Pittsburgh. Benjamin has been plagued by various injuries the past two seasons and had only six receptions for 30 yards this season.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Russell Okung didn't hold back in describing what the past four months have been like for him and his family.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Joe Reedy"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
