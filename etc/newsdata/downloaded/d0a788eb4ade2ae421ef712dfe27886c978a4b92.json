Photo: Courtesy the retailer\n\nThe friend who gave it to me is technologically obsessed and prone to spending hours researching the very best of whatever electronic item he\u2019s bent on purchasing. After much careful consideration, he deemed the PowerLine+ to be the gold standard of cables \u2014 \u201cthe world\u2019s most durable cable,\u201d he said as he gifted it to me. So far, he\u2019s been dead right. Here\u2019s something small that will make your life instantly better: an extra-long (I\u2019m talking a full ten feet in length) charging cable, made by Anker and available for Apple or Android phones.\n\nFor two years, I\u2019ve used it every single day. In my house, I\u2019ll drag it along everywhere I go. I can lie on any end of the couch and still charge my phone, or lie all the way down in bed (rather than awkwardly perch on one elbow next to the power strip), or even just ride in the backseat of a car with the phone plugged into the cigar socket and still use my phone while charging it. (Why are power outlets always located in the least convenient places possible?) Two full years of heavy use later, it hasn\u2019t split, torn, bent, or even started to fray \u2014 and I\u2019ve yanked, twisted, stretched, and dropped it repeatedly.\n\nMy tech-savvy friend also introduced me to the idea of line loss \u2014 meaning that with most longer charging cables, your device will charge slower \u2014 but Anker has perfected technology that allows it to actually go even faster (of course they\u2019ve named it PowerIQ). The PowerLine+ takes all of my devices from one percent to a full charge in just about an hour. Unlike other cords I\u2019ve tried, it also has a slim charging end, so it works with almost any phone case \u2014 even my bulky Otter Box case, which, as a person who drops her phone at least twice per day, I have to say is a godsend.\n\nAnker PowerLine+ Lightning Cable (10ft) Charging Cable \u00a315 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nAnother Strat-endorsed phone accessory\n\nLuMee Duo for iPhone 8/7/6s/6 An Otter Box is great for protecting your phone, but when you want a case that can illuminate you for the perfect selfie, get the LuMee: \u201cFirst of all: the light. You\u2019ll find that it\u2019s beyond embarrassing to use the LuMee Duo in public (you\u2019re flashing a blazing rectangle of light onto yourself and everyone in the vicinity, after all), but it produces undeniably perfect photos. Turn it on and you\u2019re awash in a warm (or incandescent, depending on your preference) radiance that\u2019s almost angelic.\u201d \u00a318 at Amazon UK Buy\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
