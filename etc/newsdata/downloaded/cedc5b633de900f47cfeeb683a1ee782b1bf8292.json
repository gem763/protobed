Twenty students from Hong Kong went to the tropical island in August to see the impact human activity and global warming are having on its ecology, on a field trip arranged by the charitable organisation, Yan Oi Tong.\n\nYoung Post spoke to five of the students who shared their experiences of the 15-day trip, where they visited many of the island\u2019s national parks and saw some of the island\u2019s wildlife. The visit was also an opportunity for the students to learn about the island\u2019s people.\n\nWhat struck the students most was the extent of deforestation they saw as their plane prepared to land. It\u2019s estimated that more than 90 per cent of forests have been lost to human activity.\n\n11-year-old climate activist asks, why worry about development if there's no future?\n\n\u201cIt was all just dirt,\u201d said Samuel Ho Chak-lam of St Paul\u2019s Co-educational College. \u201cThe only places where we saw actual dense tree coverage were the country parks we visited; the rest was bare.\u201d\n\nSeeing how islanders lived helped the students understand why this environmental damage happened, and how economics matters in developing countries.\n\nEnvironmental expert Dr Sung Yik-hei, who led the group, noted that environmental issues in Hong Kong are not the same as those faced by most people in Madagascar. \u201cThe real problem people face is that they need money to live, so they might cut down trees to farm or make pasture for cattle,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Hong Kong, the conflict might be with land developers, and not people\u2019s survival.\u201d\n\nFor many in Madagascar, deforestation is necessary for survival.

I was worried it was going to eat it,\u201d said Leung Lok-yan of HKMLC Queen Maud Secondary School.\n\nOne solution to a lack of funding for conservation is eco-tourism, and the group now realises how important education is to being a good ecotourist.\n\n\u201cHere [in Hong Kong] we have tours to find pink dolphins, but the boats make noise and people\u2019s actions, such as trying to touch the dolphins, causes disturbance,\u201d said Michael. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t go there with the mindset of \u2018we have to see them\u2019; instead, we should create minimal disturbance.\u201d\n\nMany of the students on the trip said they would be more environmentally conscious upon returning to Hong Kong.

Since returning to Hong Kong, Jessica Cheung Sum-yuet of Christian and Missionary Alliance Sun Kei Secondary School is keeping up with environmental news and following environment NGOs on Instagram. \u201cI\u2019ve made lifestyle changes like eating less fast food, where they use Brazilian meat, and starting to recycle,\u201d she said.\n\nThe group plans to spread their message to their families and schoolmates. \u201cWe have a responsibility to fix these issues and we need to raise awareness here in Hong Kong,\u201d said Jessica.", "description": "The teens took a life-changing trip to the African island and learned about the impact that economics has on global warming.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/madagascar1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
