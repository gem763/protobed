Cops Keep Using It to Arrest People.", "language": "en", "text": "Want the best of VICE News straight to your inbox? Sign up here.\n\nPolice across the country have used the same breed of shoddy $2 test to arrest people for cocaine that was really bird poop, meth that was actually crumbs from a glazed donut, and oxycodone that turned out to be vitamins.\n\nIn all of those cases, the possession or drug trafficking charges were eventually dropped after police sent the \u201cdrug\u201d samples to a state lab that returned more-conclusive results. The original tests, known as presumptive field tests, have a history of being almost laughably wrong \u2014 if they weren\u2019t putting people behind bars, even temporarily. And the follow-up lab tests that eventually clear people\u2019s names can take weeks, if not months.\n\nIn the meantime, innocent people may be spooked into taking a plea deal instead of risking a longer sentence at trial. And if they can\u2019t afford their bail, they\u2019ll languish in jail as they decide whether to take a guilty plea or wait on better test results.\n\nCody Gregg, a homeless man in Oklahoma City, took the guilty plea in early October, supposedly because he wanted to get out of the city\u2019s problem-plagued jail. Police charged him with possession after a field test incorrectly identified powdered milk inside a clear baggie as cocaine. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison and had been in jail for nearly two months before drug-lab results cleared him.\n\n\u201cYou cannot indict somebody \u2014 put somebody in jail \u2014 over something you know has a very high rate of false positives,\u201d Omar Bagasra, a biology professor at Claflin University and director of the South Carolina Center for Biotechnology. \u201cIt\u2019s ignorance.\u201d\n\nREAD: This Cleveland woman could go to jail because her house needs a new coat of paint\n\nBagasra once participated in a study for the Marijuana Policy Project that found a common brand of police field tests incorrectly identified patchouli, spearmint, and eucalyptus as weed. His team even warned about \u201cthe serious possibility of tens of thousands of wrongful drug convictions.\u201d\n\nIn an attempt to showcase just how faulty the tests were, the research team went before the National Press Club and repeatedly produced false positives for mundane things like chocolate bars.\n\n\u2018A large group of false positives\u2019\n\nThe most common presumptive field tests only cost a few dollars and are supposedly simple to use. That\u2019s why they\u2019re widely favored by police across the country and lead to thousands of arrests each year, according to a 2016 ProPublica investigation. The tests, however, have their downsides: They\u2019re often not admissible in court, which is why police have to order follow-up testing from a lab.\n\nTo complete the field test, all an officer usually has to do is drop a sample of the suspect substance into a little pouch, break a capsule containing compounds that cause a chemical reaction, and wait a few moments. The pouch turns a specific color to alert the officer that drugs may be present.\n\nThe problem, according to Bagasra, is that the catalyzers, known as reagents, can positively react to a wide variety of chemicals but can\u2019t distinguish to an officer what they might be reacting to. Plus, the colors the tests produce can be subjective, especially in bad lighting. (About 1 in 12 men are colorblind, and 88% of cops are men.)\n\n\"You cannot indict somebody \u2014 put somebody in jail \u2014 over something you know has a very high rate of false positives.\"\n\nFor example, the formula often used by local police to test for cocaine, cobalt thiocyanate, will likely turn a bright shade of blue when interacting with things like Benadryl or pain relievers, according to an online manual for Ohio\u2019s state crime lab. Under the test\u2019s description, the lab writes that there \u201cis a large group of false positives.\u201d\n\nThat same test has incorrectly labeled drywall, laundry detergent, and whey protein powder as cocaine, resulting in arrests across the country.\n\nPlus, instead of being used in a sterile lab, the tests are often quickly used on the side of the road, in a cop car, or at the local jail, where they can be misinterpreted under bad lighting. The tests also often rely on cops \u2014 not well-trained scientists \u2014 to administer them.\n\nThe DOJ's Warning\n\nIn 2000, the Justice Department issued guidelines requesting the tests\u2019 manufacturers include warning labels telling cops that the tests could produce false positives and therefore require appropriate training. But ProPublica\u2019s investigation found those guidelines were largely ignored. Newer, more accurate tests are available, but police departments don\u2019t typically buy them because they can cost tens of thousands of dollars.\n\n\u201cIf officers are not trained to get the message that a positive drug test is more equivocal than the label would make you think, you\u2019ll have police officers thinking, \u2018Positive means it\u2019s definitely drugs,\u2019\u201d said Carl Takei, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU\u2019s Trone Center for Justice and Equality. Instead, a positive result means that the presence of drugs can\u2019t be ruled out but should be weighed with plenty of other evidence before officers proceed.\n\nOklahoma City Police told VICE News that the officers did weigh other evidence in Gregg\u2019s August arrest for possessing the powdered milk that tested positive for cocaine.\n\nFor example, Gregg had a prior history of drug convictions and ran from police when they attempted to stop him for a missing taillight on his bicycle. Once they retrieved the backpack he was carrying, they found the clear bag of a \u201cwhite powdery substance\u201d and a scale, too. All of those things factored into his arrest \u2014 not just the presumptive drug test.\n\nREAD: Horrific footage shows California police shooting a teen in the back of the head. Cops Say It Was Justified.\n\n\u201cField testing of possible drugs by officers is a presumptive test only and is simply one part of the totality of the circumstances that can lead an officer to believe that enough probable cause exists to legally effect an arrest,\u201d Capt. Larry Withrow, a spokesperson for the Oklahoma City Police Department, told VICE News in an email.\n\nNonetheless, Withrow said: \u201cWe are reviewing our presumptive test procedures to determine if improvements can be made in this area.\u201d He added that the department hasn\u2019t had any problems with field tests before.\n\nIn Tulsa County, Oklahoma, about 100 miles away from where Gregg was arrested, public defender Natalie Leone said she handles a drug case with false positives from field tests about once a month.\n\nThis past May, Tulsa police found one of her clients, Carl Fisher, with a glass container of liquid that tested positive for meth in the field. Fisher, who\u2019s homeless, was asleep in a car in a residential parking lot when officers approached him with guns drawn because they considered the car stolen. They tased him multiple times and dragged him out of the car, body-camera footage shows.\n\nFisher was arrested on drug charges, resisting arrest, and assault on a police officer. He was behind bars for nearly two months on what was initially a $160,000 bail before state lab results cleared him. He then remained in jail until October, when he agreed to plead no contest to the charge of resisting arrest.\n\n\u201cReform to the bond system would really help, so that you\u2019re not waiting in custody for lab results, at least,\u201d Leone said.\n\nCover image: A bag of cocaine (Lino Mirgeler/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images)", "description": "Donut crumbs also once tested positive for meth.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5db31cebad771d00920f2fff/lede/1572019469226-AP_18175621944058.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8454xh;0xw,0.0323xh&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
