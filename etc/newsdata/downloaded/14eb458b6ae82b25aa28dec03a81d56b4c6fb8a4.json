Entertainment Inc.\n\nHe\u2019s a joker, he\u2019s a smoker, he\u2019s a midnight toker, and he\u2019s reportedly also a petty lil\u2019 thespian who thinks he owns the trademark for the clown prince of crime. Per some juicy intel over at THR, Jared Leto, who portrayed the Joker in 2016\u2019s much reviled Suicide Squad, was so pissed off that Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s standalone Joker origin drama was greenlit at Warner Bros. that he tried to get the studio to \u201ckill\u201d the film. Leto\u2019s \u201calienated and upset\u201d behavior, THR explains, stemmed from the actor wanting his own standalone Joker film, which was being teased as a possibility as recently as last year. (Now, the likelihood of his own Harlequin of Hate movie is slim to none, and he feels he was unfairly \u201cstrung along.\u201d) Leto\u2019s behind-the-scenes behavior while filming Suicide Squad \ufeff\u2014 which included sending castmates disgusting \u201cgifts\u201d such as dead rats, anal beads, and semen-soaked magazines \u2014 also apparently didn\u2019t win him any favors with the studio.
