For the counterargument, click here.\n\nBARCELONA \u2014 The Spanish Supreme Court\u2019s decision to put 12 Catalan leaders behind bars should raise alarm bells in Europe.\n\nThe former members of the Catalan government, the former president of the Catalan parliament and two grassroots leaders face a combined 100 years in jail. Their offense: conducting a debate in the Catalan parliament, holding a referendum that was not outlawed by the Spanish constitution, and allowing people to vote on whether they want independence from the Spanish state.\n\nThey exercised their civic rights in a peaceful and democratic manner. And yet they were put on trial and sentenced for expressing and standing by their political views. That this happened right in the heart of Europe, in the 21st century, should raise serious concerns about the strength of democracy in Europe.\n\nThe outcome of the trial represents a historic error made by Spain. Far from putting the issue to rest, this judgment will only worsen the current state of affairs.\n\nThe government of Catalonia believes that a solution can be found through talks and ballots.\n\nThe Catalan government and the Catalan society as a whole have always pursued a democratic solution to the political issue between Catalonia and Spain. The Spanish government\u2019s attempt to resolve the crisis through court orders and prison cells will never provide a solution to this problem. Jailing political opponents is not a solution.\n\nThere is only one way forward: dialogue. We have been working toward this goal for several years. The European Parliament and international intermediaries around Europe have also called for establishing talks between Catalan and Spanish leaders to resolve the issue.\n\nSadly, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez is not committed to breaking the deadlock through dialogue. This became obvious after the state prosecutor\u2019s office and the attorney general\u2019s office \u2014 two bodies directly affiliated with the Spanish government \u2014 decided to charge Catalan leaders with rebellion, rather than the lesser charge of sedition at the start of the trial in February.\n\nSome thought S\u00e1nchez\u2019s premiership would deescalate the conflict, but we have realized, that the prime minister has neither the will nor the capacity to move things in a positive direction.\n\nThe government of Catalonia believes that a solution can be found through talks and ballots, and we will not stop in our efforts to pursue a resolution. Those convicted do not belong in prison. The Spanish government is wrong to criminalize voting and to seek to resolve the conflict through sheer force or the courts.\n\nThe outcome of the trial is undemocratic and has made a solution that keeps Catalan within the state of Spain even more difficult to achieve. It also means the issue is no longer a domestic one. The Spanish government\u2019s use of the courts to resolve this conflict makes this a European crisis.\n\nEurope and the international community should take an active role in helping to come up with a viable solution to the conflict between Catalonia and Spain. Either the world intervenes \u2014 or the conflict will intensify.\n\nWe appeal to the international community to speak up and to, once and for all, demand a democratic and negotiated solution. Fundamental rights are at stake in Europe, and European democrats cannot afford to remain silent.\n\nThe citizens of Catalonia should be able to decide their future by voting without fearing oppression. Democracy must prevail. The welfare of future generations depends on this, and not just in Catalonia or Spain.\n\nEurope, now it\u2019s up to you.\n\nAlfred Bosch is minister for foreign action of the government of Catalonia.", "description": "Spain\u2019s decision to jail political opponents is undemocratic.", "authors": ["Alfred Bosch", "Diego Torres"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1175842670-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
