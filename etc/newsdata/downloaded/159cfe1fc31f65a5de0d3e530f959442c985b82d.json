We want to create spaces where people can enjoy the active environment as much as possible from a safe distance.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time tourists have swapped safety for the perfect snap.\n\nIn April, too many dangerous selfies forced the closure of the outdoor carriage on New Zealand\u2019s iconic Coastal Pacific train.\n\nThe 350km route between Picton and Christchurch takes in some of the South Island\u2019s most beautiful scenery, which tourists frequently tried and capture from the train\u2019s viewing carriage.\n\nHowever, travellers were putting their lives at risk by leaning out of the carriage to take selfies, photos and videos of the landscape.\n\n\u201cDespite the number of signs and announcements on board our trains pointing out the dangers of this, we have seen passengers leaning out with selfie sticks, iPads and their bodies, often unaware of an approaching tunnel which could cause a tragic incident for themselves, and others in the carriage,\u201d said Katie McMahon, general manager of KiwiRail group, which operates the service.", "description": "A couple visiting New Zealand endangered their lives to get the perfect picture\u00a0by posing next to boiling thermal springs.
