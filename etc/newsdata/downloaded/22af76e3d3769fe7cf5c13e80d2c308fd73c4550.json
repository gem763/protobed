It was a battle to be seen as something else.\n\nMiller is currently in a relationship with Lucas Zwirner, son of New York gallery founder David Zwirner. She has a six-year-old daughter, Marlowe, with her former fiance, actor Tom Sturridge, with whom she remains close.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s at the house and he\u2019s going to stay there tonight,\u201d Miller said of Sturridge, explaining that the two are co-parenting Marlowe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s a structure for custody,\u201d the 37-year-old continued. \u201cWe make it work. It\u2019s not conventional.\u201d\n\nThe November issue of ELLE UK is on sale from Thursday 3 October 2019.", "description": "Sienna Miller has claimed that disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein reduced her to tears in her early career after he told her to refrain from \u201cpartying\u201d. \u201cHe called me in to his office \u2013 he had just bought [2006\u2019s Factory Girl].
