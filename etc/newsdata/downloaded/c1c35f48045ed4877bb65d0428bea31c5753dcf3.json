Dogs are not allowed on public transport, the regulation said.\n\nHengshui's move comes after complaints about pet dogs in recent years, such as scaring people and polluting the environment and public areas with dog waste. Many cities in China have rolled out dog-related regulations to tackle these problems.\n\nA microblog user on Sina Weibo named YYnrznr, commented that the regulations are nice, but need to be carried out thoroughly. Otherwise, there will be no improvement.\n\nHowever, some dog owners find the regulation a little too much. Yang Xue, a 30-year-old who raises dogs, and has a bulldog and a teddy bear dog, said the regulation shouldn't limit the number of pet dogs.\n\n\"As long as the owners can raise the dog without influencing others and the environment, they should have the freedom to own more dogs,\" she said.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/15/5da579e3a310cf3e97a154eb.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
