Even less so is the team at the top: the defending champion New England Patriots. The Patriots received eight of the 12 first-place votes for 376 points in balloting Tuesday by media members who regularly cover the NFL.\n\nThe Patriots will begin their quest for a seventh Super Bowl on Sunday night when they host the Pittsburgh Steelers. The two teams are tied for the most with six.\n\n\u201cThe defending champs have a chance to make it to three straight Super Bowls, and who\u2019s going to say they don\u2019t have a chance? Even with a 42-year-old quarterback and a 67-year-old coach,\u201d Newsday\u2019s Bob Glauber said of Tom Brady and Bill Belichick.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs, who lost to the Patriots at home in overtime of the AFC championship game, earned two first-place votes for 357 points.\n\n\u201cDid defensive coordinators come any closer in the offseason to figuring out how to stop Patrick Mahomes?\u201d Charean Williams of Pro Football Talk asked of the reigning league MVP.\n\nThe New Orleans Saints and the Los Angeles Rams, who met in the NFC championship game, each received a first-place vote and were third and fourth, respectively.\n\n\u201cAfter two excruciating playoff setbacks, the Saints are poised to represent the NFC in Miami Feb. 2,\u201d said Ira Kaufman of Fox 13 in Tampa, Florida.\n\nThose two teams started a run of five consecutive teams from the NFC in the poll.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles and Chicago Bears, who faced off in a memorable NFC wild-card game last season, followed at Nos. 5 and 6, respectively. The Eagles advanced when Cody Parkey missed a 43-yard field goal in the final seconds. The Bears have Eddy Pineiro as their kicker now as they host the rival Green Bay Packers on Thursday night in the NFL\u2019s regular-season opener.\n\n\u201cSecondary issues critical with (Vic) Fangio gone,\u201d Fox Sports\u2019 John Czarnecki said of the former Bears defensive coordinator who was hired in the offseason to be the head coach of the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks follow at No. 7 after making a big trade for defensive lineman Jadeveon Clowney last weekend.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers will have a different look on offense this season now that wide receiver Antonio Brown is with the Raiders and running back Le\u2019Veon Bell with the New York Jets. They will start the season at No. 8.\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers and the Dallas Cowboys, teams that both lost in the divisional round of the playoffs last season, are tied at No. 9 to round out the top 10 teams.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The NFL's final four teams at the end of last season will start off as the top four going into the start of the 2019 season.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Simmi Buttar"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/03/giants_patriots_football_20754_c0-239-4565-2900_s1770x1032.jpg?e65f68964e0cab83c9884546a1450ac69198aed0"}
