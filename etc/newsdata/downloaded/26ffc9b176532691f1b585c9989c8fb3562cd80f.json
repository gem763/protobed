Apparently Sanjay Gupta was finalised to direct the fourth installment of the film. However, this rumour hasn\u2019t gone down well with Rakesh Roshan.\n\nTwitter\n\nIn an interaction with Bollywood Hungama, he refuted these rumours and said, \u201cEven I am reading the same rumours as you and I don\u2019t know who is writing it. Of course, I will direct it.\"\n\n\"Sanjay Gupta is writing the script with me and (is) with me all the time. We both discuss things as our thoughts are very similar and we are working together in this. Even Sanjay is a very fine director, did a very good job with Kaabil and I am very proud of him. Right now, he is busy with his Mumbai Saga shoot\u201d.\n\nTwitter\n\nDon't Miss 9.4 K SHARES 3.8 K SHARES 41.1 K SHARES 10 K SHARES 8.2 K SHARES\n\nWe're sure all Krrish fans are relieved to haer this. The filmmaker even said he will announce the film once he is sure about the script:\n\n\u201cI will only announce it once I am sure about the script. When I am 100 perc ent sure about the script, I will announce as a director. The day I decide to make it, it will take me one more year to start the film. Being a big film in terms of vision and VFX, the preproduction will take a lot of time. Mine is the only franchise which is going from story to story. It\u2019s not just the names I am using to make into another film. While Hollywood can afford budgets, we can score on emotions. Three breathtaking emotional action scenes will score over 10 mindless action sequences.\u201d\n\nTwitter\n\nHere's hoping we seen Krrish 4 soon.", "description": "Of late there has been a lot of buzz that Rakesh Roshan might not direct his favourite franchise film and that is Krrish, apparently, Sanjay Gupta was finalised to direct the fourth installment of the film.
