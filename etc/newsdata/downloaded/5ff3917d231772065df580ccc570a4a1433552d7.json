Make the environmentally friendly choice when buying your cuppa. 01 Oct 2019\n\n\n\n\n\nHave you ever wondered about the environmental impact of your daily cappuccino? Well, it\u2019s said that if you buy a single takeaway cup of coffee each day, you\u2019ll generate over 10kg of waste a year. That\u2019s not all \u2013 an astounding 99% of paper coffee cups are not recycled.\n\nALSO READ: Here are the SA coffee shops that encourage you to reduce waste\n\nMost paper cups used for coffee aren\u2019t biodegradable, as they have a polyethylene plastic lining to make them leakproof. But, thanks to Mugg & Bean, you can have your daily dose of java and still help the world become greener. The restaurant brand with a nationwide footprint has invested in developing a strong, stylish and reliable paper coffee cup that won\u2019t harm the environment.\n\nThe Mugg & Bean Eco Cup is lined with polylactic acid \u2013 a plant starch-coated paper. This makes the cup leak-proof, biodegradable and compostable, meaning there\u2019s no damage to the environment, and no plastic bits entering our food chain.\n\n\u201cCoffee keeps us all going, but it\u2019s not good if we\u2019re making mother nature pay the price for that,\u201d says Thulani Mahlangu, Brand Manager at Mugg & Bean.\n\nBy supporting eco-friendly paper cups, you can help reverse the enormous number of cups that aren\u2019t recycled. Mugg & Bean Eco Cups can be composted at home or in industrial facilities, where microbes such as bacteria and fungi break down the plant-based material as their source of nutrition. How can you help take part in the eco cup revolution? Simply keep enjoying your morning Mugg & Bean brew, knowing that your cup will help replenish nature, not harm it.\n\nWATCH: 3D latte art is here and it's going to blow you away\n\n-", "description": "Make the environmentally friendly choice when buying your cuppa.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9420/5bd0ffa5c21845c0a2acfc9e276e85d0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
