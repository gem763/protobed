She is 17 and has a one-year-old baby on her back.\n\nThey all admit to being impregnated by older men.\n\nAccording to the residents of Setlagole village, this is just the tip of the iceberg of depressing cases of extreme poverty, child-headed families and teenage pregnancy in their area.\n\nThe village is part of Ratlou Local Municipality in North West.\n\nIn Numbers Total population: 106 108\n\nNumber of households: 129 000\n\nChild-headed households: 459 (headed by children younger than 18)\n\nChild-headedhouseholds\u2019 annual income: 41% have zero annual income\n\nTeen pregnancy figures\n\nThe municipality recently made news headlines when it was alleged that about 6 000 under-age girls were either pregnant or had already given birth, and that they were mostly impregnated by older men.\n\nNorth West social development MEC, Boitumelo Moiloa, during a community meeting last week, refuted the figure.\n\nShe said she had since gone to the clinics in the municipality to get the numbers.\n\n\u201cThere are, according to numbers from clinics, 487 of those who are pregnant or already have children. It is not a small number, it is too much and of great concern to us,\u201d Moiloa said.\n\nResidents who took to the podium to comment during the meeting expressed their concerns at the problem.\n\nThey also called for older men who sleep with and impregnate young girls to be brought to book.\n\n\u201cWhen a girl is impregnated by a boy her age, they are both scared. What more now if they are impregnated by older men? They are also in most cases threatened by these men not to tell the truth and say who the child\u2019s father is,\u201d said Setlagole resident, Maki Plaatjie.\n\nA teacher at a local primary school said the problem of teenage pregnancy was severe and confirmed there were several cases at his school.\n\n\u201cWe have child-headed families from where young girls would be targeted by older men. They would offer them money for sex and for them this is the only way to put food on the table,\u201d said school governing body member, Kabelo Maine.\n\nKgosi Ramoloko said young girls were finding it hard to resist temptation and asked for families to stop protecting perpetrators preying on vulnerable children.\n\n\u201cIf it is an uncle doing this to a niece, open a case and let the law take its course and stop concealing such incidents. Rape and teenage pregnancy are issues of serious concern, but how do we overcome them when we protect perpetrators?\u201d he asked.\n\nMeanwhile, police spokesperson Brigadier Sabata Mokgwabone said there had been 20 cases of rape in Setlagole alone since January.\n\nHe said seven of the victims were underage girls.\n\nThe municipal area\n\nRatlou itself is home to a population of just below 110 000 according to Census 2011 figures.\n\nParents and youngsters who spoke at the meeting last week complained of few employment opportunities and a lack of recreation activities and facilities to keep youngsters and children busy and away from bad things.\n\nAccording to Wazimap, which provides access to South African census and election data, only 15% of the Ratlou population is employed, 11% are discouraged job seekers and 61% are not economically active.\n\nFurther, 19% of the population\u2019s households have no income, only 2% have access to flushing toilets, 86% still use pit toilets and 10% have no access to toilets.\n\n\u201cLack of employment drives children to bad things. A lot of them go to work in the farms from where they come back pregnant,\u201d said local chief Michael Gontse.\n\nChild-headed families and babies\n\nAt Dirulelo\u2019s house, a door without a handle leads into a sparsely furnished room that could be some sort of a kitchen or perhaps a lounge, with two old broken couches.\n\nA crusty pot and a plate on a small table by the corner bear the only sign that a meal was consumed there at some point.\n\nHowever, it does not look as if that was from a day or even two days earlier, with the crust way too parched and loosening from the pot.\n\n\u201cWhere is your next meal coming from?\u201d\n\nThis is the question that changed Dirulelo\u2019s face as she stood in the room holding her baby.\n\nSuddenly, misery covered her face as her insouciant attitude evaporated.\n\nWe live from hand to mouth and it\u2019s all about hustling. My child\u2019s father is not supportive, but things are better now because I have a new boyfriend Teen mom\n\nDirulelo may be 19, but this household, which is dependent on zero income, would arguably fall under the category of child-headed households.\n\nBack to the question, Dirulelo kept quiet and Modise responded.\n\n\u201cWe are forced to walk a distance to our sickly grandmother\u2019s house to ask for some mealiemeal and to my father\u2019s house to borrow a stove so we can cook. If not, then we go to bed on empty stomachs \u2026 we\u2019ve got nothing and no one else to go to,\u201d she said.\n\nThe two girls said their children\u2019s fathers had abandoned them.\n\n\u201cWe live from hand to mouth and it\u2019s all about hustling. My child\u2019s father is not supportive, but things are better now because I have a new boyfriend who is a bit caring and does help sometimes,\u201d Dirulelo said.\n\nBoth girls chuckled when asked why and how they ended up pregnant.\n\n\u201cWe were still living on our own. Actually, we were having fun, and this is where we find ourselves,\u201d Dirulelo said.\n\n\u201cI am here, out of school and jobless; no ID and birth certificate and I have given up on ever returning to school as I now have a baby to feed and care for. I need help in getting my ID and registering my child for the social grant.\u201d\n\nShe said she had last seen her mother in 2015 and did not know where she was.\n\n\u201cLife is not easy for young mothers like us,\u201d she said.\n\nWould you go out and fall pregnant again?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d Dirulelo said after a brief pause and yet another chuckle.\n\n*Not her real name\n\nTALK TO US\n\nHow can older men with money be convinced not to entice vulnerable girls and leave them pregnant?\n\nSMS us on 35697 using the keyword PREGNANT and tell us what you think.
