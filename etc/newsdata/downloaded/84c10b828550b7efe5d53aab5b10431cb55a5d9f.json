A separate group of states announced an investigation into Facebook's dominance on Friday. The Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission and Congress are also conducting probes.\n\nRead more: Google says it's received a demand from the DOJ to hand over documents on past government probes of its business, and it expects more to come\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton has said only that the investigation will look at \"whether large tech companies have engaged in anticompetitive behavior that stifled competition, restricted access, and harmed consumers.\" Reports in The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal say Google will be the primary target.\n\nGoogle expects state attorneys general will ask it about past similar investigations in the US and internationally, senior vice president of global affairs Kent Walker wrote in a blog post Friday.\n\nExperts believe the antitrust probe could focus on at least one of three aspects of Google's business that have caught regulators' eyes.\n\n1. Advertising\n\nAn obvious first place to look could be online advertising. Google will control 31.1% of global digital ad dollars in 2019, according to eMarketer estimates, crushing a distant second place Facebook. And many smaller advertisers have argued that Google has such a stranglehold on the market that it becomes a system of whatever Google says, goes \u2014 because the alternative could be not reaching customers.\n\n\"There's definitely concern on the part of the advertisers themselves that Google wields way too much power in setting rates and favoring their own services over others,\" said Jen King, the director of privacy at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society.\n\nThe European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has hit Google with multiple antitrust fines over the past few years. REUTERS/Francois Lenoir\n\nCritics often point to Google's 2007 acquisition of online advertising company DoubleClick as pivotal to its advertising dominance.\n\nEurope's antitrust regulators slapped Google with a $1.7 billion fine in March unfairly inserting exclusivity clauses into contracts with advertisers, in the online advertising business.\n\n2. Search\n\nAnother visibly huge piece of Google's business is its search platform, often the starting point for millions of people when they go online. Google dwarfs other search competitors and has faced harsh criticism in the past for favoring its own products over competitors at the top of search results. European regulators have also investigated here \u2014 ultimately fining Google for promoting its own shopping service. Google is appealing the fine.\n\n\"On the one hand, you could just say, 'well Google is dominant because they're good,'\" King said. \"But at the same time, it's created an ecosystem where people's whole internet experience is mediated through Google's home page and Google's other products.\"\n\nOne outcome antitrust regulators might explore is forcing Google to spin off search as a separate company, she said.\n\n3. Android\n\nAnother acquisition of Google's, the Android operating system is the most widely used in the world.\n\nEuropean regulators have also fined Google to the tune of $5 billion for tactics involving Android, finding that Google forced handset makers to install Google apps, thereby increasing its reach. Google has since allowed more options for alternative browser and search apps to European Android phones.\n\nIt's also possible US states won't follow in Europe's footsteps. They could, for instance, focus on areas such as Google's popular video site YouTube, yet another acquisition Google made, that time in 2006.", "description": "An antitrust probe into Google by a group of states led by Texas' Attorney General Ken Paxton is expected to be announced on Monday.", "authors": ["Rachel Lerman", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5c18b13ad4beaf60bd6831c2-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
