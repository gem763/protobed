America\u2019s defeat there left a chasm between a foreign-policy establishment that still believed in America\u2019s Cold War commitments and a public weary of war. An article published the year before Reagan\u2019s election noted that foreign-policy \u201copinion leaders\u201d were 38 percentage points more likely than Americans as a whole to say the United States should deploy troops if the Soviets invaded western Europe, and 39 points more likely to support deploying them if the Soviets invaded Japan. As a result, Reagan\u2014although happy to send money and arms to anti-communist rebels and regimes in Central America\u2014was adamant that he would not send U.S. troops. Asked in 1982 what conditions might prompt him to deploy American forces to El Salvador, Reagan quipped, \u201cWell, maybe if they dropped a bomb on the White House, I might get mad.\u201d\n\nWhile his Democratic critics called him a warmonger, Reagan understood that no administration\u2014irrespective of ideology\u2014could thrive in the post-Vietnam environment if it risked a protracted foreign war. When terrorists blew up the Marine barracks housing U.S. peacekeepers in Beirut in October 1983, Reagan\u2019s poll numbers immediately fell. The following February, just days after launching his reelection campaign, Reagan decided to bring the marines home. \u201cOnce we pulled the troops out of Lebanon,\u201d Reagan\u2019s national campaign director later recalled, the election was \u201cnever close again.\u201d\n\nWhat was true for Reagan is true for Trump. He viscerally understands something that many of his party\u2019s foreign-policy wonks do not: After Iraq, the public has little appetite for war. In the Republican primaries, this realization helped him defeat hawkish rivals such as Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. \u201cI\u2019m the only one on this stage that said, \u2018Do not go into Iraq,\u2019\u201d Trump boasted (falsely) at a debate in February 2016. At a rally a few days later, he invoked his supposed opposition to Iraq as evidence that he alone could be trusted not to launch new wars. \u201cPeople talk about me with the button,\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cI\u2019m the one that doesn\u2019t want to do this.\u201d Like Reagan, Trump understood that while Republican voters favored spending money on the military, they didn\u2019t\u2014absent a direct attack on Americans\u2014want to use it. \u201cWe have to have a great military,\u201d Trump declared early in the campaign, \u201cbut we have to focus on ourselves.\u201d\n\nTrump also understands something else: While many Republican foreign-policy wonks still favor a larger American military footprint overseas, the conservative-media ecosystem has shifted dramatically as a result of Iraq. The most prominent right-wing pundits are now more isolationist than interventionist. And these anti-interventionist pundits\u2014who serve as a link between Trump and his base\u2014constantly remind him that he campaigned on ending wars, not starting them.", "description": "Presidents who take office in the shadow of unpopular wars don\u2019t tolerate warlike advisers for very long.", "authors": ["Peter Beinart", "Professor Of Journalism At The City University Of New York"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTS2Q0VP/facebook.jpg?1568222324", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
