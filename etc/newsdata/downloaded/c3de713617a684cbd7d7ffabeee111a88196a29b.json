The company added that its \u201cdecision is also reflective of developing regulations in a growing number of states and municipalities.\u201d\n\nThe same day, a Kroger spokesperson told HuffPost that it is following suit.\n\n\u201cKroger is discontinuing the sale of electronic nicotine delivery products, or e-cigarettes, at all store and fuel center locations due to the mounting questions and increasingly-complex regulatory environment associated with these products,\u201d the representative said. \u201cThe company will exit this category after selling through its current inventory.\u201d\n\nThe announcements come less than three weeks after Walmart said it would no longer sell e-cigarettes, citing growing \u201cregulatory complexity and uncertainty\u201d around vaping. The action applies also to its Sam\u2019s Club stores.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, 1,080 cases of lung injury linked to e-cigarette use had been reported from 48 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands as of Oct. 1. Within 15 states, 18 deaths have been confirmed.\n\nIn all of these cases, patients reported a history of vaping, most with products containing THC, the ingredient in marijuana that creates a high. However, no single substance or product has yet been linked to all cases.\n\nAs federal, state and local agencies continue searching for answers, Michigan and New York have slapped temporary bans on flavored e-cigarettes. In Massachusetts, a temporary ban encompasses all vaping products, both flavored and non-flavored in addition to those containing marijuana and THC.", "description": "The stores are the latest to stop selling the products as health officials probe a nationwide outbreak of lung illnesses and deaths.", "authors": ["Trends Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9bbabd2100009004abafde.jpeg?cache=ibjv8s3egy&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
