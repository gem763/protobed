The company had about 17,750 employees at the end of 2018.\n\nIt said it would invest heavily in new non-beer products, after launching a canned wine and a hard coffee in 2019, as it looks to cushion the impact from waning beer demand across the globe.\n\nIn a move to broaden its product offerings, the company said starting 2020 it would be known as Molson Coors Beverage Co.\n\n\u201cOur business is at an inflection point. We can continue down the path we\u2019ve been on for several years now, or we can make the significant and difficult changes necessary to get back on the right track,\u201d Chief Executive Officer Gavin Hattersley said in a statement.\n\nThe company also reported its third-quarter revenue and profit below Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, sending its shares down about 2% in premarket trading.", "description": "Molson Coors Brewing Co said on Wednesday it plans to cut hundreds of jobs, streamline its operations and expand its product line beyond beers as it restructures its business.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
