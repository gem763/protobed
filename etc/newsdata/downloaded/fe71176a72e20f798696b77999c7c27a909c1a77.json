Collyer of Washington, D.C., last year had opened the way for Bilal Abdul Kareem, a freelance journalist who grew up in New York, to seek answers in his civil case from the government and to try to clear his name after what he claims were five near-misses by U.S. airstrikes in Syria.\n\nCollyer in June 2018 ruled that Abdul Kareem, who said he was mistaken for a militant because of his frequent contact with militants linked to al-Qaeda, was exercising his constitutional right to due process in court.\n\nBut after talks between Abdul Kareem\u2019s lawyers and U.S. authorities broke down, the government tapped the rarely invoked state secrets authority, saying Abdul Kareem sought information revealing \u201cthe existence and operational details of alleged military and intelligence activities directed at combating the terrorist threat to the United States.\u201d\n\nIn a 14-page opinion, Collyer said she was bound to agree, saying the government\u2019s right to withhold information in such instances is \u201cabsolute.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat constitutional right is more essential than the right to due process before the government may take a life? While the answer may be none, federal courts possess limited authority to resolve questions presented in a lawsuit, even when they are alleged to involve constitutional rights. This is such a case,\u201d Collyer wrote, adding, \u201cDespite the serious nature of Plaintiff\u2019s allegations, this Court must dismiss the action pursuant to the government\u2019s invocation of the state secrets privilege.\u201d\n\nProsecutors said that disclosing whether Abdul Kareem is on the \u201ckill list\u201d could permit him to evade capture or further U.S. action, and also could risk revealing or compromising intelligence sources and methods.\n\nCollyer at a May 2018 hearing in Abdul Kareem\u2019s case questioned whether national security concerns trump individuals\u2019 rights in the U.S. \u00adtargeted-killing program, a question left open by courts since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks . On Tuesday, the judge credited the government for engaging \u201cin months of consideration\u201d before providing \u201creasoned declarations\u201d supporting its views.\n\nIn \u2018kill list\u2019 case, judge questions government\u2019s unilateral authority to kill U.S. citizens abroad\n\nCollyer noted that if Abdul Kareem were to face criminal prosecution, the government would be required to disclose classified information important to his defense. But she said that no such requirement applies to offset the state secret privilege in a civil case.\n\nThe judge also said it was not up to the courts to adopt Abdul Kareem\u2019s attorneys\u2019 proposal that people placed on the \u201ckill list\u201d should have the same due-process protections as organizations designated as terrorists by the State or Treasury departments.\n\nIn a statement, Abdul Kareem\u2019s attorneys said, \u201cWe are very disappointed in today\u2019s decision,\u201d which they said \u201crenders the right to due process effectively meaningless for Mr. Kareem.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the first time ever, a United States federal court ruled that the government may kill one of its citizens without providing him the information necessary to prove that he is being wrongly targeted and does not deserve to die,\u201d attorney Tara J. Plochocki said. \u201cThe U.S. Government could have provided this information but chose not to and the Court found that the Government\u2019s assertion of national security trumps his right not to be killed.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nJudge allows journalist to challenge claimed inclusion on U.S. drone \u2018kill list\u2019\n\nIn \u2018kill list\u2019 case, judge questions government\u2019s unilateral authority to kill U.S. citizens abroad\n\nThe killing of Anwar al-Awlaki: The White House\u2019s drone attack policy\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "In first, court rules government can withhold information from journalist who alleges being placed on list and that his constitutional right to due process is being violated.", "authors": ["Spencer S.
