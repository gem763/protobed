It is still in trial and expected to be made publicly available next fiscal year, which starts in April.\n\nThe app's developers including Yoshiaki Hisada, a professor at Kogakuin University, are aiming to make it issue warnings to registered users one minute before an earthquake occurring some 200 kilometers away reaches the building they are in.\n\n\"While new skyscrapers rarely sustain damage that would require people to evacuate even if it swings greatly, we want people to assess the situation calmly,\" said Hisada.\n\nApp users need to register the structure of their buildings and which floors they are in for it to issue warnings before the motion hits them. The predictions will be based on data provided by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience.\n\n\u00a9 KYODO", "description": "Japanese researchers have created a new app for predicting damage to skyscrapers likely to be caused by long-period ground motion from major earthquakes in distant areas, such as the swaying that hit Tokyo after a massive quake in northeast Japan in 2011.
