He\u2019s got a Christmas single coming out, he\u2019s doing WWE wrestling - his heads gone completely but he\u2019s absolutely living life, so good luck to him.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s packing up boxing, I really think that he\u2019s looking at it and thinking 'I\u2019ve made a nice few quid over the last few fights, I\u2019m enjoying life.'\n\n\u201cI just think he\u2019s looking at this other world and going 'do you know what, this is a lot more fun than getting my head punched and going into camp.'\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019ll fight again but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s got the hunger.\n\n(Image: WWE)\n\nWatch our new boxing show After The Bell Mirror Fighting has launched a new weekly boxing show in association with Betfair in which we analyse the latest big fights, play matchmaker, and preview forthcoming bouts.
