High winds are forecast in the region from late Tuesday through Thursday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nPG&E and other California utilities have been taking more aggressive measures to keep equipment from sparking blazes after power lines ignited a series of catastrophic fires in 2017 and 2018. For PG&E, the stakes are especially high. Another major fire sparked by its equipment could upend its restructuring plans by creating new claims that would take priority over existing ones.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Unprecedented warning", "authors": ["Will Wade", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/camp-fire.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
