The expensive regalia she wore when she graduated with her PhD was also destroyed by mold. \u201cI consider my office to be a complete loss.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nFifteen professors in U-Md.\u2019s anthropology department have battled mold, and the health complications that come with it, for years, said department chair Paul Shackel. He started keeping a log of mold-related episodes in 2015.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIt affects teaching, it affects the morale of people, and people are kind of discouraged because this has been going on for a while,\u201d Shackel said. \u201cThe university is taking steps, but the steps, I don\u2019t think, are big enough.\u201d\n\nComplaints about mold in the academic building have a familiar ring: A year ago, nearly 600 students were displaced from their on-campus housing at U-Md. because of a mold outbreak \u2014 an outbreak that sparked criticism of the university\u2019s administration.\n\nAD\n\nAmid the mold infestation, dozens of students developed adenovirus infections, and an 18-year-old freshman died of complications from the virus. Mold does not cause adenovirus infections but can set the stage for other health problems. The director of the university health center, in emails to administrators last year, acknowledged that \u201cmold can cause respiratory irritation that may increase susceptibility of any viral infection.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nProfessors in the anthropology department say they regularly carry wipes to clean mold from the walls and furniture in their offices. Some try their best to avoid their offices, opting to work from home.\n\nU-Md. in recent years has spent nearly $500,000 on efforts to control moisture in Woods Hall, including waterproofing, dehumidifiers, window sealing and a new drainage system, university spokeswoman Katie Lawson said in an email.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe care deeply for the well-being of our community, and we are working closely with faculty members in Woods Hall on interim measures and permanent solutions to address moisture control,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cWe are currently finalizing a plan to relocate faculty offices.\u201d\n\nFacilities Management, the department that oversees campus infrastructure and repairs, said in a statement that it has installed rain guards and provided mold remediation services.\n\nAD\n\nBut the issues persist, faculty members say.\n\nThe anthropology department\u2019s location in the basement of Woods Hall makes it prone to humidity. Mold thrives in damp conditions, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nAD\n\nJen Shaffer, an assistant professor in the anthropology department, said she tries to stay away from her office. She has offered to hold Skype meetings with students while she works at home.\n\n\u201cI feel bad because I prefer a face-to-face meeting,\u201d Shaffer said. \u201cI feel kind of nervous with students coming in and out of my office. I don\u2019t know what their medical histories are, and it could be potentially dangerous.\u201d\n\nSangaramoorthy also prefers to work at home. She said she reconfigured her teaching schedule this semester to limit her time on campus to two days a week.\n\nShe and other faculty have experienced health-related issues. Shackel developed skin rashes. For Shaffer, it\u2019s her sinuses.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI know when I walk into the building, I can start to feel my sinuses clog up,\u201d Shaffer said. \u201cOverall, my eyes get all gluey, and you just get this pressure building up in your head.\u201d\n\nShackel, upon visiting a dermatologist three years ago, was prescribed a steroid cream. Only recently did he consider his issues could be attributed to the mold growing in his department.\n\nSangaramoorthy, who said she had never experienced allergies before coming to U-Md., watched as skin peeled from her fingers when she tried to clean the mold in her office. Her skin got so sensitive it would puff up when she touched it.\n\nShe went to an allergist who indicated the associate professor\u2019s skin condition was the \u201ccumulative effect of years of being exposed\u201d to mold, Sangaramoorthy said.\n\nAD\n\nWoods Hall is one of the older buildings on the College Park campus. It was built in 1948, according to the university\u2019s website.\n\nAD\n\nThe academic building is scheduled to undergo renovations at some point between 2021 and 2030, according to the campus facilities master plan. The document doesn\u2019t provide information on what those renovations will include.\n\nIn 2014, Facilities Management replaced drywall and caulked window sills with waterproof sealant to address moisture problems, according to a statement from the facilities department. Floor fans and dehumidifiers were installed and more insulation work was done in 2016 and 2017.\n\nFacilities Management continues to monitor mold growth in the building.\n\nAD\n\nIn February, the student newspaper, the Diamondback, reported that U-Md. will renovate 16 dorms to prevent more outbreaks.\n\nMeanwhile, professors in the basement of Woods Hall will do what they can to stay healthy this school year.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI\u2019m owed a very sort of safe workplace environment where I can actually feel comfortable coming to,\u201d Sangaramoorthy said. She just returned from a year-long sabbatical. She said her symptoms disappeared while she was away.\n\n\u201cThe minute I start having issues again, I\u2019m gone.\u201d\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news\n\nAD", "description": "Fifteen professors in the anthropology department complain of mold, mildew and moisture.", "authors": ["Lauren Lumpkin", "Reporting Fellow Focusing On Local Education Issues"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/DO2FkaO8CnSJdeMU3pGTSPFgQYo=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/MCMR2YHG64I6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
