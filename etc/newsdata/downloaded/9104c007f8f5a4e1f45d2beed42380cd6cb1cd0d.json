That vessel was released in August.\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told the TV that the seven, who include Indian citizens, were allowed to leave the tanker on humanitarian grounds and could leave Iran soon.\n\n\u201cWe have no problem with the crew and the captain and the issue is violations that the vessel committed,\u201d Mousavi said.\n\nThe Stena Impero\u2019s 23 seafarers are of Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino nationality, the vessel\u2019s Swedish owner Stena Bulk has said.\n\n\u201cWe are very pleased that for seven crew members their ordeal may soon be over, and they may return to their families, however we cautiously await official confirmation of their release date,\u201d Erik Hanell, Stena Bulk\u2019s president and chief executive, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe view this communication as a positive step on the way to the release of all the remaining crew, which has always been our primary concern and focus.\u201d\n\nThe company said the remaining 16 crew members would remain onboard to safely operate the vessel.\n\nVESSELS ATTACKED\n\nBob Sanguinetti, chief executive of the UK Chamber of Shipping trade association, said Iran had to immediately release the remaining mariners once the seven crew had been freed.\n\n\u201cThe ship was in international waters when it was detained and was in full compliance with all navigation and international regulations,\u201d Sanguinetti said.\n\n\u201cThe Chamber will continue to work with the UK Government to ensure the free passage of ships through the Strait of Hormuz.\u201d\n\nSeveral international merchant vessels have been attacked in the Gulf this year in incidents that have rocked world commodity trading. Washington blames Iran, which denies the accusation.\n\nIran has denounced U.S. efforts to set up a coalition and says countries in the region can protect waterways and work towards signing a non-aggression pact.\n\nThe seizure of the Adrian Darya 1 Iranian tanker exacerbated tensions between Tehran and the West that have been growing since the United States last year quit an international accord curbing Iran\u2019s nuclear program and reimposed economic sanctions.\n\nThe Revolutionary Guards said separately on Wednesday that its navy detained seven trawling vessels with 24 foreign crew near the mouth of the Gulf for fishing too close to Iran\u2019s coast and other violations, the ISNA news agency reported.\n\nA Guards statement did not give the crews\u2019 nationalities, but Iranian media have often carried reports of complaints from local fishermen about Chinese ships active in bottom trawling, which involves dragging a large net across the sea floor.", "description": "Iran will free seven crew members of the detained British-flagged tanker Stena Impero, Iranian state television reported on Wednesday, although the vessel's owner said it had yet to receive any official confirmation of the release date.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426116689&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830YA-OCATP"}
