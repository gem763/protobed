Take solace in Amazon Prime\u2019s \u201cFleabag,\u201d a rare gem of a show that won outstanding comedy series. It\u2019s British and brilliant, and has gained in popularity all year long as more and more viewers raved about it to their friends. People telling you to watch \u201cFleabag\u201d aren\u2019t any more annoying than all those people who told you to watch \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d right?\n\nNow, with that business out of the way, let\u2019s talk about these hostless awards shows: It doesn\u2019t always work out so well, does it?\n\n\u201cYou know what has a host?\u201d asked ABC\u2019s late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, called to the stage at one point to present a category with his CBS rival, Stephen Colbert. \u201cApplebee\u2019s has a host.\u201d\n\nBoth men have hosted past Emmy Awards shows, and although they were joking about the absence of one, the night\u2019s proceedings actually validated their digs. \u201cYou know who the real victims are, here?\u201d Colbert asked. \u201cUs.\u201d Followed by a joke that producers of awards shows might as well hand over all hosting duties to that ubiquitous in-home listening device, Alexa.\n\nAnd sure enough, the voice of Alexa butted in and presented the nominees. (Let\u2019s be careful here, guys. Too many awards shows like this one and Alexa really will get the job.)\n\nWhereas the most recent Academy Awards seemed to function well enough without a host, the producers of Fox\u2019s telecast decided to make a running gag of it from the get-go and throughout the night, dragging Homer Simpson, Anthony Anderson and Bryan Cranston into a sad opening bit about pinch-hitting and the glories of television and so on. It was the start of a sluggish and somewhat messy evening of odd segues and handoffs.\n\nMeanwhile, it was the viewer\u2019s good luck that the nominees in most of the categories were across-the-board stellar, representing some of the best TV made this century so far. TV is so good that we\u2019ve apparently added an \u201cin memoriam\u201d reel to the Emmy proceedings for all the shows that had their final seasons in the past year.\n\nGratifying victories for viewers and critics alike included Billy Porter\u2019s lead actor award for the FX drama \u201cPose\u201d (\u201cThe category is love, y\u2019all,\u201d Porter proclaimed in the voice of his character, Pray Tell, \u201cLOVE\u201d); a win for HBO\u2019s \u201cChernobyl\u201d for outstanding limited series; Jharrel Jerome\u2019s lead actor award for Netflix\u2019s limited series \u201cWhen They See Us\u201d; and Michelle Williams\u2019s lead actress award for her portrayal of Broadway legend Gwen Verdon in FX\u2019s limited series \u201cFosse/Verdon\u201d and her empowerment-laced, \u00adlisten-to-\n\nwomen and pay-them-equally acceptance speech. (Standing ovation for that.)\n\nAlex Borstein won her second consecutive supporting actress Emmy for Amazon Prime\u2019s comedy \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d \u2014 and she gave one of the evening\u2019s other rousing acceptance speeches, with a salute to the memory of her Holocaust-surviving grandmother, who had the courage, Borstein said, to step out of a firing-squad line. \u201cSo step out of line, ladies,\u201d Borstein said. \u201cStep out of line!\u201d\n\nAnother highlight were two more well-deserved Emmys for Phoebe Waller-Bridge, riding high now that everyone has found and fallen for \u201cFleabag.\u201d When she won one of the night\u2019s early awards, for comedy series writing, Waller-Bridge said, \u201cI find writing really, really hard and really painful, but I\u2019d like to say honestly from the bottom of my heart, the reason I do it is this.\u201d And she held up her shiny Emmy statuette. Cheeky thing.\n\nMinutes later she was back onstage, having won the best actress award for comedy \u2014 beating \u201cVeep\u2019s\u201d Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who stood to win her seventh Emmy for that show. Waller-Bridge accepted her second statuette and brilliantly began the same speech: \u201cI find acting really hard and really painful but it\u2019s really all about this.\u201d No wonder everybody adores her.\n\nBut back to the hostlessness problem. I like the idea in theory, but now we have an example of how it can go wrong in practice.\n\nAfter a promising early bit with Ben Stiller presenting lifelike wax figures of comedy legends George Burns, Lucille Ball and Bob Newhart (who, at 90, turned out to be alive and ticked off at the suggestion that he isn\u2019t), the evening\u2019s stabs at lighthearted non-hosting momentum began to sink. Precious time was given over to known attention whores, like late-night host James Corden, actor and cutup Ken Jeong (who attempted to make a Tik-Tok clip) and \u201cRighteous Gemstones\u201d co-star Adam DeVine, trying his best at the center of an intentionally bad musical number. If nothing else, a host could read the room and self-deprecate as necessary.\n\nAt one point even the production booth took a turn narrating the show. \u201cCue Kardashians,\u201d a woman in front of a wall of monitors commanded, and lo, they were cued \u2014 Kim Kardashian and Kendall Jenner, who elicited some guffaws from the audience by suggesting that reality TV depicts people as they really are. (Yeah, sure.)\n\nActor Thomas Lennon served as a sort of off-screen emcee and snappy snarker \u2014 a lousy assignment for such a likable and funny guy. He was saddled with terrible lines, such as: \u201cIt is now official, Patricia Arquette goes to the Emmy stage more frequently than she goes to Trader Joe\u2019s. (Arquette, who won supporting actress in a limited series for her role in \u201cThe Act,\u201d wasn\u2019t feeling so jokey, however, and instead gave a moving salute to her late sister, Alexis, a transgender activist and actor who died . . . in 2016.)\n\nAn awkward low point came when the stars of \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d on hand to kick off the presentation of the limited-series categories, were stiffly lined up on the stage and forced to read lines about their feelings about the end of their blockbuster run. They looked like they\u2019d rather be anyplace else \u2014 and that\u2019s weird, because this is supposed to be their last big night together, after a year of final folderol. Maybe they\u2019re more than over it.\n\nThe cast of \u201cVeep\u201d was brought out for a similar police lineup and proper send-off, but they demonstrated a far better knack for not taking themselves too seriously. Louis-Dreyfus, especially: \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she deadpanned. \u201cI was told I would be up here alone.\u201d (She who laughs last, or something like that.)\n\nDisclosure: The Washington Post is owned by Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos.", "description": "\u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 and \u2018Fleabag\u2019 won the biggest prizes on a night when the telecast itself was sluggish and somewhat messy.", "authors": ["Hank Stuever", "Tv Critic", "September At Pm", "Hank Stuever Has Been The Washington Post'S Tv Critic Since He Joined The Paper In As A Reporter For The Style Section", "Where He Covered Popular Culture."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/VLHzuYMX7VCzecfpCKxpFSceBHc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/R56LC3W5TQI6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
