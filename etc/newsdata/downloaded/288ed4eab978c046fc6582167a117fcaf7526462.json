The 20-year-old has been in superb form for Chelsea after returning to Stamford Bridge from his loan at Derby County, but Southgate revealed he had been tracking Mount for four years.\n\nAsked what had impressed him about Mount, Southgate said: \u201cExactly what I thought of him when I saw him playing for our Under-16s. He\u2019s a quality player, an intelligent footballer, presses well, has a real eye for goal, good quality. So, nothing I\u2019ve seen surprises me at all.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had him marked as a player from the first time I saw him at St George\u2019s Park. Chelsea would be the same on that, I think, but of course he\u2019s now been able to have the opportunity to play in the Premier League and display that against top teams. I think you saw his penalty in the Super Cup, that was a nice cameo of what he\u2019s about, really.\u201d\n\nWith James Maddison pulling out of the squad due to illness, Mount is set to take his Chelsea team-mate Ross Barkley\u2019s place in midfield. Mount is one of three Chelsea academy graduates in Southgate\u2019s squad, along with striker Tammy Abraham and defender Fikayo Tomori. Another, Ruben Loftus-Cheek, would also have expected to have been included if not injured.", "description": "Mason Mount has been destined to become an England player since the age of 16, according to manager Gareth Southgate.", "authors": ["Matt Law", "Football News Correspondent", "Sam Wallace"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/10/TELEMMGLPICT000212588426-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqsn_gaCWBkN1XQupXOIG8D5-YHviMQZGYvHGZxCH7Xmc.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
