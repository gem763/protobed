Scarver returned the ensuing kickoff for a touchdown, the first of 36 consecutive points by the Aggies (4-2, 3-0 Mountain West).\n\nBright scored on runs of 67 and 9 yards \u2014 just 84 seconds apart \u2014 to make it 36-3 with 10:03 left in the game.\n\nTaua had 20 carries for 80 yards, including a 20-yard touchdown run late in the fourth quarter, for Nevada (4-3, 1-2).\n\nUtah State's two losses this year have both come on the road against Power 5 conference teams. The Aggies lost 38-35 to Wake Forest in their season opener and 42-6 to then-No. 5 (and currently second-ranked) LSU on Oct. 5.\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
