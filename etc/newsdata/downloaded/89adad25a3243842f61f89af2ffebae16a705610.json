Municipalities convention, to send a message to government officials.\n\nAccording to Todd Chamberlain, general manager of the Interior Logging Association, 120 trucks were already on the road by 7:30 a.m. Wednesday.\n\n\"It's been very tough in some communities,\" said Chamberlain, in a phone interview on CBC's Daybreak Kamloops. \"There is no end in sight.\"\n\nThe truckers are protesting the layoffs and slowdown in the lumber industry. 0:46\n\nHoward McKimmon, an independent trucking contractor from Merritt who organized the rally, said he hopes it will make government officials aware of how many people are currently affected by the struggling forestry industry.\n\nThousands of workers have been laid off and at least 22 mills in the Interior have closed or curtailed operations this year due to a combination of forces, including the end of the mountain pine beetle harvest, wildfire devastation, high log costs and low prices due to a slumping U.S. market.\n\nEarlier this month, the province announced $69 million in aid to beleaguered workers and called on the federal government to do more.\n\nMcKimmon said that money just doesn't cut it. He estimated it amounts to less than $12,000 per worker, many of whom have been out of work for four to six months. McKimmon said he can no longer make the payments on the logging trucks he owns.\n\nThe trucks arrived in Vancouver around 2 p.m. PT. (Ben Nelms/CBC)\n\n\"It's devastating,\" he told CBC's Daybreak North. \"I've made my life in the forest industry, raised kids and grandkids in this industry \u2026 I don't know what the future looks like.\"\n\nAccording to Chamberlain, the truckers are not asking for direct financial support from the provincial and federal government, but incentives that include a carbon tax exemption for the forestry industry.\n\n\"We asked to be at the table and we want to be part of the solution,\" said Chamberlain.\n\nTrucks running out space to park...completely taken over the city. They wanted to be heard & seen, well they accomplished that. <a href=\"https://t.co/9v6VhL364x\">pic.twitter.com/9v6VhL364x</a> \u2014@tinalovgreen\n\nThe RCMP is expected to escort the truckers from Merritt on Wednesday morning. The RCMP will then hand off to the Vancouver Police Department when the trucks reach the city.\n\nIn a statement, VPD said people should expect congestion along the Hastings Street and Cordova Street corridors in and out of the city Wednesday afternoon.", "description": "Hundreds of logging trucks from across B.C.\u00a0rallied in Vancouver on Wednesday to protest job losses in the forestry industry.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5297711.1569458639!/cumulusImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/logging-truck-convoy.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
