(Picture: Backgrid)\n\nThe pair are long-time friends who have previously been at the centre of romance rumours \u2013 but it gets all the more interesting considering Niall is very much single since splitting with Hailee Steinfeld and Selena\u2019s ex Justin Bieber is now happily married to Hailey Baldwin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNiall has even spoke about how his latest album was somewhat inspired by his heartbreak over Hailee.\n\n\u2018I had just gone through a break up, which helps when it comes to writing songs, I guess,\u2019 the 26-year-old said. \u2018It helps vent the emotions.\u2019\n\nDespite the gossip there\u2019s apparently nothing to see here folks.\n\n\u2018Selena and Niall are not dating and have been hanging out as friends, an insider told E!. \u2018They have always been good friends and have kept in touch throughout the years.\u2019\n\nCourtney Lopez shared a shot from the group dinner in which Niall has his arm around Selena (Picture: Instagram)\n\nThe source added, \u2018They both always have been very supportive of each other\u2019s music and have talked about collaborating before.\u2019\n\nI mean if we can\u2019t have the relationship at least we can enjoy the music right!\n\nThe singers have been super supportive of each other on Instagram, with the Bad Liar hitmaker spruiking Niall\u2019s new bop Nice To Meet Ya in her stories on the night of the group dinner.\n\n\u2018This came out like 5 min ago \u2026 and I\u2019m pretty sure you need to download @niallhoran,\u2019 she wrote.\n\nHow nice of Selena (Picture: Instagram)\n\nThen earlier on Wednesday, Niall posted an Instagram story of himself posing alongside a giant image of Selena.\n\n\u2018Hello there Sel,\u2019 he wrote, tagging the artist.\n\nThe heart wants what it wants? (Picture: Instagram)\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the first time Niall and Selena have been romantically linked.\n\nFour years earlier the young stars sent the rumour mill into overdrive after a PDA packed display at Jenna Dewan\u2019s birthday party in which they were spotted kissing, dancing, and hugging at the bash, according to E!.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYet not long after Selena shut down any chatter that they were anything more than just friends.\n\n\u2018Oh my god, no,\u2019 she told ET Online of the romance rumors. \u2018I love him, I always have.
