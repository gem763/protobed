It\u2019s hard to think of anything which better illustrates this Govt\u2019s contempt for people, Parliament & democracy.\u201d\n\nOminously for the government, some lawmakers who support the Brexit deal said they would vote against the short timetable.\n\n\u201cUnless you are prepared to contemplate more expansive debate, there is not the slightest possibility of considering the deal that has been obtained within the time available,\u201d Ken Clarke, a senior lawmaker recently ousted from Johnson\u2019s Conservative Party group in Parliament, told the Guardian newspaper.\n\nThe showdown comes just nine days before Britain\u2019s scheduled departure date. Johnson\u2019s government had sought a \u201cstraight up-and-down vote\u201d Monday on the agreement he struck last week with the 27 other EU nations laying out the terms of Britain\u2019s exit.\n\nBut the speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, refused to allow it because lawmakers voted to delay approving the Brexit deal on Saturday, and parliamentary rules bar the same measure from being considered a second time during a session of Parliament unless something has changed.\n\nBercow\u2019s ruling plunged the tortuous Brexit process back into grimly familiar territory: acrimonious uncertainty.\n\nJohnson\u2019s only hope of securing Britain\u2019s Oct. 31 departure, as he has long promised, is to pass the Brexit-implementing bill through Britain\u2019s fractious Parliament before then.\n\nJohnson\u2019s Conservatives hold just 288 of the 650 House of Common seats, so he will need support form opposition and independent lawmakers to pass the bill.\n\nOpposition lawmakers plan to seek amendments that could substantially alter the bill, for example by adding a requirement that the Brexit deal be put to voters in a new referendum. The government says such an amendment would wreck its legislation and it will withdraw the bill if the opposition plan succeeds.\n\nWith the Brexit deadline looming and British politicians still squabbling over the country\u2019s departure terms, Johnson has been forced to ask the EU for a three-month delay to Britain\u2019s departure date.\n\nHe did that, grudgingly, to comply with a law passed by Parliament ordering the government to postpone Brexit rather than risk the economic damage that could come from a no-deal exit.\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said Tuesday that EU leaders \u201cwill decide in coming days\u201d whether to grant Britain another extension to the deadline for leaving the bloc, but said their decision depends on developments in London.\n\nTusk said Tuesday that the decision on prolonging Brexit for three months after Oct. 31. \u201cwill very much depend on what the British parliament decides or doesn\u2019t decide.\u201d\n\n___\n\nJill Lawless in London contributed to this story.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "British lawmakers from across the political spectrum were plotting Tuesday to put the brakes on Prime Minister Boris Johnson's drive to push his European Union divorce bill through the House of Commons in just three days, potentially scuttling the government's hopes of delivering Brexit by Oct. 31.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Danica Kirka", "Lorne Cook"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/22/britain_brexit_65380_c0-132-3528-2190_s1200x700.jpg?2a3381a4dec30aff9e40f9cd0e6fb1ff3b5e577f", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
