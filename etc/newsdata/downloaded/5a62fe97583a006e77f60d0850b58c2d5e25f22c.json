Whichever transaction came first would be contracted on a long settlement period, while the second transaction would be agreed on a shorter settlement timeframe such that both properties settled at the same time.\n\nThat degree of co-ordination is hard to achieve in practice. Switchers often either end up with two properties for a period (if they buy first) or no property at all for a time (if they sell first).\n\nThe conventional wisdom is to play it safe and sell first and buy second as holding two assets with very high debt for a prolonged period is considered a bigger danger to finances and nerves than the potential inconvenience of renting for a while.\n\nBut there is a case for the riskier approach of buying first and selling second, particularly in a rising market like we see in parts of Australia today.\n\nJudge correctly that prices are moving up and the participant can be tens of thousands of dollars better off by buying in the cheaper current market and selling in the more expensive future one compared with the net outcome of a sell first, buy second strategy.", "description": "You could be better off buying in the cheaper current market and selling in the more expensive future - depending on the kind of property you're offloading.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.5298%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_39/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/11c2cad1cef29884780dea79c2e1409b660198d8", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
