Every Wednesday, Nielson will recap \"Bachelor in Paradise\" for \"Good Morning America,\" weighing in on her favorite couples and all the jaw-dropping drama. Her latest (and last!) entry is below.\n\nInterested in The Bachelor? Add The Bachelor as an interest to stay up to date on the latest The Bachelor news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nSummer is officially over and the beaches of Paradise are now closed until next summer!\n\nLast night, we saw the finale of season six of \"Bachelor in Paradise\" where we got to celebrate engagements, breakups and of course ... more drama.\n\nFantasy suite surprise\n\n\"I\u2019m not there yet.\" - Clay\n\nThe episode kicked off with Nicole and Clay in the fantasy suite. While this has been one of the most established relationships this season, Clay tells Nicole that he\u2019s happy to stay the night with her but is not ready for an engagement. Clay then decides that he wants to take the night to sleep on things and leaves Nicole alone in the romantic suite meant to solidify their relationship.\n\nWhen they walk down to the beach for their final moments in Paradise, Nicole pours out her heart and then asks, \"I just need you to answer me this one question, yes or no, Clay ... do you love me?\"\n\nClay admits that he is \"not there yet\" and knows that she \"wants and deserves more.\"\n\nClay asks Nicole if they can continue to take things slow and leave Paradise to date in the real world, but Nicole refuses because she wants an engagement.\n\n\"I deserve a love so deep that the ocean would be jealous.\"- Nicole\n\nClay dated Angela for eight months before saying, \"I love you,\" so of course, he will not be ready for an engagement after only three weeks!\n\nWhat really surprised me was that Nicole didn\u2019t want to continue dating after Paradise. If Nicole feels as strongly for Clay as she says, then she should be more patient with him like we\u2019ve seen with Kristian and Demi.\n\nLove is patient, and when you force it, it crumbles ... as we witnessed with Clay and Nicole.\n\nLesson learned, now let' s move on!\n\nEngagements\n\nNext, on the beach, we saw the following couples get down on one knee and commit their hearts to their loved ones:\n\nChris and Katie\n\nDylan and Hannah\n\nDemi and Kristian\n\nThe couple that surprised me the most was Chris and Katie because we\u2019ve seen so many reservations and red flags in their relationship, which makes me feel that they are forcing this.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of pressure to accelerate your relationship and I think that Katie is hopeful but this girl needs to listen to her gut ... the first time! If there are red flags now, they will only get worse.\n\nHannah and Dylan\n\n\"I've never had to fight so hard for something that I wanted so much ... but I didn\u2019t give up.\" - Dylan\n\nOkay, this couple is just the absolute cutest and I can\u2019t wait for them to make babies. That\u2019s all.\n\nDemi and Kristian\n\nI am so proud of how vulnerable this couple has been to let the world into their relationship and evolution. I admire Demi for being brave enough to explore who she is, speaking from experience here, that is tough but necessary work.\n\nAs the saying goes, the truth will set you free and I am so here to celebrate that love can come in many packages, but it\u2019s not about how it looks that matters, it\u2019s how it makes you feel.\n\nReunion\n\nAfter the engagements, we jumped right into part two of the three-hour finale, \"Reunion,\" where we got to see what everyone's been up to since filming wrapped.\n\nHere are some of the most memorable moments.\n\nJordan and Christian -- and their bodyguards\n\nIt was a battle of the egos at Reunion over who would apologize first ... Jordan or Christian. Unfortunately, neither did.\n\nI was really surprised that Jordan and Christian could come back on set after breaking out into a physical altercation this summer. Granted, two large male bodyguards were standing by them. It felt like a fight would break out at any given moment. I was there for the \"Reunion\" taping and this fight went on FOREVERRRR. It\u2019s unfortunate that they could not find a resolution because carrying around anger is heavy on the heart.\n\nDemi said it best, \"act civilized guys, this is a TV show.\"\n\nBlake's hot seat was so hot\n\n\"We have never seen someone fall so far from grace ... so far, so fast.\" - Chris Harrison\n\nWow, this was so uncomfortable to watch. I was wondering if Blake could redeem himself after an intense season of beatings for past transgressions ... But that was not the case.\n\nBlake admitted that he knew that he was going to \"take a few bumps and bruises\" for that unforgettable weekend at Stagecoach, but he had no idea it would escalate to the level it did.\n\nCaelynn shared that while she and Blake would be \"honest\" about their relationship if it came up, \"the reason I was so upset was because I felt like I was being ignored on the beach.\" Rule of thumb to all men: women DO NOT want to be ignored.\n\nSeveral castmates attacked Blake for his premeditated trip to Birmingham to see Hannah just days before filming, as well for posting intimate text messages between him and Caelynn that only showed him in a positive light.\n\nBlake tried to own up, but the impact of his actions had been too heavy, and he missed out on one important element ...\n\n\"I can\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t apologize [about the text messages].\" - Caelynn\n\nKatie blindsides her fianc\u00e9 without her ring on\n\n\"I fell in love with potential that may never come into fruition but I'm praying that it does.\" - Katie\n\nKatie comes on stage to chat with Chris Harrison ... alone ... which is never a good sign. Katie broke down and revealed that she has never felt \"so alone in a relationship\" because of Chris\u2019s inability to express his emotions and feelings to her.\n\nThey ultimately agreed that Chris will change and be more open about his feelings only to then see them walk offstage and get into an argument where Chris refuses to speak to Katie about how upset he is.\n\nThey part ways without a resolution only to leave Katie further frustrated with the lack of communication.\n\nWhile this couple is still together, I hope that they take a beat to stay off social media and focus on developing a positive way where Chris feels safe enough to be vulnerable and express himself.\n\nThese relationships require serious effort and you have to put your time and energy into it to make it work!\n\nDemi and Kristian get engaged again and we're living for it\n\nAs Demi and Kristina sat on stage for the first time to announce and celebrate their engagement, I couldn't help but feel so emotional for the journey this couple allowed us to be a part of.\n\n\"Demi is the queer queen we didn\u2019t know we needed.\"- Chris Harrison\n\nKristian pulled Demi on stage to pour out all the reasons she loves her: her hair, her laugh, her smile and her incredible courage to be herself, always. Then she gets down on one knee and pulls out a gorgeous Neil Lane diamond ring.\n\nYASSSSSS.\n\nTo Demi and Kristian: thank you for being brave enough to explore your hearts and letting us see such a patient and nurturing love. It will inspire a lot of lives to have the courage to follow their hearts and I can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s next for you!\n\nAnd the Bachelor is\n\nPilot Pete!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI\u2019ve known from the beginning that Pete would be our next lead because he is just too adorable and eligible. Above all, he has successful role-models for love (his parents) and I\u2019m selfishly STOKED that he is over the age of 25 so that we can have more serious conversations this January.\n\nFor all of Peters girls, here\u2019s a bit of advice:\n\n\"Stay off Instagram ... or don\u2019t go to Stagecoach.\" - Jordan\n\nAnd that's a wrap!\n\nThis season has been more than any producer could ever wish for: incredible moments of vulnerability, exposure and a storm of tears. While many broken hearts left the sandy beaches of Sayulita, the couples that were honest, vulnerable and fearless in their pursuit of love triumphed.\n\nThank you all for joining me for our weekly \"Bachelor in Paradise\" Recaps! It\u2019s been an absolute pleasure!\n\nFollow me on Instagram to keep up with my healthy living tips and married life!\n\nXx, Krystal", "description": "Get breaking national and world news, broadcast video coverage, and exclusive interviews.
