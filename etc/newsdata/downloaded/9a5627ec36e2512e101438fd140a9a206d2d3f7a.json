Korea then this is a ridiculously escalatory proliferation/espionage op. But false flags are so goddamn easy. Kaspersky may be tracking overlapping infra, not this exact campaign. Hack of 2nd target could be power projection. Time lost in IR, we may never really know https://t.co/9xi4CZrvd1 \u2014 Pukhraj Singh (@RungRage) October 29, 2019\n\nPanicked rumors and headlines spread like fire after Singh tweeted on Monday that the breach had gone \u201cpublic,\u201d stating that \u201cextremely mission-critical targets were hit\u201d in the intrusion, which he called a \u201ccasus belli in the Indian cyberspace.\u201d\n\nIndian authorities were aware of the potential breach since at least early September, according to Singh who personally filed a report after he was first alerted by a third party. He also cited a report by independent cyber attack monitor VirusTotal, which said a form of malware known as \u201cDtrack\u201d \u2013 which some linked to alleged North Korean hacking outfit, the Lazarus Group \u2013 was used against several Indian targets. The report matched an earlier finding by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky, which had detected Dtrack attacking \u201cfinancial institutions and research centers\u201d in India.\n\nAlso on rt.com US has started a cyberwar against Iran that it \u2018won\u2019t be able to finish,\u2019 Iranian FM Zarif says\n\nWhile Indian officials insist no intrusion took place and that the power plant\u2019s systems were \u201cair-gapped\u201d \u2013 or totally isolated from other networks \u2013 that precaution has failed to stop other high-profile cyber attacks. Stuxnet, a virus developed by Washington (likely with help from Tel Aviv), is believed to have breached air-gapped Iranian nuclear systems in 2010, possibly by way of an infected USB drive.\n\nSince its reactors went online in 2013, the KNPP has encountered some 70 shutdowns, with one reactor temporarily halting operations in mid-October due to faults in its steam generator. While some recalled the issue and quickly linked it to the alleged hack, KNPP officials say the problem was entirely unrelated and since resolved.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Age of digital terrorism\u2019 is coming, impact may be as dangerous as WMDs \u2013 Moscow\n\nLike this story?
