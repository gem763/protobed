There was a magnitude of failures,\" he said. \"I hope the Florida Senate does the right thing and upholds the suspension today.\"\n\n\"Eight deputies were outside while shots were being fired,\" Pollack added. \"Something I'm so disgusted about the last few days is Florida Sen. Lauren Book, someone who has served on the MSD commission. [She] knew all the facts, watched my sister get murdered, but still voted to reinstate Sheriff Israel. She sold out the community of Broward county and put our children at risk.\"\n\nFATHER OF PARKLAND SHOOTING VICTIM SPEAKS OUT AGAINST SHERIFF TRYING TO GET REINSTATED: 'NO INTEGRITY AT ALL'\n\nPollack also called out the four other Broward county senators who serve on the Rules Committee and claimed they were laughing, as parents were pleading with them to prevent Israel's reinstatement.\n\n\"Gary Farmer, Perry Thurston, Oscar Braynon, they were laughing. They were eating candy while these parents are begging them, 'Please vote in our favor,'\" he claimed.\n\n\"To these Broward senators, it was just a joke,\" Pollack added.\n\nThe committee voted 9-7 along party lines not to reinstate Israel, with each Democrat voting in favor of Israel and each Republican voting against him. The full Florida Senate is expected to confirm the decision on Wednesday.\n\nPARKLAND SCHOOL SHOOTING COMMISSION ISSUES REPORT, RECOMMENDS ARMING FLORIDA TEACHERS\n\nPollack said the deputies who waited to enter the school showed cowardice and blamed Israel for instilling a culture of ineptitude in the sheriff's office.\n\n\"While shots were ringing out, deputies were taking time to put on their bulletproof vests and hiding behind concrete walls,\" he said. \"But this is the culture that Scott Israel created in the Broward sheriff's office. I say, my sister became a victim of his deadly incompetence.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"My sister was shot four times,\" Pollack added. \"But then after that, she shielded another student to protect her and that's when the killer sadly took both of their lives. My sister's my hero.\"\n\nThe suspension of Israel was one of the first actions taken by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis upon taking office in January. Israel's lawyer, Ben Kuehne, said DeSantis' decision was political, noting that a Senate-appointed special master's investigation did not find institutional failures.\n\nIsrael has said he will run for sheriff again in 2020.", "description": "Florida Democratic senators who voted to\u00a0reinstate suspended Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel should be ashamed of themselves and \"sold out\" their communities in favor of partisan politics, said Hunter Pollack on \"Fox & Friends\" Wednesday.", "authors": ["Nick Givas", "Nick Givas Is A Reporter With Fox News.
