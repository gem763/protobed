He then took questions from reporters.\n\nHere is a copy of his opening statement and then a partial transcript of the exchange with media.\n\n\u201cIn 2001, I was teaching in Vancouver and attended an end of year gala where the theme was Arabian Nights. I dressed up in an Aladdin costume and put make-up on. I shouldn\u2019t have done that. I should have known better but I didn\u2019t and I\u2019m deeply sorry.\u201d\n\nQ: You were 29-years-old at the time. How can you explain what you did?\n\nA: \u201cIt was a mistake. I should not have done it. I should have known not to do it and I deeply regret it. Yes, I apologise. I am disappointed.\u201d\n\nQ: Had one of your Liberal candidates in this election race done this, would you have asked them to step down?\n\nA: \u201cThere are people who have made mistakes in this life and you make decisions on what they actually do and did and on a case-by-case basis.\u201d\n\nQ: Is this the only time in your life that you have ever done something like this?\n\nA: \u201cWhen I was in high school I dressed up at a talent show and sang \u201cDay O\u201d (a traditional Jamaican song about people loading bananas onto boats) with make-up on.\u201d\n\nQ: If someone else had done this, would you have asked them to retract the remarks?\n\nA: \u201cI always fought all my life against discrimination and intolerance. I should have known at that age not to do this.\u201d\n\nQ: When people in the United States do these sorts of things, they are asked to resign. Have you given any thought to resigning?\n\nA: \u201cI take responsibility for my decision to do that... it was something that I didn\u2019t think was racist at the time but now I recognise it was something racist to do. And I am deeply sorry ... I have made a number of calls to friends and colleagues tonight and I will have many more calls to make.\u201d\n\nQ: Why should you be allowed to stay on as a candidate?\n\nA: \u201cI am going to be asking Canadians to forgive me for what I did ... it was a dumb thing to do. I\u2019m disappointed in myself. I\u2019m pissed off with myself for having done it.\u201d", "description": "Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday delivered an apology for an incident in 2001 where he dressed up in brown face.
