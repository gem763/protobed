A battered Gifford was in survival mode for the majority of the fight, and had nothing left to give. His corner opted not to throw in the towel, and the referee let Gifford continue.\n\nBut pioneering referee John McCarthy, like most others, believed the fight should have been stopped before it was, as Gifford suffered unnecessary damage throughout the fight. He thinks there was no way Gifford would have come back to get the win. McCarthy said had he been the third man in, the bout would have been waved off before things got out of hand.\n\n\u201cNow would have I done it differently? Yes,\u201d McCarthy told MMA Junkie during a recent Q&A. \u201cI can guarantee you the fight never would have seen the third round, it probably would have been stopped long before that and I\u2019m going to get him out in a certain way because there\u2019s things as a referee you\u2019re supposed to consider. This is what you consider, first off, what\u2019s the best for the fighter, well in this situation, I\u2019ve got a guy, can he win on the cards, I know just watching the fight, you\u2019ve lost both rounds 10-8, there\u2019s no way to win on the cards, ok, you can\u2019t come back from that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s extra damage that he took that he did not need to take. You can only give so much before that shiny diamond becomes a crushed rock that just doesn\u2019t sparkle anymore and that\u2019s everybody.\u201d\n\nAnd McCarthy thinks that corners are usually hesitant to stop a fight, due to the likely backlash they\u2019ll receive from their fighters. While they should consider their charge\u2019s health, it\u2019s often a tough position to be in.\n\n\u201cMost corners will not throw the towel because many times the fighter goes you didn\u2019t believe in me, you thought I couldn\u2019t come back,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nHowever McCarthy believes that referee Andrew Glenn, who was refereeing the fight between Davis and Gifford on Oct. 12, may have been put in a difficult spot, but should have known better.\n\n\u201cThe referee involved in it is from Florida, he\u2019s not one of the traveling referees that there are and you know that this is his big moment,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cHe gets to work a UFC and this is what he\u2019s been dreaming of and now he\u2019s in this position that he goes man this guy is taking a lot of shots, I can\u2019t stop this fight because I don\u2019t want people to boo me. I don\u2019t want to upset people, I don\u2019t know what to do. So what do we do when we don\u2019t know what to do? And he does nothing.\u201d\n\nThe commission pulled Glenn from subsequent UFC Tampa fight assignments after the Gifford fiasco.\n\nAnother factor that McCarthy said may play a factor in a corner\u2019s decision to not wave off a fight is the UFC\u2019s win-bonus system. Fighters often want to keep fighting so they\u2019re not deprived of a potential victory bonus, which often doubles their overall pay.\n\nBellator, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t award fighters a win bonus, paying a flat fee win or lose, which is the way McCarthy thinks it should be.\n\n\u201cMost corners are not going to, the fighter, and I know this is hard to understand, if you ask a fighter and this is one of the things I love about Bellator, Bellator doesn\u2019t have a win bonus,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cHere\u2019s your rate, this is what you get, win or lose, they\u2019re going to get that. They come out, they have a bad performance, you get it. You come out and have a great performance, you get it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what you\u2019re making because every fighter, wherever the UFC goes, you ask the fighters, how much are you making for this fight, oh I\u2019m making $60,000, you\u2019re making $60,000? yeah 30 to show and 30 to win. You haven\u2019t fought yet, you have already mentally spent that $60,000. It\u2019s gone, they know they\u2019re making that extra 30, now that doesn\u2019t always happen.\u201d", "description": "Referee John McCarthy believes it's the referees job to look out for the fighters, as most corners will likely not throw the towel in.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Mma Junkie Staff", "Simon Samano", "Abbey Subhan", "The Blue Corner"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/mike-davis-thomas-gifford-ufc-on-espn-plus-19-10.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
