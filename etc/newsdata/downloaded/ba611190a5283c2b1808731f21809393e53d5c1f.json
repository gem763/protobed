There are times when one teacher teaches those 67 children. Is that wrong, of course it's not wrong.\n\n'Our year 6 classroom is designed like a lecture theatre, I can seat 67 children in there, I know I will be public enemy No1 by saying this.'\n\nThe school currently has a 'outstanding' rating by Ofsted, but despite this experts have said that people who believe high quality education can be adhered to in such an environment as similar to that of Broadclyst are 'mistaken'.\n\nPupils at Broadclyst are part of more than 559,000 primary school students in the UK which have been taught in the so-called super-size classes, compared to 501,000 just five years before.\n\nThe school (pictured above) currently has a 'outstanding' rating by Ofsted\n\nOn average school receive a budget of \u00a33,500 to \u00a35,000 per pupil, and it's thought that arrangements such as lecture style teaching have been put in place to hep schools boost their budgets.\n\nConcerns have been raised that the UK educational system could be moving towards that of one similar to Asia where children are taught in large classes.\n\nProfessor of education at Buckingham University, Alan Smithers said classes like the ones in Devon were damaging and were one of the reasons why some parents were choosing to have their children privately educated.\n\nHe said that funding cuts were pushing schools to large class sizes and that younger children needed personal attention.\n\nDespite this, other schools in the UK are also using similar methods to that of Broadclyst, and Dr Challoner's Grammar School in Buckinghamshire has also adopted larger classes in the hope it will prepare its students for university.\n\nHeadmaster David Atkinson said the average size of a class at the school is 32 and that sixth-formers have more than 210 pupils per class.\n\nIn England class sizes have continued to grow over the last five years. In secondary schools there were around 402,000 pupils in classes of more than 30, a 44 per cent rise from five years ago.\n\nThis is while almost 22,000 were taught in classes with at least 36 pupils, compared with 14,000 five years ago.", "description": "Broadclyst Community Primary School in Devon has one of the highest average class sizes in the country, where 42 pupils will sit in on each session.
