This is the first time in two decades the team and Brady have gone into a season without him being under contract for the following year. While it could all just be a leverage play to force the team\u2019s hand to pay him more if they want to retain him, it also may be a sign Brady is ready and willing to sign with a new team now that he\u2019ll finally be able to do so.\n\nExhibit B: Brady and Gisele B\u00fcndchen\u2019s Boston-area home is for sale\n\nIn August, Brady and Bundchen listed their Boston-area mansion for $39.5 million. The price for the five-bedroom, five-bathroom home in Brookline was slashed to $33.9 million this month.\n\nIn addition to the celeb couple\u2019s custom-built home being placed on the market, Brady\u2019s business partner and personal trainer, Alex Guerrero, also placed his house on the market in August.\n\nTom Brady and Gisele B\u00fcndchen in 2019 in LA. (Kevin Winter/Getty Images)\n\nThe third piece of the pie is that Brady and B\u00fcndchen reportedly have a new house in Greenwich, Connecticut. While moving there doesn\u2019t necessarily preclude Brady from playing for the Patriots \u2014 he probably could afford an apartment in Foxborough \u2014 it is interesting he\u2019d want to have another NYC-area property when he already owns a place in Tribeca.\n\nExhibit C: Brady\u2019s non-definitive answers about the subject\n\nThe topic of Brady\u2019s future has been a huge topic this offseason and he has not shied away from discussing it. The most recent example was on Monday night during his weekly interview with Jim Gray.\n\nDuring a lengthy conversation, Brady said none of the media speculation about his future plans has been brought on by anything he\u2019s said and that his only focus is on the second half of the season.\n\n\u201cAgain, I don\u2019t know why it\u2019s being brought up,\u201d Brady said. \u201cI had a good quote that came to mind. Someone told me the past and future are in the mind. I\u2019m in the now. I think that\u2019s a great way to live life. I\u2019m not thinking about many things beyond this week. There are some family things I\u2019m thinking about with the holidays coming up, but outside of that I\u2019m thinking about football and how I can be the best for the New England Patriots. I don\u2019t really pay attention to it, and I\u2019m the only one who knows how I feel.\u201d\n\nAbsent in that answer? Brady even approaching making a definitive statement that he fully intends to work out a new deal with the team once the season is over. The reason the possibility of him leaving keeps being brought up is that he\u2019s never said anything to the contrary despite having daily opportunities to do so.\n\nExhibit D: Brady may not like how the Patriots are structured\n\nEven though the team is 8-0, Brady and the New England offense have ceded the spotlight to the defense that stole the show at Super Bowl LIII.\n\nAlso, a year that started with Brady having veterans like Antonio Brown, Demaryius Thomas and Josh Gordon as receiving options has shifted to him throwing passes to unknown commodities like Gunner Olszewski, Jakobi Meyers and N\u2019Keal Harry.\n\nTom Brady and Antonio Brown bump fists in a game. (Barry Chin/The Boston Globe via Getty)\n\nTrue, Brady still has trusted options like Julian Edelman and Phillip Dorsett at his disposal and the team did acquire veteran Mohamed Sanu from the Falcons, but the team\u2019s receiving corps is far from elite and Brady\u2019s numbers have suffered because of it.\n\nIt\u2019s cynical, but one might even wonder if that\u2019s at least slightly on purpose. After all, the worse Brady\u2019s numbers are this season, the easier it is for the team to make him a lowball offer and, if he doesn\u2019t take it, justify letting him leave for more cash in greener pastures. Bill Belichick has certainly done worse.\n\nSo, if Brady did actually go somewhere else, where would it be?\n\nThere are plenty of teams that would want Brady, but there are probably only a handful \u2014 if any \u2014 he would consider going to.\n\nOne potential landing spot, according to Jason La Canfora of CBS Sports, is in Los Angeles with the Chargers. \u201cThe Chargers would have a unique appeal to Brady on multiple levels, the sources said, while it\u2019s also something the league would covet given the Chargers\u2019 current struggles to sell PSLs and sponsorships at the glistening new stadium they will share with the Rams in Inglewood beginning next fall,\u201d La Canfora writes.\n\nAnother place Brady could end up if he leaves New England? In Nashville with the Tennessee Titans. The Titans have been a quarterback short of being a threat for a number of years now and there\u2019s some belief Brady would be open to the idea of playing for ex-teammate-turned-head coach Mike Vrabel.\n\nSo, will Brady\u2019s 20th season with the Patriots end with one of the messiest sports divorces of all-time? The truth is, nobody knows, even Brady.\n\n\u201cThe great part for me is I don\u2019t know,\u201d Brady said last week. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s been a unique situation that I\u2019ve been in because I think when you commit to a team for a certain amount of years, you kind of feel like your responsibility\u2019s to always fulfill the contract. For me it\u2019s been good because I\u2019m just taking it day by day and I\u2019m enjoying what I have. I don\u2019t know what the future holds.\u201d\n\nA trip to Canton for sure. Whether there\u2019s a stop in the middle is still to be determined.\n\nSubscribe here for our free daily newsletter.", "description": "In the midst of his 20th season in the NFL, we don't know if New England's longtime quarterback will make another stop along the way to Canton.", "authors": ["Evan Bleier"], "top_image": "https://www.insidehook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1183821061.jpg?fit=1024%2C683", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
