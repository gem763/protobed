Then at 11.17am the text of the agreement is emailed out by No10 (he is pictured during an interview with Sky News)\n\nSecretary Sir Keir Starmer (pictured in Parliament today) also dismissed the deal, saying it \u2018paves the way for a decade of deregulation\u2019\n\nConservative MPs said it was astonishing that Labour had rejected the deal before having had a chance to digest it.\n\nThe Labour leader made a point of claiming the proposals risked \u2018triggering a race to the bottom\u2019 with regard to workers\u2019 rights and environmental protections.\n\nBut when the deal was published almost 30 minutes later, it stated that Britain was committed to \u2018maintaining \u2018environmental, social and employment standards at the current high levels\u2019.\n\nPaul Scully, Conservative deputy chairman, said: \u2018It beggars belief Corbyn rejected the deal before he\u2019d even read it.\n\n\u2018It shows he has no intention of keeping his promises to respect the referendum, and would only inflict yet more dither and pointless delay on the country.\n\n\u2018He is wholly incapable of making the decisions needed to take Britain forward.\u2019\n\nThe Prime Minister announced at 10.22am yesterday that a \u2018great new\u2019 Brexit agreement had been reached with the EU.\n\nAt 10.51am, Mr Corbyn was asked for his view \u2013 and revealed that his party would not be supporting Mr Johnson\u2019s withdrawal agreement.\n\nHe said: \u2018From what we know, it seems the Prime Minister has negotiated an even worse deal than Theresa May\u2019s, which was overwhelmingly rejected.\u2019\n\nBut the actual legal text of the deal was not published until 11.17am \u2013 well after Mr Corbyn had dismissed it out of hand.\n\nMr Johnson speaks at a joint press conference with President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker (not pictured) at the European Commission headquarters in Brussels\n\nDespite apparently not knowing the details, he added: \u2018These proposals risk triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections \u2013 putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers\u2019 rights, and opening up our NHS to a takeover by US private corporations.\n\n\u2018This sell-out deal won\u2019t bring the country together and should be rejected. The best way to get Brexit sorted is to give the people the final say in a public vote.\u2019\n\n\u2018From what we\u2019ve read of this deal, it doesn\u2019t meet our demands or expectations, it creates a border down the Irish Sea and it leads once again to a race to the bottom in rights and protections for British citizens and a danger of the sell-off of our national assets to American companies.\u2019\n\nAsked whether he had given up on his plan to negotiate a Labour Brexit deal, Mr Corbyn replied: \u2018Not at all. A Labour government elected in a general election would within three months negotiate an agreement with the EU... and then within six months we would put that to a referendum.\u2019\n\nTory MP Michael Fabricant said: \u2018Corbyn is seriously misreading the view of the British public who want Brexit done.\n\n\u2018He knows he is the most unpopular Opposition leader since records began in the Seventies. Maybe he thinks it can\u2019t get any worse. It can. His immediate condemnation of the deal reveals him in an even clearer light.\u2019 Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer also dismissed the deal, saying it \u2018paves the way for a decade of deregulation\u2019. He argued it would give the Government a \u2018licence to slash\u2019 worker, environment and consumer protections.\n\nSir Keir added: \u2018If Boris Johnson has confidence in his deal, he should put it back to the people in a public vote against Remain.\u2019\n\nTony Lloyd, the party\u2019s Northern Ireland spokesman, said Labour MPs were \u2018almost bound\u2019 to vote for holding a referendum if Mr Johnson found a majority to support his deal.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme that even though Labour would \u2018prefer a general election\u2019, it was \u2018consistent\u2019 with party policy that MPs would back holding a confirmatory vote on the freshly inked Brexit deal.\n\nJeremy Corbyn has behaved like a spiv trying to welch on a bet, says Theresa May\u2019s ex-communications boss SIR ROBBIE GIBB\n\nBy Sir Robbie Gibb for the Daily Mail\n\nOf all the descriptions often attributed to Jeremy Corbyn, being a mind-reader is not one. And yet before the Prime Minister\u2019s new Brexit deal was published yesterday, the Labour leader definitively declared that he couldn\u2019t support it.\n\nThere are two possible explanations for this.\n\nEither Corbyn is a sage who managed to deduce the contents of the unpublished 64-page document.\n\nOr, he jumped in without waiting to read the first page.\n\nHaving seen first-hand the shameless speed with which Corbyn can denounce a deal, forgive me if I lean towards the second possibility.\n\nOver the past three years, there has been little about Corbyn\u2019s handling of Brexit to suggest he has any inclination to prioritise the Brexit referendum result over the demands of Labour\u2019s own internal party politics. So much for the man who\u2019s party went into the last general election with a manifesto which clearly stated: \u2018Labour accepts the referendum result and a Labour government will put the national interest first.\u2019\n\nLabour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn talks to the media as he arrives to attend a pre-council meeting of the Party of European Socialists at Albert Hall in Brussels on Thursday\n\nFaced with a growing Remainer insurgency along his front bench, Corbyn has also ditched his own Eurosceptic beliefs.\n\nWhether, therefore, Corbyn has tried to scupper every attempt to deliver Brexit out of political cowardice or shameless cynicism scarcely matters.\n\nAnd while Boris Johnson has staked everything \u2013 not least his own reputation and premiership \u2013 on making good on that promise, the Labour leader has behaved like a slopey-shouldered spiv trying to welch on a bet. As his actions demonstrated yesterday, Corbyn isn\u2019t one to spend time reading important documents.\n\nBut should he ever start, he could do no worse than begin at page 24 of Labour\u2019s own 2017 manifesto.\n\nTime and again, Corbyn has shown how those key five words \u2013 \u2018Labour accepts the referendum result\u2019 \u2013 aren\u2019t worth the paper they were printed on.\n\nUnder his leadership, Labour MPs opted to trigger Article 50 and set the two-year clock running on Brexit negotiations, but subsequently voted on 34 separate occasions in the Commons to block Brexit legislation.\n\nEven when we were trying to broker a deal with Labour to break the Parliamentary deadlock, I remember how their delegation failed to take the matter at hand seriously. I will never forget one particularly farcical moment in April when, during crunch talks with Labour to get Theresa\u2019s May\u2019s deal through, the party\u2019s Brexit spokesman, Sir Keir Starmer, condemned a document we had just given him \u2013 even though it had been copied and pasted from his own proposals!\n\nAt another point, Corbyn\u2019s deputy, John McDonnell, suddenly raised the issue of a Second Referendum.\n\nI was surprised. At the time, McDonnell had no great love for the Remainer rump of his party.\n\n\u2018I said I\u2019d raise it,\u2019 he explained matter-of-factly, \u2018and I\u2019ve raised it.\u2019 It was a bizarre outburst \u2013 though one that now explains why Corbyn\u2019s self-serving game-playing over Brexit is coming home to roost.\n\nAt another point, Corbyn\u2019s deputy, John McDonnell (pictured alongside Sajid Javid), suddenly raised the issue of a Second Referendum\n\nHeld captive by Labour\u2019s hardcore Remainer membership, he has been backed into a cul-de-sac of support for a second referendum.\n\nMeanwhile, Boris Johnson has never deviated from the course he set \u2013 to take Britain out of Europe on October 31, \u2018do or die\u2019.\n\nHe has gambled everything on this promise and it seems to have paid off.\n\nIndeed, it means that, tomorrow, there is a clear choice for MPs: back this deal or leave without a deal in less than two weeks\u2019 time.\n\nThere are, of course, a handful of honourable former Labour MPs, such as John Mann and Iain Austin, who will do their duty and honour the referendum result.\n\nThere are also decent, moderate Labour MPs, such as Caroline Flint, who voted Remain but have since stated resolutely that Brexit must be delivered.\n\nTomorrow, other Labour MPs would do well to follow their lead.\n\nNow is the time for our politicians to break free from this appalling Parliamentary paralysis, to live up to their promises to voters and get Brexit done.\n\nIf Jeremy Corbyn continues to put the brakes on Brexit, it could plunge Britain into an almighty crash.\n\nSir Robbie Gibb was Theresa May\u2019s director of communications\n\nA boost for workers\u2019 rights that could win Labour round: Boris Johnson pledges set \u2018highest possible standards\u2019 into LAW \u2013 despite Jeremy Corbyn saying deal is a \u2018race to the bottom\u2019\n\nBy Daniel Martin for the Daily Mail\n\nModerate Labour MPs could be persuaded to back the Prime Minister\u2019s Brexit deal after he offered a series of sweeteners on workers\u2019 rights.\n\nSpeaking in Brussels last night, Boris Johnson said he would \u2018gladly\u2019 make a commitment to maintain the \u2018highest possible standards\u2019 on environmental and social protections.\n\nAnd the Daily Mail understands that Downing Street is now offering to write them into the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to make them legally binding.\n\nBehind-the-scenes talks have already taken place with rebel Labour MPs, led by Stephen Kinnock, who has previously said he would support a deal which honoured the referendum result.\n\nBehind-the-scenes talks have already taken place with rebel Labour MPs, led by Stephen Kinnock (left), who has previously said he would support a deal which honoured the referendum result. Ruth Smeeth (right) yesterday said it was her \u2018intention to vote for a deal\u2019 unless rights were \u2018undermined\u2019 by the deal\n\nJeremy Corbyn made clear yesterday that he wanted Labour MPs to vote against the revised withdrawal agreement, saying it would lead to a \u2018race to the bottom\u2019 on workers\u2019 rights.\n\nThe party has not said whether MPs who defy him would lose the party whip. Even so, as many as ten Labour MPs are reported to be considering voting for the deal if Mr Johnson\u2019s pledges on workers\u2019 rights are enshrined in law.\n\nRuth Smeeth yesterday said it was her \u2018intention to vote for a deal\u2019 unless rights were \u2018undermined\u2019 by the deal.\n\nLabour MPs John Mann, Sir Kevin Barron and Jim Fitzpatrick are also understood to support the agreement.\n\nMr Johnson will be dependent on some Labour support now that the DUP has said it will vote against the deal on \u2018Super Saturday\u2019 tomorrow.\n\nYesterday, the PM reached out to Labour MPs, saying: \u2018It is a good text, and it gets to the heart of what we want to achieve with the EU. It does also contain important provisions and commitments that this country gladly makes about our determination to maintain the highest possible standards on environment and social protection.\u2019\n\nThe agreement, announced yesterday morning, provides for a \u2018level playing field\u2019 on workers\u2019 rights and environmental protection and commits Britain to \u2018maintain... standards at the current high levels\u2019.\n\nHowever, the promise is part of the political agreement that sits alongside the withdrawal agreement \u2013 not the withdrawal agreement itself.\n\nMr Johnson (pictured alongside president of the European Comission Jean-Claude Juncker (second-from-right), Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay (left) and European Union chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier (right) during a press conference on the Brexit deal in Brussels) will be dependent on some Labour support now that the DUP has said it will vote against the deal on \u2018Super Saturday\u2019 tomorrow\n\nIt is understood that Downing Street is offering to write these protections into the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, the legislation which enacts the Brexit deal, to make them legally binding and get the Labour rebels on side.\n\nMr Kinnock and 18 other Labour MPs wrote to European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker earlier this month, declaring that they \u2018wish to see the British EU referendum result honoured without further delay\u2019.\n\nOne of the signatories told Huffington Post that around ten Labour MPs are now in the mood to vote for \u2018any deal\u2019.\n\nOn Wednesday night Mr Kinnock suggested that he could support the Brexit deal.\n\nSpeaking to Robert Peston on ITV, the MP was asked if he would back the deal. He said: \u2018Yes, if the text meets Labour\u2019s six tests... The level playing field is absolutely crucial.\u2019\n\nYesterday Mrs Smeeth said: \u2018It is my intention to vote for a deal unless Boris has completely undermined workers\u2019 rights, environmental rights and consumer rights.\u2019\n\nMr Mann said: \u2018I will vote for this deal... We voted to leave, and I\u2019m happier to leave with a deal that gives stability for businesses and jobs in this country, that\u2019s what a deal does... I think the deal will get through.\u2019\n\nAnother Labour backbencher told the Huffington Post he would consider voting for Mr Johnson\u2019s deal if it enshrined workers\u2019 rights. \u2018If Boris can write all these things on to the face of a Bill, and bring that Bill forward pronto, we can vote for it,\u2019 he said.\n\nLabour MP Graham Stringer, who campaigned for Brexit, said he would back the Bill if it is \u2018genuinely deal or No Deal\u2019.\n\nDespite the Prime Minister\u2019s pledges Mr Corbyn said he would not support the deal. \u2018These proposals risk triggering a race to the bottom on rights and protections: putting food safety at risk, cutting environmental standards and workers\u2019 rights, and opening up our NHS to a takeover,\u2019 he said.", "description": "At 10.51am, Mr Corbyn was asked for his view - and revealed his party would not be supporting the agreement.
