As projectiles go, a bowl of chunky liquid proves messy and lacks precision. Fist-size bread rolls are more effective \u2013 or, say, chocolate pudding catapulted from a spoon. In Russia though, the latest food fight is all about soup, and it\u2019s being hurled from the walls of the Kremlin via Twitter.\n\nThe soup war boiled over into social media this year, when @Russia (the official Twitter account for the Russian Federation\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs) tweeted: \u201cA timeless classic, #Borsch is one of Russia\u2019s most famous & beloved #dishes & a symbol of traditional cuisine\u201d.\n\nTo the average Twitter skimmer, Russians broadcasting about borsch may seem obvious and innocuous, but for Ukrainians, who consider borsch to be their national dish, the Russian tweet is wartime propaganda, especially considering the current occupation of Crimea and the latest territorial conflict in eastern Ukraine that\u2019s been raging since 2014. The Ukrainian Twittersphere responded with anger and humour, with comments like \u201cAs if stealing Crimea wasn\u2019t enough, you had to go and steal borsch from Ukraine as well\u201d.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n\u2022 The Cold War-era drink that rivals cola\n\n\u2022 How to drink vodka like a Russian\n\n\u2022 The truth about the humble French fry\n\nBorsch (\u0431\u043e\u0440\u0449 in Cyrillic) is a hearty soup, usually coloured red from beetroot (though green and white varieties of the soup exist), and for centuries, it has been a daily staple in the Ukrainian kitchen. For many, Russia\u2019s claim on such a quintessentially Ukrainian dish embodies a much larger trend of Russia\u2019s historical oppression of Ukrainian language, politics, and, above all, independence.\n\nAccording to Alex Kokcharov, a London-based political and economic risk analyst of Belarusian descent, the Russian Foreign Ministry\u2019s chest-beating around \u201cRussian\u201d borsch is, \u201canother attempt at cultural appropriation by Moscow\u201d. He explained that while \u201ca number of cultures claim borsch to be theirs \u2013 Ukraine, Belarus, Poland and Russia \u2013 Ukraine has the strongest claim for the dish.\u201d\n\n\u201cBorsch is most definitely from Ukraine,\u201d said Olesia Lew, a New York-based chef and head consultant for Veselka, the iconic Ukrainian diner in New York City\u2019s East Village, who is proud of her Ukrainian heritage. \u201cI say it\u2019s Ukrainian, not just from a nationalistic point of view, but because the soup hails from the land of Ukraine, and those ingredients have been found in the country\u2019s archaeological record into the distant past.\u201d\n\nSo, what about the millions of ethnic Russians who insist the red soup they love is most decidedly Russian?\n\n\u201cYes, Russian people claim it\u2019s their food,\u201d said Lew, \u201cBut it\u2019s a food they developed through occupation.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lew, borsch did not simply leak across the collective consciousness of Russian cuisine, but most likely entered the Soviet mainstream in the Stalinist era as a result of a concerted effort by the Kremlin. In his attempt to collectivise the largest country on Earth, Stalin tasked his Commissar of Food, Anastas Mikoyan, with establishing a Soviet national cuisine that catered to the more than 100 different \u201cnationalities\u201d (the Soviet term for the diverse ethnic populations) found in the USSR.\n\nRussian people claim it\u2019s their food, but it\u2019s a food they developed through occupation\n\nMikoyan\u2019s official study of cultural melting pots and mass food production led him to the United States, where he fell in love with hamburgers, hot dogs and ice cream. On his return, Mikoyan launched factory-produced ice cream across the Soviet Union and popularised efficient kitchen meals like kotleti (minced meat patties) in everyday cooking. In 1939, he published the propaganda-heavy Book of Tasty and Healthy Food, a standardised cookbook that was often gifted to newlywed couples in the Soviet Union from the Communist Party \u2013 a book that is still in print to this day.\n\n\u201cMikoyan needed to mass-produce a cultural identity for these Soviet foods,\u201d said Lew. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating to read what he picked from each place \u2013 be it Ukraine or Georgia \u2013 while remaining vague (eg \u201cadd meat\u201d), since at the time most ingredients were not widely available across the Soviet Union. The cookbook made all these dishes part of Soviet culture and thereby \u2018Russian\u2019, since Russia was the most important culture for the Soviets.\u201d\n\nSo what exactly does this Soviet food bible say about borsch? Chapter 6 (\u201cSoups\u201d) starts with cabbage-based Shchi, listing six different recipes, after which comes \u201cBorsch\u201d, then \u201cSummer Borsch\u201d (featuring squash, celery and beetroot greens), followed lastly by a differentiated \u201cUkrainian Borsch\u201d. (Imagine an American cookbook with multiple recipes for tacos, finishing with \u201cMexican tacos\u201d, and that\u2019s what it sounds like.)\n\nAccording to Mikoyan\u2019s recipe, standard borsch contains meat, beetroot, cabbage, root vegetables, onions, tomato paste, vinegar and sugar, while \u201cUkrainian\u201d borsch contains meat, cabbage, potatoes, beetroot, tomato paste, carrot, parsnip, onion, bacon, butter, vinegar and garlic, garnished with sour cream and chopped parsley. The Ukrainian recipe, framed as a separate iteration of the standardised version, is by far the most well-known today.\n\nWhile the broader world may consider borsch as a quintessentially \u201cRussian\u201d food, very few non-Russians are acquainted with the much less-exciting Russian variant shchi. As a basic cabbage soup, shchi is effectively borsch without the beetroot.\n\nAn 1823 Russian dictionary of Ukrainian words defined borsch as \u201cthe same thing as shchi\u201d, while an 1842 book of Russian etymology differentiates between Russian shchi (referring to sour cabbage) and Ukrainian borsch, a word that in fact references the soup\u2019s traditional ingredient of hogweed, or borschevik. Hogweed (Heracleum sphondylium) grows throughout Eurasia, but the plant flourishes in the marshy areas around the Danube and Dnipro (Dnepr in Russian) river deltas. Long before the modern-day countries of Russia or Ukraine existed, the people of the Black Sea region boiled soup from the pickled stems, leaves and flowers of the hogweed plant. Recipe books show that the Ukrainians added beetroot.\n\nSimilar-yet-separate culture and geography make the untangling of Russian and Ukrainian history an almost impossible task. Pro-Russian ideologues use the region\u2019s complex past to promote a rewritten history that draws a straight line from the current Russian regime back to the original Slavic civilisation. To that end, in its tweet, the Russian Foreign Ministry doubled down on its historical bias by reframing of the origins of borsch from \u201cRussian\u201d hogweed that dates back to the \u201cAncient Rus\u201d of the 10th Century.\n\nThe problem with this statement is that Ancient Rus was centred in Kyiv (Kiev in Russian), now the capital of Ukraine. Over the past millennium, Ukraine\u2019s largest city has been defined by repeated invasion, occupations and violent uprisings \u2013 often against the stronghold of Russian influence over Ukrainian politics. Rebranding Ukraine\u2019s national food staple as Russian is even more ironic and offensive in light of the Holodomor, Stalin\u2019s manmade famine of 1932-33, when forced collectivisation, aggressive grain procurement and confiscation of food stores led to the starvation of millions of Ukrainians. The exact number of dead, and whether the famine should be considered a genocide, remains a sticking point that is still debated and denied by Russians.\n\nThe cookbook made all these dishes part of Soviet culture and thereby \u2018Russian\u2019\n\nThe battle over borsch and its meaning continues online, most notably around the soup\u2019s official definition. Ukrainian Wikipedia lists borsch as \u201cfound in Ukrainian, Belarusian, Polish, Lithuanian, Iranian and Jewish national cuisines,\u201d but fails to mention Russian cuisine. Meanwhile, Russian-language Wikipedia says: \u201cBorsch is a type of beet-based soup, giving it a characteristic red colour. A traditional dish of the Eastern Slavs, it is a common first course in Ukrainian cuisine.\u201d\n\nAdmittedly, the wider, non-Slavic world views borsch as Russian, while Poles know it only as beloved Polish barszcz. This is also problematic since at least half of Ukraine was occupied by Poland for several centuries. Meanwhile, the common English spelling of borscht (with a \u201ct\u201d) derives from the Yiddish transliteration, since the soup was introduced to the west primarily by Jewish refugees fleeing Eastern Europe. Food travels with people, which is why borsch is now popular worldwide.\n\n\u201cThe soup is everywhere now,\u201d said Dima Martseniuk, head chef at Veselka. \u201cMaybe like 5% of Russians say it\u2019s theirs, but the other 95% know that borsch is Ukrainian. I mean, I\u2019m not going to pick a fight over it.\u201d More than nationalism, what matters to Martseniuk is how the soup tastes, since he makes and serves hundreds of gallons of borsch every week.\n\n\u201cMy grandma\u2019s classic recipe begins with pork stock boiled from rib bones. Then you have to use sweet cabbage \u2013 not the heavy kind. Then it\u2019s important that you cook the other ingredients on the side, in a separate frying pan. You have to saut\u00e9 them \u2013 the onion, carrot and shredded beetroot. Then you add sunflower oil, butter, spices, ketchup or tomato paste. And be sure to add something acidic \u2013 white vinegar or lemon juice \u2013 that helps preserve the deep red colour.\u201d\n\nHis less-traditional tip? \u201cTry making borsch in a pizza oven,\u201d Martseniuk said. The open flame apparently does wonders to the cooking and it tastes really good.\n\nVariation is the real beauty of borsch, and across Ukraine, I\u2019ve encountered countless varieties of the soup \u2013 with or without meat, beans or certain spices.\n\n\u201cThere are as many versions of borsch as there are Eastern European grandmas,\u201d said Tom Birchard, owner of Veselka. \u201cPeople have an emotional attachment to the soup, and everybody has their own idea of what it is.\u201d\n\nThere are as many versions of borsch as there are Eastern European grandmas\n\nI learned how to make borsch while living in Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine less than 30km from the Russian border. My teacher, Tanya Karabanova, was a bona fide babulya (Ukrainian grandmother) who insisted that the best borsch came from careful cutting and separate cooking of each ingredient so that every subtle vegetable flavour comes out. She was adamant that I never chop the cabbage into squares, resulting in what she called \u201cstolovaya\u201d, or \u201ccafeteria-style\u201d, borsch \u2013 the kind of soulless, watery-brown sustenance ladled out in schools, military bases or prisons. Instead, she told me to \u201crotate the cabbage downwards while shaving finely along the edge, forming long, fine, crescents of translucent cabbage\u201d.\n\n\u201cWith borsch, everyone is right,\u201d Lew explained. \u201cUkrainians are fiercely independent and defensive about their food and how authentic it is. For me, the key thing is to have the right beets \u2013 young, sweet summer beets. I\u2019m a big fan of meatless borsch \u2013 and I like beans in my borsch because that\u2019s the way I was raised. Sour cream, absolutely, and I like a bit of kvas (a fermented beverage) in the back note \u2013 the sour offsets the sweetness and richness of the beet.\u201d\n\nLew buys her ingredients in the farmers\u2019 markets of New York City, insisting on using the freshest ingredients. Descended from an immigrant family, Lew admits that like borsch, her own life story has spread across the globe.\n\n\u201cFood is part of culture and identity, but people move,\u201d she said. \u201cFood can be shared, and it can unite people \u2013 but food can travel. Things get sticky when you try to deny people the food that they have been raised on for generations, and I would never want to deny someone their cultural heritage simply because they were raised in Soviet times.\u201d\n\nFood Wars is a series from BBC Travel that invites you to feel the heat when passions flare around beloved dishes that shape a culture\u2019s identity.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.\n\nIf you liked this story, sign up for the weekly bbc.com features newsletter called \"The Essential List\".
