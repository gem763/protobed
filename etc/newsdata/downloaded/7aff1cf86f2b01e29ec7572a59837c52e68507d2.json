REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File Photo\n\nLONDON (Reuters) - British Airways pilots have canceled a strike set for Sept. 27 to create time for talks after 48 hours of industrial action earlier this month grounded 1,700 flights in a dispute over pay.\n\nThe pilot walkout - the first in the airline\u2019s history - was the latest high-profile setback for British Airways, and pilot union BALPA said it was time for \u201ca period of reflection before ... irreparable damage is done to the brand.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomeone has to take the initiative to sort out this dispute and with no sign of that from BA, the pilots have decided to take the responsible course,\u201d BALPA General Secretary Brian Strutton said in a statement.\n\n\u201cIn a genuine attempt at establishing a time-out for common sense to prevail, we have lifted the threat of the strike on the 27th September.\u201d\n\nNo further strike dates have been scheduled, but the union said it retained the right to announce more.\n\nBA has offered its pilots an 11.5% pay rise over three years, which it said would take the pay of its highest earning captains from 167,000 pounds ($208,450), plus 16,000 pounds in allowances, to just over 200,000 pounds.\n\nBALPA wants the pay deal to include profit-sharing for BA pilots, who on average earn around 90,000 pounds a year.\n\nIAG\u2019s shares rallied after BALPA canceled the strike and closed 1.9% higher.\n\n\u201cWe have just received this news. We are considering the implications and we will give updates in due course,\u201d British Airways said in a statement.", "description": "British Airways pilots have canceled a strike set for Sept. 27 to create time for talks after 48 hours of industrial action earlier this month grounded 1,700 flights in a dispute over pay.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431264429&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H171", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
