They lost that battle; Justice Kavanaugh sits on the court. They won\u2019t stop the assault until they can prove they were right to launch it.\n\nBecause people become fixated on their targets. Because #MeToo continues as a potent cultural force. Because as the court assumes an ever more powerful role in American life, confirmation hearings and their aftermath will become more brutal and never-ending.\n\nBecause the authority and legitimacy of future rulings that are not pleasing to progressives (most prominently, perhaps, on Roe v. Wade) can be undermined through footnotes that say \u201cthe 5-4 decision was joined by a justice credibly accused of sexual assault.\u201d\n\nBecause the steady drum of allegations diminishes not only Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s stature but that of the court itself, which will be helpful when Democrats attempt to pack it.\n\nBecause the crazier parts of the progressive left increasingly see politics as public theater, with heroes and villains, cheers and hisses from the audience, and costumes, such as outfits from \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\u201d Because modern politics is, for the lonely and strange on all sides, entertainment and diversion. And one\u2019s people must be entertained.\n\nBecause many progressives believe deep in their hearts that conservative men are both sexually obsessed and repressed, that conservatism is a way of looking at the world in which women are lesser, mere prey. They think this is behind everything, including conservative reservations about or opposition to abortion. In this view, conservative jurists who say things like \u201c60% of my clerks were women\u201d and \u201cI coach the girls\u2019 soccer and debate teams\u201d are engaged in an elaborate cover. They hate the modern world. Behind closed doors they\u2019re always swinging caveman\u2019s clubs.\n\nBecause where there\u2019s smoke there must be fire. There was Ms. Ford, then the Yale rumors. There\u2019s no way there isn\u2019t something to it.\n\nSo it will never end.\n\nFor Democrats, it is not \u201cgood politics,\u201d and most of them know it. What was done to Justice Kavanaugh had a positive impact on 2018 Senate outcomes\u2014for Republicans. There was a backlash. Women worried their sons and husbands would be targeted in a prosecutorial atmosphere that had abandoned due process.\n\nPeople are complicated. Jill Abramson, who covered the 1991 Clarence Thomas hearings as a reporter for The Wall Street Journal, told a story years later. Anita Hill had just testified. During a break, Ms. Abramson went for lunch in the Supreme Court cafeteria. As she stood waiting to pay for her food she chatted with another reporter about how Ms. Hill\u2019s testimony had been lethal for Judge Thomas. The cashier, a middle-aged black woman, overheard, gave Ms. Abramson a baleful look, and said: \u201cThey\u2019ll do anything to bring down a black man.\u201d It was clear she supported him. In Ms. Abramson\u2019s view it was an early sign of broader public opinion.\n\nIn an excerpt from a new book by two of its reporters, the New York Times this week famously reported another allegation of sexual misconduct by an undergraduate Mr. Kavanaugh. The Times later corrected its story to note the purported victim refused to be interviewed for the book and friends say she has no memory of such an incident. Democratic presidential contenders had already called for Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment. Soon they changed the subject. But they\u2019ll return to it.\n\nWhat is kind of horrifying is the extent to which all this stems from the charges brought last year by Ms. Ford. Mr. Kavanaugh, she said, had drunkenly attempted to force himself on her at a high-school party.\n\nI watched her testimony, as I\u2019ve written before, with a bias. In my experience women in such matters are telling the truth. I assumed her charges would be substantiated.\n\nAnd yet they were not, not at all, not even after a year. Not a single witness emerged to corroborate her account. The woman Ms. Ford described as a close, lifelong friend who could back up her account said she remembered no such party or gathering and had in fact never met Brett Kavanaugh. Now she admits she does not herself believe Ms. Ford\u2019s story.\n\nThroughout the drama those who believed Judge Kavanaugh\u2019s denials operated at a disadvantage: Any criticism of Ms. Ford would be treated as a smear, so there was almost none.\n\nI\u2019m reminded of this by the riveting book \u201cJustice On Trial,\u201d by Mollie Hemingway and Carrie Severino. Most such investigations are written by liberal journalists for a liberal audience; Ms. Hemingway and Ms. Severino are conservatives who went forward with journalistic seriousness and paid attention to information others might ignore. They suggest \u201cwhere there\u2019s smoke there\u2019s fire\u201d can\u2019t be applied to the Kavanaugh case because from the moment he was nominated to the court he was targeted by pyromaniacs.\n\nA leftist feminist group linked him to allegations of sexual harassment against another judge, for whom he\u2019d clerked a quarter-century before. An activist group accused him of supporting the \u201cproblematic trope that the Constitution should be \u2018colorblind.\u2019 \u201d Another group said his judicial philosophy amounted to supporting the \u201cwhite supremacist patriarchy.\u201d\n\nThis was par for the course for a Republican nominee, but soon after Ms. Ford\u2019s charges came the New Yorker story in which a Yale classmate of Judge Kavanaugh said that during her freshman year he exposed himself at a drunken dorm party and caused her to touch his genitals. But the story didn\u2019t hold\u2014the reporters were unable to find a witness to corroborate it, the accuser had \u201csignificant gaps\u201d in her memories, and it took six days of \u201ccarefully assessing her memories\u201d and consulting with an attorney provided by Democrats, to name Judge Kavanaugh.\n\nThe since-disgraced lawyer Michael Avenatti then brought forward a woman who claimed she was gang raped at a high-school party by Mr. Kavanaugh and his friends, as were other young women. Her story fell apart too.\n\nThen a charge came in through Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse. A constituent had called his office to say a man believed to be Mr. Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted a woman on a boat in Newport, R.I., in 1985. Now there was a fourth accuser! Eventually the Judiciary Committee tracked down the constituent, an anti-Trump activist who\u2019d called for a military coup. He later recanted his accusations on Twitter and apologized.\n\nA letter to Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019s office claimed Judge Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted a woman while driving home from a party. The accuser was a political activist who later admitted her charge was \u201cjust a ploy\u201d made because she was angry. Asked if she\u2019d ever met Judge Kavanaugh she said, \u201cOh Lord, no.\u201d\n\nIn both cases the accusers seemed shocked you couldn\u2019t just . . . lie.\n\n\u201cNormally the burden of proof is on the accuser,\u201d write Ms. Hemingway and Ms. Severino, \u201cbut the media were not even paying lip service to that principle.\u201d\n\nThey weren\u2019t.\n\nThe charges will probably never stop, but at this point many of us, having seen what Justice Kavanaugh was put through because of ideology and politics, will never find them believable.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
