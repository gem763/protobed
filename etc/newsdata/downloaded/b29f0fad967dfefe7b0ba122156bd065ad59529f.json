Especially over the past decade, anti-abortion groups have used a barrage of state legislation to limit the number of abortions that actually take place, which has proved an effective alternative to outright bans on the procedure. The Supreme Court pushed back against this strategy in Whole Woman\u2019s Health, calling out the Texas legislature for intentionally placing \u201csubstantial obstacles\u201d in the path of women who wanted to terminate their pregnancies. By agreeing to hear a similar case about what appears to be a similar law, the current Court has signaled that it may not continue this approach. Over time, Alvar\u00e9 said, the Court might gradually shift more power to regulate abortion back to the states, including via purported health-and-safety laws like the ones in Texas and Louisiana. \u201cSome of the justices who don\u2019t like Roe may use this case not to overturn Roe but to say, \u2018Would you look at this mess?\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cThere may be some who want to just say, \u2018We\u2019d really like, as a Supreme Court, to do something other than sort out state abortion laws.\u2019\u201d\n\nSpeculation about Supreme Court cases on abortion often gets reduced to one overly simplistic question: Will Roe v. Wade be overturned? It\u2019s unlikely that the justices will use June Medical Services, or any other single case, to summarily strike down Roe in some dramatic one-line declaration. What\u2019s more likely is a gradual unwinding of abortion rights: a decision in June Medical Services that walks back the outcome in Whole Woman\u2019s Health, a willingness to entertain cases that might have previously been refused a hearing. The Court will surely have many opportunities to do that: A recent spate of state bans on abortion after six or eight weeks of gestation is currently winding its way through the lower courts. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be interesting to see what happens with the flashier, scorch-the-earth cases that are currently being litigated across the country,\u201d Sepper said. \u201cIf the Court took up one of them, it would be much, much harder to think that they hadn\u2019t, in fact, reversed Roe and Casey.\u201d\n\nAbortion-rights advocates fear this kind of outcome, painting the current Court as irresponsibly cavalier toward women\u2019s rights. Even the liberal justices have said as much: This spring, Stephen Breyer warned his colleagues against casually overturning precedents, clearly alluding to abortion, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg described Clarence Thomas\u2019s criticism of abortion jurisprudence as \u201cmore heat than light.\u201d But the conservative wing of the Court may see an opportunity at hand: not for a radical act of revision, but for a chance to end the endless legal disputes over abortion.\n\n\u201cThe hype in the newspapers is usually, \u2018To overturn Roe and Casey would be to demonstrate partisanship,\u2019\u201d Alvar\u00e9 said. But John Roberts, the conservative chief justice who is now considered the Court\u2019s primary swing vote, may view the Court\u2019s next moves as \u201cthe faithful application of constitutional analysis,\u201d and a way to ensure \u201cthe future legitimacy of the Court.\u201d\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.
