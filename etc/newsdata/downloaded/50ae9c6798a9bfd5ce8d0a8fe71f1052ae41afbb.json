WARNER BROS. PICTURES\n\nThe dark comic-book movie \"Joker\" made a ton of money over the weekend, and social media is irked that some of it might be going to a convicted pedophile.\n\nOne crucial scene features a transformed and fully face-painted Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) dancing down stairs to the tune of British glam rocker Gary Glitter's \"Rock and Roll (Part 2),\" a 1970s hit on both sides of the ocean. The song has found its way into many sports arenas as a stadium anthem and occasionally into movies such as \"The Replacements\" and \"Meet the Fockers.\"\n\nBut Glitter (real name Paul Gadd) was sentenced in 2015 to 16 years in jail after being convicted of sexually abusing three young girls. He was found guilty of one count of attempted rape, four counts of indecent assault and one count of sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 13.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Warner Bros. for comment.\n\n'Joker' gets the last laugh:$93.5M and the biggest October opening ever\n\nSpoilers! The 5 most shocking 'Joker' moments that everyone will be talking about\n\nJoaquin Phoenix dances to Gary Glitter's \"Rock and Roll (Part 2)\" in \"Joker,\" a questionable decision for some given Glitter's criminal history. (Photo: NIKO TAVERNISE/WARNER BROS)\n\nIt's the latest bit of controversy for a movie that, while scoring a record-setting October opening of $93.5 million, has also ruffled feathers for its nihilistic take on the iconic Batman villain, shocking violence and security concerns at movie theaters.\n\nMuch of the uproar about Glitter centers on how the disgraced musician, who co-wrote what's popularly known as \"The 'Hey' Song,\" stands to receive royalties from the success of \"Joker\" while he's behind bars.\n\nFor the all the unease and tension that the #Joker stirs up... my British brothers and sisters are probably gonna be the most uncomfortable with Gary Glitter. pic.twitter.com/t8CAEVq7Az \u2014 Rahul Kohli (@RahulKohli13) October 4, 2019\n\n\"So when you buy a ticket remember who's getting some of that,\" @sharonhollydav1 tweeted.\n\nI\u2019m refusing to watch any @wbpictures or anything made by #WarnerBrothers@DCComics because @jokermovie uses music by a convicted notorious peadophile Gary Glitter. And he will receive payment for use of his music. So when you buy a ticket remember who\u2019s getting some of that \u2014 chazdavies\ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc77\udb40\udc6c\udb40\udc73\udb40\udc7f\ud83c\udf08\ud83c\udf08 (@sharonhollydav1) October 7, 2019\n\nIdly wondering how much Gary Glitter will be making in royalties from his appearance on the JOKER soundtrack pic.twitter.com/F51WzQ2hra \u2014 Paul Haine (@paul_haine) October 3, 2019\n\n\"I will pass on paying to see #JokerMovie until they remove convicted pedophile Gary Glitter's song or donate royalties from it to a child abuse charity,\" @hooperstarium wrote.\n\nDancing with the Devil ... I will pass on paying to see #JokerMovie until they remove convicted pedophile Gary Glitter 's song or donate royalties from it to a child abuse charity. C'mon @wbpictures what the \"hell\" were you thinking when you green lighted this flick?

On one level, the film\u2019s provocations are deliberately juvenile, bordering in on trollish.\n\n\n\nIn actuality, the most morally questionable aspect of the film is the use of a Gary Glitter song, and the film is well aware of this. pic.twitter.com/h25dHrc4js \u2014 Darren Mooney (@Darren_Mooney) October 1, 2019\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2019/10/07/joker-ignites-uproar-featuring-gary-glitter-song/3898804002/", "description": "Joaquin Phoenix's 'Joker' is already controversial for its violent content, but now there's uproar around a scene set to a Gary Glitter song.", "authors": ["Brian Truitt", "Published P.M.
