So, he has a lot on his plate. But while he was at home this summer (and about to start his own vacation), Loring re-staged his production Battle of the Birds for (and with) the local community.\n\nBattle of the Birds tells stories that have been handed down through generations of storytellers. They were also captured on wax cylinder recordings from about a hundred years ago, made by ethnologist James Alexander Teit. It was these recordings that inspired Loring to retell a story he'd heard from his own elders. He says, \"I think all of these stories have amazing lessons and things that they offer \u2013 insights. With Battle of the Birds, it's about domestic violence. But not just domestic violence with anybody \u2013 it's a leader in the community. The scope and scale of these stories is actually very similar to Greek mythology. They involve these epic struggles, but also very human realities are embedded within each of the stories.\"\n\nKevin Loring opens up about Battle of the Birds and a big moment for the Indigenous theatre community. 4:03\n\nIn this video made by filmmaker Daniel Lins da Silva, you get a glimpse of Battle of the Birds. And Loring opens up about why it's so meaningful that Indigenous Theatre is taking its place at the nation's art centre: \"I think we in the Indigenous theatre community have always felt sort of like we needed a place at the National Arts Centre, at the nation's arts centre. I think the institution realized that it was well past time to start something like this. So it's a big deal, it's a huge opportunity for Indigenous artists across the country and we will present, in our first season, international Indigenous artists.\"\n\nM\u00f2shkamo, the Indigenous Arts Festival, is on at the National Arts Centre (NAC) in Ottawa until September 29. Next week on the season 5 premiere of CBC Arts: Exhibitionists, we go behind the scenes of the launch of the Indigenous Theatre at the NAC.\n\nStream CBC Arts: Exhibitionists or catch it on CBC Television Friday nights at 11:30pm (12am NT) and Sundays at 3:30pm (4pm NT).
