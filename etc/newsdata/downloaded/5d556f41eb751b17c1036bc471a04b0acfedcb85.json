Facebook is joined by 20 other members in the Libra Association, which will govern the currency. However, the original idea for libra was generated inside Facebook by Facebook employees.\n\nGiven Facebook's insistence that libra is separate from its company, lawmakers wanted to know how Facebook would make good on its promise to wait for U.S. regulatory approval. Zuckerberg said if the Libra Association voted to move forward without the clearances Facebook feels it needs, \"we would be forced to leave the organization.\"\n\nEarlier in the hearing, Rep. Nydia Velazquez, D-N.Y., asked if Zuckerberg would also wait for Congress to provide an updated legal framework for regulators who will decide whether the approve the project. Zuckerberg said he thinks Congress has an appropriate oversight role over regulators already, which Velazquez said she takes as a \"no.\"\n\nHowever, Facebook is still funding the Libra Association, Zuckerberg said in his testimony. The members have not paid their $10 million fees yet, and Zuckerberg said that figure could change.\n\nThe Libra Association recently saw several key members depart, including , , and , among others.\n\nSubscribe to CNBC on YouTube.\n\nWatch: Mark Zuckerberg's opening statement to Congress", "description": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified on cryptocurrency in front of the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday.", "authors": ["Lauren Feiner"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106198521-1571841014104gettyimages-1177730203.jpeg?v=1571841040", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
