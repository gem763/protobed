(David Paul Morris/Bloomberg News).\n\nShortly after President Trump fired off a tweet Tuesday urging the Federal Reserve to boost the economy by slashing interest rates, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said cutting rates now would be a mistake.\n\nTop Fed officials, including Rosengren, will meet Sept. 18 to determine if interest rates should decline or stay the same. Trump has tweeted 34 times in the past month demanding that the Fed lower the funds rate by a significant amount as recession fears have risen, but Fed officials remain divided on whether even a modest cut is warranted.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a free lunch. There are costs to accommodating at a time when the economy is doing reasonably well,\u201d Rosengren told The Washington Post in an interview before his speech Tuesday at Stonehill College in Easton, Mass.\n\n[This is the factor that's likely to determine whether there is a U.S. recession]\n\nRosengren said the U.S. economy is in a \u201crelatively strong\u201d place with low unemployment, rising wages and solid growth driven by consumer spending. He does not see a need for lower interest rates until there are clearer signs of distress from the trade war on consumers. If the Fed lowers rates too soon, he is worried it would leave little firepower left to fight bigger problems later on.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to apply accommodation at a time when you don\u2019t need it, in part because you won\u2019t have it when you do need it and in part because there are side effects from pushing interest rates very low. It encourages people to take more risk,\u201d Rosengren said.\n\nThe benchmark U.S. interest rate is just shy of 2.25 percent, a low level by historical standards, but Trump has argued it should be 1.25 percent \u2014 if not lower.\n\n[Global markets rattled amid Brexit, U.S.-China trade war standoffs; Dow falls nearly 300 points]\n\n\u201cGermany, and so many other countries, have negative interest rates, \u2018they get paid for loaning money,\u2019 and our Federal Reserve fails to act! Remember, these are also our weak currency competitors!\u201d Trump tweeted Tuesday, suggesting he would even favor negative rates in the United States, an extremely unusual situation where the bank pays people who take on a mortgage or borrow money to start a business.\n\nTrump has in the past said that a swift interest rate cut by the Fed would lead the Dow Jones industrial average to climb by thousands of points. In August, the president tweeted repeated insults at Fed Chair Jerome H. Powell, calling Powell an \u201cenemy,\u201d \u201ca golfer who can\u2019t putt\u201d and someone with \u201chorrendous lack of vision.\u201d\n\n[The Trump v. Obama economy -- in 15 charts]\n\nThere\u2019s widespread agreement among economists that the U.S. economy is slowing, but experts are divided on whether the nation is likely slip into a downturn by 2021. The manufacturing sector is already in a recession, business spending has dried up amid the trade war and the bond market is signaling trouble ahead, but stocks remain near record highs, companies continue to hire, and consumers keep spending.\n\nThe Fed lowered interest rates in July for the first time in over a decade, but Rosengren and Kansas City Fed President Esther George voted against the cut. Rosengren and George are two of the 10 Fed officials who will vote on the next interest rate decision in two weeks.\n\nWall Street investors and White House officials are watching their views closely as it is unlikely the Fed would lower rates substantially with such vocal dissents. Investors are currently betting the Fed will do a modest reduction in September and another one by the end of the year, a much more gradual downshift than what Trump wants.\n\nPowell hinted in a recent speech that the Fed is likely to cut rates a quarter point in September to just below 2 percent, but he said there are \u201csignificant risks\u201d from the trade war and the central bank can only do so much to minimize the negative impact.\n\nNarayana Kocherlakota, the former head of the Minneapolis Fed from 2009 to 2015, has been one of the most outspoken voices calling for interest rate cuts, but even he said he probably would not endorse more than a small cut in September. Going lower could spook business leaders and investors, he said.\n\n\u201cIf I were sitting in that room, I\u2019d be pretty loathe to cut 50 basis points,\u201d said Kocherlakota, who is now an economics professor at the University of Rochester. \u201cThere is a risk if you do cut by 50 basis points, you\u2019re sending a message that we see something really bad on the horizon.\u201d\n\nTrump wants a strong economy as he campaigns for reelection in 2020, but his trade war has caused business investment to dry up and there is growing concern consumers could close their wallets as well, especially if Trump\u2019s tariffs cause prices of shoes, clothing, phones and other popular products to jump.\n\n\u201cClearly there is a downside risk that trade or geopolitical problems could escalate, resulting in a much weaker situation than is currently anticipated,\u201d Rosengren said. \u201cWhat has prevented the economy from being stronger is the slowdown occurring globally and the tariffs.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s latest tariffs on China took effect on Sept. 1, causing the prices of clothing and shoes made in China and shipped to the United States to rise.\n\nWhile Rosengren said these tariffs are \u201clikely to be more noticeable\u201d to consumers, he still thinks consumption will remain strong since so many people have jobs and are enjoying higher pay and lower gas prices.\n\nFor the economy to grow about 2 percent, consumption only needs to expand at about a 3 percent annual pace. This spring, it grew at over 4.5 percent, according to the latest government data.\n\n\u201cWhen you have really strong consumption, it makes up for a lot of weakness elsewhere,\u201d he said.\n\nRelated:\n\nThis is the factor that\u2019s likely to determine whether there\u2019s a U.S. recession\n\nThe Trump vs. Obama economy \u2014 in 15 charts\n\nTrump wants the Fed to save the economy, but central bankers say they can only do so much", "description": "Trump wants the Fed to boost the economy by slashing interest rates, but Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren warns, 'This isn't a free lunch.
