Then you'll need to wait until the Lightnite game is developed.\n\nIn either case, this game development announcement is likely to make a lot of gamers who are fans of lightning network happy. Satoshi\u2019s Games, an 8-bit gaming platform built on top of Lightning Network (Bitcoin\u2019s transaction layer), which combines nostalgic video game elements with the Bitcoin and Lightning elements, offers several different games to player. Their list now also includes Lightnite \u2013 an online multiplayer battle-royale game \u201cbased on a low poly minimalism and bitcoin rewards,\u201d as the blog post describes it.\n\nWhat that means is that:\n\nevery digital interaction between players results in a monetary reward or penalty: shoot others and earn BTC, get shot and loose BTC;\n\nplayers can buy in-game items in Lightnite\u2019s store with Bitcoin, using the in-game balance or through a micro-transaction from their wallets;\n\nplayers can also earn real BTC by picking up certain items in the game, usually left by \"dead\" players;\n\nthe in-game bitcoin balance updates in real-time every time a player shoots another, gets shot, or picks up a valuable item;\n\nplayers can exit the game when they want to and instantly withdraw their balance into their wallets;\n\nthere are two modes available: Bitcoin-integrated and non-Bitcoin-integrated; which means that non-Bitcoin users can play it too, via the mode with no Bitcoin features, and they\u2019ll get in-game points instead of Bitcoin.\n\nAs for satoshis.games, the creators explain, the Lightning Network is used to integrate Bitcoin micro-transactions within Lightnite. To start playing and actually use the transaction option, players need to download a wallet that supports the Lightning Network and send a few satoshis to that wallet. Non-BTC users don\u2019t need to do this step, and they can use fiat to buy items in the store.\n\nNon-BTC users will \u201ceventually get attracted by the enhanced interactivity allowed by the Bitcoin-integration and start experimenting with this innovative technology,\u201d the game creators said. \u201cThis is also a way through which we want to contribute to the Bitcoin mass adoption.\u201d\n\nSatoshi\u2019s Games say that, once Lightnite is out of the development, it will be available on all the major games distribution platforms, as well as on Elixir, which is a new game distribution platform by Satoshi's Games. To get there faster, they\u2019ve launched a crowdfunding campaign, and the supporters will get early access to the game.\n\nWatch the Lightnite trailer here:", "description": "Ready to go all battle royale in a multi-player battle game on the Bitcoin Lightning Network and earn Bitcoin (BTC) while playing?
