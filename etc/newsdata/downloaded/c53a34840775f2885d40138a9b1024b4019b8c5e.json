It asked the company to stop buying more companies, review its portfolio and costs and add new board members, laying the groundwork for an attack on one of the biggest corporate targets ever.\n\nBy Monday, about seven weeks after Elliott made its suggestions, AT&T committed to buying back stock, adding two new directors and reviewing its portfolio.\n\nThere are \u201cno sacred cows\u201d when it comes to reviewing the business portfolio, long-serving CEO Randall Stephenson told analysts. While Stephenson had planned to retire soon, he pledged to stay through 2020 and oversee the changes himself.\n\nWhile DirecTV will be an important piece of AT&T\u2019s strategy over the next three years, AT&T will consider multiple options, including partnerships and other structures, Stephenson said.\n\nAT&T shares were up 4.8% to $38.70 in midday trading.\n\nStephenson took control of the negotiations with Elliott, with the two sides meeting in New York and Dallas and often by phone to reach Monday\u2019s announcement, a person familiar with the talks said.\n\nElliott got almost everything it asked for but made no commitments that prohibit it from exerting further pressure on the company, an unusual outcome in activist fights.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The at&t logo is seen at their store in Times Sqaure in New York April 21, 2010. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton/File Photo\n\nIn a sign the two sides had quickly found common ground, Stephenson told Reuters on Monday that a standstill agreement, which could have prevented Elliott from taking further action, did not come up.\n\nPublicly, Elliott was keeping a low profile, commending the company but saying nothing beyond its statement.\n\nAs a first step, AT&T plans to name a new board member with expertise in technology and cost cutting soon, Stephenson said on an analyst call in which he also had warm words for the hedge fund.\n\nA second board member will be named next year and will have media credentials, the person familiar with the matter said, adding that both sides are still reviewing possible candidates.\n\nTo reduce its debt of $153.5 billion at the end of the third quarter, AT&T has been on a selling spree. Over the weekend, it sold Central European Media Enterprises Ltd (CME) to investment group PPF in a cash deal valued at about $2.1 billion.\n\nThe company expects to generate $14 billion through asset sales and other initiatives by the end of this year. It has reduced its net debt by $12.7 billion so far this year.\n\nWEAK RESULTS\n\nMonday\u2019s announcement presented an \u201cawkward conundrum\u201d as AT&T issued financial guidance through 2022 that was ahead of Wall Street\u2019s consensus, though its quarterly results fell short of expectations in every segment, Jonathan Chaplin, an analyst with New Street Research, said in a note.\n\nAT&T lost 1.2 million premium TV customers, which includes DirecTV, as well as 195,000 streaming video customers, as it has sought to roll off subscribers who had signed up with price promotions.\n\nRevenue from WarnerMedia was down 4.4% from the previous year to $7.8 billion as it made less money from the Warner Bros. movie studio.\n\nTotal operating revenue in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 fell to $44.59 billion from $45.74 billion a year earlier, missing analyst expectations of $45 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv..\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nExcluding items, AT&T earned 94 cents per share, above analysts\u2019 estimates of 93 cents.\n\nThe carrier added 101,000 net new phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill during the third quarter. Wall Street estimated it would gain 61,000 net new customer additions, according to a note from Cowen analysts.", "description": "AT&T Inc on Monday unveiled a three-year strategic plan that included selling up to $10 billion worth of businesses next year, paying off all its debt from the purchase of Time Warner and adding two new board members, bowing to pressure from activist investor Elliott Management.", "authors": ["Sheila", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191028&t=2&i=1445910041&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9R0WS", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
