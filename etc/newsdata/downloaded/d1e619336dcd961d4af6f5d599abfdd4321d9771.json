Some of those mistakes cost teams wins, and those extra losses can cost players, coaches and executives their jobs. Yet, the officials don\u2019t receive the same level of job scrutiny.\n\nBruce Arians would like that to change.\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nCoaches and players are forced, contractually, to speak to the media. When Arians\u2019 teams struggle, he\u2019s going to have to answer questions about it. If he loses too many games, he\u2019ll get fired. He gets it. That\u2019s part of the job.\n\nHe would like to see the same level of accountability for officials. After Arians\u2019 Tampa Bay Buccaneers had a crucial fumble return nullified because of a quick whistle, Arians wanted to turn the focus toward the officials. Ironically, speaking out on the officials might result in a fine from the NFL.\n\nBruce Arians wants officials to be accountable\n\nOn an ill-advised fake field goal late in Sunday\u2019s game, Tennessee Titans punter Brett Kern got hit hard by linebacker Devin White. He fumbled and Bucs safety Andrew Adams had a clear path to the end zone when he recovered. But a whistle blew, and that was the end of the play and any return. The Buccaneers ended up losing 27-23.\n\nYou can understand why Arians isn\u2019t pleased with the officials.\n\n\u201cEverybody except one guy saw the ball out, and blew a quick whistle,\u201d Arians said in a news conference Monday. \u201cMy biggest thing is referees aren\u2019t held accountable. Coaches get fired, general managers get fired, players get cut. Referees aren\u2019t accountable and it\u2019s a shame. It\u2019s been that way for 40 years, and now that we\u2019ve got a new agreement it\u2019ll be that way for 40 more years.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nOfficiating mistakes are part of the game, and that will never change. The NFL game is very fast and calls will be missed. But instead of an empty apology for missing a call, which is likely coming from the NFL to the Buccaneers at some point this week, Arians wants something more.\n\nBucs might have won without quick whistle\n\nMostly officials get criticized by fans but there isn\u2019t too much accountability, at least not to the level most everyone else in the NFL faces.\n\nAnd Arians seems convinced that with the correct call in that spot, the Buccaneers would have won that road game.\n\n\u201cNot to beat a dead horse, but an inadvertent whistle ... if we have those last three minutes and some change with a three-point lead and win the game, I think everybody is writing different stories, talking different things,\u201d Arians said. \u201cSo it was more than just a play.\u201d\n\nOfficiating has been a big story, and it is most years. Fans complain about missed calls, and there have been some bad ones this season.\n\nArians just wants to see some more ownership of those mistakes. It\u2019s not unreasonable.\n\n\u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nFrank Schwab is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
