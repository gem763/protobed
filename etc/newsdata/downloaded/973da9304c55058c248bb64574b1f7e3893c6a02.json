In a report earlier this year to counter criticism, China said it had arrested nearly 13,000 people it described as \"terrorists\" and had broken up hundreds of \"terrorist gangs\" in the region since 2014.\n\n'Hard for him to learn of this news'\n\nTohti has been in solitary confinement for years, according to liberal EU legislator Phil Bennion, and has not seen his family since 2017. Bennion said he hoped Beijing would allow a delegation of EU legislators to visit him in prison.\n\nIt was also not immediately clear if word of the prize would reach Tohti.\n\n\"I hope this can bring him some peace,\" Li Fangping, the lawyer who represented Tohti at his trial in 2014, told Reuters News Agency.\n\nBut he added: \"I think it will be very hard for him to learn of this news.\"\n\nLast month, Tohti was also awarded the Vaclav Havel Human Rights prize by the Council of Europe, which is not an EU institution but acts as Europe's human rights watchdog.\n\n190908094929075\n\nThe Sakharov Prize is named after Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov and was created in 1988 to honour individuals or groups who defend human rights and fundamental freedoms. Last year's winner was Oleg Sentsov, a Ukrainian filmmaker who was recently released from a Russian prison camp after being accused of plotting acts of \"terrorism\".\n\nOthers on the shortlist for the award this year were Marielle Franco, a Brazilian city councilwoman who campaigned for Afro-Brazilian and LGBT rights before she was shot dead last year, native Brazilian leader Chief Raoni, environmentalist Claudelice Silva dos Santos and five Kenyan students known as The Restorers who developed an app to support girls subjected to genital mutilation.\n\nThe prize will be presented in a ceremony in Strasbourg, France on December 18.", "description": "The economics professor was sentenced to life in prison by Chinese court in 2014 on separatism charges.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/24/60ebf9e3ecd44e8e9cf7abbd142d2e22_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
