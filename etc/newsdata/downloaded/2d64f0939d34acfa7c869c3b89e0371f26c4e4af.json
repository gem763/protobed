And that\u2019s just the start.\n\nAs Wall Street tries to stamp out its longstanding reputation for bawdy misbehavior, some denizens fond of the old culture have been finding periodic refuge at industry conferences. After dark, many events are known for lewd comments and other interactions that would never fly back at the office.\n\nThen on Tuesday, billionaire Ken Fisher took the stage at a summit for wealth and investment industry leaders in California and stunned the crowd by comparing the process of gaining a client\u2019s trust to \u201ctrying to get into a girl\u2019s pants\u201d and also talking about genitalia. He has been trying to explain his remarks ever since, apologizing repeatedly.\n\nAmong many who regularly attend industry gatherings, the surprise in Fisher\u2019s remarks was that he spoke them into a microphone. In interviews, financial professionals, including more than a half-dozen women, said they hear such comments at many events -- but it\u2019s usually after the formal presentations are done and crowds regroup in networking sessions, restaurants and bars.\n\n\u201cThe sad truth is, I\u2019m not shocked by what was said,\u201d said Gail Graham, a 37-year veteran of the financial industry who held senior posts at Fidelity Investments and United Capital Financial Advisers and has run her own consulting business for wealth advisers. She hopes Fisher\u2019s comments will prompt the industry to finally change.\n\n\u201cThose kinds of things have been said in front of me for a very long time\u201d while socializing at conferences, she said. \u201cAt the same time, the networking is the most important part.\u201d\n\nRoofy Jokes\n\nWomen -- often a small fraction of conference attendees -- also described trying to network with men who respond with elevator eyes, comment on their appearance, or reach out mid-conversation to touch their hair, arms or backs. One woman said she keeps having the same experience: Male attendees drink and get handsy. Because the events happen away from the office and human resources departments, people are willing to cross boundaries, she said.\n\n\u201cPeople joke about putting roofies in my drink -- different people, different events, it\u2019s a theme,\u201d said Sonya Dreizler, a consultant. She thought she would be treated better by other attendees as her career advanced. At some conferences it\u2019s improved, she said, but at most it hasn\u2019t.\n\nAlmost everyone else interviewed for this story spoke on the condition they not be named. Most noted that they never reported incidents. Some said they want to make connections and do business, and that complaining risks creating enemies instead.\n\nThe venue where Fisher spoke is meant to be private. Tiburon Strategic Advisors hosts the summit for chief executive officers, charging a $25,000 membership fee that includes access to the semi-annual events in San Francisco and New York. Unlike many conferences hungry for attention, Tiburon\u2019s are closed the media. The idea is to create \u201cthe only true forums where financial services industry CEOs\u201d can freely discuss business opportunities, according to the company\u2019s website.\n\nLooking to Improve\n\nFisher\u2019s remarks came to light after Alex Chalekian, the founder of Lake Avenue Financial, posted a video on Twitter calling them \u201cabsolutely horrifying.\u201d The incident has gripped the investment world, even if it wasn\u2019t the first time a prominent member of the industry said something vulgar they soon regretted.\n\n\u201cI realize this kind of language has no place in our company or industry,\u201d Fisher said in a statement Thursday. \u201cI sincerely apologize.\u201d\n\nTiburon added Fisher\u2019s name to a list of attendees it has banned over the years for a variety of reasons, including comments that were insulting or disrespectful, Managing Partner Charles \u201cChip\u201d Roame said in an open letter posted online Thursday. He said he had encouraged speakers this week to address topics including the lack of women in the industry.\n\n\u201cComments like we heard on Tuesday, in my opinion, will discourage women from participating in the wealth & investment management industry,\u201d Roame wrote, seeking suggestions on addressing that problem and in enlisting more women and minority speakers for future events. \u201cHelp us.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Gwen Everett in New York at geverett10@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Michael J.
