The 15-year-old\u2019s actions involved \u201cpolitical advocacy on a question of significant public consequence,\u201d U.S. District Judge Lance Walker wrote Thursday as he placed a temporary restraining order on the suspension.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCape Elizabeth School District had argued that Mansmann\u2019s note amounted to defamation not covered by the First Amendment. They also said they responded appropriately to a school disruption and an invasion of another student\u2019s rights. But Walker decided the teenager was likely to prevail in court.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union of Maine hailed the decision as a reminder that students \u201cdo not check their rights at the schoolhouse gate,\u201d as well as a win for open discussion of what Mansmann called \u201cone of the most pressing issues of our time \u2014 the prevalence of sexual violence and the danger of inaction by those in positions of power.\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeaking up about sexual assault is already difficult for young people,\u201d Alison Beyea, executive director of the ACLU of Maine, said in a statement. \u201cIf this punishment had been allowed to stand, it would have only made it more difficult.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe decision was also welcomed by Mansmann\u2019s mother, Shael Norris. The case was filed under Norris\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cAll my daughter ever wanted was for students to feel safe speaking out about sexual assault,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of her for standing up for what she believes in.\u201d\n\nSchool district superintendent Donna Wolfram said in a statement that the \u201csafety of our students is our highest priority\u201d and that the district will keep reviewing and updating its policies to meet both its needs and state law.\n\nBut the district did not say Friday whether it plans to pursue a punishment for Mansmann. It also did not comment on shorter suspensions given to two other girls who, according to Judge Walker\u2019s ruling, posted similar notes in another bathroom after Mansmann\u2019s was taken down.\n\nAD\n\nThe controversy began last month when a student flagged the first mirror note to administrators. Officials went on to interview more than 40 students and review security footage to figure out who the notes referred to and who put them up, Walker wrote.\n\nAD\n\nThen, the family of an unidentified male student went to administrators with concerns. The student said he\u2019d been ostracized and had left school for several days.\n\nMansmann\u2019s mother has said her daughter initially got assurances there would be no punishment. But on Oct. 4 \u2014 the same day Mansmann opened up to the media about the controversial note and the concerns behind it \u2014 the teenager got a letter from administrators imposing the suspension and warning that \u201cany future actions of this sort\u201d could lead to expulsion, according to Walker\u2019s ruling.\n\nAD\n\nThe school district said at the time that it could not comment on the specifics of the incident, but officials told local media they did not believe there was a rapist on campus. The district said it was obliged to act \u201cwhen a student\u2019s speech bullies another student \u2026 even if that same student has also spoken out on a matter of public concern.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMansmann\u2019s family quickly appealed the sanction, and the sophomore was told she could keep going to class while the matter was pending, the Portland Press Herald reported. Already a vocal activist who recently co-led a \u201csummit\u201d on sexual violence, Mansmann said she wanted to get people talking about concerns that administrators were overlooking some students\u2019 complaints of harassment and assault.\n\n\u201cWhy is this person self-identifying as the [alleged] rapist?\u201d Mansmann told the Press Herald.\n\nAD\n\nMany students rallied around her. How could the sticky notes constitute bullying, they argued, when they never identified a culprit? Dozens walked out of class one morning with signs declaring, \u201cI choose to believe survivors\u201d and \u201cRape culture has got to go,\u201d local news outlets reported.\n\nIn his response to Mansmann\u2019s request for a legal hold on the suspension, Walker suggested that some Founding Fathers, too, would be dismayed at a violation of free speech.\n\n\u201cMadison would recoil,\u201d he said.\n\nRead more:\n\nAD", "description": "The judge put a hold on the teenager\u2019s suspension over her bathroom note saying \u201cTHERE\u2019S A RAPIST IN OUR SCHOOL.\u201d", "authors": ["Hannah Knowles", "General Assignment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yiRwE9ya4o4a0JqwEv5-jj4BW4U=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QAVQECDIH5DUXMG5F2IYVJGDGA.PNG", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
