Here\u2019s an excerpt from Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks:\n\nI mean, if she gets elected president, then I would bet that we will have a legal challenge, and I would bet that we will win the legal challenge. And does that still suck for us? Yeah. I mean, I don\u2019t want to have a major lawsuit against our own government. I mean, that\u2019s not the position that you want to be in when you\u2019re, you know, I mean\u2026it\u2019s like, we care about our country and want to work with our government and do good things. But look, at the end of the day, if someone\u2019s going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight.\n\nThe Massachusetts Democrat and presidential hopeful for 2020 has been at the epicenter of calls to break up technology giants like Facebook Inc. FB, -1.27%, as well as Google-parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG, -1.14% GOOGL, -1.24% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.01%.\n\nWarren has pledged that if she\u2019s elected president, she would split up the big technology companies:\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s big tech companies have too much power \u2014 too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy. They\u2019ve bulldozed competition, used our private information for profit, and tilted the playing field against everyone else,\u201d she wrote in a March 8 blog post on Medium.\n\nOn Tuesday, she fired back at the reports about Zuckerberg via Twitter, saying:\n\n\u201cWhat would really \u2018suck\u2019 is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anti-competitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy.\u201d\n\nWhat would really \u201csuck\u201d is if we don\u2019t fix a corrupt system that lets giant companies like Facebook engage in illegal anticompetitive practices, stomp on consumer privacy rights, and repeatedly fumble their responsibility to protect our democracy. https://t.co/rI0v55KKAi \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 1, 2019\n\nShe said that she\u2019s not \u201cafraid to hold Big Tech companies\u201d accountable:\n\nI'm not afraid to hold Big Tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon accountable.

Late last month, Zuckerberg made a surprise visit to Washington, D.C. to meet with lawmakers, after failing to make an appearance at congressional hearings about the company\u2019s role in influencing the surprise outcome of the 2016 presidential election won by President Donald Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn Verge\u2019s audio, Zuckerberg makes the case that breaking up big technology companies won\u2019t achieve lawmakers desired antitrust ends and may actually exacerbate problems: \u201cIt\u2019s just that breaking up these companies, whether it\u2019s Facebook or Google or Amazon, is not actually going to solve the issues. And, you know, it doesn\u2019t make election interference less likely. It makes it more likely because now the companies can\u2019t coordinate and work together.\u201d\n\nShares of Facebook were down 1% on Tuesday but have gained 34% so far in 2019 and 8.4% over the past 12 months. That\u2019s better than the broad-market S&P 500 index SPX, -1.23% which has gained 17.8% so far this year and logged a roughly 1% gain over the past year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.28% has gained 14.3% thus far in 2019 but has been flat over the past year, according to FactSet data.\n\nAn email to Facebook wasn\u2019t immediately returned.", "description": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says he would \u201cgo to the mat\u201d and \u201cfight\u201d against Democratic presidential candidate Sen.
