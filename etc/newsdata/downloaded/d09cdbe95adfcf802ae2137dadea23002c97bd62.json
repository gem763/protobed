But what if we changed the framework of the debate in a way that lets us vault past the exhausted polarities? The narrative we\u2019ve grown used to on this subject is one of blame, casting humanity as a virus destroying an Earth which now needs saving (from us). But there is very different story we can tell, one that recognizes climate change not as a marker of shame but as a story of an astonishing success that has led humanity to a moment of great peril, yet also profound possibility.\n\nThis new narrative emerges from interdisciplinary studies connecting humanity\u2019s project of civilization with the Earth\u2019s own multi-billion-year project of life and evolution. The central point is that climate change is the dire but unintended result of our species\u2019 thriving. Humans are not a greedy plague on the Earth but simply the latest experiment in planetary-scale evolution. Any species that flourished to the extent we humans have would have to seek out energy sources on a massive scale \u2014 and in doing so would change the global ecosystem. It took centuries for the downsides of carbon-based fuels to become apparent. But now that we have figured that out, it\u2019s incumbent on us to change course, and do so quickly.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThat\u2019s not an anti-business argument. Nor is it even an indictment of humans\u2019 initially developing an economy around oil, before we knew about the implications. By stripping away the self-flagellating rhetoric and reorienting the story in this way \u2014 a longer timeline, a broader canvas \u2014 new alliances in the fight become possible.\n\nSome climate-change activists are already rethinking their rhetoric; they\u2019re debating, for instance, whether to use the phrase \u201cclimate catastrophe\u201d or \u201cclimate crisis,\u201d recognizing that harsh rhetoric may push people not to action but to desensitization or even despair. But the narrative revision I\u2019m talking about is far more sweeping.\n\nThe first implication of a planetary-scale view of the problem is that humans shouldn\u2019t be considered as a force set in opposition to nature. From the \u201cblue-green bacteria\u201d that created a breathable oxygen rich atmosphere on to dinosaurs, grasslands and large hairy mammals, our planet has been relentlessly inventing new versions of itself. Humans, and our globe-spanning civilization, simply represent the latest round of innovation. We are who\u2019s at-bat right now \u2014 and that\u2019s largely an accident of fate and evolution. When it comes to life changing the Earth, humans are not fundamentally different or special. This has happened before\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA second implication, the most contentious, is that climate change is not our fault. Don\u2019t get me wrong: Human activity absolutely has caused the rise in temperature that our scientists are hard at work documenting \u2014 and without doubt, those who continue to drive climate denial are deeply and profoundly worthy of blame. I mean, rather, that all human history is the attempt to harvest new forms of energy to power our cherished project of civilization. We triggered climate change by mistake when we tripped over fossil fuels as part of that long effort. It wasn\u2019t because we are evil or unworthy.\n\nFrom a planetary-science perspective, global-scale technological civilizations and climate change go together. Any society as successful as ours, emerging anywhere in the universe, is going to have a hard time not triggering climate change. That\u2019s just how planets work when you harvest buckets of energy from them. Viewed that way, changing a world\u2019s climate marks the end of your civilization\u2019s adolescence. At that point, you then face a very strict planetary driving test. Pass it \u2014 build a long-term sustainable version of your civilization \u2014 and you can go anywhere. Fail and you might die.\n\nSo, yes, we changed the atmosphere of entire planet. Not bad for a bunch of hairless monkeys. Now we must meet the existential challenge that success has created.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThinking about climate-change in the context of eons of evolution, and as a curse of success, makes the burden of guilt hovering over every individual daily action (paper towels or electric bathroom hand dryers?) seem beside the point. Once humans recognize that triggering climate change was an inevitable consequence of a civilizational project we began 10,000 years ago, it follows that combating climate change, too, must also be a collective process, requiring all the ingenuity our species can muster.\n\nAfter traveling the country for a year telling this story, speaking to people at venues as diverse as the Joe Rogan Show, the California Academy of Sciences and investor groups, I\u2019ve seen the power of this new story. By shifting from blame to possibility, people are freed to imagine climate change as a challenge full of risk and possibility, rather than just a death sentence from accrued guilt. Many people who don\u2019t consider themselves environmentalists get more engaged when the conversation turns to human success and capacity for innovation, I find. Skeptics don\u2019t suddenly \u201cconvert,\u201d but space for conversation opens up\n\nStressing human ingenuity in this context carries risks, for sure. Focusing on our technological prowess \u2014 on an evolutionary timeline as well as in the present \u2014 risks steering the conversation toward \u201csolutions\u201d like geoengineering, whose unintended consequences may well be even worse than the unintended climate change we drove with fossil fuels. The true game-changing point of the planetary perspective is to convince people that we are not above the biosphere \u2014 we\u2019re part of it. Our complex global project of civilization must be rewoven into the complex global network of life in ways that allow both to thrive, in new and as yet unimagined ways.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLeft vs. Right, Democrat vs. Republican, corporate capitalism vs. socialism. All these polarities of public life and public debate were built before the Earth began responding to our civilization-building efforts. Each in their own way carry the baggage of a 19th smokestack world whose imperatives don\u2019t align with the urgencies and possibilities of a world in which the climate is changing. The cliche is that history repeats itself, but humanity has simply never been here before.\n\nThat means we will need to invent something new. New technologies and new policies are one front in that fight, from local-scale projects protecting fresh water sources to investment strategies that ensure capital makes it quickly to technologies like large-scale energy storage (essential for the full switch to renewal power). But stories were humanity\u2019s first technology. For any of the new approaches to become fully deployed and fully effective, they will have to be grounded in a new way of understanding ourselves and the Earth. And if some people question whether a story is enough to move the world, one can ask: What else ever has?\n\nAD", "description": "Climate change is the unintended \u2014 but dire \u2014 result of our species\u2019 thriving.", "authors": ["Adam Frank", "Adam Frank Is A Professor Of Astrophysics At The University Of Rochester", "The Author Of", "Light Of The Stars", "Alien Worlds", "The Fate Of The Earth."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/eg-CIA9_znBmYPHl5OqYxtvTPg4=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NNGP4CHLKYI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
