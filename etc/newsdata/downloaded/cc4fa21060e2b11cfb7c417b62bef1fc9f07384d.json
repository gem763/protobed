Just the thing to wash down our Ghost Whoppers!\n\nIn honor of Halloween, Starbucks has announced the debut of its brand-new \u201cPhantom Frappuccino\u201d to menus at locations across Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\n\nSEE IT: FRENCH BULLDOG'S 'CHUCKY' HALLOWEEN COSTUME GOES VIRAL\n\nThe black-and-green Frappuccino, which is only available for a limited time, is made with coconut milk, \"mango essence\" and a \"ghoulish lime slime made with spirulina,\" according to a press release shared with Fox News. (Starbucks Spain's Instagram account claims there's also pineapple blended into the beverage.) Many of those ingredients, however, are masked by the addition of activated charcoal, which gives the Frappuccino its arguably unseemly hue.\n\nThe drink also comes with an optional coconut-based whipped topping \u2014 also made with activated charcoal \u2014 according to Insider.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\n\"Developed by our beverage innovation team based at the Starbucks EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) headquarters, our limited-edition Halloween concoction is spooky and stunning on the outside and fresh and fruity on the inside,\" the chain proudly boasts in its press release.\n\n\"The Phantom is vegan too!\" Starbucks adds.\n\nUnfortunately, Starbucks has yet to announce plans to bring the Phantom Frappuccino to the United States. Until that day comes, however, Starbucks patrons can still try annoying the chain's baristas with any number of secret off-the-menu or \"Unicorn\"-like Frappucino ideas.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Phantom Frappuccino will be available starting Oct. 26 at locations across Europe, the Middle East and Africa, although some markets \u2014 including Spain and Portugal \u2014 are currently advertising the drink's availability.", "description": "Yum?", "authors": ["Michael Bartiromo"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Phantom-Frappuccino_2019-1-1024x683.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
