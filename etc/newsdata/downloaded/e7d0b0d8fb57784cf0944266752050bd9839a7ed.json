Officials said the package appeared to be a bomb and smelled like ammonium.\n\nLIBERAL SEMINARY STUDENTS WORSHIP POTTED PLANTS AS 'THE BEINGS WHO SUSTAIN US'\n\nThe Rochester Police arrested Samuel Vanderwiel, who was arrested as a result of the bomb threat and charged with one felony count of terroristic threats with reckless disregard, and misdemeanors: one count of 5th-degree assault; one count of disorderly conduct; and one count of public nuisance, according to Olmsted County arrest records.\n\nAttendees in the Hill Theatre, as well as students attending night classes at the Rochester Community and Technical College, were immediately evacuated by security on campus, who responded to a \"chemical spill.\"\n\nPolice arrested Vanderwiel and cleared the building within an hour. No one was injured in the incident.\n\nOnce outside, the pro-lifers prayed and Maldonado finished his speech entitled \"Embracing Controversy.\"\n\nALABAMA JUDGE THROWS OUT TEEN\u2019S LAWSUIT AGAINST ABORTION CLINIC ON BEHALF OF ABORTED CHILD\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that a pro-choice student finds it appropriate to scare innocent children and families and try to intimidate them from peacefully praying and sidewalk counseling,\" Maldonado said. \"However, it\u2019s not surprising, when we see the climate on high school and college campuses, where speaking tour banners are burned, displays are vandalized, and administrators try to silence students.\u201d\n\nIt's not the first time pro-life students have faced threats on campus.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The Pro-Life Generation will not be silenced or intimidated,\u201d Kristan Hawkins, president of SFLA, said of the event. \u201cThis is not the kind of back-to-school story anyone hopes for, but no matter the opposition, Students for Life will bring our message of hope to campuses in all 50 states.\u201d", "description": "A pro-life event at a Minnesota community college was evacuated by a bomb threat midway through the speaker's remarks\u00a0Wednesday night, according to police.", "authors": ["Caleb Parke", "Caleb Parke Is An Associate Editor For Foxnews.Com.
