A great win for the future and speed of the internet. Will lead to many big things including 5G. Congratulations to the FCC and its Chairman, Ajit Pai!,' the president tweeted.\n\nHe touted his victory as he spent much of the weekend complaining about the impeachment inquiry into his presidency and knocking Republican Senator Mitt Romney for criticizing his conduct.\n\nDonald Trump touts court victory on net neutrality case\n\nThe appeals court ruling was a victory for Trump and his administration, where he has made deregulation across multiple sectors a priority.\n\nIn 2017, the Federal Communications Commission, headed by Trump appointee Ajit Pai, voted in 3-to-2 party line vote to throw out strict rules governing internet service providers that had barred from blocking or throttling traffic, or offering paid fast lanes - a reversal of an Obama administration policy.\n\nThose Obama-era rules forbid companies like Comcast and AT&T from blocking certain websites or charging more for faster service or certain content.\n\nA federal appeals court upheld the Trump administration's removal of those regulations but did rule the FCC overstepped its bounds when it said states could not make such regulations - leaving a door open for the 50 states to do just that.\n\nThe court also upheld the FCC's decision to no longer regulate high-speed internet delivery as if it were a utility, like phone service.\n\n'Regulation of broadband internet has been the subject of protracted litigation, with broadband providers subjected to and then released from common-carrier regulation over the previous decade,' the court wrote. 'We decline to yet again flick the on-off switch of common-carrier regulation under these circumstances.'\n\n\n\nThe decision means the more than 10-year-old debate over net neutrality will continue to drag on for months or more likely years.\n\nThe FCC's 2015 net neutrality rules had barred internet providers such as AT&T, Comcast and Verizon from blocking, slowing down or charging internet companies to favor some sites or apps over others.\n\nAfter the FCC repealed the rules, phone and cable companies were permitted to slow down or block services they don't like or happen to compete with. Companies could also charge rivals higher fees and make them pay for higher transmission speeds. All companies had to do was disclose such practices.\n\nTech companies and 22 states challenged the FCC repeal in court. They included Mozilla, developer of the Firefox web browser, and Vimeo, a video-sharing site. Aligned with the government were big internet providers including AT&T, Verizon and Comcast.\n\n'Today's decision is a victory for consumers, broadband deployment, and the free and open internet,' Pai said in a statement. He maintained that speeds for consumers have increased by 40 per cent since the agency's 2017 repeal 'and millions more Americans have gained access to the internet.'\n\nFCC Chairman Ajit Pai, a Trump appointee, praised the ruling\n\nThe federal court directed the FCC to rework its order to include the impact of its repeal on public safety, utility pole access and Lifeline, a program that provides internet access to low-income consumers.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, net neutrality became one of President Trump's first targets as part of broader government deregulation.\n\nPai, the more industry-friendly FCC chairman he appointed, made rolling back net neutrality a top priority. He repealed the rules in 2017, saying they had undermined investment in broadband networks.", "description": "Donald Trump bragged about a net neutrality case his administration won last week that upheld the\u00a0government's repeal of strict regulations for the companies that provide internet access.", "authors": ["Emily Goodin", "U.S. Political Reporter For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/14/19397092-0-image-a-9_1570454934942.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
