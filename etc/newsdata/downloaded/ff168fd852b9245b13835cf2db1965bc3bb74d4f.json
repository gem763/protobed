The new Irish Velvet family is sure to be a big hit and the Terry\u2019s Chocolate Orange Muffin will be making thousands of Chocoholics wishes come true. We hope families and friends are inspired to come together and enjoy a Christmas treat in-store this season.\u201d", "description": "Costa coffee is now selling a Terry's chocolate orange muffin as it unveils new 2019 Christmas menu", "authors": ["Molly Holt"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20586191.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1111_PR_Terrys-Chocolate-Orange-Muffin.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
