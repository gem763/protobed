Slack hit the public market through a direct listing on June 20, and the reference price was set at $26 per share. The online messaging company has been focused on expanding its enterprise business, and thus, analysts are expecting Slack\u2019s sales growth to decelerate at least in the near term. So far, most of Slack\u2019s customer base is smaller companies, and only about 1% of its customers have more than $100,000 in annual revenue.\n\nShares of Slack have been holding up relatively well despite the recent market volatility. Since its direct listing, the stock is up 10%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.3% in the same time period.\n\nSlack is expected to report an adjusted earnings loss of 19 cents per share on $141.55 million in revenue. The options market is implying a 13.87% move in either direction following the report.\n\nOther notable earnings announcements scheduled for Wednesday include American Eagle Outfitters (AEO) ahead of the market open, and MongoDB (MDB) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW) after the market close.\n\n\u2014\n\nHeidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
