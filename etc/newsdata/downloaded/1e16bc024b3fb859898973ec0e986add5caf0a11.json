But after back-to-back losing seasons and anemic offensive production to start the 2019 season, Giants head coach Pat Shurmur announced Tuesday that Jones, a first-round draft pick in March, would start Week 3 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\n\u201cI hope Eli\u2019s OK with it, because he\u2019s such a good dude. I hope he\u2019s OK with it. I\u2019m sure he isn\u2019t. If they came to me in Pittsburgh after two weeks and they said \u2018Terry, we\u2019re going to have to go with so-and-so, I\u2019d shake their hands, I\u2019d pack my bags and I\u2019d go home, because that would be a hard pill to swallow after all of that,\u201d Bradshaw said. \u201cI understand why they did it, but it is a hard pill to swallow for Eli.\u201d\n\nBradshaw, who led the Pittsburgh Steelers to four Super Bowl wins in the 1970s and works as a FOX NFL Sunday analyst, said a midseason quarterback switch, after eight games or so, would have allowed the Giants to test Jones\u2019 ability to be a new franchise cornerstone without insulting Manning. By pulling Manning just two games into a new season, he argues, the Giants were dismissive of Manning\u2019s status as a team legend.\n\n\u201cEli and I spoke this morning,\u201d Shurmur said Tuesday. \u201cI told him that we are making a change and going with Daniel as the starter. I also talked to Daniel. Eli was obviously disappointed, as you would expect, but he said he would be what he has always been, a good teammate, and continue to prepare to help this team win games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJones became Manning\u2019s de facto heir apparent when the Giants drafted him sixth overall and impressed during the preseason, completing 29 of 34 pass attempts for 416 yards and two touchdowns during extended play.\n\nThe timing of the switch came as a surprise to some, given the Giants\u2019 decision to enter the 2019 season with Manning under center rather than release him to sign with another franchise. The Giants have scored just 31 points through the first two games.\n\n\u201cI feel for him, I truly do. That\u2019s a horrible position to be in after so many great years as a Giant,\u201d Bradshaw added.\n\nManning led an offense virtually devoid of top-tier playmakers, aside from running back Saquon Barkley and emerging tight end Evan Engram. At age 38, Manning might benefit from a fresh start with a well-stocked NFL contender looking for a quarterback to lead a playoff run, according to Bradshaw. But any team change would likely have to wait until the offseason, unless the Giants opt to trade Manning and he agreed to waive a no-trade clause in his contract.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\u201cIf [the Patriots] don\u2019t protect Tom Brady, if they don\u2019t continue to put people around him that excel, he doesn\u2019t do what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Bradshaw said. \u201cThey protect him, and as you get older as a quarterback, your skills only get better. Your brain gets better, you see things quicker. \u2026 If you send [Manning] to a good football team, I believe he would excel.
