Since then, we have seen powerful competitors from Jabra, Jaybird, RHA, and more.\n\nThe all-new Google Pixel Buds will launch in early 2020 for $179. The Pixel Buds no longer have a cable connecting them and are designed to fit within each ear. There is a spatial vent in each bud to let through environmental sounds so you can use them while remaining safe as you use them.\n\nThe new Pixel Buds will, of course, have hands-free Google Assistant support while also incorporating long-range Bluetooth technology. Google states you will be able to use the Pixel Buds inside from three rooms away from the audio source or up to a full football field away while outside.\n\nNew Pixel Buds have been designed with you in mind: truly wireless, rich sound, clear calls, and an amazingly comfortable and stable fit. #madebygoogle #pixelbuds pic.twitter.com/veXoqq22W3 \u2014 Made by Google (@madebygoogle) October 15, 2019\n\nFive hours of battery life are possible with each Pixel Bud -- with the wireless charging case providing another 24 hours of battery life. While Google Assistant and adaptive sound are a focus of the Pixel Buds, there are also beam-forming microphones for high call quality and responsiveness to your voice.\n\nMore details will be released as we get closer to the spring 2020 availability. I am looking forward to seeing if there is any level of dust/water resistance to these Pixel Buds while exercising and whether or not you can use a single Pixel Bud independently, extending the effective battery life to twice that of using two buds at once.", "description": "While Apple's AirPods kickstarted the fully wireless earbud market, others have jumped in to offer more for less.
