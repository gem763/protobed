Or have they just forgotten how to answer simple questions such as \u201cHow will you pay for that?\u201d\n\nIn the case of \u201cMedicare-for-all,\u201d both Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., have dodged the latter question.\n\nMost of the less-overtly socialist candidates have tried to avoid being pinned down as supporting \u201cMedicare-for-all,\u201d but what nearly all of them have admitted is that they don\u2019t trust Americans to choose their own health care. Mayor Pete Buttigieg has called Sanders out for this presumption during the debates, but even he admits that his \u201cpublic option\u201d proposal would create \u201ca natural glide-path to \u2018Medicare-for-all\u2019.\u201d\n\nBecause, as we all know, Americans love for some aloof senator or bureaucrat 1,000 miles away to make their health care choices for them.\n\nMake no mistake \u2013 introducing a government-created insurance plan to the private marketplace is just \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d on an installment plan, and nearly every 2020 Democratic candidate supports a version of it. Because, as we all know, Americans love for some aloof senator or bureaucrat 1,000 miles away to make their health care choices for them.\n\nRising costs\n\nAmericans do struggle every day with how to pay for health care. That\u2019s why Republicans too need to find the political courage to address the rising costs of health care. They need to make the case that free markets are the answer to lowering the costs of medical bills, insurance premiums and prescription drugs \u2013 not the pen of some unelected bureaucrat in Washington, D.C.\n\nEven entrepreneur Andrew Yang, whom the Democratic establishment loathes, made the accurate observation that the way the health care system operates has fundamentally changed in the modern economy. Americans no longer work the same job throughout their careers, which means that health plan mobility is a necessity. Sanders\u2019s \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d is the socialist, blanket fix for this. But any student of basic economics knows that it would leave Americans with worse care and higher taxes.\n\nHealth savings accounts are the start of the solution. Republicans and the Trump administration have fought to expand them because they emphasize the individual \u2013 the only one who can decide what to save and how. Consumer choice, competition and innovation are the answer for affordable health care, not monolithic, one-size-fits-all federal programs. But based on the rhetoric we\u2019ve heard in this primary thus far, Democrats still fail to understand this.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nWhether it\u2019s doubling down on the failure that was ObamaCare, embracing the siren call of \u201cMedicare-for-all,\u201d or any of the other big government proposals in between, these 2020 Democratic candidates appear fundamentally opposed to letting Americans make the choice of what health care plan they want for themselves.\n\nAdam Brandon is president and CEO of FreedomWorks.", "description": "The 2020 Democratic candidates appear fundamentally opposed to letting Americans make the choice of what health care plan they want for themselves.", "authors": ["Adam Brandon"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/iStock-healthcare.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
