The quantum processor collected one million samples of a quantum circuit in approximately 200 seconds, which would have taken a state-of-the-art supercomputer an estimated 10,000 years.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nIndustry experts and competitors have defined that term differently. International Business Machines Corp., for example, argues that the term refers to the threshold where quantum computers can perform calculations that classical computers can\u2019t do at all.\n\nIBM, which is working to commercialize its own quantum computer, saw a version of the Nature paper prior to publication and published a blog post earlier this week disagreeing with the science behind Google\u2019s claim. The calculation could have been solved with a classical machine in 2\u00bd days instead of 10,000 years, IBM said.\n\nExperts say quantum computing can be orders of magnitude more powerful than traditional computers.\n\nBy harnessing the properties of quantum physics, quantum computers have the potential to sort through a vast number of possibilities in nearly real time and come up with a probable solution. While traditional computers store information as either 0s or 1s, quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which represent and store information as both zeros and ones simultaneously.\n\nGoogle\u2019s quantum computer is a 54-qubit processor named Sycamore.\n\nExperts say quantum computing can be applied across industries, including pharmaceuticals, finance and transportation. Companies including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Volkswagen AG have been experimenting with early versions of quantum computers.\n\nGoogle's Sycamore processor.

One is that qubits can\u2019t yet maintain their quantum mechanical state for more than a fraction of a second, in part because they are delicate and easily disrupted by changes in temperature, noise or frequency.\n\nAnother challenge is that current quantum-computing systems don\u2019t have fault tolerance like traditional computers, meaning if the delicate qubits are disturbed they can\u2019t resume or continue running the program they were handling.\n\nWrite to Sara Castellanos at sara.castellanos@wsj.com", "description": "Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google said its quantum computer has performed a calculation in about 3 minutes compared with the 10,000 years it would have taken the world\u2019s fastest supercomputer to complete the task.", "authors": ["Sara Castellanos", "Sara.Castellanos Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-119808/social", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
