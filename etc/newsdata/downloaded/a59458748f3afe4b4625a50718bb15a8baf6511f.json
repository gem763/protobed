There are currently over 200 black undergraduates studying at the university, which is the highest in the institution's 800 year history.\n\nOver a quarter (26.8 per cent) of all undergraduates at Cambridge are now from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds.\n\nProfessor Graham Virgo, Cambridge\u2019s senior pro-vice-Chancellor for education, said that the rise was partly down to a new scholarship for black students which was launched by the grime artist Stormzy last year.\n\n\u201cA number of factors are thought to be behind the increase in black students applying and being admitted,\u201d he Prof Virgo said.\n\n\u201cOne is likely to be the \u201cStormzy effect\u201d. In August 2018, the award-winning British grime artist announced he would fund tuition fees and living costs for two students each year for the duration of their study at Cambridge. \u201cSince then the University has seen an increase in the number of black students engage in its outreach activities and enquire about its courses.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Stormzy, the rapper, launched a scholarship to Cambridge University which pays for tuition fees and living costs for two young black students. Earlier this year he announced that he will cover the costs of another two students from black, Asian or minority ethnic backgrounds.", "description": "The number of black students at Cambridge has risen by 50 per cent in a year, with a university chief citing the \u201cStormzy effect\u201d.", "authors": ["Camilla Turner", "Education Editor", "Fraser Nelson", "Penny Mordaunt", "Tom Harris"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/22/TELEMMGLPICT000146521242-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
