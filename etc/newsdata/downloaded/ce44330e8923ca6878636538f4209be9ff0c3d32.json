People want more choice, not less.", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Medicare for All is one of the most hotly debated topics in the 2020 election. But what is it? And how will it work? We explain. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nMedicare for All is a low priority even among Democrats. The best health plans from 2020 candidates keep private insurance and add public options.\n\nAmong the many patients of mine who suffer from chronic illness, nearly all tell me they value choice above all else in their health care decisions. Some spend much of their day crippled by weakness, the side effects of medications and the resulting depression that can so easily take root.\n\nThe last thing they want is to compromise on what they hope to retain some control over: choice of provider, the ability to seek a second opinion or to get an appointment within a desired time frame. The sickest crave simplicity, and while nothing is perfect in American life, the private health insurance industry gives people choices they otherwise would not have.\n\nIt gave the mother of two young children whom I recently cared for, dying from a serious bacterial infection, a chance at survival. She had initially gone to a local community hospital in rural Washington state that did not have many resources to care for complex medical cases.\n\nInsurance choice kept my patient alive\n\nDespite her worsening pneumonia, she had the presence of mind to insist on a transfer to a better equipped hospital in Seattle, a place that knew her and could give her the higher level of care she needed. A helicopter life-flighted her to my care team within a few hours of her request for transfer, and we started her on Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation, a powerful and rare medical procedure meant to bring patients back from the precipice of death.\n\nShe is back home now, healthy, with her two sons, and credits the flexibility of her privately sponsored health insurance plan as the lifeline she so desperately needed to save her life.\n\nA risky promise for candidates to make: Like your doctor or health plan? You can keep it.\n\nWith an estimated 12 million Americans misdiagnosed every year, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised that people want choice. One provider\u2019s recommendation to proceed with a minor surgery may be challenged by the wisdom of another, and no surgery is ever entirely safe.\n\nDoctor and patient (Photo: Luis Alvarez/ Getty Images)\n\nSome of my own colleagues opt for observation over writing prescriptions, since no medication is without adverse effects. Second and third opinions matter when our medical system is so prone to imperfection. Choice acts as a natural deterrent to bad things happening.\n\nIt is why private health insurance remains a timeless fixture among all of our peer countries to some extent, even those like Canada that are hailed as bastions of government-run coverage for all. Australia actually encourages its citizens to bolster a government-sponsored public plan with private insurance that would provide, in effect, greater choice (faster appointments, wider provider networks). It\u2019s no surprise that nearly half of the country has purchased such complementary coverage.\n\n'Medicare for All' is low priority\n\nIt\u2019s also no surprise that there\u2019s no majority voice clamoring to take down the private health insurance industry here in America. On the contrary, most people like their health insurance as is. And poll after poll confirms that \"Medicare for All\" rates as one of the lowest priorities among the American electorate writ large, and Democrats more specifically. In other words, private health insurance is popular, and for a reason: People like choice, just as they do in Australia and Britain.\n\nDemocratic candidates like former Vice President Joe Biden recognize this and have advocated for continuity if people are happy with their existing insurance. There is no shame in this approach; it\u2019s smart, and the vast majority of America wants it this way.\n\nEven so, the former vice president has still put forth the most progressive health care platform for a major party front-runner in our nation\u2019s history, proposing a public option for Medicare buy-in at any age and a generous nationwide strategy to expand the Medicaid safety net premium-free.\n\n'Medicare for All' is a distant dream: Here's how to start fixing health care right now.\n\nThe Biden platform on health care, similar to plans put forward by South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, does not cede the moral high ground on health. Rather, it seizes it, by demonstrating an unwavering understanding of how choice and freedom remain powerful and enduring motivators for the American health care consumer.\n\nDr. Vin Gupta is a major in the U.S. Air Force Medical Corps and assistant professor of pulmonary & critical care medicine at the University of Washington. He has discussed advising the Biden campaign on health care but currently has no formal relationship with any candidate.
