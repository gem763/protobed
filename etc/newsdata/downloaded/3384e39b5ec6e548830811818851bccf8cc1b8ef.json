Now, however, several brands are developing clothes with technology designed for menopausal women.\n\nAn anti-flush nightdress is the bestselling item for clothing brand Become, which was launched in 2016 and has this year seen sales rise by 213%. Another brand, Cucumber Clothing, sells garments made using \u201cvolcanic mineral to help keep your body at the ideal core temperature\u201d. Its range includes nightdresses, track pants and pyjamas. Fifty One Apparel, launched last year with the slogan \u201ccool clothes for hot women\u201d, says its technology \u201censures heat is taken away from the body and stored and released back when the body begins to cool down\u201d.\n\nThe Fifty One Apparel owner Louise Nicholson said: \u201cI had a textile agency and was selling fabrics to the big retailers. I was listening to a guy on the radio talk about what his wife was going through and I thought, \u2018I\u2019ve got a fabric in my car that could really help this woman\u2019.\u201d\n\nHer garments use \u201cCertified Space Technology\u201d material, originally developed by Nasa, that regulates temperature using \u201ca method of microencapsulation where the phase-change materials are enclosed in a polymer shell\u201d. And they are not aimed just at those experiencing night sweats. \u201cEverything we\u2019ve designed could be worn in bed or to the office. It\u2019s multi-functional,\u201d said Nicholson.\n\nFor its part, Become says its tops, leggings and nightdresses are made with a flat thread and knitted on a cross-section to produce a bigger surface area, allowing warmth to be transferred away more efficiently. While Become\u2019s clothes also offer wicking capabilities \u2013 like some sportswear \u2013 it argues that such products are not specifically designed to manage hot flush perspiration, where heat tends to be generated very quickly.\n\nIt\u2019s not just fashion that is embracing the menopause market; the beauty industry is also getting in on the act. Pause is a US skincare brand offering products such as a \u201cHot Flash Cooling Mist\u201d, which also encourages collagen production, while a fellow US company, Pepper & Wits, offers oestrogen-free lotions, creams and dietary supplements.\n\n\u201cWomen experiencing menopausal symptoms have until recently been underserved as far as products and services to help them manage their symptoms are concerned,\u201d said Joanna Brewis, professor of people and organisations at the Open University and co-author of a 2017 government report on the effects of menopause on women\u2019s economic participation. \u201cWomen in this age group can feel overlooked by a clothing and beauty market that predominantly targets younger women.\u201d\n\nShe said the majority of women she had spoken to reported feeling more confident in managing hot flushes when wearing specially designed clothing. Some, however, were sceptical about the claims, and alleged that the products were just rebranded versions of existing ones. Some brands, including Fifty One Apparel, have also been criticised for their use of relatively young and perimenopausal women as models and ambassadors.\n\n\u201cBrands need to be very careful about their messaging,\u201d said Brewis. \u201cEvery woman\u2019s trajectory is unique, so any stereotyping is problematic. The same is true of images suggesting menopause is something that happens to older women. And then there are the people who don\u2019t identify as women, because they are transgender or gender non-conforming, but experience menopause nonetheless.\u201d", "description": "Brands see fast growth in hi-tech clothing and skincare products that claim to help with hot flushes", "authors": ["Leah Harper"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a3105f545cc56757d9e7dc196e7968b8f00bfe5/0_44_650_390/master/650.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8f75182c4c86a4a8f63386d88381d525", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
