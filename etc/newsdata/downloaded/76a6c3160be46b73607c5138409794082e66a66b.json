Elder\u2019s lawyers say he acted in self defense and that the police did not properly identify themselves.\n\nDetails from the police officer\u2019s autopsy obtained by The Daily Beast show that some of the 11 stab wounds that led to Rega\u2019s death were so deep the handle of Elder\u2019s knife left bruises on the officer\u2019s skin.\n\nNone of the stab wounds occurred on the front of the officer\u2019s body, according to the report, but both of Rega\u2019s lungs were punctured in addition to other vital organs. The autopsy says the stabbing was carried out with \u201cextreme violence.\u201d\n\nBefore the murder police claim the Americans allegedly approached an interloper in an attempt to buy drugs in central Rome on the evening of July 26. But when they discovered that what they purchased from a drug dealer turned out to be crushed aspirin, they returned to the interloper to get their money back.\n\nWhen that was not possible they stole the interloper\u2019s backpack which had a cellphone in it. When the man called his cellphone, the Americans made a plan to meet him to return the bag in exchange for a gram of cocaine and their money back. But Rega and his partner met the Americans instead. It is unclear if the interloper or the drug seller were actually informants or why police were so willing to help retrieve the bag.\n\nNew details also show that neither Rega or his partner Andrea Varriale had their weapons, badges or handcuffs when they met the Americans. Varriale is currently under investigation for responding to a call without his service weapon. It\u2019s against the law in Italy for an active police officer not to be armed.\n\nThe Daily Beast has also obtained a vital police document that chronicles the cellphone messages by Elder and Natale before and after the murder. The document contains photos from both young men\u2019s phones that show them holding guns, knives and drugs.\n\nNatale has claimed that he knew nothing about Elder\u2019s knife or the stabbing, but the police report shows surveillance photos of the two young men returning to the hotel together after the murder. It also alleges that Natale\u2019s fingerprints were found alongside Elder\u2019s on the ceiling panel where the murder weapon was found inside the hotel room the young men shared.\n\nIn the report authorities outline a series of text messages Natale allegedly sent to a friend identified as \u201cVallby\u201d last spring in which he sends Amazon links of knives he likes. The reports shows he also had photos of himself holding various guns and knives.\n\nIn another exchange, Natale\u2019s mother accuses him of selling drugs, which he denies. \u201cI'm not talking about your second time using mushrooms,\u201d Natale\u2019 mother writes to her son. \u201cI'm talking about the fact that it is bullshit that you are not still selling drugs since you do not have a job and you continue to buy stuff. Expensive stuff. You lie to me constantly.\u201d\n\nRecords from Elder\u2019s phone show pictures of hundred dollar bills, some rolled next to what appears to be cocaine on a table, and photos of marijuana with the title \u201cBuffalo Breathe\u201d superimposed on them.\n\nIn one photo from his cellphone he is holding three blue tablets with the words \u201cFuck Xanax boy\u201d written in meme form. Elder\u2019s phone also has a number of photos of the murder weapon used to kill Rega. One with the words \u201cI kill you\u201d superimposed on top. Some photos are apparent selfies of Elder with a pistol pointed at his temple.\n\nElder\u2019s lawyer has withdrawn a petition that his client be released from prison during the investigation. Natale, who has not been implicated directly in the stabbing but was sharing a hotel room with Elder where the weapon was hidden in a ceiling tile, is expected in court Monday to petition a judge that he be released during the investigation.", "description": "The autopsy report shows the 7-inch knife used to kill the Italian police officer went in so deep it left bruises from the handle on cop\u2019s skin.", "authors": ["Barbie Latza Nadeau"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2278,w_4051,x_0,y_194/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568464022/RTX71IY5_zed8bh", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
