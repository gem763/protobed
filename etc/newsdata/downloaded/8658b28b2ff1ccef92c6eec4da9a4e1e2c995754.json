We know how it is in the western German cities,\u201d Sebastian Wippel, the local AfD leader who narrowly lost a race to become G\u00f6rlitz\u2019s mayor this summer, told me, referring to places with larger immigrant populations. \u201cI don\u2019t need to have that here to know that I don\u2019t want it. I don\u2019t need to experience it here, and we don\u2019t want to experience it here.\u201d (Indeed, he has made his views on the city\u2019s immigrant population clear: At an event celebrating the end of Ramadan in Wilhelmsplatz last year, Wippel handed out postcards that said \u201cSyria Misses You.\u201d)\n\nRead: Germany\u2019s future is being decided on the left, not the far right.\n\nIs Wilhelmsplatz merely a municipal disagreement that\u2019s taken on a life of its own, or does it showcase, as Wippel suggests, the unsettling, out-of-control effects of immigration? How G\u00f6rlitzers answer this question is an immediate indication of their political persuasion, at a time when many here feel split into two camps that no longer understand or listen to each other.\n\nThe back-and-forth about Wilhelmsplatz \u201cis very symptomatic for the lack of discourse in this society,\u201d said Franziska Schubert, a local politician for the Greens who came in third in the June mayoral race, won by Angela Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats. G\u00f6rlitz\u2019s city center, Schubert said, is beautiful and calm, \u201clike the backdrop for a movie,\u201d but G\u00f6rlitzers ultimately need to decide what kind of city they want to live in: \u201cDo you want life, or do you want to be in a backdrop for a movie \u2026 where everything is dead and empty?\u201d\n\nWalking through G\u00f6rlitz\u2019s historic old town indeed feels, as Schubert says, like stumbling onto the movie set of a picture-perfect German city\u2014which, as a popular filming location for Hollywood movies, it quite often is. The candy-colored, perfectly preserved buildings in the old town span centuries: Napoleon stayed in an orange-and-white baroque building on one side of the Upper Market square, along what used to be the path of one of Europe\u2019s longest trading roads; down the street is the now-empty department store that served as the hotel lobby in Wes Anderson\u2019s 2014 film The Grand Budapest Hotel.\n\nBlocks away from the old town, crumbling, empty buildings in various states of disrepair tell a different story\u2014and hint at the social and economic problems plaguing the city and others like it. After the Berlin Wall fell, many residents left to find better jobs and opportunities in the West; G\u00f6rlitz\u2019s population shrank significantly and still hasn\u2019t recovered. While the state government focuses resources primarily on Saxony\u2019s bigger cities, places like G\u00f6rlitz suffer: It faces shortages of skilled workers, teachers, and caretakers for its elderly, and the local infrastructure is lacking.", "description": "A municipal disagreement illustrates Germany\u2019s polarized debate about open societies, tolerance, and integration.", "authors": ["Emily Schultheis"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/09/RTS2OIDL/facebook.jpg?1567408129"}
