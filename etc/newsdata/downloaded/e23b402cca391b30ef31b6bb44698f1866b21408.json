Coons on Trump, Biden: \u2018Not a Fair Comparison\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "During a Monday interview with MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe,\u201d Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) discussed his favorite 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden.\n\nHost Joe Scarborough asked Coons if the former vice president\u2019s son, Hunter, should have been involved with Ukraine despite having no experience while Joe Biden was working to clean the country up.\n\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s be clear. Everyone who has looked at the facts of these allegations has concluded that Joe Biden did nothing wrong,\u201d Coons advised.\n\nCoons then said there is no \u201ccomparison\u201d between the allegations of Biden\u2019s wrongdoing with Ukraine and President Donald Trump allegedly asking Ukraine\u2019s president for dirt on Biden in a quid pro quo.\n\n\u201cHunter has spoken directly to this recently in a national television interview where I thought he was remarkably forthcoming and has expressed regret about the ways in which this has become a distraction in his father\u2019s campaign for president of the United States. I think to make a comparison between the two, between Trump and Biden and the way they\u2019ve conducted themselves, it\u2019s not a fair comparison,\u201d he added.\n\nBoth Scarborough and co-host Mika Brzezinski also agreed with Coons, saying there was \u201cno comparison.\u201d\n\nFollow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent", "description": "During a Monday interview with MSNBC's \"Morning Joe,\" Sen.
