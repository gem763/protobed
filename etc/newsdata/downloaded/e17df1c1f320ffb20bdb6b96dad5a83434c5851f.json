Shortly afterwards the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) renewed Thomas Cook\u2019s Air Travel Organiser\u2019s Licence (Atol) but insisted on special measures \u2013 including regular scrutiny of booking trends.\n\nIn late November, the board discussed the possibility of selling the airline business or the tour operator business, and suspended dividends to shareholders. Shortly after, Thomas Cook began an \u201cinvestor roadshow\u201d with analysts and investors.\n\n\u201cFeedback from investors was that the Company had the right strategy in place,\u201d the timeline says.\n\nUncertainty over Brexit is blamed for a slow start to the normal peak booking season early in 2019.\n\nBy February the airline was put up for sale, and on 1 March 2019 Thomas Cook started talks with the Chinese conglomerate, Fosun, about buying the tour operator business that provided package holidays \u2013 the main business of the travel firm.\n\nOn 15 May 2019, the audit committee agreed to write down the goodwill that had been retained on the balance sheet since the merger with MyTravel in 2007 by \u00a31.1 billion.\n\n\u201cEven though the goodwill impairment had no impact on the cash position of the business,\u201d the timeline notes, \u201cit had an impact on the confidence in the business of consumers, suppliers and bidders for the airline business.\u201d\n\nOn 17 May 2019, Citibank published a report on Thomas Cook with a \u201csell\u201d recommendation and a price target of zero \u2013 rating the firm as worthless.\n\nThe following day the Financial Times published a front-page article under the headline \u201cThomas Cook is on the brink of collapse\u201d.\n\nBy June 2019, the CAA was insisting on weekly calls with Thomas Cook. On 10 July, Thomas Cook concluded that none of the bids received for the various parts of the group was likely \u201cto generate sufficient value to address debt and liquidity issues and \u2026 result in a sustainable residual business\u201d.\n\nWork began on a complex financial rescue plan involving Fosun, its leading shareholder, and lenders. But ominously, Thomas Cook also started talking to the CAA about \u201ccontingency planning in case a repatriation exercise became necessary\".\n\nOn 12 August 2019 the firm said that its long-term future was assured. The rescue plan included \u00a3750m in fresh funding designed to see the travel firm through what is expected to be a tough winter, and to \u201cprovide the financial flexibility to invest in the business for the future\u201d.\n\nThe chief executive, Peter Fankhauser, told The Independent: \u201cFor our customers, for our employees, for our suppliers, this is really good news, because it\u2019s a plan which is securing, going forward, the future of the business.\u201d\n\nBut four weeks later, three of the core lending banks said they believed that an additional \u00a3200 million of funding would be needed.\n\nOn 15 September 2019, a newspaper article said that the CAA\u2019s contingency planning had begun. A day later, a routine submission under the US Bankruptcy Code was misinterpreted as a filing for bankruptcy protection.\n\nThomas Cook started talks with the UK government about the possibility of \u201cfunding support on commercial terms\u201d.\n\nSky News said on 19 September that Thomas Cook was \u201cscrambling to stitch together a last-ditch fire-sale in a bid to avert collapse\u201d and had \u201ca \u00a3200m\u200b black hole in its finances\u201d.\n\nOn hearing this report, crucial suppliers began to demand prepayment from Thomas Cook, including for aircraft fuel.\n\nOver what turned out to be the last weekend in the company\u2019s history, the adverse publicity \u201cresulted in an overwhelming number of calls to the group\u2019s call centres, which included requests to cancel holidays\u201d.\n\nBy 5pm on Sunday 22 September, \u201cthe company was informed that Fosun and the banks had expressed concerns about the impact of recent media coverage on the company\u2019s business and that they had therefore imposed new requirements as conditions to their support\".\n\nThe key condition was that Thomas Cook gained the support of the government. A few minutes later, Peter Fankhauser was told that the government would not provide support.\n\nThe company continued to sell holidays up to midnight.\n\nAt 1.47am on Monday 23 September, winding-up petitions for Thomas Cook and 25 subsidiaries were granted.\n\nThe judge noted that \u201cthe directors of the companies have done their very best to see if some form of arrangement other than liquidation can be pursued\u201d.\n\nThe media were informed at 2am, just before the first Thomas Cook passengers were due to start checking in at Manchester airport for their flights to the sun.", "description": "The slow-motion demise of the world\u2019s most iconic travel brand has been set out in chilling detail in a newly published timeline.
