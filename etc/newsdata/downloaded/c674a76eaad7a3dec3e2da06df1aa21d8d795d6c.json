Its S-1 filing revealed details behind its wide losses, and that mounted pressure on Neumann, who already was in the spotlight because of his financial entanglements with and behavior while running the fast-growing company.\n\nOn Tuesday, WeWork said Neumann would step down as CEO and lose a big chunk of his voting power, though he will stay on as non-executive chairman.\n\nIn the statement announcing the move, Neumann said intense public scrutiny had become a distraction in running the company. Current WeWork execs Artie Minson and Sebastian Gunninghamwill head the company as co-CEOs.\n\nNoto is no stranger to the public markets and leadership turnover. A long-time banker at Goldman Sachs, he served as head of its global technology, media, and telecom investment banking group and helped the bank win the role of lead underwriter in Twitter's hotly-anticipated IPO.\n\nHe eventually left the bank in 2014 to serve as the social media company's chief financial officer. In 2018, he was named CEO of SoFi after cofounder Mike Cagney stepped down from the role amid allegations of sexual harassment.\n\nNoto said boards are now being forced to consider that the person that led the company to major success early on might also not be capable of bringing them to the public markets.\n\n\"I think the boards are just being put to task for the first time in, quite frankly, a couple of decades,\" Noto said. \"I think it's a gut check for the industry and it will be a theme that every board has to start to think about more proactively so you don't get to this flashpoint.\"\n\nSee more: JPMorgan's Jamie Dimon met with WeWork's Adam Neumann this weekend to hash out how to get its botched IPO back on track\n\nIt's worth noting WeWork investor SoftBank led a $1 billion Series E round for SoFi in September 2015.\n\nNoto added that those eyeing the public markets also need to be willing to accept how the public market will value them, even if it's lower than what it achieved privately.\n\nHe pointed to Jack Dorsey's decision to bring Square public. In 2014, Square raised $150 million in its Series E at a $6 billion valuation. Just over a year later, Square went public at a valuation of just $2.9 billion.\n\nCurrently, Square's market cap stands at roughly $25 billion.\n\n\"I thought Jack was prescient in that he was willing to accept the value from the public markets that was meaningfully below the value that the company got as a private company, with the view that over the longterm it won't matter, and he was 100% right,\" Noto said.\n\n\"But the difference between going public and not going public could have really impaled the company. So he prioritized going public over getting the right value.\"", "description": "The former Goldman banker said boards now have more of a responsibility to understand the leadership required at different stages of a company.", "authors": ["Dan Defrancesco"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d8bc34c2e22af42390bccc7-2560-1280.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
