We just can\u2019t imagine our lives without her.\n\n\u2018The people responsible for Joanne\u2019s death have left us with our own life sentence and my daughters now have to grow up without their mum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018While we know nothing will ever bring her back, we needed these answers and hope that lessons are learned from this incident.\n\n\u2018Motorists need to remember that the safety of themselves, other drivers and pedestrians should always be a key concern when they are on the road.\n\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t wish what we are going through on any other family, and it is vital that the issues seen in this crash are never repeated in future.\u2019\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
