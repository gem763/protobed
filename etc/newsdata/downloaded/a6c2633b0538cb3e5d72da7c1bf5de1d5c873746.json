Wrestling Picture. Whadaya Need \u2013 A Road Map?", "language": "en", "text": "\u201cFoxcatcher,\u201d the new film directed by Bennett Miller, is based on a true story. David and Mark Schultz really were gold-medal-winning American wrestlers at the 1984 Olympics. John du Pont really was the incredibly wealthy scion of the du Pont fortune, and he really did lure the Schultz brothers and other young wrestlers to his estate, Foxcatcher, to train for the 1988 Olympics. And (spoilers \u2013 lots of spoilers \u2013 stop reading if you hate spoilers) John DuPont really did end up murdering David.\n\nBut why did he end up killing him? What did the crime mean? What\u2019s the story here, as opposed to what\u2019s merely true?\n\nThe film, based on Mark\u2019s book about his experiences, appears to make Mark the protagonist \u2013 it\u2019s his story. When we first meet Mark, he\u2019s living on the edge of poverty, even though he\u2019s already won a gold medal, eating ramen for dinner and taking $20 speaking gigs at middle schools. He\u2019s an angry, frustrated, impacted man, his rage at the world \u2013 and at his brother, who was also effectively his parent after their parents\u2019 divorce \u2013 bursting out and then being shoved firmly back in.\n\nHis life changes when John du Pont enters the picture, inviting him to his mother\u2019s horse farm, Foxcatcher, where he has built a state-of-the-art training facility for Mark and his fellow Olympic wrestlers. From the beginning, it\u2019s clear that du Pont is a deeply odd duck, and it doesn\u2019t take long for us to learn that he\u2019s potentially quite dangerous \u2013 but it\u2019s not at all clear that Mark understands this. He seems genuinely to buy in to the thoroughly unpersuasive line of bull about America and freedom and victory that du Pont is handing out, seems all-too-willing to call du Pont a mentor, even a father.\n\nChanning Tatum, I have to say at this point, does an exceptional job of inhabiting this emotionally weak and pliable young hulk \u2013 the best work I\u2019ve ever seen him do. I completely believed that Mark bought into du Pont, and that, once he figured out that du Pont was a problem, and was sucking him into a completely one-sided and destructive relationship rather than actually helping him to win, he couldn\u2019t see how to escape it. The structural problem with the film, though, is that Mark never breaks out of that state of dependency.\n\nDu Pont eventually turns on Mark, and offers David enough money to come up to Foxcatcher to be his de-jure assistant, de-facto head coach. Mark resents this, and acts out \u2013 until its clear that he can\u2019t win on his own. Then his brother saves him from himself, and ultimately facilitates his escape from Foxcatcher and from du Pont, leveraging his importance to the operation to get a guaranteed income for Mark even after Mark leaves Foxcatcher and cuts ties with du Pont.\n\nMark, in other words, never achieves real independence, emotional or financial. He moves from dependence on his brother (the good mentor and father figure) to dependence on du Pont (the bad mentor and father figure) and back to dependence on his brother. And, from the final scene of the film, it looks like once his brother is dead, he descends into the lurid and degraded world of cage fighting \u2013 the final betrayal of his Olympian achievement.\n\nI want to be clear: the problem is not that this is a downer. I love a good downer. The problem is that Mark\u2019s failure to achieve independence means that the story doesn\u2019t really have an arc, and that therefore I don\u2019t know what his story means.\n\nWhy, after all, does Mark fall for du Pont? I don\u2019t mean why does he take the gig \u2013 he desperately needs the money, and while the film could do a better job of making it clear why he\u2019s so poor (to maintain his eligibility for the Olympics under then-extant rules, Mark had to remain an amateur, which meant not getting paid for any athletic activity), his financial need is manifest. But David has similar pecuniary reasons for compromise, and he never falls for du Pont for a second \u2013 he\u2019s clear eyed about what he\u2019s doing. Why does Mark fall for him?\n\nOne possibility is that Mark is responding to the fact that du Pont clearly has some kind of desire for him. Most of the chatter about the film has focused on du Pont\u2019s sexuality, and the film can be powerfully critiqued for playing into lurid gay stereotypes. But, as Jordan Schildcrout points out, the real problem isn\u2019t that du Pont embodies those stereotypes \u2013 maybe the real du Pont was like that \u2013 but that he doesn\u2019t have much interiority, that the film doesn\u2019t really let us know what it\u2019s like to be him. But that, in turn, is only a fatal problem if this is du Pont\u2019s movie. And it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s Mark\u2019s. This isn\u2019t \u201cGods and Monsters\u201d in which the presumably-straight young hulk is just the observer, so we can be seduced by the fascinating older monster along with him. Mark is the point. What does he see in du Pont?\n\nWell, what it looks like to me is that Mark is telling the truth when he says, in words du Pont put in his mouth, that he was looking for a father figure, and he finally found one. Du Pont is a pretty pathetic father figure, but he\u2019s one Mark found on his own, and therefore one that can separate him from his brother. The film gestures toward the possibility that Mark is involved sexually with du Pont, but inasmuch as it gestures that way \u2013 having Mark frost the tips of his hair, having him wrestle with du Pont at night in the gym \u2013 it also suggests that Mark is humiliated by the relationship. The obvious, surface read for that is a homophobic one \u2013 Mark is humiliated that a man has a sexual interest in him. But I think a deeper way to read it is that there\u2019s a kind of quasi-incestuous betrayal playing out in Mark\u2019s mind as he realizes that his new father is a weak and emotionally hungry man who just wants to use him. It really doesn\u2019t matter whether that \u201cuse\u201d includes sex or not.\n\nBut that understanding makes it all the more imperative that Mark achieve some kind of independence. Instead, Mark is saved by his brother, and drifts out of the movie. Du Pont finally kills David \u2013 because David took away his surrogate son and love object, and because David refused to say anything nice about him on the hagiographic video he had produced about himself. David forced him to confront his own manifest impotence, and so he had to be killed. And, reading the ending back into earlier parts of the movie, David\u2019s decision to stay with du Pont reads like a sacrifice of his own life to save his brother.\n\nNow, consider how the film would read if, instead, Mark had killed du Pont. Mark is clearly jealous when his brother arrives. He\u2019s angry at du Pont for saying that the team can\u2019t succeed without David \u2013 that Mark\u2019s not good enough. He\u2019s furious at his brother seeing him in the degraded state to which he\u2019s fallen (that\u2019s clearly how he thinks of it). What if, later, when his brother tries to \u201csave\u201d him from the meal ticket that he, Mark, had found for all of them, that only heightened his impotent rage, ultimately leading him to kill du Pont.\n\nThat would have been a much more lurid film. It might have played even more problematically in terms of what it was saying about the psycho-sexual overtones of the relationship between Mark and du Pont. But it would have kept Mark at the center. The question would have remained: who is this man, and what will he do? And I think it would have been more narratively satisfying.\n\nThat\u2019s not how it happened, of course. But then again, there are a lot of other things in the film that vary from \u201chow it happened.\u201d\n\nFor example: Steve Carrell\u2019s du Pont is a fascinating and creepy creation, and totally real \u2013 petty, stupid, emotionally stunted, but real. One of my favorite things about his performance is the way in which he reveals du Pont\u2019s human vulnerability at the same moment that he makes it all the more clear how deeply disturbed the character is. The scene on the helicopter, when du Pont takes cocaine and actually smiles as he plays with multi-syllable words; the scene after Mark has given him a haircut, and du Pont thanks him for being such a good friend, unlike his only childhood \u201cfriend\u201d who his mother paid to play with him \u2013 forgetting, apparently, that exactly the same pecuniary relationship obtains with Mark. Those kinds of scenes.\n\nWhat he doesn\u2019t seem is obviously psychotic. Which the real du Pont apparently was:\n\nJohn du Pont was insane. There was no doubt about that, even early on. I only met him a few times\u2014he didn\u2019t regularly attend training sessions\u2014but even casual contact with John left me with an uneasy feeling. He had a bizarre look in his eyes that\u2019s unlike anything I\u2019ve ever seen. Even a chance encounter with John just left you with strange pangs of foreboding. Stories about John\u2019s strange behavior were legion. He had a bad habit of driving inebriated around the estate and crashing into things. On more than one occasion, he drove the car into a pond. He also regularly carried a handgun with him and once, during his 50th birthday party, he inexplicably starting shooting off an AK-47. By all accounts, in the months leading up to the shooting John\u2019s behavior became even more bizarre. He kicked three African-American athletes off the farm, saying that Foxcatcher was run by the Ku Klux Klan and confronted one wrestler, Dan Chaid, by pointing an assault rifle at his chest. The warning signs were there, but it was hard for anyone to admit it.\n\nWhy was it hard to admit it? Because all the wrestlers needed that meal ticket. There\u2019s a story there to tell, a lurid parable of America in the 1980s, in which du Pont\u2019s wealth lures the wrestling world up to his farm, where he prances about like a mad hatter with an AK-47 and everybody looks away because they need the money. And, again, \u201cFoxcatcher\u201d gestures toward that film \u2013 but the tone of that film is incompatible with the tone of the story of Mark and du Pont\u2019s emotionally stunted folie \u00e0 deux.\n\nTo see what I mean, consider the difference in tone between \u201cFoxcatcher\u201d and what is probably the emblematic 1980s movie about money. Like Mark, the Charlie Sheen character Bud Fox in \u201cWall Street,\u201d \u2013 which came out in 1987, the year in which \u201cFoxcatcher\u201d is set \u2013 is torn between two mentors and father figures: the good one (Fox\u2019s actual father, a union leader at an airline), and the bad one (Gordon Gekko). But there the comparisons end. Gekko stands for something; he\u2019s an attractive anti-heroic figure. Fox is a young man of promise. We\u2019re seduced along with him \u2013 because Gekko is the true spirit of the age. Du Pont, by contrast, is repellent from the moment we meet him. There is nothing \u2013 nothing \u2013 attractive about this man. He\u2019s obviously weak, creepy, stupid and dangerous.\n\nIf we read the film is a kind of parable of the malign 1%, with Mark as America, then it\u2019s a pretty damning comment on America that we were ever seduced by the Reaganite myth. I mean, who but an emotionally weak and vulnerable idiot would ever be genuinely seduced by the likes of John du Pont? On that level, I \u201cget\u201d the movie, but it feels weirdly displaced in time \u2013 a parable of the Great Recession pasted onto the era of \u201cgreed is good.\u201d\n\nBy contrast, consider how the film would play out if David were the main character. Mark Ruffalo plays David as a conscientious and fundamentally giving person, without ever making him seem like a goody-goody or somebody without guts in his belly. He\u2019s both a good man and a real man. It makes sense that Mark could get sucked into du Pont\u2019s orbit, and couldn\u2019t figure out how to escape. What does it mean that David was willing, for the right price, to take his place?\n\nNow we\u2019ve got a story to tell \u2013 a story in which David thinks he\u2019s protecting his brother, thinks he\u2019s promoting the sport of wrestling, thinks he\u2019s doing all the right things. Du Pont can be a monster \u2013 he can even be the creepy monster of this film, and not somebody seductive at all. Maybe that very manifest weakness and stupidity is why David, representing the best of America, thinks he can handle the monster of gruesome wealth, accept its suzerainty for the sake of the good it can do. And then the monster kills him.\n\nBut that\u2019s David\u2019s story. Not Mark\u2019s.\n\nThis has been a difficult write-up for me, because I really like stories in which each character has weight, in which we can even be confused about who exactly is the protagonist. One of the scripts I wrote, the one I\u2019m probably most attached to, works that way a bit \u2013 though there is a main character, I try to give you the perspective of each of the major characters, see the whole film from the inside as each of them would. Many of Chekhov\u2019s plays are like that \u2013 is there really a single protagonist of The Cherry Orchard or The Three Sisters or Uncle Vanya? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nI\u2019m just not sure this is that kind of story. There\u2019s a powerful story hidden in this film, about fatherlessness and emotional dependence, about the corruptions of wealth \u2013 particularly hereditary wealth \u2013 and the impossible demands of American masculinity. And Tatum, Carrell and Ruffalo all give gripping and nuanced performances \u2013 plenty strong enough to keep me in the film. I\u2019m unequivocally glad I saw it \u2013 would be happy to see it again.\n\nI just worry that the truth got in the way of the story.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/thumbnail_19245.jpg", "published_at": "2014-12-03"}
