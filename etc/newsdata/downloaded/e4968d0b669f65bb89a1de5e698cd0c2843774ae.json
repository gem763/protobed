(AP) - Two high school football players in Tennessee have gifted some of their clothes to a freshman who says he was bullied for weeks over his wardrobe.\n\nMichael Todd tells reporters that he\u2019s been wearing the same clothes each day since he started at MLK College Preparatory School in Memphis. Todd says that wasn\u2019t anything new as he\u2019s been bullied his entire life. Classmate Kristopher Graham had taken part in the bullying, but flipped that script this week.\n\nGraham says he wanted to make up for laughing at Todd and so started pulling items from his closet to donate. He texted his teammate Antwain Garrett for help, and the two presented Todd with shirts, shorts and a new pair of shoes on Monday. Garrett said the moment nearly made him cry.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Two high school football players in Tennessee have gifted some of their clothes to a freshman who says he was bullied for weeks over his wardrobe.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
