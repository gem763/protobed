The DUP fired a warning shot last night that a dual status arrangement 'cannot work' and Northern Ireland 'must stay in a full UK customs union'.\n\nMeanwhile, Remainer MPs are plotting an ambush to force a referendum whether there is a deal or not, in a bid to cancel Brexit altogether.\n\nBoris Johnson (pictured visiting a school in Beaconsfield last week) is pleading with EU leaders to help him 'finish off ' Brexit as a backlash from Tory hardliners and the DUP threatens to derail his fledgling deal\n\nEmmanuel Macron (left) and Angela Merkel are meeting for dinner in France tonight in what could be a key moment for the Brexit talks\n\nA senior government source insisted the next 36 hours would be critical.\n\n'He'll be talking to Merkel, Macron and Juncker by the end of Monday to see if there's agreement on a 'landing zone' for Northern Ireland and customs,' they told the Sunday Times.\n\n'The message is: 'Let's finish this off.' The alternative is to agree a friendly version of no deal and finish it that way.'\n\nIn a sign of Downing Street's nervousness about the prospects of a revolt by Tory hardliners, Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg has been deployed to warn there will need to be compromises.\n\nMr Rees-Mogg, was a thorn in the side of Theresa May over Brexit before joining Mr Johnson's administration, said the Prime Minister had dedicated his political career to the cause of EU withdrawal.\n\nWriting in The Sunday Telegraph, Mr Rees-Mogg said: 'In the final stages of the Brexit negotiation, compromise will inevitably be needed, something even the staunchest Leavers recognise albeit unwillingly - but as a Leaver Boris can be trusted.\n\n'He wants to take back control and has dedicated his political career to this noble cause. If he thinks the ship of state is worth an extra ha'porth of tar he deserves support.'\n\nDeputy leader Nigel Dodds warned the mooted plan, which emerged following a breakthrough meeting between Mr Johnson and Irish premier Leo Varadkar last week - 'cannot work'.\n\nThe scheme, intended to avoid the need for customs controls on the island of Ireland, would see Northern Ireland remain politically in a customs union with the EU but it would be administered by the UK.\n\nHowever Mr Dodds told the Italian La Repubblica newspaper that Northern Ireland 'must stay in a full UK customs union, full stop'.\n\n'It cannot work because Northern Ireland has to remain fully part of the UK customs union,' he said.\n\nHe added: 'There is a lot of stuff coming from Brussels, pushed by the Europeans in the last hours, but one thing is sure: Northern Ireland must remain fully part of the UK customs union. And Boris Johnson knows it very well.'\n\nThe PM's Brexit 'sherpa' David Frost (pictured in Brussels last week) has been engaged in intensive negotiations with EU counterparts\n\nBritish officials have so far remained tight-lipped over the nature of the new plan.\n\nIf speculation is correct, it would create a customs border in the Irish Sea with goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland being subject to tariffs which Britain would collect on behalf of the EU.\n\nBusinesses would then be able to claim a rebate once they had shown the goods were for consumption in the UK market.\n\nHowever it would mean that Northern Ireland would be able to benefit from any post-Brexit trade deals the UK struck with other countries around the world.\n\nMrs Merkel and Mr Macron are meeting for dinner in France tonight, in what could be a key waypointer to the prospects of success.\n\nThe EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier is then due to brief EU ambassadors and MEPs tomorrow on progress in the talks.", "description": "Amid frantic wrangling, Boris Johnson will urge key players including Angela Merkel, Emmanuel Macron and Jean-Claude Juncker to strike a bargain that he can sell in Westminster.", "authors": ["James Tapsfield", "Political Editor For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/13/07/19647684-0-image-a-22_1570949739555.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
