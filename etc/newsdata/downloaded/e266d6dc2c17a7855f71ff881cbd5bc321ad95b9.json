The attacker doesn't need to have an account on the targeted forum.\n\nIn infosec lingo, this is what security experts call a \"pre-authentication remote code execution\" vulnerability, one of the worst types of security flaws that can impact a web-based platform.\n\nZDNet confirmed that this zero-day works as advertised with two different sources.\n\nUnclear if sabotage or failed disclosure\n\nDetails about this zero-day have been published on Full Disclosure, a public access mailing list.\n\nIt is not uncommon for security researchers to release details about unpatched security flaws when vendors fail to patch a vulnerability that's been privately reported.\n\nHowever, at the time of writing, it is unclear if the anonymous researcher reported the vulnerability to the vBulletin team, or if the vBulletin team failed to address this issue in a timely manner, prompting the researcher to go public as a result.\n\nMH Sub I, LLC, the company that commercializes the vBulletin forum software, has not returned a request for comment.\n\nIn addition, this could also be an act of intentional malice or sabotage, with the anonymous researcher dropping a zero-day just to hurt a company's reputation and put its customers at risk.\n\nThe researcher published details about this zero-day from an anonymous email service, without revealing their actual email address, so ZDNet wasn't able to reach out for additional details.\n\nTens of thousands of vulnerable forums\n\nDespite being a commercial product, vBulletin is today's most popular web forum software package, with a larger market share than open-source solutions like phpBB, XenForo, Simple Machines Forum, MyBB, and others.\n\nAccording to W3Techs, around 0.1% of all internet sites run a vBulletin forum. The percentage looks small, but it actually impacts billions of internet users.\n\nThis is because, by their nature, forums are designed to collect user information about registered users. While billions of internet sites don't store any info about users, a handful of online forums could very easily store data on most internet users. Therefore, a market share of 0.1% is actually pretty significant, when we factor in how many users could be registered on these forums.\n\nGoogle dorks reveal that there are tens of thousands of vBulletin forums running across the internet, as self-hosted installations, or running on vBulletin's hosting infrastructure. On its website, vBulletin lists some pretty big names as customers, such as Steam, EA, Zynga, NASA, Sony, BodyBuilding.com, the Houston Texans, and the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe only good news is that this zero-day only works against vBulletin 5.x forum versions. Forums running earlier versions are safe, if running up-to-date security patches.\n\nIf you're not testing every single company on @Hacker0x01 and @Bugcrowd for this vBulletin 0day RCE, you're missing out on free money.\n\n*make sure its in scope tho \u2014 u\u0250p\u0287ou@ \u2738 (@notdan) September 24, 2019\n\nZerodium, a company that buys exploits in web-based software to resell to law enforcement agencies, lists vBulletin remote code execution vulnerabilities in its exploit acquisition program.\n\nThis is because many dark web forums, such as those peddling criminal services, malware, or child abuse images, often run on vBulletin forums -- and these types of exploits could grant law enforcement agencies access to these illegal forums.\n\nAccording to the company's price chart, this type of pre-auth RCE could have gotten the anonymous researcher up to $10,000 in cash rewards, if he only would have contacted the company instead of publishing the exploit online and putting everyone's forum data at risk.", "description": "New zero-day could trigger a new forum hacking spree across the internet.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/24/2b6903dc-3351-4dfa-98a5-6b2375b9eca9/thumbnail/770x578/ea84003bc3990b0f5678e9b81eb98008/vbulletin.png", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
