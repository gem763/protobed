David Atherton announced as winner despite never being Star Baker", "language": "en", "text": "Get the biggest celebs stories by email Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email\n\nSelf-confessed \u201cunderdog\u201d David Atherton has won The Great British Bake Off \u2013 despite not being named as Star Baker once during the series.\n\nHe beat bookies' favourite Steph Blackwell, a shop assistant who'd won the title four times during the nine-week run and geography teacher Alice Fevronia, who'd clinched it twice.\n\nInternational health advisor Atherton, 36, achieved victory by impressing the judges with his picnic-themed showstopper, claiming that that he'd \u201csaved the best til last\u201d.\n\nAnd there were no hard feelings from runner-up Alice, 28, who insisted he fully deserved his surprise win. \u201cDavid just blew us out of the water - the best baker won,\u201d she said.\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nFellow finalist Steph, also 28, agreed: \u201cI have made some amazing life-long friends.\u201d\n\nThe trio were tasked with making the ultimate chocolate cake for the signature challenge and then twice baked stilton souffle for the technical. But the decision over who took the title came down to the showstopper, in which they had to create an illusion picnic basket using only cake, sweet bread and biscuits.\n\nAfter lifting the trophy, David admitted it was a huge shock. \u201cHonestly it was never in my mind that I thought I could win this.\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\n\u201cIt feels so good! It\u2019s been weeks and weeks of intensity and fatigue and then to finish it with this - I saved the best til last, and it\u2019s the best feeling in the world. Week on week other people were stronger, I was always the underdog and yet I just managed to get through.\n\n\u201cAll of it is a bit surreal, and I am still trying to process it, but the whole Bake Off journey is non-stop and part of it is just having the stamina.\u201d\n\nJudge Paul Hollywood said Yorkshire-born David fully deserved his triumph. \u201cHe has gone from nothing to win the whole thing; it\u2019s priceless, absolutely priceless, he should be really proud of himself. I think he has done an amazing job.\u201d\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nAnd Prue Leith agreed: \u201cDavid is an extraordinary baker. Right from the beginning he has never lost his temper he has always been very neat and organised. It was really a question of the tortoise catching the hare, he just steadily went on and won.\u201d\n\nDavid, who thanked his boyfriend Nik for supporting him throughout the series, said his best moment was when he'd got a coveted Hollywood Handshake during 1920s week.\n\nBut he admitted to never thinking he'd triumph because he'd had plenty of problems along the way. \u201cThe judges always loved my presentation but not my flavours so to get a first in the technical of the final was amazing.\u201d\n\n(Image: Channel 4)\n\nHe gave credit to his fellow finalists, gushing: \u201cSteph and Alice bake as good as they look, they are both beautiful inside and out. The three of us were so happy to be in the final together, we were so close and really supported each other. It\u2019s a shame we can\u2019t all win.\u201d\n\nDavid said his secret weapon was not letting the stress get to him. \u201cI wanted to enjoy myself rather than having any negative feelings. I am a calm person and I thought Bake Off would break me, but as it\u2019s such a friendly environment I thrived from week to week.\u201d\n\nSince his win, recorded in the summer, David has kept his trophy hidden under the bed but now plans to put a potted palm on it. He intends to reward the members of his pottery class with plenty of bakes as it was they who first encouraged him to apply for the show. \u201cI know they will be very pleased when they find out I have won,\u201d he laughed. \u201cThey had more faith in me than I did.\u201d\n\nDavid, who was taught to bake by his mum, said he had no plans to quit his job but hinted he'd like to write a cook book. \u201cI want to continue my role as a health adviser working with various charities all over the world, it\u2019s a big and important part of my life.\n\n\u201cI love researching recipes and writing them up, so just watch this space.\u201d\n\nDo you have a story to sell?
