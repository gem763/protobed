Trump said he did not think Americans wanted to see the U.S. military sent back into the region.\n\n\u201cWe are going to possibly do something very very tough with respect to sanctions and other financial things,\u201d Trump said without elaborating.\n\nTrump ordered the pullback after a phone call with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday, prompting rare criticism from senior figures in his own Republican Party who accuse him of deserting loyal U.S. allies - the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) led by Kurdish YPG militia. The SDF have been the main allies of U.S. forces on the ground in the battle against Islamic State since 2014.\n\nTrump has called the Turkish assault a \u201cbad idea,\u201d said he did not endorse it, and threatened to devastate the NATO ally\u2019s economy if Ankara\u2019s incursion into Syria wipes out the Kurdish population there.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he hopes he can mediate between Turkey and the Kurds following Turkey's offensive on U.S.-allied Kurds in northeast Syria.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439453677&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF99266", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
