ABC quickly condemned her tweet and called it \u201cabhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values.\u201d\n\nDISNEY CEO BOB IGER SAID FIRING ROSEANNE BARR WAS AN 'EASY' DECISION\n\nBarr wasn't completely taken aback by the firing because she admitted that before all the drama, she was told by execs not to say anything \"offensive.\"\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s kind of what killed the comedy thing for me. I was told that me getting in trouble one more time, I wouldn\u2019t have my reruns anymore. And I live on that [income], you know?\u201d she said. \u201cI asked for it to be defined\u2026 They said, \u2018You know what it means.'\u201d\n\nAfter \"Roseanne\"'s cancellation, other networks such as Viacom's Paramount Network, TV Land and CMT confirmed they would not air reruns of her show.\n\nThe Laff network also announced it was pulling reruns.\n\nROSEANNE BARR OPENS UP ABOUT HER LIFE AT HOME FOLLOWING HER FIRING FROM \u2018ROSEANNE\u2019: \u2018I\u2019VE GOT A LOT OF TIME FOR REAL LIFE STUFF\u2019\n\n\"While we believe viewers have always distinguished the personal behavior of the actress Roseanne Barr from the television character Roseanne Conner, we are disgusted by Barr's comments this week,\" the network said in a statement at the time. \"Therefore, we are removing the original 'Roseanne' series from the Laff schedule for the time being, effective immediately.\"\n\nAnd Barr's talent agency, ICM Partners, dropped her as a client because of the tweet.\n\nThe entertainer explained that she believed her termination and the cancellation of \"Roseanne\" was also politically motivated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all because I said that I like [Donald] Trump,\u201d she told Rogan. \u201cA lot of cabals in Hollywood, that\u2019s all they needed to hear: \u2018She must be destroyed.'\u201d\n\nDisney CEO Bob Iger called the decision to fire Barr \"easy.\"\n\nROSEANNE BARR'S FATE ON 'THE CONNERS' REVEALED IN SEASON PREMIERE\n\n\"It took about five minutes to know what we had to do,\" he told Oprah Winfrey on \"Super Soul Sunday.\" \"It seemed completely insensitive, completely disrespectful. It was very clear. The decision, it was easy to make.\"\n\n\"What she had done was very, very clear. I didn\u2019t believe any context could make this better or acceptable or could result in us forgiving her. So we did it. And you also know, in today\u2019s world, if there\u2019s a decision to be made by you, make it \u2014 because otherwise the world will make it for you, and that\u2019s never good.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE ALL-NEW FOXBUSINESS.COM\n\nThe network did order a spinoff series, \"The Conners,\" with the rest of the cast rehired.
