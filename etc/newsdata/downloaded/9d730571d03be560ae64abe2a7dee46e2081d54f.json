His show was a \u201csee now, buy now\u201d event - a trend in the fashion industry that sees labels make outfits displayed in catwalk shows available to consumers to purchase immediately.\n\nViewers watching the event live online were able to click on any outfit they chose and purchase the items right away. The Hilfiger brand, owned by fashion giant PVH Corp, is one of the best-known names in the U.S. apparel business, with over 1,600 retail outlets in the Americas, Europe and Asia.\n\nThe brand is the biggest contributor to PVH\u2019s sales. Nordstrom Inc will be the exclusive wholesale partner for the \u201cTommyxZendaya\u201d collection in the United States.\n\nNew York Fashion Week\u2019s five-day schedule, which previously ran for a full week, was streamlined to give buyers and editors more time to attend London Fashion Week, which follows directly after the New York event ends on Wednesday.", "description": "In one of the most anticipated New York Fashion Week runway events this season, American designer Tommy Hilfiger unveiled his latest ready-to-wear looks on Sunday in a collaboration with actress Zendaya at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.", "authors": ["Melissa Fares", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
