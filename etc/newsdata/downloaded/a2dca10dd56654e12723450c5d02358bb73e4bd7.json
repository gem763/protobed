Currently indigenous Catholics in remote parts of the Amazon can go months without seeing a priest or receiving the sacraments.\n\nAnother proposal calls for bishops to identify new \"official ministries\" for women, though priestly ordination for them is off the table.\n\nPope Francis walks in procession on the occasion of the Amazon synod, at the Vatican, Monday, Oct. 7, 2019.
