(Sean Kilpatrick/Canadian Press)\n\nGoudie told Kanellakos that two separately managed booking calendars \"which serve two different mandates\" have resulted in \"missed opportunities\" at Lansdowne Park, including:\n\nThe Canadian Country Music Awards.\n\nAn Oktoberfest.\n\nA \"Scarefest.\"\n\nThe possible return of the Central Canada Exhibition.\n\nTwo temporary, major animation exhibits.\n\nThe inference is that OSEG could attract these sorts of events if it had full control of scheduling all of Lansdowne, where the SuperEx had been held for years before 2011 when it was suspended to make way for the redevelopment.\n\nSince receiving the letter dated Sept. 24, the city manager has written a report recommending that council order staff to negotiate a new deal that would see OSEG manage the entire site.\n\nThe issue is headed to the financial and economic development committee Tuesday and to full council the following day.\n\nCouncillors, community skeptical\n\nBut many people aren't convinced that handing over the management of the public parts of Lansdowne is a great idea.\n\nCoun. Shawn Menard and community members, who packed the Horticulture Building at a Monday meeting, worry that OSEG's plan \"to evolve Lansdowne into Ottawa's pre-eminent entertainment hub\" will come at the expense of access and low-cost events for the public.\n\n\"The city must be focused on doing what is best for residents,\" said Menard in a press release Tuesday.\n\n\"We all understand that OSEG is a private business that must worry about profits and losses \u2014 and everyone wants to see this site succeed \u2014 but that doesn't mean that the city should give control of public assets to help private profits.\"\n\nOSEG and city out millions\n\nThe partnership between OSEG and the city is now seven years old and financially flailing.\n\nOSEG posted an $8 million loss in its latest financial report.\n\nAt the end of their 30-year financial partnership known as the \"waterfall,\" the city will make no money, while OSEG expects to be out tens of millions.\n\nOSEG argues that managing the entire site and getting those million extra visitors each year \"would increase the financial performance\" of the site.", "description": "Bringing some form of the SuperEx back to Lansdowne is one of the carrots that the Ottawa Sports and Entertainment Group is dangling in its pitch to take over the entire site.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5340655.1572435450!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/sprots.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
