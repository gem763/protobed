'We've built really good trust with our customers.' (Stu Mills/CBC)\n\nGetting to know you\n\nSisters Kelly and Carla Bourada are leading that transition, and they're doing it from a small, uninsulated outbuilding in Westboro.\n\nPreloved Ottawa is an unconventional consignment clothing store that opened in February. The sisters find lightly used women's fashion items, then model them for their Instagram followers.\n\nOften, the jackets, sweaters and pants are declared sold seconds after the short video has been posted.\n\nWe've built really good trust with our customers. They come in, they're like, 'I feel like I know you!' - Carla Bourada, Preloved Ottawa\n\n\"It's been a personal shopping experience for a lot of people,\" said Carla Bourada, who said she posts as many as 20 different pieces on any given day.\n\n\"People see us trying on clothing so they know what it looks like on our bodies. They know they are able to message us and get an immediate response,\" she said. \"We've built really good trust with our customers. They come in, they're like, 'I feel like I know you!'\"\n\nWith 60 per cent of the store's sales come through its social media account, Kelly Bourada said she can imagine a future with no physical store at all.\n\n'I would like to think our customer is the educated consumer who wants to buy a quality piece that\u2019s going to last them a long time,' said James Michael Brooks about his high-end leather goods. (Stu Mills/CBC)\n\nNiche market\n\nJames Michael Brooks is also trying to set himself apart from the crowd.\n\nIn a converted three-car garage in Chelsea, Que., Brooks and several apprentices turn out limited runs of exquisite leather handbags, wallets, belts and even hand-made hockey bags.\n\n\"I would like to think our customer is the educated consumer who wants to buy a quality piece that's going to last them a long time, and they also want to buy into the idea that it's a small operation,\" said Brooks, who designs each item and oversees production.\n\nLeather working tools hang from a shelf in the Chelsea, Que., workshop of James Michael Brooks. (Stu Mills/CBC)\n\nBrooks said by keeping his operation small and staying in control of every aspect, he's been able to maintain not just the quality of his products, but their exclusivity as well.\n\n\"Otherwise, you can just go to any big box store and buy something that has been produced by the thousands,\" he said.\n\nThe Amazon juggernaut\n\nThe retail juggernaut that is online shopping seems like an unstoppable force. Carleton University's Ian Lee estimates the share of products purchased online could grow from the current 10 per cent to 25 per cent within five years.\n\nSome shoppers continue to resist the trend, however, and are insisting on the personal experience. For a few, it's working.\n\n\"Stores are closing, I don't deny that,\" Lee observed. \"But to extrapolate to, 'We're all doomed?' We're not.\"\n\nThe survivors in this shifting retail landscape, Lee said, will be those who offer what he calls \"hand-holding\" \u2014 an in-person experience with a focus on expert service, customization and the personal touch.\n\n'We're bucking the trend,' said Eric Kunstadt as workers put the finishing touches on his family's fourth retail location. (Stu Mills/CBC)\n\nThe personal touch\n\nNot everyone's ready to give up on bricks and mortar, however.\n\n\"We're bucking the trend,\" said Eric Kunstadt as carpenters put the finishing touches on the workshop area of his family's new ski and bike shop, also in Chelsea. \"It's a bit scary, and we're aware of the difficulties in retail.\"\n\nIt's Kunstadt's fourth retail location, joining three others in Ottawa.\n\nKunstadt believes the expertise they offer sets his family's business apart from other retailers when it comes to resisting the online shopping trend.\n\n\"You'll only buy downhill ski boots online once,\" Kunstadt observed. Only experienced staff can help customers find the right fit for their size, shape and skiing ability, he said.\n\n\"The formula that has been working for us for the last 30 years has been just providing top-notch service.\"", "description": "As online sales continue to bite into the profits of bricks and mortar retailers, some businesses in the National Capital Region are focusing on unique products and personalized service as a means of setting themselves apart.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5289529.1568901363!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/kelly-bourada.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
