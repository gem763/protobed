With his driver poised to become a six-time world champion in Sunday's Mexican Grand Prix, the Austrian argued that the prejudice Hamilton received in the junior karting ranks remained a central element of his psychological make-up today.\n\n\u201cWhen Lewis was younger, he was the only black kid among the white kids, and I know he was racially abused on the track,\u201d Wolff said.\n\n\u201cIf that happens to an eight-year-old, or a 10-year-old, it just leaves scars that will not go away. If as a child, you have to had to overcome abuse discrimination, on one side it makes you a stronger personality. But on the other it also leaves scars. Today, Lewis has a good and mature perspective, but the scars are certainly there. Those scars are a witness of having survived.\u201d\n\nHamilton, as one of the few black drivers in an overwhelmingly white motorsport landscape, was a trailblazer from the moment he first enjoyed karting success. He has also made frequent pleas for Formula One to improve its work on diversity. When asked why he had been penalised by stewards at the 2011 Monaco Grand Prix, he joked, acidly: \u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I am black. That\u2019s what Ali G says.\u201d", "description": "Toto Wolff, the Mercedes team principal, has made the dramatic claim that Lewis Hamilton carries permanent scars from the racist abuse he experienced as a child.", "authors": ["Oliver Brown", "Chief Sports Feature Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/formula-1/2019/10/25/TELEMMGLPICT000214011837-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqkzRVrpaG8pgYx8zuruU0oLxVMM-N2Dh3uu4C0ivbnMw.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
