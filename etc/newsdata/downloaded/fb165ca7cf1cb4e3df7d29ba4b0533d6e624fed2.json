It said: \u201cWe will offer 30% interest for a period of 3 months and a possibility to become a Member of the Royal Warrant Holders Association [sic]\u201d.\n\nIt said paying the cash to the European Union means the economy will be kept intact and inflation will not rise or fall for a minimum period of ten years.\n\nIt added: \u201cWe want this letter to \u00adremain anonymous as we do not wish the subject to go viral. This could affect the agreements we have in order to obtain the \u00adbilateral agreement.\u201d\n\n(Image: Getty)\n\nA bitcoin address is \u00adprovided, asking for transfer of funds before another \u00adletter with a \u201ccontract\u201d will be sent. The scam \u00adletter was \u00adreceived by Paul Ridden, CEO at SmartTask, a UK tech firm.\n\nHe \u00adsuspects the tricksters opted to print it on paper because the public have \u00adbecome vigilant against email scams asking for huge donations to foreign royalty.\n\nHe said: \u201cWe get quite a lot of \u00adattempts where \u00adpeople pretend to be a supplier or me or my financial director.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll pretend to be my head of \u00adaccounts. They\u2019ll attempt by email or telephone call to try to manipulate the accounts team to pay money.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a thing we face daily, \u00addefending the \u00adbusiness from those kind of social \u00adengineering attacks.\n\n\u201cBut this is the first time we\u2019ve had one printed on paper and requesting bitcoin.\u201d\n\nHe said: \u201cWhen I \u00adposted it online I \u00adassumed sooner or later somebody would say \u2018I\u2019ve got one too.\u2019 There\u2019s \u00adnobody else who\u2019s had one, so maybe it\u2019s a bit more \u00adlocal. When you think it\u2019s in an envelope with a stamp on, somebody\u2019s had to pay for that.\u201d\n\nAfter revealing the first class stamp on the envelope wasn\u2019t franked he said: \u201cIt\u2019d be ironic if I\u2019m getting free postage out of it.\u201d\n\nSales consultant Martin Leich raised a chuckle by feigning concern and saying Mr Ridden should not have exposed the Queen to \u00adembarrassment.\n\nMr Leich joked: \u201cWhy are you posting this online? It clearly states \u00adprivate and confidential.\n\n\u201cWhat if the EU hears about this? You\u2019re risking the bilateral agreement. I don't know what Boris is going to do when he finds out.\u201d", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: The bogus letter pretends to be from a senior aide of her majesty and is even stamped with a fake royal seal, as it asks for cash to be sent using electronic currency bitcoin", "authors": ["Alan Selby", "Image", "Getty"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20465984.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Queen-Elizabeth-II.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
