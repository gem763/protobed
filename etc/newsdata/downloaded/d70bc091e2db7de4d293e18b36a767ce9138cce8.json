The change of plans comes as REITs begin to consider WeWork a higher risk as analysts pick apart the pre-IPO company.\n\nInvestor and landlord fears surrounding WeWork (NYSE: ) focus in part on the IPO, which, if unsuccessful, could force the property sharing startup to drop out of lease agreements. This, in turn, could be a disaster for those REITs and landlords who rely on WeWork for monthly revenue.\n\nThe relatively quiet pause on the part of Harvest Properties likely has other potential REITs and landlords thinking twice about working with WeWork, given the pre-IPO re-evaluation that changes \u2014 for the worst \u2014 seemingly daily.\n\n\u201cWeWork has got to rework its whole position in the marketplace,\u201d Scott Rechler, CEO of RXR Realty, a New York developer and investor that has WeWork as a tenant, told The Wall Street Journal. \u201cBecause if they don\u2019t, landlords aren\u2019t going to be comfortable doing deals with them.\u201d\n\nSo what is WeWork's \"position in the marketplace\"?\n\nWe've tracked WeWork location growth since 2017. Just two years ago, WeWork had 107 locations listed on its site. Today, that number has exploded to 904.\n\nThat impressive growth \u2014 new shared offices in exciting new markets in growing cities \u2014 is part of what fueled investors' interest in WeWork. But now, it's this number, which is viewed as a liability for a business that, so far, has failed to show a profit.\n\nBut WeWork \u2014 despite the attention given to it as of late \u2014 isn't the only business heavily dependent on tennants who pay their bills all while managing the overhead of office lease costs. IWG (formerly Regus) has been in the game longer than WeWork and, as such, operates more than 4x the number of shared office spaces worlwide. Meanwhile, other players in the space such as Knotel and Industrious are busy opening new offices of their own.\n\nEntity Name Store ID (Count) Regus 3,934 WeWork Spaces Works Knotel Industrious\n\nWeWork's rapid growth and massive pre-IPO valuation (along with a still-growing list of curious details discovered in the company's S1 and surrounding CEO Adam Neumann) shed light on the office-sharing marketplace and one of the things that people \u2014 especially potential investors in WeWork \u2014 are learning is that WeWork isn't the only player in the space. A map of WeWork along with IWG, Knotel, and Industrious shows that the globe is dotted with multiple alternatives for business owners looking for a place to get to work.\n\nCutting overhead before it's too late\n\nMeanwhile, WeWork is responding to market concerns by shucking overhead. In the past quarter, hiring activity as measured by job listings posted to WeWork's careers website, has dropped by more than 14% after a pervious quarter rise of 29%.\n\nBut the company remains soberly bullish on its expansion plans, telling Barron's that reports of landlords not signing new leases with it aren't accurate.\n\n\u201cWeWork continues to sign new lease agreements with our landlord partners,\u201d the company told Barron\u2019s. \u201cWe expect the pace of entering new lease agreements to slow over the next several quarters as we pursue more strategic growth and focus on accelerating our path to profitability.\u201d\n\nAbout the Data:\n\nThinknum tracks companies using information they post online - jobs, social and web traffic, product sales and app ratings - and creates data sets that measure factors like hiring, revenue and foot traffic. Data sets may not be fully comprehensive (they only account for what is available on the web), but they can be used to gauge performance factors like staffing and sales.", "description": "Market Overview Analysis by Thinknum covering: WeWork.
