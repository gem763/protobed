Just a little stinger,\u201d Etienne told reporters after the game. \u201cMy right leg, instant impact, just kind of hurt it a little at that moment. I was kind of walking around on the sideline, and it felt better.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nEtienne finished with 192 yards, including a 49-yard scoring run late in the third quarter, on 14 carries. It was the most yards for Etienne since he rushed for 205 in the season-opening win against Georgia Tech on Aug. 29.\n\nAD\n\nAfter the victory over Georgia Tech, his production had dipped over the next four games until last week, when one of the most elusive running backs in the country amassed 127 yards on a season-high 17 carries in a 45-14 win over Florida State.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really come out the last two weeks and really has put it on the line,\u201d Clemson co-offensive coordinator Tony Elliott told reporters. \u201cI think that\u2019s great for him, and it\u2019s also great for those young backs to see what it looks like. He had great leadership in [former Clemson running back] Adam Choice last year. This is a new frontier for him.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cSo being able to play at a high level and lead at a high level, that\u2019s a difficult challenge.\u201d\n\nEtienne has made a habit out of feasting on the Cardinals, gaining 443 yards in three games against the Tigers\u2019 ACC Atlantic Division opponent. He\u2019s averaging 15.8 yards per carry in those games, all victories.\n\nAD\n\nElliott earlier this week indicated he had installed more designed runs for Etienne heading into the game against the Seminoles, essentially eliminating the pass option in the Tigers\u2019 RPO attack.\n\nEtienne has 781 yards and six touchdowns on 98 carries this season for the No. 1 rushing team in the ACC.\n\nLast year he rushed for 1,658 yards and 24 touchdowns on 204 carries and finished seventh in voting for the Heisman Trophy. In last season\u2019s College Football Playoff championship game, Etienne had 86 yards and two touchdowns in Clemson\u2019s 44-16 win against Alabama.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe could have came back in [against Louisville],\u201d Elliott said. \u201cWe were in a situation where we didn\u2019t need him. He\u2019s kind of banged up, so he\u2019s got a couple things going on with him. Nothing major, and it\u2019s typical of a running back. Every play something\u2019s going to hurt.\u201d\n\nRead more on college football:\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cIt\u2019s feeling better.
