He said Mr. Gamble had failed to make a compelling case based on those documents for overruling the court\u2019s longstanding interpretation of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s double jeopardy clause.\n\n\u201cThe English cases are a muddle,\u201d Justice Alito wrote. \u201cTreatises offer spotty support. And early state and federal cases are by turns equivocal and downright harmful to Gamble\u2019s position. All told, this evidence does not establish that those who ratified the Fifth Amendment took it to bar successive prosecutions under different sovereigns\u2019 laws \u2014 much less do so with enough force to break a chain of precedent linking dozens of cases over 170 years.\u201d\n\nThere had been signs that at least some justices were uneasy with that line of cases. In 2016, Justice Ginsburg, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas, called for a new look at whether the exception makes sense. \u201cThe matter warrants attention in a future case in which a defendant faces successive prosecutions by parts of the whole U.S.A.,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAs that alliance suggested, the issue did not divide the justices across the usual ideological lines. But Justice Thomas reversed course in a 17-page concurring opinion on Monday, writing that \u201cthe historical record does not bear out my initial skepticism of the dual-sovereignty doctrine.\u201d\n\n\n\nJustice Thomas\u2019s opinion was also notable for its extended critique of the court\u2019s general approach to how much respect to give precedents. He said the court should not hesitate to overrule \u201cdemonstrably erroneous precedents.\u201d\n\nIn dissent, Justice Ginsburg said the court should have overturned the double jeopardy decisions at issue in Mr. Gamble\u2019s case, saying they had \u201cbeen subject to relentless criticism by members of the bench, bar and academy.\u201d", "description": "The justices refused to overrule precedents that allow separate prosecutions for the same crimes in state and federal courts.", "authors": ["Adam Liptak"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/17/us/politics/17dc-scotus-jeopardy/17dc-scotus-jeopardy-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-06-17"}
