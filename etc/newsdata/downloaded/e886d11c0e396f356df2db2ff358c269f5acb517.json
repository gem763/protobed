Mandatory Credit: Jesse Johnson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nMajor League Baseball has already taken one look at why so many home runs have been hit in recent seasons, but with 2019 taking the home run blitz to new extremes, commissioner Rob Manfred said it\u2019s time to check again.\n\n\u201cWe have reconvened the group of scientists that worked with us before,\u201d Manfred told Maury Brown of Forbes.com. \u201cWe\u2019ve asked them to take a fresh look at everything that is occurring with the baseball. We expect to get this new report shortly after the World Series.\u201d\n\nDifferences in the baseball have been speculated as the primary reason for the uptick in the number of home runs this season.\n\nThe previous record for most home runs in a major league season was 6,105, set in 2017. That mark fell this season, when MLB saw No. 6,106 leave the confines of Orioles Park in Baltimore on Sept. 11. The 2018 total was 5,585. Starting play on Wednesday, MLB batters had hit 6,590.\n\n\u201cThe only thing I\u2019m prepared to say at this point in time is I do think that we need to see if we can make some changes that gives us a more predictable, consistent performance from the baseball,\u201d Manfred said.\n\nWhen the scientists began their research in 2015 leading to the first report, which came out in May 2018, they cited factors such as reduced drag on the ball and changes to the thickness of the laces on the ball.\n\nThe Commissioner\u2019s Office said when the first report came out that it would take several steps, including monitoring temperatures and humidity levels at ballparks; reviewing manufacturing specifications for baseballs, and formulating standards for how baseballs receive their mud rubdowns.\n\n\u2014Field Level Media", "description": "Major League Baseball has already taken one look at why so many home runs have been hit in recent seasons, but with 2019 taking the home run blitz to new extremes, commissioner Rob Manfred said it's time to check again.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190926&t=2&i=1433994341&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8P05X-OCASP", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
