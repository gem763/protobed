It had closed last week at just below $1.30 having soared 6.5% since British Prime Minister Boris Johnson struck a new EU divorce deal on Oct. 10.\n\n\"The number one issue now is whether they are going to allow the vote (on the deal) to happen later,\" said Saxo Bank's head of FX strategy John Hardy, who added the FX market now seemed to be betting on the deal being approved.\n\n\"You could see further (upward) reaction if that is the case but also quite some downside if there is a delay and we get back into what happens next.\"\n\nDespite Saturday's delay of the deal vote, which meant Johnson had to begrudgingly ask the EU for another extension of the Brexit deadline, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC that he was confident enough lawmakers would pass the deal.\n\nThe political manoeuvring puts the timing of the whole process in question yet again, even though markets seem assured that it significantly reduces a 'no deal' Brexit, considered by many to be the worst-case scenario for the UK economy.\n\n\"Although many eyes are still on Brexit, there is not so much nervousness in the market as the risk of a no-deal Brexit has actually reduced over the weekend,\" said Shinichiro Kadota, senior forex and rates strategist at Barclays (LON: ) in Tokyo.\n\nGoldman Sachs (NYSE: ) said it sees the chance of a 'no deal' Brexit reduced to just 5%, from 10% previously. currency moves were limited though the last few weeks has seen some sizeable shifts taking place.\n\nThe dollar is down 2.5% this month against a basket of top currencies which, if it stays that way, would be its worst month since January last year.\n\nIt edged up against the euro to $1.1157 per euro but was little changed at 108.48 to the safe-haven yen. The yen has been weak too, last week hitting a 2-1/2-month low.\n\nCENTRAL FOCUS\n\nThe Bank of Japan meets later this month and could nudge its interest rates even deeper into negative territory, while Thursday will be Mario Draghi's last meeting in charge at the European Central Bank.\n\nChina's yuan firmed on Monday after the central bank fixed the daily midpoint at its strongest in five weeks, and a comment from the central bank chief that the exchange rate was at the \"appropriate level\" reinforced market sentiment.\n\nPrior to market opening, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the midpoint rate CNY=PBOC at 7.0680 per dollar. It was 10 pips firmer than the previous fix of 7.0690, and the strongest since Sept.16.\n\nIn a statement posted on the International Monetary Fund website on Saturday, PBOC Governor Yi Gang said the yuan is at \"an appropriate level\" based on economic and market fundamentals. since the beginning of August has been driven and determined by market forces and reflects shifts in market dynamics and volatilities in global foreign exchange markets amid recent global economic and financial developments and escalating trade tensions,\" Yi said.\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/35RTMtl Sterling shorts trimmed\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/2W0D9ae Dollar positioning and\n\nhttps://tmsnrt.rs/31xSQqH\n\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>", "description": "FOREX-Sterling slips on Brexit vote delay, dollar claws higher", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEE7E039_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
