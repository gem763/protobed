According to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least two of the first eight civilian casualties from Wednesday\u2019s first day of fighting were Christian Assyrians residents of the city of Qamishli.\n\n\u201cChristians and others are extremely worried,\u201d Bassam Ishak, political leader of the Syriac Christian community, told the Catholic News Service (CNS) in a phone interview Wednesday. \u201cThe Turkish bombing seems designed to push people out of their towns, if, in fact, they manage to escape alive.\u201d\n\nOn Monday as news of the impending pullout spread, criticism flew from former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who called Mr. Trump\u2019s decision a \u201cHUGE mistake\u201d on Twitter, to televangelist Pat Robertson, declared Mr. Trump would be \u201cin danger of losing the mandate of heaven if he permits [the U.S. withdrawal] to happen,\u201d on an episode of his show, \u201cThe 700 Club.\u201d\n\nJohn Stonestreet, the host of Christian radio program \u201cBreakPoint,\u201d urged listeners Wednesday to contact the White House and tell them to \u201cstand by the Kurds,\u201d who Mr. Stonestreet said maintain lands in northern Syria that are the \u201clast-resort havens for persecuted Yazidis and Christians.\u201d\n\nTony Perkins, chairman of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), said Wednesday that the Turkish invasion puts at risk a rare oasis of religious tolerance in the region. The Syrian Kurds have been widely praised for allowing various faiths to practice their religion freely in the lands under their control.\n\n\u201cCivilians in territory controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), who represent a diverse group of religious and ethnic communities, are now at dangerous risk of falling victim to the violent chaos that Turkey\u2019s incursion is likely to spark,\u201d Mr. Perkins warned in a statement.\n\nIraqi Christians are bracing for a flood of religious refugees from Syria as the Turkish campaign proceeds, said Father Emanuel Youkhana, a priest of the Assyrian Church of the East.\n\n\u201cDefinitely, many people will try to flee to Iraq, and the borders are expected to be open from the Iraqi side to innocent civilians,\u201d he told the Catholic News Service from northern Iraq.\n\nAs few as 10,000 ethnic Yazidis may still live in the Kurdish region, according to a 2017 estimate from Yazda, a U.S.-based Yazidi advocacy group. According to the U.S. government, Christians account for about 10% of Syria\u2019s population, though that number has dwindled since the civil war erupted in 2011.\n\nCountries of concern\n\nIn the most recent USCIRF report on worldwide international religious freedom, the State Department labeled Syria as one of the \u201ccountries of particular concern,\u201d alleging the most severe and persistent oppression of faith freedom in the world. Turkey, under President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s increasingly authoritarian rule, was placed on a watch list.\n\nWhat remains of both the Christian and Yazidi communities is concentrated in northern Syria, where the SDF and other forces still resisting Syrian President Bashar Assad retain some control. But that control may be in doubt with accounts on Wednesday that Turkey\u2019s Air Force \u2014 on orders from Mr. Erdogan \u2014 has begun bombing the village of Misharrafa in the Kurd-controlled region.\n\nAlready, reports of \u201cmass panic\u201d have worried international religious liberty observers, who say they\u2019ve seen this pattern before.\n\nIn 2018, after the Turkish offensive dubbed \u201cOperation Olive Branch\u201d cleared out the U.S.-backed leaders in the northwestern Syria town of Afrin, there were reports of Islamist Syrians forcing conversions of Yazidis, kidnapping Yazidi women and girls, and looting Kurdish properties. The Gatestone Institute, a New York-based conservative think tank, also reported in May 2018 of discussions between jihadist rebel groups and Turkish military leaders to establish Islam-based sharia law.\n\nMr. Perkins said U.S. and allied action was urgently needed to prevent \u201ca repeat of the disastrous occupation of Afrin, Syria, by Turkish forces and their Syrian militia allies since 2018, which has displaced beleaguered Kurds, Christians, Yazidis and others.\u201d\n\nWhile the Trump administration has touted international religious freedom as a top foreign policy goal, hosting a July summit in Washington with representatives from over a hundred nations attending, Mr. Trump has also sought to end America\u2019s participation in what he has called \u201cendless wars\u201d in the Middle East and elsewhere.\n\nA Wednesday morning statement to the press pool at the White House said Mr. Trump had made it clear to Mr. Erdogan that the U.S. does not \u201cendorse this attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cTurkey has committed to protecting civilians, protecting religious minorities, including Christians, and ensuring no humanitarian crisis takes place \u2014 and we will hold them to this commitment,\u201d said Mr. Trump in the statement.\n\nA second worry is that thousands of hardened Islamic State fighters, now being held in makeshift detention centers in Syria manned by the Kurds, could escape or even be set free if their Kurdish jailers are diverted to fight the Turks.\n\nThe Islamic State \u201ccaliphate,\u201d eradicated in large part through the efforts of SDF fighters backed by U.S. and allied military support, practiced an extreme and intolerant form of Islam in the areas it controlled.\n\n\u201cNortheast Syria was a relatively free but fragile environment before this dangerous incursion,\u201d said USCIRF Vice Chair Gayle Manchin, in a statement Wednesday. \u201cThere is now a serious risk that Turkey\u2019s offensive, and the likely redeployment of SDF troops to confront it, could open the door to a mass escape of ISIS detainees or a dangerous resurgence of the terrorist group in Syria and beyond.\u201d\n\nMr. Erdogan \u201csays he is creating a \u2018safe haven\u2019 in northeast Syria to bring Syrian refugees back,\u201d Father Youkhana told CNS Wednesday. \u201cActually, it is a demographic change policy by forcing Kurds, Christians, and Yazidis out and putting Sunni Muslims in their place.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
