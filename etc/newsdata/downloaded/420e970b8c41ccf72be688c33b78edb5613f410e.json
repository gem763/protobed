It\u2019s my way of escaping the heat and grease and their persistent dehydration. It\u2019s pretty much a salve for all internal and external stress.\u201d\n\nIs there one dish you won\u2019t cook? \u201cI can\u2019t imagine saying no to making something, especially if I\u2019m cooking for somebody else. I\u2019m most inspired when I\u2019m cooking for somebody else. As long as they don\u2019t want an extinct species of mammals, then I\u2019d say I\u2019m pretty much game for anything.\u201d\n\nAll-time favorite spice. \u201cI think about ginger a lot. Like too much. It\u2019s spicy, it\u2019s sweet, biting and warm. Ground ginger, in particular, brings a completely different flavor\u2014and when you use both fresh and ground together, those flavors intensify\u2014that\u2019s when flavor gets real!\"\n\nWhat is your favorite music to listen to while you cook? \u201cFor me, it either has to be jazz or Brazilian music. The open-ended flow of jazz and the infectious cadence of Portuguese, always feels like the right background to cooking with joy and love.\u201d\n\nDid you grow up cooking as a child? \u201cI didn\u2019t do much cooking as a child but the one dish I made thousands of times was a train wreck marinara sauce with every single spice, condiment and shitty idea I could muster. It was terribly brown, undeniably sweet and barely edible.\u201d\n\nWhat cookbook is your go-to resource for inspiration? \u201cCookbooks with recipes feel like an already completed book of songs but sometimes it\u2019s nice to just improvise with The Flavor Bible. It\u2019s a book of culinary harmony, dissonance and melodious food infinity.\u201d\n\nAfter all these years working in restaurants, do you still enjoy going out to eat? \u201cI do and I don\u2019t. I love food, I crave food, and eating great food is a luxury in life I\u2019m so grateful to be able to have access to\u2014and sometimes I never want to go out to eat again. The parking, host stand dance, the often disconnected service, the misappropriation of time, etc. It all leads to a dilemma.\u201d\n\nIs there one chef you\u2019d like to cook with? \u201cFor his boundary defying innovation, I would cook with David Chang or for his incredible nonstop thought provoking deliciousness and commitment to excellence, Jos\u00e9 Andres.\u201d\n\nName the all-time best cooking show. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be either America\u2019s Test Kitchen or Cooks Illustrated. There\u2019s a certain level of plating narcissism on display that can be found in some of the modern cooking shows we see today. That\u2019s not what I personally want to see. What I want to see is basic Christopher Kimball and his every person team of cooks, explaining patiently tested methods of ricing potatoes for the best gnocchi in three different climates and elevations.\u201d\n\nWhat is the one tool that you always make sure to pack when you\u2019re traveling for business? \u201cIf I\u2019m traveling for business it would have to be my iPad. Keeps me organized takes pictures and pretty much runs the show.\u201d\n\nJustin Cucci is the chef and owner of Denver\u2019s Edible Beats restaurant group, which includes Root Down, Linger, Root Down DIA, Ophelia\u2019s Electric Soapbox, Vital Root and El Five.
