He has pleaded not guilty to related counts and is free on bond pending trial, albeit unable to use social media services as a consequence of the gag order in question.\n\nU.S. District Court Amy Berman Jackson, the judge presiding over Mr. Stone\u2019s upcoming criminal trial, warned him in February against making statements that pose a likelihood of prejudicing his case. Mr. Stone posted on image on Instagram several days later that depicted crosshairs next to the judge\u2019s head, prompting her to respond by ordering him not to comment at all on social media about matters related to his trial.\n\nProsecutors subsequently learned of several further violations, resulting in the judge outright banning Mr. Stone in July from sharing content to \u201cFacebook, Twitter, Instagram or any other form of social media.\u201d\n\nMr. Stone and his family failed to establish that no adequate alternative remedy exists to challenge the gag order, the appeals court ruled in denying their petition.\n\nMr. Stone\u2019s trial is currently set to begin on Nov. 5 in Washington, D.C.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
