It had completed all stages in the Commons in a matter of hours on Wednesday.\n\nMr Benn said he was \u201cvery troubled\u201d by suggestions that Mr Johnson will not comply with the bill\u2019s requirements.\n\n\u201cDelighted that our bill to stop a damaging no-deal Brexit on 31 October has now been passed by the House of Lords, but very troubled by the prime minister\u2019s repeated statements that he will not seek an extension under any circumstances,\u201d said the Brexit Committee chairman.\n\n\u201cEither we have the rule of law or we do not.\u201d\n\nSir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, said the passage of the bill was a \u201chugely important victory in the fight to stop Boris Johnson\u2019s plan for a no-deal Brexit\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe will not let this prime minister put jobs and the economy at risk,\u201d said Sir Keir.\n\nBut Tory grandee Sir Malcolm Rifkind condemned the manoeuvre as \u201cjuvenile\u201d, warning it would merely introduce a month-long delay to the Brexit process, which would be damaging to business and jobs and prolong uncertainty and political gridlock without affecting the end result.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to The Independent, Sir Malcolm predicted that Mr Johnson would \u201cgrit his teeth\u201d and accept the \u201chumiliation\u201d of the U-turn on his pledge rather than wave goodbye to Downing Street. Or he said Mr Johnson could even stand aside for a matter of weeks and appoint a caretaker PM to undertake the painful job of requesting a further extension before his return to No 10, in order to avoid personally breaking his promise.\n\n\n\nDescribing the \"dead in a ditch\" comment as \"a theatrical statement, not to be taken too literally\", the former foreign secretary said: \"The reality is he is not going to break the law. It is a serious political embarrassment for the government, but in the real world delaying an election which all parties agree is appropriate will have no practical impact on Brexit but will be damaging for business.\"\n\n\n\nOpposition leaders including Labour's Jeremy Corbyn and Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson agreed in a conference call not to vote for a 15 October election on Monday, because of fears that Mr Johnson could simply ignore the anti-no-deal legislation until the Halloween deadline has passed.\n\n\n\n\"We were all clear we are not going to let Boris Johnson cut and run,\" said a Liberal Democrat spokeswoman.\n\n\n\n\"The Liberal Democrat position for a while now is that we won't vote for a general election until we have an extension agreed with the EU. I think the others are coming round to that.\n\n\n\n\u201cAs a group we will all vote against or abstain on Monday.\"\n\n\n\nConservatives branded Mr Corbyn \"chicken\" for refusing to vote for an election which he has long demanded.\n\nSpeaking during a visit to Aberdeenshire, Mr Johnson said: \u201cI\u2019ve never known an opposition in the history of democracy that\u2019s refused to have an election, but that\u2019s their choice.\n\n\u201cI think obviously they don\u2019t trust the people, they don\u2019t think that the people will vote for them, so they\u2019re refusing to have an election.\n\n\u201cAnd so what we will do is we will go to the summit on the 17th, we\u2019ll get a deal and we\u2019ll come out on October 31.\u201d\n\nThe bill includes provisions for MPs to vote on the final version of Theresa May\u2019s withdrawal agreement, thanks to an amendment passed by accident when tellers were not provided to record votes against.\n\nA cross-party group calling itself MPs For A Deal \u2013 including former Tory minister Rory Stewart, who was expelled by Johnson this week, Labour\u2019s Stephen Kinnock and Caroline Flint and Liberal Democrat Sir Norman Lamb - said May\u2019s compromise plan, drawn up in discussions with opposition leaders, provided \u201ca solid and realistic basis\u201d for the PM to secure a deal which could be put to parliament when it returns from prorogation on 14 October.", "description": "The author of a new law to block a no-deal Brexit, which completed its passage through parliament on Friday, has said he is \u201cvery troubled\u201d by suggestions that prime minister Boris Johnson will not comply with it.
