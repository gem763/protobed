The judge narrowed the number of allegedly defamatory statements the Post wrote about Sandmann, 17, however, from 33 to three.\n\nSandmann\u2019s family is seeking at least $250 million in damages for the reporting that portrayed the MAGA hat-wearing teen as a racist for smiling in the face of Native American activist Nathan Phillips in January. As his lawyers point out, they seek \u201cthe amount Jeff Bezos, the world\u2019s richest person, paid in cash for the Post when his company, Nash Holdings, purchased the newspaper in 2013.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Post wrongfully targeted and bullied Nicholas because he was a white, Catholic student wearing a red \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 souvenir cap on a school field trip to the January 18 March for Life in Washington, D.C. when he was unexpectedly and suddenly confronted by Nathan Phillips, a known Native American activist, who beat a drum and sang loudly within inches of Nicholas\u2019 face,\u201d Sandmann\u2019s lawyers wrote in their new amended complaint released Monday. \u201cThe Post knew, or should have known by exercising the slightest diligence, that Phillips was not a trustworthy witness and that it would be negligent to republish Phillips\u2019 narrative of the January 18 incident without a proper investigation.\u201d\n\nBertelsman said that though he had initially dismissed the entire case, upon further review he decided that \u201cjustice requires\u201d that \u201cdiscovery be had\u201d regarding three statements by Phillips quoted by the Post related to Phillips\u2019 false claims that Sandmann \u201cblocked\u201d Phillips and \u201cwould not allow him to retreat\u201d during the incident on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. Sandmann\u2019s lawyers said that, contrary to what Phillips claimed and the Post reported, \u201cNicholas stood quietly and respectfully for several minutes after being targeted and bullied by Phillips.\u201d\n\nThe judge further noted that the new filing from Sandmann\u2019s lawyers \u201calleges in greater detail than the original complaint that Phillips deliberately lied concerning the events at issue and that he had an unsavory reputation,\u201d which the Post could and should have known about. The judge said these claims by Sandmann\u2019s lawyers will be subject to proof but that \u201cthey do pass the requirement of plausibility.\u201d\n\nLin Wood, one of Sandmann\u2019s lawyers, tweeted that \u201cthe news of our team\u2019s huge win in Covington, KY reaffirms my career-long belief that our system of justice works\u201d and that \u201cNicholas Sandmann deserves his day in court against WaPo. Now he will get it.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs a prepare for summary judgment hearing today in LA in Vernon Unsworth v. Elon Musk, the news of our team\u2019s huge win in Covington, KY reaffirms my career-long belief that our system of justice works. Nicholas Sandmann deserves his day in court against WaPo. Now he will get it. \u2014 Lin Wood (@LLinWood) October 28, 2019\n\nSandmann\u2019s lawyers pointed out that the Post relied upon deceptive viral video clips and ignored important context about Phillips, including his actions instigating the confrontation with Sandmann as well as his lengthy history of activist confrontations and questionable storytelling. The lawyers also stated that \u201cthe Post and its reporters falsely reported that Phillips was a Vietnam veteran in an attempt to bolster outrage at his purported mistreatment,\u201d which they were forced to retract when it was revealed that Phillips had lied about serving overseas.\n\nThe legal team also pointed out that the Post failed to include in their reporting key details about other events happening in the vicinity of the Covington students on the day in question, including the Black Hebrew Israelites, a recognized hate group, who \u201cbegan verbally assaulting and taunting Nicholas and his CovCath classmates with threats of physical violence and vitriolic statements\u201d in the lead up to Phillips approaching Sandmann.\n\nSandmann\u2019s lawyers claimed that \u201cthe Post ignored basic journalistic standards because it wanted to advance its well-known and easily documented, biased agenda against President Donald J. Trump by impugning individuals perceived to be supporters of the President.\u201d\n\nBertelsman ordered a scheduling conference in the case for Dec. 3.\n\nThe Sandmann family has also filed lawsuits against CNN and NBC, and both of those outlets are fighting to dismiss the cases.\n\n", "description": "A federal court in Kentucky revived the lawsuit brought by Covington Catholic High School student Nick Sandmann\u2019s family against the Washington Post.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://mediadc.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c973933/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2290x1202+0+50/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmediadc.brightspotcdn.com%2F98%2F10%2F0b777a80418db2b6cd81e7315e94%2Fcovington.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
