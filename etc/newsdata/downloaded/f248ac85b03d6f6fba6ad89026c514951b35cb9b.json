Max Rose, a Democrat from a conservative district in New York, penned an op-ed this weekend arguing against pursuing a \u201cpartisan impeachment process.\u201d\n\nMr. Nadler, however, has grown frustrated with the media for saying there\u2019s confusion on what the committee is up to. He argued that \u201cimpeachment investigation\u201d is just a shorthand term for an investigation into whether to proceed with articles of impeachment.\n\n\u201cWhat is incorrect is when you said we are not involved in an impeachment inquiry,\u201d he said. \u201cI have said this in very certain terms, as many times as I can, as definitely as I can now.\u201d\n\nThe first \u201cimpeachment hearing,\u201d as Mr. Nadler described it, will take place Tuesday, featuring former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, however, has notably avoided using that phrase to describe the investigation.\n\nShe told reporters last week that impeachment is divisive, and said six committees still have work to do before on the investigations they\u2019ve been conducting for months before a decision can be reached.\n\n\u201cI stand by what we have been doing all along. I support what is happening in the judiciary committee because that enables them to do their process of interrogation and their investigation. And I salute them for that work,\u201d Mrs. Pelosi said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m going to way on the subject and there\u2019s nothing different from one day to the next,\u201d she added.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
