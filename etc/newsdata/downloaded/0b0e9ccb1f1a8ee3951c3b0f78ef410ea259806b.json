But while every year brings new faces, one feature of the academic landscape remains ever-present: the huge, imposing blackboards.\n\nNow photographer Jessica Wynne, a professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York, has thrown a spotlight on this workhorse of academic endeavour, travelling across the US and beyond to capture the blackboards of mathematicians.\n\nThe result, a project called Do Not Erase, reveals the scribbles, workings and eureka moments of minds bursting with equations and theories, a paean to mental graft and the blackboards that display it. You can almost feel the tickle of dust in the nose, the thump of chalk on the board, the swish of a cuff brushing away a mistake.\n\nWynne says the project came about after she got to know the mathematicians Amie Wilkinson and Benson Farb, both professors at the University of Chicago, and their academic friends during summers in Cape Cod.\n\n\u201cI became fascinated by the people, the mathematicians, and then, when I was talking to them about their work, I realised that their thought process and what they do is extremely creative \u2013 and I never really thought about mathematics in that way,\u201d says Wynne.\n\n\u201cI thought the blackboards would be an interesting way to get a peek into their world,\u201d she says.\n\nThe project also struck a personal note. \u201cMy parents were teachers at a small New England boarding school and I grew up on the campus \u2013 I sort of grew up in a classroom,\u201d she says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The blackboard of David Damanik, Rice University. Photograph: Jessica Wynne\n\nVisiting institutes around the world, from the US to France and Brazil, Wynne says she gives mathematicians a free rein as to what they draw. Their fields are diverse, ranging from geometric topology to quantum mechanics.\n\n\u201cFor some of them, I wandered into lectures and some have been in their offices and they have done boards for me,\u201d says Wynne, adding that she is just about to meet a mathematician at Yale University to photograph a blackboard that hasn\u2019t been erased in three years. \u201cHe said, \u2018I just keep adding to it,\u2019\u201d she says.\n\nThat the subjects of her portraits are somewhat antiquated is no surprise. Wynne says she deliberately shunned whiteboards, or digital boards. \u201cI like the timelessness about blackboards,\u201d she says, adding that they are also intriguing for their capacity to show layer upon layer of working.\n\nProfessor David Damanik, a mathematician at Rice University, who is among those featured, says he uses blackboards to build a narrative. \u201cOn the blackboard, it is easier to develop your story and your argument.\u201d\n\nWilkinson agrees. \u201cAlmost everyone in the maths department at the University of Chicago teaches at a blackboard. When we are working on a problem it is the best way, when you have more than two people for example, to show your ideas,\u201d she says.\n\nIt\u2019s a process Wynne saw for herself when she joined Wilkinson on a trip to Paris and watched her work with her collaborators on a blackboard. \u201cIt is almost like this interesting dance or performance as you watch these mathematicians and it is really beautiful,\u201d she says.\n\nThe sheer size of blackboards, ranging from single wall affairs to extensive, multi-panel boards, is important. \u201cIt is this giant canvas,\u201d says Wynne. \u201cSeeing everything in one large piece, you can jump around on the board and connect pieces and take things away and add things... I haven\u2019t seen any other tool or any other device that matches that experience.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The blackboard of Amie Wilkinson, University of Chicago. Photograph: Jessica Wynne\n\n\u201cThere are so many aspects to a blackboard that are so wonderful that just can\u2019t be replaced by anything else,\u201d says Wilkinson.\n\nNot that it hasn\u2019t been tried. Wilkinson says there was a furore among mathematicians at one US university when the blackboards were stripped out and replaced with whiteboards. \u201cYou would remove the blackboards at University of Chicago over the faculty\u2019s collective dead, rotting bodies,\u201d she said, although she acknowledged that academics in some other disciplines, like computer science, are not averse to whiteboards, a medium she sometimes uses but dislikes for being harder to clean, and the hard to remove stains they leave on the skin.\n\nIf working with chalk is alluring, so too are the boards themselves. \u201cThe ones in Paris were beautiful because they were so old and I really loved and appreciated the old slate, just as a material,\u201d says Wynne, adding that the zigzag boards at Rice University, on which Damanik\u2019s work is shown, produced a striking image. \u201cHis board was coming out at you, so it has this three-dimensional, almost disorienting feeling when you look at it,\u201d she says.\n\nDamanik\u2019s multi-board work, he tells me, explores how to understanding the time evolution of a quantum mechanical system, focusing on the importance of various mathematical features.\n\n\u201cThe way the chalk looks on the board I find to be very beautiful, but also knowing that there are other layers of meaning there,\u201d says Wynne. \u201cI also like the fact that what I am documenting will never be there again.\u201d\n\nWilkinson and Damanik say there are stories of lightbulb moments lost to an inadvertent duster, though it hasn\u2019t happened to them. \u201cWhen someone writes something particularly excellent, one tends to photograph it,\u201d says Wilkinson.\n\nDo Not Erase will be published by Princeton Books in 2020", "description": "Photographer Jessica Wynne captures the peculiar devotion of academics to working out their problems with chalk", "authors": ["Nicola Davis"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/02b906426a5acc195ba33c4538dffcf3d9d2b501/41_82_2895_1738/master/2895.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=26e6d89cc36e9cad0cc5d919854175c3", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
