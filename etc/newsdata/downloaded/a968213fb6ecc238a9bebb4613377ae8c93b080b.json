He opened that window and he fired down onto the officers outside.'\n\nMr Scutt described how the police 'scrambled for cover' behind an armed response vehicle parked by the house.\n\nThe two officers, known only as IC and IX, are seen making their way towards the front door, before Hannam is accused of firing at them with a shotgun\n\nThe side of this vehicle was allegedly hit with pellets from Hannam's shotgun.\n\nIn a phone call to police during the incident, he is alleged to have said: 'I'm down for a shoot out, I'm not going to lie.\n\n'I've got unlimited cartridges. Someone is going to die tonight. One of you lot is going to die.'\n\nThe jury heard Hannam had gone to see his on-off girlfriend at her home in Park Street on the evening of January 22.\n\nHe then took his shotgun and cartridges into town to meet a 'geezer' he had previously argued with.\n\nHannam later told police he fired the gun into the air while waiting for the man, then returned to Park Street.\n\nThe defendant left the house to buy cocaine but became 'very cross' when he could not get hold of his supplier, Mr Scutt said.\n\nThe side of this vehicle was allegedly hit with pellets from Hannam's shotgun. In a phone call to police during the incident, he is alleged to have said: 'I'm down for a shoot out'\n\nHe went to McColls newsagents for alcohol and cigarettes, shooting twice at the door, before walking to a car park at 1.44am.\n\nAt 1.47am he approached a BMW driven by Oliver Walter-Taylor, who had driven there to meet a female friend.\n\nHannam is accused of attempting to kidnap Mr Walter-Taylor by getting into his BMW and pointing the shotgun at him.\n\nAfter a struggle, both men got out and Hannam allegedly fired two shots in the air, with pellets hitting the car.\n\nIn a 999 call to police moments later, Mr Walter-Taylor said: 'Someone has just pointed a shotgun at me. He has just fired another shot. I've just legged it.'\n\nMr Scutt told the jury that Hannam's actions could be described as a 'rampage', as by that point he had 'loaded and fired' three times.\n\nPolice attended Park Street at 2.10am and a decision was made to 'contain' the property, with armed officers surrounding it by 2.45am.\n\nHannam is accused of attempting to kidnap Mr Walter-Taylor by getting into his BMW and pointing the shotgun at him. After a struggle, both men got out and Hannam allegedly fired two shots in the air, with pellets hitting the car\n\nHannam later told police that his girlfriend had woken him up to tell him that police were outside.\n\n'He got out of bed and he went downstairs when he was aware of the police to get the shotgun,' Mr Scutt said.\n\n'You have heard one or two shots coming from above those police officers. He fired more shots out of the back window of the house where there were officers.\n\n'He carried on firing until he ran out of cartridges. After that, he surrendered to the police.'\n\nAt 4.25am, Hannam threw the shotgun out of the back window of the house and was arrested.\n\nNeither IX or IC were hit by the shot or shots fired out the front window.\n\nHannam denies two counts of attempting to murder a police officer, possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life and attempting to kidnap Mr Walter-Taylor.\n\nHe has admitted possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence, making use of a firearm with intent to resist arrest and attempting to burgle the McColls shop.\n\nThe trial continues.", "description": "Daniel Hannam, 32, is charged with two counts of attempted murder following a standoff in Castle Cary, Somerset earlier this year in which he allegedly told police officers: 'I'm down for a shoot-out.'", "authors": ["Rod Ardehali For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/11/19833098-0-image-a-32_1571309910034.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
