He sat down shortly after al-Baghdadi\u2019s death by suicide bomb as Army Delta Force soldiers and war dogs pursued him into a dead-end tunnel at a compound in northwestern Syria.\n\n\u201cThere were no doctors but he received treatment,\u201d Sajet said. \u201cHe was treated for his wounds, for his diabetes, his blood pressure. \u2026 He had a device to check his sugar level.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, he was wounded and received treatment, but his condition was good,\u201d he added.\n\nA transcript was provided by the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI).\n\nSajet expressed pessimism that the Islamic State, the murderous terrorist army founded by al-Baghdadi in 2011, can survive.\n\n\u201cI think that even if al-Baghdadi were not killed, ISIS is finished,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s over. ISIS does not exist anymore. After Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was killed, it is over. The morale is shattered. People are broken. Even if someone takes over, the organization is over.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. and Kurdish allies smashed al-Baghdadi\u2019s so-called caliphate in eastern Syria while American forces, teamed with Iraqis, also evicted the group from that country.\n\n\u201cBy Allah, he was shocked by that,\u201d Sajet said.\n\nWhat remains today is a global network of ISIS followers willing to execute terror attacks across the globe, guided by constant Internet propaganda on various social media channels.\n\nSajet said his leader was well armed and always wore the suicide vest.\n\n\u201cThey had hand grenades, American machine guns, as well as bazookas. He was completely ready,\u201d he said.\n\nSajet said al-Baghdadi never expected to be found.\n\n\u201cBy Allah, we did not expect this to happen, because he took strong security measures. I think that he was well hidden. Yes, we did not expect this to happen and [al-Baghdadi] did not expect that he would be killed, because of all the security measures,\u201d Sajet said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
