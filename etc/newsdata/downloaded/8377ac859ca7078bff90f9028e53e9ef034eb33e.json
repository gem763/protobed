Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nPelosi's comment came shortly after Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee voted to expand its impeachment investigation, signaling their probe of President Donald Trump was ramping up.\n\nMark Wilson/Getty Images\n\n\u201cI stand by what we have been doing all along. I support what is happening Judiciary Committee because that enables them to do their process of interrogation and in their investigation and I salute them for that work,\u201d Pelosi, D-Calif., said at her weekly news conference. \u201cImpeachment is a very divisive measure. But if you have to go there will have to go there. But we can't go there unless we have the facts. And we will find the facts.\u201d\n\nJ. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nPelosi said Democrats will make a decision on impeachment \u201cwhen we are ready.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's the only question. That\u2019s all I have to say about this subject,\u201d Pelosi said, clearly annoyed at the persistent questioning. \u201cAnd there's nothing different from one day to the next. We're still on our same path.\u201d\n\n\"I'm not answering any more questions on this subject.\"\n\n\n\nNancy Pelosi battles reporters on whether the House is conducting an impeachment inquiry after the House Judiciary Committee voted to expand their investigation parameters this morning. https://t.co/M5slGg72vA pic.twitter.com/r2zeL1V58K \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) September 12, 2019\n\nBut this week, members of the House Democratic Caucus have appeared confused by the current state of play and semantics surrounding the investigation. Reporters continued to press Pelosi, who appeared to grow agitated by reporters\u2019 incessant focus on impeachment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said what I\u2019m going to say on the subject. That\u2019s it,\u201d Pelosi boomed. \u201cWe are legislating. We are focusing on the work that we're here to do for the American people. And part of our responsibility is to honor our oath of office to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. And in doing so we are getting, seeking the facts. I'm not answering any questions on this subject. That is what we have said all along.\u201d\n\nTom Brenner/Getty Images\n\nAhead of ABC's Democratic presidential debate Thursday night in Houston, Pelosi said her unsolicited advice for candidates would be to tout the \u2018For the People\u2019 message that resonated with voters in 2018 \u2013 not to attack the president.\n\n\u201cI myself would say, they're not asking for any advice. They're running for president of the United States. They have that confidence about their why, why they are like, what they know about their subjects, how they intend to achieve them. So what I'm looking for is how this, these leaders will emerge as the list perhaps gets smaller, maybe it won't. But as we proceed is, who among them will connect?\u201d she said. \u201cBecause the election is always about the future, and what that future means to America's working family.\u201d\n\nPelosi said that when Democrats won 40 seats in congressional midterm elections last fall, she discouraged members and candidates \u201cfrom ever even mentioning the President's name.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I would I know that that part of the debate is who can contend with him,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cBut I think more importantly, it for the American people, it\u2019s who can really connect with them, identify with their hopes and dreams and aspirations, and apprehensions, and that they \u2013 all of this vision, knowledge, judgment, strategic thinking up here, but they have to show people what is in their hearts and how they connect with the American people. So that's what I'll be watching.\u201d\n\nAsked whether she has a personal favorite yet, Pelosi laughed.\n\n\u201cDo I have a personal favorite? Ten or 20!\u201d she said. \u201cNo, they\u2019re all great, they're all great. But my favorite button that I see across the country is \u2018Democrat for President.\u2019 That seems to have blossomed across the country, which I traveled extensively.\u201d\n\nAt the end of her newser, a reporter took one more crack at questioning Pelosi about impeachment, asking whether she is uncomfortable with the term \u201cimpeachment inquiry.\u201d Pelosi feigned disbelief, backing away from the podium before reiterating her position once again and taking a dig at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell over gun control.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll follow the facts. That's what it is,\u201d Pelosi stressed. \u201cWhy don't we spend some time going over to see Mitch McConnell and asking him why he doesn't want to save lives? Why he will let every day go by what at least 100 people, large number of them children or teenagers die from gun violence. Why is it that you're hung up on the word over here, when lives are at stake over there?\u201d", "description": "House Speaker Nancy Pelosi won't say whether an impeachment investigation is underway.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/nancy-pelosi-ap-jt-190912_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
