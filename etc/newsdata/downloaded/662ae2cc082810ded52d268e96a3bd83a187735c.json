REUTERS/Ruben Sprich/File Photo\n\n\u201cThis afternoon, Joi Ito submitted his resignation as Director of the Media Lab and as a professor and employee of the Institute,\u201d MIT President Rafael Reif said in a letter posted online.\n\nIto could not be reached for immediate comment. The New York Times and New Yorker reported he said in an internal email, \u201cAfter giving the matter a great deal of thought over the past several days and weeks, I think that it is best that I resign as director of the media lab and as a professor and employee of the Institute, effective immediately.\u201d\n\nLast month, Reif said the elite university would review its process for accepting donations after taking about $800,000 from foundations controlled by Epstein, who committed suicide while in jail awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.\n\nThe New Yorker article uncovered deeper fundraising ties between the Media Lab and Epstein and said the institution had actively tried to conceal the extent of its connections with the disgraced financier.\n\nOn Saturday, Reif described the acceptance of contributions from Epstein as a \u201cmistake of judgment\u201d and said he had instructed MIT\u2019s general counsel to bring in a prominent law firm to investigate the matter.\n\n\u201cBecause the accusations in the (New Yorker) story are extremely serious, they demand an immediate, thorough and independent investigation,\u201d Reif said.\n\nIto previously apologized for having accepted donations from Epstein and had said he would raise an amount equivalent to the donations the lab received from foundations controlled by Epstein and \u201cdirect those funds to non-profits that focus on supporting survivors of trafficking.\u201d\n\nThe New Yorker said Ito disclosed this week he received a further $1.2 million from Epstein for investment funds under Ito\u2019s control and $525,000 for the lab. Epstein also secured $7.5 million in donations for the lab from other wealthy individuals.\n\nOn Saturday, Ito also resigned from the board of directors of The New York Times Co and of PureTech, a biotechnology firm, according to statements from the two companies.", "description": "The director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab stepped down on Saturday after a New Yorker magazine article revealed the lab tried to conceal donations from disgraced late financier Jeffrey Epstein, the university said.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190907&t=2&i=1427414159&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8614V", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
