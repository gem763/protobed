REUTERS/Erin Scott\n\nSenator Bob Menendez, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Congress had not been made aware of any substantive review of security assistance to Ukraine or any policy reason the funds should have been withheld.\n\nIn a letter to Mike Mulvaney, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Menendez said \u201cit is becoming clear that\u201d Trump put pressure on Ukrainian officials.\n\nMenendez, in one of three letters sent to administration officials, also said \u201cwe must immediately understand whether, and to what extent, the President and his team converted duly-appropriated United States foreign assistance funds for his personal and political benefit, and what role federal agencies may have played in it.\u201d\n\nTrump on Monday denied trying to coerce Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a July 25 phone call to launch a corruption investigation into political rival Joe Biden, the frontrunner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and Biden\u2019s son in return for the U.S. military aid.\n\nSeparately on Tuesday, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, was to meet with senior Democrats to consider impeaching Trump. Under the U.S. Constitution, the House has the power to impeach a president for \u201chigh crimes and misdemeanors\u201d and the Senate then holds a trial on whether to remove the president from office.\n\nPelosi had in the past opposed impeachment efforts but appeared to be moving closer as Democrats demand that the Trump administration release details of a whistleblower complaint and the transcript of his call with Ukraine\u2019s president.\n\nIn his letter, Menendez noted that the U.S. State and Defense Departments recommended and prepared to distribute in late June $391.5 million in military and security assistance to boost Ukraine\u2019s armed forces as the country dealt with Russian aggression and sought to improve maritime security in the Black Sea.\n\nHowever, weeks before Trump\u2019s call with Zelenskiy, OMB blocked the aid, Menendez said in the letter to Mulvaney.\n\n\u201cUkrainian officials were reportedly \u2018blindsided,\u2019\u201d Menendez wrote. \u201cFor months, despite repeated inquiries from my office and others, administration officials have been unable to offer any policy justification for why these funds were blocked.\u201d\n\nIn his letters, Menendez asked for information about who decided to withhold the funds, whether Trump directed that they be withheld, how the administration communicated between departments about the decision and what changed between the decision in June and the release of the money this month.\n\n\u201cI understand from State Department officials that the White House provided the Department with no official reason for delaying security assistance to Ukraine for almost three months, which is highly disconcerting,\u201d Menendez wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\nA Senate aide told Reuters on Tuesday that officials from the State Department confirmed to Senate staff on Friday that neither the State Department nor the Pentagon had policy objections to the release of money to Ukraine. The aide said Senate staff had also been told that it was Mulvaney who directed the State department not to send the money to Ukraine.", "description": "A senior U.S. senator demanded on Tuesday an investigation of the withholding of nearly $400 million in aid for Ukraine by President Donald Trump's administration, as more congressional Democrats backed calls for impeachment action against Trump.", "authors": ["Patricia Zengerle", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190924&t=2&i=1433359697&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8N15V", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
