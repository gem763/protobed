However, it received mixed reviews. After the grand success, a sequel, Venom 2, is in the works already, but Ruben Fleischer, the helmer of the original, has stepped out of the director\u2019s chair letting Andy Serkis take the chair.\n\nhnentertainment.co\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that Ruben Fleischer doesn\u2019t know about the movie\u2019s fate. In an interview with Fandom, he said Tom Hardy\u2019s Venom and Tom Holland\u2019s Spider-Man are destined to confront each other. \u201cThat\u2019s where it\u2019s all going to lead,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n\n\nreddit.com\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the exciting thing, because we changed the origin of Venom\u2026 in the comics, he evolved from Spider-Man but because of the Marvel-Sony thing we weren\u2019t able to that. And so the thing I think it\u2019s building towards, and will be exciting to see, is when they actually do confront each other.\u201d\n\nDon't Miss 23.7 K SHARES 12.1 K SHARES 4.4 K SHARES 4.5 K SHARES\n\nTwitter\n\nSo, will Tom Hardy share screen space with Tom Holland in the next Venom movie itself? That remains to be seen. Sony Producer Amy Pascal also said that Tom Hardy will be back in Venom 2. \u201cI can say that Tom Hardy will be back, magnificently playing that character as no one else can.\u201d\n\nTwitter\n\nAbout Andy Serkis taking over Venom 2, Ruben Fleischer said, \u201cIf anything, I would have changed the critics\u2019 reaction to it. I was really bummed that people didn\u2019t like it because it\u2019s a crowd-pleasing movie and I\u2019m not sure if there was just blow-back against Sony or people just worship Marvel.\u201d\n\nTwitter\n\n\u201cBut I was really surprised that the critics [were gunning for it] because audiences really enjoyed the movie. And so many people who\u2019ve seen it just appreciated that it was a fun superhero movie. So I was a little surprised. I don\u2019t know what they were expecting.\u201d\n\nVenom 2, meanwhile, is slated to hit the screens in 2020.", "description": "Venom 2, is in the works already, but Ruben Fleischer, the helmer of the original, has stepped out of the director\u2019s chair letting Andy Serkis take the chair.
