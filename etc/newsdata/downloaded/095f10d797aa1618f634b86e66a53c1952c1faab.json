Trump expressed condolences for a stabbing attack in Finland, and Niinisto talked about European security and melting Arctic sea ice.\n\nBut when the questions turned to impeachment, Trump's stormy mood gathered force.\n\nHis voice rising with anger, Trump lashed out at Reuters reporter Jeff Mason, who asked what he had wanted Zelenskiy to do when Trump brought up the business ties to Ukraine of Biden's son Hunter.\n\n\"It's a whole hoax, and you know who's playing into the hoax? People like you and the fake news media that we have in this country,\" he retorted. He told the reporter not to be\u201crude\u201d and repeatedly evaded the question.\n\nThe news conference was supposed to include two questions from the American side and two from the Finnish side. But after the third questioner, Trump had had enough, ending the event and walking off stage.\n\n\u00a9 (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2019.", "description": "U.S. President Donald Trump is mad as hell.
