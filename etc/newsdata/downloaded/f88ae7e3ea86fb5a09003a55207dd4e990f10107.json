Michael Bloomberg is the realist we need.\n\nI was invited to speak at the Cambridge Union in England earlier this month, and it was an honor to meet with so many intelligent, socially involved people. During the Q&A that followed my remarks, the moderator asked my opinion about the 2020 presidential election, and I didn\u2019t mince words. I said our American family has been fractured in recent years. We\u2019re hopelessly divided, and a bitterly divided family cannot thrive. The only way we can begin to come together again, I said, is if Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City, becomes our next president.\n\nI realize I am taking a personal and a career risk in making such a statement. I have carefully stayed away from politics for 50 years, except to vote. But times have changed in our country, and I believe the moment has come for me to step out from behind the curtain. I want to speak honestly and from the heart \u2014 regardless of the consequences.\n\nJudge Judy Sheindlin, \"Judge Judy,\" hears a case in Los Angeles in 2010.

I respect his comment \u2014 but our political landscape has changed profoundly since he made it. There is ferment on the left and the right, candidacies are rising and falling, and this has created an opportunity for Bloomberg, a man of the center, to change his mind.\n\nMichael Bloomberg, pragmatist\n\nHere\u2019s why I believe that\u2019s so important.\n\nAn independent, tough-minded businessman, he represents our best chance to bring America together again and begin the long national process of healing. Unlike those on the far the right and the far left who use their bully pulpit to divide us, he\u2019s a pragmatist, a man who has shown time and again that he knows how to get things done and cares more about results than ideology. That\u2019s a skill in short supply these days, on both sides.\n\nBlowing the whistle on Trump's health: Mental health experts see Trump is dangerous, but our professional gatekeepers protect him\n\nI believe that if your political party has lost an election \u2014 either to elect a mayor, governor or president of the United States \u2014 you are obligated to spend the next four years finding the best possible candidate to beat the incumbent. There used to be a preponderance of folks on the Democratic side who understood the need to elect a centrist candidate, someone who could build coalitions and reach across the aisle. But in this campaign, candidates are fighting to out-left each other with pie-in-the-sky proposals for free money and free education. Everybody gets a thousand dollars, everybody gets free college tuition. Everybody gets, everybody gets, but where does all this getting come from?\n\nFormer New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg arrives at the World Mayors Summit in Copenhagen, Denmark, in October 2019. (Photo: Martin Sylvest/epa-EFE)\n\nWe need a no-nonsense president who\u2019s sane, competent and honest, someone who can\u2019t be bought and has no skin in the game. As he showed during 12 years as mayor in New York City Hall, Michael Bloomberg fits the bill. He\u2019s a self-made billionaire, a man who made a lot of money in a very straightforward, transparent way. He\u2019s an advocate for strong action on climate change. He believes in reasonable gun control, like the vast majority of Americans. He believes in making certain that the criminal element in our society \u2014 which scars the life of so many \u2014 is treated firmly, swiftly and fairly.\n\nThe hardest column I ever had to write: I went back home to Ohio's Trump country. In Appalachia, honest people have hope again.\n\nMost important, he\u2019s the only person out there who seems to understand that screaming at one another gets us nowhere. After all the sound and fury we\u2019ve experienced in the past three years, we need to tone down the rhetoric. Americans can no longer afford to let shrill voices drown out all the others in our society, because that would be a distortion of everything we stand for.\n\nAmericans once disagreed civilly\n\nI realize you may vehemently disagree with me, and that\u2019s OK. We all know that spirited debate is part of what makes this country great, and so different from other nations. But let\u2019s keep it civil. As fellow Americans, we should respect each other\u2019s voices. If someone expresses an opinion in a thoughtful, well-behaved manner, those who disagree should do so in the same manner. Sadly, that lesson has been utterly forgotten since the last presidential election, and we\u2019re paying the price for it every day.\n\nAmerica is a young country, compared with the nations of Europe and Asia, and we still have a spectacular story to tell the world. But we\u2019re also a work in progress, and the 2020 presidential election will be one of the most important in our history. I know I would sleep better \u2014 and so would millions of other Americans \u2014 if the next president is someone who listens patiently and respectfully to all sides of an issue before taking action. Let\u2019s not waste this opportunity to show that we are still an extraordinary beacon for the world. In this election, our votes can truly make a difference \u2014 and that\u2019s why I strongly urge Michael Bloomberg to run for president.\n\nJudy Sheindlin is a former supervising judge of Manhattan Family Court.
