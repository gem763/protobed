It has also admitted that further cuts are on the horizon - which means interest rates of near zero, and beyond. Here's what that means for the Australian economy.\n\nHow The RBA Rate Cut Will Affect Your Wallet On the first Tuesday of every month, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) decides if the cash rate will increase, decrease or should remain the same.
