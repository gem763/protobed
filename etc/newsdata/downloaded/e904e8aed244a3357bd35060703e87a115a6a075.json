He\u2019s the star guest on \u201cThis Week,\u201d \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d \u201cState of the Union,\u201d and \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d after what seemed \u2014 on the surface \u2014 like a slow, storm-dominated news week. Beneath the surface, though, various crises abroad are beginning to bubble:\n\n\u2014 North Korea is reportedly quietly perfecting its short-range missile arsenal while negotiations with the U.S. drag on, with Pompeo himself reportedly suspicious that he\u2019s being strung along;\n\n\u2014 Iran has just begun operating advanced uranium centrifuges in violation of Obama\u2019s nuclear deal, citing the fact that Trump breached it first;\n\n\u2014 A peace deal with the Taliban is at risk of falling apart after Pompeo rejected the terms, believing they\u2019re too favorable to the enemy;\n\n\u2014 There\u2019s no end in sight to the trade war with China, or to the upheaval in Hong Kong that may result in a Chinese invasion.\n\nPompeo\u2019s wrapped up in drama at home too. He keeps getting asked whether he\u2019s going to ditch the State Department in order to run for Senate in his home state of Kansas and he keeps being coy with his answers. A sudden vacuum at the top of the agency would add to State\u2019s burden in trying to manage the crises listed above. On top of all that, reports are circulating that his relationship with John Bolton has broken down, with Bolton effectively sidelined in the White House:\n\nWhile there\u2019s been friction between Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for months, as CNN first reported in May, things have gotten worse recently. Bolton and Pompeo rarely speak outside of formal meetings, three of the sources said, including a recent stretch of going weeks without speaking to one another. That has left key coordination efforts between the White House and State Department to underlings\u2026 The internal rift has only added to the sense of confusion about the administration\u2019s foreign policy priorities, and left some allies and experts scratching their heads about who is running Trump\u2019s policy abroad, according to diplomats and administration officials. \u201cThe administration\u2019s national security team is the weakest in decades and is now on the verge of complete collapse,\u201d said Tom Wright, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. \u201cMeanwhile, the President just goes rogue, making vital decisions on the fly, with little thought or process.\u201d\n\nPompeo will dutifully deny those rumors this morning, of course. Speaking of ducking questions, James Mattis will follow him on \u201cFace the Nation\u201d to discuss his new book and avoid saying when asked whether he thinks Trump is unfit for office. And if none of that grabs you, prospective Trump primary challenger Mark Sanford will appear on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d to address whether he\u2019ll enter the race or not. Joe Walsh used a Sunday-morning interview a few weeks ago to announce his own challenge to Trump. Today might be the day for Sanford.
