Except many of the women aren't expecting a child. (Photo: Better Business Bureau)\n\nThink of what a pleasant surprise it could be to get a bunch of gift cards in the mail and a clever greeting such as \"Holy guacamole! You going to avo a baby!\"\n\nAvo, like avocado, get it?\n\nExcept you're not even pregnant. And, no, you're not adopting a child. Frankly, there's no baby or baby bump in sight.\n\nYet several women across the country are getting odd envelopes in the mail congratulating them on their recent pregnancy, along with an array of gift cards and coupons for items for Mom and baby, according to recent alerts by the Better Business Bureau.\n\nThe greeting includes a nice little note from Jenny B. Lots of hearts, exclamation points, and cutesy cursive.\n\nExcept who is Jenny? And why is she so excited?\n\nWho is Jenny B.? And why is everyone getting the SAME EXACT cards filled with coupons and gift cards for expectant mothers. #JennyBpic.twitter.com/s6ICrBXoEG \u2014 Diane Caruso (@TheDianeCaruso) October 22, 2019\n\nWomen across the country and Canada are complaining about similar mailings. Even some younger men complained on social media that they are getting the greeting cards that show a guacamole with a heart in its belly.\n\nOne young woman at Temple University in Philadelphia recently posted on Twitter: \"Some lady named 'Jenny B' from Utah just sent this to me at my parents address ... nice Tuesday surprise phone call from my dad asking me if I'm pregnant. Ugh.\"\n\nToo much YouTube? Online video usage among teens is going through the roof, survey says\n\nHalloween costumes: 8 adorable and funny ways to dress up your pregnant bump\n\nWho is behind these cards?\n\nThe gift cards are associated with a variety of online businesses run by Mothers Lounge LLC based in Pleasant Grove, Utah, according to the BBB. Names include companies like Thoughtful Gift Cards and Canopy Couture. Online the website indicates Mother's Lounge was founded in September 2005 by Jenny Bosco and Kaleb Pierce.\n\n\"Jenny has a passion for trying to make mom's lives easier,\" the website states.\n\nYou might see gift cards relating to covers or canopies for a baby car seat or pregnancy pillows. The gift cards are for online-only stores that sell very specific items. And they're not going to be used easily.\n\n\"There isn't a return address on the envelope,\" said Laura Blankenship, director of marketing for the Better Business Bureau serving Eastern Michigan.\n\nIt almost looks like the return label fell off and the BBB speculates that it could be a marketing tactic to make you take a second look at the mailing.\n\nMany recipients aren't pregnant\n\nReports online indicate that women in Florida, Virginia, Ohio, Rhode Island, New York and elsewhere have been receiving the cards, too. Many aren't pregnant.\n\nThe envelope is often addressed by hand to appear that it's from a friend.\n\nSome friend. Consumers who were new mothers complained to the BBB that using the gift cards triggered exorbitant shipping charges for products that turned out to be of lower quality than expected.\n\n\"They give you a receipt and make it look like it's purchased,\" Blankenship said. But it's not a freebie. You can trigger other hidden fees.\n\ni have no idea who jenny b is but she just sent me $300 worth of baby-related gift cards! and now my dad thinks i\u2019m pregnant! pic.twitter.com/eSO4sClRFW \u2014 elise morgan (@crocfanpage) October 25, 2019\n\nBlankenship said she's not sure how the mailing list was generated but one woman who works at the BBB and is in her 20s received the mailing. She's not a mom or a mother-to-be.\n\nThe BBB said the business is using a marketing campaign that's confusing consumers at best. \"The price for a product or shipping should not be increased when a gift certificate is used,\" the BBB said.\n\nBest bet: Read the fine print for any fees, expiration dates and whether a gift card is only good in the store or just online.\n\nOh, it may not hurt to let your own family members know that a gal named Jenny B isn't even in the loop.\n\nContact Susan Tomporat 313-222-8876 or stompor@freepress.com.
