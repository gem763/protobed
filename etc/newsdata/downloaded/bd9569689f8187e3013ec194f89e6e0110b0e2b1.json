Starting at $3,499, it\u2019s not meant to be for everyone. And even if you\u2019re only interested in the primary selling point \u2014 the gorgeous monitor with its unique \u201czero-gravity\u201d sliding hinge \u2014 Microsoft won\u2019t sell it to you without the expensive PC parts as well.\n\nSo when I heard about a Kickstarter project from a small company called Sefree, with a pitch that basically amounts to a brazen but much cheaper Surface Studio knock-off plus an option for a standalone monitor version, I had to check it out. If the open-access Chinese supply chain can drive down prices on smartphones and laptops, why not ostentatious desktop PCs?\n\nThe Apollo, which starts at $1,499, is an all-in-one PC built around a 32-inch 4K touchscreen that slides down exactly like the Surface Studio. All models use an 8th Gen quad-core U-series Core i7 processor with various RAM, storage, and GPU options. I\u2019ve tested a pre-production model with an Nvidia GTX 1050Ti GPU, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD paired to 2TB of HDD storage.\n\nThere are 4 USB-A ports on the back, one more USB-C on the side, an Ethernet jack, and an HDMI output (not input). You get a bad plasticky mouse and keyboard in the box, as you\u2019d probably expect but not want. The monitor-only version, the Apollo Lite, costs $599 and uses a 27-inch 4K panel with the same sliding hinge.\n\nI was warned that the fit and finish on the prototype would not be awesome, and well, it was not. There were a couple of dents and dings in the case, and there\u2019s no way I could review this thing as a shipping product. But the two things that mattered, the hinge and the screen quality, were actually pretty on point.\n\nI found the hinge action to be very smooth throughout the 15-95-degree range, and the screen looks great, if a little overly glossy to my taste. The panel\u2019s casing is also impressively slim at just 11mm thick, though I would warn you that the rendered images on the Apollo\u2019s Kickstarter page seriously understate the size of the bezels. The live-action GIFs (like the one below) are accurate.\n\nThe Surface Studio uses a slightly smaller, higher-resolution screen that\u2019s shorter in the diagonal (28 inches) but with a taller 3:2 aspect ratio, similar to most other Surface devices. I like 3:2 on tablets and laptops, but the Apollo\u2019s 16:9 aspect ratio actually wasn\u2019t a problem for me given the large overall size \u2014 I didn\u2019t feel like I was compromising on vertical space. (The monitor-only Apollo Lite, which I haven\u2019t seen, is quite a bit smaller, so that might be a different story.)\n\nThe Apollo\u2019s casing isn\u2019t as sleek or slim as the Studio\u2019s, and it still gives off audible fan noise at all times, though I never found it to get particularly hot to the touch even under heavy load. I put the GPU through its paces with games like The Witcher 3 and Doom, both of which ran well at 1080p on medium-to-high settings. This isn\u2019t a PC that\u2019s really designed for high-end gaming, obviously, but you\u2019ll get better results than you would with the Nintendo Switch ports, at least on the $1,700 option with the GTX 1050Ti.\n\nThe Surface Studio is explicitly targeted at designers who\u2019ll use it with Microsoft\u2019s proprietary pen and dial tools, and the Apollo does ship with a generic-looking stylus, but you shouldn\u2019t expect the same level of performance here. Although I\u2019m not exactly the most demanding of stylus users, the Apollo clearly isn\u2019t as responsive as more integrated solutions out there on the market, with noticeable lag when drawing lines. The pen support is useful for things like retouching in Lightroom, but even I can tell that it won\u2019t be the best option for digital artists.\n\nIf you\u2019re enamored with the Surface Studio form factor in its own right rather than having any specific professional need, and if you don\u2019t have a good desktop setup right now, I can see why the Apollo would be an appealing option. The pricing is pretty good for what you get, assuming you need a large 4K monitor and find value in the hinge design. All-in-one PCs are never the most cost-effective option in terms of price-performance ratio, but the Surface Studio\u2019s ratio is a lot higher than this.\n\nOn the other hand, Microsoft is an infinitely bigger company with vast engineering resources and the ability to provide after-sales support. I personally would not recommend buying anything of this expense and complexity on Kickstarter from a company without a proven track record.\n\nThe Apollo campaign ends on Monday, but it\u2019s already funded, so we\u2019ll see if Sefree is able to deliver on final production in December. I\u2019d wait for impressions of retail products as to both whether the manufacturing has improved, and whether it even ships at all. This pre-production unit is the only Windows 10 computer I\u2019ve ever seen without a sleep mode. You should probably make sure the final version has that. (Or just wait and see if rumors of a standalone Studio-style monitor from Microsoft pan out.)\n\nBut what the Apollo does prove is that hey, it isn\u2019t impossible to make a cheaper Surface Studio. Maybe one day we\u2019ll get one.", "description": "The Apollo is a 32-inch 4K all-in-one with an obvious inspiration.
