How can we tell? Dividend paying companies with growing earnings can be highly rewarding in the long term. Unfortunately, it's common for investors to be enticed in by the seemingly attractive yield, and lose money when the company has to cut its dividend payments.\n\nWith Advanced Share Registry yielding 5.8% and having paid a dividend for over 10 years, many investors likely find the company quite interesting. We'd guess that plenty of investors have purchased it for the income. Some simple analysis can reduce the risk of holding Advanced Share Registry for its dividend, and we'll focus on the most important aspects below.\n\nExplore this interactive chart for our latest analysis on Advanced Share Registry!\n\nASX:ASW Historical Dividend Yield, October 15th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nCompanies (usually) pay dividends out of their earnings. If a company is paying more than it earns, the dividend might have to be cut. Comparing dividend payments to a company's net profit after tax is a simple way of reality-checking whether a dividend is sustainable. Advanced Share Registry paid out 115% of its profit as dividends, over the trailing twelve month period. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, from the perspective of an investor who hopes to own the company for many years, a payout ratio of above 100% is definitely a concern.\n\nConsider getting our latest analysis on Advanced Share Registry's financial position here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nOne of the major risks of relying on dividend income, is the potential for a company to struggle financially and cut its dividend. Not only is your income cut, but the value of your investment declines as well - nasty. Advanced Share Registry has been paying dividends for a long time, but for the purpose of this analysis, we only examine the past 10 years of payments. The dividend has been stable over the past 10 years, which is great. We think this could suggest some resilience to the business and its dividends. During the past ten-year period, the first annual payment was AU$0.02 in 2009, compared to AU$0.04 last year. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 7.2% a year over that time.\n\nCompanies like this, growing their dividend at a decent rate, can be very valuable over the long term, if the rate of growth can be maintained.\n\nDividend Growth Potential\n\nDividend payments have been consistent over the past few years, but we should always check if earnings per share (EPS) are growing, as this will help maintain the purchasing power of the dividend. Advanced Share Registry's earnings per share have been essentially flat over the past five years. Flat earnings per share are acceptable for a time, but over the long term, the purchasing power of the company's dividends could be eroded by inflation.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhen we look at a dividend stock, we need to form a judgement on whether the dividend will grow, if the company is able to maintain it in a wide range of economic circumstances, and if the dividend payout is sustainable. First, it's not great to see how much of its earnings are being paid as dividends. Second, earnings per share have actually shrunk, but at least the dividends have been relatively stable. To conclude, we've spotted a couple of potential concerns with Advanced Share Registry that may make it less than ideal candidate for dividend investors.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Is Advanced Share Registry Limited (ASX:ASW) a good dividend stock?
