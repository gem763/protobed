Emmer said in the announcement:\n\n\"Companies that have followed our current rules of the road, even if convoluted, deserve the certainty that they can offer their digital asset to the public and help contribute to a truly decentralized network. I am hopeful this non-partisan legislation will receive strong support and help ensure investment in the United States for these extraordinary technologies.\"\n\nIn July, Emmer reintroduced his Safe Harbor for Taxpayers with Forked Assets bill in the House of Representatives in order to foster blockchain industry growth in the U.S. by lessening the burden on businesses to figure out relevant tax laws. In Emmer\u2019s own words, \u201ctaxpayers can only comply with the law when the law is clear.\u201d\n\nQuestioning Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg\n\nLast week, the Minnesota republican questioned Mark Zuckerberg, who was testifying before the House Financial Services Committee on Facebook\u2019s Libra, asking him to explain the efforts made to engage the broader blockchain ecosystem in Libra\u2019s exploits. Zuckerberg put forward the shared control of the Libra Association and said he hoped that the association will work to educate the public about the industry.", "description": "United States Congressman Tom Emmer announced that he is introducing a new bill that can provide regulatory certainty for cryptocurrencies", "authors": ["Joeri Cant"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy8wNDA4MzZhNmM0M2QyYmI4YzBjNWNjN2ExYTA5MmI1Mi5qcGc=.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
