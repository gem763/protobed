Instead, he used the platform to evangelize for his favorite band, British glam-rock heroes Mott the Hoople. He even had Mott\u2019s singer, Ian Hunter, join Def Leppard for the 2019 Hall of Fame ceremony\u2019s finale performance of Mott\u2019s most famous song, the David Bowie-penned anthem \u201cAll the Young the Dudes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is our all-star jam\u2026 it's full circle,\u201d Elliott tells Yahoo Entertainment as he recalls his thoughts during the special Hall performance, which also included Brian May, Steven Van Zandt, the Zombies, and Susanna Hoffs. \u201cIt's the song that's really got me wanting to do all this, and now we're actually closing out our induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame \u2014 with that song. It's like licking the envelope, shut.\u201d\n\nYou could say Elliott is on a rock \u2018n\u2019 roll mission when it comes to Hoople and Hunter. \u201cIt became a mission. Yeah, I'm definitely on a mission,\u201d he asserts. \u201cI don't have to sit here and talk about me. Def Leppard takes care of itself. I'm happy to talk about it, but I'm not me, me, me, me, me. I'd rather talk about other bands.\u201d\n\nElliott, in fact, is talking about his other band, the supergroup Down \u2018n\u2019 Outz \u2014 which initially formed in 2009 specifically to open for a Mott the Hoople reunion concert at London\u2019s Hammersmith Apollo. The one-off event was so well-received that it turned into a full-fledged side-project, with the Down \u2018n\u2019 Outz \u2013 whose current lineup features Paul Guerin, Guy Griffin, and Keith Weir of the London Quireboys, Share Ross of Vixen, and esteemed veteran drummer Phil Martini \u2014 now releasing their third album (and first album of almost all original songs), This Is How We Roll.\n\n\u201cThe passion for Mott the Hoople came when I was 10,\u201d explains Elliott. \u201cI heard Ian sing a song called \u2018The Original Mixed Up Kid\u2019 on one of these compilation records, and I just totally fell in love with the story, the lyric, the voice. And then I realized he sounded a lot like Bob Dylan. But for some reason I hate Bob Dylan, but I love Ian Hunter's version of Bob Dylan. Ian was just Dylanesque \u2014 but better, I thought. And he just had this kind of loner vibe. There was something about him.\n\n\u201cIt was a great cacophony that [Mott] made; individually they weren't necessarily the best musicians in the world, but they made a hell of a sound. But the important thing was the songs were brilliant. They made great songs, and they made commentary five years before its time. A lot of people will hear a song like \u2018Violence\u2019 off the 1973 album and realize that he was actually talking about what would happen in London three years later when the punk movement started to kick off. \u2026 Rumor has it that when a young Freddie Mercury was watching Mott on tour, they were playing this song \u2018Marionette,\u2019 and because it's deemed a mini-opera, it's quite possible that \u2014 and even the guys in Queen said, \u2018Yeah, I can see that\u2019 \u2014 it was the inspiration behind \u2018Bohemian Rhapsody.\u2019 So there's a lot of leakage that went into the other stuff. But I can't really explain why I like Mott the Hoople, I just do. \u2026 For me, it was the melodies and the chills.\u201d\n\nElliott made it his mission even as a young boy to educate people about Mott the Hoople, but his classmates in native Sheffield, England, were unimpressed \u2014 until \u201cAll the Young Dudes\u201d came out.\n\n\u201cThe thing was, I'd been telling all these kids at school about Mott when they were still signed to Island Records, like, \u2018You\u2019re missing out on this thing!\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cAnd then, unbeknownst to us as it'd been going on under the radar, [Mott the Hoople] had moved over to [Tony] DeVries [David Bowie\u2019s manager]. Bowie had given him their song, they recorded \u2018All the Young Dudes,\u2019 and all of a sudden, the whole world changed. Everybody's world changed. You can have this conversation with Morrissey, Boy George, Duran Duran, me, half the punk bands on the planet. When they heard \u2018All The Young Dudes,\u2019 it was a wakeup call: \u2018There is something for us out there.\u2019 \u2026 As a 12-year-old, when I first heard \u2018All the Young Dudes,\u2019 that and T. Rex\u2019s Electric Warrior a year before set me on my path.\u201d (Incidentally, if Elliott could root for any other artist besides Mott to get into the Rock Hall, it\u2019d be Marc Bolan and T. Rex.)", "description": "\u201cJust because they didn't sell gazillion records in America, they've still got value.\u201d", "authors": ["Lyndsey Parker", "Editor-In-Chief"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/CMzSrJXg.2.Itm17o4OCkw--~B/aD0yNTkyO3c9Mzg4ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/0c0af050-e6ea-11e9-bfe5-347c4dbc3aa7", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
