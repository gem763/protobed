REUTERS/Joshua Lott\n\nWarren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts and former teacher, joined a crowd of hundreds of teachers and parents outside an elementary school to back the Chicago teachers\u2019 demands for more resources, and promised to boost funding for U.S. public schools if elected president in 2020.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here to stand with every one of the people who stand for our children every day,\u201d Warren said to applause.\n\nThe teachers union called the work stoppage last week after contract negotiations failed to produce a deal on pay, overcrowding in schools and a lack of support staff such as nurses and social workers.\n\nAbout 300,000 students have been out of school since Thursday when the system\u2019s 25,000 teachers went on strike.\n\nWarren, a leading progressive, is one of the top Democratic candidates seeking her party\u2019s nomination to face Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election.\n\nHer campaign proposals include making an $800 billion investment in public schools and canceling all student loan debt.\n\nSergio Criollo, a bilingual teacher who attended the rally, said he was encouraged by Warren\u2019s appearance.\n\n\u201cThe fact that presidential candidates are seeing what we are doing, hopefully we will create a movement here in Illinois and other states,\u201d Criollo said.\n\nThe strike is the latest in a wave of work stoppages in U.S. school districts, in which demands for resources have superseded calls for higher salaries and benefits. In Chicago and elsewhere, teachers have emphasized the need to help underfunded schools, framing their demands as a call for social justice.\n\nOn Tuesday, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said she was frustrated that part of the teachers union bargaining team was taking the day off from negotiations to participate in rallies. She has called for the union to end the strike and make a deal with the Chicago Public Schools (CPS).\n\n\u201cThere should be a sense of urgency,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have been making progress, not enough, not fast enough.\u201d\n\nUPDATED PROPOSALS\n\nLater in the day, CPS Chief Executive Janice Jackson said classes were canceled for a fifth day as negotiators were unable to reach a deal. She said CPS had put updated class-size and support-staff proposals on the bargaining table.\n\n\u201cThe offer not only reflects CPS\u2019 and CTU\u2019s shared vision of equity and prioritizes supports for our highest need schools first; it also protects our students\u2019 academic progress by ensuring the district\u2019s long-term financial stability,\u201d she said.\n\nChicago Teachers Union President Jesse Sharkey said the CPS proposals only addressed a small percentage of overcrowded classes and that the support-staff proposals did not adequately meet the needs of the district.\n\nSlideshow (14 Images)\n\nLightfoot, who was elected in April, said the district offered a raise for teachers of 16% over five years but could not afford the union\u2019s full demands, which would cost an extra $2.4 billion annually.\n\nWith no end to negotiations in sight, teachers were planning to rally in downtown Chicago during rush hour on Wednesday morning.\n\nAlthough the latest work stoppage has forced officials to cancel classes and sports events, school buildings are staying open for children in need of a place to go.", "description": "U.S. Democratic presidential contender Elizabeth Warren rallied with striking Chicago teachers on Tuesday, expressing support for the union's demands before the country's third-largest school system canceled classes for a fifth day.", "authors": ["Brendan O", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191022&t=2&i=1443800722&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9L1IV", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
