At the moment, we are not remotely on track to meet that target. We need to act urgently and ambitiously, which will require building diverse coalitions of political support.\n\nThat\u2019s why I am announcing a new proposal designed to rapidly phase out gas-powered vehicles and replace them with zero-emission, or \u201cclean,\u201d vehicles like electric cars. The goal of the plan, which also aims to spur a transformation in American manufacturing, is that by 2040 all vehicles on the road should be clean.\n\nWhat distinguishes this proposal is not only its scale but also its ability to unite the American environmental movement, the American labor movement and large automakers. It has already earned the support of climate groups like the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the League of Conservation Voters; labor unions like the United Automobile Workers and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; and car manufacturers like Ford and General Motors.\n\nHow would the plan work? First, it would give you a large discount on an American-made electric vehicle when you trade in a gas-powered car. Lower-income Americans could get an even bigger discount on a new vehicle or a discount on a used electric vehicle. In total, these discounts should result in 63 million fewer gas-powered cars on the road by 2030 and put America on a path to having 100 percent of new car sales be clean.", "description": "I have a proposal that is supported not just by environmentalists but also by labor and large automakers.", "authors": ["Chuck Schumer"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/24/opinion/24schumer/24schumer-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
