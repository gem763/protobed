The document, prepared by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), said world governments would need to take \u201cunprecedented\u201d action to reduce carbon emissions to stave off the worst effects of global warming.\n\n\u201cI am submitting this report as my testimony because I don\u2019t want you to listen to me, I want you to listen to the scientists,\u201d Thunberg said. \u201cI want you to unite behind science. And then I want you to take real action. Thank you.\u201d\n\nThunberg was joined by her fellow young climate activists Jamie Margolin, a co-founder of the Zero Hour youth climate campaign, Vic Barrett of Alliance for Climate Education, and Benji Backer of the American Conservation Coalition.\n\n\u201cMy generation has been committed to a planet that is collapsing,\u201d Margolin said. \u201cYouth climate activism should not have to exist.\u201d\n\nHer testimony came shortly after the Trump administration announced it would move to revoke California\u2019s ability to require stricter auto emissions standards. The pollution generated by automobiles is known to be a significant contributor to the planet\u2019s warming.\n\n[Teen activist Greta Thunberg takes her youth climate campaign to Washington]\n\nIn the course of a year, Thunberg has become one of the most prominent faces in a youth-led movement urging action in the face of a looming climate catastrophe, and her testimony was part of a busy Washington itinerary. On Monday, she met with former president Barack Obama, who called her \u201cone of our planet\u2019s greatest advocates.\u201d After her Wednesday testimony, Thunberg said she would swing by the Supreme Court to support a group taking legal action on climate change, before heading back across the street to appear before the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nOn Friday, Thunberg will lead an international day of youth climate protests from a march in New York City.\n\nOn my way to Capitol Hill. At 10h we\u2019ll testify at The House Committee on Foreign Affairs. At 12h I will support Our Children's Trust at the Supreme Court. Then at 17h ET I will address Members of Congress in the Ways & Means Committee Hearing Room. #UniteBehindTheScience pic.twitter.com/YRgbykuvWa \u2014 Greta Thunberg (@GretaThunberg) September 18, 2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to make as much difference as I can, especially in informing people, spreading awareness about the climate crisis,\u201d Thunberg told The Washington Post ahead of her D.C. trip. \u201cI think that is the key now, to inform people about this crisis. Because as it is, people are not aware.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce enough people know about the urgency, then they will go together and push for political change,\u201d she said.\n\nThunberg is not alone.\n\nA Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that a majority of American teens believe climate change is real and fear it will have a negative impact on their future. And about 1 in 4 has taken some sort of action, including attending a walkout, protesting or contacting their lawmakers.\n\nSarah Kaplan and Brady Dennis contributed to this report.\n\nRead more:\n\nExtreme climate change has already arrived in America\n\nFive takeaways from The Post\u2019s analysis of warming climates in the United States", "description": "Rather than give a typical testimony, she demanded lawmakers read a landmark U.N. climate change report.", "authors": ["Kayla Epstein", "Embedded Audience Editor On The National Desk", "September At Pm", "Kayla Epstein Is The Social Media Editor For National At The Washington Post.
