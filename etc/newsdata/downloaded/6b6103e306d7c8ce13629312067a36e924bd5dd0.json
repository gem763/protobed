Widebody jets, with more premium seats, tend to have higher margins for airlines.\n\nJust last week Delta pledged to buy 14 more A350s as part of a strategy to grow in Latin America through the acquisition of a 20% stake in LATAM Airlines Group (LTM.SN).\n\nAmerican Airlines Group (AAL.O) and Alaska Air Group (ALK.N) also have Airbus orders, as do lessors like Air Lease Corp (AL.N).\n\nMost aircraft leases place the burden of taxes, maintenance and insurance on the operator, Macquarie analyst Sarah Stein said, but noted \u201cit is unclear as to how far reaching the definition of taxes are in lease agreements in a unique scenario such as this one.\u201d\n\nThe head of Ireland\u2019s Ryanair (RYA.I) urged the United States and European Union to pull back from a tariff war over aircraft subsidies and said he would ask Boeing to \u201ceat\u201d any counter-tariffs imposed on the U.S. firm by the EU.", "description": "U.S. airlines are scrambling to digest a new 10% tariff on European-made Airbus planes that threaten additional havoc in an aircraft supply market already reeling from frozen deliveries of Boeing Co's 737 MAX.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Tracy Rucinski", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1437087433&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9319R-OCABS", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
