It\u2019s not a matter of having \u201cgone through the motions\u201d of your training. But when you add stress to what you do, what happens? (This is a huge issue within the church, especially when you work outside of your God-given talents.)\n\nAs I have written in my book, experience is better than training; training is better than knowledge; knowledge is better than ignorance (even Hosea talks about people having a lack of knowledge, Hos 4:6, the lack of knowledge leads to a lack of prosperity). My good friend, 15-year former Navy SEAL Jimmy Graham and his Able Shepherd program is a case in point. He has pointed out in numerous training discussions that first responders write down what they intend to do in policy and procedure manuals. But their training is not truth until it is tested again and again in a \u201creal world\u201d experience. When it is trained and ingrained as habits, it\u2019s no longer a plan; it\u2019s a practice.\n\nRemember your training!\n\nGraham shared stories testing various first responder \u201ctabletop\u201d training scenarios in \u201creal-time.\u201d Their exercises followed their written plans \u201con the front line\u201d and under stress, but then fix the errors and holes which showed up. As a SEAL instructor, you don\u2019t just go through the motions. You train to include lots of stress to reveal weaknesses in both their training content and in their people, then you fix both. SEALs train so they react with muscle memory rather than having to \u201cthink\u201d about what they\u2019re doing. Their training becomes the military\u2019s axiom, \u201cThe more you sweat in training, the less you bleed in combat.\u201d\n\nAlso, most veterans have come to understand, \u201cNo battle plan survives contact with the enemy.\u201d This quote is from Helmuth von Moltke the Elder, the Chief of Staff of the Prussian army before World War One. This principle also has an economic and business crossover, too, \u201cNo business plan survives first contact with customers.\u201d The principles of change and adaptability are ingrained in our current military. Listen to Andy Stumpf and Jock Willink talk about Navy SEAL training. Not only about the time it takes to become \u201cqualified\u201d on the SEAL Teams but also how SEAL training has evolved and improved over time.\n\nA SEAL\u2019s mindset is their primary source of change, but has the church become too soft?\n\nI have been to churches which allow, even promote, coffee during sermons and people merely wander in whatever time they feel like it. It\u2019s all friendly and warm and welcoming, but\u2026 where\u2019s the training and discipleship? At the church I attended in my twenties, we took three years to go through the book of Ephesians, each of us taking copious notes. Why don't today\u2019s churches train with a similar mindset and focus? It\u2019s as if the church is following the \u201cparticipation trophy\u201d route, yet we\u2019re told to \u201cput on the full armor of God\u201d (Eph 6:13) and have the \u201cfruit of the spirit\u201d (Gal 5:22). How can you \u201cremember your training\u201d when there is little to no training, including Business As Mission training? We\u2019re talking Biblical t-r-a-i-n-i-n-g toward maturity!\n\nREAD: Christian 'Gray Heads' Need To Transfer Wisdom To Next Generation, Not Just Wealth\n\nIn today\u2019s social media and even narcissistic craze, we\u2019ve lost some of our moral character, which is composed of two things: strength and morality. The style of character has become more important than the substance of character. Morality is about decency, self-responsibility, generosity, and a proper set of values, not someone who is self-obsessed. Morality is dedication to your training of \u201ceverything is everyone\u2019s job.\u201d And training begins with character.[1] The church body needs to be just that, a healthy body called to do all things it is tasked to do by God.\n\nFirst, in the church, there is little to no Business As Mission and how we\u2019re to influence the marketplace. Secondly, there are few discussions about how we are to turn and apply our Sunday talk into a Monday walk? Many churches want to make us feel good on Sunday, but we need to translate that feel good into do good Monday through Saturday. Thirdly, the whole church needs help, from the filthy to the wealthy. The church needs a culture shift to help everyone because the church is missing out on its complete mission for God\u2019s Kingdom.\n\nA military mission has five steps: 1) Planning, 2) Training, 3) Operations, 4) Maintenance, and the ever-present 5) After Action Report (AAR) to assess what are the lessons learned, both good and bad, and build on what you have achieved. Or, to put it into Biblical terms, the five steps encapsulate our faith plus works in our lives. We need to train in the Great Commandment which turns into the Great Commission, but we lack the next step and turn the Great Commission into the Great Transmission. Transmitting our faith into actions, converting our Sunday talk into Monday walk in the marketplace. The marketplace is where we will have our most significant impact for the Kingdom.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just transmitting and converting our faith into works; we need realistic Biblical marketplace training. Why?\n\nA few years ago in California, a police officer got killed in a shootout while trying to reload his gun. He couldn\u2019t reload quickly enough because his hands were full of empty shells. As he\u2019d been shooting, he\u2019d been picking up his shells. He\u2019d been trained at the police firing range always to pick up his shells as he shot. Why? It kept the range clean.[2]\n\nThe church seems to be training the same way, an attitude and tradition of \u201ckeep the range clean\u201d rather than having realistic training.\n\nWhen will church leaders be able to tell us, \u201cRemember your training,\u201d when they haven\u2019t had any or much quality training to put into practice?\n\nI\u2019m not waiting; I\u2019m training. You?\n\nLuke 6:40 AMPC A pupil is not superior to his teacher, but everyone [when he is] completely trained (readjusted, restored, set to rights, and perfected) will be like his teacher.\n\n[1] See The Rogue Warrior\u2019s Strategy for Success by Richard Markinko, chapter three.", "description": "For veterans, every military drill instructor, instructor, leader, and trainer .09/02/2019 3:01:50AM EST.", "authors": ["Kevin Cullis", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/309/62938068-39cc-4af2-b63c-a7ee0ff3b4f0.jpg"}
