I told him I wasn\u2019t interested but when he told me the groom was 15 years old and the bride was one year younger than him, I rushed to the location immediately.\n\nAfter arriving I saw people celebrating in the street not far from the border between Israel and the northern Gaza Strip. Among them was a young Palestinian boy being carried on the shoulders of relatives and friends. I couldn\u2019t believe that the boy was the groom until I asked him and he replied with a smile, \u201cyes I am.\"\n\nAfter he finished celebrating at a party held a day before the official wedding, he went to play with friends in the street where they enjoyed flavoured frozen drinks.\n\nThe second day I went back and continued covering the story, the official wedding was to take place that day. I was surprised when I saw the groom\u2019s mother helping him put on his wedding suit. I couldn\u2019t avoid thinking that it looked as if she was dressing him for school. After that he started combing his hair using a broken piece of a mirror.\n\nI realised how poor the family was when I noticed that him and his wife share the three room house with the rest of the family, another nine people.\n\nI asked the young groom if I could go with him into the house where the bride was getting prepared. When we entered the house, which was only next door, I realised that the family had not yet repaired the damage that was caused from an Israeli strike in 2009. When young Soboh looked at his bride and saw she was veiled, his face became frank and serious. At that moment the bride spoke to her groom and said, \u201clets smile and have our photo taken.\" One thing she forgot to do before posing for the photograph was to remove her veil.", "description": "Young Palestinian groom Ahmed Soboh, 15, and his bride Tala, 14, stand inside Tala's house during their wedding party in the town of Beit Lahiya, near the border between Israel and the northern Gaza Strip.", "authors": ["Mohammed Salem"], "top_image": "https://photos.wi.gcs.trstatic.net/WBTnOVC7qqta06gXHeKsQ7XRHQmQMJU0KNT5XuVFbL2arTgyi1e0_nvu2lJz1aCBpUmcg7rWsiDJktLU2GQqnU7RqxwYmnGdMsJBfsx1U5poOqoBbjfGP48UnSZyqPMg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
