Camila wore the Reformation Lacey dress for the occasion, which retails for $248, comes with a daring leg slit that climbs up the thigh, and, frankly, is sophisticated enough to wear to a Fall wedding. It's also very '90s. I could see Rachel Green wearing it with strappy black shoes for a date night on Friends, couldn't you?\n\nThe romantic pouf sleeves and floral print make this look ultraflattering and feminine on Camila. The singer styled it with neutral block-heel sandals, hoop earrings, and a thick black choker, just in case you forgot which decade she's currently channeling. Meanwhile, Shawn was just in a t-shirt and jeans, but Camila was definitely dressed up for the day out.\n\nAt this point in my relationship, I'm so relaxed that I probably wouldn't change out of my pajamas for such events, but hey, maybe if I had Camila's Ref number hanging in my closet, I'd go the extra mile. She's officially on my mood board, after all. Keep reading for another glimpse of the couple, then shop Camila's exact design, along with similar options if you prefer slight tweaks, like a less sultry cut or different neckline.\n\nRelated: Camila Cabello's VMAs Gown Looks So Angelic, Until You See Those Cutouts", "description": "Camila Cabello and her boyfriend Shawn Mendes enjoyed the day in West Hollywood - holding hands, stopping for coffee, and looking adorable per usual.
