Washington has labelled the IRGC a \"terror\" group.\n\n190921110344031\n\nHowever, the UAE itself never publicly blamed Tehran.\n\nLast month, Abu Dhabi welcomed an initiative by European leaders to ease tension with Iran and open a diplomatic path.\n\n\"With persistence, the E3 [Britian, France and Germany] can open up a new channel of communication and establish greater trust,\" Gargash wrote in the Financial Times.\n\n\"The UAE, Iran and other states can share the Gulf as normal neighbours, if not as the best of friends.\"\n\nSaudi-Iran mediation\n\nZayed's mission comes amid a number of backchannel efforts to facilitate a dialogue between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n\nAccording to the MEE, an official in the Iraqi prime minister's office, Abbas al-Hasnawi confirmed that Iraqi Prime Minister Abdul Mahdi was mediating between Riyadh and Tehran.\n\nPakistani Prime minister Imran Khan also visited Tehran on Sunday as part of the efforts to ease tensions in the region.\n\nKhan met Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in the first leg of his tour that also includes a stop in Saudi Arabia.\n\n\"The reason for this trip is that we do not want a conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran,\" Khan told reporters as he stood alongside Rouhani.\n\nEmphasising the visit to the two countries were Pakistan's \"initiative\", he said: \"We recognise that it's a complex issue ... but we feel that this can be resolved through dialogue. But what should never happen, is war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.\"\n\nSaudi Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel al-Jubeir said on Sunday that Riyadh had not asked Islamabad to mediate.\n\nAl Jazeera's Assed Baig, reporting from Tehran, said it was uncertain as to how Iran and Saudi Arabia will move forward, given their differences on other regional issues, including the war in Yemen where they support different parties.\n\n\"Tensions are still high. It's massive task ahead of them,\" said Baig, adding: \"[Rouhani] said that there should be an end to the war in Yemen...he said there should be an immediate ceasefire and humanitarian assistance.\"\n\nOn Friday, an Iranian tanker came under attack off Saudi coast in Red Sea, raising new fears of escalation.\n\nKhan, who is expected to arrive in Saudi later this week, will have an upheal task, as Riyadh has been warming up to Tehran's foes - Israel and the US.
