The gunmen are still at large.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that the shooting stemmed from an earlier altercation at the private club-like bar after which the two gunmen reportedly returned with weapons. Local media reported early on that the shooter or shooters walked into the popular tequila bar on 10th and Central Ave. and opened fire.\n\nTomasic told reporters at the scene that there were about 40 people in the bar at the time of the shooting, and that many of them left a trail of blood as they escaped. He told reporters, including the Associated Press, that a clear picture had not yet emerged. \u201cObviously being a bar at 1:30, stories vary a lot,\u201d he said, according to the A.P.\n\nTomasic earlier told CNN that police arrived to find four dead people inside the bar but that they did not have an accurate description of the suspects. \u201cWe do not have a good enough description yet, to put anything out for a suspect, or suspects, we don\u2019t even know how many,\u201d he said.\n\nThe five injured people are reportedly in stable condition. The victims were all men, ranging from their mid-20s to mid-50s.\n\nOn Sunday, the Kansas City division of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives tweeted that they were also involved in the investigation to find the perpetrators.\n\nThis story is developing.", "description": "Police are looking for two suspects who are still at large after opening fire in the Tequila KC Bar in downtown Kansas City, Kansas, around 1:30 a.m.", "authors": ["Barbie Latza Nadeau"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_3383,w_6016,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570355771/RTS1OH73_jvefgk", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
