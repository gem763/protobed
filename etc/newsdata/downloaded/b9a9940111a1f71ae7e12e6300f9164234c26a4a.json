Turkey's offensive sparked condemnation from many other NATO members and the European Union.\n\nKramp-Karrenbauer proposed the establishment of an international security zone in northern Syria, but the plan ran into resistance both at home and among her NATO colleagues at a meeting of alliance defense ministers in Brussels.\n\nAmong the questions left unanswered by Kramp-Karrenbauer's plan are whether the United Nations would grant a mandate for a force to patrol such a safety zone, whether Germany itself would participate and which other countries might contribute troops.\n\n\u00c7avu\u015fo\u011flu said Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan had proposed an idea of an internationally protected safe zone in Syria about eight or nine years ago, but the offer was rejected by Germany and the U.S., Bloomberg reported.\n\nErdo\u011fan said Saturday that his country will make sure the Syrian Kurdish militia YPG moves from the Turkish-Syrian border if Russia does not take care of it, Reuters reported.\n\nIn the so-called Sochi deal, Erdo\u011fan and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed Turkey would halt its offensive in return for the withdrawal of Kurdish forces to 30km south of the Turkish border. \u201cIf this area is not cleared from terrorists at the end of the 150 hours [of ceasefire], then we will handle the situation by ourselves and will do all the cleansing work,\u201d Erdo\u011fan said in a speech in Istanbul.\n\nMeanwhile, Erdo\u011fan should be investigated and indicted for war crimes over his country\u2019s military offensive in Syria, according to a former member of the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria.\n\nCarla del Ponte, a former Swiss attorney general who prosecuted war crimes in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, said \"for Erdo\u011fan to be able to invade Syrian territory to destroy the Kurds is unbelievable.\"\n\nAccording to Reuters, she told the Swiss newspaper Schweiz am Wochenende: \u201cAn investigation should be opened into him and he should be charged with war crimes. He should not be allowed to get away with this scot free.\u201d", "description": "Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer\u2019s plan has run into resistance both at home and amid NATO members.", "authors": ["Laura Kayali", "Hans Von Der Burchard", "Zia Weise"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1178237837-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
