Kamala D. Harris on Wednesday rolled out a $10 trillion plan to tackle climate change that sets a goal of exceeding targets laid out by the Paris Agreement and achieving a \u201cclean\u201d economy by 2045.\n\n\u201cClimate change is an existential threat to our species, and the United States must lead the world with bold action to safeguard our future and protect our planet,\u201d said Ms. Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate from California. \u201cThe Trump administration is pushing science fiction, not science fact, putting our health and economy at risk.\u201d\n\nMs. Harris wants the U.S to be running on 100% carbon-neutral electricity and all new buses, heavy-duty vehicles, and vehicle fleets to be zero-emission by 2030.\n\nThat\u2019s a more aggressive timeline than the plan of Democratic presidential rival Pete Buttigieg, who also announced his proposal to tackle climate change on Wednesday. The South Bend, Indiana, mayor set targets of a zero-emission electricity system by 2035 and net-zero emissions for all new heavy-duty vehicles by 2040.\n\nMs. Harris\u2018 plan would also require new buildings to be \u201ccarbon-neutral\u201d by 2030.\n\nHer plan also envisioned passing legislation she recently unveiled with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York that would require environmental and climate-related legislation to receive an \u201cequity\u201d score that estimates its effect on \u201cfrontline\u201d communities most affected by climate change, among other priorities.\n\nShe would also invest $250 billion over five years to repair drinking water infrastructure in the country, end federal subsidies for the fossil fuel industry, and crack down on polluters through fines and enforcement action.\n\nMs. Harris would also move to halt fossil fuel development on public lands and protect 30% of U.S. land and ocean by 2030.\n\nMs. Harris, Mr. Buttigieg and other presidential contenders have been releasing their plans to tackle climate change, which has been a central issue in the 2020 race, ahead of a \u201cclimate crisis\u201d town hall in New York on Wednesday hosted by CNN.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
