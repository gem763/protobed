We were bigger fans of the 2018 update, which amped up performance while also improving battery life and making the 4K display standard. But we felt the trackpad was awfully small and didn't like that the fingerprint reader and power button were separate.\n\nNow we're working with the 2019 model, and it brings a whole new design along with some faster internals and extras like clever port placement and a hardware webcam kill switch. At its heart, the 2019 HP Spectre 15 x360 still seeks to accomplish the same things as its predecessors. It's an eye-catching (if a bit bulky) convertible packed with most of the features creatives and heavy consumers of media are looking for.\n\nDo the 2019 updates solve some of the quibbles we had in prior years? After some recent testing, we can confidently say the HP Spectre 15 x360 remains a good laptop\u2014but its unusual design could be alienating if you're just looking for something simple.\n\nSpecifications\n\nSpecs at a glance: HP Spectre x360 15 Model Worst Best As Reviewed Screen 15.6-inch 3840 \u00d7 2160 WLED touchscreen OS Windows 10 Home 64 CPU Intel Core i7-8750H (6-core, 2.2GHz up to 4.1GHz) RAM 8GB DDR4 RAM 16GB DDR4 RAM 16GB DDR4 RAM Storage 256GB PCIe SSD 2TB PCIe SSD 1TB PCIe SSD GPU Intel UHD Graphics 630 + Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050Ti 4GB Networking Intel 802.11b/g/n/ac (2\u00d72) Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5 combo (MU-MIMO supported) Ports 1 USB-C 3.1, 1 USB-A 3.1, 1 HDMI 2.0, 1 Thunderbolt 3, 3.5mm headphone jack, microSD slot Size 0.76 \u00d7 14,22 \u00d7 9.84 inches Weight 4.8 pounds Battery 6-cell, 84 Wh lithium-ion battery Warranty 1 year; optional 2- and 3-year protection plans Price $1,499 $2,419 $2,049 Other perks Fingerprint reader, webcam with privacy switch, active pen\n\nHP Spectre x360 15t Touch Buy Now (Ars Technica may earn compensation for sales from links on this post through affiliate programs .)\n\nThe 2019 HP Spectre 15 x360 is a notable bump over its predecessor when it comes to specs. All configurations now include a six-core Intel Core i7-8750H processor with integrated Intel UHD 630 graphics. That's up from four cores in the previous model.\n\nThey also include Nvidia's GeForce GTX 1050Ti discrete GPU with 4GB of video memory, which is good enough to edit 4K video and play modern computer games. As stated previously, HP pitches this laptop as an option for creatives, but this isn't a workstation GPU. That distinction would only matter to a select few professionals, though.\n\nLast year, HP made the 4K 15.6-inch WLED touchscreen display standard. That returns here. The screen doesn't appear to have changed, and it's still a good display, albeit a bit dark\u2014we measured the brightness at around 300 nits, which is much lower than you'll see on competing laptops like the Dell XPS 15. That's a perplexing letdown for a laptop made for media creation and consumption. Nevertheless, the display is sharp and the colors look good.\n\nHP doesn't make any claims about P3 or sRGB colorspace coverage\u2014but again, this isn't a professional workstation, it's a personal machine. For that, the screen is good enough. We've just seen better.\n\nThe laptop comes with 8GB DDR4 RAM standard, and you can upgrade to 16GB. Either should be sufficient for most use cases for this laptop. There's a wide range of storage options, and given that it's solid state, this is the configuration option that can ramp up the price. Configurations start at 256GB but go as high as 2TB. Our review unit had 1TB, which, while pricy, seems appropriate for a media laptop these days\u2014but most people could likely get by with the 512GB option.\n\nOther specs of note include 802.11b/g/n/ac (2\u00d72) Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5, a front-facing camera, a fingerprint reader, and a six-cell, 84Wh lithium-ion battery.\n\nDesign\n\nThe first thing you'll notice when unboxing this laptop is its unusual aesthetic. HP calls it a \"gem-cut\" look\u2014the angles on the edges resemble the clean, geometric corners and sides of a gemstone, supposedly. It has a dramatic effect. It looks \"polygonal,\" for lack of a better term. If you want something eye-catching, it does that well.\n\nThe combination of the \"gem-cut\" appearance and the shiny, attention-grabbing copper or brass accents do give it a certain Vegas-style, over-the-top vibe that won't work for everyone. I find it a bit much, to be frank, but that's purely personal. Many other people are going to love it. I just liked the old look a little better, as I appreciated the accents in last year's models very much and didn't feel more was needed to get the point across.\n\nThat said, the materials don't feel cheap at all, which helps. If you're the sort to want your computer to look and feel \"premium,\" this convertible delivers.\n\nThe backlit keyboard is similar to last year's model, and it's still solid. It's a chiclet keyboard with 1.5mm of key travel. It has a full numeric keypad, which will appeal to some users but not to others. I feel that squeezing numpads into 15-inch laptops makes the keyboards cramped. But then, I rarely if ever use the numpad even if I have it. For other people, a numpad is essential, and it's clearly a welcome inclusion in that scenario.\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nSamuel Axon\n\nThe trackpad is similar to the one in 2018's model, and it's fine. It still feels a little cramped to me\u2014that was one of Ars' Valentina Palladino's main criticisms last year\u2014but not everyone likes giant trackpads.\n\nWith dimensions of 0.76\u00d714,22\u00d79.84 inches and a weight of 4.8 pounds, this convertible is a bit too bulky to comfortably use as a tablet. Most 15-inch convertibles have this problem, though. I also feel the bezels are rather large\u2014primarily the bottom. HP says they're 11.9-percent narrower overall than last year's Spectre 15 x360, though.", "description": "The \"gem-cut\" design isn't for everybody, but it sure is striking.", "authors": ["Samuel Axon"], "top_image": "https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/HP-x360-Spectre-15-angle-760x380.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-05-10"}
