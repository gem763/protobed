In February 2018, a federal judge said the 3LW songwriters who brought the claim, Sean Hall and Nathan Butler, did not have creative ownership over the phrases, which were deemed to be commonplace. \u201cBy 2001, American popular culture was heavily steeped in the concepts of players, haters, and player haters,\u201d judge Michael Fitzgerald wrote. \u201cThe concept of actors acting in accordance with their essential nature is not at all creative; it is banal.\u201d\n\nBut the successful appeal found that Fitzgerald should not have had the sole final judgment on the originality of the song. The decision will now be made by a jury.\n\nPlagiarism claims have been made against numerous high-profile songs recently, with the latest case in the US being Truth Hurts, a song by singer and rapper Lizzo that spent seven weeks at No 1. Brothers Justin and Jeremy Raisen allege that they co-wrote the song and filed a lawsuit against Lizzo; she has countersued, saying the men \u201cdid not help me write any part of the song\u201d. She did add British singer Mina Lionness to the songwriting credits, acknowledging that a viral tweet Lionness wrote was used for the song\u2019s opening line.", "description": "Swift and two other songwriters are accused of taking lyrics from a song by girl group 3LW for her hit Shake It Off", "authors": ["Ben Beaumont-Thomas"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ead272dd7a758598bb9779138ee491de37d09c6e/0_43_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1c36fa438fd5897f2d6813f8f21145e7", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
