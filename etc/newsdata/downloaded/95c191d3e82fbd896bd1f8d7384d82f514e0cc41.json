In June this year, 10 prisoners were killed in a bloody riot involving PCC members. Just last week, the security chief of a jail in the region of Itap\u00faa was taken captive by PCC prisoners.\n\nAs they expand their reach across the border, the Brazilian cartels have largely outgunned Paraguayan groups to take control of the country\u2019s booming drug trade, employing aggressive recruitment strategies \u2013 especially within jails \u2013 to rapidly expand membership.\n\nParaguayan authorities have considered a range of responses, including the construction of specialised jails for cartel members.\n\nBut opposition senator Jorge Querey said Paraguay needed a much more profound reckoning. Since its return to democracy in 1989, Paraguay has not managed to strengthen its public institutions, giving great advantages to criminal groups both outside and inside of prisons, he said.\n\n\u201cAt present, we have a ministry of national affairs and a national police force that are highly penetrated by corruption and have even become components of organised crime,\u201d he said.\n\nIn Paraguay's remote north guerrillas are still at large, armed and dangerous Read more\n\nVidal Acevedo, of the NGO Service for Peace and Justice, said the employment of the armed forces represented a dire threat to citizens\u2019 human rights, pointing to a recent report demonstrated that the deployment of the military against the leftist guerrilla group the Paraguayan People\u2019s Army has already produced widespread human rights violations.\n\nAcevedo also said that the militarisation of anti-crime policy in other Latin American countries such as Mexico and Brazil had only led to more violence, and argued that Paraguay should concentrate on reforming and equipping its police forces.\n\nSuch shortcomings were clearly illustrated on Wednesday: while the gunmen who freed Samudio were equipped with assault rifles and bulletproof vests, police officers had minimal equipment and had not been informed of the danger represented by the Comando Vermelho leader in their midst.", "description": "President\u2019s announcement prompts concerns for civil liberties in a country which only emerged from military rule in 1989", "authors": ["Will Costa In Asunci\u00f3n"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5b9c0d86514d48e038c96044f1f3927ffb8d670/0_110_2046_1228/master/2046.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=8a386f1e0f1a45bf49bef7a75fc1c8ff"}
