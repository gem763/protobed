How liberal pessimism could return Trump to the White House | Emma Brockes", "language": "en", "text": "Elizabeth Warren was in New York this week, on the stump in front of large crowds in Washington Square Park. The contender for the Democratic party presidential nomination talked about corruption in the White House and the need for sweeping, dramatic change; she repeated her proposal, if elected, to impose a 2% tax on the country\u2019s highest earners and she namechecked an early-20th-century labour movement spearheaded by women. After the rally, people stood in line for an hour to take photos with her. All of which invited only one possible response: I think Donald Trump\u2019s going to win.\n\nElectoral pessimism on the left in the United States is a finely balanced game that, depending on your view, acts either as a check to complacency or a self-defeating hedge that guarantees the very result it\u2019s seeking to avoid. For many, predicting a second term for Trump goes back to the experience of watching George W Bush win a second election when John Kerry was a strong favourite. Hope is all well and good, but what about superstition?\n\nThe gravitational pull towards pessimism was impossible to resist\n\nThe difficulty comes, of course, when this gloominess infects the coverage of the candidates, giving rise to the sort of dithering analysis that seems to hand the other side ammunition. A New York Times article this week unpacked Warren\u2019s \u201ccritical vulnerability\u201d \u2013 too elite-seeming to the white working class \u2013 just as fellow contender Kamala Harris is deemed too mainstream for the far left, and Bernie Sanders too far left for the middle. The exception to this is Joe Biden who, while being a million times better than Trump, is so uninspiring a candidate, no one can even stir themselves to predict his defeat (oh, and Bill de Blasio of course, currently polling at 0%).\n\nDo Trump campaigners do this? One suspects not. His own delusional self-confidence, rooted in a pathology that in other circumstances might require clinical intervention, is mistaken across large parts of the country for leadership. And while the support Trump enjoys from rank-and-file Republicans is a stain on the party that will never be removed, there is no arguing that it\u2019s effective. \u201cHe\u2019s going to win,\u201d I said to a friend this week, and she fairly screamed at me across the table. \u201cDon\u2019t say that!\u201d But the gravitational pull towards pessimism was impossible to resist.\n\n'What's been missing is courage': Elizabeth Warren throws down the gauntlet | Richard Wolffe Read more\n\nWrit large, the chicken-and-egg effect of this impulse is impossible to audit. But it seems fair to assume that the grain of truth out of which critiques of Trump\u2019s opponents grow can, with enough anxious attention, shoot up into a fully blown narrative able to strangle a campaign from within, leaving Republicans to hold their noses and vote in Trump for a second term.\n\nAnd so, while it may be true that Warren has a wonkish aspect that doesn\u2019t play well with voters who didn\u2019t go to Harvard, the real danger for her campaign lies elsewhere, in the bent-out-of-shape psychology of the left \u2013 anticipating defeat just to soften the blow, and muttering to ourselves, \u201cNo we can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist", "description": "The negativity among Democratic voters must be countered if they are to deny the president a second term, says Guardian columnist Emma Brockes", "authors": ["Emma Brockes"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ff3a1525d400982759dd4d3082eba85ec5432c2/0_289_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=5e6ca06171187912bd22f634f8e0d196", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
