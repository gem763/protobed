Owning a strong business and reinvesting the dividends is widely seen as an attractive way of growing your wealth. Yet sometimes, investors buy a stock for its dividend and lose money because the share price falls by more than they earned in dividend payments.\n\nWith a goodly-sized dividend yield despite a relatively short payment history, investors might be wondering if Ucal Fuel Systems is a new dividend aristocrat in the making. We'd agree the yield does look enticing. Some simple analysis can offer a lot of insights when buying a company for its dividend, and we'll go through this below.\n\nClick the interactive chart for our full dividend analysis\n\nNSEI:UCALFUEL Historical Dividend Yield, October 9th 2019 More\n\nPayout ratios\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. As a result, we should always investigate whether a company can afford its dividend, measured as a percentage of a company's net income after tax. Looking at the data, we can see that 42% of Ucal Fuel Systems's profits were paid out as dividends in the last 12 months. This is a middling range that strikes a nice balance between paying dividends to shareholders, and retaining enough earnings to invest in future growth. Plus, there is room to increase the payout ratio over time.\n\nAnother important check we do is to see if the free cash flow generated is sufficient to pay the dividend. Ucal Fuel Systems's cash payout ratio in the last year was 32%, which suggests dividends were well covered by cash generated by the business. It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.\n\nIs Ucal Fuel Systems's Balance Sheet Risky?\n\nAs Ucal Fuel Systems has a meaningful amount of debt, we need to check its balance sheet to see if the company might have debt risks. A rough way to check this is with these two simple ratios: a) net debt divided by EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and b) net interest cover. Net debt to EBITDA is a measure of a company's total debt. Net interest cover measures the ability to meet interest payments. Essentially we check that a) the company does not have too much debt, and b) that it can afford to pay the interest. With net debt of 1.54 times its EBITDA, Ucal Fuel Systems has an acceptable level of debt.\n\nWe calculated its interest cover by measuring its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), and dividing this by the company's net interest expense. With EBIT of 3.69 times its interest expense, Ucal Fuel Systems's interest cover is starting to look a bit thin.\n\nConsider getting our latest analysis on Ucal Fuel Systems's financial position here.\n\nDividend Volatility\n\nBefore buying a stock for its income, we want to see if the dividends have been stable in the past, and if the company has a track record of maintaining its dividend. The first recorded dividend for Ucal Fuel Systems, in the last decade, was nine years ago. It's good to see that Ucal Fuel Systems has been paying a dividend for a number of years. However, the dividend has been cut at least once in the past, and we're concerned that what has been cut once, could be cut again. During the past nine-year period, the first annual payment was \u20b91.00 in 2010, compared to \u20b99.00 last year. Dividends per share have grown at approximately 28% per year over this time. The dividends haven't grown at precisely 28% every year, but this is a useful way to average out the historical rate of growth.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Today we'll take a closer look at Ucal Fuel Systems Limited (NSE:UCALFUEL) from a dividend investor's perspective...", "authors": ["Simply Wall St"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/70wmk_tOkVO4Rf1fMF2ABg--~B/aD00MzI7dz0xMTk0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/simply_wall_st__316/b021a11d4abb1af657c708655ba855b5", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
