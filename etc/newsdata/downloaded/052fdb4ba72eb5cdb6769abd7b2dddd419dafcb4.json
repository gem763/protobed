All that we endured to make this happen, it was something.'\n\nHe told the outlet that he once fostered the siblings' father and had heard that the kids needed a home.\n\n'The kids ended up being taken into care - I believe it was due to neglect,' Lamont said.\n\n'They had them in four different homes, four different cities. They were separated for over a year-and-a-half.'\n\nLamont initially fostered the brothers and sisters for two years before adopting them all together.\n\n'They bring new energy to me. They're lovable kids, very affectionate,' Lamont said.\n\n'They deserve to be raised as siblings, and that was my fight.'\n\nA happy day! Lamont poses with the five siblings, pictured, and friends in the Erie County courthouse in New York\n\nSisters: (L-R) Michaela, one, Nakia, three, and Zendaya, five, will remain together as they are officially adopted by Lamont\n\nLamont recalled that he had fostered more than 30 children since 2000.\n\n'In the beginning, I was helping out some friends. They had lost their child to the system,' he said.\n\n'I went on and got certified and became a foster parent. I haven't stopped since!'\n\nIn 2007, Lamont, who has a biological daughter called LaMonica and a son named Anthony, began to adopt.\n\nHe adopted twins Germayne and Tremayne, and unrelated children Jamie and German soon after.\n\nHe also officially adopted the first child he ever fostered, Michael, now 27.\n\n'He was my third foster home and it ended up being my forever home,' Michael Thomas said. 'He [knew] my biological parents.'\n\n'Lamont never turned [a child] away,' Michael added. 'They either aged out or went back home to their own families.'\n\nAfter the kids grew up, flew the nest and even started their own families, Lamont thought he was at the end of his own child raising days.\n\n'Coming out of retirement': Lamont, pictured with Michaela, said he wanted to make a difference and made the decision to adopt again\n\nAll smiles: Major, left, and Michaela, right, pose with family friends as everyone celebrates the legal adoption\n\nCourthouse: There was lots to celebrate inside Judge Lisa Rodwin's courthouse, pictured, as the family celebrated with balloons and gifts\n\nBut he decided to 'come out of retirement' when he heard about Zendaya, Jamel, Nakia, Major and Michaela.\n\n'It's amazing he's taking on all of them,' LaMonica, also 27, said. 'He does anything for everybody. He's a really a great man,'\n\nMichael added that caring for children is his father's 'God-given call.'\n\n'We're all grown now, I can't believe he's started all over again,' Michael said.\n\n'Lamont has been a life-saver to me. I wouldn't be the person that I am today, had Lamont not ventured in my life.'\n\nForever home: Nakia, left, and Jamel, right, will join Lamont's busy household with his other adopted kids\n\nWriting on social media, foster care worker Anna Miller said,\n\n'My heart is seriously melting today. So much hard work to get these children back together, few will ever know just how much. But being able to witness these children get blessed with a loving home and supportive community is truly priceless... thank you Mr. Thomas and the rest of the village.'\n\nLamont simply said, 'I wanted to make a difference by being a difference, and I love what I do.'", "description": "A single dad-of-twelve adopted five siblings all under the age of five to make sure that they would no longer be in homes separated across cities.
