Restoring Amazon forests, one tree at a time", "language": "en", "text": "CLOSE Earlier this year, America surpassed Russia and China as producers of oil and natural gas and supplied more clean energy than coal. Here's how. Just the FAQs, USA TODAY\n\nMADRE DE DIOS, Peru \u2013 Destruction of the forests can be swift. Regrowth is much, much slower.\n\nAround the world, people put shovels to ground to help it happen.\n\nIn a corner of the Peruvian Amazon, where illegal gold mining scarred forests and poisoned ground, scientists work to change wasteland back to wilderness. More than 3,000 miles to the north, on former coal mining land across Appalachia, workers rip out old trees that never put down deep roots and make the soil more suitable to regrow native tree species.\n\nIn Brazil, a nursery owner grows different kinds of seedlings to help reconnect forests along the country\u2019s Atlantic coast, benefiting endangered species such as the golden lion tamarin.\n\nA reforestation assistant measures a newly planted tree March 29 in a field damaged during illegal gold mining in Madre de Dios, Peru. A team has planted more than 115 acres with native seedlings, the largest reforestation effort in the Peruvian Amazon. The group is in discussion with Peru\u2019s government to expand its efforts.

As forests shrink, so does Earth\u2019s capacity to cope with carbon emissions.\n\nIn the Peruvian Amazon, scientists are trying to change wasteland back to wilderness. (Photo: Rodrigo Abd, AP)\n\nSuccessful reforestation programs take into account native plant species. They are managed by groups with a sustained commitment to monitoring forests, not just one-off tree planting events. Usually, they economically benefit the people who live nearby \u2013 by creating jobs or reducing erosion that damages homes or crops.\n\nA study in the journal Science projected that if 2.2 billion acres of trees were planted \u2013 about 500 billion saplings \u2013 they could absorb 220 gigatons of carbon once they reached maturity. The Swiss researchers estimated this would be equivalent to about two-thirds of man-made carbon emissions since the start of the Industrial Revolution.\n\nCattle graze next to a fragment of the Atlantic Forest in Silva Jardim, Brazil on April 18, 2019.

He followed a narrow path cut by gold miners in the heart of the Amazon, but he was not seeking treasure. Instead, he was on a quest to reforest abandoned gold mines within the world\u2019s largest tropical forest.\n\nAfter three hours of difficult travel, he reached a broad clearing where knee-high saplings stood in rows, their yellow-green leaves straining for the sun. Farfan whipped out a clipboard with a diagram of the saplings planted months earlier, much like a teacher checking attendance.\n\n\u201cThe goal is to look for the survivors,\u201d he said.\n\nForestry researcher Jhon Farfan carries saplings to replant a field damaged by gold miners in Madre de Dios, Peru. (Photo: Rodrigo Abd, AP)\n\nWithin the thick jungle, only a sliver of light escapes to the forest floor. Often more can be heard than seen: a chorus of howler monkeys, the chatter of red-crowned parakeets \u2013 reminders that the Amazon is home to more species diversity than anywhere on the planet.\n\nThe rainforest is under increasing threat from illicit logging, mining and ranching. In a region of southeastern Peru called Madre de Dios, Farfan\u2019s job involves inspecting lands where the forest has been lost to illegal mining spurred by the spike in gold prices after the global financial crash in 2008.\n\nTo recover the gold, the floor of the jungle was turned upside down. There are no gold seams in the lowland areas of the Amazon but only flakes of gold washed down from the Andes mountains by ancient rivers, buried beneath the soil.\n\nAfter cutting and burning centuries-old trees, miners used diesel pumps to suck up deep layers of the earth, then pushed the soil through filters to separate out gold particles. To turn gold dust into nuggets, they stirred in mercury, which binds the gold together but poisons the land.\n\nLeft behind are patches of desert-like land \u2013 dry, sandy, stripped of topsoil and ringed by trunks of dead trees.\n\n\"Operation Mercury\" special forces patrol an area of deforested jungle after the destruction of machinery used by illegal miners in the Tambopata province, in Peru, on April 3, 2019. It is one of three that make up the Madre de Dios department in southern part of the country. (Photo: Rodrigo Abd, AP)\n\nLast December, Farfan and other scientists with the Peru-based nonprofit CINCIA planted more than 6,000 saplings of various species native to this part of the Amazon, including the giant shihuahuaco, and tested different fertilizers.\n\n\u201cMost tree deaths happen in the first year,\u201d Farfan said. \u201cIf the trees make it to year five, typically they\u2019re going to be there a long time.\u201d\n\nA study of former gold mines in Peru by scientists at CINCIA and Wake Forest University several years ago found that seedlings transplanted with soil were more likely to survive than \u201cbare-root seedlings,\u201d and the use of special fertilizers helped growth. Some of the trees tested absorbed trace amounts of mercury through contaminated soil, but it\u2019s not clear how this will affect them.\n\nSince the project began three years ago, the team has planted more than 115 acres with native seedlings, the largest reforestation effort in the Peruvian Amazon to date. The group is in discussion with Peru\u2019s government to expand its efforts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very hard to stop mining in Madre de Dios, since it\u2019s a major activity,\u201d Farfan said. The challenge: to plant a tree that can grow in this soil.\n\n'Desperation species'\n\nWhile scientists struggle with tainted landscapes in the Amazon, activists a continent away reckon with flawed attempts to heal the land.\n\nAfter miners left West Virginia\u2019s Cheat Mountain in the 1980s, there was an effort to green the coal mining sites to comply with federal law. The companies used heavy machinery to push upturned soil back into place, compacting the mountainside with bulldozers. The result was soil so packed in that rainwater couldn\u2019t seep down, and tree roots couldn\u2019t expand.\n\nA bulldozer knocks down non-native trees in Monongahela National Forest, West Virginia on Aug. 26, 2019.

(Photo: Patrick Semansky, AP)\n\nCompanies planted \u201cdesperation species\u201d \u2013 grasses with shallow roots or non-native trees that could endure but wouldn\u2019t reach their full height. On Cheat Mountain and at other former mining sites across Appalachia, more than a million acres of former forests are in similar arrested development.\n\n\u201cIt was like trees trying to grow in a parking lot \u2013 not many could make it,\u201d said Michael French, director of operations for the Kentucky-based nonprofit Green Forests Work.\n\nThe Appalachian highlands once supported a large and unique ecosystem, dominated by 500,000 acres of red spruce forest a century and a half ago. Commercial logging in the late 1800s and coal mining in the 20th century stripped the landscape, leaving less than a tenth of the red spruce forests intact.\n\nFrench and colleagues at Green Forests Work collaborate with the U.S. Forest Service to restore native Appalachian forests and the rare species they support \u2013 by first tearing down other trees.\n\n\u201cWe literally go in with a giant plow-like machine and rip the guts out of the soil\u201d by dragging a 4-foot ripping shank behind a bulldozer, said Barton, the University of Kentucky professor and founder of Green Forests Work. \u201cSometimes we call it ugly.\u201d\n\nMichael French, director of operations for the nonprofit Green Forests Work, pulls up soil in an area of virgin spruce forest in Monongahela National Forest, West Virginia on Aug. 27, 2019.

(Photo: Patrick Semansky, AP)\n\nThis \u201cdeep ripping,\u201d as it\u2019s known, gives rainwater and tree roots a better chance to push down into the soil.\n\nThe idea of ripping up the ground seemed startling at first.\n\n\u201cWhen we first started, a lot of our colleagues thought we were crazy. But 10 years later, we\u2019re well on our way,\u201d said Shane Jones, a wildlife biologist for the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nEarlier efforts at reforesting old mining sites within West Virginia\u2019s Monongahela National Forest didn\u2019t fare so well; sometimes the majority of seedlings died. In areas where the team has deep-ripped over the past decade, the survival rate of saplings has been about 90%.\n\nGreen Forests Work has reforested about 800 acres within the Monongahela, and it is taking a similar approach to other former mining sites across Appalachia, having reforested about 4,500 total acres since 2009. The ultimate goal is to restart the natural cycle of the forest \u2013 so scientists\u2019 work becomes invisible again.\n\nOther reforestation crusades are more personal.\n\nMaria Coelho da Fonseca Machado Moraes, nicknamed Dona Gra\u00e7a, runs a tree nursery that grows seedlings of species native to Brazil\u2019s lesser-known jungle \u2013 the Atlantic coastal rainforest.\n\nMaria Coelho da Fonseca Machado Moraes, nicknamed Dona Gra\u00e7a, smiles as she holds up a sprouting seed from a collection of forest species from the Atlantic Forest, at her nursery in an urban area of Casimiro de Abreu, Brazil, Tuesday, April 16, 2019. As she nears 50, Dona Gra\u00e7a says she is furious at what has happened to the forest, which was whittled down to allow for the urban expansion of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. She deplores \u201cthe stupidity and ignorance\u201d of people who have \u201cdestroyed most of the trees and continue destroying them. So I\u2019m trying \u2026 I can\u2019t do too much, but the little I can do, I try to do it properly to rescue those trees.\u201d (Photo: Leo Correa, AP)\n\nShe collaborates with a nonprofit group called Save the Golden Lion Tamarin, which works to protect and restore the forest habitat of the endangered namesake monkey. \u201cThe Atlantic rainforest is one of the planet\u2019s most threatened biomes, more than 90% of it was deforested,\u201d said Luis Paulo Ferraz, the nonprofit group\u2019s executive secretary. \u201cWhat is left is very fragmented.\u201d\n\nDona Gra\u00e7a said she is furious at what happened to the forest, which was whittled down to allow for the urban expansion of Rio de Janeiro and other cities.\n\nShe deplores \u201cthe stupidity and ignorance\u201d of people who \u201cdestroyed most of the trees and continue destroying them. So I\u2019m trying.
