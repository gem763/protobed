Then again, Joe Biden\u2019s boasts about getting that prosecutor axed also look clumsy. Then there\u2019s Lutsenko\u2019s claim that the Obama administration handed him a \u201cdo not prosecute\u201d list in mid-2016, even as it was pushing Ukraine for dirt on Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s campaign manager.\n\nThat evidence eventually helped send Manafort to prison. What might come of a full-on Hunter Biden probe?\n\nAll of which makes it somewhat astounding that the media has circled the wagons when it comes to Hunter\u2019s behavior.\n\nParticularly since the Ukraine affair isn\u2019t unique: As Peter Schweitzer reported in The Post, Hunter\u2019s private equity fund Rosemont Capital (co-founded with John Kerry stepson Chris Heinz) similarly exploited family connections \u2014 in name, at the very least \u2014 to grow to $2.4 billion under management. Notably, one breakthrough was an early meeting with China\u2019s largest, most powerful government-funded leaders \u2014 the same day Joe Biden met with China\u2019s president.", "description": "", "authors": ["Ny Post", "Nypost.Com Why-Is-Most-Of-The-Media-Circling-The-Wagons-To-Protect-Hunter-Biden"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
