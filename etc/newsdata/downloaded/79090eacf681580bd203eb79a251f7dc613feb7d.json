Stand with Hong Kong.\u201d\n\nThat short and relatively simple message caused a tremendous backlash in China, leading the Chinese Basketball Association to sever all business ties with the Houston Rockets. The NBA quickly issued a statement, trying to make amends for Morey\u2019s post:\n\nWe recognize that the views expressed by Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey have deeply offended many of our friends and fans in China, which is regrettable. While Daryl has made it clear that his tweet does not represent the Rockets or the NBA, the values of the league support individuals\u2019 educating themselves and sharing their views on matters important to them. We have great respect for the history and culture of China and hope that sports and the NBA can be used as a unifying force to bridge cultural divides and bring people together.\n\nWhile the NBA says it\u2019s a \u201cvalues-based\u201d organization, it\u2019s fair to question what \u201cvalues\u201d the Association is truly based on.\n\nAs Breitbart\u2019s Warner Todd Huston wrote of the NBA on Monday, \u201cThis is the same league that canceled games in North Carolina because the Tar Heel State had a \u2018human rights abusing\u2019 transgender bathroom law. But they seem to have no problem with China, one of the most oppressive nations in the world with one of the worst human rights records of any modern nation.\u201d\n\nDespite his criticism of Morey\u2019s tweet, Silver sees his league as a place where people are free to speak their minds:\n\nMembers of the NBA community remain free to express their opinions and the league backs their right to do so. There are the values that have been part of this league from its earliest days, and that includes free expression. I accept that it is also Chinese governments\u2019 and Chinese businesses\u2019 right to react to those words and, at least from my longtime experience in the NBA, it will take some time to heal some of these issues. We are a platform in which people can engage and I would like to believe that for each side who believes they have a point of view here, that this engagement is positive.\n\nIt would be interesting to find out if Daryl Morey believes this \u201cengagement\u201d was positive.\n\nFollow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter @themightygwinn", "description": "Hours after publicly apologizing to China in two different languages for Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey's tweet supporting the", "authors": ["Dylan Gwinn"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Getty-Images23-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
