REUTERS/Peter Nicholls TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY\n\nAs the clock ticks down to Britain\u2019s scheduled exit from the European Union on Oct. 31, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has yet to agree a deal with Brussels.\n\nThat has raised the prospect of an unmanaged, no-deal exit - something Johnson says his government is preparing for, but which opponents of Brexit say will wreak havoc on Britain\u2019s $2.8 trillion (\u00a32.26 trillion) economy.\n\nSwinson has already used her party\u2019s annual conference to toughen its anti-Brexit stance, promising to cancel Brexit if the Liberal Democrats score an unlikely victory in a widely expected early election.\n\nOn Tuesday, the 39-year-old Scot who became the party\u2019s first female leader in July, used her closing conference speech to set out the challenge the party faces.\n\n\u201cAhead of us we have the fight of our lives for the heart and soul of Britain,\u201d she said. \u201cThe next few weeks are about deciding the kind of country that we are, who we want to be.\u201d\n\nSwinson said her ambition for the party, which is gaining support but only holds 18 seats in the 650-seat parliament, knew no limits, and presented herself as a potential prime minister.\n\nJohnson wants to call an election before the next scheduled one in 2022, but has so far been blocked by opponents, including the Liberal Democrats, who say they first want to make sure he can not take Britain out of the EU without an exit deal.\n\nSwinson attacked Johnson\u2019s exit strategy as \u201csickening\u201d and warned voters not to trust his ability to strike a new deal in the next month, nor believe his assertion that a no-deal Brexit can be managed.\n\n\u201cThe truth is you can\u2019t plan for no-deal,\u201d she told party members in the southern English resort of Bournemouth. \u201cPlanning for no-deal is like planning to burn your house down. You might have insurance, but you\u2019re still going to lose all your stuff.\u201d\n\nELECTION DREAMS\n\nAs a party which has never won more than 62 seats at an election, the prospect of Swinson forming a government is a distant one.\n\nTwo different polls on Sunday put the Liberal Democrats 21 percentage points and 8 percentage points behind the Conservatives, and also trailing the main opposition Labour Party.\n\nBy reshaping their liberal, centrist organisation into a party at one extreme of the Brexit spectrum they are hoping to cash in on the anger of the 16 million voters who backed \u2018remain\u2019 in the 2016 referendum on leaving the EU.\n\nSeveral conference delegates and elected officials interviewed by Reuters said that an outright election win was possible but few expressed strong confidence in that outcome.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\n\u201cTo get a majority you wouldn\u2019t only have to beat the Tories (Conservatives), you have to beat Labour in lots of seats as well,\u201d said Caroline Voaden, a Liberal Democrat member of the European parliament. \u201cI don\u2019t know, anything can happen. We have to dream big though.\u201d\n\nInstead, the most likely election outcome is more seats and a kingmaker role if an election fails to produce a clear winner.\n\nSwinson has publicly ruled out a formal coalition with either Johnson\u2019s Conservatives or the socialist-led Labour Party, but she did not address the issue directly in her speech.", "description": "Britain's Liberal Democrats face the fight of their lives to rescue the country from the negative effects of leaving the EU, party leader Jo Swinson said on Tuesday, outlining the battle for hearts and minds in the next few weeks.", "authors": ["William James", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190917&t=2&i=1430946086&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8G1LS", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
