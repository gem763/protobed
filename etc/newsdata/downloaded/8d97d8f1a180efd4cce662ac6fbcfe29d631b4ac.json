Pollock drilled three solo home runs against the Giants on Friday but the Dodgers lost the game anyway. Pollock twice took starter Jeff Samardzija deep and then victimized closer Will Smith with the bases empty in the ninth inning. None of the home runs were cheapies -- each one traveled at least 420 feet. The rest of the Dodger lineup managed only three hits in the contest and Pollock's heroics were not enough to overcome that weak display of batsmanship.\n\nOf all the Dodger players on the field Pollock seems like one of the least likely to break out for a longball barrage. Entering the game there were 10 Dodgers with more home runs than Pollock this year. The Dodgers have 11 players who have hit double-digit homers -- and three of them have already hit 30 or more, including Cody Bellinger, who ranks third in the majors with 44 bombs. They also have Gavin Lux, who had 26 homers in the minors before getting called up this week. The Dodgers have hit 253 home runs so far this year, which is a National League record for any team and they still have 19 more games yet to play. It was the second three-homer game of Pollock's career -- he did it last year against the Dodgers while playing for the Diamondbacks.\n\nStory continues\n\nPollock is playing his first season with the Dodgers and is slashing .267/.326/.482 with 13 home runs and 39 RBI in 70 games played. He spent two months on the injured list this spring with an infection in his right elbow. Prior to joining the Dodgers he spent the first seven seasons of his career with the Diamondbacks, hitting a total of 74 dingers over that period. He has hit more home runs (17) against the Dodgers in his career than against any other team. It is a statistical oddity that he has a pair of three-homer games despite hitting only 87 career bombs in 707 games. He is actually known more for his base-running prowess than his power. He has stolen as many as 39 bases in a single season while owning a career high of 21 homers in a season.\n\nRyu Needs Rest\n\nThe Dodgers are tied with the Yankees for the best record in baseball and they have a commanding 17-game lead over the Diamondbacks in the National League West division. Despite that success they haven't been playing that well lately, especially when it comes to starting pitching. The starting rotation has a 5.67 ERA over the last 14 games. Ace Hyun-Jin Ryu seemed to have the NL Cy Young award locked up a couple of weeks ago but he's given up 21 runs over his last four starts. Amazingly, he gave up just 23 earned runs in his first 22 starts.\n\nThe Dodgers announced on Friday that they would skip Ryu on their next turn through the rotation as they try to get things lined up for the post-season. Despite his recent struggles, Ryu is 12-5 with a sterling 2.45 ERA and 1.06 WHIP after 26 starts. His fantasy value is suppressed somewhat because of a lack of strikeouts compared to the top pitchers in the league. Ryu has fanned 142 batters against just 24 walks in 161 2/3 innings. There are 15 pitchers who have exceeded the 200 strikeout plateau already this year, including Gerrit Cole who leads the majors with 266 punchouts. The added rest should do Ryu some good -- he's already thrown more innings this year than in any season since his rookie campaign in 2013. He pitched a total of 213 1/3 innings over the last four years. Look for the Dodgers to take it easy on his workload for the rest of the regular season in an attempt to keep him fresh for the playoffs.\n\nTwo-Homer Hammer\n\nWillie Calhoun homered twice and drove in four runs in a 7-6 win over the Orioles. He had been stuck in a 2-for-22 slump but snapped that string with the pair of bombs. He got started early by smoking a solo shot to right field off Dylan Bundy in the first inning. He upped the ante by crunching a three-run shot off Bundy in the third frame. The Orioles' pitching staff makes for a good slump-buster -- they've surrendered a record-smashing 273 home runs this year and rank last in the majors with a 5.71 team ERA.\n\nCalhoun has displayed elite power this year, cracking 18 home runs in just 64 games. That would be a 45-homer pace in a full 162 game schedule. He doesn't do much else to provide fantasy value though -- He has a .269 batting average and a weak .311 on-base percentage with 40 RBI and zero stolen bases. He is a slow runner and a liability on defense as well. He needs to hit with consistency to keep himself in the lineup given his lack of versatility.\n\nNational League Quick Hits: Clayton Kershaw was charged with three runs over four innings in a loss to the Giants...
