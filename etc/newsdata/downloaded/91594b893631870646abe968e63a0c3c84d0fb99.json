Apple has reportedly been in conversations with payers like Devoted about bringing its watch to senior members since the beginning of 2019. And inking this deal with Devoted should help Apple capitalize on the senior-focused Apple Watch health features it's been building out. Business Insider Intelligence\n\nWhile Devoted's reimbursement model could lead to a slight boost in sales \u2014 what's even more important than sales is that these new users will bring their health data into Apple's ecosystem, which was recently bolstered with the announcement of three major new health studies and a dedicated Apple Research app. Now that the gates to payer coverage are open, Apple is officially off to the races \u2014 and we expect to see a flurry of similar coverage announcements in the coming months.\n\nBoth Apple and Devoted stand to benefit from this tie-up thanks to increased market penetration and lower healthcare costs, respectively:\n\nFor Apple, Devoted's coverage decision is a sign that the tech giant's senior-focused health play is striking a chord with payers. MA populations \u2014 which are comprised of older members \u2014 are a perfect fit for the Apple Watch's senior-focused health features: Apple has consistently expanded the health functionality of the Apple Watch, adding over time a clinical-grade electrocardiogram and fall detection \u2014 which are well suited for the US' growing senior population, given that heart disease and dangerous falls are more likely to be of concern for older users.\n\nAnd Devoted could be eyeing the Watch's remote patient monitoring capabilities as a path to lower healthcare claims costs. The buzzy insurtech only had about 3,500 members as of the end of Q2 2019 (up from the 2,500 members it tallied in Q1 2019), but the company spent over $21 million on care \u2014 $3 million more than it had in premium revenue for the same period. Devoted told investors that it aims to have more than 5,000 members by the end of this year, according to internal documents obtained by Business Insider Prime. As the company expands its member base, innovative approaches to chronic disease management \u2014 a major contributor to US healthcare spending \u2014 will become all the more critical, given that MA populations tend to have worse clinical and social risk factors than their traditional Medicare counterparts.\n\nFierce competition in the MA space means it's likely we'll see other insurtechs following Devoted's lead, beefing up their benefits with digital health offerings to differentiate from the pack. The MA market has grown 7% annually since 2014 and is projected to swell to $360 billion by 2023 \u2014 but 67% of the market belongs to Aetna, Humana, and UnitedHealthcare.\n\nHowever, this hasn't stopped newcomers like Devoted and other young insurtechs from trying to make a name for themselves in the space, and digital health could be their ticket to greater market shares: Clover Health and Bright Health both told CNBC that they were open to covering Apple Watch in the future, while Oscar Health said that it plans to offer a fitness benefit in 2020 that includes a Fitbit. But we think that Devoted's timing couldn't have been better: By cementing itself as a first mover with Apple Watch coverage and revealing the news on the eve of Medicare's open enrollment period, Devoted stands to benefit from a huge potential swell of new members ahead of 2020.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
