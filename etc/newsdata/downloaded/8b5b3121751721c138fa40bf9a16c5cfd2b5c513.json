(AP) - It\u2019s a new injury for tight end Trey Burton, and a familiar situation for Chicago Bears general manager Ryan Pace.\n\nBurton missed last season\u2019s playoff loss to Philadelphia with a groin injury suffered almost on the eve of the game, and he appears to have a similar issue as the Bears prepare for their season opener Thursday with the Green Bay Packers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that type of injury right now that in our minds it\u2019s minor enough it\u2019s going to be day by day, and let\u2019s see where he\u2019s at,\u201d Pace said.\n\nPace and the Bears felt they dealt successfully with the important issues they faced since last year\u2019s playoff loss to Philadelphia, such as finding a kicker to replace Cody Parkey and monitoring quarterback Mitchell Trubisky\u2019s development.\n\nJust when the Bears thought they could move right into the regular season without a problem, a Burton injury cropped up again. He didn\u2019t practice Sunday and on Monday worked only on a limited basis with what the Bears say has nothing to do with past similar injuries.\n\n\u201cThis was an unrelated mild groin strain that we\u2019re dealing with right now,\u201d Pace said. \u201cSo we\u2019re hopeful, but it\u2019s going to be a day-by-day thing.\u201d\n\nBurton underwent sports hernia surgery in the offseason to deal with what kept him out of the playoff loss.\n\n\u201cWe were smart with how we ramped him up through training camp just with him not doing a lot of football activities over the summer,\u201d Pace said.\n\nThe Bears brought along Burton slowly at camp, and like many starters he hasn\u2019t played in preseason.\n\n\u201cFor us it was more just let\u2019s get him back in football shape when he reported to camp and do it the right way,\u201d Pace said.\n\nBurton said after the playoff loss last year he has suffered from anxiety-related issues, but Pace dismissed this as a possible cause for this injury.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no concern,\u201d Pace said. \u201cI think if anything he\u2019s frustrated, he wants to be out there with his teammates. He knows how important this game is, and the start of the season. So no concern on that end.\u201d\n\nThe Bears may have to move tight end Ben Braunecker into Burton\u2019s role and use tight ends Adam Shaheen or Bradley Sowell more.\n\n\u201cTrey, you know, he\u2019s a big part of the offense,\u201d Shaheen said. \u201cLosing a guy like that, it\u2019s never easy. But me along with Ben and Brad, our job is to pick up where he left off and try to make it so there\u2019s no step down.\u201d\n\nDespite the lingering tight end issue, Pace approaches this season optimistic that the Bears can defend their NFC North title. Trubisky is a key reason.\n\n\u201cYou can feel him operating faster, and I think that comes with knowledge and comfort in the offense, with the scheme and then also the players that he\u2019s playing with,\u201d Pace said.\n\nCoach Matt Nagy notices better understanding of his offense by Trubisky, who wasn\u2019t allowed to throw a pass in preseason games.\n\n\u201cWhen he calls the play he visualizes immediately where everybody is at,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do that last year.\u201d\n\nNagy said Trubisky even has begun to think like him, and cuts him off to finish some of his sentences.\n\n\u201cI do see myself trying to see the game through his eyes, and us being on the same page a lot,\u201d Trubisky said.\n\nAs for the sticky kicker issue, Pace considers Eddy Pineiro the ideal solution to the team\u2019s much-publicized search lasting since shortly after Cody Parkey double-doinked a miss against the Eagles.\n\n\u201cThe hope all along and the optimism all along is to hit on a young kicker that we can grow and develop, and we feel like we\u2019ve done that,\u201d Pace said. \u201cWe\u2019re very confident in him and there was a lot of adversity, but we were into that plan, you know, strategically so. And we think it worked out just right.\u201d\n\nWhatever issues the Bears have, they\u2019d like to think their dominant defense is set for the opener. They finished first in scoring and rushing defense, and forcing turnovers last year after Pace made the trade for pass rusher Khalil Mack.\n\nNagy remembers watching Mack decimate Green Bay\u2019s offense in last year\u2019s opener after missing all the offseason and training camp, and getting in five practices.\n\n\u201cI just said, \u2018holy hell.\u2019 I did,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it. I mean, this guy was like, I know he\u2019s working out, but we didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nThe Bears still lost 24-23 after building a 20-point lead in the second half.\n\n\u201cIt was surreal,\u201d Nagy said. \u201cThat\u2019s a half that I\u2019ll never forget, along with the second half. But there were two really good halves, you learn from it, but it makes you better.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "It's a new injury for tight end Trey Burton, and a familiar situation for Chicago Bears general manager Ryan Pace.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gene Chamberlain"], "top_image": "https://twt-assets.washtimes.com/images/favicon.30333d68dff6.ico"}
