Rob Portman (R-Ohio) and Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), co-chairs of the bipartisan Senate Ukraine Caucus, pressed Ukraine\u2019s then-President Petro Poroshenko to take action on \u201centrenched corruption\u201d within his government.\n\n\u201cWe recognize \u200ethat your governing coalition faces not only endemic corruption left from decades of mismanagement and cronyism, but also an illegal armed seizure of territory by Russia and its proxies,\u201d they wrote in the letter. \u201d[We] urge you to press ahead with urgent reforms to the Prosecutor General\u2019s office and judiciary.\u201d\n\nThe letter \u2015 also signed by Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) \u2015 appears to undermine President Donald Trump\u2019s unsubstantiated claim that there was \u201cquid pro quo\u201d when then-Vice President Biden withheld aid to Ukraine to push the country\u2019s leaders to fire its prosecutor general, Viktor Shokin.\n\nTrump claims Biden did so for the purpose of impeding an investigation into Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company upon whose board Hunter Biden served. No evidence has been brought to light to suggest this.\n\nNBC NewsWire via Getty Images Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), left, and Rob Portman (R-Ohio), right, appear on \"Meet the Press\" in 2013.\n\nBiden boasted in 2018 about withholding $1 billion in aid to Ukraine to get them to oust Shokin, which Trump has claimed amounts to a \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d But foreign policy experts, including a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, say Biden\u2019s actions were an appropriate form of diplomatic pressure.\n\nBiden wasn\u2019t the only person calling for Shokin\u2019s removal from office. Members of Congress (as evidenced by the 2016 letter of support), European leaders and international organizations were all pushing for the notoriously corrupt prosecutor to be fired.\n\nShokin\u2019s office had opened an investigation into Burisma, but it was dormant by the time Biden was working on anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities have cleared Biden of any wrongdoing related to Shokin\u2019s firing.\n\nNeither Portman nor Kirk, who is no longer in office, immediately responded to HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment. Johnson wrote a letter with Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) last week that, in part, called on Attorney General William Barr to investigate allegations that Biden called for Shokin\u2019s removal to help his son.\n\n\u201cThe United States, the European Union, the I.M.F., and Ukraine\u2019s leading reform figures were all pressing for Viktor Shokin to be removed from office because he was one of the biggest obstacles to fighting corruption in the entire country,\u201d Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates told HuffPost in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis was a bipartisan goal in Congress as well,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is unfortunate that Senator Johnson seems to have forgotten a time when he put the country\u2019s values over his own politics, but perhaps re-reading his well-articulated words whole-heartedly agreeing with Joe Biden\u2019s push to move the anti-corruption cause in Ukraine forward will help him on his journey back to intellectual consistency.\u201d\n\nAsked for comment, a spokesperson for Johnson referred HuffPost to comments the senator made Wednesday during an interview with radio station WRRD.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s true, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s not true,\u201d Johnson said while discussing some of the issues referenced in the letter he wrote with Grassley. \u201cIf something happened, the American people should know. If something didn\u2019t happen, the American people need to know so we can get this behind us. It\u2019s about uncovering the truth.\u201d\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Then-Vice President Joe Biden, left, waves as he walks out of Air Force Two with his granddaughter Finnegan Biden and son Hunter Biden in 2012.\n\nTrump\u2019s obsession with Biden\u2019s dealings with Ukraine resulted in a whistleblower complaint filed in August by a U.S. intelligence official that alleges Trump repeatedly pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden and may have withheld military aid as leverage.\n\nThe complaint prompted House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to announce the opening of a formal impeachment inquiry into Trump last week. Democrats say Trump\u2019s exchange with Zelensky amounts to an attempt to seek foreign interference in the 2020 election.\n\nTrump has claimed his call with Zelensky was \u201cperfect\u201d and that he withheld aid because he was annoyed that European allies were not paying enough. He praised Portman on Wednesday for backing up that explanation, declaring \u201cthere\u2019s nobody more honorable\u201d than him.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.", "description": "A 2016 letter expressing bipartisan support for \"urgent reforms\" within Ukraine's prosecutor general's office appears to undermine Trump's claims.", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9637f42100006703520dc5.jpeg?cache=3jnxtaveyu&ops=1778_1000"}
