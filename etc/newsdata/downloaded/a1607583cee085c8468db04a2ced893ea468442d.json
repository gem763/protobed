According to a story in The Athletic published Thursday, Brady has tried to right this wrong by sticking a towel down his center\u2019s pants because wiping the sweat wasn\u2019t working.\n\nNEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS' TOM BRADY RACKS UP ANOTHER FIRST TO KICK OFF 20TH SEASON\n\n\u201cHe literally stood behind me, took his hand, and stuck the towel down my pants,\u201d Dan Connolly, who played for the Patriots from 2008 to 2014, told The Athletic. \u201cI walked around that game, feeling like I was carrying a loaded diaper the entire time. It was the most uncomfortable thing, but he was so crazy about not getting his hands wet that he would stuff s--- down our pants.\u201d\n\nBrady reportedly first made the attempt to stop the sweat with Dan Koppen and has done it ever since.\n\nDavid Andrews, who is on the injured reserve, told The Athletic he tried to train his body not to sweat.\n\n\u201cI have actually tried to train my body not to sweat,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cSo, I would sit in the sauna and just try not to. It didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nTOM BRADY REMINDS ROOKIE TO 'STUDY YOUR PLAYBOOK' IN INSTAGRAM COMMENT\n\nAndrews added that the towel method was strange at first.\n\n\u201cIt was something that was very different for me at first, especially when he grabs you as a rookie in training camp and throws a towel down your butt,\u201d he said. \u201cPulling your shorts back, dumping baby powder down your butt. But that\u2019s part of it, and obviously, if it affects how he operates, you want to be as good as you can about it.\u201d\n\nBrady isn\u2019t the only quarterback to have noted issues with their centers\u2019 sweaty bottoms.\n\nMINNESOTA VIKINGS' KIRK COUSINS EXPRESSES CONCERNS OVER ROOKIE OFFENSIVE LINEMAN'S SWEAT\n\nMinnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins expressed his concerns last month about rookie center\u2019s Garrett Bradbury\u2019s sweat. He mentioned it when he was asked what he was expecting from Bradbury during their first preseason game.\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna take it back to how much he sweats, again,\u201d he said, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune. \u201cHe promises that it\u2019s not a problem in games, and it remains to be seen because his shorts today were soaked. And he says it\u2019s not a problem on game days, so the moment of truth Friday night.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe added: \u201cBut apparently, you know, when they keep those domes air-conditioned and you get a break on the bench and you sit with the cooling fans, I\u2019m hoping that really helps. So that\u2019s a big thing I\u2019m gonna take away from Friday night, is how tough was it to grip the ball after he snaps it to me. If it is tough we might be in pistol and shotgun all year, which coach [Gary] Kubiak and Kevin [Stefanski] wouldn\u2019t like very much.\u201d", "description": "Tom Brady has an issue with his centers\u2019 sweaty behinds and rightfully corrects it.", "authors": ["Ryan Gaydos", "Ryan Gaydos Is An Editor For Fox News.
