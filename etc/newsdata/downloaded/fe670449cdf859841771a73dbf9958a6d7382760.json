An image posted by the publication shows a pop-up ad for Ghost Town that appeared during a Geico commercial (Ghost Town is sponsored by Geico). The matching pop-up included a prompt for the viewer to set a reminder using the Roku remote. Cord Cutters News says that the pop-ups will only display over ads that have partnered with Roku on the feature.\n\nAlthough Roku is best known for its streaming hardware, last year on an episode of the Vergecast its CEO said that he believed the company was in the ad business rather than the hardware business. Previously the bulk of these ads have been found on the home screen of Roku\u2019s devices, but now the company is expanding these efforts to ad-supported TV broadcasts.\n\nThe new pop-ups build on Roku\u2019s existing Automatic Content Recognition (ACR) technology, which is used to offer the \u201cMore Ways to Watch\u201d feature it introduced back in 2017. This opt-in feature automatically senses what you\u2019re watching on broadcast TV and alerts you when it\u2019s available via streaming services.\n\nUnfortunately this means that you can\u2019t turn off the new pop-up ads without also losing access to the \u201cMore Ways to Watch\u201d feature. If you want to disable it, you can do so by turning off the \u201cUse Information From TV Inputs\u201d option within the privacy section of the settings menu, according to Cord Cutters News.\n\nThe new ads appear to have been introduced with version 9.2 of the Roku operating system, but at least one commenter claims to have seen the ads on version 9.1. We have contacted Roku for more information on the pop-ups, and will update this piece with any response.", "description": "Roku TVs have started showing interactive ads overlaid on TV commercial breaks received over cable or antenna.
