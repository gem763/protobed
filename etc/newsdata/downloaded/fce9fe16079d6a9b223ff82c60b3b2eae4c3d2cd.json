The short CNN interview was taped in Lahore, Pakistan at the SOS Children\u2019s Village on Thursday.\n\n\u201cI think William and I really wanted to come and see an SOS Children\u2019s Village like this,\u201d Middleton said. \u201cThere are so many vulnerable women here, but they\u2019ve used their positivity and the support that the village here provides them to really support and protect the next generation, the children in their care, and give them the best possible start to their future lives.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been fantastic, we\u2019ve seen a lot of Pakistan,\u201d the Duchess added. \u201cA huge variety. Amazing seeing some of the geography. Then to see some of the community activities like this town has been really special.\u201d\n\nMany commenters were thrilled with Kate\u2019s interview and the work the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are doing in Pakistan.\n\nA lovely, strong woman turns out to have a lovely, strong voice! Nice to hear ya, Kate! \u2014 It's Me Lisa (@leeeeeeeesssa33) October 18, 2019\n\nThank you for highlighting the importance of @soschildrenpk and this encourages me to get myself involved with my country\u2019s SOS children village as well .. \u2014 Blissfully_me (@blissfultobeme) October 18, 2019\n\nOther commenters felt the interview and the visit seemed rather shallow for Kate and William.\n\nFuture king and Queen tour the wealthy side of Pakistan ignoring the poverty side of the country. Whereas another royal couple made a point of touring the poor side of South Africa to show them they are not forgotten \u2014 Tidysome (@tidysome) October 18, 2019\n\nA few felt that Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were more impressive in their visit to South Africa.\n\nBreaking news! Kate likes Pakistan because she\u2019s surrounded by armed guards and only visiting the finest places. \u2014 OuiserB (@ouiser_b) October 18, 2019\n\nOn Friday, a preview of Meghan and Harry\u2019s exclusive 1-hour ITV interview that was filmed while they were in South Africa was released. Markle touched on her struggles of motherhood and the negative press.\n\n\u2018Morning Joe\u2019 hosts remember Elijah Cummings, who married them: \u2018He was just perfect\u2019:\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:", "description": "Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, held her first TV interview since marrying Prince William and becoming a royal.", "authors": ["Arjuna Ramgopal"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rG.ZO3JQjVVwtd1MGLVLmg--~B/aD0xOTk3O3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/1d267e20-f1b4-11e9-affa-117f854b7ac0", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
