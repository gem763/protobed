The Green Liberals, an environmentalist party with libertarian socioeconomic policies, scored 7.6 percent of the vote, 3 percentage points more than in the last election.\n\nEnvironmental issues played a far greater role in this year's campaign than in the past, and analysts link the green parties' gains to the climate strike protests that have swept Europe and beyond over the last year.\n\nThe far-right Swiss People\u2019s Party (SVP) took the top spot with 26.3 percent of the vote, but it lost more support than any other party compared to 2015 at a decrease of 3.1 percentage points. The center-left Social Democratic Party took second place with 16.5 percent of the vote \u2014 a 2.3 percentage point decrease compared to the last election.\n\nProjections also show the Green Party overtaking the Christian Democratic People's Party in fourth place, which could secure them a spot in the grand coalition that has governed for decades, Reuters reported.\n\nThe seven Cabinet positions are divided among the four leading parties. Currently, six Cabinet seats are shared equally between the SVP, the Social Democrats and the right-leaning Free Democratic Party \u2014 which is now in third place, according to projections \u2014 with the centrist Christian Democrats holding the seventh seat.\n\nAlthough Switzerland has not borne the brunt of global climate change, experts have warned that the Alpine country has lost 15 percent of its glacier volume in the past 10 years, Deutsche Welle reported.\n\nAuthors:", "description": "Far right still set to win most seats, but environmentalists\u2019 success could land them a Cabinet seat, according to projections.", "authors": ["Anca Gurzu"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1177192295-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
