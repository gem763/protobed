According to the report:\n\nThe live stream drew less than 8,000 viewers at its peak. Around 80 per cent of the 12,000 \u201creactions\u201d on the Facebook post expressed anger, and many users wrote: \u201cFive demands, not one less.\u201d Lam said she had already responded to the protesters\u2019 demands, but said she was \u201cperplexed\u201d by calls to disband the police: \u201cEvery day there are large and small problems with law and order in Hong Kong\u2026 and the police are needed to follow up on those cases.\u201d \u201cI hope everyone can be objective, and not take a predetermined view. I hope that law enforcement will not have subjective feelings towards protesters, and in the same way, protesters should not believe that the police are acting against them,\u201d she added.\n\nHong Kong protest leaders counter-programmed with a press conference of their own, where they criticized Lam and her administration for trying to \u201cbuy us off with their sops,\u201d a derisive reference to Lam\u2019s package of proposals for housing relief and economic stimulus. They also trashed one of Lam\u2019s key proposals, a plan to essentially create artificial islands with high-rise apartment buildings on them, as absurdly expensive and environmentally unsound.\n\nInterestingly, Lam admitted during her little-watched Facebook broadcast that she understood the protesters were not all motivated by economic factors like anxiety over Hong Kong\u2019s rough housing market.\n\nChina\u2019s state-run Global Times naturally forgot to mention Lam\u2019s address was poorly viewed on a platform Chinese citizens cannot access, or that Lam was jeered out of her own legislature when she tried to deliver her policy address in person. Instead, the Global Times portrayed the Facebook event as a rousing success:\n\nLam also answered dozens of netizens\u2019 questions ranging from housing, education, welfare, medical service, and the handling of the current unrest that has been battering Hong Kong over the past four months. Lam again explained to the public her third policy address that covered more than 220 initiatives, with the focus on housing and other livelihood issues. The policy address highlighted livelihood issues such as housing and land supply, improving people\u2019s livelihood and economic development, and appealing to the community to put aside differences and set sail again. Last month, Lam and four secretaries of the HKSAR government had candid talks with about 130 representatives of the public at the first community dialogue, a move widely seen as a first step to ease social tension and restore public confidence.\n\nThere is little sign of social tension easing or public confidence restored in Hong Kong, where more protest marches are expected this weekend. The past week was seen as relatively calm, but activists said they would proceed with a giant rally on Sunday despite the police ruling it illegal because they said the event might be \u201chijacked by a group of radical protesters.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we always respect citizens\u2019 rights to assembly and freedom of speech, we are alarmed by this epidemic that radical protesters resort to violence in expressing their opinion,\u201d said a police public relations representative.", "description": "Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam explains her policy agenda and defends the Hong Kong police force via Facebook.", "authors": ["John Hayward"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1176167498-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
