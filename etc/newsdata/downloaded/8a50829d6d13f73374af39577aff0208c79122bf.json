Their survival depends on water resources, which glaciers provide, according to Eagle Wings.\n\nResearchers say Alpine glaciers are melting at an alarming rate with before and after photographs showing them retreating up valleys over the last century.\n\nAccording to a study published in August, France's largest \u2014 the Mer de Glace and the Argentiere \u2014have lost a third and a quarter of their thickness respectively since the start of the 20th century and could disappear entirely by the end of the 21st.", "description": "Equipped with a 360-degree camera mounted on his back, Victor recorded a bird's eye view of the Mont Blanc", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/21/91/54/1000x563_cmsv2_838a936e-c0ba-5662-982c-b900658ecb0e-4219154.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
