Here's a bit of background and a few tips on how to join this massive full moon party.\n\nWhat are the origins of Mid-Autumn Festival?\n\nThe Mid-Autumn Festival is widely celebrated around Asia. Lam Yik Fei/Getty Images AsiaPac/Getty Images\n\nMid-Autumn Festival became an official celebration in China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 CE) but there isn't one single answer to the question of when and how the Mid-Autumn Festival began.\n\nMany believe the fete was first mentioned in the \"Book of Rites,\" a Confucius classic on bureaucracy and rituals written more than 2,400 years ago.\n\nIt was described as a day for emperors to celebrate the year's harvest by giving offerings to the moon and hosting a great feast.\n\nToday, the Mid-Autumn Festival is an incredibly important family gathering -- it's when \"people and the moon reunite to form a full circle,\" as an old saying goes.\n\nChang'e: The moon festival goddess\n\nLike many cultural celebrations, the Mid-Autumn Festival is shrouded in myth. One of the most beloved -- and tragic -- pieces of folklore tells the story of how Chang'e became the moon goddess.\n\nAccording to the legend, after mythological Chinese archer Hou Yi courageously shot down nine surplus suns -- leaving only one, in effect protecting the world from being scorched completely -- he was given an elixir from heaven.\n\nRelated content 13 of Asia's most picturesque towns\n\nHou Yi's wife Chang'e drank the elixir while protecting it from a greedy apprentice, but became so light that she floated to the moon.\n\nMissing his wife, Hou Yi prepared a feast every year on the day when the moon is at its fullest, hoping to get a glimpse of his wife's shadow.\n\nYutu (Jade Rabbit) -- China's moon rover -- was named after the legendary rabbit that was sent to accompany Chang'e to the moon.\n\nHow to celebrate?\n\nThe Tai Hang fire dragon dance is performed in Hong Kong.

CNN\n\nOne of the biggest stars of the Mid-Autumn Festival is the mooncake -- it's as important to festivities as turkey is to Thanksgiving and latkes are to Hanukah.\n\nThe calorie-packed pastry is sliced up and shared like a cake between families and friends.\n\nThe most common kind of mooncake is made of lotus seed paste, salted egg yolk and lard -- which explains why a palm-sized cake can contain about 1,000 calories.\n\nNuts, red beans and custards are some other popular ingredients.\n\nIn recent years, big brands have taken to creating specially designed mooncakes. The Palace Museum in Beijing, for example, offers some particularly stunning ones.", "description": "It's time to hang a lantern, rip open a mooncake and peel a pomelo -- Mid-Autumn Festival is just around the corner.
