If anyone knows her, she\u2019s pretty open with her fans and everything. She\u2019s very genuine, she\u2019s very real and for her to put on a cast and walk around like it\u2019s fake, it\u2019s wild.\n\nMICHELLE PFEIFFER BROKE HER ARM IN BATH ACCIDENT: \u2018SELF, SLIPPERY FLOOR, BE CAREFUL'\n\n\u201cBut anyone who spews hatred needs more love, so love ya, girl,\u201d she concluded.\n\nWilliams, 55, previously said Brinkley's injury seemed \"fake as hell\" and was a ploy to make Sailor a bigger star with the competition series.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you what I see: I don\u2019t see a wrist and a shoulder being fractured. But that was real cute,\u201d Williams said on her talk show last week. \u201cHere\u2019s my thought: 'Dancing with the Stars' called Christie Brinkley and she said yes. After she got off the phone, that\u2019s when she plotted her schedule \u2026 In my opinion, I think what Christie did was she signed up for 'Dancing with the Stars' knowing that she\u2019d put her daughter Sailor in there.\u201d\n\nCHRISTIE BRINKLEY WANTS TO \u2018IMMEDIATELY\u2019 COMPETE ON \u2018DANCING WITH THE STARS,\u2019 SAYS DAUGHTER SAILOR\n\nBrinkley, 65, fired back at Williams' allegations in a sitdown on \"The Talk.\"\n\n\"Wendy Williams started this rumor, which was stunning to me because I've been on Wendy's show a few times,\" Brinkley said. \"For some reason, she liked me, and she would call on me to support her in tough times. I was there for her.\"\n\n\"Then, she goes through a divorce,\" Brinkley said. \"I get a call again because, let's face it, I'm kind of an expert in that. I came again ... and so I thought it was a mistake when somebody said she was doing this. So, I got a call one day that she was having a terrible bout of stage fright, and she was about to drop out of 'Chicago The Musical,' and I'd come over and talk to her. I was like, 'You will never meet a more supportive and loving cast. You will love this experience and you will regret it if you don't do it.'\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShe added, \"My message to Wendy is, it's so much more fun to be kind. Try it. It can't feel good to try to hurt other people. If it feels good, something's seriously wrong.\"\n\nFox News\u2019 Jessica Sager contributed to this report.", "description": "Sailor Brinkley-Cook fired back at Wendy Williams after the talk show host claimed her mother, Christie, faked her season-stopping \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d injury.", "authors": ["Tyler Mccarthy"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/BrinkleyWilliams1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
