Even inspired star running back Saquon Barkley to giddily hop off the field, keeping his injured right ankle and crutches aloft.\n\n\u201cHe keeps passing the test, in our mind. Until this afternoon, he hadn\u2019t played in a regular-season NFL game,\u201d Shurmur said about Jones. \u201cMaybe I\u2019m seeing it wrong, but he didn\u2019t disappoint.\u201d\n\nJones is the first rookie since 1970 with at least 300 yards passing, two TDs through the air and another two on the ground in a game.\n\nAnd this silly stat was making the rounds on Twitter: Jones now is 1-0 when trailing by 18, while Manning never won once when facing such a deficit.\n\nOn the other hand, Manning has a 2-0 edge in Super Bowl championships.\n\nManning, to the surprise of no one, spent time with Jones on the sideline Sunday, offering up a congratulatory first bump after the new guy\u2019s first scoring run.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t thank him enough for his support throughout the week,\u201d Jones said, \u201cand today throughout the game.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what else people are talking about after the third Sunday of the NFL season:\n\nBYE, AB\n\nThe Antonio Brown saga just keeps unfolding, and unraveling, with the receiver who\u2019s been accused of rape and trying to intimidate another woman, and who was jettisoned by three teams in 2019, declaring on Twitter that he \u201cwill not be playing in the NFL anymore.\u201d\n\nHe also typed up, then deleted, a scorched-earth rant before the day\u2019s games kicked off, taking shots at New England Patriots owner Bob Kraft and Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, among others.\n\nPatriots coach Bill Belichick, whose team employed Brown for one game, wouldn\u2019t respond to a reporter\u2019s question Sunday about the receiver - days after cutting short a session with the media because he didn\u2019t want to discuss a player who at the time was still on his team\u2019s roster.\n\nPATRIOTS\u2019 D\n\nSpeaking of the Patriots, their defense has done something no other team has done in the Super Bowl era: not allowed a TD to an opposing offense via a pass or run through three games.\n\nThen again, New England hasn\u2019t exactly been facing The Greatest Show on Turf. Its opponents before beating the Luke Falk-led New York Jets 30-14 in Week 3? The Steelers, the team Brown played for last season, and the Miami Dolphins. Combined record: 0-9.\n\nThe Patriots, let\u2019s not forget, are the reigning Super Bowl champions, and they still have Belichick running the defense and Tom Brady leading the offense. They\u2019re also not the only club to take full advantage of a weak-as-can-be schedule so far. The Bills are also 3-0, and they\u2019ve played the Giants, the Jets and the Cincinnati Bengals, who dropped to 0-3 with Sunday\u2019s 21-17 loss at Buffalo.\n\n___\n\nFollow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "So maybe all those fans and media members blasting the choice of Daniel Jones with the No. 6 overall pick in the NFL draft were being a little hasty in their judgment of him and New York Giants general manager Dave Gettleman.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Howard Fendrich"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/22/giants_buccaneers_football_88311_c0-180-4200-2628_s1770x1032.jpg?44ea4e92a683e577965550bdf99569a8183d8455", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
