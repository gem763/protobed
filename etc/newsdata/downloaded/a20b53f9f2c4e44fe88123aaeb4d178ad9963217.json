(Jonathan Ernst/REUTERS)\n\nTina Tchen, a Chicago attorney who served as Michelle Obama\u2019s chief-of-staff, was tapped as the new chief executive of the national advocacy organization \u201cTime\u2019s Up\u201d on Monday.\n\n\u201c[We\u2019re going to] work hard at the root cause of sexual harassment: because sexual harassment occurs when we have workplaces that aren\u2019t diverse, that aren\u2019t inclusive, that don\u2019t respect their workers,\u201d Tchen said in the announcement on Twitter. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re going to work with companies, with employers, with employees to make those workplaces ones that are safe, respectful, and where everyone can reach their full potential.\u201d\n\nTchen co-founded Time\u2019s Up\u2019s legal-defense fund, the organization\u2019s signature initiative to offer legal support for women in all industries facing workplace sexual harassment. The fund has so far raised more than $24 million.\n\nTchen, who was tapped in March to review a series of workplace-harassment allegations for the Southern Poverty Law Center, played a key role in the dropping of 16 felony charges against actor Jessie Smollett, who falsely claimed to be the target of a racially-motivated attack.\n\nPer reporting from the Chicago Sun Times, Tchen, reportedly at the request of Smollett\u2019s family, texted Cook County state attorney Kim Foxx to ask that she persuade Chicago Police Department superintendent Eddie Johnson to turn Smollett\u2019s case over to the FBI. Tchen claims she made the request out of a desire to prevent media leaks.\n\nJust days after Smollett claimed the crime had occurred, Foxx replied to Tchen saying she had made her case to Eddie Johnson, who ultimately refused to relinquish control over the probe.\n\n\u201cOMG this would be a huge victory,\u201d Tchen wrote in response to a text message from Foxx. \u201cI make no guarantees,\u201d Foxx answered, \u201cbut I\u2019m trying.\u201d\n\nFoxx later recused herself from the case, a move that prompted a letter from the Chicago Fraternal Order of Police asking the Department of Justice to open an investigation into Foxx\u2019s handling of the situation. In June, a Chicago judge appointed a special prosecutor to look into the matter and suggested that Foxx acted improperly in her decision to hand over the case to a top deputy.\n\nMichelle Obama took to Twitter to celebrate the announcement.\n\nI\u2019m thrilled that @TIMESUPNOW named @TinaTchen\u2014one of the most brilliant and purposeful leaders I\u2019ve ever worked with\u2014as its new president and CEO. I\u2019ve seen how Tina\u2019s hustle and intellect can transform policies and touch lives, and I can\u2019t wait to see her thrive in this role! https://t.co/iWxPIaRQv0 \u2014 Michelle Obama (@MichelleObama) October 7, 2019", "description": "Tina Tchen, a Chicago attorney who served as Michelle Obama\u2019s chief-of-staff, was tapped as the new chief executive of the national advocacy organization \"Time\u2019s Up\" on Monday.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Andrew C.
