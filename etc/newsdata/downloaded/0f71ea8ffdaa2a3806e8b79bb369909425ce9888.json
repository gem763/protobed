They feel cheated and exploited by firms and retailers, who have fixed prices for basic consumer goods.\n\nMany Chileans live with high levels of debt and thus pay more for the same services (such as higher education or healthcare) than rich people, who get discounts because they can pay in cash.\n\nBut perhaps most importantly, they feel discriminated against and humiliated in all these areas as they battle with inadequate public services that fail to level the playing field.\n\nThe result is that the expectations for a better and more secure life have outpaced the opportunities for social mobility that the Chilean model actually delivers.\n\nBy now it should be obvious that in a (thankfully) fiscally balanced country, these inequalities cannot be overcome by patching up the deficiencies of the economic model through the country\u2019s limited fiscal resources, which have stagnated at approximately 20% of GDP, compared with the OECD\u2019s average of 34%.\n\nReforms such as increasing minimum wages or pensions through fiscal resources will fail to make a dent in inequalities generated by privatised social protection systems that barely share risk between their beneficiaries.\n\nNor will they help informal workers, who desperately require an earned income tax credit to motivate them to engage in formal and stable employment, while giving a significant redistributive boost to their disposable income.\n\nThe legacy of Pinochet\u2019s economic model underlies existing social protection systems largely because political elites have refused to contemplate structural changes.\n\nA significant proportion of contributions to social systems must now go towards sharing risk equally among the population so that rich and poor can receive the same level of care in hospitals, receive pensions that are a guarantee of old-age security and have the same chances of obtaining a good education.\n\nThis is the basic premise of public services as they exist in every developed country in the world.\n\nBut structural reforms are difficult to implement in any country, especially when the government does not command a majority in Congress. Most importantly, they require a social and political consensus.\n\nThe rage felt by marginalised youth explains \u2013 although does not justify \u2013 the violence that erupted during the protests, and it is accompanied by sharply declining credibility and trust in institutions, including all political parties.\n\nPi\u00f1era now has a tremendous opportunity to generate the kind of social pact that could sustain such reforms, as requested by representatives from over 300 civil society leaders.\n\nThis week, he took an important step in this direction by reshuffling his cabinet to include younger and more liberal ministers, who have the ability to think creatively, establish a social dialogue and engage with civil society in a way that generates a new social pact. However, they should not be in this task alone.\n\nPoliticians from across the political spectrum must support such a pact. But it will be up to the president to lead the country in this process and make use of the opportunity that this crisis has generated.", "description": "President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era has chance to lay foundation of a real welfare state as protests reflect country\u2019s discontent with inequalities", "authors": ["Kirsten Sehnbruch"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad10f5d7258011f5d4e76145a6ebb2d0af919ff/0_19_3268_1961/master/3268.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=46462ea98773cdfe09520fe5592ac3ac", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
