They died hours later.\n\nThe NHS does not recommend a cervical stitch for mothers-to-be who are carrying twins or triplets.\n\nLeading gynaecologists say there is no evidence the procedure will prevent an early labour in women with multiple pregnancies.\n\nHowever, Miss Offord feels 'let down' by the NHS and believes she was discriminated against because of her age.\n\nMiss Offord, who is unemployed, said: 'It's been horrendous. I feel I was pied off because it was my first pregnancy and I'm young.\n\n'I feel let down by the NHS. If a stitch had been fitted around the 13-week mark than we wouldn't be having this conversation.'\n\nMiss Offord, whose cervix was 2.5cm short, added: 'If they are born breathing they should be helped. It's a basic human right.'\n\nMiss Offord, from Chatham, Kent, went into labour at 22 weeks and three days, giving birth to Autumn Grace and Peyton Rose in May 2019. Pictured, the clothes she bought for them\n\nShe claims to have asked for a cervical stitch to be fitted - but was told it was 'old fashioned' and wouldn't be effective.\n\nBabies born between 23-24 weeks are a 'a major medical and ethical challenge', the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says.\n\nWriting in a scientific paper in 2014, the body went on to state that at 'at 22 weeks of gestation there is no hope of survival'.\n\nGenerally, babies are considered 'viable' only over 24 weeks of pregnancy, meaning there is possibility for them to survive being born at this stage, the NHS says.\n\nPremature birth is the largest cause of neonatal mortality in the US and the UK, data shows. Many babies born too early aren't ready for life outside the womb.\n\nDespite this, Miss Offord believes that as her baby's were showing signs of life when they were born, they should have been offered helped by medics.\n\nMiss Offord claims her 13 week scan showed her cervix was dangerously short, which puts her babies at risk of being born too early. But she wasn't offered a cervical stitch\n\nMiss Offord claims her girls were breathing and showing signs of life, and she pleaded with medics to intervene. They didn't because babies are only deemed viable at 24 weeks\n\nMiss Offord, pictured during pregnancy, feels 'let down' by the NHS and believes she was discriminated against because of her age\n\nShe said: 'The moment I was handed them was very surreal, I didn't feel like it was happening to me.\n\n'They came out perfectly. They were both born breathing and I could see them moving about.\n\n'I pleaded with the doctors to help them. They said they couldn't do anything and if they had a chance of surviving they would be severely disabled.\n\n'It annoys me that they couldn't attempt to help them even if they were born breathing. The fact they were born breathing shows they had viability.\n\n'If someone is 90 and goes into hospital and passes out but is still breathing they'll be resuscitated. Why shouldn't a baby?'\n\nMiss Offord believes it should be the parents' choice, not up to doctors, to try and save a premature baby.\n\nShe said: 'At the end of the day if a baby is born breathing the doctors still need to have a duty of care.\n\n'If the parents turns around and says \"don't intervene\" that's fine.\n\n'But I wanted them to try and save my children and at the end of the day as a parent I should have the right to decide if I want my child helped or not.'\n\nMiss Offord also claims part of her baby's placenta was left inside of her, meaning she had to have emergency surgery.\n\nA retained placenta is when part of the placenta remain in the womb, occurring in around three per cent of vaginal births, according to the charity Tommy's.\n\nMiss Offred said she feels the hospital haven't supported her through a very traumatic time. Pictured, the casket for Autumn Grace and Peyton Rose\n\nIf this isn't treated, it can cause life-threatening bleeding. Miss Offord said: 'The support from the hospital since has been appalling.\n\n'I was left with continuous heavy bleeding but was told that it was just normal. Then one day in July I started bleeding out.\n\n'I lost lots of blood and had massive blood clots. I was rushed to hospital and was given an internal scan where it was found out I still had attached placenta with blood flow in me.\n\nWHAT IS A CERVICAL STITCH? A possible cause of giving birth early is because the cervix shortens and opens too soon. A cervical stitch may help to prevent this. It's placed around the cervix - the neck of the womb - usually between 12 and 24 weeks of pregnancy, although occasionally it may be done at later stages in pregnancy. Babies born earlier than the 37 completed weeks of pregnancy have an increased risk of short and long term health problems. Sometimes a cervical stitch is not advised because it may carry risks to you and it would not improve the outcome for the baby. This may be if there are signs of infection, vaginal bleeding, the woman is having contractions or the waters are already broken. There is no definite evidence to show that a cervical stitch will prevent an early labour if the mother is carrying more than one baby.

We tried to get on as best we could but it was a bit surreal.\n\n'It's been terrible coming home and seeing all the things we would have had with them.\n\n'I remember opening the front door and seeing this empty house full of all these toys and clothes. None of it had any purpose anymore.\n\n'I'm not sure what the future holds and if I can see myself having kids in the future.\n\n'The fate of my baby's was taken out of my hands and I just hope that other mums out there are able to be given at least a choice.'\n\nHarvey McEnroe, chief operating officer for Medway NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We would again like to extend our sincere sympathies to Ms Offord and her family.\n\n'The devastating impact of pregnancy loss is not underestimated by our team who provide care to women and their families at such a distressing time.\n\n'Our maternity team is trained and supported to give high quality compassionate care to all of our families on our bereavement pathway and we are very sorry that Ms Offord was unhappy with the care she received during this very traumatic time.\n\n'In line with national guidance, at a gestational age of 22 weeks it is considered in the best interests of the baby for resuscitation not to be carried out as chances of survival without severe long-term problems are so low that active intervention to support life is not recommended.\n\n'A premature birth is traumatic for any family and we are extremely sorry for Ms Offord's loss.\n\n'We are currently in the process of liaising directly with Ms Offord in response to her concerns.'", "description": "Lucy Offord, 20, from Chatham in Kent, claims her 13-week scan showed her cervix was dangerously short, which put her babies at risk of being born too early.", "authors": ["Vanessa Chalmers Health Reporter For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/04/13/19295586-0-image-a-45_1570190603658.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
