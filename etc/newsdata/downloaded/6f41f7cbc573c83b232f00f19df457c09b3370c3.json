The men\u2019s 50-kilometer race walk final was slated for a 5:30 a.m. start.\n\nMarathons were run after midnight in 38 degrees C (100 degrees F) this month at the track and field world championships in Doha, Qatar.\n\nThe IOC said it informed the track body and said it will consult with Olympic teams and broadcasters.\n\nAn Olympic panel overseeing games preparation will discuss heat measures at its Oct. 30-Nov. 1 meeting in Tokyo.\n\n\u201cThese include better shade, water sprays, better access to water supplies and an initiative to help the athletes in their preparations,\u201d the IOC said.\n\nThe plan driven by increasing summer heat cuts into a key promise of Tokyo\u2019s bidding, first for the 2016 Olympics won by Rio de Janeiro and then its successful 2020 campaign, to deliver a \u201ccompact games\u201d with 85% of venues in an 8-kilometer (5-mile) city center cluster.\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The International Olympic Committee wants to move the Tokyo Games marathons 800 kilometers (500 miles) north to avoid the searing heat in the city.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/16/qatar_athletics_worlds_12201_c0-280-6720-4200_s1200x700.jpg?549b535615f604a464414eea45420bce1df5565c", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
