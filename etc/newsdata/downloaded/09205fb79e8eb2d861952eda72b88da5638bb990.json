They [police] know that this is going on, but they are failing to arrest the perpetrators,\u201d he said.\n\nThe source, who survived an assassination attempt in 2017, said he suspected that illegal taxi operators, who are demanding to be allowed to operate in the area without permits, are behind the recent murders.\n\n\u201cWe are living in fear because we don\u2019t know who is next. I have asked the police to place me under witness protection twice ... it hasn\u2019t happened,\u201d the source said.\n\nKZN Transport, Community Safety and Liaison spokesperson Mluleki Mntungwa said MEC Mxolisi Kaunda is planning to meet with SAPS management today in connection with the murders.", "description": "A weekend of violence left six people dead in the Esigodini area in Edendale.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9134/75d651b1833f4874bf99ca6ff80176f4.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-26"}
