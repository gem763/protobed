The guard questioned him about who he was and what his room number was.\n\nHe responded by telling the guard he was a guest \u2013 and even showing hotel security and a manager his room card envelope \u2013 and started recording cell phone video of the confrontation.\n\n\u201cThis guy\u2019s harassing me,\u201d Massey says on the video. \u201c...Do you really want this PR issue\u2026?\u201d\n\nThe guard responded by explaining that police were on the way to remove Massey from the property.\n\n\u201cBecause what ... I\u2019m staying here?\u201d Massey asks, according to the outlet.\n\nThe guard responded: \u201cNot anymore.\u201d\n\nHotel staff later escorted to his hotel room to get his belongings. Massey then had to find another place to stay.\n\nMassey was staying at a franchise location owned by WMK Management LLC. Sami Qureshi, general manager for the company, said WMK has a zero tolerance for discrimination or bias of any kind.\"\n\n\"Since the incident last year, we have conveyed our deepest apologies to Mr. Massey to address his experience. We also have taken multiple steps to ensure nothing like this ever happens again, and to make sure we are able to provide a non-discriminatory, inclusive, and welcoming environment for every guest. We\u2019ve taken constructive steps to educate our employees by hosting multiple mandatory diversity, equity, and inclusion trainings, and engaging closely with community members to listen and learn from them on how we can be a better community partner.\"\n\nQureshi also said Massey's attorney has previously declined to meet with them to discuss the matter. The lawyer, Jason Kafo, did not immediately respond to FOX Business' request for comment.\n\n\u201cMr. Massey hopes to learn what policies of Hilton have led to these events, what Hilton has done in response to such events, and will ask the jury to punish Hilton as an example to other hotels who may be tempted to encourage or tolerate discrimination at their places of business,\u201d Jason Kafou told the OregonLive.com.\n\nThe hotel \u201csincerely apologized,\u201d after Massey's removal from the hotel. Both the security guard and the hotel manager were fired.\n\nOn Thursday, Hilton, which is named in the lawsuit, provided FOX Business with a statement following the filing, saying, in part: \"Hilton has zero-tolerance for racism and is committed to providing a welcoming environment for all guests. As a demonstration of our inclusive culture, our corporate employees and Hilton-managed hotels have completed diversity and unconscious bias training.\u201d\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nThe company has also increased training to address unconscious bias and diversity, according to the statement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\"In our 100th year, we are proud of our company\u2019s culture, one that has earned us recognition as the #1 Company to Work For in the U.S. and #1 Workplace for Diversity.\"", "description": "An African American man has sued DoubleTree hotels for $10 million after he was kicked out of one of the chain\u2019s Oregon locations \u2013 where he was a paying guest \u2013 all because he was making a phone call in the lobby.", "authors": ["Stephanie Pagones"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/Hotel-Room.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
