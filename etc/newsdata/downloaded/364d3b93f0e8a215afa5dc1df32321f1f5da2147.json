Check. Plenty of PDA on the streets of New York? Check. Social media boasts? Yep, check.\n\nAnd now, David, 44, and Lily, 34, have walked their first red carpet together.\n\nLily and David are believed to have started dating in August (Picture: Janet Mayer/Startraksphoto.com)\n\nQuite the line-up (Picture: Roy Rochlin/Getty Images)\n\nLily accompanied the Stranger Things actor to the Skin Cancer Foundation\u2019s Champagne for Change gala at New York\u2019s swanky Plaza Hotel, and while they weren\u2019t holding hands or tangling tongues for the cameras, it\u2019s clear this romance is blossoming.\n\nThe Smile singer, dressed in a paisley ptinted dress and boots, stood alongside David, who looked dapper in a dark suit as they walked the red carpet at the gala.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe couple were joined by Avengers star Sebastian Stan, Katie Holmes, actress Dianne West and talent agent Adam Schweitzer, which is quite the eclectic dinner party.\n\nJust your average photobomb by Katie Holmes (Picture: Janet Mayer/Startraksphoto.com)\n\nLily looked lovely in a printed frock (Picture: DARA / BACKGRID)\n\nDavid and Lily had a bit of a matchy-matchy thing going, with both of them wearing teeny buns in their hair \u2013 which is basically as much of a statement as matching rings.\n\nRight? Right?!\n\nWe first wondered what was going on between Lily and David back in August, when the unlikely pals were seen leaving a London theatre together.\n\nThings stepped up a notch when the pair were seen enjoying the Hughie Fury vs Alexander Povetkin boxing match at the O2 Arena.\n\nDavid is best known for playing Hopper in Stranger Things (Picture: Janet Mayer/Startraksphoto.com)\n\nLily and David seem smitten (Picture: LRNYC / MEGA)\n\nLily, who has two daughters from her marriage to Sam Cooper, had been single since splitting from boyfriend of three years Meridian Dan, while David is believed to have split from Fantastic Beasts actress Alison Sudol earlier this year.\n\nThe couple seemed smitten as they enjoyed a shopping date in Manhattan earlier this week, planting kisses on each other and enjoying cuddles in the street.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd it looks like we have more Dilly (we\u2019re working on it) antics to look forward to, as Lily said she would be leaving the UK until \u2018after Brexit\u2019.\n\nWe don\u2019t blame her.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
