It was big, super heavy, and was billed the world\u2019s first holographic phone. Except it never quite delivered, and now, alongside a retirement announcement, Red Founder Jim Jannard is cancelling Red\u2019s Hydrogen project altogether.\n\nIn a post on Red\u2019s Hydrogen forums, Jannard explained that after turning 70 and being hit with \u201ca few health issues,\u201d he felt it was time for him to retire. In a rather brief statement, Jannard thanked previous coworkers and employees, while announcing that Red\u2019s Digital Cinema team will left in the hands of Red president Jarred Land, Red executive vice president Tommy Rios, and Red president of marketing and creative Jamin Jannard.\n\nAs for the Hydrogen One itself, Jannard says the phone will continue to receive support, though it\u2019s unclear if that means the phone will just get regular security patches or more substantial updates like new versions of Android. As for Red\u2019s second Hydrogen phone, which was teased in a forum post Jannard made earlier this summer, the development of that device has almost certainly been cancelled.\n\nThis is a bit disappointing, because even though $US1,300 ($1,905) Hydrogen One (which recently saw a price drop down to just $US650 ($953)) was unusually expensive at launch and never really lived up to its potential, making phones is hard, and even companies with an extensive pedigree like Essential have stumbled out of the gate.\n\nAnd while the Hydrogen One\u2019s \u201cholographic\u201d display actually looked more like the screen you get on a Nintendo 3DS instead of something out of Star Wars, it did add an interesting effect to both photos and properly formatted movies\n\nHowever, it seems that not all is lost as Jannard also mentioned that Red\u2019s Komodo 6K camera\u2014which will supposedly have some sort of integration with the Hydrogen One\u2014is \u201cabout to be launched.\u201d While there\u2019s no specific timetable on when the Komodo is supposed to arrive, it\u2019ll be interesting to see if it can breathe any life back into the Red\u2019s now largely abandoned phone.", "description": "The Red Hydrogen One was a phone from another dimension.
