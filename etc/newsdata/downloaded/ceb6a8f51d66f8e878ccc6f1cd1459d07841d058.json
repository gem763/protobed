You just can\u2019t recreate stuff like that. The wine, the food, the cheese.\n\nFor a primary home, I really like living in Miami. It\u2019s a really nice lifestyle. I live in a custom home in Echo Brickell.\n\nThere\u2019s also this pocket in Miami where Madonna has a house, and where Sylvester Stallone lived. They\u2019re hidden and it\u2019s on a bay. You\u2019re in the urban core, but you\u2019re also on the open water.\n\nMG: Do you have a real estate property that got away?\n\nRS: You miss certain things if you\u2019re not paying attention. There\u2019s a site in Miami that on Brickell Avenue that another company got for a steal. It\u2019s an old teacher\u2019s union building.\n\nMore: Compass\u2019s \u2018Chief Evangelist\u2019 on the Importance of a Home\u2019s Context\n\nMG: What does luxury mean to you?\n\nObviously, it starts with location, that\u2019s the biggest driver. Then you get into things like space, and types of finishes. After location, luxury becomes a lot more subjective. It\u2019s more about style and taste.\n\nMG: What area do you think is the next hub for luxury properties?\n\nRS: Everybody\u2019s down on real estate in general, because we\u2019re potentially headed for recession. And Miami developers don\u2019t have their head in the sand, condo prices are down, and absorption is down.\n\nMiami has always been attractive to South and Central American buyers, but it\u2019s becoming increasingly more expensive for them.\n\nIf you spend more than a month here each year, than the strip, starting at Coconut Grove all the way up to Wynwood\u2014that whole coastline is the new luxury. A lot of people want to be urban, and they want to be near water. Edgewater too\u2014people are riding the coastline all the way up.\n\nI couldn\u2019t be a bigger fan of where luxury is headed in Miami\u2014and I think it\u2019s off the beach.\n\nMore: Sotheby\u2019s International Realty Executive Says Customizing a Home is Key\n\nMG: What\u2019s the biggest surprise in the luxury real estate market now?\n\nRS: When you look at what drives luxury markets, the dollar being so high is a problem. The world is kind of on fire at the moment. There\u2019s less disposable income everywhere, and America has become more expensive.\n\nAfter 2008, real estate was really cheap, but now the dollar is so high, and it makes it difficult for foreign buyers. It\u2019s a good time for Americans who want to buy in America.\n\nBut places like San Francisco, New York and Miami, which are global cities, and are driven by foreign buyers, are feeling the strains.\n\nMG: Where are the best luxury homes in the world and why?\n\nRS: The best in the world are in Europe. If luxury is uniqueness and authenticity, it\u2019s there.\n\nI was in Ireland recently, and there were some places we went through that were just gorgeous\u2014houses that overlooked cliffs.\n\nMore: Design Firm Chief Says Luxury is About Tapping Into All the Senses\n\nMG: What\u2019s your favorite part of your home?\n\nRS: I love watching football. I\u2019m a big Dolphins fan. I created a room with a custom bar that\u2019s for watching TV. Behind the walls there\u2019s technology, called tiling, that allows me to watch 10 games at once if I want. It was a long, thought-through process.\n\nMG: What best describes the theme to your home and why?\n\nRS: It\u2019s definitely modern. I don\u2019t want to say minimalist, though. It\u2019s a lot of clean architecture with warmth from wood and stone.\n\nMG: What\u2019s the most valuable thing in your home?\n\nRS: My dog, he\u2019s a Portugese water dog named Larry.\n\nBut aside from him, my kitchen, which was custom ordered from Poliform. I think they\u2019re some of the best in the world. It faces out, and it has sliding doors called Sch\u00fcco doors. It\u2019s very indoor/outdoor. You tend to get those in houses, but not condos.\n\nFrom Penta: Future Returns: Impact Investing in Latin America\n\nMG: What\u2019s the most valuable amenity to have in a home right now?\n\nRS: I\u2019ve always been a fan of doing the basics well\u2014pools, gyms, valet parking, et cetera. Things like ice skating and cigar rooms are too much.\n\nAt Echo Brickell we have really good food and beverage, which is great too.\n\nMG: What\u2019s your best piece of real estate advice?\n\nRS: People tend to get hung up on small dollar amounts, and you can\u2019t let your lifestyle suffer because you got a \u201cbetter\u201d deal somewhere else. It\u2019s an investment vehicle, yes, but you should also want to live there.\n\nMG: What\u2019s going on in the news that will have the biggest impact on the luxury real estate market?\n\nRS: Our president is having an effect on the real estate market. And if we head into a global recession, everything gets affected.\n\nMore: Luxury is About Inner Wellness, Says Los Angeles-Based Designer\n\nMG: What is the best area now for investing in luxury properties?\n\nRS: Real estate is trading below cost in a lot of areas. Prices are lowered. It\u2019s worth hopping on a plane and getting shopping.\n\nMG: If you had a choice of living in a new development or a prime resale property, which would you choose and why?\n\nRS: It depends. I really would look at the building as a whole. Some buildings are built well, others aren\u2019t. There\u2019s a lot of badly built buildings out there, and a lot of great ones, too.\n\nWhen I moved to Miami after living in Chicago, I bought in a building called Epic, because I knew the developer, and it wasn\u2019t brand new. I bought the least expensive apartment in there.\n\nMG: What area currently has the best resale value?\n\nRS: The area that is the new luxury corridor\u2014Brickell, the Eastside, where you\u2019re on the mainland on the water and looking toward the beaches. There\u2019s much more price appreciation. It has a lot to do with flood insurance and the perception of climate change.\n\nClick to Read More Luxury Real Estate Professionals Share Their Insights\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["Lucy Cohen Blatter"], "top_image": "https://images.mansionglobal.com/im-117055?size=1.7777777777777777&width=1280", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
