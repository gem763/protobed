Photo: Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nMichael Cohen, President Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer, is currently serving a three-year prison term at the federal prison in Otisville, New York, for lying to Congress, financial crimes, and campaign finance violations, including paying two women hush money ahead of the 2016 election so they would keep quiet about their affairs with Trump. And guess what, haters? He\u2019s absolutely loving it.\n\nAs Cohen\u2019s lawyer, David Schwartz, told \u201cPage Six\u201d this weekend, he and Cohen know that people are hoping Trump\u2019s former lawyer \u201cis getting beaten up every day in prison,\u201d but, egg on their face, because according to Schwartz, Cohen is \u201cliterally the mayor of the prison.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s doing great: The other inmates call him \u2018Mr. Mayor,\u2019\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cHe\u2019s a celebrity in the jail. Everybody is coming up and shaking his hand. He\u2019s enjoying hanging out with the other inmates.\u201d\n\nAnd for the spiritual delinquents who previously voiced their horniness for Cohen, Schwartz added that the soft-spined, wet-eyed lawyer is looking hotter than ever.\n\n\u201cMichael has a job fixing fire hydrants. He really enjoys his work. He looks great \u2014 he is tan, works out every day and has lost more than 30 pounds. He sleeps in a cubicle with a bed, night table and a desk \u2026 He is basically very unstressed. The only downside is he misses his family.\u201d\n\nMaybe this is all true. Or maybe it\u2019s another one of Cohen\u2019s thirst scams, like @WomenForCohen, the fake Twitter account Cohen reportedly paid an IT firm to run, that included tweets like, \u201cIn a world of lies, deception and fraud, we appreciate this honest guy @michaelcohen #tgif #handsome #sexy.\u2019\u201d\n\nSure, Michael.\n\nStay in touch.
