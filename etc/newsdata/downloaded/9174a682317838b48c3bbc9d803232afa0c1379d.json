(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Max Scherzer was held back by the Washington Nationals for Game 4 of their NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, with Anibal Sanchez replacing him as the starter for Game 3.\n\nThe Nationals announced the switch Sunday morning, less than nine hours before Game 3 was scheduled to begin.\n\nScherzer originally was the pitcher Washington said would be on the mound in the tied best-of-five series. But that plan was thrown into question after manager Dave Martinez brought Scherzer on in relief in Game 2; the three-time Cy Young Award winner struck out all three batters he faced in Washington's 4-2 victory at Los Angeles on Friday night.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\n''We talked after the game. Throwing Sanchez Game 3 and letting me get an extra day would probably be the best thing for me and for the team,'' Scherzer said Sunday. ''So that was Davey's decision, and it's Davey's call.''\n\nThe Dodgers planned to send baseball's ERA leader, Hyun-Jin Ryu, to the mound for Game 3, with Rich Hill facing Scherzer on Monday.\n\nSanchez went 11-8 with a 3.85 ERA this season, his first with the Nationals. He was their No. 4 starter, after Scherzer, Stephen Strasburg and Patrick Corbin.\n\n''Everybody talks about the Big Three that we have,'' Martinez said. ''You could mention Anibal as being one of the Big Four, because he was really good this year for us. Really good, especially down the stretch.''\n\nSanchez is 2-5 with a 3.12 ERA in eight previous postseason appearances for Detroit and Atlanta. He started one game of last year's NLDS between the Braves and Dodgers, allowing three runs in 4 2/3 innings and taking the loss for Atlanta.\n\nHe faced the Dodgers in the regular season on July 26 at Los Angeles, giving up one run and three hits in seven innings of a 4-2 loss for the Nationals.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe righty retired 20 batters in a row in one stretch, but the bullpen blew the game, as happened often during the regular season; the good news for Washington is neither of the relievers who allowed runs, Tony Sipp and Kyle Barraclough, is with the club nowadays.\n\nStrasburg started Game 2 against the Dodgers and is lined up to go in Game 5 if there is one. Corbin started Game 1 of the NLDS and is expected to be available in relief the rest of the series.\n\nAsked whether any of his starters might be used out of the bullpen Sunday, Martinez replied: ''That remains to be seen.''\n\nAs for whether Corbin was asked to delay throwing a bullpen session so he could be available in Game 3, Martinez said with a chuckle: ''Yeah, I've asked a lot of guys to hold off on their bullpens.''\n\n''The beautiful thing about our guys is that they're all in. They really are,'' Martinez said. ''It's never a twist-your-arm conversation.''\n\nScherzer said later that there was no way he would pitch as a reliever in Game 3. But then he paused and added: ''Unless Davey got crazy and came to me and said, 'Let's do it.' So then I would say, 'Yes.' But I just don't envision that happening.''\n\nNotes: Nationals CF Victor Robles has a mild strain in his right hamstring and was out of the starting lineup for Game 3, replaced by Michael A. Taylor. But Martinez said Robles was available as a pinch hitter. Robles was hurt running to first base in Game 2. ... Brian Dozier got the start at second base for Washington. He is the third player to start a game at that position in the series for the Nationals, after Asdrubal Cabrera in Game 1 and Howie Kendrick in Game 2.\n\n---\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports", "description": "Max Scherzer was held back by the Washington Nationals for Game 4 of their NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers, with Anibal Sanchez replacing him as the starter for Game 3.
