This means even further cutting of fixed-rate mortgages, while those lenders who can't compete on price are having to tweak criteria and be more flexible than perhaps they might have been in the past.\n\n'This is excellent news for borrowers and once buyers return to the market, when the uncertainty is removed from the equation, there are some extremely competitive products for them to take advantage of.'", "description": "Halifax's latest house price index found prices rose 1.1 per cent in the 12 months to September, with the average price now \u00a3232,574.", "authors": ["George Nixon For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
