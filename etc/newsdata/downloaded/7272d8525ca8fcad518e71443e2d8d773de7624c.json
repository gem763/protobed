Facebook sues Israeli cyber firm for exploiting WhatsApp vulnerability", "language": "en", "text": "Facebook\u2019s chat platform WhatsApp has launched a lawsuit against an Israeli cyber surveillance firm, ironically claiming it helped governments in over a dozen countries (other than the US) to access users\u2019 private data.\n\nFiled in a US federal court on Tuesday, the new suit alleges a Tel Aviv-based tech developer, NSO Group, provided the tools used to hack over 1,400 WhatsApp users earlier this year \u2013 most shockingly including \u201cactivists, lawyers, journalists and diplomats\u201d \u2013 in what the chat service called an \u201cunmistakable pattern of abuse.\u201d\n\nIn a passionate statement by a genuinely disturbed spokesperson, the US-based company has called for a permanent injunction barring NSO from accessing its computer systems, as well as those of Facebook, its parent firm.\n\nThere must be strong legal oversight of cyber-weapons like the one used in this attack to ensure they are not used to violate individual rights and freedoms people deserve wherever they are in the world.\n\nAlso on rt.com Facebook agrees to pay record $5bn fine over privacy violations, critics call it a \u2018parking ticket'\n\nThough its complaint singles out Mexico, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, WhatsApp says NSO worked with \u2018repressive\u2019 governments and \u2018undemocratic\u2019 intelligence agencies in 20 countries to facilitate the hacks, which exploited the platform\u2019s video chat service to secretly access devices.\n\nThe Israeli firm denied the accusation \u201cin the strongest possible terms,\u201d and vowed to \u201cvigorously fight\u201d the hypocritical lawsuit, saying there was nothing criminal in cooperating with lawful authorities around the globe.\n\nThe sole purpose of NSO is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime.\n\nAlso on rt.com \u2018Nuclear weapon of bad ideas\u2019: US, UK & Australia demand Facebook give backdoor access to WhatsApp & other encrypted messengers\n\nFacebook itself is no stranger to serious data breaches and allegations of spying on its vast platform, with the Federal Trade Commission slapping the tech giant with an unprecedented $5 billion fine over privacy violations earlier this year. The company has also come under scrutiny in Europe for snooping on users and sharing data, including in Germany, Belgium, France and in one of the EU\u2019s highest courts.\n\nAmerican and other western officials have repeatedly called on Facebook to go even further in its data sharing practices, pleading with the company to provide governments free access to its encrypted messaging platforms and solidify itself as a defacto arm of intelligence agencies. While Facebook \u2013 whose founder once referred to users as \u201cdumb f**ks\u201d for trusting their private data to him \u2013 has vehemently declined such a preposterous, the company\u2019s principled dedication to privacy remains questionable.\n\nAlso on rt.com All snooping is bad but some is worse: Why is Huawei a worry if it\u2019s WhatsApp & Israel who messed up\n\nIf you like this story, share it with a friend!", "description": "Facebook\u2019s chat platform WhatsApp has launched a lawsuit against an Israeli cyber surveillance firm, ironically claiming it helped governments in over a dozen countries (other than the US) to access users\u2019 private data.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cdni.rt.com/files/2019.10/article/5db8ea52203027604b3380f7.JPG", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
