He was a two-time Pro Bowler in 2013-14 and considered one of the top shutdown cornerbacks in the game at his peak, but two injury-filled seasons caused the Browns to give up on the 2010 first-round pick.\n\nCleveland's loss was Pittsburgh's gain, as the low-risk move paid off big time.\n\nHaden has started every game he has played with the Steelers, often lining up against the top opposing receiver.\n\nThe 30-year-old led the team with two interceptions and 12 passes defended in 2018, adding 63 tackles.\n\nHis production and the lack of depth around him had led to extension talks beginning in July, with the two sides eventually coming to a new agreement before he was able to hit free agency.\n\nThe veteran also expects to remain in the league for at least a few more years.\n\n\"I see myself playing for sure past 35, I think around 36 is the golden number,\" Haden said, per Ed Bouchette of The Athletic. \"That will be like 16 years in. It's going to be 10 (this season). I'm focused. For sure I know I can play for sure to 15. But 15, once I get there I'll start re-evaluating.\"\n\nIt now seems likely that most of these years will be in Pittsburgh as he helps solidify the otherwise young secondary.", "description": "The  Pittsburgh Steelers  and cornerback  Joe Haden  have agreed to an extension worth $22 million over two years, according to  Adam Schefter  of ESPN.
