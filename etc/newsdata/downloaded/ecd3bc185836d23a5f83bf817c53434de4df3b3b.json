No, you probably won\u2019t ever be able to afford a place of your own\u2014unless you move to Japan, squat for 12 years, or shoehorn your whole life into a house the size of a horse float. Maybe you\u2019ve weighed up every one of these options, and maybe you\u2019ve resigned yourself to the fact that you\u2019ll be renting for the rest of your life. Whichever way you cut it, the outlook, it seems, is bleak.\n\nBut what about caves? Have you thought about caves? Because there\u2019s a cave in outback NSW that\u2019s just gone on market for a cool $14,000 AUS ($10,085 USD). And it could actually be the cheapest home in Australia.\n\nWatch: The London Anarchist Group Squatting Mansions to Fight Homelessness\n\nThe \u201cdugout\u201d in question is located in the small, ex-opal mining town of White Cliffs, about 250 kilometers northeast of Broken Hill and 1,000 kilometers northwest of Sydney. It\u2019s a \u201cUnique opportunity\u201d, according to Jeffrey, the current owner and the man who listed the property for sale on Gumtree. A \u201crare dugout site partially developed. Electricity available, [and] water connected.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bit of a fixer-upper, according to Realestate.com, and would likely require some work before it\u2019s at a habitable standard. Importantly, though, it\u2019s also about 32 times cheaper than the average property in the state.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the dugout is fitted with five ventilation shafts to keep the place cool, Seven West Media reports\u2014an attractive feature in a place that reaches temperatures as high as 45 degrees. Not happy with the amount of space? Jeffrey says that \u201cyou can [just] dig yourself another room\u201d by burrowing deeper into the cliffside. Maybe you\u2019ll even strike a fortune while you\u2019re renovating.\n\nWhite Cliffs was the first commercial opal field in Australia, and since 1894 the residents have been converting disused mine shafts in the area into underground hovels. Most people living in these dugouts are prospectors or amateur miners. If you\u2019re willing to pack up and head to the outback, that could easily be you.\n\n\u201cCreate your own underground home in one of the richest opal producing fields in White Cliffs,\u201d Jeffrey\u2019s ad beckons. \u201cCould be opal.\u201d\n\nThere's also probably not opal in there, though. There's probably just a cave that even Jesus wouldn't be caught dead in, and which happens to be the most affordable property in Australia.\n\nFollow Gavin on Twitter or Instagram\n\nThis article originally appeared on VICE AU.", "description": "It's fitted with electricity and water, but you'll need to dig another room if you want more space.", "authors": ["Gavin Butler", "Caleb Quinley", "Sarah Ngu"], "top_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/5c09f5427506f80006142d94/lede/1544156750874-Screen-Shot-2018-12-07-at-32519-pm.png?crop=1xw:0.7670454545454546xh;center,center&resize=1200:*", "published_at": "2018-12-11"}
