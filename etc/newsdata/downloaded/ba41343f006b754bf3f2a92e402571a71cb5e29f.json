Rihanna was focusing attention back on the catwalk rather than the rich and famous onlookers, she said.\n\n\"What's happened to the fashion show of late is it's all about who is there and it's the greatest show on Earth,\" Graafland told the BBC.\n\n\"Everybody wants the eyes of the world on their show. Now Rihanna has turned it into a piece of theatre, conceptualised it and is making people see it as she wants them to see it.\"\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Models and pop stars rubbed shoulders on the elaborate set\n\nCommentators compared the buzz around Rihanna's Amazon tie-up with the fortunes of Victoria's Secret, which is not staging a televised catwalk show for the first time in almost two decades after it hit a ratings low in 2018.\n\nVictoria's Secret had been criticised for a lack of diversity, whereas one hallmark of Rihanna's Savage Fenty X fall/winter underwear range is its inclusivity, with the star saying she wants to \"celebrate everybody\".\n\nTuesday's show was choreographed by Parris Goebel, best known for her work on music videos such as Justin Bieber's Sorry.\n\nAfterwards, Rihanna told Business of Fashion: \"I love how she makes everything sexy despite society's ideal of what sexy looks. I don't care about any skinny Victoria's Secret model when I look at Parris. I want to be that woman on the inside.\"\n\nAmazon Studios described the show as \"a radical departure from tradition\", with \"exciting surprises around every corner\".\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Paris Hilton, Bella Hadid and Cara Delevingne were all pictured arriving at Rihanna's show\n\nFollow us on Facebook, or on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts.
