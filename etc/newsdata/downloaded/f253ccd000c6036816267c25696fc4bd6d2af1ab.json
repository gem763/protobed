Others will prove controversial.\n\nWhy are they proposing this plan?\n\nNFU President Minette Batters said: \u201cClimate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time.\n\n\u201cWe recognise our unique position as both a source and a store for greenhouse gas emissions and, importantly, how we can deliver climate-neutral farming in 20 years.\n\n\u201cWe aspire to be producing the most climate-friendly food in the world. The carbon footprint of British red meat is only 40% of the world average.\u201d\n\nThere is, though, still debate among scientists over the best way to reduce emissions from livestock farming.\n\nWhat do environmentalists think about it?\n\nFriends of the Earth campaigner Guy Shrubsole said he was astonished the plan doesn\u2019t include eating less red meat.\n\nHe told us: \u201cEating less but better meat would free up much more land for woodlands and agroforestry (in which trees are grown alongside crops).\n\n\u201cBut it seems the NFU is still not prepared to contemplate significant land use change, despite the Committee on Climate Change recommending this as being vital.\n\n\u201cThe NFU has an opportunity to embrace a new approach to managing the land that benefits both farmers and the planet - something progressive farmers in the UK are starting to pioneer - but this report falls short.\"\n\nMs Batters told us that, even if British consumers decided to cut their meat consumption, UK farmers could produce high quality low-carbon meat for export.\n\nShe said a more detailed carbon-cutting document would be published in future. But she emphasised that every farm was different and would need to take its own approach.\n\nTomorrow a left-leaning think tank, Common Wealth, will call for re-wilding 25% of the UK. It will say this could provide approximately 70% of the capacity the UK needs to absorb CO2 emissions.\n\nFollow Roger on Twitter.", "description": "Farm union unveils plan to slash emissions and combat CO2 - but critics ask why no mention of meat?", "authors": ["Roger Harrabin", "Bbc Environment Analyst"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/D113/production/_108732535_mediaitem106787756.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
