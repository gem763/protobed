They seem addicted to the revenue it brings them.\n\n\u201cAs a result, it\u2019s possible that these lower levels of activity will remain for some time.\u201d\n\nAnother factor likely to keep listing levels down was global uncertainty, according to Mr McGrath.\n\nHe expected many would-be sellers to be waiting to see how some global events played out, such as Brexit, the US-China trade war, Hong Kong-China tensions and the US election in 2020.\n\n\u201cWe may find that until we get some resolution on these issues and clarity on the political direction of the US, listing levels will remain on the low side.\u201d\n\nMcGrath is expecting Sydney property prices to continue growing next year with \u201cstrong but not double-digit\u201d growth.\n\nSuburbs where there would be standout levels of growth included Breakfast Point, Erskineville, Castle Cove, Sandringham and Kensington, he said.\n\nBreakfast Point would experience growth because of new roadway infrastructure, while Kensington would benefit from improved access from the new light rail.\n\nThe other suburbs were becoming increasingly popular with a broad range of buyers and the lifestyle on offer was more sought after.", "description": "Real estate mogul John McGrath has slammed state government for crippling taxes on property transactions, which he says are driving up housing costs and making it harder to buy and sell.", "authors": ["Aidan Devine"], "top_image": "https://www.realestate.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/20090924/capi_f03bb2c0ebfc4e228201ee2d2cce4171_0377589e3d3a3a1b702a9176e3cb8074.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
