Memorabilia attests to the day in 1890 when Buffalo Bill swung by for coffee with a group of cowboys. Three hundred works of art hang on the bar\u2019s burgundy walls.\n\nCaff\u00e8 Greco has weathered wars and countless political and economic upheavals, but a bitter financial dispute is testing its resilience. The issue began in September 2017, when Antico Caff\u00e8 Greco\u2019s lease expired and the property\u2019s owner, the Israelite Hospital \u2013 a privately-run hospital that operates within Italy\u2019s public health system \u2013 wanted to raise the monthly rent from \u20ac18,000 to \u20ac120,000. A legal battle ensued and a judge eventually ruled that the management firm must vacate the property next Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe sentence is incomprehensible and the rent hike extortionate,\u201d said Carlo Pellegrini, the owner of Antico Caff\u00e8 Greco. \u201cWe would be ready to pay more rent to keep the cafe open but not six times the amount we\u2019re paying now. I feel very angry, but we will fight this.\u201d\n\nItalia Nostra, a heritage group, has joined the battle for the bar\u2019s survival, organising a series of cultural events in the days leading up to the potential closure.\n\n\u201cThe idea of Caff\u00e9 Greco disappearing off the face of the Earth, from the memory of Rome residents and tourists who make a point of having a coffee there, is absolutely intolerable,\u201d said Vanna Mannucci, the vice-president of Italia Nostra\u2019s Rome unit. \u201cI don\u2019t care who earns how much, what matters for me is that this historic and cultural place remains.\u201d\n\nCaff\u00e9 Greco, its furnishings and artworks have actually been protected property since 1953, when the Italian government stipulated that regardless of who manages the premises, the bar must remain intact.\n\nThe Israelite Hospital, which has three medical facilities in Rome, inherited the property about 80 years ago. Until now, the hospital and the various management companies that have run the bar, including Antico Caff\u00e8 Greco, which took over in 2000, have co-existed peacefully.\n\nCaff\u00e8 Greco is surrounded by plush stores on the Via Condotti and there have been reports that the Italian luxury brand Moncler was keen to take over the lease.\n\nFabio Perugia, a spokesman for the Israelite Hospital, insisted that the bar would not close.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An espresso in Caff\u00e9 Greco can set you back \u20ac7. Photograph: Stefano Politi Markovina/Alamy\n\n\u201cCaff\u00e8 Greco has been there for 250 years and it will continue to be there,\u201d he said. \u201cThe law says that nothing can be changed. The only difference will be a new manager.\u201d\n\nPerugia added that the rent figure requested was in line with the market rate and that the money would be invested in the Israelite hospital.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a figure that we are looking for, it\u2019s what other managers are willing to pay.\u201d He was unable to say whether a new firm had been found, just that \u201cthere are many potential managers who would like to take over the bar\u201d.\n\nCaff\u00e8 Greco draws a steady crowd of Rome residents and tourists, although its coffee doesn\u2019t come cheap. Drinking an espresso while standing at the bar is a reasonable \u20ac1.70, but having it served at a table by one of the bow-tied staff costs \u20ac7.\n\nPellegrini and Italia Nostra are calling for the recently reappointed culture minister, Dario Franceschini, to intervene to ensure the bar\u2019s survival before Tuesday\u2019s deadline.\n\n\u201cThe minister is always attentive to maintaining historical establishments,\u201d said Mattia Morandi, Franceschini\u2019s spokesperson. \u201cAnd the ministry will reinforce the restrictions already in place for Caff\u00e8 Greco, which must remain the spectacular place that it is and cannot be developed into another type of business.\u201d", "description": "Caff\u00e8 Greco has welcomed patrons from Charles Dickens to Princess Diana \u2013 but a rent hike is forcing the management company out", "authors": ["Angela Giuffrida"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b68235946ae67a805ae90b79fd4db2cfcd6987e/0_0_5231_3138/master/5231.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=6160b6be81c80fbebdec04d24fc84cbc", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
