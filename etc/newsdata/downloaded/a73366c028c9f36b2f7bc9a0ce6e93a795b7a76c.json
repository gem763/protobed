And then as a club we move forward, and as a team we play well.\n\n\u2018I have to say it\u2019s always great when you manage to, as a club, do something with your own product, because this is always the ultimate target for everybody.\n\n\u2018You try to make sure that people go through your programme, you make them better, and then they actually reach the level where you can put them in the first team, you don\u2019t have to look elsewhere.\u2019\n\nCech will be in Prague to watch England take on his native Czech Republic in their Euro 2020 qualifier on Friday night and he is thrilled to see so many Chelsea youngsters making the step up to international level.\n\nHe continued: \u2018I\u2019m obviously proud for the club and for everybody who contributed to their development, but I have to say though that the biggest credit goes to the players.\n\n\u2018If the player doesn\u2019t have the work ethic and the heart, or he doesn\u2019t put the hard work in obviously they never reach the heights and the level needed to be in the national team and play in the Premier League.\n\nCech returned to Chelsea in a newly created technical role over the summer (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018As Frank said many times during the last few weeks, all these players deserve to be in his team, that\u2019s why he\u2019s picking them for the line-ups and the games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They perform, they work hard and they are performing at a level to keep their places in the team and they are also very competitive.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s great as well that it helped them to go to the national teams. I think in some circumstances they have as well the chance to make their debut with the national team, which would obviously be great.\n\n\u2018I will see them very closely because I am going to the game in Prague, I will be at the stadium, so I hope to see some of them in action, but we\u2019ll see how the game goes.\u2019", "description": "Petr Cech has praised Chelsea\u2019s youngsters for cementing their places in Frank Lampard\u2019s starting XI, though says this is \u2018just the start\u2019 and they must keep on applying themselves.
