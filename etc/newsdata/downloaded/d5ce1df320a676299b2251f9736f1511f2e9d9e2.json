Ralph Abraham (R-LA) told Breitbart News Sunday that Democrats\u2019 impeachment \u201cinsanity\u201d has \u201cenergized\u201d Louisiana Republican voters ahead of the gubernatorial election.\n\nCongressman Abraham spoke with Breitbart News Sunday host Matthew Boyle while flying to his next campaign stop.\n\nSometimes on the campaign trail you have to learn to multi-task. Thanks to @mboyle1 and @BreitbartNews for letting me call into your radio show mid-flight! #lagov #Doc4Gov pic.twitter.com/v9U93lPgEN \u2014 Dr. Ralph Abraham (@DocAbraham) October 7, 2019\n\nRep. Abraham flies himself and key staff around the state in small airplanes and helicopters he owns while campaigning for the Republican nomination for governor. Abraham hopes to unseat Democrat Gov. John Bel Edwards. Read Boyle\u2019s profile on Rep. Abraham here.\n\nThe Louisiana conservative\u2019s interview with Breitbart News Sunday follows reports a record number of Louisianans have voted early.\n\nAbraham said Republicans have been turning out in \u201cdroves\u201d in October 12 jungle primary election.\n\nThe Louisiana Republican said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s (D-CA) drive towards impeachment \u201cinsanity\u201d has \u201cenergized\u201d Republicans to vote in the gubernatorial election.\n\nAbraham said, \u201cThey are going to come out en masse to show not only support for us in the gubernatorial election but to show support for this president. They know that this impeachment inquiry is foolish, it\u2019s going nowhere.\u201d\n\nThe Louisiana Republican also blamed Democrat Edwards\u2019 business climate for the closure of Bayou Steel, which resulted in nearly 400 layoffs. Abraham contended President Trump\u2019s America First trade policies help, not hurt, American steel companies.\n\n\u201cAmerica First under President Trump would actually embolden and help American steel. Bayou Steel went out of business strictly because of our legal climate, our tax climate, and our business climate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are the worst in the economy in the nation. We are the only state in the nation that lost jobs. The president and vice president are doing phenomenally to bring business into the country.\u201d\n\nNot only voting for a gubernatorial election, you\u2019re revolutionizing our state and get it on the right track. We are sending the message to our great president that we have his back.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News Sunday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 7:00 P.M. to 10:00 P.M.
