But another 44 people died in the chaos surrounding the evacuation of the area around the nuclear plant, prosecutors said. They attributed the deaths to negligence on the part of the executives, who they said had failed to properly plan for the possibility of a nuclear accident in spite of repeated warnings. None of the deaths were attributed to radiation-related illnesses.\n\nThe three executives argued that they could not have anticipated the damage caused by the unprecedented disaster, and the court appeared to agree on Thursday.", "description": "Three former leaders of Tokyo Electric Power Company had been charged with criminal negligence over their roles in the meltdown at the plant in 2011.", "authors": ["Ben Dooley", "Eimi Yamamitsu", "Makiko Inoue"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/19/world/19japannuclear-1/19japannuclear-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
