Travel expert puts it to the test", "language": "en", "text": "Advertisement\n\nIf you pay over \u00a35,000 for a one-way ticket on Singapore Airlines, what do you get for your money?\n\nAn awful lot, it turns out \u2013 because that huge lump of cash will secure you a \u2018Suites\u2019 class cabin, touted as one of the very best passenger aircraft seats available to humanity.\n\nTo find out just how good it is, a travel expert from The Points Guy UK put it to the test recently on a flight from London Heathrow to Singapore, and published an eye-popping video of the journey to the aviation site\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\nThe Points Guy UK Head of Video Jean Arnas flew Suites class from London Heathrow to Singapore. He's pictured here lolling on his suite's double bed\n\nThe lucky reviewer was The Points Guy UK Head of Video Jean Arnas \u2013 and his footage begins at Heathrow\u2019s Terminal 2, where he\u2019s taken by buggy to the first-class lounge and then to the gate.\n\nOnce on the aircraft \u2013 an Airbus A380 - we see him turning left into a first-class cabin wonderland.\n\nHe is in seat 1A, one of six suites, and it comes with astonishing perks, such as Krug Champagne, caviar starters, a wardrobe big enough for an adult to fit inside \u2013 which Jean hilariously demonstrates \u2013 a reclining seat and a bed.\n\nJean told MailOnline Travel: \u2018The space is completely surreal. Having 50 square feet onboard feels super luxurious. And because I had no neighbour next to me they also gave me the other half, so I had 100 square feet to myself.\u2019\n\nJean explained that the back two suites on the left and right are solo suites and the front two on the left and the front two on the right can be joined up.\n\nJean told MailOnline Travel: \u2018The space is completely surreal. Having 50 square feet onboard feels super luxurious'\n\nJean's suite came with astonishing perks, such as Krug Champagne, caviar starters and a wardrobe big enough for an adult to fit inside \u2013 which Jean hilariously demonstrates\n\n'It was the best flight of my life,' said Jean\n\nThe single beds can then be turned into a double bed for couples - or very lucky solo travellers like Jean.\n\nHe said that aside from the sheer size of the suite, the best bits of the flight were the service, which he described as \u2018incredible, super friendly\u2019, the food and drink, such as \u2018fancy salmon and caviar\u2019 and \u2018exceptional\u2019 beverages such as Dom Perignon and Krug Champagne, and the airport buggy service, which he said was \u2018a fun surprise\u2019.\n\nAnd any minuses? Yes, apparently.\n\nHe continued: \u2018There is not a public area to relax in, like the bar that Emirates and Etihad have on the same A380 aircraft, or \"The Loft\" on Virgin. There are no showers like on the Emirates A380 and Etihad A380. The toilet is really nice but a shower takes things to an outrageous next level.\u2019\n\nHowever, he still concluded that the suites experience exceeded his expectations.\n\nThe Suites class cabin comprises six suites, two purely for solo travellers, and four that can be joined together\n\nJean said that \u2018exceptional\u2019 beverages such as Dom Perignon and Krug Champagne were among the highlights of the flight\n\nHe said: \u2018It was better than I was expecting. The crew were even nicer, food was much better, drinks were flowing, and the cabin was bigger than I thought. It was the best flight of my life.\u2019\n\nWhether Suites class represents value for money really depends on whether you\u2019re a millionaire or not.\n\nThough Jean points out that a suites class ticket can be bought for pocket money if you use a big stash of air miles.\n\nHe added: \u2018Taxes can be minimal especially when starting your journey in Asia. Nicky Kelvin, The Points Guy UK Director of Content flew from Bali via Singapore to London [on suites class] for just \u00a319 and 125,000 KrisFlyer miles [you can learn how to do this here]. One way flights are around \u00a35,000 so you\u2019d really have to have big money to blow for a cash ticket to make sense.\u2019\n\nFor more information on travel tips and tricks, sign up to The Points Guy UK.", "description": "A travel expert put Suites class to the test recently on a flight from London Heathrow to Singapore, and published an eye-popping video of the journey to YouTube.", "authors": ["Ted Thornhill", "Mailonline Travel Editor"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/19/13/19921910-0-image-a-44_1571487264351.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
