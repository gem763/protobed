A giant resort city is being planned in an attempt to lure Western vacationers to a land with a reputation as a forbidding, alcohol-less place.\n\nFemale tourists are still required to dress conservatively but will no longer need to cover their bodies with traditional robes that are still required for Saudi citizens \u2014 a move intended to appeal to Western female travelers, Saudi officials has opened up the country\u2019s borders to women traveling alone.\n\nThe tourism minister explained that he does not believe his industry will be impacted by the Sept. 14 attacks that briefly knocked out the world\u2019s largest oil processing facility.\n\n\u201cOur cities are among the most safest cities globally,\u201d Mr. Khateeb said. \u201cTherefore, we don\u2019t believe at all it will impact our plans. We have all the expats living in Saudi Arabia, enjoying Saudi Arabia. We\u2019re very secure.\u201d\n\nBut the image questions and doubts about the limits of its economic liberalization plan have not dissipated. Wednesday marks the one-year anniversary of the killing of dissident, U.S.-based journalist Jamal Khashoggi by top agents of the Saudi government, and Riyadh received another blow Monday when the credit rating agency Fitch cut the kingdom\u2019s sovereign credit rating from A+ to A, citing the tensions in the region and the vulnerability of key Saudi assets in the wake of the oil facility attacks.\n\nThe agency said in a note it believed \u201cthere is a risk of further attacks on Saudi Arabia, which could result in economic damage.\u201d\n\nBut the Saudis say they have restored production lost in the Sept. 14 attack more quickly than many outside analysts had predicted, and Riyadh insists it will proceed with a closely watched public sale of stock in the state-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco, a centerpiece of hard-charging Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman\u2019s \u201cSaudi 2030\u201d modernization plan.\n\n\u201cAnything relating to Aramco is tied to the Saudi 2030 plan,\u201d Anthony H. Cordesman, a strategy expert for the Center for Strategic and International Security, told The Washington Times.\n\nSaudi Aramco is seeking $1 billion in bids from banks to finance projects following the attacks, according to Reuters. The company has not confirmed what projects the money will fund.\n\n\u201cThis is a critical priority for Saudi Arabia,\u201d Mr. Cordesman said. \u201cThere\u2019s a crisis. It is an opportunity, in an odd sense, to kind of monetize the damage, but it is not a sign that somehow the kingdom desperately needs $1 billion to support Aramco.\u201d\n\nSaudi Aramco has said that its oil production capacity has bounced back to over 11 million barrels per day, equal to production levels before the attacks.\n\nWhile experts are confident that the company and industry can rebuild, Mr. Cordesman said it is unclear how much money and resources the Kingdom wants to invest in immediate affairs while the industry remains vulnerable to future attacks.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s assuming this is over \u2026 [because] you put money into fixing something that\u2019s proved vulnerable before you can improve the defenses,\u201d he continued.\n\nBut new figures out Monday found that even before the attack, the Saudi economy was struggling to gain altitude. Government data Monday reported that economic growth slowed to just 0.5% in the second quarter of 2019, down from 1.66% in the first quarter of 2019 and from 2.2% growth in 2018.\n\nBut in a hopeful sign for the crown prince\u2019s diversification program, the slowdown was attributed largely to oil shipment cuts. The no-oil Saudi economy expanded by almost 3% \u2014 the fastest pace in four years.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
