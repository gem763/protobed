And he was forced to withdraw from the China Championship through illness.\n\nIn the past Robertson lost his passport in the build-up to the German Masters in 2011.\n\nHe said on Twitter yesterday: \u201cWhen I realised there was a second Barnsley it was too late to get to the other one. Hopefully I\u2019ll be able to either play or complete a match this season.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by a user on the platform how he had managed to forget where a venue was that he has played at before, Robertson responded: \"A friend always drives me to qualifiers but he selfishly entered a Challenge Tour event this weekend.\"\n\nEnglishman Burns has now been put into the tournaments finals which take place in Yushan in China later this month.", "description": "The Australian went to Gloucestershire rather than the Yorkshire-based venue where he has played before", "authors": ["Hector Nunns", "Image", "Vcg Via Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20466182.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_World-Snooker-Shanghai-Masters-2019-Day-6.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
