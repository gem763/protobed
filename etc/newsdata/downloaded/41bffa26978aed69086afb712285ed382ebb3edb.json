That disparity presents a huge danger that could rock WeWork to its foundation if the economy were to stall.\n\nRead all of BI's WeWork coverage here.\n\nThe paperwork WeWork filed last week ahead of its planned public offering had lots of numbers in it.\n\nBut two sets of related figures stood out: $4 billion and $47.2 billion on the one hand, and 15 months and 15 years on the other.\n\nThe first pair of figures represents lease obligations: $4 billion is how much the coworking company is due to receive from its clients in coming years, mostly by the end of 2020; and $47 billion represents the lease obligations that WeWork must pay to its own landlords, with the vast majority of that amount not coming due until after 2024.\n\nThe second set of figures represents lease durations. Fifteen months is the average lease commitment of WeWork's customers. Fifteen years is the average length of the leases WeWork is signing with building owners.\n\nWith those four numbers, you basically have WeWork's business model \u2014 it signs long-term leases on properties that it turns around and subleases for relatively short durations. But those numbers also clearly illustrate the big risk facing WeWork. Even as the company has attracted larger corporate customers and persuaded them to sign longer contracts, its own obligations have outpaced its clients' commitments by more than a factor of 10.\n\n\"They've got big long-term liabilities, and if the people who are their customers don't have long-term commitments to them, the risk is high,\" said Robert Siegel, a lecturer in management at Stanford Graduate School of Business. \"Forty-seven billion dollars,\" he continued, \"is a lot of money.\"\n\nWeWork touted the $4 billion and 15-month numbers\n\nAs might be expected, WeWork was much more eager to highlight some of those numbers than others.\n\nIn the filing for its initial public offering, the company bandied about the $4 billion number, which it described as its \"committed revenue backlog.\" It touted the fact that the backlog had grown by about eight times, from $500 million, in just 18 months.\n\nWeWork CEO Adam Neumann. Michael Kovac/Getty Images for WeWork\n\nOverall, the company mentioned the $4 billion figure at least eight times, starting on page four of the document, right in the part where it's pitching its stock offering to investors. WeWork also mentioned the number further down in a section where the company explained how it expected to fare in a downturn \u2014 a big concern of potential shareholders.\n\n\"We believe that the growth in committed revenue backlog provides greater visibility and predictability of our future revenue to help mitigate the impact of short to medium-term downturns in the economy,\" the company said in the filing.\n\nIt gave a similarly prominent place to the 15-month figure. That figure too has grown recently, it noted on page four. At the beginning of December 2017, the average contract its customers were signing was just eight months. It also argued that these lengthening contracts would help it in a recession.\n\n\"Going forward, we believe that we are well positioned to navigate through further economic downturns,\" the company said.\n\nIt wasn't so eager to highlight the $47 billion number\n\nBut the company didn't seem nearly as eager to highlight the other two numbers. It mentioned the $47.2 billion figure only three times and the 15-year figure just four times. It didn't bring either of them up until page 26, buried within a section of the document devoted to the risks to its business, a section often ignored because it's typically filled with boilerplate, cover-your-derriere-type items.\n\nForty-seven billion dollars is a lot of money.\n\nHowever much WeWork wanted to tout or bury the particular numbers, the four numbers have to be taken together to understand the company's real business model. For all of its attempt to portray itself as a tech company \u2014 it mentions the word \"technology\" some 93 times in its filing \u2014 those numbers show its business is really more akin to that of a car- or furniture-rental company \u2014 or that of its coworking pioneer IWG, said Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University.\n\n\"This is a company that buys assets and [arbitrages] them\" \u2014 takes advantage of price discrepancies \u2014 \"through selling them short term,\" Galloway said, continuing, \"Hertz does the same thing.\"\n\nRead more: NYU professor calls WeWork 'WeWTF,' says any Wall Street analyst who believes it's worth over $10 billion is 'lying, stupid, or both'\n\nTaken together, the two sets of figures are also key to understanding the real risk WeWork faces. In an economic downturn, it may not have enough revenue coming in to match all the money it's committed to spending. The contracts WeWork's customers have with it will most likely give them much more flexibility to renegotiate their leases than WeWork's contracts with its own landlords will give it.\n\nJeff Langbaum, a real-estate industry analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, said WeWork's business model would work \"as long as the economy holds up.\"\n\n\"If there's a pullback,\" he continued, and its customers start dropping their spaces or forcing the company to lower their rent, \"WeWork is still on the hook for whatever leases it has signed for the long term.\"\n\nWeWork has tried to insulate itself from its lease commitments\n\nWeWork has protected itself from some of this risk. Most of its leases are held by so-called special-purpose entities. That structure means those particular obligations are held by subsidiaries that are legally separate from their corporate parent. If the company got into trouble filling particular properties, it could put those subsidiaries into bankruptcy and protect the larger corporation.\n\nWeWork has occupied buildings around the world, including this space in Shanghai. Courtesy of WeWork Of the $47.2 billion in outstanding obligations, WeWork's corporate parent itself has guaranteed only $4.5 billion. It has another $1.6 billion in letters of credit, security deposits, and surety bonds it's also committed toward paying those obligations. But that leaves some $41.1 billion that's essentially unguaranteed and that WeWork could walk away from in a downturn.\n\nBut it may not be as easy as all that. Its landlords would almost certainly try to enforce their agreements with WeWork if it tried to skip out on them. It also would face reputational harm \u2014 and a huge risk to the future of its business \u2014 if it started sending its subsidiaries into bankruptcy and having them default on their loans instead of keeping up with the rent they owe.\n\n\"If one of the SPEs were to default, no landlord's ever going to rent to a WeWork SPE after that,\" said Walter Johnston, who focuses on the real-estate market as a vice president of credit ratings at the research firm Morningstar.\n\nEven shorter term, the company could see its revenue and cash flow constrict markedly if it started shuttering some of its subsidiaries. That decline in cash flow could still imperil the corporate parent, even if it's able to protect itself from the outstanding leases.\n\n\"At the end of the day, it's cash flow that WeWork had been receiving that it's no longer receiving,\" Langbaum said. In a downturn, he continued, \"we don't know, exactly, how their business will hold up.\"\n\nBut WeWork's customers could have an easier time breaking their agreements\n\nAnd while the $47.2 billion number may not be all it seems, given the special-purpose entities and WeWork's limited corporate guarantees, neither is the $4 billion in lease commitments that WeWork said it had. Indeed, that number may be more at risk in a downturn than the larger figure.\n\nIn its filing, WeWork noted that the vast majority of its leases with landlords didn't include any kind of early-termination clauses. By contrast, the contracts its clients sign with it are much more flexible. As it noted in the document, many of its customers can cancel their deals with only a month's notice. That's part of the intrinsic appeal of WeWork \u2014 there's no need for members to commit to a long-term lease.\n\nThis 4 billion has to be massively discounted.\n\nAnd even customers who have signed up with WeWork for longer terms would most likely have a relatively easy time breaking their agreements, said Tom Smith, a cofounder of Truss, an online commercial real-estate marketplace. In addition to its short-notice provisions, the company often asks for much smaller security deposits and has much lower early-termination fees \u2014 when it requires them \u2014 than other landlords, he said.\n\nWhat's more, traditional landlords often require individual business owners to personally guarantee that they will pay their leases, Smith said. Those guarantees provide an incentive for the owners to avoid defaulting on those obligations, even if their businesses start struggling, because they, and not just their corporations, are on the hook.\n\nBut Smith said he'd never seen WeWork, which lists space on his site, ask for a personal guarantee as part of its member contracts.\n\n\"It's almost a feature of WeWork's membership agreement that it does not,\" he said.\n\nThere's no way to tell from the company's filing how much of its $4 billion revenue backlog number would be at risk in a downturn in which its clients start terminating their agreements early or simply default on them. It would be good to know \u2014 but WeWork doesn't disclose \u2014 what portion of a member's outstanding lease obligation it typically recovers when the member cancels or defaults, Smith said.\n\nBut thanks to the ease with which WeWork members can get out from under their commitments, Smith thinks WeWork could see only a small portion of that backlogged revenue in the case of a downturn.\n\n\"This 4 billion has to be massively discounted,\" he said. \"This 4 billion,\" he continued, \"is not like another real-estate company's 4 billion in revenue backlog, I assure you.\"", "description": "The two numbers illustrate just what kind of business it's in \u2014 and their huge difference in size show its risks.", "authors": ["Troy Wolverton"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d5dc80d00ef2b0e825f2fac?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-08-21"}
