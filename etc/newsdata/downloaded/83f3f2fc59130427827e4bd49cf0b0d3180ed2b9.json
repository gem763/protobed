Speaking before the House Financial Services Committee this morning, Minhaj said the episode of Patriot Act focused on the student-loan debt crisis \u201creally hit home with our audience,\u201d illustrating his point by revealing that after polling his live studio audience at the time, he learned that they alone were in over $6 million in student-loan debt.\n\nMinhaj went on to note that the members of the Financial Services Committee paid far less for college than the millennial generation. \u201cWe looked up where the 60 members of this committee went to college and what your school\u2019s tuition was at that time, even adjusting for inflation, college costs way less across the board,\u201d he said. \u201cOn average, this entire committee graduated from college 33 years ago and paid an inflation-adjusted tuition of $11,690 a year. Today, the average tuition at all of your same schools is almost $25,000. That\u2019s a 110 percent increase over a period of time when wages have gone up only 16 percent. So people aren\u2019t making more money, and college is objectively way more expensive. You see what\u2019s happened? We\u2019ve put up a paywall to the middle class.\u201d\n\nLike he did in Patriot Act, Minhaj singled out predatory loan services like Navient. \u201cNow look, we know the deck is stacked against student borrowers in ways that it wasn\u2019t 10 or even 15 years ago, and they deserve some basic protections. Americans should not have to go bankrupt pursuing higher education, and they should never be preyed upon by underregulated loan-servicing companies. So, members of this committee, we know the government is capable of stepping in during a financial crisis, so really all I\u2019m asking today is: Why can\u2019t we treat our student borrowers the way we treat our banks? Because 44 million Americans \u2014 that is too big to fail.\u201d Minhaj closed his statement by saying \u201cThank you so much for your time, and I will now go back to where I came from,\u201d which prompted an extremely amused look from Maxine Waters.\n\nElsewhere during the hearing, Minhaj asked Florida representative Bill Posey if he was familiar with Lil Uzi Vert while bringing up the trend of fans asking celebrities to pay off their student-loan debt. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge problem that the youth of America have to bombard their favorite rapper or pop musician and ask them to pay back their student loans. They\u2019re not even asking for selfies anymore,\u201d Minhaj said. \u201cAre you a fan of Taylor Swift? Are you a Swiftie? \u2019Cause even her fans have gone up to her and said \u2018Will you please pay back my student loans?\u2019 That\u2019s how desperate student borrowers are.\u201d\n\n.@HasanMinhaj just asked Rep @congbillposey if he knew @LilUziVert, or if he was a Swiftie --as he made the point that borrowers are so desperate they're asking celebrities for help paying off their #StudentLoans pic.twitter.com/mij1FsFU67 \u2014 AFR (@RealBankReform) September 10, 2019\n\nWhen asked about doing research for his episode of Patriot Act by Colorado representative Ed Perlmutter, Minhaj called out Navient for intentionally misleading borrowers and called it \u201cthe Comcast of loan servicing\u201d and \u201can arranged marriage you can\u2019t get out of.\u201d\n\n\"@Navient is like the Comcast of student loan servicing\"\n\n\n\n--@hasanminhaj to @RepPerlmutter on the abuses of student loan servicers. pic.twitter.com/rvliwNYdFG \u2014 AFR (@RealBankReform) September 10, 2019\n\nRepresentative and former Real World star Sean Duffy framed an argument by saying \u201cthe smarter the kid, the better school they get into\u201d and tried to get the panel on board by saying, \u201cHere\u2019s the idea: If you have a 20 on your ACT you\u2019re not going to Harvard.\u201d Minhaj offered up a counterpoint: \u201cOr, if your mom\u2019s Aunt Becky, you can just pay your way to USC \u2026 You and I, we\u2019re both former MTV stars. You get it!\u201d\n\n.@hasanminhaj tells Rep Sean Duffy that sometimes \"Aunt Becky\" is what gets you into Harvard, and: \"we're both former MTV stars.\" Not everyone can rely on that MTV check! \ud83e\udd23 (Duffy wasn't happy) pic.twitter.com/5gGfxlgFMH \u2014 AFR (@RealBankReform) September 10, 2019\n\nWe\u2019d offer more reactions, but Maxine has it covered:", "description": "Comedian, \u2018Daily Show\u2019 alum, and \u2018Patriot Act\u2019 host Hasan Minhaj testified before Congress today on the topic of the student-loan debt crisis, calling it \u201ca paywall to the middle class\u201d and calling Navient \u201cthe Comcast of loan servicing.\u201d", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/09/10/10-hassan-minhaj-testify.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
