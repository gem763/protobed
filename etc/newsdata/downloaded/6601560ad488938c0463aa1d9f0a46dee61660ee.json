Sales rose from $56.58 billion a year ago, but earnings declined from $5.75 a share, the first time Amazon earnings have shrunk year-over-year since June 2017. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $4.59 a share on sales of $68.83 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nAmazon had been on a run of record profits until last quarter, when increased spending on the transition to one-day delivery for Prime customers and other initiatives began showing up in its results. The e-commerce giant reported profit topping $10 billion in 2018, more than triple its previous annual record, and had reported record quarterly profit totals for four consecutive quarters before breaking that streak with second-quarter results.\n\nSee also: Antitrust fears muted as Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook approach earnings\n\n\u201cWe are ramping up to make our 25th holiday season the best ever for Prime customers \u2014 with millions of products available for free one-day delivery,\u201d Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos said in Thursday\u2019s earnings announcement. \u201cCustomers love the transition of Prime from two days to one day \u2014 they\u2019ve already ordered billions of items with free one-day delivery this year. It\u2019s a big investment, and it\u2019s the right long-term decision for customers.\u201d\n\nAmazon\u2019s forecast for the holiday quarter came in short of estimates for both profit and sales, as the company predicted net revenue of $80 billion to $86.5 billion with operating income of $1.2 billion to $2.9 billion. Analysts on average were predicting fourth-quarter operating profit of $4.19 billion on sales of $87.39 billion, according to FactSet, after Amazon reported operating income of $3.79 billion on revenue of $72.38 billion in the holiday quarter a year ago.\n\n\u201cSignificant investments tied to the rollout of one-day shipping will depress Q4 profits, we assume compounded by the shorter holiday shopping window,\u201d Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian said in a note after the numbers hit.\n\nIn a conference call Thursday afternoon, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said that Amazon\u2019s holiday-season guidance for a revenue-growth decline from the third quarter to the fourth quarter was mostly related to the international e-commerce business. Specifically, he noted that India\u2019s Diwali festival took place completely in the fourth quarter last year and started in the third quarter this year, while Japan increased its consumption tax beginning Oct. 1.\n\nUh-oh: New S&P 500 highs were riding on blockbuster results from Amazon\n\nAmazon shares increased 1.1% to $1,780.78 in the regular session Thursday, then plunged toward $1,650 a share in after-hours trading after results were announced. The stock has gained 18.6% in 2019, but declined more than 10% in the past three months, as the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.19% fell about 0.5%.\n\nAmazon prepped investors and analysts for the spending increase and resulting profit decline, projecting an $800 million charge in the second quarter for the one-day delivery change. Amazon ended up spending more than that in the second quarter, however, and Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said in July that Amazon would spend even more in the third quarter.\n\nOlsavsky said in the call that the fourth quarter will see even larger costs from one-day delivery efforts.\n\n\u201cSo, as we head into Q4 we\u2019ve added what\u2019s just nearly $1.5 billion penalty in Q4 year-over-year for the cost of shipping, which essentially is transportation costs, the cost of expanding our transportation capacity, things like adding additional roles and shifts in our warehouses,\u201d the Amazon CFO said.\n\nAmazon\u2019s worldwide spending on shipping jumped 46% year-over-year in the third quarter to a record $9.6 billion, more than a half-billion dollars over what Amazon spent in the busier holiday season a year ago. The company, which cut back on hiring a year ago after absorbing the Whole Foods workforce and hiring quickly in 2017, also increased its total employee count by 22% to 750,000 people. Amazon added nearly 100,000 employees just in the third quarter, according to Thursday's release, which Baird analyst Sebastian deemed the \u201cmost surprising metric\u201d in the report.\n\n\u201cThe biggest driver at this time is the people that we\u2019re adding for fulfillment and transportation roles, especially as we head into Q4 and add this additional transportation capacity to service one-day [delivery],\u201d Olsavsky said when asked about the third-quarter hiring.\n\nSee also: How to find great holiday toys without relying on a sponsored list from Amazon\n\nAmazon Web Services, Amazon\u2019s leading cloud-computing business, reported revenue of $9 billion and operating income of $2.26 billion, 71.6% of Amazon\u2019s total operating profit. Revenue grew 35% from the year before, down from a growth rate of 46% at the same time last year, as declining growth rates for cloud-computing services such as Microsoft Corp.\u2019s MSFT, +1.97% Azure continue to be an issue for the largest players.\n\nThe domestic e-commerce business provided net sales of $42.64 billion and operating income of $1.28 billion, while international operations recorded an operating loss of $386 million on sales of $18.35 billion. Amazon\u2019s brick-and-mortar retail offerings produced their lowest quarterly revenue total since Whole Foods Market was officially absorbed in 2017, with $4.19 billion in net sales falling 1.3% from the year before and 3.2% sequentially.", "description": "Amazon.com Inc. profit fell for the first time in more than two years in the third quarter, and the company expects another earnings decline in the...", "authors": ["Jeremy C.
