They've actually become good friends of ours.\"\n\nShe added: \"I never blamed him. He brought Becky back to me.\"\n\n(Image: Godden Family / SWNS)\n\nThe taxi driver killer was eventually convicted of murdering Becky in 2016 - 13 years after killing her.\n\nHe was handed a whole life order for Becky's murder, meaning he is likely to die behind bars without ever being eligible for parole.\n\nThe case has now been serialised in an ITV drama, called A Confession.\n\n(Image: Wiltshire Police/PA)\n\nJudge Mrs Justice Cox ruled both of Halliwell's confessions were inadmissable as evidence because Fulcher had breached Police and Criminal Evidence Act guidelines.\n\nAccording to the PACE rules, he should have cautioned the killer and given him access to a solicitor after discovering that Sian was dead.\n\nAn investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission in 2013 found the police officer had a case to answer for gross misconduct for ignoring force orders.\n\n(Image: SWNS.com)\n\nThe following January Det Supt Fulcher was found guilty of gross misconduct and given a final disciplinary warning.\n\nFulcher made the decision to resign from Wiltshire Police force in May, 2014.\n\nHe has maintained that he made the decision not to escort Halliwell back to the police station because he felt it was important to take the opportunity to find Becky's body.\n\n(Image: PA Archive/PA Images)\n\n\"That man is a hero. He brought Becky home \u2014 if he hadn\u2019t done what he did, Halliwell would never have shown him where she was\", said Karen.\n\n\"If it hadn\u2019t been for DS Fulcher, Becky would still be in that field, and I would not know if my daughter was alive or dead.\"\n\nKaren also stuck in for DS Fulcher at the time of the trial. She said: \"It's really going to be such a waste of an extremely experienced detective who I know has solved so many crimes,\"\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\n\"Had he have followed the guidelines, then Becky would never have been found, she would have never have come into the equation and Sian would have still have been where he moved her to.\n\n\"No-one would have found Sian in a million years where they found her, where he dumped her body.\n\n\"It was Steve Fulcher's experience. OK, he bent rules - but he bent them for good reason.\"\n\n(Image: Family handout/PA)\n\nSian\u2019s mother Elaine Pickford is also grateful to DS Fulcher.\n\nSpeaking on To Catch A Serial Killer - With Trevor McDonald, Elaine said: \u201cSteve did what I think any family member would want an officer to do for them.\u201d\n\nToday Halliwell remains locked up in the Category A HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire. He has three children with his ex-wife Lisa.\n\n*The final episode of A Confession airs tonight at 9pm on ITV", "description": "The mother of Becky Godden-Edwards does not resent the detective who caused the case against her daughter's murderer to fall apart, and they are in fact friends", "authors": ["Verity Sulway", "Image", "Rex", "Godden Family", "Swns", "Wiltshire Police Pa", "Swns.Com", "Pa Archive Pa Images", "Itv", "Family Handout Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article9009207.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_Karen-Edwards.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
