The jury had to choose between life in prison without parole or a death sentence.\n\nThe same jury last month convicted Haskell of capital murder in the 2014 killings of Stephen and Katie Stay at their home in suburban Houston. The jury rejected his attorneys\u2019 efforts to have him found not guilty by reason of insanity.\n\nHaskell killed the couple and four of their children in the living room of their suburban Houston home in 2014. A fifth child, 15-year-old Cassidy Stay, was shot in the head but she survived by playing dead.\n\nAfter the sentence was announced, Cassidy Stay, now 20, read a victim impact statement from the witness stand, saying she had initially had felt \u201churt and anger\u201d after learning that Haskell felt no remorse for killing her family.\n\n\u201cMy closure was the hope that you would feel bad \u2026 I\u2019m letting go of my emotions and I\u2019m giving it to God because he\u2019ll take care of me and he\u2019ll help me through this,\u201d said Stay, adding she would continue to live \u201cmy life with happiness\u201d and forget about Haskell.\n\nDuring closing arguments in the punishment phase of Haskell\u2019s trial earlier Friday, Harris County District Attorney\u2019s Office prosecutor Kaylynn Williford described the terrifying scene as Haskell fulfilled his plan to kill his ex-wife\u2019s family.\n\nWilliford described how Haskell shot 4-year-old Zach in the shoulder \u2014 an injury he could have survived \u2014 and said the frightened child scurried in the chaos to his father on a couch, burying his head in his father\u2019s shoulder for protection.\n\nBut by that point, Zach\u2019s father was already dead, Williford said.\n\n\u201cHe scrambles over to his father, because that\u2019s what little boys do,\u201d Williford said.\n\nHaskell then went over to Zach, pointed a gun to the back of his head and pulled the trigger, she said.\n\n\u201cHow cold and vengeful do you have to be to take the life of a 4-year-old?\u201d Williford said.\n\nCassidy Stay, now 20, was in court on Friday and cried when Williford detailed the killing of her family. At least one juror also wiped away tears. Stay testified at trial, which began Aug. 26, that she begged her uncle \u201cplease don\u2019t hurt us\u201d before Haskell opened fire.\n\nDefense attorneys argued hard for a life sentence.\n\nNeal Davis III said the 39-year-old man should spend the rest of his life thinking about what he has done and \u201cdie in prison.\u201d\n\nDoug Durham told jurors that at the heart of prosecutors\u2019 arguments for a death sentence is \u201canger, hatred, fear, vengeance because of this terrible, terrible crime.\u201d\n\nDurham said Haskell\u2019s long history of mental illness, in which he was treated by multiple doctors, should be considered by the jury as a mitigating factor in deciding that life in prison would be a more appropriate sentence. His attorneys said Haskell heard voices that told him to kill his ex-wife\u2019s family.\n\nDurham urged jurors to consider \u201ccompassion and forgiveness\u201d instead of \u201chate, anger\u201d when making their decision.\n\nBut prosecutor Lauren Bard told jurors that Haskell\u2019s \u201cissue is not his mental illness, his issue is his personality,\u201d describing him as a \u201cmanipulative, selfish, narcissistic, blame-shifting monster.\u201d\n\nProsecutors said Haskell had faked symptoms of mental illness and had meticulously crafted a plan to hurt anybody who helped his ex-wife, Melannie Lyon, after the couple divorced, traveling from California to Texas to carry out the killings.\n\nTo impose a death sentence, jurors had find Haskell would be a future danger to society and that any mitigating factors \u2014 such as mental illness \u2014 were insufficient to merit a lesser sentence.\n\nBesides Stephen and Katie Stay and their son Zach, Haskell also killed 7-year-old Rebecca; 9-year-old Emily; and 13-year-old Bryan. Katie Stay was Lyon\u2019s sister.\n\nProsecutors only needed to charge Haskell with two of the deaths to get to capital murder. In cases with multiple murders, it is a common trial strategy for prosecutors to not charge the deaths all at once in case legal issues arise and new indictments are needed.\n\nAfter the shooting, he reloaded his gun and headed to the homes of Lyon\u2019s parents and brother so, according to prosecutors, he could complete his vengeful plan. He was arrested before reaching any other homes.\n\nDuring the trial\u2019s punishment phase, relatives of the Stays told jurors how their lives were devastated by the killings.\n\nHaskell\u2019s brother testified that his sibling \u201cstill has good in him.\u201d\n\nAfter Friday\u2019s verdict, Cassidy Stay told reporters she hopes what\u2019s she experienced will give others strength to face difficulties in their own lives.\n\n\u201cI did not think I would lose my whole family in a matter of seconds. If I can get through this, you can get through what you\u2019re going through and you\u2019re going to be OK,\u201d Stay said.\n\n___\n\nFollow Juan A.
