She had no idea what I was saying\u2019", "language": "en", "text": "\u2018\u201cShe would come to my house to teach me English, and I would teach her Uzbek,\u201d remembers Akmal. \u201cBut my motive,\u201d says Sarah, \u201cwas to get as physically close as I could \u2013 so how do you turn a lesson into a date?\u201d They ended up kissing.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t real life, but a scene they developed and performed as part of a theatre course in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in 2009. Akmal was from Uzbekistan; Sarah, from the US. Both had enrolled for three years at the renowned Ilkhom Theatre of Mark Weil.\n\n\u201cEverything we felt chemically and emotionally was on stage for everyone to see,\u201d says Sarah. \u201cOur professor saw it, our classmates saw it. We were like, \u2018We\u2019re just kissing because it\u2019s a sketch.\u2019 But it was heated. It was very magnetic.\u201d\n\nAkmal remembers her arriving at the start of the course. \u201cShe was all big eyes, in shock, just waving at everyone,\u201d he says. He invited her for an ice-cream at the end of one day, but with neither able to communicate with the other, Sarah turned him down. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know how to appropriately say \u2018no\u2019,\u201d she says. \u201cBody language was different, gestures were different. Then the next time he asked was in December, and I said: \u2018Yes\u2019 \u2013 and that was the first spark of maybe something.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t speak any English. I couldn\u2019t even say \u2018an ice-cream\u2019,\u201d says Akmal. It was awkward, says Sarah with a laugh. They spent about half an hour together, smiling at each other.\n\nShe hadn\u2019t been expecting to meet someone. \u201cI was so focused on school I couldn\u2019t fathom getting involved with someone. But there was something about Akmal that drew me in. He had this smouldering gaze and he was secretive, almost, very hard to read. I felt that in certain exercises he opened up and I was like: \u2018How can I engage with this further?\u2019\u201d Akmal was similarly intrigued. \u201cShe was a person with huge freedom. Even though I didn\u2019t understand most of the things she said, the way she spoke and communicated, she seemed like a free person, which I wanted to be.\u201d\n\nA date to an old Soviet-era theme park in February was the moment, says Sarah, \u201cwe just knew we were connected beyond this sketch, and beyond language\u201d. Her Russian was better by this point. \u201cThere was almost a language of our own developing,\u201d she says. \u201cWe could intuitively understand each other, based on gazes, or touch, or a certain shift in mood.\u201d\n\nShe says she remembers not wanting the day to end. Akmal helped her with some grocery shopping, then invited her back to his place for supper. \u201cHe lived 45 minutes away and he still took me home at night. I remember getting out near the big bazaar and it was snowing and I just felt so safe for the first time in my five months there. It was a magical moment, it was like a fairytale.\u201d\n\nOne spring afternoon, she told him she loved him. He laughed \u2013 at her bad Russian, Sarah thought. \u201cAnd then he said: \u2018I\u2019m laughing because I\u2019ve told you so many times before, you just didn\u2019t understand me. Of course I love you.\u2019 It was a sublime moment, great joy.\u201d \u201cI had been telling her many times, in Uzbek,\u201d he says. \u201cI would talk to her and she would sit and listen, but she had no idea what I was saying. I was just talking about her eyes, her smile, and I would always say: \u2018I love you.\u2019\u201d\n\nSarah had promised her parents she would finish her degree in the US, and she gets tearful talking about leaving Akmal at the airport at the end of the theatre course (they had also been separated during the summers). \u201cWe had no idea how, but we just knew we\u2019d be together,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we didn\u2019t end up seeing each other for 14 months.\u201d They talked over Skype and by email. \u201cJust waiting for that call, I couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d says Akmal. \u201cI couldn\u2019t somehow feel complete.\u201d\n\nAkmal was twice denied a visa to visit Sarah in the US, so they decided a fiance visa was their best chance. \u201cWe got secondhand rings at the bazaar,\u201d says Sarah. \u201cThey had a little celebration for us at the theatre.\u201d It took another seven months to get Akmal a visa, but in October 2014 he arrived in the US; they got married that month.\n\nSarah is Jewish; Akmal is Muslim. Why has their relationship worked across countries and cultures? \u201cI didn\u2019t care about the cultural things,\u201d says Akmal. \u201cIt just felt right and she was the right person.\u201d Sarah says: \u201cI remember being without him, it felt like I was missing a limb. We\u2019d learned about each other in such intimate, subtle ways that we fuelled off of being together. Even apart, we maintained that.\u201d\n\nWant to share your story?
