You know that, I know that, we all know that. I\u2019ve watched Adam Schiff leak, he\u2019s a corrupt politician,\u201d Trump said during an impromptu press conference at Andrews Air Force Base.\n\nSchiff released a statement in the wake of the news of Baghdadi\u2019s death, which criticized the president for not telling Congress\u2019 \u201cGang of Eight\u201d about the mission.\n\n\u201cHad this escalated, had something gone wrong, had we gotten into a firefight with the Russians, it\u2019s to the administration\u2019s advantage to be able to say, \u2018We informed Congress we were going in, they were aware of the risks. We at least gave them the chance to provide feedback.\u2019 That wasn\u2019t done here. I think that\u2019s a mistake,\u201d Schiff said on Sunday.\n\nTrump also criticized Schiff on Monday for his \u201ccriminal\u201d handling of the House impeachment inquiry, which began over the president\u2019s July 25 phone call with Ukraine, saying he would focus on the \u201cdetails\u201d of the case, instead of the \u201cprocess.\u201d\n\n\u201cProcess is wonderful, we already have 50 Republican senators, I never called one of them, \u2018sign up.\u2019 Out of 53, 50; and perhaps the other ones will do it too. But process is good, but I think you ought to look at the case, and the case is very simple, it\u2019s quick, it\u2019s so quick. I had a great conversation with the Ukrainian president,\u201d Trump said. \u201c . . . They tried to take that conversation and make it into a big scandal. The problem was, we had it transcribed, it was an exact transcription of the conversation. So, in a nutshell, a whistleblower wrote a false narrative of the conversation.\u201d\n\n\u201cAdam Schiff went before Congress, and Adam Schiff what he did, will never be forgotten. He made up a conversation that was a phony fabrication. It was a fraud, and people shouldn\u2019t be allowed to get away,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey say he has immunity, because he\u2019s a member of Congress. People shouldn\u2019t be allowed to do that, that\u2019s a criminal act, what he did, that\u2019s a criminal act.\u201d\n\nThe president repeated Monday that the White House is \u201cthinking about\u201d releasing footage of the mission that killed the ISIS leader.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "President Trump on Monday explained that he withheld news of the night raid that resulted in the death of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi from the House Intelligence Committee to prevent Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) from leaking the information.\u201cThey were talking about why didn\u2019t I give the information", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.igmXUSteJaXEc2BSOQSnw--~B/aD01OTc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/064f21a7fe066fe6610c9e64688230cc", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
