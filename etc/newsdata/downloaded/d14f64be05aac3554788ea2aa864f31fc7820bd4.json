That's why the Democrats are trying to turn this inside-out. To immunize Biden and to attack Trump, but it won't work,\" he argued, accusing Biden of obstructing justice while he was vice president to protect his son and a future presidential bid.\n\nHunter Biden had been investigated related to his ties to a Ukrainian energy company.\n\nUKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER DEFENDS TRUMP'S CALL WITH ZELENSKIY: 'I THINK THERE WAS NO PRESSURE'\n\nBiden said in the past that the U.S. would withhold $1 billion in loan guarantees from Ukraine if the prosecutor was not fired, but it remains unclear if this was directly tied to Hunter Biden\u2019s case, as other countries reportedly wanted the prosecutor out as well.\n\nFLURRY OF HOUSE DEMOCRATS BACK IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY, AMID BOMBSHELL REPORTS TRUMP WITHHELD UKRAINE AID\n\nLevin scoffed at the media's reporting about a whistleblower who reported President Trump had exerted pressure on the president of Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, possibly holding up a military package for Ukraine, as well.\n\nHe said he's \"sick and tired\" of the president's conversations with foreign leaders being leaked to the media and to Democrats.\n\n\"I don't remember a damn one of those happening to Obama or any other president. Our president has to be able to speak to other heads of state without this kind of tyranny taking place!\" he said.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLevin noted that Ukraine's foreign minister insisted there was \"no pressure\" from Trump in the July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, but that remark \"doesn't fit the narrative\" that the mainstream media wants to present.\n\nThe Trump administration pushed back Tuesday in the wake of multiple reports that the White House froze millions in aid to Ukraine shortly before Trump pressured the country's leader to investigate Joe Biden and his son.\n\nThe reports coincided with a renewed round of calls, including from more centrist Democrats, for a formal impeachment inquiry. Those calls came a day after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested she is opening the door to that route if the administration continues to withhold a whistleblower complaint apparently related to Trump's Ukraine discussions.\n\nLevin will interview author Peter Schweizer, who has written extensively about the Bidens' business dealings, on Sunday at 10 p.m. ET on Fox News' \"Life, Liberty & Levin.\"\n\nFox News' Brooke Singman contributed to this report.", "description": "Fox News host Mark Levin said on \"Hannity\" that the media is trying to protect 2020 presidential contender Joe Biden from scrutiny over his son's business dealings in Ukraine.", "authors": ["David Montanaro", "David Montanaro Is A Senior Editor With Fox News."], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/levin-biden.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
