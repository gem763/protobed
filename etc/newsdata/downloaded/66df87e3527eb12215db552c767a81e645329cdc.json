At first, I thought that last scene was just the end, or close to it \u2013 Danny (Sam Duke), a white high school kid in Los Angeles whose parents bought his way into Stanford, discovers their doctored picture of him sailing (for he is now, unbeknownst to him, a sailing recruit), then begs his friend (who also wants Stanford, and is not a double legacy, and is also not white) to believe him. He didn\u2019t know, he cries. This movie had already seemed to posit Danny, with his stifled music ambitions and parents who keep track of his algebra III tests, as the real victim of the story, so it seemed like a possible-enough ending. It certainly felt like I\u2019d been watching for enough time.\n\nFrom Fyre festival to Hustlers: why are we so obsessed with scammers? Read more\n\nActually, my internet had just cut out. I rebooted and clicked where I thought I was in the timeline \u2013 the far end \u2013 only to realize I had fully a third of the movie left. Both my friend and I exclaimed \u201cthat CANNOT be right\u201d, and that is the most telling and confounding thing I can say about a movie on one of the buzziest, schadenfreude-y and generally outrageous scandals of the year.\n\nYes, this year. Operation Varsity Blues \u2013 the FBI sting which exposed a conspiracy of coaches, SAT proctors, and parents to purchase spots at elite colleges to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars \u2013 only came to light seven months ago. That Lifetime turned around a movie this quickly is genuinely impressive, and evidence of the public\u2019s insatiable appetite for a scandal that makes the very rich look fallible, exposes the elite college racket for what it is, and produces innumerable jokes at Aunt Becky\u2019s expense. There will almost certainly be an audience for this \u2013 the behind-the-scenes treatment of the open-kitchen conversations and delusions the federal complaint captured to spectacular effect \u2013 which makes the movie\u2019s dullness all the more baffling.\n\nIn part, that\u2019s because the movie totally ignores (perhaps for legal reasons) one of the most fascinating elements of Operation Varsity Blues: its overlap of brazen entitlement and actual fame. Varsity Blues implicated the Hollywood actors Felicity Huffman and Lori Laughlin, whose daughter, the Instagram influencer Olivia Jade, was widely mocked for her posts about having no interest in school. The Lifetime movie, however, avoids all of this fodder, instead focusing on two families, names changed, so desperate to \u201cdo anything to help my kid\u201d that it includes paying Rick Singer (name not changed), a college fixer, to guarantee admission. Caroline Devere (Penelope Ann Miller), an interior designer, is supposed to be the more sympathetic figure, so wrapped into the cult of elite schools that she crosses the ethical Rubicon for Danny, who just wants to wait tables and play in bars. Meanwhile, Bethany Slade (Mia Kirshner), pitched as the compulsively watchable Machiavellian figure, forks over $500,000 to Singer to get her daughter Emma (Sarah Dugdale) into Yale.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not here to criticize the quality of \u201ca Lifetime movie\u201d, of which I have admittedly seen few. The genre has its role and its appeal \u2013 a quick hit of emotion with little investment, a peek-behind-the-curtain take on drama more fascinating than we want to admit. Its cardinal sin is not bad cinematography, but being deathly boring. It is supposed to be entertaining, and provide through that entertainment a new angle on scandal \u2013 catharsis through adjacency to the most extreme emotions or situations one could feel. The movie has bribes, family blowouts and late-night criminal strategizing, and yet none of it feels fresh or even guiltily enjoyable. The real coverage is far more fascinating.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Shanks, Mia Kirshner, Penelope Ann Miller and Sam Duke in The College Admissions Scandal.

Bethany \u2013 a Blair Waldorf figure, if Blair Waldorf failed to account for FBI wiretaps \u2013 justifies looping Emma into the scam by invoking social Darwinism. Caroline admires how she can write off the bribe as a donation to underserved children. Danny angrily runs up a wooded hill in ripped black skinny jeans and flings himself to the ground in disgust, which is unintentionally hilarious. Emma\u2019s boyfriend, a freshman at Yale, is absolutely not a freshman in college, but he does get to say the line: \u201cThis calls for Pimm\u2019s cup the second I get back!\u201d\n\nThese moments are genuinely enjoyable, in a cheap, cringe-y way. But they can\u2019t transcend a movie that focuses on the parents \u2013 time that inevitably sympathizes with their desperation even as it\u2019s supposedly mining their folly for entertainment. Bethany\u2019s no-fucks-given warpath is supposed to be condemnable, but she\u2019s also still the star.\n\nStill, it\u2019s a lot of thought for a movie that is, frankly, not that interesting, and perhaps never would be. The college admissions scandal was so galling, jammed so hard on the hot buttons of race and class and opportunity in America, that it was probably never going to fit in the frame of a Lifetime movie. By genre, it\u2019s going to go for the titillating, the flashy, the voyeuristically compelling. There\u2019s plenty of that in the real Varsity Blues scandal, but not in this movie.", "description": "A quickie dramatisation of one of the year\u2019s most thrilling stories has somehow become one of the year\u2019s dullest films", "authors": ["Adrian Horton"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f16285da648e036177c2fb482c50f7b3c22a427a/0_302_6048_3628/master/6048.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=cd6f3e8e141065cb14efc2ce5541982e", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
