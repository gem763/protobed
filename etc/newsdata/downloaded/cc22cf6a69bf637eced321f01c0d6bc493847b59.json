MORE is scheduled to appear Thursday before three House committees in highly anticipated testimony that could shed more light on the Ukraine controversy roiling the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nGordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, was blocked from testifying last week by the Trump administration. The White House initially vowed not to cooperate with the House impeachment inquiry into allegations that the president abused his office by urging a foreign leader to deliver political dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden Joe BidenWarren defends, Buttigieg attacks in debate that shrank the field Five takeaways from the Democratic debate in Ohio New study: Full-scale 'Medicare for All' costs trillion over 10 years MORE. It\u2019s unclear if the State Department will attempt to prevent his appearance this time. But Democrats have subpoenaed the wealthy hotel magnate, and his lawyers have indicated he intends to comply.\n\nSondland will be the sixth witness to testify in the Democrats\u2019 investigation, and he could prove to be among the most controversial. Sondland, a former businessman who donated $1 million to the president\u2019s inauguration committee, has emerged as a vocal Trump loyalist who quickly defended the president\u2019s Ukraine dealings in the face of concern from other leading U.S. diplomats.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nText messages turned over to Congress this month by Kurt Volker Kurt VolkerMulvaney helped organize controversial Ukraine meeting State Dept. official told to 'lay low' after voicing concerns about Giuliani: Dem lawmaker Top State Department official arrives for testimony in impeachment probe MORE, the administration\u2019s former special envoy to Ukraine, revealed that Volker and Sondland had sought to entice Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into launching an anticorruption investigation into Biden, a top 2020 presidential contender, and his son by dangling promises of a meeting with Trump if Zelensky agreed.\n\nThe text messages also reveal a conversation last month between Sondland, Volker and William Taylor, the current charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires for Ukraine, in which Taylor seemed to express grave concerns that Trump was making the release of U.S. military aid to Ukraine contingent upon Zelensky\u2019s decision to investigate the Bidens.\n\n\u201cAs I said on the phone, I think it\u2019s crazy to withhold assistance for help with a political campaign,\u201d Taylor wrote in a Sept. 9 message.\n\nSondland replied, \u201cBill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump\u2019s intentions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president has been crystal clear no quid pro quo\u2019s of any kind,\u201d Sondland wrote. \u201cThe president is trying to evaluate whether Ukraine is truly going to adopt the transparency and reforms that President Zelensky promised during his campaign. I suggest we stop the back and forth by text.\u201d\n\nSondland reportedly consulted with Trump before sending the text on the \u201cno quid pro quo\u201d claim.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, however, reported this month that Sondland had told Sen.

Ron Johnson. And he said that, basically, the reason why Ukrainian aid was being held up was because the Ukrainians had not yet agreed to an investigation of the Bidens,\u201d Rep.

Many Republicans were disappointed last week when the State Department blocked Sondland\u2019s testimony, which GOP lawmakers see as potentially exonerating the president of wrongdoing.\n\nStill, as both sides are seizing on details to support their competing narratives, it is said that Sondland wants the opportunity to share his side of the story to set the record straight.\n\nSondland\u2019s rescheduled appearance, however, comes amid increased scrutiny of his role in carrying out Ukraine policy, which does not fall under his umbrella as a diplomatic representative to the European trading bloc.\n\nFiona Hill, Trump\u2019s former leading Russia expert, testified before House investigators earlier this week that Sondland was grouped with other Trump officials who were assisting Trump and Giuliani in their contacts with Ukraine.\n\nAnd other experts have raised concerns that Giuliani, Sondland and others conducted a shadow diplomacy with Ukraine, one which falls outside of the normal channels.\n\nHill told House investigators that then-national security adviser John Bolton John BoltonOvernight Defense \u2014 Presented by Boeing \u2014 Trump isolated amid Syria furor | Pompeo, Pence to visit Turkey in push for ceasefire | Turkish troops advance in Syria | Graham throws support behind Trump's sanctions Democrats see John Bolton as potential star witness Syria furor underscores Trump's isolation MORE was so alarmed by what he heard about Trump\u2019s contacts with Ukraine that he instructed her to notify the chief lawyer for the National Security Council about the efforts of Giuliani, Sondland and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney John (Mick) Michael MulvaneyState Dept. official told to 'lay low' after voicing concerns about Giuliani: Dem lawmaker Democrats see John Bolton as potential star witness The Hill's Morning Report - Trump grapples with Turkey controversy MORE, The New York Times reported this week.\n\n\u201cI am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,\u201d Bolton told Hill, according to her reported testimony.", "description": "A key diplomat and donor to President Trump is scheduled to appear Thursday before three House committees in highly anticipated testimony that could shed more light on the Ukraine controversy roiling the nation\u2019s capital.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/sondlandgordon_051419getty_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
