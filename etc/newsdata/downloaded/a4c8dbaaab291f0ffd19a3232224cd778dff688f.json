REUTERS/Mohamed Abd El Ghany.\n\nOn Friday, the dollar strengthened against the safe-haven yen to as high as 108.63 yen JPY=, its highest since August 1, before U.S. President Donald Trump said the United States and China had reached a 'Phase 1' trade deal.\n\nIt pared those gains after Trump announced the agreement, covering agriculture, currency and some aspects of intellectual property protections.\n\nIn Asian trade on Monday, the dollar inched down to 108.34 yen, while the euro stood at $1.1034 EUR= versus the greenback, off Friday's three-week high of $1.10625.\n\nWith Tokyo\u2019s market closed for a public holiday and the United States also seeing partial market closures for Columbus Day, trading volumes would likely remain lighter than usual.\n\nAnalysts said the further gains in the dollar/yen may be limited because the partial deal between the world\u2019s two largest economies appeared to lack substance with limited progress on structural issues such as technology transfers.\n\nThe trade deal \u201clooks more symbolic than substantial, and might be better described as simply an \u2018interim trade war truce,\u2019\u201d said Ray Attrill, head of FX strategy at National Australia Bank.\n\n\u201cThis Phase 1 agreement, if inked, does little to immediately brighten the outlook for global trade and growth. While it shouldn\u2019t prevent the Fed from agreeing to cut rates by another quarter point on Oct. 30, it doesn\u2019t provide a firm pretext for significant or sustained U.S. dollar depreciation.\u201d\n\nThe deal represents the biggest step between the United States and China in a 15-month trade dispute. Friday\u2019s announcement did not include many details and Trump said it could take up to five weeks to get a pact written. He acknowledged the agreement could fall apart during that period, though he expressed confidence that it would not.\n\nSTERLING\n\nThe British pound surged on Friday to as high as $1.2708 GBP=D4, its strongest since July 1, and a five-month peak of 86.955 pence per euro EURGBP=D4, on optimism about orderly Brexit.\n\nOn Monday, cable's rally ran out of steam and was last traded at $1.2610 GBP= in Asia, 0.28% lower on the day.\n\nThe EU agreed on Friday to hold another round of intense negotiations with London in a bid to break the deadlock and secure a deal before the Oct. 31 deadline.\n\nEU negotiator Michel Barnier and his British counterpart Stephen Barclay earlier held what both sides called a \u201cconstructive\u201d meeting in Brussels. The British and Irish prime ministers said on Thursday they had found \u201ca pathway\u201d to a possible deal, and by Friday some officials were expressing guarded optimism.\n\nOn Sunday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told his cabinet a last-minute deal was still possible as the two sides pressed on with intensive talks to try to avoid a disorderly Brexit on Oct. 31.\n\nBritain said there would be more talks on Monday, with Johnson hoping a deal will be agreed in time for EU leaders to approve it at a summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday this week.\n\nBut he will still have to convince a deeply divided British parliament to ratify the agreement, while the European Commission said \u201ca lot of work remains to be done\u201d in a statement issued late on Sunday.\n\n\u201cBrexit talks between the UK and the EU will continue today. With the EU Council meeting to take place on Oct. 17-18, Brexit headlines will be the main focus for this week,\u201d said Daria Parkhomenko, FX strategist at RBC Capital Markets.", "description": "The dollar held near a 2-1/2-month high against the yen on Monday on signs of progress in U.S.-China trade talks, while sterling's rally ran out of steam after touching a 3-month peak on hopes for an orderly British exit from the European Union.", "authors": ["Tomo Uetake", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191014&t=2&i=1440539411&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9D01E", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
