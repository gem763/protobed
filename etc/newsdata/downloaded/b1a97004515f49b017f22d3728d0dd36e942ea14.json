Lawyers and politicians have also criticised the move.\n\nMeanwhile climate change protesters targeted the Department for Transport and MI5 on Tuesday morning.\n\nA government spokeswoman said protests \"should not disrupt people's day-to-day lives\".\n\nExtinction Rebellion's co-founder, Gail Bradbrook, was arrested after climbing on to the entrance of the Department for Transport on Tuesday morning. Police also cleared further protesters from outside the building.\n\nActivists have also been arrested on Millbank outside MI5's headquarters, where a small group had gathered. Two men briefly sat in the middle of the road before being moved by officers.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police began clearing protesters from Trafalgar Square on Monday evening following the announcement of new restrictions under Section 14 of the Public Order Act, which required activists to stop their protests in central London by 21:00 BST or risk arrest.\n\nThe force said it decided to impose the rules after \"continued breaches\" of conditions which limited the demonstrations to Trafalgar Square.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Protesters who camped out in Trafalgar Square have now been moved on\n\nExtinction Rebellion said it had taken the \"first steps\" towards a judicial review of the Met's \"disproportionate and unprecedented attempt to curtail peaceful protest\".\n\n\"Our lawyers have delivered a 'Letter before Action' to the Met and asked for an immediate response,\" a statement read.\n\nTobias Garnett, a human rights lawyer working for the movement, said the letter warned police to withdraw the order, giving them a deadline of 1430 BST to respond, or else the group would file a claim in the High Court.\n\n\"We will be looking for an expedited hearing either today or tomorrow morning,\" he added.\n\nThe Met confirmed it had received \"pre-action judicial review correspondence\" alleging Human Rights Act breaches.\n\n\"The letter will be reviewed by the Met's Directorate of Legal Services, and we will respond to the claimant in due course,\" a statement read, adding it would be \"inappropriate\" to comment further.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption There was a large police presence at the Department for Transport\n\nMayor of London Sadiq Khan has said he is \"seeking further information\" about the decision to impose the ban and why it was necessary.\n\n\"I believe the right to peaceful and lawful protest must always be upheld,\" he said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the government said the UK was \"already taking world-leading action to combat climate change\".\n\nThe statement added: \"While we share people's concerns about global warming, and respect the right to peaceful protest, it should not disrupt people's day-to-day lives.\"\n\nHome Secretary Priti Patel tweeted that \"supporting our [police] is vital\" and accused the Labour Party of supporting \"law breakers\".\n\n'Overreach of powers'\n\nMeanwhile, lawyers have also questioned whether the ban by police is legal.\n\nAnti-Brexit barrister Jo Maugham QC said the move was \"a huge overreach\" of police powers, while human rights lawyer Adam Wagner described it as \"draconian and extremely heavy-handed\".\n\nMr Wagner added in a tweet: \"We have a right to free speech under article 10 and to free assembly under article 11 of the (annex to the) Human Rights Act. These can only be interfered with if the interference is lawful and proportionate. I think the police may have gone too far here.\"\n\nSkip Twitter post by @AdamWagner1 We have a right to free speech under article 10 and to free assembly under article 11 of the (annex to the) Human Rights Act.

These rights are not absolute - the state can curtail them.\n\nHowever, the BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said: \"The test, if and when it gets to a human rights court battle, is whether police action was proportionate to the threat and only what was strictly necessary.\"\n\nBy law, the organiser of a public march must tell the police certain information in writing six days in advance.\n\nPolice have the power to limit or change the route of the march or set other conditions.\n\nA Section 14 notice issued under the Public Order Act allows police to impose conditions on a static protest and individuals who fail to comply with these can be arrested.", "description": "The group says it has taken steps towards legal action over the restriction of protests in London.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/64AD/production/_109237752_5ad9ddc3-d415-4c10-a0c7-32711154100d.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
