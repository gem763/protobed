REUTERS/Brian Snyder/File Photo\n\nKnown to investors through frequent ads on television for his investment advice, Fisher already lost Michigan as a client last week.\n\nThe setbacks for Fisher come in the wake of the #MeToo movement, which has exposed widespread patterns of sexual harassment or abuse of women in multiple spheres of American life and ended the careers of dozens of powerful men in media, politics, entertainment and business.\n\nPhiladelphia\u2019s board of pensions terminated Fisher Investments as an investment manager because of \u201cinappropriate statements\u201d made at a conference last week, a city spokesman said on Tuesday. The city\u2019s retirement system had roughly $54 million under management with Fisher, the spokesman said.\n\nFidelity Investments criticized the money manager over the remarks, saying it was reviewing the $500 million Fisher\u2019s firm manages for the mutual fund giant.\n\n\u201cWe are very concerned about the highly inappropriate comments by Kenneth Fisher. The views he expressed do not align in any way with our company\u2019s values,\u201d Fidelity spokesman Vincent Loporchio said. \u201cWe do not tolerate these types of comments at our company.\u201d\n\nIn a memo to his firm\u2019s employees sent to Reuters by a spokesman, Fisher said \u201cIt pains me to know that my comments have caused you grief, concern, and indignation. I sincerely apologize.\u201d\n\nFisher Investments manages money within the $8 billion Fidelity Strategic Advisers Small-Mid Cap Fund (FSCFX.O). His firm manages more than $100 billion, including at top U.S. public pension funds.\n\nAn attendee at the conference, Alex Chalekian, chief executive of a financial advisory firm, called attention to the comments Fisher made at the October 8 conference in a video he posted on Twitter a day later that went viral.\n\nHe said Fisher had made derogatory comments about genitalia, picking up girls and financier Jeffrey Epstein, among other topics. Epstein committed suicide in August while being held in jail awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.\n\nCharles Roame, managing partner of conference organizer Tiburon Strategic Advisors, said in a note on the firm\u2019s website that comments made at the conference on October 8 \u201clacked the dignity & respect that should be expected by any Tiburon CEO summit speaker or attendee.\u201d\n\nAlthough he did not name Fisher, Roame praised Chalekian for going public \u201cwith his views of offensive behavior.\u201d\n\nOn October 10, Michigan\u2019s $70 billion retirement system dropped Fisher Investments over the remarks, according to a letter sent to the state\u2019s investment board. Fisher had managed $600 million for the retirement system, money that will now be managed internally.\n\nFisher Investments is also a sub-adviser on the $600 million Goldman Sachs Multi-Manager Global Equity Fund.
