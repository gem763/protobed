REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein/File Photo\n\nZuckerberg, Facebook\u2019s founder, won some praise for agreeing to lengthy talks behind closed doors with officials ranging from President Donald Trump to a long list of lawmakers.\n\nTrump posted a photo with Zuckerberg on Twitter and called their Oval Office session on Thursday a \u201cnice meeting.\u201d Facebook called Zuckerberg\u2019s discussion with Trump \u201ca good, constructive meeting\u201d but neither side disclosed specifics.\n\nThe company faces a barrage of criticism from members of both parties and the public over issues ranging from political bias to privacy lapses, election-related activity and its dominance in online advertising.\n\nAn advertising powerhouse, Facebook also faces antitrust investigations by the Federal Trade Commission and a number of state attorneys general, as well as numerous legislative proposals that seek to restrict how it operates. Facebook may also face an antitrust probe by the U.S. Justice Department.\n\nSenator Mark Warner, a Democrat who arranged a dinner for Zuckerberg with other senators Wednesday night, told Fox Business Network, \u201cFacebook leadership realizes that failure to have federal legislation (on internet issues) is actually going to hurt them and the whole platform industry in the long run.\u201d\n\nAfter the dinner, Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said he had brought up Facebook\u2019s \u201crepeated failures\u201d in election security and consumer privacy. \u201cWe had (a) serious, substantive conversation even when we may have differed,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nAnother critic was Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican who has accused Facebook of suppressing conservative speech. After meeting with the Facebook founder Thursday, Hawley said discussions had been \u201cfrank,\u201d often a euphemism for contentious.\n\nHawley urged Zuckerberg to sell Facebook\u2019s Instagram and WhatsApp units, which would limit how much information it could compile about an individual.\n\n\u201cSafe to say he was not receptive to those suggestions,\u201d Hawley said dryly.\n\nZuckerberg was in no mood to talk to reporters between meetings, refusing over and over again to offer even the barest assessment of the discussions.\n\nAlso on Friday, Facebook said it had suspended tens of thousands of apps on the social networking platform, its first major update on an ongoing app developer audit it began in March 2018 to prevent a repeat of the Cambridge Analytica scandal.\n\nRep. David Cicilline, chair of the U.S. House Judiciary Committee\u2019s antitrust panel, said Friday that Zuckerberg pledged cooperation with the panel\u2019s probe into online markets.\n\nThe House of Representatives Judiciary Committee opened an investigation into competition in digital markets in June, one of a series of investigations facing big tech companies like Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc, Facebook and Alphabet Inc\u2019s Google.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nLast week, the panel demanded emails, detailed financial information and other company records from the four companies\u2019 top executives. They have until Oct. 14 to produce the documents.\n\nWhile lawmakers like Hawley and Blumenthal seemed unsatisfied with Zuckerberg\u2019s responses, Senator Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, took a milder tack.\n\n\u201cI encouraged him to come to the table, help us out and this is not an adversarial role from my perspective,\u201d Collins said, noting they did not discuss whether Facebook will comply with the document requests. \u201cI think with their involvement you are going to see a lot more participation.\u201d", "description": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrapped up three days of discussions with Washington movers and shakers on Friday, with few if any indications he had won new \"friends\" to help the top social media company deal with multiple probes by Congress, state attorneys general and federal regulators.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Bryan Pietsch", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190920&t=2&i=1432132519&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8J25Y", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
