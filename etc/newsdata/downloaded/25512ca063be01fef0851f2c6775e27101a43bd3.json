USA TODAY\n\nAndrew Booth Jr. had plenty of time to ponder his mistakes this weekend.\n\nThe Clemson Tigers cornerback rode the managers' bus home from Louisville, Kentucky, instead of finding his seat on the team plane, head coach Dabo Swinney said, because he was ejected for punching a Cardinals player in the helmet Saturday.\n\n\"He rode back on our manager bus, that's where it started,\" Swinney told reporters, per ESPN. \"The rest of it will be handled in-house.\"\n\nThe journey from Louisville to Clemson, South Carolina, is about 438 miles.\n\nBooth Jr. became tangled with Louisville's Trenell Troutman on a punt play in the third quarter.
