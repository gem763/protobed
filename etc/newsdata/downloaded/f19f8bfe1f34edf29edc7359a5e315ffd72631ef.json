An unexpected decline in U.S. retail sales in September also weighed on risk assets.\n\nHere were the main moves in the market, as of 9:31 a.m. ET:\n\nS&P 500 (^GSPC): -0.22%, or 6.66 points\n\nDow (^DJI): -0.19%, or 51.87 points\n\nNasdaq (^IXIC): -0.38%, or 31.99 points\n\nCrude oil (CL=F): -0.02% to $52.80 per barrel\n\nGold (GC=F): +0.63% to $1,492.80 per ounce\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a bill broadly supporting pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong. As part of the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, the State Department would be required to annually review whether the Hong Kong remained \u201csufficiently autonomous\u201d from China to justify its special trading status with the U.S. Hong Kong protestors had called for the passage of this legislation, with pro-democracy demonstrations now having continued more than four months in the region.\n\nThe bill, passed unanimously by voice vote in the House, lays a framework for sanctions agains officials deemed to undermine freedom and autonomy in Hong Kong. A similar bill is also before the Senate awaiting a floor vote.\n\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry immediately condemned the House\u2019s passage of the bill and threatened retaliation.\n\n\u201cIf the relevant bill is finally passed into law, it will not only harm the interests of the Chinese side, but also damage Sino-U.S. relations, and it will seriously damage the interests of the United States,\u201d China\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson said in a statement, according to a translation. \u201cWith regard to the wrong decision of the U.S. side, China will surely take effective measures to resolutely counteract and firmly safeguard its sovereignty, security, and development interests.\u201d\n\nTraders work on the floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York, U.S., October 9, 2019.

European stocks were mixed as prospects for reaching a Brexit deal before a summit in Brussels with EU officials later this week dimmed. British and EU officials had resumed talks on Wednesday after a round of talks that went late into Tuesday, but major sticking points still remain, including whether to retain Northern Ireland as part of the U.K. customs union.\n\nThe pound (GBPUSD=X) pared some losses mid-morning in New York to just over $1.27, but remained lower against the dollar from the previous day.\n\nECONOMY: Retail sales unexpectedly fall in September\n\nRetail sales unexpectedly declined in September, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday, suggesting sluggishness in key domestic consumer activity. This marked the first drop in the headline measure of retail sales in seven months.\n\nInclusive of all categories, retail sales fell 0.3% in September from August, where an increase of this magnitude had been expected for the month, according to Bloomberg-compiled consensus data. However, August\u2019s headline retail sales were upwardly revised to see a rise of 0.6%, from the 0.4% reported previously.\n\nBeneath the headline, clothing and clothing accessory store sales led advances, with these rising 1.3% for the month. Non-store retailers \u2013 namely, e-commerce merchants \u2013 saw sales decline on a monthly basis for the first time since December, with these sales falling 0.3% in September.\n\nExcluding more volatile auto and gas sales, retail sales were flat between August and September. Consensus economists had expected to see a gain of 0.3% in this metric. As with the headline figure, retail sales excluding autos and gas were upwardly revised to a 0.4% increase in August, versus the 0.1% reported earlier.\n\nIn the \u201ccore\u201d retail sales figure \u2013 which excludes autos, gas, building materials and food sales \u2013 retail sales were unchanged between August and September, following an unrevised 0.3% gain in August. Many economists regard this as a better gauge of underlying buying trends, and it closely tracks GDP\u2019s consumer spending component.", "description": "Stock futures were off slightly in early trading as investors awaited more earnings and considered concerns that China would retaliate over U.S. legislation supporting Hong Kong protestors.", "authors": ["Emily Mccormick"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/r_IHcVzwwheTzfT5HYu2JA--~B/aD0yODA1O3c9NDIwNztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/8df4b0f0-f00f-11e9-afb3-f9ddf57f7bda", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
