REUTERS/Lindsey Wasson/File Photo\n\nSenator Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the committee, and Senator Tammy Duckworth introduced the measure that would require the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to address automation in the cockpit and assumptions about pilot response.\n\n\u201cWe want the FAA to develop tools and methodologies here ... and we want this to be considered in the design certification process,\u201d Cantwell said in an interview with Reuters on Thursday. \u201cThis is the next stage of aviation safety.\u201d\n\nThe bill\u2019s introduction comes days before Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg is set to testify on Tuesday before the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee on the fatal crashes.\n\nAn FAA spokesman declined to comment on the bill but FAA Administrator Steve Dickson said on Tuesday that the FAA and airplane manufacturers need to better scrutinize the interface between pilots and machines. He added the FAA and manufacturers must improve processes to ensure \u201cwe don\u2019t have fragmented communications\u201d on certification.\n\nCongress and independent panels have been looking at the performance of a key anti-stall safety system tied to the two fatal crashes known as MCAS. Boeing is making a series of safeguards to the system as part of its effort to get the plane airborne again, which could come by the end of 2019.\n\nThe bill would order the FAA to require Boeing to ensure the 737 MAX system safety assessments that \u201cassumed immediate and appropriate pilot corrective actions in response to uncommanded flight control inputs, from systems such as the MCAS, consider the effect of all possible flight deck alerts and indications on pilot recognition and response.\u201d\n\nIt would also require Boeing to incorporate design enhancements \u2014 including flight deck alerts and indications \u2014 including \u201cpilot procedures, and training requirements, where needed, to minimize the potential for and safety impact of pilot actions that are inconsistent with manufacturer assumptions.\u201d\n\nBoeing did not immediately comment.\n\nThe bill would direct the FAA to adopt recommendations made by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the Transportation Department\u2019s Inspector General and ICAO.\n\nThe NTSB in September said the FAA should address assumptions Boeing made in designing software systems to react to emergencies, and decide whether systems should be revised to account for varying pilot reactions to cockpit alarms.\n\nThe bill would also create an FAA Center of Excellence dedicated to studying flight automation and human factors in commercial aircraft.", "description": "Two Democrats on the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee on Thursday introduced legislation to mandate numerous aviation safety recommendations in the wake of two fatal Boeing 737 MAX crashes that killed 346 people and led to the plane's grounding in March.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191025&t=2&i=1444682546&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9O00X", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
