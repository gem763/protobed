His trial had been set for Nov. 12, but was pushed back to give expert witnesses more time to review new evidence.\n\nRivera is accused of killing Tibbetts, who disappeared while out for a run July 18, 2018, in Brooklyn, Iowa. Investigators recovered her body a month later in a cornfield. Officials say she was stabbed to death.\n\nRivera, a Mexican national, also is accused of being in the country illegally. He worked at a dairy farm a few miles from where Tibbetts disappeared.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: Daily Iowan (Campus Paper), http://www.dailyiowan.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The trial for a former farmhand charged with first-degree murder in the abduction and killing of 20-year-old University of Iowa student Mollie Tibbetts has again been delayed.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/03/04/student_killed_iowa_19948_c0-0-3000-1750_s1200x700.jpg?8fcc827e3d5c4d025cb0728722f014f10701a927", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
