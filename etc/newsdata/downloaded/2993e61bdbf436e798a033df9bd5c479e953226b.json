President George Washington decided not to commit American lives to a war that posed no immediate threat out of \u201cduty and interest\u201d to the nation, provoking James Madison to lament to Thomas Jefferson that Washington\u2019s \u201cunfortunate error\u201d \u201cwounds the National honor.\u201d\n\nThis story has reverberations in what\u2019s happening right now in Syria. President Trump removed U.S. troops from the Turkey-Syria border, stating: \u201cIt\u2019s not our border. We shouldn\u2019t be losing lives over it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nHis decision, and a deal cut between Vice President Pence and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, aroused anger from both sides of the political aisle. Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) publicly lamented that \u201cAmerican honor has already been tarnished.\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg declared during a Democratic presidential candidates\u2019 debate that Trump was \u201cundermining\u201d our \u201chonor.\u201d\n\nBut rather than necessarily exposing the moral bankruptcy of Trump\u2019s decision, what these critiques reveal is how the concept of honor is \u2014 and has virtually always been \u2014 a weapon in U.S. politics, one that allowed politicians to present themselves as patriotic while painting the opposition as anything but.\n\nHonor is an ancient global concept that typically has been associated with reputation, but during the American Revolution, a distinctly American version emerged. In the United States, honor came to be synonymous with ethical behavior \u2014 a form of secular morality in a nation with separated church and state \u2014 and advancing the good of the nation over personal interest. For the founding generation, this ethos became a deeply and widely held belief.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThen, with the formation of political parties in the late 1780s, the concept also became a potent political weapon. Politicians routinely accused opponents of failing to uphold or sacrificing American honor.\n\nIt was Washington\u2019s 1793 Proclamation of Neutrality that further separated the parties and allowed American honor to become further politicized in a way that still resonates today. Federalists, such as Alexander Hamilton, and Democratic-Republicans, such as Jefferson and Madison, each accused the other of not holding to the principles of national honor, while presenting their own party as the only guardian of the sacred concept. Far from conceding the point however, Washington, too, vowed to \u201cemploy the constitutional authority of my office, to support the national honor, and enforce that impartiality, which ought to be observed, toward the powers engaged in the present war.\u201d\n\nThe issue of the French alliance exacerbated a partisan split, whereby party loyalty became essentially the determining factor over who possessed honor. A situation in which, years later, even the party-hopping future Vice President Aaron Burr (who later killed Hamilton) could be considered \u201cpolitically honest\u201d by one side, while the other viewed him as guided by personal interest and \u201cunbound ambition,\u201d forsaking all \u201cpolitical ethics.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA few decades into the American experiment, author and historian Mercy Otis Warren worried that while \u201cevery free mind should be tenacious of supporting the honor of a national character,\u201d the \u201cparty feuds\u201d had already deeply \u201cdivided a nation\u201d and caused its citizens to \u201close sight of the sacred obligations of virtue.\u201d\n\nThe debate over the French Revolution began as an earnest attempt to define American obligations and what was the \u201cright action\u201d based on both the Alliance of 1778 and the need to maintain U.S. stability. But instead of setting out rules for American politics, long term, this push simply resulted in combatants framing their disagreements not in narrow, policy or even partisan terms, but in terms of who would uphold American honor and, in turn, the country\u2019s ideals. The language of honor was invoked during many critical political debates, including the South\u2019s secession in 1861 and the decision by the United States to depart Vietnam in 1975.\n\nWhy has the vague concept of American honor remained politically potent for more two centuries? Partly, because we\u2019ve long had fierce partisan divides. Each generation has repurposed the original Revolutionary concept along party lines. But the strength of this political weapon also stems from the fact that while all Americans have agreed about the importance of national honor, and see it as rooted in the Revolution, the concept is so malleable that it can be understood entirely through a partisan lens today. One party\u2019s action in favor of the greater good or honor of the nation can appear to be self-interested to the other, and vice versa.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nLanguage about honor is omnipresent in our politics these days, and not only with regard to Trump\u2019s treatment of the Kurds. At last week\u2019s Democratic debate, Sen. Cory Booker (N.J.) echoed the Founders when he stated his campaign was an effort to \u201crestore\u201d the \u201csacred honor\u201d mentioned in the Declaration of Independence, presumably lost during the Trump presidency.\n\nAnd just as Booker sees Democrats as ready to restore honor, in 2010 the tea party held a Restoring Honor rally, led by Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin, that saw conservatives as the side who could reclaim honor they perceived as lost by the Obama administration.\n\nThe tea party example reminds us that while charges of betraying American honor have often grabbed public attention, they have not always swayed the public \u2014 Obama was reelected \u2014 or even shaped the public\u2019s memory of these debates and fights.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nWith the benefit of hindsight, Washington\u2019s decision to maintain neutrality in the French Revolution and ensure domestic tranquility has been recognized as the prudent course of action. Despite the immediate and vocal detractions, only time will tell how Trump\u2019s handling of Syria is remembered.\n\nBut what is certain is that \u201cAmerican honor\u201d is a potent concept that divided the founding generation and has been claimed by every side in American political debates since. Rather than using it as a partisan, political sword, however, we ought to recall its roots in a Revolution designed to forge a nation of commonly held beliefs and ethical ideals. If we do that, then perhaps we can once again jointly \u201cpledge our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor\u201d to upholding these founding American values.\n\nAD", "description": "Critics who assail President Trump for sacrificing American honor are relying on an age-old tactic.", "authors": ["Craig Bruce Smith", "Craig Bruce Smith Is Author Of"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/MXJ1Wi74IAZIL6QL3pGYUMLCDMc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3CBSHUHUF4I6TMWSD434TWBNXM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
