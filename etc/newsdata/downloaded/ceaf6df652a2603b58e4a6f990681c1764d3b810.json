As such, it says the SEC shouldn\u2019t be able to request it to produce documents about its blockchain project.\n\nThe move comes in response to the SEC\u2019s request for Telegram to enter into a preliminary injunction which would prevent the messaging app from selling its tokens.\n\nBy voluntarily ceasing the sale and distribution of Gram tokens, Telegram says the injunction is no longer required. As such, it\u2019s asking the court to deny the SEC\u2018s motion for an injunction.\n\nWith all that said, it looks like messaging app\u2018s token launch won\u2019t stick to its alleged schedule. In August, Telegram promised to start delivering the first batches of the Gram tokens to investors by October 31.\n\nBy voluntarily halting the distribution of its token, Telegram still has a bit of control over how it can recommence its plans. If an injunction were to be imposed, it could blow a detrimental set-back to Telegram\u2019s plans.\n\nH/T \u2013 CoinDesk", "description": "Telegram has yielded to the US Securities and Exchange Commission over the sale of its Gram tokens, for now.
