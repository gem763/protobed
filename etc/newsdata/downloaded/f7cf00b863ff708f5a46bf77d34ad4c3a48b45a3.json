A Google spokeswoman told the Journal that the company is testing the tool with political advertisers as well as media and consumer companies.\n\nThe market for political ads has long been dominated by local TV. Political TV ad spending is set to hit $4.78 billion in 2020, compared to $2.85 billion for online and digital ads, according to the Journal.\n\nFacebook is now a major destination for campaign ad dollars, but the report noted that as Election Day gets closer, campaigns tend to refocus their advertising to videos, which are seen as more effective.\n\nYouTube\u2019s new service is allowing campaigns to target specific demographics ahead of important days. The Journal reported that during the 2018 election, Google hired consultants and pollsters from both sides of the aisle to analyze and help fine-tune YouTube\u2019s targeting of specific demographic segments.\n\nThe Journal also noted that President Trump\u2019s re-election campaign has spent at least three times as much on advertising through Google, including YouTube, as any Democratic candidate.\n\nGoogle is planning to let ad buyers reserve slots on YouTube for the entirety of 2020 starting on November 15, the report said.\n\nFollow David Ng on Twitter @HeyItsDavidNg.
