Each movement was small, slow and unsteady. But soon, the colors started to align. Four minutes later, with one more twist, it unscrambled the last few tiles, and a cheer went up from a long line of researchers watching nearby.\n\nThe researchers worked for a prominent artificial intelligence lab, OpenAI, and they had spent several months training their robotic hand for this task.", "description": "A five-fingered feat could show important progress in A.I. research.
