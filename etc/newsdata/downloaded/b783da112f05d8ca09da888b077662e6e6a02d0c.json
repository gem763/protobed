Although healthy adults usually recover from infection with E. coli within a week, young children and older adults have a greater risk of developing a form of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome, which can be life-threatening.\n\nSymptoms of E. coli infection, including diarrhea, abdominal cramping, nausea and vomiting, usually begin three or four days after exposure to the bacteria.\n\nThe CDC recommends washing fruits and vegetables before consumption and cooking meat thoroughly to prevent E. coli infections.", "description": "A 10-year-old French boy has died after struggling with years of medical complications resulting from a severe case of E. coli poisoning in 2011.", "authors": ["Alex Lasker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/b6IZYXOOYd5j5YCyyHoYcQ--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/2402x1574+21+1792/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/2019-09/a969b2d0-d96d-11e9-9bda-28147cc180fd", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
