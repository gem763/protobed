I much prefer crisps,\" she said.\n\n(Image: Tom Maddick / SWNS)\n\nHer extensive crisp selection is largely made up of Walkers, helped along by the firm's frequent calls to the public for new flavours.\n\nOver the years Ali has picked up builders breakfast, fish and chips, chilli and chocolate and onion bhaji flavoured bags.\n\nAli's next addition to her collection will be the brand's limited edition Christmas bags, which are glazed ham, Brussels sprout and pigs in blankets flavoured.\n\nHer most recent addition was a retro pack of Marathon bars which were released last month, 30 years after the brand changed its name to Snickers.\n\nAli said: \"Marathon bars are my all time favourite, I was so annoyed when they changed the name.\n\n\"It's great that they've released these retro ones but they're half the size they used to be.\"\n\n(Image: Tom Maddick / SWNS)\n\nAli's most unique and unusual item might be a tube of toothpaste which was released to commemorate the Queen's Golden Jubilee in 2002.\n\nShe keeps her ever-growing collection in suitcases under her and her husband Andrew's bed.\n\n\"We recently moved and getting rid of everything did cross my mind,\" she said.\n\n\"The collection is getting really hard to store because I can't put it in the attic otherwise all the chocolate will melt.\n\n\"But I can't bring myself to throw or give it away.\n\n\"I think I'm going to do the opposite and keep adding to it instead.\"\n\nAli said she hasn't shown her four-year-old son Oliver her stash of goodies.\n\n\"If he gets a sniff of it that will be it, the whole lot will be gone.\"", "description": "Ali Smith, from Sheffield, has paid more than \u00a320 to get hold of the right snack bar - a Marathon bar from 1982 -\u00a0 but says she prefers crisps to chocolate", "authors": ["James Andrews", "Image", "Tom Maddick", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20559512.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_CHOCOLATE_COLLECTION_08.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
