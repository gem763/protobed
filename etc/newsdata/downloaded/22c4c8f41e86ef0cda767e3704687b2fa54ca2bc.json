Sunrise Chief Executive Olaf Swantee has signaled readiness to modify financing of the deal, although the details are not yet public.\n\nSunrise said COMCO's blessing was a \"confirmation of its own view that the transaction will give it a significant competitive edge, thereby making it an even stronger competitor\" to Switzerland's dominant communications provider, state-controlled Swisscom.", "description": "Sunrise plan to buy Liberty Global's UPC gets anti-trust green light", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF8P0BQ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
