Party primaries for seats in the U.S. House of Representatives have occurred in June since 2012 as a result of a federal court ruling. The state primaries were moved to the same day to increase voter participation and save money.\n\nThe pending change would make 2020 the first year in decades that the State Assembly and Senate don\u2019t stay at the Capitol into June to act on bills. Representatives of Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Democrat from Yonkers, and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, a Democrat from the Bronx, said the schedule was still being worked out and no decisions had been made.\n\nPeople familiar with the scheduling discussions said lawmakers will stay close to the number of session days as in 2019, when they adjourned on June 21, by scheduling more votes earlier in the year. The session begins in early January, with legislative activity normally increasing before the April 1 budget deadline and in the final days before summer adjournment. The Legislature was in session on 63 days in 2019, but only met seven times in both January and February.\n\n\u201cHopefully, it will create an incentive to do more work in January and February,\u201d state Sen. Neil Breslin, a Democrat from Albany County, said in an interview.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo Photo: Scott Heins/Getty Images\n\nAs legislators discuss their own calendar, Gov. Andrew Cuomo is pushing to move the legislative primaries to April 28, the date of the state\u2019s presidential primary elections. The Democratic governor confirmed a NY1 report that he had been thinking of moving up the presidential primary to as early as February so national candidates would spend more time in New York.\n\n\u201cYou have to at least coordinate the schedules, in my opinion. Otherwise, it is all a mockery,\u201d Mr. Cuomo said during a Sept. 6 public-radio interview.\n\nRepresentatives of Mr. Heastie and Ms. Stewart-Cousins said they weren\u2019t considering any changes to the political calendar. Candidates are already required to gather nominating petitions months before an election.\n\nAN EXPENSIVE SUIT: A pair of lawsuits over the state\u2019s system of fusion voting could leave taxpayers on the hook for thousands of dollars in legal fees after Attorney General Letitia James, a Democrat, recused herself from defending the state.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James Photo: Mary Altaffer/Associated Press\n\nThe lawsuits, filed by leaders of the Working Families Party and Conservative Party, ask a judge to declare that fusion voting\u2014the concept in New York that lets political candidates appear on multiple party ballot lines and combine the votes they receive\u2014is a constitutionally protected right.\n\nThe minor parties are worried that a temporary commission to design a system of public campaign finance could end or change fusion voting rules that they have often utilized. Party lawyers filed suit in Niagara County in August, and named Mr. Cuomo, the commissioners of the state Board of Elections, the four legislative conference leaders and the eight members of the campaign finance commission as respondents.\n\nAs a result of Ms. James\u2019 recusal, seven outside firms have been retained by various parties, and the cost will be paid by the state. Mr. Cuomo has hired Michael Cardozo of Proskauer Rose LLP, and most of the campaign finance commission members hired James McGuire, a one-time counsel to former Gov. George Pataki, a Republican.\n\nMs. James\u2019 office normally represents state agencies and elected officials against lawsuits related to their official actions, but can step back if it identifies conflicts among defendants or with the attorney general herself. Kelly Donnelly, a representative for Ms. James, said the attorney general recused herself because of \u201cpotential conflicts\u201d but declined to elaborate.\n\nWorking Families Party New York State Director Bill Lipton, one of the plaintiffs in the suit, questioned the defendants\u2019 decision.\n\n\u201cThe state is about to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayer money to try to take away a right protected by the New York State Constitution,\u201d he said.\n\nTHE QUESTION: In what year did New York last hold its local primary and presidential primary on the same day? And a harder bonus question: When was the last time the state Legislature concluded its work before Memorial Day?\n\n\u2014 Know the answer? Leave a comment!\n\nTHE LAST ANSWER: Former President Clinton blames his loss in the 1980 Arkansas gubernatorial election on his decision to raise motor-vehicle fees.\n\nWrite to Jimmy Vielkind at Jimmy.Vielkind@wsj.com", "description": "The New York state Legislature could adjourn its next session before Memorial Day next year, an early exit that is being contemplated to give members time to campaign before primary elections in June.", "authors": ["Jimmy Vielkind", "Jimmy.Vielkind Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107235/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
