This would be a game changer to our national security. This would pave the way to the re-emergence of ISIS.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I hear the president say one more time, \u2018I made a campaign promise to get out of Syria,\u2019 I\u2019m going to throw up.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe took an oath of office to protect the nation against all enemies, foreign and domestic. There\u2019s no bigger enemy to our nation than ISIS. And there\u2019s no way we can protect the country from radical Islam without partners like the Kurds.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis duty as commander-in-chief, I believe, compels him to act honorably by the Kurds, and it is impossible for Turkey to go into Syria and not create a devastating ripple effect, no matter what the president says to [Turkish President Recep Tayyip] Erdogan.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
