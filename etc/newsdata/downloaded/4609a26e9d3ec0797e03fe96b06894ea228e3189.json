REUTERS/Erin Scott\n\nA whistleblower report, released on Thursday, said Trump not only abused his office in attempting to solicit Ukraine\u2019s interference in the 2020 U.S. election for his political benefit, but that the White House tried to \u201clock down\u201d evidence about that conduct.\n\nAt issue is a July 25 phone call that Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to congratulate him on his election victory.\n\nIn the call, according to a summary released by the Trump administration on Wednesday, Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who worked for a Ukrainian gas company for several years.\n\nTrump has repeatedly suggested wrongdoing by Biden and his son but has offered no evidence to back up the assertion.\n\nBiden, a former vice president, is a leading contender in the Democratic race to take on Trump in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nA growing number of Democrats say the call was an abuse of Trump\u2019s position and want to see him impeached. But the chances of the Republican president being removed from office look slim since his party controls the Senate where an impeachment trial would be held.\n\nDemocrat Adam Schiff, who chairs the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee and is one of Trump\u2019s biggest opponents, called for more people to come forward who have knowledge of the Ukraine case.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that these witnesses will choose to cooperate, will volunteer. But I have to say I am deeply worried now that the president, on the eve of our hearing or during our hearing, was threatening these witnesses,\u201d Schiff told CNN on Thursday.\n\nSchiff spoke after Trump said he wanted to know who provided information to the whistleblower, according to an audio recording provided to the Los Angeles Times by an attendee.\n\n\u201cI want to know who\u2019s the person, who\u2019s the person who gave the whistleblower the information. Because that\u2019s close to a spy,\u201d Trump can be heard saying on the recording, made during his remarks in New York on Thursday to staff from the U.S. mission to the United Nations.\n\n\u201cYou know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? The spies and treason, we used to handle it a little differently than we do now,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe White House did not dispute the comments.\n\n\u201cThreats of violence from the leader of our country have a chilling effect on the entire whistleblower process, with grave consequences for our democracy and national security,\u201d said a joint statement on Thursday night by three Democratic House committee chairmen - Schiff, Eliot Engel of Foreign Affairs and Elijah Cummings of Oversight.\n\n\u2018HERE WE GO AGAIN\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another witch hunt. Here we go again,\u201d Trump told reporters on Thursday, assailing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Democrats for launching an impeachment inquiry into him this week.\n\nTrump and his Republican allies say he was simply leaning on Zelenskiy to carry out his own campaign promise to root out corruption in Ukraine.\n\nStill, Trump\u2019s political allies are worried, given that the impeachment inquiry will likely lead to weeks or months of negative media coverage of Trump and distract from his re-election bid.\n\nThe inquiry is casting a new pall over his presidency just months after he emerged from the dark cloud cast by Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into whether he colluded with Russia in the 2016 election.\n\nThree U.S. House committees said they would issue subpoenas to the White House and State Department as soon as Friday if the Trump administration misses a deadline to send a wide range of documents related to its dealings with Ukraine.\n\nThe House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees launched an investigation into the matter early this month, before news broke about the whistleblower complaint that helped lead Pelosi to announce the formal impeachment investigation.\n\nIn a letter on Sept. 9, the chairmen of three committees set a Sept. 26 deadline for the documents to be handed over, and threatened to issue subpoenas if their request was not met.\n\nSchiff set a Friday deadline for Attorney General William Barr to hand over a range of materials, including a legal opinion or analysis related to the whistleblower complaint and Justice Department communications and correspondent about the complaint.", "description": "Democrats are urging people who might have more information about President Donald Trump's effort to persuade Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden to come forward as Trump struggles to contain the fallout from the scandal.", "authors": ["Susan Cornwell", "Makini Brice", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190927&t=2&i=1434410305&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8Q0B0", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
