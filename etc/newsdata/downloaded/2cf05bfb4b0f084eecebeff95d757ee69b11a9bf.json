He is no longer listed on the official team roster. He was the No. 5-ranked player in the nation in his class, according to the 247Sports composite.\n\nAlfano hadn't practiced with the team since Sept. 3 and was suspended for Alabama's 62-10 win over New Mexico State on Sept. 7. The reason for his suspension was not disclosed.\n\nBack on Sept. 13, Alfano's father, Frankie, said his son would enter the transfer portal. That didn't occur until Wednesday.\n\n--Sidelined for the past three games following a DUI arrest, Maryland wide receiver DJ Turner will sit out the rest of the 2019 season.\n\nThe 5-foot-9 senior is eligible for a redshirt under revised NCAA rules because he only appeared in three games this season. Turner caught four passes for 84 yards for Maryland. He also returned three punts for 107 yards and a touchdown and added one kickoff return for 22 yards.\n\nHe was arrested following an early morning traffic stop on Sept. 20 and charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, reckless driving and disobeying an officer, among other violations.\n\n--Ohio State junior linebacker Baron Browning will miss Friday's Big Ten contest at Northwestern.\n\nThe school listed Browning as out for the game on its Thursday status report. The Buckeyes don't list injuries or reasons why a player will sit out. Browning is third on the team with 23 tackles. Five of those are for losses, including 2.5 sacks.\n\nJunior left offensive tackle Thayer Munford is a game-time decision. Senior Joshua Alabi, Ohio State's third tackle, will miss the contest. Reserve sophomore linebacker Teradja Mitchell and senior receiver C.J. Saunders are also listed as game-time decisions.\n\n--Field Level Media", "description": "After more than a month away from the Crimson Tide, Alabama defensive end  Antonio Alfano officially has entered the NCAA transfer portal.A freshman, he was...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
