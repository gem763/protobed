(Mohammad Ismail/Reuters)\n\nThe main challenger to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani in Saturday\u2019s election said Thursday that a fraud-marred result \u201cwill be contested\u201d and that his supporters would not be willing to \u201csacrifice\u201d a legitimate victory at the polls.\n\nAbdullah Abdullah, Afghanistan\u2019s chief executive, did not say what he would do if massive fraud takes place, but he suggested in an interview that it would be up to Ghani to \u201cact responsibly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe results will not be accepted if there is clear evidence of fraud,\u201d Abdullah said at his residence. \u201cThe signs are not good. . . . It is not an ideal situation for the country,\u201d he added, referring to warnings by opposition groups and leaders, including himself, that Ghani and his government will try to rig the polls.\n\nThe tense election is being held under tight security; more than 2,400 of 7,400 polling centers are to remain closed because Taliban insurgents have threatened to attack them. The group has already bombed one Ghani campaign rally, killing 24 people, as well as the office of his top running mate, killing 30 others. The insurgent group has denounced the election as fake.\n\nThe Taliban renewed its threats Thursday, calling the election a foreign \u201csham\u201d and calling on \u201cfreedom-loving Afghans\u201d to boycott the polls. In an online statement, the group said it would close all roads in the country on election day and would target \u201call offices and centers that operate for this staged show.\u201d\n\n[Elections in Afghanistan: What you need to know]\n\nBut concerns about fraud are equally high among the public and observers because it could trigger political chaos. This nearly occurred in the 2014 presidential election, in which Ghani and Abdullah were also the top two contenders.\n\nIn the 2014 race, complaints of fraud were so widespread on both sides that the process collapsed amid threats of violence by armed political factions. Finally, after a failed recount, U.S. officials brokered an uneasy power-sharing agreement between the two rivals, an arrangement that has proved dysfunctional and embittered.\n\nThis time, there are 16 other candidates in the race, but few have campaigned seriously. Ghani, 70, who has run a vigorous and expensive campaign, is expected to win in a first round with more than 50 percent of the vote. But opponents have accused the president of vote-buying and other pre-election abuses, which he and his spokesmen have denied.\n\nAbdullah, 59, has campaigned largely by attacking Ghani as a remote and self-centered leader who has deceived and disappointed the public. He has depicted himself as a more honorable politician who has twice agreed to concede an election for the good of the nation, first in 2009 in a close and fraud-plagued race against then-President Hamid Karzai, and then in 2014 against Ghani.\n\n\u201cThe people who are supporting me, from the grass roots to the top, they say that this time somebody else should make sacrifices,\u201d Abdullah said in the interview.\n\n\n\nAbdullah Abdullah walks to a helicopter with Ustad Abdul Karim Khalili (right) heading to a final campaign rally in Bamiyan, Afghanistan, on Sept. 25, 2019.

He made wisecracks about Ghani, describing the scholarly president as an \u201cant without wings,\u201d then turned serious and called on supporters to \u201csay no to fraud and use your clean vote to restore the country\u2019s honor.\u201d\n\nA more relaxed and informal campaigner than Ghani, Abdullah has had a longer history and higher profile in Afghan public life. He was a senior aide to Ahmed Shah Massoud, the legendary anti-Soviet and anti-Taliban militia leader, whose portraits and photographs are prominently displayed in Abdullah\u2019s home. (Massoud was assassinated in northern Afghanistan by al-Qaeda operatives posing as journalists two days before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.) After the fall of the Taliban in November 2001, Abdullah served as foreign minister under Karzai.\n\nCritics of Abdullah say that his anti-Ghani jokes and tirades are a substitute for his lack of a meaningful message or agenda on crucial national issues, especially on how to launch peace talks with the Taliban after the collapse of U.S. negotiations, and how to bolster the Afghan economy, which has sagged badly during the protracted civil conflict, leaving millions of Afghans jobless.\n\nThey also say he has relied too heavily on political support from ethnic ex-militia leaders, belying his moderate political and professional image. In 2014, he was backed by Attah Mohammed Noor, a powerful Tajik leader who threatened mass protests if Abdullah was not declared the winner. This time, he is counting on support from Abdurrashid Dostum, a tough Uzbek militia commander accused of serious crimes, and Mohammad Mohaqiq, an ethnic Hazara strongman.\n\n\u201cFor Abdullah, this all goes back to 2014,\u201d said Haroun Mir, a longtime political analyst who is now advising the Ghani campaign. \u201cThere is no substance in his campaign, only personal attacks. His goal is to remain relevant in politics, but his narrative is divisive, when the country needs unity.\u201d\n\n\n\nA massive crowd attends the final campaign rally for Abdullah Abdullah in Bamiyan, Afghanistan, on Sept. 25, 2019. (Paula Bronstein/Getty Images)\n\nIn the interview, Abdullah said Ghani has been \u201can obstacle towards peace,\u201d because he wants to \u201cremain at the top\u201d of the process and keep all others in subordinate roles. \u201cHis self-centered sentiment overrides anything else,\u201d Abdullah said. One difference between them is that \u201cI want peace\u201d he added. \u201cIf that means I will leave the office in order to achieve it, that will not be an obstacle.\u201d\n\nAbdullah has said he would support the creation of an interim government after the election if that would help create a national consensus and bring the Taliban into negotiations.\n\nSpeaking briefly about the economy, he said Ghani has offered too many \u201cgrand ideas\u201d without focusing on more mundane public problems, especially unemployment. One key, he said, is to boost the private sector instead of \u201ckilling it,\u201d by providing better access to loans, land and electricity, as well as controlling fraud.\n\nBut Abdullah\u2019s mind Thursday was clearly on the more immediate issues confronting him and the nation in the next week, with millions of Afghans preparing to vote in an election that might be marred by fraud as well as violence \u2014 and the choice of how to respond resting in large part on him.\n\n\u201cI do worry,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that it\u2019s not good for the country\u201d if the election goes bad and the results are clouded. Asked what would happen in that case, he hesitated for a moment and added: \u201cWhy not leave it for that moment to decide? But it will not be accepted.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nTaliban threats, poll closures raise fears for credibility of Afghan elections\n\nEven as rallies are bombed, Afghanistan\u2019s Ghani plows ahead with a populist campaign\n\nTaliban suicide bombers strike Kabul and rally for Afghan president, killing at least 48\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Abdullah Abdullah said the \u201csigns are not good\u201d for Saturday\u2019s election.", "authors": ["Pamela Constable", "Foreign Correspondent Covering Afghanistan", "Pakistan", "South Asia", "Latin America", "Susannah George", "Foreign Reporter Covering Afghanistan", "September At Am"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/BWBj3SO80o6efuWBm1f86W77lC0=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/P4XH3KHAMAI6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
