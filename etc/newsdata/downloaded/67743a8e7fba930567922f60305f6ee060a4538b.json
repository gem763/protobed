It was like Henry the Fifth at Agincourt.\u201d\n\nHalfon said that Johnson did, however, admit that the election was a risk and that victory was not certain.\n\n\u201cHe did say forget about the polls and everything else you have read, this is going to be a tough election - perhaps our toughest yet.\u201d\n\nMPs earlier rejected Labour\u2019s amendment to move the date to December 9 by 315 votes to 295, a majority of 20.\n\nThe next election was not scheduled to take place until May 2022.\n\nJohnson said he wants an election to secure a majority and a \u201cnew mandate\u201d from voters to get his Brexit deal through the Commons and take the UK out of the European Union by January 31.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn backed the snap election following a meeting of his shadow cabinet on Tuesday morning. The Labour leader gave the go-ahead now that a no-deal Brexit on Oct. 31 was \u201coff the table\u201d.\n\nAfter the crucial vote, Corbyn said: \u201cThis election is a once-in-a-generation chance to transform our country and take on the vested interests holding people back.\n\n\u201cThe choice at this election could not be clearer. A Labour government will be on your side, while Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservatives \u2013 who think they\u2019re born to rule \u2013 will only look after the privileged few.\n\n\u201cWe will now launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change that our country has ever seen.\n\n\u201cThis is our chance to build a country for the many not the few and fit for the next generation.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s decision to call a poll came after the Lib Dems and SNP said they would help facilitate the early poll.
