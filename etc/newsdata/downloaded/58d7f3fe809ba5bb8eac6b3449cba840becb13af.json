Elizabeth Warren will have her first chance to confront primary frontrunner Joe Biden on the debate stage Thursday night, as the top 10 Democrats running for president square off in Houston at a critical moment in the race.\n\nThe former vice president has maintained his status atop the primary polls, but Warren, D-Mass., has seen her numbers -- and crowd sizes -- grow in recent weeks. They have not appeared together on the same debate stage until now.\n\nThe other top-tier Democratic contender, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who like Warren represents the progressive and populist wing of the party, will also be in Houston.\n\nHOURS BEFORE THE DEBATE, WARREN PROPOSES A SOCIAL SECURITY BOOST OF $200 PER MONTH\n\nBut much of the buzz heading into Thursday night has focused on the two hopefuls standing center stage: Biden and Warren.\n\nTwo big questions heading into the debate: Will the two candidates, who come from very different wings of the Democratic Party, take aim at each other during the nationally televised prime-time showdown? And can Warren, who until now has not faced much direct criticism from top-tier candidates during debates, take the heat?\n\nBiden campaign officials previewed some fireworks, arguing ahead of the debate that the field needs more than just plans: \"We need action.\"\n\nIt was an implicit swipe at Warren, who famously has developed detailed action plans for a wide range of issues.\n\nWarren and Biden have taken subtle jabs at each other in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot at stake and people are scared,\u201d Warren emphasized last weekend, in an address at the New Hampshire Democratic Party\u2019s annual convention, as she noted the urgency of defeating President Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nIn what appeared to be a shot at Biden -- who has made electability a key part of his White House bid \u2013 Warren said \u201cwe can\u2019t choose a candidate we don\u2019t believe in because we\u2019re scared.\u201d\n\nTRUMP CAMPAIGN FLYING BANNER OVER DEBATE SITE BLASTING DEMOCRATS AS SOCIALISTS\n\nLast week Biden appeared to take aim at Warren during a high-profile climate change forum televised on national cable TV, saying \u201cplans are great, but executing on those plans is a very different thing.\u201d\n\nWarren has released one progressive policy proposal after another during her presidential campaign and is known for saying, \u201cI have a plan for that.\u201d\n\nAsked about Biden\u2019s comment, Warren told reporters: \u201cI think we start with a plan and then we get out there and fight for it. To me that\u2019s what being president is all about.\u201d\n\n2020 DEMS WHO FAILED TO MAKE DEBATE STAGE VOW TO PRESS ON\n\nDue to the luck of the draw, Biden and Warren have not yet appeared on the same stage during the first two rounds of debates. For each of the first two rounds, the field of some 20 candidates was split in half for debate events over two consecutive nights.\n\nBut with the field shrinking and criteria toughening, all 10 candidates who made the cut for this matchup will share a stage for a single-night debate Thursday, hosted by ABC.\n\nWarren has so far refrained from painting contrasts with her top rivals for the nomination. She told Fox News on Saturday that \"I'm not here to criticize any other Democrat or anyone else's campaign. I'm here to talk about what I'm running for as president.\"\n\nBiden's camp has signaled that he's unlikely to lead the charge against Warren.\n\n\u201cLet's be clear, there will be 10 candidates on the debate stage, not two. And regardless of who is or isn't attacking Joe Biden, Biden is focused on running his race,\u201d a senior Biden adviser told Fox News this week.\n\nDemocratic strategists agree. Veteran Democratic strategist Zac Petkanas predicted that \u201cthey are very likely to leave each other alone.\u201d\n\nPetkanas, who served as the Hillary Clinton campaign\u2019s director of rapid response in the 2016 race, noted that while some in the Biden camp are sending signals that the former vice president may paint contrasts with Warren, \u201cI doubt very much that the candidates themselves are going to get into a scrape.\u201d\n\n\u201cElizabeth Warren has done extremely well by staying above the fray,\u201d he added. \u201cShe is the little engine that continues to climb and build a strong foundation of support that is going to help her win the nomination.\u201d\n\nBut strategic communications consultant Ben LaBolt, who served as national press secretary for President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign, isn\u2019t ruling out some friction between Biden and Warren.\n\n\u201cI think she signaled she's willing to take the fight not only to Trump but to compete as hard as she needs to win the primary,\" he noted. \u201cInevitably, campaigns are about laying out choices. Democrats should not go below the belt in attacking each other or damaging potential nominees irrevocably, but I do expect some level of contrast between the candidates in this debate.\u201d\n\nBiden has faced incoming fire from his rivals on the debate stage the past two rounds, and Thursday night\u2019s showdown should be no different.\n\n\u201cI think there is going to be pile-on on Joe Biden and that makes a lot of sense,\u201d Petkanas said. \u201cA lot of the other campaigns believe that his support is soft and is moveable.\u201d\n\nBiden was coldcocked by Sen. Kamala Harris of California in the first round in late June and he weathered repeated jabs from Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York \u2013 who dropped out of the race last month \u2013 in late July\u2019s second round.\n\n\u201cThe reality is Joe Biden needs to come down in support if we\u2019re going to see other candidates increase their support,\u201d Petkanas noted.\n\nLaBolt empathized that the other candidates on Thursday\u2019s debate stage have a choice to make. \u201cWill they focus solely on laying out the case or will they take the contrast not only to Trump but to those candidates eating up the largest portion of their potential vote share?\u201d he said.\n\nWarren remained unscathed in the first round of debates, but she and Sanders faced attacks by more centrist lower-tier candidates over their progressive proposals \u2013 specifically the \"Medicare-for-all\" proposal -- during the second round.\n\nWith no let-up in Warren\u2019s rise \u2013 she\u2019s now all tied up with Sanders for second place behind Biden in nearly every recent poll \u2013 expect her, along with Sanders, to face more criticism.\n\nLaBolt said that \u201cwhile Biden has been a focus of attacks, other candidates may have a better shot peeling off support from Warren or Sanders. How they engage with others on the stage will be the most interesting chess match of the evening.\u201d\n\nFox News' Peter Doocy and Brooke Singman contributed to this report.", "description": "A surging Elizabeth Warren\u00a0will have her first chance to confront primary\u00a0front-runner Joe Biden\u00a0on the debate\u00a0stage Thursday night, as the top 10 Democrats running for president square off in Houston at a critical moment in the race.", "authors": ["Paul Steinhauser", "Paul Steinhauser Is A Politics Reporter Based In New Hampshire."], "top_image": "https://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2019/08/26/694940094001_6077379365001_6077386594001-vs.jpg"}
