Trump abused his powers as president to pressure the government of Ukraine, a supplicant when it comes to the balance of military and financial power, into assisting him with a partisan investigation of his domestic political opponents. But understanding what precipitated and followed from that incident is complex. Much of the mess we\u2019re seeing is due to a collision of two narratives that have been dominating Washington, DC: one of a president abusing his power versus another of a president falling prey to deep-state abuses of power. (Here, I\u2019m using the term \u201cdeep state\u201d to mean partisan factions within law enforcement and intelligence, not something more elaborate.) Because Trump\u2019s enemies believe the former and his supporters believe the latter, there has been a recursive quality to the resulting conflicts. Trump got investigated and then sought to investigate the investigators, who now in turn seek to investigate Trump\u2019s efforts to investigate the investigators. The Ukraine incident must be understood partially in this context.\n\nMost Americans have come to understand the basics of the theory that Trump conspired with Moscow. Fewer have become acquainted with the idea that the origins of Russiagate can be traced to a conspiracy of Trump\u2019s enemies, which many Americans on the right have come to believe. Are they deluded or are they clear-sighted? As someone who spent several months on a profile of one of Trump\u2019s erstwhile advisors, George Papadopoulos, who spent 12 days in prison for having lied to the FBI about his outreach to Russia, I wound up having to dig into this question in some detail. My reporting involved interviews with people from all over the world\u2014sundry Greeks, Israelis, Australians, Italians, Brits, and of course Americans\u2014and Papadopoulos also provided me with still-unreleased emails and communications between members of the Trump campaign. While I can\u2019t be as terse as I would like about what I found, I hope at least to offer some clarity for all sides.\n\nThe first thing for the casual news consumer to understand is that the deep-state-abuses narrative of Russiagate and Ukrainegate isn\u2019t just one story. People who suspect that the Trump campaign of 2016 was subject to abuses of power can be found on the non-establishment left as well as the right, and theories of who did what and why are too numerous to count. Broadly speaking, though, the mildest versions of the theory assert there was partisanship and conflicts of interest within the FBI and Department of Justice that led to a flouting of boundaries and protocol. This has been the thrust of many columns by, for instance, Kimberley Strassel in the Wall Street Journal. The most extreme versions of the theory lay out a multi-state conspiracy between government officials and intelligence operatives in Washington, London, Rome, Canberra, Athens, Ankara, and Tel Aviv. This is the narrative favored by Papadopoulos and a growing number of people on the right, including, it seems, the president himself.\n\nWe\u2019ll start with the extreme theory, which is the one that has Trump\u2019s allies going on investigative trips all over the world in an effort to separate fact from fantasy. Just last week, for instance, we could read that Attorney General William Barr visited Rome in September. In this version of events, George Papadopoulos was a pawn in a larger game\u2014someone who was fed compromising information by agents provocateurs so that he would pass it on and create a pretext for investigations. Specifically, in the spring of 2016, when Papadopoulos had just joined the Trump campaign, he came into contact with a London-based Maltese professor named Joseph Mifsud. During a late-April meeting, Mifsud allegedly told Papadopoulos that the Russians had Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails in their possession. A couple of weeks later, in early May, Papadopoulos had a drink with an Australian diplomat named Alexander Downer and mentioned that Russia had compromising information on Clinton. Several weeks later, Downer reported this exchange to U.S. authorities, triggering a major investigation of Trump\u2019s campaign. In the extreme theory of events, all of this was a put-up job by anti-Trump factions within U.S., British, and Australian intelligence agencies, because they viewed Trump as a threat to global security.", "description": "I spent several months investigating the claim, now accepted by many Republicans, that the Trump campaign was set up. But after interviewing Papadopoulos and dozens of sources from around the world, I uncovered a more prosaic truth.", "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "T.A.
