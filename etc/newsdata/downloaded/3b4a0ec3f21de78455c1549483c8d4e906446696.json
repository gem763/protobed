Yet the Federal Reserve just cut interest rates for the second time since July, and suddenly there are liquidity issues popping up in the repo market.\n\nThis doesn't seem to make any sense on the surface \u2014 and the strange mix of market forces has created an environment where investors are behaving in ways they normally wouldn't.\n\nWayne Himelsein, the president and chief investment officer at Logica Capital Advisers, is trying to wrap his head around the market oddities he's seeing.\n\n\"The amount of greed or excitement is causing an upside-down behavior versus the way emotions should behave,\" Himelsein said in an exclusive interview with Business Insider. \"We should be panicked in sell-offs, but instead we're panic buying ... it's very strange to say the least.\"\n\nHe's confounded by this trading mentality. It seems to him that investors' fear of missing out is getting the better of them and resulting in aggressive run-ups.\n\nYou may have heard the adage on Wall Street that says stocks take the stairs up and the elevator down \u2014 a slow churn higher, followed by a swift collapse. But according to Himelsein, in recent years, the exact opposite has been true. Markets have shot up quickly, followed by a slow sell-off.\n\n\"This is now a new era,\" he said. \"A lot of protective models would encompass behavior of the prior \u2014 meaning harsh collapses. We're now looking at how do we encompass these aggressive run-ups.\"\n\nBut Himelsein built his career capitalizing on market inefficiencies caused by behavioral biases. And where there is irrationality, he also sees ample opportunity.\n\nHow he's positioned\n\nFor starters, Himelsein stays agnostic to the future. That means he doesn't try to make market calls or concern himself with any macroeconomic variables like interest rates, employment, and inflation. There are simply too many to try to quantify, so he doesn't bother wasting his time trying to incorporate them into his model.\n\nWith that in mind, he employs a systematic approach and runs two models simultaneously. One is mean-expansionary, and one mean-reversionary.\n\nIf you agree with his thinking, an approach you could employ would be to go long technology stocks to ride the expansionary trend in that sector. Simultaneously, an investor could also purchase energy stocks, as they look cheap compared with historical averages, which represents the reversionary portion approach.\n\nNot only are you in two different sectors, but you're also straddling two different philosophical schools of thought.\n\nTwo corresponding exchange-traded funds include the SPDR Technology Select Sector ETF and the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF.\n\n\"It's almost analogous to talking from both sides of your mouth,\" he said. \"There are good positions to be had on both sides of that.\"\n\nIn addition, Himelsein mitigates the risk of making an errant call through the use of options.\n\n\"The beauty of an option instrument is that you are naturally convex to payoffs \u2014 or to gains \u2014 and concave to losses,\" he said. \"When you're right, the bigger your position grows \u2014 and when you're wrong, the position naturally shrinks.\"\n\nThrough this methodology, the ambiguity of pinpointing an exact entry or exit point is mitigated, while the duality of mean expansion and reversion positioning means profits can be made in both directions.", "description": "Wayne Himelsein, the president and CIO at Logica Capital Advisers, says greed and excitement are causing investors to \"panic buy.\"", "authors": ["Christopher Competiello"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d84f3452e22af570512b51a-2732-1366.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
