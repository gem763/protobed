Lutsenko, who served a prison sentence for embezzlement and corruption in the mid-2000s, was appointed to the post in 2016 after Joe Biden demanded the ouster of his predecessor. The incident in question and the Biden family\u2019s ties to Burisma are the center of the impeachment inquiry House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched last month.\n\nThe controversy began when President Donald Trump suggested the Ukrainian government investigate Hunter Biden\u2019s tenure on Burisma\u2019s board of directors. Hunter Biden had joined the company in 2014, purportedly making as much as $83,000 per month, to consult on legal issues. The appointment immediately raised questions from ethics watchdogs in both the U.S. and Europe about the true nature of his role, since he possessed no background in either the energy industry or Ukraine.\n\nAround the same time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, his father was appointed as the Obama administration\u2019s point man on Ukraine. Even more troubling is that at the time of the appointment, Burisma was attempting to sway western leaders after its founder, Mykola Zlochevsky, was accused of money laundering and had his assets seized in Great Britain. Zlochevsky is rumored to be one of eastern Europe\u2019s leading oligarchs and has strong political ties to former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych \u2014 a staunch ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nIn 2015, Viktor Shokin, who was then the prosecutor general, led the first investigation into Zlochevsky and Burisma. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster he was warned to back off the matter. Regardless, Shokin never got to complete the probe, thanks to the former vice president\u2019s intervention.\n\nBiden, who has publicly bragged about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion dollars of U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. The former vice president has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutors\u2019 ability to tackle corruption. Regardless of the reason, Lutsenko dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky during his tenure, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having fled it in 2014.", "description": "Ukraine's top prosecutor will open a review into the criminal case against Burisma Holdings, an energy giant with ties to Joe Biden's son.", "authors": ["Haris Alic"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/GettyImages-1173610364-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
