A handful of Republicans, including Senators Mitt Romney of Utah and Ben Sasse of Nebraska, have also said they were troubled by Mr. Trump\u2019s effort to push the leader of Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nAnd Representative Will Hurd, Republican of Texas and a former C.I.A. officer who is not seeking re-election, said Sunday that the allegations needed to be investigated. \u201cThere are troubling issues within the whistle-blower\u2019s report,\u201d he said on the CBS program \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cBut they are allegations. And I think that\u2019s why we should explore these allegations through hearings. We\u2019re \u2014 we had a hearing last week. We\u2019re going to be having some depositions this week as well in order to get to the bottom of this.\u201d\n\nThe inquiry centers on what amounts to a shadow foreign policy in Ukraine by the president and Mr. Giuliani. Central to the complaint by a whistle-blower was a July 25 telephone call between Mr. Trump and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, at a time when the White House was withholding military aid to Ukraine.\n\nA summary transcript of the call, released last week by the White House, shows that Mr. Trump asked Mr. Zelensky to \u201cdo me a favor\u201d by investigating corruption in Ukraine.\n\nMr. Trump later brought Mr. Biden into the conversation, urging Mr. Zelensky to have a prosecutor look into Mr. Biden and his son Hunter, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company when Mr. Biden was vice president. The younger Mr. Biden\u2019s work has raised conflict of interest questions, but a former Ukrainian prosecutor said he found no evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Biden or his son.\n\nIn his complaint, which the inspector general for the intelligence community deemed credible, the whistle-blower said the White House had tried to \u201clock down\u201d all records of the call. Current and former White House officials have since confirmed that Mr. Trump used a secure system \u2014 intended for highly classified material \u2014 to store transcripts of that call and others with world leaders, even those that are not highly classified.", "description": "Thomas P.
