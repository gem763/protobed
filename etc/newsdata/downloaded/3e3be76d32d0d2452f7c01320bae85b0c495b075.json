Live rounds have been fired on a few occasions, and an 18-year-old was shot by police in the chest on 1 October.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence\n\nThe Financial Times newspaper reports that Chinese leaders are drawing up plans to remove Ms Lam, a figure loathed by protesters whom Beijing has thus far stood by.\n\nShe will, the paper says, be replaced by an interim chief executive after calm returns to Hong Kong.\n\nMs Lam's office told the BBC: \"We do not comment on speculation.\" China's foreign ministry said the FT report was \"a political rumour with ulterior motives\".\n\nSeparately on Wednesday, Hong Kong released the murder suspect whose case led to the extradition bill in the first place.\n\nChan Tong-kai is accused of murdering his pregnant girlfriend in Taiwan last year before fleeing back to Hong Kong.\n\nBut Hong Kong and Taiwan do not have an extradition treaty, and his case was cited when the government proposed amending the law.", "description": "The extradition bill is formally withdrawn by the legislature but the move is unlikely to quell unrest.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/343D/production/_109337331_mediaitem109337327.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
