But three penalties \u2014 an offensive pass interference, false start and holding \u2014 pushed back Kansas City a total of 25 yards.\n\nMahomes did most of his damage on two plays: a short pass that running back Darrel Williams took for 52 yards and a 42-yard scoring strike to wide receiver Tyreek Hill, who was playing in his first game since sustaining a shoulder injury in Week 1.\n\nMahomes was coming off a 19-13 loss to the Indianapolis Colts that represented the lowest scoring output for the Chiefs since the quarterback became the team's starter in 2018.\n\nFollow Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz on Twitter @MikeMSchwartz.", "description": "Patrick Mahomes is doing what might seem mathematically impossible by throwing or 116 yards in a single drive for the Kansas City Chiefs.", "authors": ["Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz", "Published P.M.
