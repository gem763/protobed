It has been in a bear channel for a year. There is no sign that the series of lower highs and lows is about to end. Also, there are 2 measured move targets and a gap around 1.08. Consequently, this attempt at a bottom will probably be minor. If the bulls get a reversal up this week from a test of the September double bottom, the rally will probably fail to get above the August high.\n\nBecause the daily chart is sideways, the bulls and bears are balanced. Traders believe that the next 2 \u2013 3 week move is as likely to be up as it is to be down.\n\nEven though there probably will be a breakout within a few weeks, until there is a breakout, they are betting on reversals. They buy low, sell high, and take profits every couple days.\n\nOvernight EUR/USD Forex trading\n\nThe EUR/USD 5 minute chart traded below last week\u2019s low at the start of the European session and then reversed up. The rally has only been 30 pips and in a broad channel. This is not yet the start of a strong bull trend. Day traders will look for scalps up and down until there is a strong trend.\n\nThe minimum goal for the bulls is to have today close above the open. Today would then be a High 2 buy signal bar on the daily chart. It would also be a buy signal for a pullback from the September double bottom. There would be a Double Bottom Pullback buy signal.\n\nIf the bears can get today to close near its low, traders will expect a break below the September low this week. Their next target is 1.08.", "description": "Forex Analysis by Al Brooks covering: EUR/USD.
