The President would have us believe that he can willfully engage in criminal activity and prevent witnesses from testifying before Congress --even if they did not actually work for him or his administration. If he were to prevail in this cover-up while the Judiciary Committee is considering whether to recommend articles of impeachment, he would upend the separation of powers as envisioned by our founders.\n\n\"No one is above the law,\" the statement continued. \"The House Judiciary Committee will continue our investigation of the President\u2019s crimes, corruption and cover-up and get to the truth for the American people.\"\n\nLewandowski, who served as Trump's first campaign manager until he was fired in June of 2016, has remained close to the president and the West Wing, serving as an outside adviser to Trump since his election but never served in Trump\u2019s administration.\n\nPorter served as White House staff secretary for Trump from January 2017 until he resigned amid allegations of domestic abuse in February 2018 -- allegations he denied. He served as a key witness in Mueller's investigation.\n\nBoth Porter and Dearborn were on the list of a dozen subpoenas the committee authorized in June, requesting documents and testimony from twelve current and former administration officials and associates of Trump related to their obstruction investigation.\n\nDemocrats see public testimony from them and other prominent Trump figures as key elements of their investigation to determine whether to take up impeachment against the president.", "description": "The Trump White House on Monday claimed that former Staff Secretary Rob Porter and former deputy chief of staff Rick Dearborn have", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/nadler-collins-mueller-ap-ps-190724_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
