More than three-fourths of the new units need to be for low- and middle-\n\nincome families. That\u2019s where shortages are greatest; developers prefer to build upscale housing because it\u2019s more profitable.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBowser and D.C. Council offer competing visions on affordable-housing crisis\n\nThe 140-page report includes detailed recommendations to increase public subsidies, relax zoning and regulatory restrictions, strengthen tenant protections, and take other steps to achieve the goal. It asks each county and municipality in the region to commit to a 10-year target for producing affordable-housing units.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that the study was released a week before the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (COG) is set to vote on a plan in which the region would commit to build an extra 75,000 housing units between 2020 and 2030 \u2014 a 31 percent increase over forecasts.\n\nCOG, the region\u2019s government planning body, has been working on the affordable-housing issue for a year, coordinating with business and civic groups such as the partnership, an alliance of chief executives of the region\u2019s largest employers.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe aim is to form a broad-based movement to advocate for building more low- and middle-cost housing and to prevent the region from experiencing acute shortages like those in fast-growing tech centers such as San Francisco and Seattle. A related goal is to stop or at least slow the displacement of low-income communities via gentrification.\n\nThe model is the regionwide coalition of politicians, business groups, unions and nonprofit organizations that united to win $500 million a year in new dedicated funding for Metro.\n\nD.C. employees: \u2018Where\u2019s the affordable housing for us?\u2019\n\n\u201cWe have to get ahead of the housing affordability challenges so we don\u2019t find ourselves 10 or 15 years from now in a crisis,\u201d partnership chief executive Jason Miller said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a window right now where action can move the needle and avoid some of those outcomes that we\u2019ve seen in other parts of the country.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe stakes are considerable. The lack of affordable housing is widely seen as one of the three main challenges holding back the region\u2019s economy. Traffic gridlock and a shortage of qualified workers are the other two.\n\n\u201cInaction on the challenges of housing affordability could ultimately undermine the region\u2019s future economic growth and prosperity,\u201d says the Urban Institute report, titled \u201cMeeting the Washington Region\u2019s Future Housing Needs.\u201d Housing challenges \u201ccan undermine worker productivity, increase the difficulty businesses face in attracting and retaining employees, and discourage businesses from locating in the region,\u201d it says.\n\nBut solving the housing problem is vastly more complicated than prying additional money from jurisdictions for Metro. First, it will be costly and difficult to redirect the powerful market forces that encourage developers to focus on high-end housing.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRents are rising and neighborhoods are changing. Renters mobilized to form a tenants union.\n\nSince 2010, only 10 percent of the new housing units in the region have cost $1,299 a month or less, and thus were affordable for households with annual incomes of $54,300 or less, according to the Urban Institute.\n\nThe study says the region will have to raise that share to 38 percent between now and 2030 to produce the 141,000 new units needed in that price range.\n\n\u201cIn general, the new units we are producing are tilted toward the higher-cost bands,\u201d said Margery Austin Turner, senior vice president of the Urban Institute and lead author of the study. \u201cThoughtful review and reform of regulatory policies could free up the market to produce more units overall . . . which would bring costs down somewhat but also produce more housing that is modest, higher density and lower cost for occupants.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe study found that 493,000 households in the region are at risk of displacement in coming years as rents and property taxes rise. Of those, 220,000 households have annual incomes below $75,000 and thus are at the most risk of being forced to relocate.\n\nAD\n\nThen there is the political challenge. In practical terms, the region needs more multifamily housing for less-affluent residents, including in communities where single-family homes are the rule.\n\nFairfax board adopts budget with more for affordable housing, environment\n\nThat\u2019s certain to get political pushback from residents worried about congestion, property values or preserving the character of their neighborhoods. Truth be told, some NIMBYs also don\u2019t want poor people \u2014 especially those of different races or ethnicities \u2014 living in their communities.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLocal leaders can\u2019t complain about the lack of affordable housing and, at the same time, not confront the NIMBYs in their localities,\u201d Urban Institute Senior Director Gustavo Velasquez said.\n\nHe cited Montgomery County, Md., which has a one-year moratorium on residential housing construction in three high school districts. According to the report, Montgomery needs to build 23,100 additional low-cost housing units by 2030, more than any other jurisdiction in the region.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cIn the interest of job growth and to alleviate current and new county residents priced out of housing, the leadership here needs to demonstrate that it\u2019s willing to confront the vast amount of influential and affluent NIMBYs,\u201d Velasquez said. \u201cThat is the case in other jurisdictions as well.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nArea residents, not Amazon newcomers, are fueling Northern Virginia real estate frenzy, agents say\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the familiar challenge in our region of political fragmentation and jurisdictional rivalries. Each jurisdiction would like to attract high-end development to itself and park low-cost housing elsewhere.\n\nTo try to overcome that problem, both the Urban Institute report and COG are pushing for individual jurisdictions to commit to specific targets for additional low- and middle-cost units by 2030.\n\nSo far, only the District has set an explicit goal, with Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) calling for the creation of 36,000 new units by 2025, of which one-third would be affordable.\n\nAD\n\nCOG Executive Director Chuck Bean hopes that the expected vote next Wednesday on a regionwide target for new housing production will prompt county and city governments to follow through with their own commitments in coming months.\n\nAD\n\nAmazon says it will avoid a housing crunch with HQ2 by planning better than it did in Seattle\n\n\u201cThe Sept. 11 meeting is a big deal for us because it bookends a year\u2019s worth of work,\u201d Bean said. \u201cBy setting these regional targets, it paves the way for individual local jurisdictions to set their own.\u201d\n\nHe and others expressed optimism about the process because major employers with political clout were getting involved in the effort.\n\n\u201cBeyond the data, what\u2019s new here is the entrance in a big way of the regional business community,\u201d Bean said.\n\nBut Velasquez, of the Urban Institute, warned against complacency: \u201cThere seems to be an appetite in the business community to do more toward solving the housing affordability crisis in ways you didn\u2019t see before, but a broad-based effort is yet to be seen.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe debate over how to provide affordable urban housing\n\nContext matters: California\u2019s approach to resolving homelessness\n\nUnderstanding why minimum-wage workers can\u2019t afford housing", "description": "A study says the region needs 374,000 more homes by 2030, with most aimed at low- and middle-income families.", "authors": ["Robert Mccartney", "Senior Regional Correspondent Covering Government"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/6qIK7ntGqPJMMm5IIyi_ENe3sQs=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7IHBU5SBAMI6TBNNO6PPAX6Z3A.jpg"}
