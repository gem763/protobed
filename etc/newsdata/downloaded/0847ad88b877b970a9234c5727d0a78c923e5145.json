You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThe announcement was made at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on Wednesday morning, with the winners awarded a share of the nine million Swedish Kroner (\u00a3740,000) prize money.\n\nUK-US scientist Professor Whittingham laid the foundation for the development of lithium-ion batteries when he researched fossil fuel-free energy technologies during the oil crisis of the 1970s.\n\nHe came up with an innovative cathode that could house lithiumm ions. Professor Goodenough built on this research in the 19800s by demonstrating a battery that could hold four volts of charge.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Science Photographer of the Year shortlist 1/9 Soap bubble structures showing light interference colours and patterning Bubbles want to optimise space and minimise their surface area for a given volume of air. This unique phenomenon makes them a reliable, useful tool in many areas of research. In particular, materials science and 'packing' - how things fit together. Bubble walls drain under gravity, thin at the top, thick at the bottom and interferes with travelling lightwaves to create bands of colour. Black spots show the wall is too thin for interference colours, indicating the bubble is about to burst! - Kym Cox Kym Cox/RPS 2/9 Upside down Jelly fish, Cassiopea xamachana Instead of swimming, this species spends its time pulsing up and down in the water. Their diet is sea plankton and their coloration comes from the uptake of algae in the water. Some jellyfish species have been documented eating plastics in the ocean. One theory suggests that algae grows on the plastic. As it breaks down, the algae creates the odor of dimethyl sulfide that attracts hungry animals. - Mary Anne Chilton Mary Anne Chilton/RPS 3/9 Tribolium confusum. Confused flour beetle.

The remarkable shape of the nebula resembles that of the continent of North America, complete with a prominent Gulf of Mexico. The Cygnus Wall, a term for the \"Mexico and Central America part\" of the North America Nebula, exhibits the most concentrated star formations in the nebula. - Dave Watson Dave Watson/RPS 5/9 Safety Corona A safety pin is connected to a high tension AC generator. The pin ionizes the air around it. When the electrons fall back on an atom, the excess energy is emitted as a photon, which generate the corona glow around the pin. The fuzziness of the pin is because the camera did not actually capture light reflected on the pin but rather the light emitted by the ionized light around it. - Richard Germain Richard Germain/RPS 6/9 Calmness of Eternity Himalayas mountains, Nepal.
