(Reuters) - UFO enthusiasts began descending on rural Nevada on Thursday near the secret U.S. military installation known as Area 51, long rumored to house government secrets about alien life, with local authorities hoping the visitors were coming in peace.\n\nDust blows through the desert as an influx of tourists responding to a call to 'storm' Area 51, a secretive U.S. military base believed by UFO enthusiasts to hold government secrets about extra-terrestrials, is expected in Rachel, Nevada, U.S. September 19, 2019. REUTERS/Jim Urquhart\n\nResidents of Rachel, Nevada, a remote desert town of 50 people about 12 miles outside the base, worried their community might be overwhelmed by unruly crowds turning out in response to a recent viral social-media invitation to \u201cstorm\u201d Area 51.\n\nThe man behind the planned gathering, the date for which was never explained, worries about a \u201cpossible humanitarian disaster\u201d in Rachel, which lacks a grocery store or even a gasoline station.\n\nNevertheless, dozens of visitors began arriving on Thursday outside the town\u2019s only business - an extraterrestrial-themed motel and restaurant called the Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn - parking themselves in cars, tents and campers. A fire truck was stationed nearby.\n\nArea 51 was shrouded in secrecy for decades, stoking conspiracy theories that it housed the remnants of a flying saucer and the bodies of its alien crew from a supposed unidentified flying object crash in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. The U.S. government did not confirm the base existed until 2013, when it released CIA archives saying the site was used to test top-secret spy planes.\n\nThe documents, however, did not end suspicion about space aliens there.\n\nRachel and its surroundings have long celebrated their place in UFO lore as a tourist draw. A 98-mile (158-km) road running through the area is dubbed the Extraterrestrial Highway, a purported hotbed of UFO sightings.\n\nIn June, California college student Matty Roberts posted a facetious Facebook invitation exhorting the public at large to run into Area 51 on foot to \u201csee them aliens.\u201d\n\nWhen more than 1 million people expressed interest, the U.S. Air Force admonished curiosity seekers not to breach the gates at the military base, which it said is still used to test combat aircraft and train personnel.\n\n\u2018ALIENSTOCK\u2019\n\nRoberts then teamed up with Connie West, co-owner of the Little A\u2019Le\u2019Inn, to plan a music festival in Rachel dubbed \u201cAlienstock\u201d to entertain the expected crowds.\n\nIn early September, however, Roberts disassociated himself from the Rachel event, saying it was poorly organized and he feared it could devolve into a public safety crisis.\n\nRoberts instead helped stage an alternative Alienstock set to take place Thursday night 150 miles (240 km) away, in Las Vegas. Beer brand Bud Light signed on as a sponsor and designed limited-edition, green beer cans featuring alien heads.\n\nAbout 40 miles (64 km) east of Rachel, another small town, Hiko, Nevada, planned a separate event called \u201cStorm Area 51 Basecamp\u201d at a gift shop dubbed the Alien Research Center. Organizers promised musicians, artists and \u201cprominent ufologists\u201d and by Thursday had sold 3,200 tickets, according to Linda Looney, manager of the shop. \u201cThis whole thing has been a shock to this little community,\u201d she said on Thursday, adding that organizers had hired 15 security guards and a private ambulance and ordered 80 portable toilets. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be really cool. I\u2019m excited.\u201d\n\nThe expected influx of alien hunters prompted Lincoln County, encompassing Rachel and Hiko, to draft an emergency declaration that could be invoked if needed to call in help from the state.\n\nSelf-professed alien fan Stephen Ray said had traveled to the region with a friend from Colorado only to encounter a heavy law enforcement presence that was keeping visitors away from the base.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be able to storm it this time,\u201d he said in Hiko.\n\nSlideshow (18 Images)\n\nThe Lincoln County Sheriff\u2019s Office said visitors should expect \u201ca large presence of law enforcement.\u201d Authorities urged everyone to bring ample supplies of food, water and fuel.\n\nThe official website of Rachel was likewise discouraging, and urged would-be revelers to stay away.\n\n\u201cIf any event still happens it is going to be a pretty sad affair with no bands, no food, very little infrastructure and a lot of unhappy campers,\u201d it said.", "description": "UFO enthusiasts began descending on rural Nevada on Thursday near the secret U.S. military installation known as Area 51, long rumored to house government secrets about alien life, with local authorities hoping the visitors were coming in peace.", "authors": ["Lisa Richwine", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190919&t=2&i=1431773802&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8I24R", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
