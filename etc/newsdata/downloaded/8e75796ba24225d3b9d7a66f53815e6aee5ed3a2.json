Moneycorp is also responsible for the next worst deal \u2013 0.94 euros per pound at Bristol airport.\n\nThe business model has enriched the firm's boss Mark Horgan, who lives in a \u00a32.25million home with an outdoor swimming pool near Maidenhead in Berkshire.\n\nHolidaymakers flying from Heathrow are offered just 0.96 euros by Travelex at Terminal 3, according to the analysis.\n\nAt Birmingham Airport, currency company ICE offers just 0.96 euros. Even the best rate on offer \u2013 also from ICE \u2013 is just above a euro per pound (1.02 euros), at Belfast airport.\n\nOne consumer campaigner last night warned that those who wait until they get to the airport are almost guaranteed to be 'ripped off'.\n\nGuy Anker of the MoneySavingExpert website advised travellers to compare rates online or use a 'specialist overseas credit or debit card' instead.\n\nTory MP Julian Knight said: 'Some of these rates are daylight robbery... currency firms, airports and everybody involved needs to take a long hard look at themselves and ask whether they are treating customers fairly. These rates suggest they are definitely not.'\n\nIan Strafford-Taylor, chief executive of online currency firm Equals, which carried out the analysis, said: 'Despite the fact the pound has gained strength against the euro recently, desks at airports continue to rip off holidaymakers who are waiting until the last minute to change their currency.'\n\nHe added: 'Of course everyone expects to pay a little more for convenience, but some of the rates offered to travellers are outrageous.'\n\nCurrency firms last night said airports are partly to blame for the poor rates, as they sign exclusive deals to set up bureau de change desks in terminals.\n\nMoneycorp said the higher costs associated with operating at some airports are passed on to customers in the form of worse exchange rates.\n\nA Travelex spokesman said their rates reflect a 'convenient, reliable service' and added that passengers are 'encouraged to pre-order currency'.\n\nA spokesman for Stansted said what firms charge customers 'is a matter for them'.", "description": "An audit of bureau de change desks revealed how firms ruthlessly cashed in on half-term holidaymakers with the worst deal being offered at London Stansted by Moneycorp.", "authors": ["James Salmon And Josh White For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/00/20201180-0-image-a-47_1572044684246.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
