My initial headline for this story was about Charles Barkley\u2019s response for Vice President Pence. Yesterday Pence said the NBA was acting as a \u201cwholly-owned subsidiary\u201d of communist China. Barkley\u2019s disappointing response: \u201cVice President Pence needs to shut the hell up.\u201d Barkley sounds just like China at this point.\n\nBut ultimately, what commissioner Silver says is so much worse because he\u2019s more than just a commentator, he\u2019s speaking for the organization as a whole. Here\u2019s the set up: The show played the criticism by Pence. Commissioner Silver responded. Then Barkley told Pence to shut up. Then Kenny Smith offered a weirdly rambling comment that attempted to portray Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet as one more example of the NBA\u2019s commitment to free speech. According to Smith, Daryl Morey\u2019s tweet about Hong Kong was consistent with LeBron James and others talking about social justice, \u201ceven if, at times, we aren\u2019t all in agreement.\u201d\n\nSure, Morey\u2019s initial tweet was consistent with the NBA\u2019s previous stance on free speech. What\u2019s wasn\u2019t consistent was the league\u2019s freaked out reaction to that tweet. No one freaked out and released multiple statements about LeBron not intending to offend anyone, or about Gregg Popovice not intending to offend anyone, when they spoke up. On the contrary, the NBA came out in support of ads put out by Bloomberg\u2019s Everytown for Gun Safety, a well-funded gun control group.\n\nKenny Smith wrapped up his response saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t see a silencing, I just saw an ability to use your platform as we always have.\u201d He then tossed it back to Commissioner Silver whether or not his take on the situation was \u201caccurate.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it is. Freedom of expression also includes the right to choose not to speak,\u201d Silver said, summing up a view of free speech that isn\u2019t very far from what China has been saying. Last weekend, Chinese state television said this about this issue, \u201cFreedom of speech does not mean that it can be arbitrary nonsense.\u201d Granted, these statements aren\u2019t identical but they do seem interchangeable.\n\nSilver continued, \u201cThese are complicated issues\u2026if you take particular players who\u2019ve stood for important causes domestically, things that have been close to their heart, the fact that they may not be as knowledgeable about international issues and don\u2019t speak out on those issues, to me there\u2019s nothing inconsistent with the good works they\u2019ve done in the United States.\u201d\n\nSilver and others have been using this ignorance defense for a couple of weeks. I\u2019m assuming they were handed this talking point by some crisis communications firm. Just say you don\u2019t fully understand the issues. Could it be any more obvious that this is a dodge?\n\nSo how long does it take these woke athletes and coaches to figure out that communist China is not on the side of freedom and free speech? Do they need a week? A month? What exactly is the learning curve to realize the country which used tanks to stop unarmed pro-democracy protesters, which currently has re-education camps for religious minorities, and which is threatening to limit the freedoms of the people in Hong Kong, is not on the side of freedom and social justice? As Pence said yesterday, \u201csome of the NBA\u2019s biggest players and owners, who routinely exercise their freedom to criticize this country, lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of the people of China.\u201d\n\nBy the way, did anyone in this 17-minute clip use the words \u201cHong Kong?\u201d I may have missed it but I didn\u2019t hear it. I heard Taiwan mentioned but not Hong Kong even when it seemed appropriate to mention it.\n\nThere are certainly lots of companies in business with China who don\u2019t speak up about human rights, but those companies haven\u2019t made social justice part of their brand. The NBA has. The hypocrisy continues to be glaring. Commissioner Silver\u2019s attempt to excuse it only shows the degree to which the league has internalized a view of free speech that doesn\u2019t sound that different from what Chinese state TV is saying.", "description": "\"These are complicated issues...\"", "authors": ["John Sexton", "Ed Morrissey", "Karen Townsend", "Jazz Shaw"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Commissioner-Silver.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
