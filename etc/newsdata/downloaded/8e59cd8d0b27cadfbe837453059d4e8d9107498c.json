The four were killed by a suicide vest he detonated.\n\nThe successful mission brings an end to the years-long manhunt for Baghdadi and marks a crucial blow to ISIS. But according to Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Trump never gave him or other members of the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d \u2015 a bipartisan group of lawmakers comprised of the most senior members of Congress, including Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) \u2015 a tipoff beforehand.\n\n\u201cThat wasn\u2019t done here,\u201d Schiff told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday. \u201cI think that\u2019s a mistake, but let\u2019s not lose sight of the fact that it was a success and a ruthless killer has been taken off the battlefield.\u201d\n\nThough Schiff praised the accomplishment, he noted that communicating such developments with lawmakers is key in the event that complications arise.\n\n\u201cHad this escalated, had something gone wrong, had we gotten into a firefight with the Russians, it\u2019s to the administration\u2019s advantage to be able to say \u2018we informed Congress,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nTrump acknowledged to reporters that he notified only \u201csome\u201d congressional leaders because he \u201cwanted to make sure [the raid was] kept secret\u201d because \u201cWashington leaks like I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d\n\nThe president said he contacted Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) before his announcement.\n\nDuring an appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence defended Trump\u2019s handling of the matter, and avoided answering host Chris Wallace\u2019s queries about why Pelosi was not given a heads-up.\n\nPresented with the question repeatedly, Pence refused to offer a direct response, focusing only on the military feat.\n\nLove HuffPost?
