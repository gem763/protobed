Shutterstock\n\nBarely six months after Facebook announced its own digital currency, a plan heralded as the beginning of the end for central banks and government controls over the money supply, the whole thing is looking like a house of cards.\n\nThe project, named Libra, was taken seriously in part because it had the support of major players in global electronic payments, including Visa, Mastercard, Paypal and Stripe. But now they are dropping like flies.\n\nIn October, Paypal pulled out, followed by Visa, Mastercard and Stripe, as well as eBay, Mercado Pago (Latin America\u2019s most popular e-commerce platform) and Booking Holdings (owner of travel booking websites including booking.com).\n\nThey appear to be spooked by the scrutiny Facebook\u2019s operations are attracting from regulators around the world.\n\nBacklash\n\nMICHAEL REYNOLDS/EPA\n\nEuropean leaders are threatening to do all they can to thwart the Libra plan.\n\nFrance\u2019s minister for the economy, Bruno Le Maire, said his government would not allow a private company to have the same monetary power as sovereign states\u201d and would join with Italy and Germany \u201cto show clearly that Libra is unwelcome in Europe\u201d.\n\nDoes it mean Libra is dead on arrival?\n\nNot necessarily. The companies backing away from it might change tack again. Visa, for example, has said its door is still open to Libra.\n\nOthers have signalled the same.\n\nWhat it does means is that governments wanting to mitigate the threat from platforms such as Libra are probably going to have to do more.\n\nThe stage is set for central banks seeking to pull the rug from under Libra by issuing their own digital currencies.\n\nWhat\u2019s got governments worried\n\nRight now, unless you use a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, any transaction you make involves a central-bank-issued currency. It doesn\u2019t matter if you never touch cash. Even if you pay for everything electronically, it involves technical transfers of government-backed cash, overseen by banks.\n\nLibra\u2019s plan would have made it possible to buy (and sell) things without ever using a national currency.\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies showed this was possible, but they lacked the stability of government-backed currencies \u2013 their value fluctuated enormously.\n\nRead more: The lowdown on Libra: what consumers need to know about Facebook\u2019s new cryptocurrency\n\nLibra promised to overcome that by being a \u201cstablecoin\u201d. It\u2019d be pretty steady. That\u2019s what made people take notice of it, and made governments concerned. If it caught on, governments could lose control of money. They might lose revenue from consumption taxes. They\u2019d find it harder to fight crime.\n\nTheir best defence is getting in first\n\nIt\u2019s why the two global agencies, the Financial Action Task Force and the Bank of International Settlements, have called digital currencies like Libra a major threat to anti money laundering efforts and financial stability.\n\nThe initial enthusiasm for Libra, both from key players in the electronic transactions and the public, shows there is demand for something that cuts out the middlemen. If Libra fails, that threat won\u2019t vanish. It will simply be postponed.\n\nSo governments are now considering developing their own central bank issued digital currencies. In the United States two members of the US House of Representatives (one a Republican, the other a Democrat) have written to Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell to press the issue:\n\nWe are concerned that the primacy of the US Dollar could be in long-term jeopardy from wide adoption of digital fiat [government created] currencies. Internationally, the Bank for International Settlements conducted a study that found that over 40 countries around the world have currently developed or are looking into developing a digital currency.\n\nHow would a central bank-issued digital currency differ from the electronic money we use now every time we transfer something from one bank to another?\n\nIt would be issued directly to the public and would not be linked to paper money at all. Transactions with it would not need to involve a bank. But the supply of it would be in the hands of governments. They\u2019d get in first.\n\nElvira Sojli, Associate Professor of Finance, Scientia Fellow, UNSW\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
