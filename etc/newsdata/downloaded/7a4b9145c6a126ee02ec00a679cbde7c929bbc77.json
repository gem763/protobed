Simply wet your hair, squeeze out any excess water (so it\u2019s still wet but not dripping everywhere), apply Elasticizer through from the roots to the ends, paying particular attention to the drier parts, then wrap up in a towel and leave for at least 20 minutes (much longer, if possible). Rinse well in the shower and follow up with your usual shampoo etc. The result is lustrous, soft, smooth hair that feels healthy and strong.\n\nBuy now\n\nLiving Proof restore perfecting spray: \u00a327, John Lewis & Partners\n\nIf your hair is dry and brittle, getting a brush through it \u2013 wet or dry \u2013 can be a nightmare and lead to further breakage. Living Proof\u2019s lightweight, leave-in conditioning spray had our brush sliding easily through hair and left no noticeable residue behind, just softer, smoother hair. We also like to spritz it through ends throughout the day to reduce frizz.\n\nBuy now\n\nSilke London the eva silk hair wrap: \u00a350, Silke London\n\nOK, so it\u2019s possible we\u2019ve gone a bit hair turban mad, but we\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised by the results of this silk wrap. It\u2019s designed to be worn at night to protect your hair from the rigours of your pillow \u2013 not something we\u2019d ever considered a problem before, but it turns out it makes a difference. Simply slip it over dry hair, channel your best 1920s movie star, and hit the hay. We found hair felt smoother, less frizzy and better nourished in the morning \u2013 all good things when you\u2019re fighting sun damage \u2013 and that we could leave longer between washes, too.\n\nBuy now\n\nCoco & Eve like a virgin super nourishing coconut and fig hair mask: \u00a334.90, Cult Beauty\n\nFounded in Bali, Coco & Eve is a brand that does summer really well: so far its range covers just self-tan and this deeply moisturising mask. It\u2019s got a beachy coconut scent (we were worried it would be cloying at first but it faded nicely through the day) and is quite loose textured \u2013 more like a thick conditioner than a sturdy balm \u2013 so it covers hair quickly and easily. Our favourite part is the included detangling brush, which you use in-shower to work the product through your hair and remove any knots. The result is super shiny, luscious locks that we couldn\u2019t stop touching.\n\nBuy now\n\nDavines SU hair milk: \u00a318.60, Treat Your Skin\n\nAt risk of sounding like your mother, prevention is better than cure, so next time you\u2019re heading out in the sun, spritz on Davines\u2019 hair milk on to wet or dry hair for protection from UV-A and UV-B rays (which can cause structural damage); think of it like sun cream for your hair. The finish is shiny and soft, with no added weight.\n\nBuy now\n\nAesop rose hair and scalp moisturising masque: \u00a325, Aesop\n\nFor itchy, flaking scalps and sunburned partings, it doesn\u2019t get much better than Aesop\u2019s moisturising mask, which, massaged into your scalp and run through your hair, is gentle and calming on the former, and gives both a nourishing dose of moisture. It has a lovely rose scent, too, which is subtle enough to be sweet rather than overwhelmingly granny-ish. Shampoo your hair, towel dry, then work in about a tablespoon of product and leave it for at least 20 minutes before rinsing out.\n\nBuy now\n\nBumble and Bumble save the day daytime protective repair fluid: \u00a335, Bumble and Bumble\n\nSave the day covers all bases for hair in the sun: camellia oil softens and helps repair damage already done, while UV filters protect it for future exposure. Apply to damp hair, then blow dry or air dry as you prefer. Hair doesn\u2019t feel like it has product in it at all, just softer and less frazzled.\n\nBuy now\n\nIles Formula signature hair turban towel: \u00a325, Net-a-Porter\n\nWe\u2019ve been using towelling turbans for years after we got fed up with wrapped hair towels coming undone and falling down mid-drying; instead, this is cleverly secured with a loop and button at the back of your head. We particularly recommend them for damaged hair as they\u2019re perfect for popping on and getting on with your day while a hair mask does it\u2019s work, and they also reduce the breakage caused by classic rough drying with a towel. Iles Formula\u2019s is available in white and grey, but we\u2019d opt for the less high-maintenance grey.\n\nBuy now\n\nKevin.Murphy young again: \u00a333, Cult Beauty\n\nIf your hair is fried \u2013 from sun exposure, bleaching or heat styling \u2013 Kevin.Murphy\u2019s leave-in oil spray delivers much-needed moisture and strength, plus hair that is touchably smoother and shiny. Apply it to the part of the hair that needs it (so if you have parched ends and greasy roots, you don\u2019t have to add more oil to your scalp) when hair is freshly washed and still damp, before drying. You can also add a few spritzes on dry hair to tame flyaways.\n\nBuy now\n\nSachajuan hair after the sun: \u00a320, Cult Beauty\n\nThis, from the Swedish haircare brand, does what it says on the tin. Like after sun for your hair, this super conditioning cream (with algae and proteins) restores moisture and shine to salty, dry, tangled hair. It can be used as a styling product, applied to wet hair, or applied more liberally and rinsed out, if you prefer (we like to leave it in). For best results, pair it with Sachajuan\u2019s hair in the sun, a UV filter to prevent damage in the first place.\n\nBuy now\n\nThe verdict: Products for sun-damaged hair\n\nOnce you start using Philip Kingsley\u2019s elasticizer, you won\u2019t be able to stop \u2013 holiday hair or no. Pair it with Davines\u2019 SU hair milk to better protect your locks next time you head for the sun.\n\nIndyBest product reviews are unbiased, independent advice you can trust.
