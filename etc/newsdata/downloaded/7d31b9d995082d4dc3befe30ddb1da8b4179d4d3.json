The result leaves the 13-times European champions bottom of their group after two games.\n\nThe draw came on the back of last Saturday\u2019s drab stalemate with neighbours Atletico and coach Zidane says his side need to be more focused on the task at hand.\n\n\u201cYour opponent can make things difficult for you and that\u2019s what\u2019s happened,\u201d he told a news conference.\n\n\u201cYou let them score a goal, they get into the game and grow. In football you need to remain focused on the task at hand from the first minute.\u201d\n\nGoalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who was substituted at half time, remains a doubt for the game through illness, while defender Nacho picked up a knee injury which will keep him out.\n\nNewly-promoted Granada have already beaten Barcelona in an unlikely run towards the top of the table and will be seeking another big scalp in the Spanish capital.\n\nBarca, who have also endured a poor start to the season, find themselves in fourth on 13 points - level with Sunday\u2019s opponent Sevilla.\n\nTheir recent upturn in form has coincided with the return of talisman Lionel Messi from injury and the Argentine pointed the finger at the club\u2019s pre-season plans as a possible reason for the Catalans being slow out of the blocks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the right path now. We knew we were in a bit of a tricky patch, but if we look all over Europe all the big clubs are having trouble getting going this season,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a bit heavy legged because of pre-season. I\u2019m not looking to criticise, but it\u2019s a reality that when you\u2019re travelling a lot you don\u2019t train well, you don\u2019t work as well as you can.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have that base of training to build on, but we are growing and bit by bit we will go adapting to our competitive schedule.\u201d\n\nElsewhere, third-placed Atletico Madrid travel to Ronaldo\u2019s Valladolid on Sunday, while bottom of the table Leganes host Levante, looking finally to get their season up and running.", "description": "Stuttering Real Madrid host high-flying Granada in an unlikely first versus second clash in La Liga on Saturday, as they look to ease the pressure on coach Zinedine Zidane.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191003&t=2&i=1436600393&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF920QV"}
