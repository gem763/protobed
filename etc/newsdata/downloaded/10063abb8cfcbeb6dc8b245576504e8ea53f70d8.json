Just prior to that, he said the Wolverines are \u201clooking to go out there and make a statement\u201d against Wisconsin on Saturday. Patterson stopped himself from getting too specific about what that statement might be, knowing that he was on the brink of offering up some prime bulletin-board material for the Badgers.\n\nBut he was tempted. He was close. Because he clearly believes we are going to see the best version of Michigan football this season on Saturday.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nThe Wolverines need to be good in Camp Randall Stadium, a place where they last won in 2001. They need to be far better than they were in muddling past Army and Middle Tennessee State to open the year. As arch rival Ohio State sprints out to an electric start with a new head coach and new quarterback, the veteran team many predicted would take down the Buckeyes in the Big Ten East is looking like Same Old Michigan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to apologize for being 2-0,\u201d Patterson said. \u201cSimple as that.\u201d\n\nNo apologies necessary, but some urgency will be. The Wolverines are facing an opponent that has allowed exactly zero points thus far in 2019. Their offense as a whole and Patterson in specific has to be better.\n\nShea Patterson and the Michigan Wolverines are 2-0 so far this season but haven't exactly impressed. Will that change against Wisconsin? (USA Today)\n\nPatterson has lost as many fumbles as he\u2019s thrown touchdowns thus far \u2014 three of each. His pass efficiency rating of 138.52 is down 11 points from last season, when the expectation was for it to jump up. After transferring from Mississippi and earning immediate eligibility, big production has not immediately followed.\n\nStory continues\n\nCurrently, the Michigan offense is 12th in the 14-team Big Ten in yards per play (5.15) and passing yards per game (226). The search for an offensive identity continues.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that quarterback has been playing hurt. He suffered an oblique injury on the first play of the first game, and it limited both his range of motion and his threat as a runner \u2014 he has 10 yards on 17 carries thus far this season. Tuesday, Patterson crisply described himself as \u201c100 percent\u201d physically for Wisconsin.\n\nAn open date helped heal his body. We\u2019ll see whether it heals the entire Michigan offense, which is getting left tackle Jon Runyan back from injury and maybe \u2014 we\u2019ll see \u2014 playmaking wide receiver Donovan Peoples-Jones.\n\nAfter scoring 14 points in regulation against Army on Sept. 7, the Wolverines went back into the workshop through an open date to try and deliver on the promise of newfound dynamism in first-year coordinator Josh Gattis\u2019 offense. But the week off from competition also provided more time for media critics, frustrated fans \u2014 and frustrated players \u2014 to dwell on the shaky showing against Army.\n\n\u201cIt was a win on paper,\u201d safety Josh Metellus said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a win for us.\u201d\n\nThat strikes a different tone from Patterson saying there would be no apology for being 2-0. Then again, Patterson is a cocksure guy, noticeably shorter than his listed 6-foot-2 height but possessing an abundance of confidence.\n\nIt\u2019s a lifetime of quarterback confidence, really. Patterson joked that his self-assuredness was rocked a bit in fifth grade when his father was his coach, but not at all since. He\u2019s been all over the map, literally, as a football player \u2014 growing up in Toledo, then playing high school ball in Texas, Louisiana and Florida. Add two colleges to the r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in a winding journey that has taken him from being the No. 1 pro-style quarterback recruit in the class of 2015 to a looming question mark in 2019.\n\nIs he good enough to lead Michigan to a Big Ten East title?\n\nThe Wisconsin game may provide the answer. If it doesn\u2019t go well, it may be time for backup Dylan McCaffrey to get his shot.\n\nShea Patterson, for one, is absolutely sure it\u2019s going to go well.\n\n\u201cI feel like we have a really good gameplan,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 We\u2019re just going to go out there and let it loose.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "Patterson and the Wolverines haven't exactly impressed in their first two games of the season.
