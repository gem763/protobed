Those demands, combined with Afghanistan's ongoing electoral process, are among the factors that make it difficult for the Taliban to make such concessions before the conclusion of a deal with the US,\" Rafiq said.\n\nA spokesman for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani could not be immediately reached.", "description": "The Taliban delegation will reportedly inform Pakistan's leadership of factors that derailed the talks with the US.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/7/8/615d493f305c432e8b05588b7dec0187_18.jpg"}
