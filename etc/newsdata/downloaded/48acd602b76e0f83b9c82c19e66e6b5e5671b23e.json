More than 128,000 people have fled their homes, the United Nations reported in July.\n\nAmnesty said it investigated on both sides of the frontline, finding \u201ca systematic disregard for international law, fuelled by the continued supply of weapons to both sides in violation of a UN arms embargo.\u201d\n\nArms exports to Libya have been banned since the 2011 revolt to overthrow dictator Moamer Kadhafi.\n\n\u201cScores of civilians have been killed and injured as both sides use everything from Kadhafi-era unguided rockets to modern drone-launched guided missiles in attacks that could amount to war crimes,\u201d said Amnesty researcher Brian Castner.\n\nAmnesty said it visited 33 attacked sites around Tripoli, including an airport, schools and field hospitals, finding evidence of possible war crimes by both sides.\n\nThe most lethal attack documented was a missile strike in July on a field hospital that killed five medics and rescuers as well as injured eight others.\n\nAmnesty established that the missile was fired from a Chinese Wing Loong drone which the United Arab Emirates operates for pro-Haftar forces.\n\n\u201cThe international community must uphold the UN arms embargo, which Turkey, the UAE, Jordan and other countries have flagrantly violated,\u201d Castner said.", "description": "Tripoli (AFP) \u2013 Amnesty International accused both sides in the fight for Libya\u2019s capital of \u201cutter disregard\u201d for the laws of", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/22/b8c186_amnesty-it-had-evidence-war-crimes-by-sides-in-fight-tripoli-libya-armed-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
