The film is historically notable on several fronts. To begin with, it featured the classic Disney song \u201cZip A Dee Doo Dah\u201d and would later become the basis for the Splash Mountain ride. The film cast a black man, James Baskett, the first live-action performer ever to be hired by the company. And it was written in part by Maurice Rapf, a member of the Communist Party, who would be blacklisted shortly after the movie\u2019s release.\n\nBut Song of the South is defined by its controversies. Set on a plantation in the Reconstruction-era American South, the film presented a rosy picture of black plantation workers and the conditions under which they existed during that era. The movie was met with protest during its original release, with critics arguing that the film papered over the complexities of black emancipation \u2014 and that, at worst, it effectively functioned as pernicious propaganda. Song of the South would be rereleased several times in the following decades, ultimately become a cultural artifact whose recurring presence would reflect fundamental things about the period during which it was reintroduced.\n\nThis mini-season of You Must Remember This, titled \u201cSix Degrees of Song of the South,\u201d leans into several ideas in the air right now: the ongoing frictions in the broader debate about race and representation, the fraught nature of progress, the place of Disney in American culture. Longworth spoke with Vulture about her perspective on Song of the South, pulling the series together, and the cyclical nature of history.\n\nWhat drew you to focus on Song of the South?\n\nWell, I had been doing some research for some people who were interested in doing a TV show about the black experience in Hollywood, as vague as that sounds. In the course of that research, I was looking through a few different things when I stumbled upon the fact that Song of the South had been written by a white screenwriter who was a communist and who would be blacklisted right after the film came out. It was something I didn\u2019t know, and I began to wonder if there were other things I didn\u2019t know about Song of the South \u2014 and then, of course, I realized pretty quickly there was a lot to dig into.\n\nAt that time, I was at a point where I didn\u2019t have a contract to make more podcasts yet, and I wasn\u2019t sure when I was going to do them again. I felt I was only going to make more episodes if I had a really strong idea, so finding out about this screenwriter, and then digging into more stories within this general area \u2026 I eventually realized there was a whole season right there.\n\nWhat was your relationship to Song of the South beforehand?\n\nI first saw it in the movie theater when I was about 6 years old. My mother used to take me to see every rereleased Disney film. Back in the \u201980s, before people really had VCRs in every house, they would rerelease every Disney film in movie theaters. There would be like three or four of them in a year \u2014 like one year you\u2019d get Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Song of the South. It was the only way to see them. My mother loved movies, and she loved going to the movies, so she started taking me to see these movies really early on, when I was about 2 years old, probably.\n\nWhy was your mom so taken with Disney movies in particular?\n\nI think she just wanted to take me to the movies, you know? Back then, there wasn\u2019t that much else that you could take a kid to.\n\nIn the first episode, you mentioned you saw Song of the South twice: once as a kid, and then once again a few months ago while researching the season. What\u2019s it like revisiting a childhood experience with all the critical tools that you have as an adult?\n\nWell, it\u2019s completely different. When I first saw it as a 6-year-old, nobody prepared me with the idea that it would be controversial in any way. That\u2019s because when it was rereleased in 1986, it was treated the least controversially than it had at any other time it was brought out into theaters, even compared to the \u201940s and \u201950s.\n\nIn the \u201940s, the film was protested both while it was being made and when it was released. It wasn\u2019t really protested when it was rereleased in 1956, but it was a little bit in 1972. And then it was definitely protested against in 1981, but not at all in 1986. That was peak Reagan America, and Song of the South had been successfully repositioned by then, I think, as a movie about racial tolerance. And that\u2019s what my mom said it was.\n\nI have to be honest: By 1986, as a white child growing up in a white family, I had not seen a lot of movies with black people in them at all. So I remember some conversation about how the movie was about how white people and black people can be friends, and certainly that remains something some people still take away from this movie.\n\nBut as an adult, seeing it much later in 2019 on a bootleg copy of the Japanese laser disc, which is the only format on which it was available \u2014\n\nWait, that\u2019s how you found it?\n\nYeah, totally. It\u2019s not commercially available in the United States, and as far as I know right now, it\u2019s not commercially available anywhere legally, although I could be wrong about that. Most of the bootleg digital files that you\u2019ll find come from this Japanese laser disc.\n\nSo, rewatching the movie recently, I realized that I had not remembered much of the live-action portion of the movie at all. The only things that really stuck with me from that viewing as a 6-year-old were the songs and the cartoon characters. But two-thirds of the movie are live action, and of course, it\u2019s a live-action drama about former slaves living on a plantation.\n\nKarina Longworth.

It\u2019s about the release of the film in 1981 and 1986, as well as the fact that they were developing the Splash Mountain ride, which is based on Song of the South.\n\nI don\u2019t really want to say too much because it\u2019s all in the episode, but it was fascinating to see the difference in reception during different times. When it was first released in the \u201940s, the New York Times and The New Yorker both ran extremely critical reviews of the film, in which they accused Walt Disney of wishing the Emancipation Proclamation had never happened. And then in the \u201980s, almost none of the mainstream-newspaper reviews dealt with that at all. When there was protest about the film in newspapers, it was usually from underground newspapers, local African-American newspapers, stuff like that.\n\nEvery time I listen to another season of You Must Remember This, I\u2019m always struck by how we seem to continuously loop back into the exact same struggles.\n\nSo, and I actually learned this term while researching the season, but some historians refer to what they call the \u201cThermidor Effect,\u201d which basically means \u2014 and I\u2019m putting this in sort of more concise language \u2014 that progress moves two steps forward, one step back. And so in times when we see progressive change, usually the culture will make a leap forward and then it\u2019ll rubber-band and there will be a backlash.\n\nYou see this with the civil-rights movement in the \u201960s, which kicks off the \u201970s, which turn out to be more conservative, which go on to become the even more conservative \u201980s. It\u2019s kind of happening right now: We had the Obama administration, which gave us the first black president, advances in gay rights, along with a few other things, and then we really bounced back to a time of almost incredible \u2014 well, incredible to some of us \u2014 conservatism.\n\nIt is definitely all cyclical, and it keeps happening over and over again. If you are not somebody who wants to reclaim some lost path, and if you do want things to keep moving forward, I think you can just take solace in the fact that things do continue to move forward. It just happens very slowly, and sometimes it will feel like we\u2019re moving further back before we can move ahead.\n\nDo you have a strong relationship with Disney as a cultural institution?\n\nYou know, I saw those movies as a kid, and I continue to love some of them \u2014 like I\u2019ve always loved Mary Poppins. But I\u2019m not a big Disney \u201cfreak.\u201d I know that there are people who just really love the brand, or they love Disneyland, or they love specific things about it. But that\u2019s not been my experience. Also, I don\u2019t have kids, so I never really had this thing of having a second generation to pass down the things that I watched as a kid.\n\nHow has making this season shifted your thinking on Disney?\n\nI\u2019m not sure if I necessarily had a fixed idea of what Disney was before doing this series, so I don\u2019t know if the season shifted anything. But I had already done an episode about Walt Disney in the \u201940s, so I knew quite a bit about his response to the animators\u2019 strike at his studio, and how that pushed him to become personally more conservative and to kind of put that personal ethos into his business practice.\n\nIt was also fascinating to learn about Michael Eisner, who came in during the \u201980s and whipped the corporate culture into shape to set up a resurgence with animated films like The Little Mermaid but also live-action films like Three Men and a Baby. The live-action touchstone movies of the \u201980s were fundamental to the company regaining its status as a Hollywood behemoth.\n\nWhat do you have planned after this season?\n\nThe next thing we\u2019re going to do, which will launch in early 2020, is a You Must Remember This spinoff where every story is written by a different freelance writer. We did a call for entries a few months ago and we ended up getting over 200 submissions. I selected eight writers, and they\u2019re working right now to essentially make episodes in the style of You Must Remember This, but it\u2019s their writing, and they\u2019re narrating. So that\u2019s going to be next January, and then I\u2019m working on another season that will hopefully come out next summer.", "description": "You Must Remember This host Karina Longworth discusses the podcast\u2019s latest season, which focuses on Disney\u2019s controversial film Song of the South.", "authors": ["Nicholas Quah"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/21/21-you-must-remember-this.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
