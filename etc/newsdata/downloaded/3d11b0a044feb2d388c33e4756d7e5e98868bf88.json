Twelve have died.\n\nOf 514 patients who gave information about their past use of vaping products, 77 percent of them said they had used products containing THC -- tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.\n\nA minority, 16 percent, say they only used nicotine products.\n\n\"These reports suggest that THC-containing products play a role in the recent cases,\" said CDC principal deputy director Anne Schuchat.\n\n\"We do not know yet what exactly is making people sick -- for example, whether a particular solvent or adulterant are leading to lung injury, or whether cases stem from a single supplier or multiple ones.\"\n\nIt was the first time that the CDC had offered such data, though they had already noted that THC had been consumed in numerous cases.\n\nThe announcement came as more and more US states, along with other countries, are considering a total ban on e-cigarettes.\n\nThe administration of US President Donald Trump is planning to ban the sale of flavored vaping products nationwide in the coming weeks.\n\nIn the two states that raised the first alarm in July about the vaping-related illnesses, Illinois and Wisconsin, 66 percent of patients said they had used products from Dank Vapes, a black market brand.\n\nOfficials in New York state had already pointed the finger at the label, one of the most prominent on the black market, earlier this month.\n\nIn most cases, those who fell ill said they had purchased pre-packaged, pre-filled branded cartridges from friends or a dealer.\n\nTHC is cut using other additives like solvents and flavors so it can be heated and inhaled with a vaping device. Investigators are hoping to figure out which of these substances could be causing the lung ailments.\n\nSo far, there is no common denominator.\n\nMost of the patients are men and young people. Many of them end up in intensive care, unable to breathe on their own. At the national level, half of those affected are 23 or younger, Schuchat said.\n\nIn Illinois and Wisconsin, in 86 patients surveyed, a total of 234 different e-cigarette products from 87 brands were found, said Jennifer Layden, the chief medical officer for the Illinois Department of Public Health.\n\n\"CDC has made it a priority to find out what is causing this outbreak of lung injuries and deaths and we\u2019re making progress,\" said director Robert Redfield.\n\nBut Schuchat said she feared there could be more deaths before a definitive answer is found.", "description": "Many of the hundreds of e-cigarette users who have developed lung problems in recent months, some of them fatal, used black market marijuana products, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday.
