The company already has 150 employees at the facility, where Ford develops its Sync entertainment and communication system. The company plans to keep growing the workforce next year. (The Record)\n\nTalking point: Ford has other tech R&D centres in Ottawa, Oakville, Ont. and Michigan. The Canadian facilities, including Waterloo\u2019s, are part of a $500-million investment the company made to expand its innovation efforts in the country. Ford\u2019s interest in developing tech in Southern Ontario puts it up against GM, which since 2018 has been working on entertainment systems and autonomous-vehicle (AV) capabilities at its Canadian Technical Centre in Markham, Ont., which has a 1,000-employee capacity. And after announcing plans to shutter its Oshawa, Ont. plant last November and cut 2,6000 jobs, GM announced a $170-million investment to keep 300 employees, some of whom would work on the company\u2019s AV testing.", "description": "", "authors": ["Catherine Mcintyre"], "top_image": "https://thelogic.co/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/WP_Logo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
