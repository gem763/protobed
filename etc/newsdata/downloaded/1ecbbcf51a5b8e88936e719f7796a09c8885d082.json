Jerome Powell Just Locked in a July Rate Cut\n\n(Bloomberg Opinion) -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell had a chance Wednesday to push back against both over-aggressive bond traders and Trump administration officials who were pounding the table for interest-rate cuts. He had the cover of not just a strong rebound in the U.S. labor market but also the backing of regional Fed presidents like Patrick Harker and Loretta Mester, who had already advocated this month for keeping the central bank\u2019s lending benchmark unchanged.\n\nInstead, in prepared remarks to U.S. lawmakers, he told the bond market and the president that a quarter-point rate cut is a sure thing at the end of the month.\n\nRather than highlighting the strength of the U.S. economy, Powell seemed to make every effort to note all the possible risks and where it\u2019s falling short. Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott, noted that in his description of the current economic situation and outlook, Powell wasted no time brushing off the first-half performance:\n\nThe economy performed reasonably well over the first half of 2019, and the current expansion is now in its 11th year. However, inflation has been running below the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) symmetric 2 percent objective, and crosscurrents, such as trade tensions and concerns about global growth, have been weighing on economic activity and the outlook.\n\nThis is more or less a snapshot of Powell\u2019s stance throughout the remarks. They\u2019re far more pessimistic than expected, focusing on trade tensions and the slowing global economy and what that sort of uncertainty might mean for the U.S. \u201cThere is a risk that weak inflation will be even more persistent than we currently anticipate,\u201d he said. That\u2019s an abrupt change of tune. So much for those \u201ctransitory\u201d factors subduing price growth that the Federal Open Market Committee saw just two months ago. Or that the latest reading of the consumer price index is still to come this week.\n\nIn a way, this is what markets expected all along. The odds of a quarter-point interest-rate cut have been stuck right around 100% since last week\u2019s jobs data. But Powell\u2019s unambiguous move toward the dovish contingent of the Fed, which thinks an \u201cinsurance cut\u201d is necessary, is nonetheless new information. To be clear, this was not a \u201chint\u201d of a July rate cut. It was a declaration.\n\nAs I wrote last week, Powell had a real opportunity with this testimony to shake bond traders from their 100% conviction. In fact, he was probably the only Fed member who could do it. My Bloomberg Opinion colleague Conor Sen and I recently discussed this idea of what it would take to break through the 100% mark, imagining this sort of conversation among two traders heading into Powell\u2019s testimony:\n\nTrader 1: I really don\u2019t think the Fed will cut rates this month. I should bet on that.\n\nTrader 2: Of course the Fed will cut. Markets have priced in a 100% chance. They\u2019ve never disappointed in that scenario and they won\u2019t this month either.\n\nTrader 1: But the jobs numbers were strong, other Fed officials have signaled they\u2019re not fully on board with a cut, inflation is still decent and stocks are at all-time highs.\n\nTrader 2: Yes. Still, the markets have priced in a 100% chance of a cut. They\u2019ve never disappointed in that scenario and they won\u2019t this month either.\n\nTrader 1: But\u2026\n\nTrader 2: The markets have priced in a 100% chance of a cut. They\u2019ve never disappointed in that scenario and they won\u2019t this month either.\n\nTrader 1: OK, you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll just wait to see if the odds fall below 100% before betting.\n\nObviously, with those sorts of conversations on trading desks around the world, no one ends up taking the first step toward pricing out an interest-rate cut. That sort of inertia requires someone like Powell to break it. It didn\u2019t happen, and that was by design.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to pinpoint what precisely persuaded Powell capitulate to easing sooner rather than later. Some will probably cite his comments that \u201can ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\u201d as evidence that he was leaning toward lowering rates in July all along. That wasn\u2019t my read, and I wasn\u2019t alone. Bloomberg Economics and Bank of America Corp (NYSE: ). were among those expecting the Fed to hold steady this month, and Citigroup Inc (NYSE: ). this week reiterated that a July interest-rate cut wasn\u2019t a done deal.\n\nIt will be worth watching how Powell answers questions about the central bank\u2019s independence and its ability to withstand political pressure. There\u2019s simply no escaping the fact that the Fed is about to lower interest rates after months of President Donald Trump demanding it do so, all the while chiding policy makers for being clueless and suggesting he has the power to fire or demote Powell. This White House views the stock market as a referendum on its economic policies, and, thanks to Powell, the reached another record on Wednesday, eclipsing 3,000 for the first time.\n\nThe debate on lowering interest rates in July is over. Now, traders will move on to ponder whether the Fed can really do just one for insurance, or whether this is the beginning of an extended easing cycle that will once again bring U.S. yields back toward all-time lows.", "description": "Jerome Powell Just Locked in a July Rate Cut", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEDAR0AQ_L.jpg"}
