Kevin Donegan, U.S. 5h Fleet Commander said in a report in Defense News on Sunday.\n\nUSNI News confirmed the details with Navy officials on Monday.\n\nVideo of the attack obtained by USNI News earlier this month showed a small boat approaching the rear port quarter of the frigate at high speeds in a straight line before detonating at the waterline below the flight deck \u2013 apparently unchallenged by the ship\u2019s company.\n\nThe explosion killed two Saudi sailors.\n\nThe unmanned boat was likely provided to the Houthi rebels by Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps forces. The U.S. and other countries have intercepted arms shipments from Iran thought to be bound for the Houthi rebels. Houthi\u2019s have used guided anti-ship cruise missile that are also used by Iran.\n\nThe IRGC, responsible for the costal defense of Iran in the Persian Gulf, has developed a variety of small attack craft based on commercial boats.\n\nThose developments have included at least one unmanned surface craft \u2013 the Ya Mahdi.\n\nAlleged to be based on a high-speed British hull, the unmanned fast boat has been in the Iranian inventory since 2010, according to reports.\n\nAccording to a 2015 U.S. Army assessment on threats from unmanned craft, \u201cutilizing suicide drones is an asymmetric strategy which both allows Iran to compete on an uneven playing field and poses a risk by allowing operators to pick and choose targets of opportunity.\u201d\n\nThe asymmetric advantage the Iranians have provided the Houthi\u2019s have been instrumental in extending the conflict, Afshon Ostovar, a professor at the Naval Post Graduate School who studies the IRGC, told USNI News earlier this month.\n\n\u201cThe Houthis have managed to hold back the Saudi coalition forces since their early successes, which might be in part attributable to Iran\u2019s continued support. The current stalemate is probably at least in part due to Iran\u2019s enduring support to the Houthis,\u201d he said.\n\nThe best-known small boat suicide attack was on guided missile destroyer USS Cole (DDG-67) which killed 14 sailors in 2000.\n\nHowever, the unmanned attack boat makes it easier to put high dollar assets at risk, Donegan told Defense News.\n\n\u201cThere are many others that don\u2019t want to martyr themselves in making attacks like that and that\u2019s pretty much where the Houthis are,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo it makes that kind of weaponry, which would normally take someone suicidal to use, now able to be used by someone who\u2019s not going to martyr themselves.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Sam Lagrone", "View All Posts Sam Lagrone"], "top_image": "https://news.usni.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/saudi_frigate.png", "published_at": "2017-02-20"}
