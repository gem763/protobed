But preferential treatment for cities that performed well is part of China\u2019s efforts to put an end to what it calls \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d measures.\n\nAccording to a draft for the key smog control zone of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei circulated on industry websites, the target for the capital itself is zero growth in emissions from last year. The remaining 27 cities will be expected to cut concentrations of PM2.5 by between 1% and 11%, or an average of 5.5% during the 2019-2020 autumn-winter season.\n\nEven a cut of 11% will not be enough to offset the increase in pollution in some cities last year.\n\nMinistry spokesman Liu did not comment directly on details, but said the ministry had already sent a draft to local governments to solicit their opinions.\n\nReuters calculations based on official data showed that only four out of the country\u2019s 28 key pollution control cities in northern China met their targets last year, including Beijing, Changzhi, Jincheng and Jining.\n\nCities likely to be given even more stringent targets this winter include Langfang, Baoding, Zhengzhou and Anyang, all of which saw double-digit percentage growth in PM2.5 last winter.", "description": "China's environment ministry said on Friday that the anti-pollution campaign for this year's autumn-winter heating season will set stricter emissions targets for cities that had higher concentrations of damaging particles last time around.", "authors": ["Min Zhang", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
