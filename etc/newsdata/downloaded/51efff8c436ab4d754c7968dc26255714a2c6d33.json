We Do the Math\n\nHere is a rundown of major events in Brussels local time:\n\nKey Developments:\n\nJohnson\u2019s Northern Irish allies, the Democratic Unionist Party, said they won\u2019t support the dealNew withdrawal agreement means customs checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the U.K. Juncker signals no more extensions, helping Johnson\u2019s cause. But it\u2019s not his call\n\nEU Likely to Grant Extension If Johnson Asks (8:55 p.m.)\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely the bloc\u2019s leaders would refuse a request for an extension if the U.K. seeks it, according to an EU official. There would need to be a reason such as an election or referendum, said the official, who added that they expect Johnson would campaign for the deal he\u2019s negotiated rather than a no-deal exit. An extension would require another summit, the official said.\n\nJavid Says No Impact Assessment, Benefits of Deal \u2018Self-Evident\u2019\n\nU.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid dismissed calls from 29 Members of Parliament for an impact assessment on the deal before they vote on it.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Washington, Javid said he doesn\u2019t think there is any need for such an analysis. \"It\u2019s self-evident that bringing certainty on the whole delivery of Brexit is a good thing,\" he said.\n\nEarlier, a group of MPs including former Justice Secretary David Gauke wrote to the chancellor asking him to look at the impact of the deal before they vote. Javid said he doesn\u2019t agree with existing government assessments which suggested earlier plans could reduce GDP by 3.9%.\n\nJohnson Will Fly Back to London to Sell Deal (8:02 p.m.)\n\nThe premier plans to return to London after the leaders\u2019 dinner concludes on Thursday night so he can spend Friday trying to persuade members of Parliament to back his Brexit agreement in a vote on Saturday.\n\nA U.K. official said he\u2019s likely to offer a package of plans intended to win over opposition Labour MPs, including protections for workers\u2019 rights and environmental standards after Brexit.\n\nIn his press conference in Brussels, Johnson said the plan for the future partnership contained important commitments to maintain the \"highest possible standards\" on \"social protection\" and the environment. \"We make those commitments gladly and they are entirely right for our country to do,\" he said.\n\nRutte Says EU Has to Accept Reality of Brexit (7:30 p.m.)\n\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte voiced sentiments shared by many leaders at the summit. \"I hate Brexit from every angle,\" he said. \"At the same time, this is the reality. The reality is that the Brits want out, and I have to help work towards a solution there.\"\n\nEU Council President Donald Tusk and Ireland\u2019s Leo Varadkar both said the door will be open for the U.K. to return one day. While European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the 48% of British voters who opposed Brexit \"were right.\"\n\nJohnson Says Another Delay Suits No One (7:22 p.m.)\n\nThe British prime minister argued that the deal delivers on Brexit, keeps the U.K. together and lays the foundation for a new relationship with the EU. \"This is our chance in the U.K. as democrats to get Brexit done,\" he said. \"I don\u2019t think delay is to the advantage of the U.K. or indeed of the whole of Europe. I think people want to move this thing on, it\u2019s been going on for a long time.\"\n\nJohnson Won\u2019t Say How He Plans to Win the Vote (7:09 p.m.)\n\nBoris Johnson didn\u2019t answer the two most critical questions when he spoke to journalists after the summit: what will he do if he loses the vote in Parliament? And did he ask EU leaders to rule out any further extension to help his case?\n\nHe said he\u2019s confident U.K. deputies will back his deal once they\u2019ve had chance to consider its merits.\n\nEU Council Shut Down Debate on Fallback Plan (7:04 p.m.)\n\nA few countries wanted to talk about how EU leaders would respond if the U.K. Parliament rejects the deal in the vote expected on Saturday, according to one EU official. That discussion, however, was quickly shut down by others around the table, the official said.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s Brexit deal with the European Union was barely agreed before it ran into trouble at home, as his Northern Irish allies in parliament said they could not support it.EU leaders meeting in Brussels Thursday endorsed the agreement, while Johnson\u2019s aides back", "authors": ["Patrick Donahue", "Nikos Chrysoloras"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/k4225nzbl16FkZ19QCbeUQ--~B/aD0xNDM3O3c9MjIwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/ff8bab1a56b5ad2bd58b9e9c1a0e1c26", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
