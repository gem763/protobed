One woman dropped $750,000 on a $3 million purchase. This greatly surprised her, because, she says, her advisor lauded the program\u2019s safety, stating \u201cIf the word came to an end tomorrow, you\u2019d be the only one with any money left.\u201d\n\n(Then again, as the world is still extant, that promise has not truly been tested. Perhaps that will serve as UBS\u2019 defense during the arbitration hearing.)\n\nThis story accompanied the news that a Chicago-area financial advisor pilfered $2 million of client assets for personal use, including $815,000 from a man who had received a settlement for being wrongfully imprisoned for 10 years. (From the frying pan into the fire.) That $2 million dollar figure was familiar: This spring, another Chicago-area advisor was convicted of stealing that same amount from his clients, several of whom suffered from life-threatening medical conditions.\n\nTechnically, the first case differs from the next two. It concerned bad investment advice, while the other two involved fraud. However, from an investor\u2019s perspective, the calamities were three of the same. People paid for professional help but instead bought disaster. They would have been better off with the first mutual fund to appear in a Google search.\n\nLess Is More\n\nLet\u2019s check that statement. When I type \u201cmutual fund,\u201d the initial entrant is an adverplacement: Thrivent Mutual Funds. Pay to play. Sigh. But I click anyway, to enter the company's site. The first fund to appear is Thrivent Aggressive Allocation (TAAAX). It carries a distressingly high expense ratio of 1.23%, but it has gained 9.8% annualized over the past decade, placing it slightly above its peer group average. That works.\n\nTruth is, it didn\u2019t matter what mutual fund I selected, as long as I didn\u2019t choose one that was leveraged or highly specialized. The worst-performing diversified U.S. mutual fund over the past decade has been Zachs Market Neutral Investor (ZMNVX), which, splendidly and poetically, posted a 0.00% annualized 10-year return through Aug. 31, 2019. Give the fund credit: It couldn\u2019t have been any more \"neutral\" than that. Also, give it credit for being better than trading options or getting fleeced.\n\nWhat I am suggesting is that investment services are \u2026 strange. Normally, it\u2019s not riskier to hire top-priced professionals than it is to use lower-cost options, or to go it alone. For example, if I visit a beautician instead of a barber, I won\u2019t get scalped. And both services have a higher expected return than my own attempts. Similarly, paying for a boutique wash rather than visiting Turtle Wash won\u2019t hurt my car, and choosing to hose it off in the driveway won\u2019t improve matters, either.\n\nBut having more money, thereby qualifying for top-level professional help, increases the chance that that something dreadful will happen to my investment account. If I have $20,000, nobody will bother with me. Odds are, I will end up picking my own mutual fund. If not, I\u2019ll walk into a bank branch, or talk to my insurance agent, and will be placed into a generic load fund. All fine--I won\u2019t be hurt by that.\n\nBut possessing $2 million raises my profile. Now I merit somebody's ill intentions. I don't mean to imply that most financial professionals are predators. Overall, wealthy investors who visit full-service professionals receive fine advice. Nonetheless, there lies the risk of encountering an outlier that causes more damage than can come from the mass-market options of robo-advisors and target-date funds, or by do-it-yourself decisions.\n\nPreventative Measures\n\nHow to prevent future occurrences?\n\nThe tools to protect investors, it must be granted, are insufficient. The form ADV provides required information about Registered Investment Advisors who control more than $25 million in assets, but not everyone who gives investment advice is an RIA, nor do all have more than $25 million. In addition, the ADV doesn\u2019t contain the critical items. It doesn\u2019t tell how an advisor\u2019s clients have fared, or what they think of the services they have received. Nor, of course, can it indicate fraud that has yet to be committed.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that disclosure about advisors is particularly poor. If I wish to research a prospective doctor, or estate planner, my tools would be no better. It is ironic, because financial professionals work with absolutely known quantities: stocks, bonds, and funds that come accompanied by detailed prospectuses, with precise records of their historic total returns. Meanwhile, their clients cannot do so. But I understand; it would be difficult indeed to present a summarized version of client results that convey the complete story.\n\nFool's Gold\n\nOne improvement investors can make is to avoid advisors who downplay investment risk. Being in the financial markets means accepting volatility. Accept that, or don\u2019t invest at all. Because the alternative consists of being talked into things that seem too good to be true--and often are. Bernie Madoff famously claimed to run a fund that never lost money. The UBS strategy promised to resist the world\u2019s demise. And the second of the Chicago-area advisors--the one who bilked ailing clients--brandished a business card that read: \u201cNot low risk. NO risk.\u201d\n\nThe precept of \u201ctoo good to be true\u201d can also be applied to looks, clothes, and cars. Most financial frauds are handsome devils, with suits to match. See, for example, the first of the Chicago-area advisors, who appeared regularly on the society pages. This indicator is imperfect, because while most good investors aren\u2019t much to look at, there are enough exceptions to make this observation no more than a gentle guideline.\n\nThose are just suggestions. Ultimately, the solution to financial-advisor fiascos rests with those companies that hire and serve them, not with investors. The trend is positive. As advisors have redefined their practices, emphasizing portfolio strategies rather than one-off sales, the possibility of disaster has declined--although not eliminated, as witnessed by UBS\u2019 problems. But the work is not complete. In particular, the safeguards against fraud must be strengthened. There\u2019s no excuse for having systems that permit advisors to withdraw their clients\u2019 assets.\n\nJohn Rekenthaler has been researching the fund industry since 1988.
