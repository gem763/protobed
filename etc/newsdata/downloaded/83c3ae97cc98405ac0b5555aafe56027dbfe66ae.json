Models and makeup artists chatted, munching on fancy crudit\u00e9s from catering. But the soundtrack lacked the usual underlying hum of blow-dryers, because hot tools and their requisite electricity were banned backstage.\n\nLike many other designers this season, Hearst was focused on the environment. But she took it a few steps further, endeavoring to create a completely carbon-neutral runway show. With the environmentalist group EcoAct, she worked out the necessary carbon-emission offsets from putting on a show, and she asked the runway production company she worked with, Bureau Betak, to cut down on power usage and waste. Taking it even further, hairstylist James Pecis and his team operated in a blackout-like environment.\n\nRather than deciding they weren\u2019t going to create any \u201chair look\u201d at all, Pecis and his team worked within the limits. \u201cI like a challenge,\u201d Pecis told Vogue.com. They created a slicked-back \u201cshellac rope braid\u201d on each model, (using Oribe\u2019s Gel S\u00e9rum), which they doubled over and tied with a thin band. A sort of fancy braided-cruller look, it was completely ecofriendly and cool.\n\nHair dryers emit around 57 pounds of carbon dioxide a year, according to one study. Just consider the carbon footprint of beachy waves.", "description": "A write-up of the New York Fashion Week Spring 2020 Gabriela Hearst show and the beauty look, which included a carbon-neutral hairstyle.", "authors": ["Kathleen Hou"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/11/11-Gabriela-Hearst.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
