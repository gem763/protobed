Along with his wife Kim, Kanye posed with a girls\u2019 swim team outside a barbecue restaurant. He\u2019s endeared himself to employees at the local McDonald\u2019s due to frequent coffee runs, a town official told The Daily Beast.\n\nOne local reporter heard an (unconfirmed) story that the 21-time Grammy Award winner was spotted walking alone down a country road, only to be picked up by a kindly stranger and driven home a few miles away.\n\nHome would be the $14 million ranch the Kardashian-West crew purchased earlier this month, a 4,500-acre property formerly known as Monster Lake. West seems to particularly enjoy spending time on his ATV\u2014perhaps too much.\n\nLast week, an employee from the state\u2019s Department of Game and Fish paid the couple a visit after Kardashian released a video of West chasing after two antelope on his four-wheeler, with his wife yelling, \u201cI think you\u2019re scaring them!\u201d (TMZ reported the two were subjected to a mere \u201clecture\u201d from the officer.)\n\nThough Kardashian made it clear on the Emmys red carpet that she \u201cloves\u201d L.A. as a native Californian and only wants to spend \u201csummers\u201d and \u201csome weekends\u201d at their pricey new home, the family of six seems quite taken with the northwestern Wyoming town, one of the largest in its area. Kim said she loves the \u201cchill\u201d pace of life. The woman who made $100 million from her cosmetics company last year loves that she \u201c[has] worn no makeup [and] sweats\u201d exclusively at Monster Lake.\n\nCody locals have a list of reasons they love their town, too. \u201cI would say we\u2019re a very conservative town that appreciates the values of the West,\u201d Barry A. Cook, Cody\u2019s city administrator told The Daily Beast. \u201cCompanies move here and look at Cody to grow. The people would like to preserve the heritage and culture.\u201d\n\nFounded by showman and frontier figure Buffalo Bill (aka William Frederick Cody) in 1896, the town wears its cowboy reputation as proudly as Kim reps Calabasas. It\u2019s known as the \u201cRodeo Capital of the World,\u201d holding amateur wrangling competitions every night in the summer.\n\nAs a pitstop on the Yellowstone Highway that leads tourists to the national park, Cody is also home to a score of museums celebrating yeehaw culture, including the Buffalo Bill Center of the West, where West held a Sunday Service last weekend.\n\nMacy Nelson lives in Billings, Montana. On Sunday, she woke up at 6 a.m. and drove two hours to get a spot at Kanye West\u2019s Sunday Service, which was advertised only on local news stations.\n\n\u201cPeople are commenting about how they don\u2019t want Kanye and Kim there because they\u2019re \u2018too much,\u2019 saying they will \u2018ruin\u2019 the town\u2019s rich history of being a \u2018small\u2019 town,\u201d Nelson explained. \u201cOthers claim that Kanye is doing the Sunday services for attention and to bring publicity to his family. However, I found exactly the opposite. He only spoke a few words the whole time and was singing with the choir the rest of the time.\u201d\n\nErika Dahlby drove nearly 150 miles from her home in Jackson, Wyoming, to see Kanye\u2019s church service. She got to the event before its doors had opened, and waiting in a line she saw on Google Maps to be over a half mile long.\n\n\u201cLooking at the line, there were little old ladies from Cody, people with their kids, and a lot of people from the regional area,\u201d Dahlby said. \u201cThere were ladies who had to be in their seventies who brought their foldout chairs. It was so cute to see people curious about who Kanye is and what his service was.\u201d\n\n\u201c There were ladies who had to be in their \u201870s who brought their foldout chairs. It was so cute to see people curious about who Kanye is and what his service was \u201d \u2014 Erika Dahlby\n\nThe Billings Gazette reported that 3,800 people showed up to the free event, which Dahlby described as a \u201cWelcome to the neighborhood party.\u201d Kanye and his 80-person choir wore matching graphic T-shirts which read \u201cWyoming\u201d above a photo of a landscape. (You could spot Ye because he wore a yellow hoodie underneath the top.)\n\n\u201cIt was cool for him to be like, \u2018This is who I am, this is what I do, this is what I\u2019m about,\u2019\u201d Dahlby said. \u201cHe almost put the [people of Cody] who are wondering, \u2018Who is this person coming into our town\u2019 at ease.\u201d According to Dahlby, when Kanye first came out, someone in the crowd yelled a friendly, \u201cWelcome home!\u201d\n\nAt one point, the choir director asked for people from Wyoming to make some noise. \u201cThen he went into name-dropping these little towns, like Powell, a town of 5,000, then Sheridan, then Billings,\u201d Dahlbly said. \u201cIt was nice that they took the time to learn where people were coming from. They made an effort to know their audience.\u201d\n\nReporter Leo Wolfson covered the Sunday Service for the local Cody Enterprise. A Brigham Young student named Kalli Roberts who attended the extravaganza told Wolfson that Kanye\u2019s show was \u201c kind of like taking cookies to a new neighbor.\u201d Wolfson told The Daily Beast he\u2019s seen a \u201cgeneral mix\u201d of reaction from townspeople regarding Cody\u2019s latest resident.\n\n\u201cThe majority of people probably feel positive more than negative,\u201d Wolfson said. \u201cI think mild interest is probably the biggest group represented of what I see. Kind of a joking, humorous thing to know he lives here now. A small group of people, mostly high schoolers, are very excited. Those who feel negative think that Los Angeles is coming to Cody.\u201d\n\nKathie, an employee at the town's Texture Salon & Spa, told The Daily Beast: \u201cKanye has been all around town. I haven\u2019t seen Kim that much. I would imagine she has someone do her own hair and makeup.\u201d\n\nAn anonymous woman who has lived in town for 28 years and works in the tourism industry told The Daily Beast of its new celebrity residents, \u201cNobody\u2019s excited about it or upset about it or anything like that. It\u2019s just what it is. Another person moving to Cody, hoping to live the dream.\u201d\n\n\u201c They talked for a little bit of time about nothing specific. Just asking some questions about the community and the area. He\u2019s very fascinated with the open spaces, and I wish him well \u201d\n\nCook, the city administrator, told The Daily Beast that he sat in on a \u201cgeneral,\u201d amicable meeting between Kanye and Mayor Matt Hall. (Mayor Hall did not respond to multiple phone and email requests for comment.)\n\n\u201c[Kanye] just wanted to introduce himself to the mayor and to the community,\u201d Cook explained. \u201cThey talked for a little bit of time about nothing specific. Just asking some questions about the community and the area. He\u2019s very fascinated with the open spaces, and I wish him well.\u201d\n\nAfter a busy weekend at the Cody Enterprise writing about the Sunday Service, general assignment reporter Wolfson says its back to local news as usual: covering the opening of a new garden at the local museum, the high school football team\u2019s first game of the season, and the national park\u2019s new electric bike policy.\n\n\u201cUnless other things happen that fall into the public purview, I\u2019m probably not going to do another Kanye West story,\u201d Wolfson said. \u201cMaybe one more article at some point wrapping up the whole ranch sale deal. We\u2019re definitely toeing the line between giving the coverage that TMZ gives to this sort of thing, and we want to separate ourselves from it.\u201d", "description": "Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West have found home on a ranch in the historic cowboy town of Cody, Wyoming.
