But more than a third routinely fail to pay off their balance in full.\n\nWith a balance left on their card the interest can soon ratchet up, making it harder to pay off the outstanding debt.\n\nThe research, by comparison service Compare the Market, says apathy is one reason for failing to switch to a new 0 per cent deal \u2013 with one in five saying they cannot be bothered to transfer.\n\nOthers \u2013 more than one in ten \u2013 say they are put off because of fears they will not be accepted by a new provider.\n\nBy contrast, the top three reasons why people do get around to moving credit cards are because their card\u2019s interest period was coming to an end, they wanted to get cashback or another reward, or they found a card that offered a longer balance transfer period to help them spread the cost of paying off their card debt.\n\nJohn Crossley, a director at Compare the Market, says the switching culture prevalent in the financial world seems to have passed many card borrowers by.\n\nHe says: \u2018The UK has woken up to the money saving benefits of switching energy tariff and insurance, so it\u2019s surprising more people aren\u2019t doing the same when it comes to their credit card \u2013 particularly when the cost of rolling on to a default interest rate is so high.\u2019\n\nAlthough the number of long-term 0 per cent deals has diminished, there are still plenty of offers with no interest to pay.\n\nCrossley says: \u2018Switching between providers is a relatively quick process but it is worth reviewing the different kind of credit cards available before making a decision.\n\n\u2018Online tools can help you check your credit score without damaging your credit rating and ensure you are on the best deal for your financial circumstances.\u2019", "description": "New research reveals that nearly half of all UK credit card holders -around 17million people nationwide - have never switched their card.", "authors": ["Sally Hamilton For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
