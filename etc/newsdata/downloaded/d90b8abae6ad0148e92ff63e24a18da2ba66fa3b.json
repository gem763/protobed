The aim is to create the world\u2019s largest stock photo library of women and nonbinary people to shatter beauty stereotypes.\n\nSeventy percent of women don\u2019t feel represented in mainstream media and advertising due to the lack of images of different body types, different races, older women and gender-fluid people. It is hoped that this resource of more than 5 000 diverse images of women will create a more inclusive image of beauty. It is an initiative that must be applauded as the focus on improving diversity and inclusivity sweeps around the world. However, in South Africa, we have to scale the conversation back. Much further back.\n\nDealing with the beauty stereotypes of women in media is an important issue as it directly affects emotional self-worth for girls and young women, but the issue of gender stereotyping has the potential to create far more dangerous ripple effects, especially in South Africa\u2019s patriarchal culture.\n\nThe recent protests around the country against gender-based violence spawned the hashtag #AmINext. We seem to go through mind-numbing cycles of outrage and new hashtags (#MenAreTrash in 2017) that are punctuated by regurgitated political platitudes when we go through the motions of the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence Against Women and Children at the end of each year.\n\nSo what can we do to prevent another hashtag from being invented the next time a horrific case of femicide hits the headlines? Which it sadly will.\n\nSouth Africa\u2019s deep-seated patriarchy is entrenched by the language we use when raising our children. We not only enforce gender stereotypes, but also automatically belittle young girls and impose limitations on them. Studies have shown that, by the age of six, gender stereotyping is embedded into children\u2019s brains.\n\nSix years old \u2013 that\u2019s the age when girls stop thinking they can be anyone and do anything they want, and when they begin to feel less capable than boys. This phenomenon is called the Dream Gap and it\u2019s an issue toy company Mattel has been tackling by producing toys that are more diverse and less gender stereotyped.\n\nThe company recently launched a range of gender-neutral dolls specifically aimed at a new generation of children who are fast accepting and adapting to a world where people can be gender fluid or nonbinary.\n\nBut if a child\u2019s changed perception is then remoulded by adult language, it becomes a futile exercise. Girls are typically praised and reaffirmed as \u201cprincesses\u201d, while boys are encouraged to be superheroes and, in a reverse Dream Gap, are told not to cry \u201clike a girl\u201d, which teaches them early on that girls are inferior.\n\nTo raise awareness of the impact of gendered speech, Finnish child rights organisation Plan International created Sheboard, a predictive texting app that corrects stereotypically gendered speech as you type. The app suggests gender neutral words and phases that are designed to empower girls, including \u201cI\u2019m capable\u201d and \u201cI deserve\u201d.\n\nSimilarly, ElaN Languages, a translation company in Belgium, introduced an online tool called the unbias button on Women\u2019s Day this year. Like Sheboard, the plug-in will \u201ctranslate\u201d biased words into unbiased alternatives. For example, \u2018fireman\u2019 is translated as \u2018firefighter\u2019 and \u2018cameraman\u2019 translates as \u2018camera operator\u2019. It will also flag biased words that affect men, so the word \u2018midwife\u2019 translates as \u2018birthing assistant\u2019.\n\nIt\u2019s not only the seeds of limitation planted in a young girl\u2019s mind that are concerning, but the seeds planted in young boys\u2019 minds that girls are inferior are worse\n\nHowever, the UK\u2019s Advertising Standards Authority is not waiting for society to self-correct. In June, it placed a ban on harmful gender stereotyping in all broadcast and nonbroadcast media, including online and social media. In a press statement, it explained the ban by stating that \u201charmful stereotypes can restrict the choices, aspirations and opportunities of children, young people and adults, and these stereotypes can be reinforced by advertising, which plays a part in unequal gender outcomes\u201d.\n\nJustice has been swift. Two advertisements \u2013 one for Philadelphia cream cheese and the other for Volkswagen \u2013 were banned in August. The Philadelphia ad portrayed two dads as incapable of looking after their children, while the Volkswagen ad showed a series of scenes including two male astronauts, a male para-athlete and a woman sitting on a bench next to a pram with the catch phrase: \u201cWhen we learn to adapt, we can achieve anything.\u201d Ouch.\n\nLike most issues involving identity politics, many would consider addressing gender stereotyping with these predictive text apps and advertising bans as a slide into an overtly politically correct world. But if gender stereotyping can be entrenched by the age of six, it\u2019s not only the seeds of limitation planted in a young girl\u2019s mind that are concerning, but the seeds planted in young boys\u2019 minds that girls are inferior are worse.\n\nAnd we know all too well what kind of harvest these bad seeds can bring when those boys grow up\n\nChang is the founder of Flux Trends\n\nTalk to us Do you think South Africans are ready to change the way we use gender stereotypes, or is this an issue most people are unaware of?
