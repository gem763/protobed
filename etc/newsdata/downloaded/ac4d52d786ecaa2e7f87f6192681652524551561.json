In fact, as even the conservative Washington Examiner acknowledges, Clinton did not say that. She said Republicans were grooming Gabbard. And far from refuting that charge, everything about Gabbard\u2019s op-ed confirms Clinton was probably right.\n\nIt is in Gabbard\u2019s interest to conflate the charge that she is working on behalf of the Republicans with the charge that she\u2019s working on behalf of the Russians. The former is apparent, while the latter is impossible to prove. Gabbard has taken some strident foreign-policy stances that follow no apparent American dovish objective, and do line up with Russian goals. While Gabbard presents herself as a noninterventionist, she bizarrely attacked the Obama administration for failing to bomb Al Qaeda in Syria, while crediting Russia for allegedly doing so:\n\nBad enough US has not been bombing al-Qaeda/al-Nusra in Syria. But it\u2019s mind-boggling that we protest Russia\u2019s bombing of these terrorists. \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 1, 2015\n\nWhen reporters found that Russia was in fact using Al Qaeda as a pretext to attack non-Al Qaeda rebels opposed to the Assad regime, Gabbard dismissed those reports as lies:\n\nMainstream media promoting false narrative: Russia bombing American-backed rebel forces. Russia bombing al-Qaeda/al-Nusra not US allies. \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 1, 2015\n\nShe later met with Assad, has continued to take positions that line up with the interests of Syria (and its patron, Russia) and has won the support of Russia\u2019s propaganda apparatus. Again, none of this proves anything untoward. Some people have weird beliefs. It is possible for an American to honestly arrive at positions that happen to line up with Russia\u2019s, and in such an instance it would be natural for Russia and its allies to reward that confluence of interest with meetings and friendly propaganda messages.\n\nWhat is very clear, however, is that Gabbard is now working hand in hand with the Republican party. This is apparent in her pattern of working closely with Republican-controlled media, like \u201cHill TV\u201d \u2014 John Solomon\u2019s propaganda outlet \u2014 and Sean Hannity. Gabbard used both forums to promote Republican talking points discrediting the impeachment process \u2014 i.e., \u201cMost people reading through that transcript are not going to find that extremely compelling cause to throw out a president that won an election in 2016\u201d \u2014 before eventually reversing course.\n\nGabbard\u2019s Journal op-ed today is the clearest sign yet of her future course. There is no line in the piece committing Gabbard to running exclusively in the Democratic primary. It doesn\u2019t even mention the primary. It has an ambiguous passage that merits close examination. Read this a few times:\n\nThis isn\u2019t a petty \u201cspat\u201d between Mrs. Clinton and me. It\u2019s a serious contrast in views about the choice voters face as they decide which Democratic candidate is best equipped to defeat President Trump. Mrs. Clinton already lost to Mr. Trump once. Why would Democrats think a Hillary 2.0 candidate would result in anything different?\n\nThis could be an argument for Democrats to nominate Gabbard. But it\u2019s not exclusively an argument for that purpose. It could just as well be turned into an argument for Gabbard as a second \u201cDemocratic\u201d candidate running against Trump, using a familiar Ralph Nader/Jill Stein case that the Democrats are going to fail, so you should vote instead for the superior alternative to the GOP.\n\nIn the following paragraph, Gabbard makes her strategy even more apparent. \u201cWhether Mrs. Clinton\u2019s name is on the ballot or not,\u201d she writes, \u201cher foreign policy will be, as many of the Democratic candidates adhere to her doctrine\u201d of endless regime change, etc. Gabbard is saying right now that any Democratic nominee is going to be Hillary Clinton. What does that tell you about her intentions?\n\nThe Journal editorial page is not normally enthusiastic about running screeds denouncing the bloodstained neocon war machine. But it\u2019s happy to make an exception for somebody who\u2019s in the electing-Republicans business.\n\nGabbard\u2019s op-ed is structured as an apparent refutation of the claim Clinton made about her. In fact, nothing could do more to vindicate Clinton\u2019s suspicion that Gabbard is being groomed by the Republican party as a spoiler candidate than a Wall Street Journal op-ed previewing her case for a spoiler campaign.", "description": "Tulsi Gabbard has written a Wall Street Journal op-ed attacking Hillary Clinton.
