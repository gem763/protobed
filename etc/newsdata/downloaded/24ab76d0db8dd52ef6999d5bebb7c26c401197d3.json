When they bend him back into the foetal position to remove fluid from the base of his spine with a long, threatening-looking needle, it almost breaks,\" he says.\n\nIt was later discovered Ivan had cerebral palsy and a severe form of epilepsy that led him to have 20 or 30 seizures in a day.\n\nMr Cameron also pays tribute in his memoirs to \"the extraordinary compassion in our health service\" and \"the best of the NHS\" who helped look after his son.\n\nReflecting on his experience helping care for Ivan, the former Tory leader says: \"A world in which things had always gone right for me suddenly gave me an immense shock and challenge.\"\n\n\"Nothing, absolutely nothing, can prepare you for the reality of losing your darling boy in this way. It was as if the world stopped turning.\"\n\nImage copyright PA Image caption The Cameron family in London in 2006\n\nMr Cameron's wife Samantha told the Times in 2017 her son's death \"overshadowed everything\" and rendered the outside world \"meaningless\".\n\n\"Like anyone else in my situation, I just kept going. You have to deal with it, because you have no choice.\"\n\nShe also said it changed her husband's politics, saying: \"It made him understanding, though he couldn't be too subjective.\"", "description": "The paper claims the ex-PM has only ever felt \"privileged pain\" and reflects on the death of his son.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/2FBE/production/_108822221_david-cameron.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
