The vast majority of Call of Duty players are so casual, so mainstream.\"\n\nSeth Barton, editor of gaming industry magazine MCV, agreed that the boycott was unlikely to have a significant impact.\n\nActivision Blizzard didn't have much choice in the matter, he argued: \"by allowing any such protests it would have to either allow all such protests, or become arbiter of what's acceptable and what's not\".\n\nBBC News has contacted Activision Blizzard for comment.\n\nWhy are some gamers angry with Blizzard?\n\nNg Wai Chung is the name of the gamer banned for 12 months by Blizzard. He uses the pseudonym Blitzchung.\n\nDuring a post-match interview on the official Hearthstone Taiwan video stream, he donned a gas mask and shouted: \"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age.\"\n\nBlizzard said tournament rules said players must not offend people or damage the company's image.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption 100 days of protests in Hong Kong in 100 seconds\n\nOther US technology have become embroiled in the controversy over Hong Kong.\n\nChina's state media this week criticised Apple for listing an app in its app store designed to track the movements of police officers in Hong Kong.\n\nThe People's Daily newspaper said the app was an endorsement for \"rioters\".\n\nThe tool, HKmap.live, was not named explicitly by the newspaper.\n\nIt works by asking users to cite the locations of police and anti-government protesters.
