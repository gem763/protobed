The EU has called on Malta to drop them.\n\nAn independent public inquiry\n\nThe Maltese government agreed to launch a public inquiry last month, just six days before a deadline that had been set by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.\n\nBut Reporters Without Borders, citing Maltese journalists, has said that there are concerns that there about the inquiry's impartiality including conflicts of interest amongst board members.\n\nThe special rapporteur sent by the EU's parliamentary assembly also said that the Maltese government's inquiry \"as currently constituted\" did \"not meet the Assembly's expectations\".\n\nIn a report published in September, the UK House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee said that the UK Foreign Office \"should publicly press for an independent judicial public inquiry in Malta into the murder of the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.\"\n\nThe Commons' committee emphasised: \"her death should set a precedent for accountability and not, as it does currently, for impunity\".\n\nIn a statement released to recognise the two year anniversary of her assassination, David Sassoli, the President of the European Parliament said: \"It is never acceptable to die because you are doing your job.\"\n\nThree men have been under arrest since December 2017 and are due to stand trial for the murder. However, police are continuing their investigations to try to find out who ordered the killing, and why.\n\nEuronews has asked the Maltese government to respond to the allegations in the Reporters Without Borders report.", "description": "The climate of press freedom in Malta \"remains dire\" two years after investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was killed in a car bomb, Reporters Without Borders has claimed in a comprehensive new report.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/23/38/30/1000x563_cmsv2_c9cefb63-633f-50f7-9820-6be0e67b3c59-4233830.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
