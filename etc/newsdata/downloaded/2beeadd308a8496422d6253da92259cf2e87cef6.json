Michael Bennet (D., Colo.), a relatively moderate presidential candidate, told The Wall Street Journal\u2019s editorial board this week. Underlying that hostility, Mr. Bennet immediately acknowledged, is a grudging respect for Mr. McConnell\u2019s effectiveness: \u201cI think we need to be as strategic as Mitch McConnell is.\u201d\n\nThe central example is Mr. McConnell\u2019s refusal in 2016 to fill the Supreme Court vacancy created by Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death. \u201cThe worst thing that\u2019s been done in the last 10 years, and maybe in our history, in terms of judges is what he did on Merrick Garland, \u201d Mr. Bennet said. (Worse than what his party did to Brett Kavanaugh, he added in response to a question.)\n\nMr. McConnell agrees on the significance of what he did in 2016, calling it the \u201cbiggest accomplishment of my career.\u201d On the day Scalia died in February, the Kentucky Republican declared that no Supreme Court nomination would reach the floor that year. The next president would fill the vacancy. It was a gamble. He needed at least 50 of the other 53 Republican senators to stick with him.\n\nThey did, and one of them attributes Donald Trump\u2019s victory to it. \u201cThat call, in a close presidential race, tipped the race,\u201d says Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming. It clarified the choice for conservative voters who found Mr. Trump\u2019s character appalling.\n\nMr. McConnell, 77, has been instrumental in Mr. Trump\u2019s successes on Capitol Hill, too. He delivered tax reform in 2017 with a 51-48 majority and no help from Democrats. He allowed the First Step Act of 2018, a criminal-justice reform bill that he had opposed, to come to the floor and pass with bipartisan support\u2014including his own vote. And he\u2019s pushed through judicial confirmations at a record clip. \u201cWe intended to take full advantage of the opportunity to continue to transform the courts for as long as we have the ability to do so,\u201d he says. His motto is \u201cleave no vacancy behind.\u201d\n\nNot that Mr. Trump always appreciates his efforts. The president blamed the majority leader for ObamaCare\u2019s survival after the late Sen. John McCain bolted. \u201cCan you believe,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted in August 2017, \u201cthat Mitch McConnell, who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years, couldn\u2019t get it done.\u201d But the two men put aside their differences the following month at a White House lunch. At an October 2018 rally in Richmond, Ky., Mr. Trump called Mr. McConnell \u201cthe greatest leader in history.\u201d\n\nIn some ways Mr. McConnell is Mr. Trump\u2019s opposite\u2014a taciturn insider rather than a bombastic outsider. From the start of his Senate career in 1985, his ambition was to be majority leader. He begins discussing it on page 5 of his 2016 memoir, \u201cThe Long Game.\u201d He made a name for himself by defending Kentucky\u2019s tobacco industry and opposing campaign-finance regulations. Outside the Senate, those stances brought more opprobrium than popularity. But inside, Mr. McConnell quietly built support as he rose in the ranks to majority whip in 2003, minority leader in 2007, and majority leader in 2015 after Republicans took the Senate.\n\nThe Senate has changed dramatically in the 35 years since Mr. McConnell\u2019s arrival. \u201cThere\u2019s been a kind of realignment of the two parties to the point where almost every Republican is more conservative than every Democrat and almost every Democrat is more liberal than almost every Republican,\u201d he says. Some observers bemoan this polarization, but not Mr. McConnell: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s necessarily a condemnation of today\u2019s Senate.\u201d\n\nIt does, however, lead to condemnations from whichever party isn\u2019t in charge. \u201cWe have the least effective Senate,\u201d Mr. Bennet told the Journal, accusing his colleague of hypocrisy. Five years ago, then-Minority Leader McConnell inveighed against the \u201ctyranny\u201d of Harry Reid, who led the Democratic majority, \u201cand the fact,\u201d in Mr. Bennet\u2019s words, that Mr. Reid \u201cnever let anything go through regular order, and the fact that we never had amendments.\u201d Mr. McConnell is doing the same, Mr. Bennet said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got all these theoretically grown-up people down there who literally never vote on an amendment.\u201d\n\nSome Republican senators echo these criticisms, albeit in private. Mr. McConnell declines to answer them, but an aide tells me the majority leader doesn\u2019t plan to change course: \u201cWhen he has tried open debate, it fizzles out pretty quickly because individual members block each other\u2019s opportunities to offer amendments.\u201d\n\nMr. McConnell usually manages to hold his caucus together despite the grumbling. In 2017 he rallied all 52 Republican senators to abolish the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees, allowing the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch\u2014something he probably couldn\u2019t have done had Mr. Reid not done the same for lower-court nominations in 2013.\n\nMost bills still require 60 votes to reach the floor, and Mr. McConnell believes this is as it should be. \u201cThe legislative filibuster is one of the key safeguards of American government,\u201d he says. \u201cIt makes persuasion necessary and makes policy less likely to swing wildly with every election. America doesn\u2019t need a second House of Representatives. America needs the Senate to be the Senate.\u201d He says he\u2019ll fight to retain the legislative filibuster if Democrats take the Senate in 2020 but declines to discuss his strategy.\n\nThe tax bill passed with a simple majority through a process reserved for budget bills, but even that requires near-unanimity among Republicans, who now hold 53 seats. Mr. McConnell follows the Pareto principle, also known as the 80/20 rule. \u201cYou wear 20% of your ties 80% of the time,\u201d he says, \u201cmeaning 80% of your ties, you only wear 20% of the time. It applies to a group too. You spend 80% of your time with 20% of your members. Most of the time is spent with the people who are high-maintenance or who like to create challenges.\u201d Usually, he adds, \u201cI do things one-on-one\u2014for a number of reasons. Because it doesn\u2019t embarrass somebody in front of somebody else.\u201d\n\nThe foremost member of the 20% club is Maine\u2019s Susan Collins. Her vote is often the hardest to get and the most needed. Ask Republican senators who won the most favors in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, and they\u2019ll invariably answer Ms. Collins. It was worth it, Mr. McConnell says. Her vote was critical, and she really wanted to vote yes, so long as the bill helped Maine. \u201cMitch\u2019s strength is understanding that each of us represents a state that may be different from Kentucky,\u201d says Ms. Collins, one of only two GOP senators from states Hillary Clinton carried in 2016.\n\nMs. Collins also saved Justice Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination last year after he was accused of youthful sexual misconduct. \u201cMitch didn\u2019t know how I was going to vote,\u201d she says. \u201cHe did not ask and I didn\u2019t volunteer.\u201d She told him over lunch immediately before announcing her \u201cyes\u201d vote in a speech that methodically dismantled the case against Justice Kavanaugh. The vote to confirm was 50-48.\n\nIn May a constituent in Paducah asked Mr. McConnell what he\u2019ll do if a high-court vacancy arises in 2020. \u201cOh, we\u2019d fill it,\u201d he replied. When I ask him to elaborate, he says he\u2019d do it even at the 11th hour. Mr. McConnell allows that \u201cit would be hard to process even a noncontroversial Supreme Court nominee\u201d\u2014perhaps by now an oxymoron\u2014\u201cin under two months. But certainly we would try if that happened.\u201d\n\nThe left finds that prospect alarming. \u201cIf there is a SCOTUS vacancy next year and @senatemajldr carries through on his extraordinary promise to fill it\u2014despite his own previous precedent in blocking Garland\u2014it will tear this country apart,\u201d David Axelrod, a top White House aide during President Obama\u2019s first term, tweeted last month.\n\nMr. McConnell scoffs at the charge that he\u2019s hypocritical and points to his statement on the Senate floor nine days after Scalia\u2019s death. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s within the president\u2019s authority to nominate a successor even in this very rare circumstance,\u201d he said then. \u201cRemember that the Senate has not filled a vacancy arising in an election year where there was divided government since 1888, almost 130 years ago. But we also know that Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution grants the Senate the right to withhold its consent, as it deems necessary.\u201d\n\nMr. Axelrod\u2019s histrionics are mild compared with other attacks on Mr. McConnell. At a Louisville restaurant last October, a man snatched the takeout box from his table and emptied it on the street. Also in Louisville, a mob assembled last month outside his house, and Twitter suspended his campaign\u2019s account after it posted a video of their obscene shouts.\n\nHe shrugs off most of it; aides describe him as impervious. \u201cI learned a long time ago that the higher you go up in politics, the more criticism you get,\u201d he says, \u201cand that just sort of goes with the job. I\u2019m largely unaffected by the criticism of those who have a totally different agenda. I get up every day hoping I can advance a right-of-center agenda. . . . And to the extent that we\u2019ve succeeded in doing that, and I think most would concede that I have, I\u2019ve got my share of enemies who don\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\nHe did respond indignantly in July to being called \u201cMoscow Mitch\u201d for opposing two bills intended to thwart Russian interference in the 2020 election. In a speech on the Senate floor, he called the smear \u201cmodern-day McCarthyism.\u201d He says he opposed the bills because Democrats had stuffed them with provisions having no connection to Russia.\n\nWhat got to him, he says, was being \u201ccalled unpatriotic, un-American, and essentially treasonous by a couple of left-wing pundits on the basis of boldfaced lies.\u201d\n\nMr. McConnell has served longer than any current senator except Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy and Iowa Republican Chuck Grassley. He arrived on Capitol Hill in 1968 as an aide to then- Sen. Marlow Cook and later worked as a Justice Department lawyer and returned to Kentucky for a stint in local government. In 1984 he challenged Democratic Sen. Dee Huddleston, known for missing votes to give paid speeches. Roger Ailes, then a GOP consultant, produced ads for Mr. McConnell featuring bloodhounds searching for Mr. Huddleston. Mr. McConnell won by 5,269 votes.\n\nHe is now in his sixth term and seeking a seventh, which he is strongly favored to win. But he worries about the majority come 2020. \u201cColorado is a competitive state for us, and so is Arizona, and so is North Carolina,\u201d he says, referring to the seats now held, respectively, by Sens. Cory Gardner, Martha McSally and Thom Tillis. \u201cOn the other hand, we think we\u2019re going to win the Alabama seat back\u201d\u2014the one Democrat Doug Jones holds by virtue of beating Roy Moore in a 2017 special election. Republicans will hold their majority if they lose no more than three seats, or two if a Democrat wins the White House.\n\nMr. McConnell credits Democrats for helping. \u201cOur people are very energized by all this left-wing socialist talk on the Democratic side,\u201d he says. \u201cNot only do our voters but our donors believe that the Senate is a firewall against the very worst that could happen if the Democrats get the entire government back.\u201d\n\nMr. Barnes is a senior columnist for the Washington Examiner.", "description": "Sen.
