There, past piles of empty beehives, on a wall of metal shelves, were stacks of wooden disks \u2014 all that remains of 39 trees taken down in 2014 from Great Mountain Forest in the northwest corner of the state.\n\nThese cross-sections of tree trunks, known as stem disks \u2014 or more informally as cookies \u2014 are telling a potentially worrisome tale about the ability of forests to be critical hedges against accelerating climate change. As anyone following the fires burning in the Amazon rainforest knows by now, trees play an important role in helping to offset global warming by storing carbon from atmospheric carbon dioxide \u2014 a major contributor to rising temperatures \u2014 in their wood, leaves, and roots. The worldwide level of CO2 is currently averaging more than 400 parts per million \u2014 the highest amount by far in the last 800,000 years.\n\nBut Marra, a forest pathologist at the Experiment Station with a Ph.D. in plant pathology from Cornell University, has documented from studying his fallen trees that internal decay has the capacity to significantly reduce the amount of carbon stored within.\n\nHis research, published in Environmental Research Letters late last year and funded by the National Science Foundation, focused on a technique to see inside trees \u2014 a kind of scan known as tomography (the \u201cT\u201d in CAT scan.) This particular tomography was developed for use by arborists to detect decay in urban and suburban trees, mainly for safety purposes. Marra, however, may be the first to deploy it for measuring carbon content and loss associated with internal decay. Where there is decay there is less carbon, he explains, and where there is a cavity, there is no carbon at all.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re suggesting is that internal decay in trees has just not been properly accounted for,\u201d says Marra.\n\nWhile the first round of his research was a proof of concept that necessitated the destruction of 39 trees to show that tomography is accurate, his ultimate goal is a nondestructive technique to enable better assessments of carbon sequestration than those done annually by the U.S. Forest Service. Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, ratified in 1994, governments are required to report annual estimates of carbon holdings in all their managed lands. The most recent Forest Service figures show that U.S. forests offset about 14 percent of the nation\u2019s carbon emissions each year.\n\nThe Forest Service estimates that carbon makes up 48 to 50 percent of a tree\u2019s biomass, so ones with decay will be less dense and therefore hold less carbon. But Marra contends that the visual signs monitored by the Forest Service, such as canopy and tree size, along with conspicuous problems such as lesions or cankers, don\u2019t accurately reflect internal decay \u2014 a tree that looks healthy may have decay and one that appears problematic may be fine inside.\n\nIn addition, he says, foresters typically use a mallet to hammer a tree to register a sound that might indicate it\u2019s hollow. \u201cYou know that there may be a hollow, but you don\u2019t know how big the hollow is,\u201d Marra says. As a result, he believes the government\u2019s baseline data used to estimate carbon storage are not accurate.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of ways to improve our estimates of carbon being stored above ground in forests, and this decay component could certainly prove to be important,\u201d says Andrew Reinmann, an ecologist and biogeochemist with the City University of New York\u2019s Advanced Science Research Center. But, he added, \u201cWe haven\u2019t really had the technology to explore this before \u2014 it\u2019s still a little bit of an unknown.\u201d\n\nMARRA USED a two-stage system for his research: sonic tomography, which sends sound waves through the tree, followed by electrical resistance tomography, which transmits an electric current. Both processes are necessary to fine-tune each other\u2019s readings.\n\nThe system, which costs about $25,000 and fits in a backpack, is cheap and small by scientific equipment standards. Each reading takes no more than a few minutes and computerized visual renderings of the results appear instantly.", "description": "Collart Herv\u00e9/GettyThis story is part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 220 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate story.By Jan Ellen Spiegel BOB MARRA\u00a0navigated his way to the back of a dusty barn in Hamden, Connecticut, belonging to the state\u2019s Agricultural Experiment", "authors": ["Undark Magazine"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/a3K2kqezDfVIH8yfdqkxdw--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/ae2621a271e91f05b0abec963d424452", "published_at": "2019-09-22"}
