When a trainer lurking on the field gets hit by the ball that team should cop a penalty, not get the feed in the scrum...much less given that it cost the Raiders a try ffs \u2014 Peter van Onselen (@vanOnselenP) October 6, 2019\n\nThe entire trajectory of this game has changed because the ball hit the trainer. And they get the scrum feed? There needs to be a limit to the number of times trainers can come on, screaming instructions! #NRLGF \u2014 Leonie Ryan (@LeonieFRyan) October 6, 2019\n\nOn a train in Italy trying to work out what on earth has happened in the #NRLGF. A Roosters trainer was on the field and then? Can anyone clue me in, please? \u2014 Melinda Farrell (@melindafarrell) October 6, 2019\n\nBut speaking on the season finale of Fox League\u2019s NRL360 host Paul Kent railed against the rule, slamming the fact the NRL haven\u2019t changed the law to suit the modern game.\n\n\u201cThe problem with this is that it\u2019s an archaic rule that\u2019s been around since year one and doesn\u2019t really take into account that trainers are always on the field,\u201d Kent said. \u201cThe problem I have with this is why two and a half minutes into a game is a trainer already game.\n\nFox Sports journalist James Hooper was on the panel and unreservedly agreed.\n\n\u201c100 per cent, it\u2019s a joke,\u201d Hooper said. \u201cWhy is he out there? The game isn\u2019t even three minutes old.\u201d\n\nCo-host Ben Ikin said the rule was written when there one referee when trainers weren\u2019t as big an issue.\n\nKent said it was from a time when the trainers weren\u2019t running messages.\n\nBut he also had some hope for NRL fans who don\u2019t want to see that debacle again.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that they\u2019re on there for strategic reasons, not medical reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cI spoke to Todd Greenberg today and he said \u2018this hopefully is an opportunity over the summer to address trainers being on the field. If there\u2019s one thing that annoys fans very much is the trainers on the field coaching them like they\u2019re under-eight\u2019s.\u201d\n\nHooper said the rule had a big impact on the game.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just another example of the rub of the green that clearly went against the Raiders early,\u201d he said. \u201cCanberra didn\u2019t see the ball for a number of sets afterwards. The Roosters were just camped on their line creating opportunity after opportunity so I can understand why Raiders fans were frustrated by that moment.\u201d\n\nFormer Broncos and Panthers coach Anthony Griffin joined the panel later and said the ensuing try was the biggest moment of the match for in his eyes.\n\n\u201cI thought the first try lost it for them, they had to start fast,\u201d Griffin said. \u201cThe first try that Verrills scored it was a fairly soft try as grand final tries go. They had to get in front of the Roosters. Once they get in front, they\u2019re very hard to get past. That six points was the difference all night and made the Roosters a little comfortable, made the Raiders have to chase and that was the difference in the end.\u201d", "description": "It may have been seen as the lesser controversy of the NRL Grand Final but a spotlight has focused on a bizarre moment early which has exposed an \u201carchaic\u201d rule that needs to be changed.", "authors": ["Andrew Mcmurtry"], "top_image": "https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/40e0c5fdb33ca29907e8b5b7a6b6e4bf?width=650", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
