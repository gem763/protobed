Some of the most interesting utilise legitimate gameplay mechanics in interesting ways. In The Outer Worlds, for instance, a decent chunk of time can be saved by simply making your character a complete buffoon.\n\nDedicated players have been hard at work lowering their times in The Outer Worlds over the past few days, with Twitch streamer Jabo being the most consistent. Earlier today, he posted a brand new world-record time of just over 20 minutes, and it\u2019s likely he\u2019ll push that even lower with repeated attempts. As with most speedruns, Jabo\u2019s world record couples precise execution with in-depth knowledge of the game\u2014but near the end, it\u2019s all about having the dumbest character possible.\n\nThe Outer Worlds allows players a good deal of freedom during character creation. This includes the ability to lower stats in addition to improving them, which means it\u2019s possible to turn the protagonist into a physical weakling to make room for enhanced shooting prowess or even dumbing them down so much that it affects the way they speak to NPCs. By setting the main character\u2019s intelligence to \u201cbelow average\u201d while building out their stats, several humorous dialogue options become available over the course of the game, one of which skips a portion of the endgame.\n\nAt a point late in The Outer Worlds, players return to the Hope, the colony ship from which they were saved at the beginning of the game. After ADA, the AI that accompanies the player through much of the game, is patched into the ship\u2019s computers, they\u2019ll be given a set of choices as to what to do next. These all involve skipping\u2014the Outer Worlds term for faster-than-light travel\u2014the Hope to a new location, and upon choosing one, the player can tell ADA that they plan to handle the skipping themselves.\n\nADA is wary of this option, seeing as it\u2019s a highly technical process best left to supercomputers. With high enough intelligence and science skills, a character can easily handle it. But those with low enough intelligence are given a \u2018dumb\u2019 option: \u201cStand back, ADA. I know numbers real good.\u201d\n\nAnd, despite a bit of back and forth between ADA and the Hope, the player is allowed to do so. They promptly steer the Hope directly into a nearby star, destroying the ship and killing everyone on board. This also nets the player an achievement labelled \u2018Sunburn.\u2019 It also counts as finishing the game, albeit with a tragic ending.\n\nCompleting this mission normally will send players into the game\u2019s final mission, but thanks to this useful bit of dumbassery, the story comes to a close early. Since this ending was discovered, The Outer Worlds speedrunners have utilised it to shave off a few precious minutes and push their times even lower. It\u2019s not a huge skip, but it\u2019s easy enough to perform that its inclusion in a possible world record run is a no-brainer. It\u2019s also possible that a new category will be created to separate runs that exploit it from the rest, depending on how the speedrunning community reacts to its potential.\n\nNo matter what happens, it\u2019s cool to see the quirks of this Obsidian-developed RPG come into play in such an interesting way.\n\n(h/t PC Gamer)", "description": "There are all kinds of speedrunning strategies out there, from finding ways outside the boundaries of the game world to manipulating seemingly random elements for favourable outcomes.
