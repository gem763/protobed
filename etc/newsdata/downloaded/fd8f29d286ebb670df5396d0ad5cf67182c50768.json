His campaign finally acknowledged it this week.\n\nAdvisers to the former vice president began lowering expectations about winning both Iowa and New Hampshire \u2014 where more than 90 percent of the primary vote will be cast by white voters \u2014 and directing attention toward South Carolina and the South, where black voters will cast a majority of the primary vote in a handful of states on Super Tuesday.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nIt doesn\u2019t mean Biden is conceding the first two nominating contests, just that his campaign views South Carolina \u2014 where more than 60 percent of the primary voters are African American \u2014 as the one early primary it absolutely cannot afford to lose.\n\nIt\u2019s the clearest evidence yet of his campaign\u2019s theory of the case, which is rooted in Biden\u2019s strength among black voters \u2014 a vestige of the former vice president\u2019s service in the Obama administration. African Americans back Biden by outsized margins in both the Palmetto State and nationally, which makes South Carolina the linchpin of Biden\u2019s early-state strategy.\n\nSouth Carolina, the campaign expects, will function as a firewall within the early state gauntlet and as a springboard to Super Tuesday, where anywhere from two-thirds to 28 percent of the electorate is black, depending on the state.\n\n\u201cSouth Carolina is key because it\u2019s the first state with a substantial African American population. And black voters have traditionally been the key to securing the Democratic nomination and, right now, they\u2019re with Joe Biden,\u201d said Symone Sanders, a top Biden adviser. \u201cIf one wants to say it\u2019s a must-win, we think we\u2019re going to do extremely well there.\u201d\n\nAccording to two advisers who requested anonymity and a source who spoke with Biden, Biden\u2019s campaign believes he needs to win two of the first four early states. One of those states probably needs to be Iowa or New Hampshire, the sources said. But he can\u2019t get blown out in either \u2014 or in the third early state, Nevada, which Biden has visited less often than the others.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see any path for Biden to win the nomination without South Carolina,\u201d said Mark Longabaugh, a longtime Democratic strategist who\u2019s neutral in the race and worked for Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign. \u201cAfrican American support for Biden is crucial for his candidacy.\u201d\n\nWinning black voters in South Carolina, the campaign hopes, would have a force-multiplier effect since any candidate who carries the black vote by big margins \u2014 in the southern states generally and in their heavily African American congressional districts specifically \u2014 gets a windfall due to delegate allocation rules.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a delegate game,\u201d Sanders said, repeatedly mentioning that any Democratic nominee must build a \u201cbroad, diverse coalition\u201d that primarily includes blacks, whites and Hispanics.\n\nThat point \u2014 a dig at the other candidates who have comparatively little nonwhite support \u2014 was emphasized repeatedly earlier this week during a \u201cfall preview\u201d conference call that the Biden campaign hosted with reporters.\n\nDuring that call \u2014 for the first time \u2014 campaign officials began setting expectations for Biden\u2019s early state performance.\n\n\u201cDo I think we have to win Iowa? No,\u201d one senior adviser said, adding that the first caucus state is nevertheless \u201ccritical.\u201d Later, turning to the first primary state of New Hampshire, the adviser noted that \u201cas you all know, historically, there\u2019s an incredible home field advantage for a Massachusetts candidate or a New Englander\u201d \u2014 a not-so-subtle reference to Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden speaks during a June campaign event in Iowa \u2014 a state the campaign said he does not have to win. | Joshua Lott/Getty Images\n\nCliff Albright, co-founder of the group Black Voters Matter, and others who specialize in turning out the African American vote say black voters have stuck by Biden for two major reasons. First, he was the loyal running mate and No. 2 to the first African American president, Barack Obama. Secondly, he\u2019s perceived as the most likely candidate to beat Trump.\n\nStill, Biden\u2019s strategy for the South could come apart depending on what happens up North. If he loses Iowa and New Hampshire, Biden could see his South Carolina advantage evaporate because he could no longer make a compelling electability argument after getting beaten in two major contests. That happened to Hillary Clinton in 2008 when Obama scored an upset win in Iowa and shattered her aura of invincibility.\n\n\u201cIt spells trouble if he has slippage in Iowa and New Hampshire,\u201d said Adrianne Shropshire, founder of the African American political group BlackPAC. She noted that South Carolina could be a must-win for all the candidates, not just Biden. \u201cIt\u2019s important to him and it\u2019s equally important to the other front-runners as well,\u201d she said.\n\nBiden\u2019s advisers say they\u2019re well aware of recent primary history \u2014 especially in light of the candidacies of California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, both of whom are black. But neither has, at this point in the 2020 race, come anywhere close to drawing the same level of support as Obama did in 2008.\n\nAs a result, a Biden win in South Carolina wouldn\u2019t just give him momentum heading into the rest of the South, but it would also seriously damage the candidacies of Harris and Booker, said the Rev. Joe Darby, first vice president of the NAACP\u2019s Charleston Branch and an influential pastor from Nichols Chapel AME church.\n\n\u201cIf their numbers do not rise in South Carolina,\u201c he said, \u201cit\u2019s time for some serious prayer and thoughtfulness about what they do next it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t make the mistake Hillary made and take the black vote for granted. You\u2019ve still got to work at it. And I think his [Biden\u2019s] folks are working at,\u201d Darby said. \u201cHe\u2019s making the rounds.\u201d\n\nBiden, whose campaign co-chair is a former head of the Congressional Black Caucus, Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, began ramping up his black voter outreach in July, after Harris and Booker attacked his record on race.\n\nLate last month, the campaign began stumping in select hair salons and barbershops to spread the word. Last week, he traveled to South Carolina for four rallies, including an event at historically black Clinton College in Rock Hill.\n\nBefore Biden traveled to South Carolina last week, he made a point to sit down with black reporters and gave an unprecedented ask-me-anything interview for 90 minutes, followed by another meeting with local African-American reporters.\n\nBiden\u2019s campaign has also hired a South Carolina faith director, Michael McLain, to network with churches, which provide a better way to reach African American voters in the state than going through the traditional party structure. More than 39 pastors in the state have endorsed Biden.\n\nMorning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

And later this month, the campaign is dispatching Keisha Lance Bottoms \u2014 mayor of majority black Atlanta \u2014 to South Carolina.\n\nOn Sunday, Biden travels to Montgomery, Alabama, for his first visit as a 2020 candidate.\n\nThe key to maximizing delegates in Super Tuesday states like Alabama is to win big both statewide and in Democratic congressional districts.\n\n\u201cI would argue that it isn't necessarily district-specific as it is performance both statewide and across the districts,\u201d political scientist Josh Putnam, who maintains the Frontloading HQ blog that tracks primary states and delegate counts, said via email. \u201cBoth Obama (2008) and Clinton (2016) cleaned up in that manner, sweeping through the African American-heavy South and building a delegate lead that ended up being small (Obama) to large enough (Clinton) but insurmountable. Biden is certainly seeking to replicate that, but it goes through South Carolina first (and that likely hinges on how the first three contests go).\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s adviser, Symone Sanders, said the campaign is ready to withstand multiple candidates fighting hard in the first three states. But the field will winnow by the time South Carolina rolls around on Feb. 29, followed by Super Tuesday three days later.\n\n\u201cWe believe there are a number of people who are going to be competitive in Iowa and New Hampshire,\u201d she said. \u201cBut not as many folks will be able to compete at the level we\u2019re competing at when it comes to South Carolina and definitely when you go into Super Tuesday.\u201d\n\n", "description": "His path to the Democratic nomination goes through the South.", "authors": ["Marc Caputo"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/05/8b/192193d54e7dbcff039cb955ac51/20190905-biden-sc-church-july-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
