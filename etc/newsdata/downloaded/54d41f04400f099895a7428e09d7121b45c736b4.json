For the sixth time that afternoon, the Redskins quarterback had been sacked by a New England Patriots defender.\n\nWhether it was pressure, miscommunication or rust, McCoy did not create the impact the Redskins had wanted in Sunday\u2019s 33-7 loss to the New England Patriots. Coach Jay Gruden named McCoy the starter days earlier after trying to keep his decision a secret all week. On Friday, Gruden, citing the quarterback\u2019s experience, announced the change.\n\nThe Redskins offense had stalled the last two games as Case Keenum and Dwayne Haskins struggled to move the chains in losses to the Chicago Bears and the New York Giants. Gruden felt a change was necessary and McCoy, his desired quarterback from the start, was suddenly healthy after missing eight weeks with a leg injury.\n\nBut against the Patriots, the Redskins\u2019 offensive woes remained.\n\nGruden said McCoy rushed a few throws early, adding \u201crightfully so.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had trouble picking up some stuff, which we have practiced and worked with, worked against all week, all year,\u201d Gruden said. \u201c(McCoy) handled some things pretty well, I think. We have to do a better job around him.\u201d\n\nMcCoy\u2019s final stat line wasn\u2019t pretty. In his first start since breaking his leg last December, the quarterback threw for 119 yards on 18 completions to 27 attempts. He was intercepted once.\n\nThe latter was McCoy\u2019s worst decision of the day. With under a minute left in the first half, the 33-year-old was not on the same page as his target, Steven Sims, and threw a pass right to New England Patriots cornerback Jason McCourty. The Patriots took over at the 27-yard line, in prime position to score.\n\nMcCoy appeared to be expecting Sims to break inside, but the receiver went the opposite direction.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a hard one,\u201d McCoy said. \u201cI haven\u2019t played with these guys a lot. I haven\u2019t practice with them a lot. But I\u2019ll take the blame for me.\u201d\n\nMcCoy\u2019s start, though not a surprise, was controversial, given Gruden benched Keenum and did not turn to Haskins.\n\nDuring the week, Gruden declined opportunites to endorse the first-rounder. In last week\u2019s loss to the Giants, Haskins replaced Keenum in the second quarter, but threw three interceptions.\n\nGruden said Friday he made his decision to start McCoy \u201ca long time ago.\u201d The coach was criticized when he told New England reporters he did not have a plan at the position, a comment he later downplayed to local media.\n\nMcCoy, though, looked befuddled against the league\u2019s No. 1 defense. At one point, he missed a wide-open Terry McLaurin \u2014 though, admittedly, it could have been hard to see him as McCoy was soon on the run to escape the pressure upfront.\n\nAfter the loss, Gruden did not address who will start at the position next week. The Redskins are now 0-5 and the clamor for Haskins will remain. Gruden does not feel the 22-year-old is ready, though he was the backup Sunday with Keenum nursing a foot injury.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, McCoy said it was a \u201ctough day.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to paint any other picture,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to score more than seven points. I felt fine physically. But when you get down a couple scores to these guys, it\u2019s a hard thing to just drop back and throw with their pass rush and their defense. We put ourselves in a hole.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
