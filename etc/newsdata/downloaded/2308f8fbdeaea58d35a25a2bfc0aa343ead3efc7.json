And the Democratic Party is scared out of their minds because this pay-for-play scheme doesn\u2019t just involve Biden.\n\nThe big question that has to be asked is in 2015 when \u201cThe New York Times\u201d first exposed the enormous conflict that Biden had in Ukraine and criticized him, how could you have your son taking money from a corrupt oligarch \u2014\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMACCALLUM: Yes, he was asked about it many times.\n\nGIULIANI: Why didn\u2019t Obama stop it? Any honest president would have stopped it.\n\nMACCALLUM: You know what, there\u2019s \u2014 there are indications that they were concerned in the Obama White House about it, that they talked to him about it several times \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: But why didn\u2019t they stop it?\n\nMACCALLUM: And that they didn\u2019t want to \u2014 that they didn\u2019t want to step in. Maybe they wish they had \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Why? Because they have no sense of ethics.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nMACCALLUM: But let me ask you something \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Is this very similar to Hillary, and the Clinton Foundation?\n\nMACCALLUM: Let me just stay with this for one moment \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Is it similar to Hillary and Clinton Foundation?\n\nMACCALLUM: Is the \u2014 absolutely, there are parallels. Absolutely.\n\nGIULIANI: Are we starting to see a pattern now?\n\nMACCALLUM: Perhaps. I\u2019m not going to read anything into \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Is it possible \u2014 is it possible if we break this open we\u2019re going to find out the Obama administration might be one of the more corrupt administrations in a very long \u2014 is it possible?\n\nMACCALLUM: We\u2019ll see. I mean, we\u2019re going to follow \u2014 we\u2019re following already.\n\nGIULIANI: And is it possible that Democrats \u2014 is it possible that Democrats would cover that up?\n\nMACCALLUM: Does it bother you \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: And fight for their lives, and have Schiff going out violating laws in order to frame the president of the United States.\n\nAnd make no mistake about it, the president of the United States is extremely serious, and there are lawyers working on it right now about suing those guys directly, individually \u2014\n\nMACCALLUM: You said that, yes.\n\nGIULIANI: Not a joke, not a threat. It\u2019s a difficult legal endeavor, and we\u2019ve got lawyers working on it as we speak. And thank you, Schiff, because you keep lying every day.\n\nHe knew about the whistleblower \u2014\n\nMACCALLUM: We reported that \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: And he lied about it?\n\nMACCALLUM: We reported that. Let me ask you this \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: For four weeks.\n\nMACCALLUM: I guess a lot of people look at the situation, from the State Department \u2014\n\nGIULIANI: Schiff \u2014", "description": "Friday, during an appearance on the Fox News Channel, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, now serving as an attorney for President Donald Trump, defended his efforts to track down alleged wrongdoing by former Vice President Joe Biden regarding Biden's son Hunter Biden, U.S. policy and Ukraine. | Clips", "authors": ["Jeff Poor"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Giuliani105-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
