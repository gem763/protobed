(Photo: ETTORE FERRARI, EPA-EFE)\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer is opening up about her own #MeToo moment when she was a 20-year-old actress.\n\nIn an interview with The Sunday Times, the former Catwoman said it took some time to realize what happened to her and to come to terms with the fact that it wasn't OK.\n\n\"First, I thought, 'Well, I didn\u2019t experience that,' but then as time went on I started going, 'Well, actually, there was that one time,' \" Pfeiffer told the outlet.\n\nShe added that, at first, she blamed herself for what happened.\n\n\"There\u2019s that process you go through \u2013 denial, self-blame, 'I shouldn\u2019t have worn that dress,' 'I should\u2019ve known.' You look at it through a grown-up lens and think, 'Wow, I was a kid,' \" Pfeiffer said. \"There were a number of situations that were not good.\"\n\nThe \"Maleficent: Mistress of Evil\" star went on to talk of the time when she was 20, she buried the incident from the encounter with a \"high-powered person in the industry.\"\n\n\"Like one incident \u2013 I am not going to share \u2013 but I look back and I cringe,\" she said about the unnamed man. \"I was really uncomfortable and it was inappropriate. I put it in a drawer.\"\n\nPfeiffer noted that if the man is still alive, she would write to him to express how he made her feel.\n\nShe also added that she uses her platform as an actress to tell these difficult stories: \"Sometimes you can make a bigger statement by representing someone you wouldn\u2019t ever want to be, rather than hitting people over the head by preaching and getting up on your soapbox. Sometimes it\u2019s a more effective and interesting way to get things across.\"\n\nPfeiffer noted that it's not easy for her or her fellow colleagues to open up about these types of experiences.\n\n\"It was challenging for women of my generation to find their voices,\" the actress said. \"And even though slowly, over time, we have been given more permission to speak up, if you grow up not really having your voice valued or heard or encouraged, the way you view yourself and your place, it\u2019s pretty set.\"\n\nIn a 2017 interview with the Today Show, Pfeiffer was asked about the #MeToo movement and if she's experienced anything similar.\n\n\"I've had situations,\" she said. You just didn't talk about it\u2026 there's so much shame involved in it.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2019/10/21/michelle-pfeiffer-recalls-inappropriate-experience-hollywood-metoo/4051007002/", "description": "Michelle Pfeiffer is opening up about an uncomfortable and inappropriate moment with a \"high-powered\" industry person.", "authors": ["Rasha Ali", "Published A.M.
