He won his two previous starts this season at the New York Islanders and Dallas Stars.\n\nSamsonov has been long hailed as the goalie of the future in Washington. Holtby\u2019s contract is up at the end of this season, so this could spell the beginning of the end for his long tenure with the Capitals.\n\nAfter Monday\u2019s game, Reirden mentioned that he and the staff were at the point of making a decision every night on which goalie to start, rather than just defaulting to Holtby as the No. 1 in standard situations.\n\n\u201c[Samsonov is] doing what he\u2019s supposed to be doing, and that\u2019s to make it like a decision every night of who\u2019s going to be considered to play that game,\u201d Reirden said. \u201cHe\u2019s been solid in his showings and we\u2019ll continue to evaluate appropriately for what gives our team the best chance to have success.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
