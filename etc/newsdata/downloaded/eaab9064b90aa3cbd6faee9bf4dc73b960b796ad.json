Such mail can include high-value items like mobile phones, memory sticks or pharmaceuticals.\n\nFor consumers, the issue has largely been overlooked.\n\n\u201cWhatever happens, prices to ship via the postal network ... It\u2019s going to cost more,\u201d said Kate Muth, executive director of the International Mailers Advisory Group, which counts companies like eBay, DHL, Amazon AMZN, -0.49% , USPS or their affiliates as members. \u201cThe rates are going to go up.\u201d\n\nSome have dubbed the withdrawal prospect \u2018Pexit,\u2019 short for \u2018Postal exit,\u2019 after the manner of Brexit.\n\nCompanies might have to decide individually how to manage such increased rates, either by swallowing the costs or passing them on to customers.\n\nOne of the few companies to chime in publicly has been eBay EBAY, -0.30% , whose grassroots network has warned of possible \u201cservice disruptions and dramatically increased costs for shipping through the US Postal Service\u201d if the United States pulls out.\n\nThe administration complains that China and many other countries get to pay lower reimbursements because they\u2019re classified as developing countries, putting U.S. companies at a disadvantage. It wants postal services like USPS to set their own rates \u2014 and right away, not months from now.\n\n\u201cToday, manufacturers in countries as small as Cambodia and as large as China pay less to send small parcels from their countries to New York than U.S. manufacturers do to ship packages from Los Angeles to the Big Apple,\u201d Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro wrote in the Financial Times on Sept. 11. He said other countries like Canada, Norway and Brazil are also losing money from the UPU\u2019s \u201cdistorted system.\u201d\n\nNavarro said the U.S. opposes one of three options being considered that would maintain limits on the amount that postal systems like the USPS can charge overseas shippers.\n\nThe meeting may also be a test for a growing battle of diplomatic clout: China has been ratcheting up its presence in multilateral institutions, while the Trump administration has been largely shunning them.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce and others have praised the Trump administration, which has led a multi-tiered challenge to China\u2019s rising economic might notably on trade issues, for finally stepping up to try to level an allegedly unfair playing field that has been bemoaned by several U.S. administrations.\n\nIn a Sept. 16 letter to Navarro provided to The Associated Press, the chamber\u2019s chief policy officer, Neil Bradley, wrote that the Trump administration\u2019s walkout threat has put the UPU \u201con the brink of accepting the most meaningful reform to inter-postal compensation arrangements in 50 years.\u201d\n\nHe wrote that the UPU reform debate \u201cwould never have materialized\u201d without the \u201ccourage\u201d of the Trump administration to contemplate withdrawal.\n\nThe State Department last year formally indicated that the United States would quit the UPU, an organization it helped create, on Oct. 17 if reforms can\u2019t be agreed. The administration says the United States will start setting its own rates for reimbursement \u2014 so-called \u201cself-declared rates\u201d \u2014 whether or not it stays in.\n\nSome have dubbed the withdrawal prospect \u201cPexit,\u201d short for \u201cPostal Exit\u201d \u2014 a cheeky allusion to Brexit, Britain\u2019s impending departure from the European Union, which likewise carries great uncertainties.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what exactly would happen if the U.S. pulls out of the postal group. Some influencing factors include whether nonpostal operators can fill the void or how soon bilateral deals between the United States and postal partners could be enacted.
