The number was 33 last year.\n\nTedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, said that his organisation remains fully committed to ensuring that all necessary resources are made available to eradicate the last polio virus strain.\n\n\"The achievement of polio eradication will be a milestone for global health. We urge all our other stakeholders and partners to also stay the course until final success is achieved,\" he said.\n\n'We cannot relax'\n\nMatshidiso Moeti, the WHO regional director for Africa, said: \"We cannot relax. Countries must strengthen routine immunisation to protect communities, ramp up routine surveillance so that we are able to detect even the slightest risk of polio re-emerging.\"\n\n191002055300864\n\nPolio invades the nervous system and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours. It cannot be cured, but infection can be prevented by vaccination - and a dramatic reduction in cases worldwide in recent decades has been due to intense national and regional immunization campaigns in babies and children.\n\nIn unvaccinated populations, however, polio viruses can re-emerge and spread swiftly. Cases of vaccine-derived polio can also occur in places where immunity is low and sanitation is poor, as vaccinated people can excrete the virus, putting the unvaccinated at risk.\n\nThe Philippines last month said it was planning an emergency vaccination campaign after polio re-surfaced and caused the first two recorded polio cases there for 20 years.", "description": "The UN health agency says strain of polio virus eradicated, meaning only polio type 1 still circulating.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/5/13/d9da3d49a8c74608bf0fcbea0c4ec2c9_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
