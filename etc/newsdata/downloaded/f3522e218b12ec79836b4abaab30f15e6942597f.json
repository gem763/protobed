Susan Davis to step down after 10 terms", "language": "en", "published_at": "2019-09-04", "text": "Rep. Susan Davis, a long-serving member of Congress from San Diego, announced Wednesday that she will not seek another term.\n\nIn a statement, the 75-year-old Davis said she\u2019s ready to return to her Southern California home after serving in Congress since January 2001.\n\n\u201cI have struggled to make this very difficult decision,\u201d she wrote in an email to constituents. \u201cOther than the near weekly cross-country commutes, there is a lot I will miss about representing you in Washington. The opportunity to serve and contribute has been everything I could have ever imagined.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know what I will do next but I know there are many ways to serve our community,\u201d she added.\n\nHer departure is unlikely to threaten the Democratic majority in the House - Democrats hold a roughly 2-to-1 registration edge over Republicans in the 53rd District.\n\nHillary Clinton carried the district in the 2016 presidential election by 35 points over then-Republican candidate Donald Trump.\n\nDemocrats control the House 235-197, with one independent and two vacancies in North Carolina that are scheduled to be filled in special elections next week.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a solid Democratic seat. I can\u2019t think of many Republicans who represent parts of that district who could plausibly run,\u201d Brian Adams, a political scientist at California State University, San Diego, said in an email.\n\nDavis focused her work on military affairs and education. She is the second highest-ranking Democrat on the House Education and Labor and Armed Services committees.\n\n\u201cThe sacrifices of our service members and their families have always been uppermost in my mind,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cSometimes finding common ground has been challenging, especially in this increasingly divisive political climate,\u201d David wrote. \u201cI have stood my ground when the values we share are threatened.\u201d\n\nRep. Cheri Bustos, D-Illinois, who chairs the Democrats\u2019 campaign arm in the House, recalled traveling with Davis to Afghanistan to visit troops who weren\u2019t able to be with their families on Mother\u2019s Day.\n\nHer \u201cselfless service \u2026 could be most readily seen in the small things she did, away from the lights and cameras,\u201d Bustos said in a statement.\n\nDemocrats dominate politics in California, and the party holds a 45-8 edge over Republicans in U.S. House seats in the state. Democrats picked up a string of GOP-held House seats in the state in 2018, including four all or partly in Orange County, California, a one-time nationally known GOP stronghold southeast of Los Angeles.\n\nAnother fight is shaping up in the neighboring 50th District for 2020, where indicted Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter could face multiple challengers from within his own party. Last month, former GOP Congressman Darrell Issa formed an exploratory committee as he considers a run against Hunter.\n\n___\n\nBlood reported from Los Angeles.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Rep.
