I have always been one of the most important players and one of the players that puts everything on his back. I never backed out of that,\" Neymar said.\n\n(Image: X90184)\n\n\"I have always carried out my role in the team well. When a player reaches a certain level, it is normal to get different treatment. Messi gets treated differently at Barcelona.\n\n\"Is it because he is more handsome? No. It is because of everything he does. It is part of football.\"\n\nHe added: \"I am happy in the national team and I am happy at my club. Everyone knows what happened in the summer window and how I wanted to leave.\n\n(Image: Brazilian Football Confederation)\n\n\"I am comfortable and happy at the club today. I am not just happy in the national team. I started the season well. I will defend my club with my skin and teeth.\n\n\"I will give them 100 per cent so we can achieve great things. If I am doing well in my club I will make it to the national team.\"", "description": "Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar says he always shoulders the expectations of his country", "authors": ["Jake Polden", "Image", "Brazilian Football Confederation"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20551888.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_FILE-PHOTO-File-photo-of-Neymar-Lionel-Messi-and-Cristiano-Ronaldo-three-of-the-worlds-most-popu.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
