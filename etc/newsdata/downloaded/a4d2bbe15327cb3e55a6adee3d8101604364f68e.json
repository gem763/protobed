(Michael Robinson Chavez/The Washington Post)\n\nMaryland\u2019s medical marijuana regulators abruptly stalled a planned market expansion on Thursday after one company sued them and an influential group of state lawmakers separately complained of \u201cimpropriety.\u201d\n\nThe delay prolongs a three-year effort to enhance diversity among medical marijuana wholesalers and raises new questions about whether laws passed to remedy past regulatory missteps are working as planned.\n\nThe Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission is set to disband Tuesday under reforms adopted in 2018, and regulators were rushing to approve new licenses in advance of the creation of a replacement commission.\n\nNow, an industry launched amid legal and political controversy faces it again.\n\nA Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge late Wednesday temporarily blocked regulators from issuing new growing or processing licenses, ruling as part of a lawsuit alleging the commission illegally excluded one of the license applicants, a firm identified in court papers as Remileaf, LLC.\n\nSeparately, black lawmakers raised concerns that as the 200 companies that applied for the new 14 licenses learned whether they were among the top-ranked firms, it appeared minority-owned companies were again being left out of the lucrative industry.\n\n\u201cI have too many African Americans that worked extremely hard, put in a whole lot of money ,\u201d said Del. Darryl Barnes (D-Prince George\u2019s), chair of the Legislative Black Caucus. \u201cFor them to not have the opportunity, it doesn\u2019t sit well with me. . . . We want to ensure that the process is done fairly. From the phone calls that we have received, there seems to be some impropriety going on.\u201d\n\nBarnes and Del. Cheryl D. Glenn (D-Baltimore City), the former caucus chair who spearheaded the effort to boost diversity in medical marijuana industry, declined to elaborate on the allegation.\n\nThe black caucus asked commissioners Wednesday for a delay and \u201cto ensure that all companies are truthful in their disclosures about minority ownership, and their financial status.\u201d In an interview, the lawmakers said they were pressing the commission to fully investigate claims by winning bidders that they represented disadvantaged minority groups.\n\nThe industry expansion was mandated by the General Assembly at the behest of the black caucus after the inaugural licensing process did not select any African-American-owned firms to grow the drug, despite a state law requiring diversity in the industry.\n\n\n\nCommission chair Brian Lopez said the panel halted the issuance of new licenses because investigators needed to more thoroughly look at the identities of the winning firms, whose applications were reviewed and ranked in a blind process. He said that the decision was made irrespective of the judge\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cOur intention is to get the process right,\u201d Lopez said, declining to say whether minority-owned firms were among the top-ranked companies and noting that none of the top-ranked companies have been publicly identified. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of rumors out there.\u201d\n\nIn remarks to reporters, Glenn suggested the process was not working as she had envisioned. She said the new licenses were created \u201cnot for the purposes of expanding the footprint to hedge-fund companies,\u201d but to benefit black people.\n\n\u201cAfrican Americans are the ethnic group that\u2019s been most disproportionately impacted by marijuana laws for years,\u201d Glenn said. \u201cAnd so it\u2019s time for Maryland to set the standard in this country to say that African Americans can have a part in the ownership of medical marijuana.\u201d\n\nMaryland\u2019s medical marijuana industry is booming, with several growers doubling or tripling production to meet demand. Lawmakers are also considering whether to legalize recreational use of the drug, in part to help finance a landmark education plan to reduce racial inequity and disparate achievement in public schools.\n\nAfter a rocky start delayed by lawsuits and political uncertainty, sales began in late 2017.\n\nRead more:\n\nA bigger crop: Why Maryland\u2019s medical pot growers are adding more plants\n\nMedical marijuana has arrived in Maryland, and sales have begun\n\nPotent pot, vulnerable teens trigger concerns in first states to legalize marijuana\n\nLocal newsletters: Local headlines (8 a.m.) | Afternoon Buzz (4 p.m.)\n\nLike PostLocal on Facebook | Follow @postlocal on Twitter | Latest local news", "description": "Legislative black caucus alleges African-Americans again left out of medical marijuana industry and a judge ordered regulators not to", "authors": ["Erin Cox", "Local Reporter Covering Maryland State Politics", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/PSYkl-Ad9nUwZat2cBb3k69UwEY=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KNRX4ZGPJQI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
