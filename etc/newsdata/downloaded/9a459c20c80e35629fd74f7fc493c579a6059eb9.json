For the three top-polling candidates -- and the man they hope to succeed -- it will be defined by a succession of firsts:\n\nFor former Vice President Joe Biden, it will be the first debate in which his Democratic rivals may risk criticizing him over his son Hunter\u2019s business dealings in Ukraine and China, which have been the target of unrelenting attacks from President Donald Trump. Biden has warned his rivals of risking party unity to do so, and attacking him on the debate stage has failed to score them points in the three previous debates.\n\nFor Elizabeth Warren, the forum will be the first opportunity to defend her statistical tie with Biden and perhaps rise into the lead, and the first chance to defend her status as the standard-bearer for the progressive wing of the party against Bernie Sanders.\n\nFor Sanders, it will be his first public appearance since a heart attack on Oct. 1 forced him off the campaign trail. He will either appear robust, or risk prolonging the questions about his fitness for the job of president.\n\nAnd one not participating will be at virtual center stage. Tuesday\u2019s contest is the first debate since since House Democrats began an impeachment inquiry of the president in connection with his July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in which Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate the Bidens.\n\nAll of the candidates agree that Trump should face impeachment proceedings, though Biden was the last to get on board. They won\u2019t miss an opportunity to hammer home that point on live television.\n\nFor many of the lower-polling contenders in the field of 12 on stage, the largest ever, the debate could be a last gasp for their campaigns.\n\nThose candidates will all push to have a \u201cmoment\u201d that gets media attention and helps them build support. They will also seek to do damage to another candidate who is chasing after the same voters.\n\nFor some, the goal will simply be to have a steady enough performance to qualify for November\u2019s debate, for which the Democratic National Committee has set even more stringent polling and fundraising requirements than the ones that were in place for the September and October debates.\n\nBiden initially avoided engaging with Trump about the unfounded allegations against him and his son, a reticence that threatened to undermine his claim that he would beat Trump \u201clike a drum\u201d in the general election. In recent weeks, though, he has been increasingly forceful.\n\nMany of his opponents -- including Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Beto O\u2019Rourke -- have suggested that work like Hunter Biden\u2019s should not be allowed for the children of a president or vice president to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. Some could take the same kinds of shots at Biden at the debate.\n\nOn Sunday, Hunter Biden announced that he would leave the board of a Chinese firm at the end of October and would forgo all foreign work if his father were elected president.\n\nWhile it could be tempting to go after Biden, some candidates have found that that tactic can backfire. Julian Castro\u2019s attempt last month to question Biden\u2019s memory led one congressional endorser to flip -- from Castro to Biden.\n\nPete Buttigieg, however, plans to be more combative than in previous debates, especially with the progressive candidates like Warren and Sanders, two aides told Bloomberg News.\n\nThat fight is most likely to be sparked by their biggest fault line: health care. Sanders and Warren embrace a Medicare for All proposal that would establish a government-run system that would abolish private insurance, while most of the other candidates, including Buttigieg, favor adding a public option to the existing system that\u2019s largely reliant on private insurance.\n\nThe debate will include all of the candidates who appeared at the September forum: Biden, Warren, Sanders, Harris, Booker, Buttigieg, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Castro, Amy Klobuchar and Andrew Yang.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- The Democratic candidates will meet for the fourth presidential debate on Tuesday after an extraordinary series of events that has dramatically altered the race since the last forum in September.The debate on the campus of Otterbein University, outside Columbus, Ohio, is hosted by CNN", "authors": ["Jennifer Epstein"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uu1BLBtCezEd8Zu.gc17KA--~B/aD0yMDUwO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_politics_602/1ec883031d9b1c3dc0c1e086a7b21988", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
