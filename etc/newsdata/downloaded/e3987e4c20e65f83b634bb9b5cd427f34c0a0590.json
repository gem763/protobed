On Tuesday. Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) told reporters that \u201cI understand he\u2019s reconsidering. I do not think we should abandon the Kurds.\" When asked to clarify, a Cassidy spokesperson said the senator saw reporting that cited Trump may be rethinking the withdrawal.\n\nAnd Sens. Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) wrote to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to request an all-senators briefing from top officials in the Defense and State departments as well as the intelligence community.\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS POLITICO Playbook Sign up today to receive the #1-rated newsletter in politics.

Yet it\u2019s the latest example of Trump tuning out the GOP\u2019s hawkish wing, which feels more emboldened to challenge Trump on foreign policy than other matters, and aligning himself with Paul\u2019s worldview.\n\nTrump is even adopting Paul-style rhetoric, using the #EndEndlessWars hashtag on Twitter as Republicans from Graham to McConnell to Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) expressed dismay with the president\u2019s decision, and lawmakers threatened to challenge the president through legislation. Paul returned the favor by comparing Trump\u2019s removal of troops to the actions of Ronald Reagan after a bombing in Lebanon.\n\n\u201cI for one appreciate the president being consistent in his policy that the goal was to eradicate ISIS,\u201d Paul said. \u201cFrankly, I just don\u2019t think it has to be the U.S. obligation to figure each of the world\u2019s problems out.\u201d\n\nYet more surprising than the Republican disgust for Trump\u2019s strategy shift in Syria was the condemnation from dovish Democrats as well. Paul has teamed with them in the past to disentangle the U.S. from Saudi Arabia but found himself relatively alone this week, with only GOP Sen. Mike Lee of Utah and Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida joining him to defend Trump.\n\n\u201cThere are Democrats who probably do think it was ill advised to be in the middle of the Syrian civil war but they\u2019ve gone quiet or dormant since their preoccupation is more in expressing their displeasure for Trump,\u201d Paul said. \u201cThe Republicans are predictable\u201d in their opposition.\n\nSarah Ferris and Wesley Morgan contributed to this story.\n\n", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/03/e0/60f3dc1c4e168f2ff41baf5d1caa/190303-rand-paul-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
