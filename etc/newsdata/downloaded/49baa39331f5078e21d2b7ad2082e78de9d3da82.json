The pro-environment groups and individuals gathered in large numbers immediately while a movement also gained momentum on social media.\n\nWhat followed was an outpouring of emotions from all corners of Aarey, an improvised Chipko movement also surfaced as people hugged the trees that have been blatantly chopped. Several celebrities and key people from the political and sports arenas also lent their support to the cause.\n\nBut none of this could deter the emboldened spirit of Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited as the police provided them security to cut down the trees while detaining the protesters instead. The saga continued for well over two days, involving strict orders as well as imposition of Section 144.\n\nOver the past two days, a staggering total of at least 2134 trees have been chopped, with which the MMRC maintained in the court, has served its purpose. The Supreme Court restrained authorities from cutting anymore trees in Aarey. A special bench comprising justices Arun Mishra and Ashok Bhushan said it will have to examine the entire thing and posted the matter for hearing on October 21 before its forest bench.\n\n\"It appears to us that it was some kind of forest at some time,'' the top court said, and asked the Maharashtra government to not cut any more trees. The state government assured that it won't cut any more trees as whatever trees were required to be cut for the proposed project have already been cut down.\n\nThe court had convened special sitting by converting a representation by a group of law students into a Public Interest Litigation. In the meanwhile, Section 144 was lifted in the run up to the urgent hearing of the case but was imposed once again.", "description": "The Supreme Court of India in its order on petitions demanding stay on the trees being felled in Mumbai\u2019s Aarey Colony has ordered that no more trees should be cut while also recording an undertaking by the Maharashtra government to assure the same.
