As the Conservatives pointed out at the time, even Goodale voted to endorse the traditional definition of marriage in 1999.\n\nScheer said he would not re-open the debate on same-sex marriage. But did not say whether his own stance had changed.\n\n\"If the person who wants to be prime minister can't even summon the fortitude to say, 'Yes, I think it's OK that you get married,' then that's an issue,\" Mercer said.\n\nMercer took calls from Checkup listeners during an Ask Me Anything segment on Sunday.\n\nThe funny man answered questions about everything from the current election campaign to what's on his post-TV career bucket list.\n\nMercer says while he has 'fantasized' about running for office, he doesn't think he would make a 'good' MP. (Jason Vermes/CBC)\n\nNo, he won't run for office\n\nAs a life-long \"political nerd\" known for skewering politicians, many listeners wondered whether Mercer \u2014 now retired from his decades-long career on CBC-TV \u2014 might ever have \"Right Honourable\" ahead of his name.\n\n\"I always, you know, in the back of my mind fantasized about being in politics because I love politics and it was always my baseball; it was always my sport,\" he said.\n\n\"And I think every baseball fan has the secret fantasy that the phone is going to ring and someone's gonna say, 'Will you come in as general manager and turn this team around?'\"\n\nWhile it's something he's long considered, there's likely no seat at the House of Commons in Mercer's future.\n\nIf your choice is a kick in the head, a punch in the head or a slap in the head, you've still got to think about it and go, 'I'm going with a slap in the head,' - Rick Mercer on the importance of voting\n\n\"The life of an MP is spending an incredible amount of time doing not that interesting things but just assisting your constituents,\" he said.\n\n\"I don't know if I'd be good at that \u2014 also, I don't like the scrutiny thing.\"\n\nOn abstaining from the vote\n\nDuring Sunday afternoon's Checkup, Richard Dugas calling from Papineau, Que., told host McCue that he plans to campaign against voting. He says he believes in politics as a whole, but disagrees with the existing first-past-the-post system.\n\n\"I can't get on board,\" Mercer said.\n\n\"Any time people say, 'Oh, it doesn't matter; they're all the same,\" \u2026 I've never seen an election \u2060\u2014 municipal, federal, provincial \u2060\u2014 where that even comes close.\"\n\nThough he understands that voters may not like their choices, he says that it's important they still exercise their right to cast a ballot.\n\n\"If your choice is a kick in the head, a punch in the head or a slap in the head, you've still got to think about it and go, 'I'm going with a slap in the head,'\" Mercer said.\n\nWritten by Jason Vermes\n\nDownload Cross Country Checkup's Ask Me Anything podcast to hear the full interview with Rick Mercer.", "description": "In a wide-ranging interview touching on the current election campaign to his bucket list, comedian and former CBC-TV star Rick Mercer took calls from Cross Country Checkup listeners.", "authors": ["Cbc Radio"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5284805.1568599130!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/rick-mercer-cross-country-checkup.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
