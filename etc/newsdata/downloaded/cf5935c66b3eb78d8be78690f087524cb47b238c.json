The Selfish author attended the splashy Met Gala event in New York City with sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner as well as mother Kris Jenner, who was with Travis Scott\n\nThe dress looked wild: It was an odd look for the glam queen, but she wanted a shorter dress; seen with Kanye West\n\nThe corset was a big issue for her because it took two people to get her into it. If she needed to get out of it in a hurry to relieve herself, she may have gotten stuck.\n\n'If I have to pee, it's a problem,' said the SKIMS founder to two female friends as well as longtime pal Jonathan Cheban.\n\n'Honestly, if it's an emergency, I think I pee my pants and then have my sister wipe my leg up,' she added.\n\nPee talk! 'Honestly, if it's an emergency, I think I pee my pants and then have my sister wipe my leg up,' she added\n\nInput: She had a friend with her who seemed shocked that Kim was considering peeing in her Met Gala dress\n\nHe said it looked good: Jonathan Cheban was happy that Kim was going with a short dress\n\nKim did not say whether Kendall or Kylie would be the lucky sister saddled with the task.\n\nThe Vogue cover girl then added, 'I'm not even joking. She can wipe my leg up.'\n\nKim also said that the dress was painful to wear because the backs of little drops poked through her dress.\n\nA suggestion: One of her friends asked if she could just wear a diaper\n\nNo can do: After the suggestion, Kim said the corset is just too tight\n\nNot a happy moment: Kim is makeup free and doesn't seem to be in the best mood\n\nShe always stresses out during the Met Gala: The Selfish author has said in the past that it is hard for her to get ready because the expectations are so high\n\n'I have never felt pain like that in my life,' Kardashian said.\n\n'Not only is this silicone [and] 500 hours of beading and making, but every little piece is itchy on the inside. It's pokey. So it pokes me,' she explained.\n\nShe added, 'I'll have to show you pictures of the aftermath when I took it off \u2014 the indentations on my back and my stomach.'\n\nShe also said that she was going to be careful with how she posed for photos.\n\n'Kanye can come in and take some with me but I definitely want solo [shots],' she said. 'The first year he was holding my hand and I was wearing a floral glove and they just cropped me out.'\n\nKeeping Up With the Kardashians airs Sundays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on E!.", "description": "Kim Kardashian was worried about how she was going to go to the bathroom at this year's Met Gala.
