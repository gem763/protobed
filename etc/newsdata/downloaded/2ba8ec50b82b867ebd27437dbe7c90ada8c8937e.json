Mr. Trump posted an average of 83 retweets per week in 2019, up 326% compared to two years earlier, according to the report.\n\nThe White House did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nMr. Trump was a prolific Twitter user prior to running for the presidency, though he previously said after winning that he might stop using the social media platform once in the White House.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do very restrained, if I use it at all, I\u2019m going to be very restrained,\u201d Mr. Trump said in late 2016.\n\nMr. Trump has remained as active as ever on Twitter since becoming president, however, making waves regularly as a result of his unprecedented use of the platform. He has repeatedly leveraged his widely-followed Twitter account to announce official government policy and White House personnel changes, in addition to regularly attacking his political opponents and critics.\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar, Minnesota Democrat, urged Twitter earlier this week to suspend Mr. Trump\u2019s account after he shared a tweet that falsely claimed the congresswoman was partying during the recent anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attack. Mr. Trump had attacked Ms. Omar on Twitter before, and the congresswoman has said that the tweets have resulted in her receiving death threats.\n\n\u201cThey have a responsibility and they set community standards and clearly the president has shown many-a-times that he has violated their community standards,\u201d Ms. Omar said Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t even know why his account is not fully suspended \u2014 why he\u2019s not deplatformed.\u201d\n\nTwitter previously responded to complaints about Mr. Trump\u2019s account by saying the company was wary of suspending accounts associated with any world leaders.\n\n\u201cBlocking a world leader from Twitter or removing their controversial Tweets, would hide important information people should be able to see and debate,\u201d Twitter said in a 2018 blog post. \u201cIt would also not silence that leader, but it would certainly hamper necessary discussion around their words and actions.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s official Twitter account is currently followed by more than 64.4 million users, up from 18 million in December 2016.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
