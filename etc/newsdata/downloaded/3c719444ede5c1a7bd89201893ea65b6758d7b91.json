The fire has scorched nearly 75,000 acres, destroyed more than 120 structures, and forced an unprecedented evacuation of more than 185,000 people in the area.\n\nRelated: California wildfires: how bad are they and is the climate crisis linked?\n\nIn the south of the state, a blaze broke out in the early morning near the Getty art museum in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti, hailed \u201ca lot of amazing heroes\u201d while warning residents to heed evacuation warnings. \u201cIf you have an evacuation notice and you are still in your home, leave. We have seen tragedies before ... get your loved ones and your pets and go,\u201d he said.\n\nNo deaths from either blaze were reported, but a firefighter was seriously injured in the wine country fire in Sonoma county.\n\nFirefighters look at the rotation of helicopters dropping water on the Getty fire spreading in the hills behind the Getty Center.

The Weather Channel reported that the state would see a third round of fire danger on Tuesday and southern California could see its highest winds yet.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 2 million people remained without electricity, after the state\u2019s largest utility company, Pacific Gas & Electric, shut off power over the weekend to prevent its equipment from sparking blazes. PG&E said it was slowly restoring power to customers, but it warned that more deliberate blackouts were possible in the coming days because of the new round of high winds in the forecast.\n\nRoughly 741,000 homes or businesses were still without power on Monday afternoon, according to the company.\n\nRelated: 'This time feels worse': California fire has troubling echoes of 2017 blaze\n\nIn Los Angeles, the Getty fire broke out at 1.34am local time near the museum and the 405 Freeway, in dry brush.\n\nThe Getty Center said its museum grounds remained safe as of Monday morning, with the fire burning to the north and west of the property. The art was also protected by \u201cstate-of-the-art technology\u201d, the center said, adding, \u201cThe safest place for the art and library collections is inside.\u201d\n\nThe Getty fire forced the evacuation of the NBA star LeBron James and the former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, with the Terminator star tweeting that his neighbors should flee when ordered: \u201cIf you are in an evacuation zone, don\u2019t screw around. Get out.\u201d\n\nThe flames also threatened Mount St Mary\u2019s University, a local college, and a spokeswoman said all 450 students were evacuated to the university\u2019s campus near downtown.\n\nThe region is no stranger to destructive fires. In 2017, the Skirball fire destroyed six Bel Air homes, valued at roughly $20m. Last week, the nearby Pacific Palisades fire also damaged several multimillion-dollar homes near the beach.\n\nThere are more than a dozen fires burning across the state, and with no rain in the forecast and more winds, the outlook in the coming days is grim.\n\n\u201cThis is when we have the most potential for large and damaging fires,\u201d said Thom Porter, chief of the California department of forestry and fire protection (Cal Fire). \u201cAll of California is in play right now.\u201d\n\nThe high winds expected in southern California could help spread the Getty fire if firefighters in Los Angeles are not able to contain it by the time the winds pick up. And conditions could complicate efforts to extinguish the still-burning Kincade fire, which as of Monday morning was only 5% contained.\n\nThe National Weather Service predicted that southern California could see the highest winds of the season, with its peak expected on Wednesday and gusts of up to 80mph in the mountains.", "description": "* Firefighters race to bring Sonoma county fire under control  * New blaze broke out in early hours near LA\u2019s Getty Center   * Roughly 741,000 homes or businesses still without powerFirefighters stand watch by a fire line as the Kincade fire burns on the outskirts of Santa Rosa, California, on Monday", "authors": ["Guardian Staff"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/XAWMC07rEG14A9O363FF9w--~B/aD0zMDA7dz01MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-GB/the_guardian_765/ac762ecb584f1ca9544cc4c993a75497", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
