So at our stores they will now be able to get services and technical support from BT staff in their local community.'\n\nHe added: 'You cannot turn these things around overnight. But two years ago we were the most complained-about telecoms operator and now we have a below-average number of complaints.\n\n'Are we the best? No, not yet, and the job is not done. But I would say we are turning the corner.'\n\nBT is the latest telecoms firm to invest in its High Street presence after rival Vodafone announced it was also due to give its 400 shops a makeover.\n\nIn addition to overhauling their appearance and providing more demonstrations of how to use devices, Vodafone said it would open 74 more shops this year and in 2020.\n\nA spokesman for O2 said it was also in the process of improving around 60 of its 450 stores.\n\nAll of BT's shops are within a 20-minute drive of most of the UK's population, a spokesman claimed.\n\nHome technology experts will be available for support, with customers able to book visits to their homes to fix technical issues.\n\nBT also announced it was launching a 'skills for tomorrow' programme that will train 10m people in digital skills, including 3m British schoolchildren.\n\nJansen, who succeeded Gavin Patterson earlier this year, said: 'We're helping families and communities across the UK, and companies in Britain and around the world, to remove the barriers of today to realise the potential of tomorrow.'", "description": "The telecoms giant is revamping its 615 EE phone shops, which previously only carried EE's logo, so that BT customers can receive technical support or deal with billing issues.", "authors": ["Matt Oliver For The Daily Mail", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
