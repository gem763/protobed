He sent another header wide a matter of moments later, as the home side - still trying to win friends and influence elements of a deeply sceptical, if not downright hostile, Gorgie crowd - showed their intent.\n\nRyotaro Meshino opened the scoring for Hearts after five minutes with a clever lob\n\nMeshino was delighted after scoring his first for the club with his family watching in the crowd\n\nThat Levein's men took the lead with just six minutes gone, then, was hardly a surprise.\n\nRangers captain James Tavernier seemed to hesitate as Ikpeazu flicked he ball on for Jake Mulraney, who saw his sot blocked well by McGregor.\n\nAs the rebound floated to the edge of the box, though, Meshino executed a perfectly controlled volley that arced gracefully into the empty net.\n\nRangers took some time to just recover from that early loss, with Sheyi Ojo looking their only serious attacking threat during a spell that would have left Gerrard deeply concerned.\n\nBut Morelos equalised six minutes before the break as the title-chasers began to grow into the game.\n\nAlfredo Morelos equalised from a corner after Nikola Katic's header found him in the box\n\nMorelos celebrates scoring after he started the game ahead of Jermaine Defoe\n\nBorna Barisic's delivery from the left was flicked on by Nikola Katie and, as he so often is, Morelos found himself perfectly placed to control the ball and beat the keeper at his far post.\n\nThe fiery forward celebrated his 15th of the season with a knee slide and blown kisses right in front of the Hearts support.\n\nHearts were subdued by the equaliser. And the doldrums that seemed to affect the home side continued after the break, proving once again that sometimes there is no half-time speech capable of rousing a flat side.\n\nDavis came close to putting Rangers ahead just before the hour mark, volleying a dropping ball towards goal from all of 20 yards, a deflection taking it behind for a corner. The first in a series that had Hearts scrambling to clear their lines.\n\nReferee Kevin Clancy was just about keeping a lid on tensions. Sometimes by simply waving play on when confronted with two players fouling each other with a distinct lack of subtlety.\n\nAs a football contest, it was crying out for a touch of quality. Something lest brutalist than merely shelling the ball on top of the opposition defence and hoping to catch a break.\n\nCraig Levein will be encouraged by what he saw from his struggling Hearts side\n\nGerrard and the entire Rangers bench were off their feet claiming for a penalty when Scott Arfield went down under a challenge from 17-year-old Manchester City target Hickey with 15 invites remaining.\n\nWhatever the merits of the appeal, the fact is that Arfield, Morelos and sub Ryan Kent should have made more of the three-man breakaway that had the home defence back-pedalling.\n\nConnor Goldson saw a header spilled and smashed clear with a thumping Header as the game entered the last knockings.\n\nIkpeazu also caused chaos in the Rangers ranks on a counter-attack sparked by sub Andy Irving, the striker sort of ambling past Goldson before driving a cross against the legs of a defender.\n\nIt was hectic, frenetic, frantic. Entertaining. But guaranteed to leave Gerrard feeling deeply frustrated.", "description": "Rangers missed out on the chance to return to the top of the Scottish Championship as they were held 1-1 in a a spirited Hearts performance at Tynecastle.", "authors": ["John Greechan For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/20/14/19955986-0-image-a-25_1571576818036.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
