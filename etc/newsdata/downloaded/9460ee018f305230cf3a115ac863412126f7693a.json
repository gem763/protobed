We're going to speak to her and we're going to see the person driving the car, the wife of the diplomat, we're going to speak to her and see what we can come up with so that there can be some healing.\"\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said after meeting with British foreign secretary Dominic Raab that no progress had been made over the last week.\n\n\"Part of me is feeling like it was just a publicity stunt on the UK government side to show they are trying to help,\" she said.\n\nRaab said he shared the frustration of Dunn's parents.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Andy Bruce in London and Steve Holland in Washington,; Editing by Sandra Maler, Rosalba O'Brien and Sonya Hepinstall)", "description": "British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday urged President Donald Trump to reconsider a decision to let a U.S. diplomat's wife use diplomatic immunity after she was involved in a fatal car crash in England and then left the country.
