What we have to do is respond and look to the next game to erase it,\u201d Bruce told a news conference on Friday.\n\n\u201cEnough has been said... we were disappointed. We had our backsides kicked. When that happens you have to show a certain degree of pride and make sure you put it right.\u201d\n\nBruce has not enjoyed support from some sections of fans since he took over from the popular Rafa Benitez in July and recent results have not helped him win them over.\n\n\u201cMud has been thrown my way since I walked through the door, that\u2019s not going to change. The only thing that can change it for me is results,\u201d Bruce added.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a resilient so and so. You wouldn\u2019t be human if it didn\u2019t affect you in some sort of way but you try and get on with your job as best you can.\n\n\u201cThese days you don\u2019t get the time you would like to get, you have to get results instantly... I\u2019m determined... to turn it around and take the club forward.\u201d\n\nBruce said he was eager to take on his old club who are also struggling to fire under former team mate Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, having collected nine points from seven games to sit 10th.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful time to play them because it will be a full house, live on the TV. If ever we needed to bounce back against anybody, what better way than against them,\u201d he said.", "description": "Newcastle United boss Steve Bruce has sought a response from his players in Sunday's Premier League clash with Manchester United after getting their \"backsides kicked\" by Leicester City.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191004&t=2&i=1436972054&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF930P1", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
