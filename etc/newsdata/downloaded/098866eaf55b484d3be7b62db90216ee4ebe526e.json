Martha Roby (R-AL) earlier this year that she would not be seeking another term as Alabama\u2019s second congressional district representative opened up what some see shaping up to be one of the more interesting GOP congressional primaries in the country this election cycle.\n\nAs of last week, former Alabama Attorney General Troy King, Alabama State Rep. Will Dismukes (R), former Alabama State Rep. Barry Moore (R) and Dothan, AL businessman Jeff Coleman have announced their intentions to seek the nod. On Monday, Prattville, AL businesswoman Jessica Taylor added her name to the mix with a video that featured athletic and professional highlights of her career, and took aim at Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and the so-called \u201cSquad.\u201d\n\nThe spot earned her an invitation on FNC\u2019s \u201cFox & Friends\u201d on Tuesday.\n\nTaylor is a mother of three and wife to active duty national guardsman, Iraq war veteran, former Alabama state senator, and former general counsel to Gov. Kay Ivey (R-AL) Bryan Taylor.\n\nAs an Alabama conservative, I\u2019m sick of arrogant socialists like @AOC who\u2019ve never even run a lemonade stand trying to tell us how to live in Alabama.
