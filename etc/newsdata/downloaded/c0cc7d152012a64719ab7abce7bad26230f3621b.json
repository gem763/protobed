In total, the company has partnered with 175 brands. On Saturday, Target is celebrating its 20th anniversary of these retail team-ups.\n\nRead more: Target is opening Disney shops in dozens of stores \u2014 here's where to find them\n\nA total of 20 of those brand partnerships will relaunch in stores and online, and continue until supplies run out. Around 300 products from those collaborations will be up for sale across different categories, including apparel and decor. Prices will range from $7 to $160.\n\nShoppers and Target employees alike have taken to Twitter to share their experiences at the stores and online, so far.\n\nTarget's limited-edition collaborations, including its recent Vineyard Vines and Hunter team-ups, have been known to garner crowds and sell out fast. That has resulted in some mixed reactions from shoppers: joy for fans who happen to snag their desired products, and frustration on the part of those who miss out.\n\nIn this go-around, Target implemented a few measures to avoid the crush that typically accompanies these limited releases. Customers within the stores will be limited to five items \"per size and color,\" according to the company. So far, there doesn't appear to be much evidence of a shopper revolt or chaotic stores on Twitter.\n\nPrior to the relaunch, Target also recommended that shoppers read through its not-yet-released \"look book\" online so they're able to come prepared.\n\nHere's the full list of featured designers:\n\nMichael Graves\n\nPhilippe Starck\n\nStephen Sprouse\n\nIsaac Mizrahi\n\nErin Fetherston\n\nProenza Schouler\n\nThakoon\n\nJohn Derian\n\nAnna Sui\n\nRodarte\n\nStephen Burrows\n\nZac Posen\n\nHarajuku Mini\n\nMissoni\n\nJason Wu\n\nPhillip Lim\n\nAltuzarra\n\nLilly Pulitzer\n\nMarimekko\n\nHunter\n\nGot tips?
