But that data set has problems. The instrument detected the height not only of the coastal land surface but anything else that was on it, such as houses and trees. This introduced errors in land-elevation estimates averaging about 6\u00bd feet globally, the new study says.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cFor all of the resources we have rightly invested in improving our sea level projections, we didn\u2019t know the height of the ground beneath our feet,\u201d Strauss said.\n\nAD\n\nSome wealthy countries, such as the United States, have used laser-based coastal measurements to gain more accuracy, but most have not been able to do so.\n\nThe new study uses the more accurate U.S. measurements as a guide, training an algorithm to apply similar adjustments to the global data set from the space shuttle. This is where the much higher numbers for exposed populations come from, with the biggest changes in exposure coming for countries in Asia.\n\n\u201cIn terms of global estimates, I think the analysis convincingly shows that the situation is probably even worse than previous studies suggested,\u201d said St\u00e9phane Hallegatte, an economist at the World Bank who studies climate change and disaster exposure. \u201cWe are talking about hundreds of millions of people who will be directly exposed.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe changes are certainly very large. The study estimates that 110 million people live below the current high-tide level vs. an estimated 28 million for the older data set. About 250 million people would fall below the level of the worst yearly flood, the study says, up from the previous estimate of 65 million.\n\nAD\n\nProjections illustrate how exposed people will be as seas continue to rise.\n\nThe study considers a scenario that would lead to 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, of global warming by 2100, the temperature rise that world leaders have set as an absolute limit. The study projects that 150 million would live below the high tide line by 2050 and 200 million by 2100. Those exposed to an annual flood in that year would be 360 million.\n\nAD\n\nThe world is on course to warm considerably more than 2 degrees Celsius, however, so there are more dire scenarios.\n\nIf key instabilities kick in in Antarctica, 480 million people would be exposed to an annual flood in 2100.\n\nThe findings are worst for Asia, notably in China, Bangladesh and India. In the worst-case scenario, 87 million, 50 million and 38 million people in these countries, respectively, would fall below the high-tide level in 2100.\n\nAD\n\nThe situation is, if anything, more ominous than these figures suggest, according to the World Bank\u2019s Hallegatte. That\u2019s because in addition to high-tide and annual worst-case flood events, there are major floods from hurricanes and other storms and disasters to consider, even if they do not occur every year. The impact of these severe events will be worsened and affect larger populations as seas continue to rise.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMost dikes and protection systems have been built for the sea level of 50 years ago or more, and will be increasingly ill-designed to protect people against floods, leading to rapidly increasing coastal flood losses in the absence of large upgrades,\u201d Hallegatte said. \u201cUpgrading those systems will be expensive but is unavoidable if one wants to avoid unacceptable economic losses in large cities.\u201d\n\nSeveral other researchers said the new estimates are a step forward, although some criticized the work.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis study is an important step toward a more accurate estimation of population at risk from global sea level rise,\u201d said Pinki Mondal, a University of Delaware researcher who uses satellite and other remote-sensing tools to study climate change risks and effects. \u201cWith advancements in technology, computing resources and machine learning, it is becoming increasingly possible to have highly accurate estimates of say, elevation, as shown in this study.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nAthanasios Vafeidis, a sea level expert at the University of Kiel in Germany, agreed that the research presents \u201cnew, improved information on coastal elevation.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever,\u201d he said, \u201cimportant factors such as socioeconomic development and adaptation are not considered in these estimates. Physical processes are represented in a rather simplistic manner.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nVafeidis noted that it is not clear that the algorithm, trained on the U.S. coastline, performs equally well in other countries. He also said that the way populations grow and adapt to rising seas is more complex than the study was able to account for and that the effects of floods, too, depend on much more nuanced factors than the sheer elevation of the land.\n\nAD\n\nClimate Central\u2019s Strauss acknowledges that the study does not give any \u201cexplicit consideration\u201d to current adaptation measures, such as sea walls, in assessing present-day exposure; it is merely measuring the elevation of the land itself and the number of people living on it.\n\nThat may be good news, Strauss argues, an indication that humans are already capable of adapting to threats from the sea.\n\n\u201cWe infer that there must be coastal defenses protecting those 100 million-plus people below today\u2019s high tide line,\u201d Strauss said. \u201cBecause only a handful of them can be living in houseboats or homes on stilts.\u201d\n\nStill, whatever their current defenses, people already living below high-tide lines are likely to be increasingly tested in coming years.\n\n\u201cThis new study suggests that a lot of the assessments published on climate change risks are underestimated and would need to be revised,\u201d Hallegatte said.\n\nAD", "description": "150 million will live below the permanent high tide line by the year 2050, new research finds.", "authors": ["Chris Mooney", "Reporter Covering Climate Change", "Energy", "The Environment."], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/V8lteN00fIAIeMCOmLqs1Kbgel8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/3KUYDSG7FII6TPUWNLNYDAQ6SA.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
