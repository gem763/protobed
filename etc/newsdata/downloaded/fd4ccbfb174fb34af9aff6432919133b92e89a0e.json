At the same time, they argued for their own race\u2019s civilizational genius, for a negritude that turned a derogatory label into a celebration of African cultural distinctiveness.\n\nAnd finally they believed that part of the West\u2019s tradition, the universalist ideals they associated with French republicanism and Marxism, could be used to create a political canopy \u2014 a transnational union \u2014 beneath which humanity could be (to quote C\u00e9saire) \u201cmore than ever united and diverse, multiple and harmonious.\u201d\n\nThis vision was rejected by both the colonized and the colonizers. But in certain ways it was revived by global elites after the Cold War\u2019s end, with neoliberalism substituted for Marxism, and a different set of transnational projects \u2014 the European Union, the Pax Americana \u2014 taking the place of the pan-ethnic, multicultural French Union envisioned by C\u00e9saire and Senghor.\n\nOf late, though, this project has run into some of the same difficulties that made theirs an impossibility. The cultural reality that C\u00e9saire and Senghor grasped \u2014 that civilizational difference is real and powerful and lasting \u2014 has a way of undoing the political unity for which they fondly hoped.\n\nOn the evidence of recent European controversies, it is hard enough to for a political union to reconcile the different branches of the West \u2014 German and Mediterranean, French and Anglo-Saxon. It becomes harder when that same union is trying to manage a society so multicultural \u2014 as European nations under the pressure of mass migration may become \u2014 as to lack religious or linguistic or historical common ground. And it becomes harder still when your ruling elite\u2019s cosmopolitanism is essentially superficial, more \u201ceating ethnic food and cheering for Obama\u201d than \u201ccelebrating negritude while reading Goethe.\u201d", "description": "What Donald Trump claims to be defending is still real but may not last.", "authors": ["Ross Douthat"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/09/sunday-review/09Douthat/09Douthat-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2017-07-08"}
