That\u2019s a peculiar size for a gaming laptop, or any kind of laptop for that matter (though it may not be an anomaly for long.) Origin has, in effect, stuffed a bigger screen into its lightly tweaked 15-inch EVO 15-S chassis, which debuted last year.\n\nDespite the increase in screen size, using the EVO 16-S felt no different than using any other standard-sized gaming laptop during the few weeks that I spent with it. In fact, this laptop is virtually identical to last year\u2019s EVO 15-S, aside from one USB 3.0 port and two Mini DisplayPorts that were dropped from the current model.\n\nOur review of Origin PC EVO 16-S Verge Score 6.5 out of 10 Good Stuff Thin, lightweight design\n\nCapable specs\n\nResponsive trackpad Bad Stuff Rehashed design\n\nLacks G-Sync and Thunderbolt 3\n\nDreadful gaming performance when running on the battery Buy for $1,827.00 from Origin\n\nThe configuration that Origin put together for The Verge costs $2,751, and this includes a custom paint job that costs $149. (Of course, I had to take Origin up on its offer to paint a Verge wallpaper onto the laptop\u2019s lid.) It\u2019s a thin, light laptop with the latest components, like a 9th Gen Intel Core i7 and Nvidia\u2019s Max-Q variant of the RTX 2080 (underclocked compared to the standard version, but still powerful).\n\nUpdate, 1:57PM ET, August 21st: Updated the correctly reflect the price of this configuration. I apologize for the error.\n\nThe EVO 16-S\u2019s creaky hinges and flimsy, plastic lid make for an iffy first impression. If you\u2019re expecting bold, industrial design with equal attention paid to every physical component, you won\u2019t get your fix here.\n\nAnd while I appreciate the trimmed-down bezels surrounding the 16-inch display, the screen itself is no great shakes. The 1080p IPS display features a 144Hz refresh rate, which is great to have if you value a smooth scroll online and want games to run more fluidly. However, there\u2019s still no Nvidia G-Sync support, which would have eliminated some of the screen tearing that I noticed during my time spent gaming with this laptop. It\u2019s a repeat omission that doesn\u2019t make sense for a laptop at this price, aimed at a crowd who cares about features like these.\n\nMore laptops are getting Thunderbolt 3 ports, which allow for super fast data transfers. That\u2019s still missing here, despite having a pair of USB-C ports. Few people may have an actual use for Thunderbolt 3 ports, but that\u2019s beside my point: Razer\u2019s entry-level Blade Stealth, a laptop that you can find for $1,199, supports Thunderbolt 3, and it allows for some cool tricks other than fast data speeds. It can get a huge boost to its graphics capabilities with the Razer Core X Chroma external GPU enclosure that connects over Thunderbolt 3.\n\nThere is an improvement from last year\u2019s EVO 15-S: these USB-C ports can fast charge devices that support it. My Pixel 3 charged quickly, and my Nintendo Switch was able to stow away some juice while I played Fire Emblem: Three Houses.\n\nI\u2019ve saved my biggest qualm for last: this laptop loses most of its gaming capabilities when you\u2019re playing on the battery\u2019s power. If you\u2019re someone who likes to play games in transit, get ready to be surprised by sub-20 fps gameplay. Most games that I want to play, including Outer Wilds or Metro: Exodus, a knee-buckler of a game with demanding ray tracing effects, are simply unplayable when the EVO 16-S isn\u2019t plugged in. What\u2019s worse is that tweaking graphical settings doesn\u2019t make things much better.\n\nThis is a feature, not a bug, according to Origin PC. The company told me that this behavior is intentional, and designed to prevent overheating and to keep the battery from draining too quickly. Those are definitely valid issues. Most gaming laptops get properly toasty and last under an hour while gaming away from the plug, but at least those let you game with all of the power that they\u2019re capable of, unlike this one.\n\nIn fact, Origin\u2019s mission to keep the machine cool and alive for longer on the battery is mostly a success, gaming performance be darned. It lasts around two hours with my usual workload running (around 10 Chrome tabs, Spotify, Affinity Photo, and Slack), and the fans stay relatively quiet, though it inexplicably ramped up the fans a few times.\n\nBy adjusting the laptop to a less demanding power setting, Origin claims up to seven hours of battery life. Testing those claims was made difficult because when I switched into \u201cQuiet\u201d mode, the most efficient setting available, the mouse pointer hitched, and the display could no longer quickly refresh. So if you\u2019re buying with battery life in mind, you shouldn\u2019t be looking at this machine. Instead, direct your attention toward our guide on the best laptops, which features more well-rounded machines.\n\n9th Gen Intel Core i7-9750H 6 Core\n\nNvidia GeForce RTX 2080 (8GB GDDR6 VRAM, Max-Q)\n\n16.1-inch Full HD 144Hz IPS display\n\n512GB SSD (NVMe), 2TB 5,400RPM HDD\n\n16GB RAM\n\n0.78 x 9.9 x 14.9 inches / 19.8 x 251 x 378mm\n\n4.6 lbs / 2.08 kg\n\nLast year\u2019s EVO 15-S was close to being great, only stunted by a few small, but important omissions that no gaming laptop over $1,500 should ship without. And now, a year later, Origin didn\u2019t put enough work in to make this one measurably better. It is one of the first machines to have a 16-inch screen, and it has the spec upgrades that you\u2019d expect, but it lacks far too much for that feat to be worth celebrating.\n\nFor this kind of money, and against competition like the feature-packed Razer Blade 15 Advanced or the delightfully innovative Acer Predator Triton 900 with its versatile floating display, the Origin\u2019s slightly bigger screen isn\u2019t nearly enough to win me over, or make all of this machine\u2019s flaws go away. What\u2019s worse is that most of these issues are repeat offenders from Origin\u2019s EVO 15-S.\n\nIn the time since I received a review unit, Origin PC was acquired by Corsair. Now I can\u2019t stop thinking about the kind of impact this might have on how Origin sources its laptop designs. Currently, Origin sources its laptop designs from an original design manufacturer (ODM), but I\u2019d love to see what could happen if chassis design was done internally. Corsair\u2019s ownership of Origin PC may not have any impact on product design, but if the EVO 16-S is any example, it would be better for everyone if that happened.", "description": "Origin\u2019s EVO 16-S is one of the first laptops to feature a 16-inch display, but its raw performance is what makes it worth considering. Otherwise, this is mostly a rehash of last year\u2019s EVO 15-S design, but with fewer ports, and with too few things improved to make it worth recommending.", "authors": ["Cameron Faulkner", "Aug"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tOWzVnek6p5x4iuz7HdUBFMmPHg=/0x292:2040x1360/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18842483/akrales_190801_3574_0006.jpg", "published_at": "2019-08-21"}
