It is so different than it used to be. Oh well, I\u2019m President!\u201d\n\nTrump reportedly speaks privately with Hannity on a regular basis and occasionally calls in live to his Fox News show. Journalists who follow Trump\u2019s Twitter feed point out that he frequently mentions topics that were discussed on \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d often within minutes.\n\nPhoto illustration: Yahoo News; photo: AP More\n\nBut it\u2019s not the first time Trump has taken issue with Fox News over unfriendly poll results. In August, after Fox News polling data showed him trailing four potential Democratic opponents in the 2020 presidential race, the president struck a conspiratorial tone.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something going on at Fox,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cAnd I tell you I\u2019m not happy with it.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s latest critique came a day after a Fox News survey found 51 percent of registered voters support his impeachment and removal from office, a record high for the network\u2019s survey, compared with 40 percent who do not. The last time Fox News polled voters on impeachment \u2014 in July \u2014 42 percent of respondents favored impeachment and removal, compared with 45 percent who did not.\n\nThe results are similar to those of other recent national polls that show growing support for Trump\u2019s impeachment.\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "President Trump took to Twitter on Thursday to vent his frustration over a new Fox News poll that found a majority of Americans want to see him impeached and removed from office.", "authors": ["Dylan Stableford", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6JFN0E0OXXopRp1Y_5e_hw--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/234d0c60-eb6f-11e9-9deb-de0da81d023e", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
