He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to reporters.\n\nThe girl, who was traveling with her mother, was identified at a border screening Wednesday as a possible Ebola patient and isolated.\n\n5-year-old boy dies from Ebola as virus spreads to Uganda\n\nAlthough cases of cross-border contamination have been rare, this case highlights the risk of Ebola spreading across the border into neighboring Uganda and Rwanda. Borders in the region are often porous, and many people traveling at night use bush paths to cross over.\n\nBecause the 9-year-old Ebola victim passed through an official entry point, Ugandan health authorities believe she had no contact with any Ugandan.\n\nEbola has killed nearly 2,000 people in eastern Congo since August 2018. The disease is spread through contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person.\n\nWHO said Friday that cases have reached 3,000 in Congo, with 1,893 confirmed deaths and some 900 survivors. An average of 80 people per week are sickened by the virus, which has infected most people in Congo's North Kivu province.\n\nThe Ebola outbreak in eastern Congo hasn't shown signs of slowing down despite new treatments and vaccines given to more than 200,000 people in the region and the use of two therapeutic treatments being used as part of a clinical trial.\n\nBehind the scenes: Covering Ebola in a war zone\n\nAs CBS News correspondent Debora Patta repor\n\nted from the epicenter of the outbreak, the fight against it has been hugely complicated by a raging conflict in the region between rebel groups and the government, and resistance from wary residents who don't trust the vaccine or public health workers.\n\nSome in these communities have even staged attacks against health workers.\n\nIn June, a family of Congolese with some sick family members crossed into Uganda via a bush path.\n\nTwo of them later died of Ebola, and the others were transferred back to Congo.\n\nUganda has had multiple outbreaks of Ebola and hemorrhagic fevers since 2000.\n\nWHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus will travel this weekend to Congo with United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and senior officials, including Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa.\n\nOn Friday he called on partners to increase their presence in the field.\n\n\"Our commitment to the people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is that we will work alongside them to stop the Ebola outbreak,\" said WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \"Our commitment also means strengthening the health systems to give them all the other things they need. Building strong systems is what will protect people, communities and the world.\"", "description": "Death of Congolese girl flagged as likely Ebola case at border checkpoint highlights risk of outbreak's spread as deaths near 3,000", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews3.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/08/30/fa0000f0-79a8-4e0b-9e36-18735cce5a83/thumbnail/1200x630/17da0b5bc04db5418fcf7c5f476564b8/ebola-uganda-ap-19166669274654.jpg"}
