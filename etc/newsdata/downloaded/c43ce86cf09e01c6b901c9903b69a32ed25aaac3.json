They were racing against time, he said, because the seas were becoming rougher.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Vitisak Payalaw Vitisak Payalaw\n\nIn the first photos Payalaw posted, the dog looks exhausted \u2014 \"especially on his eyes\" \u2014 and despondent. Workers provided him with water and pieces of meat on the deck of the rig, and they set up a kennel for him indoors.\n\nThey named him Boonrod, Payalaw added, a word that means \"he has done good karma and that helps him to survive.\"\n\nIt's not clear how the dog ended up so many miles offshore. Payalaw declined to speculate, simply saying it is still a mystery. The Bangkok Post said the pup is \"believed to have fallen from a fishing trawler.\"\n\nBoonrod appeared to be steadily growing stronger, after eating and napping. After a day and a half, he looked happy and alert \u2014 and he was clearly popular with the oil rig team.\n\ntoggle caption Vitisak Payalaw\n\nThe pup has now been transferred to land, arriving in Thailand's Songkhla province on Monday morning to receive veterinary care coordinated by the rescue group Watchdog Thailand. According to The Associated Press, the group has declared him \"in good shape.\"\n\nPhotos posted by the organization showed a triumphant-looking Boonrod being greeted by rescue group workers and veterinarians. They placed a fetching bright yellow floral wreath around his neck as Boonrod flashed a bright smile.\n\nThe dog was later shown receiving a bath, playing with admirers and eating treats.\n\nBoonrod's streak of good luck seems set to continue. Payalaw says he's going to be working on the rig until the end of April, but when he gets back to shore, he plans to adopt the dog.", "description": "It's not clear how the animal ended up stranded in the middle of the Gulf of Thailand.
