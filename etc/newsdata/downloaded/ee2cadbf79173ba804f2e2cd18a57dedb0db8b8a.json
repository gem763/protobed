(Elijah Nouvelage/For The Washington Post)\n\nClimate change is already having staggering effects on oceans and ice-filled regions that encompass 80 percent of the Earth, and future damage from rising seas and melting glaciers is now all but certain, according to a sobering new report from the United Nations.\n\nThe warming climate is already killing coral reefs, supercharging monster storms, and fueling deadly marine heat waves and record losses of sea ice. And Wednesday\u2019s report on the world\u2019s oceans, glaciers, polar regions and ice sheets finds that such effects foreshadow a more catastrophic future as long as greenhouse gas emissions remain unchecked.\n\nGiven current emissions levels, a number of serious effects are essentially unavoidable, says the report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\n\nExtreme floods that have historically struck some coastal cities and small island nations once every 100 years will become an annual occurrence by 2050, according to the IPCC. In addition, if emissions continue to increase, global sea levels could rise by more than three feet by the end of this century \u2014 about 12 percent higher than the group estimated as recently as 2013. Melting glaciers could harm water supplies, and warming oceans could wreck marine fisheries.\n\n\u201cAs a result of excess greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the ocean today is higher, warmer, more acidic, less productive and holds less oxygen,\u201d said Jane Lubchenco, a former administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). \u201cThe conclusion is inescapable: The impacts of climate change on the ocean are well underway. Unless we take very serious action very soon, these impacts will get worse \u2014 much, much worse.\u201d\n\n\n\nA woman carries her daughter through flooding caused by rising sea levels on June 6, 2017, in Pekalongan, Indonesia.

(Matt McClain)\n\nMore than 100 scientists from around the world contributed to the latest report by the IPCC, which found that profound and potentially devastating consequences lie ahead for marine life, Arctic ecosystems and entire human societies if climate change continues unabated.\n\nWednesday\u2019s report comes on the heels of other IPCC warnings about the grave threats climate change poses. Recently, the group detailed how the world\u2019s land and water resources are facing \u201cunprecedented\u201d levels of exploitation and how those changes endanger the global food supply. Last fall, the IPCC also warned that the world must make rapid, far-reaching changes to energy, transportation and other systems to hold warming below an increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, a key threshold in the Paris climate agreement.\n\nThe findings also come as world leaders gathered this week at the United Nations for a much-anticipated \u201cclimate summit\u201d aimed at injecting new momentum into the flagging effort to persuade countries to do more to move away from fossil fuels and toward cleaner forms of energy. Although dozens of smaller nations did announce plans for coming years, the world\u2019s largest emitters have stopped short of committing to transformational changes.\n\n\u201cThe climate emergency is a race we are losing \u2014 but it is a race we can win if we change our ways now,\u201d U.N. Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres told world leaders Tuesday in his latest attempt to spur action. \u201cEven our language has to adapt: What once was called \u2018climate change\u2019 is now truly a \u2018climate crisis.\u2019 \u2026 We are seeing unprecedented temperatures, unrelenting storms and undeniable science.\u201d\n\n\n\nA break in the ice forms in the Arctic Ocean beyond Utqiavik, Alaska, on April 12. (Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post)\n\n\n\nThe sun sets on the beach in Barra Del Chuy, Uruguay, on April 5. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nThe Washington Post recently detailed how shifting currents and worsening ocean heat have triggered die-offs of coastal clam species, worsening algal blooms and shifting fish catches in the South Atlantic along the coasts of Uruguay and Argentina, a hot spot for climate change. Wednesday\u2019s report suggests that similar changes are playing out across the world\u2019s oceans \u2014 in some areas more than others.\n\nOne of the document\u2019s most striking findings involves the rise in sea level, which is being driven mainly by the rapid melting of ice in Greenland, Antarctica and the world\u2019s smaller glaciers. Sea level rise is accelerating, and the world could see 3.6 feet in total sea level rise by 2100 in a very high-emissions scenario. In 2013, the IPCC had estimated that value at slightly more than three feet.\n\nBut the truth is that even these estimates may be too small, because when scientists behind the report looked at an alternative method for gauging how much seas could rise \u2014 simply canvassing the views of experts \u2014 even larger estimates emerged. The group\u2019s findings only highlight \u201clikely\u201d amounts of sea level rise, meaning they do not represent worst-case scenarios.\n\nFor some major coastal cities, a historical 100-year flood event will happen annually by the year 2050 even in a low emissions scenario, the report finds. That includes large cities such as Jakarta, Manila, Bangkok, Lima, Singapore, Barcelona and Sydney, according to the IPCC. In the United States, cities facing this fast-moving sea-level danger include Los Angeles, Miami, Savannah, Honolulu, San Juan, Key West and San Diego.\n\nParis Mayor Anne Hildalgo, who chairs C40 Cities, a global group of climate-conscious city leaders, called Wednesday\u2019s report \u201cshocking reading.\u201d\n\n\n\nMotorists drive through a flooded street after heavy rain in Bangkok on June 7, 2019.

(David McNew/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cThe world\u2019s coasts provide a home to around 1.9 billion people and over half of the world\u2019s megacities \u2014 all of which are in grave danger if we don\u2019t act immediately to prevent rising temperatures and sea levels,\u201d Hildalgo said in a statement. \u201cExtreme high temperatures, coastal flooding, and more frequent natural disasters are becoming the new normal ... This is what the climate crisis looks like now.\u201d\n\nLike coastal cities, various small island nations also face imminent dangers from rising seas and as a result have been among the most vocal in pushing for more-aggressive climate action.\n\nBecause sea level-rise greatly amplifies storm surge events, \u201cflood levels are all of a sudden returning in many cases once a year by mid-century, and it just gets worse from there,\u201d said Michael Oppenheimer, a Princeton climate scientist who led the report\u2019s chapter on sea-level rise. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about storms that, when they come, result in loss of life, loss of property, shut down cities.\"\n\nGranted, the severity of a 100-year flood event varies greatly and will not always be disastrous in any one place, Oppenheimer said. Still, the finding underscores just how big a difference a steady rise in sea level can make \u2014 and how soon we are going to start to realize this.\n\nWednesday\u2019s report also finds that while it may be possible to adapt to rising seas if global emissions are somehow kept low throughout the century, the system could still tip toward very large ice losses from Greenland and Antarctica. If that happens, the rate of sea-level rise could become truly catastrophic, especially by the years 2200 and 2300, when it could exceed 10 feet.\n\nIce loss is accelerating in Greenland and Antarctica, scientists found. Permafrost, which contains enormous amounts of carbon that can be released as it thaws, has warmed to \u201crecord high levels.\u201d Summer Arctic sea ice extent is now probably lower than at any time in \u201cat least 1,000 years,\u201d and the oldest, thickest ice has already declined by 90 percent.\n\nAnd then there is the entire world ocean. \u201cOver the 21st century, the ocean is projected to transition to unprecedented conditions,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe ocean is losing oxygen, growing more acidic, taking up an increasing amount of heat, and becoming more stratified, with warm water at the surface preventing cooler, nutrient rich waters from rising. All of these changes have profound consequences for marine ecosystems.\n\n\n\nIn this Nov. 25, 2016, photo, fish swim along the edges of a coral reef off Great Keppel Island in Australia. The agency that manages the Great Barrier Reef in August downgraded its outlook for the corals' condition from \"poor\" to \"very poor\" because of warming oceans. (DAN PELED/AP)\n\nOne of the most shocking findings involves \u201cmarine heat waves,\u201d which have been blamed for mass deaths of corals, kelp forests and other key ocean organisms. The large majority of these events are already directly attributable to climate change, and by the year 2100, they will become 20 times more common in the best case, and 50 times as common in the absolute worst case, compared with the late 1800s, the report found.\n\nMany of these changes to oceans and ice are unfolding in parts of the Earth where few people live, and so the shifts are not always readily visible to most humans. But the changes taking place there ultimately will affect people around the globe, in the form of rising seas and other impacts. And as those impacts worsen, so does the difficulty of adapting to them.\n\n\u201cPeople at the poles are experiencing climate change frequently, much more than the rest of us,\u201d said Ted Schuur, one of the drafting authors of the report and a permafrost expert at Northern Arizona University. \u201cBut I think that\u2019s in our future. Everybody living outside of these polar regions is going to start having these same effects.\u201d\n\n\n\nDejani Louistan, who was displaced by Hurricane Dorian, stands with the only belongings she managed to salvage amid the destruction left in the Mudd neighborhood of Marsh Harbour, Bahamas, on Sept. 7, 2019. (Carolyn Van Houten/The Washington Post)\n\nLynn Scarlett, the vice president for policy and government relations at the Nature Conservancy and a top-ranking Interior Department official during the George W. Bush administration, said the grim findings in Wednesday\u2019s report should be a call to action.\n\n\"We must not let these climate change impacts paralyze us,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cWe must address root causes of climate change by slowing and eventually stopping accumulation of greenhouse gas emissions.\u201d\n\nThere is much that humans can do to blunt the expected impacts in the meantime, she said, such as restoring mangroves and protecting reefs and marshes to reduce storm impacts on coastal communities.\n\n\u201cAlone, these measures cannot meet all the challenges of climate change to oceans and coasts, but they are doable, cost-effective and make a difference,\u201d Scarlett said.", "description": "A definitive new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change finds dangerous sea level rise and mass death of corals and other key ocean life has already been unleashed.", "authors": ["Chris Mooney", "Reporter Covering Climate Change", "Energy", "The Environment.", "Brady Dennis", "Reporter Focusing On Environmental Policy", "Public Health Issues", "September At Am", "Chris Mooney Covers Climate Change", "The Environment.
