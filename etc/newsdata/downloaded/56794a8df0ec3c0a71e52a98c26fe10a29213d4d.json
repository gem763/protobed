Her son was going to be something special.\n\n\"Little did she know,\" Warren jokes, gesturing to his arms and legs. \"Here I am, plenty special. But alas, I don't have my E.\"\n\nBeing born without oxygen did a lot of things for Warren. For starters, it meant the first 13 minutes of his life were more like death \u2014 flatlined, a newborn baby with no vitals.\n\nIt also gave him cerebral palsy. He can walk short distances without a walker or wheelchair, but his arms and legs sometimes move with a mind of their own. His speech is slow and monotone.\n\nNot everyone expects the disabled person to have a funny story about drinking downtown - Camron Warren\n\nMost of all, the unfortunate circumstances of his birth left him with a wicked sense of humour.\n\nAgainst all odds, Warren is bringing his jokes to stages around the city this summer as he takes a leap into standup comedy and making people question their assumptions about disability.\n\nWarren performs on stage at LPSU Hall in St. John's during the Braxton Comedy Festival. The show was organized by Unpossible, which launched a comedy challenge this summer and encouraged newcomers. (Ryan Cooke/CBC)\n\n\"I'm 20 years old and I've done quite a bit. I've just been in a lot of stupid scenarios \u2014 that comes with a part of being someone who explores but also someone who is disabled,\" he said.\n\n\"So my comedy is based largely on the principle that not everyone expects the disabled person to have a funny story about drinking downtown. But we have more than one.\"\n\nChanging perceptions\n\nWarren was inspired to get on stage after his friend Josh Menchions, who lives with the effects of a brain stem injury, decided to take the same chance earlier this summer.\n\n\"My focus is on me misusing my disability to make people feel uncomfortable,\" Menchions laughed. \"It's kind of a thing I naturally do.\"\n\nMenchions was in a car accident when he was only 10 months old. His mother died in the crash. He was comatose, but survived.\n\nMenchions and Warren go over their material briefly before a standup show at LSPU Hall. (Eddy Kennedy/CBC)\n\nNow 27, he lives on his own but has limited use of his legs and one arm. He gets around with the help of a wheelchair and also has a slow and low speaking voice.\n\n\"Because of my speech and because, I guess, of people's ignorance \u2026 sometimes people don't approach me as a normal person,\" he said.\n\nInstead of being angry about it, Menchions turns it into material for his standup.\n\nMenchions made jokes about his everyday life \u2014 from cracks about his speech problems, to strangers offering him money. (Ryan Cooke/CBC)\n\nDuring a performance last week at the Braxton Comedy Festival in St. John's, Menchions told a story about an elderly woman who nearly ran him over in a grocery store parking lot. She then walked up to him, spoke to him as if he was mentally disabled and offered him money.\n\nJust when he was about to tell her where to go, he changed his mind and said, \"Well, I do need money for weed.\"\n\nIt's the everyday situations that fuel his humour, rather than bring him down. Like when people can't understand him and just nod along instead of listening closer.\n\n\"I can say something ridiculous, like I'm a trapeze artist. And they'll say. 'Oh yeah, good for you.' I don't look like a trapeze artist, do I?\"\n\nComedy is therapy\n\nBoth men have been comedy fans their entire lives, and had always wanted to try it out. Being nervous about exposing their speech impediments, however, was one of the biggest obstacles they faced before finally going on stage.\n\n\"I mean, how can I make you laugh if you don't know what I'm saying? That's what my philosophy was,\" Warren said.\n\n\"One of the reasons I got into comedy was to work on my speech,\" Menchions said. \"What a better way to practise than in front of a group of people you don't know?\"\n\nMenchions has now done five shows, and Warren has done two. Both men say they've seen improvements in their speech, and it's inspired Menchions to go back to go to speech therapy to see how much better he can get.\n\n\"Between that and my comedy, I think I can really improve on my speech.\"\n\nOne of the biggest obstacles? Getting in the door\n\nThe concept of standing in front of a room full of strangers and putting yourself out there was hard enough, but when it came to physically getting on stage, there were more hurdles than expected.\n\nVery few bars in St. John's are wheelchair-accessible. Even if the bar is, the stage might not be.\n\nFor Menchions's first gig, an open mic night at Boca Tapas Bar organized by local comedian Chris Dunn, two steps stood between him and the inside of the bar.\n\nChris Dunn introduces Mencions at the show at LSPU Hall on Aug. 13. (Eddy Kennedy/CBC)\n\n\"But Chris, God love him, he went out of his way and rented a ramp for the night so I could get down in there and do my comedy act,\" he said.\n\nDunn was the MC at the show last Tuesday where Menchions and Warren performed. Between performers, he spoke about how easy it was to rent a ramp from the health authority and how much value it brought to their show.\n\n\"Seriously people, this wasn't hard,\" he said. \"It's really easy to be accessible.\"\n\nFunny future ahead\n\nMenchions is heading back to school soon, studying to be a biomedical engineer. He said he's \"along for the ride\" when it comes to comedy, and will keep doing standup gigs when he can.\n\nWarren has been so inspired by his first few gigs that he is committed to comedy. He dreams of having an hour-long special \u2014 whether it's for an international audience or a local one, his goal is the same.\n\n\"Just have an impact,\" he said. \"Make someone who was sad, smile, or make someone who is happy, happier. That's my dream. That's what I want my comedy to do.\"\n\nWarren has a positive outlook on life after all he's been through. (Eddy Kennedy/CBC)\n\nTheir journey \u2014 battling disabilities, conquering speech impediments and overcoming fear \u2014 is inspirational. They get audiences to change the way they look at people with disabilities.\n\nBut those are unintended side effects of doing what they love most: making people laugh.\n\n\"There's always points in life where you're dealt a hand that will hold you back. I'm a firm believer that we all get different cards, but with those cards there's always a way to win the game \u2014 whatever you define that as,\" Warren said.\n\n\"For me, it's just having fun. If I'm having fun, if I'm happy. If I'm laughing, smiling, that's me winning life. In a sense, that leads me back to comedy.\"\n\nRead more from CBC Newfoundland and Labrador", "description": "Living with physical disabilities can lead to some strange situations, and these two comedians are cracking people up with their stories.", "authors": ["Ryan Cooke Works For Cbc Out Of Its Bureau In St. John'S.", "Read More Articles This Author"], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5249921.1565973779!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/camron-warren-josh-menchions.jpg"}
