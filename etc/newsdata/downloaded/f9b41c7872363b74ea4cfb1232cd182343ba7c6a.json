If he also asks you how you got your hair looking so good, well, that\u2019s just icing on the cake. While visiting The Late Show with Stephen Colbert Friday to promote his new Netflix\u2019s movie Dolemite Is My Name, Eddie Murphy revealed it was Obama who got him reconsidering a return to stand-up when the pair met in 2015 after the comedian won his Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. \u201cThe first thing he asked me was, \u2018When are you gonna do stand-up again?,\u201d Murphy recalled. \u201cSo I said, \u2018Maybe it\u2019s time to do stand-up again.\u2019\u201d\n\nOf course, there\u2019s only one question more flattering than a president asking you why you aren\u2019t doing stand-up. It\u2019s a president asking how you got your hair so gorgeous and gray-free. \u201cYou know what we talked about? He talked about my hair,\u201d Murphy recalled about his encounter with the former POTUS. \u201cHe was like, \u2018What kind of rinse are you using?\u2019 I was like, \u2018What?\u2019 He said, \u2018You don\u2019t have any gray hairs.\u2019\u201d\n\nLaughed Murphy, \u201cThere\u2019s a great picture I have of me talking to him in the White House, and at that moment he\u2019s going, \u2018What kind of rinse do you use?\u2019\u201d For the record, Eddie Murphy does not color his hair, as he only has gray hairs in his mustache and nose, and apparently he just hacks those out. And that\u2019s news any future president can use.", "description": "President Barack Obama immediately asked Eddie Murphy to return to stand-up upon meeting him, before asking him his secret to fighting off gray hair.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/26-Eddie-Murphy-Colbert.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
