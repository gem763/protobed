If you already use Android 10 or iOS 13 and have dark mode switched on at the system level, Google says that Gmail will automatically adjust to dark mode. Additionally, dark mode will activate if you use a Pixel phone set to battery saver mode. If you\u2019re using an earlier Android or iOS version, you\u2019ll have to toggle a few settings.\n\nTo check if dark mode has been made available to you, open Gmail, click settings, and you\u2019ll see a new option called \u201cTheme,\u201d and within that, dark mode can be switched on.\n\nDah dah dah dum da da dum da da: Dark theme is coming to Gmail on mobile \u2192 https://t.co/hiMaeuDBJD pic.twitter.com/0ElUHzrx8R \u2014 Gmail (@gmail) September 24, 2019\n\nIf you\u2019re not seeing this option, don\u2019t worry. Google says in its press release that dark mode is releasing over an \u201cextended rollout\u201d period of 15 days or longer on Android and iOS. So if you don\u2019t already have the feature, it\u2019s on the way; you just might be in for a bit of a wait.\n\nMore and more apps are getting dark modes added, and we\u2019re tracking every development right here. A few of Google\u2019s popular apps have gotten dark mode support recently. Google Fit added the feature last month for Android and iOS users, while the feature in Google Calendar and Google Keep is currently limited to Android users. Curiously, Google\u2019s main app still doesn\u2019t have it for either operating system, nor does Google Maps.", "description": "Google has begun its extended rollout of dark mode for Gmail.
