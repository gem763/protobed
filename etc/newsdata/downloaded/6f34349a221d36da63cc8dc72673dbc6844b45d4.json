But I would caution them,\u201d he said.\n\nAdditional reporting by PA Media\n\nRead more\n\nQueen's Speech to show plans to 'restore confidence' in justice system", "description": "Boris Johnson is coming under pressure to concede more ground to Brussels as hopes for an early breakthrough in the Brexit talks appeared to falter.UK and EU officials will resume talks in the Belgian capital today with the prospects of an agreement in time for Britain to leave with a deal on October", "authors": ["Jason Collie"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/QWsoDfeVf_lJlSmJ4MS7wA--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/evening_standard_239/0f5c4f07f5ce57a966e0671667cc384c", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
