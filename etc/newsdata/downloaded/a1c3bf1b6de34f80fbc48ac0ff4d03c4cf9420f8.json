They still do.\n\nHere was the triumph of family togetherness as, thrust into difficult times, the three children showed themselves resourceful, adventurous and brave \u2014 like all the young heroes in the novels of E. Nesbit, from whose 1906 book, just one of the dozens she wrote for children, the film was made.\n\nAudiences for the wonderful 1970 film of The Railway Children wept as the winsome Roberta (\u2018Bobbie\u2019) was reunited with her lost father. They still do.\n\nNesbit \u2014 Edith by name \u2014 had an uncanny ability to enter into the minds of children and their make-believe world. She didn\u2019t talk down to her young readers, she lured them to a place they instinctively understood, a place where anything was possible.\n\nExplaining her unique rapport with them, she once wrote: \u2018You cannot hope to understand children by commonsense, by reason, by logic, not even by love itself.\n\nThere is only one way \u2014 to remember what you thought and felt and liked and hated when you yourself were a child.\u2019 She saw herself as, at heart, a child still.\n\nWhich was a good thing because \u2014 as a new biography of this ageless Victorian author reveals \u2014 her adult life in many ways was a train-wreck.\n\nNesbit \u2014 Edith by name \u2014 had an uncanny ability to enter into the minds of children and their make-believe world. She didn\u2019t talk down to her young readers, she lured them to a place they instinctively understood, a place where anything was possible\n\nA promiscuous bully of a husband cheated on her throughout their stormy, petulant marriage. Amazingly she even brought up his children by another lover as if they were her own.\n\nNot that she herself was a saint. She yearned for adventure and threw herself at men in her intense literary circle, with varying degrees of wild success and humiliating failure.\n\nChildren she instinctively understood, but adult life she found a bewildering struggle.\n\nAnd though in her writings she idealised childhood, her own was no gentle idyll.\n\nShe was just three when her father, a scientist and a teacher who ran his own boarding school, died suddenly at 43. The loss blighted her for ever.\n\nFor her there would never be that \u2018Daddy, my Daddy\u2019 reunion. Its place in The Railway Children (and others of her books) was wishful, wistful thinking.\n\nHer mother battled on alone, providing as happy a home as she could for Edith and her four siblings in a large, rambling house in Kennington, South London. It didn\u2019t last.\n\nWhen Edith\u2019s older sister, Mary, showed signs of tuberculosis \u2014 the disease that had killed their father \u2014 her widowed mother sold the school and took the sick youngster to the South of France in search of warm weather and a cure.\n\nEdith was left behind and from that point her young life was a turbulence of boarding schools (which she hated), various homes of relatives and friends and family reunions in a bewildering array of summer homes, from Brittany to Spain and the Pyrenees.\n\nE. Nesbit is pictured above with John, her husband's love-child she raised as her own. A promiscuous bully of a husband cheated on her throughout their stormy, petulant marriage\n\nShe travelled between them, often on her own and adult-free, developing in her a precocious spirit of independence and adventure.\n\nThis merry-go-round only stopped when her sick sister died and her mother returned to England, settling with the now 16-year-old Edith in a house in Islington.\n\nThere Edith \u2014 already something of a wild child by Victorian standards \u2014 met a young bank clerk and promised to marry him, only to dump him on clapping eyes on one of his colleagues, Hubert Bland. In no time she was engaged to him instead. She had found the love \u2014 and the bane \u2014 of her life.\n\nBland was big, strong and very pugnacious (he\u2019d trained as a boxer). A seditious type who dabbled with opium and dressed like a dandy in silk hat, frock coat and monocle, he was, writes Edith\u2019s biographer, Eleanor Fitzsimons, \u2018attractive to the point of irresistibility to women\u2019.\n\nWhen he met Edith, he had a long-term lover, Maggie, who was pregnant with his child. The baby was put up for adoption and the girlfriend was cast aside \u2014 though never entirely, as Edith would discover in the coming years.\n\nBesotted and deluded, she gave herself up to the dashing Hubert and by the summer of 1879, aged 20, she, too, was pregnant.\n\nDisdaining marriage as a bourgeois institution, he agreed to a last-minute register office wedding, only weeks before the baby, a boy, was born.\n\nEdith died in 1924, aged 65, wasted away by lung disease, but her name and her work lived on. Her list of admirers was huge and grew over the years. For Noel Coward, \u2018all the pleasant memories of my own childhood jump at me from her pages\u2019\n\nBland was not only a bounder but a penniless one. A business he started quickly went bust, and so it fell to Edith to scrape a living for the two of them \u2014 by selling the verses she wrote to various magazine editors and, in extremis, to manufacturers of Christmas cards.\n\nNot only were they on the breadline but, after their second child was born, she opened a letter that arrived at home for Bland and discovered he was still seeing, and presumably sleeping with, Maggie.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t have cared less that his secret was out. He believed, as he once put it, that \u2018men love women as the hawk loves the pigeon\u2019. It was his nature to be a womaniser, he professed, and she could like or lump it.\n\nLoving him as she did (and always would), she lumped it \u2014 and even used the experience as material for a love triangle story she sold to a magazine.\n\nFrom then on, writing was her full-time job, which Bland took up too, and proved to be good at. Together, they churned out short stories, essays, political tracts, pieces of journalism, anything that would bring in money.\n\nThey collected a coterie of equally unconventional people \u2014 aesthetes such as William Morris, academics, literary types, armchair revolutionaries from Hampstead whose heads had been turned by Karl Marx.\n\nThey held meetings earnestly putting the world to rights, and the Blands led the way in founding the Fabian Society, a socialist think-tank whose members, Edith cooed, were \u2018quite the nicest set of people I ever knew\u2019.\n\nShe herself proclaimed her free-thinking ways by cutting her hair to a mannish bob and replacing her Victorian corsets with flowing Liberty dresses and long scarves. She also took up smoking, a habit then seen as the preserve of men.\n\nAnd, while her husband pursued his amours, she dallied, too, her roaming eye alighting on playwright and fellow Fabian George Bernard Shaw. Edith thought him \u2018one of the most fascinating men I ever met\u2019.\n\nShe as good as stalked him, turning up at his lodgings unannounced, managing to bump into him in the reading room of the British Museum and inviting him for hot chocolate or lunch a deux.\n\nE. Nesbit is pictured with her children. And though in her writings she idealised childhood, her own was no gentle idyll. She was just three when her father, a scientist and a teacher who ran his own boarding school, died suddenly at 43. The loss blighted her for ever\n\nThey were often seen walking together, sometimes arm in arm. She told him she was prepared to leave Bland for him.\n\nHe, though, was embarrassed by her attentions, recalling that \u2018she had become passionately attached to me\u2019 and that really wouldn\u2019t do because she was \u2018a married woman and her husband my friend\u2019.\n\nHe pushed her away as gently as he could, but when he refused to commit adultery with her, she told him angrily: \u2018You had no right to write the preface if you were not going to write the book.\u2019\n\nBland, meanwhile, continued in his wicked ways, this time surpassing himself.\n\nEdith had a special friend, Alice Hoatson, with whom she worked on poems, stories and novelty books for children. It was Alice who nursed Edith through depression when she gave birth to a stillborn baby, moving in and playing auntie to the Bland children.\n\nYet Alice was simultaneously sleeping with Bland and was pregnant by him. When Alice\u2019s daughter Rosamund was born in 1886, she refused to name the father, and Edith, helping out a friend in distress, agreed to raise the child as her own. Six months went by before Alice was pressed into confessing the truth.\n\nThere was, not surprisingly, an almighty row in which Edith ordered Alice and her baby out of the house, but when Bland threatened to go with them, she reluctantly relented. She was not prepared to lose him, however much he had wronged her.\n\nAlice stayed, with her baby, who grew up as part of the Bland household, took his surname and for years believed Edith to be her mother. But from then on, the household seethed with tension.\n\nShaw visited and noted wearily in his diary: \u2018Scenes, as usual.\u2019 Another literary visitor, H. G. Wells, was struck by the drama of the Blands\u2019 home life. \u2018They loved scenes and situations. They really enjoyed strong emotion.\u2019\n\nIn later life, Rosamund would recall family meals \u2018ending in a hysterical outburst, when she [Edith] would rush from the table and retire into her study with a violent slam of the door.\n\n\u2018Daddy [Bland] would say \u201cOh, God!\u201d and make for his study, also slamming the door. But always after a short while one would hear him go up to her room.\n\n\u2018She would open the door and one could hear a murmur of affectionate phrase \u2014 \u201cNow Cat [his nickname for Edith] dearest, don\u2019t go on like that. Your old Cat loves you and you love your poor old Cat, don\u2019t you? There, kiss your old Cat and come and have your pudding.\u201d \u2019\n\nAs another twist to the plot, Rosamund suggested that it was Edith who had persuaded Alice to seduce Hubert \u2018in order to get him to give up another lady whom she loathed\u2019.\n\nAs cinematic tearjerkers go, it has few peers. On a station platform, a figure emerges out of the steam from a railway engine and a teenage girl, played by Jenny Agutter, rushes towards him with a heart-stopping cry of \u2018Daddy! My Daddy\u2019\n\nShe retaliated to his constant infidelities \u2014 his appetite for \u2018frilled petticoats\u2019, as she put it \u2014 as best she could, surrounding herself with handsome young writers and artists, who flocked to the Bland household to be dazzled by her vitality and beauty.\n\nShe flirted, she pouted, she stared intimately into eyes, but whether these dalliances developed into full-blown love affairs remains uncertain.\n\nFitzsimons, her biographer, thinks it unlikely Bland would have put up with adultery on her part. He had unashamedly double standards, which nettled Edith.\n\nIn one poem she wrote:\n\n\u2018Why should one rule be fit for me to follow,\n\nWhile there exists a different law for you?\n\nWhat do I care to be the first, or fiftieth?\n\nIt is the only one I care to be.\u2019\n\nBut there was little hope of that, with Alice a permanent part of the household and in 1899 giving birth to another baby, fathered by Bland.\n\nWith the pattern set, Edith once again agreed to raise \u2014 and love \u2014 the child, John, as her own.\n\nBut tragedy was never far away.\n\nIn 1900, her 15-year-old son Fabian had an operation at home to remove his adenoids, but never came round from the chloroform.\n\nEdith lost her mind, swathing his lifeless body in blankets and hot water bottles to warm him back to life and screaming at her husband: \u2018Why couldn\u2019t it have been Rosamund?\u2019\n\nIt was the first intimation to the poor girl that Edith was not her real mother.\n\nIn her grief for her lost boy, Edith buried herself in her work, leaping on a commission from the Illustrated London News to write a series of children\u2019s stories. The following year they were published in book form, as The Wouldbegoods.\n\nE. Nesbit had at last found her true voice.\n\nMore books followed, weaving magic, fantasy and adventure into the lives of ordinary children. The money began to roll in, with serial rights for her work not only in all the best literary magazines in London but around the world, too.\n\nShe and Bland were able to move to a large house on the edge of London that became a retreat for all sorts of writers, artists and bohemians, with Edith the queen of all she surveyed (and Bland, as ever, the knave).\n\nThe continuing melodrama of their lives reached fever pitch when the sexually voracious H. G. Wells, 42, lured the 21-year-old Rosamund away from home on the grounds \u2014 not totally improbable \u2014 that Bland was trying to seduce her, his own daughter.\n\nThe eloping Wells and Rosamund were intercepted at Paddington Station en route to Paris, Bland hauling Wells off the train and punching him.\n\nShe yearned for adventure and threw herself at men in her intense literary circle, with varying degrees of wild success and humiliating failure\n\nEdith stood by Bland in this sordid debacle, as she did in all others and would do so until a heart attack felled him in 1914. As with her dead son, she threw herself on his cold body and tried to revive him with hot water bottles, but he\u2019d gone.\n\nShe was distraught. She put aside all the wrongs she had suffered from him and desperately missed the man she described as \u2018my close and constant companion and friend for 37 years\u2019.\n\nWidowed, Edith now fell on hard times. Her children\u2019s books had gone out of fashion and there was little money coming in. She took to growing and selling flowers, fruit and vegetables on a smallholding and taking in paying guests to make a living.\n\nThe consolation in her declining years was that she at last found a love that was properly reciprocated \u2014 Tommy Tucker, ship\u2019s engineer on the Woolwich Ferry.\n\n\u2018He is the soul of goodness and kindness,\u2019 she told a friend. They married \u2014 and she was contented. \u2018I am very, very happy.\u2019 He was, she said, her \u2018consolation prize for all sorts of failures. For the first time in my life, I know what it is to have a man\u2019s whole heart.\u2019\n\nEdith died in 1924, aged 65, wasted away by lung disease, but her name and her work lived on. Her list of admirers was huge and grew over the years.\n\nFor Noel Coward, \u2018all the pleasant memories of my own childhood jump at me from her pages\u2019. C. S. Lewis and Tolkien borrowed ideas from her books. J. K. Rowling paid homage \u2014 \u2018I identify with E. Nesbit more than any other writer because she remembered exactly how she felt and thought as a child\u2019.\n\nChildren were what Edith understood. That\u2019s why she was brilliant at communicating with them and why her books still capture their imaginations.\n\nIt was grown-ups who remained a closed book to her.\n\nThe Life and Loves of E.
