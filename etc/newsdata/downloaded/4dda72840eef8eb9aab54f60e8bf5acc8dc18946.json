Excluding integration expenses, per-share earnings were $3.05.\n\nRevenue declined slightly to $17.05 billion.\n\nAnalysts polled by FactSet expected earnings of $3.15 a share and $17.06 billion in revenue.\n\nWrite to Paul Ziobro at Paul.Ziobro@wsj.com\n\nCorrections & Amplifications\n\nThis item was corrected at 6:53 p.m. ET to show that FedEx's profit in the fiscal first quarter a year ago was $835 million, not $8.35 million.\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nSeptember 17, 2019 17:04 ET (21:04 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
