It brings us both so much pleasure to spoil him. It used to be that Ken and I would be buying gifts for each other but that\u2019s all stopped now.\n\n\"These days we\u2019re obsessed with whatever new things we can get for the puppy.\u201d\n\nThey bought him for \u00a32,500 through a breeder near Carlisle, who they tracked down through The Kennel Club.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nMichael, a crane operator, said: \u201cIn the first three months of having him we spent \u00a39,000 on just collars, leads and clothes.\n\n\u201cHe loves it, I can tell he\u2019s happy when he gets a new item.\u201d\n\nBurly\u2019s raw food diet sets the couple back \u00a360 per week. The cultural canine also gets treated to nights out at the cinema and theatre \u2013 even attending a special screening of The Lion King.\n\n\u201cBurley loved the cinema, he was barking away at the beginning when they held Simba up over his kingdom,\u201d Michael said.\n\n(Image: SWNS)\n\nWe like to imagine that he was singing along, he\u2019s got a lovely voice.\u201d\n\nDespite Burly\u2019s baby fur being too young for a trim, Michael takes the pooch for a pampering session every 10 days to a doggy grooming parlour called Le Chien in West London.\n\nHe said: \u201cBurly loves a blow dry and getting fussed over.\n\n\u201cHe gets his little nails done too and thoroughly enjoys the whole experience.\n\n\u201cBurly still has his puppy coat so we can\u2019t trim that just yet but we\u2019re very excited for his first proper cut.", "description": "Michael O\u2019Hagan, 34, and partner Ken, 55, pride themselves on giving their eight-month-old fluffball the best of the best", "authors": ["Hattie Bishop", "Image", "Swns"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20466556.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_SWNS_BURLY_DOG_10JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
