But when the time comes next year and that intensity starts to ramp up, I'm sure I'll be fully switched on.\n\n'It is something you do embrace, because it is a goal you set yourself \u2013 it is something you work towards. It was no different with the 50-over World Cup when we were building towards that, so you do speak about it.'\n\nJordan has not played for England since their most recent T20 match, against Pakistan at Cardiff in May, but among the experimental side here in New Zealand only captain Eoin Morgan has won more 20-over caps than his 39.\n\nOne man who won't join the tour until next month's two-Test series is Jordan's close friend and Sussex team-mate Jofra Archer.\n\nJordan (left) consoles Ben Stokes during England's agonising defeat in India in 2016\n\nJofra Archer's success during the World Cup helped Jordan feel part of the experience\n\nBut Jordan admitted that Archer's success during the World Cup helped him feel part of the experience \u2013 even though he didn't make England's final squad of 15.\n\n'When Jofra was performing the way he was, it felt like I was making those performances as well,' he said. 'It was that touching, it was that daring, especially in the World Cup final, when he bowled that awesome super over. If anything I felt just as much a part of it.'\n\nEngland were scheduled to begin their six-week tour last night with a 20-over warm-up game against a New Zealand XI in Lincoln, with the likes of Tom Banton, Saqib Mahmood and Pat Brown all appearing at senior level for the first time.\n\n'Pat is young, he's got a free mind, he's fearless and he's got some awesome skills,' said Jordan.\n\n'We've been having a few good conversations over the last few days, speaking about bowling and field placings. He's a very keen bowler and a real student of the game.'", "description": "LAWRENCE BOOTH IN CHRISTCHURCH: Jordan's death bowling is expected to play a central role in England's five-match T20 series against New Zealand this week in Christchurch.", "authors": ["Lawrence Booth For The Mail On Sunday"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/26/22/20226792-0-image-a-26_1572125126082.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
