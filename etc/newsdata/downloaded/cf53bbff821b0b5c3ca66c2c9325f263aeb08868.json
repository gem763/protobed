Other students have taken note \u2014 joining her in organizing the Fridays for Future movement.\n\nNearly 1.4 million young people stretching across 123 different countries walked out of class on Friday, March 15, to protest the lack of action taken towards avoiding a climate change catastrophe.\n\n\"Our house is on fire,\" she said in a Davos speech in January. \"I don't want you to be hopeful.
