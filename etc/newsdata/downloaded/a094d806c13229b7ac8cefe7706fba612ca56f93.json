But during Tuesday\u2019s Knockout Rounds episode, Gwen revealed to her contestant Kyndall Inskeep and guest mentor Taylor Swift that before all that, in 2013, one of Sia\u2019s signature solo songs was actually intended to be a Stefani single.\n\n\u201cThis song's crazy, because Sia sent me this song for me to do,\u201d Gwen told Kyndall, referring to \u201cElastic Heart.\u201d Gwen ultimately decided not to record the triumph-of-the-spirit power-ballad because she understandably thought the \u201cweird, unique song\u201d was \u201cvery specific\u201d to Sia\u2019s voice. But interestingly, Gwen decided it was the perfect fit for Kyndall this week.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time in Voice history that Gwen had trusted one of her quirkier Team Gwen singers with this particular song. In Season 12, one of her all-time greatest and certainly most weird-and-unique contestants, Hunter Plake, put his own dynamic spin on it. So Kyndall had her work cut out for her, taking on a challenging, octave-straddling empowerment anthem that a) one special contestant had already so exquisitely interpreted and b) an A-list pop star like Gwen Stefani had actually shied away from. But Kyndall, with her textured and elastic voice, was definitely up for the task.\n\n\u201cYou know when people passive-aggressively say, \u2018That was interesting\u2019? I mean, it legitimately was interesting,\u201d an impressed Taylor marveled during Kyndall\u2019s rehearsal. \u201cI love that you stripped it down. I love the song choice. Your tone is so beautiful, it's crazy. You've got so much going on with your voice.\u201d\n\nOnstage, Kyndall\u2019s magical songbird vocals almost sounded foreign \u2013 like Bjork, or Robyn, or some kind of fairy princess/wood/nymph/space alien. Or, frankly, like Sia \u2014 Kelly Clarkson did warn Kyndall not to choose on-the-nose songs, which would make such comparisons unavoidable. But Kyndall did enough to make the song her own, with the perfect precarious balance of strength and fragility, technical precision and raw emotion. She was very present, very connected, and I think Gwen made the right decision to let her be the one to sing it \u2013 even though I\u2019d personally be curious to hear a version by Gwen someday. With all Gwen has been through since 2013, she certainly could connect to the \u201cElastic Heart\u201d lyric too.\n\nKyndall of course won her Knockout over Jessie Lawrence, whose cover of Sam Smith\u2019s \u201cDancing With a Stranger\u201d had a smooth groove but was nothing remarkable. And with the coaches only having one Steal each, Jessie didn\u2019t do enough to stay in the game. And so, another bit the dust, as Sia might say. But \u2014 spoiler alert! \u2014 one Steal did get used, by Gwen herself. Read on for the rest of Tuesday\u2019s Knockout Rounds results.\n\nTeam Legend: Khalea Lynee vs. James Violet\n\nKhalea wasn\u2019t playing when she took on Celine Dion\u2019s \u201cBecause You Loved Me,\u201d an advanced diva ballad that her coach John Legend called a \u201cbarn burner.\u201d The ambitious song choice could\u2019ve proven disastrous for a lesser singer, but the stately and elegant Khalea performed it like a legend, like a Grammy-winner (or certainly like a Voice-winner), with poise and perfect pitch. The audience was going absolutely mad for her, and Kelly told her, \u201cYou just made a Celine Dion song sound easy to sing!\u201d John added, \u201cKhalea, you remind me in a lot of ways of Whitney Houston, because she would do this kind of big, broad kind of pop ballad, but she would put just a little gospel on it.\u201d This dynamite lady was the clearly one to beat.\n\nJames\u2019s rendition of Post Malone\u2019s \u201cStay,\u201d however, proved that he deserved to stay. (See what I did there?) It was incredibly Steal-worthy. James had a hushed, earnest delivery that really drew me into the lyrics; he\u2019s clearly a natural-born storyteller. And while Khalea was the superior singer here, James\u2019s performance and overall vibe was much more modern. There seemed be room on the show for both very different contestants.\n\nWhen James lost, I was hoping he\u2019d be stolen, but unfortunately, his time was up. But he made possibly the classiest Voice exit ever, saying, \u201cThere's not really a better person to lose to. Khalea was an honor to work with, and she really pushed me. So, thank you.\u201d Aw. What a guy. He will be missed.", "description": "Gwen decided not to record this hit herself, but she decided it was the perfect fit for Kyndall Inskeep.", "authors": ["Lyndsey Parker", "Editor-In-Chief"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/HEVuSjoiu8T.sV1pjva1Ew--~B/aD0zNzEyO3c9NTU2ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/5748c940-fac5-11e9-bb5e-b5bc4cf757ab", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
