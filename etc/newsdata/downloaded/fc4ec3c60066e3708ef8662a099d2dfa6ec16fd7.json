Khan defected after appearing to lose an internal power struggle with Thiam. He\u2019s expected to take up his duties on Tuesday, UBS chairman Axel Weber told Bloomberg last week.\n\nCS wasn\u2019t immediately able to comment on the FT and Bloomberg reports.\n\nUBS could certainly do with a little bit of Khan\u2019s magic. Its stock is down 7% so far this year, while Credit Suisse\u2019s is up 14%. And Thiam\u2019s house also looks better on a three-year comparison, up 3% while UBS has fallen 14%.\n\nIn part, that\u2019s because UBS moved faster and more radically to cut its investment bank division after the regulatory backlash to the financial crisis, and focus on the more predictable wealth management business. It has lost momentum in recent months, losing $2 billion through net client withdrawals in the second quarter. Thiam's restructuring has been a more recent affair.\n\nElsewhere Monday, it was a quiet opening to the week for European stocks, despite a reported upgrade from JPMorgan (NYSE: ) analysts. The was effectively unchanged at 391.82 by 5:30 AM ET (0930 GMT), while the was also unchanged. The U.K. was down 0.2%", "description": "StockBeat: Thiam Set to Survive Spy Drama at Credit Suisse", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/news/LYNXMPEB290BM_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-30"}
