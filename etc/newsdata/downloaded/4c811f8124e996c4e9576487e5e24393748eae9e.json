My teenage brother is always arguing with my parents. I\u2019m afraid that one day he might do something bad. I think we are not the only family facing such issues.\n\nMy brother has become a gaming addict ever since he met some new \u201cfriends\u201d. He argues with our parents when they ask him to study. He says our parents are putting too much pressure on him.\n\nGaming might be the cause of his bad behaviour. I believe that playing video games for a long time can also affect your eyesight and cause headaches.\n\nI think there are a lot of teenagers who are video-game addicts. We must help them before it is too late.\n\nParents must find out the reasons for their children\u2019s bad attitude. It could be school pressure, having too much homework, playing video games, having bad friends, and so on. Parents must show that they are willing to help their children. If the problem is gaming, for example, parents could set a time limit \u2013 say, 30 minutes \u2013 for gaming each day.\n\nTeenagers are going through a confusing time. Secondary school is hard, but that is just how life works.\n\nHansen Cheng, Diocesan Boys\u2019 School\n\nWhen hobbies become obsessions: why too much of a good thing can be a bad thing\n\nFrom the Editor\n\nThank you for your letter, Hansen.\n\nAdolescence is a difficult time we all have to face. So much is changing within you as you grow up. This is the age when children can develop unhealthy habits that can become problems later in life.\n\nMany students find gaming is a good way to pass the time, but before they know it, three hours have gone by and there\u2019s a lot of catching up to do. This is not good.\n\nIn your brother\u2019s case, maybe your parents can arrange a time to have a chat with him? Your brother\u2019s teachers may also be able to help him.\n\nI agree that school is not easy. It\u2019s a big problem for today\u2019s teenagers. They are under pressure to get good marks and fit in with their peers. Apart from having to cope with revision and homework, some of them attend tuition classes or music lessons. Form Six students have extra pressure from the HKDSE.\n\nBut there are many ways to relax. You can read a book, listen to music, play sports, or go for a hike.\n\nDoing voluntary work is also a very meaningful way to spend your free time.\n\nSpending time with your family is also important. Remember, time is precious so make sure your time is well spent.\n\nM. J.
