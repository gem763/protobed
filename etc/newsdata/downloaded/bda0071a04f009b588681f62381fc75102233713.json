He also sent the EU an \"explanatory letter\" from the United Kingdom's ambassador to the EU and a letter signed by Johnson making it clear he doesn't want a delay to Brexit, per the Guardian.\n\nWhy it matters: Johnson had said he would rather be \"dead in a ditch\" than seek an extension. But he was legally required to send the Brexit delay request after the U.K. Parliament passed a law in September requiring him to seek a Brexit extension rather than crash out of the EU without a deal on Oct. 31.\n\nWhat they're saying: European Council president Donald Tusk tweeted, \"The extension request has just arrived. I will now start consulting EU leaders on how to react.\"\n\nGo deeper: U.K. Parliament thwarts Boris Johnson's Brexit plan\n\nEditor's note: This article has been updated with comment from Tusk and more context.", "description": "Smart, efficient news worthy of your time, attention, and trust", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://assets.axios.com/203e9f932cc97836ac2ff4c6c982676c.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
