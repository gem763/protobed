It\u2019s a season when everyone else wants to watch the goriest horror films and pay money for haunted-house \u201cexperiences\u201d where people jump out at you covered in blood. But what if you don\u2019t like things that are that scary and you want to enjoy spooky season without your hands over your eyes?\n\nLuckily for you, not all spooky movies contain actual horror. We\u2019ve put together a list of films that are more \u201ctreat\u201d than \u201ctrick\u201d for those of us who find the world terrifying enough right now without adding any jump scares into the mix. Some are cult classics, some are set during Halloween, and some are for kids, but what they all have in common is that they (probably) won\u2019t give you any nightmares.\n\nAddams Family Values (1993)\n\nWith the upcoming release of another Addams Family film, what better time to return to, well, the best one? Addams Family Values has the perfect balance of dark and hilarious to be just spooky enough without giving you actual nightmares. It sees our favorite goth anti-nuclear-family unit come up against evil Debbie (Joan Cusack), a woman who wants to marry Uncle Fester to steal his fortune and murder him. Meanwhile, Wednesday and Pugsley are wreaking havoc on a summer camp. The Addams Family have always gone against convention by loving one another wholly while embracing their darkness, and this one is worth a thousand rewatches for the performances, the black comedy, and some of the greatest spooky one-liners in film history.\n\nEdward Scissorhands (1990)\n\nThere is one true king of creepy-but-not-terrifying: Tim Burton. The director made his name in the \u201990s with fun, eerie films like Beetlejuice, Corpse Bride, Ed Wood, and 1990\u2019s fantastic Edward Scissorhands. The film follows a man (Johnny Depp) with, yes, scissors for hands as he\u2019s adopted by a suburban family, takes on a new hairdressing career, and comes up against scared, cruel locals who just want to paint him as a monster. Sure, some people are frightened by the gentle man with scissors for hands. But at its heart, Edward Scissorhands is a love story about someone not quite creature or human navigating the world and trying to be loved despite his outwardly grotesque appearance. Relatable!\n\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975)\n\nIf you\u2019re feeling left out this Halloween, what better way to counter it by heading to a theater filled with a welcoming community of movie lovers? Unlike a lot of the titles on this list, Rocky Horror is geared more toward adults than kids. Initially a flop, the film adaptation of the Rocky Horror Show has become the cult classic to end all cult classics. The tale of normies Brad and Janet stumbling upon Dr. Frank-N-Furter\u2019s quest to build the ultimate man has stood the test of time, partly through incredibly catchy songs like \u201cDammit Janet\u201d and, of course, \u201cThe Time Warp.\u201d\n\nLabyrinth (1986)\n\nNothing says Halloween quite like the image of David Bowie\u2019s crotch in skintight pants. 1986\u2019s Labyrinth is a year-round classic starring Jennifer Connelly as Sarah, a bratty teen who gets her baby brother kidnapped after wishing he\u2019d be spirited away by goblins. To be fair, she shouldn\u2019t necessarily have expected Goblin King Jareth (Bowie) to show up at her window and make good on her wish. When she takes it back, he gives her 13 hours to solve the labyrinth, make her way through the realm, and save Toby from being turned into a goblin forever. Cue dancing, singing, and very, very stinky bogs. High stakes, low scares.\n\nGhostbusters (1984)\n\nGhostbusters is about a gang of paranormal scientists who team up to fight the ghosts that haunt and harass their neighborhood \u2026 but you already knew that. What makes it the perfect Halloween film, other than its subject matter, is the not infrequent veers it takes into frightful territory \u2014 when Dr. Venkman\u2019s (Bill Murray) would-be girlfriend, Dana, is possessed by Zuul, an evil demigod bent on opening the gate between dimensions \u2014 without being too scary. The villain does become a giant marshmallow, after all. For a double bill, watch Ghostbusters 2, yet another film featuring a kidnapped baby.\n\nBeetlejuice (1988)\n\nMore Tim Burton! The first film of his that large audiences would associate with his now iconic, instantly recognizable motifs, Beetlejuice, starring Michael Keaton, sees a family (the Deetzes) move into a home that\u2019s haunted by the couple (the Maitlands) who used to live there. Fed up with the Deetzes, the Maitlands weakly try to scare them away but are befriended by the Deetz daughter, Lydia (Winona Ryder), in the process. The two families go on to engage in all sorts of creepy stunts and hijinks but \u2014 spoiler \u2014 end up finding a pretty wholesome, if dark, solution.\n\nScooby-Doo (2002)\n\nListen. Would this article be comprised solely of Scooby-Doo movies, both cartoon and live-action, were it entirely up to me? Oh, absolutely. But while I would like to give an honorable mention to 1999\u2019s Scooby-Doo! and the Witch\u2019s Ghost and its girl-power rock band the Hex Girls, Scooby-Doo is the best one for a Halloween rewatch. It proves once and for all that dogs are the only creatures on earth with truly pure souls. It\u2019s funny. It has a stellar cast of \u201990s legends like Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddie Prinze Jr., Matthew Lillard, and Linda Cardellini. But above all, it\u2019s pretty spooky, with missing souls, big monsters, and a bizarrely muscular Scrappy-Doo that might just slip into your nightmares.\n\nJennifer\u2019s Body (2009)\n\nTeen flick Jennifer\u2019s Body is a must-watch. It\u2019s a little gory at times, but the initially badly received and recently reappraised Megan Fox\u2013starring film has more than earned its place in a spooky Hall of Fame. Directed by Karyn Kusama and written by Diablo Cody, the movie centers on a girl named Jennifer (Fox) who goes on a murderous rampage after being killed as a sacrifice by a rock band. From the perspective of her put-upon best friend, Needy, the film examines dangerous men and vicious female friendships with more finesse than it was initially given credit for. Jennifer\u2019s Body uses humor and some classic Cody-isms to keep things just north of \u201cextremely horrific,\u201d so while it can be intense, it\u2019s at least free of jump scares and psychological torture.\n\nThe Craft (1996)\n\nSpeaking of vicious female friendships, The Craft is a big one for that. Now an underground favorite, the film stars Robin Tunney as Sarah, a girl who joins a new school and befriends Nancy (Fairuza Balk), Bonnie (Neve Campbell), and Rochelle (Rachel True). The three girls are outcasts and believed to be witches; after displaying some supernatural powers, Sarah is welcomed into their coven. They use magic to get revenge and to get what they want, becoming increasingly cruel and reckless. It\u2019s an old-school cautionary tale about the meanness of girls and the danger of power, and it\u2019s just spooky enough to feel Halloween-y without giving you nightmares.\n\nClue (1985)\n\nHow scary can a board game be, after all? (Or at least one that isn\u2019t Ouija.) Loosely based on the game of the same name, Clue sees six strangers invited to a dinner party at an out-of-the-way mansion. They are given pseudonyms \u2014 you guessed it, based on the game characters\u2019 names \u2014 and told that they\u2019ve been summoned because they\u2019re being blackmailed by a seventh guest, a Mr. Boddy. He tells them that if he\u2019s arrested, he\u2019ll expose their secrets, then gives them different weapons with which to kill the butler, who arranged for them to come to the mansion. Now a beloved cult classic, the film is fast-paced, farcical, and very Halloween-appropriate. Also: It has three possible endings, which is always fun.\n\nDeath Becomes Her (1992)\n\nDeath Becomes Her was pretty divisive on first release, but like many of the movies on this list, its campy humor has given it new life. The film stars legendary actresses Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn as fiercely competitive rivals who, after a lifetime of fighting, both drink a potion that promises them eternal youth \u2014 with some caveats. When the pair actually die, they end up coming back to life as corpses, something that required a fair bit of impressive visual-effects trickery to pull off. The women\u2019s bodies need constant maintenance: a commentary on the chase for eternal youth and the endless quest to fix and cure the unfixable as we age. The women\u2019s resilience and struggles have made the film a touchstone for the LGBT community, and it\u2019s every bit worth a revisit.\n\nHocus Pocus (1993)\n\nHonestly, reading this list really hammers home how long it has been since we\u2019ve had an influx of spooky-but-not-scary films. In our current horror-film-obsessed world, it\u2019s good every so often to return to the comforting arms of Hocus Pocus, a film directed by Kenny Ortega (of High School Musical fame) about a trio of witches who are resurrected on Halloween by a young boy who wants to impress a girl. The witches attempt to acclimate to the future but wreak havoc all the same, trying to suck the souls out of all the children of Salem before being defeated by young Max and going back whence they came. A Halloween essential.\n\nCasper (1995)\n\nShortly after Christina Ricci was Wednesday Addams, she became Kat, a grieving 13-year-old who wants nothing more than a friend. It\u2019s a relatable tale if a sad one, and, in Kat\u2019s case, it sees her befriend Casper, a friendly ghost who\u2019s looking to be loved. Having no memory of his life as a boy, Casper needs Kat to prompt him, and he learns that he died of pneumonia and became a ghost, driving his father to become obsessed with bringing him back to life. In the film\u2019s bittersweet ending, Casper is temporarily transformed into a human boy by the angel of Kat\u2019s mother at a Halloween party. He gets the chance to dance with Kat, and after kissing her, he transforms back into a ghost.\n\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas (1993)\n\nEven more Tim Burton! There are a lot of musical-esque films on this list because, for some reason, nothing makes people want to sing like spooky bones and ghouls. The Nightmare Before Christmas is about Halloween Town, a place filled with goblins and ghouls. Their esteemed leader, Jack Skellington, accidentally stumbles into Christmas Town and is amazed by what he finds. He decides his residents will take over Christmas and put their own spin on it by giving creepy gifts to the general population. The Nightmare Before Christmas has been hugely influential and is a perennial favorite, so much so that Disneyland lets it take over the Haunted Mansion at Christmastime.\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer (1992)\n\nNo, not the show. The film of the same name, which was released five years before the series, is often criminally overlooked because of the TV version\u2019s success. Granted, the movie doesn\u2019t star Sarah Michelle Gellar, but Kristy Swanson, who plays Buffy here, is every bit as fun. Fans of the show will recognize the movie\u2019s story line, which follows shopping-obsessed Buffy as she learns via her \u201cwatcher\u201d that she actually has a destiny as a slayer. Initially rejecting this, she tries to come to terms with it while keeping up with her duties as a normal high-schooler. Joss Whedon, who wrote the film, was reportedly not too happy with it, but for Buffy fans (and even those who aren\u2019t), it\u2019s a spooky, silly high-school film that laid the groundwork for the beloved TV show. Plus, the soundtrack rules.", "description": "Not all spooky movies contain actual horror.
