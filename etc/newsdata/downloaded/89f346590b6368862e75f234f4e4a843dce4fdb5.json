Johnson is obliged by legislation passed by parliament last month to accept an extension once offered.\n\nJohnson will respond to the EU's delay offer once he has reviewed the details, his spokesman said on Monday.\n\nTwo senior EU diplomats confirmed that the written procedure period agreed was 24 hours, effective from the time London accepts the offer of a Brexit delay from Oct. 31 to Jan. 31.\n\nBritain's departure has already been delayed twice - from March 29 and April 12 - after Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, failed three times to get her deal ratified by parliament.\n\nWith British politics still paralyzed over carrying out Brexit 3-1/2 years after a 52%-48% referendum vote in favor of Leave, Johnson is demanding parliament approve an election on Dec. 12 in return for more time to adopt his deal.\n\nBut he needs the support of two-thirds of the 650 lawmakers for a new election. A House of Commons vote was due later on Monday.\n\n\"FLEXTENSION\"\n\nThe EU, forged from the ruins of World War Two as a way to prevent another devastating conflict in Europe, is fatigued by Britain's Brexit crisis but keen not to be held responsible for an economically tumultuous \"no-deal\" Brexit.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron had been the main hurdle to an extension, arguing there had to be a good reason for a delay and that the British needed to break their own political deadlock. But a source close to Macron said the prospect of an election in Britain had strengthened significantly.\n\nThe source stressed that the third Brexit delay would come with conditions, including a refusal to renegotiate the divorce agreement and giving a green light to other EU countries to meet without Britain to discuss the bloc's future.\n\nAn EU diplomat said the hope was that the British would use the postponement wisely. Even though the United Kingdom is set to leave, it will have a legal obligation to nominate a new commissioner for the EU's powerful executive body.\n\nThe latest delay plan envisages that Britain could be out on Dec. 1 or Jan. 1 should parliament ratify the agreement in November or December, respectively, according to diplomats who deal with Brexit in Brussels.\n\nThe EU will state that the extension, the third granted so Britain can sort out the details of its departure, will not be used to renegotiate the divorce treaty again, and that London should not impede other essential work by the EU on projects ranging from budgets to climate policies.", "description": "EU nations agree Brexit delay until January 31 as PM Johnson seeks election", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9R0SI_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
