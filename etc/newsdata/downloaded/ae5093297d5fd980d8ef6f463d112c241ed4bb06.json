Where he lived, everyone knew everyone, and there was a palpable sense of community. In the tower block, danger lurked.\n\nBarnet\u2019s early experiences left him with a passionate belief that hard-working families deserve to live in decent homes, where parents and children can feel safe. Sigma Capital aims to deliver on that belief.\n\nAffordable housing opportunity: The UK is crying out for new homes and there is growing demand for rental accommodation, as property becomes increasingly costly\n\nFounded and run by Barnet, Sigma develops and manages affordable homes for rent \u2013 helping people who want to live in attractive, well-maintained houses but cannot afford to buy or actively choose not to.\n\nMidas recommended Sigma shares in December 2015, when they were 81p. Today, they are \u00a31.02 and brokers believe they should rise to \u00a31.50 over the next two years, following strong interim figures last week and the promise of more to come for the full year.\n\nProperty development is a complex industry. Land needs to be sourced, planning permission has to be granted and homes need to be built on time and on budget.\n\nHowever, the UK is crying out for new homes and there is growing demand for rental accommodation, as housing becomes increasingly costly.\n\nBarnet aims to satisfy that demand, working with local authorities and key housebuilders who believe in his vision.\n\nInitially, Sigma funded its activities primarily through cash sourced from a Kuwaiti investment firm, Gatehouse Bank.\n\nBut two years ago, Barnet launched the PRS Reit, an investment dedicated to providing rental homes for middle-income households and families.\n\nThe Reit, listed on the main market, has raised \u00a3500 million and is on track to amass a portfolio of more than 5,000 homes on estates around the country.\n\nSigma sources these homes, works with housebuilders to make sure they are built to the right standards and manages the properties once they are completed.\n\nIn return, Sigma receives fees from the Reit, which increase the more homes are built.\n\nDemand is huge \u2013 with four households applying for every home \u2013 and Barnet has recently launched a venture with the Scottish government, pursuing the same model north of the border as in the English regions.\n\nMidas verdict: Sigma Capital can seem rather complex but the fundamental principles behind the business are simple. Britain needs more houses and increasing numbers of people, including families, are turning to the rental market.\n\nThey deserve decent homes \u2013 and Sigma intends to deliver them. Shareholders who bought in 2015 have done well but, at \u00a31.02, they should hold on to their shares. New investors could also take a punt on this stock.", "description": "The UK is crying out for new homes and there is growing demand for rental accommodation, as housing becomes increasingly costly.", "authors": ["Joanne Hart For The Mail On Sunday", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
