About 8.5 million people could get the worst of the storm, including torrential rain and powerful wind gusts.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Boston warned of \"very heavy rain\" and \"strong to perhaps damaging\" winds. The National Weather Service said there could be rough surf and flooding in the northeast U.S. and New England through Thursday.\n\n\"This is going to be a record-breaking storm,\" said CBS News weather contributor Jeff Berardelli.\n\nThe storm will be especially strong, Berardelli said, because of a storm in the Great Lakes and a storm that's moving up the eastern seaboard. Those storms are merging to form the nor'easter, which Berardelli predicted will lead to record-low pressure for the month of October.\n\nA powerful nor'easter will bring very strong winds, heavy rainfall, rough surf, and flooding to portions of the Northeast U.S. and New England through Thursday. \u2014 National Weather Service (@NWS) October 17, 2019\n\nThe heaviest bands of rain will move through New England on Wednesday night, and will likely cause airport delays. Wind gusts of up to 70 mph are also expected in parts of Cape Cod.\n\nThe nor'easter could also lead to power outages, and may even bring snow to the highest-altitude parts of the Catskills and Adirondacks by Thursday afternoon, Berardelli added.", "description": "The storm is expected to bring heavy rainfall and powerful winds", "authors": ["Victoria Albert"], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/10/16/d10e523d-c450-4582-8571-d659dc755df6/thumbnail/1200x630/758bb425de48eccb981588a1cd931d5c/1016-noreaster-berardelli-1953212-640x360.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
