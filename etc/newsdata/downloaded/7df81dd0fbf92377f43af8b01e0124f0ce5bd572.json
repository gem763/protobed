It's not a quick-fix thing. It takes time to understand the implications and I think it's just about education and I'm just trying to highlight areas.\n\n\"Whether people choose to look into those, that's up to them, but I'd feel like I wasn't doing anything positive if I didn't mention it.\"\n\nHamilton added that he is taking steps to ensure that his life is \"carbon neutral\" before the end of this year.\n\nHe explained: \"I'm trying to make sure that by the end of the year I'm carbon neutral. I don't allow anyone in my office but also within my household to buy any plastics. I want everything recycle-able down to deodorant, down to toothbrush, all these kind of things. So I'm trying to make as much change as I can in my personal space.\n\n\"I sold my plane over a year ago. I fly a lot less now, I try to fly less through the year and mostly fly commercial so that's been a big change in my habits. I've avoided trips as well if I don't need to do it, been in the UK for example with family and gone up to Bedfordshire and stayed with the family instead of gone on holiday.\n\n\"Obviously I've changed my diet which is quite a drastic difference.\"", "description": "Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton says he has no interest in leaving F1 for Formula E, despite his recent comments about wanting to reduce his carbon footprint.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/2806/e212f43d6acf499582922b563bcbc9c4.png", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
