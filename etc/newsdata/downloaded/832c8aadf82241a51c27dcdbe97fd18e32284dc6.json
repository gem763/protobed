There are three achievements for using an item called a Mythic Goldfish, but that\u2019s easier said than done.\n\nFortnite Chapter 2 has three achievements related to an item called a Mythic Goldfish: one for catching it, one for eliminating players with it, and one for being eliminated by it yourself. The Mythic Goldfish is, as the name would suggest, pretty rare. Leakers found evidence of it in Fortnite\u2019s files last week, but players weren\u2019t sure it was in the game yet.\n\nLeaker Hypex suggested the fish does 90 damage, but as PCGamer reports and as confirmed by players now it\u2019s in the game, it does 200. That makes it massively powerful; for comparison, Fortnite\u2019s unpopular Infinity Blade only did 75 damage to players and was considered to be pretty game-altering, leading developer Epic to eventually vault it.\n\nSince hints of the goldfish appeared, players have been searching for it. Reddit user BlakeBenow posted one of the earliest clips showing themselves being eliminated by the fish two days ago (and, as a consolation, getting the \u201cSleep with the Fishes\u201d achievement for being killed by it). Since then, other players have also found the fish, though most say they\u2019re still looking for it.\n\nThe Mythic Goldfish is powerful, but unlike the Infinity Blade, it\u2019s hard to get your hands on. So far there isn\u2019t a ton of advice for how to catch it, with some players reporting that they\u2019ve searched for it for hours without success.\n\nYou\u2019ll get the \u201cTrophy Hunter\u201d achievement for eliminating another player with the Goldfish if you find it on the ground, but Dotesports reports that finding it doesn\u2019t count for the \u201cNo One Will Believe You Caught This\u201d achievement for, well, catching it. So far, your best bet seems to be picking up a fishing pole and heading out.\n\nLots of players on YouTube have been streaming their efforts to find the fish, so if you aren\u2019t up for the hunt yourself, you can watch other people live out Fortnite\u2019s version of Moby Dick. If you do find the Mythic Goldfish, let me know your tips for reeling it in.", "description": "Some of Fortnite\u2019s new achievements are trickier to unlock than others.
