Mark Sanford on Monday said that House Democrats\u2019 impeachment push makes it more difficult for Trump primary challengers to get their message out amid a \u201ccircle the wagons\u201d sentiment from the GOP.\n\n\u201cIt becomes the giant elephant in the room,\u201d Mr. Sanford said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cAnd all political discussion, if you will, stops.\u201d\n\nMr. Sanford, who is vying for Republicans\u2019 2020 presidential nomination, said that substantively he thinks an impeachment inquiry into President Trump is justified.\n\n\u201cThough it may be justified, it will bring tremendous discord within the political system that will then usurp the electoral process that\u2019s now taking place on the Democratic side,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOn the Republican side, what happens is that people circle the wagons,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey feel as if their president is under threat; they circle the wagons that much harder. It makes it that much more difficult to get your word out if you\u2019re a challenger.\u201d\n\nThough recent polling has shown the public increasingly embracing the idea of impeachment, Mr. Sanford predicted that Mr. Trump\u2019s level of support will intensify among diehard supporters.\n\nJim McLaughlin, a Trump campaign pollster, did predict that the impeachment push will unify Republicans heading into 2020 and consolidate support among Mr. Trump\u2019s backers.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
