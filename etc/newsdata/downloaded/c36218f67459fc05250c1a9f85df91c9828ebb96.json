The club took swift action in the removal of the offensive banner that perpetuates racial stereotyping.\n\n'Football isn't separate from society, it is part of it and we all have a responsibility in ensuring people understand there is no room for racism.\n\nOrigi (right) arrives at his former club's stadium as he is named on the bench for the clash\n\n'Simply banning people is not the answer. Education and reaffirming there is no place for discrimination in society has to form part of the solution.'\n\nUEFA did not comment on the matter on Wednesday night but it is almost certain they will take action against Liverpool; a recent example came in May 2018 when Bayern Munich were fined \u20ac25,000 for an 'illicit banner' that was on display in their Champions League semi-final with Real Madrid.\n\nLiverpool have vowed to take the strongest possible measures against the fan, or fans, who brought the banner into the Luminus Arena and they will be studying footage to identify those responsible for the mindless behaviour.\n\nThis will be the second time in the space of a month that Liverpool have found themselves the subject of disciplinary proceedings from UEFA \u2013 last month they were fined \u20ac10,000 following an incident of pitch encroachment by individual supporters when they Red Bull Salzburg 4-3.\n\nOrigi in action during Wednesday night's Champions League match with Genk in Belgium\n\nA Liverpool spokesperson said: 'Liverpool Football Club condemns the offensive banner displayed in our section of the ground, prior to kick off. To be clear, the image used perpetuated a racist stereotype.\n\n'This is completely unacceptable. We acted swiftly to have the banner removed and we are now working with the local authorities and stadium team in Genk to identify those responsible. Any subsequent action will be taken in keeping with our sanctions process.'\n\nKick It Out backed Liverpool's statement when asked for a comment on the incident.\n\nManager Jurgen Klopp refused to comment on the offensive banner.\n\nWhen asked about the banner, Klopp, whose side strolled to victory with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain scoring a classy double, would only say: 'I know the club have spoken about it.'\n\nOrigi is a cult hero with Liverpool fans, having scored the goal that secured the 2-0 victory in last season's Champions League final against Tottenham. The Belgium international, who started his career at Genk, was also on the mark twice in the epic semi-final defeat of Barcelona.\n\nRomelu Lukaku was the target of chants over his manhood from Manchester United fans\n\nHaringey star Coby Rowe is restrained by security staff following an alleged racist incident\n\nHe signed a new long-term contract in the summer, having at one stage looked as if he might leave, but started last night's game on the bench after Mohamed Salah recovered from injury.\n\nChants referencing the size of a player's manhood were directed at former Manchester United striker Romelu Lukaku, who urged fans to stop singing the offensive songs in September 2017.\n\nWednesday's incident comes days after an FA Cup tie between Haringey Borough and Yeovil was abandoned when players walked off the field following allegations of racist abuse.\n\nThat came just a week after England stars Raheem Sterling, Tyrone Mings and Marcus Rashford were all racially abused during England's Euro 2020 qualifier with Bulgaria in Sofia.\n\nSeveral of England's black players were racially abused during their game with Bulgaria\n\nSome supporters in a section of the Bulgaria fans were seen making the Nazi salute during the Euro 2020 qualifier\n\nKlopp condemned racist abuse last season, by saying: 'It's disgusting, another example of something which absolutely should not happen.\n\n'It's still only a few people doing it, but the stronger the reaction is from all of us, the more it will help to avoid things like this in the future.\n\n'If you do something like that, you should not be able to enter a stadium again, in my point of view, in your life.'\n\nRangers striker Alfredo Morelos was also racially abused during Sunday's 1-1 draw with Hearts at Tynecastle.\n\nAlfredo Morelos was allegedly the target of racist abuse from Hearts fans in Sunday's 1-1 draw\n\nHearts have vowed to root out the racists after opening an investigation into allegations after the Colombian striker was allegedly targeted by punters during goal celebrations following his equaliser.\n\nHearts issued a statement declaring: 'The club is aware of the incident in question and is currently investigating it.\n\n'It goes without saying that Heart of Midlothian Football Club utterly condemns any form of racism \u2014 and any individuals found guilty of such an offence will face an indefinite ban from Tynecastle Park.'", "description": "A banner of Divock Origi described by Liverpool as 'offensive and unacceptable' was also displayed at June's Champions League final in which the striker scored the second goal.", "authors": ["Adam Shergold For Mailonline", "Dominic King For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/24/14/20132778-0-image-a-4_1571923366005.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
