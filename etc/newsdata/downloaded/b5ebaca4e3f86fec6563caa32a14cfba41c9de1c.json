Jagdfeld cited a comment by PG&E Corp\u2019s CEO last week that it could take ten years to shore up its grid enough to ratchet down the blackouts.\n\nThe bottom line for Generac: $100 million to $200 million of annual revenue, perhaps as soon as 2022, Jagdfeld said in an interview in New York on Friday, a day that saw his shares hit an all-time high. California, with its generally mild climate, wasn\u2019t a big market for Generac until the blackouts began. While an expansion in the state will take time, Generac is gearing up a sales force and a marketing push to make it work.\n\n\u201cIt is a situation where we see a long-term upside for building awareness for our products,\u201d Jagdfeld said. Generac expects California will get about $1 million of the $10 million spent this year on infomercials, he said, and will open an office in Sacramento for training, inventory and retail next year.\n\nThere are some issues, he said. The state\u2019s tough regulatory profile, for instance, means that some of Generac\u2019s present equipment may not meet environmental guidelines.\n\nThe company, which expects about $2 billion in revenue this year, works with about 6,000 electricians nationwide, Jagdfeld said. At the start of the year, there were only 100 in California. Now that number has risen to 250, he said, and the company is adding about 30 new ones a month.\n\n\u201cThe interest level in California has been pretty material,\u201d said Stanley Elliott, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. \u201cYou are going to continue to have these rolling brownouts.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the push into California, Jagdfeld said the company\u2019s recent acquisitions of Pika Energy Inc. and Neurio Technology Inc. may have helped drive up the company\u2019s stock. Since May 1, Generac\u2019s shares have risen 65% to $90.71 per share. One company makes products that let consumers monitor the power they use, the other allows homeowners to direct power from their solar arrays.\n\nWhile they aren\u2019t included in Jagdfeld\u2019s $100 million to $200 million goal for revenue in California, they represent \u201ca nice, natural fit into our existing product lines, that we could start to forge a position in the home, in the utility panel,\u201d Jagdfeld said.\n\n--With assistance from Mark Chediak.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Brian Eckhouse in New York at beckhouse@bloomberg.net;Nic Querolo in New York at jquerolo1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Lynn Doan at ldoan6@bloomberg.net, Reg Gale, Will Wade\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- A \u201cdecade of darkness\u201d in California is offering a huge opportunity for the sale of generators that keep the lights on when the power grid goes down.That\u2019s the view of Aaron Jagdfeld, chief executive officer of Generac Holdings Inc., the Wisconsin-based maker of generators.
