To put that in perspective, that's like downloading 2 HDTV episodes of Game of Thrones,\" Avast said.\n\nImage: Avast\n\nFurthermore, even if it didn't produce low-quality or duplicate photos, one of the worst offenders in terms of wasting device space was WhatsApp.\n\nThe app's default settings had it auto-downloaded all the images a user would receive on their device. Users who think they're just viewing a photo someone shared with them, end up saving that image to their devices, and so taking up precious space.\n\n\"Our study revealed that, on average, our users had 292 WhatsApp images stored on their phone,\" Avast said.\n\nAnother app that also took up a lot of memory space was the phone's built-in screenshot utility. Users who took a screenshot would often forget to delete these photos from their devices. According to Avast, most users have, on average, 86 screenshots per device.\n\n\"Screenshots can take up a lot of space, especially when your phone is running at higher resolutions,\" Avast said.\n\nAdditional stats are available in the company's two-part blog posts detailing the survey results [1, 2].", "description": "On average, users waste 636 MB of their phone's memory storing useless photos.", "authors": ["Catalin Cimpanu"], "top_image": "https://zdnet2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/05/24/5b617375-900b-4f17-af6f-ae4f61f381e6/thumbnail/770x578/4fa33a1af8f34dc60b0e278953960c39/man-on-boat-selfie.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
