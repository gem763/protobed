There really is a lot of unknowns. There is a lot of information that needs to be gathered,\u201d he said during a news conference.\n\nDeaths have also been confirmed in Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota and Oregon, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Friday. In addition, the agency is probing 450 cases of lung illness that may have been caused by e-cigarette use around the country.\n\nThe CDC said the total count of confirmed cases of illness linked to vaping remained at 215, the same as its update last month, but a number of other cases of lung illnesses remained under investigation.\n\nStaff from health agencies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), said they have not linked the illnesses to any specific e-cigarette product or any particular substance in the e-cigarettes.\n\nThe FDA said on Friday many of the samples tested by the states or by the agency as part of the investigation contain tetrahydrocannabinol (or THC), the psychoactive component of cannabis. Most of those samples with THC tested also contained significant amounts of Vitamin E acetate, the agency said.\n\n\u201cConsumers are urged to avoid buying vaping products on the street, and to refrain from using THC oil or modifying/adding any substances to products purchased in stores,\u201d the FDA said in a statement.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Vaping products are displayed for sale in a shop in Manhattan in New York City, New York, U.S., February 6, 2019. REUTERS/Mike Segar\n\nThe CDC said no evidence of infectious diseases has been identified and therefore the lung illnesses are likely associated with a chemical exposure.\n\n\u201cSomething has to be done. There\u2019s not enough regulation. There\u2019s not enough action taken by our politicians,\u201d said Tim Johnson during a news conference in Illinois on Thursday after his daughter fell ill with a lung illness believed to have been caused by vaping. \u201cWe may have dodged a bullet with our daughter.\u201d\n\nE-cigarettes are generally thought to be safer than traditional cigarettes, which kill up to half of all lifetime users, according to the World Health Organization. But the long-term health effects of vaping are largely unknown.", "description": "A Los Angeles County resident has died from a lung illness possibly tied to vaping, bringing the total number of such U.S. deaths to five, health officials said on Friday.", "authors": ["Manas Mishra", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190906&t=2&i=1427029175&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF851UA", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
