(socialism) is the wrecker of nations and destroyer of societies\u2026Events in Venezuela remind us all that socialism and communism are not about justice, they are not about equality, they are not about lifting up the poor, and they are certainly not about the good of the nation. Socialism and communism are about one thing only: power for the ruling class\u2026In the last century, socialism and communism killed 100 million people. Sadly, as we see in Venezuela, the death toll continues.\u201d (President Trump at the UN Sept 25, 2019.)\n\nStuff like this (i.e. truth) isn\u2019t supposed to be disclosed at the UN, much less by a U.S. president! But it got even better:\n\n\u201cAccording to U.N. Human Rights Commissioner, Maduro\u2019s Cuban-trained death squads have murdered up to 10,000 Venezuelans, and they think that number is extremely low. These atrocities are an outrage to all and everything that we hold dear.\u201d (Trump, InterContinental New York Barclay New York, New York, Sept. 25, 2019.)\n\nWait, what happened to...\n\n\u201cCastro brought superb systems of healthcare and education to his people.\u201d (Jimmy Carter, 2002.)\n\n\u201cThe United States recognizes the progress that (Castro\u2019s) Cuba has made as a nation, its enormous achievements in education and in health care.\u201d (President Barack Obama, March 2016.)\n\nIndeed, Castro and his Stalinist apparatchiks aren\u2019t accustomed to this type of insolence from a U.S. president.\n\n\u201cTalk is Cheap\u201d (Keith Richards, 1988.)\n\nVery true, Keith, especially for politicians. But in fact, President Trump\u2019s talk at the UN was preceded and followed by actions that have both the sniveling puppet Maduro and his (formerly smug) Cuban puppeteers furious and seriously rattled.\n\n\u201cThe State Dept. on Thursday ( Sept 19) expelled two members of Cuba\u2019s mission to the United Nations and barred the remaining members from leaving Manhattan\u2026The Cubans were found to be running spy operations on American soil.\u201d (Fox News Sept. 19.)\n\nIndeed: \u201cVirtually every member of Cuba\u2019s U.N mission is an intelligence agent.\u201d (Cuban defector Alcibiades Hidalgo, Raul Castro\u2019s one-time Chief of Staff and later Cuba\u2019s ambassador to the U.N., 2002.)\n\n\u201cU.S. slaps sanctions on firms moving Venezuelan oil to Cuba\u2026The U.S. Treasury Department on Tuesday imposed sanctions on four maritime firms and vessels transporting Venezuelan oil to Cuba, amid an acute fuel scarcity in the island that is forcing people to line up for gasoline and public transport.\u201d (Reuters, Sept 24.)\n\nThe Castro- Family-Crime-and Terror-Sponsoring-Syndicate (grotesquely mislabeled as \u201cCuba\u201d by the Fake News Media) is not used to this type of talk or treatment lately from a U.S. president. For decades, their UN-stationed spies have been free to scheme, propagandize and otherwise cavort from sea to shining sea with their multifarious agents-of-influence in the U.S. media, think tanks and the Democratic Party.\n\nThe party\u2019s over.\n\nAnd this scheming has not always been \u201cinnocent\u201d and propaganda-oriented. To wit:\n\nOn Nov. 17, 1962, J. Edgar Hoover's FBI cracked a plot by Cuban agents that targeted Macy's, Gimbels, Bloomingdale's, and Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal with a dozen incendiary devices and 500 kilos of TNT. The holocaust was set for the following week, the day after Thanksgiving.\n\nCastro planned his Manhattan holocaust weeks after Nikita Khrushchev foiled his plans for an even bigger one. \"Say hello to my little friends!\" Castro had dreamed of yelling at the hated Yankees in October of 1962, right before the mushroom clouds. But for the prudence of the \"Butcher of Budapest,\" Castro might have pulled it off. \"If the missiles had remained,\" Fidel's sidekick Che Guevara confided to the London Daily Worker in November 1962 regarding the Cuban Missile Crisis, \"we would have used them against the very heart of the U.S., including New York.\"\n\nIn his diaries, Nikita Khrushchev hints that the genocidal fantasy of Fidel and Che (these maniacs might get their fingers near the buttons!) was a bigger factor in his decision to yank the missiles from Cuba than JFK's so-called blockade.\n\nAt any rate, in the nick of time on November 19, 1962, J. Edgar Hoover's FBI foiled the plot, arrested the Castroite plotters, and nixed the slaughter of thousands of New York holiday shoppers. A little perspective: For the March 2004 Madrid subway blasts, all 10 of them that killed and maimed almost 2,000 people, al-Qaeda had used a grand total of 100 kilos of TNT. Castro and Che Guevara\u2019s agents planned to set off five times that amount of explosive power in some of the biggest department stores on earth, all packed to suffocation and pulsing with holiday cheer on the year's biggest shopping day.\n\nThe chief plotter was Roberto Santiesteban, chief aide to Carlos Lechuga, Cuba's UN ambassador. Under him were Elsa and Jose Gomez Abad, also employed by Cuba's diplomatic mission at the UN. The rest of the plotters belonged to the Fair Play for Cuba Committee. Had those detonators gone off, 9/11's death toll would have almost certainly taken seconds.", "description": "\u201cTell it like it is, don't be ashamed to let .09/28/2019 6:18:19AM EST.", "authors": ["Humberto Fontova", "Matt Vespa"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/267/6e71c29d-f45e-489a-933f-3b242b5291d7.png", "published_at": "2019-09-28"}
