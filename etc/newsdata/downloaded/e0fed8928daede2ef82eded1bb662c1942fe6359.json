We knew the significance of a point here, we knew the significance of three points but to come away with nothing, we have to look to the final two games.\u201d\n\nDevastated was a word O\u2019Neill used more than once in describing Northern Ireland\u2019s mood at the end of a match in which they had executed their game plan admirably, using a high press to disrupt Holland\u2019s game.\n\nFor long periods, they frustrated the hosts and put the pressure on the shoulders of a young team wanting to ensure the Dutch do not fail to reach a third major tournament in a row.\n\n\u201cIt was very hard on us to lose two goals so late in the game, having defended for so long and gone ahead in the game,\u201d O\u2019Neill said.\n\n\u201cIt was a combination of fatigue on our part and the quality of the opposition.\n\n\u201cThey were able to make substitutions that strengthened them and that ultimately proved to be the difference.\u201d\n\nRonald Koeman had described Magennis\u2019s goal as like an \u201caxe in the neck\u201d for Holland but was proud of the way they picked themselves up.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t really fight them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had a lot of possession but we were not able to do much and we got sloppy.\n\n\u201cIt was difficult with the time-wasting and the fouls but we must have respect for them. They have less quality but they\u2019ve got the maximum results for what they have.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Neill pointed to the lack of depth in his squad, with Koeman able to introduce De Jong, Donyell Malen and Donny Van De Beek late on while he turned to Magennis, Jordan Thompson and Tom Flanagan.\n\n\u201cThey bring on players like Malen and De Jong and Van De Beek who has been courted by clubs all over Europe, and we brought on two lads who play in the English League One,\u201d O\u2019Neill said.\n\n\u201cHopefully people recognise that. It was a fantastic performance but ultimately one that was disappointing in the end.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be a team that pats ourself on the back and say we came here and did well but we lost. We want to be a team that\u2019s better than that.\u201d\n\nPA", "description": "Michael O\u2019Neill admitted the odds were firmly against Northern Ireland\u00a0qualifying directly for\u00a0Euro 2020\u00a0after a heartbreaking late defeat to\u00a0Holland\u00a0on Thursday night.
