I think now they\u2019re just becoming more manifest because costs are coming down, the technology is more manageable \u2014 you don\u2019t have to be as sophisticated to deploy it,\" Gottlieb said.\n\nDriving the news: NPR reported last week that as synthetic DNA gets cheaper and easier to make, there's growing concern about the technology being used to create bioweapons or dangerous viruses.\n\nJosiah Zayner, a \"biohacker\" who became notorious for using CRISPR on himself in 2017, runs The ODIN, a company that sells DIY gene-editing kits online and teaches people how to use CRISPR. The kits are available on Amazon.\n\nCalifornia passed a law this summer that outlaws the sale of DIY genetic engineering kits unless they come with explicit warnings that they're not to be used for self-administration, Vox reports.\n\nAt the same time, scientific advances in genetics have made breakthrough therapies possible.\n\nOnly 3 weeks ago, Chinese researchers used CRISPR technology to safely treat a man with cancer and HIV, Bloomberg reported.\n\nLegitimate drug development comes with its own complicated ethical questions. Patients and parents of children with life-threatening diseases are likely to start asking for experimental gene therapies, STAT reported last week.\n\nGene testing \u2014 as opposed to gene altering \u2014 poses new risks, as well.\n\nWhen consumer DNA testing databases began being used by law enforcement to crack criminal cases, privacy questions arose. And privacy issues have been amplified as medical and sperm donors have lost their assurance of anonymity.\n\nDNA testing has also opened the door to creative forms of fraud. Just last week, federal agents took down an alleged Medicare fraud scheme in which seniors were convinced to get their cheeks swabbed for unnecessary DNA tests, as STAT reports.\n\nGo deeper: The ethical red flags of genetically edited babies", "description": "At the same time, it creates new therapeutic possibilities.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/blnFv94D9SxM5dfv2eaG9xgWeNY=/0x0:1920x1080/1920x1080/2019/09/30/1569880331340.png", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
