You had to forcibly pry off the keyboard and top cover assembly to get to the internals \u2014 iFixit used a knife on the Surface Laptop \u2014 and when you finally got to those internals, it turned out that none of them were user-replaceable. They were so hard to work with that iFixit gave both the Surface Laptop and Surface Laptop 2 repairability scores of zero out of 10.\n\nFor the Surface Laptop 3, though, iFixit says you can loosen up the top cover assembly just by unscrewing four Torx Plus screws on the bottom of the laptop. Once you do, you can use a guitar pick or another soft prying tool (maybe even a fingernail?) to gently lift up the top cover, which is attached to the rest of the computer by magnets and a single flex cable.\n\nHowever, once you\u2019ve taken the cover off, you won\u2019t be able to spec up the Surface Laptop 3 to your heart\u2019s content, as the CPU and RAM are soldered to the motherboard. The only thing you can easily swap out is the M.2 2230 SSD, if you can actually find one.\n\nMicrosoft warns against swapping it, saying that a \u201cskilled technician\u201d should be the only ones to do so, but the only thing holding the SSD down is a single Torx Plus screw \u2014 so if you know what you\u2019re doing, and you\u2019re willing to risk voiding your warranty, it looks like you\u2019ll be able to add some storage to the laptop on your own.\n\nIf you\u2019re really crafty, you might be able to repair a broken keyboard, the headphone jack, or even the entire display, but the SSD looks to be the easiest to get to.", "description": "Earlier this month, Surface boss Panos Panay showed how you\u2019d be able to get into the Surface Laptop 3 just by lifting off the top plate \u2014 and it turns out, it\u2019s pretty much as easy as Panay made it seem, according to iFixit\u2019s Surface Laptop 3 teardown.", "authors": ["Jay Peters", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ed3PHjeQMkoyOmyh7Rbwm1wuZ0k=/0x237:1600x1075/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19314168/vtjxLIWYO6HT16GS.huge.png", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
