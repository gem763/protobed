He still needed to salute, which resulted in him ignoring his hand to perform the salute before quickly putting his arm down to meet her's.\n\nOops!\n\nKate being Kate, she handed it like a pro and smiled broadly until he had completed the salute and was ready to shake her hand.\n\nThe couple had a quick chat with him before heading inside to begin the engagement, the first on their busy schedule for the day.\n\nThere were there to learn more about the Teach for Pakistan programme, a fast-track teacher training programme modelled on the UK's Teach First scheme.\n\nKate wore a stunning royal blue traditional kurta for the morning's engagements, drawing comparisons to her mother-in-law Princess Diana who was pictured wearing a very similar outfit during her visit to the country in 1997.\n\nAfter meeting with some of the schoolgirls during the visit to the Islamabad school, William was told the girls were \u201cbig fans of your mother\u201d.\n\n(Image: Ian Vogler / Daily Mirror)\n\n(Image: Ian Vogler / Daily Mirror)\n\nReporters said he gave a \u201cbroad, slightly wistful, smile\u201d before replying: \u201cYou were, really? Oh that\u2019s very sweet of you. I was a big fan of my mother too. She came here three times. I was very small.\u201d\n\nLater in the day they met Pakistan\u2019s Prime Minister Imran Khan, who William knew when he was a child as he was good friends with Diana.\n\nThis evening they are attending a reception at the Pakistani Monument near Islambad.\n\nThey both wore green - the colour of the Pakistani flag - as they arrived for the banquet.\n\nWilliam was wearing a tradition Shervani for the visit, a long coat-like garment which is popular with men across India and Pakistan.", "description": "Kate Middleton found herself in a slightly awkward spot on the second day of her Pakistan Royal Tour, but she handled it like an absolute pro", "authors": ["Zoe Forsey", "Image", "Ian Vogler", "Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20586000.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Duchess-of-Cambridge.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
