Sudden hard pressure on the skin is associated with anger and tapping is a means of seeking attention, while sustained contact and stroking are associated with providing comfort.\n\nThe artificial skin is made of three layers, consisting of a layer of stretchable copper wire sandwiched between two layers of silicone. Pressure on the skin changes the electric charge of the system.\n\nThe author said that developing the sensor was a challenge.\n\n\u201cThe constraint was to develop something that was stretchable and that can also detect touch,\u201d he said.\n\nFor the demonstration of its features, the team created a phone case, computer touch pad and smart and the work is being presented this week at the ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology in New Orleans, US.\n\nIn its next phase, the skin will be modified to make it more realistic, including with embedded hair and temperature features. Previously, Teyssier designed a robotic finger which enables smartphones to crawl across a table.\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Scientists invented an artificial skin for smartphones to make it 'ticklish' that will responds when touched which the team called it 'Skin-On' interface.", "authors": ["Web Desk"], "top_image": "https://arynews.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/artificial-skin-for-touchpad-1.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
