Yet there is something reassuring about a matchup between the two postseason teams that got the most innings from their starters in the regular season.\n\nWhile many teams have reimagined their pitching philosophy \u2014 asking less of starters in an effort to maximize strikeouts and, they hope, minimize injury risk \u2014 two collections of durable, dominant aces are left standing at the end of this season.\n\n\u201cI personally am a big fan of starting pitching,\u201d said Cole, who will face Scherzer in Game 1. \u201cAnd there are a lot of really good starting pitchers on the other side of the field, guys that kind of emulate the role in terms of longevity, durability, creativeness, tenacity, grit. It\u2019s just a pleasure to share the field with them on the greatest stage.\u201d\n\nUsing an opener \u2014 as the Yankees and the Astros did in the decisive Game 6 of the A.L. Championship Series, which ended on a homer by second baseman Jose Altuve \u2014 can sometimes make sense, Verlander said, but not in the long run.\n\n\u201cThroughout the course of a long season, 162 games, I think those guys that can go out and take the ball every five days are extremely valuable,\u201d said Verlander, who will start Game 2. \u201cAnd I think they should be looked at as such.\u201d\n\nThe Astros and the Nationals have paid top prices for their rotations. Houston traded 12 players in four deals to get Verlander, Cole and Greinke. Washington outbid the industry to sign Scherzer and Corbin as free agents, and gave a lucrative contract extension to the homegrown Strasburg.", "description": "Sure, there are offensive stars in Houston and Washington.
