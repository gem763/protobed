He has also won Wimbledon eight times.\n\nSunday's victory was his 75th win in Basel and extended his win streak at his hometown tournament to 24 matches with his last loss at the event coming in the 2013 final to Juan Martin del Potro.\n\nHe now owns four titles this season after Dubai, Miami and Halle.\n\nWith his wife, children and parents watching, Federer was presented with a metal sculpture depicting a life-sized hand ready to toss a tennis ball in honour of his landmark title.\n\n\"You don't get to win 10 titles at the same venue very often in a career -- if ever,\" added Federer.\n\n\"I couldn't be happier that I was able to do it here in Basel. It's been a great week, fans were wonderful, like in other years.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I really enjoyed myself being back in Basel. I may have had some good luck (with a quarter-final walkover against Stan Wawrinka), who knows? I started strong this week and was able to keep a solid level -- sometimes a fantastic one.\"\n\nFederer broke twice per set against his 20-year-old Australian opponent, ranked 28, in a win lasting just over an hour in front of a full-house of 9,000.\n\n\"Alex has had a great year,\" Federer said. \"It's not easy to win tournaments and he's done it three times already this year.\n\n\"There is more to come for you. As for me, I hope to be back here next year to celebrate the 50th anniversary of this event.\"\n\nDe Minaur joked that he had his own slender hopes prior to the start.\n\n\"I was hoping Roger might just get sick of winning, but that didn't happen.\n\n\"He was too good again, it's amazing. It was a dream to play him here in Basel.\n\n\"It's been a great season for me, I'll just keep pushing for bigger and better things.\"\n\nFederer will decide on Monday if he will play at the Paris Masters, the final event of the regular season before the November 10 start of the ATP Finals in London for which he has already qualified.\n\nDe Minaur was bidding to become the first Australian to win the title in Basel.", "description": "Roger Federer won his 10th Basel title on Sunday, smothering young Australian Alex De Minaur 6-2, 6-2 to secure what the Swiss legend described as \"an unbelievable\" success at the home-town tournament where he used to work as a ballboy.
