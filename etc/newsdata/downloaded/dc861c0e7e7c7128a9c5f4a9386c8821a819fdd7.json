He dashed out of Westminster and to City Airport, where he boarded his trusty RAF Voyager for Brussels.\n\nJohnson was jubilant at the European Council summit, where EU leaders took less than three hours to sign off his new agreement.\n\nFor a Downing Street so often portrayed by the opposition \u2014 and indeed by resigning Cabinet ministers like Amber Rudd \u2014 as insincere about a clinching a pact, the culmination of negotiations brought a certain schadenfreude.\n\n\u201cNo one can now sling mud about him not being serious about getting a deal,\u201d a Downing Street official said.\n\nBounding into a press conference on Thursday evening, Johnson told reporters: \u201cIt will be a very exciting period now to get to the positive side of [the Brexit] project. The extraction having been done, the building now begins. And I'm very confident that when my colleagues in parliament study this agreement, that they will want to vote for it on Saturday, and then in succeeding days.\u201d\n\nFirst rule of politics\n\nBut his most immediate colleagues \u2014 Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party who agreed to support the Conservative government after the last election \u2014 dealt him a major blow on Thursday morning when they confirmed their 10 MPs could not support his plans. The Brexit deal entails checks on some goods being shipped from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, breaching the \u201cblood red line\u201d of no trade border down the Irish Sea that was set by DUP leader Arlene Foster.\n\n\u201cThese proposals are not, in our view, beneficial to the economic well-being of Northern Ireland and they undermine the integrity of the Union,\u201d the party said in an angry statement. A spokesman confirmed the DUP will not just abstain but will vote against the deal on Saturday.\n\nThe decision throws the parliamentary arithmetic into chaos for Johnson. The DUP was seen by Downing Street as the route to unlocking 28 of the most pro-Brexit Tories in the so-called European Research Group, who refused to back the deal Theresa May agreed with Brussels. The ERG was then seen as the route to unlocking around 20 Labour MPs who represent Leave seats and want Brexit done.\n\nMany of the key figures in those factions kept quiet on Thursday \u2014 or at least appeared to keep their options open \u2014 in an encouraging sign for the prime minister. The ERG will meet Saturday morning to discuss their position. An aide to a Labour MP said that more of their group were thinking about backing the deal than was previously expected. Nineteen wrote to Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk earlier this month, pledging their support for a Brexit pact.\n\nJohnson made them a direct and public appeal during his press conference, hinting that sweeteners they have been demanding \u2014 on environmental protections and workers\u2019 rights \u2014 could be within their grasp if they back him on Saturday.\n\nHe said the Political Declaration on the future relationship with the EU contains \u201cimportant provisions and commitments that this country gladly makes about our determination to maintain the highest possible standards, both with the environment and the social protections.\u201d He added: \u201cWe make those commitments gladly and they are entirely right for us to do.\u201d\n\nParty political broadcast\n\nBut Johnson also made clear during his press conference that he is ready for plan B if the numbers in parliament fail to materialize.\n\n\u201cThis is our chance in the U.K., as democrats, to get Brexit done, and come out on October 31,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is our chance to focus on our priorities, the people's priorities, the NHS, putting 20,000 police on the streets, lifting up funding of education across the country, the biggest expansion of the living wage.\u201d\n\nThe manifesto list was a reminder that the prime minister wants a general election soon. If he loses the vote in the Commons on Saturday, and the parliamentary arithmetic makes it likely he will, he will be forced to trigger a Brexit delay and will likely launch another push for an election.\n\nUndeniably, Johnson and his government are at the mercy of events, and Downing Street officials privately acknowledge that many roads could now open up.\n\nOpposition parties who insisted they would back a poll once they had legislated to prevent a no-deal Brexit will come under intense pressure to back it.\n\nIf an election does come about, the Conservatives could fight it on a ticket of \"Get Brexit done, with this deal,\" but Downing Street declined on Thursday to reveal any planned messaging.\n\n\u201cWe have always backed an election. All I would say is the thing this week is to get Brexit done. The deal is here,\u201d a No. 10 official said.\n\nSuch an election stance would leave the Tories open to attack from the Brexit Party, led by Nigel Farage, who was quick to dismiss Johnson's deal. It was, he tweeted, \"not Brexit\" because of what he described as \"the commitment to regulatory alignment,\" a reference to the pledge to match EU rules for some goods in Northern Ireland.\n\nA Brexit Party official confirmed that if the Conservatives adopted the new deal as policy, Farage\u2019s offer of a Conservative/Brexit Party pact at the next election (admittedly, something senior Tories have never publicly entertained) would be dead.\n\nMessage discipline\n\nDowning Street remains confident the clarity of their message could still win the day in an election.\n\nWith opposition parties now pulling in many different directions \u2014 and indeed, in the case of Labour, internally divided on what course to take \u2014 there is hope a deal which could turn Brexit theory into Brexit fact will only help ram home the \u201cGet Brexit done\u201d messaging, and sideline the problem of the DUP in the process.\n\n\u201cIt gives us all the more reason to have one very clear message,\u201d the first official said. \u201cThe polling reflects that the clearer we are in our mission the more likely we are to win the support of the public.\u201d\n\nUndeniably, Johnson and his government are at the mercy of events, and Downing Street officials privately acknowledge that many roads could now open up. The deal could pass cleanly on Saturday, or perhaps with an amendment demanding it be put to a second referendum. MPs could finally back an election, or stalemate could continue, with no clear way forward receiving majority support.\n\nThe precise strategy in each scenario is unknown to all but a few around the prime minister, and to some extent even they will have to react to unfolding events.\n\nThe senior official said: \u201cIt\u2019s so unclear as to whether there would be a majority for anything. We\u2019ll have to wait and see.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Johnson may find he has a few more hands to play.\n\nThis article is part of POLITICO Pro\u2019s premium Brexit service for professionals: Brexit Pro.
