Bedfordshire alone closed 42 homes, up from one in 2014; the majority of these were linked to drug use.\n\nExperts said this number was likely to be a significant underestimate but expressed concern that the surge was due to county lines drug activity, a term used when drug gangs from big cities expand their operations to smaller towns, often using violence and exploiting children and vulnerable people to sell drugs.\n\nQuick guide What is \u2018county lines\u2019 and who are the victims? Show Hide What does the term \u2018county lines\u2019 mean? The name \u2018county lines\u2019 refers to the phone numbers, or lines, that criminal gangs which traffic drugs from urban to rural areas use to organise the sale of their wares. Gangs in cities such as London, Birmingham and Liverpool use children to deal mostly heroin and crack cocaine over a network of dedicated mobile phones to smaller towns and rural areas. How big is the problem? The number of individual phone numbers identified by law enforcement officials as being used on established county lines networks is about 2,000 \u2013 nearly three times the 720 previously established. Police estimate the phone numbers are linked to about 1,000 branded networks, with a single line capable of making \u00a3800,000 profits in a year. Who are the victims and how are they recruited? The majority of victims groomed into working for gangs are 15- to 17-year-old boys but children as young as 11 have been safeguarded and girls have been targeted.\n\nMany victims are recruited over social media, with offenders luring them with images of cash, designer clothing and luxury cars, but vulnerable girls and women are being targeted by men who create the impression of a romantic relationship before subjecting them to sexual exploitation. How big is the problem? In 2015, about seven forces reported county lines behaviour. Now, 44 forces, including British Transport Police, have recorded county lines behaviour on their turf. No one really knows how many young people across the country are being forced to take part. Children without criminal records \u2013 known as \u2018clean skins\u2019 \u2013 are preferred because they are less likely to be known to detectives. The Children\u2019s Society says 4,000 teenagers in London alone are exploited through county lines, while the children\u2019s commissioner estimated at least 46,000 children in England were caught up in gangs.\n\nAs part of the county lines phenomenon, drug dealers often befriend vulnerable people and turn their homes into places to keep and sell drugs, a practice known as cuckooing. The scale of cuckooing is unclear, although last year Commander Simon Bray, the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council lead on drugs, said the number of people having their houses taken over could be in the thousands.\n\nPaul Andell, a criminologist from the University of Suffolk, said the rising number of closure orders showed \u201cthe phenomenon of cuckooing in itself is increasing, therefore increasing numbers of properties of vulnerable people are being used as the county lines drug business model expands\u201d.\n\nHe added: \u201cAlso, our responses to cuckooing are becoming more focused towards the prevailing broader business model of drug dealing, which increasingly goes beyond social supply, whereby previously local users would club together resources to buy and use in acquaintances\u2019 homes.\n\n\u201cNowadays the markets are much more organised and the kinds of behaviours associated with cuckooing are becoming more apparent \u2026 These behaviours are more visible as enforcement officers become increasingly aware and agencies now have priorities to act against these arrangements, as county lines are viewed as a national threat.\u201d\n\nNorth Yorkshire police said cuckooing was a major concern in their area. As of 30 June 2019, 90 victims of cuckooing had been identified in the year and 17 cease and desist notices in related cases had been issued. This is compared with 39 victims in total last year.\n\nDevon and Cornwall police said that as of 22 August residents of about 200 homes were known to be at risk of cuckooing and were being safeguarded by police. They said those numbers were subject to constant change and the force was taking the issue very seriously.\n\nChief inspector Rachael Glendenning of Bedfordshire Police said the sharp rise in closure orders used \u2013 going from one to 42 in four years \u2013 was \u201ca means of taking positive action against drug criminality and anti-social behaviour.\u201d She said they now look to use these powers at every opportunity.\n\nKim Warner, an area commander with Suffolk constabulary, said cuckooing was adaptable. \u201cSo if an address is being cuckooed then we have tactics to disrupt that. For example, by issuing a warrant. When you do that you displace the line but it will adapt, so they move to more street-based dealing. Then we react to that and then there is a resurrection of cuckooing \u2013 so there are peaks and troughs in the activity.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cYou have to work hard with the council to think about what to do long term to prevent it.\u201d Warner said closure orders were not always the best way to deal with trap houses, as they are known. \u201cWith some cuckooed addresses they will move in, and by the time you respond they have moved. A closure order can take months to obtain so it would work better if an individual was repeatedly getting involved in that sort of activity.\u201d\n\nSimon Harding, a criminologist at the University of West London who is writing a book on county lines, said the number of closure orders was still low and represented a fraction of the premises that were likely to be affected. Harding said the rise in closure orders was due to more police activity but also an increase in properties being used.\n\n\u201cThis in turn reflects the sheer number of such venues popping up all over the country. Cuckooing is a nasty business, very exploitative and cruel, involving the takeover of an address.\n\n\u201cUsually the victim has learning difficulties or mental health or addiction issues. Setting up in their home allows the dealers to cut their costs and have free accommodation \u2013 however, it also taps them into the local users, who all know each other, certainly for heroin users this is the case. Thus they can expedite their targeting and increase their supply much more effectively.\u201d", "description": "County lines gangs exploiting vulnerable people and using their homes to sell drugs", "authors": ["Sarah Marsh"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef4be2c31a15761cca8747125badd54cf8ca5bfa/0_10_3674_2204/master/3674.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=f807c26cd1d8f0f653c88a2f8b8ec971", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
