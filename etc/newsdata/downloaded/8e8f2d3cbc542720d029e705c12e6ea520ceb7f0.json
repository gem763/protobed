The blaze erupted late Thursday along the northern tier of the San Fernando Valley.\n\nTerrazas said the fire, as of Friday morning, was \"zero\" contained. The most immediate task, he said, was to use helicopters and \"super scooper,\" water-carrying, fixed-wing aircraft to establish some fire lines and stop it from spreading.\n\nAuthorities on Friday reported two people have died: A man in his 50s went into cardiac arrest and died near the Saddleridge fire.\n\nOne person was killed in Riverside County, east of Los Angeles, in the Sandalwood fire that earlier swept through a hilltop mobile home park, destroying 74 structures and damaging 16 others in Calimesa.\n\nThe chief said some 1,000 area firefighters were battling the Saddleridge fire. \"Nobody is going home right away,\" he said. \"This event is going to take a few days.\"\n\nLos Angeles police chief Michel Moore said the evacuation orders covered 23,000 residences, or around 100,000 people.\n\nHe urged residences to evacuate the areas immediately when ordered. The chief said people \"fighting the fire with garden hoses\" only endanger themselves and first responders who are trying to clear the area.\n\nPower outages: PG&E apologizes for not being 'adequately prepared'\n\nAuthorities said the Saddleridge blaze started as a brush fire in Sylmar, the northernmost neighborhood of Los Angeles, and quickly spread, driven by the hot, dry Santa Ana winds that sweep down from the deserts and across coastal Southern California.\n\n\u201cThis is an extremely dynamic, high wind driven fire,\u201d the LAFD said in an advisory.\n\nIn the Santa Susana Mountains near Porter Ranch, a Los Angeles neighborhood, the Aliso Canyon natural gas storage facility was evacuated and surrounded by firefighters and engines from both LA county and city departments fighting fires \"in and around\" the facility, a SoCal Gas update said.\n\nA red flag warning was in effect in Southern California through Saturday evening, with winds expected to reach as high as 60 mph and some gusts hitting 70 mph in the mountains. Red flag warnings are issued when warm temperatures, very low humidities, and stronger winds are expected to combine to produce an increased risk of fire danger.\n\nThe fire forced the closing of numerous roadways, including the 210 Freeway and the 5 Freeway, causing a massive traffic jam.\n\nHundreds of truckers were waylaid by the chaos, unable to get past highway patrol checkpoints on some of the region's busiest interstates.\n\n\u201cEverybody\u2019s packages are going to be late,\" said Dee Carter, of Aurora, Colorado, who was hauling Amazon deliveries from a warehouse in Fontana, California, to Sacramento.\n\nCarter, whose big rig was parked by the side of the 118 Freeway, was trying without luck to reroute his way around the closures. Then suddenly, as he was settling down to make steak and eggs in his sleeper cab for breakfast, the freeway reopened.\n\nCalifornia Gov.
