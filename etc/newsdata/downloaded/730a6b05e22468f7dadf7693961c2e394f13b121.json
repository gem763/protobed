Our priority is the safety of our employees and customers at our facilities.\u201d\n\nKathy Chau, 26, who works for a multinational financial firm in Central, decided to join the march during her lunch break, even though her company is against the protests.\n\n\u201cDoing the right thing is more important to me than worrying about what my boss or colleagues think of me,\u201d Chau said.\n\nShe said the fact that the student, Tsang Chi-kin, had been shot, with the bullet just centimeters from his heart, made her want to march.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing an escalation in police\u2019s abuse of power over the past few months,\u201d she said.\n\nA protester, surnamed Chan, said she was marching because of what happened on Tuesday, even though \u201ceveryone knew October 1 would be a huge battle.\"\n\nShe added: \u201cProtesters used so many ways to peacefully protest but still didn\u2019t get a proper response from the government. That\u2019s why we escalated action. I think blocking roads is a more peaceful method of demonstrating.\u201d\n\nHundreds of people also gathered outside Millennium Plaza near Cosco Tower in Sheung Wan, chanting slogans and singing the protest anthem \"Glory to Hong Kong.\"\n\nA 23 year-old banker, surnamed Poon, said he had gone on strike to join the protest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m striking because I can\u2019t accept a police officer trying to kill a citizen,\u201d Poon said. \u201cI hope office workers who couldn\u2019t come down today know that they\u2019re not alone. They shouldn\u2019t be afraid to join the protests.\u201d\n\nOrganizers asked protesters to read out a statement, uploaded to LIHKG, a popular online forum where demonstrators discuss protest strategies, that accused police of using \u201cexcessive violence towards protesters.\"\n\nVideo footage posted online showed a group of protesters chasing a police officer with a long shield, pinning him to the ground and beating him.\n\nAnother riot policeman rushed forward with his service revolver pointed at the protesters.\n\nThe policeman with his gun drawn was seen clashing with Tsang, who swung his metal rod at the officer, at which point he opened fire.\n\nThe victim then staggered backward and fell onto the other riot policeman who was under attack while pinned to the ground.\n\nA police source said the officer who opened fire issued a verbal warning before pulling the trigger, while Commissioner of Police Stephen Lo Wai-chung said the use of a live round was \u201clawful and reasonable.\"\n\nIn Admiralty, the crowd gathered in front of government headquarters, and a Form Three pupil, who only gave his name as Alvin, said he skipped class for half a day with a few friends to support the fellow student who was shot in the chest.\n\n\u201cI really appreciate his courage to fight against this regime, even though I never went to the front lines of the protests,\u201d he said, adding the shooting had made him angry and sad.\n\nAt 3:20 p.m., a crowd sang \"Glory to Hong Kong\" at Admiralty Center, an office and shopping complex above Admiralty MTR station, and chanted slogans such as \u201cHong Kong police, manslaughterer,\u201d and \u201cstand with Hong Kong.\"\n\nThey dispersed about six minutes later after abandoning the idea to gather outside the police headquarters about 1 kilometer away in Wan Chai.\n\nA 30-year-old lawyer, surnamed Li and based in Shanghai said he flew to Hong Kong \u201cto witness firsthand what is going on\u201d. He noted that most mainland Chinese did not know fully what was happening in the city.\n\n\u201cIn mainland China, we are suppressed and our media only has one voice. It is very hard to garner support for the movement in Hong Kong, but I back it.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/3c/d8/6ae26a5b4b48ae3f706eb7cb3f93/191002-hong-kong-ap-773.jpg"}
