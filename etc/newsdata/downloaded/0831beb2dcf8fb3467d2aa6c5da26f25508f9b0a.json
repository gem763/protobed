considered by climate change experts as key to the future of the planet.\n\nIt is a vital carbon store that slows down global warming while providing some 20 per cent of the world\u2019s oxygen. Its destruction \u2013 deliberate or otherwise \u2013 reduces the ability of nature to suck carbon from the atmosphere.\n\nBut Brazil\u2019s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, who came into power promising to clear vast tracts of the rainforest for development, had, until last week, remained unmoved.\n\nHe has systematically weakened institutions designed to protect the rainforest, while offering moral support to farmers wishing to turn the land into cattle ranches.\n\nAnd, although he has now placed a 60-day ban on burning and deployed 44,000 troops to fight the ongoing blazes, critics fear it is too little too late.\n\nTasso Azevedo, who runs the deforestation monitoring group Mapbiomas, said the legislation\u2019s focus on fire means developers clearing the forest would continue to legally chop down trees \u2013 and then simply burn them after the prohibition period ended.\n\nWriting in O Globo newspaper, he called for the ban on the use of fire to be extended until the end of the dry season in November.\n\nHe said: \u201cWhat we are experiencing is a real crisis, which can turn into a tragedy that will feature fires much larger than the current ones if not stopped immediately.\u201d", "description": "Almost 4,000 new forest fires were started in Brazil in the two days after the government banned deliberate burning of the Amazon, officials have revealed.
