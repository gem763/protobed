Back on Earth, his portrait sits next to that of Buzz Aldrin in the astronautical hall of fame.\n\nRoy has conflicted feelings about his father, who wasn\u2019t what you\u2019d call a devoted family guy. But Cliff is long gone, or is he?\n\nThe top brass at SpaceComm, a kind of military version of NASA, think that a series of catastrophic power surges, endangering not just Earth but the entire galaxy, might have something to do with the ill-starred Lima Project.\n\nSo they hand Roy the challenging task of whizzing the 2.714 billion miles over to Neptune, where his father\u2019s vessel was last known to be, to find out if the old man is still alive and in some way responsible for this existential threat.\n\nIn Ad Astra, which is set in the \u2018near future\u2019, Pitt plays Major Roy McBride, an astronaut so preternaturally calm, even in the face of cosmic crises, that his pulse rate never climbs above 80 beats per minute\n\nA gruff former colleague of Cliff\u2019s, nicely played by Donald Sutherland, accompanies him part of the way.\n\nDirector James Gray, who co-wrote the screenplay with Ethan Gross, has set himself a challenge, too.\n\nHis aim is to turn all this into a compelling sci-fi thriller, while also making it a touching examination of a complex father-son relationship.\n\nOn the whole he succeeds, even if the science is utterly baffling, certainly to those of us who struggled with O-level Physics.\n\nThe story of Ad Astra (a Latin phrase meaning to the stars) offers some beguiling parallels with Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s 1979 classic Apocalypse Now, and a few conspicuous nods to Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 1968 masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey, which is never a bad thing in zero-gravity circles.\n\nAnd Gray, whose most recent film The Lost City Of Z (2016) was also about exploration, up the Amazon, adds some witty flourishes along the way.\n\nRoy has to begin his mission from the moon, but his SpaceComm paymasters want him to travel there incognito.\n\nSo he takes a no-frills commercial flight, on which a blanket-and-pillow pack sets him back $125. It\u2019s the moon-travel version of Ryanair. Ryan-no-air, perhaps.\n\nThe moon, in whatever year this is meant to be, is not a serene place. In colonising it, humans have also imported greed and lawlessness.\n\nBasically, we seem to be making the same mess of things up there as down here; Gray\u2019s implication is that despite our adventurous spirit, space travel and human nature are not entirely compatible.\n\nStill, Roy, a man of few words whose inner thoughts are helpfully articulated, is soon on his way to Mars, where there\u2019s no water, but that doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t be sold up the river.\n\nIs Roy being set up by his superiors back at SpaceComm? Put it this way, by now the audience is looking for conspiracies even in the script.\n\nSurely there\u2019s ambiguous meaning about fathers and sons in the line \u2018I\u2019m being pulled farther and farther from the sun\u2019 . . . but maybe there isn\u2019t. Maybe it\u2019s just a line.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the kind of movie this is. It makes you think sometimes more than you\u2019d like to, and perhaps more than you need to. But it looks out of this world, thanks to cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema, who also worked his magic on Interstellar (2014).\n\nAnd it is blessed with a superb, quietly powerful performance by Pitt, who looks just as good in a spacesuit as his old pal George Clooney did in Gravity (2013), but once again shows that he is the more versatile actor.\n\nThe Farewell is about a very different kind of family dynamic. The rapper Awkwafina, suppressing the loud comedic instincts she showed in last year\u2019s Crazy Rich Asians, plays Billi, an aspiring writer living in New York City, whose parents emigrated from China when she was six.\n\nBack in China, her beloved grandmother, her Nai-Nai (Zhao Shuzhen), has stage 4 lung cancer but evidently doesn\u2019t know it, according to a cultural practice decreeing that you keep such news from loved ones who are dying, so that others can bear the emotional burden for them.\n\nThe story of Ad Astra (a Latin phrase meaning to the stars) offers some beguiling parallels with Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s 1979 classic Apocalypse Now, and a few conspicuous nods to Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 1968 masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey, which is never a bad thing in zero-gravity circles\n\nNai-Nai\u2019s sister tells her that scans have merely revealed \u2018benign shadows\u2019, which is what happened in the case of writer-director Lulu Wang\u2019s own grandmother. This explains the opening caption, that the story \u2018is based on an actual lie\u2019.\n\nThe well-meaning subterfuge continues throughout the movie, which switches between English and Mandarin.\n\nBilli, her parents and the extended family all gather in China, ostensibly to celebrate a cousin\u2019s wedding, though really it has been hastily arranged as a ruse to let everyone see the unsuspecting Nai-Nai for the last time.\n\nThere is plenty of charm in all this, and for a Western audience, some enlightening, often amusing glimpses of Chinese culture. But for me, the rapturous reviews in the U.S., and some extravagant praise on the film\u2019s publicity posters, kindled expectations that simply weren\u2019t met.\n\nIt\u2019s a sweet enough picture, and Awkwafina does a fine job acting against type, but there\u2019s a calculated poignancy and tweeness about it that eventually wore me down.\n\nFeminists with their fingers on the trigger? Pull the other one!\n\nThe Kitchen (15)\n\nRating:\n\nVerdict: Over-heated crime drama\n\nMelissa McCarthy again turns her back on knockabout comedy, following her Oscar-nominated performance in last year\u2019s Can You Ever Forgive Me?, in this clunky crime drama set in late-Seventies New York City and strikingly reminiscent of the recent, acclaimed Widows (though frankly I thought that wildly overrated).\n\nShe is joined by Tiffany Haddish, who is also better-known for comedy, and the ever-excellent Elisabeth Moss, together playing a trio of Irish gangsters\u2019 wives who find themselves in financial difficulties when their feckless menfolk are sent to jail.\n\nLet down by the roaring caricature \u2014 sorry, the mob boss \u2014 who had promised to look after them, the women decide to try a spot of criminal profiteering themselves.\n\nThe title, by the way, refers to the Hell\u2019s Kitchen neighbourhood of Manhattan, and also to the way our trio empower themselves by breaking free of their metaphorical shackles\n\nA psychopath with a romantic streak, played by Domhnall Gleeson, gives them the muscle they need, and they\u2019re up and running.\n\nOr rather not running, having acquired unquenchable bravado seemingly overnight.\n\nUnfortunately, writer Andrea Berloff, who has the successful hip-hop biopic Straight Outta Compton (2015) on her credits, and here makes her directorial debut, rather lets down her classy cast.\n\nThe story comes from a comic-book series, and maybe it looked good on paper, but on screen it is blunted by iffy plotting and silly dialogue, not to mention a highly questionable central premise, which presents these three women as community-spirited, feminist torchbearers.\n\nThe title, by the way, refers to the Hell\u2019s Kitchen neighbourhood of Manhattan, and also to the way our trio empower themselves by breaking free of their metaphorical shackles.\n\nWhich is all very well, but extortion and murder are nasty ways of earning a living, whoever\u2019s doing it.", "description": "BRIAN VINER: Roy (Brad Pitt), a man of few words whose inner thoughts are helpfully articulated, is soon on his way to Mars, where there's no water, but that doesn't mean he can't be sold up the river.", "authors": ["Brian Viner For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/09/20/01/18698298-0-image-a-93_1568938783471.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
