Players in both leagues have been stunned when hard-hit balls have fallen on the warning track this month, raising more questions about the makeup of the baseballs after hitters clubbed a record 6,776 home runs in the regular season \u2014 a rise attributed to unusually far-flying balls.\n\n\u201cI mean there\u2019s probably all kind of different theories behind that that I won\u2019t really get into,\u201d Shildt said before a 3-1 loss to Washington in Game 2 of the NL Championship Series. \u201cJust the fact of the matter, it could be any number of things.\u201d\n\nThe numbers don\u2019t leave much doubt, says data journalist Rob Arthur. He was among the first to suggest tweaks to the ball may have caused home runs to spike as early as 2015, and he thinks something is off with this year\u2019s October model, too.\n\nArthur published a story Thursday at Baseball Prospectus showing the postseason balls have more air resistance than the regular season balls, according to data pulled from MLB\u2019s own tracking system. Arthur projected home runs were down 50% through Wednesday\u2019s games compared to what would have been expected in the 2019 scoring environment, even though the average temperature for playoff games was higher than the regular season to that point.\n\n\u201cThe data is conclusive in showing that the playoff baseball is very different from the one used in the regular season,\u201d Arthur wrote.\n\nMajor League Baseball released a statement Thursday claiming no meaningful changes have been.\n\n\u201cThe baseballs used in Major League Baseball are manufactured in batches,\u201d it said. \u201cBalls that are used in the postseason are pulled from the same batches as balls used in the regular season. Regular season and postseason balls are manufactured with the same materials and under the same processes. The only difference is the postseason stamp that is placed on the ball. As has been previously acknowledged, however, the drag of the baseball can vary over different time periods.\u201d\n\nFueled partly by studies from Arthur and others, players and observers have become distrustful of the ball in recent years. Houston Astros ace Justin Verlander and other pitchers have claimed MLB juiced the balls intentionally to boost scoring, creating a cascade of side effects including increased strikeouts and an abandonment of small-ball strategies like stolen bases and bunting.\n\nCommissioner Rob Manfred has denied deliberately adjusting the baseball but has acknowledged this year\u2019s ball had less drag, leading to more home runs. Manfred recently reconvened scientists from an MLB-commissioned 2018 study of the baseballs, and he plans to issue a report on their most recent findings after the World Series.\n\nShildt revealed his front office\u2019s conclusion after being asked about a hard-hit flyout by Cardinals slugger Marcell Ozuna in Game 1 of the NLCS a night earlier. Ozuna crushed a ball to center field off Washington\u2019s An\u00edbal S\u00e1nchez, and Shildt was surprised when it was caught short of the warning track.\n\n\u201cI thought Ozuna got his ball, based on the sound, based on the swing,\u201d Shildt said. \u201cBut clearly it didn\u2019t get out.\u201d\n\nOzuna hit the ball 105.8 mph and with a 36-degree launch angle \u2014 a quality of contact with a 68% home run probability, per MLB\u2019s Statcast. A first-pitch temperature of 45 degrees may have been a factor.\n\nOzuna hasn\u2019t been the only batter fooled out of the box. Most notably, Braves youngster Ronald Acu\u00f1a Jr. was scolded after failing to run out a long fly in the NL Division Series. Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts was confused by a few long flies from his hitters, saying the ball \u201cseems a little different.\u201d\n\nYankees manager Aaron Boone said Saturday he hadn\u2019t seen Arthur\u2019s report or Shildt\u2019s comments, but he planned to check with his own analytics team about it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to ask our guys what we\u2019ve got,\u201d Boone said. \u201cThere may be a couple of balls in Minnesota that seemed like maybe they could have gone a little further. Whether that\u2019s the cooler weather, those kind of things, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just hearing about this now. I don\u2019t know what to make of that.\u201d\n\nVerlander, as outspoken as anybody about the juiced ball, said Saturday he hasn\u2019t noticed a change, but said \u201cwho knows?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think MLB just came out with a report they haven\u2019t changed, right? I guess we\u2019ve got to believe that, right?\u201d he said with a grin.\n\nHouston manager AJ Hinch also said he hadn\u2019t noticed a difference, and he didn\u2019t seem to care what happened with the baseball.\n\nWith one key exception.\n\n\u201cI hope every ball the Yankees hit is deflated,\u201d he said.", "description": "The St. Louis Cardinals\u2019 front office says baseballs have suddenly lost their juice this postseason, supporting a claim from a prominent data", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Christian-Gooden_St.-Louis-Post-Dispatch-via-AP-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
