(Picture: Ella Byworth/metro.co.uk)\n\nOne of the greatest tragedies of my entire life occurred earlier this week, when I thought I had been the first person to coin a new dating trend: dogfishing.\n\nThis is a phenomenon whereby people on dating apps pose with pictures of cute dogs, only for you to discover that these mutts belong to other people.\n\nConvinced that inventing this term was going to be my ticket to stardom, I quit my job and divorced my husband (sadly, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for a relationship to work when there is a disparity in wealth and fame).\n\nI also started preparing quips for when I was inevitably invited onto the Graham Norton Show, where I would regale Helen Mirren and Post Malone with the story of how I first came up with it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a great anecdote: I was speaking to someone on a dating app who had lots of pictures of the same chow chow, so I asked him if the chow chow belonged to him, and he replied that no, it was his friend\u2019s and he was just looking after it \u2013 and the rest is history.\n\nSo you can imagine the overwhelming pain, disappointment and humiliation I felt when I typed \u2018dogfishing\u2019 into Google and the search returned 4,960,000 results.\n\nI scrolled down, in a state of rising dread, to see outlets covering the term \u2013 each fresh article like a knife through my heart. I realised then that there would be no money, no fame, no Helen Mirren with tears of mirth streaming down her face.\n\nIf you see an animal this cute or funny on a dating app, beware\u2026 (Picture: Getty)\n\nBut perhaps I\u2019m overreacting. Perhaps this is no loss at all. Because, when you really think about it, isn\u2019t the concept of dogfishing a little\u2026 stupid?\n\nThe supposed problem with dogfishing is that it rests on deception, that it\u2019s an attempt at trickery. Women are statistically more likely to be attracted to men if they own a dog, apparently, on the basis that this suggests a kind personality \u2013 so the motive is certainly there.\n\nBut the same qualities that would make a dog owner kind or warm would surely also apply to dog lovers in general. There are lots of practical reasons why someone who likes dogs might not own one, unrelated to their personal warmth or lack thereof.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne study has suggested that a quarter of men with pets deliberately use them as \u2018bait\u2019 on dating apps. But it seems extremely unlikely that men who don\u2019t like dogs are borrowing them from friends or relatives in a purely cynical effort to impress women on Hinge.\n\nMaybe they just like dogs. Maybe they really do love their brother\u2019s French bulldog with an all-consuming passion; maybe they would take a bullet for their landlord\u2019s Chihuahua.\n\nBeing the \u2018victim\u2019 of dogfishing (that most heinous crime) might be disappointing in the sense that you wanted access to a cute dog yourself \u2013 but it\u2019s hardly evidence of poor moral character.\n\nAfter all, should you really be trying to date someone just because they have a dog?\n\nWhile we should never underestimate the capacity of other people to be horrible d**kheads, in this case it\u2019s probably safe to assume that if someone has pictures of dogs on their profile, it\u2019s because they like dogs.\n\nIf you also like dogs, that\u2019s something you have in common, and it\u2019s not really a cause for concern.\n\nSo that\u2019s that. Anyway, I can\u2019t wait to tell you guys about this hot new dating trend I\u2019ve come up with \u2013 this one is really going to pop off.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s basically the same thing but with cats. I haven\u2019t thought of a name yet.\n\nDating terms and trends, defined Breadcrumbing: Leaving \u2018breadcrumbs\u2019 of interest \u2013 random noncommittal messages and notifications that seem to lead on forever, but don\u2019t actually end up taking you anywhere worthwhile Breadcrumbing is all about piquing someone\u2019s interest without the payoff of a date or a relationship. Caspering: Being a friendly ghost - meaning yes, you ghost, but you offer an explanation beforehand. Caspering is all about being a nice human being with common decency. A novel idea. Catfish: Someone who uses a fake identity to lure dates online. Clearing: Clearing season happens in January. It\u2019s when we\u2019re so miserable thanks to Christmas being over, the cold weather, and general seasonal dreariness, that we will hook up with anyone just so we don\u2019t feel completely unattractive. You might bang an ex, or give that creepy guy who you don\u2019t really fancy a chance, or put up with truly awful sex just so you can feel human touch. It\u2019s a tough time. Stay strong. Cloutlighting: Cloutlighting is the combo of gaslighting and chasing social media clout. Someone will bait the person they\u2019re dating on camera with the intention of getting them upset or angry, or making them look stupid, then share the video for everyone to laugh at. Cuffing season: The chilly autumn and winter months when you are struck by a desire to be coupled up, or cuffed. Firedooring: Being firedoored is when the access is entirely on one side, so you're always waiting for them to call or text and your efforts are shot down. Fishing: When someone will send out messages to a bunch of people to see who\u2019d be interested in hooking up, wait to see who responds, then take their pick of who they want to get with. It\u2019s called fishing because the fisher loads up on bait, waits for one fish to bite, then ignores all the others. Flashpanner: Someone who\u2019s addicted to that warm, fuzzy, and exciting start bit of a relationship, but can\u2019t handle the hard bits that might come after \u2013 such as having to make a firm commitment, or meeting their parents, or posting an Instagram photo with them captioned as \u2018this one\u2019. Freckling: Freckling is when someone pops into your dating life when the weather\u2019s nice\u2026 and then vanishes once it\u2019s a little chillier. Gatsbying: To post a video, picture or selfie to public social media purely for a love interest to see it. Ghosting: Cutting off all communication without explanation. Grande-ing: Being grateful, rather than resentful, for your exes, just like Ariana Grande. Hatfishing: When someone who looks better when wearing a hat has pics on their dating profile that exclusively show them wearing hats. Kittenfishing: Using images that are of you, but are flattering to a point that it might be deceptive. So using really old or heavily edited photos, for example. Kittenfishes can also wildly exaggerate their height, age, interests, or accomplishments. Lovebombing: Showering someone with attention, gifts, gestures of affection, and promises for your future relationship, only to distract them from your not-so-great bits. In extreme cases this can form the basis for an abusive relationship. Microcheating: Cheating without physically crossing the line. So stuff like emotional cheating, sexting, confiding in someone other than your partner, that sort of thing. Mountaineering: Reaching for people who might be out of your league, or reaching for the absolute top of the mountain. Obligaswiping: The act of endlessly swiping on dating apps and flirt-chatting away with no legitimate intention of meeting up, so you can tell yourself you're doing *something* to put yourself out there. Orbiting: The act of watching someone's Instagram stories or liking their tweets or generally staying in their 'orbit' after a breakup. Paperclipping: When someone sporadically pops up to remind you of their existence, to prevent you from ever fully moving on. Preating: Pre-cheating - laying the groundwork and putting out feelers for cheating, by sending flirty messages or getting closer to a work crush. Prowling: Going hot and cold when it comes to expressing romantic interest. R-bombing: Not responding to your messages but reading them all, so you see the 'delivered' and 'read' signs and feel like throwing your phone across the room. Scroogeing: Dumping someone right before Christmas so you don't have to buy them a present. Shadowing: Posing with a hot friend in all your dating app photos, knowing people will assume you're the attractive one and will be too polite to ask. Shaveducking: Feeling deeply confused over whether you're really attracted to a person or if they just have great facial hair. Sneating:When you go on dates just for a free meal. Stashing: The act of hiding someone you're dating from your friends, family, and social media. Submarineing: When someone ghosts, then suddenly returns and acts like nothing happened. V-lationshipping:When someone you used to date reappears just around Valentine's Day, usually out of loneliness and desperation. You-turning: Falling head over heels for someone, only to suddenly change your mind and dip. Zombieing: Ghosting then returning from the dead. Different from submarineing because at least a zombie will acknowledge their distance.\n\nMORE: Dating trends: They\u2019re truly not that deep\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMORE: Fireworking is the latest dating trend to describe your rubbish love life\n\nMORE: Profiles with bikini pics and cuddling with dogs more likely to be successful on dating apps\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "Men are using photos of themselves and dogs in a bid to impress women.
