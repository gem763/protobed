But that\u2019s not quite what the conversation revealed. No matter.\n\nPelosi and rabid Trump-hating Democrats long ago preordained their impeachment ambitions. Any pretext to achieve that end will do just fine. But the speaker\u2019s pronouncement without first learning the essential facts was a stunning admission of partisan bias. All pretense has now been shed. Pelosi and her confederates will do anything to undo the 2016 election results and drive Trump from office.\n\nNevertheless, facts are stubborn things. They are critical, if not dispositive, in legal cases. They are also highly relevant in the inherently political process known as impeachment.\n\nMARC THIESSEN: TRUMP, UKRAINE AND DEMOCRATS' DOUBLE STANDARD\n\nSo, let\u2019s examine what we have learned so far, realizing that many more facts have yet to be unspooled in what Trump is now calling the latest version of the interminable \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nThe Telephone Conversation\n\nThe early reporting on the leaked conversation with Zelensky alleged that Trump demanded a \u201cquid pro quo.\u201d That is, Trump allegedly ordered Ukraine to help investigate allegations of corruption involving Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, or the U.S. would withhold hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to Ukraine. However, the transcript shows no demands or conditions were stated or otherwise discussed. No promises were contingent on financial assistance. Did President Trump apply pressure on Zelensky? There is no evidence of that in their discussion.\n\nInstead, after congratulating the Ukrainian president on his election to office, Trump asked Zelensky to help investigate matters of alleged wrongdoing involving \u201cthis whole situation with Ukraine.\u201d Trump made vague references to Crowdstrike and \u201cthe server.\u201d\n\nThis appears to be a reference to the origins of the Russia \u201ccollusion\u201d investigation and the suspected role of Ukraine, the Democratic National Committee, and the cybersecurity firm that the DNC retained to examine hacked servers.\n\nThis part of the conversation is cryptic. But if Ukraine possesses some evidence of corrupt acts involving Democrats or Hillary Clinton surrogates or anyone else, this would logically be something that the U.S. should be made aware of.\n\nThe phone conversation between the two leaders then turned to fired Ukrainian prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. Trump remarked how \u201cBiden went around bragging that he stopped the prosecution so if you can look into it\u2026 It sounds horrible to me.\u201d The videotape of Biden boasting of the \u201cquid pro quo\u201d he engineered is a remarkable lesson in hubris and foolishness.\n\nThe speaker\u2019s pronouncement without first learning the essential facts was a stunning admission of partisan bias. All pretense has now been shed.\n\nBy way of background, Shokin is on record telling the Washington Post that he was fired in 2015 because he was investigating Hunter Biden and his Ukrainian gas company, Burisma, and that then-Vice President Joe Biden threatened to withhold $1 billion dollars in U.S. aid unless Shokin was sacked:\n\n\u201cI will answer that the activities of Burisma, the involvement of his son, Hunter Biden, and the (prosecutor general\u2019s office) investigators on his tail, are the only, I emphasize, the only motives for organizing my resignation.\u201d\n\nFast forward to the July 25, 2019 Trump-Zelensky telephone call. Zelensky volunteered that a new investigator would look into the matter. Trump asked Zelensky to speak with Attorney General William Barr and the president\u2019s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani about it. This was not unreasonable.\n\nDemocrats, like Pelosi, claim that the conversation is absolute proof that Trump was asking a foreign government to help him damage his political opponent, Biden, in the upcoming election. But the proof is not absolute at all.\n\nIf the president of the United States is made aware of suspected corrupt acts by a public official involving a foreign nation, he has every right to ask that nation to either investigate and/or produce any evidence. Indeed, it is incumbent on him to do so.\n\nOne of the president\u2019s fundamental duties is identified in the \u201ctake care\u201d clause (or \u201cfaithful execution\u201d clause) of the U.S. Constitution. It imposes duty on the chief executive to take care \u201cthat the Laws be faithfully executed.\u201d President George Washington observed, \u201cit is my duty to see the Laws executed; to permit them to be trampled upon with impunity would be repugnant to that duty.\u201d\n\nWhether it be immigration laws or finance laws or criminal statutes, the president is duty-bound to enforce all laws. Failure to do so would be a dereliction of his duty, as our first president believed.\n\nBiden does not get immunity simply because he used to be vice president or is currently running for president. Was Biden\u2019s confessed \u201cquid pro quo\u201d pressure on Ukraine a potential crime? More facts and evidence is needed. But using your public office to benefit your son might constitute such corruption crimes as bribery or honest services fraud. On this basis, Trump had every right to ask for evidentiary assistance from a foreign power.\n\nUnlike Biden, who threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. taxpayer money from Ukraine, Trump did not explicitly mention the freezing of roughly $400 million from Kiev.\n\nThe president has repeatedly stated he put a hold on the funds because he was reticent about giving such an enormous sum of money to a newly elected president who was taking over a government widely known for corruption.\n\nAs columnist Marc Thiessen pointed out in the Washington Post, Democratic Senators Robert Menendez, Richard Durban, and Patrick Leahy had been far more overt two months earlier when, in a letter, \u201cthey implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake\u201d if the nation\u2019s prosecutor general did not capitulate to their own demands over the closing of several investigations connected to the Mueller investigation. Hypocrisy, of course, is rampant throughout this sordid story.\n\nThe \u201cWhistleblower\u201d Complaint\n\nAll of this came to a sudden boil when a complaint was filed recently by a so-far unidentified employee of the intelligence community. Citing the Trump-Zelensky conversation that he or she did not hear or even read in transcript form, the employee nevertheless filed a whistleblower complaint against the president based on nothing more than hearsay.\n\nThe complaint was legal folly. It does not qualify as a whistleblower complaint as defined by the whistleblower statute (50 U.S.C. 3003). Why? Because a whistleblower cannot blow the whistle on the president.\n\nThis means that he or she is not really a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d at all under the specific language and meaning of the law, as I argued in my column last week.\n\nThis was explained in an 11-page opinion by the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) when it issued the follow opinion:\n\n\u201cThe president is not a member of the intelligence community, and his communication with a foreign leader involved no intelligence operation or other activity aimed at collecting or analyzing foreign intelligence.\u201d\n\nUnder the whistleblower statute, both these conditions are required. Yet, neither were met. As a consequence, the complaint \u201cdoes not trigger a reporting obligation\u201d to Congress by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI). This DOJ opinion is also shared by the General Counsel in the Office of the DNI.\n\nPelosi declared that the law is \u201cunequivocal\u201d that the DNI \u201cshall\u201d give Congress the whistleblower complaint. This would be true if the complaint qualified under the whistleblower law, but it does not. Pelosi was incorrect.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe OLC opinion made clear that the complaint \u201cdoes not trigger a reporting obligation\u201d and that the DNI does not have \u201ca statutory obligation to forward the complaint to the intelligence committees.\u201d\n\nIn our constitutional form of government, the president is a unitary executive. He is not in any department or agency. He is not a member of the intelligence community. A \u201cwhistleblower\u201d can only complain about misconduct by someone in the intelligence community.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nActing DNI Joseph Maguire will appear at a public congressional hearing on Thursday. He will surely reiterate all of the above so that Pelosi, who bragged that she is an \u201cauthority\u201d on the law, might understand what the law actually means.\n\nDespite all of this, the speaker and Democrats are determined to pursue their impeachment dreams. Facts and evidence are of little consequence.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM GREGG JARRETT", "description": "The speaker\u2019s pronouncement without first learning the essential facts was a stunning admission of partisan bias.\u00a0All pretense has now been shed.", "authors": ["Gregg Jarrett", "Gregg Jarrett Is A Fox News Legal Analyst", "Commentator", "Formerly Worked As A Defense Attorney", "Adjunct Law Professor.
