I want to point out there\u2019s no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you.\n\nMaking sure that readers don\u2019t make it to the end of a sentence without being told Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter committed no \u201cwrongdoing\u201d in Ukraine has become a mandatory element in Ukrainegate coverage. Almost like a Surgeon General\u2019s warning, the phrase has been jammed into story after news story:\n\nThe Guardian: \u201cNo evidence the younger Biden did anything illegal.\u201d CNBC: \u201cThere is no evidence that Trump or Giuliani has produced which shows that Hunter Biden was engaged in wrongdoing.\u201d Newsweek: \u201cAlthough there is no evidence of illegal wrongdoing by the Bidens in those dealings\u2026\u201d NBC: \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of either Biden.\u201d AP: \u201cThere has been no evidence of wrongdoing by either the vice president or his son\u2026\u201d The New York Times, Los Angeles Times, and other papers also echoed the mantra.\n\nCooper affixed the requisite disclaimer, but still proceeded to go at Biden a bit. He asked him to explain why it wasn\u2019t wrong (Cooper used the phrase \u201cnot okay\u201d) for his son to collect a check from a Ukrainian gas company while Joe Biden was Obama\u2019s \u201cpoint man\u201d in Ukraine:\n\nCOOPER: My question is, if it\u2019s not okay for a president\u2019s family to be involved in foreign businesses, why was it okay for your son when you were vice president?\n\nBiden responded with what might as well be the official slogan of all news organizations on the left and the right dating back to 2015: \u201cWhat we have to do now is focus on Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nHe added he was \u201cproud\u201d of the decision his son made and said he \u201cnever discussed a single thing with my son about anything having to do with Ukraine.\u201d This contradicted Hunter\u2019s account to the New Yorker about his father\u2019s reaction to news he was joining the board of a Ukrainian gas company: \u201cI hope you knew what you\u2019re doing.\u201d\n\nThe exchange highlighted how impeachment and Joe Biden may be a package deal. In a new Rolling Stone feature about Biden, I wrote about the conundrum Biden\u2019s role in the Ukraine story poses:\n\nThe Ukraine story might sink his campaign, but it also may help\u2026 Impeachment does commit Democrats to a strident defense of Biden and his son, even if, or perhaps especially if, there\u2019s a real problem that needs regular PR response.\n\nWe saw in Tuesday\u2019s debate how the impeachment story\u2019s gravity may alter the race in unpredictable ways. In previous clashes, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker blasted Biden for having supported \u201cevery crime bill, major and minor\u201d and \u201cdipping into the Kool-Aid without even knowing the flavor.\u201d\n\nTuesday in Ohio, Booker all but wrapped his arms around Biden, saying it was \u201cso offensive\u201d that he had to defend himself against allegations of corruption. Booker was one of many chasing what former Barack Obama adviser David Axelrod called the \u201cfree applause line\u201d Democrats could get on the debate floor for defending Biden\u2019s honor.\n\nWith candidates circling wagons to protect Biden, Elizabeth Warren for the first time found herself under mass attack, as if she were already the front-runner. In fact Biden remains the clear leader according to national polling averages. I\u2019m convinced pundits think Biden has already slipped because he\u2019s not on Twitter, which to modern reporters is equivalent to non-existence.\n\nOn the coverage front, Biden will have a sizable or even Trumpian advantage in media attention for as long as the impeachment effort goes on. Analyses by the site Media Cloud show Biden has had roughly quadruple the amount of coverage of his next rival, Warren, since the Ukraine story broke. Heavy press exposure tied to Ukraine may end up cutting against Biden, but it fundamentally changes the race either way.\n\nThen there\u2019s money. There have been rumors for weeks of big Democratic donors getting together to fund a Super PAC to defend Biden. Reuters just a few days ago quoted people in his circle saying Biden\u2019s fundraising problems all but necessitate the creation of a Super PAC:\n\nSome of [Biden\u2019s] top backers worry Biden will lack the resources he needs for a sustained conflict\u2026 As distasteful as the idea has become in Democratic circles, a Super PAC may be necessary to battle Trump, some Biden donors told Reuters.\n\nThis would be fortuitous for a Biden campaign that is burning cash. Just before the debate, his team filed report indicating they have less than $9 million left, a shockingly low number compared to rivals like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who have vibrant donor bases and have over $30 million on hand. Biden is behind South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg and even Kamala Harris in terms of bucks in the bank.\n\nIt\u2019s a Catch-22. Democrats can\u2019t pursue impeachment without a rigorous defense of Biden, but defending Biden may require a massive PR campaign in defense of the very brand of institutional payola Trump ran against to such great effect in 2016.\n\nBiden\u2019s defenders all say basically the same thing. Hunter Biden getting a lucrative sinecure from a foreign gas company, after having secured similar positions in the past on the board of Amtrak and with credit card company MBNA, represents a widespread, boring form of corruption, not worth mentioning when we could be talking about the more spectacular bad things Donald Trump does.\n\nThe Atlantic called Hunter Biden\u2019s board seat a \u201ccommon but distasteful practice.\u201d Matt Yglesias in Vox said it was part of a \u201clong and perfectly legal tradition of family members of influential politicians profiting off a vague sense that it\u2019s politically and economically useful to cultivate these connections.\u201d Yglesias called such behavior \u201csleazy,\u201d but like Cooper was careful to avoid the word \u201cwrong.\u201d\n\nIn 2016, voters in both parties groaned when they were told repeatedly there was \u201cno evidence\u201d donations to the Clinton Foundation, or her millions in speech fees from banks, or her husband\u2019s speaking fees (there sure were a lot of things to explain!) influenced her professionally.\n\nVoters this year will surely come to be just as annoyed by the piles of disclaimers about the Bidens. Just because Donald Trump is worse and has an extensive history of personal and financial corruption doesn\u2019t mean the Hunter Biden experience is not corruption.\n\nIt may be soft corruption, and commonplace, but that\u2019s what makes it such a political liability. Similar to Hillary\u2019s speaking fees, it\u2019s an example of the institutional, legal corruption built in to a \u201csystem\u201d that ordinary voters feel is arrayed against them, one that contrives to deliver disproportionate rewards for mere membership in an exclusive club of connections.\n\nIn Donald Trump, voters in 2016 saw a man with no scruples, but who they thought at least killed his own food (even if he too was originally a nepotism case). Trump fans even rewarded him for being clever enough to screw them over by clearing his debts in the public bankruptcy system. He was corrupt, but the subtext of Trump\u2019s campaign was that he was at least open about it. \u201cIf someone screws you, you screw them back,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cPart of the beauty of me is that I\u2019m very rich.\u201d\n\nFirst with Hillary Clinton and now with Biden and Ukraine, Democrats have tied themselves into contortions trying to sell the idea that profiting off political connections is not technically \u201cwrong.\u201d Worse, they don\u2019t seem to get that making sure nobody in newspapers or on TV talks about Hunter Biden without burying the story in semantic excuses makes things worse, because it adds to the perception that this is symbolic of an institutional problem, which even the \u201cvery fake news media\u201d is invested in covering up.\n\nAfter the debate, pundits raced to declare someone other than Biden the winner. Buttigieg spent the night being a humorless, hectoring, superior advocate for non-change, which in pundit-ese meant he was burnishing his credentials for the nomination. CNN conventional wisdom arch-wizard Chris Cillizza listed Buttigieg as his first big winner, while Politico declared Buttigieg\u2019s night a \u201cbreakout performance,\u201d and MSNBC\u2019s Nicole Wallace gushed that Mayor Pete was \u201cchicken soup for my soul.\u201d\n\nOthers seemed to genuinely believe that Amy Klobuchar \u201cshowed up\u201d on behalf of \u201ccentrist-liberal moderation,\u201d despite the fact that the bulk of her performance involved nervous recitation of the old \u201chow are you going to pay for that?\u201d clich\u00e9 that campaign reporters call bold, inspired rhetoric every time they hear it. Despite being told all year how much they would love Amy if they just got to know her witty personality, voters have basically non-responded to her all year, and they aren\u2019t about to change now.\n\nIt\u2019s early yet, but this is beginning to feel a bit like the Republican race of 2015-2016, when the campaign media kept trying to convince themselves that one of the \u201cestablishment lane\u201d candidates had momentum to unseat Donald Trump. Biden is not the villain to reporters Trump was, but he is flawed. It seems like press figures want to defend Biden against Trump\u2019s charges without propelling him to the nomination, but as the debate showed, that may not be possible.", "description": "Music, Film, TV and Political News Coverage", "authors": ["Matt Taibbi", "Contributing Editor", "Matt Taibbi'S Most Recent Stories", "In Democratic Debate", "More Evidence That Ukrainegate Helps Biden", "The Official Democratic Debate Drinking Game Rules", "The Biden Paradox", "View All"], "top_image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Biden.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
