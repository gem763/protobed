Rather than focusing on usual \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d topics like the economy or border security, Trump used over 40 minutes of his stage time to go hard after his adversaries in Congress and the media.\n\nTrump accused the Washington establishment of \u201clooting\u201d and \u201cpillaging\u201d the country while trying to undemocratically nullify the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a struggle for the survival of democracy in America,\u201d he said.\n\nThe rawness flowed out against a backdrop of the House impeachment inquiry that stems from a July phone call Trump made to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, in which he asked Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Although some within the government, including congressional Democrats, have decried the call as asking for foreign interference in a U.S. election, Trump has maintained that he did nothing wrong.\n\n\u201cThe do-nothing Democrat extremists have gone so far to the left that they believe it should not be a crime to cross our border illegally and that it should be a crime to have a totally appropriate, casual, beautiful, accurate phone call with a foreign leader,\u201d Trump said during the Thursday rally. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nHe also repeated unfounded claims that the former vice president worked to nix a Ukrainian investigation into his son when Hunter Biden sat on the board of an energy corporation in the country. (Trump expressed frustration over the media\u2019s reports that the claims have been debunked, saying during the rally: \u201cIt\u2019s not unsubstantiated, you crooked son of a gun. It\u2019s 100 percent true.\u201d) The president\u2019s team has often recited the claims to counter the accusations of fishing for foreign election assistance. Shortly before his father took the stage, Eric Trump led the audience in a chant of \u201cLock him up,\u201d referring to Hunter Biden.\n\nThe president also lobbed personal insults against Joe Biden \u2014 a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination \u2014 that were particularly vicious even for the raucous standards of Trump's rallies.\n\nBiden \u201cwas never considered smart,\u201d the president said. \u201cHe was never considered a good senator. He was only a good vice president because he understood how to kiss Barack Obama\u2019s ass.\u201d The line received riotous applause from the thousands in attendance at the Target Center in downtown Minneapolis.\n\nHe also went after Pelosi, whom he called \u201ceither really stupid, or she\u2019s really lost it, or there\u2019s a certain dishonesty in there in some way.\u201d\n\nAt times, Trump seemed more fed up than riled up in his rhetoric. He railed against the constant scrutiny his administration has been under since taking office. He went after former special counsel Robert Mueller for disrupting his administration by investigating him and his circle over several months. He accused the media of unfairly targeting his people while working in tandem with Democrats.\n\n\u201cThey took people that were full of life and energy and vigor \u2014 we\u2019d just one the greatest campaign in the history of American politics, it\u2019s true \u2014 and they destroyed their lives!\u201d Trump said of the numerous investigations into his administration and campaign.\n\n\u201cThey destroyed people, good people, people that ended up paying far more money in legal fees than they made,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnd the media was behind every single step.\u201d\n\nTrump, who had met with Chinese representatives earlier Thursday to continue ongoing trade negotiations, went so far as to say that \u201cthe U.S.A. is the toughest nation to deal with, because we\u2019re dealing with some very sick and deranged people.\u201d\n\nEven before he took the stage, Trump\u2019s appearance in Minneapolis was bound to be a fiery confrontation. In the lead-up to the rally, he had gotten into a feud with the city\u2019s Democratic mayor, Jacob Frey, who has been a vocal critic of the president. Minneapolis is also represented by Rep. Ilhan Omar, a freshman Democratic congresswoman who has become one of Trump\u2019s favorite punching bags.", "description": "In one of his most vitriolic appearances to date, President Donald Trump on Thursday night railed against the Washington establishment and his other perceived foes as an existential threat to the nation\u2019s democracy.
