You might think that simply wishing your brother a happy birthday would be a pretty innocuous Insta (like really, what could be so wrong about that?), but some people were upset with how \"cold\" the message was while others thought that Will shouldn't wish Harry a happy birthday because Harry and Meghan apparently didn't post for Will's last birthday.\n\nThe hotly debated text read, \"Wishing a very happy birthday to The Duke of Sussex today! \ud83c\udf82\" while the photo is of Harry and Will smiling at each other\u2014see for yourself:\n\nAnd comments from the haters read:\n\nThis message is so cold and not from the heart. It's so sad\n\nHe could've sent a more heartfelt message then this generic one. This is his only little brother.\n\nWell done. Be the bigger brother to the younger spoiled brat who didn't post anything on William's birthday.\n\nCambridge family is classy as always. If I were William I'd ignore Harry's birthday, just like he ignored William's.\n\nSo classy, KP! Proud of you \u2764\ufe0f Even if @sussexroyal doesn't ever post about any of the Cambridges' birthdays out of jealousy\n\nOh, and some people just wanted to make it very clear that they don't like Harry, with comments like:\n\nCan't wait until he goes to Africa and just stay[s] there\n\nI wish I could give it a like, but can't stand Harry!!!!\n\nHarry disgusts me \ud83d\ude37\ud83d\ude37\ud83d\ude37\n\nYeah, I don't know why people couldn't just keep their opinions to themselves, cause all of these comments are super uncalled for. Can everyone please just let Will and Harry live??\n\nYou Might Also Like\n\n\n\n", "description": "I'm so confused.", "authors": ["Alanna Lauren Greco"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/qS2amxTk7HmXjhHVngCyPQ--~B/dz0wO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cosmopolitan_438/54c9b711f232ab53d53c225d4344c561", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
