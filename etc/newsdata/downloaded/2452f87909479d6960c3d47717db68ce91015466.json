He was long considered one of the savviest production chiefs in Hollywood, but cocaine abuse gradually derailed his career.\n\nAD\n\nHe pampered his stars, paid his writers generously and created \u2014 except for rare explosions with temperamental filmmakers \u2014 an atmosphere where the art of moviemaking seemed to matter more than the bottom line. But eventually the profits came.\n\nAD\n\nAs Paramount\u2019s head of worldwide production from 1966 to 1975, he was credited with helping lift the company\u2019s sagging fortunes with a staggering variety of popular and often critical hits.\n\nThey included \u201cThe Odd Couple\u201d (1968), \u201cGoodbye, Columbus\u201d (1969), \u201cTrue Grit\u201d (1969), \u201cLove Story\u201d (1970), \u201cThe Conformist\u201d (1970), \u201cSerpico\u201d (1973), \u201cPaper Moon\u201d (1973), \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d (1974), \u201cDeath Wish\u201d (1974), \u201cThe Longest Yard\u201d (1974) and three celebrated Francis Ford Coppola dramas, \u201cThe Godfather\u201d (1972), \u201cThe Godfather, Part II\u201d (1974) and \u201cThe Conversation\u201d (1974).\n\nAD\n\nMr. Evans and one of his lieutenants, Peter Bart, came to champion directors other studios wouldn\u2019t hire \u2014 and who worked cheaply. Roman Polanski was considered a young wild card from Europe when he was entrusted with the adaptation of Ira Levin\u2019s Gothic novel \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby.\u201d The 1968 film made a movie star of Mia Farrow.\n\nAD\n\nNotable deaths in 2019: Elijah Cummings, Cokie Roberts, Toni Morrison and others we have lost this year share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image John Conyers Jr. | John Conyers Jr., who became the longest-serving African American in Congress, co-founded the Congressional Black Caucus and helped create a national holiday in the name of the Rev.

Read the obituary (Andrew Harnik/For The Washington Post)\n\nHal Ashby had been working mostly as a film editor when Mr. Evans hired him to direct \u201cHarold and Maude\u201d (1971), a dark comedy about a suicidal young man (Bud Cort) and the life-affirming senior citizen and Holocaust survivor he befriends (Ruth Gordon). The film drew a devoted following over the years.\n\n\u201cMy business is gambling,\u201d Mr. Evans once told Esquire. \u201cIt\u2019s the gambling instinct that makes me tick.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nHe often claimed to have no idea what a script was about but maintained that the right combination of talent (such as actor Jack Nicholson, director Polanski, writer Robert Towne) could make for a dazzling success (\u201cChinatown\u201d).\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem with today\u2019s business,\u201d Mr. Evans told the Los Angeles Times in 2002. \u201cIt\u2019s not an art form, it\u2019s a barter form. The studios are run by committees of MBAs, but I\u2019ve never seen an MBA who knows how to make people cry.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n'A good-looking guy'\n\nMr. Evans was a throwback to an earlier age in the movie capital, when the public and private lives of moguls such as Darryl F. Zanuck and Jack Warner could often be as compelling as the movies they made.\n\nAD\n\nAs a young man, Mr. Evans conveyed a sex appeal that won him many female admirers, several of whom happened to be the wives of influential men. Actress Norma Shearer, the widow of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer mogul Irving Thalberg, launched Mr. Evans\u2019s brief but inauspicious career as a movie actor after spotting him poolside in 1956.\n\nHe soon set his mind on becoming a producer \u2014 \u201cthe guy who makes the decisions,\u201d he told the New York Times, \u201cnot the guy who has the decisions made for him.\u201d\n\nYvette Bluhdorn, the French-born wife of industrialist Charles Bluhdorn, smoothed Mr. Evans\u2019s path to running one of her husband\u2019s smaller properties, Paramount Pictures.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gorgeous,\u201d Yvette Bluhdorn was said to have told her husband, according to Peter Biskind\u2019s film history book \u201cEasy Riders, Raging Bulls.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve got to get a good-looking guy, real sexy, to run the studio.\u201d\n\nThus in 1966 Mr. Evans catapulted from obscurity to one of the most powerful jobs in Hollywood. At the time, American cinema was on the verge of an artistic renaissance. Influenced by adventurous European filmmakers such as Jean-Luc Godard, young directors including Coppola, Peter Bogdanovich and William Friedkin shrugged off convention in favor of grittier material and more experimental filmmaking.\n\nMr. Evans managed to both placate the money men at Gulf and Western, who wanted to sell Paramount because of its meager revenue, and impress Hollywood\u2019s rambunctious talent.\n\nAD\n\nMore than the studio, Mr. Evans\u2019s home in Beverly Hills served as his center of operations \u2014 where business leaders cavorted with starlets, Nicholson and Warren Beatty partied, and Henry Kissinger and Dustin Hoffman could be found on the tennis courts.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Evans was married seven times to a succession of models and actresses, including \u201cLove Story\u201d star Ali MacGraw and former Miss America Phyllis George. His fifth marriage, to \u201cDynasty\u201d actress Catherine Oxenberg, was annulled after nine days in 1998. Survivors include a son from his marriage to MacGraw, Josh Evans of Palm Springs, Calif.; a sister; and a grandson.\n\nHis marriages could seem like interruptions to Mr. Evans\u2019s rollicking bachelor life, around which legends grew. It was reported in \u201cEasy Riders, Raging Bulls\u201d that when his housekeeper delivered his breakfast of black coffee and cheesecake in the morning, she included a note under a plate with the name of the woman sharing his bed, in case his memory needed jogging.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Evans struggled with cocaine addiction for many years and drew headlines when Coppola\u2019s 1984 film \u201cThe Cotton Club,\u201d which Mr. Evans produced, was linked to a real-life kidnapping and murder case.\n\nAD\n\nThe ensuing court proceedings left Mr. Evans a Hollywood pariah. He returned to favor as the grand old man of the entertainment colony when his 1994 memoir, \u201cThe Kid Stays in the Picture,\u201d became a bestseller. A documentary film, narrated by Mr. Evans, followed in 2002.\n\nCapitalizing on the attention, Comedy Central aired a short-lived animated series based on Mr. Evans\u2019s life. It was called \u201cKid Notorious.\u201d In the cartoon, as in life, Mr. Evans had his English-accented butler, a starlet in his bed and an air of cheerful decadence.\n\nAD\n\nUndistinguished actor\n\nRobert J. Shapera \u2014 the J \u201cstanding for nothing I knew of,\u201d he once wrote \u2014 was born in New York on June 29, 1930. He described his father as a frustrated pianist who went to dental school and ran a practice in Harlem. He was 10 when his father changed his children\u2019s last name to Evans, in tribute to their dying paternal grandmother, whose maiden name was Evan.\n\nAD\n\nMr. Evans managed to finish high school while chasing (and catching) Broadway showgirls and, by his 20s, had drifted into modeling menswear. He became a partner and salesman for the women\u2019s clothing line Evan-Picone, which had been co-founded by his brother Charles.\n\nIn 1956, Mr. Evans was in Los Angeles on a sales trip when he was spotted beside the Beverly Hills Hotel\u2019s pool by Shearer, who thought the young sunbather resembled her late husband. As it happened, MGM needed someone to play Thalberg in the Lon Chaney biopic \u201cMan of a Thousand Faces.\u201d\n\nMr. Evans got the part, but his acting career was brief and forgettable. During filming of the 1957 adaptation of Ernest Hemingway\u2019s \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d nearly everyone involved rebelled at the casting of Mr. Evans as Mexican bullfighter Pedro Romero.\n\nAD\n\nBut in a display of power that impressed Mr. Evans \u2014 and which he used for the title of his memoir \u2014 Zanuck, the Twentieth Century Fox studio chief, told the crew, \u201cThe kid stays in the picture.\u201d\n\nBy 1962, flush with cash from the sale of Evan-Picone to Revlon, Mr. Evans tried to make the leap to producer. One of his methods was to buy the screen rights to books before they were published; when they became bestsellers, Mr. Evans traded the rights for a chance to produce.\n\nA New York Times profile of Mr. Evans by Peter Bart soon caught the attention of Charles Bluhdorn. It wasn\u2019t long before Mr. Evans was running Paramount with his new friend and confidant, Bart, as his right-hand man.\n\nMaudlin love and mobsters\n\nLike all the studios, Paramount was at once stuck in the past \u2014 as symbolized by the musical \u201cPaint Your Wagon,\u201d a costly musical that tanked in 1969 \u2014 and trying to read the counterculture moment symbolized by the biker film \u201cEasy Rider\u201d (released the same year). And yet what saved the studio, and Mr. Evans, was a script that had been rejected all over town.\n\n\u201cLove Story,\u201d a sappy melodrama written by Yale University classics professor Erich Segal, was the story of the doomed romance between two Ivy League lovers, a rich jock named Oliver Barrett IV and a working-class intellectual named Jennifer Cavilleri.\n\nMr. Evans threw himself into the making of the film, rejecting several scores before getting Francis Lai to pen the film\u2019s Oscar-winning theme song. \u201cLove Story,\u201d which starred MacGraw and Ryan O\u2019Neal, shocked the Hollywood establishment when it broke box-office records upon its release on Christmas Day 1970.\n\nMr. Evans turned next to \u201cThe Godfather.\u201d Years earlier, for a pittance, he and Bart had optioned an unfinished potboiler called \u201cMafia\u201d by an obscure author named Mario Puzo. Mob movies were not considered big draws, but when Puzo\u2019s novel became a sudden bestseller, \u201cThe Godfather\u201d was poised to become Paramount\u2019s next big hit.\n\nMaking the film was a tumultuous experience for all involved. \u201cFrancis and I had a perfect record; we didn\u2019t agree on anything \u2014 from editing to music to sound,\u201d Mr. Evans later wrote of working with Coppola.\n\n\u201cThe Godfather\u201d (1972) and its sequel, \u201cThe Godfather: Part II\u201d (1974), won multiple Oscars, helped launch the careers of Al Pacino, Diane Keaton and James Caan, and resurrected the mob movie genre.\n\nCollapse and return\n\n\u201cThe Godfather\u201d was a commercial and artistic triumph but coincided with the disintegration of his marriage to MacGraw, who left him for actor Steve McQueen.\n\nMr. Evans also was growing increasingly restive as an employee of the studio; he wanted to own a stake in his films. He got his chance by producing the 1974 L.A. noir \u201cChinatown.\u201d\n\nBut after \u201cChinatown,\u201d Bluhdorn brought in Barry Diller to be the studio\u2019s new production chief. Mr. Evans remained on the lot, producing films such as the lauded thriller \u201cMarathon Man\u201d (1976), starring Dustin Hoffman and Laurence Olivier. But other movies he produced \u2014 including \u201cBlack Sunday\u201d (1977), about a terrorist attack at the Super Bowl, and Robert Altman\u2019s live-action \u201cPopeye\u201d (1980) \u2014 were duds.\n\nIn 1980, Mr. Evans pleaded guilty to cocaine possession; he was sentenced to one year\u2019s probation. Worse trouble came when he met a 33-year-old road show promoter named Roy Radin, who became an investor in \u201cThe Cotton Club.\u201d\n\nDirected by Coppola and set at a Harlem jazz club in the 1930s, \u201cThe Cotton Club\u201d was widely panned. By that time, Radin had been found dead in a dry creek bed off a highway northwest of Los Angeles. He had been shot 13 times.\n\nUltimately, four people were convicted in Radin\u2019s death, including Karen \u201cLanie\u201d Greenberger, a former drug dealer and girlfriend of Mr. Evans who had introduced Radin to the producer. The impression that Mr. Evans was orbiting an underworld of drugs and murder-for-hire made him a persona non grata for years.\n\nEventually, Mr. Evans returned to Paramount. The movies he produced \u2014 including \u201cSliver\u201d (1993), \u201cThe Saint\u201d (1997) and \u201cHow to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\u201d (2003) \u2014 were on a far more modest scale than his earlier work, but he remained full of the bravado that defined his heyday.", "description": "As a Paramount Pictures executive, he presided over a remarkable range of hits \u2014 notably \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d \u201cChinatown,\u201d \u201cRosemary\u2019s Baby\u201d and \u201cLove Story.\u201d", "authors": ["Paul Brownfield"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/tBmRZ7-iooLkJZP5kiTZvqFYnpg=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/YVLKLAHZVMI6TCIGVNVWBXUREQ.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
