The prism of a formal interview provides partial answers but, after a summer that will be forever associated both with that Super Over and then his attempt to bounce England back into a memorable Ashes series, this past weekend in Arundel delivered a genuinely revealing insight.\n\nCricket Field Road, the quaint home to Horsham Sports Club, was where Archer arrived when he came to England from Barbados in 2016 and it was also where he returned - complete with the ICC\u2019s World Cup trophy - at the end of a life-changing summer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always nice to come back - I come back when I am on a break as well,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m always here. Probably everyone here was supporting me through the summer. They gave me the opportunity. It is fitting to come back.\u201d\n\nSome of the stories have since gone into local club cricket folklore. There was the time, at Roffey, when he hit a six through a nearby bedroom window and then there is also the memory of the club\u2019s wicket-keeper having to take up positions some 22 yards from the wicket (roughly halfway to the boundary) whenever Archer was bowling.\n\nDuring a question and answer session with the club\u2019s members, Archer also did not hesitate when asked who he would most like to be on the receiving end of his first 100 mph delivery. David Warner, Steve Smith or Matthew Wade perhaps? No. \u201cSean Overton,\u201d he said, peering out into the audience at the club cricketer with whom he was travelling to a five-a-side football game when he got the call to say he had been selected for the second Ashes Test.\n\nWhat was also most striking both in the Q and A, and then during an interview, was the sense that winning the World Cup and then starring in such an iconic Ashes series was just the start of an international career that will contain plenty of comparable highlights.", "description": "So just what makes Jofra Archer tick?", "authors": ["Jeremy Wilson", "Chief Sports Reporter", "Michael Vaughan"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/cricket/2019/10/13/TELEMMGLPICT000212248839-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqvf93cyop1gpr4w56dB_PHDlaTMTxUhlzF8Rkw038U-A.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
