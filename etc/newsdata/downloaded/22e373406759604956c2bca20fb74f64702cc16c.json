She said no. And then they said, what about e-cigarettes? And she said yes,\" Ruby said.\n\nPiper was diagnosed with Colorado's first case of a vaping-related illness that has now sickened hundreds of people nationwide. The college freshman had been vaping for more than two years.\n\nPiper Johnson CBS News\n\n\"We're parents who are mad that these things are out there, and we're mad that they're easily accessible,\" Ruby said.\n\nJuul, the top-selling e-cigarette company in the U.S., is often blamed for the surge in youth vaping. Last month \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Tony Dokoupil asked Juul CEO Kevin Burns if he felt Juul was responsible.\n\n\"Well, some people could have used our product,\" Burns replied, \"but there's never an intent on the company's part to target youth to grow our business. That's been the assertion.\"\n\nRuby Johnson said, \"Targeting a younger audience happened. And then when Juul was called on it they went, 'Oh sorry, we didn't mean to do that.'\"\n\nPiper Johnson has recovered, and says she will never vape again. \"It's not worth it. It is not worth the risk, and worth seeing your parents cry as you are in a hospital bed,\" she said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging people to consider stopping vaping, as it investigates a fifth death potentially linked to e-cigarettes.\n\nThe number of cases of severe lung illness possibly caused by vaping has surged to more than 450 in 33 states. Investigators say many of the cases involve vaping products that include the primary ingredient of marijuana, THC.\n\nOn \"CBS This Morning\" Monday, CBS News medical contributor Dr. Tara Narula was asked what people who vape should know about the symptoms.\n\n\"Some of the early signs would be shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain,\" Narula said. \"Certainly the shortness of breath, if it starts to get worse over several hours or becomes more severe, you need to seek medical attention. Some people have reported the symptoms getting worse over days, some getting worse over weeks. We know that now possibly five deaths, all adults \u2014 although many of these cases, again, are young people.\n\n\"One of the screaming questions is, where was the FDA? Where were the regulators?\" asked co-host Tony Dokoupil.\n\n\"It's a very complicated issue,\" said Narula. \"Essentially the FDA got jurisdiction to regulate electronic nicotine delivery devices back in 2016. But they set a timeline until 2022 \u2014 that was going to be the date when they would review. That timeline has gotten pushed up now to May of 2020. Many people are saying this is too little, too late.\"", "description": "The college freshman, who'd been vaping for more than two years, vows she will never vape again after ending up in the ICU", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/09/f0549d35-65fe-4576-9805-8c490d917c09/thumbnail/1200x630g2/e25fc75bc77a7f57b55c2a06bb7d4d8b/piper-johnson-interview.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
