The pack aims to make people ask questions like \u2013 Am I saving enough? Do I understand the different ways to use my pension? Should I seek guidance or advice about how I can do that?'\n\nHow much do you need for a comfortable retirement? By setting out the income needed for a retirement lifestyle, the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association hopes to encourage us to put more money aside The pension industry last week produced an in-depth guide to how much our spending habits and favourite brands will cost in retirement. By setting out the income needed for a retirement lifestyle, the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association hopes to encourage us to put more money aside. The study, by Loughborough University, details everything from the brand of baked beans we might buy to the quality of wine and beer we\u2019ll be drinking. The \u2018retirement living standards\u2019 aim to give savers a picture of the kind of lifestyle they might have on a minimum, a moderate, or a comfortable income. It said that people could think on an individual basis in terms of \u00a310,000, \u00a320,000, \u00a330,000 a year for the three standards, but highlighted how life is cheaper for couples. > Read: Want a comfy retirement? Here's what you need\n\nGreer says the FCA has set out strict guidelines on what needs to be included, to ensure the packs will be succinct and hopefully mean more people will read them.\n\nHe adds that customer testing of the packs by Quilter showed most people didn\u2019t really understand their pension before engaging with the pack, but the new format was working.\n\n'After reading the pack they had learned: that a personal pension didn\u2019t give them a set income; they could get guidance from Pension Wise; they could shop around; there are pension scams out there.'\n\nJonathan Watts-Lay, director of workplace education provider WEALTH at work, says: 'Currently pension \u2018wake up packs\u2019 are provided to customers when they are due to retire.\n\n'They tend to be large, often confusing documents, which are sent out to customers four to six months before their intended retirement date, but the rules are changing.\n\n'From 1 November 2019 pension providers have been told they have to significantly reduce the size of the packs, and increase the frequency.\n\n'From this date, they must be sent out once the individual reaches the age of 50, and then every five years after that until the pension is fully cashed in.\n\n'They will also need to be sent just before someone retires, whenever they request a retirement quote, and any time they take money out of their pension, with no more than five years between each pack, until the pension pot is empty.'\n\nKay Ingram, director of public policy at financial adviser group LEBC, says the packs are designed to prompt 50-year olds to start thinking about their retirement plans.\n\nShe suggest people receiving them check and consider the following:\n\n1) Income forecasts: 'These figures are shown after adjusting for the effects of inflation; this makes sense because the cost of things today is likely to be greater in the future.\n\n'Actual costs of living may of course be higher or lower than this estimate.\n\n'The problem with inflation adjusted figures is that they can make retirement funding look like an impossible dream. It is important not to be disheartened but to start setting positive goals for the lifestyle you have in mind.'\n\n'Some items of expenditure like travel to work will disappear, but other costs \u2013 utilities in the home and leisure spending for example \u2013 may increase.'\n\n2) When you can afford to retire: 'The age shown for the retirement date is not usually fixed. Once over the age of 55, the plan owner can access their pension at any age with most personal pensions and is not obliged to stick with the age originally chosen.\n\n'Those in severe ill health may be able to access their pension sooner.\n\n'Pension plans must no longer be cashed by the age of 75, so timing is usually a matter of personal choice. Pension pots can be drawn at different times to ease you into gradual retirement.\n\n'The exception to this rule is that some pensions may offer a guaranteed fund value or income at a given age. This is most likely if the plan was set up in the 1980s or 90s.'\n\n3) Investment choices: 'The pack should state the fund(s) in which the savings are invested. Savers need to consider if this is likely to meet their needs, relative to the risk being taken, and how that measures up against their intended retirement timings.\n\nHow higher charges can eat up your pension savings Investors are often told of the wonders compounded returns will work on their savings over the years, but not the damage compounded fees will be wreaking at the same time. Read more here about how fees can deplete your wealth if you don't keep costs down.\n\n'Many pension plans offer a default fund where the risk reduces as the retirement age nears. If that timing is now later, the default reduction in risk could lead to lower performance, or if sooner, to the fund being exposed to too much risk.\n\n'It could also be a fund which was doing well when the plan started but has now fallen from favour. Most plans allow you to change the fund and offer a wide selection of alternatives. If no other suitable fund is available, then the pension pot can usually be moved to another provider.\n\n4) Charges: 'The pack will show the effect of charges on fund performance. Older plans may have higher charges than more modern contracts, so money could be saved by switching to a new plan.\n\n'Charges on plans with companies which no longer market pension plans tend to be the most expensive. Unless there are guarantees which outweigh high charges or penalties for switching, moving to a lower cost contract can mean keeping more of the fund to provide pension income. With some years to go those savings will add up.", "description": "Before now, pension firms have only had to send such packs to people in the six-month run-up to retirement, but regulators decided this was too late and ordered an overhaul.", "authors": ["Tanya Jefferies For Thisismoney.Co.Uk", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
