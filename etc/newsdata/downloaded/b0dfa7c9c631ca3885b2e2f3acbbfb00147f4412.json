These 311 deportees are only a tiny trickle of the vast flood of Indians who illegally, and often unsuccessfully, attempt to enter the US, or other countries, where they believe they\u2019ll have a brighter future.\n\nEven as the current government talks about India being within sight of becoming a five trillion dollar economy, millions of Indians seek to escape the imprisonment of poverty in the country of their birth and seek freedom from economic oppression in a foreign country, and under foreign rule.\n\nIndia threw off the galling yoke of British rule 72 years ago. But it seems it still has to free itself from the shackles of deprivation and despair in which the sins of omission and commission of successive regimes have fettered only too many of its supposedly free citizens. A bitter truth to which the 311 deportees bear tragic witness.", "description": "In a shameful indictment of 72 years of misgovernance since the country gained Independence from colonial raj 311 Indian nationals have been deported from Mexico where they smuggled themselves in a desperate attempt to enter...", "authors": ["Jug Suraiya"], "top_image": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/jug.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
