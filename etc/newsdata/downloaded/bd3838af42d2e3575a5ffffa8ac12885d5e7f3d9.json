In fact, it\u2019s been my major work on the committee and subcommittee it\u2019s been essentially in your sector. I am, I\u2019m simply candidly calling to ask for a contribution.\u201d\n\nWhile it might sound like the congresswoman is asking for a bribe, she\u2019s not. Because, \u201cBAWK, no quid pro quo!\u201d She\u2019s asking for a payoff for work that she\u2019s already accomplished and not offering to trade money for any future official action.\n\nThe Latin phrase simply means an exchange of something for something. That phrase defines the very thin line that exists between a bribe and a campaign contribution, so it easily flies to the lips of those working in an industry turning power into cash.\n\nThe farce posing as the Ukraine theory of impeachment provides that Donald Trump engaged in a corrupt quid pro quo by holding up military aid in order to gain opposition research against his political opponent. In the minds of his accusers, opposition research should be a commodity you buy. Clinton, for example, paid good money for the Fusion GPS dossier that falsely accused candidate Trump of being a Russian asset colluding to subvert the 2016 presidential election. True or not, the dossier was expensive and just as valuable as folding cash in the hands of a campaign official buying television spots for negative political ads.\n\nThe holy grail for the Democrats seeking a permanent majority is a system of election law that criminalizes anything that might have the effect of helping a Republican win. In reaching this goal, the Democrats, on several fronts, have attempted to characterize the mere sharing of information as a political expenditure. Thus, even a factual bit of dirt uncovered in the ordinary operation of government, if it goes against Joe Biden, can be regulated as a \u201ccampaign contribution\u201d that must be reported and can never come from a foreign source.\n\nIf that argument succeeds in gaining ground, the implications would be staggering. Anytime a third party passes on a piece of gossip or dirt to a campaign, bureaucrats could fire up a prosecution against both the campaign and the gossiper on the grounds that the \u201cinformation\u201d is a thing of value. Mind you, this interpretation will only be used against Republicans, as the Democrats appear totally immune to criticism on the same principle.\n\nFortunately, information merely passed along is not considered \u201ca thing of value\u201d for purposes of election law. The Washington Post published a thoughtful analysis explaining why. So let\u2019s return to the question, is there anything wrong with the president of the United States asking the president of Ukraine to cooperate in an investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden and/or the origins of the Russian collusion hoax?\n\nThe answer to that question lies in another question: Is it a matter of legitimate public interest whether Vice President Joe Biden sought the firing of the Ukrainian prosecutor in order to benefit the company for which his son worked? Did Biden engage in a \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d i.e., protecting Burisma in exchange for his son\u2019s outsized salary for board membership? That seems like a question of vital public interest. And the interest of the public in that question shouldn\u2019t change depending on the political allegiance of the people involved.\n\nDoes the fact that Biden is also a potential political opponent of Donald Trump confer some kind of immunity from scrutiny? It certainly didn\u2019t when the Obama Administration used the same January 2016 meeting to pressure Ukraine to end an investigation into the Bidens and launch an investigation into Trump\u2019s campaign chairman, Paul Manafort.\n\nAlso, as noted by John Solomon, Ukraine produced a forged ledger that falsified evidence of corrupt actions by Manafort. The story of the ledger was then leaked and reported by the press in a successful effort to embarrass candidate Trump and drive a wedge between him and Manafort. The forgery thus had a tangible impact on the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Ultimately, the ledger was so obviously faked that Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team discarded it during Manafort\u2019s trial.\n\nAttorney General Bill Barr has launched an investigation into the Russia collusion hoax and the phony Manfort ledger is a relevant topic. Barr did not approach Ukraine directly but instead, per protocol, requested an introduction and sponsorship by the president of the United States to all foreign leaders from whom Barr might want help. The phone call between Trump and the president of Ukraine was simply that\u2014a heads-up to the Ukrainian president of the investigation and a request to cooperate.\n\nThe true purpose of the impeachment inquiry is to protect the business model of turning power and influence into cash. If the Bidens go down, who knows who might be next? The Democrats are attempting to use the \u201cthing of value\u201d theory of election law to stymie a legitimate inquiry into political corruption. Because asking questions might hurt Biden\u2019s chances in the 2020 election, Trump can\u2019t ask them. Or so the argument goes.\n\nRepublicans wringing their hands over a \u201cquid pro quo,\u201d are buying a false premise: That the Biden-Ukraine shenanigans do not involve legitimate concerns over the corruption of real American interests. We can\u2019t have our leaders using their official diplomatic positions to enrich their families because it distorts and weakens America\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nAlternatively, if the military aid was withheld to ensure cooperation with the investigation into Ukraine\u2019s role in the Russia collusion hoax, this, too, is a legitimate line of inquiry. If that inquiry is legitimate, leveraging the aid to ensure cooperation is also legitimate.\n\nWashington is squealing because the Biden-Ukraine model has been used so often to make the families of \u201cpublic servants\u201d into millionaires. It is \u201cthe way things are done.\u201d But those squeals should be ignored. America deserves an accounting of what happened.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://amgreatness.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/GettyImages-1178901788.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
