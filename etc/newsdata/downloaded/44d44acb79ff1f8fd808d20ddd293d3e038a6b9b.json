In 2019, the dust of the white sneaker craze seems to have settled somewhat, but they\u2019re still our go-to for work, errands, going out, and just about any other time we leave the house. Like a white button-down shirt, a just-right pair of jeans, or a perfectly broken in black T-shirt, white sneakers are timeless. To get some inspiration for our next pair, we reached out to sneakerheads and casual sneaker fans alike to hear about their favorites. They reported back with picks that are minimalist, sporty, and some that even look a little like a piece of sculpture. Read on for all of our cool people\u2019s favorites (and don\u2019t forget to brush up on our guide to cleaning sneakers if you want to keep those whites bright and shiny).\n\nBest sporty white sneakers\n\nAsics Gel-Kinsei OG Another running-sneaker pick comes from Rilka Noel, e-commerce planner at Kith, who says that the Asics Gel-Kinsei OGs are her \u201ccurrent and probably forever\u201d favorites. \u201cI love how comfortable these are, and the classic Asics formstripe gives a nod to the original 2000s silhouette,\u201d Noel says. \u201cThey\u2019re designed for running, but I\u2019ve been wearing them every day for all occasions.\u201d She told us that she\u2019s been into technical/performance sneakers with a retro nostalgia vibe \u2014 like that 2000s silhouette \u2014 for pairing with day-to-night looks, and wears these with ankle socks and dresses, as well as with oversized denim and a silky blouse. \u201cThey\u2019re everything,\u201d she says. $180 at Asics Buy\n\nNike Air Huarache Run Sneakers \u201cI have the Nike Huarache sneakers in all-white and wear them all the time,\u201d says Elizabeth Tamkin, market strategist at Man Repeller. \u201cThe sole has a bit of height, which I like because I\u2019m on the shorter side.\u201d Tamkin also likes that these are unisex, which allows her to \u201cfind sneaker-style inspiration from literally anybody in the world.\u201d She pairs the Huaraches with girly dresses (once with a velvet Rhode Resort dress) and tracksuits alike. From $115 at Amazon Buy From $115 at Amazon Buy\n\nNike Air Force 1 07 SE \u201cI grew up in a sports-fanatic family; always playing, watching, talking about sports and sports culture,\u201d says Michelle Silva, co-founder of the Con.cept. When it comes to sneakers for Silva, she tells us, \u201cComfort is the way to go. You can\u2019t move slow on these New York streets, or waste time in uncomfortable shoes.\u201d And while she says she chooses her sneakers based on her mood and whatever is inspiring her that day, her go-to pair is a classic Air Force 1. \u201cTheir versatility makes it a staple piece in my closet,\u201d Silva says. \u201cAlways keep a clean pair in your closet.\u201d $90 at Nike Buy\n\nNike Air Force 1 Jester XX For a new spin on the classic, Madison Hartman, social director at sneaker and streetwear retailer Stadium Goods, says her pick is the Nike Air Force 1 Jester XX. The pair was part of the brand\u2019s \u201cReimagined\u201d collection, which was designed by a team of fourteen women at Nike. The shoes are \u201ctweaked just enough to stand out,\u201d says Hartman, who points to the elevated heel, tag on the outside, and the askew Nike swoosh and back heel logo as the details that set the Jester XX apart from classic Air Force 1s. \u201cI would pair them with either a dark-wash jean or a pair of plaid pants,\u201d she says. $110 at Nordstrom Buy\n\nBest high-top white sneakers\n\nConverse Chuck Taylor Monochrome High-Top Artist Shantell Martin told us that while she\u2019s a bit biased after designing her own line of sneakers for Puma, she still turns to Converse for her \u201cstaple go-to sneaker\u201d: A pair of canvas monochrome Chuck Taylor high-tops. \u201cThey\u2019re easy to travel with, super comfy, and the perfect work sneakers for when I\u2019m doing big jobs outside.\u201d (Converse high tops are a favorite of many a Strategist editor and writer, as well.) $55 at Zappos Buy\n\nVans Sk8-Hi Core Classics \u201cThese sneakers have been by my side since my freshman year of high school\u2014 I haven\u2019t grown at all, ha,\u201d artist Camille Lanham says of her Vans Sk8-Hi. \u201cWhat I love most about them is they\u2019ve never failed me with any outfit I\u2019ve tried on.\u201d Lanham also notes that no matter how dirty these get, there\u2019s \u201cnothing a little bleach can\u2019t do.\u201d And if you\u2019re wondering what kind of bleach to try, we again direct you to our guide on how to clean sneakers, according to experts. $65 at Zappos Buy\n\nPhoto: Reid, Hilary Converse Chuck 70 Hi \u201cChinatown Market - UV\u201d \u201cI love a white sneaker for fall because they\u2019re decadent and defiantly alive,\u201d says Minya Oh a.k.a. radio personality Miss Info, who is also the style director for Stadium Goods. Speaking of lively sneakers, Oh\u2019s pick offers a surprising take on the white-sneaker trend. \u201cI love these stark white Chuck high tops that Converse made with one of my favorite indie streetwear lines, Chinatown Market,\u201d she says. \u201cThey look clinical and basic at first, but the specially treated canvas actually reacts to UV light and turns different shades of pink and purple when you go outside,\u201d adds Oh, who notes that they\u2019re a great conversation starter, too. From $195 at Stadium Goods Buy\n\nBest low-top white sneakers\n\nConverse Chuck Taylor All Star Low Top \u201cThere\u2019s something inherently cool, nostalgic, and rebellious about Converse,\u201d Jenny Walton, illustrator and fashion director for the Sartorialist told us. Walton says she started wearing black low-top Chuck Taylors in middle school: \u201cI thought I was cool, and that they made me seem a little punk-rockish. Me and my friends would write notes on them when we were bored in school.\u201d She switched to white Converse in the past few years \u2014 \u201cstill low-tops; I think I\u2019m too short to pull off high-tops\u201d \u2014 but says that it\u2019s not a bad idea to also pick up a pair of black Converse to help get you through the worst of New York\u2019s weather. $53 at Amazon Buy $53 at Amazon Buy\n\nVeja V-10 Low-Top Sneakers Michelle Li, fashion and beauty editor at Teen Vogue, chose Veja Low-Tops as her favorite (they happen to be a favorite in the New York magazine offices, as well). \u201cI really love the brand behind these sneakers \u2014 they\u2019re transparent and ethical with their sourcing, and their shoes are still affordable,\u201d says Li. \u201cThis shoe feels special to me because the design feels streamlined, but still classic.\u201d Li praises the shoes\u2019 balance between a \u201cchunky feel\u201d and something more \u201cmodern,\u201d and their detailing, like the mesh toes. \u201cI also love gum soles on white shoes, so this is my supernova white shoe,\u201d she says. $150 at Zappos Buy\n\nSuperga 2750 Canvas Cotu Sneakers \u201cUnless I\u2019m getting dolled up, I always opt for simple sneakers,\u201d says model and photographer Louise Parker. \u201cMy favorite sneakers are white Converse High Tops and white Supergas. When I know I\u2019m going to be walking a lot, I\u2019ll wear my Supergas because they have a bit more support.\u201d Parker told us that she also likes these because they look like \u201ccute tennis shoes.\u201d Superga Cotus are also a favorite of former Strategist writer and current Self magazine editor Lori Keong. From $70 at Amazon Buy From $70 at Amazon Buy\n\nFeiyue Fe Lo Classic White Sneakers \u201cThese are OG Feiyue sneakers from China \u2014 have to represent my culture!\u201d says Joanna Fu, associate editor at Hypebeast. \u201cThey\u2019re the most comfortable shoes I own and genuinely stay true to the original 1920s retro look and branding \u2014 white canvas upper, yellow gum outsole, and a really nice vintage red-and-blue logo.\u201d The shoes have a cult following and Fu says they\u2019re the flagship shoes for monks and martial artists. \u201cThe original versions cost around $100 HKD, about $13 USD, which is what you\u2019d expect to pay for one drink in Manhattan,\u201d she tells us. Fu prefers her white sneakers broken-in: \u201cI really can\u2019t stand brand-new, crisp white sneakers. To me, beaten-up white sneakers are the best because they show some personality and stay true to the idea that sneakers are casual shoes that should be worn.\u201d From $27 at Amazon Buy From $27 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest platform white sneakers\n\nSkechers Shape Ups Photographer and actress Sasha Frolova often wears Adidas, but says her true sneakers of choice are Skechers Shape Ups. \u201c I didn\u2019t purchase them for their toning qualities, but they are truly a gift that keeps on giving,\u201d Frolova tells us. \u201cMy chiropractor said my core was unusually strong.\u201d The sneakers have a round bottom that gives an extra spring to your step, which, according to Frolova \u201creally makes you want to hop around like a jelly bean.\u201d $65 at Amazon Buy $65 at Amazon Buy\n\nBest minimalist white sneakers\n\nFrye Ivy Sneakers For a minimalist take on the trend (and a pair that might be confused with much more expensive Common Projects) Frye\u2019s Ivy Sneakers are a good option. Blogger Soraya, of Soul of Soraya, says that she loves her Frye Ivy sneakers because of their \u201cversatility and perfect fit.\u201d She also praises the quality leather, and calls them a \u201cclassic essential\u201d in her wardrobe. \u201cI like that they are so comfortable and go with everything, from a good denim look and cute outerwear in winter to a full summer look, and even with a dress,\u201d she says. $139 at Amazon Buy $139 at Amazon Buy\n\nWomen\u2019s Hand-Sewn Low \u201cAs a stylist, I am on my feet most of the day, so wearing sneakers is usually a must for me,\u201d says stylist and fashion consultant Lara Backmender, who identifies as \u201ca bit of a sporty tomboy.\u201d She rotates between a few pairs, but called out Feit as a favorite. \u201cI love that they are a comfortable, chicer version of a sneaker, so I feel a bit more dressed up,\u201d Backmender says. As for the high price, she tells us the shoes are completely handmade with beautiful leather. \u201cNot only are they very special but I feel special in them.\u201d $600 at FEIT Buy\n\nBest fashion white sneakers\n\nReebok by Pyer Moss Off-White & White Modius Experiment Sneakers Jeon also told us about these Reebok by Pyer Moss sneakers, which she says are her other favorite all-white pair at the moment. \u201cThis sneaker is like sculpture,\u201d she says. \u201cThe design is like a complete reconceptualization of what we think of as a classic basketball sneaker, and there are little details in the most unexpected places on the shoe that make it feel really personal.\u201d They\u2019re a guaranteed head-turner, too. \u201cWithout fail, I get compliments every single time I wear this shoe,\u201d Jeon says. $300 at SSENSE Buy\n\n\u201cYeezy is basically the Farrow and Ball of sneakers,\u201d says Oh. \u201c The Kanye x Adidas line brings nuances to the color white that you never even knew you needed. But you kinda do.\u201d Oh sometimes opts for the sleek original Yeezy Boost 350s, but if she wants a chunky dad-style shoe she\u2019ll go for the Yeezy Boost 500s \u2014 and the white colorways get pretty granular, \u201cfrom purist \u2018Triple White,\u2019 icy \u2018Cloud White,\u2019 vintage \u2018Bone White,\u2019 or even tahini-colored \u2018Desert Rat,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cLiterally, a white sneaker for every mood.\u201c\n\nget the strategist newsletter Actually good deals, smart shopping advice, and exclusive discounts.
