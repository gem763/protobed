The students were \"denied admission to the U.S. to continue their studies\" and were sent back to China, ASU said.\n\n\"We are working as quickly as possible to coordinate with the federal government to understand the circumstances surrounding these actions and to rectify the situation,\" ASU said.\n\nRelated Video: Chinese Victim\u2019s Family Distraught Over Loss\n\nASU said it has not been able to get answers on why the students were detained and sent back. When contacted by The Arizona Republic, customs officials responded that it was after regular business hours, so they couldn't immediately comment.\n\nDespite returning to China, they're still enrolled at ASU, working through ASU Online, an ASU official said. The university expects some of the detained students to graduate this semester, the official said.\n\nCollege costs: For undocumented Arizona high school grad, Yale is more affordable than ASU\n\nThe detentions come amid an increasingly tense relationship between the U.S. and China. But problems for international students aren't just affecting Chinese students at U.S. universities.\n\nNews outlets have reported delays and problems with visas for international students from other countries under the Trump administration. The New York Times reported students from various countries were facing issues with visas.\n\nEarlier this week, the Harvard Crimson reported a Palestinian student was detained by Customs and Border Protection and sent home to Lebanon. In that instance, the student claims customs officials found posts from people that included political views that opposed the U.S. on his friends' list.\n\nThe posts were not from the student himself, the student told the Crimson.\n\nASU also had to close its Confucius Institute, which was funded by the Chinese government, to continue receiving funds from the Department of Defense for a language program.\n\nStudents' electronics were searched\n\nThe university said in a statement Friday that the detentions weren't based on academic dishonesty issues, despite a media report to the contrary. Customs officials haven't told ASU it was related to academic dishonesty, the university said.\n\n\"In fact CBP has given ASU no information on what has transpired,\" the university said.\n\nIf there were an academic dishonesty issue, that's the purview of ASU, not customs officials, ASU said.\n\n\"All of the students caught in this situation were academically eligible to return to ASU and to the United States under their visas,\" ASU said.\n\nThe detention happened as students were returning to the country for the fall semester.\n\nSince then, ASU has reached out to \"all levels of federal government,\" the university said. ASU President Michael Crow sent letters to Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and acting Secretary of Homeland Security Kevin McAleenan.\n\n\"In each case, the students were in possession of all needed documentation to enter the U.S. yet they were refused entry at the airport, told they needed to return to China, that they needed to pay for their own airline ticket to do so or face a ban from re-entering the U.S. for five years,\" Crow wrote to the federal officials.\n\nCrow wants a review of the individual situations for the nine students and a review of the procedures that now include searching electronic devices carried by students who enter the U.S.\n\n\"In our country, where we value due process and celebrate the different ways in which our government behaves from that of the arbitrary and capricious behavior of other nations, it is beyond my comprehension how the U.S. government could establish and implement policies that bring about the outcomes we are now witnessing,\" Crow wrote.\n\nIn a statement issued earlier Friday to ABC15, Customs and Border Protection noted there are many categories that applicants for admission to the country have to meet in order to enter.\n\n\"The Chinese students were deemed inadmissible to the United States based on information discovered during the CBP inspection,\" the CBP statement said.\n\nFollow Rachel Leingang on Twitter: @rachelleingang\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Arizona State students from China detained at LAX, denied entry to US\n\n\n\n", "description": "The students were \"denied admission to the U.S. to continue their studies\" and were sent back to China, ASU said.", "authors": ["Rachel Leingang", "Arizona Republic"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AEQJvQkm0C9MvEqApbSINg--~B/aD0xMzAxO3c9MTgwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/95d5755f51712b69ff5894bbe31d87f7"}
