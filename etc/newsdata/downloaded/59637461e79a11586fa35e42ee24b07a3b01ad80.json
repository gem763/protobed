There is a plan that we will have to set out for the World Cup, to make sure we can handle those wet balls,\u201d said Kolbe.\n\n\u201cWe just have to adapt as quickly as possible to whatever weather conditions come our way.\u201d", "description": "The widely touted kicking strategy to test opposition back lines with a slippery ball in humid conditions could play into South Africa's hands at the Rugby World Cup in Japan, Springboks winger Cheslin Kolbe said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431231839&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H0XW-OZASP", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
