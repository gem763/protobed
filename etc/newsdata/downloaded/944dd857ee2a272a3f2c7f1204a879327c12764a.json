It does not single out Amazon, despite the presidential attacks that led up to the creation of the task force.\n\nThe other side: \"It\u2019s very concerning, and if implemented it would be tremendously damaging to the Postal Service\u2019s bottom line and more importantly to consumers and businesses large and small across America,\" said John McHugh, a former congressman who works at law firm K&L Gates and leads the Package Coalition, whose members include Amazon, Express Scripts and the National Retail Federation.\n\nThe big picture: The Postal Service report comes as Amazon's continued dominance ignites pushback on multiple fronts.\n\nAmazon is in the middle of two antitrust investigations in Europe. One, led by the EU's top regulator, looks at the e-commerce giant's data-driven advantage over other sellers on its platform. Germany's Federal Cartel Office launched a separate probe into monopolistic practices last week.\n\nAmazon's high-profile search for a second headquarters \u2014 which enticed up-and-coming cities all over the country only to settle on the D.C. area and New York, two of the richest places in the world \u2014 thrust Amazon into a sometimes critical spotlight.\n\nOn Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Amazon posted record-breaking sales, but the big shopping days were punctuated by worker-led protests against the behemoth's warehouse working conditions.\n\nYes, but: Consumers still, by and large, feel good about Amazon. A recent poll from the Baker Center at Georgetown University found that there's only one institution in which Americans have more confidence than Amazon: the military.\n\nThe report undercut Trump's claims that Amazon deliveries are a massive drain on the Postal Service, instead finding increased package volume hadn't made up for other shortfalls in revenue.\n\nWhat's next? While the administration says that postal regulators can make many of its recommended changes, expect lawmakers to get involved.\n\n\"I appreciate Secretary Mnuchin and the Postal Task Force\u2019s effort to accurately assess the Postal Service\u2019s financial reality and propose viable solutions without relying on a taxpayer bailout,\" said Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson.\n\n\"I look forward to working with the secretary and his department to put the Postal Service on a long-term, sustainable path,\" he said.\n\nGo deeper: For Amazon, success breeds enemies", "description": "Amazon finds itself in a politically perilous moment.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://images.axios.com/GV0w7NYWRAm-Fy1I9-h6Mnf5sV8=/0x418:4500x2949/1920x1080/2018/12/05/1543968089375.jpg", "published_at": "2018-12-05"}
