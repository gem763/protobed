I cannot believe this result. I am so happy.\u201d Few expected Johnson-Thompson to beat Nafi Thiam, who had not lost since May 2016, but she produced four personal bests to take a stunning gold. And afterwards she credited a move to France in January 2017 for changing her career around.\n\nKatarina Johnson-Thompson breaks British record to win heptathlon gold Read more\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s got their journey,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not been very straightforward for me. It\u2019s not been easy for me. I had to move coach. I had to move country, I had to learn a new language and settle in. I tore everything up and started again and it\u2019s worked.\n\n\u201cThe last two world championships have been heartbreaking for my mum and I. Mid-heptathlon, I\u2019ve gone back to my hotel and cried and cried for hours when things have gone badly. It was after the high jump in London in 2017 and after the long jump in 2015 in Beijing. Those were the low points of my career. Rio Olympics, as well. I\u2019ve had a lot of bad years. I\u2019m just so happy that I came out in front for a change.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile Ennis-Hill hailed Johnson-Thompson\u2019s achievements and said she believed the 26-year-old could break the 7,000-points barrier. \u201cTo come back and deliver in this way with all these personal bests is incredible,\u201d Ennis-Hill said. \u201cYou have to get to the lowest point, the breaking point.\n\n\u201cShe got to that and she made big changes and decisions and they are the reason she has gone on to improve and become the world champion now.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe was so fixated on winning and breaking 7,000 points that it took away from her performance. Now she has put it to one side it will happen naturally.\u201d", "description": "Katarina Johnson-Thompson said it was \u2018like a dream\u2019 to win world heptathlon gold after turning her career around", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43fb39840a89f4bd60889d53146bd62840e1762c/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=4be0a5e677c3a275193ae790943cc47c", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
