On a comparison site, I found More Than cover for \u00a3214. I chose this and paid by credit card.\n\nWhen I received my bank statement, I saw More Than had taken \u00a3325 from my debit card. I demanded it refund this and also cancel the \u00a3214 payment for the new policy.\n\nI am still waiting for both refunds. Meanwhile, I have three insurance policies \u2014 one from a new insurer I chose, and two from More Than.\n\nM. S-T., Merseyside.\n\nCover chaos: One reader was left with three car insurance policies for the same vehicle after his original provider hiked his premium to \u00a3325\n\nSurprise rises in car insurance prices can make us see red. But I'm afraid your muddle is partly of your own making.\n\nWhen you bought your original policy in 2018, you agreed that More Than could retain your card details for automatic renewal. The firm wrote to you on July 23 last year confirming this.\n\nOn July 1 this year, it wrote to remind you of the automatic renewal. You didn't contact the firm to cancel, so the payment went through.\n\nMore Than makes the point that auto-renewal is legal and standard practice in the insurance industry. It is there to make sure you don't illegally drive without insurance when a policy expires.\n\nA system error meant your refund request was processed late. You have been offered \u00a375 compensation for this.\n\nThe new More Than policy you chose for \u00a3214.89 was not like for like.\n\nIt included a voluntary excess of \u00a3100, did not protect your no-claims discount and included your spouse as a driver.\n\nMore Than admits it also added a new business discount.\n\nThe second policy has now also been cancelled and you have received a full refund. So you have your \u00a3540 back, plus \u00a375 compensation.\n\nWhen using a comparison site, it is vital to make sure you are checking like with like, otherwise you could end up under-insured or not covered for things you value, such as legal protection.\n\nMore Than says that if customers can find cheaper quotes elsewhere, they should call it to discuss the options.\n\nI say that if insurance companies value our custom, they should offer us the best price without us having to phone them and negotiate!\n\nYou have YOUR say: spam mail Every week, Money Mail receives hundreds of your letters and emails about our stories. Here are some of the best from our story about a reader who took legal action against a spam mail pest which was fined \u00a3530: I received numerous calls and emails from two different estate agents whom I had never employed. They stopped only when I threatened legal action. B. E., Wilmslow, Cheshire. I get approximately ten spam emails a day and they are all from the U.S. Obviously my details were sold on when a company was hacked. I report all the messages as phishing, but the same emails turn up time and time again. R. J., Filey, N. Yorks. When I started receiving spam mail, I decided to redirect it to two firms I suspected of passing on my details. All of my junk mail now goes to them. Revenge is a dish best served cold. W. O., Milton Keynes. I created a contacts group of spam email addresses. Each time I receive a suspicious email, I send it to that group. I now receive very few of these messages, so it clearly works. A. N., email. If you ask a company to remove your email address from its contact list, it should do just that. If it doesn't oblige, then it is misusing the email system. It's a waste of your time and that of the company itself. E. O., East Midlands. Companies that hand out people's contact details should face a bigger penalty than \u00a3500. After a 14-month legal fight, the web developer should have been given \u00a31,500 at the very least. B. S., Lincolnshire. I played a lottery game online on one occasion. I ticked a box to say I didn't want to be contacted, but I have received a barrage of texts ever since. They are invasive and irritating. A. C., Liverpool.\n\nI have banked with NatWest for more than 50 years. About 30 years ago, it offered me a Gold card with an overdraft of \u00a310,000.\n\nThe interest was bank rate plus a further 5 per cent or 6 per cent.\n\nAbout two years ago, it unilaterally breached this contract, charging me a higher rate of about 9 per cent.\n\nIt then moved me on to its so-called 'tailored' account, the interest of which is about 19 per cent. To say the least, I find this to be punitive.\n\nR. P., Exeter.\n\nI'm afraid that RBS, which owns NatWest, was entitled to change the interest rate. It wrote to Gold customers in 2015 advising that the account was being rebranded.\n\nCustomers were given 60 days' notice of the variation, in line with regulations.\n\nI have seen a copy of the letter, which clearly states: 'We're no longer going to be offering Gold Plus.'\n\nIt also confirmed that you were pre-approved for the new credit card and provided a representative interest rate for this.\n\nYou may have been with NatWest for more than 50 years, but if you're not happy with the service or interest rate you are being charged, then perhaps it is time to consider moving elsewhere.\n\n***\n\nFor 20 years, I paid \u00a325.25 a month into an Aviva life policy. In December 2018, the company phoned to say I had missed two payments, and asked if I wanted to carry on.\n\nI was told there was \u00a345,000 to be paid out in March, so I chose to continue with the payments.\n\nMarch came, and nothing arrived. I phoned and was told that I wouldn't be receiving any payment as this was life insurance, not an investment policy.\n\nThe money I have paid now seems a complete waste.\n\nC. C., Essex.\n\nI can assure you these payments were not a complete waste of money, because they have given you life cover for the past 20 years.\n\nIf you had died within that period, then your beneficiaries would have received \u00a345,000 \u2014 but the good news is that you are still with us.\n\nAviva cannot trace any call where you were told you would be paid \u00a345,000 as a lump sum.\n\nThe original sales documents are very clear that the plan was set up to provide life insurance, which would pay out should you die within the policy term.\n\nHowever, Aviva is willing to accept that there may have been some confusion as a result of the phone call, so it is refunding your last two premiums, totalling \u00a350.50.", "description": "The cost of my car insurance with More Than increased dramatically to \u00a3325.
