Brown, of course, was teammates with Cousins in Washington in 2017 before the Redskins moved on from the quarterback.\n\n\u201cCousins, I think every defense is going to want that guy to throw the ball,\u201d Brown said Friday. \u201cFor me, that\u2019s probably the weakest part of their offense is him. Everything else is good. They\u2019ve got a good running game, probably one of the best in the league. They have real good receivers. You just want them to pass the ball. You want Kirk Cousins to get it in his hands.\u201d\n\nPhiladelphia got Cousins to throw the ball \u2014 for 333 yards on 22-for-29 passing with four touchdowns, including 62-yard and 51-yard touchdowns to Stefon Diggs in the same quarter.\n\nThe Vikings went on to win, 38-20.\n\nESPN\u2019s Adam Schefter tweeted that \u201cmultiple teams (are) expected to be interested\u201d in Brown, who was starting for the Eagles, further reinforcing the impression that Brown\u2019s release did not have to do with his play.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
