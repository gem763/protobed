But he has previously insisted he would not be satisfied with a partial deal to resolve his two-year effort to change China\u2019s trade, intellectual property and industrial policy practices, which he argues cost millions of U.S. jobs.\n\nThere have also been reports that the Trump administration is readying further measures aimed at China, with unknown consequences for trade negotiations.\n\nSuch wildly shifting expectations have been a persistent feature of the trade war, and observers remained cautious over what might emerge from this week\u2019s talks.\n\n\u201cChina wants peace, but I don\u2019t think China will give more,\u201d one Chinese trade expert said on condition of anonymity.", "description": "A Chinese state newspaper said on Friday that a \"partial\" trade deal would benefit China and the United States, and Washington should take the offer on the table, reflecting Beijing's aim of cooling the row before more U.S. tariffs kick in.", "authors": ["Yawen Chen", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439618030&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0P2", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
