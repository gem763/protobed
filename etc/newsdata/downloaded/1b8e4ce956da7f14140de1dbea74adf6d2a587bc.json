But in his remarks here, Biden slammed the GOP and \u201chatchet men\u201d who he said echo Trump\u2019s words.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cHe is repeatedly smearing me and my family. His party fans out to carry the smear,\u201d Biden said.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cLet me make something clear to Trump and his hatchet men and the special interests funding his attacks against me \u2014 I\u2019m not going anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me. And you\u2019re not going to destroy my family. I don\u2019t care how much money you spend or how dirty the attacks get.\u201d\n\nBiden said the attacks by Trump were an attempt to \u201cpick his opponent and go against only the candidates he thinks he can beat. Well, we\u2019re not going to let Donald Trump pick his candidate.\u201d\n\nDemocrats have begun to worry that Trump\u2019s relentless attacks on Biden will weigh on the campaign, even if they\u2019re baseless. If Biden is the Democratic nominee there is fear that Trump could succeed in sowing doubt in voters\u2019 minds.\n\nAD\n\nTrump has accused Biden of pressuring Ukraine to fire its top prosecutor in 2016 to benefit his son, Hunter.\n\nAD\n\nHunter Biden served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine\u2019s largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors over possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation. At the time that Joe Biden, then acting in his capacity as vice president, sought to have Viktor Shokin, the Ukrainian prosecutor, ousted, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.\n\nBiden and other Western officials have said they were in agreement that Shokin needed to go because he was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases in Ukraine.\n\nAD\n\nBiden said Trump sought to discredit him and his family because, \u201clike every bully in history, he\u2019s afraid. He\u2019s afraid of just how badly I would beat him next November.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nDuring a July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president, Trump asked him to investigate Biden\u2019s son for possible corruption. Republicans have leveled the charge that it was improper for a vice president\u2019s son to sit on the board of a foreign company.\n\nIn the roughly 30 minutes that Biden spoke, he didn\u2019t touch on the appearance of a conflict of interest. He said repeatedly that independent news organizations had debunked Trump\u2019s claims.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, during a news conference with the president of Finland, Trump called Biden and his son \u201cstone-cold crooked.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBiden was asked about Trump and impeachment during a gun-safety forum in Las Vegas and was asked if he had spoken to Hunter Biden about the matter. Biden said they had \u201ccommunicated a couple of times\u201d but did not offer more detail.\n\n\u201cBut look, there is zero, zero, zero, zero evidence of any assertion being made, I\u2019m not going to \u2026 look, the issue is this president of the United States engaged in something apparently that is close to, well, engaged in activity that at minimum gives a lot of running room for the Russians and Ukraine and I think we should just focus on the issue,\u201d Biden told the reporters. \u201cNobody has ever asserted that I did anything wrong except he and what\u2019s that fellow\u2019s name? Rudy Udi? Giuliani?\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "\u201cYou\u2019re not going to destroy me. And you\u2019re not going to destroy my family.
