(Note that even though my statistics are from the United States, the numbers are pretty much identical north of the border.)\n\nReady? Here we go.\n\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, the average American family stays in a home for about nine years. The average American family also keeps the bulk of their net worth in their home, under the assumption that a house is a good investment that always increases in value.\n\nLet's see what happens to this average American family over these nine years.\n\nRead more: A woman who studied 600 millionaires discovered where you choose to live has 2 effects on your ability to build wealth\n\nHistorically, housing tends to appreciate at the rate of inflation, but for the purposes of this example let's give housing a big boost and say that it increases at the same rate as the stock market, an average annual rate of 6%. If this were to happen, then over nine years a house purchased for $500,000 will increase to a value of $844,739, for a total gain of $344,739. By the time that family sells they expect a nice fat check, and everyone is ecstatic! Awesome, right?\n\nWell, not quite. The problem is that owning a house costs money way beyond the purchase price. It costs money to buy, sell, finance, and appraise it, and to insure and maintain it each year, which we logically know but basically just dismiss when we're digging deep for that down payment. I did too, thinking, How much could that be?\n\nTurns out, a lot. First, there are fees involved in the purchase. Buyers have to pay for a title search at their land registry office, which costs an average of $100. Then to register their purchase, they have to pay a title recording fee\u2014$150. In some states, they have to pay a lawyer to do this for them, which is about $1,000. So far, we're up to $1,250.\n\nRead more: Deciding to buy a home instead of rent isn't always a question of simple math\n\nStill sounds like small potatoes, doesn't it? Well, in the immortal words of Samuel L. Jackson in Jurassic Park, \"Hold on to your butts.\" You have to insure the house. Rates vary by city and state, but the average national cost is about 0.5% of the home value, per year. This gets paid annually, so over nine years that's $500,000 \u00d7 0.5% \u00d7 9 = $22,500. You have to pay property taxes; the average annual rate in the United States is about 1%. $500,000 \u00d7 1% \u00d7 9 = $45,000.\n\nThis stuff is starting to add up, isn't it? And houses cost money to maintain. Roofs collapse, pipes burst, ghosts of Civil War soldiers haunt your cellar. Realtors recommend setting aside between 1% and 3% of your home value every year for maintenance. So conservatively, this would be $500,000 \u00d7 1% \u00d7 9 = $45,000.\n\nAt the end of those nine years, our average American family wants to sell. Selling costs money, too. First, you have to pay your real estate broker. A typical commission is 6%, which gets calculated on the final sale price, not the original purchase price. Six percent of $844,739 is $50,684. Also, don't forget about land transfer taxes, which are paid to the city and can vary from almost nothing (0.01% in Colorado) to ridiculously high (4% in Pittsburgh). The national average is about 1.2%, and 1.2% of $844,739 is $10,137.\n\nAnd that damn lawyer fee of $1,000. You have to pay that again.\n\nIf all these numbers are making your head spin, you aren't alone. Here's a summary of all these costs we've talked about:\n\nPenguin Random House\n\nIn total, this family has paid a whopping $175,571 just to own this house. So that $344,739 gain they were anticipating? Fifty-one percent of it got eaten up!\n\nPenguin Random House\n\nYour piece of the pie is only 49% of the total gain of the house.\n\nMaybe you're thinking, That's not so bad; that's still six figures of gain. Here's the thing. In this analysis, I've assumed that this family bought the house outright with a suitcase full of cash. As we know, almost no one does that; they borrow the money in the form of a mortgage. So, let's add that in.\n\nThe typical down payment on a first- time home purchase is 10%, and to cover the balance, our family walked into their local bank and got a mortgage. As of 2018, the interest from this mortgage no longer makes sense to deduct, since the standard deduction got raised in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, so our family gets no tax break from loans of less than $600,000.\n\nAfter nine years, our typical American family will have paid $162,033 of interest to their bank! That's money they're never getting back.\n\nSo now let's add that onto our costs.\n\nPenguin Random House\n\nOur typical American family has now paid $337,604 for the pleasure of buying their home! That's 98% of the gain they were supposed to get!\n\nPenguin Random House\n\nThey're left with that tiny slice at the top: 2%.\n\nAnd remember, this is all based on the wildly optimistic assumption that their house will appreciate at the rate of the stock market (6%) year after year. If the house appreciates any slower, then they're actually losing money. This is why the typical family who keeps the majority of their net worth in their property never accumulates much money. They think they're getting ahead as they see its value go up, but they don't realize that all the extra costs add up to the point where most of their gain has vanished.\n\nRead more: The suburban mansion may be losing its spot as part of the American Dream, and it highlights just how different millennials' and baby boomers' worlds are\n\nA house can be a great investment\u2014for real estate brokers, the government, insurance companies, and banks. Basically, for everyone except the owner.\n\nFor the owner, a house is a terrible investment.\n\nNow, to be clear, I'm talking about primary residences. In other words, a house you buy, move into, and live in. Housing can be a good investment if it's purchased to rent out to a tenant. However, land-lording is a whole other topic that's beyond the scope of this book, so I'm not going to talk about it. There are tons of great resources on that topic; go read one of them.\n\nReprinted from \"Quit Like a Millionaire: No Gimmicks, Luck, or Trust Fund Required\" by arrangement with TarcherPerigee, an imprint of Penguin Publishing Group, a division of Penguin Random House LLC.
