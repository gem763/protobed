The French automaker previously had planned to jointly develop common small car platforms in Europe with GM. But since the Opel/Vauxhall acquisition, PSA has begun the process of shifting the former GM models to its own platforms.\n\nUnder CEO and Chairman Carlos Tavares, PSA has accelerated plans to modernize and simplify its vehicle architectures, with most of its future cars, crossovers and compact vans to be built on just two platforms, Fiorani said.\n\nThe company\u2019s Efficient Modular Platform, or EMP, was introduced in 2013, and eventually will underpin a wide range of vehicles under PSA\u2019s five brands (Peugeot, Citroen, DS, Opel, Vauxhall).\n\nA newer, smaller architecture called Common Modular Platform (CMP) was launched earlier this year and is expected to provide the base for subcompact models ranging from the Peugeot 208 to the Opel Mokka.\n\nFCA\u2019s main car platforms, used primarily for crossovers in North America, are considerably older. The larger platform, called CUSW (for Compact US Wide), underpins the Jeep Cherokee and was first used for the Alfa Romeo Giulietta in 2010.\n\nThe smaller platform, called SUSW (for Small US Wide), is the base for the European-built Jeep Renegade and ProMaster City in North America and underpins a wide range of Fiat models in Europe, including the 500L and 500X. Elements of the platform date back to 2005, when Fiat and GM jointly developed a common small-car platform for their European models.\n\nFiat Chrysler has an existing joint venture in Europe with PSA called Sevel that builds large commercial vehicles for both companies. The big Ram ProMaster van that is sold in the United States is a version of the Fiat Ducato. Companion models include the Peugeot Boxer and Citroen Jumper.", "description": "A proposed merger between France's Groupe PSA and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles would give FCA access to Peugeot\u2019s more modern and flexible vehicle architectures, potentially enabling the combined companies to achieve lower costs through higher production volumes, a global auto analyst said on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Paul Lienert", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191030&t=2&i=1446682572&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9T1XA", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
