Straw added that this could result in a breakdown of the United Kingdom\u2019s tax system, and ultimately the demise of the country\u2019s National Health Service.\n\nThe straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back\n\nStraw sees a huge potential for disruption if a scalable blockchain-based financial system gains popularity:\n\n\u201cLet's say that somebody actually does produce a working blockchain peer-to-peer system. It'll be a lending system that actually scales, we won't need banks anymore.\u201d\n\nWithout banks, there will be no need for central clearinghouses, and the whole business model of the City of London will collapse, taking with it perhaps the biggest tax contributor in the country.\n\nSo who is paying for services?\n\nAlongside the reduction in tax revenue through the loss of the banking industry, Straw warns that anonymous payments could increase public tax avoidance.\n\nHe backs France and Germany\u2019s calls to ban global stablecoin projects like Facebook\u2019s Libra, calling blockchain, \u201cthe killer of democracy in many ways.\u201d\n\nIf nobody is paying taxes then funding for institutions like the NHS grinds to a halt.\n\nBlockchain: not all bad\n\nStraw did, however, sing the praises of blockchain-based smart contracts, calling them, \u201ca bit of a joy.\u201d\n\nThe ability to carry out fast automated transactions while cutting out the need for services such as escrow and lawyers is a huge benefit, he explained.\n\nFor its part, the City of London is finally making moves to reinvent itself before its banking industry is potentially disrupted by cryptocurrencies and blockchain.", "description": "A blockchain-based P2P financial system could make the City of London irrelevant, says a McKinsey advisor", "authors": ["Jack Martin"], "top_image": "https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/740_IGh0dHBzOi8vczMuY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vc3RvcmFnZS91cGxvYWRzL3ZpZXcvODBjYjBkMWNjYjRjOTcxZjAyMzU0MWRlNjUyMGYwNDkuanBn.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
