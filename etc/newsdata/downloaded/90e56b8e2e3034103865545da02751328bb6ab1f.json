Add the spices and cook for 5 minutes, then stir in the molasses, miso, cider vinegar and passata or chopped tomatoes. Return the sauce to a gentle boil and simmer until it thickens. Remove the pan from the heat.\n\nTo make the pulled oyster mushrooms, heat a large saucepan over a medium heat and add them with a dash of oil, place the lid on top and cook for 15 minutes or until well cooked and soft. Remove from the pan and shred the mushrooms into thin pieces using two forks. Return the shredded mushrooms to the pan and add enough BBQ sauce to hold everything together. Set aside.\n\nTo prepare the salsa, combine the kohlrabi, mango, chilli flakes, red onion and coriander stalks in a bowl. Season to taste and set aside.\n\nTo make the arepas, measure the masa harina flour into a mixing bowl, pour in 550ml hot water. Season with a pinch of salt and mix to a firm but not too crumbly dough, adding a little more water or flour if necessary. Cover the bowl with a cloth and set aside to rest for 1 hour, if possible. Split the dough into eight balls and flatten each ball into a small cake, approx 1-2cm thick.\n\nHeat a glug of oil in a heavy-based skillet or frying pan over a medium-low heat. Arrange the arepas in the pan, cover with a lid and cook slowly for 6-7 minutes or until the arepas are golden brown and slightly charred. Flip and allow to brown on the other side.\n\nTo serve, reheat the \u201cpulled\u201d BBQ oyster mushrooms and present everything on the table for people to make their own. To make, cut open the arepas and stuff with the \u201cpulled\u201d oyster mushrooms and salsa. Garnish with the coriander leaves.\n\nAny leftover BBQ sauce can be stored in a sealed, sterilised jar for up to a month in the fridge.\n\nRecipe by Tom Hunt, eco-chef, writer, campaigner and founder of Poco Tapas Bar Bristol", "description": "Arepas with BBQ oyster mushrooms Arepas are a traditional Venezuelan street food, a moreish corn cake made from maize flour, fried on a griddle and stuffed with a variety of fillings.
