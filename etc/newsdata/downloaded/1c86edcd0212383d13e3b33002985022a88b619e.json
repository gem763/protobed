That's when we saw his friend Bryce riding him on the bike with no shirt on,' she told WDIV. 'I start to freak out. \"Take him to the hospital, take him to the hospital.\" I'm crying. He's crying.'\n\nJason was hospitalized for four days after the September 28 incident at a friend's house.\n\nJason, of Deerborn Heights, suffered second-degree burns to his chin, chest and stomach when his friend sprayed him with nail polish remover and set him on fire\n\nJason Cleary is home after four days in the hospital. He was the victim of a dangerous online challenge\n\n'I just want everybody to know that these challenges, or whatever they\u2019re watching on YouTube, is not worth risking your life,' Tabitha told WDIV. 'My son got burned second-degree \u2014 and it could have been way worse.'\n\nJason admitted they actually tried the challenge twice.\n\n'The first time it was like a little tiny fire, then they swatted it out,' Jason said.\n\nOn the second try, he said, flames flared up.\n\nThe fire challenge usually involves people being doused in rubbing alcohol and lit on fire for a few seconds. The alcohol burns off quickly, and the fire is supposed to be extinguished in a bathtub or other water.\n\nA 12-year-old Detroit girl experienced burns to half of her body attempting this stunt last year, while a 12-year-old boy in South Carolina suffered burns to 40 per cent to his body attempting the challenge home alone last year.\n\nChildren in Kentucky and California have fallen victim to the fire challenge.\n\n'I just want everybody to know that these challenges, or whatever they\u2019re watching on YouTube, is not worth risking your life,' Tabitha (right) said. She is pictured with her son\n\nThe University of Iowa's Injury Prevention Research Center said the dangerous and potentially deadly stunt started popping up around 2010.\n\nOther unsafe challenges, including ones that involved hot water, arrived on the scene in the years that followed, NBC News reported.\n\nThere was a similar challenge in 2016 when the 'fire spray challenge' gained popularity on the internet.\n\nTeenagers would get their kicks spraying open flames with hairspray and other household items.\n\nAnother viral dare involved eating Tide Pods, which had a design of swirling colors, initially giving off the appearance of candy.\n\nTrying to understand why children would put themselves in harm's way, Devorah Heitner, author of 'Screenwise: Helping Kids Thrive (and Survive) in Their Digital World' told USA Today: 'It could be that that kid is more isolated and has something to prove to peers.'", "description": "Tabitha Cleary said her son Jason, of\u00a0Deerborn Heights, Michigan, described the terrifying moment she saw her injured son after his body burst into flames.", "authors": ["Jerry Barmash For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/04/19322696-0-image-a-10_1570244966004.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
