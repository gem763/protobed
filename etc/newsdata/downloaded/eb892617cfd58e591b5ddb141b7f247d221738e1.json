Fans couldn\u2019t help but join in on mocking Paul as they chanted \u2018where\u2019s your dog?\u2019 repeatedly at Paul in all black, wearing a beret and a simple mustache.\n\nPaul\u2019s first words on stage after being booed by the entire crowd: \u201cWow, wow, wow. That\u2019s a shame! After all the help we gave you in World War II, this is how you return the favour! Winston Churchill would be ashamed.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019d have done well to hear him speak over the chanting from fans, booing and screaming at him while simultaneously cheering for their hero \u2013 KSI.\n\n\u201cI have no respect for this man,\u201d KSI said.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to finish him off. Welcome to London, mother******.\u201d\n\nThe press conference, of course, couldn\u2019t be complete with Shannon Briggs interrupting with his \u2018let\u2019s go champ!\u2019 tagline, repeated no fewer than 500 times on stage.\n\nThe pair failed to hold back as Logan got as personal as possible, threatening to kill his opponent in the ring.\n\n\u201cI might kill this man. JJ is on his fifth abortion, his fifth. Five babies \u2013 dead. I might return the favour and kill you.\u201d\n\nThere was some boxing talk, too.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got a very good jab but you can\u2019t fight backwards,\u201d KSI said when asked by host The True Geordie about Paul\u2019s strengths and weaknesses.\n\n\u201cOn the night, all your boxing ability is going to go out of the window.\n\n\u201cMy biggest strength is my strength. You cannot knock me out.\u201d\n\nAs fans got even more excited by every word KSI shouted at his opponent, they began to descend into chaos, throwing bottles, tissue, anything they could find at the American.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to throw things at me, at least hit me,\u201d Paul said as he addressed the crowd.\n\nBefore coming face to face one final time before fight week, the pair both, inevitably, predict knockouts.\n\nNow, both men going away and back to their training camps in the knowledge that they have drawn thousands and generated interest perhaps unlike any boxing event has seen before.\n\nWhat happens next, happens in the ring.", "description": "KSI and Logan Paul drew an audience of more than 4,000 fans at their press conference in London.
