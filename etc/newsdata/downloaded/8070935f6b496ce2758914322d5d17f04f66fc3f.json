This week, the crew is deploying equipment to investigate what could be another.\n\nHistorians consider the Battle of Midway an essential US victory and a key turning point in WWII.\n\n\"We read about the battles. We know what happened. But when you see these wrecks on the bottom of the ocean and everything, you kind of get a feel for what the real price is for war,\" said Frank Thompson, a historian with the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington, DC, who is onboard the Petrel. \"You see the damage these things took, and it's humbling to watch some of the video of these vessels because they're war graves.\"\n\nThe Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga in the Pacific Ocean off Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, October 7, 2019. Vulcan Inc. via AP\n\nUntil now, only one of the seven ships that went down in the June 1942 air and sea battle \u2014 five Japanese vessels and two American \u2014 had been located.\n\nThe expedition is an effort started by the late Paul Allen, the billionaire cofounder of Microsoft. For years, the crew of the 250-foot Petrel has worked with the US Navy and other officials around the world to find and document sunken ships. It is illegal to otherwise disturb the underwater US military gravesites, and their exact coordinates are kept secret.\n\nThe Petrel has found 31 vessels so far. This is the first time it has looked for warships from the Battle of Midway, which took place six months after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and left more than 2,000 Japanese and 300 Americans dead.\n\nThe attack from the Japanese Imperial Navy was meant to be a surprise, a strike that would give Japan a strategic advantage in the Pacific. It was thwarted when US analysts decoded Japanese messages and baited their enemy into revealing its plan.\n\nUS Navy cruiser USS Astoria steams by the aircraft carrier USS Yorktown shortly after the carrier had been hit by three Japanese bombs in the battle of Midway, June 4, 1942. US Navy via AP\n\nAs Japanese warplanes started bombing the military installation at Midway Atoll, a tiny group of islands about 1,300 miles northwest of Honolulu, US forces were already on their way to intercept Japan's fleet. US planes sank four of Japan's aircraft carriers and a cruiser, and downed dozens of its fighter planes.\n\nOne of the American ships lost was the USS Yorktown, an aircraft carrier that was heavily damaged and being towed by the U.S. on the battle's final day when it was hit by torpedoes. The other, the USS Hammann, went down trying to defend the Yorktown.\n\nRetired Navy Capt. Jack Crawford, who recently turned 100, was among the Yorktown's 2,270 survivors.\n\nJapanese dive bombers left the Yorktown badly damaged, with black smoke gushing from its stacks, but the vessel was still upright.\n\nThen the torpedoes hit, Crawford told The Associated Press by telephone from his home in Maryland.\n\n\"Bam! Bam! We get two torpedoes, and I know we're in trouble. As soon as the deck edge began to go under, I knew she wasn't going to last,\" said Crawford, whose later military career was with the naval nuclear propulsion program. He also served as deputy assistant secretary for nuclear energy in the Department of Energy.\n\nThe flight deck of USS Yorktown shortly after it was hit by two Japanese aerial torpedoes, June 4, 1942. US Navy via AP\n\nThe Yorktown sank slowly, and a destroyer was able to pick up Crawford and many others.\n\nIn May 1998, almost 56 years later, an expedition led by the National Geographic Society in conjunction with the US Navy found the Yorktown 3 miles below the surface.\n\nCrawford doesn't see much value in these missions to find lost ships, unless they can get some useful information on how the Japanese ships went down. But he wouldn't mind if someone was able to retrieve his strongbox and the brand-new sword he left in it when he and others abandoned ship 77 years ago.\n\nHe was too far away to see the Kaga go down.\n\nA piece of the Japanese aircraft carrier was discovered in 1999, but its main wreckage was still missing \u2014 until last week.\n\nVulcan Inc. director of undersea operations for the Petrel, Rob Kraft, left, and the Naval History and Heritage Command's Frank Thompson, right, look at footage of the Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga, off Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, October 16, 2019.

It compared the footage with historical records and confirmed this week it had found the Kaga.\n\n\"On the occasion of the discovery of the Kaga, we send our thoughts and prayers to our trusted and valued friends in Japan,\" said Rear Adm. Brian P. Fort, commander of US Naval Forces in Japan. \"The terrible price of war in the Pacific was felt by all our navies. From that painful lesson, we have become the closest of allies and friends committed to maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific.\"\n\nThe other three Japanese aircraft carriers \u2014 the Akagi, Soryu and Hiryu \u2014 and the Japanese cruiser Mikuma are still unaccounted for.\n\nThe Japanese aircraft carrier Kaga is shown in the Pacific Ocean off Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, October 7, 2019. Vulcan Inc. via AP\n\nThe Petrel crew hopes to find and survey all the wreckage from the battle, an effort that could add new details about Midway to history books.\n\nEarlier this year, they discovered the USS Hornet, an aircraft carrier that helped win the Battle of Midway but sank in the Battle of Santa Cruz near the Solomon Islands less than five months later. More than 100 crew members died.\n\nThe Petrel also discovered the USS Indianapolis, the US Navy's single deadliest loss at sea.\n\nRob Kraft, director of subsea operations on the Petrel, says Allen gave him and his crew a mission to preserve history, educate people about the past and honor those who fought on these great ships. Allen died last year.\n\n\"This originally started with his desire to honor his father's service to our country,\" Kraft said. \"It really extends beyond that at this time. We're honoring today's service members, it's about education and, you know, bringing history back to life for future generations.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Mark Thiessen in Anchorage, Alaska, and researcher Jennifer Farrar in New York contributed to this report.", "description": "Until now, only one of the seven ships \u2014 five Japanese vessels and two American \u2014 that went down in the June 1942 battle of Midway had been located.", "authors": ["Caleb Jones", "Associated Press"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5daa122f4af9090eae41401b?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
