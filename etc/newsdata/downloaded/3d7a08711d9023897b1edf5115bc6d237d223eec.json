He controlled the ball with his chest before sending it the other way to leave Suarez in a one-on-one situation against Getafe goalkeeper David Soria. The Uruguay striker calmly one-touched a lob shot over Soria for his third goal of the season.\n\n''Let's not fool ourselves, I saw him, but not that clearly,'' Ter Stegen said, with a smile. ''It was the perfect timing and Luis took advantage of it. It was a wonderful goal.''\n\nFirpo scored his first goal for Barcelona from close range in the 49th after being set up by Carles Perez, Messi's substitute in the attack.\n\nIt was the first away win for Barcelona, and its first league game without conceding.\n\nMessi was out again after injuring his left abductor muscle in the first half of Barcelona's 2-1 win against Villarreal on Tuesday, his first start of the season following a long layoff because of a right calf injury sustained preseason.\n\nBarcelona coach Ernesto Valverde also could not count on Ousmane Dembele because of a muscle ailment.\n\nGetafe, which dropped to 11th place, had been unbeaten since a loss at Atletico Madrid in the league opener.\n\n--\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP-Sports\n\n---\n\nStory continues\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni", "description": "Barcelona overcame the absence of Lionel Messi to beat Getafe 2-0 in the Spanish league on Saturday with Luis Suarez scoring off a long pass from goalkeeper Marc-Andre ter Stegen.
