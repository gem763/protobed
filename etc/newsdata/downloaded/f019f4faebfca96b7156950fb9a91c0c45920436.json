Like everywhere else, there is no guaranteed money in crypto trading, and if someone tells you otherwise, you should steer away from them as far away as possible. It is, however, a highly lucrative way to make money, as many people make a living by trading cryptocurrency but it may not be for everyone.\n\nCryptocurrency trading\n\nHigh volatility, price fluctuations, pumps and dumps, Ponzi schemes, exit scams, shady exchanges, and limited regulatory oversight make profitable crypto trading exclusive to risk-prone, skilled, and level-headed traders who enjoy massive gains, especially during bull markets. You've probably heard a story or two about them.\n\nA handful of highly experienced traders even manage to make profits even during bear markets, when the streets are filled with \"blood,\" people are panic selling, and the prices are dropping as fast as the value of Venezuelan Bolivar.\n\nThis guide will show you the most common cryptocurrency trading strategies that you can apply to your crypto trades immediately.\n\nTechnical analysis (TA)\n\nIf you want to get into crypto trading, you\u2019d better learn at least the basics of technical analysis. Although looking at the charts, drawing lines and identifying key price levels may appear foolish at first, it is one of the best tools you can have at your disposal, and it's certainly better than having nothing.\n\nIf you have previous experience in Forex and Stocks markets, you\u2019ll know what we're talking about. But unlike Forex and Stocks, where key levels and price pretty much follow established technical analysis methods, the wild west frontier of crypto trading is significantly more rebellious. The price movements are way more volatile, the markets move fast, and they are more prone to price manipulation. Hence, the knowledge baggage you might bring from other markets needs to be adapted to crypto through your own experience, lessons, sharp and decisive actions, and appropriate risk-management methods.\n\nAlthough it may seem complicated, crypto trading combined with adequate TA methods can lead to many high-profit opportunities. If you are smart and vigilant about your trades and strategy, you\u2019re likely to be in for a fun and profitable ride.\n\nThe tools that you can use to aid your decision-making process are:\n\nTradingview (charts and technical analysis)\n\n(charts and technical analysis) Predicoin (market sentiment analysis service)\n\n(market sentiment analysis service) Coinpaprika (coin index and research site)\n\n(coin index and research site) Coinmarketcal (a calendar of upcoming crypto events)\n\n(a calendar of upcoming crypto events) Delta (portfolio tracking app)\n\nBesides, a great place to kick-off your trading career is eToro. Known for its social trading feature, eToro also offers you plenty of resources, tools, and guides to learn the ins and outs of both crypto and traditional trading.\n\nCrytpocurrency trading strategies\n\nStrategy #1: Hodl\n\nHodl is a fundamental long-term crypto trading strategy for every beginner. It requires the least skills and experience in trading, and literally anyone can do it.\n\nIt\u2019s famous name Hodl comes from a misspelled word \u201chold.\u201d It was coined in December 2013 following the post by Game Kyuubi at Bitcointalk.org.\n\nOriginal HODL post. Source: Bitcointalk.org.\n\nThe core principle of the Hod crypto trading strategy is to purchase a cryptocurrency with potential and hold it securely for a long time in hopes to sell it for more later. The sale can happen after a year, a few years or even a decade.\n\nFor such a strategy to work, all you need to know is how to purchase cryptocurrency and how to store it securely. Most hodlers use cold storage wallets like paper wallets or hardware devices like Ledger or Trezor.\n\nHodl strategy does have its drawbacks though. First of all, there\u2019s no guarantee that your assets are going to appreciate in value. The project may go bust, the network may experience a failure or other issues, or there may be better alternatives in the future. Second, you may lose your private keys, so storing them safely is a priority.\n\nLast but not least, there is no point in riding out cryptocurrency boom and bust cycles if you\u2019re not taking profits along the way. For instance, if you bought bitcoin in 2017 for around $2,000, held it until it reached $20,000 and didn\u2019t sell a bit along the way, you\u2019ve missed a great chance to make an extra $10,000++ since the price dropped all the way back to retest $3,000.\n\nOf course, it may be difficult to catch sudden, exuberant movements, but it\u2019s a great trade even if you sell at $10,000 or so. Every great crypto bull market has had a nearly 80% retracement, which makes it a no-brainer not to cash out when there\u2019s a chance.\n\nBitcoin price history with reward halving days marked.

Yes, the long-term game is still the main focus here, but don\u2019t forget to take profits whenever possible or at least after major price surges. It\u2019s a smart way to remain liquid and grant yourself a treat for the smart decisions you took. Just holding and not taking profits only tends to lead people to unnecessary irrational decisions further in time.\n\nAll this leads us to the next strategy - swing trading.\n\nStrategy #2: Swing trading\n\nThis is where charts and technical analysis (TA) come in. To be good at swing trading, you need to be at least somewhat familiar with the fundamentals of technical analysis. It will help you to watch the markets and develop a sixth sense for significant price movements.\n\nCrypto technical analysis. Source: TradingView.\n\nSwing trading is all about making aright move at the right time. The goal is simple - to make as much profit as possible during crypto market swings. Whether the prices are going up or down, you always try to capture a chunk of a potential price move.\n\nFor example, if you have an open $5000 position on bitcoin when the market is going up, you want to hedge it at the top (for instance, exchange it to USDT) just before the market reverses just to buy in at the near-term bottom again (change your USDT back to BTC), thus increasing the size of your position.\n\nSuccessful swing traders look to capture a part of the expected move and then move on to the next opportunity all the time, but that may also mean only several trades per week.\n\nThe key is to set concrete entry points, stop losses, and take profit levels before every trade and stick to them. Aiming for $100-200 profit per move is okay, as long as time rewards outweigh risks. In some cases, the market can signal $1000 moves, but it\u2019s incredibly difficult to catch them with 100% accuracy. Therefore, securing profits by moving your stop losses higher should be a priority in profitable swing trading.\n\nStrategy #3: Daytrading\n\nOil day traders at Houston.

Whether it is buying or selling assets, margin trading, or exchanging perpetual contracts, they make a dozen different trades every day hoping to catch favorable price movements. The rewards can be immense, but also a bit challenging for novices - especially if you know little about technical and fundamentals analyses or have little experience in the markets. It may take months or even years of loses before you actually graduate into a profitable daytrader.\n\nIn the crypto market, daytraders must stick to the charts and follow the price movements closely. Be prepared to cut losses, turn in breakeven trades and switch your biases often as to avoid bull or bear traps and loses. As a daytrader, you need to befriend cryptocurrency price fluctuations and literally live off them regardless of which direction market is going. For every price move, there is also a counter trade at its reversal point - an excellent opportunity to increase your bags.\n\nDay trading is all about quick sharp decisions that are meant to minimize your exposure to risks and maximize your profits. Of course, no trader is 100% right all the time, so be ready to close positions in significant losses, too. Learn to identify possible support and resistance levels, re-enter your trades at the right time, set goals as well as tight stop losses and sooner or later you\u2019ll graduate the day trading university of crypto.\n\nA meme about bitcoin owners and traders.

All of them differ in the level of involvement, required experience, TA skills, fundamental analysis, ability to make sharp decisions, and mitigate risks. Regardless, you can learn all of these skills if you\u2019re willing to dedicate enough time and effort to cryptocurrency trading.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cimg.co/w/guides/0//", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
