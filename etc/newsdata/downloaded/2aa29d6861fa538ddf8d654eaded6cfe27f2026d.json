The controversy started last month when President Donald Trump suggested the Ukrainian government probe into how the younger Biden secured an appointment to Burisma\u2019s board, shortly after his father was made the Obama administration\u2019s point man on Ukraine.\n\nAs Peter Schweizer, senior contributor at Breitbart News, detailed in his book Secret Empires: How the American Political Class Hides Corruption and Enriches Family and Friends, Hunter Biden secured the position, which paid as much as $83,000 per month despite no background in energy or Ukraine. In fact, his background in investment banking, lobbying, and hedge fund management paled in comparison to that of current and past members of the company\u2019s board of directors.\n\nThe timing of the appointment not only raised flags among ethics watchdogs, but also with Hunter Biden\u2019s own business partners. Christopher Heinz, the stepson of former Secretary of State John Kerry and co-owner of an investment firm with Hunter Biden in 2014, rushed to play damage control with State Department officials at the time of the appointment, according to internal emails obtained by the Washington Examiner.\n\nAdding to concerns is the fact that at the time Hunter Biden joined Burisma, the company was seen as actively courting western leaders to prevent further scrutiny of its business practices. Not only had Zlochevsky had his assets frozen in Great Britain, but the former Ukrainian minister of natural resources was also facing suspicions of public corruption at home. Zlochevsky would later be charged with corruption for using his ministerial office to approve oil and gas licenses to companies under his control.\n\nIt is in the context of Burisma and Zlochevsky\u2019s legal troubles that Joe Biden\u2019s political influence has raised the most red flags. The former vice president has particularly drawn questions over his conduct in demanding the Ukrainian government fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, in 2016.\n\nJoe Biden, who has publicly bragged about the firing, reportedly threatened to withhold more than one billion dollars in U.S. aid if the Ukrainian government did not remove Shokin. He has claimed the demand came from then-President Barack Obama, who had allegedly lost faith in the prosecutor\u2019s ability to tackle corruption.\n\nUnofficially, though, it was known that Shokin was investigating both Burisma and Zlochevsky for public corruption. It is uncertain if the probe extended to Hunter Biden, although Shokin has recently admitted that prior to his ouster he was warned to back off the matter.\n\nRegardless of what occurred, Shokin\u2019s successor, who is now himself being investigated for public corruption, dropped the investigation into Burisma and Zlochevsky, allowing the oligarch to return to the country after having fled in 2014. The Ukrainian government announced earlier this month it would review that decision, a move that could potentially reopen the investigation.\n\nThe appearance of impropriety and conflicting interests between Joe Biden\u2019s political position and Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings, however, are not going away, especially as new revelations keep coming forward like those by Onyshchenko. The younger Biden, himself, has not done much to allay concerns over his conduct, even telling ABC News recently that he regretted getting entangled \u201cin the middle of something that is a \u2026 swamp in many ways.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. Probably not, in retrospect,\u201d Hunter Biden said when asked if he would have been appointed to Burisma\u2019s board if not for his father\u2019s political prominence. \u201cBut that\u2019s\u2014you know\u2014I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s a lot of things that would have happened in my life if my last name wasn\u2019t Biden.\u201d", "description": "A Ukrainian official is claiming that Hunter Biden was only appointed to the board of directors of Burisma Holdings to \u201cprotect\u201d the company.", "authors": ["Haris Alic"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/06/hunter-biden-2014-getty-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
