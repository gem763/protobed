In fact, the international team of scientists projected for the first time that some island nations will probably become uninhabitable.\n\nThe oceans absorb more than 90% of the excess heat from carbon pollution in the air, as well as much of the carbon dioxide itself. Earth's snow and ice, called the cryosphere, are also being eroded.\n\n\"The world's oceans and cryosphere have been taking the heat for climate change for decades. The consequences for nature and humanity are sweeping and severe,\" said Ko Barrett, vice chair of the IPCC and a deputy assistant administrator for research at the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThe report found:\n\n\u2014 Seas are now rising at one-seventh of an inch (3.66 millimeters) a year, which is 2.5 times faster than the rate from 1900 to 1990.\n\n\u2014 The world's oceans have already lost 1% to 3% of the oxygen in their upper levels since 1970 and will lose more as warming continues.\n\n\u2014From 2006 to 2015, the ice melting from Greenland, Antarctica and the world's mountain glaciers has accelerated. They are now losing 720 billion tons (653 billion metric tons) of ice a year.\n\n\u2014Arctic June snow cover has shrunk more than half since 1967, down nearly 1 million square miles (2.5 million square kilometers).\n\n\u2014Arctic sea ice in September, the annual low point, is down almost 13% per decade since 1979. This year's low, reported Monday, tied for the second-lowest on record.\n\n\u2014Marine animals are likely to decrease 15%, and catches by fisheries in general are expected to decline 21% to 24%, by the end of century because of climate change.\n\n\"Climate change is already irreversible,\" French climate scientist Val\u00e9rie Masson-Delmotte, a report lead author, said at a news conference in Monaco, where the document was released. \"Due to the heat uptake in the ocean, we can't go back.\"\n\nBut many of the worst-case projections in the report can still be avoided, depending on how the world handles the emissions of heat-trapping gases, the report's authors said.\n\nThe IPCC increased its projected end-of-century sea level rise in the worst-case scenario by nearly 4 inches (10 centimeters) from its 2013 projections because of the increased recent melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica.\n\nThe new report projects that, under the business-as-usual scenario for carbon emissions, seas by the end of the century will rise between 2 feet (61 centimeters) and 43 inches (110 centimeters), with a most likely rise of 33 inches (84 centimeters). This is slightly less than the traditional 1 meter (39 inches) that scientists often use.\n\nAnd sea level will rise two to three times as much over the centuries to come if warming continues, so the world is looking at a \"future that certainly looks completely different than what we currently have,\" said report co-author Hans-Otto Portner, a German climate scientist.\n\nThe Nobel Prize-winning IPCC requires that its reports be unanimously approved. Because of that, its reports tend to show less sea level rise and smaller harm than other scientific studies, outside experts said.\n\n\"Like many of the past reports, this one is conservative in the projections, especially in how much ice can be lost in Greenland and Antarctica,\" said NASA oceanographer Josh Willis, who studies Greenland ice melt and wasn't part of the report.", "description": "Earth is in more hot water than ever before, and so are we, an expert United Nations climate panel warned in a grim new report Wednesday.
