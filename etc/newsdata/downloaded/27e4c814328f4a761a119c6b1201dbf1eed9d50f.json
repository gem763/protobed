( GIS ) on Wednesday. Let's see how the charts are shaping up.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of GIS, below, we can see two trends. First is an uptrend from late December to late March followed by a second trend, which is sideways to slightly higher from April to September. Prices have been testing the rising 50-day moving average line for much of this second trend. The slower 200-day moving average line is also in an uptrend but has not been tested since February.\n\nThe daily On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line follows a similar movement as the two price trends and recently touched a new high for the move up. The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator has been close to the zero line the past four months telling us there is little strength to this trend.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of GIS, below, we can see that prices have been grinding slowly higher into a resistance zone. Trading volume has been slowing for several months but the weekly OBV line is still pointed up as is the rising 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe trend-following MACD oscillator is in a take profits sell mode but the two lines that make up this indicator are very close together so a crossover and new signal could easily happen.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of GIS, below, we can see an upside price projection of $65.53. A trade at $56.92 will refresh the uptrend while a trade at $51.02 will weaken the chart.\n\nBottom-line strategy: I have no special knowledge of the upcoming earnings from GIS but the charts are slightly favoring the upside.", "description": "General Mills: How Do the Charts Look Ahead of Earnings?...GIS", "authors": ["Bruce Kamich", "General Mills", "How Do The Charts Look Ahead Of Earnings", "We Can See Two Trends With Gis Shares.", "Stocks Quotes In This Article", "Jim Cramer", "James", "Rev Shark", "Bob Lang", "Carolyn Boroden"], "top_image": "http://s.thestreet.com/files/tsc/v2008/photos/contrib/uploads/5e0ee6b2-aaa5-11e7-a59f-8d350ccc5e0a.png", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
