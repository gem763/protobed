Do you know how irregular that is?\u201d Larry Levine, the founder of Wall Street Prison Consultants, who served 10 years at nearly a dozen correctional institutions, told FOX Business.\n\nHuffman was photographed on the grounds of the low-security prison in California on Saturday wearing a dark green jumpsuit, sneakers, a white baseball cap, eyeglasses and what appeared to be a black watch on her wrist. Her husband, William H. Macy, 69, and daughter, Sophia Grace Macy, came to visit her on Saturday. A photo of the actress, Levine says, was taken by an inmate with an unauthorized cell phone. Now, he claims, the phone and email privileges have been banned at the prison because of it.\n\n\u201cNow, the BOP [Federal Bureau of Prisons] has turned off all the telephones, and cut the email for all the inmates which is really going to piss people off. They\u2019re doing this to protect Felicity. Her presence there has put the inmate population on edge; it\u2019s disrupted their ability to remain in communication with their families,\u201d a source at the correctional institution told Levine.\n\n\"They've [inmates] been warned by the staff not to discuss her; not to call home and talk about her; not to email about her. Now, the staff is telling inmates what they can and can't talk about.\" - Larry Levine/Wall Street Prison consultants\n\nAnd if inmates can't make phone calls, Levin said: \u201cIt\u2019s possible she [Huffman] won\u2019t be able to use the phone or email for the rest of her sentence.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the Federal Bureau of Prisons did not immediately return a FOX Business request for comment.\n\nHuffman, 56, surrendered to authorities last Tuesday to begin her 14-day sentence but will only serve 13 days because she received credit for time spent in custody following her arrest in March, the Federal Bureau of Prisons told Entertainment Tonight.\n\nThe former \u201cDesperate Housewives\u201d star pleaded guilty to mail fraud and honest services fraud in May for paying college admissions counselor William Rick Singer to correct her daughter\u2019s wrong answers on her SAT exam, which inflated Sophia Grace\u2019s score 400 points above her PSAT score.\n\nThe prison about 25 miles southeast of Oakland, is a low-security prison with 1,232 inmates, according to its website.\n\nTo get approved to visit an inmate in prison, family members or friends must complete a form, mail it back and wait for a potential background check that may be requested, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons website.\n\n\u201cUsually when an inmate goes into custody, it could take two, three, four weeks for them to get their visits approved. She goes into custody on a Tuesday, she\u2019s getting visits on a Saturday. You know how irregular that is?\u201d Levine told FOX Business.\n\nHuffman was one of the first major public figures revealed in the college scandal the FBI dubbed \u201cOperation Varsity Blues.\u201d The bribery scandal involved 35 wealthy parents who paid millions of dollars to boost their kid\u2019s chances of getting into prominent colleges and universities around the country, including Yale, Stanford, and the University of Southern California.\n\n\u201cFull House\u201d star Lori Laughlin has taken a different legal approach to her role in the admissions scheme, pleading not guilty to money laundering and conspiracy charges. The decision to fight the charges may result in a tougher prison sentence according to local prosecutors.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Prison expert takes FOX Business inside Felicity Huffman's stint inside a California lockup.", "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/huffmanjail.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
