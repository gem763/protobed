Patio hangs on the sunny side of the street, extended makeup wear, salt, chlorine, the occasional bug bite \u2014 not to mention all the fun food you tried at the festival. Good times. But by this time of year, that awesome summer shows its signs on your skin. So as you get back into your regular routine, it might be a good time for some thoughtful skin care to help it back in shape. According to skincare experts there are a few steps you can take to help your skin recover from all that summer!\n\nStart with a clean slate: Exfoliate\n\nThis is a major part of your summer skin recovery plan. \"It helps to remove debris and dead skin cells, [already] leaving your skin brighter and smoother\" explains Orica Smart, esthetician at The O Spot, before adding that by reducing any skin congestion, you skin will absorb any serums and moisturizers that follow better. Echoing this, Erica Savoie, skincare specialist and owner of Avenue Skincare: \"At this time of year people come to me with dull, dehydrated and even congested skin.\" Savoie suggests an exfoliating polish or a gentle peel. \"I like ZO skin health's enzymatic peel. When it comes to full body exfoliation Jessica Burnman, esthetician and founder of Cocoon Apothecary, recommends a 'good scrub; \"Look for something with the right amount of grit \u2026 that can invigorate the skin, like our coffee exfoliating soap.\"\n\nHere are a few more options:\n\nJosh Rosebrook Active Enzyme Exfoliator, $82 Detox Market\n\nClinique 7 Day Scrub Cream Rinse Off Formula, $31, Shoppers Drug Mart\n\nDark spot correct\n\nSmart tells it like it is: \"Sun and heat exposure also gives hyperpigmentation and new brown spots room to surface.\" Savoie suggests professional treatment to repair discolouration like sun spots, \"treatments like chemical peels, IPL treatments\u2026 can be great options to deal with discoloured and uneven skin tone.\" For an at-home solution, Dermalogica Canada skin therapist Praneeta Persaud recommends a serum their C-12 Pure Bright Serum; \"Molecules in serums are generally smaller to penetrate a lower level of the skin.\"\n\nHere are two other serums that promise to brighten spots.\n\nVolition Beauty Strawberry-C Serum, $60, Sephora\n\nDerma E Vitamin C Concentrated Serum, $34.99, Well.ca\n\nBoost hydration\n\nThanks to all that sun and other environmental factors, your skin may be particularly dry and perhaps even flakey. Persaud goes on to explain the next step. \"Larger molecules in moisturizers, which sit close to the surface of the skin, lock in serums and provide hydration and nourishment.\" And, as you prep your skin for the fall, Smart stresses that using the correct moisturizer for your skin type is key. \"For normal to dry skin, consider an advanced collagen treatment cream as it delivers deep and lasting hydration, stimulates collagen production and regenerates new skin cells that may have depleted over the summer.\" Burnman adds that fall is a great time to replenish moisture levels and repair the skin's barrier preparing it for the colder months ahead.\n\nKosmea Replenishing Moisture Cream, $54, Well.ca\n\nThe Inkey List Multi-Biotic Moisturizer, $14.99, Shoppers Drug Mart\n\nNneka Elliott (@nnekaelliott) is a lifestyle blogger, host and actor.
