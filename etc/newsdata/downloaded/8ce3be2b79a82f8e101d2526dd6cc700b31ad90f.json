It\u2019s a tricky little card game, where you pick up cards from a board to fight monsters and traverse through dungeons. While I love the game, what also keeps me coming back are memories of Adventure Time.\n\nCard of Darkness was made in part by Pendleton Ward, the creator of Adventure Time, which is a beloved Cartoon Network show that had its finale in September of last year. I remember when I first saw the animated short for Adventure Time that aired on Nicktoons Network prior to the series getting picked up for Cartoon Network.\n\nI was in high school, at my neighbour\u2019s house, and she had incredibly slow internet. She kept gassing me up about how funny it was while the video loaded, and I was sceptical. I was soon proven wrong. This short was irreverent and funny, and at the time, it felt wholly original. It appealed to the part of me that liked \u201crandom\u201d jokes, but it also had an actual logic underpinning the story. It depicted a vibrant, happy world. When I later learned it had been turned into a show two years later, I was overjoyed.\n\nAdventure Time ran for ten seasons, and like any show that runs for as long as that, it got increasingly convoluted. Its world expanded so much that its heroes eventually saw things like distant future of the universe as they went on increasingly epic quests. Eventually, the timeline of the show encompassed several thousands of years. As the show got more complicated, my interest waned. I yearned for the simplicity of the show\u2019s beginnings.\n\nWhile Card of Darkness can become complex to play, its trappings remind me of that initial Adventure Time short that I loved. It\u2019s a simple story of a warrior destined to hold the \u201ccards of darkness,\u201d which are slots you can buy with in-game currency that allow you to equip special powers. The simplicity of the story frees up brainspace for understanding the complicated gameplay.\n\nWhen it comes to the \u201ccards of darkness\u201d that you equip, some make potions that heal you more, others make it less likely for you to be poisoned; there are dozens I haven\u2019t unlocked yet. Using these skills, you traverse dungeons to eventually defeat an ancient evil. While you\u2019re in dungeons, you also pick up weapon cards to defeat enemy cards.\n\nThe board you play on is a grid, and on each grid is a stack of cards. In that stack can be enemies, weapons or potions. If you grab a card from a stack, you have to remove every other card from that stack as well. Enemies that have an odd or even power level can only be damaged by weapons that are odd or even, respectively. Otherwise, your weapon breaks.\n\nThere are dozens of other parameters that affect your ability to succeed; you\u2019ll eventually run into enemies that have special abilities that shuffle them around the board or make their power level higher or lower. It\u2019s a lot to keep track of. I\u2019m just glad I don\u2019t have to open a fan wiki or watch over two hundred episodes of a show to get it.\n\nBeyond that, it\u2019s just nice to see Pendleton Ward\u2019s art again. Your adventurer wears a jaunty pot on his head, which bounces pleasantly as an idle animation in dungeons. When he\u2019s defeated, he flips around and the bottom of his pajamas snap open, revealing his bare buttocks. I missed this particular brand of irreverence, and I\u2019m glad I can now access it when I need to remember the much simpler times of 2008.", "description": "Card of Darkness has been my go-to phone game for about a week.
