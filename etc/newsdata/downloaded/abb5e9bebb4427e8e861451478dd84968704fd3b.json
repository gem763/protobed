So I thought, 'why not freeze it myself?'. It works amazingly well.\"\n\nShe says you can stop the fruit browning in the freezer but only if you follow her instructions, as reported by the Daily Mail.\n\nAfter buying a fresh avocado, cut it in half, take the pit out and slice it or cut it into chunks.\n\nLay it all out on a tray lined with parchment paper and freeze. Remove the frozen slices after one day and put them all into one bag and throw them back in the freezer.\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nFreezing them separately first prevents the pieces of fruit from sticking together and allows you to use it one slice at a time. Genius.\n\nThe mum says they stay green and she throws them in smoothies or lets them thaw and has them in sandwiches.\n\nOther people who had never considered freezing avocados are loving her trick.\n\n\"I had no idea it froze,\" one wrote. \"I hate wasting the left over avocado as no one else eats it in my house.\"\n\nAnother said: \"This will change my life! I bought frozen avocado and it was horrible.\"\n\nA third replied: \"This is the solution to my ever squishy avocado issues.\"", "description": "A crafty mum has revealed her process to follow to stop your avocados going off", "authors": ["Luke Matthews", "Image", "Facebook", "Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20707626.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_THP_CHP_231019SLUG_6895JPG.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
