This is in part due to improvements in police recording, as well as spikes in hate crime following certain events such as the EU referendum and the terrorist attacks of 2017.\n\n\u201cThere is a responsibility on us all to think carefully and be temperate in how we communicate to each other.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to work to bring offenders to justice and to protect our communities from abuse.\n\n\u201cI would encourage anyone who suffers hate crime, or receives a serious threat against them, to report it to the police, either by calling 101 (999 in an emergency) or online through our True Vision website at www.report-it.org.uk.\n\n\u201cPolice will take all reports of threats and abuse seriously, and will act based on the available evidence in their investigation.\u201d\n\nA Home Office spokesman said: \u201cWe are committed to tackling hate crime in all of its forms \u2013 including abuse of disabled people.\n\n\u201cWe welcome the fact that more victims are having the confidence to come forward and report this despicable abuse, and it\u2019s vital that their cases are properly investigated.\u201d", "description": "Data collated by Leonard Cheshire also showed the number of online offences rose by 71% in 2018/19 compared to the previous year", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/07/wire-19478614-1570604014-795_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
