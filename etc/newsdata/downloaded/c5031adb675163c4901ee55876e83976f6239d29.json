Johnson\u2019s deal doesn\u2019t have that clause.\n\nJohnson\u2019s deal also maintains some European Union rules in Northern Ireland, which critics fear could spark sectarian violence.\n\nSaturday\u2019s debate came as tens of thousands marched outside in opposition at a People\u2019s Vote March, demanding a \u201cfinal say\u201d in the vote.\n\nThe People\u2019s Vote campaign organizers are asking supporters to sign a letter to Boris Johnson and other leaders asking them to allow \u201cthe chance to check whether we want to proceed with Brexit.\u201d", "description": "Oct. 19 (UPI) \u2014 The British Parliament held a rare Saturday meeting to possibly vote on Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s deal to exit the", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
