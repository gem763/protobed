The original Caffe Dante first opened on Macdougal Street in 1915, which was then a largely Italian neighbourhood. Dante placed ninth last year and has won numerous awards since the current owners took over in 2015.\n\nTopping the list is Dante in New York's Greenwich Village, which is now owned by a small New York based Australian family.\n\nSecond place went to the luxurious Connaught Bar in London, followed by Florer\u00eda Atl\u00e1ntico in Buenos Aires. Fourth was NoMad, New York, followed by the American Bar, London. The Clumsies, Athens, was sixth; Attaboy, New York, seventh; Atlas, Singapore, eighth; the Old Man, Hong Kong, was ninth; and Licorer\u00eda Limantour, Mexico City, rounded out the Top 10.\n\nFood at Dante.\n\nThe UK leads the 2019 list with 10 bars, while the US has seven: Six in New York and one in San Francisco. Last year\u2019s winner, Dandelyan, closed after founder Ryan Chetiyawardana, also known as Mr Lyan, created a new venue, Lyaness, in the same London space. Lyaness placed at No. 39 this year.
