The fund just hit a 52-week high and is up 34.6% from its 52-week low of $66.58 per share.\n\n\n\nBut are more gains in store for this ETF? Let\u2019s take a quick look at the fund and the near-term outlook on it to get a better idea on where it might be headed.\n\n\n\nIWY in Focus\n\n\n\nThis fund offers exposure to large U.S. companies whose earnings are expected to grow at an above-average rate relative to the market. It has key holdings in information technology while health care, consumer discretionary, and communication round off the next three spots. It charges 20 basis points in annual fees (see: all the Large Cap Growth ETFs here).\n\n\n\nWhy the Move?\n\n\n\nThe growth space of the broad U.S. stock market has been an area to watch lately, given that the S&P 500 hit new all-time highs. The latest rally can be attributed to easing monetary policy and trade deal optimism. Additionally, better-than-expected Q3 corporate earnings also lifted investor sentiment. In particular, growth stocks are leading the rally as these tend to outperform in a trending market (i.e. a market characterized by a prolonged uptrend).\n\n\n\nMore Gains Ahead?\n\n\n\nCurrently, IWY has a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Medium risk outlook, suggesting that the outperformance could continue in the months ahead. Further, many of the segments that make up this ETF have a strong Zacks Industry Rank. So, there is definitely some promise for those who want to ride this surging ETF a little further.\n\n\n\nWant key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox?\n\n\n\nZacks\u2019 free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.
