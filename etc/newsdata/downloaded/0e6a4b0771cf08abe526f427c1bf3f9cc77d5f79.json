Saudi Arabia\u2019s skill in lying is definitely improving, though, from the outright transparent lies about its level of oil reserves, spare capacity, and why the omni-toxic Aramco should nonetheless be valued at US$2 trillion.\n\nIts latest lies - along the lines of \u2018everything is fine after the attacks and we will be back to full production really quickly\u2019 \u2013 are relatively nuanced. \u201cThe Saudi statements may not contain any direct falsehoods as such but nor are they entirely being fulsome with the truth,\u201d Richard Mallinson, senior energy analyst for Energy Aspects, in London, told OilPrice.com last week.\n\nThe stage was set for the Saudis\u2019 latest lying extravaganza with the aerial attacks on its massive Abqaiq oil processing facility and Khurais oil field launched, according to various sources, by Houthi \u2018rebels\u2019 in Yemen or by Iranian operatives in Yemen or in Iran. The effect of the combined attack on Abqaiq and Khurais caused the temporary suspension of 5.7 million barrels per day (bpd). This equates to well over half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s actual crude oil production capacity, not the capacity figure that Saudi has plucked out of nowhere for geopolitical power purposes in recent years, and resulted in the biggest rise in oil prices in a single day ever.\n\nOnce the hedge funds, who had handily positioned themselves long some days before the attacks, had taken their profits, and younger traders remembered that the U.S. can release vast amounts of oil at the drop of a hat from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve to keep the price of oil \u2013 and, crucially ahead of an election year, the highly correlated and politically enormously sensitive gasoline pump price in the U.S. down \u2013 oil prices came down again, obviously.\n\nA number of interesting things happened from the Saudi Arabian side as the prices went up and then went back down again. The first of these, as OilPrice.com was informed repeatedly by senior oil traders throughout the day, was the lack of real understanding that senior Saudi officials seem to have on how the oil market works or any details of Saudi\u2019s own oil industry.\n\n\u201cI used to think the Saudis thought all of us [oil traders] were idiots, with all the rubbish they used to come out with and thought we\u2019d believe, but recently it\u2019s occurred to me that they genuinely don\u2019t know anything about the oil industry, so they don\u2019t understand that other people actually do know what they\u2019re talking about and this has also been one of the reasons for the constant delaying of the Aramco sale, by the way,\u201d one senior oil trader based in Asia told OilPrice.com.\n\nRelated: Millennials Really Do Ruin Everything, And Big Oil Is Next\n\nThe Aramco sale to one side for another time (although OilPrice.com has exclusively previously highlighted all of the lies pertaining to it), one particularly striking comment came from Saudi Arabia\u2019s new oil minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, just after the attacks. He stated that the Kingdom plans to restore its production capacity to 11 million bpd by the end of September and recover its full capacity of 12 million bpd two months later.\n\n\u201cIt was extremely telling that he spoke of \u2018capacity\u2019 and later of \u2018supply to the market\u2019, as these are terms that Saudi tends to use in order to avoid talking about actual production, as capacity and supply are not the same thing at all as actual production at the wellheads,\u201d said Energy Aspects\u2019 Mallinson. \u201cWhat Saudi is trying to do by not revealing the true picture is to protect its reputation as a reliable oil supplier, especially to its target clientele in Asia, so we have to take all of these comments with a hefty pinch of salt,\u201d he added.\n\nSo hefty a pinch of salt as to be mountainous in the case of its capacity and corollary spare capacity figures. The country has stated for decades that it has a spare capacity of between 2.0-2.5 million bpd, implying \u2013 given actual production during virtually all of this time averaging less than 10 million bpd - total production capacity of 12.0-12.5 million bpd. This level, though, or anywhere near it, has never been even remotely tested, with the highest production ever recorded being just over 11 million bpd in November last year.\n\nStory continues", "description": "Saudi Arabia has often manipulated the truth a bit when it comes to exports, production or reserves, and following the attacks on its oil infrastructure, Riyadh\u2019s narrative should be taken with a pinch of salt", "authors": ["Simon Watkins"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo.png", "published_at": "2019-09-23"}
