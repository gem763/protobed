It's bound to fail, this attempt, it's already obvious,\" he said.\n\nThe interview was aired on Sunday ahead of Putin's visit to Saudi Arabia on Oct. 14.", "description": "Putin says Trump not to blame for lack of improvement in Russia-U.S. ties", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9C0DP_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
