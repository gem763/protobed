In the longer term, Germany\u2019s TUI should also benefit from the exit of its biggest rival in Europe\u2019s $47 billion package-holiday market.\n\nTUI has already been leasing planes because of the global grounding of the Boeing (NYSE: ) Co. 737 Max after two fatal crashes, of which it has 15 in the fleet with several more due to have been taken this year.\n\nThe Hanover-based company earlier moved to calm investors after Thomas Cook\u2019s failure, saying in a statement that the summer season is \u201cclosing out in line with expectations,\u201d with its model of owning hotels and cruise ships outright proving resilient.\n\nIndustry Squeeze\n\nJoussen said the market is \u201cstill not where it should be\u201d as the tourism sector is roiled slowing economies, fluctuating oil prices, a strong dollar, uncertainty around Brexit and changing booking patterns in response to warmer summers in northern Europe.\n\nAsked what Thomas Cook\u2019s failure says about the industry, he said that \u201cthose who change will be successful, those who don\u2019t won\u2019t.\u201d European leisure airlines still have too much capacity and with so many external risks in play TUI must be \u201ccareful,\u201d he said.\n\nA TUI spokesman said the company is not interested in Thomas Cook\u2019s Frankfurt-based airline Condor, which is continuing to operate while seeking a buyer. The carrier is set to receive a 380 million-euro ($420 million) bridge loan from the German government, valid for six months, provided that the European Commission approves the plan.\n\nIn contrast, Thomas Cook\u2019s German tour operating arm with the Neckermann Reisen, Oeger Tours and Bucher Reisen brands filed for insolvency, according to a statement Wednesday.\n\nUBS analyst Cristian Nedelcu said in a note Tuesday that any boost to TUI\u2019s profitability and free cash flow could prove to be fleeting as other companies also move to fill the gap left by Thomas Cook within a year or two.\n\nJoussen said he remains hopeful that the Boeing (NYSE: ) Max will return to service this year as the U.S. manufacturer works with regulators on changes to flight-control software blamed for the crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia.", "description": "TUI to Boost Winter Holiday Fleet After Thomas Cook Collapse", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picb379980da14fb12537f763a0e1940fac.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
