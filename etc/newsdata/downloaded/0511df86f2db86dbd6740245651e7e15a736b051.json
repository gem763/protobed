The underwear was stolen about three months ago and the blood sample was taken roughly a month ago, a Kurdish official told NBC.\n\nTrump did thank Syrian Kurds on Sunday for their role in helping to find Baghdadi.\n\nThe president, speaking to the nation from the White House, said the Kurds weren't involved militarily, but did provide 'some information that turned out to be helpful'.\n\nFor many Kurds it wasn't enough of a an acknowledgment, especially after Trump thanked Russia and other nations. Kurdish-led forces have lost 11,000 men and women since they began fighting ISIS five years ago.", "description": "Kurdish intelligence operatives who supervised the informant passed the intelligence on to American forces before they raided Baghdadi's safe house in Syria on Saturday", "authors": ["Ralph R.
