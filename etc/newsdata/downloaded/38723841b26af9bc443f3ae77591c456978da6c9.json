Jeffrey did defend the administration, however, on the basis that Obama and George W Bush had made landmark decisions in the region without running it by his predecessors.\n\nRomney asked Jeffrey if it was wrong to conclude that \u201cErdogan basically said, \u2018We\u2019re coming in. Get out of the way,\u2019 and America blinked.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t that we got out of the way because we were not militarily in the way,\u201d Jeffrey answered, insisting that Erdogan's offensive was \u201cabsolutely\u201d unrelated to the withdrawal.\n\n(Sha Hanting/Getty)\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really know why we have someone with the title special representative for Syria engagement and special envoy to the global coalition to defeat Isis if they are not consulted before the president takes the most significant single action affecting US interests in Syria and the future of Isis during his presidency and I think it speaks to the utter chaos of American foreign policy,\u201d commented senator Chris Murphy.\n\nWell, quite.\n\nDmitry Peskov, who reacted to Jeffrey's comments as the Mike Pence came to an end by saying the US had betrayed and abandoned the Kurds and advised them to retreat from the Syrian border - as per a deal between Moscow and Ankara - or be mauled by the Turkish army. The only person more damning on the subject was Kremlin spokesman, who reacted to Jeffrey's comments as the five-day ceasefire agreed by vice presidentcame to an end by saying the US had betrayed and abandoned the Kurds and advised them to retreat from the Syrian border - as per a deal between Moscow and Ankara - or be mauled by the Turkish army.\n\n\"The United States has been the Kurds' closest ally in recent years. In the end, it abandoned the Kurds and, in essence, betrayed them,\" the Russian said. \"Now [the Americans] prefer to leave the Kurds at the border and almost force them to fight the Turks.\"", "description": "Bill Taylor, acting US ambassador to Ukraine, told the House impeachment inquiry on Tuesday he was informed military aid to the country was \u201cdependent\u201d on president Volodymyr Zelensky agreeing to publicly announce a corruption probe into Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 rival Joe Biden, confirming the existence of the suspected quid pro quo at the heart of the Democratic-led investigation.", "authors": ["Joe Sommerlad"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/23/08/donald-trump.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
