There have also been repeated threats to dig into committee members\u2019 personal lives and expose any embarrassing discoveries.\"\n\n\"Two days after my mother\u2019s passing, WP10 members, aware of my tragedy, included me in a harassing and unnecessary email. I answered their mail, and asked that I be left to grieve. They did not leave me. They continued.\"\n\nTaylor had previously charged that he had been ordered, by WP10 to \"remove the incredibly dedicated chairman of a pro-bono committee without process or evidence, purely because a small group of men said so\".\n\nHe called for past Bishops alum to attend the SGM in their numbers to support him and his committee, which garnered a lots of support on social media.\n\n'Appalling'\n\n\"My committee and I have not accepted this\u2026 They have employed what I can only describe as the most appalling programme of harassment, disingenuity, and abuse I have ever had the misfortune of experiencing,\" Taylor charged.\n\nNews24 understands that some of Taylor's claims were challenged as \"lies\" on Thursday evening, to applause from some sections of the SGM.\n\nBefore the motion could be tabled, it emerged that such an outcome could be avoided if the two factions accepted reconciliatory terms.\n\nTaylor confirmed to News24 that \"the motion of no confidence was withdrawn and there was a resolution put in place towards reconciliation\".\n\nPart of the terms agreed on by both parties is that the incumbent union will remain; a sub-committee with members decided upon from both sides will be formed to focus on reconciliation.\n\nA representative of the WP10 had told TimesLive that the matter was an internal one, so they wouldn't be commenting.\n\nGET THE NEWS at your fingertips and download the News24 app for Android here now.
