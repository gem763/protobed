This is the latest remake of a classic black \u201890s crime drama. According to Deadline, Warner Bros. is planning to reboot the 1991 gangster noir New Jack City with a screenplay written by Snowfall star Malcolm M. Mays. The original film, directed by and co-starring Mario Van Peebles, featured Wesley Snipes as Harlem drug kingpin Nino Brown. Ice-T and Judd Nelson portrayed the loose-cannon cops tasked with taking him down, while Chris Rock, Vanessa Williams and Allen Payne rounded out the cast of New York characters caught up in Nino\u2019s web of money, power and violence. The film also features Wesley Snipes in some insanely good outfits, an element which Warner Bros., if they\u2019re smart, will obviously prioritize.", "description": "Warner Bros. is reportedly planning a movie remake of the 1991\u2019s gangster noir film New Jack City, starring Wesley Snipes, Ice-T and Chris Rock.", "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/08/26/23-New-Jack-City.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-24"}
