Had Davis worn the headband a second time after the first fine, he would've have been hit with a $14,000 fine. That kept him away from wearing the headband in Sunday's 12-10 win over the Dallas Cowboys.\n\n\u201cOf course you don't want to be fined,\u201d Davis told the newspaper of the fine that came after the game against the Seattle Seahawks. \u201cNobody wants to lose money but I think any time that the conversation about God is brought up, especially in these times, I think it's always a positive or silver lining. If he can get glory from it, I think he can get glory from it whether I personally wear the headband or don't wear the headband. He's always gonna be in control of the whole situation. We're still all good.\u201d\n\nNow Davis is hoping to sell the headbands and donate the proceeds to a Christian charity. He added: \"I'm hoping to put it out where fans can wear it, and I can wear it through them.\"\n\nDavis has recorded 28 total tackles, two tackles for loss and a quarterback hit in four starts this season.", "description": "Saints LB\u00a0Demario Davis spoke about the NFL fine he received for wearing a black headband with \"Man of God\" written across it in Week 3.", "authors": ["Scott Gleeson", "Published P.M.
