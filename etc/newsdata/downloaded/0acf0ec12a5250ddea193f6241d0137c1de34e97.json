Hence, we cannot react to their personal decisions,\" he said, according to Bernama.\n\nMalaysia on Tuesday said it would consider increasing imports of raw sugar and buffalo meat from India, as it looked to quell trade tensions.\n\nSources had told Reuters that New Delhi was considering curbing imports in response to Mahathir's remarks at the U.N. general assembly last month, when he said India had \"invaded and occupied\" Kashmir, a disputed Muslim-majority region also claimed by Pakistan.\n\nIn August, India stripped its portion of the Kashmir valley of statehood and autonomy, clamped down on communications and carried out mass arrests.", "description": "Malaysia says will work diplomatically with India if palm oil imports curbed", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9F0HQ_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
