I've got a great idea.'\n\nNow, producer Michael Deeley has revealed how he planned for an even more dramatic cliff-hanger, one that would've been resolved in a sequel.\n\nCroker, played by Michael Caine, and his gang in the ending of The Italian Job as their coach teeters over an Alpine ledge with their stolen gold on the other side\n\nThe British classic ends with the van teetering over the edge and the movie's producer has now revealed the ending would have been resolved in a sequel\n\nThe follow-up movie was never filmed, however.\n\nIn the more dramatic ending, Deeley said there'd be a helicopter noise, drawing closer to the gang.\n\nHe added: 'Suddenly there's a jerk underneath and the bus starts rising up far enough that the gold can slide out the front and the people can slide out the front.\n\n'You cut upside and see two helicopters with a cable underneath the bus lifting everybody up. But of course, waiting outside is the mafia. That's how it ends.'\n\nDeeley made the revelations at the The Times and The Sunday Times Cheltenham Literature Festival, and also admitted his disappointment at the lack of a sequel.\n\nThough its opening scene had been written and approved by the film studio, nothing was ever filmed, despite Deeley saying he was 'very happy' with the idea of a sequel.\n\nIt is believed that the lack of sequel to The Italian Job was because of its poor reviews and performance in the US.\n\nHowever, Deeley said that this bad performance was partly because of a poster used to advertise the movie across the Atlantic.\n\nThe Italian Job celebrated its 50th anniversary this year, after being released in 1969, and is considered one of the best British films ever\n\nIn 2017, The Italian Job came top of a 2017 poll, just ahead of The Full Monty and Zulu, in which Caine also starred, inviting cinema-goers to name the greatest British film ever made\n\nThe poster showed Caine with a cup of tea while holding a machine gun and sitting opposite a topless woman.\n\nDeeley said: 'I was shocked. It showed Michael Caine with a cup of tea because he's English, which is boring. He had a sub-machinegun, which suggested action but really suggested killing.'\n\nHe said the poster couldn't have represented the movie any worse.\n\nThe Italian Job celebrated its 50th anniversary this year, after being released in 1969.\n\nInitial reviews in the UK were lukewarm and downright negative in the US but the film is now considered the quintessential British crime caper and perhaps the definitive Sixties movie.\n\nIt has one of the most famous car chases in cinema history, as the crooks, led by Caine, make their daring escape through Turin in red, white and blue Mini Coopers.\n\nThe rebuke delivered by Caine's character Charlie Croker, 'You're only supposed to blow the bloody doors off', has been voted the best movie one-liner of all time and has been referenced in songs and movies ever since.\n\nIn 2017, The Italian Job came top of a 2017 poll, just ahead of The Full Monty and Zulu, in which Caine also starred, inviting cinema-goers to name the greatest British film ever made.\n\nThough it never had a sequel, a remake was released in 2003 starring Mark Wahlberg and Jason Statham.\n\nThe director described the remake as a 'homage' to the original and it received positive reviews from critics.", "description": "Michael Deeley, the producer of The Italian Job, has revealed that the movie's famous cliff-hanger ending was supposed to be even more dramatic before being resolved in a sequel.", "authors": ["Danyal Hussain For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/09/19386210-0-image-a-10_1570437589820.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
