He went at the flag and found the water on the par-5 16th for a bogey to lose the lead for the first time all day.\n\nRight when he looked to be out of chances, Na saved himself with a 25-foot par putt on the 17th, a 10-foot birdie to extend the playoff, and he won the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open when Patrick Cantlay made the worst mistake - the last one.\n\n\u201cCame down way too close,\u201d Na said.\n\nCantlay, who gave up a one-shot lead by hitting 9-iron into the water on the par-3 17th, three-putted from 45 feet on No. 18 on the second extra hole for bogey. Na rolled in his 4-foot par putt to win in Las Vegas for the second time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been in this situation before where I lost the lead and I failed many times,\u201d said Na, who closed with a 1-under 70. \u201cI\u2019ve lost three playoffs. This is my first playoff win. I kept telling myself, \u2018This is the playoff I\u2019m going to win.\u2019 It felt great to win.\u201d\n\nIt was a bitter finish for Cantlay, who won his first PGA Tour event in Las Vegas in 2017 in a playoff, but had to settle for a runner-up finish the second straight year.\n\n\u201cIt leaves a sour taste in my mouth,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s two years in a row here. I played well. I\u2019ll take that momentum the rest of the year.\u201d\n\nCantlay took his first lead with a two-putt birdie on the 16th, only for his 9-iron to come up short and just far enough to the left that rolled down into the water. He still looked as though he would head to the final hole until Na made his 25-foot par putt.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a fighter,\u201d Na said. \u201cThe putt on 17, I was doing everything I could to make that putt.\u201d\n\nNa won for the third time in the last 15 months, and third in as many seasons on the PGA Tour. He joined Jim Furyk as the only multiple winners in Las Vegas.\n\nEven after his bogey on the 17th, Cantlay was poised to win in regulation when he hit the longest drive of the final round - 345 yards - and had only 113 yards left. But he could get no closer than 25 feet, and his putt hung on the right edge of the putt.\n\nCantlay, trying to win for the third time when facing a deficit of at least three shots, closed with a 68.\n\nThey finished at 23-under 261.\n\nOn the first extra hole, Na hit wedge to just inside 10 feet. Cantlay was just outside 10 feet - on the same line as his 25-foot birdie chance in regulation - and made it. Na poured his in, walking toward the hole before the ball dropped.\n\nCantlay came up well short on his approach to the 18th on the second playoff hole - his third time playing it in less than an hour - and his birdie putt came up well short.\n\nNa set a record by making 559 feet of putts over four rounds, the most since the PGA Tour developed its ShotLink system of measuring every shot of every player. And he won with a 4-foot par.\n\nPat Perez closed with a 68 to finish alone in third, his best finish since he won in Malaysia two years ago.\n\nDefending champion Bryson DeChambeau shot 63 and tied for fourth with Adam Hadwin (63) and Brian Stuard (67).\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Kevin Na finally won a sudden-death playoff on the PGA Tour when he least expected it.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/06/shriners_hospitals_golf_71710_c0-115-2800-1747_s1770x1032.jpg?f4d2c811476b0c4e72710b266146fd2a0e985c7d", "published_at": "2019-10-06"}
