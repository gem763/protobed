New York had the third-largest outflows of any state, with 452,580 people moving out within the past year.\n\nSpeiss added that the trend will have a detrimental effect on the economies of states that are losing residents \u2013 like New York and New Jersey \u2013 with the potential to impact everything from housing markets to construction industries to funding for schools.\n\n\u201cThis has some pretty broad implications,\u201d Speiss said.\n\nHowever, the bad news could extend beyond individuals deciding to abandon their homes for lower-tax states.\n\n\u201cI think it could have problematic effects not only because of outgoing people, but [the ruling could also be] problematic in terms of recruiting people to come into high-tax states,\u201d Tom Corrie, principal and director of Friedman LLP\u2019s state and local tax group, told FOX Business.\n\nFor someone considering accepting a position in a state like New York, Corrie noted that it draws attention to the fact that people will be subject to the high taxes (property, sales and otherwise), without much opportunity for relief.\n\n\u201cStates are rightly worried that it can have effects on their economies,\u201d Corrie said, noting that with people leaving \u2013 and others rethinking moving in \u2013 economies can stagnate.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has been outspoken about the effects of the SALT cap on the New York economy. Cuomo has said he expects the cap on state and local tax deductions to have a negative impact on the state\u2019s population \u2013 and tax receipts. He blamed a $2.3 billion budget deficit on the new tax law, calling the state\u2019s financial situation \u201cas serious as a heart attack\u201d as wealthy residents leave.\n\nHowever, whether states like New York will enact any reforms of their own to combat the problem remains to be seen.\n\n\u201cEverybody wants their cake and [to] eat it, too, so they\u2019re not going to address the problem and as a result you\u2019re going to continue to see more migration into Texas, Florida, Tennessee, Washington,\u201d former Heinz CEO Bill Johnson told FOX Business Neil Cavuto on Monday. \u201cFor the life of me I can\u2019t figure out why this is such a difficult concept to grasp.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, some financial experts say Monday\u2019s ruling is unlikely to change moving plans since people have already seen how the tax law will affect their finances.\n\nJoe Pizzimenti, a tax director specializing in state and local tax services at Margolin, Winer & Evens, told FOX Business that most people who were considering changing domiciles were likely getting excellent advice from professionals and probably had already made a decision.\n\nBill Smith, managing director of CBIZ MHM\u2019s National Tax Office, agreed, saying he thinks most people would assume the law wouldn\u2019t be changed.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nA judge dismissed the lawsuit filed in July 2018 by New York, New Jersey, Maryland and Connecticut on Monday, finding the implementation of the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions did not exceed Congress\u2019 taxation authority because it was neither \u201can unconstitutional assault on states\u2019 sovereign choices\u201d nor unconstitutionally coercive.\n\nCuomo along with New York\u2019s Attorney General suggested that the state may appeal the ruling \u2013 an outcome multiple sources told FOX Business was likely.", "description": "Experts caution ruling could cause more pain in the economies of high-tax states.", "authors": ["Brittany De Lea"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/09/0/0/bank-of-america-tower-001Getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
