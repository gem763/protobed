I can't wait to see my grandson again'\n\n'We've been treated horribly by the authorities in America. I thought the Americans were supposed to be friendly with the British but I saw no evidence of it.\n\n'The detention centre was freezing cold and the food was disgusting. The only thing I could eat was tuna.\n\n'My baby got a cold in there and I wasn't even allowed to give him teething salt because the sachets were confiscated.\n\n'We weren't allowed to smoke for two weeks either or have fizzy drinks.\n\n'My hands are trembling, I've been a nervous wreck but we're back now where we belong - with friends and family.\n\n'There were a few nice members of staff at the centre, our case worker Mary Shah and another worker called Nath. They were both lovely.\n\n'But I'm glad I'm out of the place, it was absolutely awful. So run down.\n\n'My biggest regret is that we are now banned from America for at least five years - even the kids.\n\n'I went to Disneyland as a child all the time and I want the same for my kids.
