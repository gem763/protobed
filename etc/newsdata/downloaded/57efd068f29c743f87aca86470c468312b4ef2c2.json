Obviously, inclusion of these pink portions would have thrown off the nice, flat \"shaft\" of the stick, while also revealing that this particular group of \"proxies\" had totally failed at matching the twentieth century rise in temperatures derived from the thermometer record, thus undermining the whole idea that these were valid proxies at all. In other words, Mann et al. had truncated inconvenient data that failed to match the narrative they wanted to present. Most would call this kind of data truncation a clearcut instance of \"scientific fraud.\"\n\nThis was the state of play in early 2011 when Ball uttered his famous line, \u201cMichael Mann belongs in the State Pen, not Penn State.\u201d Mann then immediately sued Ball for libel.\n\nNow, as readers here know, I spent my life in the litigation business. My practice was in the U.S. rather than Canada, but I have good reason to think that many of the basic ground rules would be the same. And one of the basic ground rules is that a plaintiff in civil litigation needs to provide \u201cdiscovery\u201d to the defendant of whatever factual information is in his possession that would either support or undermine his claims. When Mann brought his case, I was frankly amazed, because it was obvious to me that Ball would request as \u201cdiscovery\u201d the very data and methods that Mann had been aggressively resisting giving to anyone to check his work. How could Mann\u2019s case survive if he refused to provide this information?\n\nSure enough Mann absolutely refused to provide the underlying information in the Ball litigation. For better or worse, when a litigant does that, a court will try every possible avenue to try to get the parties to resolve the matter, before it will take the ultimate step of resolving the case against the non-compliant litigant. And that is in fact what happened in the Mann/Ball case. The court repeatedly tried to get an agreement that something would be produced that would satisfy Ball, and repeatedly gave Mann more time to comply. Could this really go on for eight years? In the U.S., that would be extraordinary, but not impossible. Maybe in Canada it is less extraordinary. It appears that in 2017 Mann actually agreed (under court pressure) to produce to Ball within 21 days the key technical information about construction of the Hockey Stick graph that Ball was requesting. But the information was not produced. Undoubtedly there have been multiple returns by Ball to the court since then to enforce compliance, finally seeking the dismissal of Mann\u2019s claims as the ultimate sanction. On Friday, the court granted that relief.\n\nHere\u2019s a twist that is simply beyond belief. On February 17, 2018, the American Association for the Advancement of Science \u2014 the largest professional association of scientists in the world, claiming to have more than 120,000 members \u2014 gave its supposedly prestigious \u201cPublic Engagement with Science\u201d award to none other than Michael Mann. Here is its announcement of the award. Some choice excerpts:\n\nThe honor recognizes Mann\u2019s \u201ctireless efforts to communicate the science of climate change to the media, public and policymakers.\u201d In the past year, Mann has had 500 media interviews and appearances and directly reached public audiences via social media. . . . He has also advised actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who spoke about climate change during a 2014 speech delivered to the United Nations.\n\nThe AAAS did this in the face of the clear demonstration of Mann\u2019s misconduct from the ClimateGate revelations, and in the face of Mann\u2019s ongoing obstruction of proper discovery in the Ball litigation. This whole \u201cclimate\u201d thing is truly unbelievable in how it warps the minds of seemingly sane people.\n\nAnyway, the bottom line is that, after eight long years, Mann\u2019s lawsuit against Ball has been dismissed \u201cwith prejudice\u201d \u2014 meaning that he has no right to reinstitute the case. Also, the court has said that it will award at least some \u201ccosts\u201d to Ball, although the amount has not yet been determined. Presumably, written opinions and a final judgment will follow, and I will update this post with links to those if and when I receive them. I would expect some triumphant claims of vindication from Ball and his supporters. In light of the court\u2019s decision, Mann will be severely constrained in what he can do in response. Hey \u2014 why not produce your data and methods?\n\nWill any of this embarrass or rein in the likes of the IPCC, the AAAS, or any of the many mainstream climate-hoax-promoting outlets that continue to publish Mann\u2019s screeds? (Examples: New York Times, USA Today, Washington Post). Don't bet on it. As of today, I can\u2019t even find any coverage of the court result in any \u201cmainstream\u201d outlet.\n\nMeanwhile, note that this is only a trial court decision. Theoretically, Mann can appeal, and an appeals court might send this back. On the other hand, it\u2019s hard to imagine that, even if an appeals court reverses and sends the case back, that it won\u2019t condition further proceedings on Mann producing his data and methods. I can\u2019t believe that he will ever do that. The only fair inference at this point is that the Hockey Stick is and always was a scientific fraud.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "description": "The Michael Mann \u201cHockey Stick\u201d is suddenly back in the news. It\u2019s been so \r\nlong since we have heard from it, do you even remember what it is?\r\n\r\nThe \u201cHockey Stick\u201d is the graph that took the world of climate science by \r\nstorm back in 1998. That\u2019s when Mann and co-authors Raymond Bradley and \r\nMalcolm Hughes published in Nature their seminal paper \u201cGlobal-scale \r\ntemperature patterns and climate forcing over the past six centuries.\u201d A \r\nsubsequent 1999 update by the same authors, also in Nature (\u201cNorthern \r\nHemisphere Temperatures During the Past Millennium: Inferences, \r\nUncertainties, and Limitations\u201d) extended their reconstructions of \r\n\u201ctemperature patterns and climate forcing\u201d back another 400 years to about \r\nthe year 1000. The authors claimed (in the first paragraph of the 1998 \r\narticle) to \u201ctake a new statistical approach to reconstructing global \r\npatterns of annual temperature . . . , based on the calibration of \r\nmultiproxy data networks by the dominant patterns of temperature \r\nvariability in the instrumental record.\u201d The claimed \u201cnew statistical \r\napproach,\u201d when applied to a group of temperature \u201cproxies\u201d that included \r\ntree ring samples and lake bed sediments, yielded a graph \u2014 quickly labeled \r\nthe \u201cHockey Stick\u201d \u2014 that was the perfect icon to sell global warming fear \r\nto the public. The graph showed world temperatures essentially flat or \r\nslightly declining for 900+ years (the shaft of the hockey stick), and then \r\nshooting up dramatically during the 20th century era of human carbon \r\ndioxide emissions (the blade of the stick).\r\n\r\nIn 2001 the UN\u2019s IPCC came out with its Third Assessment Report on the \r\nstate of the climate. . . .", "authors": ["Francis Menton"], "top_image": "http://static1.squarespace.com/static/503a5bade4b0b543ed240317/503a5bade4b0b543ed24032c/5d644c4cc1dc430001968d2d/1566928009883/Manns-hockey-stick.gif?format=1500w"}
