Photo: Roy Rochlin/Getty Images for MTV\n\nSome things don\u2019t belong on Instagram. TikToks for one, and cringey make-outs for two. The internet already lost the battle against bad kisses, with Lily-Rose Depp and Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\u2019s wide kiss haunting our feeds earlier in the week. Now, \u201cSe\u00f1orita\u201d singers Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello are doubling down. The new couple really trolled the haters, really got \u2018em last night when they posted a video of how they \u201cactually\u201d make out. But instead of being normal and just kissing, they tried to be funny and performed the nastiest kiss known to man. Who wanted this? It\u2019s even worse than the washing-machine-syndrome kiss from Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging. And the whole world is the friend who just has to stand there awkwardly and watch.\n\n\u201cWe saw, like, on Twitter and stuff you guys saying stuff about the way we were kissing, and how it looks weird, like we kiss like fish,\u201d Mendes said in the clip. \u201cWe just wanna show you how we really kiss.\u201d Logic long gone, they share a tongue-filled, saliva-heavy kiss, then the video ends. Turns out we were all on a prank show. But hasn\u2019t summer 2019 been nothing but watching Camila Cabello and Shawn Mendes make out all over the world? We already know \u2026 how they kiss. And we stood by them. Streamed Se\u00f1orita. Watched the MTV Video Music Awards. This is how you repay us? A nightmarish make out fake-out? Jokes on them, because Twitter has already turned their prank into a roast.
