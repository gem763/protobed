No other information sought by the families will be released by the FBI.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view.

Those people allegedly helped two of the hijackers in California to obtain driver's licenses, to find housing, and with other matters.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.
