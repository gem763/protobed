Moved by his exploit, Queen Alexandra presented Pietri with a gilded silver cup and he became an international celebrity.\n\nThat race, which started in Windsor and ended at White City, was the first time the marathon \u2014 previously around 40km-long \u2014 was run at 42.195km, with an extra 385 yards (352 metres) added to set the finish line in front of the royal box.\n\nThis would become fixed as its official distance and Hayes\u2019 time of 2hrs 55mins 18secs was the first official world record.\n\n\u2013 1960: Barefoot Bikila stuns world \u2013\n\nEthiopia\u2019s Abebe Bikila became an international sporting icon at the 1960 Rome Olympics, running barefoot to victory on his way to setting a new world record of 2hrs 15min 16sec and making history as the first African to win the Olympic marathon.\n\nBikila twice passed the Obelisk of Axum \u2014 erected opposite the Circus Maximus in 1937 after it was taken from Ethiopia by the Fascist regime \u2014 and raced up an ancient Appian Way lit by Italian soldiers holding torches on his way to finishing at the Arch of Constantine just by the Colosseum.\n\nHe was nearly 28 when he won the marathon, which was staged in the late afternoon and evening due to the punishing late summer heat.\n\nThe former soldier, and member of the imperial bodyguard of ruler Haile Selassie, retained his title four years later in Tokyo \u2014 he was the first person to win two Olympic marathons \u2013 and paved the way for an era of African distance running dominance.\n\n\u2013 1967: Women join the pack \u2013\n\nEver since Stamata Revithi was prevented from running in the 1896 Olympics, women were banned from taking part in marathons, officially for reasons of health and feminity.\n\nBut in 1967 a 20-year-old journalism student, Kathrine Switzer, defied the ban and ran in the Boston marathon, becoming the first woman officially to complete the course.\n\nShe gained entry by registering as KV Switzer and was issued race number 261. On seeing her during the race, one organiser tried to remove her bib and expel her but was prevented by her coach and her partner, a hammer thrower.\n\nThe scene was captured by a photographer and travelled the world, turning Switzer into a feminist icon.\n\nFired by anger and a desire to show that women could run the distance, Switzer completed the race in 4hrs 20mins.\n\nThe Boston marathon was officially opened to women in 1972 and in 1984 women ran the Olympic marathon for the first time.\n\nSwitzer won the New York marathon in 1974 and in 2017, at the age of 70, she returned to Boston. Again wearing bib number 261, she finished in 4hrs 44mins 31secs.\n\n\u2013 2018: Record smashed \u2013\n\nOn a flat course and with a finish line at the Brandenburg Gate, the Berlin marathon has gained a reputation as the ideal circuit for setting new world records.\n\nEliud Kipchoge did just that in September 2018 with a lightning quick time of 2hrs 1min 39secs, smashing Dennis Kimetto\u2019s previous record by an astonishing 78 seconds.\n\nThe Kenyan had taken inspiration from a run he made in May 2017 when he clocked 2hrs 25secs on a special track at the Monza National Autodrome in Italy.\n\nIt was the fastest run over the marathon distance but because of the time trial tactics used it is not recognised by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).\n\nKipchoge will try again to break the two-hour barrier in Vienna on Saturday.", "description": "Paris (AFP) \u2013 First run in Athens in 1896 in just under three hours, the marathon has become the classic challenge for thousands of runners around", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/10/fe9acb_spyridon-louis-her-in-photo-held-by-his-grandson-won-marathon-inugural-modern-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
