And while his main challenger is Andrew Scheer\u2019s Conservative Party, it's the reaction of left-leaning voters that will decide Trudeau's fate.\n\nStill, the truth is that despite the damage the photos and videos are doing to Trudeau's reputation, Canada's Liberal Party is beholden to him.\n\nIn fact, it might not even exist without him. Once a mighty electoral machine that dominated Canadian politics, the center-left party had more recently become a rusted shell sputtering toward irrelevance, having lost 80 percent of its seats over the course of four elections.\n\nPOLITICO Pro Canada Be the first to know about significant political and policy developments that impact the world's most significant bilateral relationship, with alerts and analysis arriving directly to your inbox.

The attention he commanded put his Liberals back on voters' radar, catapulting them from third place to power in one single election in 2015.\n\n\u201cHe saved their bacon,\u201d said Conrad Winn, a pollster and political-science professor at Carleton University.\n\nOn Thursday, Trudeau repeatedly apologized for appearing in brownface in a yearbook photo two decades ago and expressed shame over two other blackface incidents that came to light within one devastating 24-hour period.\n\nLawmakers from his own party defended him in clipped sentences.\n\nThose running for reelection said little, other than insisting there\u2019s no talk of removing their leader: \u201cNot a chance,\u201d said one Ontario MP, who asked to remain anonymous.\n\nWhile in theory the Liberal Party constitution allows it to drop Trudeau as a leader and organize a hasty replacement, the practical reality of organizing a leadership contest and, within four weeks, rebuilding a campaign around a new leader puts the chances of that option at nearly zero.\n\nOne of the Liberal Party\u2019s handful of black MPs said people he\u2019s talked to will judge Trudeau by his entire track record and ultimately forgive him. But he said it won\u2019t be easy.\n\n\"There was a lot of confusion and hurt last night by the black community,\" MP Greg Fergus told an Ottawa campaign event, according to CTV News. \"It\u2019s going to be rough, people are feeling hurt.\u201d\n\nOne Liberal MP who is not running for reelection was far more cutting in her criticism. Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who has clashed publicly with Trudeau in the past, ripped into him.\n\n\u201cJ-sus Chr!st! The privilege continues. There is no excuse for this. Apology is a first step,\u201d the departing MP tweeted. She told The Globe and Mail that the incident leaves Liberal voters with a dilemma.\n\nTrudeau now faces two electoral threats.\n\nOne is that progressive voters stay home out of disgust, reducing the unprecedented youth and progressive turnout that elected Trudeau in the first place.\n\nThe other danger is that those same voters end up switching parties and splitting the left-of-center vote.\n\nOne local-level Liberal organizer confided his own fear that the left-wing NDP might now draw in protest votes against Trudeau.\n\nThe NDP\u2019s leader is the son of Indian immigrants, Jagmeet Singh, who responded to this week\u2019s news by speaking both personally and emotionally about the sting of racism felt by members of his community.\n\nThe Liberals will plead with wayward voters to urgently reenter the fold, warning them that anything but a vote for Trudeau will help elect Conservatives.\n\nIt\u2019s the same election message Liberals use in every election \u2014 and it's worked in the past, said David Moscrop, a political theorist, author and social-science researcher at the University of Ottawa.\n\n\u201cI still think the Liberals have a reasonable chance of forming government,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps even a [parliamentary] majority.\u201d\n\nOne wild card, he said, is the reaction in French-speaking Quebec. It\u2019s a critical province and commentators there have brushed off similar scandals as an over-reaction by English-speaking Canadians.\n\nMoscrop noted that a new Celine Dion show ranked higher on several Quebec newspaper fronts Thursday than Trudeau\u2019s scandal.\n\nIt\u2019s also incredibly rare for a sitting prime minister to be pushed out after one term.\n\nIt\u2019s been decades since a one-term leader lost a reelection bid. And the last time a sitting Canadian prime minister was forced out by his own party without a drawn-out struggle was 1896.\n\nBut Trudeau\u2019s star power among progressives is now perhaps irredeemably faded, Moscrop said.\n\n\u201cIn almost Greek tragic fashion, he ultimately built himself up and reached a perch all the higher from which to fall,\u201d Moscrop said. \u201cHe comes back to Earth, like every politician does. And this is truly a new low.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis article tagged under: Canada\n\nRace\n\nJustin Trudeau", "description": "Two party lawmakers and three un-elected party officials argued to POLITICO that there was no chance of Trudeau being dumped as leader.", "authors": ["Alexander Panetta"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/30/21/641dfa9c46c193896392dd86b3d0/190919-trudeau-getty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
