The call, for which the transcript may not be complete, is merely one element of a whistleblower complaint that involves multiple events and no single communication, as the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general, Michael Atkinson, said last week.\n\nThis is the highest-profile event involving Mr Trump and Ukraine, but there will be other unknown elements.\n\nBut what can we glean from the partial transcript of the call? Below are extracts of what was said and what might have been meant.\n\nPresident Trump: \u201cCongratulations on a great victory. We all watched from the United States and you did a terrific job. The way you came from behind, somebody who wasn\u2019t given much of a chance, and you ended up winning easily. It\u2019s a fantastic achievement. Congratulations.\u201d\n\nThe US president begins by congratulating Mr Zelensky on his recent electoral successes. Enjoying his own unlikely victory in 2016, Mr Trump is always quick to congratulate those who he thinks have followed his example. Having dabbled in the world of entertainment himself, Mr Trump likely appreciates Mr Zelensky\u2019s background as a comedian and actor. This early use of pleasantries sets the tone for the rest of the call.\n\nPresident Zelensky: \u201cWell yes, to tell you the truth, we are trying to work hard because we wanted to drain the swamp here in our country.\u201d\n\nMr Zelensky is actually the first to mention corruption, not Mr Trump . Use of the Trump-coined phrase \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d is indicative of a leader trying to get on Mr Trump\u2019s good side. Mr Zelensky calls Mr Trump \u201ca great teacher\u201d for Ukraine when it comes to creating a new type of politics.\n\nRead more\n\nRead the Trump-Ukraine incomplete \u2018transcript\u2019 in full\n\nPresident Trump: \u201cI will say that we do a lot for Ukraine. We spend a lot of effort and a lot of time. Much more than the European countries are doing and they should be helping you more than they are\u201d\n\nThis is the start of the key paragraphs. Mr Trump drops from discussion of the \u201cswamp\u201d to how much the US does for Ukraine. While there is no explicit quid pro quo when it comes to discussion of an investigation of Joe Biden and his son Hunter later in the call, Mr Trump mentions very strongly that Kiev is relying on Washington more than European nations.\n\nThe reasons why the new document cannot be seen as a full transcript More", "description": "The memorandum of the phone call between Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on 25 July that triggered an impeachment investigation into the incumbent of the White House has only served to convince his opponents they were right to do so.Mr Trump is adamant that he has done no wrong", "authors": ["Chris Stevenson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/AUqx.FYo2EZWS3YTvRMMkA--~B/aD0zOTU7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/05b8c625c9cf315dde22aca391e9804c", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
