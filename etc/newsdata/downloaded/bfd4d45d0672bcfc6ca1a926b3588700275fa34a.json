So far it has managed to cling to support above $8,000 but a big move could be coming soon so which way will it go next?\n\nBitcoin Trading Range Tightens\n\nAnother day has seen Bitcoin bounce between $8,300 and $8,400 as the range bound channel begins to tighten up. According to Tradingview.com BTC is currently within this range at $8,340 since the big dump on Friday.\n\nRSI is right on 50 on the four hour chart but below it on the daily. That death cross of the 50 day MA and 200 day MA is looming ever closer and could occur in about a week, especially if the breakout is to the low side.\n\nTrader \u2018CryptoHamster\u2019 has observed the sideways channel on the 50% Fibonacci retracement level which is also a signal of a bigger move approaching.\n\n\u201c$BTC will either go above the previous trading zone and 23.6% Fibo, where a lot of shorts stops are concentrated, or BTC will go below the previous trading zone and 61.8% Fibo, where a lot of the longs stops are concentrated.\u201d\n\nSimple:$BTC will either go above the previous trading zone and 23.6% Fibo, where a lot of shorts stops are concentrated, or\n\nBTC will go below the previous trading zone and 61.8% Fibo, where a lot of the longs stops are concentrated.\n\nLet's follow the trend.$BTCUSD #bitcoin pic.twitter.com/GB7f9kxHPv \u2014 CryptoHamster (@CryptoHamsterIO) October 13, 2019\n\nStating that Bitcoin will \u2018either go up or down\u2019 is pretty obvious but where will it stop is more interesting. On the high side the 23.6% Fibo shows resistance at just below $8,600 while a drop lower to the 61.8% line takes it back to $8,200.\n\nBelow that is further support at $8k then $7.8k. At the moment BTC has corrected 40 percent from the 2019 high and is holding ground. Market dominance has failed to regain 70 percent and is currently just below it according to Tradingview.com.\n\nElsewhere on Crypto Markets\n\nThe majority of the altcoins are showing red this Sunday though losses are minor as they also follow big brother\u2019s consolidation. Ethereum has weakened again in a fall back towards $180. ETH is unlikely to decouple from BTC until major network upgrades in Istanbul and early Serenity phases are rolled out in a few months\u2019 time.\n\nRipple\u2019s XRP has remained flat for the past few days but it has managed to hold on to previous gains keeping the token around $0.275. Bitcoin Cash has weakened again allowing Tether to retake fourth spot with a larger market cap and Litecoin has shown very little movement from its $55 price level.\n\nToday\u2019s top movers on altcoin markets are Binance Coin adding 4 percent to close in on $18, and BSV getting a 3.5 percent lift as it approaches $90. There are no coins in the top one hundred gaining double digits as Sunday trading remains lethargic.\n\nTotal crypto market capitalization hasn\u2019t moved much this weekend and remains around $225 billion. Daily volume, according to coinmarketcap.com, has declined below $50 billion but markets are marginally higher than this time last weekend.\n\nImage from Shutterstock", "description": "Bitcoin has spent the past two weeks consolidating just below the 200 day moving average.
