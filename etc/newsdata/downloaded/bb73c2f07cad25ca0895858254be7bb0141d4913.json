Amy Klobuchar, former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, California Sen. Kamala Harris, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nIn the third quarter, Biden\u2019s campaign spent $17.7 million, despite only hauling in about $15.7 million, and ended the quarter with roughly $9 million on hand. Harris, meanwhile, raised $11.7 million in individual contributions but spent about $14.6 million. At the end of September, her campaign had $10.5 million on hand.\n\nLikewise, O\u2019Rourke garnered $4.5 million in donations, but spent $6.4 million, finishing with $3.3 million.\n\nFive candidates \u2014 including former Housing Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro and Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan \u2014 ended the quarter with less than $1 million in their coffers.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders led the crowded field in cash on hand (and fundraising) with $33.8 million, according to new FEC filings. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren placed second, with $25.7 million, followed by South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who had $23.4 million cash on hand. California Sen. Kamala Harris was the only other presidential candidate, at $10.5 million, to end the quarter with more than $10 million in the bank.\n\nOf the top three candidates in early polls, Sanders and Warren are the only two to eschew traditional, big donor events, instead relying on small donors.\n\nButtigieg blasted that strategy ahead of the fourth Democratic debate on Tuesday night, warning that Democrats can\u2019t beat President Trump by relying on \u201cpocket change\u201d to fund their campaigns. (In response, Warren issued a pointed statement and proposal to \u201cget big money out of politics.)\n\nStill, Trump, at the end of the third quarter, had $83.2 million \u2014 more cash on hand that the three best-funded Democrats combined.\n\nA new survey released on Monday revealed that Democrats in New Hampshire, the state that\u2019s holding the first primary race in 2020, would consider backing former first lady Michelle Obama, were she to enter the race.\n\nObama has repeatedly dismissed that notion, nor has she hinted at any political runs in the near future. If she did, however, she\u2019d likely enter New Hampshire in a three-way tie for the top spot, with Warren at 25 percent, Biden at 24 percent and Sanders at 22 percent, according to the Boston Herald-Franklin Pierce University Survey.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE", "description": "Five candidates ended the third quarter with less than $1 million in their coffers.", "authors": ["Megan Henney"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2019/10/0/0/CNN-NYT-debate-1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
