(Gary A. Vasquez/USA Today Sports)\n\nNBA star LeBron James said to reporters on Tuesday that he was done talking about the conflict touched off when Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey tweeted support for protesters in Hong Kong, calling his Los Angeles Lakers\u2019 recent trip to China \u201cchallenging\u201d and saying that \u201cif you were not there, you just can\u2019t relate.\u201d\n\nThe comments came a day after James criticized Morey for not being \u201ceducated on the situation at hand\u201d in remarks that drew widespread condemnation.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be cheating my teammates by continuing to harp on something that won\u2019t benefit us trying to win a championship, because that\u2019s what we\u2019re here for. We\u2019re not politicians,\u201d James told reporters Tuesday. \u201cWe are leaders, and we can step up at times, but there\u2019s times \u2014 I\u2019m not saying in this particular instance \u2014 but you know, if you don\u2019t feel like you should speak upon things, you shouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\nJames then went on to say that concerns in his local community are more important to him. The Lakers star has pledged to send 2,300 underprivileged kids in his hometown of Akron, Ohio to college if they hit certain educational-achievement benchmarks.\n\nJames has previously been known for his vocal political activism. \u201cWhen you see something that\u2019s unjust, or you see something that\u2019s wrong, or you see something that\u2019s trying to divide us,\u201d he told ESPN\u2019s SportsCenter in July 2018. \u201cI feel like my voice can be heard and can speak volumes.\u201d\n\nESPN\u2019s Dave McMenamin reported Tuesday night that James and other players were blindsided by the Chinese backlash over Morey\u2019s tweet, which included cancelled endorsement engagements. When NBA commissioner Adam Silver asked players during a meeting in Shanghai to face questions from reporters on the situation \u2014 telling them that freedom of expression is \u201cwhat you guys stand for\u201d \u2014 James reportedly challenged Silver on why Morey was not being punished by the league, saying a player in the same situation would have faced repercussions.\n\nOn Wednesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that pro-China troll accounts had coordinated a harassment campaign against Morey in the aftermath of his initial pro-Hong Kong tweet. There have also been reports of Hong Kong protesters burning James\u2019s jersey in response to his condemnation of Morey.", "description": "NBA star LeBron James said Tuesday he was done talking about the conflict regarding Houston Rockets' Daryl Morey's support for Hong Kong protesters.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Kevin D.
