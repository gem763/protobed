China\u2019s offshore yuan retreated and gave back gains made late Friday on the PBOC move.\n\nEmerging-market equities generally outperformed, with MSCI\u2019s emerging-markets index hitting their highest in more than a month. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields and German bund equivalents nudged higher. Brent crude oil prices rose, too. The dollar\u2019s DXY index was little changed, with euro/dollar holding steady about $1.1030 going into this week\u2019s ECB meeting.\n\nThe big political focus remains on sterling, which slipped back against both the dollar and euro first thing on Monday after last week\u2019s rally on parliament\u2019s move to prevent a no-deal Brexit.\n\nAnti-Brexit protestors gather on Whitehall before a 'Stop the Coup' rally in London, September 7, 2019. REUTERS/Simon Dawson\n\nParliament is expected to vote again later on Monday on PM Boris Johnson\u2019s plan to hold a snap October election - but is likely to reject it once more as it awaits confirmation Johnson will carry out its instruction to seek an extension to the Oct. 31 Brexit deadline if he fails to get a deal with the European Union. Parliament is then effectively suspended for the next five weeks as the negotiations play out before the Oct 18 EU summit.\n\nJohnson visits Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in Dublin on Monday, and press speculation is focusing on whether there is any wiggle room in Brussels or Dublin over changes to the controversial Irish border backstop provision. Press reports also home in on possible ways Johnson can avoid seeking an extension and also on the chance he may resign before having to do so.\n\nIn European corporate news, shares in IAG are seen opening 2% lower after British Airways pilots began a 48-hour strike on Monday, grounding most of the airline's flights and disrupting thousands of travellers' plans.\n\nIn M&A, the Sunday Times reported Orion Capital was seeking partners for a buyout of Intu; shares in the manager of shopping centres are expected to opend around 10% higher. Eddie Stobart Logistics said it had received a preliminary expression of interest from its third-largest shareholder, DBAY Advisors Limited.\n\nIn earnings, Associated British Foods maintained its guidance for the 2018-19 year, forecasting good profit performances at its Primark fashion chain and grocery business would offset a decline in its sugar operations. Its shares are seen up 1% to 2%.\n\nOther stock movers include Lloyds after it raised PPI provisions to 1.2 billion to 1.8 billion pounds and suspended buybacks; Dorian industry insured losses were seen in several billions of dollars, according to Munich Re; Banco do Brasil and UBS were in advanced talks for investment-banking joint venture, sources said; Santander was to increase its Mexican business ownership to 91.6%.\n\n\u2014 A look at the day ahead from EMEA markets editor Mike Dolan.
