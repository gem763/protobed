In the U.S., the company\u2019s app downloads are up 6% versus the prior-year quarter and +13% from Q2 2019, while international app downloads are 21% higher annually and 34% sequentially.\n\nMore from Variety\n\nThe Q3 lift in Netflix app downloads was \u201clikely aided\u201d by the July 4 release of \u201cStranger Things\u201d Season 3 as well as other programming, BoFA said in the research note.\n\nThe new data led Netflix stock to climb as much as 3.6% in early trading Monday before pulling back to close up 1.44% for the day.\n\nAnalyst research has previously pegged \u201cStranger Things\u201d Season 3 as poised to be a subscriber magnet. A Cowen & Co. survey released in July found that 13% of former Netflix members said they planned to resubscribe to the service in order to watch S3 of the \u201980s-set paranormal show while nearly 5% of consumers who weren\u2019t current Netflix subscribers said they planned to subscribe to watch it.\n\nNetflix also has bragged about the performance of \u201cStranger Things 3,\u201d although its in-house metrics are unverifiable by third-party services. The company claimed that 40.7 million accounts watched the show in the first four days of its debut, marking Netflix\u2019s biggest-ever audience for a movie or TV series in a four-day window.\n\nThat said, Netflix is bracing for the impact of significant new competitors on its business. That includes the scheduled Nov. 12 launch of Disney Plus as well as Apple TV Plus, followed by WarnerMedia\u2019s HBO Max and NBCUniversal\u2019s streaming play in 2020.\n\nThe upbeat mobile-download stats come after Netflix badly missed sub forecasts for the second quarter of 2019, posting its first net U.S. customer decline since 2011 while growth slowed considerably overseas. The company added 2.7 million subs worldwide in Q2, almost half as many as the 5 million it had projected.\n\nSign up for Variety\u2019s Newsletter.
