While that rule remains in place domestically, teams now can have their branding or players appear in other countries\u2014for example, at a retail sponsor\u2019s store\u2014or they can distribute nongame content on a sponsor\u2019s social-media channels in other countries.\n\n\u201cThe NBA doesn\u2019t want the Celtics to go into Hollywood to do a Celtics marketing activation\u2014that\u2019s to protect the teams and the brands,\u201d said Richie Smith, director of strategy and business development for the Boston Celtics. \u201cWhile we still can\u2019t do that, the league has opened up restrictions when it comes to international markets.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nThe new international opportunities come into effect just as the league and its biggest star, LeBron James, have been whipsawed by entanglement in global affairs. A Houston Rockets executive\u2019s tweet supporting protests in Hong Kong elicited a fierce response from China, including threats to cancel the broadcast of NBA games in China. Mr. James called the tweet misinformed, then tried to backpedal amid criticism in the U.S.\n\nNBA commissioner Adam Silver on Thursday said China had asked him to fire the Rockets executive, and the league refused. He added that the league has already suffered substantial revenue losses as a result. \u201cThe financial consequences have been, and may continue to be, fairly dramatic,\u201d he said.\n\nThe NBA\u2019s board of governors approved the new international marketing rules at a meeting in April, long before the current controversy. The league and team executives believe the change can help boost global revenue.\n\nPatches Pay Off\n\nThe international program was inspired in part by a separate program that allows NBA teams to sell a sponsored patch on their jerseys. Two-thirds of the sponsors that have placed branded patches have a global footprint, said Amy Brooks, president of team marketing and business operations and chief innovation officer for the NBA. Teams will be able to select their jersey sponsor as one of their two partners in the new international marketing program.\n\n\u201cThe success of the patch program and the types of companies that were in it was an indicator to us that this was an opportunity to help grow our brand and our partners\u2019 brands globally,\u201d Ms. Brooks said.\n\nPatch sponsors include General Electric Co. , Harley-Davidson Inc., Walt Disney Co. and Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten Inc.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks, whose jerseys were sponsored last season by 5miles, a mobile shopping marketplace for local deals, is looking for a new sponsor with international reach for the 2019-20 season, said Ryan Mackey, senior vice president of corporate sponsorships for the Mavericks. He said the decision to end the 5miles partnership was made by both parties.\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks\u2019 Justin Jackson blocked a shot by the Orlando Magic\u2019s Khem Birch last season, when 5miles had a sponsorship patch on Dallas\u2019s jerseys.

Allen Jr./Associated Press\n\n\u201cThe interest has been very strong,\u201d Mr. Mackey added. \u201cWe\u2019ve had multiple conversations with a variety of companies, some of which are based in Dallas that are companies that people may know, and others that are companies based internationally and may not be household names but are taking an interest in the patch program because of the visibility it brings.\u201d\n\nThe NBA declined to reveal how much revenue the sponsorships brought in last season. Individual team deals ranged from a \u201ccouple of millions of dollars\u201d a year to the $20 million the Golden State Warriors receive every year from Rakuten, according to people familiar with the matter. Some of the revenue generated by the program is shared among all of the teams and players.\n\nData calculated by Nielsen, which works with 23 of the 30 NBA teams as well as the league itself, shows that the jersey patches drove $106 million in sponsorship value during U.S. TV broadcasts last season, including the playoffs. Nielsen\u2019s sponsorship value figures approximate the fair market value of assets based on their exposure across media channels and the costs to advertise on those channels.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an iconic piece of real estate to be on the jersey,\u201d said Jon Stainer, managing director of Nielsen Sports Americas. \u201cIt will continue to be a very valuable asset for NBA teams going forward.\u201d\n\nExecutives from the Celtics, Mavericks, Chicago Bulls and Atlanta Hawks said the jersey patches had become one of their top sponsorship assets.\n\nWith the jersey sponsorship program indefinitely extended by the NBA, teams are also likely to raise prices when the time comes for renewals, according to team executives.\n\n\u201cWe have data points to back [the value] up,\u201d said Mr. Smith of the Celtics, whose jersey sponsor is GE. \u201cWhen we go back out to the market, we expect to go higher than what we initially did.\u201d\n\nSome teams say the sponsorships have benefits beyond the cash infusion.\n\nNew Fans, New Risks\n\nThe Warriors said they got access to potential new fans through its deal with Rakuten. The company owns the messaging service Viber, where the Warriors began interacting with users with everything from daily trivia to team sticker pack offers.\n\n\u201cWe get to reach users that we probably would not have had access to, or the ability to reach them as effectively or efficiently without them,\u201d said Mike Kitts, senior vice president of partnerships for the Warriors.\n\nRakuten saw the Warriors sponsorship as a way to build its brand in the U.S., especially as the company worked to align its different businesses under the Rakuten name, said Rahul Kadavakolu, director of the global marketing supervisory department at Rakuten. The tech giant\u2019s U.S. headquarters are also in San Mateo, Calif., near the Warriors\u2019 home court. The proximity has helped with talent recruitment, Mr. Kadavakolu added.\n\nOf course, globalization has its risks, as demonstrated by the NBA\u2019s trouble in China and the blowback in the U.S.\n\n\u201cWith so many NBA fans outside the United States, we recognize that doing business internationally can be complex and often requires navigating local customs, cultures and beliefs,\u201d said an NBA spokesman.\n\nBut global growth remains a priority for the league. The league is working with Nike Inc. to add sponsor patches to its line of \u201cauthentic\u201d team jerseys. They will be available for sale globally next year, Ms. Brooks said.\n\nApproximately 45% of the NBA\u2019s total merchandise revenue is generated outside of the U.S. and Canada, according to an NBA spokesman.\n\nWrite to Sahil Patel at sahil.patel@wsj.com", "description": "When the NBA regular season begins Tuesday, each team will be able to work with up to two sponsors on advertising campaigns outside the U.S. and Canada, an expansion of the league\u2019s global marketing activity fueled in part by the results of its separate jersey sponsorship program.", "authors": ["Sahil Patel", "Sahil.Patel Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-118444/social", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
