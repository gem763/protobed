The mother of one accused the IPCC of discrimination and harassment after she got a temporary job there as an investigator in September 2016.\n\nShe sued for \u00a3144,000, saying: \u2018In my view, the IPCC, now the IOPC, is an institutionally racist employer operating a hostile environment for its [black, Asian and minority ethnic] staff.\n\n\u2018It is corrupt and not fit for purpose. It protects senior white police officers.\u2019 But the Central London Employment Tribunal concluded that the serial litigant would complain of victimisation if she was unhappy at work.\n\nDismissing all 33 of Miss Howard\u2019s allegations, Judge Joanna Wade said her claim of being the victim of a \u2018witch hunt\u2019 was unfounded, adding: \u2018It is a matter of great sadness to us, first, that Miss Howard and her witnesses came to this tribunal with such a misguided view of her position.\n\n\u2018We are left with the uncomfortable conclusion that the claimant has an unshakable but incorrect belief that if she does not like what is happening or is prevented from doing the work she chooses, this is discrimination, victimisation, harassment.\u2019\n\nThe tribunal held in May last year heard the real reason she left the IPCC was that she was facing disciplinary action for falsifying timesheets and poor performance. In conclusion, Judge Wade suggested Miss Howard had only launched her IPCC claim because she had successfully sued the Metropolitan Police in July 2014 for \u00a337,000.\n\nFollowing a costs hearing earlier this month, Judge Wade told journalists: \u2018I have to conclude this was an exceptional waste of time.\u2019 In her judgment published this week, the judge noted that Miss Howard was broke and said she was suffering from \u2018severe anxiety\u2019.", "description": "Carol Howard, 40, faces court battle after being charged with unlawfully obtaining and disclosing personal data when she allegedly downloaded information from IPCC computers.", "authors": ["Rebecca Camber Chief Crime Correspondent For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/25/21/20198058-0-image-a-7_1572036788748.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
