Hillary also said that Jill Stein, the Green Party's nominee for President in 2016, was similarly a Russian asset who was responsible for Hillary's loss to President Trump.\n\nStein responded during an interview on CNN, characterizing Clinton's accusations as \"a completely unhinged conspiracy theory for which there is absolutely no basis in fact.\" She continued, \"this is a wild and insulting theory, and I think it speaks to Hillary's need to try and explain ... why her campaign was not successful.\"\n\n.@TulsiGabbard isn't the only one that @HillaryClinton called a \"Russian asset.\" She also called Jill Stein, who ran in 2016, one.\n\n\n\n\"This is a completely unhinged conspiracy theory for which there is no basis in fact.

But Hillary would have you believe that she spent the time in Russia being \"groomed\" by Vladimir Putin.\n\nEarlier today, Andrew Yang also defended his fellow rival for the Democratic nomination. Yang tweeted, \"Tulsi Gabbard deserves much more respect and thanks than this. She literally just got back from serving our country abroad.\"\n\nTulsi Gabbard deserves much more respect and thanks than this.
