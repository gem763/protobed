Peter wanted to help as many people as he could through organ donation. His sacrifice saved or transformed the lives of 17 people.\n\nThe NHS Organ Donor Register was founded in 1994, a fitting legacy.\n\n(Image: Andy Commins/Daily Mirror)\n\n(Image: Philip Coburn/Daily Mirror)\n\nThis week, as the NHS marks the register\u2019s 25th anniversary, it was revealed that it had saved or transformed 20,000 lives.\n\nIn 2017 Emma\u2019s son Max received a heart from donor Keira Ball , nine, of Barnstaple, Devon, after more than six months on the waiting list.\n\n\u201cWithout it, Max would not be here,\u201d Emma told Rosemary. But the 11-year-old, poster boy of the Mirror\u2019s Change the Law for Life crusade, has at least repaid some of that debt.\n\nOver almost three decades, the Cox family campaigned for the new opt-out system in England, where everyone is understood to be a donor when they die. It starts next spring, named Max and Keira\u2019s Law after our story touched the heart of then Prime Minister Theresa May .\n\n(Image: Philip Coburn/Daily Mirror)\n\nPeter died on Remembrance Sunday, a \u201cspecial day\u201d for his loved ones, as they remember the sacrifices he made as the nation remembers those who gave their lives in combat.\n\n\u201cIt is the 30th anniversary of his death this year; it gives us such comfort to know that Peter\u2019s life was not in vain,\u201d explained Christine, 57, of London. \u201cThe register has helped to save thousands of people since it was set up in 1994.\n\n\u201cMax and Keira\u2019s law is fantastic. We can take a step back now knowing we have seen what we set out to achieve.\u201d\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nIn Wales, where the system came in back in 2015, they now have the highest consent rate of all the UK nations at 77%, up from 58% .\n\nSheer persistence and campaigning by Peter\u2019s family persuaded the Tories to introduce the donor register after Christine made a speech at the 1993 Tory conference.\n\nBy 2005, more than 12 million had signed up. That figure now stands at 25 million, 38% of the population.\n\n\u201cIf you are prepared to receive an organ to save your life \u2013 you should be prepared to give,\u201d says Rosemary, of Wolverhampton, West Midlands, who met Vera Davison, whose late husband Patrick received Peter\u2019s heart, at the Pride of Britain awards in March.\n\nEmma, 49, of Winsford, Cheshire, described their work as \u201camazing\u201d, saying the Change the Law for Life campaign carried on the legacy of the donor register.\n\n\u201cNow we will have publicity for the new law, and that should lead to more donations,\u201d she said.\n\nChristine said: \u201cMax has done so much, he is amazing. He has finished the work we have done. The Mirror\u2019s support has been fabulous. They always backed our call for the register, and now for the new law.\u201d\n\nAnthony Clarkson, Director of Organ Donation and Transplantation for NHS Blood and Transplant, said: \u201cThis is an incredible legacy for Peter and we are grateful to the whole Cox family for their tireless work over the years.\u201d\n\nVisit www.organdonation.nhs.uk to find out further information", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: NHS Organ Donor Register was founded in 1994 after Rosemary Cox, of Wolverhampton, West Midlands, and Emma Johnson, from Winsford, Cheshire, led the Daily Mirror campaign Change the Law for Life", "authors": ["Jeremy Armstrong", "Image", "Tim Anderson", "Andy Commins Daily Mirror", "Philip Coburn Daily Mirror"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20716096.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/2_I191024_131047_1549899oTextTRMRMMGLPICT000196492310o.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
