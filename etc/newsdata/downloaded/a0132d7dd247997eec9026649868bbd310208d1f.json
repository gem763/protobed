By partnering with Vodacom, we've been able to take a step in the right direction as a country, one that sees us use technology to support national police efforts and bring communities together to help us fight crime.\n\nVodacom's public enterprises managing executive Rudi Matjokana added: \"Digital citizen engagement platforms are a powerful tool in the public sector's quest to improve and manage service delivery. This will further strengthen the relationship between the police and communities - creating better policing for the future.\"\n\nMySAPS will be available on IOS and Android for free. A USSD string is also available for feature phone users.", "description": "MySAPS, a new app that aims to turn the tide against crime, has been launched in South Africa and is the first of its kind on the continent.", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9521/88634ba657af4e7c948a60da3b9a2ff7.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
