When I had my children, I told myself I had to do everything to be a football player.\"\n\nWesley's own father died when he was just nine years old, and he credits his mother for the work she done in raising him.\n\nDespite having two children to care for, Wesley went for broke when he was 17, embarking on a six-month trip to Spain for a trial with Atletico Madrid.\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nIt proved unsuccessful, but Wesley hailed the experience as \"amazing\" before heading to France, and then eventually ending up back in Brazil working in a factory where reality began to hit.\n\n\"I had to get money for my kids. I would go to a team and every team said no,\" Wesley added. \"I went to six teams before going to Slovakia.\n\n\"When I went to the sixth team, I thought I didn't want to play football anymore.
