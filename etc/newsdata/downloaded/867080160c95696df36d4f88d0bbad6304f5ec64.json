Featuring: Waad al-Kateab, Hamza al-Kateab, and Sama al-Kateab. 18 cert, 100 mins\n\nWaad al-Kateab sings a lullaby to her infant daughter. This could be any old home movie, if it weren\u2019t for the sudden interruption \u2013 a violent rumble. The shelling has started up again. We watch as the camera drifts nervously down the hallways of the hospital al-Kateab calls home. Her husband, Hamza, is one of the last remaining doctors in east Aleppo. A cloud of debris fills the air. Al-Kateab realises the building\u2019s been hit and everyone files dutifully down into the basement. In a strained, broken voiceover she wonders what effects all this will have on Sama, her beloved daughter. \u201cWill you ever forgive me?\u201d she ponders. It\u2019s a heartbreaking question.\n\nTo us, For Sama is one of the most profoundly intimate depictions of the Syrian conflict ever put to film. It\u2019s the push to help those on the outside process something so incomprehensible in the depth of its horrors. For al-Kateab, however, it\u2019s not only a memorial to all that she\u2019s sacrificed as a mother, but a rebellion against those who have made her suffer. One day, she hopes, Sama will see and understand everything that they\u2019ve been through. As she recounts, al-Kateab left her family at 18 to study at Aleppo University, where she witnessed first-hand the unrest that grew out of the Arab Spring protests. It\u2019s also where she met Hamza, who had graduated as a doctor and was one of the few committed to helping those who had taken to the streets. At one point, we see footage from their wedding celebrations, as she reflects on how, that precious night, the mirth and music had been loud enough to drown out the sound of the bombs.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBy late 2016, eight out of the nine hospitals in East Aleppo had been destroyed. Hamza\u2019s was the only one left. He and the handful of other doctors who had stayed behind worked tirelessly as hundreds of victims passed through their doors. It was chaos, but they stayed focused on their work, even when the water was cut off and it becomes harder than ever to clean the vast pools of blood collecting on the floor. Al-Kateab\u2019s footage isn\u2019t always chronologically presented. It\u2019s allowed to be shaped by her own impulses as a narrator, flitting between thoughts and emotions. She shares directing credit here with Edward Watts, a documentarian who has worked extensively with Channel 4, the network who also produced al-Kateab\u2019s series of dispatches titled Inside Aleppo. With the help of editors Chloe Lambourne and Simon McMahon, a few more cinematic touches have been added, such as the stirring violins that underscore the family\u2019s attempt to evade the Syrian armed forces and sneak back into the city after they\u2019d left to visit Hamza\u2019s ailing father. Yet the film lacks any of the editorialising, the imposed perspective, or the considered distance that an outsider might place on the story in order to make it fit better into the existing narratives about Syria. The sense of context is limited, though we\u2019re always aware that the planes dropping bombs on hospitals have been sent by Russia.\n\nThis a woman simply telling her own story, having had the impulse to pick up a camera and start rolling. Al-Kateab\u2019s filmmaking is startlingly instinctual. There\u2019s a scene involving an emergency C-section that is framed so perfectly, and with such deep emotional investment, that you\u2019d think it was dramatised. As easy as it\u2019d be to celebrate For Sama as a great call for empathy and urgent action, that\u2019s also potentially attaching motivations to it that aren\u2019t there. Or, at least, aren\u2019t the driving force behind its existence. We only react in such a way because there\u2019s nothing else to do when faced with two weeping, dust-covered boys, standing at the threshold of an emergency room in shock as their brother lies dead on a gurney. There is footage here that will make you sick to your stomach, but For Sama is such a towering achievement because it captures with equal clarity the moments between the terror. It shows us how people can survive under a veil of normalcy. Sometimes they\u2019re able to laugh off the airstrikes. At other times, someone in the group is killed and they\u2019re choked into silence. It\u2019s a life of total impermanence, where al-Kateab can\u2019t even take pride in caring for the flowers in her back garden, since those too are inevitably destroyed.\n\nShape Created with Sketch. The 20 best war films ever made Show all 20 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch. Shape Created with Sketch. The 20 best war films ever made 1/20 20) The Longest Day (Directed by Ken Annakin, Andrew Marton, Gerd Oswald, Bernhard Wicki, Darryl F Zanuck, 1962) An epic all-star international cast in this drama, chronicling the D-Day invasion from the standpoint of both sides, which Life magazine dubbed \u201cThe Longest Headache\u201d. At just under three hours long, it is indeed a marathon, but The Longest Day remains a grimly authentic recreation of events with Oscar-winning special effects and cinematography. D-Day veterans served as consultants, and one of the stars, Richard Todd, saw action in Normandy as part of Operation Overlord. Rex Features 2/20 19) Overlord (Stuart Cooper, 1975) Operation Overlord was the code name for the Battle of Normandy, and this stark low-budget film follows one young soldier from boot camp to his death on Sword Beach. The black and white cinematography, courtesy of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s frequent collaborator John Alcott, blends seamlessly with archive footage, and the result is a film very different in scope and approach from The Longest Day, but no less effective. Rex Features 3/20 18) Where Eagles Dare (Brian G Hutton, 1968) The prolific thriller writer Alistair MacLean was never particularly well served by the film adaptions of his hugely successful novels, apart from the obvious exception of The Guns of Navarone. This thrill-a-minute blockbuster also succeeds, largely due to MacLean\u2019s own screenplay, which he wrote in consort with the novel, and the star pairing of Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood who team up to rescue a high-ranking American officer from a seemingly impenetrable German castle. The Nazis are, of course, mere canon fodder for our heroes, and it pays to suspend disbelief with some signature MacLean plot twists, while the fight atop a mountain cable car remains brilliantly thrilling. Rex Features 4/20 17) Twelve O\u2019Clock High (Henry King, 1949) Gregory Peck was given an Oscar nod as the general who replaces the commanding officer of a US army bomber squadron who has become too emotionally close to his beleaguered men. He ruthlessly and dispassionately sets about restoring morale, but eventually falls prey to the same syndrome. Twelve O\u2019Clock High was one of the first films to tackle the psychological effects of war on servicemen, and has been used for decades as a training film not just for the armed forces but a host of organisations, from hotel chains to the emergency services, about the effects of the burden of command and how to recognise the symptoms. Rex Features 5/20 16) The Dirty Dozen (Robert Aldrich, 1967) A huge box-office smash featuring assorted murderers, psychopaths and various other army prisoners, all given a chance of redemption in a hopeless suicide mission behind enemy lines. Audience manipulation at its zenith, thanks to a brilliant cast headed by Lee Marvin, and Aldrich at his most nihilistic. One of the other stars, Charles Bronson, was awarded a Purple Heart during his own Second World War service. Rex Features 6/20 15) The Big Red One (Samuel Fuller, 1980) Based on Fuller\u2019s own experiences, The Big Red One follows a troop of American soldiers and their transition from callow youths to battle-hardened veterans under their tough but fatherly sergeant (a terrific Lee Marvin). The maverick director\u2019s finest film eloquently and movingly illustrates the futility and tragedy of war, and provides all the evidence you need to back up Martin Scorsese\u2019s assertion that the truest, the least sentimental and toughest war films were Fuller\u2019s. Rex Features 7/20 14) The Dam Busters (Michael Anderson, 1955) With its stirring theme music and spectacular (for the time) special effects, The Dam Busters is one of the most famous of all British Second World War films. The Dam Busters chronicles the exhaustive development by engineer Barnes Wallis of the bouncing bomb and its subsequent deployment in the famous raid that destroyed two of Germany\u2019s strategically important Ruhr dams in May 1943. Constrained by the fact many key details of the raid were still classified, director Anderson nevertheless produced a pretty faithful account of events \u2013 a patriotic tribute to unsung heroes, but a film that never flinches to show the true human cost of war. Rex Features 8/20 13) From Here to Eternity (Fred Zinnemann, 1953) Hamstrung by the censors, Zinnemann made the best film he could from James Jones\u2019s epic and controversial novel, and it remains a very good one indeed. The ensemble cast is superb, with Ernest Borgnine, Burt Lancaster, Deborah Kerr, Montgomery Clift and Oscar-winning Donna Reed all at the top of their game, while Frank Sinatra also proved he could act and lifted the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, horse\u2019s head or not. The recreation of the Pearl Harbour attack by the Japanese is a standout in a film that won eight Oscars. Rex Features 9/20 12) The Great Escape (John Sturges, 1963) Based on the true story of allied prisoners planning a mass escape from a German prison camp, the jauntiness of much of The Great Escape jars with the grim reality of the executions of many of the real-life escapees on whose story the movie drew. However, this much-loved blockbuster remains one of the most famous films ever made and is a perennial holiday staple. Part of the fun stems from the stellar international cast, some of whom, including Donald Pleasence, had been prisoners of war themselves. Rex Features 10/20 11) Letters From Iwo Jima (Clint Eastwood, 2006) A companion piece to Eastwood\u2019s Flags of Our Fathers, which told the story of the battle for Iwo Jima from the American perspective, this is the better of the two films, told from the viewpoint of the Japanese. The film marks the culmination of Eastwood\u2019s growth as an artist, as he eloquently and movingly humanises the Japanese soldiers fighting against near impossible odds. Rex Features 11/20 10) The Thin Red Line (Terrence Malick, 1998) Malick returned to directing after a two-decade absence in stunning fashion with his adaption of the autobiographical James Jones novel. The Thin Red Line follows a troop of American soldiers during the battle for Guadalcanal and, as befits a Malick picture, boasts sumptuous production values and beautiful cinematography in this dreamlike study of men in war as the Eden-like landscape becomes a living hell. Rex Features 12/20 9) The Bridge on the River Kwai (David Lean, 1957) The celebrated prisoner of war epic set in Japanese-occupied Burma with Alec Guinness as the British colonel obsessed with building the titular bridge. Colonel Nicholson\u2019s reasoning is that if the prisoners can build the best bridge they can, it will boost their morale and show the camp\u2019s brutal commandant that the British soldier is superior to the Japanese, oblivious that in doing so he may be aiding the enemy. As much a battle of wills as a great action movie, this enduring classic won seven Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Guinness, and remains a perennial television favourite. Rex Features 13/20 8) Rome, Open City (Roberto Rossellini, 1945) A classic of Italian neorealism with many unforgettable images full of raw immediacy, and featuring an immense performance from Anna Magnani. Open City is a stark, brutal account of the Italian resistance during the Nazi occupation of Rome, which the director shot in piecemeal fashion in a ravaged city only recently liberated by American forces. Rex Features 14/20 7) Das Boot (Wolfgang Petersen, 1981) A masterful ultra-realistic account of a German U-Boat crew during the Battle of the Atlantic, which favours suspense and tension as much as thrillingly authentic battle scenes. Das Boot incorporates a strong anti-war message while emphasising the sailors\u2019 contempt for the Nazis as they (and the audience) experience the long days of tedium and claustrophobic horror of underwater warfare. Rex Features 15/20 6) Grave of the Fireflies (Isao Takahata, 1988) Heartbreaking and thought-provoking anime from Studio Ghibli about brother and sister Japanese orphans desperately trying to survive in the dying days of the war. A haunting anti-war statement almost without peer, adapted from the story by Akiyuki Nosaka and based on his own experiences in the firebombed city of Kobe. Rex Features 16/20 5) Dunkirk (Christopher Nolan, 2017) Nolan\u2019s retelling of the Dunkirk evacuation is a stunning achievement, which on release immediately entered the pantheon of great war movies. Three separate stories \u2013 the soldiers on the beach and one young Tommy in particular, the Spitfires overhead, and the brave civilians who risk their lives to cross the Channel in their boats to help with the rescue, are intertwined to a wall-of-sound backdrop for one of the most immersive films you could ever wish to experience. Warner Bros 17/20 4) Saving Private Ryan (Steven Spielberg, 1998) Until Saving Private Ryan, with its shockingly realistic opening half hour on Omaha Beach during the Normandy landings, no Hollywood film had shown the carnage of warfare quite so graphically. Spielberg then poses the question \u201chow do you find decency in the hell of warfare?\u201d as Tom Hanks\u2019s troop go deep behind enemy lines to rescue one man so he can return home to his grieving mother who has lost all three of her other sons. Occasionally sentimental, undeniably manipulative, but a film that virtually reinvented the genre. David James/Dreamworks/Amblin/Universal/Kobal/Rex 18/20 3) Come and See (Elem Klimov, 1985) One of the most harrowing films ever made, this Russian masterpiece drew on the experiences of the film\u2019s writer, Ales Adamovich, who witnessed many of the atrocities portrayed. A surreal, nightmarish experience as we witness the transition of a carefree 14-year-old Belarusian boy become a resistance fighter, traumatised by the barbarism of the invading Nazi forces. Rex Features 19/20 2) Casablanca (Michael Curtiz, 1942) The romantic drama par excellence spends most of its running time in Rick\u2019s nightclub, apart from the glorious climax at the airport, but with its war-torn setting and those nasty Nazis, Casablanca is undoubtedly a classic war film too. Stars, script, director and music all align perfectly to create one of Hollywood\u2019s greatest, most loved and most legendary films. Rex Features 20/20 1) Schindler\u2019s List (Steven Spielberg, 1993) Spielberg\u2019s deeply personal masterpiece is perhaps the most moving war film ever made. All the more so with the knowledge that it was based on the true story of Oskar Schindler, who originally set out to make his fortune by exploiting cheap Jewish labour in Krakow. However, as Schindler witnesses the unfolding horror of the Holocaust, his motivation changes and he bribes Nazi leaders to keep his employees out of the extermination camps, saving more than 1,100 lives. The winner of seven Oscars, Schindler\u2019s List does full justice to Thomas Keneally\u2019s source novel and remains just as powerful and relevant today. REX 1/20 20) The Longest Day (Directed by Ken Annakin, Andrew Marton, Gerd Oswald, Bernhard Wicki, Darryl F Zanuck, 1962) An epic all-star international cast in this drama, chronicling the D-Day invasion from the standpoint of both sides, which Life magazine dubbed \u201cThe Longest Headache\u201d.

As a filmmaker, she\u2019s preoccupied with the children of the city, as she lets the camera scan their faces, looking desperately for the first signs that trauma has taken a hold of them. Why does a little girl know what a cluster bomb is? Why should any child be exposed to these man-made cruelties? \u201cYou never cry like a normal baby would,\u201d she says of Sama. It\u2019s an acknowledgement of her worst fears. Wars never end for those caught in their grip, however young, because trauma never allows its victims to be truly set free.
