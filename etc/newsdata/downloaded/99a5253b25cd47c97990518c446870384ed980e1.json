Hubert Minnis, the prime minister, urged Bahamians to show love to come through the ordeal suffered by their country, while aerial video recorded over the Bahamas' Great Abaco Island showed mile upon mile of flooded neighbourhoods and smashed buildings.\n\nIn the US, meanwhile, authorities in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas were on high alert, as they watched for indications the storm may make landfall in their states.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

At the same time, the size the hurricane covered increased, as did the speed at which it was moving.\n\n\u201cThe headline for this #Dorian advisory is NOT that the wind speed has slightly decreased,\u201d the National Hurricane Centre said of an update it issued on Twitter. \u201cThe combined wind, surge, and floods hazards are the same or even worse since the hurricane has become larger.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch. \"Huge damage\" as record Hurricane Dorian hits Bahamas: In pictures Show all 15 left Created with Sketch. right Created with Sketch.

A total of nine counties issued mandatory evacuation orders, including Duval County, which includes Jacksonville, one of Florida\u2019s two biggest cities, and some areas in Palm Beach County, home to President Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nThe governors of Georgia and South Carolina also ordered evacuations of some coastal counties. Forecasts suggested the storm will move northwards, hugging the coast of Georgia and potentially making landfall in either North or South Carolina by the end of Thursday. Late on Tuesday, North Carolina governor Roy Cooper also announced evacuations for his coastal residents, while recognising the inconvenience. \"When you weigh the cost of losing lives, this is something you need to do,\" he told CNN.\n\n\u201cHurricane Dorian has been a very complicated storm, and we appreciate the support of president Donald Trump, Fema [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] and our neighbouring states that have deployed resources,\u201d tweeted Florida\u2019s Republican governor Ron de Santis. \u201cWe will continue to work with all of our partners until the storm threat had passed.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThese impacts, including flooding, structural damage, storm surge and serious beach erosion in our coastal communities cannot be understated.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Independent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

Iram Lewis, a member of parliament, told CNN: \u201cIt is safe to say, unfortunately, that that number will go up,\u201d\n\nMr Lewis added that extensive floodwaters were making it difficult for rescuers to reach stranded residents. He saw extensive numbers of destroyed houses, felled trees and stunned residents as he surveyed the area. \u201cIt is just unbelievable.\u201d\n\nOn the islands, the United Nations and the International Red Cross began work to deal with what could become a major humanitarian crisis. Bahamian officials said they had received a \u201ctremendous\u201d number of calls from people in flooded homes, and desperate callers trying to find loved ones left messages with local radio stations.\n\n\u201cWe will confirm what the real situation is on the ground,\u201d said health minister Duane Sands. \u201cWe are hoping and praying that the loss of life is limited.\u201d\n\nTammy Mitchell of the Bahamas\u2019 National Emergency Management Agency told ZNS Bahamas radio station that authorities had documented every call and were prioritising them. She said rescue crews were forced to turn back in some cases because the wind was so fierce and the water so high.\n\n\u201cWe understand what everybody was going through,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wanted to go out there\u2026but that\u2019s not a risk we\u2019re capable of taking. We don\u2019t want people thinking we\u2019ve forgotten them.\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by agencies", "description": "Millions of Americans have been ordered to evacuate their homes after Hurricane Dorian \u2013 having relentlessly battered the Bahamas for days, leaving at least five fatalities and dozens of injuries in its wake \u2013 picked up speed and size and started bearing down on the southeastern coastline.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/03/19/hurricane-dorian-freeport-bahamas-julia-aylen-wades-from-flooded-house-with-her-dogs.jpg"}
