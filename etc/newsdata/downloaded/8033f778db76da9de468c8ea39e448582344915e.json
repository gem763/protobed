Trudeau\u2019s government took painful policy action on climate change, imposing a carbon tax. Conventional political wisdom might have predicted doom. Instead, even Conservative canvassers found as they knocked on doors that Canadians were willing to pay for environmental benefits. Trudeau\u2019s pollsters must have heard the same message. The second substantive sentence out of Trudeau\u2019s mouth on election night hailed the 2019 result as a vote for \u201cstrong action on climate change.\u201d\n\nCanadian Liberals are left to wonder whether their message would be served by a less scandal-tainted messenger. Canadian Conservatives must reckon with the power of the climate-change issue even in an energy-producing nation like Canada. All Canadians and all friends of Canada should worry whether the country will retain its enviable record as a bastion of democratic stability in a destabilizing world.\n\nTrudeau will now try to strike a deal with the left-wing New Democratic Party to support his government, as a previous NDP supported his father\u2019s government from 1972 to 1974. That last partnership ended badly for the NDP, and today\u2019s New Democrats are likely to demand a high policy price in exchange for their votes now. That price will drag the Trudeau government away from the policy center, opening even more room for the Conservatives under the careful leadership of Andrew Scheer. If the softening U.S. economy drags Canada down too, Justin Trudeau may find his second government even bumpier and more contentious than his first.\n\nRead: The man who could beat Justin Trudeau\n\nWhatever their other differences, Canada's Liberal and Conservative governments of the past 20 years achieved a remarkable record of governing success between 1995 and 2015. They reduced Canada\u2019s once-terrifying budget deficits. They navigated the country deftly through the global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. They held at bay Canada\u2019s most dangerous internal threat: separatism and regional alienation.\n\nJustin Trudeau\u2019s first government has revived those dangerous threats\u2014and the outcome of the 2019 Canadian election paints the map with the colors of their return.\n\nOne of the night\u2019s biggest winners was the Bloc Quebecois party, the party of Quebec nationalism. The Bloc erupted into prominence in the early 1990s. In 1993, it won 54 of Quebec\u2019s 75 seats and actually qualified as the second-largest party in Parliament. In the more stable 2000s, though, the Bloc suffered a long, slow fade. It lost official party status in 2011 and dropped to its lowest-ever share of the Quebec vote in 2015. Quebec seemed at last to have fully committed itself to the Canadian national political system, dividing its votes\u2014as other Canadians did\u2014among Liberals, Conservatives, and the left-wing New Democrats.", "description": "Almost alone among the advanced democracies, the country has been bypassed by reactionary populism.", "authors": ["David Frum", "Staff Writer At"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/GettyImages_640278300/facebook.jpg?1571774848", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
