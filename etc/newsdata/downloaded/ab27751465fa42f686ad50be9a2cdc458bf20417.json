She was working full time as a cover teacher in a high school, as well as in a bar at night and promotional work at weekends.\n\nDetermined to make a change, she spotted a gap in the market for what she calls \u201cglam fashion online\u201d.\n\nSeven years on from the business\u2019s launch, the Pink Boutique business she started is now racking up sales of \u00a325 million a year.\n\nAnd it all started on eBay - with just \u00a390 - half of which she borrowed from her mum.\n\nGetting off the ground\n\nAlice says that the fashion websites around at the time were missing the mark, showing models who looked very natural wearing party dresses.\n\n\u201cI am from Newcastle upon Tyne, the party city where the girls love tan and make-up.\u201d\n\nShe had an idea for doing things differently, but Alice admits that she endured a couple of failed starts as a result of poor quality samples. So she set off hunting for a wholesaler she could rely on who could provide good quality stock, eventually locating one in the UK.\n\n\u201cI was really struggling for money, so I begged my mum to lend me \u00a345 so I could afford a \u00a390 pack of six dresses.\u201d\n\nRecruiting a friend from the bar as a model, she listed them on eBay, and they all sold very quickly.\n\n\u201cWhen they sold, we reinvested and bought two packs, then four packs and so on until Pink Boutique was born.\u201d\n\nKeeping it in the family\n\nAlice had been using her lunch breaks from her regular job to handle posting out her orders, but before long that break simply wasn\u2019t long enough.\n\nSo teaming up with her mum Jackie, she went full time with the business, Alice handling the creative side of buying, selling and marketing, while Julie took on the admin and finances.\n\nStarting from scratch\n\nAlice graduated from university with a journalism degree, but had no prior business knowledge, so she had to learn everything about running a business.\n\nShe says: \u201cI did a lot of Googling, bought marketing books and watched YouTube tutorials.\u201d\n\nTiming helped with spreading the word too, as she set up a Facebook page for the business just as the feature was launched on the social media site, and it quickly built up interest.\n\n\u201cWe managed to go viral without spending a penny! Our strategy was to create and share engaging content and we built a massive community of like-minded women.\u201d\n\nRocketing sales\n\nPinkBoutique\u2019s unapologetic love of all things glam has helped the business take off at some rate. That initial \u00a390 spend led to a turnover of \u00a3500,000 by the end of year one.\n\nAnd now the business is on track to bring in \u00a325 million in sales, with 2,000 garments a day being shipped out from its Newcastle warehouse.\n\nAlice says: \u201cIt\u2019s surreal that a business I started in my living room has gone this far.\u201d\n\nShe isn\u2019t standing still either, with the firm now building a strategy for exporting.\n\nStarting a family\n\nPinkBoutique was a family affair from the very beginning, but Alice has also had to grapple with the challenge of running a business while starting a family.\n\nWhile she says she struggled to get her head around the change that her daughter brought to her usual schedule, she has now found a better work/life balance.\n\nWhat\u2019s more she reckons that motherhood has actually helped the business, as it\u2019s made her more single-minded at work, focusing on just one or two big things for PinkBoutique to achieve each year.\n\n\"I completely take my hat off to anyone who has young children and starts their own business! Luckily we had scaled our business to the point where I was able to take maternity leave, but I know this isn\u2019t always possible for people with small businesses.\"\n\n\"Having an online business that\u2019s open 24 hours is like having a baby that doesn\u2019t sleep. I joke that the business was my first baby as it\u2019s needed so much attention and nurturing. Since becoming a mum I have become infinitely more organised and that\u2019s what\u2019s getting me through.\"\n\nFollowing in Alice\u2019s footsteps\n\nClearly not all start-ups will enjoy the sort of prodigious growth seen by Pink Boutique, yet Alice believes there are lessons others can learn from her experiences.\n\nShe says: \u201cTry to learn as much as you can in the beginning when you\u2019re small, but then don\u2019t be afraid to pay for experienced staff when you can. Our business really changed gears when we brought in a management team.\u201d", "description": "Seven years on from the business\u2019s launch, the Pink Boutique business Alice started is now racking up sales of \u00a325million a year", "authors": ["John Fitzsimons"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20554423.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_ALICEHall.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
