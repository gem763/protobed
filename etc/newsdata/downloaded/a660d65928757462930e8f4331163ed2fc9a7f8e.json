Shane Gahagan, the program executive officer for the Navy's Tactical Aircraft Programs, said Wednesday. \"Now we have an equally challenging goal of sustaining these efforts.\"\n\nWhen the military services were ordered to get 80% of their tactical aircraft ready for the fight, Navy officials decided to try to push the numbers even higher. They wanted 341 F/A-18 E/F Super Hornets and 93 EA-18G Growlers mission-capable and ready to deploy.\n\nIt was a daunting task. Only about 50% of the service's Super Hornets were considered mission-capable at the time. That meant about 260 were ready to deploy at a moment's notice. Leaders wanted 341 to be ready.\n\n\"It was a number chosen internally to improve our aviation forces' ability to surge in time of need,\" Gahagan said the day after the service announced it had 343 Super Hornets and 95 Growlers ready to deploy.\n\nAn EA-18G Growler lands on the Navy's forward deployed aircraft carrier, USS Ronald Reagan, June 20, 2018 U.S. Navy\n\nTo meet the call from former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to push mission-capable rates on F-18s, F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, F-22 Raptors and F-16 Fighting Falcons up to 80%, the Navy turned to outside experts who deal with plane maintenance issues every day: commercial airliners.\n\nThey looked at how they could speed up maintenance, make fleet readiness centers operate more efficiently, and improve the supply chain so parts could get out to the fleet faster, Gahagan said.\n\n\"The commercial [partners] came and said, 'Hey, there's probably a better way to do some of those things,'\" he said, with the biggest change being the addition of new maintenance operations centers and aircraft-on-ground, or AOG, cells.\n\nA Navy news release that describes the AOGs said the concept had proven successful with commercial airliners. The idea is to have representatives from supply, engineering and industry quickly resolve problems on aircraft that have been grounded for a short time \u2014 those that have flown in the last 160 days and have fewer than 10 problems.\n\n\"We have all the entities right there making decisions on what aircraft to go after,\" Gahagan said. \"... That has proven very effective.\"\n\nIf the Navy is going to be ready to take on a near-peer adversary, it must maintain its high mission-capable rates on fighter aircraft, he added. Planes' readiness rates are assessed daily, he said, so they'll know quickly if they begin to see those levels dip again.\n\n\"When it gets to that number, that shows there's indicators that we're not sustaining,\" Gahagan said. \"[We'll have to look at] where is that? What organization? And how can we stop those problems and get it back to where we are?\n\n\"We will know every day.\"\n\nEditor's note: This story has been updated to correct Gahagan's rank.\n\n\u2014 Gina Harkins can be reached at gina.harkins@military.com.
