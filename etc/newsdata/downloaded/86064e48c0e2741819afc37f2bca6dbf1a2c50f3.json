With the rallies getting longer and longer as this set drags on, fatigue and physical exhaustion look to be playing a factor for both men. And the New York crowd, which booed Medvedev earlier in the tournament, is now rallying behind him and chanting his name.\n\nThird set: Medvedev leads, 4-3\n\nBig cheers from the crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium after Medvedev breaks Nadal back to even the third set. The Russian isn\u2019t done yet, holding serve to take a 4-3 lead, with the set back on serve.\n\nThird set: Nadal up, 3-2\n\nAfter winning the first two sets, Nadal breaks in the fifth game of the third set and the path is clearing for his 19th Grand Slam title. On break point, Medvedev couldn\u2019t return a strong backhand from Nadal, the youngster\u2019s 32nd unforced error of the match.\n\nThird set: Medvedev up, 2-1\n\nMedvedev is continuing to push Nadal, recording a rare love hold in the third game of the third set. He finished off the game with a 119 mph ace. The third set remains on serve.\n\nSecond set: Nadal wins, 6-3, leads two sets to none\n\nRafael Nadal is now one set away from winning his fourth U.S. Open title after beating Medvedev in 48 minutes in the second set. The Spaniard has a 208-1 record in majors when winning the first two sets. Medvedev looked tired early in the second set, and despite testing Nadal in the ninth game, couldn\u2019t record a break. The young Russian will have a long uphill climb to win his first major final.\n\nSecond set: Nadal leads, 4-2\n\nNadal breaks serve with a deep return, and he now looks to be in control of the match. Medvedev is switching rackets for the next game, and Nadal has visibly started to wear the young Russian down. The Spaniard seems to have the first-time finalist right where he wants him, and now he\u2019s closing in on the second set.\n\nSecond set: Nadal up, 2-1\n\nMedvedev is really making Nadal work for every point here in the second set, and the youngster shows no signs of going away. With better serves, Nadal was able to hold at 30 after he had two well-placed serves \u2014 one down the line and the other out wide. His first serve percentage, poor early, is now up to 54 percent. The second set remains on serve.\n\nFirst set: Nadal wins, 7-5\n\nAfter an hour and three minutes, Nadal grinds out the first set. It\u2019s been a gritty back-and-forth battle, and Medvedev, new to this stage, will look to recover in the second set. Nadal had a run of 14 consecutive service points in the first set as he settled in after a rocky start. Medvedev fell behind repeatedly in the set\u2019s final game, rallying before Nadal won an 18-stroke rally to break serve and claim the set.\n\nIt wasn't easy....\n\n\n\nAfter one hour and three minutes, Nadal grinds out the first set 7-5.#USOpen pic.twitter.com/Yy50GVTKMx \u2014 US Open Tennis (@usopen) September 8, 2019\n\nFirst set: Nadal up, 5-4\n\nDespite Nadal\u2019s uncharacteristically poor first-serve percentage, he has stayed ahead by not allowing Medvedev to get into any sort of rhythm. With Nadal getting back on serve after an early break, the crowd has started to get into the match, applauding Nadal\u2019s shot-making abilities against Medvedev, who had a strong hold in the eighth game.\n\nFirst set: Medvedev leads, 2-1\n\nA solid start for Medvedev, getting the match\u2019s first break of the serve in the third game. After Nadal took the first game, Medvedev came roaring back, pushing away any nerves from appearing in his first major final and taking the following two games. Nadal was issued a time violation while serving in the first game, and nearly had another in the third. The U.S. Open announced in 2018 it would enforce tennis\u2019s time rules via a 25-second \u201cserve clock.\u201d\n\nSetting the scene\n\nThe roof is open at Arthur Ashe Stadium, there was a flyover during the national anthem and with over 22,000 in the stands to watch Nadal vs Medvedev, the stage is set. Scattered boos rained down from the crowd when \u201ctournament villain\u201d Medvedev was introduced, while Nadal was greeted with rousing applause.\n\n\u201cIt means a lot to be back here in this amazing stadium in front of this crowd \u2026 I always have an amazing connection with them,\u201d Nadal told ESPN before taking the court.\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nWhen: Sunday, 4 p.m. Eastern.\n\nWhere: USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, Queens, New York.\n\nTV: ESPN.\n\nStreaming: WatchESPN app and WatchESPN.com.\n\nPre-match reading\n\nNo. 2 seed Rafael Nadal vs No. 5 seed Daniil Medvedev\n\nNadal has made his way into another U.S. Open final Sunday after beating Italian Matteo Berrettini 7-6 (8-6), 6-4, 6-1 in the semifinals. The 33-year-old Spaniard will be playing in his fifth U.S. Open and 27th Grand Slam final as he seeks his fourth U.S. Open title since 2010 and 19th major championship overall. If Nadal executes a much-favored win against Medvedev, he would be one shy of Roger Federer\u2019s record 20. As it stands, Federer leads the way with 20, Nadal is next in line with 18 and Novak Djokovic has 16.\n\nMedvedev, playing in his first major final, is this summer\u2019s hard-court star. The 23-year-old Russian racked up a 20-2 record during the hard-court session, continuing his impressive feats en route to the U.S. Open final, shocking Stan Wawrinka in the quarterfinals and Grigor Dimitrov in the semifinals. Against Nadal, Medvedev will look to break the dominance of the \u201cBig Three Era.\u201d Only one man under the age of 30, Dominic Thiem, has ever won a set in a Grand Slam final. Medvedev, who has become the \u201ctournament villain\u201d after a controversial third-round win in which he aimed a middle-finger gesture to spectators, had never been past the fourth round at a major until now.\n\nThe pair has only met once in a head-to-head matchup, in the Rogers Cup final last month. Nadal dominated, winning 6-3, 6-0.\n\nRead more:\n\nIn U.S. Open final, Bianca Andreescu beats Serena Williams, and history, and the crowd\n\nSerena Williams faces some hard truths after falling short again in a Grand Slam\n\nAt U.S. Open, Althea Gibson statue has become an essential stop\n\nAs ESPN turns 40, its longest-serving voice is still serving stories at the U.S. Open", "description": "Nadal took the first two sets off Medvedev, but the Russian rallied to win the third set in his first Grand Slam final.", "authors": ["Samantha Pell", "Reporter Covering High School Sports"], "top_image": "https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QNP64WWSBQI6TJRABKIWK3L5WY.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
