We\u2019re good enough and we\u2019re strong enough and when you play good, you defend less.\n\n\u201cWhen you don\u2019t play good, you concede a lot. It\u2019s not about having those two defenders and they\u2019re going to defend for 11 players. When your build-up is good, you concede few goals and we conceded few for four seasons.\u201d\n\nTwo of City\u2019s Champions League exits under Guardiola were on away goals to Monaco in 2017 and Tottenham last season and Guardiola says they need to be better defensively as a unit.\n\n(Image: Reuters)\n\n(Image: Manchester Evening News)\n\n\u201cTwo times in the Champions League we went out on goal difference and in both games we conceded a lot of goals,\u201d said the Catalan.\n\n\u201cFor example, we scored four here against Tottenham, five goals against Monaco, but we conceded a lot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about discipline because when we conceded three goals against Tottenham here, it was with Vinnie Kompany and Aymeric Laporte and during the last part of last season they were incredible, they were outstanding.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a case of just defending well, if you play well in all departments, you concede really few. We need to have that mentality.\u201d", "description": "Guardiola had suggested City are not yet ready to conquer Europe but has issued a challenge ahead of the clash with Atalanta", "authors": ["David Anderson", "Image", "Pa", "Reuters", "Manchester Evening News"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20666394.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Manchester-City-Training-Session-and-Press-Conference.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
