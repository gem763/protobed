ESPN first reported the details of the extension.\n\nBeal still had two years left on his existing contract. The extension kicks in for the 2021-22 season, has a player option for the following year and means that Beal won\u2019t be part of what has been shaping up to be an NBA free-agent extravaganza in the summer of 2021.\n\nThe Wizards were willing to give Beal a three-year extension that would have been worth about $111 million over three years. Beal went the two-year route and that protects his future options - he could opt out of the deal in the summer of 2022, coinciding with his 10th year in the league.\n\nThe 10-year milestone is significant: By having that many years of service, Beal would be eligible to sign a new deal worth in excess of $250 million over the next five seasons.\n\nWizards general manager Tommy Sheppard told a story as the team was getting ready to begin training camp of what he says to young players he meets for the first time: Work as hard as Beal.\n\n\u201cIt sounds easy,\u201d Sheppard said. \u201cThen you come in and you see all the work that Bradley puts in every day, all the leadership he exudes every day. He\u2019s shown time and time again how committed he is to D.C.\u201d\n\nBeal has played more minutes than any other NBA player in the last two regular seasons, is one of only five players to not miss a game in that span - and is the lone player to have started all 82 games in both of those seasons.\n\nHe\u2019s an elite scorer, 12th in the league last season at a career-best 25.6 points per game. And he will be the centerpiece again for a Wizards team that\u2019s without point guard John Wall for the entire season as he recovers from an Achilles injury.\n\nSheppard said Beal is poised for yet another big year, and that the way he was interacting with teammates in recent weeks didn\u2019t give him any reason to believe he wasn\u2019t committed to the team.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s ready to play this season,\u201d Sheppard said at his preseason availability last month. \u201cHe\u2019s a fantastic, fantastic person. He makes the whole team be better.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Bradley Beal has agreed on a two-year extension worth nearly $72 million with Washington, a major victory for the Wizards and a move that will keep the All-Star guard out of free agency for at least the next three summers.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Tim Reynolds"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/10/11/wizards_knicks_basketball_54218_c0-141-3391-2119_s1200x700.jpg?95dd0a5b8e7bf34565240bcad09003bff4516f17", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
