Targeted 20mph limits tend to be more effective than blanket limits'.", "description": "New research commissioned by the UK's Department of Transport has found little evidence of safety benefits on roads with 20mph signs unless speed humps or chicanes are also in place.", "authors": ["Jack Newman For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/05/08/19326730-0-image-a-15_1570261094545.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-05"}
