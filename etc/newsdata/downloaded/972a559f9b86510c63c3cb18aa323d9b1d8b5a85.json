While it is unclear whether anyone was injured, the attacks caused a major fire at Saudi Aramco\u2019s Abqaiq facility.\n\nThe company describes the site as \u201cthe largest crude oil stabilization plant in the world.\u201d\n\nThe oil-rich kingdom has temporarily halted the production of roughly 5.7 million barrels per day, but assured customers they will continue to be supplied by backup inventories. Getting back to full production might take weeks.\n\nIn an earlier Sunday tweet, Mr. Trump announced that the U.S. would tap into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \u201cif needed.\u201d\n\n\u201cBased on the attack on Saudi Arabia, which may have an impact on oil prices, I have authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, if needed, in a to-be-determined amount sufficient to keep the markets well-supplied,\u201d Mr. Trump tweeted.\n\nHe also said that the necessary agencies have been advised to speed up the approval process for oil pipelines in Texas and \u201cvarious other States.\u201d\n\nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway said earlier in an interview with \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that the attacks hit areas that are \u201cvital to our global energy supply and we\u2019re not going to stand for that.\u201d\n\nAs the world waits to assess the impact the attacks will have on the global oil markets, which open Monday morning, S&P Global Platts Analytics predicted oil prices are likely to exceed the $55-$65-per-barrel mark and will inch closer to $70-$80 per barrel, possibly higher.\n\nIn the tweet, Iranian Foreign Affairs Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif hinted that \u201cblaming Iran won\u2019t end disaster\u201d in Yemen \u2014 where its citizens are bearing the brunt of a severe humanitarian crisis stemming from the ongoing war \u2014 but engaging in talks might.\n\nIn her \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d interview, Mrs. Conway said Mr. Trump is considering meeting with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York next week.\n\n\u201cThe president will always consider his options,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cthe conditions must always be right\u201d but \u201cwhen you attack Saudi Arabia \u2026 you\u2019re not helping your case much.\u201d\n\nHours later, Mr. Trump strongly disputed the claim. \u201cThe Fake News is saying that I am willing to meet with Iran, \u2018No Conditions.\u2019 That is an incorrect statement (as usual!)\u201d he tweeted.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
