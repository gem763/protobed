But if Nina Ricci has its way, the latest cult-fave accessory just might be a literal bucket worn as a hat or bag\u2014you choose.\n\nOn Friday, Nina Ricci presented its womenswear spring/summer 2020 collection in Paris. Among the looks were organza dresses and jumpsuits, floral blazers and puffy-shouldered blouses in neutral hues. Snakeskin prints mingled among pastel hues like lavender, baby pink, canary and more.\n\nPhoto credit: Estrop - Getty Images More\n\nPhoto credit: Estrop - Getty Images More\n\nPhoto credit: Estrop - Getty Images More\n\nThe exaggerated collars, voluminous silhouettes and cut-out boots were enough to captivate you.
