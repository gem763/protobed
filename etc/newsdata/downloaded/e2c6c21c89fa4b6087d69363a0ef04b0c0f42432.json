This also explains why the left side, which is heading towards the viewer, is brighter than the right side\n\nThis boils down to the Doppler effect, the same phenomenon which distorts the sound of sirens as police cars or ambulances blaze past.\n\nIt causes a bunching effect of the waves heading towards us as they reach a higher frequency, and those going away from us become lower frequency as they move away.\n\nThis is also known as red-shifting and helps researchers study the size and expansion of the universe.\n\n'Simulations and movies like these really help us visualise what Einstein meant when he said that gravity warps the fabric of space and time,' explains Jeremy Schnittman, who generated these gorgeous images using custom software at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\n'Until very recently, these visualisations were limited to our imagination and computer programs.\n\n'I never thought that it would be possible to see a real black hole.'\n\nOn April 11, the world was stunned when the Event Horizon Telescope released the first ever image of a black hole.\n\nThe image, somehow less detailed that the latest computer equivalent, captured radio observations of the heart of the galaxy M87.\n\nOn April 11, the world was stunned when the Event Horizon Telescope released the first ever image of a black hole.
