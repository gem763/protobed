It was scruffy looking and had yellow eyes.\n\n'Loki comes up to my knees and weight 41kg so he is not a small dog. It was a massive thing and I don't know what else it could have been.\n\n'We noticed he was growling and then came back with this scratch mark between his eyes so my husband went into the woodland and that's when he saw it.'\n\nMrs Holmes said the animal was about 60ft away from Loki at the bottom of a hill, adding: 'It was about two or three times bigger than my dog and black. It was scruffy looking and had yellow eyes\n\nThe next day Loki (pictured with Mrs Holmes) - who turns one next week - was struggling to stand up so they took him to the vet, who prescribed anti-inflammatory medicine\n\nMrs Holmes claims her pooch was 'nearly dinner' after a 'panther with yellow eyes' attacked her beloved dog\n\nMrs Holmes, a mother-of-three and a housewife, said the couple took their subdued pet, who had also suffered cuts to his legs, back home.\n\nThe next day Loki - who turns one next week - was struggling to stand up so they took him to the vet, who prescribed anti-inflammatory medicine.\n\nMrs Holmes, from Collyweston, Northamptonshire, added: 'Loki hasn't been himself since it happened. He has just been lying around all day and been really out of sorts.\n\n'It has been a frightening experience and I won't be taking the dog back there. I just don't want anybody else's dog to get hurt.'\n\nMrs Holmes called Northamptonshire Police following the incident and was told that the force had received other reports about big cat sightings in that area.\n\nShe also posted a warning message about the incident in Wakerley Woods, part of Rockingham Forest, near Corby, on Facebook which had been shared more than 1,100 times yesterday.\n\nA friend replied that she had been a passenger in a car when another black panther ran across the road in front of it days earlier at Greetham, 17 miles away in Rutland.\n\nMrs Holmes, from Collyweston, Northamptonshire, added: 'Loki (pictured) hasn't been himself since it happened. He has just been lying around all day and been really out of sorts'\n\nWakerly woods in Northamptonshire where Loki the Labrador cross was attacked by a panther\n\nA Northamptonshire Police spokesman said: 'We had reports of a Rottweiler cross Labrador dog being attacked by a large black cat in Wakerley Woods.\n\n'On finding the dog, their owners noticed it was looking into trees and when they looked, they describe seeing a puma/panther type cat which was bigger than their dog.\n\n'The dog received a claw injury to the face. We have made the Forestry Commission aware as it is their land.'\n\nThe sighting is the latest in a long line of possible big cats seen in Northamptonshire and nearby Rutland.\n\nOn March 31 this year Craig Smith from Kettering was convinced he also saw a panther in Wakerley Wood.\n\nIn 2012 a couple spotted a big cat in the same woodlands, and other sightings have been reported near Gretton.\n\nThere was also a sighting of a big cat in 2008 in Wellingborough. And in 2004 there were six sightings across our area in just two weeks.\n\nChris Lawton, from Rutland Wildlife Sanctuary, said the Wakerley Wood sighting could have been a panther.\n\nHe said: 'There have been a lot of reports of it. A lot of people have had stock going missing such as sheep and lambs.\n\n'We once had a report from someone staying at Barnsdale Lodge saying they saw a big cat coming across the road.'\n\nA Forestry Commission spokesman said: 'We are aware of the report. Wakerley Woods is regularly visited by our local team who would report any unusual sightings.'", "description": "Kayleigh Holmes, 31,told of her shock on Wednesday after her dog was mauled by a 'black panther' during a walk in Wakerly woods in Northamptonshire.", "authors": ["Andy Dolan For The Daily Mail"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/22/19807834-0-image-a-88_1571259915766.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
