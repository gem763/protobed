Stock steps in | CBC Television", "language": "en", "text": "Last week, as we prepared to announce our newly paired teams for Battle of the Blades, we had to hit pause. Hockey player Colby Armstrong, who had been paired with figure skater Violetta Afanasieva, was injured during training. Within several hours it became clear he'd be unable to skate this season. Fortunately, P.J. Stock, who fans will remember as Violetta's on-ice partner in Season 2, has agreed to step in.\n\nColby Armstrong gets injured protecting Violetta Afanasieva from falling during a lift. 0:37\n\nWe spoke with Sandra Bezic, executive producer and co-creator of Battle of the Blades, for details.\n\nWhat exactly happened during training last week?\n\nColby and Violetta were working on a low cantilevered lift. Violetta's body weight got away from his centre. Rather than letting her drop and potentially hit her head, he took the strain himself and as a result tore his hamstring.\n\nFored out of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CBCbattle?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@CBCbattle</a> to injury. I wanted to continue with my partner <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ViolettaHoops?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@ViolettaHoops</a>. Wasn\u2019t able to keep going. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PJStock28?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@PJStock28</a> has my back and stepping up & in my place. I\u2019ll be \ud83d\udc4f from home! Don't screw this up PJ <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CBCbattle?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@CBCbattle</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/b3Sng4mUVL\">pic.twitter.com/b3Sng4mUVL</a> \u2014@armdog\n\nWhat does this mean for the show?\n\nAn injury to one competitor affects them all. It's a reminder of the risk involved and that there are real stakes to every step, every move.\n\nSo sorry partner that this happend.. I had much joy getting to know u & skating with u. Every day u impressed me with fast improvement in your skating & strength in lifting me. Your happy attitude & humor made training process a fun experience! Thank you, Colby! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/botb?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#botb</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/botb5?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#botb5</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/KUq9b55lwy\">https://t.co/KUq9b55lwy</a> \u2014@ViolettaHoops\n\nDo you have any message for Colby?\n\nColby, you captured our hearts with your enthusiasm and humour. Your mom (who is a figure skating coach) would have been really proud of your progress. I'm so sorry that Canadians won't see you perform this season and really hope that after a full recovery you'll come back if there's another season!\n\nAnd what words do you have for P.J.?\n\nP.J., thank you so much for stepping up without hesitation to fill in for a friend. You and Vi were fantastic in Season 2 and we are so excited to see you on the ice together again.\n\nStay tuned for more news on this new pairing. In the meantime, please join us in thanking Colby for his commitment to the series and in wishing him a speedy recovery.", "description": "Working on a lift with partner Violetta Afanasieva, he moved to protect her head as they stumbled, tearing his hamstring in the process.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.cbc.ca/1.5275971.1568041084!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/colby-armstrong-and-violetta-afanasieva-battle-of-the-blades.jpg"}
