Following the Bucs\u2019 31-24 loss to the New Orleans Saints, Arians lit into NFL officials for multiple missed calls. At one point, Arians called their decisions \u201cbaffling.\u201d\n\n[Watch live NFL games on the Yahoo Sports app, here's how]\n\nThere were two plays that drew Arians\u2019 ire during the contest. The first came on a forced fumble by the Buccaneers. With 8:34 left in the first quarter, the Bucs punted to returner Deonte Harris, who fumbled and Bucs tight end Anthony Auclair came out of the pile with the ball. The refs called it a muffed punt, but said Harris recovered.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nArians challenged that play. After review, the officials couldn\u2019t determine a clear recovery by Tampa Bay. Footage apparently showed Auclair clearly gaining possession.\n\nArians said the refs \u201cblew the call.\u201d\n\nArians on review and no reversal on challenge with fumbled punt return: \"They blew the call. Simple. \u2026 Clear recovery on the fumble. The kid ran out of the pile with it, and they knew it before they went to replay. It's all coming from New York.\" \u2014 Greg Auman (@gregauman) October 6, 2019\n\nArians\u2019 second gripe with the officials came on another challenge. The play in question happened at the start of the third quarter. Saints receiver Michael Thomas broke free for a 42-yard gain. Arians believed there was offensive pass interference on the play and threw a challenge flag.\n\nAfter review, the refs declined to call a foul on Thomas.\n\nStory continues\n\nBruce Arians on no-call on offensive pass interference, even after review: \"If that's not, I don't know what the hell is. A two-handed shove that knocked the guy backwards. They said they were hand-fighting. Yeah they were hand-fighting, but that doesn't knock the guy backwards.\" \u2014 Greg Auman (@gregauman) October 6, 2019\n\nArians said the decisions on both challenge plays were \u201cbaffling.\u201d\n\nArians probably knows his words will come with a cost. The NFL doesn\u2019t take kindly to coaches calling out refs. The league has fined a few of them for that type of behavior. Following a win in 2018, Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin received a $25,000 fine for criticizing the refs.\n\nHad either of those calls been reversed, the Bucs might have pulled out a win. Arians will have to deal with that as well as a fine while he prepares to get the Bucs back on track against the Carolina Panthers in Week 6.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nChris Cwik is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
