(Actually, It Never Left.)", "language": "en", "text": "Yet \u201cWatchmen,\u201d for all its laurels, has always had a more muted, or at least less profitable, legacy. Previous efforts to export the comic onto screens have been famously troubled: For years, Terry Gilliam wrestled with a film version that never materialized, and Alan Moore himself once said of the comic, \u201cI tend to think it\u2019s unfilmable.\u201d The director Zack Snyder cashed in the clout he\u2019d earned from \u201c300\u201d to make a \u201cWatchmen\u201d film in 2009, which was criticized both for its excessive fealty to the source material and its inability to capture the ineffable brilliance that made that comic legendary.\n\nYet as we look back from our current, superhero-saturated moment, \u201cWatchmen\u201d stands out as the most influential comic of them all. Its tone and approach has become the de facto language of comic-book narratives. Every costumed-hero tale that takes the motivations and manias of its subjects seriously \u2014 and asks us to take them seriously \u2014 from \u201cKick-Ass\u201d to \u201cAvengers: Endgame\u201d to \u201cJoker\u201d to \u201cArrow\u201d to the Amazon series \u201cThe Boys,\u201d owes its existence to \u201cWatchmen.\u201d That comic not only awakened a generation of fans (and future creators) to the grander possibilities of the genre, it provided a template for how to use superhero tropes to tell thorny human stories. \u201cWatchmen\u201d was not bam-pow theater. It radically undermined the foundational premise of superhero comics themselves. It dared to propose that donning a mask or wrapping yourself in the colors of the flag in order to dispense some version of justice is itself a morally problematic, even questionable, act. \u201cWatchmen\" dissected both the characters who did this and the readers \u2014 us \u2014 who loved them. It challenged, and changed, everything.\n\nSo it\u2019s funny that we find ourselves 30 years later in a world that\u2019s more besotted by caped crusaders than ever. All those serious-minded movies and shows that once seemed so improbable? They now dominate the culture so thoroughly that they threaten to asphyxiate it. For this we also have \u201cWatchmen\u201d to thank, or to blame. One oft-cited example of how indefatigable comics have become is the success of the \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d film franchise \u2014 a series built around a minor and frankly absurd assemblage of Marvel characters that includes a talking raccoon and a sentient tree. What\u2019s less often noted is that James Gunn, who adapted \u201cGuardians,\u201d was hired by Marvel on the strength of his 2010 indie film, \u201cSuper,\u201d a dark and violent comedy about a short-order cook who dons a homemade costume to save his wife from drug dealers. \u201cSuper\u201d was not a hit but it paved the way for \u201cGuardians.\" And it\u2019s exactly the kind of masks-as-metaphors interrogation of our love for superheroes that could only exist in a post-\u201cWatchmen\u201d world.", "description": "A new adaptation of the graphic novel \u201cWatchmen\u201d is coming to HBO.
