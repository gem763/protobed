Musk said he would assist in the rescue by building a miniature submarine to fetch the boys.\n\nAfter one of the divers who assisted with the rescue, Vernon Unsworth, appeared on TV to criticise Musk's idea and describe it as a publicity stunt, Musk retaliated by calling Unsworth a \"pedo guy\" on Twitter.\n\nUnsworth filed a defamation suit in the US in September 2018.\n\nBritish cave expert Vernon Unsworth. Sakchai Lalit / AP\n\nIn filings from the case made public on Monday, Musk said that he hadn't meant \"pedo guy\" in a literal sense.\n\n\"'Pedo guy' was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up,\" he said, according to the filings. \"It is synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person's appearance and demeanor, not accuse a person of acts of pedophilia.\"\n\nPreviously Musk's lawyers have also argued that the \"pedo guy\" comment cannot be considered defamation because it was made on Twitter, where discourse is \"rough-and-tumble.\"\n\nRead more: An aide to Elon Musk hired a private investigator to look into the diver Musk called a 'pedo guy'\n\nStill, the court filings also revealed that Musk had set a private investigator to the task of investigating Unsworth after tweeting the insult.\n\nMusk said in his deposition it was this investigator's findings that led him to double down on the remark and call Unsworth a \"child rapist\" in a September email to BuzzFeed reporter Ryan Mac.\n\n\"I was like, well, what if this is a real situation? What if what we have here is another Jeffrey Epstein,\" Musk said, according to the filings. \"We should, you know \u2014 I have this \u2014 I am told this information. I don't know if it is true. But what if we have another Jeffrey Epstein on our hands? And what if he uses whatever celebrity he gains from this cave rescue to shield his bad deeds? This would be terrible.\"\n\nThe lawyer questioning Musk pointed out that Epstein wasn't in the news when Musk corresponded with the BuzzFeed reporter in September 2018.\n\nJeffrey Epstein's case only returned to the spotlight when the Miami Herald published a major investigation in November 2018, two months after Musk had hired a PI to look into Unsworth.\n\nMusk responded to this apparent discrepancy with: \"Yes. I'm using this as an example of, you know, if this guy is actually doing bad things and could potentially be using the good reputation acquired from the cave rescue to do bad things,\" Musk replied.\n\nMusk added that he had never spoken to the PI directly.\n\nIn a court filing Jared Birchall, the president of Musk's family office, said the PI reported to him that Unsworth had met his wife when she was eleven or twelve, and that he had been unpopular in the cave rescue team because he was \"creepy.\" In his deposition Musk said that he now believes the investigator was \"just taking us for a ride.\"\n\nMusk's name has cropped up in reporting about Jeffrey Epstein's movements among the Silicon Valley elite. Epstein told a New York Times reporter he had advised Musk during Tesla's tumultuous summer of 2018, which Musk denies. Musk also attended an elite private dinner in 2011 along with other tech moguls including Jeff Bezos at which Epstein was in attendance.\n\nYou can read Elon Musk's deposition below, starting at page 38:", "description": "Elon Musk said he became worried Unsworth could be a pedophile after his aide hired a PI to investigate.
