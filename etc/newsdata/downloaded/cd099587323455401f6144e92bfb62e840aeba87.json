Greg Sandoval/Business Insider\n\nThe statement follows after the Commission released the first annual self-assessment reports from Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Mozilla, and Twitter on their adherence to the Code of Practice on Disinformation. First launched in October 2018, the Code of Practice was created as a form of non-binding legislation for tech companies meant to encourage self-regulation on their platforms rather than having the EU step in with sweeping legislation.\n\nThe statement signals that more aggressive proposals \u2014 which move beyond non-binding suggestions \u2014 will emerge from the EU in 2020. The Commission plans to release a comprehensive analysis of its findings in early 2020 that will be used to determine if regulatory measures are needed. But in the statements made yesterday, discounting the recent efforts made by social media companies, the commissioners cited an urgent need for tech companies to cooperate with a wider range of independent organizations.\n\nThey also said that the data currently provided by tech companies is insufficient for the needs of third-party researchers. And EU president-elect Ursula von der Leyen, who takes office November 1, has already publicly committed to passing the Digital Services Act in her first 100 days in office. The Digital Services Act will be a comprehensive piece of legislation similar to GDPR, aimed at addressing illegal content on digital platforms as well as regulating the role of algorithms in content moderation and advertising transparency.\n\nThe EU's aggressive policy stance on regulating content on social media platforms will likely face new complications from individual member governments. If EU member states disagree on how platforms should be regulated, that could slow the process of determining a unified standard for platform moderation. That means comprehensive rules could take years to even develop, much less implement and enforce.\n\nWhile GDPR was approved by the EU parliament only 20 days after it was introduced in the Official Journal of the European Union and took effect after a two-year transition period, it had the advantage of being legislation in a completely new area where most countries lacked existing laws. On the other hand, regulating content published on social media and other digital platforms enters into discussions more sensitive to individual countries as it deals with free speech laws.\n\nDisputes have already arisen between the EU and its member governments in this vein when an Austrian politician demanded comments on Facebook made by an Austrian magazine be taken down. Ultimately, the EU Supreme Court ruled the posts not only had to be taken down in Austria but globally, posing concerns about the rights of one government to remove content available in another.\n\nWant to read more stories like this one?
