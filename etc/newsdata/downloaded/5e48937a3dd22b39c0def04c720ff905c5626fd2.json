But China Is Shaping America.", "language": "en", "text": "Read: China bends another American institution to its will\n\nSo now we come to the brouhaha over an October 4th tweet by Houston Rockets general manager Daryl Morey expressing support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. Underlying the firestorm caused by one opinion from one guy in Houston is a broader worry that what America considered its historical mission in China \u2013 bringing free-ish markets that would lead to freer people \u2014 has failed. But not only that.\n\nEven as policy makers fret that China\u2019s government immunized itself from the baleful influence of Western values, they see that it has begun to turn the tables and is exporting its ideology around the world. In short, China has begun to shape and manage us, not the other way around.\n\nWhen Morey sent out a tweet that included an image saying, \u201cFight for freedom, stand with Hong Kong,\u201d China\u2019s government girded itself for a battle with the National Basketball Association. State-owned television and the Chinese internet giant Tencent suspended broadcasts of preseason NBA games. A slew of Chinese companies announced that they were putting sponsorships with the league on hold. China Central Television issued a statement calling for severe limits on freedom of speech. And Geng Shuang, a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, suggested that he expected the NBA to follow the playbook of other corporations and kowtow. \u201cThe N.B.A. has been in cooperation with China for many years,\u201d he said at a briefing last week. \u201cIt knows clearly in its heart what to say and what to do.\u201d\n\nThe NBA\u2019s playbook mirrored that of other organizations that have gotten sidewise with Beijing. Initially it waffled. Then NBA Commissioner Adam Silver put out a statement supporting Morey\u2019s freedom of speech. But in its Chinese-language statements the NBA sounded significantly more apologetic than in its English ones. This is a tried and true formula. The Chinese language is the first level of encryption. Who cares if you sound spineless in Chinese when you\u2019re stalwart in English. What\u2019s worse, other leading voices in the NBA sought to muddy Silver\u2019s message. Prominent NBA coaches, Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr dodged questions on the issue. Rockets stars James Harden and Russell Westbrook, who make a considerable amount of money in China through the sales of merchandise and shoes, announced on Twitter: \u201cWe apologize. We love China.\u201d On Sunday, LeBron James said he thought Morey wasn\u2019t \u201ceducated\u201d on the situation.\n\nBut even the NBA\u2019s half-hearted nod to Western values is more than most international corporations can muster. When it comes to dealing with China, the league is the exception that is validating concerns about China\u2019s growing ability to do to the developed world what the developed has failed to do to China.\n\nOne reason that the NBA is different, of course, is that unlike normal businesses, where China can play competitors off one another, no one can vie with the league. Especially not the alternative, which in China\u2019s case would be the Chinese Basketball Association. Despite massive investments and the fact that the CBA is now led by former Rockets\u2019 star Yao Ming, the CBA is a joke, proffering bad basketball in arenas with no heat. China\u2019s national team, which is comprised of CBA all-stars, might not even make it to the 2022 Tokyo Olympics after its dismal showing at the FIBA World Cup over the summer.", "description": "It goes beyond the NBA\u2014U.S. companies doing business in China are hamstrung by the country\u2019s whims.", "authors": ["John Pomfret", "Former Beijing Bureau Chief For"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2R8L2/facebook.jpg?1571171702", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
