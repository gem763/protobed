Don\u2019t buy into the NCAA\u2019s propaganda.", "language": "en", "text": "For years, it has been against NCAA rules for a student on an athletic scholarship to be paid by anyone beyond the value of his or her scholarship: not by the school and not by anyone outside the school \u2014 whether it be a company that wants help pitching a product, someone who wants to pay for autographs or an appearance, or a company that aims to sell a jersey with a star player\u2019s name on it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nYou can pay the school, but not the athlete.\n\nEven before Newsom signed the bill, NCAA President Mark Emmert was wailing about how disastrous this would be for college athletics and making veiled threats about being forced to declare \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d from California ineligible if they accepted any outside money.\n\nEmmert suggested the lawmakers should mind their own business and let the NCAA\u2019s \u201crules-making process\u201d work the problem out.\n\nLeaving the issue in the hands of college presidents and administrators is a little bit like accepting the word of the fox who says he\u2019ll protect the henhouse.\n\nNo one is buying what Emmert \u2014 or anyone else in the NCAA \u2014 is selling. The Pac-12 Conference put out a statement Monday claiming the law would have a \u201cvery significant negative\u201d effect on college athletics because it would blur the line between college and professional sports.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nSeriously? The NCAA sold its soul to TV long ago. It has a $6 billion contract with ESPN for the rights to its football playoff. CBS and Turner will soon be paying the NCAA more than $1 billion a year for the rights to its basketball tournament through 2032. One part of the basketball deal gives TV the right to decide when games will be played \u2014 which often means those \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d are asked to start games after 10 p.m. local time.\n\nFor the record: \u201cStudent-athlete\u201d is a redundancy. By rule, one has to be a registered student to be a college athlete. It\u2019s like calling someone a \u201cperson-man\u201d or \u201cperson-woman.\u201d The NCAA has employed the term for years to fool people into thinking big-time college athletes are studying advanced calculus in the locker room. I\u2019ve traveled with college teams often. I can\u2019t count on one hand the number of \u201cstudent-athletes\u201d I\u2019ve seen working at being students.\n\nSure, some \u2014 mostly non-stars \u2014 graduate. But most of the ones who will go on to be professionals are out the door first chance they get: After one year in basketball; three in football. Those are the rules.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThey are professionals in every way \u2014 except that they get paid nothing while everyone around them cashes in. Emmert is paid north of $2 million by the NCAA. Larry Scott, the commissioner of the Pac-12 whose statement (which Scott didn\u2019t even have the guts to sign) on the new law also wailed about how this would negatively affect nonrevenue athletes, makes more than $5 million annually.\n\nThe notion that athletes in the two revenue sports \u2014 football and men\u2019s basketball \u2014 making outside money might hurt nonrevenue athletes is an Emperor\u2019s New Clothes fabrication. There\u2019s nothing there. Under California\u2019s approach the school will not pay the athletes anything beyond their scholarship. No swimmers, field hockey players or soccer players will be harmed \u2014 at all.\n\nHere\u2019s why the NCAA is in such a state of panic: Other states are already lining up to pass similar legislation. Emmert\u2019s threat to declare athletes ineligible will be pretty empty if he has to suspend star players \u2014 the ones who do the most to bring in the TV dollars \u2014 across the country. Blessedly, this is the end of the line for the NCAA\u2019s \u201cshow me all the money\u201d approach.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nOne more note to anyone who might buy into the NCAA\u2019s propaganda. In 1975 when an arbitrator overturned baseball\u2019s reserve clause \u2014 which tied a player to a team for life \u2014 Commissioner Bowie Kuhn said this : \u201cThe reserve system . . . is necessary to protect not only the integrity of the game, but the economic viability of the game.\u201d He went on to predict that free agency would mean the loss of teams and \u201cnot inconceivably the loss of a major league.\u201d\n\nAll professional sports now have free agency. There are more teams than ever and more money than ever. College sports will continue to thrive. It will just do so in a manner that is finally fair and just to the athletes.\n\nNo wonder the old men in suits are terrified. Fair and just aren\u2019t terms they\u2019re familiar with.\n\nAD\n\nJohn Feinstein is a Post contributor and author.
