His administration has suspended some newspapers, arrested opposition leaders and restricted political rallies. The government has rejected the criticism.\n\nLissu\u2019s expulsion could further weaken the opposition\u2019s voice in parliament, where the ruling party enjoys a commanding majority with about 75 percent of all seats, analysts say.\n\n\u201cHow could we be part of the oath while Lissu has been unfairly expelled from parliament? Everybody knows that he is currently still receiving medical treatment,\u201d opposition MP Esther Bulaya, who joined other CHADEMA lawmakers to boycott the brief swearing-in ceremony of the new ruling party member of parliament, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very cruel ... this raises questions if authorities are really interested in having a multi-party democracy in place in our country,\u201d Bulaya said by phone from Tanzania\u2019s capital Dodoma where the national assembly meets.\n\nNational assembly speaker Job Ndugai has defended the decision to remove Lissu from his seat, saying he breached parliamentary procedures.\n\nLissu has filed a case in Tanzania\u2019s commercial capital Dar es Salaam to challenge his expulsion.\n\nHis lawyers lost a bid on Monday for a court injunction to block the swearing in of the ruling party MP who took his former seat, but the court is expected to rule next week over the legality of his expulsion.\n\nMagufuli condemned Lissu\u2019s attempted assassination in 2017 and called for a swift investigation. No suspects have been arrested. Local media reported that Lissu vowed to return to Tanzania this week to resume his political activities.\n\nSome analysts see Lissu as a possible front-runner to become the main opposition presidential candidate in next year\u2019s general election to challenge Magufuli\u2019s bid for a second and final term in office.", "description": "Opposition lawmakers in Tanzania on Tuesday boycotted the swearing in of a ruling party lawmaker who replaced a fierce critic of the president following his expulsion from parliament.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png"}
