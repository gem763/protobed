Still, the way in which this reconsideration is taking place should itself be reconsidered.\n\nThe typical framing of the debate runs something like this. Either you support a substantive, morally informed conception of the political common good, or you support the putatively purely formal procedures of political liberalism.\n\nEither you support public morality, or you support civil liberties.\n\nThese are false dichotomies.\n\nThis discussion is best understood not as an \u201ceither-or\u201d but as a \u201cboth-and.\u201d The essential intellectual work involves thinking through how to understand the \u201cand\u201d at the theoretical level, and then fleshing out how to embody and implement that \u201cand\u201d at a practical level.\n\nAmerican conservatives need to figure out how to understand the relationship between the substance of the common good and formal political procedures, between public morality and civil liberties.\n\nAssuming that we must make a choice between each of these pairs is fundamentally misguided, because it fails to recognize the many ways in which formal procedures serve the common good, and are, indeed, part\u2014but not the whole\u2014of its substance. It fails to see that both public morality and civil liberties are crucial to the political common good.\n\nPolitical Authority and Human Nature\n\nIn the forthcoming Fall issue of National Affairs, Robert P. George and I sort through some of these theoretical questions. We explain how rejecting Lockean, Rawlsian, and various supposedly \u201cneutralist\u201d forms of liberalism as philosophically misguided, which we do, need not\u2014indeed, should not\u2014lead us to reject certain political institutions that carry the label \u201cliberal.\u201d\n\nWe argue that, for example, the political institutions and practices surrounding property rights, the free exercise of religion, and the freedom of speech are justified because of\u2014and hence limited by\u2014the demands of justice and the common good.\n\nThese so-called \u201cliberal\u201d practices have a more secure foundation in a political theory flowing from the Aristotelian-Thomistic tradition of thought.\n\nThis tradition understands justified political authority as flowing from human nature. Man is by nature a political animal, and justified political authority is concerned with promoting the common good.\n\nThis requires us, however, to consider \u201chuman nature\u201d in two distinct ways.\n\nFirst, we must consider human nature in terms of human flourishing, and its constitutive aspects, and ask in which ways political authority can effectively protect and promote human well-being.\n\nSecond, we must consider human nature in terms of human fallibility and fallenness, and ask in which ways political authority can be misused to undermine human flourishing.\n\nBecause objective good and bad, right and wrong, will not always track with public opinion, popular vote, and government administration, political theory is more than just applied moral theory, for it necessarily concerns how political power is to be structured.\n\nPolitical theory requires not only knowledge of the ends of governance\u2014the common good\u2014but knowledge of how best to deploy and structure means to arrive at those ends.\n\nThe task for any sound constitutionalism is to structure government power so as to make it as likely as humanly possible that it promotes the common good, and to limit government so as to make it as unlikely as humanly possible that it will undermine that good.\n\nRecognizing limits on the reach of government\u2014even a government that sincerely wishes to promote a sound conception of the common good\u2014is as important as recognizing the legitimate goals of government to promote that good.\n\nHence, it isn\u2019t \u201cmoral relativism\u201d to limit\u2014precisely for moral reasons\u2014the government\u2019s authority (jurisdiction) to make certain moral judgments.\n\nIn other words: The various structures and procedures of government, if they are justified, should exist precisely to help effectively promote the common good.\n\nRights, Liberties, and Procedural Protections Aren\u2019t Optional\n\nWhile it\u2019s (obviously) true that procedures aren\u2019t enough, it\u2019s also (obviously) true that they aren\u2019t morally optional either.\n\nCertain rights and liberties are constitutive aspects of the political common good\u2014the rights to life and religious liberty, for example\u2014while other rights and liberties are important procedural protections that overall and in the long run tend to best promote the common good in practice\u2014freedom of the press and private property rights, for example.\n\nCertain rights and liberties should be understood as important substantive aspects of the common good, and others as important procedural constraints that prevent the abuse of governmental authority.\n\nAs we explain in National Affairs, this entails that certain political rights aren\u2019t absolutes but can take a variety of forms. There is no uniquely correct institutional arrangement or structure, and philosophy or theology alone can\u2019t provide the answers to political questions.\n\nHistorical experience, prudent prediction, and technical expertise are all required to take sound philosophical and theological principles and embody them in law and policy to best promote the common good here and now.\n\nAgain, it is critically important that we avoid offering ourselves false alternatives, when in reality the important work is in thinking about which procedures best serve the common good and how civil liberties and public morality can coexist and even reinforce each other.\n\nPolitics Is Practical\n\nWe must also avoid supposing that theoretical claims about the purpose of government could, on their own, provide answers to the questions facing us today.\n\nShowing that John Locke was wrong\u2014as he was in crucial respects\u2014about the nature and content of the political common good can\u2019t tell us what\u2019s the right thing to do here and now.\n\nPolitics is practical. It\u2019s concerned with how we should order our lives together in the concrete, given all the givens. It\u2019s directed at action, not abstraction. Thus, it must be concerned with practicalities.\n\nHow, here and now, given the composition of this nation, its history, its beliefs, its pluralism, diversity, and disagreement, should we structure government power (constitutionalism) and exercise it (governance)?\n\nWhat procedures, overall and in the long run, are most likely to produce substantively just outcomes, to effectively promote the common good\u2014a good that does not consist only in preserving the liberty of everyone to pursue his or her purely private, subjective conceptions of the good?\n\nHaving rejected the liberty-only conception, how do we define the common good of this particular people at this particular time? Answering these questions requires not just theoretical knowledge, but practical wisdom.\n\nThis is crucial, given the challenges facing conservatives today. Given all the givens\u2014the deep political divisions among the American people, the widespread disagreements about morality, and the deeply divergent public opinion on some of the most central questions of human identity and sexuality, in particular\u2014how do we best exercise government authority to protect and promote the common good?\n\nToo much of the current debate has centered on President Donald Trump\u2014relitigating the 2016 election and jockeying for the 2020 election. But what can and should be done now so that when an administration more hostile to conservatives\u2019 moral convictions takes power, it does as little damage to the common good as possible?\n\nWhat can and should be done now to prevent the next administration from issuing another Dear Colleague Letter imposing a transgender bathroom policy on every school in the nation? (Answer: The Civil Rights Uniformity Act, clarifying that the word \u201csex\u201d in our nation\u2019s civil rights laws does not mean \u201cgender identity.\u201d)\n\nWhat can and should be done now to prevent the next administration from shutting down Catholic adoption agencies or revoking the nonprofit tax status of evangelical colleges that don\u2019t endorse same-sex marriage? (Answer: A more robust version of the First Amendment Defense Act.)\n\nSeeking Virtue\n\nPerhaps the best way to show how proper procedures can serve the common good is to take an example outside politics.\n\nConsider the academy and the intellectual virtues and procedures for arriving at the common good of knowledge of the truth.\n\nTo become a scholar, one submits to an apprenticeship in learning. One follows certain procedures in terms of curriculum, language requirements, examinations, and original research\u2014all of which are meant to help develop a certain disposition and temperament to love truth more than opinion or personality, and to actually acquire certain knowledge of truth and the skills to continue acquiring such knowledge for a lifetime.\n\nThese virtues and procedures apply not just to students but to professors, too.\n\nIf you want an academy to be more than an indoctrination camp, you need scholars who have the requisite knowledge and a breadth and depth of wisdom that goes beyond narrow specialization. You want those scholars to have good judgment and an appropriate temperament for discussing ideas.\n\nYou want the scholars to be free to follow their research\u2014the evidence and the arguments\u2014wherever it leads them.\n\nThus, you want a variety of academic freedom protections, and you want to reward meaningful scholarship and teaching, not academic clickbait meant only to add a line on a CV.\n\nAlas, the debate about the future of conservatism has not sufficiently embodied these intellectual virtues or procedures (nor, alas, does the contemporary academy\u2014but that\u2019s a subject for a different essay).\n\nAs a result, a discussion of ideas has come across to the public as something of a food fight among conservative writers, despite the fact that the leading participants in the debate are morally and intellectually serious people who have made important contributions to the discussion of urgent issues in contemporary law and politics.\n\nWe can do better. We must do better.\n\nDavid French, Sohrab Ahmari, and others who are debating the future of conservatism at this pivotal moment are right to think that the challenges facing our nation are grave. They are also right to suppose that contemporary progressivism, which is becoming increasingly dogmatic and authoritarian, represents a serious threat to both substantive and procedural justice.\n\nWhile neither French nor Ahmari is entirely correct, we need not feel forced into cheering for one side or the other, into viewing this as a matter of \u201cteams.\u201d\n\nWe conservatives need to keep the main focus on ideas, not personalities. We need to think prudently about practical steps we should take\u2014here and now, given all the givens\u2014that will promote the common good.\n\nWe need to exercise the intellectual virtues that allow us to arrive at knowledge of the truth through the give and take of argument in community. And thus we need to engage each other both robustly and charitably.\n\nAgain: both-and.", "description": "In a series of high-profile exchanges, conservatives are returning to first principles, reconsidering how best to protect and promote human dignity and the common good.\u00a0\n\nThis is to be applauded.
