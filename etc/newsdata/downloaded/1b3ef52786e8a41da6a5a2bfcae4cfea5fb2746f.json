Additionally, it is the intent of this act to ease and improve the reporting of where these collisions occur in order to generate the necessary information to develop appropriate prevention strategies, such as wildlife crossings. Each year it is estimated that over 20,000 deer alone are hit by motor vehicles on California\u2019s roadways. This potentially translates into hundreds of thousands of pounds of healthy meat that could be used to feed those in need.\n\nThe Sacramento Bee reported that California is not the only state to use the road kill to table model:\n\nPreviously, it was against the law for anyone but state and local agencies to remove an animal carcass from the road. California now joins approximately half the country in allowing drivers to harvest roadkill. Deer account for approximately 90 percent of all wildlife collisions in California, according to research from UC Davis, while elk and pig account for less than 1 percent each.\n\nEater San Francisco reported:\n\nWhile drivers are welcome to cook roadkill themselves \u2014 experts recommend checking for glass and debris as well as cooking the meat at high temperatures \u2014 they won\u2019t be able to share their \u2018salvages\u2019 with some California food banks just yet. A representative for the SF-Marin Food Bank tells Eater SF that the food bank only accepts protein from facilities with a USDA inspector on-site and with USDA seals on their packaging, for food safety purposes.\n\n\u201cAnd whether or not chefs choose to incorporate \u2018salvage\u2019 dishes on their menus remains to be seen,\u201d the website reported.\n\nThe Sacramento Bee reported that the law sunsets on Jan. 1, 2029.\n\nFollow Penny Starr on Twitter", "description": "A Californaia law creates a pilot program to allow deer and other wildlife killed on highways to be used as a food source.", "authors": ["Penny Starr"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Deer-Crossing-Street-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
