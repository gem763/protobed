Sunil Godhwani, the erstwhile head of the financial services company the Singh brothers once helmed, was among the others who were arrested.\n\nThe accused, with \"absolute control on Religare Enterprises Ltd. and its subsidiaries put Religare Finvest Ltd in poor financial condition by way of disbursing loans to companies having no financial standing,\" the Delhi Police said in the statement. The companies receiving these sums \"willfully defaulted in repayments\" causing a loss of 23.97 billion rupees(S$464.7 million), it added.\n\nThe authorities are still searching for Shivinder's elder brother Malvinder Singh, an official at the Economic Offences Wing said asking not to be identified citing rules.\n\nsentifi.com Market voices on:\n\nThe arrests mark the beginning of the final act in the precipitous fall of what was once one of India's most prominent business families. The Singh brothers were heirs to an empire that included India's top drug maker, and later its second-largest hospital chain.
