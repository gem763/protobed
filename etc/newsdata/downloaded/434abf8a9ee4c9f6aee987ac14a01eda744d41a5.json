Thousands of cattle and other livestock were found dead with the reproductive organs, and sometimes part of their faces, removed, in territory ranging from Minnesota to New Mexico.\n\nRanchers began carrying guns and nearby residents said helicopters had been heard around the kill sites. A federal agency cancelled an inventory by helicopter of its lands in Colorado, worried that it would get shot down.\n\nTwo US senators urged the FBI to investigate, according to FBI documents. After saying it lacked jurisdiction, the FBI agreed to investigate cases on tribal lands. But the mutilations stopped.\n\nFormer FBI agent Kenneth Rommel, who headed the investigation, said there was no indication that anything other than common predators were responsible.\n\nCases have emerged sporadically since then. In the 1980s, a few cows were found dead and mutilated in eastern Oregon. More recently, there have been cases on a ranch near Flagstaff, Arizona.\n\nSome of the mutilations can be attributed to natural causes. An animal drops dead, the blood pools at the bottom of the carcass, the carcass bloats and the skin dries out and splits. The tears often appear surgical. Carrion bugs, birds and other scavengers go for soft tissues like rectum, genitals, udders and eyes.\n\nDave Bohnert, director of Oregon State University's Eastern Oregon Agricultural Research Center in Burns, said he believed people killed the Silvies bulls because there was no indication they were felled by predators or had eaten poisonous plants.\n\nHowever, the state of the carcasses could be attributable to nature, said Mr Bohnert, who is not officially investigating the case.\n\nIf people killed the bulls, a motive could be to financially harm the ranch, he said, noting that breeding bulls cost thousands of dollars each, and the 100-plus calves each of them sire are collectively worth much more.\n\nMr Marshall doubts it was a malicious attack on the ranch, which employs 75 people, many from local communities. Silvies Valley Ranch covers 140,000 acres (57,000 hectares) of deeded and leased National Forest lands around a mile above sea level.\n\nIn 2006, a wealthy veterinarian bought the ranch and made it a combination working ranch and an elite destination resort. It has four golf courses, a spa, shooting ranges, fishing and luxury cabins going for up to $849 per night.\n\nMr Marshall suspects the bulls were killed to get the organs of the free-ranging bulls for some reason. The bull parts would be available cheaply or free at a slaughterhouse, but he believes some people are going to a lot of trouble to get these parts on the range.\n\nThere's no sign that scavengers removed the organs of the bulls, and instead someone using a knife or scalpel probably did, Mr Marshall said.\n\n\"To lose a completely healthy animal would be an oddity,\" Mr Marshall said. \"To lose five young, very healthy, in great shape, perfect bulls that are all basically the same age ... that is so outside the bounds of normal activity.\"\n\nMr Marshall speculates the bulls were darted with a tranquiliser that knocked them out. While some people acted as lookouts, others bled the animals out by inserting a large-gauge needle into the tongue and into an artery, then removed the organs after the heart stopped beating, he surmised.\n\nMr Jenkins, the deputy, has a similar theory.\n\n\"Personally, I would lean more toward the occult, where people for whatever reason - whether it's a phase of the moon or whatever rituals they're going to do with their beliefs - are coming to different areas and doing that,\" he said.\n\nThe Oregon Cattlemen's Association is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of those responsible. The ranch is offering $25,000.\n\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press", "description": "Bulls have been found mutilated, killed and left with their blood drained and their sex organs removed, police in the US have said.
