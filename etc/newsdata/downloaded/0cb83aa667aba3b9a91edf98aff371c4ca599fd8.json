He visits during Eid holidays only,\u201d she said, referring to annual Muslim holidays that follow the fasting month of Ramadan.\n\n\u201cOne day I will also visit him by taking an airplane,\u201d she said as her face lit up.\n\nHameeda is one of more than 1 million child brides in Pakistan despite laws meant to make it illegal for girls to marry before age 16. A bill in Parliament would raise the minimum age to 18, but it faces opposition by religious conservatives. This time, however, child advocates say something has to be done.\n\n\u201cChild marriage is one of the worst human rights violations,\u201d said Samar Minallah Khan, an independent anthropologist and child rights advocate based in Islamabad. \u201cIt puts an end to a child\u2019s right to freedom, education and to play. It takes away their childhood. They cannot be children anymore.\u201d\n\nWith an estimated 1,909,000 children currently married, Pakistan has the sixth-highest rate of child marriage in the world, according to UNICEF.\n\nThe problems are not just cultural. The U.N. World Health Organization notes that the leading causes of death for females ages 15 to 19 are linked to pregnancy and childbirth. Babies born to girls younger than 18 are at higher risks of death and poor development, the WHO report said.\n\nAbout 650 million girls and women alive today were married before age 18 \u2014 roughly 17% of the world\u2019s female population, according to UNICEF.\n\nIn Pakistan, 21% of girls are married off before their 18th birthday, including 3% before age 15.\n\nMost child brides marry men three to four times older.\n\n\u201cParents want to get rid of their young girls as soon as they reach puberty. The mindset is that they are considered to be a burden,\u201d said Rubina Saigol, a child advocate in Lahore. After the marriage, \u201cthe girl is property of another home and belongs there \u2014 and therefore has to be taken care of there.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is rooted in economic reasons, with this idea is the girl is only an entity, not a human being with any human or property rights,\u201d she said. \u201cThe son, however, is considered the breadwinner.\u201d\n\nLast month, a 7-year-old girl was given in marriage to a 28-year-old man in a village in Punjab in central Pakistan. The police raided the ceremony and arrested the bridegroom. In June, a 60-year-old man was arrested as he was about to marry a 12-year-old girl in Sadiqabad in southern Pakistan. A 45-year-old man married a 10-year-old girl in Sindh in southern Pakistan in May. He was arrested.\n\nStalemate\n\nPakistani law sets the minimum marriage age at 16 for girls and 18 for boys. Activists say the age must be raised and the law better enforced. Pakistan is also a signatory to international agreements such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child that require enforcement of laws to prevent child marriage.\n\nIn May, the ruling party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party introduced a bill in the legislature to amend the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 1929 to set the marriageable age for girls at 18. It would impose a fine and possible imprisonment for the groom and those involved in facilitating the marriage, including parents, marriage brokers and the religious authorities who marry the couple.\n\nPakistan\u2019s National Assembly Standing Committee on Law and Justice last week rejected such legislation. Opponents said it violated religious tenets.\n\n\u201cI will never support any legislation that is against the tenets of Islam,\u201d said Ali Muhammad Khan, minister of state for parliamentary affairs. \u201cPakistan is an Islamic country, and no such law can be passed here even if it costs me my ministry or my seat [in Parliament].\u201d\n\nQibla Ayaz, chairman of Pakistan\u2019s Council of Islamic Ideology, said, \u201cIn 1961, the minimum age for marriage was set to 16, which was un-Islamic. It will be going again against the Shariah [Islamic law] if the age of marriage is changed to 18.\u201d\n\nAs it has with all other attempts to amend the marriageable age for girls, the council warned that any legislation to ban child marriage would lead to \u201ccomplications.\u201d It asked instead for an awareness campaign to discourage the practice.\n\nOfficials advocating a change expressed disappointment.\n\n\u201cWhat hopes can one really attribute to a society [where] 50 elected representatives and even ministers actually voted for underage marriage? Should be enough to give sleepless [nights],\u201d said a tweet by Fawad Chaudhry, minister of science and technology.\n\nActivists say the issue has never been a priority and that the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan pays only lip service to it.\n\nThe Khan government \u201cis an extremely conservative, right-wing one. They have no interest or will to do anything in issues like child marriages,\u201d said Ms. Saigol. \u201cThey are focused on other things, and this is not a priority for them. Every other day we hear of underage girls being married or Hindu girls\u2019 abduction [for marriage], but it doesn\u2019t bother the government much.\u201d\n\nHameeda, meanwhile, waits for her child to be born. She said her biggest problem is that she doesn\u2019t have that much to do and being in her second trimester is limiting. She said she once hoped to be a schoolteacher for girls in her village. Marriage ended that dream.\n\n\u201cI would have made a difference for my community,\u201d she said.\n\nNow, she said, the child will at least reduce her boredom.\n\n\u201cSince my husband is away most of the time, I feel my child will be a good distraction for me,\u201d she said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
