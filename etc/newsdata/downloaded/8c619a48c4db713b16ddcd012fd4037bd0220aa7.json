He woke up today a lot worse. So Joe Ross will start today.\n\n\u201cAnd if you all know Max, obviously he pitched with a broken nose, he\u2019s been hurt before, he\u2019s gotten through things. When he comes in and says he\u2019s hurt this bad, he\u2019s hurt. And I can tell you now he\u2019s very upset. He wants to be out there with his teammates.\u201d\n\nMartinez said that Scherzer began to experience pain when waking up Saturday and it worsened overnight into Sunday. After the injury didn\u2019t improve following treatment from the Nationals\u2019 medical staff, Martinez opted to replace him.\n\n\u201cI woke up this morning completely locked up. I couldn\u2019t even dress myself,\u201d Scherzer said Sunday. \u201cI\u2019ve pitched through so much crap in my career that would be easy to pitch through at this point. This is literally impossible to do anything with.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just hoping that the doctors are right and something could be possible for Game 7.\u201d\n\nRoss will face Astros ace Gerrit Cole in Sunday night\u2019s game, with the best-of-seven series tied at two games apiece. Ross has made only one appearance this postseason, coming out of the bullpen during Game 3 of the World Series on Friday.\n\nMartinez said he expects Stephen Strasburg will take the mound for Tuesday\u2019s Game 6 in Houston.", "description": "Oct. 27 (UPI) \u2014 The Washington Nationals will turn to right-hander Joe Ross instead of Max Scherzer for Game 5 of the 2019 World Series on Sunday at", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
