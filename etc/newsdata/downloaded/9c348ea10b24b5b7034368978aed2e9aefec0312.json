Her phone rang my phone and police were at Emily's house and she was fine and she said 'everything's okay'.\n\n\"She said her dog was not eating and suggested I come round but I didn't go to the address.\"\n\nHe said he then got a text message from Miss Henthorn asking whether his wife would \"share\" him with her.\n\nHe added: \"I did respond. I can't remember what I said but it was a ridiculous question to ask. I said I would ring her back I did ring her back but she didn't answer.\n\n\"On the Sunday I sent a number of messages asking how she was but got no response.\n\n\"The next contact I had when her dad phoned me up on the Saturday to say she had died.\"\n\n(Image: Emily Henthorn/Cavendish Press)\n\nMiss Henthorn's father, Darren, said: \"She was determined, single minded, strong willed and at times controlling but she was very independent.\n\n\"Emily had been suffering from mental health issues for about four to five years and her issues then brought her into conflict with other people and member of the family and those close to her.\n\n\"If things weren't going her way things would flare up.\n\n\"Emily was always a very private person and wouldn't readily talk about things because she felt ashamed about it and didn't want her family and other people around her knowing what she was going through.\n\n\"I was aware about Emily and Andrew Hardman but I didn't know the full details.\n\n\"I just knew that it had ended and I knew that [he] hadn't moved in with her.\"\n\nIn the days after the break up, Miss Henthorn phoned her sister threatening to take her own life and police and paramedics were called to her home.\n\nBut no action was taken after she insisted she was fine.\n\nMr Henthorn said: \"Emily was a very complicated person I don't know myself whether threats she made where for show, sympathy or to get attention or whether she did mean them.\n\n\"Seen as that is the way she ended her life perhaps they where real.\n\n\"She always said she had a plan where she wanted to be by the time she was 25 and she was 25 at the time she died.\n\n\"She never said what the plan was but I knew it wasn't the life she was living - she wanted better things for herself.\n\n\"At her funeral people who where there had no idea what Emily her family had gone through. She was very good at concealing her underlying problems.\"\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nAmy Corrigan, a former girlfriend of Miss Henthorn said: \"She was very old headed at 25 in that you should have your life sorted and own a house, married and stable career.\n\n\"For some reason she set that goal for 25.\n\n\"On May 1, Emily made contact at 11.32pm and I started texting and phoning her. She said 'I am ending my life tomorrow - if there's anything you want to say to me, say it now before it's to late'.\n\n\"That's why I rang the emergency services straight away. I tried to contact her also tried to contact her sister but couldn't get through. Emily said 'There's a lot gone on and I can't do it anymore'.\n\n\"She just said I wont be able to understand what had happened to her in the last few months and then she put the phone down. I tried to ring her back for days but got no response.\n\n\"It's when she said 'I don't want to be prevented - I want to be allowed to end my life' which is what scared me the most. She would never reach out for help.\"\n\nOn May 2, Emily had told a mental health services nursing practitioner about the end of the affair, and indicated she didn't want a referral to mental health services or a face-to-face assessment.\n\nRecording a conclusion of suicide, coroner Alan Walsh said: \"Emily was 25 and had a plan to achieve certain objectives which sadly in her mind hadn't achieved at the age of 25.\n\n\"She appears to be someone who had this split personality issues. To the outside world she was the centre of attention, attractive and very out going and when she was in that mind she was very attractive and appealing to all those who met her.\n\n\"All those who met her would not believe what sad issues those close to her experienced. Over the last few few days there had been a breakdown of a relationship and she was devastated by that breakdown.\n\n\"She was someone who was clearly devastated in the conversation she had with Amy and was quite clear she was intending to end her life.\n\n\"I do believe that social media and YouTube open up mechanisms of causing death to those that have been vulnerable.\n\n\"I am greatly saddened by the fact Emily was outgoing, attractive, vivacious personality. Saddest that she had that other side of her personality.\n\n\"Together with possible her unfulfilled objective to be achieved by the age of 25 and was not achieved.\n\n\"That came together sadly in that last two weeks of her life caused her to act in that way and tragically ended her life in that way.\n\n\"That finding would be unimaginable to all of us in the court.\"\n\nThe Samaritans is available 24/7 if you need to talk.
