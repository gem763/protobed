Photo: NBC/NBCU Photo Bank/NBCUniversal via Getty Images\n\nTen years ago, former Late Night With David Letterman writer Nell Scovell wrote an article for Vanity Fair titled \u201cLetterman and Me,\u201d in which she publicly called out her former boss for sexist behavior on his late-night show, including not hiring enough women writers and having inappropriate relationships with staffers on the show. Scovell\u2019s experiences at Late Night ultimately led to her quitting, but when her Vanity Fair piece was published in 2009, late-night television was an even more male-dominated field than it is now, and Scovell made it a point to fight for women in comedy \u2014 and, more broadly, in television \u2014 over the next decade, continuing to call out Letterman and others for years. Letterman, however, never read that initial Vanity Fair article \u2026 until recently, when he agreed to meet up with Scovell to talk about it.\n\nThe result is a fascinating new piece by Scovell, published today, ten years after the original Vanity Fair article. In it, she recaps why she wrote the first article, her pre-Late Night experiences with workplace sexual harassment, and the recent, long overdue conversation she had with Letterman to talk it all out. While Scovell doesn\u2019t exactly let Letterman off the hook for not giving women the same chances as men on his late-night shows (\u201cSelf-reflection can save a marriage, but it can\u2019t change history,\u201d she writes), she details the candid chat, in which Letterman reflects on her article and his regrets, offering her several apologies.\n\n\u201cYou know, the other night I read the piece that you wrote ten years ago,\u201d Letterman told Scovell. \u201cAnd I thought, Holy shit, this is so disturbing and, sadly, a perspective that I did not have \u2026 I\u2019m sorry I was that way and I was happy to have read the piece because it wasn\u2019t angering. I felt horrible because who wants to be the guy that makes people unhappy to work where they\u2019re working? I don\u2019t want to be that guy. I\u2019m not that guy now. I was that guy then.\u201d Scovell also reveals in the piece that, after telling Letterman about two talented female staffers who were denied promotions to the writing staff on his show, Letterman called them both the next day to apologize.\n\nScovell points out in the piece that conversations like the one she had with Letterman are crucial, for several reasons. \u201cWe need more dialogue so men can understand the difference between criticism and condemnation. And we need more dialogue so women can voice discomfort without fear of retaliation,\u201d she writes. \u201cDave\u2019s willingness to speak to me on the record is part of him making amends. His acknowledgment of mistakes and regret go out to those who were wronged. They also go out to the enablers and defenders of his behavior. That\u2019s equally important.\u201d\n\nRead Scovell\u2019s full piece here.", "description": "Former \u2018Late Night With David Letterman\u2019 writer Nell Scovell, who wrote a piece ten years ago calling the host out for sexism, has written a new piece about recently sitting down with Letterman for a conversation in which he apologized.", "authors": ["Megh Wright"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/vulture/2019/10/30/30-dave-letterman.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
