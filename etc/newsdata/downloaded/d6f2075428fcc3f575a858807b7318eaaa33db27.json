Others needed to stand out from the pack to advance in a frequently diminishing field, while a few of the hopefuls still struggled to get a word in.\n\nHere is our take on how they did:\n\nWinners\n\nAmy Klobuchar\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar came out punching.\n\nThe Minnesota Democrat wasn\u2019t afraid to criticize other candidates, in particular, Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Klobuchar, who has struggled to get a word in during past debates, went out of her way to differentiate her more moderate policies from the more progressive stances. Although she\u2019s done the same in past debates, she has never been this forceful.\n\nOne of Klobuchar\u2019s biggest moments was calling Warren out on how she will pay for a Medicare for All plan, adding that she believes Warren is handing Republicans a gift by offering up a plan they can attack as too expensive.\u200b\n\n\u201cI think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we\u2019re going to send the invoice,\" Klobuchar told to Warren. \"The difference between a plan and a pipe dream, is something that you can actually get done.\u201d\n\nThe tactic might pay off. Klobuchar has yet to make the November debate stage and this may be the push she needs.\n\nAmy Klobuchar on \"Medicare for All:\" \"I appreciate Elizabeth's work. But again, the difference between a plan and a pipe dream is something you can actually get done\" #DemDebatepic.twitter.com/m2yyF3jQbF \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 16, 2019\n\nPete Buttigieg\n\nSouth Bend, Ind. Mayor Pete Buttigieg was also ready to take some of his more progressive competitors to task on their policies.\n\nButtigieg used forceful rhetoric during the debate to showcase his more moderate proposals. Buttigieg, who over the past week has hit Warren on Medicare for All, did so again on Tuesday's debate stage. He criticized Warren for not fully answering whether she will raise taxes for voters for her Medicare for All plan, claiming it is an example of why people are \u201cso frustrated with Washington.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why you believe the only way to deliver affordable coverage for everyone is by obliterating private plans,\u201d Buttigieg said.\n\nButtigieg, a combat veteran, was also able to showcase his experience when talking about foreign policy.\n\n\u201cYou can put an end to endless war without embracing Donald Trump\u2019s policy,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cWhat we were doing in Syria was keeping our word.\u201d\n\nForeign policy\n\nTuesday was the first night that foreign policy was talked about substantively after being ignored in the last three debates.\n\nThe topic was brought up in response to Trump\u2019s announcement last week that he is going to withdraw troops from Syria, a move that has been criticized by Democrats and some Republicans alike. However, the president has defended the move by saying he wants to extract American soldiers from overseas commitment.\n\nBiden said that decision is the \u201cmost shameful thing any president has done in modern history in terms of foreign policy.\u201d Klobuchar also criticized Trump\u2019s decision, questioning how \"leaving the Kurds for slaughter, our allies for slaughter\" would make \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\nLosers\n\nBillionaires\n\nIn a discussion on the disparaging income gap in the United States, all the candidates agreed that the billionaires in this country are benefiting too much from the current tax system\u2014even if they disagreed on how to fix it.\n\nKlobuchar quipped: \u201dNobody on this stage wants to protect billionaires\u2014not even the billionaire wants to protect billionaires.\"\n\nBusinessman Tom Steyer, the only billionaire on the crowded stage, commented on the income gap that \"It's absolutely wrong and it's absolutely undemocratic and unfair.\"\n\nSanders and Warren defended their ideas of a wealth tax, with Sanders grinning largely when asked if he believes that \"billionaires shouldn't exist,\" a common one-liner for his campaign.\n\nElizabeth Warren on closing the income gap: \"My question is not why do Bernie and I support a wealth tax, it's why does everyone else on the stage think it is more important to protect billionaires than it is to invest in an entire generation of Americans?\" #DemDebatepic.twitter.com/XHQV586X4W \u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) October 16, 2019\n\nWarren claimed that she doesn't \"have a beef with billionaires,\" but continued to argue that because billionaires have \"made a fortune in America,\" they should be able help \"every other kid in America has a chance to make it.\"\n\nNo matter who wins the Democratic nomination, it became clear tonight the candidates are not satisfied with the wealth differentials.\n\nYes or no: Elizabeth Warren on paying for Medicare for All\n\nThe Massachusetts senator, who boasts that she has a plan for everything, wouldn\u2019t say if taxes will go up for the middle class to pay Medicare for All when asked to explicitly say so multiple times by debate moderators.\n\n\"My view on this and what I have committed to is costs will go down for hard-working middle-class families,\" Warren stated, not committing to saying the same for taxes specifically.\n\nShe was responding to a question if she would clearly say yes or no on the issue as Sanders did for the same plan. Sanders admitted, \"I do think it is appropriate to acknowledge that taxes will go up: They're gonna up significantly for the wealthy and for virtually everybody. The tax increase will be substantially less\u2014substantially less\u2014than what they were paying for premiums and out-of-pocket expenses.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar jabbed that \"At least Bernie's being honest here and saying how he's going to pay this. I think we owe it to the American people to tell them where we will send the invoice.\"\n\nWarren was attacked by other moderate candidates on the stage largely on this issue, but especially from Buttigieg, who has previously said that she is being \u201cevasive\u201d on the issue, claimed that this was why people are \u201cso frustrated with Washington.\u201d\n\nButtigieg said, \"We heard it tonight. A yes or no question that didn\u2019t get a yes or no answer.\u201d\n\nThe candidates who weren\u2019t on the stage tonight\n\nAs time goes on, the qualifications for upcoming debates will only get tougher for the crowded field of Democratic hopefuls.\n\nA clear loser for tonight were the seven candidates that didn\u2019t grace the stage tonight.\n\nThese include:\n\nSen. Michael Bennet of Colorado\n\nMontana Gov. Steve Bullock\n\nFormer Rep. John Delaney of Maryland\n\nMiramar, Fla. Mayor Wayne Messam\n\nOhio Rep. Tim Ryan\n\nFormer Rep. Joe Sestak of Pennsylvania\n\nAuthor and activist Marianne Williamson\n\nThe DNC recently released more difficult requirements candidates must meet to qualify for the November debates.\n\nWilliamson isn't on the debate stage tonight, but she still reminded voters of her presence, tweeting as the debate started, \"No, they\u2019re not the only Democratic candidates for President of the United States,\" and Delaney tweeted a picture of himself enjoying the night watching the Washington Nationals play their way into the World Series.\n\nTonight\u2019s debate was a crucial moment for every candidate to make waves as these requirements additionally set up the possibility that several additional candidates may miss the stage compared to tonight\u2019s match-up, potentially ending some campaigns.\n\nJust how critical was tonight? Of the 12 candidates that did appear, four of them, Beto O'Rourke, Klobuchar, Juli\u00e1n Castro and Tulsi Gabbard, still haven't qualified for next month's debate. It is unlikely that those who didn't appear tonight will be on November's stage.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/10/15/october-debate-here-winners-and-losers/3991719002/", "description": "Pete Buttigieg was ready to hit back, and those who didn't make the debate stage have an uphill battle.", "authors": ["Rebecca Morin", "Savannah Behrmann", "Published P.M.
