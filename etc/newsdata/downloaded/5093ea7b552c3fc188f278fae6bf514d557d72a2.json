Train service would also end at 8 p.m. (1200 GMT), more than four hours earlier than normal.\n\nMTR Corp was forced to shut down in an unprecedented move after arson attacks on Friday night and only partially operated during the weekend, with protesters again setting stations ablaze and destroying ticketing machines. The closures largely paralysed transportation around much of the Asian financial hub.\n\nThe Hong Kong government said in a statement early on Tuesday \"a large group of masked rioters repeatedly committed destructive acts extensively\", including \"dropping a bicycle from height\" that hit and injured a police officer. Roads were also blocked in various districts, it said.\n\nATMs, Chinese banks and scores of shops were vandalised during violent protests over the long weekend, some of which drew tens of thousands of people. Many restaurants and malls closed early over what is typically a very busy holiday period.\n\nThat followed the decision by authorities to impose a ban on face masks, which protesters use to protect their identity, on Friday under colonial-era emergency powers.\n\nResidents awoke on Tuesday to anti-police graffiti and streets littered with broken bricks and metal barricades from weekend clashes, during which police fired tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannon to subdue petrol bomb-throwing protesters.\n\nThe protests have plunged the former British colony into its worst political crisis in decades and are taking a growing toll on Hong Kong's economy, hitting its important tourism and retail sectors as it faces its first recession in a decade.\n\nWhat started as opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill has grown into a pro-democracy movement against what is seen as Beijing's increasing grip on the city, which protesters say undermines a \"one country, two systems\" formula promised when Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997.\n\nChina dismisses such accusations, saying foreign governments, including Britain and the United States, have fanned anti-China sentiment.\n\nThe ban on face masks inflamed protests and angered many Hong Kongers who fear a further erosion of their civil liberties.
