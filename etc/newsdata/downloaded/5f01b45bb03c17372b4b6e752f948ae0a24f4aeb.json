He is also one of the world\u2019s Sake specialists and author of the reference book 'Nihonshu: Japanese sake'.\n\nHe believes this rice wine popular in Japan contains a number of unique elements.\n\n\"What determines the characteristics of sake is its raw material - rice,\" he explains. \"In the right conditions, a fruit ferments naturally and gives us wine. But this is not the case with cereals which makes Japanese sake a creation of pure human genius.\"\n\nHumans experience flavours on five main criteria these include umami, sweet, salty, bitter and acidic. Umami is the element that makes a dish flavoursome - it is the tomato sauce that\u2019s cooked for a long time. As sake is naturally rich in umami and sweet it is naturally perceived as pleasant.\n\nDoes sake complement some food in particular?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, especially with dishes that are difficult to pair with other drinks, such as asparagus, eggs or seafood,\" says Mr Roussille. \"It's been proven that iron is the main element which, when combined with seafood, creates an unpleasant ocean-like aroma. But sake is very low in iron, so it fits perfectly with all types of seafood.\u201d\n\nSylvain Huet is a sake expert who lives in Champagne, another of France's famous wine region. He is the organiser of The European Sake Show - the biggest-ever event dedicated to sake outside Japan.\n\nSo are chefs and cooks in Europe becoming more and more interested in sake?\"\n\n\"It's important to know that sake naturally complements Japanese gastronomy from where it originated,\" he explains. \"But all Western cuisine can feel the benefit, whether it\u2019s French or Italian. From ' bistronomic' cuisine to the cuisine of three-star restaurants, sake not only complements wine, but can allow a real re-reading of certain dishes whether they are classic or new.\"\n\nL'Assiette Champenoise's Chef Arnaud Lallement, who has three Michelin stars, is one of a new breed of chef who likes to combine seafood and sake.\n\nHe often suggests a glass of sake to go with some of his dishes which include elements like Brown Crab from Brittany. He was particularly excited to find there is even a 'sparkling' example of sake.\n\nHe explains how this Japanese wine can enhance a simple seafood dish.\n\n\" Here, it\u2019s the turnip that makes the link between the sake and the brown crab with fish soup,\" he says. \"It\u2019s the tangy turnip with the spicy crabmeat, it\u2019s as if you are placing your tongue on a nettle. Here the tangy turnip makes the link with sake that is vegetable-based too.\u201d\n\nDon't just listen to the chefs. Why not try it yourself?\n\nKampai", "description": "Sake, a complex drink from Japan is gaining popularity among cooks and wine enthusiasts in Europe especially as an accompaniment to seafood dishes", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.euronews.com/articles/stories/04/04/20/08/1000x563_cmsv2_27062aad-8c0b-5b17-b51b-ac86efc834de-4042008.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
