All of us have a vision for the future of the country that we\u2019re articulating to the American people. We\u2019re going to continue to do that. We have an election coming up.

You see. The Democrats didn\u2019t go after me on impeachment. And you know why? Because I didn\u2019t do anything wrong. These folks that always investigate me\u2014they\u2019re always trying to go after me.
