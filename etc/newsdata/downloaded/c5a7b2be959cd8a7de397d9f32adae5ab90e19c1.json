It\u2019s about who prepared best\u2019\n\nThe last time Callum Hawkins tried to win a marathon gold medal he went viral \u2013 with the images of him collapsing with heatstroke and dehydration at last year\u2019s Commonwealth Games in Australia spreading around the world.\n\nBut as the 27-year-old Scot prepares to run 26.2 miles in the 32C heat and 50% humidity of Doha he has revealed a secret weapon: using a stack of heaters while on a treadmill in his shed to replicate the desert conditions at the world championships.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing a bit of work in a heat chamber to prepare as well as getting the Aldi heaters,\u201d he says. \u201cI got it up to 39 degrees at one point. It\u2019s a big proper shed and not a wee tiny one.\u201d\n\nHawkins, who finished fourth at the 2017 world championships in London, insists he is not worried about a repeat of the Gold Coast \u2013 despite nearly half the field in the women\u2019s marathon being forced to pull out due to the extreme conditions.\n\nWhen asked what were the odds of him buying a one-way ticket back home after seeing that race, he laughed. \u201cNever even thought of it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve prepared well or at least I think I\u2019ve prepared well. I learned a lot from watching it and I\u2019ve got eight years of learning. It\u2019s mainly about being patient \u2013 make sure I\u2019m close enough but not doing too much or overheating.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve run well in the heat in the past \u2013 I ran decent in Rio and London in 2017 was not roasting but it was getting up there, into the 20s in the sun. Everyone is in the same boat. It\u2019s about who prepares best and making sure your race plan matches the conditions.\u201d\n\nMost of the world\u2019s top marathon runners will not be here \u2013 Eliud Kipchoge, the Olympic champion, is preparing to go under two hours in Vienna while Mo Farah will run at the Chicago marathon on Sunday week. However, Hawkins insists he is still facing a strong field.\n\nDina Asher-Smith\u2019s short sprint from an ice-cream bribe to a gold medal | Tumaini Carayol Read more\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s got two Ethiopians who were second and third in London, the former world champion and the Kenyan team is always strong,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we saw at the women\u2019s that times don\u2019t really matter, what you\u2019ve done in the past doesn\u2019t really matter. The women were 15 minutes off their best; it\u2019s about who can get closest to their actual best. With the conditions it\u2019s anyone\u2019s race.\u201d\n\nLaura Muir says she is hopeful of adding a third British gold medal in Saturday\u2019s 1500m final following the victories for Dina Asher-Smith in the 200m and Katarina Johnson-Thompson in the heptathlon.\n\n\u201cIt would be great to get three from three,\u201d said Muir, who showed no signs of the torn calf muscle that kept her out for six weeks in the summer. \u201cThat is not to discount any other athletes. I know Dina, KJT and myself have been figureheads for this team and I would love to get that medal.\n\n\u201cThis is the one piece of the puzzle I\u2019m missing. I\u2019ve got world indoors, Europeans indoors and out. To get a global outdoor medal would be fantastic.\u201d\n\nElsewhere Dina Asher-Smith could become the first Briton to ever win three world medals at the same championships after the women\u2019s 4x100m team of Asha Philip, Imani-Lara Lansoquot, Ashleigh Nelson and Daryll Neita qualified for Saturday\u2019s final in second place.\n\nBritain\u2019s men\u2019s 4x100m relay team of Adam Gemili, Zharnel Hughes, Richard Kilty and Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake also look well placed to retain the world title from 2017 after running fastest time of the heats, 37.56 sec, even with Mitchell-Blake easing up.\n\nOn the best night of the Championships so far, a packed crowd were also fortunate enough to see two races for the ages. First the American 400m hurdler Dalilah Muhammad broke her own world record, running 52.16 sec to hold off the new star of the sport, Sydney McLaughlin, who finished just 0.07 sec back.\n\nAnd then, just a few minutes later there was an even closer race as world 3,000m steeplechase champion Conseslus Kipruto, who has had injury problems this year, retained his title by 0.01 sec on the dip after a stunning comeback to pip the Ethiopian Lamecha Girma in a desperate last 100m sprint.\n\nHowever the biggest cheer of the night came in the men\u2019s high jump as the local favourite Mutaz Barshim cleared 2.37m to take gold for Qatar.", "description": "Callum Hawkins used Aldi heaters while on a treadmill in his shed to replicate the heat and humidity of the world championship marathon in Doha", "authors": ["Sean Ingle"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70deffcda291fa62d9265d2f0c02a6a0bef157a2/0_165_5298_3179/master/5298.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d28746ba726c14e33132f548369ada78", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
