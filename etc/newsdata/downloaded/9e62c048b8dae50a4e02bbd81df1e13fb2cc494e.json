In the 20th century, it was Americanized. Now, it is being Asianized, and much faster than you may think.\n\nAsia\u2019s rise has been swift. Home to more than half of the world\u2019s population, the region has climbed from low- to middle-income status within a single generation. By 2040, it is likely to generate more than 50% of world gross domestic product (GDP), and could account for nearly 40% of global consumption.\n\nAround 60% of Asian countries\u2019 total trade in goods occurs within the region, facilitated by increasingly integrated Asian supply chains.\n\nNew McKinsey Global Institute research shows the extent to which the global center of gravity is shifting toward Asia. Today, the region has an increasing global share of trade, capital, people, knowledge, transport, culture and resources. Of eight types of global cross-border flows, only waste is flowing in the opposite direction, reflecting the decision by China and other Asian countries to reduce imports of garbage from developed countries.\n\nAsia now accounts for around one-third of global trade in goods, up from about a quarter 10 years ago. Over roughly the same period, its share of global airline travelers has risen from 33% to 40%, and its share of capital flows has increased from 13% to 23%.\n\nThose flows have fueled growth in Asia\u2019s cities. The region is home to 21 of the world\u2019s 30 largest, and four of the 10 most visited. And some of Asia\u2019s lesser-known cities are now also on investors\u2019 radar. In Yangon, Myanmar\u2019s commercial capital, greenfield foreign direct investment (FDI) in knowledge-intensive sectors totaled $2.6 billion in 2017, up from virtually zero in 2007.\n\nSimilarly, Bekasi, a smaller city near Jakarta, has emerged as the Detroit of Indonesia \u2014 the center of Indonesia\u2019s automotive and motorcycle industry. Over the last decade, FDI in the city\u2019s manufacturing industry has grown at an average rate of 29% per year. And Hyderabad, which generated over 1,400 patents in 2017, is quickly catching up with India\u2019s Silicon Valley, Bangalore.\n\nBut it\u2019s not only external flows being channeled into Asia. Dynamic intraregional networks are also driving progress. Around 60% of Asian countries\u2019 total trade in goods occurs within the region, facilitated by increasingly integrated Asian supply chains. Intraregional funding and investment flows are also increasing, with more than 70% of Asian startup funding coming from within the region. Flows of people \u2014 74% of travel within Asia is undertaken by Asians \u2014 help to integrate the region as well.\n\nThe four \u2018Asias\u2019\n\nWhat makes these flows work is Asia\u2019s diversity. In fact, there are at least four \u201cAsias,\u201d each at a different stage of economic development, playing a unique role in the region\u2019s global rise.\n\nThe first Asia comprises China, the region\u2019s anchor economy, which provides a connectivity and innovation platform to its neighbors. In 2013-2017, the country accounted for 35% of Asia\u2019s total outward FDI, with about one-quarter of that investment going to other Asian economies. Reflecting its rapidly growing innovation capacity, China accounted for 44% of the world\u2019s patent applications in 2017.\n\nThe second grouping \u2014 \u201cAdvanced Asia\u201d \u2014 also provides technology and capital. With total outward FDI of $1 trillion, these countries accounted for 54% of total regional FDI outflows in 2013-2017. South Korea alone provided 33% of all FDI flows to Vietnam. Japan accounted for 35% of Myanmar\u2019s FDI inflows, and 17% of the Philippines\u2019.\n\nThen there is \u201cEmerging Asia,\u201d which comprises a relatively diverse group of small emerging economies that provide not only labor, but also growth potential, owing to rising productivity and consumption. These economies are deeply integrated with their regional neighbors: Their average share of intraregional flows of goods, capital, and people is 79%, the highest of the four Asias.\n\nBy contrast, the fourth grouping \u2014 \u201cFrontier Asia and India\u201d \u2014 has the lowest average share of intraregional flows, amounting to only 31%. But this figure \u2014 which reflects historic ties to Europe, the Middle East and Africa and the United States \u2014 is set to increase, as these economies, which historically were less integrated, forge closer bonds with their Asian neighbors. This group has a lot to offer, including a relatively young labor force that is capitalizing on the growing Asian import market, and a growing middle class that can serve as a new market for regional exports.\n\nIntegrated Asia\n\nThe differences among the four Asias are complementary, making integration a powerful force for progress. For example, as one country\u2019s labor force ages, a country with a younger population fills the gap. The median age of India\u2019s population stood at 27 in 2015, compared to 37 in China and 48 in Japan and is expected to reach just 38 by 2050.\n\nLikewise, when wages \u2014 and thus manufacturing costs \u2014 begin to rise in one country, an economy at an earlier stage of development takes over its low-cost manufacturing activities. From 2014 to 2017, when China\u2019s share of all labor-intensive emerging-economy exports declined from 55% to 52%, Vietnam\u2019s share increased by 2.2 percentage points and Cambodia\u2019s by 0.4 percentage point.\n\nFor years, observers have breathlessly discussed Asia\u2019s future potential. The future has arrived. We have entered the \u201cAsian century,\u201d as the author Parag Khanna puts it. There is no turning back.\n\nJonathan Woetzel is a McKinsey senior partner, a director of the McKinsey Global Institute, and co-author of \u201cNo Ordinary Disruption: The Four Global Forces Breaking All the Trends.\u201d Jeongmin Seong is a senior fellow at the McKinsey Global Institute in Shanghai.\n\nThis article was published with the permission of Project Syndicate.", "description": "The region is likely to generate more than half of the world\u2019s gross domestic product within 20 years.", "authors": ["Jonathan Woetzel", "Jeongmin Seong"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT614_asia_c_MG_20191018101727.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
