It is alien to American due process.\u201d\n\nMr. Graham, added: \u201cAll I\u2019m asking is give Donald Trump the same rights as Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton had when it comes to impeachment.\u201d\n\nThe efforts to attack the impeachment process in the House and Senate are an attempt to undermine public support for the inquiry as a stream of witnesses from inside Mr. Trump\u2019s own government have delivered day after day of damning testimony about the president\u2019s campaign to pressure Ukraine for his own political gain.\n\nOn Thursday, there was a pause in the back-to-back depositions as the House honored Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, who died last week. But behind-the-scenes work continued to push the inquiry forward. Impeachment investigators have negotiated in recent days with a lawyer for the former National Security Adviser, John R. Bolton, about a date for him to be deposed behind closed doors, according to two people briefed on the matter. The lawyer, Charles J. Cooper, declined to comment.\n\nThe revelations from the investigation so far have been increasingly difficult for some Republicans to defend, but opposition to the way the inquiry has been conducted has more or less unified the party.", "description": "President Trump wants his party to defend him more aggressively.
