The Justice Department and the FBI obtained warrants in 2016 to surveil Trump adviser Carter Page. It is unclear, at this point, if Page was the only Trump official that the DOJ obtained a FISA warrant against.\n\nDOJ WATCHDOG SUBMITS DRAFT FISA REPORT TO BARR\n\nThat highly anticipated report will likely spark new congressional investigations and deliver critical information to other federal reviews probing allegations of abuse by the Justice Department and the FBI.\n\nHorowitz has been probing how the infamous and salacious anti-Trump dossier compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele was used to secure the original FISA warrant for Page in October 2016, as well as three renewals.\n\nHorowitz also has looked into why the FBI may have regarded Steele \u2013 funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign through law firm Perkins Coie \u2013 a credible source, and why the bureau used news reports to bolster Steele\u2019s credibility before the FISA court.\n\nAccording to Hannity, the report, which dominated headlines for almost two years, will have \"shocking revelations,\" as the country waits in anticipation.\n\n\"I don't know why it's not released yet because we already know what happened,\" he said on his show.\n\n\"We know the bulk of information was that Hillary Clinton bought and paid for dirty Russian dossier ... so they could help her win the election in 2016,\" Hannity added.\n\n\"And by the way,\" he continued, \"what do we learn from that? That it was never verified and never verifiable.\"\n\n\"We will find out, we need to get to the truth,\" the host concluded.\n\nFor Hannity's full remarks at Politicon, as well as all the highlights from the event, visit Fox Nation and sign up today.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR A FOX NATION FREE TRIAL\n\nFox Nation programs are viewable on-demand and from your mobile device app, but available only for Fox Nation subscribers.
