He could face prosecution for trespass.\n\nA spokesperson for the youth prison in Vechta in Lower Saxony said the spurned young man was desperate to persuade his ex to change her mind. He managed to reach her first-floor window.\n\nHe took advantage of a street lamp to get over the wall - so now the authorities have wrapped the lamppost in barbed wire, German broadcaster NDR says.\n\nIt is not clear why the young man did not book a prison visit instead of going on his climbing adventure last week.\n\nNo more details were given about him or the young offender he was trying to see and it is unknown if his bid to save the relationship was a success.\n\nRomeo, Shakespeare's passionate romantic hero, scales a garden wall in Romeo and Juliet. Climbing up to her balcony is not however in the stage directions.\n\nYou may also like:", "description": "The eighteen-year-old would not take his jailed ex's no for an answer - and broke into the prison.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/branded_news/0434/production/_109367010_mediaitem109367008.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
