If you lose someone, grief doesn't care about what the situation was.\"\n\nBrown-Long, now 31, was released from prison in August after former Tennesse Governor Bill Haslam commuted her sentence for murdering 43-year-old Johnny Allen, who allegedly hired her for sex when she was 16. Her lawyers argued that she fatally shot Allen in self-defense.\n\nBrown-Long was tried as an adult and convicted of first-degree murder and aggravated robbery in 2006 without the possibility for parole until 2055.
