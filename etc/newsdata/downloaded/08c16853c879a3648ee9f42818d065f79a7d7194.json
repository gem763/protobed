It is still occupied Palestine. For Saudi Arabia, there is no state called Israel,\u201d football fan Saad told AFP, his eyes locked on a screen playing a Saudi match in a cafe along Tahlia street, a restaurant-lined thoroughfare.\n\n\u201cIt is a good thing to support sport in Palestine given the situation there,\u201d said the 27-year-old. \u201cThe Palestinian cause remains a fundamental one for Saudi Arabia.\u201d\n\nAfter defeating Singapore 3-0 last week, the Saudi national team will face Palestine on their home turf in the West Bank in the Asian qualifiers for the 2022 World Cup.\n\nThe game marks a change in policy for the kingdom, which has previously played matches against Palestine in third countries in line with a decades-long Arab boycott of the Jewish state.\n\nHowever, in recent years, common concerns over Iran are widely seen as having brought Gulf powerhouse Saudi Arabia and Israel \u2014 both staunch US allies \u2014 closer together.\n\n\u2013 No politics please \u2013\n\nAccording to the Saudi Sports Authority, the decision to play in the West Bank was \u201cat the request of the brothers in the Palestinian federation\u201d and to ensure the team is \u201cnot deprived the chance to play at home and among its fans\u201d.\n\nFor another of the Saudi football fans watching the match against Singapore, the historic match-up has nothing to do with politics.\n\n\u201cFor the Saudis and the Palestinians, the goal of the match is to qualify for the World Cup,\u201d said 30-year-old Hazzaa, who sported a trimmed beard and a traditional red and white keffiyeh headdress.\n\nAbu Abdallah, a Saudi businessman, said he believed it was an honour for his country\u2019s team to play the Palestinians amongst their people.\n\n\u201cThis is something rare to happen, and the kingdom would not take any step unless it was in the interest of the Palestinian people or Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2013 \u2018Balancing act\u2019 \u2013\n\nPalestinian football association chief Jibril Rajoub said on Thursday that the game, to be played at the Al-Ram Stadium which is recognised by FIFA, would not breach the boycott.\n\nStill, the Palestinian-led boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) movement said that while the match is not technically a breach, it came \u201cin the context of dangerous official normalisation\u201d.\n\nThe Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine also said it \u201crejected normalisation through sport\u201d.\n\nOfer Zalzberg, senior analyst with the International Crisis Group, said Saudi Arabia was attempting a \u201cbalancing act\u201d of quietly moving closer to Israel while also seeking to keep the Palestinians satisfied.\n\n\u201cThe Saudis are yielding to Ramallah\u2019s request of playing in the West Bank in order to offset a sense that they are normalising with Israel while ignoring Palestinian needs,\u201d he told AFP, adding that official recognition of the Jewish state was unlikely.\n\nMajed, dressed in traditional white thobe robes and an NBA cap at the cafe screening the match, said he absolutely rejected normalisation of ties with Israel.\n\n\u201cThe occupied Palestinian territories must be returned to its people,\u201d he told AFP.\n\n\u201cI do hope that sports will bring peace to the region,\u201d he added, right before jumping up to celebrate Saudi Arabia\u2019s first goal.", "description": "Riyadh (AFP) \u2013 Saudi football fans are delighted about their national team\u2019s historic match Tuesday against their Palestinian", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/13/08eab0_palestinian-women-saudi-arabia-national-football-team-flowers-saudi-fans-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
