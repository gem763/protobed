Her father told KTXH his daughter locked herself in a bathroom in their home early that morning, and that by the time he reached her, it was too late.\n\n\"She died in my arms,\" he said.\n\nRivera took to Facebook on Wednesday morning to spread awareness about Letty's story and raise funds to cover the cost of the girl's funeral.\n\n\"Letty was abducted in 2017 through a man who drugged her and trafficked her,\" she wrote. \"With the help of the community I was able to get her back... the damage was already done and the road to recovery is one of the hardest things for any child to overcome without the right help.\"\n\nRivera also claimed that the man responsible was arrested in wake of the kidnapping and that he only spent three days in jail before his release. She added that the man was allegedly seen with another 13-year-old child just days after the incident.\n\nHouston Police Department Vice Division commander Jim Dale told KTXH he requested that Letty's case be reopened in wake of her death.\n\n\"She was a victim and somehow her cries fell through the cracks,\" he said, adding he hoped to get more schools involved in the mass effort to stop the state's child sex trafficking epidemic.\n\nThe National Human Trafficking Hotline received 10,949 reports of suspected human trafficking in 2018 alone. Among U.S. states, most were from California, with 1,656 reported cases, followed by Texas, with 1,000. Florida and New York had 767 and 492 reported cases, respectively.\n\nSex trafficking was the No. 1 reported type of human trafficking, with 7,859 alleged cases. Labor trafficking, the second most reported, trailed behind at 1,249 reported cases. Women were by far the most impacted, with 7,126 female victims compared to 1,137 male victims reported.\n\nStill, many cases of human trafficking go unreported. The Global Slavery Index 2018 estimates that on any given day in 2016 there were 403,000 people living in conditions of modern slavery in the United States, a prevalence of 1.3 victims of modern slavery for every thousand in the country.", "description": "A 15-year-old Texas girl\u00a0died by suicide on Saturday, two years after she was rescued from sex trafficking, her family says.", "authors": ["Alex Lasker"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jLQmvOZdojNCabxM9PEviw--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/390x255+257+210/resize/1028x675!/format/jpg/quality/85/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/f1a5c580-f10e-11e9-bf1f-9fbb5454bc00", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
