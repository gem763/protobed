(SQ) : \"They lost a very good CFO, and even though it's a good company, it has not traded well since she left,\" noted Jim Cramer.\n\nIn this daily bar chart of SQ, below, we can see that prices have been weak the past two months and the May lows were broken several times in September. Prices have edged slightly higher in recent sessions but they are still below the declining 50-day moving average line and the mostly flat 200-day moving average line.\n\nThe On-Balance-Volume (OBV) has only improved slightly the past two weeks so we cannot say with enthusiasm that buyers have come back in a real aggressive way.\n\nThe trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator is still below the zero line in bearish territory.\n\nIn this weekly bar chart of SQ, below, we can see that prices are below the flattish 40-week moving average line.\n\nThe weekly OBV line has been in a decline from March and the best we might say is it has stopped going down.\n\nThe MACD oscillator is below the zero line but it has been narrowing.\n\nA possible buy signal is weeks away.\n\nIn this Point and Figure chart of SQ, below, we can see a potential upside price target in the $78 area but we can see that a decline to $58.65 could weaken the chart.\n\nBottom line strategy: The charts of SQ show some promise for gains but I think more sideways consolidation is needed before I feel more comfortable with a long recommendation.
