[Photo/Xinhua]\n\nURUMQI -- Billions have been invested to upgrade power networks in the rural areas of Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, in a bid to assist local anti-poverty work.\n\nA total of 2.6 billion yuan ($370 million) from the central government has been spent this year, while the regional government and the local grid power companies have also increased investment to improve power facilities, the regional development and reform commission said.\n\nThanks to an uninterrupted power supply, an embroidery cooperative in Akqi County in southern Xinjiang is able to get rid of inefficient handwork and bring in more income for rural females.\n\nUpgrading of old and outdated power infrastructures in eastern Xinjiang's Hami, a city famous for its honey-dew melons, has enabled local melon farmers to irrigate land even under severe weather conditions when blackouts used to be prevalent.\n\nBesides, the regional government has also invested nearly 3.4 billion yuan so far this year to channel fresh tap water to over 266,000 poor residents. Nearly 2,500 km of rural roads have been built to make trips more convenient for local residents.", "description": "Billions have been invested to upgrade power networks in the rural areas of Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, in a bid to assist local anti-poverty work.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/201910/21/5dad5894a310cf3e97a23b97.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
