It just showed there was more going on there. And even though there\u2019s always been the trope of a dad telling his kid to stand up for himself or herself, go ahead and throw a punch so they leave you alone, it doesn\u2019t generally seem to be the way of the schoolyard anymore.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nRecently, President Trump said the Kurds and the Turks should go at it. \u201cLike two kids in a lot, you\u2019ve got to let them fight and then you pull them apart,\u201d Trump said.\n\nIn reality, experts in child development know that isn\u2019t the best way to resolve conflict among kids. To be sure, those we spoke with aren\u2019t commenting on Trump\u2019s foreign policy. But they have some pretty clear ideas about how best to help kids who have a conflict to resolve, and why working through an issue is better than letting them fight it out at the playground.\n\nFirst off, Laurie Kramer, a professor of applied psychology at Northeastern University who studies sibling conflict, says parents need to be aware of how they themselves are handling their children\u2019s interactions.\n\nAD\n\nWhen asked what they thought were the best methods to manage their children\u2019s conflicts, parents who participated in Kramer\u2019s research of kids 3 to 9 years old said it was best when they can have a conversation with both children in the conflict and find a solution where both kids\u2019 needs are met, Kramer explained. Parents said other techniques, such as separating the kids, simply telling them not to fight and threatening them with punishment, were \u201cnot as effective\u201d as working with them to solve their issues, she said. Finally, parents thought \u201cthe least effective is just letting the kids fight and not intervening.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nInterestingly, when those same families agreed to let their children wear wires and record their days, parents mostly didn\u2019t intervene when their young children fought. Guess what happened? \u201cWhen parents don\u2019t intervene, a lot of times, the fighting will continue,\" Kramer said. \u201cYoung people, in particular, often don\u2019t have the skills they need to manage conflict.\u201d\n\nAnd that may be, in part, because parents don\u2019t know how to help them, she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t feel like they have the skills themselves to help kids really talk through what\u2019s going on.\u201d She and her researchers drew up ways to talk to kids about conflict resolution, now highlighted at funwithbrothersandsisters.org. \u201cIt is tough. Adults have a lot of problems dealing with conflicts, too.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nMegan Vroman is the principal at the new Ida B. Wells Middle School in the District. And of course, conflict happens every day, Vroman said, from the mundane to the more serious. The school tries to \u201cnormalize that conflict is ... part of life and something we all experience. It\u2019s also something we need to learn how to resolve,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have disagreements where we\u2019ve made mistakes, made a wrong choice. But how do we resolve it in a way that is restorative and we can move on from it?\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBefore the school opened this year, Vroman worked with Linda Ryden, the creator of the Peace of Mind curriculum for elementary schools, to come up with a middle school curriculum that would help teachers guide students in mindfulness and social emotional learning that can help them with conflict resolution. (Disclosure: My children were recipients of Ryden\u2019s teaching and curriculum in their D.C. public elementary school.)\n\nBy the time kids hit middle school, she said, many of them haven\u2019t had much instruction in how to work through an issue with a peer. And it\u2019s tricky: They\u2019re at a time of big transitions, hormones and still developing frontal lobes, which makes it difficult to make good choices in the heat of the moment.\n\nAD\n\nMany times, Vroman said, kids \"think they can just ignore [an issue with a peer] and move on.\u201d Her goal at Wells is to help them learn to face the issues creating the conflict and find ways to resolve their problems, without punches being thrown. \u201cDistance can be good, but there needs to be a way to resolve it,\u201d she said.\n\nAD\n\nSo she and her staff focus on helping students learn how they can deescalate a situation themselves. \u201cWe always tell kids that there will be another time when someone upsets you or hurts your feelings,\u201d she said. So they prepare and discuss ways they can ease tensions. \"It helps with self regulation as well as [helping them] step back to a mindful state.\u201d\n\nWhat happens at her middle school when a physical alteration does occur? It\u2019s a similar process to any conflict, she says. The students sit down separately and debrief with an adult. They talk about why they responded in such a physical way, how they could have responded differently and how their actions impacted others. \u201cThen we bring them back together to have a productive conversation,\u201d Vroman said.\n\nAD\n\nThe school also has a Social Emotional Learning (SEL) coach instead of a dean of students. This person instructs teachers in classroom management and how to resolve conflicts.\n\nAD\n\nOf course, she said, there are times when kids are taught to protect themselves by solving an issue \u201cin a way that is more physical.\u201d As a middle school principal, she feels it\u2019s her duty to teach children to respect that there may be a difference between rules at home and at school. \u201cThere are different rules in different environments,\" she said. \u201cWe hope this is the norm that you take elsewhere as you go into the world.\u201d\n\nFollow On Parenting on Facebook for more essays, news and updates, and join our discussion group here to talk about parenting and work.
