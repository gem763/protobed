I dress like this because it\u2019s hot as fuck and I work out really hard. Pow. I\u2019m strong and powerful and I\u2019d fuck you up. But what I\u2019m saying is, a lot of women get really intimidated by catcalling. You got me? So that\u2019s what\u2019s up. What\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\n\nShe fist-bumps him. \u201cJason, I\u2019m Kortney. It\u2019s nice to meet you. Take care.\u201d\n\nJason likely didn\u2019t know he\u2019d chosen Kortney Olson to hiss at. She\u2019s the bodybuilder who smashes watermelons between her thighs and is an Australian women\u2019s armwrestling champion. Her Instagram page is full of powerlifting feats \u2013 and the occasional candid video like her meeting with Jason.\n\nOlson benchpresses men like Jason.\n\nFit in my 40s: can I become a strongwoman? Read more\n\nGo into any gym these days and you\u2019ll notice a migration of women from treadmills and cardio classes to the weights section. Back gains and abs are the new aesthetic, thanks in part to the rise of CrossFit, Bodypump and F45, and gym noticeboards are more concerned with strength competitions \u2013 heaviest leg press, squat etc \u2013 than scale measurements. Mega-ripped fitness models such as Gracyanne Barbosa have millions following their workouts on Instagram, and the US-founded STRONG Fitness Magazine launches in Australia this month, aimed at women.\n\n\u201cI love muscle. That\u2019s just my thing,\u201d says Olson, whose website delivers training programs that promise to add an inch to arms and legs: \u201cNot so much on dudes \u2013 it\u2019s not a prerequisite \u2013 but on women it\u2019s outstanding.\u201d\n\nOlson was fascinated by the idea of having a six-pack from an early age, partly from idolising her older brother and partly, she says, because she was molested as a seven-year-old.\n\n\u201cFrom that point on, I created this image of myself being ripped in order to feel protected and worthy and safe,\u201d she says. \u201cI have found that most of the women that get into bodybuilding or strength training or powerlifting have had some kind of trauma.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s also that cultural swing. Kettlebell athlete Eilish Kidd competes on an international level, performing competition lifts such as the snatch, jerk and the long cycle over as many reps as possible in 10 minutes. She\u2019s noticed that while bigger glutes are still a priority for many women, so too is all-over muscle as an aesthetic.\n\nWhen Kidd first started working out in her 20s, she was too ashamed to let her boozy art school mates know about this extracurricular activity and would sneak off to train with a female bodybuilder she\u2019d met. The boutique Hobart gym, Artgym, that she went on to open has a 1980s Memphis look and aims to attract those who are put off by corporate environments.\n\nKidd was drawn to kettlebell as it\u2019s the ideal sport for introverts. She started late, in her mid-30s, but age wasn\u2019t as significant a number to her as the reps or kilos. Her weekly regime now involves two kettlebell training sessions, a mobility session, a light Olympic weightlifting session, a strength-conditioning session, and some cardio.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kettlebell athlete and gym owner Eilish Kidd.\n\n\u201cKettlebell is really technical, so you build up all of these elements and then when they all come together you feel powerful,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a feeling of happiness, even when it\u2019s painful.\u201d\n\nKellyanne Salter\u2019s idea of happiness comes from finishing off opponents with a cannonball or a missile dropkick. The Melbourne pro-wrestler says she\u2019s never wanted to be skinny. \u201cObviously I have to look aesthetically pleasing so I watch what I eat,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I\u2019m always trying to increase my strength.\u201d\n\nFrom the age of eight, Salter idolised the pro-wrestler Lita. In an era when female wrestlers tended to be cheerleader types, Lita was strong, tattooed and had the technical skills.\n\n\n\n\u201cAll I wanted to do was wrestle and I didn\u2019t care about how I looked, but all the female wrestlers on TV were eye candy,\u201d says Salter, who lied about her age when asking to join a local promotion and started training at 14. \u201cThat led me to believe at that age that I had to get a boob job.\u201d\n\n\n\nSalter fobbed off that idea but she reckons having her distinctive look has held her back from a career with WWE, for whom she had a tryout in 2016. \u201cThey want blank canvases so they\u2019re not able to mould me,\u201d she says. Instead she saves her money and spends stints wrestling in Mexico, Europe and the US. She frequently takes part in intergender matches and can\u2019t understand resistance to the idea of women fighting men.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Australian pro-wrestler Kellyanne Salter competing.\n\n\u201cI was usually the only girl at training, so it was normal for me to wrestle men,\u201d she says.\n\nNow Salter trains in the gym four days a week, isolating body parts \u2013 back, legs, arms. Another day she\u2019ll train in the ring and she\u2019ll usually wrestle for real on a Saturday night. She\u2019s the current impact pro-wrestling New Zealand women\u2019s champion, and on October 11-12 she\u2019ll compete in a Melbourne city wrestling invitational tournament that will result in the promotion\u2019s first women\u2019s champion being crowned.\n\nSome men are threatened by strong women, as one marine found out when she tweeted a video of herself doing squats with a man in a firefighter\u2019s lift across her shoulders.\n\nDani (@dani_g_3) When I was 12, I remember my friends stepdad (who was a firefighter) comment on how he felt women didn\u2019t belong in the fire department because \u201cno girl could ever lift a grown man\u201d lol anyways, fuck you Craig. pic.twitter.com/C4dU0MOtW5\n\nThe video got 10.2m views and plenty of butt-hurt comments. But for others, female strength is a fetish.\n\nSalter gets lots of DMs from men offering her big bucks to crush them with her thighs, or for her used gear. Heads up: it\u2019s not going to happen. \u201cI\u2019ve actually seen some of my wrestling matches uploaded on to Pornhub, with people time-stamping when my legs are open,\u201d she says. \u201cI choose not to get offended by it.\u201d\n\n\n\nOlson knows all about that. A few years back she made headlines when Australian tabloids uncovered her \u201cporn\u201d past, which was actually clothed videos of her crushing men, or of them worshipping her calves. \u201cI don\u2019t like to hurt people,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I can. It\u2019s more about them experiencing true female strength, and that\u2019s breaking the societal norm.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe tabloid interest arose because Olson is married to David May, who was chief executive of the Gold Coast Titans at the time. She also volunteered as the Titans\u2019 under-20s strength and conditioning coach. As far away as England there were headlines such as \u201cEx-porn star helps with \u2018cor\u2019 strength\u201d.\n\n\n\nIt got her down for a while, particularly because she had applied to be a mentor for young women and didn\u2019t get that gig as a result of the media attention. Instead she wrote a program for marginalised teenagers, Kamp Konfidence, and ran it in the Gold Coast hinterland. When that became too unwieldy, she set up activewear brand GRRRL Clothing and runs it with a team of five from her new base of Las Vegas.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bodybuilder and arm wrestling champion Kortney Olson lifting weights.\n\nTaking a gamble, she dumped traditional sizing in favour of GRRRL sizing \u2013 customers pick one of eight athletes who have vastly different body shapes by comparing their own measurements. Once you work out who you\u2019re closest in shape to, say, world record-holding powerlifter Amenah Razeghi, or UFC women\u2019s strawweight champion Zhang Weili, you order your clothes under their names rather than by size.\n\nGRRRL has also partnered with the National Eating Disorders Association in the US. While Olson got a grip on her drug addiction years back, getting a healthy relationship with food took longer \u2013 a problem that many people who train regularly will be familiar with.\n\n\u201cIn the not so distant past I was doing CrossFit, Brazilian jiu jitsu and Bikram yoga all in the same day, five days a week,\u201d she says. She\u2019s since had her breast implants removed and posts unfiltered videos of her struggles with body image, even as someone revered for her strength.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve still got a lot of programming to undo,\u201d she says.", "description": "A wave of super strong female athletes are smashing sizing stereotypes, and changing the way other women work out", "authors": ["Jenny Valentish"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a619806c4e06a055e9f8749a1d63c11eed1669c2/180_292_3629_2178/master/3629.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=53a0a724900191c24effbd64a2418b94", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
