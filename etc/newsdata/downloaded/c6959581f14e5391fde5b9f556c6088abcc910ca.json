He\u2019d be like, \u2018Ok, so I\u2019d like you to wear one of these to the premiere\u2019.\n\n\u201cI went through the book, and at the time, it wasn\u2019t what it is today. It was not for me. He was like, \u2018You have to wear the dress.\u2019 That was my only bullying. And I was like, \u2018No, I will not wear the dress\u2019.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether or not Weinstein accepted her refusal, Aniston replied: \u201cWell, what was he going to do? Come over here and make me wear it?!\u201d\n\nWeinstein is currently facing more than 70 allegations of sexual harassment and rape.\n\nThe producer has pleaded not guilty to all claims of non-consensual sex.", "description": "Jennifer Aniston has said she thinks more revelations of sexual harassment \u201cwill come to the surface\u201d.", "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/15/14/gettyimages-1155297925.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
