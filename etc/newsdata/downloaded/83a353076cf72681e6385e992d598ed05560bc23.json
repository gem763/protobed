Instead, the Media Lab labeled Epstein\u2019s donations as anonymous, according to the New Yorker. The article also alleged that Epstein assisted the Media Lab in courting other donations from the ultra-wealthy, including Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and investor Leon Black.\n\nThe day after the new allegations were published, MIT President L. Rafael Reif released a letter disclosing Ito\u2019s resignation following the, \u201cdeeply disturbing allegations about the engagement between individuals at the Media Lab and Jeffrey Epstein.\u201d Reif also said that MIT would be engaging a law firm to conduct an investigation into the article\u2019s allegations.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Our internal review process continues, and what we learn from it will inform the path ahead.\u201d\n\nIn August, Ito published an apology letter in which he addressed his relationship with Epstein. In that letter, Ito admitted that he had given permission for the Media Lab to accept funds through foundations controlled by Epstein, and he promised to raise an equivalent amount of money that the lab received from Epstein and donate it to nonprofits focused on helping sex-trafficking survivors.\n\nLast month, Epstein died by apparent suicide at a federal jail in Manhattan following his July arrest on federal sex trafficking charges.\n\nWrite to Alejandro de la Garza at alejandro.delagarza@time.com.", "description": "Joi Ito resigned following new allegations that the MIT Media Lab tried to hide the extent of its financial ties to Jeffery Epstein.", "authors": ["Alejandro De La Garza"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/joi-ito-mit-media-lab.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-08"}
