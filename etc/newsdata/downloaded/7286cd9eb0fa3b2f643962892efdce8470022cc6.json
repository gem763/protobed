He laughs uncontrollably, a piercing cackle that ascends to the heavens (or descends to hell). When he dances, it\u2019s with his gangly arms outstretched and his torso hunched in a manic daze. He has an affinity for clown makeup and a co-dependent relationship with his frail mother. He wants to be a stand-up comedian but doesn\u2019t understand jokes. When people aren\u2019t ignoring him, they\u2019re pulverizing him. His stunted development is punished by a world that doesn\u2019t sympathize with mental illness. Arthur Fleck wants to die.\n\nBut then a friend gives him a gun \u2014 it\u2019s Gotham City (aka New York City) in 1981, when crime and chaos are relentless; gotta protect yourself out there \u2014 and suddenly Arthur springs to life in a way he hasn\u2019t before. His ensuing transgressions make the evening news, and Arthur feels seen. He rebrands himself The Joker, becoming a hero to heathens who\u2019d rather light the streets on fire than seek peace.\n\nWarner Bros. Joaquin Phoenix in \"Joker.\"\n\nArthur is a movie character, but he could very well be somebody who appears on the actual evening news, one of the many mass shooters or riotous incels who have exposed America\u2019s vile ethos. He is burdened, scorned, moonstruck. It\u2019s for this reason that \u201cJoker,\u201d an origin story about the most famous villain from the \u201cBatman\u201d canon, is convinced of its own importance, even if its director, Todd Phillips (\u201cThe Hangover\u201d), insists it is \u201cnot a political film.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the thing (oh boy, there are so many things): The Joker did not need an origin story. Most villains don\u2019t. Michael Myers is terrifying because the original \u201cHalloween\u201d offers little insight about what prompts his killing spree; Darth Vader was superior before his dark night of the soul resulted in vicious lava burns. And The Joker, so effectively ghoulish when portrayed as deranged anarchists by Jack Nicholson (\u201cBatman\u201d) and Heath Ledger (\u201cThe Dark Knight\u201d), is more convincing without all the mama drama.\n\nWarner Bros. Joaquin Phoenix in \"Joker.\"\n\nWhen we first meet Arthur (a gaunt Joaquin Phoenix), he is seated at a vanity mirror applying white pancake makeup. It\u2019s his job. He performs circus-clown routines at children\u2019s hospitals and waves \u201cEverything Must Go!\u201d signs outside doomed businesses. When he appears without greasepaint, the contrast is stark. Talking to a state-assigned counselor (Sharon Washington) who asks stock questions about his well-being, Arthur is pale and skeletal, his face lined with gloominess. \u201cThe worst part about having a mental illness is people expect you to behave as if you don\u2019t,\u201d his journal reads.\n\nAn introduction this empathetic hints at a complex psychodrama that never arrives. Phillips, who co-wrote the script with Scott Silver (\u201c8 Mile\u201d), demonstrates necessary compassion and a grim stylistic verve \u2015 part horror movie, part domestic ballad. That line about mental illness turns devastating when Arthur\u2019s quasi-therapy appointments are terminated due to lack of funding. When a lonely man haunted by anguish loses his only semblance of support, where can he turn? But that\u2019s also when the film squanders whatever it hopes to say about encroaching villainy, lost amid a jumble of Man Goes Insane clich\u00e9s.\n\nDoes anyone want movies based on comic books to be this humorless? That\u2019s not a rhetorical question. I guess certain DC Comics fanatics will say a gritty screed is exactly what they want. But \u201cJoker\u201d has a hollow core, presenting Arthur as protagonist-turned-antihero without much nuance to guide the evolution. He greets his demons in the darkest of ways, discovering himself in the process. That discovery, an inferno of violence, results in an alarmingly celebratory image: The Joker, surrounded by disciples worshiping at the feet of their new god to a crescendoing score composed by Hildur Gu\u00f0nad\u00f3ttir (\u201cChernobyl\u201d).\n\nWarner Bros. Joaquin Phoenix in \"Joker.\"\n\n\u201cJoker,\u201d which I caught last week at the Toronto International Film Festival, isn\u2019t bad, per se. Defying the formula that makes most comic-book adaptations feel the same, much of it is accomplished. It oozes style, taking cues from \u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d \u201cThe King of Comedy\u201d and \u201cShutter Island.\u201d (Martin Scorese is a producer.) In a particularly engaging sequence, The Joker prances down a long outdoor staircase, his maroon and yellow suit gleaming against a bleak gray sky.\n\nBut often that style is outweighed by muddled subtext. Even after Arthur becomes a bonafide killer, nothing is all that scary, which makes the film disturbing in a manner Phillips probably didn\u2019t intend. When Arthur stabs a guy in the neck, Gary Glitter\u2019s \u201cRock and Roll\u201d \u2014 a pumped-up anthem commonly heard at sporting events \u2014 thunders in response. When he suffocates someone, a lens flare erupts across the screen, as if to bathe him in warm sunlight. Is that what these murders are meant to convey? Some sort of existential breakthrough?\n\nMuch will be made of Phoenix\u2019s performance, which had already yielded Oscar buzz. His body is bony to the point of looking sickly. His shoulder blades jut out at disturbing angles. His stomach is too concave for comfort. Frankly, it\u2019s a lot. Screen actors tend to think that weight fluctuations equal transcendence, but that\u2019s rarely the case. Phoenix is fascinating to watch, yet he relies on lunacy tropes that are fairly obvious. Having seen this character so many times now, including as recently as 2016\u2019s dreadful \u201cSuicide Squad\u201d (in which he was played by Jared Leto), it\u2019s clear how few dimensions of The Joker are left to explore. The supporting players \u2014 Robert De Niro, Zazie Beetz, Frances Conroy, Brett Cullen, Brian Tyree Henry, Marc Maron \u2014 can only add so much weight. A misguided rendition of Stephen Sondheim\u2019s \u201cSend in the Clowns\u201d adds even less.\n\nIn giving Arthur Fleck a de facto hero\u2019s journey, \u201cJoker\u201d must survive the litmus test that is modern cultural discourse. The movie, a guaranteed box-office powerhouse, will anger some people and excite others. Some have already called it dangerous, worried that juvenile admirers will see Arthur Fleck\u2019s metamorphosis as a call to arms at a time when shootings are rampant in America. The suggestion seems overblown to me, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not a complicated thing to reckon with.\n\nWhat we\u2019re left with is something that\u2019s tamer than its fiercest detractors will declare and more sinister than its loudest groupies can grasp. It is, in the end, a whole lot of nothing. But in mainstream Hollywood today, nothingness sells.\n\n\u201cJoker\u201d opens in theaters Oct. 4.", "description": "A skeletal Joaquin Phoenix is the latest actor to try his hand at the most overrepresented \u201cBatman\u201d villain.", "authors": ["Entertainment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d7bfed82300005805530546.jpeg?cache=wfjaz1eyl9&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
