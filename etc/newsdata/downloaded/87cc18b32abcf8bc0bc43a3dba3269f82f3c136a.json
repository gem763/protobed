Puerto Rico's debt is complex; the U.S. territory has a laundry list of parties that have a stake in the debt. Bondholders, pensioners and current government employees are only a fraction of them.\n\nOne of the big proposed cuts would reduce Puerto Rico's bond obligations 45 percent from $75 billion to $41 billion. The huge reduction would mean many bondholders would only get a third or two-thirds of what they're owed, the Times reported.\n\nPuerto Rico also owes $54.5 billion in pension obligations and the proposed cut would lower that number to $45 billion. However, in the process, retirees' pensions could be slashed by as much as 8.5 percent.\n\nAdditionally, there are worries that reducing retirees' pensions could affect the island's economic growth, since retirees make up a large percentage of the economy.\n\nIf the plan is passed and ends up having the desired consequences, it could become a model for states like Illinois that have considerable debt of their own.", "description": "Puerto Rico, owner of the largest United States bankruptcy in history, released a plan to cut its $129 billion debt by 33 percent Friday,", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/puertorico_080119getty_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
