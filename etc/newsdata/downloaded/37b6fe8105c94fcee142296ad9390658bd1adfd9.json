Especially as there are also rumours that a remaster of Diablo II will be announced as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBlizzard has never formally announced Diablo 4 but they\u2019ve certainly not been shy about admitting they\u2019re working on it, especially after all the backlash from Diablo Immortal at last year\u2019s BlizzCon.\n\nThey\u2019ve far more than just that to make up for now though, following fan fury over their handling of a Hong Kong pro-democracy supporter at a recent Hearthstone tournament.\n\nThat\u2019s going to ensure, for various reasons, a very interesting BlizzCon this weekend, when the fan convention starts on Friday, 1 November.\n\nEmail gamecentral@ukmetro.co.uk, leave a comment below, and follow us on Twitter\n\nMORE: Diablo 4 leaked by German artbook, Diablo 2 remaster rumoured\n\nMORE: Diablo 1 available on GOG.com as more Blizzard classics planned\n\nMORE: Blizzard denies it cut plans to show Diablo 4 at Blizzcon", "description": "It\u2019s not just Overwatch 2 that\u2019s likely to be unveiled this week but also Diablo 4 at BlizzCon, guest starring Lilith.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/EH1iWYsW4Ak7f7N-f7e3_1572255022.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
