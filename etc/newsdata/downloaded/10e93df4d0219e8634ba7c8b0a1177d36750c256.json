The company announced the news at a launch event today attended and reported on by Sina Digital.\n\nThe Mate X is a 5G phone with Huawei\u2019s Kirin 980 processor and Barong 5000 modem, and it has a dual-cell 4,500mAh battery that can reportedly be filled to 85 percent in half an hour with 55W fast charging. When unfolded, the screen is 8 inches diagonal, and when it\u2019s closed it\u2019s like having a phone with a 6.6-inch screen on the front and a 6.38-inch panel on the back.\n\nUnlike Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Fold, which opens up like a book, the Mate X\u2019s screen wraps around the outside of the clamshell device. This should make it more usable as a conventional phone than the Galaxy Fold, but the plastic-covered screen faces an even greater durability challenge since it\u2019s constantly exposed.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to see how the Mate X holds up, because it is not a cheap device. It\u2019ll start shipping in China on November 15th for 16,999 yuan, or about $2,400, which gets you a model with 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage.\n\nAs for an international release, Huawei tells The Verge in a statement that \u201cOur strategy is based on carriers\u2019 5G roll out in different regions. So far, Huawei has made the Huawei Mate X available in the China market on November 15. A global launch plan is under review.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Huawei also announced that it\u2019s shipped 200 million smartphones already in 2019, having reached that milestone 64 days earlier than it did last year. The real proof of the company\u2019s resilience, however, will come once we have year-on-year results that factor in Google-less phones like the Mate 30 Pro.", "description": "Cards on the table", "authors": ["Sam Byford", "Oct"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pzp211o0j5N1NvIHIyZ2HnyILG0=/0x124:1720x1025/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19312079/huawei_matex_mwc19_vsavov21.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
