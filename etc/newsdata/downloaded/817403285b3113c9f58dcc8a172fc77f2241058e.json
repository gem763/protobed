(Evan Vucci)\n\nPresident Trump ramped up his attacks against California cities late on Wednesday by threatening to hit San Francisco with environmental violations over its homeless population.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible situation \u2014 that\u2019s in Los Angeles and in San Francisco,\u201d Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be giving San Francisco, they\u2019re in total violation, we\u2019re going to be giving them a notice very soon.\u201d\n\nTrump said the Environmental Protection Agency should issue a notice in less than a week. It is unclear what laws San Francisco is accused of violating, but the president cited \u201ctremendous pollution\u201d entering the ocean through storm sewers, specifically expressing a concern about used needles.\n\n\u201cThey have to clean it up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t have our cities going to hell.\u201d\n\n[Trump: Homeless people hurt the \u2018prestige\u2019 of Los Angeles, San Francisco]\n\nSan Francisco officials, though, quickly disputed Trump\u2019s claims.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t had any (recent) problems with syringes,\u201d Tyler Gamble, a spokesman for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, told the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nTrump\u2019s threat comes on the same day he said he would revoke California\u2019s long-standing power to impose stricter air pollution regulations on cars and trucks. Experts and environmental groups have warned that doing so would subvert efforts to curb carbon dioxide emissions within the transportation sector, in addition to ignoring health benefits associated with energy efficient vehicles.\n\n[Trump tweets he\u2019s revoking California\u2019s power to limit pollution from cars and trucks]\n\nAhead of his two-day visit to California, Trump has sharply criticized the state for its homeless population, arguing that people living on the streets were ruining the \u201cprestige\u201d of Los Angeles and San Francisco. He told reporters on Tuesday that he had personally heard complaints from people in the state, some of whom are foreigners.\n\n\u201cThe people of San Francisco are fed up, and the people of Los Angeles are fed up,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at it, and we\u2019ll be doing something about it.\u201d", "description": "The president cited \u201ctremendous pollution\u201d entering the ocean through storm sewers, specifically expressing a concern about used needles.", "authors": ["Allyson Chiu", "Reporter With The Morning Mix Team", "September At Am", "Allyson Chiu Is A Reporter With The Washington Post'S Morning Mix Team.
