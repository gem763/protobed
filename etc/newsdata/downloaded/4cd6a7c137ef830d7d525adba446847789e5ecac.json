Samsung\u2019s latest 5G phone, however, is the Galaxy A90 5G, which means it fits into its mid-range Galaxy A lineup below phones like the S10 and Note 10.\n\nSamsung has recently released other Galaxy A models that focus on high-end features like quad-camera systems and flip-up camera mechanisms as part of a strategy to combat aggressively competitive Chinese manufacturers. And to be clear, the Galaxy A90 5G would have seemed like a very high-end phone at the beginning of this year, and still has a more than solid spec sheet. 5G connectivity and Samsung DeX support aside, though, the phone feels pretty familiar.\n\nThe A90 5G has a Snapdragon 855 processor, 6 or 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage. The screen is a 6.7-inch 1080p OLED panel with a small \u201cInfinity-U\u201d notch and an integrated fingerprint sensor. There\u2019s a triple-camera system with a primary 48-megapixel sensor (presumably Samsung\u2019s own), an 8-megapixel ultrawide camera, and a 5-megapixel sensor for depth information, along with a 32-megapixel selfie camera. The battery is 4,500mAh and charges at up to 25W.\n\n5G is of course a differentiator for some, but on paper the specs put the A90 5G right up against reasonably priced phones like the Xiaomi Mi 9T Pro (known as the Redmi K20 Pro in India), and it\u2019s hard to judge how competitive it\u2019ll be without release information for various markets. (5G isn\u2019t yet a factor in India, for example.) All we know for now is that the Galaxy A90 5G is coming out in South Korea tomorrow, and Samsung hasn\u2019t announced pricing details.", "description": "Samsung has announced the Galaxy A90 5G, a new mid-range 5G phone for South Korea.", "authors": ["Sam Byford", "Sep"], "top_image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jGHGlwuwPJrUA9ZY5t0IsEi0oSs=/0x6:980x519/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19161536/05.Device_design.png", "published_at": "2019-09-02"}
