It was unclear if the Japanese broadcaster was referring to one or more members of the crew, or the vessel's entire crew.\n\nThe coastguard and a patrol boat from Japan's Fisheries Agency have begun a search, the spokesman said, adding that it was not known why the boat had sunk.\n\nThe incident took place in the same area in which a Japanese patrol boat and a North Korean fishing boat were involved in a crash this month, while the patrol boat was chasing the North Korean boat off Japanese waters.\n\nJapan rescued about 60 North Korean crew members in that incident, after the fishing boat sank.", "description": "Fate of those on board the fishing boat remain unknown as Japanese coastguard and patrol boat search Sea of Japan.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/16/76192534c8294835957871003c06d3b6_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
