So our district attorney, his opinion is that Matty Roberts and Facebook stand to be partially to blame for this\u201d Lee told Gizmodo. \u201cHe\u2019s already told people that this is quote-unquote \u2018His event.\u2019 He told some of the other event promoters that this was his event. And so I guess if it\u2019s his event and he\u2019s taken ownership of it then we know where legal action should go toward. I\u2019m not an attorney but that is what Lincoln County district attorney is saying.\u201d\n\nDistrict Attorney Dylan Frehner was not immediately available for a Gizmodo interview. According to Las Vegas Review-Journal and Las Vegas Fox affiliate KVVU, the district attorney\u2019s office is considering taking legal action against Roberts and the platform he used to start this fiasco \u2014 Facebook.\n\nTraditionally, Facebook would be considered protected from legal action regarding content created by one of its users under Section 230 of the U.S. Communications Decency Act. But time will tell if Frehner\u2019s office intends to argue that this particular circumstance wouldn\u2019t be covered by those protections.\n\n\u201cAnybody who is promoting any illegal activity, we will be seeking to possibly prosecute,\u201d said Frehner, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal. Frehner reportedly cited the Nevada misdemeanour crime of \u201cpublishing matter inciting breach of peace,\u201d which carries a $2,944 fine and up to a year in county jail.\n\nLas Vegas Review-Journal reports that the county is considering legal action to recoup whatever expenditures that the state won\u2019t match.\n\nFacebook did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFrank DiMaggio, an event producer who has partnered with Roberts, shrugged off the legal threats.\n\n\u201cGood luck with that. Facebook \u2014 I mean you might as well go after the Queen of England,\u201d DiMaggio told Gizmodo. \u201cAs far as going after Matty or the promoters: So here\u2019s the deal \u2014 if you\u2019re going to be offering 250-plus emergency responders for an event, why not just cancel the event? They offered the permit. They permitted it. Now they\u2019re saying, \u2018Oh look what you made us do.\u2019\u201d\n\nHowever local authorities have suggested they felt issuing permits was the only way to control the surge of humanity that will come due to the popularity of the Storm Area 51 phenomenon. Lincoln County planning department director Cory Lytle told KVVU granting permits was the \u201clesser of two evils.\u201d", "description": "No one is sure what will happen later this week in Rachel, Nevada \u2014 the location of a planned Aliengate festival that evolved out of a viral Facebook event \u2014 but local authorities are already considering taking legal action to cover the $US250,000 ($367,954) the county plans to spend to prepare for the potential...", "authors": ["David Tracy", "David Nield"], "top_image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_lfill,w_1200,h_628,q_90/dxwiqfbydlrwleonaxcf.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-20"}
