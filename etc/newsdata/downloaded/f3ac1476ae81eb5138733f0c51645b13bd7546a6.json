And we're very excited to get this mission underway.\"\n\nJessica Meir and Hannah Koch had to wait for space suits that fit women. NASA\n\nNASA originally wanted to conduct an all-female spacewalk last spring, but did not have enough medium-size suits ready to go. Koch and Meir were supposed to install more new batteries in a spacewalk next week, but had to venture out three days earlier to deal with an equipment failure that occurred over the weekend. They need to replace an old battery charger for one of the three new batteries that was installed last week by Koch and Andrew Morgan.\n\n\"Jessica and Christina, we are so proud of you. You're going to do great today,\" Morgan radioed from inside as the women exited the hatch.\n\nMeir, making her spacewalking debut, became the 228th person in the world to conduct a spacewalk and the 15th woman.\n\nIt was the fourth spacewalk for Koch, who is seven months into an 11-month mission that will be the longest ever by a woman.\n\nAAP", "description": "Astronauts Christina Koch and Jessica Meir conducted the world's first female spacewalk, marking the first time in a half-century of spacewalking that a woman floated out without a male crewmate.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_1%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_695%2C$y_395/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/f2bb367d2fdbcfd7f1aabd3b869c19c3f34666a5", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
