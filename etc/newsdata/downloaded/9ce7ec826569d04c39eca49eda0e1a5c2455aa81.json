It absorbs more than 99% of visible light, removing almost all reflections, according to Levitation 29, the creative agency that collaborated with Surrey Nano Systems and BMW.\n\nLevitation 29 also claims that looking at the car can be \"interpreted by the brain as staring into a hole or even a void.\" The blackness of the surface coating causes the human eye to see less defining features of the car and instead makes it appear two-dimensional. While this may cause the X6 to \"lose\" visible parts of the body design, other features, such as the Iconic Glow kidney grille, are accentuated.\n\nRead more: Bugatti's new $18.7 million hypercar was purchased by an anonymous buyer, making it the most expensive new car ever sold\n\nThe project, starting from its conception, took 10 months to complete.\n\n\"The first Vantablack car is certainly a big tick in the box when it comes to dream projects and opens the way for even more large-scale concepts \u2014 like a stadium!\" said Levitation 29 Director Benjamin Males.\n\n\"To create the effect of infinite darkness on that scale would truly be spectacular.\"\n\nTake a look at the world's blackest car:", "description": "BMW has painted its newest X6 with Vantablack paint coats for a recent auto show, making it the world's blackest car.", "authors": ["Brittany Chang"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5d66d7242e22af1ca0036a4a?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
