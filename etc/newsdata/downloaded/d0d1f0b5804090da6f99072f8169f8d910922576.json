This is why I returned to Pilates, which I previously felt was like soulless yoga (functional, painful, boring). Plus I was persuaded to try again by a friend \u2013 not by her words, but by the way she looks: like a dancer, except not haughty.\n\nWe went together to a local teacher called Dario Novo. It was reformer Pilates: long benches with weighted springs that you adjust according to your ability and the exercise, plus multiple straps to truss yourself into when you want to do something especially complicated to your arms and legs.\n\nPilates moves are not especially graceful or exhilarating; it\u2019s one foot (or arm) on the frame of the bench while the other slides the moving part backwards and forwards. This is nursery slope stuff, of course, but the principles are control, slowness, repetition, and this is not something I can immediately understand with my body. It really helps if someone explains what the purpose is, and the mechanisms for it.\n\nThe exercises are designed to work groups of muscles to the point of failure: it\u2019s not commonly associated with gentler pursuits like Pilates and barre work, but they work on exactly the same lines. To get your muscles to the point of failure, you need to work through four motor unit types. Your body \u201crecruits\u201d fibres in a given order: slow twitch first; then, when those fail, the intermediate muscle fibres; finally \u2013 in the Novo Pilates model, during the last two to 20 seconds of the set \u2013 your fast-twitch fibres. As you progressively overload each element of the muscle, you get the greatest metabolic response.\n\nThe best analogy I\u2019ve read is that it\u2019s like overtime: when you get to that stubborn last line of defence in the muscle, you\u2019re effectively paying double for the same move.\n\nThe bit that remained mysterious was that it didn\u2019t feel painful, as such: one minute I was pushing a limb in and out in a leisurely fashion, then 60 seconds later it just stopped. I simply couldn\u2019t. Usually when I\u2019m about to fail, I have an early-warning system of at least five minutes, if not a day, during which everything that comes before is unbearable. The sheer precision of these manoeuvres is incredible.\n\nFit in my 40s: how can I do Insta-friendly yoga poses?

It wasn\u2019t the self-righteous exhaustion of strength training; it was a semi-enjoyable, unfightable, full-body weakness, the kind of thing that happens to someone in a novel when they\u2019ve had an epiphany or been poisoned. It helped that I could stay in bed all day. Again, that doesn\u2019t sound like a recommendation, but it is. It may be the first time I\u2019ve understood a fitness objective, done the fitness thing, and seen the objective realised.\n\nWhat I learned\n\nNever use momentum to complete a move: make your muscles do the work", "description": "I was persuaded to try it again by a friend because of the way she looks \u2013 like a dancer, except not haughty", "authors": ["Zoe Williams"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e6e1800b2e7f7c1af44d97e7ea828174d6bb977/0_625_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=3d19c22a0ec9592ddb1ad0f6feb9d6da", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
