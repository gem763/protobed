REUTERS/Peter Nicholls\n\nThe Heathrow Pause group aims to ground flights by illegally flying drones within 5 km of an airport, to put pressure on the government to take tougher steps to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nBut the airport said that the attempted action was not impacting flights.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no disruption,\u201d a spokeswoman for Heathrow Airport said. \u201cRunways and taxiways remain operational.\u201d\n\nPolice arrested two men at the airport on Friday on suspicion of conspiracy to commit a public nuisance in relation to operations at the airport, and have established a dispersal zone around the airport for 48 hours. Five others were arrested on Thursday away from the airport on the same grounds.\n\nHeathrow Pause said that authorities had used signal jamming to frustrate the early flights, posting a livestream of activists near the airport on a Twitter feed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a little technical glitch. The drone isn\u2019t flying,\u201d and unidentified campaigner says in the video, as another activist holds a drone in the air.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately at this time I don\u2019t have any specific updates what the next steps will be.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, police said they were confident the action would not lead to a repeat of the chaos seen at Gatwick last December, when drone sightings grounded planes in the run-up to Christmas.\n\nBut they warned that attempted disruption of the airport and flying drones without permission in the exclusion zone were serious crimes.\n\nHeathrow Pause, a splinter group of the climate group Extinction Rebellion which disrupted London streets earlier this year and which is behind Friday\u2019s planned action, said it would fly the drones at no higher than head level and say they are not looking to endanger life.\n\nHeathrow has said the demonstration was counter-productive and criminal, adding that despite talks between the two sides, the campaigners disagreed with the airport\u2019s belief that aviation can and should be decarbonised.", "description": "Climate-change activists who planned to disrupt Heathrow airport with drones were frustrated early on Friday as the devices failed to fly and Europe's biggest airport continued to operate as usual.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190913&t=2&i=1429334615&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8C0F0", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
