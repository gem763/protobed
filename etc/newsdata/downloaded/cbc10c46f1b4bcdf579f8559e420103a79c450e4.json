But Australia also committed the most turnovers of any team in the final eight, the Achilles heel that led to their record 40-16 defeat to England and early exit from the tournament.\n\nEngland 40-16 Australia: Rugby World Cup 2019 \u2013 as it happened Read more\n\nThe Wallabies attempted to play a high-tempo, high-passing game, but did not have the skill level to execute their strategy. It was not from want of trying. The Wallabies poached former All Blacks skills coach Mick Byrne and worked hard on their skill execution over the last four years.\n\nBut the Australians never quite managed to play with the pace and precision of the All Blacks or even Japan at this World Cup and could not eradicate the crucial turnovers from their game. The Wallabies enjoyed the majority of possession, 65 per cent, and the English were happy to let them have the ball, pressuring the men in gold into making costly mistakes.\n\nIt was not so much that the Wallabies committed so many more turnovers than England, but it was the time and place they made them that ruined their game. Early in the game the Wallabies strung together 18 phases on attack in England\u2019s territory only for five-eighth Christian Lealiifano to lose the ball in contact, a sign of things to come.\n\nThe Wallabies had a clear intent to keep the ball in hand, which was predictable for the English defence, mostly rock solid throughout the game. It was the Wallabies\u2019 determination to try to run the ball out of their own end, particularly in the first-half, which led to the first of England winger Jonny May\u2019s two tries.\n\nEngland into World Cup semi-finals after bruising victory over Australia Read more\n\nWhen Wallabies tight-head prop Allan Alaalatoa dropped the ball in the 22 to give England a scrum in an attacking position the English shifted the ball to the right and then swung back to the left with May crossing over in the corner in the 17th minute. It was a try that could have been so easily avoided with a long, clearing kick, but that was not the way this Wallabies team played \u2013 and England knew it.\n\nMay was over again less than three minutes later after outside centre Henry Slade intercepted a pass from Wallabies flanker David Pocock, which was intended for Lealiifano, who seemed unaware the ball was coming to him.\n\nAs in all of their games at this World Cup the Wallabies had made another bad start, trailing 17-9 at halftime. It was only England giving away kickable penalties in their red zone rather than conceding tries that kept the Wallabies remotely in the game.\n\nWhen Wallabies winger Marika Koroibete scored a spectacular try soon after the resumption of play, it looked as if Australia was right back in the game. Koroiebete received a long ball from fellow winger Reece Hodge and beat England fullback Elliot Daly with an in and away, but the score was just a flash in the pan for the Wallabies.\n\nEngland hit back with a try in the 47th minute to tight-head prop Kyle Sinckler, who ran into a huge gap off a cut-out pass from Farrell, regaining the eight-point margin.\n\nFarrell extended England\u2019s lead to 27-16 with a penalty goal in the 49th minute after the Wallabies collapsed a scrum. This had resulted from Alaalatoa being held by the defence after receiving a long, aimless pass from Lealiifano, another error which put the prop under pressure.\n\nRugby World Cup 2019: five things to look out for in the knockout stage Read more\n\nThe moment of truth arrived for the Wallabies around the 60th minute mark when they attacked the England line with a series of pick and goes. The Australians had to score or start to think about packing their bags to go home, but number eight Isi Naisarani had the ball ripped out of his clutches by Sinckler in a tackle on the ninth phase. That was just about it for the Wallabies. Critical errors at critical moments killed their campaign, so much of their pain self-inflicted.\n\nEngland winger Anthony Watson delivered the coup de grace when he intercepted yet another wayward long pass from Wallabies fullback Kurtley Beale to captain Michael Hooper and raced away.\n\nIt was a desperate measure by a desperate team, but by this stage the Wallabies looked confused as to what to do, a situation that could not have been helped by the constant chopping and changing of the Australian backline throughout the tournament.\n\nIn the end the Wallabies resembled a team with a strategy, but no tactics, up against a master tactician in England coach Eddie Jones, who knew exactly what was coming and prepared meticulously to counter it.", "description": "Critical errors at critical moments killed the Wallabies\u2019 campaign as they failed to move past the quarter-final stage.", "authors": ["Bret Harris"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40f55898697486a81ca4435fe38d43a6cf448dee/0_342_5155_3093/master/5155.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a4ed7f2593d21d530149759f31e804e0", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
