So I speak German \u2013 they accept Germans.\u201d\n\n\u201cBelgium is no longer a model for successful cohabitation and that makes me sad,\u201d Juncker added.\n\nIn response, the mayor of Ostend, Bart Tommelein, described Juncker\u2019s analysis as \u201cstrange\u201d. \u201cEveryone is welcome here, no matter what language they are trying to speak,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nThe mayor of Middelkerke, west of Ostend, called Juncker\u2019s claims \u201cinsulting\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think Juncker was drunk when he came here and ordered his steak. He was probably unintelligible to the shopkeeper,\u201d Jean-Marie Dedecker said. \u201cI think that\u2019s a big insult. He\u2019ll apologise.\u201d\n\nBelgium is a federal state with distinct regions including Dutch-speaking Flanders in the north and French-speaking Wallonia in the south, but there is growing support for parties advocating Flemish independence.\n\nJuncker said he did not believe the division in Belgium was an indication of a wider problem in Europe.\n\nHe told the Dutch-language Belgian newspaper Tijd: \u201cThis is a purely Belgian phenomenon. Belgium is a state, but the communities see themselves as nations, particularly Flanders. Wallonia is not a national concept in itself, but Flanders thinks of itself and behaves like a nation. It\u2019s incredible to see these two entities, who are actually very different, living together without actually living together.\n\n\u201cBut I am proud of Belgium for Belgium. It is a beautiful country, with talented, resourceful people.\u201d", "description": "EU commission president says Belgium is no longer a model for successful cohabitation", "authors": ["Daniel Boffey"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff7851b4a411557a920f5bc8e327d3b1cb90b053/637_238_4547_2728/master/4547.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=1b57c4c05f83ee1b6c7192d1f192b70e", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
