Mr. Trump\u2019s suspicious view of Ukraine set the stage for events that led to the impeachment inquiry against him.\n\nThe visit by Mr. Orban, who is seen as an autocrat who has rolled back democracy, provoked a sharp dispute within the White House. John R. Bolton, then the president\u2019s national security adviser, and Fiona Hill, then the National Security Council\u2019s senior director for Eurasian and Russian affairs, opposed a White House invitation for the Hungarian leader, according to the people briefed on the matter. But they were outmaneuvered by Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, who supported such a meeting.\n\nAs a result, Mr. Trump at a critical moment in the Ukraine saga sat down in the Oval Office with a European leader with a fiercely negative outlook on Ukraine that fortified opinions he had heard from his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia repeatedly over the months and years.", "description": "The discussion at the White House between President Trump and Prime Minister Viktor Orban was held over objections from Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser.", "authors": ["Peter Baker", "Nicholas Fandos"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/21/us/politics/21dc-prexy1/21dc-prexy1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
