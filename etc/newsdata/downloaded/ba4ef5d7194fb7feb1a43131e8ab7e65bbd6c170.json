As someone who is open and out about it, it\u2019s frustrating at times because I feel like in situations like this, it just feels thrown around.\u201d\n\nWest made the candid remarks about his addiction while doing press for the release of his new album \"Jesus Is King.\"\n\n\"Like, for me, Playboy was my gateway into full-on pornography addiction,\" West told Zane Lowe on Apple Music's Beats 1 radio Tuesday. \"My dad had a Playboy left out at age five and it's affected almost every choice I made for the rest of my life.\"\n\nHe continued: \"From age five til now, having to kick the habit and it just presents itself in the open like it's ok and I stand up and say, 'No, it's not ok.' I think when people have been addicted to something like, if you ask somebody that's a drug addict it's like you say, 'Are you still addicted?' Well yeah, you turn it off actually.\"\n\nMIKE CAUSSIN CLARIFIED HIS COMMENT THAT JANA KRAMER CHEATING ON HIM WOULD BE A 'DEAL BREAKER'\n\nWhen Kramer asked Caussin for his thoughts about sex addiction being something that can just be turned off, her husband disagreed.\n\n\"That\u2019s different from being powerless and ruining your life and your basing every day around sex \u2026 What guy out there isn\u2019t going to say that at some point I saw a pair of boobs and was like, 'Yep I liked those'?\" Caussin retorted.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Unfortunately, because it's Kanye West and because he's had periods of just outlandish comments, until there's consistency, it's hard for me to believe everything he's saying,\" said Caussin.\n\nBack in March, Caussin and Kramer celebrated one year of Caussin\u2019s sobriety for his sex addiction.\n\nThe couple has been married since May 2015, but separated in August 2016 due to Caussin's infidelity and battle with sex addiction.\n\nIn December 2017, Kramer and Caussin renewed their vows. They share two children together: daughter Jolie, 3, and son Jace, 11 months.", "description": "Mike Caussin is hesitant to believe Kanye West about his \"sex addiction.\"", "authors": ["Viktoria Ristanovic"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/04/jana-kramer-michael-caussin-getty.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
