They distort, mislead, misrepresent, slander and muddle context.\n\nAs their Marxist hero Saul Alinsky taught them in \"Rules for Radicals,\" the ends justify the means. In other words, anything goes -- any lie is excused -- to create \"fairness, equality and social justice.\"\n\nAs an example, all we've heard for months is how we are either entering a recession or already in one. The mainstream media, now the public relations arm of the Democratic Party, drills into your head a hundred times a day, \"Things are getting worse, the Trump economy is sinking, get ready for bad times.\"\n\nIs that true? Or is it fake news?\n\nAgainst all odds, jobless claims fell this past week. The so-called experts were shocked. There was a massive General Motors strike. GM's suppliers were expected to lay off workers. But they didn't. The demand for U.S. workers remains high. Everyone who wants a job has a job. Wages are growing. And there are few layoffs. In a tight job market, companies can't afford to let anyone go.\n\nThen a CNBC headline announced, \"2019 is Shaping Up To Be One of the Best Years Ever for Investing.\" It reports this could be the first year in history every asset class is up double-digits -- stocks, bonds, oil and gold. The S&P 500 is up 22%, gold is up 16.1%, oil is up 17.8% and U.S. Treasury bonds are up 9%.\n\nThis is what you call the Trump Economic Miracle.\n\nBut sadly, I'm here to report you can't trust any of the polls, either. They are as fake as the news.\n\nRecent Fox News and Gallup polls were used by the liberal mainstream media to prove America has turned against Trump. Both polls were as crooked as a $3 bill.\n\nThe Fox News poll did not measure using reliable \"likely voters.\" It polled only notoriously unreliable \"registered voters.\" And it overrepresented Democrats by a mile. Forty-eight percent of the respondents were Democrats. But in the real electorate, Democrats make up 31% of the voters. That's a massive double-digit swing in favor of Democrats. That's as fake as polling gets.\n\nOf course, those fake metrics produced a poll that showed 51% of voters support Trump being impeached and removed from office.\n\nThen Gallup produced a poll that showed 52% of Americans support Trump's impeachment and removal from office. But Gallup never asked if respondents were registered to vote. These were 1,526 random people who answered their phones. Gallup also never checked if they were illegal aliens or noncitizens. Many of the respondents answered the questions in Spanish.\n\nBut it gets worse. Gallup also weighted the poll in such a way that each Republican who answered was counted as only 85% of a respondent, while Democrats who responded were counted as 107%.\n\nNow you know why the results came out so skewed against President Trump. Pure fake news. If you poll more Democrats, of course the results will be deadly for Trump.\n\nI have the answer. My new \"Root Poll\" will poll only Republicans, conservatives, patriots, gun owners and business owners. I'm betting my poll will show 90% of the electorate supports Trump. That's proof that Trump will be reelected, right?\n\nMy Root Poll makes about as much sense as the fake news polls you've been force-fed by the fake-news media.\n\nWayne Allyn Root is a CEO, entrepreneur, best-selling author, nationally syndicated talk show host on USA Radio Network and the host of \"The Wayne Allyn Root Show\" on Newsmax TV nightly at 8 p.m. ET.", "description": "Last week, I wrote about why you can't trust a .10/27/2019 0:18:21AM EST.", "authors": ["Wayne Allyn Root", "Bronson Stocking", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2018/354/63b3af8d-4413-480e-867d-76bb1e91edfa.png", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
