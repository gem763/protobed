These included a rampage by cartel gunmen during the attempted arrest of a drug lord\u2019s son and a gunfight that killed 13 police officers.\n\nMexico sent special forces on Monday to patrol the northern city of Culiacan after the city-wide assault by gunmen that led authorities to free Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzman\u2019s son in a storm of bullets.\n\nPresident Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has been strongly criticized for authorities\u2019 botched handling of the Culiacan arrest, which critics say risks encouraging cartels to use more force than ever before to resist arrests. But the left-leaning populist has insisted the decision to release Ovidio Guzman was made to save lives.\n\nThe country was hit by a record number of homicides in 2018. Lopez Obrador, who took office in December, has promised that a security strategy premised on \u201chugs, not bullets\u201d can correct the \u201cfailed policies\u201d of past administrations and help stem the tide of Mexico\u2019s drug-related violence.\n\nAccording to an official with the Marines branch of Mexico\u2019s armed forces, who asked not to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the press, 11 caches of drugs stashed in liquor stores and at least two underground tunnels controlled by the Union cartel were uncovered in Tuesday\u2019s raid.", "description": "Security forces arrested 31 suspected cartel members on Tuesday in a raid on a warren of clandestine tunnels and alleged drug laboratories in Mexico City, authorities said.", "authors": ["Lizbeth Diaz", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
