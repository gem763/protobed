I buy from all of them and recommend browsing the websites of Adnams, Corney & Barrow, Haynes Hanson & Clark, Lea & Sandeman, Private Cellar, Tanners and Yapp Brothers for some serious treats.\n\nSearching under a tenner? Adnams Douro Red 2017 (14.5%) is a spicy Portuguese beauty that over-delivers for \u00a39.99. Tanners Merlot Pays D\u2019Oc 2018 (13%) is a juicy red from \u00a38.20 and for a white, Private Cellar\u2019s Les Rafeli\u00e8res Sauvignon Blanc 2018 (12%) is \u00a39.95 and tastes like a mini-Sancerre. I ordered six mixed bottles each from Lea & Sandeman and Haynes Hanson & Clark. Surprise wine of the day? A US blend from Lea & Sandeman: Stem Theory 2015 (14.5%), \u00a324.50 \u2013 so good I just had to buy it.", "description": "The Bunch unites seven top UK independent wine merchants who gather annually to share their best bottles.
