Perhaps this was because my personal reaction on reading the dossier was mild amusement at how very poorly it was written and how absurd the patently \u201csalacious and unverified\u201d allegations sounded.\n\nIn the end, what sounded like bogus claims turned out to be bogus claims.\n\nYou would think Democrats and their media allies would have learned a lesson from this nonexistent \u201cRussia collusion\u201d debacle. But Democrats have once again unquestioningly accepted hearsay allegations from a politically biased source in the whistleblower complaint.\n\nGOP SEN. KEVIN CRAMER SAYS ATTACKS ON TRUMP WILL NEVER CEASE: 'HATERS ARE GOING TO HATE'\n\nPerhaps strangest of all in this strangest of political times, Democrats initiated an impeachment inquiry based on these allegations before even seeing either the complaint itself or a transcript of the call to which it referred.\n\nThough I rarely agree with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., on policy, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s stupid. So I was puzzled by her willingness to pursue this extremely risky step without anything approaching evidence of serious wrongdoing.\n\nI thought perhaps a combination of the pending election, the weak slate of potential Democratic presidential nominees, plus President Trump\u2019s increasingly obvious economic success, had created political desperation so intense that Pelosi\u2019s only choice was to take an extreme political risk.\n\nAt this point, I asked myself, what else have they got? Elizabeth Warren? A Hillary Clinton rematch? Seriously?\n\nBut then it occurred to me that this could all make sense. People tend to believe that others will do what they themselves would do if faced with similar choices. No one wants to believe other people would make choices morally superior to their own.\n\nThis certainly explains the rush to accept the Steele dossier\u2019s absurd claims. According to The New York Times: \u201cFusion GPS was hired on behalf of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s campaign and the D.N.C. by their law firm, Perkins Coie, to compile research about Mr. Trump, his businesses and associates \u2013 including possible connections with Russia. It was at that point that Fusion GPS hired Mr. Steele, who has deep sourcing in Russia, to gather information.\u201d\n\nWhether you call this opposition research (meaning Democrats did it) or collusion (meaning Republicans did it), it\u2019s certainly easy to see why Democrats incorrectly believed nominee Trump would look to Russia for information that could influence the election. It was the very conduct in which the Democrats had engaged.\n\nHow about the whistleblower\u2019s complaint? Well, again according to The New York Times, former Vice President Joe Biden \u201cthreatened to withhold $1 billion in United States loan guarantees if Ukraine\u2019s leaders did not dismiss the country\u2019s top prosecutor, who had been accused of turning a blind eye to corruption.\u201d Not coincidentally, the prosecutor \u201cwas soon voted out by the Ukrainian Parliament.\u201d\n\nSo did anyone associated with Biden benefit from his actions? Well, Mr. Biden\u2019s son Hunter \u201chad a stake in the outcome\u201d as he was \u201cpaid as much as $50,000 per month\u201d for being \u201con the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general.\u201d\n\nWhether you call this fighting corruption (meaning a Democrat did it) or an abuse of power (meaning a Republican did it), it\u2019s once again easy to see why Democrats would so easily believe that President Trump threatened to withhold foreign aid to obtain a personal benefit. It\u2019s exactly what Democrats did under similar circumstances.\n\nLess than one day after Pelosi announced her impeachment inquiry, President Trump discredited the whistleblower\u2019s allegations by releasing a rough transcript of his call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe rough transcript shows that Trump did not condition foreign aid on any action by Zelensky. Zelensky has since confirmed that he didn\u2019t feel any such pressure from Trump.\n\nThe transcript also shows that Zelensky, not Trump, brought up Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani visiting Ukraine to investigate corruption. And despite incredibly biased media coverage to the contrary, the only \u201cfavor\u201d Trump requested in the call concerned investigating foreign interference in our 2016 election \u2013 a subject that used to be of great interest to Democrats.\n\nIn reality, if someone suggested withholding aid to pressure a foreign power into besmirching a political opponent, President Trump would be the first person in the room to say \u201cNo way\u201d \u2013 or likely something far more graphic and inappropriate to repeat here.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut much like the false \u201cRussiagate\u201d debacle, because of their willingness to believe President Trump would act as they would in similar circumstances, the Democrats (and their media allies) now find themselves prematurely committed to an impeachment inquiry based on the flimsiest of justifications.\n\nI fully expect their hollow abuse of power claims to continue. They have no choice at this point. They will continue to stir up a lot of dust and when the dust settles, once again, there will be nothing there.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDY PUZDER", "description": "Democrats will continue to stir up a lot of dust with their impeachment inquiry and when the dust settles there will be nothing there.", "authors": ["Andy Puzder", "Andy Puzder Was Chief Executive Officer Of"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/13f2d382-trump-pelosi.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
