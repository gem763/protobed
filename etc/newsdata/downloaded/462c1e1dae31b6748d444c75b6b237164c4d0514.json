But the French state retains its capacity to botch the merger.\n\nFiat and Peugeot shares jumped on the news, up 7.5% and 6.2% respectively in mid-day trading on Wednesday, while Renault\u2019s RNO, -4.60% sank 4%.\n\nThe merger would not only see Fiat thumbing its nose at the French government, but Peugeot chief executive Carlos Tavares thumbing his own at Renault. Portugal-born Tavares resigned from Renault, where he had worked 32 years and climbed to the number-two position under then-chairman Carlos Ghosn, after it became clear to him that he would not rise to the top.\n\nThe French government owns a 12.2% stake in Peugeot, the consequence of a 2014 multi-billion state-sponsored bailout of the company, then teetering near bankruptcy. China\u2019s Dongfeng 489, -2.39% and the Peugeot founding family owns similar stakes, albeit with bigger voting rights.\n\nBecause the merger will be presented as one \u201cof equals\u201d, as it credibly can, and Tavares is expected to be the chief executive of the merged entity, the French government\u2019s fears about a loss of control could be soothed. But you can still expect the usual noises from ministers about the necessary \u201cvigilance\u201d in the need to \u201cprotect jobs\u201d in French factories.\n\nA reasonable chief executive in a sensitive sector like the autos industry would normally check with their big shareholders when holding merger talks with a foreign competitor. So Tavares may have verified beforehand that there wouldn\u2019t be political trouble. And Fiat-Peugeot looks like the ideal \u201cpan-European\u201d merger French President Emmanuel Macron is so keen on.\n\nBut if the Renault experience is any guide, Tavares also knows that the one predictable thing about the state as shareholder is its unpredictability.", "description": "The government\u2019s 12% stake in Peugeot gives it potential meddling power", "authors": ["Pierre Brian\u00e7on", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HU283_CTavar_ZG_20191030080412.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
