I am not in a position to respond to the rest of your inquiry, it\u2019s premature. Like we did with the previous review by the NDPP [national director of public prosecutions], we will communicate on the relevant details and the decision when the process is complete.\u201d\n\nThe trio\u2019s lawyer, Bernard Hotz, said he submitted \u201ccompelling\u201d representations to the NPA not to prosecute his clients.\n\n\u201cWe made it very clear that in fact there were no charges that were supposed to be laid against my clients.\u201d\n\nHotz explained that preliminary representations made in March last year were handed to the state on Wednesday.\n\nBut, the activities and the formation of the so-called rogue unit remain the subject of a separate matter in the Pretoria High Court.\n\nLast month, EFF leader Julius Malema filed court papers accusing State Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo of dusting off an \u201cold apartheid secrecy statute to try to stop the public reading\u201d of the 2014 inspector general of intelligence report confirming the alleged rogue activities of the Sars investigative unit.\n\nPublic Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane sided with the EFF in her affidavit filed on Friday, stating that the publication of the inspector general of intelligence\u2019s report was \u201cnecessary in the review application and demonstrates the reasonableness of my findings\u201d.\n\nIn a July report, Mkhwebane found that the so-called rogue unit existed and those involved in its establishment, including former Sars commissioner Pravin Gordhan, must be sanctioned.\n\nIn today\u2019s age of free and fast-flow of information, government should always err on the side of transparency\u201d Julius Malema\n\nThe EFF wants the court to order that the inspector general of intelligence\u2019s report be publicly shared, saying the party is entitled to have the report.\n\nThe party insists that the law Dlodlo relied on was unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and accordingly invalid.\n\nIt intends to argue that on a constitutionally compliant interpretation of that section, publication of the report is not prohibited.\n\nIf that interpretation is not sustainable, then the EFF intends to argue that the section is unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and is an unjustifiable infringement of, inter alia, section 32 of the Constitution.\n\nMalema said that \u201cin today\u2019s age of free and fast-flow of information, government should always err on the side of transparency\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe minister is attempting to claw the inspector-general\u2019s report back from the public domain.\u201d\n\nMkhwebane, in her affidavit in support of the EFF to have the report made public filed on Friday, said the state security minister had previously undertaken to provide her office with a declassified copy of the report but later backtracked.\n\n\u201cTo date, I have not received the inspector general of intelligence\u2019s report, and I have not been informed of the basis on which that undertaking was not carried out.\n\n\u201cThere is no legal or constitutional basis on which it is justifiable to interdict the release and publication of the inspector general of intelligence\u2019s report as it is already in the public domain by virtue of it being referenced in this application and further since the publication of my report,\u201d she added.\n\nThe three former Sars executives face charges of corruption, racketeering and fraud relating to an operation dubbed \u201cProject Sunday Evenings\u201d which allegedly saw the illegal installation of covert cameras and microphones at the offices of the now defunct Scorpions and the NPA\u2019s offices in Silverton in 2007.\n\nFormer Sars employee Helgard Lombard, who has turned a key state witness in the case, admitted that he installed the hidden cameras which were remotely accessible.\n\nLombard, who has been on suspension since 2015, said he was paid R900 000 to install the cameras, and a further R250 000 for providing encrypted cellphones to members of the Scorpions.\n\nThe case against the trio was opened in March last year by former Sars commissioner Tom Moyane.", "description": "Prosecutors asking for month-long postponement to allow their boss Batohi to consider recommendations that there are no prospects of a successful prosecution", "authors": ["Abram Mashego", "Setumo Stone"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9158/263dd13160a940e08bf448e8ea9dbd89.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
