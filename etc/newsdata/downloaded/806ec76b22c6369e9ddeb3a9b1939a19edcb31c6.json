But although she was told her condition was terminal, she refused to focus on death and instead chose to focus on living.\n\nFrom her complete positivity when I spoke to Leah in August, I never imagined it would be her last interview.\n\nShe said: \u201cI still hope I could get my impossible miracle. And if not, I am going to have a bloody good time along the way.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to go and fulfil a bucket list, that\u2019s not my style, I just want to do the things I want to do while I am healthy and strong, I won\u2019t let myself live in fear, I\u2019m just going to live a good life.\u201d\n\nLeah was best known for her role as Emmerdale\u2019s Zoe Tate, the soap character she played for almost 16 years from December 1989.\n\nShe was devoted to her grown-up daughters Maya and Lily, and her husband Jez Hughes - she called him her \u201crock\u201d - and who she quietly married in 2017 six months after her diagnosis.\n\n(Image: Ken McKay/ITV/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nToday her agent released a statement saying: \u201cIt is with the deepest sadness that Leah Bracknell\u2019s family confirm that Leah passed away in September, three years after her diagnosis with stage 4 lung cancer.\n\n\u201cThey would like to thank all the public for their support and generosity which contributed to the extension and quality of her life over the past three years.\n\n\u201cLeah continued to embrace life and faced her illness with positivity. Leah had an energy and enthusiasm for life, a kind heart and much love to give to those around her.\u201d\n\nTributes poured in from friends and co-stars across the acting industry, with all of them citing her caring nature as well as her talent as an actress.\n\nMandy Dingle actress Lisa Riley, who worked with Leah on the Emmerdale, said: \u201cLeah lived her life to the fullest, her legacy will truly live on.\n\n\"She played my fairy godmother in Emmerdale and that\u2019s what she was in real life too - there was nobody on that show that Leah didn\u2019t help. She will be missed so much by everyone who knew her.\u201d\n\nDominic Brunt, who plays vet Paddy Kirk in Emmerdale, tweeted: \u201cI lost a good friend today. She was truly amazing in lots of different ways and I shall miss her x\u201d\n\nAdele Silva, who played Kelly Windsor in the show, tweeted: \u201c#Leah what a truly lovely human being- such a sad loss.\u201d\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nAnd Coronation Street \u2019s Sally Ann Matthews, who plays Jenny Connor, tweeted: \u201cSo sorry to hear that the beautiful soul, Leah Bracknell, has lost her battle with cancer. The world has lost a little sparkle x\u201d\n\nBorn Alison Rosalind Bracknell, she took the professional name Leah in honour of her Chinese-Malaysian actress mother Li-er Hwang.\n\nHer father, television director David, gave Leah her first acting role in TV series The Chiffy Kids in 1976, before she took her future into her own hands.\n\nOnly two years after studying at Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art and aged 25, she was cast in ITV\u2019s Emmerdale.\n\nJohn Whiston, managing director of continuing drama and head of ITV in the North, said: \u201cEveryone on Emmerdale is very sad to hear of the death of Leah Bracknell. Leah was a hugely popular member of the Emmerdale cast for over 16 years.\n\n\u201cDuring that time she featured in some of the show\u2019s most high profile and explosive plots and always delivered a pitch perfect performance. Zoe Tate was one of soaps first lesbian characters and Leah made sure the character was both exciting and credible.\n\n\u201cLeah herself was a very generous and caring colleague, much loved by cast and crew alike.\u201d\n\n(Image: ITV)\n\nShe left the series in 2005 in an episode voted the Best Exit at the British Soap Awards in May 2006.\n\nBut that certainly didn\u2019t spell the end of her acting career, appearing in Judge John Deed, Casualty 1907, A Tuuch of Frost, DCI Banks, Doctors and another ITV1 soap, The Royal Today.\n\nShe also turned her attention to theatre, starring in both Gaslight and Strangers On A Train.\n\nHer battle with cancer only came to light when he launched a Go Fund Me page to raise money for her to undergo treatment overseas.\n\nHer first oncologist had told her she had just months to live. But she refused to contemplate death.\n\nUsing her experience as a yoga teacher and shamanic healer, she decided on a positive mindset, saying: \u201cI sat myself down and thought, \u2018How do I want to live now?\u2019\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cThe focus is all on dying. So I thought, \u2018How can I get the most out of my life, who do I want to be?\u2019 You can still live a rich life whatever s*** is thrown at you.\u201d\n\nMore than 2,500 fans joined together to raise \u00a350,000 to help pay for cutting-edge treatment for her in Germany.\n\nShe thanked everyone involved, adding: \u201cI really did not expect or feel deserving of such interest and kindness.\u201d\n\n(Image: Yorkshire Television)\n\nBut she never made it to Germany and instead underwent treatment here on the NHS, and was taking part in a clinical trial in the months before her death.\n\nShe launched a blog called Something Beginning With C about her cancer journey, through which she shared her hopes and fears, and was writing a book which she hoped would help other cancer sufferers and their families.\n\nAnd she refused to be defined by traditional labels - instead taking inspiration from the Extinction Rebellion protests she attended over the summer despite her illness - and styled herself as a \u201ccancer rebel\u201d.\n\nShe explained: \u201cA lot of the labels around cancer are very military - you battle cancer, you have got to keep fighting it.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of language is very negative and not very helpful for someone with cancer - I read headlines about myself and they would say things like cancer victim, cancer sufferer, cancer-stricken. But I didn\u2019t recognise myself in that - that was not how I would describe myself.\u201d\n\nShe really was no victim. Leah refused to listen to doctors\u2019 prognosis, instead choosing to focus on living her best life.\n\n(Image: REX/Shutterstock)\n\nIn that last interview, listening to her talk with such optimism about her illness and hope for the future was truly humbling.\n\nLeah was most certainly a glass half full person, and she refused to be defined by her illness or let it stop her from enjoying life.\n\nShe spoke of setting an example to her two beloved daughters Maya and Lily of how to rise to life\u2019s most extreme challenges.\n\nAs the family grieve together, there is no doubt that Leah\u2019s spirit and positivity will live on through them just as she wanted.", "description": "Leah Bracknell, 55, was diagnosed with stage 4 of the disease in 2016.
