I wanted to punch him in the face.\u201d\n\nNEWSLETTERS The Daily Beast\u2019s Obsessed Everything we can\u2019t stop loving, hating, and thinking about this week in pop culture.

About 15 years ago, Wiley tracked down and found Scholl, eventually developing a close relationship with him. She called him dad. He officiated her wedding. Her children call him Poppa. Then two years ago, she took DNA tests from 23andMe and Ancestry.com to learn more about her family\u2019s health. The results changed everything.\n\nDiscovering that Dr. McMorries was actually her biological father tore her world apart, and that of her family\u2019s. She has since become a passionate activist, crusading for legislation that would criminalize the unethical misconduct of fertility specialists like McMorries, attempting to finally bringing accountability into the largely unregulated fertility industry. Thanks in large part to her efforts, Wiley\u2019s home state of Texas now considers the malpractice to be sexual assault.\n\nRecent years have seen over 20 doctors all over the world make headlines after it came to light that they had, decades earlier, secretly used their own sperm to inseminate patients, usually arguing it was to increase the odds of success. Among the most famous cases, and the one that seems to be drawing the most parallels to Almost Family, is that of Dr. Donald Cline, a fertility specialist in Indianapolis who, based on DNA testing, has fathered at least 61 children.\n\n\u201c I think they minimized fertility fraud. It is medical rape and sexual assault. They made a comedy out of it. It was awful. \u201d\n\nIn the week since Almost Family premiered, we talked to several of the now-grown children whose parents were defrauded by Dr. Cline and Dr. McMorries. They all admit to being triggered and, in almost every case, \u201chorrified\u201d by the Fox series, specifically the heartwarming, uplifting, tone it takes in dramatizing the most traumatic event of their own lives.\n\nThey had known of and many had seen the Australian series, Sisters, which Almost Family is based on. But they report being shocked by how more light-heartedly the Fox series seemed to approach the subject. They are disappointed in how the series glosses over the darkness of what they experienced, saying that it \u201cglorifies\u201d what they think should be considered \u201cmedical rape,\u201d a term that some have used to describe this kind of fraud and sexual assault.\n\nMore, they feel marginalized and dismissed by the show\u2019s repetition of a criticism they face nearly every time they speak out\u2014that they should feel lucky to be alive, no matter what it took to bring them here\u2014to the point that they feel the show could do actual harm to their cause of passing legislation that criminalizes these acts.\n\n\u201cI thought it was disgusting,\u201d Julie Manes, one of the children secretly fathered by Dr. Cline, says about the show. \u201cI think they minimized fertility fraud. It is medical rape and sexual assault. They made a comedy out of it. It was awful.\u201d\n\nJacoba Ballard is one of the more than 60 children conceived with Dr. Cline\u2019s own sperm in the brick office building on 86th Street in Indianapolis.\n\nShe first screened the premiere of Almost Family with some of her half siblings, a group that\u2019s become known collectively as the \u201cCline Children.\u201d (The show one-ups reality with its own reductive moniker, referring to the characters by the hashtag #BechleyBabies.)\n\nIn the aftermath of the revelation of Dr. Cline\u2019s actions, Ballard has connected with many of her half siblings, a community bonded by unusual circumstances who talk online, by text, and occasionally in-person to support each other as they grapple with their new realities.\n\nBut despite the relationships she\u2019s forged with these siblings, she does not recognize her experience in that of the women in Almost Family, who seem to fast-forward directly through trauma to acceptance and, in some cases, even enjoyment of their new realities.\n\n\u201cThey bypass the whole thing of every time we find a new sibling, it\u2019s torture all over again,\u201d Ballard says. \u201cIt\u2019s like the movie Groundhog Day. You have to explain to them all over again what happened, and you have to deal with your emotions all over again and you take on the responsibility of this new sibling.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love these people to no end,\u201d she continues. \u201cThey are my brothers and sisters and I would do anything for them. At the same time, we do bond over the fact that we are all living this nightmare. I can\u2019t tell you how many times that we call each other and we cry, especially over this show.\u201d\n\nJulie Manes\u2019s parents went into Dr. Cline\u2019s office with the expectation that he would use her father\u2019s sperm to inseminate her mother. She was never supposed to be a donor child at all. She says Dr. Cline discarded her father\u2019s sample and replaced it with his own.\n\n\u201cI believe it\u2019s both medical rape and sexual assault,\u201d she says. \u201cMost people think rape is with actual penetration. He physically took his sperm and his genetic material, his body fluid with purpose. He went into the other room and masturbated while our mothers were laying on the table in stirrups and came back into the room and inserted the sperm in our mothers without consent. That\u2019s rape.\u201d\n\nThe first two episodes of Almost Family only include the voice of one of the central characters\u2019 mothers, whose reaction to the news that she was defrauded by Dr. Bechley is indifference. She tells her daughter, \u201cI\u2019m your mother. I carried you. That\u2019s what matters\u2014not what ended up in some test tube.\u201d\n\n\u201c He masturbated while our mothers were laying on the table in stirrups and came back and inserted the sperm in our mothers without consent. That\u2019s rape. \u201d\n\nManes questions why the show is \u201cdownplaying\u201d the rage and betrayal these very real families feel and are dealing with.\n\nMarenda Tucker grew up thinking her mother had used an anonymous sperm donor to conceive her. After taking a DNA test, she found out that her biological father was actually the doctor himself, Dr. Gary Don Davis.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the rage?\u201d Tucker says. \u201cI think we were all furious. Our parents were furious. My mom felt completely violated. She calls it the great bait and switch.\" Growing up knowing that her mother used a sperm donor, she says she \u201ckind of glamorized\u201d the donor. \u201cThen to find out it\u2019s the doctor is such a different feeling. It\u2019s sickening.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by reporters earlier this summer how the series justifies its feel-good tone when the women at the center of it are products of \u201cmedical rape,\u201d creator Jason Katims was taken aback by the severity of the term.\n\n\u201cIt's a story where we\u2019re asking the question, \u2018What is family?\u2019 One of the things that I find so charming and beautiful about this story is that these three women, as adults, are discovering that they are sisters,\u201d Katims said. \u201cWhat really attracted me to this story was that, was telling this beautiful, unconventional family story in a way that we haven't seen before.\u201d\n\nTucker lets out an exasperated sigh at Katims\u2019 comments. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating to see the story coming out as a TV show, but it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t think about this every single day,\u201d she says. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something that fades away into the fabric of my past. This is my reality.\u201d\n\nEven when the show touches on real fears these characters might have, Manes says it misses the mark. In the first episode, for example, the main character of Julia, played by Brittany Snow, has sex with a man she meets online. It\u2019s the next day that the news breaks about her father, Dr. Bechley, secretly inseminating his patients. The man Julia slept with thinks he may be one of the resulting children. Julia is initially horrified, but the event is eventually dismissed as a kooky plot twist, and then forgotten about entirely.\n\n\u201cThat is our worst fear,\u201d Manes says. Many of the doctor-donor children grew up in the same small community. Now that they are all in their thirties and have their own children, they have the same concerns for their own offspring, especially as no one knows how many children were actually fathered by Dr. Cline. \u201cThe plot is completely brushed over,\u201d she says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it.\n\nWhat incensed so many of them, too, was how the show deals with Hutton\u2019s character, Dr. Bechley. In last week\u2019s first episode, he is arrested. One of his biological children, in a twist that was patently implausible to everyone we spoke to, agrees to be his defense lawyer. One of her tasks is to get the sexual assault charge against him removed.\n\nStill, the most unbelievable aspect of that plot line, to them, is that Dr. Bechley is arrested at all. After all, the doctors in their cases weren\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s only in May that Texas made it a crime for a fertility doctor to inseminate a patient without her consent, considering it sexual assault. Texas is one of only three states to criminalize this. That\u2019s why Wiley is so frustrated by the series.\n\n\u201cWe're working on legislation and they are actually undoing a lot of our work because they are validating a narrative that we have been trying so desperately to refute,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is not okay for a doctor to violate the patient's trust in this capacity. At this point in time there's no accountability. There's no civil cause of action. There's no criminal cause action. So now we're further marginalized, because there's literally nothing in place by the letter of the law to protect people who are using artificial reproductive technologies.\u201d\n\nAfter we speak, Wiley sends me more examples of Almost Family\u2019s marketing blitz that have enraged her. One is a throw pillow that says, printed in a twee font, \u201cHome is where your 100+ half siblings live.\u201d Another is a video interview posted on the show\u2019s Facebook page with a woman who was conceived through a sperm donor recounting how much fun it\u2019s been connecting with the more than 60 half siblings fathered through the same donor.\n\nIt\u2019s heartwarming, sure. But it\u2019s also noteworthy that the woman interviewed was not conceived through a doctor\u2019s fraud, as the characters in the show are and as Wiley, Ballard, Tucker, Hanes, and so many others are.\n\n\u201cAlmost Family. \u2018Family\u2019 isn\u2019t a word I would use to describe the deceit and disgust I feel about my conception story,\u201d Wiley says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like family every time a new half sibling pops up and I have to be the one to turn their world upside down with the truth, not knowing how they will receive the traumatic turn of events as I expose myself to more hurt and more rejection from my \u2018almost family.\u2019 It\u2019s that many more people who have been hurt by a man that will receive no measurable accountability.\u201d", "description": "Children who discovered as adults that their mothers were secretly inseminated with their fertility doctors\u2019 sperm react with rage and disgust to Fox\u2019s new series \u201cAlmost Family.\u201d", "authors": ["Kevin Fallon", "Senior Entertainment Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1570589134/191008-fallon-almost-family-tease_w1qkc9", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
