But beginning in 2017, the number of uninsured children began to rise.\n\nThe report specifically cited the confusion surrounding the administration\u2019s failed attempt to repeal ObamaCare, the successful elimination of the law\u2019s individual mandate, and a months-long delay in funding the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP).\n\nIn addition, the report cited the Trump administration\u2019s decision to dramatically cut ObamaCare outreach and enrollment grants, while also shortening the open enrollment period.\n\n\u201cAt a time when families need more help navigating the confusing health coverage landscape, fewer resources are available for ObamaCare outreach and enrollment efforts as a result of cuts made by the administration in 2017,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe report, which was based on an analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data, found seven states where the rate of uninsured rate for children increased most sharply. Texas has the largest proportion of uninsured children, and is home to more than one in five uninsured children in the U.S.\n\nThree-quarters of the children who lost coverage between 2016 and 2018 live in GOP-led states that have not expanded Medicaid. The uninsured rate for children in those states increased at three times the rate as children in expansion states.\n\nOnly one state showed improvement during this two-year time period, which the report said suggests \u201cthat even well-intentioned states are hard pressed to overcome a negative national climate which is reducing children\u2019s enrollment in public coverage programs.\u201d\n\nThe majority of uninsured children are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP but are not currently enrolled.\n\n\u201cThe decline in health coverage occurred at a time when children should have been gaining coverage in the private market and is a red flag for policymakers, as even more children would likely lose coverage in an economic downturn,\u201d said Joan Alker, executive director of the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families.\n\nResearchers also pointed to President Trump Donald John TrumpJudge schedules hearing for ex-Trump aide who refused to appear in inquiry READ: Army officer to tell investigators he twice reported concerns over Trump's Ukraine dealings Murkowski, Collins say they won't co-sponsor Graham's impeachment resolution MORE's crackdown on immigration as a reason why the number of uninsured kids is rising.\n\nSeveral policies targeting immigrant communities, like the administration's \"public charge\" rule, are likely deterring parents from enrolling their eligible children in Medicaid or CHIP, despite the fact that most of these children are U.S. citizens.", "description": "The number of uninsured children in the U.S.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/blogs/schoolkids.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
