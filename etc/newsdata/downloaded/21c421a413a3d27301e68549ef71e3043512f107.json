Pictured, one of the Linear B tablets which was discovered by Arthur Evans, the archaeologist who first unearthed Knossos\n\nThe ancient Minoans of Crete may not have been wiped out by a natural disaster, but instead were subsumed by foreign cultural influences, an archaeologist has said. Pictured, the ruins of the palace of Knossos, on Crete, as seen in the present-day\n\nExperts once thought that the eruption of a volcano named Thera, on what is now the holiday island of Santorini, in around 1642\u20131540 BC had destroyed the Minoans.\n\nThis eruption has been rivalled in modern times only by the colossal explosion of Krakatoa in 1883.\n\nIt was thought to have triggered a tsunami that travelled south to Crete, destroying the Minoan port at the Bronze Age city of Knossos.\n\nEvidence of destruction dating to around the time of the eruption has been found in various settlements on Crete \u2014 and was originally connected to the Thera disaster.\n\nHowever, the translation of unusual script on a set of tablets \u2014 the language was dubbed Linear B \u2014 on Minoan-era tablets helped overturn the end-by-tsunami theory.\n\nIt took decades, but Linear B was identified as a form of ancient Greek.\n\nThis gave evidence that the Mycenaean civilisation from the mainland had heavily changed, but continued, the Minoan culture.\n\n'Thera\u2019s eruption did not directly affect Knossos,' archaeologist Colin Macdonald of the British School in Athens \u2014 who has been excavating Minoan-era remains on Crete, pictured, for 30 years \u2014 told Haaretz\n\nThe debris previously thought to have come from a natural disaster may actualy have been from battle between the Minoans and the Mycenaeans.\n\nThe Minoan civilisation \u2014 given this name retrospectively in a nod to their legendary King Minos, of Minotaur fame \u2014 was notable for its elaborate architecture.\n\nAmong these buildings was the stunning multi-level palace at Knossos, the heart of the Minoan's sea-based empire.\n\nHowever, it appears that Knossos persisted as an ancient settlement for some time after the eruption of Thera.\n\n'Thera\u2019s eruption did not directly affect Knossos,' archaeologist Colin Macdonald of the British School in Athens \u2014 who has been excavating Minoan-era remains on Crete for 30 years \u2014 told Haaretz.\n\n'No volcanic-induced earthquake or tsunami struck the palace which, in any case, is 100 meters above sea level.'\n\nInstead, researchers believe that the Minoan and Mycenaean civilisations gradually merged, with the latter culture becoming dominant \u2014 leading to the shift in the language and writing system used in the ancient city.\n\nAccording to Macdonald, it is possible that the eruption weakened the Minoan hold on the region \u2014 likely thanks to the loss of the port on Thera which had aligned itself with the authorities at Knossos.\n\nThis may have allowed the Mycenaeans to establish their own trading hubs to fill the void \u2014 like the large settlement at Phylakopi, on the island of Milos \u2014 and set their flavour of the Greek language as the common tongue of the Aegean economy.\n\nThe debris previously identified as coming from a natural disaster was likely instead the result of Minoan resistance to the influence of the Mycenaeans.

Pictured, the reception courtyard at the royal palace of Knossos\n\nIn addition, Macdonald notes, the regional practice of stonemasons leaving their marks on their work disappeared from the buildings at Knossos at this time \u2014 and burial practices also appear to have changed.\n\nThe Mycenaeans may even have captured the island of Crete for themselves.\n\nEither way, as the Minoan administration changed under the foreign influence, Macdonald speculated, perhaps even the local religion collapsed in response.\n\n'This could well have manifested itself in local uprisings and the burning of administrative and elite buildings,' he added.", "description": "The translation in 1952 of unusual script - dubbed Linear B - on Minoan-era tablets has overturned the end-by-tsunami theory in favour of a shift to the imported culture of mainland Greece.", "authors": ["Ian Randall", "Sam Blanchard For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/17/15/19839634-0-image-a-51_1571322125682.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
