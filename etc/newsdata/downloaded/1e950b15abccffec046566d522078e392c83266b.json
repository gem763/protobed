The tariffs started slowly. In the first few months of the war, President Donald Trump placed tariffs on less than 3% of Chinese imports, but by December 15 the president plans to hit nearly everything the U.S. imports from China.\n\nDespite rising tensions in recent months, Trump has said he wants a trade deal before his reelection bid in 2020. He has also insinuated that Beijing may be holding out for a Democratic candidate. In a speech in Baltimore Thursday night, the president mocked Democratic presidential candidate and former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden.\n\n\"Whoa boy. He\u2019s a furious kind of a guy. Great guy. [Chinese President Xi Jinping is] dying to see...he wants Sleepy Joe,\u201d Trump said, referring to Biden. \u201cCould you imagine those two guys in a room...\u201d\n\nBut despite Trump\u2019s comments, former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci thinks China is actually hoping for a Trump win in the 2020 presidential.\n\n\u201cYou have an orange rag doll, Donald J. Trump, and you have a Doberman pinscher, China, shaking the rag doll,\u201d Scaramucci said on Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move. \u201cAnd then what they're going to do in a couple months, they're going to throw that rag doll into the corner, and they're going to cut a deal with him because they absolutely want Trump to be reelected.\u201d\n\nSo why does China want Trump to remain president of the U.S.? Trump is damaging the U.S. and undermining the country\u2019s global standing, according to Scaramucci.\n\nFormer White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci poses for a photograph after an interview with the Associated Press in Jerusalem, Monday, Nov. 20, 2017. (AP Photo/Ariel Schalit) More\n\nTrump is \u2018burying the U.S.\u2019\n\nTrump has repeatedly said China wants a deal with the U.S. On Thursday, he said he preferred a to get a \u201cwhole deal\u201d with China but did not rule out the possibility of an interim deal.\n\nThe trade tensions between the two countries have rocked global markets. In early August, stocks plunged after Trump announced \u2014 through a series of tweets\u2014 that he planned to place an additional 10% tariffs on $300 billion worth of imports from China. The word \u201ctariff\u201d has been mentioned in Trump\u2019s tweets 165 times across 95 days, according to Barron\u2019s, and on those days the S&P 500 fell by an average of 0.05%.\n\nEarlier this month, Trump labeled China \u201cthe enemy\u201d and just a few days later he claimed China officials had called him in a pursuit of a trade deal, but China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied any calls.\n\n\u201cHe is disrupting the global alliance and bringing down the international trading system. And he is hurting our hard and soft power and our standing,\u201d Scaramucci said. \u201cLiterally, the way he acts is a full-blown embarrassment on the global stage. He\u2019s stumbling and bumbling along. The Chinese is laughing. This guy's burying the U.S.\u201d\n\nValentina Caval is a producer for Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move.\n\n\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\n\n\nFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn, YouTube, and reddit.", "description": "Former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci explains why China wants Trump to be reelected president in 2020.", "authors": ["Valentina Caval"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VnHF8kYZ88qVogffuumhfQ--~B/aD0zMDM4O3c9NDU1NztzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-09/8c77f3c0-d62b-11e9-afff-84146ba38f2a", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
