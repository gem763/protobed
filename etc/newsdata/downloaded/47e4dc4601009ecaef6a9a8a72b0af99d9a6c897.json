We're all broken-hearted over it. When we found out, we were just like 'what do we do now?'\n\n\"It's a rare genetic disorder so it's not like there's a cure around the corner. We're all absolutely devastated.\n\n\"It's the not knowing [what age his sight will go]. He could get to 12 or 13 and not be able to see at all.\"\n\nSteph said Jack, who already can't see in when it's dark, has been \"brilliant\" since finding out about his future.\n\nShe said: \"He just takes it in his stride. We say to him things like 'can you see that Jack?' and he'll say 'yeah I can'. He can see it in his own way.\n\n\"He doesn't moan and he doesn't complain. He's amazing, he's an amazing little boy.\"\n\nSteph said Jack is keen wrestling fan, as well as supporting Everton, and likes Harry Potter.\n\n(Image: xxxxxxxxx WS)\n\nThe family said the memories they intend to make for the schoolboy will be focused on \"what he wants to do\", but said they would love to spend quality family time together.\n\nSteph said: \"You take things for granted and don't think of doing them, but even if we went to Wales for the weekend and climbed up a mountain, the view would be amazing.\n\n\"Just things like that. He's always wanted to go to Scotland, for some reason, and it's like [since the diagnosis] we'll do that now.\"\n\nThe family have set up a GoFundMe page to create as many memories as they can.\n\nJack's auntie, Claire wrote: \"Jack's parents have been told that he is likely to have lost all his vision by his teenage years, which has completely devastated us all.\n\n\"Jack meanwhile is still the happy go lucky gentle boy that we all love. We now want to create as many special memories as we can before he can no longer see.\"", "description": "Jack Phillips, eight, said he would love to visit parts of rural Scotland so he can envision the countryside for the rest of his life", "authors": ["Olivia Tobin", "Image", "Xxxxxxxxx Ws"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20646546.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Boy-who-will-go-blind-in-five-years-time-wants-to-make-memories-he-can-pictureThe-heartbroken-fami.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
