It is not just about the squad of United. Players now have a sense of the individual,' he added in an interview with The Athletic.", "description": "Matip was injured in Liverpool's 1-0 victory over Sheffield United on September 28 and missed their 4-3 Champions League win over Salzburg and the 2-1 Premier League win over Leicester.", "authors": ["Reuters Reporter"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/15/16/19749098-0-image-a-55_1571155097931.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
