Federation president Gustavo Tapia told Reuters that 80% of its members had agreed to partake in the strike.\n\nUnion leaders said workers had walked off the job at BHP\u2019s Spence, shutting down the mine. BHP did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment.\n\nAnglo American said its flagship Los Bronces mine, just outside Santiago, had been forced to \u201cadjust operations\u201d given the unrest and disruptions to the country\u00b4s transport networks, but said the mine continued to operate normally.\n\nChile\u2019s Codelco, the world\u2019s top copper miner, had resumed normal operations Thursday after an umbrella group representing all its unions struck a deal with government officials to end a day-long walk-off on Wednesday.\n\nUnionized workers at Codelco\u2019s Chuquicamata nonetheless said in a statement that they would continue to support the protests.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our decision as a union to make clear that we will continue to be on the side of the people and workers,\u201d the mine\u2019s union #3 said in a statement.\n\nCopper producer Antofagasta Plc said on Wednesday protests in Chile could cut its production by about 5,000 tonnes, equivalent to less than 3% of third quarter output, due to delays in supplies and travel disruptions for workers.\n\nTeck told Reuters on Wednesday in a statement that \u201cthere had been no material impact to Teck\u00b4s operations in Chile due to recent protests.\u201d", "description": "Copper mining companies in Chile, the world's top producer of the red metal, said nationwide riots had mostly spared production but continued to impact operations as problems persisted with port facilities, public transportation and supply chains.", "authors": ["Fabian Cambero", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
