They tested the antibodies in mice infected with human, avian and swine flu strains \u2014 most of them lethal to the laboratory rodents \u2014 and found the antibodies prevented death and weight loss.\n\n\u201cThey showed remarkable activity and remarkable potency in protecting mice from the challenges with lethal influenza virus infections,\u201d Mr. Ellebedy said, adding that the researchers learned about another point of weakness in the flu virus that they can target.\n\nDr. William Schaffner, medical director for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases and who was not involved in the study, called the researchers\u2019 work another attempt to develop a \u201cuniversal flu vaccine\u201d that would cover a wide variety of viral strains.\n\n\u201cThe main reason we have to vaccinate ourselves annually is because the virus itself mutates and changes, and it changes principally the hemagglutinin [a protein on the surface of the virus],\u201d Dr. Schaffner said. \u201cThe neuraminidase, which is the subject of this investigation, is more stable. And if we could develop a vaccine that could work effectively against the neuraminidase, that would cover many, many more strains.\u201d\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said many researchers study hemagglutinin, but there are other proteins on the flu virus that do not get as much attention, including neuraminidase.\n\n\u201cNow, for the first time, we have some pretty solid proof that antibodies against neuraminidase can really be very broadly protective against multiple, diverse strains of influenza,\u201d Dr. Fauci said. \u201cIt [has] now provided for us yet another credible target to which direct our efforts to developing an antibody.\u201d\n\nThe stem of the hemagglutinin doesn\u2019t mutate that much, but the head of the protein does. A standard strategy to develop better flu vaccines is to induce a response from the stem of the hemagglutinin.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate the flu has caused between 9.3 million and 49 million illnesses, between 140,000 and 960,000 hospitalizations, and between 12,000 and 79,000 deaths each year since 2010.\n\nLast season, there were between 37 million to 42.9 million illnesses, 531,000 to 647,000 hospitalizations and 36,400 to 61,200 deaths in the U.S.\n\nHealth professionals recommend everyone 6 months old and older get vaccinated before the end of the month.\n\nDr. Fauci said he thinks many people don\u2019t take the flu seriously since it happens every year and because people often confuse minor respiratory symptoms as the flu when it\u2019s not.\n\nHe stressed that while many are able to recover from the flu on their own, there are others such as infants, the elderly, pregnant women and people with underlying medical conditions who are likely to develop complications.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
