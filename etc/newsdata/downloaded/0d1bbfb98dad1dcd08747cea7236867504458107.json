Growing up in New York City, her parents would tell her it was time for bed and she would stall by saying, \u201cWait a minute, because The Late Lake Show is starting now!\u201d\n\nOver the years, this passion for performance led to drama school in London and eventually a chance to audition for roles in Los Angeles, where a manager told her to \u201cput on a push-up bra and go audition for Felicity.\u201d She got a callback, but didn\u2019t land the gig, instead making her TV debut in 2002 episode of ER. Her big moment came when she had to vomit on screen at the end of a long tracking shot through the hospital.\n\nBell played a lot of \u201cwacky best friends\u201d and other bit parts on television dramas like The Practice and Boston Legal, but didn\u2019t really find her comedic voice until her friend Rob Corddry cast her as Dr. Cat Black in the cult hit Children\u2019s Hospital on Adult Swim. It was on that show that she got some of her earliest directing experience, which led to her feature directorial debut In a World\u2026 in 2013, a wickedly smart rom-com that focused on sexism in the voiceover industry.\n\nSix years later, Bell says she has witnessed the entertainment industry change \u201ca thousand percent\u201d when it comes to how women are treated in Hollywood, mainly due to the #MeToo movement and the greater awareness for gender parity that has come with it. For one, she says it\u2019s no longer expected that every actress on TV needs to be drop-dead gorgeous. \u201cYou can be real,\u201d she tells me on this week\u2019s episode of The Last Laugh podcast, \u201cyou should look like a person.\u201d\n\nThis new frontier is part of what made Bell want to return to television\u2014after spending some time in the trenches of the indie film world\u2014with ABC\u2019s Bless This Mess, a big ol\u2019 network sitcom she created with New Girl\u2019s Liz Meriweather and co-stars in with Dax Shepard.\n\nIn this episode, we talk about how Bell got to where she is today, where she wants to go next and a lot more\u2014including the time she tried and ultimately failed to improvise with Meryl Streep while filming It\u2019s Complicated.\n\nHighlights from our conversation are below and you can listen to the whole thing right now by subscribing to The Last Laugh on Apple Podcasts, the Himalaya app or wherever you listen to podcasts.\n\nWhy she wanted to make \u2018Bless This Mess\u2019 for network TV\n\n\u201cI was interested in network television because it was the antithesis of what I had been doing. When you make indie movies, you have such a small audience, which is not bad, it was just like, I\u2019ve done that twice and I would love to bring my own sensibility to a larger audience and see how that fares and see if it\u2019s possible. It\u2019s not like network comedy can only be a certain type of comedy. I wanted to add my visual and tonal stamp on it. I say almost every day to my writers\u2019 room that it\u2019s important, among this silliness, that at the core of everything we have to talk about real things. It\u2019s an opportunity to be real and cloak true, raw emotion and some cultural politics in a show that has some hijinks and some shenanigans and allows us to reach a broader audience with that kind of cultural conversation.\u201d\n\nHow the industry has changed since she started acting\n\n\u201cMy mom was like, if you\u2019re going to be an actor, you have to study in England. And I was like, goddammit, can\u2019t I just go out to L.A. and just get a push-up bra and audition for Felicity? I thought that was a good way to start and then you could get to a place where people paid attention to you and then you could do whatever you want. But it was a different time. Then I did start to get into the drama school thing of like, you\u2019re a blank canvas, you wear all black and you neutralize your voice. So I remember going to auditions in all black, no makeup, blank canvas and that does not work in L.A. For TV, there was this concept that everybody had to be beautiful all the time. And I don\u2019t think TV is like that anymore. You can be real, you should look like a person. And certainly when I cast as a director, I am very turned off when people come in looking like a model, male or female.\u201d\n\nHow embracing comedy transformed her career\n\n\u201cI ended up doing a lot of drama stuff, because I was conservatory-trained. I couldn\u2019t get a comedy audition. And then I got Miss Match, which was one of my first comedy gigs. It was a Darren Star show and I played the brunette best friend to Alicia Silverstone and I was super slutty and the butt of most jokes. That was the first time that day in, day out, my job was to be comedic. Alicia was the straight woman and I got to be the funny best friend. There were indie movies where I would audition for \u2018the girl\u2019 and I was just gravitating towards the wacky best friend. I was like, can I just audition for that? I want to see a movie about the wacky best friend. And then What Happens in Vegas was a really big turn for me, I think, because I met a lot of my best friends there\u2014Rob Corddry, Cameron Diaz\u2014that was a huge deal. It was a big movie for me and it was like, \u2018Hey, this is a comedy person!\u2019 And then Corddry asked me to do Children\u2019s Hospital and it was off the races. I felt really lucky to be asked to get into that world and it genuinely made me happy. And especially with Children\u2019s Hospital, which is so absurdist, there\u2019s no logic and that was really satisfying. Dramas are so logical\u2014you can\u2019t do this and you can\u2019t say that\u2014and we could do anything.\u201d\n\nOn trying to improvise with Meryl Streep on the set of \u2018It\u2019s Complicated\u2019\n\n\u201cMy first scene out of the gate in that movie is the one where Meryl and Steve [Martin] are high on marijuana and there\u2019s me and Alec [Baldwin] and I\u2019m supposed to exude this high status as Agnes and look down my nose at Meryl fuckin\u2019 Streep! And look, I couldn\u2019t be a bigger superfan. Not only is she the most incredible, accomplished actress, but she\u2019s also a phenomenal human and makes the world a better place. So I got there and I knew my lines, but in the audition, Nancy [Meyers] had me improvise quite a lot. So I was in rehearsal with Meryl and I was improvising because I really thought that\u2019s what I was meant to do. And the script supervisor came over to me and was like, \u2018Hey, so I just want to show you the lines here.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Oh, I was just improvising a little, should I not do that?\u2019 And she was like, \u2018No, no, no, we don\u2019t do that here.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Oh, well Meryl was just saying some stuff and I was saying stuff back.\u2019 And she was like, \u2018Meryl was improvising? I have to go tell her to get back on book.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018No! I am not tattling on Meryl!\u2019\u201d\n\nNext week on The Last Laugh podcast: Creator and star of Big Mouth on Netflix, Nick Kroll.", "description": "On this week\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Last Laugh,\u201d the writer, director, and star of \u201cIn a World\u2026\u201d and \u201cBless This Mess\u201d, talks about how she took control of her career.", "authors": ["Matt Wilstein", "Senior Writer"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_675,w_1200,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1571112368/191014-Wilstein-Last-Laugh-Lake-Bell-tease_obwihp", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
