Suhail Shaheen, a Taliban spokesman, confirmed on Saturday that the consultations had taken place.\n\nNeither Mr. Shaheen nor the Russian government disclosed the agenda of the discussions. The Russian Foreign Ministry said Taliban officials confirmed their interest in continued talks with Washington. During the discussions, Mr. Kabulov also stressed the importance of resuming the U.S.-Taliban talks, Russia\u2019s Interfax news agency said.\n\nThe meeting in Moscow follow a tumultuous week in the Afghan peace process and efforts to reach a negotiated settlement of the nearly 18-year war\u2014as well as a turbulent spell for Washington\u2019s foreign-policy establishment.\n\nIn a tweet last Saturday, President Trump canceled a secret meeting with Afghan and Taliban officials at Camp David and killed a proposed U.S.-Taliban troop-withdrawal deal. Mr. Trump said a suicide bombing in eastern Kabul three days earlier, which left a U.S. Army sergeant and 11 others dead, had prompted him to act.\n\nThe next day, President Trump told reporters the U.S.-Taliban talks were \u201cdead,\u201d halting the most advanced effort yet to negotiate an end to the conflict.\n\nYet the chief U.S. envoy to the peace process, Zalmay Khalilzad, remains on the job, while the administration official who had been most at odds with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo over any dealings with the Taliban\u2014national security adviser John Bolton \u2014was dismissed by the president this past week.\n\nEarlier this week, Mr. Shaheen said Taliban negotiators were still in contact with their American counterparts and wanted to continue the talks.\n\nThe Afghan government had no immediate comment on the Moscow meeting. It has welcomed Mr. Trump\u2019s cancellation of the U.S.-Taliban talks and what it now views as an opportunity to take control of the peace process.\n\nThe Taliban have refused to hold direct talks with any Kabul administration, viewing it as an illegitimate offspring of the U.S.-led invasion that forced them from power in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t known whether Taliban officials hoped to exploit the U.S.-Russian rivalry to spur Washington to resume negotiations or urged Russia to prevail on the U.S. to get the talks back on track. Moscow and Washington have generally seen eye-to-eye over the goal of ending the war in Afghanistan.\n\nIn choosing Moscow for their first foray abroad since Mr. Trump declared the U.S.-Taliban talks over, the insurgent group\u2019s negotiators returned to the venue of some of their most notable diplomatic successes.\n\nIn the past 10 months, Taliban officials have participated in three high-level, government-supported discussions in Moscow, most notably in February, when they held talks with former Afghan President Hamid Karzai and 42 other prominent Afghan political figures. The Afghan government didn\u2019t participate, and President Ashraf Ghani described the meeting as \u201cnothing more than a fantasy.\u201d\n\nMoscow and Washington are at loggerheads on a number of fronts. In the case of Afghanistan, the U.S. military has accused Russia of aiding the Taliban to counter what both Washington and Moscow view as the expanding danger posed by the local affiliate of Islamic State.\n\nStill, the U.S. and Russia have agreed on the need to end the Afghan war while preventing radical jihadist militant groups, including Islamic State, from using Afghanistan as an operating base to carry out terrorist attacks abroad.\n\nDuring his yearlong negotiations with the Taliban in the Gulf state of Qatar, Mr. Khalilzad, the U.S. envoy, traveled to Moscow for talks with Russian officials at least twice and met Mr. Kabulov in Washington and Beijing.\n\nUnderscoring their role in spurring the Taliban to reach a deal, and their possible roles as guarantors in its implementation, Moscow and Beijing were to send senior officials to a ceremony where the proposed accord was to be signed.\n\nWith the collapse of U.S.-Taliban negotiations, U.S. and other Western officials now expect an escalation of clashes in Afghanistan, especially in advance of presidential elections set for Sept. 28.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate increased violence,\u201d the Associated Press quoted the top U.S. general for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Air Force Gen. Tod Wolters, as saying Friday in Slovenia\u2019s capital, Ljubljana.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Trump said the U.S. had already increased its military operations. \u201cWe\u2019ve hit the Taliban harder in the last four days than they\u2019ve been hit in over 10 years.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. currently has about 14,500 military personnel in Afghanistan, about half of whom provide training to the Afghan security forces, along with roughly 8,600 other foreign forces, mostly from NATO. The rest of the U.S. forces carry out counterterrorism missions and support air operations.\n\nWrite to Craig Nelson at craig.nelson@wsj.com and Thomas Grove at thomas.grove@wsj.com", "description": "Taliban representatives have held talks with Russian officials in an apparent effort to restart discussions with the U.S., days after President Trump declared negotiations with the insurgent group dead.", "authors": ["Craig Nelson In Kabul", "Afghanistan", "Thomas Grove In Moscow", "Craig Nelson", "Thomas Grove", "Craig.Nelson Wsj.Com", "Thomas.Grove Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107230/social", "published_at": "2019-09-14"}
