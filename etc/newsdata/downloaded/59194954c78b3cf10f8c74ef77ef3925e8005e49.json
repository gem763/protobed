It beat out recent horror successes like last year's \"Halloween\" and this year's \"Us,\" which both earned $76 million and $71 million in their debuts, respectively.\n\nThe movie grossed $94 million from 75 foreign markets, which is the biggest international premiere for a horror movie ever. The first \"It\" grossed $62 million internationally during its first weekend in theaters. \"Chapter Two's\" global total so far is $185 million.\n\n\"It: Chapter Two\" has received less favorable reviews than the first movie, with a 64% critic score on Rotten Tomatoes compared to the first movie's 86% critic score.\n\nBut audiences appear to enjoy the movie more than critics, as it has an 80% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes based on over 12,000 user ratings (the first movie has an 84% audience score). \"It: Chapter Two\" also has a respectable B+ grade on Cinemascore, which surveys audience sentiment on a movie's opening night.\n\nDergarabedian said the movie should have \"long-term playability\" over the course of its theatrical run. \"It\" ultimately earned $700 million worldwide and \"Chapter Two\" is already putting up stronger numbers internationally.\n\n\"The final global gross is what will determine 'It Chapter Two's' ultimate box office status,\" Dergarabedian said.", "description": "\"It: Chapter Two\" earned $91 million in the US, less than the first movie's record opening.
