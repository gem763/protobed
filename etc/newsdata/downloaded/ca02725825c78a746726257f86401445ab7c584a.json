(Ashlee Rezin Garcia/Chicago Sun-Times/AP)\n\nChicago teachers have voted to strike Oct. 17 if contentious contract negotiations with city officials are not resolved, affecting some 300,000 public school students in the nation\u2019s third-largest district.\n\nSchool support staff and park district workers \u2014 who are represented by a different union \u2014 also set Oct. 17 as the day to strike if their contract talks are not resolved, meaning that unionized teachers could be striking at the classroom at the same time public parks could be closed. The city\u2019s contract with the Chicago Teachers Union expired in June.\n\nIf Chicago teachers walk off the job, it would be the latest strike by educators in a string of job actions that began in early 2018 in states controlled by Republicans and Democrats. This year, teachers went on strike in Los Angeles, Denver, Oakland and Sacramento. Teachers have been seeking not only higher pay but more resources for cash-strapped schools.\n\nChicago teachers voted overwhelmingly Wednesday to strike in two weeks if their demands \u2014 which include higher pay and benefits, fully staffed schools, smaller class sizes \u2014 are not met by Mayor Lori Lightfoot\u2019s administration. Some classes exceed 40 students, the union said, and many schools do not have sufficient staff, including nurses, social workers and librarians.\n\nOther union demands involve social justice issues, including affordable housing for teachers, students and parents; an expansion of community schools that provide services for students and their families (including counseling, medical and dental care, food support); and an extension of the city\u2019s moratorium on charter schools, which are publicly funded but privately operated.\n\nLightfoot and Chicago Public Schools Chief Executive Officer Janice K. Jackson said that even though they are doing \u201ceverything in our power to reach a fair deal\u201d to avoid a strike, they are making preparations for one, and they pledged to keep schools open during school hours \u201cto ensure students have a safe and welcoming place to spend the way and warm meals to eat.\u201d\n\nThe Chicago Teachers Union, which represents some 35,000 teachers, says city officials have rejected many of the union\u2019s positions, and union leaders derided a contract negotiation website that Lightfoot unveiled Monday with details of the administration\u2019s proposals.\n\n\u201cThis new website does not replace open bargaining, which we\u2019d still like to see,\u201d union president Jesse Sharkey said in an email. \u201cThose who are most impacted \u2014 including more than 25,000 teachers, paraprofessionals and clinicians and the families they serve \u2014 deserve a seat at the table, and livestreaming bargaining would be a step towards that.\u201d\n\nIf the teachers strike, it would be the third walkout in Chicago since 1987, when the union won pay raises, small class sizes and other concessions during a strike that lasted three weeks. Chicago teachers went out on strike again in 2012 with strong community support, seeking higher wages, fair teacher assessment and job security.", "description": "Here's what the teachers would strike over.", "authors": ["Valerie Strauss", "Reporter Covering Education", "Foreign Affairs", "October At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/yVHYkH682CzNOW---5b1XInFaZc=/1484x0/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/WJ2ILUHE2AI6TMFGHUBXEG4F54.jpg"}
