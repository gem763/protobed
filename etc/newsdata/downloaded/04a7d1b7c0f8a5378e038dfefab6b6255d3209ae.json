Both claim it in full but rule it in part, and the countries have twice gone to war over the territory. India revoked the special constitutional status of its portion of Kashmir in August, angering Pakistan.\n\nThe government wants to send a strong signal of its displeasure to Malaysian authorities, the sources said.\n\nIndia, the world's biggest importer of edible oils, is planning to substitute Malaysian palm oil with supplies of edible oils from countries such as Indonesia, Argentina and Ukraine, the sources said.\n\nPalm oil accounts for nearly two-thirds of India's total edible oil imports. India buys more than nine million tonnes of palm oil annually, mainly from Indonesia and Malaysia.\n\nIn the first nine months of 2019, India was the biggest buyer of Malaysian palm oil, purchasing 3.9 million tonnes, according to data compiled by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board.\n\nA spokeswoman for India's commerce ministry said the ministry could not comment on things that were under consideration.\n\nAlternative sellers\n\nMalaysia's prime minister on Friday said he had not received \"anything official\" from India, after Reuters first reported that India was considering restricting imports of Malaysian palm oil and other products.\n\nThe news prompted Malaysian palm oil futures to snap five days of gains and end lower on Friday evening.\n\nThe benchmark palm oil contract for December delivery on the Bursa Malaysia Derivatives Exchange - which had earlier been trading up on the day - fell 0.9 percent to close at 2,185 ringgit ($522.23) per tonne.\n\nA Mumbai-based refiner said it would not create a shortage of edible oils in India if buyers there stopped importing palm oil from Malaysia.\n\n\"Indonesia is eager to sell more and more palm oil to India,\" the refiner said, adding that India could also increase imports of soya bean oil from Argentina and sunflower oil from Ukraine to offset any drop in Malaysian palm oil shipments.\n\nIndonesia wants New Delhi to increase palm oil purchases and wants to buy sugar from India in exchange.\n\nHigher Indian imports had helped Malaysia reduce palm oil stockpiles in 2019, but stocks could rise again and prices could come under pressure if India curtails or stops imports, a Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm said.\n\nIndia's government is also planning some restrictions on imports from Turkey, one of the government sources said, as Ankara has issued repeated statements on Kashmir, an issue that India considers an internal matter.\n\nIn addition to tensions around Indian-administered Kashmir, there has also been friction between India and Malaysia over Islamic preacher Zakir Naik, whom Indian authorities want to be extradited from Malaysia.\n\nIn 2016, an Indian counterterrorism agency accused Naik of promoting hate speech.", "description": "Malaysian PM Mahathir Mohamad told UN last month that India had 'invaded and occupied' Jammu and Kashmir.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2019/10/11/d02787caa63f450bb4f5f0d2d93260e2_18.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
