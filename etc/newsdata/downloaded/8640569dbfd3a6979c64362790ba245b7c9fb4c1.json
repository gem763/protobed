Under questioning from Republicans during last Friday\u2019s impeachment inquiry interview with Atkinson, the inspector general revealed that the whistleblower\u2019s possible bias was not that he was simply a registered Democrat. It was that he had a significant tie to one of the Democratic presidential candidates currently vying to challenge President Trump in next year\u2019s election.\n\n\u201cThe IG said [the whistleblower] worked or had some type of professional relationship with one of the Democratic candidates,\u201d said one person with knowledge of what was said.\n\n\u201cThe IG said the whistleblower had a professional relationship with one of the 2020 candidates,\u201d said another person with knowledge of what was said.\n\n\u201cWhat [Atkinson] said was that the whistleblower self-disclosed that he was a registered Democrat and that he had a prior working relationship with a current 2020 Democratic presidential candidate,\u201d said a third person with knowledge of what was said.", "description": "", "authors": ["Byron York", "Washingtonexaminer.Com News Whistleblower-Had-Tie-To-Democratic-Candidate"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
