(AP) - A Catholic priest says \u201cfornication\u201d not pregnancy was the problem in the case of a teacher who alleges that she was fired from a Catholic school in Kansas City, Missouri, because she was pregnant and unmarried\n\nThe Kansas City Star reports the Rev. Joseph Cisetti testified Wednesday that he \u201cpraised\u201d the decision of former St. Therese School teacher Michelle Bolen not to have an abortion but told her she violated her contract. Cisetti said \u201csexual relations must take place exclusively in marriage.\u201d\n\nCisetti says he favored offering Bolen a contract, while the school\u2019s then-principal didn\u2019t. He says he was concerned about dismissing her because it might create an environment that would be conducive to abortion.\n\nBolen says administrators concocted non-pregnancy-related reasons to justify not renewing her contract in July 2015.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Kansas City Star, http://www.kcstar.com\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "A Catholic priest says \"fornication\" not pregnancy was the problem in the case of a teacher who alleges that she was fired from a Catholic school in Kansas City, Missouri, because she was pregnant and unmarried", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
