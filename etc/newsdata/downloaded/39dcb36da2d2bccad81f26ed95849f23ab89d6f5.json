Pete Sessions (R-TX) included huge ad buys that appear to have pushed the boundaries of laws restricting super PAC coordination with political campaigns, according to a Daily Beast review of federal campaign finance and television broadcasting records. And they could severely complicate the former congressman\u2019s attempt to win back office in 2020.\n\nThe expenditures made by America First Action came during the 2018 election cycle, during which Sessions was fighting desperately to hold on to his House seat in a race he would go on to lose to Democrat Colin Allred. The PAC, which has President Donald Trump\u2019s official imprimatur, has raised millions of dollars to fulfill that task. And during that election season, $325,000 of that came from a company called Global Energy Producers LLC, a firm run by Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman.\n\nThe Soviet-born businessmen were, at the time of their donation to the PAC, helping Giuliani solicit dirt on President Donald Trump\u2019s political opponents from officials in Ukraine. That work, which is now at the center of an impeachment inquiry against the president, included trying to get the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, removed from her post on grounds that she was badmouthing Trump.\n\nRudy\u2019s Ukraine Henchmen Made Big Donation to Pro-Trump PAC\n\nTrump allies have also alleged that Yovanovitch was blocking key corruption investigations in the country\u2014most importantly, for their purposes, a probe into the Ukrainian business activities of Hunter Biden, the youngest son of Democratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden. According to the Associated Press, the Giuliani clique continued pressed for Yovanovitch\u2019s removal early this year. She was recalled from her post in May.\n\nSessions\u2019 role in the saga began in the spring of 2018. On May 11, Parnas posted photos to Facebook showing him and a business associate, David Correia, posing with the then-congressman in the Capitol complex. On the very same day that Parnas posted the photos to Facebook, Sessions shot off a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo questioning the fitness of Yovanovitch.\n\n\u201cI have received notice from close companions that Ambassador Yovanovitch has spoken privately and repeatedly about her disdain for the current administration,\u201d he wrote in claims that mirrored allegations from Giuliani and his associates.\n\nSix days after the letter was sent, Global Energy Producers made its donation to American First. The following month, Parnas and Fruman each donated the legal maximum to Sessions\u2019 campaign.\n\nSessions\u2019 campaign did not respond to a request for comment on this story. But the former congressman has denied that he pressed for Yovanovitch\u2019s removal at the behest of Giuliani, Parnas, or anyone else.\n\n\u201cI do know both these gentlemen,\u201d Sessions told BuzzFeed News and the Overseas Crime and Corruption Reporting Project in response to a joint investigation into Giuliani, Parnas, and Fruman. \u201cThey are Republicans. They are people who have an interest in foreign affairs. They have a strong interest in America not backing away from Ukraine.\u201d\n\nLawyer Claims Congress Is \u2018Harassing\u2019 Rudy Giuliani\u2019s Allies\u2014by Asking Them for Ukraine Documents\n\nAmerica First spokesperson Kelly Sadler said there was no understanding when GEP donated to the group that it would be supporting Sessions\u2019 candidacy, or that the money provided by Parnas\u2019 and Fruman\u2019s company would go towards a specific candidate.\n\nBut as investigations into what Trump and Giuliani were doing in Ukraine continue to ramp up, Sessions\u2019 opponents are demanding that he further explain the reasoning for his letter to Pompeo and whether he was rewarded financially for writing it.\n\n\u201cAt the moment, it seems to me he was playing the role of the useful idiot,\u201d his Democratic opponent this time around, businessman Rick Kennedy told The Daily Beast in an email. \u201cSessions and the incumbent Bill Flores represent everything that is wrong with our politics today. They\u2019re both ordained by big donors to sit in a seat in Congress to represent [the donors\u2019] interests. The donors move candidates around like pieces on a chess board to try to get their representatives in and their agendas through.\u201d", "description": "Drew Angerer/GettyA former member of Congress who pushed for political changes in Ukraine that aligned with Rudy Giuliani\u2019s investigative efforts there got millions of dollars in political support from a pro-Trump super PAC financed in part by Giuliani allies.The more than $3 million that the group,", "authors": ["Lachlan Markay"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dfYMQKKbsK8A6QfQEsDX.w--~B/aD02NTg7dz0xMTcwO3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/thedailybeast.com/d2d3a6b3b0c63ebe42de2784f8fa8837", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
