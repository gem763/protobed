I think Donald Trump \u2014 the logical thing is, Donald Trump spoke to somebody on the phone, he made a decision. It was a terrible decision, an immoral decision, and just bad for our foreign policy. I mean, who\u2019s going to fight ISIS, or I.S., if we\u2019re out? Who\u2019s going to guard the 10,000 prisoners who the Kurds \u2014 we\u2019ve been relying on the Kurds to guard? And the Kurds are going to turn to Russia or Iran or somebody. And so, it\u2019ll further strengthen Russia and Iran. So, it\u2019s a terrible decision. And then they get a little bad publicity, the administration does, and so then Mnuchin and various other people in the administration come out and say, oh, this is terrible. And so, it\u2019s not a foreign policy. It\u2019s a foreign policy by what Donald Trump\u2019s latest emotion is.\u201d\n\nFollow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett", "description": "On Friday's \"PBS NewsHour,\"\u00a0New York Times\u00a0columnist\u00a0David Brooks stated that President Trump's withdrawal of troops from northeast Syria is \"a terrible | Clips", "authors": ["Ian Hanchett"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/08/Brooks-810-Thumbnail.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
