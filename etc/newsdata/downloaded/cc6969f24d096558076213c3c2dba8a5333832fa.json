Even if they do, they say, China will be less inclined to make the concessions needed for a more difficult \"Phase 2\" of negotiations, choosing instead to live with substantial U.S. tariffs.\n\nIn 2009, Mohamed El-Erian of Pacific Investment Management used the phrase \"the new normal\" to describe a post-financial crisis landscape of low growth and low interest rates.\n\nA decade later, the \"new normal\" could be shaping up to be indefinite, hefty U.S tariffs on the majority of Chinese imports and substantial Chinese tariffs on most U.S. goods - a constant drag on the global economy and no fundamental change in Beijing's behaviour.\n\nFriday's truce \"just kicks the can down the road, which is good enough for both sides for now,\" said Scott Kennedy, a China trade expert at Center for Strategic and International Studies. Eventually, he said, \"the Trump administration may run out of road, and China Inc would not have been constrained.\"\n\nBefore the trade war started, the outlook for the global economy was sunny. In late 2017, Trump's administration was on the cusp of enacting sweeping tax cuts intended to turbocharge business investment and boost U.S. growth, Europe had shaken off its post-crisis doldrums and China was slowing but resilient.\n\n\"The global upswing in economic activity is strengthening,\" the International Monetary Fund wrote in October 2017, predicting that global growth would be 3.7% in 2018.\n\nSince the trade war started, China has set tariffs on more than $110 billion worth of U.S. goods, most of the total, except for commercial aircraft. The United States has active tariffs on about $375 billion of Chinese imports out of an annual total of about of $550 billion.\n\nThis month, the IMF's new managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, warned that trade conflicts had thrown the global economy into a \"synchronized slowdown,\" with announced tariffs lopping $700 billion off global economic output, largely through uncertainty that has stifled business investment and hurt markets.\n\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve has made similar forecasts, cutting 1%, or $850 billion off global GDP.\n\nEuro zone growth halved in the second quarter of this year as Germany\u2019s economy shrank and trade slowed, the European Union reported on Sept. 6.\n\nThe trade deal Trump announced, which indefinitely suspends tariffs that were supposed to kick in Oct. 15, would only lessen the \"trade drag\" on the global economy by 0.1% of GDP, Oxford Economics wrote in a note just after the White House press conference, headlined \"Itsy-Itsy-bitsy-teeny-weeny handshake deal with China.\"\n\n\"By leaving all the other tariffs in place, (the Trump administration) can say they're being tough on China, and they're not going to give in,\" said David Dollar, a China economics expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington.\n\n\"It seems like there's not much prospect for further negotiation and opening up in China.\"", "description": "Are U.S.-Chinese tariffs on almost everything the 'new normal'?", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/trkd-images/LYNXMPEF9D14D_L.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
