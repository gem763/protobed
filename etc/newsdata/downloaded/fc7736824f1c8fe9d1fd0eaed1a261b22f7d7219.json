The fallout continued this week after MyPayrollHR\u2019s third-party processor, Cachet Financial Services, announced it was no longer handling payroll transactions.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, Cachet sent out an email to clients this week stating: \u201cWith extremely heavy hearts, we regret to inform you that after Friday, October 25th, Cachet will no longer be able to process your ACH activity.\u201d\n\nPayroll companies associated with Cachet will now have to find another way to route funds to employees\u2019 bank accounts, as the company \u201cwill not handle any further wires, effective immediately.\u201d The company did not immediately respond to Gizmodo\u2019s request for inquiry.\n\nIn the last month, Cachet wrote off a $US26 ($38) million loss to make good on outstanding payroll deposits left in limbo after MyPayrollHR shuttered, a loss it\u2019s already suing the company to recoup according to a post on KrebsOnSecurity, a blog run by former Washington Post reporter Brian Krebs. With this week\u2019s move, it\u2019s likely Cachet will close down as well.\n\nMyPayrollHR\u2019s CEO Michael Mann was arrested in September and charged in a $US70 ($103) million bank fraud scheme, NBC News reported. He\u2019d allegedly been using the business to secure millions in bank loans and other lines of credit and reroute these funds to fake companies. When these fraud suspicions surfaced, Mann\u2019s banks froze his accounts, forcing MyPayrollHR out abruptly out of business and sending its nationwide clients into disarray. He faces up to 30 years in prison and a $US1 ($1) million fine.", "description": "When cloud payroll provider MyPayrollHR abruptly closed its doors amid fraud allegations last month, it sent its roughly 1,000 clients, many of them small businesses, into disarray as employees saw their paychecks disappear from their accounts.
