Neither Astros manager A.J. Hinch or Yankees manager Aaron Boone discussed a possible plan, leaving the strategies unsettled at the conclusion of the Yankees' 4-1 victory in Game 5 at Yankee Stadium, to get the series to 3-2 in favor of Houston.\n\nIt won't be Gerrit Cole, who has not lost a start since May 22, for the Astros. It won't be Luis Severino for the Yankees.\n\nInstead, the fate of Game 6 will be decided by the bullpens.\n\nBullpen vs. bullpen.\n\n\"It will be a bullpen game,\" said Hinch in his postgame press conference. \"We'll talk about it on the plane ride home. ... I'm unlikely to use Cole.\"\n\nBoone didn't mince his words either. \"Sevy's set for Game 7,\" he said. \"We'll just figure it out. ... But it will probably be a little bit of everyone.\"\n\nJ.A. Happ could be one of many Yankees pitchers used in Game 6. (Photo: Gregory Fisher, USA TODAY Sports)\n\nThere was no travel day in between Game 5 and 6. Rain postponed Wednesday's game, creating the potential of having to play four consecutive games without an off-day.\n\nThe Yankees bullpen has been taxed this postseason, throwing nearly as many innings as the starters (35 \u2154 vs. 37 \u2153) over eight games. No starter has gone more than seven innings in a postseason game. Meanwhile, the Astros\u2019 starters have gone at least seven innings in all but two of their 10 playoff games.\n\nSo, who is available for Game 6? The Yankees may turn to J.A. Happ to start on short rest before going to the bullpen. The Astros are expected to go with rookie Jose Urquidy. The Astros have a fully rested bullpen. Brad Peacock was the only reliever used in Game 5, and he only pitched one inning. The Yankees did not use relievers Adam Ottavino or Chad Green on Friday, and Zack Britton had a low pitch count. So it will be an all-hands-on-deck approach Saturday.\n\nThis is basically what Game 4 would have looked like if it was played on Wednesday.\n\nAll that is known for certain is that if there is a Game 7, Cole will be going to for the Astros while Severino starts for the Yankees.\n\nWhat does that say about the state of the game of baseball where it come down to a Game 6 of the ALCS and both teams are going with a bullpen game, rather than a traditional starter?\n\n\"I think it's both teams trying to get outs and trying to do it the best way we can,\" said Boone. \"We've had some \u2013 obviously a lot of guys go down this year and different people not available.\n\n\"We'll just do our best to piece it together.\"", "description": "The Astros and Yankees have not announced who will start Game 6 of the ALCS, but both said it will be a bullpen game.", "authors": ["Bob Nightengale", "Published A.M.
