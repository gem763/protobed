However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY's newsroom and any business incentives.\n\nTravelers swear by the perks; newcomers balk at the fees; airport lounges are filled with the users. Say what you will about The Platinum Card\u00ae from American Express but one thing is clear: it\u2019s one of the premier travel cards on the market \u2014 and it has been for years.\n\nThe American Express Platinum\u2019s chart-busting $550 annual fee is, in its unbelievable largess, the key to proverbial \u201ctravel perk city.\u201d It literally unlocks the door to travel experiences found almost nowhere else. Access to a growing network of luxe Centurion airport lounges and a direct line to the all-powerful American Express concierge desk are just two of these top-line perks.\n\nAnd there\u2019s one major attribute that makes this card unique amongst other travel credit cards. It\u2019s not, technically, a credit card at all: It does not extend you a loan that you can pay off\u2014at interest (and unwisely)\u2014over time. Instead, the Platinum is a \"charge\" card, which means you'll need to pay off you statement balance, in full, every month.\n\nLearn more about the Platinum Card from American Express\n\nEverything you need to know about the American Express Platinum\n\nThe Platinum Card from American Express (Photo: Reviewed / Naidin Concul-Ticas)\n\nAnnual Fee: $550\n\nPoints: 5x points on flights booked directly with the airline or through Amextravel and on prepaid hotels on amextravel.com\n\nForeign Transaction Fees: None\n\nPerks: Lounge access, airline credits, many, many more\n\nWelcome bonus: Variable, expect around 60k\n\nWho should get the Amex Platinum?\n\nYou\u2019ll need an excellent credit score (700 at minimum), and a strong history of responsible spending to qualify for the American Express Platinum card. This is more important than you might think.\n\nRemember, the Platinum is a \u201ccharge\u201d card. Functionally, that means you are responsible for paying off the sum of your balance every month. That\u2019s part of the cardholder agreement.\n\nWhat kind of points can you get with the Amex Platinum?\n\nPlatinum cardholders are almost always heavy travelers, and their favorite card\u2019s weighty\u2014and selective\u2014points bonuses reflect that fact alone. You earn 5 points for every dollar you spend booking flights directly with the airline or through American Express travel, 5 points for every dollar you spend booking prepaid hotels through amextravel.com, and 1 point for every dollar you spend on anything else. These valuable \u201cmembership rewards\u201d points can easily credit your next vacation.\n\nAmerican Express places some restrictions to your earnings availability. You\u2019ll need to book your hotel reservation through their online travel portal and your flights either direct with the airline or on Amex\u2019s site. Discount travel sites may show you better rates, but they will not get you the all-important 5-times-the-points that makes Platinum so valuable.\n\nYour best bet comes as a new cardholder, where American Express\u2019 60,000 point bonus is a trampoline into near-immediate points riches. You can get those Membership Rewards points after spending $5,000 in purchases over your first three months. A hefty sum to be sure, but a big reward from one of the most powerful travel cards on the market. They\u2019re easy to redeem via the Amex travel portal and will likely be more than enough for a round-trip airfare somewhere swanky.\n\nMore: Learn more about the Platinum Card from American Express\n\nWhat kind of perks can you get with the Amex Platinum?\n\nPrepare to rethink nearly everything you thought you knew about flying. The Amex Platinum has that kind of swagger\u2014I know from experience.\n\nLet\u2019s walk through my average Thanksgiving week excursion through my home airport, Philadelphia International, before Platinum: I catch a pricy Uber to the arrivals terminal early to compensate for expected security delays; the check-in agent sights, charges, and checks my \u201coversize carry-on\u201d for $50 unnecessary dollars; I slog through 30-45 wending minutes of TSA security harassment, only to repeat the process because I neglected to remove my laptop from my backpack; hunger forces a desperation buy from the greasy pretzel stand; I fail to find a seat by the gate; I order an overpriced bloody mary on the plane. By some miracle of miracles the airline never once lost my bag.\n\nI did this trip 100 times. I can\u2019t say I hated it; I thought the pain was necessary. It wasn\u2019t. Here\u2019s my same trip after platinum perks:\n\nI pay part of my rideshare charge with Platinum\u2019s $15-a-month Uber credit\n\nI check my bag and know that the the annual $200 \u201cairport incidentals\u201d credit will cover any associated fee\n\nI skip the regular security line, and keep my laptop hidden, by enrolling in TSA PreCheck with my PreCheck Credit\n\nI find a comfortable seat in Terminal A\u2019s Centurion Lounge, where I order a drink and peruse through the buffet free of charge.\n\nI put my 5x points towards booking my next flight\n\nThis is just the tip of the platinum perk iceberg. It is a must-have, especially for international travelers who can benefit from the Global Entry credit that makes passing through any American port-of-entry an absolute breeze.\n\nInternational travelers will make the most of Platinum\u2019s included Priority Pass membership. Nearly all major foreign airports have at least one Priority Pass-eligible lounge; there\u2019s 1,200 of them globally. I saw the best South East Asia had to offer during a recent month-long jetset around the region. Here\u2019s what I learned: Though some Priority Pass lounges are more luxurious than others, their free food, drink and seating area is always better than waiting by the gate. Amex Platinum also gets you through the door at Delta SkyClub \u2014 but only when you\u2019re flying Delta.\n\nTerrestrial travelers get a sizable slice of the perkage, too. Supercharged hotel stays (instant Hilton Honors Gold status and Marriott Bonvoy Gold Elite status) discount premier lodging ($550 in annual benefits at select Fine Hotels and Resorts) excellent car rental coverage and a 24/7 concierge are all great upsides. The concierge service can be particularly potent. I\u2019ve used this underappreciated booking wizard to get reservations at some of the world\u2019s finest restaurants on very short notice.\n\nSpecial things to know about the Amex Platinum:\n\nNew American Express Platinum cards are made of metal. Some people love that feature, now common among premier cards like Chase Sapphire and Apple\u2019s new card. But I hate this unnecessary \u201cperk\u201d with a passion \u2014 it makes wallets heavier and garners inquisitive looks from every cashier one meets. I still have the old plastic version and am dreading the day I\u2019ll need to turn it in.\n\nWhat drawbacks does the Amex Platinum have?\n\nRemember: American Express Platinum is not a credit card. It\u2019s a charge card. Stay away if you have any qualms whatsoever about paying your balance on time and every time. The consequences are serious. Amex strips ALL your membership rewards points from that billing period as a punishment for your truancy. You can pay off the $39 late fee but you can\u2019t get those valuable points back from the abyss.\n\nHow does the Amex Platinum rank in our ratings?\n\nWe\u2019ve called this one of the best international travel cards, and a great pick for cruises.\n\nSo should you get the Amex Platinum Card?\n\nTravelers: Yes. Absolutely. American Express Platinum\u2019s valuable perks enhance every aspect of the travel experience, saving you money, getting you deals, and opening up doors you didn\u2019t even know existed. The top-line annual fee pays for itself surprisingly fast.\n\nNon-travelers: No. Absolutely not. This is a $550 unnecessary metal paperweight. You will not make the most of the perks and will not earn enough bonus points to make it even somewhat worth your while.\n\nWhen you sign up for one of these cards, Reviewed may receive an affiliate commission from The Points Guy Affiliate Network.\n\nPlease note: the offers mentioned above are subject to change at any time and some may no longer be available.\n\nOther Top Credit Card Options\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
