So far, Biden, the frontrunner with a history of mumbles and fluffs, has avoided having to defend himself against Warren, the most effective debater, and who probably has the most detailed set of policy proposals. He can no longer avoid the showdown.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nSecondly, barring some unlikely development, we can assume one of the 10 people who appear in Houston, Texas, will challenge Donald Trump for the presidency in 2020. That is no small responsibility.\n\nDo these expensive, unsatisfying debates, that the Democratic National Committee (DNC) farms out to television channels whose overriding priority is ratings, make a difference? They are pored over by the political and media classes, but frequently ignored by the public, especially given there are 12 of these things scheduled.\n\nBiden had a very bad first debate, where he was mauled by Harris, and not a great second performance. While his poll numbers briefly took a dip, they bounced back and he remains a clear frontrunner. Did those voters who were polled not watch, or did they decide the 76-year-old Biden was still the man for them for other reasons?\n\nOn the other hand, after two impressive and forceful performances, Warren, 70, has seen her numbers steadily climb. A Reuters/Ipsos poll showed the Massachusetts senator\u2019s numbers climbed more than other candidates. The poll put her 11 points behind Biden, on 22, and Sanders on 16. Did her fortunes rise because of those debates, or because of her assiduous and smart groundwork in the key states of Iowa and New Hampshire? Most likely, it was a combination of the two.\n\nOne thing that is certain is the candidates themselves see the things as vital. Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard was furious when she failed to qualify for Houston, accusing the DNC of \u201ccockamamie criteria\u201d. She is hoping to make the fourth debate.\n\nOne person who did not qualify for Houston, but will take part in the fourth debate, is billionaire Tom Steyer. After spending many millions of dollars of his own money in a number of states, the 62-year-old was able to meet the requirement of 130,000 individual donors and a showing of 2 per cent support in four qualifying polls.\n\nHis rivals accused him of buying his way onto the debate stage, an accusation that is hard to disagree with.\n\nUS presidential politics often comes with a Hollywood sheen. But it has long been polluted by money and special interests. That combination is partly what makes it so gripping.\n\nLots of people will be watching the drama in Houston. And so will The Independent.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nAndrew Buncombe\n\nChief US Correspondent", "description": "So, it\u2019s the big one.", "authors": ["Andrew Buncombe"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/09/11/19/Democratic-debate.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
