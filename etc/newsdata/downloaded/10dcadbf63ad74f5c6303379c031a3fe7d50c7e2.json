The malware is capable of stealing money via subscription services you didn't even know you'd signed up for.\n\nThe affected apps have been downloaded nearly half a million times which means your phone could be infected. Here's a complete list of compromised apps you need to uninstall immediately.\n\nAnother day, another batch of Android apps that made it into the Google Play Store \u2014 accumulating hundreds of thousands of downloads \u2014 with some sneaky malware embedded in their code.\n\nThis time around, the malware is called \u201cJoker.\u201d As Aleksejs Kuprins writes over at the cybersecurity company CSIS, this particular malware is designed to silently sign users up for subscription services, something they might not even notice they did unless they\u2019re diligent in checking their monthly credit card statements.\n\nExplainer: How Malware Gets Inside Your Apps Malicious software on popular mobile platforms such as iOS and Android is at best a nuisance and at worst a security threat to individuals and businesses.

Finally, the Joker submits the extracted code to the offer\u2019s webpage, in order to authorise the premium subscription.\u201d\n\nWhile Google has since removed the offending apps from the Google Play store, they managed to rack up more than 472,000 total downloads before their excommunication. If you have any of these apps installed on your own Android phone or tablet\u2014or, worse, you actively use them\u2014it\u2019s time to delete them ASAP.\n\nIf you have used any of these apps, it\u2019s worth checking your Google Play account for any unexpected subscriptions, though we doubt you\u2019ll find anything there. Instead, you\u2019ll want to take a peek at your credit card or bank statements as far back as June of this year, which is when the Joker malware started kicking off its latest batch of auto-subscriptions. You might also want to let your contacts know that you were potentially infected, as Joker pilfers your entire contact list and uploads it to a command and control server.", "description": "There's a new malware threat on the Google Play Store ominously named after the Joker, the deranged criminal mastermind from Batman.
