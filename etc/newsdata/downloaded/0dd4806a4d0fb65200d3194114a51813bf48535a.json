Here, graphic designer Mirko Borsche explains why print will survive, how ugly lines work and why he\u2019s destined to fail\n\nIt\u2019s just about big balls. Very simple. We are working in an industry where the marketing department gives the lead to designers, even to journalists \u2013 what they have to write, how they have to spell it, the trigger words \u2013 my opinion is that it\u2019s because people who run brands have lost their balls completely.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that German graphic designer Mirko Borsche has earned a reputation as something of a provocateur. His opinions are as attention grabbbing as his studio\u2019s diverse projects. Borsche and his team at Bureau Borsche has created websites and logos for fashion houses Balenciaga and Givenchy, and the acid-meets-classicism season guides and posters for the Bavarian State Opera. There\u2019s also his award-winning work as creative director for newspaper Die Zeit, where Borsche has worked since 2007.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Red alert: Borsche\u2019s new logotype for The Face. Photograph: The Face\n\nBureau Borsche has had a big year. In May the studio\u2019s art commission for the Venice Pavillion at the Biennale contaminated the whole city with neon green idents. The art piece played to the biennale theme of fake news by stamping Borsche\u2019s work on everything from flags to plastic bags, as if the artwork were a Venice logo. They also created the logotype for the high profile relaunch of style magazine The Face.\n\nBorsche misspent his youth as a graffiti artist in his native Munich (\u201cbombing trains and walls influenced me a lot\u201d) but went on to study graphic design at Kingston University, London, and the University of Applied Sciences Augsburg, Germany. After five years as an art director in advertising for clients including Levi\u2019s, MTV and Mercedes-Benz, he co-founded the style magazine NEON and art directed S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung Magazin before launching his own graphic design studio in 2007. Bureau Borsche has operated out of his Munich HQ ever since. Though he enjoys the role of agitator Borsche hates designers with huge egos who impose their own aesthetic on brands \u2013 \u201cthe worst thing ever,\u201d he insists.\n\nThis is certainly true of the job he is perhaps best known for: his award-winning creative direction for German newspaper Die Zeit and its supplement, Zeit Magazin. Borsche\u2019s design for the paper is classic and \u201chumble\u201d but allows for unexpected twists in the use of photography and typography \u201cto provoke people or make them see things from a different angle\u201d. By example, he cites the \u201cvery crappy illustrations\u201d by Martin Fengel which feature on Harald Martenstein\u2019s column.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Borsche\u2019s logo for Balenciaga, seen in Stockholm. Photograph: Christian Vierig/Getty Images\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a photographer friend of mine,\u201d he hastens to point out. \u201cHe\u2019s not an illustrator at all, which you can see! But I just felt he had a really nice sense of humour and a way of telling things just with a few ugly lines \u2013 and it worked out really well.\u201d\n\nHe is full of praise for the \u201cquite radical\u201d editorial team who opted to invest in print when the rest of the world was heralding its demise. \u201cIt could have gone wrong but they said, \u2018Our hero is the product, and if the product gets shitty we\u2019re going to sell less\u2019. And, what people don\u2019t see when they say print is going to die is that, once the print product closes, the website is going to close too because it doesn\u2019t make any money.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest His poster for the Bavarian State Opera.\n\nAs for the logotype for The Face magazine, does he worry about upsetting original Face designer Neville Brody , one of the iconic figures of his industry? \u201cThe thing is, nobody\u2019s going to like it anyway,\u201d laughs Borsche. \u201cSo I didn\u2019t really think about that. I just wanted to have the same aesthetic and feeling, but it\u2019s quite hard to recreate that \u2026 editorial design is so much more developed today, so even if everyone remembers how brilliant The Face was, it can look a bit outdated now.\u2019\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, he singles out Nike as one of his favourite clients in terms of attitude to branding. \u201cPeople always say, \u2018Oh Nike are so far ahead of us.\u2019 You know why? Because Nike just trust the person they\u2019re working with \u2013 they let you actually \u2018Just do it\u2019! If you say to them, \u2018I think we should have no swoosh\u2019, they say, \u2018Yeah, OK. If that works out for that design, perfect.\u2019 There\u2019s not a lot of brands in the world that think that way. Apple used to be like that. If you look at European brands, most of them are still stuck in this 80s or 90s idea of marketing \u2013 you do the same things over and over again. And they haven\u2019t realised that nobody \u2013 nobody \u2013 is interested in advertising any more.\u201d", "description": "He\u2019s stamped his style on everything from Nike to the newspapers.
