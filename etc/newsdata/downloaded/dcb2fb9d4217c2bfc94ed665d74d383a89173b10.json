I was waddling around the nice man\u2019s garden in Untitled Goose Game and passed by this meager rose garden, with just one rose pushing above the soil. Maybe he was growing it for his wife. It wasn\u2019t even on my to-do list; I impulsively waddled over, plucked it, shuttled it over to a dirt hill in the far corner and dropped it there. The man panicked. He ran over to grab it and stuffed it back in the dirt.\n\nThe whole pitch of Untitled Goose Game is that you\u2019re an arsehole goose terrorising this nice middle class town somewhere in England. On your checklist are activities like \u201crake in the lake\u201d \u2014 dragging the nice man\u2019s rake into the lake \u2014 and trapping the shopkeeper in her garage. That last one was the first task I was given when my friend passed me the controller.\n\nWe were all seated on couches in my living room, alternating playing the game on my computer and snacking and watching. After a couple of minutes with the game, it dawned on me that it just felt so completely mean. I had no context for the shopkeeper. What did she ever do to me? Baiting her into the dank garage and shutting the door before she could leave \u2014 for no specified reason \u2014 entailed a special level of sociopathy. All watching, my friends laughed.\n\nWhining about how mean the goose is in Untitled Goose Game is like whining about how you don\u2019t want to jack cars in Grand Theft Auto. There isn\u2019t another way to play or enjoy the game. And, in fact, it\u2019s the goose\u2019s unabashed, hardened assholery that\u2019s earned Untitled Goose Game its virality.\n\nThere are a lot of games where the player is the agent of justice, and any mayhem caused in the line of duty is justified by the ends. There aren\u2019t as many where they\u2019re an ethically unhinged agent of chaos, with a whole button dedicated to HONK. This is the gimmick, and I am embarrassed to admit that it was initially just too mean.\n\nIn the peace of these gardeners\u2019 springtime weekends, I can\u2019t help but feel guilt as I snatch a man\u2019s newspaper and toss it into a fountain. I can\u2019t help but cringe as I make someone break a fancy vase \u2014 probably a family heirloom. I compulsively created backstories for each food I dragged away from one gardener \u2014 how the apple was hand-picked, the sandwich, made with cheese from his neighbour\u2019s farm.\n\nFor some reason, where context was left blank, I filled it in with details that made the goose\u2019s actions even more obnoxious. Over and over, my friends would remind me that this was not a normal or healthy way to approach the game.\n\nThen, after I handed off the controller, one of them told me something I\u2019ll never forget. Something that cleanly wiped away any remorse I felt after ripping that woman\u2019s bra off the hanger or haunting the laypeople in town with menacing honks. \u201cJust pretend they\u2019re all Brexiters,\u201d he said.\n\nIt\u2019s a gameplay strategy that\u2019s been widely discussed on Twitter, and one that immediately absolved me of my goose sins past. I\u2019m not going to \u201cWhatever your politics are. . .\u201d with this either, because it\u2019s my goose game and my game diary.\n\nHowever, in an interview with Vulture, after the reporter asked whether players can imagine the goose is punishing the townspeople for voting for Brexit, one developer even gave the go-ahead to this Untitled Goose Game meta-narrative, saying \u201cYou can if you like! You\u2019re very welcome to predict whatever you\u2019d like. We\u2019ve got our joke canon.\u201d That \u201cjoke canon,\u201d the developer said, was this:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s set in a world where a goose chased Margaret Thatcher out of office, leading Tony Benn to take over the U.K. and enact social democracy in the U.K. All the people are good Marxists, and they\u2019re all good people, and the goose is just a goose. All the people on Twitter responded to that saying \u2018Oh, I feel bad that the goose is harassing these Marxists.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s part of the brilliance of this game, it turns out. Senseless evil can only be entertaining for so long, and for weak morality babies like me, causing many people to have bad days mostly just makes us feel kind of crappy if we aren\u2019t on some justice-driven mission.\n\nSo empty of context or motive, Untitled Goose Game is giving us whatever we\u2019re looking for, so simultaneously, I can spin a story about the gardener\u2019s last rose and make myself feel good about plucking it out from under him.", "description": "It was his last rose.
