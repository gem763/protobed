The consensus is overwhelming: the Government must act now.\n\n\u201cThe Government should never have foisted the responsibility for funding free TV licences onto the BBC in the first place. It was an act of political cowardice and now 3.7 million older people are set to lose out next year.\n\n\u201cThe only option now is for this Tory Government to admit they got it wrong, and commit to funding free TV licences for over-75s today.\"\n\nMr Collins comments come alongside the committee\u2019s report on the BBC\u2019s annual accounts.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nThe report found the 2015 funding negotiations which led to the handover of free TV licences was a \u2018flawed\u2019 process on all sides that gave no opportunity for consultation with licence fee payers.\n\nAnd it accused ministers of seeking to \u201cbounce\u201d the broadcaster into accepting the responsibility.\n\nCaroline Abrahams, Charity Director at Age UK welcomed the committee\u2019s report, saying the Government and BBC \u201cwould be wise to sit down and broker a solution now that keeps the over-75s\u2019 TV licence free, before all hell potentially breaks loose next summer.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cOlder people will be immensely pleased and relieved if this happens, as will be the almost a million who have signed petitions in support of them.\u201d\n\nSir David Clementi, Chairman of the BBC, said: \u201cUnder the 2015 agreement, the BBC was given responsibility for the policy, and related funding, of the concession for over 75s.\n\n\u201cWe are pleased that the committee recognise that there was no automatic assumption that the BBC would continue to bear the cost of these free TV licences. There is also clear recognition from the committee that it would be unsustainable for the BBC to take on the full cost of all these free licences alone.\n\n\u201cThe committee report is also clear that the value of the licence fee will continue to be under pressure from inflation in the TV sector.\n\n\u201cThe Committee say that the Government\u2019s process in 2015 was flawed and we agree with this; it was never a process the BBC would have chosen. That\u2019s why there must be a different way of doing things in the future. In terms of the agreement itself, we are satisfied that it was properly discussed within the BBC and properly authorised.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to implement the decision we have taken - after extensive consultation \u2013 on over 75s licence fees with great care and responsibility.\u201d\n\nThe Committee urged the government to overhaul the way negotiations are handled before the next BBC charter renewal in 2021, to provide greater transparency for viewers.\n\nAnd MPs warned the BBC\u2019s funding model could become \u201cunsustainable\u201d if it doesn\u2019t continue to find revenue on top of the license fee.\n\nMr Collins said: \u201cThis issue has also exposed that if the current trends in inflation for TV production costs continue, the value of the licence fee will continue to diminish as a source of revenue for the BBC.\n\n\u201cThe rapidly changing viewing habits of younger audiences, particularly those under the age of 34 who are moving away from broadcast TV to online and on demand channels, poses a further threat to BBC licence fee revenue in the future.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing clear evidence that the funding model of the BBC will become unsustainable without substantial increases in commercial revenue from BBC Studios and new subscription on demand viewing services like Britbox.\u201d", "description": "Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee chair Damian Collins said the broadcaster put itself in the \u2018invidious position\u2019 of administering welfare benefits", "authors": ["Mikey Smith", "Image", "Getty", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article15029461.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_GettyImages-910825010.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
