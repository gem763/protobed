A disappointed Ladd immediately tried to contest the stoppage, claiming it was early, and even filed an appeal to the California State Athletic Commission.\n\nLadd\u2019s team argued that gender played a role in the stoppage because she\u2019s a woman, which might not have been the case if she was a male fighter. Her appeal was denied last week by a vote of 3-2 after Dean defended his case, saying he doesn\u2019t discriminate against women.\n\nFormer referee turned Bellator analyst John McCarthy agrees with the CSAC\u2019s decision to uphold de Randamie\u2019s win and explained why during a Q&A session on Monday.\n\n\u201cI used to have people all the time ask me, \u2018How do you referee women different than men?\u2019 You don\u2019t,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly the same. What about the groin? Women have a groin. It may not be the same, but it\u2019s the same rule, and if a woman gets hit in the groin, stop, time, you get your time.\u201d\n\n\u201cAspen got hit by a girl, a lady, a female fighter that hits like a truck,\u201d McCarthy added. \u201cGermaine can hit. Germaine has actually fought men in professional fights, I\u2019ll tell you right now. I do not agree with that. I don\u2019t believe in the whole Henry Cejudo intergender \u2026 OK, there\u2019s differences and there\u2019s reasons why we can have separate categories in sports, weight, just everything. But she got hit with a right hand, and it was \u2026 She got spun around, dropped down to her hands and knees. Did she move?\u201d\n\nMcCarthy referenced the controversial refereeing in the Mike Davis vs. Thomas Gifford fight earlier this month at UFC on ESPN+ 19, where Gifford took an absolute beating. Many believed that fight should have been stopped before Gifford took unnecessary damage that could affect his career in the long run.\n\nWhile McCarthy believes the Ladd stoppage might\u2019ve have been a little early, he believes Dean did her a favor, as she was just going to take unnecessary follow up shots if the fight continued.\n\n\u201cSo Aspen Ladd, in that fight, yes she could have taken one more,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cI\u2019m telling you right now: She was done. She was not going to make it out of that. Herb actually saved her. I\u2019m not saying it was the best; it was a little early, but he actually saved her from a beating, and she\u2019s going to be able to come back, and she\u2019s going to do just fine because he didn\u2019t let that happen to her. I know it\u2019s frustrating to her. She can\u2019t see the future, but a lot of times the referee, I swear to God, you can see the future, and Herb, it was the right call. I thought it was early too.\u201d\n\nLadd has moved on as she is scheduled to take on Yana Kunitskaya on Dec. 7 at UFC on ESPN 7 in Washington D.C.", "description": "John McCarthy disagrees with Aspen Ladd's team that her stoppage loss to Germaine de Randamie was a result of gender discrimination.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Mike Bohn", "Simon Samano", "Abbey Subhan", "Mma Junkie Staff", "The Blue Corner", "Dan Tom", "Simon Head"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/07/germaine-de-randamie-aspen-ladd-ufc-on-espn-plus-13-5.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
