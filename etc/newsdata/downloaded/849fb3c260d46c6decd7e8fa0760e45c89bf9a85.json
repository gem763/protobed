That might sound like a contradiction, but it encapsulates the spirit of Naoshima: an immersive art experience that fuses stubborn opposites like nature and culture, and old and new, into perfect harmony.\n\nBenesse Corporation sponsors most of the work on the island, and their museums are world-class institutions with works by an impressive roster of artists, including Claude Monet, Jackson Pollock, and Walter de Maria. The Benesse House functions as both hotel and art gallery, letting you fulfill your wildest dreams of having a sleepover with Andy Warhol.\n\nChichu Art Museum\n\nThe nearby Chichu Art Museum is possibly the most outstanding structure in a place with no end to remarkable stuff. Built almost entirely underground, the museum relies on natural light for most of its limited but outstanding collection, subtly transforming the works into something new every time you look. Stroll down to the docks and you\u2019ll come across Naoshima\u2019s most famous sight: a polka-dotted pumpkin designed by mother of Japanese avant-garde art, Yayoi Kusama.\n\nThe Setouchi Triennale only happens every three years so don't miss your chance to see this expansive contemporary art festival which runs until Nov 4.\n\nClick here to read more.\n\nExternal Link\n\nhttps://gaijinpot.com/\n\n\u00a9 GaijinPot Travel", "description": "One of the most progressive, dynamic, and celebrated hotbeds of contemporary art in the world is a small fishing island sleeping on the waves of Japan\u2019s Seto Inland Sea.
