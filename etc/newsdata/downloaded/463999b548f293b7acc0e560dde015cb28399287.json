Obama came to Sandy Hook and met with every family. Joe Biden DID NOT,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn fact, my family was not allowed on Air Force One because we refused to support Obama/Biden gun control efforts\u201d:\n\nThis is a lie. Obama came to Sandy Hook and met with every family. Joe Biden DID NOT. In fact, my family was not allowed on Air Force One because we refused to support Obama/Biden gun control efforts. https://t.co/SSIv7SpHVL \u2014 JT Lewis (@thejtlewis) October 23, 2019\n\nBiden has experienced issues with misremembering key events in the past. He told reporters in August that the students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a gunman took the lives of 17 people, visited him while he was vice president, even though the shooting took place long after he left office.\n\nAs Bloomberg reported:\n\nBiden told reporters in Iowa on Saturday that \u201cthose kids in Parkland came up to see me when I was vice president.\u201d But when they visited Capitol Hill to talk with members of Congress, lawmakers were \u201cbasically cowering, not wanting to see them. They did not want to face it on camera.\u201d\n\nLewis also harkened to Biden\u2019s Parkland gaffe, adding, \u201c@JoeBiden is either a liar or he\u2019s losing his mind\u201d:\n\nJoe Biden just claimed that he came to Sandy Hook after the shooting and met with every family who lost someone. It was actually Obama who did that, NOT Joe Biden. Biden also thought he was VP when Parkland happened. @JoeBiden is either a liar or he\u2019s losing his mind. \u2014 JT Lewis (@thejtlewis) October 23, 2019\n\n\u201cJoe Biden says that he experienced Sandy Hook firsthand with parents of victims and first responders. I clarified that Obama was here days after the shooting doing just that and Biden was not,\u201d Lewis added in a tweet the next day.\n\n\u201cIn the years following the shooting he has hosted events for some in those groups,\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration only offered a ride to DC on Air Force One to a select few who were lobbying for gun control,\u201d he added:", "description": "The brother of one of the 20 children murdered in the Sandy Hook massacre claimed that Joe Biden lied in a campaign ad.", "authors": ["Hannah Bleau"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Sandy-Hook-Elementary-School-sign-afp-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-26"}
