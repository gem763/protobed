(AP) - Among the residents of Dixon, New Mexico, Stanley Crawford has long been known as a gentleman farmer and a thoughtful man of letters.\n\nHe\u2019s the author of such books as \u201cA Garlic Testament: Seasons on a Small New Mexico Farm\u201d and \u201cMayordomo: Chronicle of an Acequia in Northern New Mexico,\u201d and teaches creative writing at Colorado College.\n\nCrawford is such a personage in the sleepy village that a stop at the Dixon Cooperative Market for directions to El Bosque Garlic Farm quickly brings the reply, \u201cFollow the bend in the road and make a quick left after the bridge.\u201d\n\nBut Crawford\u2019s image has shifted in recent years: He has become a lightning rod for controversy. The 82-year-old brought on the change in 2014 when he agreed to file a complaint against Harmoni International Spice, an American company that is owned by Chinese exporter Zhengzhou Harmoni Spice.\n\nCrawford maintains that Harmoni enjoys a unique advantage in the U.S. garlic market because it sells product being \u201cdumped\u201d by its parent at below-market prices without having to pay any anti-dumping duty.\n\nThe ensuing years of litigation between Crawford and Harmoni and its allies in California, garlic wholesaler Christopher Ranch and the Fresh Garlic Producers Association, have unleashed vitriol and a complicated legal saga that few could have foreseen.\n\nThe dispute spawned \u201cGarlic Breath,\u201d an episode in the 2018 Netflix series \u201cRotten\u201d chronicling the worldwide supply chains of six commodities.\n\nCrawford has been accused of being \u201cbought off\u201d to join in the litigation. Christopher Ranch has denied allegations in the Netflix documentary, including claims about price-fixing and worker mistreatment.\n\n\u201cMillions of dollars have been spent fighting over this little piece of land,\u201d said the lanky farmer on a recent fall day as he stood on one of the fields on his two-acre garlic farm, which sells its produce at the Santa Fe Farmers Market on Tuesdays and Saturdays.\n\nThe challenge to Harmoni\u2019s imports, which has taken place in venues ranging from the U.S. Department of Commerce, the federal Court of International Trade in New York and federal Circuit Court in Washington, D.C., fractured a friendship between Crawford and a fellow garlic farmer.\n\nThe garlic fight has also brought Crawford literally and figuratively closer to his attorney and his wife, international trade lawyer Ted Hume and his spouse Renate Hume.\n\nThe Humes, who stayed in a bed-and-breakfast on Crawford\u2019s property when they came to enlist the garlic farmer to lead the charge against Harmoni, have moved from Ojai, California, to nearby Taos in the time since the first legal fusillades were fired.\n\nSadly, the years have seen the deterioration of Crawford\u2019s wife RoseMary due to Alzheimer\u2019s disease and her exile to a care facility in Albuquerque. RoseMary, who made the trip from San Francisco to the Embudo Valley in 1969 with her husband and 1-year-old son via a used Volkswagen van, was Crawford\u2019s partner in all things, including garlic.\n\nPerhaps most important of all, the legal odyssey that has taken Crawford to China, New York and Washington has provided the author with grist for his literary mill.\n\nHis latest book, \u201cThe Garlic Papers: A Small Garlic Farm in the Age of Global Vampires,\u201d was recently published by Santa Fe\u2019s Leaf Storm Press and may well represent the culmination of his writing career.\n\nThe book is part legal textbook and part farmer\u2019s almanac, sprinkled with observations from an octogenarian on the nature of life in an era of climate change and global trade.\n\nThe thread running throughout the book is Harmoni\u2019s assertion that Crawford is a mere hobby farmer who lacks the legal standing to sue behemoth agricultural competitors, an erasure of the work he has been doing full time for 42 years.\n\nCrawford notes that one of Harmoni\u2019s legal filings included the line: \u201cEl Bosque Garlic Farm is such a fiction that it couldn\u2019t walk into a McDonald\u2019s and order a cheeseburger.\u201d\n\nProfessor Crawford then proceeds to throw serious shade at this expression: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know what to call this figure of speech. Or disfigure of speech. The line was probably written by a young law intern trying to show some literary flair.\u201d\n\nThe bottom line, as far as Crawford goes: \u201cThe cheeseburger statement reveals Harmoni\u2019s intentions to turn my farm - and therefore a good part of my life - into a legal fiction in order to induce the Department of Commerce to dismiss my administrative review request.\u201d\n\nAsked if he has any regrets about mounting his legal battle, Crawford echoes what he wrote in his book: \u201cNo. It\u2019s what keeps me going.\u201d\n\nDespite the personal fallout from the garlic fight, Crawford has gotten some good news lately. Harmoni agreed to dismiss a racketeering case against him and his lawyer in a settlement that leaves them free to continue to ask the Commerce Department to review Harmoni\u2019s zero duty. In the meantime, Crawford awaits decisions by the Federal Court of International Trade and the Federal Circuit Court in Washington.\n\nOne ruling is expected on Nov. 4, a day that, as Crawford notes, follows the 37th annual Dixon Studio Tour, to be held Nov. 2 and 3. It is telling that the village tour is how the author marks time. It is when El Bosque Garlic Farm opens its doors to the public to sell the remains of the annual harvest, as well as the garlic braids and ristras that RoseMary used to artfully arrange and that are now put together by a neighbor.\n\nIn his book, Crawford devotes an entire chapter to the clay medallions that adorn the garlic creations. Why bother with them, he asks rhetorically, but then envisions a day when \u201csome human rooting around in the earth, planting a garden again or a tree, may come across a thick, rough ceramic disk with the words El Bosque Garlic Farm.\u201d\n\nHe concludes, \u201cIn like manner, I have pulled from my fields rusty horseshoes, a bridle bit, fragments of metal spurs and have wondered about those who preceded me. And on the mesa above, there lie pottery shards pre-dating the Conquest by hundreds of years.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Among the residents of Dixon, New Mexico, Stanley Crawford has long been known as a gentleman farmer and a thoughtful man of letters.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Monica Roman Gagnier"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
