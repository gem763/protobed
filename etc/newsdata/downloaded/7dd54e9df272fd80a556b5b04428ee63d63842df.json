Chang Won-sam, who negotiated the 10th SMA, represented Korea during the first round before Jeong\u2019s appointment.Jeong, a former vice chairman of the Financial Services Commission who had a long career in the Finance Ministry, will face off against James DeHart, senior adviser for security negotiations and agreements in the U.S. Department of State\u2019s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs.DeHart, a career diplomat, was named to his position on Sept. 10. The State Department describes him as the U.S. lead negotiator for \u201cbilateral security agreements ranging from status of forces and defense cooperation to burden-sharing agreements with foreign partners.\u201dHe previously served as assistant chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, an acting deputy assistant secretary in the State Department\u2019s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), a director of the Office of Afghanistan Affairs reporting to the department\u2019s Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan (SRAP) and a director for Central Asia for the White House National Security Council Staff. He is also an expert on NATO affairs.Washington has been pressuring Seoul to pay as much as $5 billion a year, or some five times the current amount. Under the 10th SMA, Seoul agreed to pay nearly 1.04 trillion won ($888.8 million) this year, which was 8.2 percent more than what Korea spent the previous year for the stationing of 28,500 U.S. troops here.A U.S. State Department spokesperson told the JoongAng Ilbo Monday that it is important to conclude the negotiations by \u201cthe end of the year\u201d as not to leave a gap between the bilateral SMAs, which have been in place since 1991.In a statement Friday announcing the talks in Honolulu this week, the State Department called the bilateral burden-sharing agreement \u201cthe mechanism by which [South Korea] shares the costs of U.S. forces to defend [South Korea].\u201dWhile Washington appreciates \u201cthe considerable resources\u201d Korea provides to the alliance, the State Department added that U.S. President Donald Trump \u201chas been clear that [South Korea] can and should contribute more of its fair share.\u201dThe State Department said, \u201cSustaining the costs of our global military presence is not a burden that should fall on the U.S. taxpayer alone, but is a responsibility that should be shared fairly with allies and partners who benefit from our presence.\u201dWashington \u201cseeks a fair and equitable outcome to the SMA negotiations for both countries that will strengthen and sustain the resilient U.S.-ROK Alliance,\u201d it added, referring to the acronym for the Republic of Korea, or South Korea.Seoul has been calling for a \u201creasonable and fair\u201d deal.The talks are expected to be a battle of wits between the Blue House and White House, as the National Security Councils both countries are expected to set the overall direction of the negotiations.The mastermind in the Blue House is Kim Hyun-chong, the second deputy of the Blue House National Security Office, who previously led FTA negotiations with the United States.Before he was ousted by Trump, John Bolton, the former White House national security adviser, pressured Seoul to pay a much higher share for defense during a visit to Korea in August. There is interest to see what sort of role the new national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, previously the presidential envoy for hostage affairs, will take on the issue.Some government sources in Seoul say that Washington is aiming to change the concept of the defense agreement from being just about the sharing of expenses of the stationing of the U.S. Forces Korea. As part of its Indo-Pacific Strategy, the U.S. government appears to be demanding Korea pay for other costs of the alliance, such as the cost of deploying strategic assets to the Korean Peninsula or for supporting the U.S.-led coalition to safeguard the Strait of Hormuz.\u201cThe United States appears to demanding Korea to bear the cost of global peacekeeping forces going beyond the Korean Peninsula and for the deployment of strategic assets and joint drills,\u201d said James Kim, director of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Washington. \u201cIt can also signify a push for Korea to actively partake militarily in its Indo-Pacific Strategy.\u201dWhen asked in a parliamentary foreign affairs committee meeting on Monday about Korea\u2019s plans to partake in a U.S.-led coalition in the Strait of Hormuz, Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha replied, \u201cWe will continue to review with the United States on what ways we can contribute.\u201dBY JUNG HYO-SIK, LEE YU-JUNG AND SARAH KIM [kim.sarah@joongang.co.kr]", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://static.joins.com/joongang_15re/profile_koreajoongangdaily_200.png", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
