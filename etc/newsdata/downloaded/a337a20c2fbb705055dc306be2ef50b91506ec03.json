We\u2019re interested in how its theories and gadgets stack up against real science and technology (really, really interested).\n\nWe care about gender equity among Doctor Who\u2019s scientist characters, and the cultural significance of casting Jodie Whittaker as the first female Doctor.\n\nAs long ago as 1985, Britain\u2019s Royal Society wondered whether they could use Doctor Who to promote greater public understanding of science.\n\nGiven that we care so much, one might expect to see strong evidence that Doctor Who shapes how its viewers think and feel about science. But there has been no peer-reviewed research in this area, only anecdotes from a few scientist-fans.\n\nUntil now.\n\nIn my research, published in the Journal of Science Communication, I surveyed 575 science-interested Doctor Who viewers, asking whether and how the show contributed to their relationship with science.\n\nMany of them said it did. But as it turns out, not in consistent ways.\n\nThoughts about science\n\nI recruited the 575 people via ScienceAlert; they were 59 per cent female, 40 per cent male and 1 per cent non-binary or gender-fluid. They were aged 18-73, and were drawn from 37 nations, predominantly Australia (50 per cent and the United States (24 per cent).\n\nOf the 575 respondents, 398 said Doctor Who influenced their thoughts about science in one way or another.\n\nJust over 300 respondents said the show contributed to their ideas about science ethics, the relationship between science and the rest of society, and/or the place of science in human history.\n\nMost commonly, Doctor Who prompted people to think more deeply about the ethics of science, including its moral ambiguity and potential for doing both good and bad. Second to that, many said Doctor Who demonstrated science\u2019s importance in society and history.\n\nHowever, individual participants sometimes drew opposite conclusions about the show\u2019s moral messages. For example, one participant said their take-home message from Doctor Who on science ethics was:\n\nStrong ethical guidelines and laws need to exist, and be enforced.\n\nBut for another participant it was precisely the opposite:\n\nWe should stop putting ethics in the way of scientific research.\n\nDoctor Who is a popular cosplay theme. But some people base more than just their outfit on the Time Lord\u2019s exploits.

It sparked interest in pursuing diverse science (and other) fields including physics, astronomy, maths, engineering, computer science, environmental science, chemistry, psychology, science teaching, and science communication.\n\nPeople said things like:\n\nIt made me want to learn more about science. I became a science major [because] of it.\n\nAnd:\n\nI have a degree in Environmental Science specifically because of watching the 4th Doctor deal with oil rigs. That and the Exxon Valdez made me want to change things.\n\nSome respondents said Doctor Who simply instilled a love of learning in them or made them proud of achieving academic success.\n\nJust a TV show?\n\nThe survey responses go far beyond the previous anecdotes from fans about how much they love science and Doctor Who. It gives us lots of new evidence to analyse \u2013 some 58,000 words of qualitative data. But the responses were far from unanimously positive.\n\nIn the survey group, 107 people answered \u201cno\u201d to all or most of my key questions, indicating Doctor Who had not contributed to their relationship to science in any of the ways I asked about.\n\nThey gave a range of reasons. Some came to Doctor Who too late, after their views on science had already formed. Or other factors such as school or family determined their attitudes to science and life decisions, so Doctor Who wasn\u2019t important (gasp!).\n\nOthers were more cynical, generally mocking the notion of science fiction influencing them at all, or arguing that Doctor Who\u2019s depictions of science were too inaccurate, fantastical or trivial to have an impact.\n\nSome responses were neither particularly positive or negative, with Doctor Who simply validating or reinforcing people\u2019s existing ideas about science.\n\nSo will Doctor Who create a planet of scientists?\n\nPart of the job for some science communicators, science teachers and scientists is to inspire people\u2019s interest in science.\n\nMy study shows that engaging with a science-rich television program can have a profoundly inspiring effect on a person\u2019s attitudes to science. In fact, their life might be changed because of it.\n\nIf that kind of inspiration is your goal, it is worth investing in science-rich television fiction as a science engagement medium.\n\nBut don\u2019t get too excited. Not everyone\u2019s science attitudes are affected by the same program. Any positive effects may be minor, rather than life-changing. And two viewers may interpret the science on screen in completely different ways. Also, my participants volunteered to participate, so the numbers don\u2019t necessarily represent statistical patterns among Doctor Who viewers generally.\n\nThis backs up what science communication researchers have been saying for years. Television audiences aren\u2019t ignorant dupes brainwashed by what they watch. People watch television fiction critically, aware it is fiction. All of us bring our existing knowledge, beliefs, fears and ideals to the viewing experience and make our own meanings from it in light of them.\n\nWhat science-rich fiction can do, though, is set an agenda. It can offer people new frameworks for pondering science questions and provoking conversations about them.\n\nSo despite the caveats, if we want to nurture a society of people who think about science more keenly, more critically and more often, we could do worse than plug the next season of Doctor Who.\n\nLindy Orthia, Senior Lecturer in Science Communication, Australian National University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.", "description": "Scientists and science fans love to discuss the science in Doctor Who.
