It was a short period of time and, since then, he has sought alternative remedies for his issues. He is no longer drinking.'\n\nHolmes, a fish factory worker, was given a one-year conditional discharge and was ordered to pay \u00a385 costs and a Government-imposed \u00a321 victims' surcharge.\n\nPresiding magistrate Gerald Hooton said: 'The police are quite busy and can't deal with these type of calls. That's why they are called nuisance calls.'", "description": "Anthony Holmes, 62, from Grimsby, this week admitted sending annoying messages to the police between July 29 and 30 this year.
