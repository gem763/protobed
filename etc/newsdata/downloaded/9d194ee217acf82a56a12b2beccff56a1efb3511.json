A 39-year-old was killed in the western city of Incheon after being crushed by a collapsed wall at a hospital parking lot, while a 61-year-old Chinese national died in the border town of Paju after being hit by a blown-off roof tile.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Its strength was weakening, with winds measured up to 115 kilometers (71 miles) per hour, according to the agency.\n\nLingling packed winds of 196 kilometers (122 miles) per hour at around 6:30 a.m. on South Korea\u2019s southern coast, making the typhoon the fifth strongest to hit the country since 1959.\n\nResidents in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang were seen using umbrellas to shield themselves from wind and rain while struggling to walk through wet streets.\n\nIn South Korea, the storm toppled hundreds of trees and streetlamps, blew signboards off buildings and damaged traffic signs across the mainland and Jeju. More than 200 flights were grounded at airports nationwide, while 38 people were forced to evacuate from their flooded homes in Gwangju, a city near Seoul.\n\nTen cars were damaged in the southern town of Namwon when a roof plate blew off an apartment building and crashed into a parking lot. A similar incident in the eastern city of Wonju left five vehicles destroyed. A large spire was knocked off a church in a commercial district in Seoul.\n\n\u201cThe spire collapsed after a sudden gust of wind, hitting a building nearby and a telephone pole and falling over a car. That caused electrical sparks,\u201d Yeom Sang-min, a Seoul resident told, told TV news channel YTN.\n\nTraffic to Incheon International Airport, one of Asia\u2019s largest transport hubs, was disrupted by the closure of its gateway bridge and a power failure at a commuter rail network that links the airport with Seoul. Fire crews in Incheon responded to some 100 calls reporting typhoon-related damage, including destroyed walls, knocked-off signboards and fallen trees.\n\nNational parks were closed, as were southern ports on the mainland and major cross-sea bridges.\n\nThe storm could possibly inflict more serious damage as it passes through North Korea, an impoverished nation that for decades has struggled to deal with natural disasters. There were no immediate reports of weather-related injuries in North Korea, but state TV reported that an unspecified number of homes and buildings had been damaged and showed footage of flooded streets and toppled trees.\n\nNorth Korea\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency, or KCNA, said leader Kim Jong Un \u201curgently convened\u201d an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss disaster prevention efforts and scolded government officials who he described as \u201chelpless against the typhoon, unaware of its seriousness and seized with easygoing sentiment.\u201d\n\nKim called for his military to drive national efforts to minimize damage from the typhoon, which he said would be an \u201cenormous struggle\u201d that would require the entire country to step up, the report said.\n\nNorth Korea, which suffers from severe food shortages, was paying \u201cprimary attention\u201d to protect agricultural crops and prevent damage in dikes, dams and reservoirs, KCNA said. It said officials were also moving residents in areas vulnerable to flooding and deploying \u201cwatchmen\u201d to monitor bridges, buildings and houses.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.", "description": "One of the most powerful typhoons to ever hit South Korea swept along the country's coast on Saturday.", "authors": ["Kim Tong-Hyung"], "top_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/ap19250318676331.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
