According to an official, Trump believed he could solve the problem.\n\nDunn\u2019s parents declined the offer, saying that a meeting should take place on British soil and at a time when they felt more prepared. Trump later claimed the meeting with the Dunn family was \u201cbeautiful,\u201d while the family\u2019s spokesperson called it \u201can ambush.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "British police officers are expected to fly to the United States as soon as they have the visas to do so.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hassan", "Social Media Editor For The Foreign Desk"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/8xnWjmGNy5r-DwiFiSm4LW_mtY8=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/AZPCHRYYWBAORNEV33FINGPZCU.png", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
