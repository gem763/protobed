That happened later at the request of the Roosevelt administration, which then used the men to promote the war effort at home.\n\nThe Marine Corps said that while Gagnon wasn't in the Rosenthal picture, which is the basis of the Iwo Jima Memorial in Arlington, Virginia, he played a significant role in the flag-raising.\n\nGagnon \"was directly responsible for getting the larger second flag to the top and returning the first flag for safe keeping.\"\n\n\"Without his efforts, this historical event might never have been captured, let alone even occurred,\" a Marine Corps statement said.\n\n\"Regardless of who was in the photograph, each and every Marine who set foot on Iwo Jima, or supported the effort from the sea and air around the island is, and always will be, a part of our Corps' cherished history,\" it said.", "description": "The US Marine Corps on Thursday acknowledged an error in the identity of a second marine pictured lifting the American flag over Iwo Jima in one of the most iconic photographs of World War II.
