Photo: Erik Simander/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOn Wednesday morning, President Trump tweeted out the winner of the contest to replace John Bolton as national security adviser: Robert C. O\u2019Brien, who currently serves as special presidential envoy for hostage affairs at the Department of State. So Trump\u2019s new national security adviser is a hostage negotiator. The jokes just write themselves, don\u2019t they?\n\nMore seriously, the appointment of Robert O\u2019Brien doesn\u2019t tell us very much about the prospects for war in the Gulf or deals with Iran or North Korea. O\u2019Brien\u2019s published writings place him in the traditionally hawkish wing of the GOP. His 2016 book While America Slept slammed President Obama for a \u201c\u2018lead-from-behind\u2019 foreign policy\u201d and featured a cover blurb from Bolton. But his predecessor, who not only had hawkish views but a significant national following for them, failed to move Trump and lost control of the policy process. O\u2019Brien\u2019s first task, an unenviable one, will be demonstrating to his fellow Cabinet members that he can steer foreign-policy decision-making \u2014 and making the case that they, especially the empowered Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, should allow themselves to be steered.\n\nWhile O\u2019Brien\u2019s selection offers few clues about the direction of Trump\u2019s haphazard foreign policy, it does tell us a several things about the president and the state of the Republican Party. First, Trump still wants the patina of national security pros with GOP establishment pedigrees. He didn\u2019t take the opportunity to be his own national security adviser, or dual-hat Secretary of State Mike Pompeo or chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. He didn\u2019t choose one of his more prominent current officials like ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell or Iran envoy Brian Hook, both of whom have well-established and controversial public profiles as enthusiasts of administration policy. Instead, he chose someone with a low profile but a serious one; or, put another way, someone with credibility to sacrifice on Trump\u2019s behalf.\n\nSecond, members of the GOP establishment still want to lavish their professional credibility on Trump and his shambolic, blustering, unapologetic approach to world affairs. O\u2019Brien lacks the senior experience of recent past national security advisers, and his tenure as special representative for hostage affairs is not universally well regarded. \u201cI cannot point to a single major accomplishment during his tenure,\u201d an academic who studies hostage policy told me. But O\u2019Brien is not a lightweight. He served at the United Nations under George W. Bush, in a Senate-confirmed post. He was a lawyer in the Army Reserves and worked for the UN Security Council resolving claims that originated in the first Gulf War. He advised presidential candidates Mitt Romney, Ted Cruz, and Scott Walker.\n\nThough O\u2019Brien expressed reservations about Trump in 2016, after the election he began lavishing praise on the new president, describing him recently as the \u201cgreatest hostage negotiator that I know of in the history of the United States.\u201d O\u2019Brien chose to press his case for the job with Trump the same week the president mocked the previous national security adviser publicly, appeared to put U.S. forces and war-making decisions at the disposal of Saudi Arabia, and then blithely told reporters that the Saudis would pay us for taking military action.This was also the same week that Trump appointees were accused of suppressing an intelligence community whistleblower\u2019s allegations about misconduct of senior-level officials. Even as those failures of policy process, of diplomacy, and of basic conservative values like discretion and respect for the law were reported, O\u2019Brien and other men who were mainstays of the GOP foreign-policy establishment lined up to compete to be the next national security adviser Trump ignores and humiliates. At least they didn\u2019t have to wear neon-yellow ruffled shirts and dance like Sean Spicer, I guess.\n\nI hope O\u2019Brien can rebuild a policy process that can tell Trump and his inner circle why some ideas are bad and some tweets inappropriate. I hope he cares enough to keep policy moving in the places where good people in government still get up every day and try to do good things around the world under the radar \u2014 and yes, they are still there.\n\nBut what I see in Trump\u2019s choice and the dance that led up to it is a GOP foreign-policy establishment that thinks it has no options other than Trump and little future beyond him. O\u2019Brien and his peers \u2014 men in their 40s, 50s, and 60s \u2014 could choose to wait Trump out, or depart, in the expectation of serving more honorably in a future Republican administration. They look to the GOP national-security leadership in the Senate and see little inclination to challenge either Trump\u2019s policies or his ethics. And the GOP leadership in turn looks back at the willingness of respectable men to serve (yes, I am intentionally using \u201cmen\u201d here) and uses that as a data point to tell each other that everything is fine.", "description": "GOP establishment mainstays like Robert O\u2019Brien lined up to be national security adviser, even after President Trump ignored and humiliated John Bolton.", "authors": ["Heather Hurlburt"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intelligencer/2019/09/17/18-robert-c-obrien.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
