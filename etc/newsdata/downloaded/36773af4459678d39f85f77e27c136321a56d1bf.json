Since Gus doesn\u2019t have limbs strong enough to support a traditional prosthetic, this was his best option. She was able to put the body shell on top a piece of plastic fashioned just like a snowboard.\n\nAnd now Gus is a two-legged snowboarding pup.\n\nMelody Rezzonico\n\nWith his variety of prosthetics, Gus has gone up on a couple of 14,000-foot mountains, visited Moab, Utah, ran through sand dunes, and has gone backpacking, swimming and kayaking.\n\nMost people stop and ask about his story when they see him wheeling or snowboarding outdoors. Rezzonico tells them, \u201cJust because he\u2019s a little different doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s not worth fighting for.\u201d\n\nShe says it\u2019s a great reminder to never underestimate anyone because they\u2019re different.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know what his level would be at when we adopted him,\" she said. \"But he\u2019s the most active dog I have, and I have a herding dog, so that says a lot about him.\u201d", "description": "Melody Rezzonico rescued her two-legged dog Gus, who has different prosthetics for all his adventures from the snow to sand dunes.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/dog-ht-jt-191001_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg"}
