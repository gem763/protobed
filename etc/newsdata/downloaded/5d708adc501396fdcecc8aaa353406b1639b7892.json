Our current policies on fact checking people in political office, or those running for office, are a threat to what FB stands for,\u201d they wrote.\n\n\u201cWe strongly object to this policy as it stands,\u201d the employees continued. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t protect voices, but instead allows politicians to weaponize our platform by targeting people who believe that content posted by political figures is trustworthy.\u201d\n\nThe employees also called on Mr. Zuckerberg to require political advertisements to receive the same \u201cstandards that our other ads have to follow\u201d and put restrictions on targeting advertisements and spending caps.\n\n\u201cWe want to have this conversation in an open dialog because we want to see actual change,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThis is still our company.\u201d\n\nThe letter follows a fiery congressional hearing last week where Mr. Zuckerberg defended the policy. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, New York Democrat, began pressing him on whether she could take out advertisements accusing Republicans of supporting the Green New Deal.\n\n\u201cSo you will take down lies, or you won\u2019t take down lies? I think this is a pretty simple yes or no,\u201d she asked, to which Mr. Zuckerberg replied it would depend on the \u201ccontext.\u201d\n\nMs. Ocasio-Cortez praised the Facebook employees for their letter, labeling them as \u201ccourageous.\u201d\n\n\u201cCourageous workers at Facebook are now standing up to the corporation\u2019s leadership, challenging Zuckerberg\u2019s disturbing policy on allowing paid, targeted disinformation ads in the 2020 election,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIn a statement to The Hill, Facebook\u2019s vice president of corporate communications, Bertie Thomson, said: \u201cFacebook\u2019s culture is built on openness so we appreciate our employees voicing their thoughts on this important topic.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe remain committed to not censoring political speech, and will continue exploring additional steps we can take to bring increased transparency to political ads,\u201d she said.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
