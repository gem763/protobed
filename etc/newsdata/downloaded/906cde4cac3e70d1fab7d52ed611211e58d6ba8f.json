Even as these plans firm up, advisers could still strike an agreement that buys the retailer more time before resorting to bankruptcy, the people said.\n\nFounded in 1984, Forever 21 operates more than 800 stores in the U.S., Europe, Asia and Latin America.\n\nRepresentatives for Los Angeles-based Forever 21 didn\u2019t comment on the preparations, but referred to a statement it released Wednesday in response to a Wall Street Journal report that the retailer was planning to file for bankruptcy as early as Sunday.\n\nTroubled Malls\n\n\u201cForever 21 is not planning to file for bankruptcy on Sunday,\u201d the statement read. \u201cOur stores are open and it is our intention to continue to operate the vast majority of U.S. stores, as well as a smaller amount of international stores, providing customers with great service and the curated assortment of merchandise that they love and expect from Forever 21.\u201d\n\nBankruptcy protection would help the bargain apparel firm shed unprofitable stores after expanding too far and too fast in recent years, the people said.\n\nIt could also stress major mall owners, including Simon Property Group Inc. and Brookfield Property Partners LP. Forever 21 is one of the biggest mall tenants still standing after a wave of bankruptcies in the retail sector that has seen more than 8,200 outlets close this year.\n\nThe landlords may consider unusual means to preserve Forever 21\u2019s survival, people with knowledge of the developments said last month. Mall owners and company representatives have discussed easing Forever 21\u2019s rent in exchange for an interest in the retailer.\n\nBloomberg first reported last month that Forever 21 was preparing for a potential bankruptcy filing.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Eliza Ronalds-Hannon in New York at eronaldshann@bloomberg.net;Lauren Coleman-Lochner in New York at llochner@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Rick Green at rgreen18@bloomberg.net, Nicole Bullock\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.", "description": "(Bloomberg) -- Forever 21 Inc. is preparing to close at least 100 stores as part of a restructuring that calls for the trendy retailer to file for bankruptcy as early as this month, according to people with knowledge of the preparations.The apparel merchant is working on obtaining a financial package", "authors": ["Eliza Ronalds-Hannon", "Lauren Coleman-Lochner"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aW3XDjpsd.TKqAiNqz1qhw--~B/aD0xMzMzO3c9MjAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en/bloomberg_markets_842/fb1d87de61327fcec1ffdd57b886d340", "published_at": "2019-09-13"}
