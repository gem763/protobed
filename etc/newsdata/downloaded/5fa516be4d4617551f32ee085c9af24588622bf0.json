We can never declare a ceasefire.\"\n\nThe ethnically divided Kurdish-held border town of Ras al-Ain in Syria is one of the key targets of Turkey's invasion and has come under heavy bombardment\n\nThe operation has widespread support in Turkey, where decades of bloody insurgency by Kurdish militants has killed tens of thousands of people.\n\nBut Western powers are spooked that the operation is endangering the battle against the Islamic State group, which was led on the ground by Kurdish forces. Thousands of IS prisoners are held in Kurdish-run camps in the region.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Wednesday that the camps were not \"currently\" under threat from the operation, but Europe has taken an increasingly tough line with Turkey.\n\nBritain and Spain became the latest powers to suspend military exports to Turkey on Tuesday. Canada made a similar move.\n\n- Kurds try to defend border -\n\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have mounted a desperate defence to the east of Ras al-Ain, using tunnels, berms and trenches.\n\nAn AFP correspondent said clashes around the town were ongoing on Wednesday despite Ankara's repeated claims it had captured the area.\n\nSyrian forces have returned to the region for the first time in years\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Kurdish fighters had launched \"a large counterattack against Turkish forces and their Syrian proxies near Ras al-Ain\" on Tuesday and reported \"fierce combat\" in the west of the town as well as in Tal Abyad.\n\nSince launching their assault on October 9, Turkish-backed forces have secured more than 100 kilometres (60 miles) of border, but Ras al-Ain -- Siri Kani in Kurdish -- has held out.\n\nErdogan, who like Trump faces political difficulties at home, wants to create a buffer zone stretching 30 kilometres (20 miles) from the border into Syrian territory.\n\nTens of thousands of Syrian civilians have fled the fighting\n\nHe wants to destroy Kurdish hopes of an autonomous enclave that could serve as a launching pad for attacks in Turkey, as well as resettle some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees it is hosting.\n\n\"God willing, we will quickly secure the region stretching from Manbij to our border with Iraq,\" Erdogan said.\n\nThe offensive has killed dozens of civilians, mostly on the Kurdish side, and displaced at least 160,000 people.\n\n- Russia fills void -\n\nSyrian forces have returned to the region for the first time in years, raising their flag in Manbij as part of a deal with the Kurds.\n\nRussia said its military police were patrolling a zone separating regime and Turkish troops, in cooperation with Ankara.\n\nWith Trump's critics saying that he handed over US allies and stretches of Syria to Russia, the United States tried to play down Moscow's role.\n\n\"The number of Russians is very, very limited. But it only takes a few Russians with a big Russian flag to get everybody to pay attention,\" a senior administration official told reporters in Washington.\n\nMeanwhile, at least three French women escapees were \"retrieved\" by IS, according to messages they sent to their lawyer seen by AFP.\n\nAn SDF official on Twitter Tuesday said more IS relatives had tried and failed to escape the overcrowded camp of Al-Hol in eastern Syria.\n\nburs-er/wdb", "description": "Turkey remained defiant against mounting international pressure to curb its military offensive against Kurdish militants in Syria, raising tensions with...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/16/09/wire-19777716-1571213871-969_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
