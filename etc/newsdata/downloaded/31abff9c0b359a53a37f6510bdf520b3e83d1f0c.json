(AP) - Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ben Salango says he\u2019s divesting from the parent company of The Charleston Gazette-Mail ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nSalango told the newspaper on Tuesday that he is in the process of selling his shares of HD Media, which owns the Gazette-Mail, The Herald-Dispatch in Huntington and other newspapers in West Virginia.\n\nThe move comes after the state Republican party called for the news outlets to disclose Salango\u2019s stake in stories about the candidate. The Gazette-Mail story about Salango entering the race last week included a sentence about his investment in HD Media.\n\nSalango says owning part of the company as he runs for governor wouldn\u2019t be fair to its journalists, the public or other candidates. He owns less than 5% of HD Media.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Charleston Gazette-Mail, http://wvgazettemail.com.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ben Salango says he's divesting from the parent company of The Charleston Gazette-Mail ahead of the 2020 election.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
