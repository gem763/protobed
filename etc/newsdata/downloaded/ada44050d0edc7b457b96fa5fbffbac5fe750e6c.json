It also laid bare just how key a role Mulvaney has played in those dealings. Mulvaney admitted, for example, that Trump had spoken to him directly about an issue at the heart of Congress\u2019s impeachment inquiry: withholding aid to Ukraine partly because Trump wanted an investigation into a conspiracy theory involving a Democratic National Committee server.\n\nTrump was not happy\u2014and neither were his most prominent allies. The shock of Mulvaney\u2019s admission was only compounded by the flippancy with which he delivered it: For those troubled by it, he told reporters, \u201cget over it.\u201d Mulvaney later walked the claim back, but even in the eyes of the president\u2019s closest confidants, the damage was done. For a White House staffer, there is perhaps no worse place to be than in Sean Hannity\u2019s crosshairs, and that\u2019s where Mulvaney found himself yesterday, after undercutting the administration\u2019s talking points on impeachment in a way that not even a Trump-loving Fox News host could spin. Shortly after the press conference, Hannity excoriated the acting chief on his radio show: \u201cWhat is Mulvaney even talking about?\u201d Hannity scoffed. \u201cI just think he\u2019s dumb, I really do. I don\u2019t even think he knows what he\u2019s talking about. That\u2019s my take on it.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, in the course of combusting the White House\u2019s narrative on impeachment, Mulvaney unwittingly demonstrated why, at this fraught moment in Trump\u2019s presidency, he may be untouchable: Should Trump fire him and leave him aggrieved, Mulvaney could prove a damaging witness in Congress\u2019s impeachment investigation.\n\nA former White House official said Trump \u201cwill be feeling the pain of having pushed out [former National Security Adviser John] Bolton at a very inopportune time. He won\u2019t make the same mistake with Mulvaney, however frustrated he may be with him. Now, their interests are aligned. They sink or swim together.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a line of thinking that has come to permeate the West Wing, and it marks a significant shift in how Trump is beginning to view his relationship with his staffers. For the past two and a half years, the White House has operated like a radio perpetually set on scan, with Trump sampling staffer after staffer in search of those whose rhythms match his own. Indeed, as Mulvaney told us earlier this year, it\u2019s made for a West Wing whose atmosphere is dictated by one particular maxim: \u201cHe could fire any of us tomorrow.\u201d\n\nWith the backdrop of impeachment, however, some White House staffers could feel more secure in their jobs than even their boss\u2014and that\u2019s perhaps especially true of Mulvaney. As Democrats move forward in their investigation, they\u2019re looking for star witnesses, those officials in Trump\u2019s inner circle who could speak authoritatively as to whether Trump pressured a foreign power to open investigations into both the 2016 election and former Vice President Joe Biden. And should Trump discard an adviser in his preferred manner\u2014hastily announce the news on Twitter, then trash the person\u2019s reputation\u2014he or she may decide to become said star witness.", "description": "President Trump\u2019s third chief of staff seemed destined for the door until impeachment came along.", "authors": ["Elaina Plott", "Peter Nicholas"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/10/RTS2RLLY/facebook.jpg?1571412023", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
