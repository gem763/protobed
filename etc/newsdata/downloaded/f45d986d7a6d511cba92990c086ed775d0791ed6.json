Perversion of the law? How about just plain racist. SMDH,\u201d the tweet reads.\n\nGuyger, a white Dallas police officer, shot her African American neighbor Botham Jean in his own apartment on September 6, 2018, but claims in her defense that she mistakenly entered thinking she was in her own apartment, which was located one floor below Jean\u2019s.\n\nJudge Tammy Kemp announced Monday that the jury would be allowed to apply the Castle Doctrine in a final verdict on the case, as the defense has argued \u201ca mistake of fact,\u201d meaning Guyger erroneously believed she was defending her own home from an intruder.\n\nKemp, who is in her second term on the bench, is a black Democrat. She declined to be interviewed in the buildup to the trial, according to The Dallas Morning News, but made a name for herself by taking on difficult cases.\n\nGillum, who lost a Florida gubernatorial contest to Ron DeSantis last year despite a recount, made headlines last October when he called the Republican a \u201cracist\u201d during a debate and stated that DeSantis had \u201cneo-Nazis helping him out in this state.\u201d\n\nGillum lost the race by a mere 32,000 votes, but was dragged down by corruption scandals, including hosting a fundraiser sponsored by an undercover FBI agent. In August, prominent Democratic fundraiser John Morgan \u201cthreatened to sue\u201d if Gillum ran again, claiming the Democrat had sat on fundraising money and refused to return it after the race.\n\nMore from National Review", "description": "Andrew Gillum said Tuesday on Twitter that a decision by Judge Tammy Kemp to permit the use of the \u201cCastle Doctrine\u201d defense in the murder trial of former cop Amber Guyger was \u201cplain racist.\u201dGillum, the former Democratic mayor of Tallahasee, retweeted a CNN tweet explaining the Castle Doctrine and claimed", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BBboSW4ShJ5kZghSXsqjpQ--~B/aD01OTg7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/the_national_review_738/f7daed58c343b59cabff1a2551a41711"}
