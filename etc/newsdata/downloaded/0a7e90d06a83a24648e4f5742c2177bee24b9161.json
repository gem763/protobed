Martin and Jane Goldman, with both writing the story. It dealt with the transition in the fabled land of Westeros of the \"Age of Heroes\" to \"The Long Night\" that was often referenced in the TV series.\n\nREAD MORE: Everything we know about the Game of Thrones prequel so far\n\nThe publication reported that the pilot that was ordered in June 2018 suffered from \"lengthy post-production, which included re-editing of the initial cut after it was not well received\", as well as rumoured production problems around the filming in Northern Ireland where Game of Thrones was also done.\n\nThe cast and crew were told that HBO decided to pass on the possible series and HBO had no comment about the scrapped pilot series.\n\nIn a separate statement on Tuesday HBO announced that it has given a series order to House of the Dragon as a Game of Thrones' prequel series, with the announcement timed to coincide with Warner Media's media launch event and presentation of its new HBO Max video streaming service that will launch in May 2020 in the United States.\n\nHBO in its statement, says that House of the Dragon is based on the Game of Thrones companion book, Fire & Blood that is set 300 years before the events seen in the hit TV drama series.\n\nIt will tell the stories of previous Targaryen kings like Aegon the Conqueror, the first ruler of Westeros, and Aegon the Dragonbane, all of whom are ancestors of Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) and Jon Snow (Kit Harington).\n\nHouse of the Dragon is co-created by Ryan Condal and George R.R. Martin, with Ryan Condal and Miguel Sapochnik who will both serve as co-showrunners.\n\n#HouseOfTheDragon, a #GameofThrones prequel is coming to @HBO.\n\n\n\nThe series is co-created by @GRRMSpeaking and Ryan Condal. Miguel Sapochnik will partner with Condal as showrunner and will direct the pilot and additional episodes.
