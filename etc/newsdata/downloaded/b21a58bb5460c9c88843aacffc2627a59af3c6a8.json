I grew up with two deaf cousins & learned to sign at an early age . When my son was diagnosed w/A & had no language by 4 I had taught him to sign .. his first word was he pointed to a book - signed the word and said BOOK \u2014 a good day \u2014 Tame Hntr Beasley (@Tamehnter) October 19, 2019\n\n4.\n\nI remember that the consensus ~1980 was that newborns couldn't focus on anything for a few weeks or months or whatever. But I know what I saw when my daughter was 3 days old, giving me the side-eye. She was checking me out.
