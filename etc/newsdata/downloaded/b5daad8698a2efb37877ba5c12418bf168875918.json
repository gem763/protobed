It will enable the Army to modernize systems while simultaneously enhancing readiness.\"\n\nThe Army's new policy, an effort to realize certain top Army priorities such as readiness, modernization, and maintaining overmatch in a time of renewed great power competition with rival countries like China and Russia, \"will help the Army secure a competitive edge against near-peer adversaries,\" the Army said in a statement Friday.\n\nRyan McCarthy, then-nominee for Secretary of the US Army, at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee, September 12, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nThe service is looking at using new technology, such as robotics, artificial intelligence, sensors, digital networks, advanced materials, and 3D printing, among other things, to find new ways to produce products.\n\nThe Army aims to overcome the limitations of traditional manufacturing for improved product performance through the use of optimized designs with advanced materials that are both lighter and stronger and accelerated innovation through rapid prototyping.\n\nIn his September policy memorandum, McCarthy suggested that the Army work to transform industrial operations to not only increase efficiency and effectiveness but also achieve improved quality control, predictive maintenance, and automated supply management. Beyond the industrial base, he also sees this approach changing battlefield logistics with the possibility of on-demand fabrication of necessary products.\n\nThis is a service-wide initiative with a key focal point being the relatively new Army Futures Command, a four-star command dedicated to the quick development of future war-fighting technology, such as next-generation combat vehicles and long-range precision fires systems.\n\nThe secretary of the Army has directed Army Futures Command to \"establish and maintain collaborations within the defense industrial base, DoD engineering laboratories and centers, academia, and industry to ensure the integration of best practices in manufacturing.\"\n\nAs is, these types of connections have been of critical importance to the command.\n\nFor the time being, this is a preliminary policy announcement.\n\n\"We expect implementing guidance in the upcoming months,\" an Army spokesman told Business Insider on Friday. \"The policy is the first step.\"", "description": "The Army is changing how it manufactures to keep up with near-peer rivals.
