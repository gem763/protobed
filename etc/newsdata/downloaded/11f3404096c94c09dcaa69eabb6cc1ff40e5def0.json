Another alternative you can use is Pancetta.\n\nA top chef has revealed the secret to cooking the perfect spaghetti carbonara (stock image)\n\nChef Massimo Bianchi (pictured) said you need to eat the dish immediately after cooking so you get that smooth, velvety texture\n\nIn a large bowl, whisk together six egg yolks, three white eggs, Parmesan, Pecorino and black pepper.\n\nCook spaghetti in a large saucepan of salted water until al dente. Drain the pasta but reserve some cooking water.\n\nNext, quickly combine the spaghetti with the egg mixture, guanciale and a dash of extra-virgin olive oil. If the pasta is too dry, add the cooking water.\n\nSeason with salt and pepper. Bianchi said you should always eat the dish immediately after cooking.\n\nMany chefs have previously suggested eating carbonara fresh as you get that smooth, velvety texture. Reheating the dish leads to scrambled eggs.\n\nDespite its popularity, a survey by Barilla found 90 per cent of Australians are still making the same mistake by adding cream to the dish, when traditionally raw eggs are the key ingredient to create the creaminess.\n\nThe Roman-born chef has worked for some of Sydney's finest restaurants, including Buon Ricordo and Mosaic in the Westin Hotel.\n\nThe top chef said all you need is five main ingredients - guanciale, eggs, spaghetti, Parmesan and Pecorino cheese (stock image)\n\nLast year, former MasterChef contestant Justine Schofield shared her favourite go-to recipe to create the deliciously authentic carbonara at home.\n\nSpeaking to Daily Mail Australia, Schofield revealed her recipe uses just four ingredients - spaghetti, pancetta, egg yolks and pecorino.\n\nShe starts by cooking the spaghetti in a large pot of salted boiling water.\n\nNext, she fries pancetta or bacon without oil in a large hot pan for two minutes. Meanwhile, she mixes four egg yolks and pecorino in a bowl.\n\nWhile straining the al dente pasta, she puts aside a little of the water for later. She then tosses the pasta in the pan of pancetta. Next, she takes the pan off the heat and add two tablespoons of the reserved cooking water.\n\nShe adds the egg mixture and freshly cracked pepper before tossing the pasta again until all is coated in the yolky mixture and it becomes glossy.\n\nFinish with the remaining pecorino and serve immediately.", "description": "Italian chef\u00a0Massimo Bianchi has revealed the secret to cooking the perfect spaghetti carbonara every time.", "authors": ["Cindy Tran For Daily Mail Australia"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/30/00/20354832-0-image-a-43_1572396494155.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
