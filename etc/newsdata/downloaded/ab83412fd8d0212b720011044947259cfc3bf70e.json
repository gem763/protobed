Nathan Rousseau Smith has the story. Buzz60\n\nCEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa \u2014 Former Vice President Joe Biden defended his record on LGBTQ issues amidst sharp questioning at a campaign forum on the topic Friday where a female moderator said he condescendingly called her \u201ca real sweetheart\u201d after their question-and-answer session.\n\nBiden has frequently boasted on the campaign trail of his track record on LGBTQ rights\u2014 he was ahead of President Obama in endorsing the right to same-sex marriage \u2014but seemed taken aback by questioning on stage at the forum sponsored by the advocacy group GLAAD.\n\nThe moderator for his session, Cedar Rapids Gazette columnist Lyz Lenz, asked Biden early in their conversation about his past votes for the Defense of Marriage Act, the military\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy that forbade openly gay people from serving and his statement earlier this year that Vice President Mike Pence, known for his socially conservative positions, was \u201ca decent guy.\u201d\n\n\"You're a lovely person,\" Biden replied drolly.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden laughs after a question by Lyz Lenz, columnist for The Gazette, as he speaks at an LGBTQ Presidential Forum in the Sinclair Auditorium on the Coe College campus in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Friday, Sept. 20, 2019. (Photo: Rebecca F. Miller, AP)\n\n\"Just asking the questions that people want to know,\" Lenz responded.\n\nAfter the session, Lenz said as she walked off stage Biden dryly remarked to her that she was \u201ca real sweetheart.\u201d She told USA TODAY that she found the Democratic presidential frontrunner\u2019s remark condescending.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s 2019, you shouldn\u2019t be calling women sweethearts,\u201d Lenz said.\n\nUkraine: Joe Biden: Trump's reported effort to get Ukraine president to investigate him 'abhorrent'\n\nImpeachment: \u2018Was this hearing a hot mess? Sure.\u2019 Democrats weighing Trump\u2019s impeachment face roadblocks at every turn\n\nCarson gets flack from Dems: Julian Castro, other Democrats criticize Ben Carson after reported comments on transgender people\n\nCLOSE Every good ally should know these LGBTQ+ terms. USA TODAY\n\nBiden campaign officials declined to comment on the exchange.\n\nDuring his back-and-forth on stage with Lenz, who has expressed her preference for Democrats to nominate a female presidential candidate, Biden attempted to spotlight that he was ahead of the curve among politicians in his backing of same-sex marriage.\n\nThe former vice president also repeated an oft told story about his father underscoring acceptance when he was a teen and saw two men kiss at the town square.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Joey, it\u2019s simple,\u2019 \u201d Biden said. \u201cThey love each other. That\u2019s the only question\u201d\n\nBiden\u2019s vote in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996 \u2014 which barred the U.S. government from recognizing same-sex unions for the purpose of determining eligibility for federal benefits \u2014 came amidst a heated election season when the Republican majority in Congress looking to paint then President Clinton and Democrats as out of stop with public sentiment.\n\nAt the time, public sentiment was strongly opposed to same sex marriage with 68% of American public opposed and 27% supporting it, according to Gallup.\n\nIn 1992, Biden have voted to table an amendment which would \u201cprohibit the District of Columbia from using any funds ... to extend employment, health or governmental benefits to homosexual or heterosexual couples on the same basis that such benefits are extended to legally married couples.\u201d\n\nIn 2004 and 2006, Biden helped defeat an effort in the Senate to impose a Constitutional Amendment that would defined marriage as a union only consisting of a man and woman.\n\nAt the time of the passage Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell \u2014 which was introduced by openly gay Rep. Barney Frank in 1993 \u2014 the legislation was seen as a compromise measure that would allow gays to serve in the military. The statute was eventually repealed in 2010.\n\nBiden previously has clarified that when he referred to Pence as a \u201cdecent guy\u201d during a speech in Omaha earlier this year, he was trying to make the point in a foreign policy context.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been a strong, strong advocate,\u201d Biden said at the Cedar Rapids forum. \u201cMy son Beau \u2014 the one who is deceased \u2014 set up the Beau Biden foundation to deal with children who are abused and gay and lesbian children and transgender children. He passed the first transgender (rights) law in Delaware, as attorney general, to make sure there was in fact no discrimination and so on. I am very proud of my record.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2019/09/21/joe-biden-lgbtq-forum-tense-exchange/2400830001/", "description": "After the session,writer Lyz Lenz said as she walked off stage Biden dryly remarked to her that she was \u201ca real sweetheart.\u201d", "authors": ["Aamer Madhani", "Published A.M.
