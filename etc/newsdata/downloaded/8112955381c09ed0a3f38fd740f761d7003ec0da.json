It is a masterpiece \u2013 and she is a hero.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut not everyone saw it that way. In fact, a lot of people seemed to identify so strongly with the identity of \u2018customer\u2019 that they took it as a personal attack.\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\n\u2018Not a great advert for Tesco,\u2019 some sniped, as though that was ever Jade\u2019s intention.\n\nSeveral people even directly tagged Tesco in the post, asking why they employed her.\n\nThankfully, Jade didn\u2019t lose her job, because it turns out she had already left the company several months prior. But lots of people wanted her to get fired.\n\nWe don\u2019t know how Tesco would have responded if Jade had still been working for them, but the whole thing raises some disturbing questions about the relationship between social media and the workplace.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to predict which posts will go viral and the potential fallout if they do. Most of us have posted stupid things on social media, without ever imagining it will get back to our bosses.\n\nBut sometimes it does, and sometimes it\u2019s a problem.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake Angela Gibbins, for instance, who last year lost her job at the British Council after accusing Prince George of being a symbol of \u2018white privilege\u2019.\n\nCommenting on Facebook, Gibbins wrote: \u2018White privilege. That cheeky grin is the (already locked-in) innate knowledge that he\u2019s Royal, rich, advantaged, and will never know any difficulties or hardships in life.\n\n\u2018Let\u2019s find photos of 3yo Syrian refugee children and see if they look alike, eh.\u2019\n\nNot only was she fired for this post, she lost a subsequent attempt to appeal the decision.\n\nAnother high-profile example in recent years was Justine Sacco who lost her job as a PR executive after tweeting an AIDS joke on a long-haul flight to South Africa: \u2018Going to Africa. Hope I don\u2019t get AIDS. Just Kidding. I\u2019m white!\u2019\n\nHer tweet went viral while she was still in the air, meaning the whole world knew that she\u2019d lost her job before she found out \u2013 an eventuality which was eagerly anticipated with the hashtag #hasjustinelandedyet.\n\nBut you don\u2019t have to cause an international scandal to get in hot water as a result of your social media presence. It\u2019s now a common workplace occurrence, to varying degrees of severity.\n\nTo find out more about this disturbing phenomenon, we spoke to a bunch of people who have been fired, or narrowly avoided it, for stuff they posted online \u2013 some more innocuous than others.\n\nScott\n\n\u2018I used to work for a shoe shop in their warehouse on Sundays. Once I asked for the weekend off so I could go to a music festival.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They said no because everyone else had asked for that weekend off, too. So I pulled a sicky and went anyway, but not before having a pretty detailed rant about it on Twitter which included the company name \u2013 \u201cf*** ___\u201d.\n\n\u2018After I got back from the festival, I received a letter through the door informing me I was being pulled in for an investigatory meeting, as a result of posts on social media. I called up HR to see what they had, and had to listen to them read all of my tweets aloud.\n\n\u2018I realised I was bang to rights and handed in my resignation\u2026 I was not required to work my notice.\u2019\n\nLuke\n\n\u2018Once I got in trouble because I\u2019d just started a new PR job and someone asked me on Twitter how it was. I replied \u201cNot too shabby\u201d \u2013 you know, about as British an answer as you could get. It\u2019s not even negative.\n\n\u2018But I was hauled into the managing director\u2019s office the next morning and given a b*llocking. They warned that this could paint the agency in a negative light \u2013 which made me realise I didn\u2019t want to work for them.\u2019\n\nAli\n\n\u2018I got fired from a low-level social marketing job when I erroneously posted something funny I found in the staff fridge: a Marmite and Mango smoothie (which was a publicity stunt for April Fools\u2019 day).\n\n\u2018I later realised it was embargoed by the PR company we rented our office from, and subsequently, a big newspaper pulled out of an exclusive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018They didn\u2019t sack me straight away, though: I got the news at Heathrow airport after returning from my honeymoon.\u2019\n\nGemma\n\n\u2018A colleague at my old job logged into my work computer and found my Twitter, which was completely anonymous at the time. I mean, the avi was a picture of Pingu.\n\n\u2018Anyway, he decided to collate a little montage of my most damning tweets for our bosses to see.\n\n\u2018It was stuff about how I\u2019d been drunk at work and also some incredibly vague and harmless comments I\u2019d made about a project we\u2019d worked on.\n\n\u2018They fired me, and the worst thing was that it happened at a particularly vulnerable time.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m fine now but at the time I had so many tweets about being depressed and suicidal, which my colleague must have read and still decided he wanted to get me fired.\n\n\u2018Some people are truly dickheads.\u2019\n\nWhat you post online can come back to bite you (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nPayzee\n\n\u2018A few years ago, while I was working for a record label, I\u2019d been taking the piss out of my best friend on Twitter, when my manager rang me and asked me to explain my tweets.\n\n\u2018They were rather crude but also, at the end of the day, personal jokes between me and my friend. My boss was really angry about it and called me into a meeting.\n\n\u2018I got in serious trouble and had to discuss every single one of my tweets (which contained words like \u201cdick\u201d \u2013 among other things).\u2019\n\nThe sad thing is, if you do get in trouble at work for a social media post, you probably don\u2019t have a leg to stand on.\n\nThese days most job contracts have a clause related to social media conduct and prohibitions against bringing the company into disrepute, which can be applied extremely elastically.\n\nPaddy O\u2019Connell, a data protection and media lawyer with Wiggin LLP, tells Metro.co.uk: \u2018Whilst many people assume their social media activity is private and separate from their work and essentially none of their employer\u2019s concern, you can definitely get fired as a result of social media posts.\u2019\n\nPaddy says that it\u2019s hard to specify exactly what to avoid, as companies operate to different standards: \u2018The important thing is to make sure you carefully read your employer\u2019s policies on social media use and avoid anything that would contravene them.\u2019\n\nWhat about if you have been fired? Do you have any recourse? Paddy tells us: \u2018If this happens, you should check your companies staff privacy notice and any other relevant policies to ensure that you were made aware that this type of monitoring would occur\u2019.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s boring advice but it\u2019s best to err on the side of caution. My mum, having stumbled across my Twitter, once sent me the ominous message: \u2018you need to remember that anyone can read this. You\u2019re not down the pub having a cosy chat with your friends.\u2019\n\nAs annoying as this was \u2013 she was probably right.\n\nMORE: Aldi is selling a Cuthbert the Caterpillar cake and yes, M&S knows about it\n\nMORE: No woman with big breasts is ever asking for attention \u2013 believe me\n\nMORE: 17 women tell us about their worst oral sex experiences\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "A look at the implications of getting in trouble at work, or fired, as a result of social media posts.", "authors": ["James Greig"], "top_image": "https://i2.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/tesco_1570892186.png?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&ssl=1", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
