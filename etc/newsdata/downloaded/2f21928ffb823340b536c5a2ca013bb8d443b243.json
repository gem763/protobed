Despite his hardline international reputation, Netanyahu is extremely cautious when it comes to the use of force. Yet, in the span of 24 hours late last month, Israeli aircraft reportedly struck Iranian-affiliated targets in Syria, Lebanon and Iraq.\n\nIn recent years Israel has admitted openly to launching hundreds of strikes inside Syria to forestall what officials here call Iran\u2019s \u201cmilitary entrenchment\u201d in its war-torn neighbor: Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps personnel, Shiite militia fighters, and advanced weaponry like precision guided missiles. Such Israeli military action\u2014officially termed the \u201ccampaign between wars,\u201d since it\u2019s intended to shear Iranian power ahead of any wider conflict\u2014has now extended into Lebanon and Iraq.\n\nHow do we know this? Because Netanyahu confirmed it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m doing everything to protect the security of our country from all directions\u2014from the north against Lebanon and [the pro-Iranian militia] Hezbollah, in Syria against Iran and Hezbollah, and unfortunately also in Iraq against Iran,\u201d Netanyahu said on August 30 during a Facebook live chat with supporters, days after the reported strikes in those three countries.\n\nA \u201csenior Israeli defense source,\u201d likely Netanyahu himself (who currently also doubles as defense minister), repeated similar claims a few days later to local military reporters. Indeed, the Israeli military has been extremely expansive in recent weeks detailing Iran\u2019s efforts to arm Hezbollah with precision guided missiles on Lebanese soil. A drone attack in Beirut, in the heart of Hezbollah\u2019s Dahiyeh stronghold, reportedly targeted high-value equipment meant to upgrade the Lebanese militia\u2019s arsenal. Here, too, the military briefed reporters on the exact details of what allegedly was hit.\n\n\u201c Israel\u2019s usual policy of \u2018purposeful ambiguity\u2019 declines to take responsibility when something mysteriously blows up across the border\u2014thus sparing its enemies\u2019 blushes so as to avoid pushing them towards a response. \u201d\n\nThis was all a sharp break from Israel\u2019s usual policy of \u201cpurposeful ambiguity,\u201d wherein it declines to take responsibility when something mysteriously blows up across the border\u2014thus sparing its enemies\u2019 blushes so as to avoid pushing them towards a response. (A limited response ultimately did come on September 1 in the form of a cross-border Hezbollah attack on an Israeli army jeep.)\n\nTo be clear: not even Netanyahu\u2019s harshest domestic critics allege that, mere weeks before an election, he\u2019s purposefully pushing the country into war. As The Daily Beast reported in February, there is widespread consensus that Iranian proxies armed with upgraded precision guided missiles are a severe threat to the country\u2019s security, now deemed second only to Iran\u2019s possible pursuit of a nuclear weapon. Most Netanyahu critics even accept the official position that the timing for these strikes was due to Iran\u2019s escalating efforts in this area (primarily recent inroads in Iraq and Lebanon).\n\nWhat they do take issue with, however, is Netanyahu\u2019s non-stop public rhetoric after the fact\u2014verging on a Middle Eastern \u201cend zone dance\u201d in the face of Iran and Hezbollah\u2014that could lead to deadlier follow-up attacks and a wider conflagration. Israel until recently used to speak softly and carry a big stick, which it deployed to great effect against Iran and its regional proxies. Netanyahu is now publicly trading insults with Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and IRGC Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who have vowed to respond in kind.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s chief rival, Benny Gantz, head of the Blue and White party, has strongly supported the government\u2019s regional policy against Iran. Yet even he called into question the increasing \u201ctalk and breaking of the [prior] ambiguity,\u201d saying Netanyahu is trying to \u201cscore political points\u201d off of the national security debate.\n\nRon Ben-Yishai, the dean of Israel\u2019s military correspondents going back five decades, told The Daily Beast that even a prime minister-cum-defense minister doesn\u2019t plan operations, the motivating force for which is usually the military and Mossad, Israel\u2019s foreign intelligence agency.\n\nNetanyahu, Ben-Yishai said, \u201cwouldn\u2019t launch an operation because of an election, and the army chief of staff isn\u2019t a servant of any prime minister\u2026 but the talk [surrounding it] is without doubt political.\u201d\n\nThe danger of all this talk, Ben-Yishai added, is that it\u2019s like \u201cpoking [Iran in] the eye. Especially in the Middle East, the issue of honor could lead to a response.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, after years burnishing his reputation as Israel\u2019s \u201cMr. Security,\u201d an election campaign dominated by military crises could help Netanyahu with his base and the many undecided voters.\n\nBut part of the audience for all this mounting \u201cblather,\u201d as some have termed it, may in fact be farther afield.\n\n\u201c Iran is working on a broad front to carry out murderous terrorist attacks against the State of Israel. \u201d \u2014 Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\n\nThe same weekend that Israel was bombing across the Levant, President Donald Trump was at the G-7 summit in France, where he indicated a willingness to meet with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani to resolve the impasse over Iran\u2019s nuclear program. A short while after Trump made positive comments about Iran, Netanyahu issued a video where he reminded the world (including, presumably, the U.S. president) of where he stood on the issue.\n\n\u201cIran is working on a broad front to carry out murderous terrorist attacks against the State of Israel,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cIsrael will continue to defend its security however that may be necessary. I call on the international community to act immediately so that Iran halts these attacks.\u201d\n\nAs Axios reported, Netanyahu was unable to reach Trump by telephone during the G-7 summit. In the following days the Israeli prime minister had calls with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Vice President Mike Pence \u2013 but tellingly not with Trump.\n\nA snap visit to London last week, primarily to meet with U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, likely failed to console the Israeli leader.\n\n\u201cIran,\u201d Esper said, \u201cwas inching toward that place where we could have talks.\u201d Senior British officials with whom Netanyahu met were also inclined to support a French-led diplomatic process. Israeli defense officials reportedly are convinced that a Trump-Rouhani summit is now a \u201cdone deal.\u201d\n\nTrump on Tuesday reiterated his openness to meeting with the Iranian leader, despite Netanyahu just hours earlier revealing what he claimed was a secret Iranian nuclear weapons facility (another cynical use, many Israeli analysts observed, of sensitive intelligence for political gain.) Earlier on Tuesday, Trump fired his ultra-hawkish national security advisor, John Bolton, saying he \u201cdisagreed strongly with many of his suggestions.\u201d\n\nA lot is riding on whether Netanyahu can maintain U.S. support for his hard line against Iran and its proxies\u2014not least his own political future.\n\nIsraelis will again go to the polls on September 17 after Netanyahu failed to form a government in the wake of the original April ballot. According to the polls, Netanyahu is once more in a very tight race for re-election. He has in recent weeks seemingly stopped at nothing to ensure that his now 10-year reign (thirteen overall dating back to the 1990s) continues.\n\nMassive banners of Netanyahu and Trump shaking hands adorn tall office buildings and billboards across the country, underlining the premier\u2019s close relationship with the U.S. president and his overall image as a global statesman (including taking credit for the American withdrawal from the Obama-era nuclear deal). Both points would be severely undercut if there were, in fact, a U.S.-Iran rapprochement.\n\nJust as he\u2019s attacked Iran across the region, Netanyahu with equal vigor has gone after his perceived domestic enemies. He has called for a boycott of the country\u2019s most popular television station\u2014Channel 12\u2014because it has deigned to publish extensive leaks from inside the myriad investigations of Netanyahu\u2019s alleged corruption. \u201cA terror attack against democracy,\u201d the prime minister termed it. The channel\u2019s legal correspondent, Guy Peleg, now travels with bodyguards.\n\nMore perniciously, in a Trumpian twist, Netanyahu in the last week has railed constantly against voter fraud among Israel\u2019s Arab minority, alleging that irregularities in this demographic cost him and his right-wing allies victory in April. \u201cThe problem of fraud and theft of the elections is real. We will not allow the coming elections to be stolen,\u201d Netanyahu said, priming his supporters to reject the outcome of next week\u2019s poll if it doesn\u2019t go their way.\n\nNo matter that the Central Elections Committee, police, attorney general, and other neutral observers say no such fraud actually took place and reject Netanyahu\u2019s demand that cameras be placed in polling stations. Israeli President Reuven Rivlin called the allegations \u201cunsubstantiated and even irresponsible political attacks\u201d intended to \u201cundermine public trust in these [electoral] bodies.\u201d\n\nIt seems that Netanyahu is willing to attack the very foundations of Israeli democracy, and again incite against the country\u2019s Arab minority in order to galvanize his nationalist base. It\u2019s a well-worn tactic Netanyahu has deployed in the past\u2014the so-called Gevalt campaign, Yiddish for \u201calarm.\u201d\n\n\u201cGevalt is always real and Netanyahu is a panicker to begin with, which is probably what makes him so effective [as a politician],\u201d Tal Shalev, Walla News\u2019 chief political correspondent, told The Daily Beast. \u201cHe\u2019s never calm.\u201d Yet Shalev, a keen Netanyahu-watcher who traveled with him to London, said that despite the public hysteria purposefully sown, the prime minister seemed calm, confident and in a good mood in recent days.\n\nThere\u2019s a contrast between what he\u2019s broadcasting to those around him and what he\u2019s saying publicly, she added. \u201cBut he\u2019s acting a bit more ruthless than usual now, and breaking all the rules, due to the situation he\u2019s in. It\u2019s a battle for the rest of his life.\u201d\n\nWithout his right-wing bloc of parties winning an outright majority of 61 seats in the Knesset, Netanyahu could be finished politically\u2014and then there are his looming corruption indictments, with a pre-trial hearing set for early next month.\n\nA former ally on the right, Avigdor Lieberman, has turned against him, forcing the repeat election in the first place and now demanding a national unity government with Blue and White\u2014which the latter refuse to countenance so long as the legally compromised Netanyahu still heads the Likud party. The political machinations after September 17 could be even more extreme than the election campaign itself.\n\nYet there\u2019s another possibility, perhaps even more likely, that against all the odds, and all these enemies\u2014some real, most manufactured\u2014Netanyahu actually wins outright.\n\nThe polls aren\u2019t looking favorable, but it\u2019s important to recall that in the April ballot, a small right-wing faction was only 1400 votes short (out of 4 million cast) of entering parliament and thereby giving Netanyahu his majority. Last time, too, the right-wing essentially threw away six to eight seats via parties that didn\u2019t pass the electoral threshold, a scenario now mitigated by a recent Netanyahu pact with a far-right faction that pulled out of the election.\n\nA source in Blue and White told The Daily Beast that the current polls, both public and internal, were very consistent\u2014a Netanyahu victory isn\u2019t a done deal. \u201cThis is going to be close, and will come down to the last few days,\u201d he vowed.\n\nWith the margins so fine, Netanyahu is pushing Israel to the very edge.", "description": "He\u2019s bragging about attacks in Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq, dissing Arab citizens and the press, and promising to annex much of the West Bank.
