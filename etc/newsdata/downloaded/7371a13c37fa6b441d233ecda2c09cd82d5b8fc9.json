On the eve of this year's World Economic Forum, the renowned naturalist told the audience that the worlds of business and politics should \"get on with the practical solutions\" needed to prevent environmental damage. \"As a species we are expert problem solvers. But we've not yet applied ourselves to this problem with the focus it requires. \"We can create a world with clean air and water, unlimited energy, and fish stocks that will sustain us well into the future. But to do that, we need a plan,\" he said. The broadcaster made his speech after receiving a Crystal Award, which is awarded by the forum to \"exceptional cultural leaders\". AFP/Getty 2/8 At least 60% of wild coffee species face extinction triggered by climate change and disease Two decades of research have revealed that 60 per cent of the world\u2019s coffee species face extinction due to the combined threats of deforestation, disease and climate change. The wild strain of arabica, the most widely consumed coffee on the planet, is among those now recognised as endangered, raising concerns about its long-term survival. These results are worrying for the millions of farmers around the world who depend on the continued survival of coffee for their livelihoods. As conditions for coffee farming become tougher, scientists predict the industry will need to rely on wild varieties to develop more resilient strains Alan Schaller 3/8 Warming Antarctic waters are speeding the rate at which glaciers are melting The Antarctic ice sheet is losing six times as much ice each year as it was in the 1980s and the pace is accelerating, one of the most comprehensive studies of climate change effects on the continent has shown. More than half an inch has been added to global sea levels since 1979, but if current trends continue it will be responsible for metres more in future, the Nasa-funded study found. The international effort used aerial photos, satellite data and climate models dating back to the 1970s across18 Antarctic regions to get the most complete picture to date on the impacts of the changing climate. It found that between 1979 and 1990 Antarctica lost an average of 40 gigatonnes (40 billion tonnes) of its mass each year. Between 2009 and 2017 it lost an average 252 gigatonnes a year. This has added 3.6mm per decade to sea levels, or around 14mm since 1979, the study shows Nasa/Getty 4/8 Greater Manchester to ban fracking, paving way for confrontation with government over controversial industry Greater Manchester is to effectively ban fracking, raising the prospect of fresh confrontation with the government over the controversial industry. All of the region\u2019s 10 councils are to implement planning policies which create a \u201cpresumption\u201d against drilling for shale gas in their areas, Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has announced.

Critics of fracking say it poses environmental and health risks. Drilling at the UK\u2019s only operational fracking site, run by Cuadrilla in Lancashire, has repeatedly been halted due to earth tremors.

Chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga said his nation would leave the International Whaling Commission (IWC) to resume hunting the marine mammals in Japanese waters. However, he stated the activity would be limited to Japan\u2019s territory and the 200 mile exclusive economic zone along its coasts.

Activists cautiously welcomed elements of the plan, saying \u201cimportant progress\u201d had been made on ensuring that efforts to tackle climate change by individual nations can be measured and compared. But environmental groups were also highly critical of the agreement, warning it lacked ambition and clarity on key issues, including financing for climate projects for developing countries.
