Khloe Kardashian worked a very thigh-high pair of boots in Malibu\n\nAlong with a pair of skin tight leggings and an alligator print jacket, Khloe was the picture of cool.\n\nEven her long nails were polished in black.\n\nKhloe managed to soften up the look with a head full of loose, romantic curls.\n\nThe reality star was walking like a model on the runway as she strutted towards the beachfront restaurant.\n\nCurl power! She managed to soften up the edgy style with a head full of romantic ringlets\n\nKhloe appeared alone, and without her precious one-year-old daughter True.\n\nThe star shares the child with her ex-boyfriend Tristan Thompson, who she split with earlier this year after multiple cheating scandals.\n\nIn spite of all the heartache, Khloe says she has no desire to come between Tristan and their daughter.\n\nWalk this way! Khloe's black leggings left little to the imagination\n\n'It's hard, it's not easy for me. It would be easier for me to keep my daughter away and be like, \"No, 'cause you hurt me,\"' Khloe said on a recent episode of Jay Shetty's On Purpose podcast.\n\n'But, he never hurt True, him and I have our own relationship, and then Tristan and True have theirs. And I will never come in-between that, I don't believe in that.'\n\nKhloe says she learned a lot about co-parenting from her parents, Kris Jenner and Robert Kardashian, who divorced in 1991 after 13 years of marriage.\n\n'I attest that to my parents, [who] were incredible co-parenters, from what I know. My mum and my dad, I'm sure, fought all the time, not around us.'", "description": "Rocking an exceptionally high pair of leather boots, the reality star, 35, was serving some serious edge while heading to lunch at\u00a0Malibu Farm Pier Cafe.
