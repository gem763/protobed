Richard Blumenthal (Conn.) and Sheldon Whitehouse Sheldon WhitehouseDemocrats introduce 'THUG Act' to block funding for G-7 at Trump resort The Hill's Morning Report - Tempers boil over at the White House Democrats urge Rick Perry not to roll back lightbulb efficiency rules MORE (R.I.).\n\n\u201cMr. Trump is unashamed of his corruption,\u201d Frankel said in a statement. \u201cHe is abusing the office of the Presidency and violating law by directing millions of dollars of American and foreign money to his family enterprises by holding an important meeting of world leaders at his Doral resort.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis contempt for the Constitution and American people seems boundless in profiting from his office through payments from foreign governments,\" Blumenthal added. \"Our Founding Fathers are rolling over in their graves. Congress must act to stop this plain craven abuse of power and corruption.\"\n\nThe legislation also would require Trump to provide Congress with any documents related to his decision to host the event at his property. The measure is unlikely to be taken up in the GOP-controlled Senate.\n\nMulvaney said the Doral property was one of 12 that was under consideration and that it was ultimately chosen in part because of its proximity to airports, landing zones and hospitals. The acting chief of staff dismissed criticism that the property\u2019s selection violates the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution, which prohibits presidents from accepting payments from foreign countries, U.S. states or the federal government.\n\n\"I get the criticisms. So does [Trump]\u2026 but no, there\u2019s no issue here on him profiting from this in any way, shape or form,\" Mulvaney said. \"If you think it's going to help his brand, that's great, but I would suggest that he doesn't need much help promoting his brand.\"", "description": "Democrats introduced legislation Friday that would block federal funding for next year\u2019s Group of Seven (G-7) summit at Trump National Doral Miami.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/article_images/doral.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
