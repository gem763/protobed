He\u2019s a really good guy, really fast, really talented,\u201d added the Frenchman of the 31-year-old reigning champion in Japan\u2019s Super Formula and Super GT series.\n\nThe thousands of spectators lining the circuit had plenty of chance to see their hero as he completed 30 laps \u2014 more than any other driver \u2014 and finished 17th fastest in the session.", "description": "Suzuka (Japan) (AFP) \u2013 Valtteri Bottas was quickest Friday in practice before the Japanese Grand Prix locked down ahead of an approaching super", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/wi/afp/11/9ba656_valtteri-bottas-mercedes-teammate-lewis-hamilton-comfortably-pack-bottas-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
