The plane was forced to land at Kansas City International Airport after a passenger became combative. His actions were sparked after he was allegedly told he could not use the bathroom in the first class section of the aircraft, according to DailyMail.com, which added that the man reportedly went as far as trying to enter the cockpit.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration did not immediately return FOX Business' request for comment.\n\nAfter landing in Kansas City, the passenger, who has yet to be identified, was taken into custody by law enforcement, the airline said. The flight then continued on to Los Angeles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nThis comes amid Congress considering a sweeping tally of proposals that could affect airline travelers. Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, is working to bring his panel's bill for a five-year reauthorization to the Senate floor after the current law authorizing operations of the Federal Aviation Administration expires on Sept. 30.\n\nThe House passed its version of the same bill in April. Among the provisions in the two bills is a section highlighting disruptive passengers.\n\nThe House bill would let airline employees block passengers from going through security screening or getting on a plane if the employee accuses them of verbal or physical assault. Passengers would be held up until police could sort things out. A union that represents airline employees lobbied for the provision.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "description": "A flight from New York to Los Angeles made an abrupt pit stop Thursday after a passenger allegedly\u00a0threatened the safety of the aircraft.", "authors": ["Daniella Genovese"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2018/02/0/0/alaska-airlines.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
