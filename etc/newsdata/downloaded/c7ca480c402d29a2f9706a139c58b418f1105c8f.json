Both have been identified as priority spending areas in the draft budget.\n\nAssuming an average cereals harvest of 7 million tonnes and an oil barrel price at 67 dollars, growth is expected to stand at 3.7% in 2020 from 2.9% in 2019.\n\nThe central bank and the International Monetary fund however, have said the economy would only grow by 2.7% this year on the back of a lower cereals yield due to a lack of rainfall.\n\nThe draft budget introduces tax incentives to encourage the declaration of assets and the repatriation of cash in foreign currency, aiding Moroccan banks which have been hit by falling deposits this year and bolster the tax base in line with the government goal to bolster revenue.\n\nThe government plans to continue clearing the stock of value added tax repayments by releasing next year 10 billion dirhams owed to public and private enterprises. Morocco\u2019s Doing Business ranking rose from 128 in 2010 to 60 in 2019.\n\nPublic investment would increase to 198 billion dirhams in 2020, from 195 billion this year.", "description": "Morocco's fiscal deficit is expected to be unchanged at 3.5% of gross domestic product in 2020, the government\u2019s draft budget showed.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
