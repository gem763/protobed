At an estimated $30 trillion cost over 10 years, the plan, as outlined in a bill by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) that is supported by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), comes with a hefty price tag.\n\nTo illustrate the high cost, Biden said that eliminating the U.S. defense budget would pay for four months of Medicare-for-all. It\u2019s unclear how he did his math, and his campaign did not immediately provide a breakdown.\n\nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates $7 trillion in defense spending from 2019 to 2028. That\u2019s about one-fifth of the cost of Medicare-for-all over 10 years. It suggests that \u2014 all else being equal \u2014 defunding the military would cover two years, not four months, of the cost of Medicare-for-all. But with such a sweeping and intricate plan, it\u2019s difficult to devise a solid estimate, and it\u2019s unlikely that defunding the military completely would ever come to pass.", "description": "\u201cIf you eliminated the entire Pentagon, every single thing\u00a0\u2014 planes, ship, troop, the buildings, everything, satellites \u2014 it would pay for a total of four months [of Medicare-for-all].\u201d", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/pbox.php?url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/arc-washpost-wordpress-uploads/primetime/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2019/10/15183205/AFP_1LF9S5.jpg&w=1484&op=resize&opt=1&filter=antialias&t=20170517", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
