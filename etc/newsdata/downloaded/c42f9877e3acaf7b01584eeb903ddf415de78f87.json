The Kurdish-dominated Syrian Democratic Forces, who fought America\u2019s war against Isis, had agreed to Washington\u2019s demands to dismantle some defensive positions along the border with Turkey, ultimately leaving them as exposed when some US troops pulled back.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

El-Dini warned of \u201cthe vacuum and uncertainty under Trump.\u201d\n\nIn Kuwait, Abdullah al-Shayji, an MP, was more acerbic.\n\n\u201cHe threw them under the bus!\u201d he wrote in a flurry of energetic Tweets condemning Mr Trump\u2019s decision. \u201cThis is how America gives up its allies who fought Isis: Another bitter lesson for all America\u2019s allies!\u2019\n\nArguably the most worried was Israel, one the US\u2019s most strategic allies in the region. US-Israel relations have been watertight since Trump took office and made a slew of controversial decisions that pleased Israel, including recognising Jerusalem as the country\u2019s capital.\n\nBut on Monday, Israeli media revealed that its officials were blindsided by the fact they had not been informed or consulted by the Trump administration about such a drastic move, despite the close intelligence-sharing cooperation they enjoy.\n\nWhile Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu kept diplomatically quiet on the matter, Israeli MP and former education minister Naftali Bennett went as far as to say a prayer for the Kurdish people on Twitter.\n\nHe added: \u201cThe lesson for Israel is simple. Israel will ALWAYS defend itself by itself.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

He doesn\u2019t listen to advice. He doesn\u2019t acknowledge the facts and the intelligence, he works on impulse and is isolationist.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can we depend on Trump in the long term?\u201d he asked.\n\nIn Egypt, a country which receives millions of dollars in US military and economic aid every year, newspapers stuck to quoting the uproar emanating from the US.\n\nBut Egyptian analyst Timothy Kaldas, a non-resident fellow at the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, said behind closed doors it would be worrying many.\n\n\u201cIt reflected a broader trend of Trump not valuing allies while being generally unreliable,\u201d he told The Independent.\n\n\u201cThis will be another reminder to anyone doing business with the United States to doubt the integrity of US commitments,\u201d he added.", "description": "The shock waves from president Donald Trump\u2019s surprise announcement that US troops in northern Syria would step aside and allow a Turkish offensive to obliterate its\u00a0long-term Kurdish partners, rippled out of Washington and shook America\u2019s allies across the region.", "authors": ["Bel Trew"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/07/16/turkey-syria-0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
