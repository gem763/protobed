You see four different pitchers,\u201d Red Sox manager Alex Cora said. \u201cWe\u2019re just in a position right now that we know that we have to do this.\u201d\n\nBrett Gardner homered for AL East-leading New York, which lost for just the third time in 11 games. The Yankees lead atop the East dropped to 8 1/2 games over Tampa Bay, a 5-0 winner at home against Toronto.\n\n\u201cWe just didn\u2019t mount a whole lot offensively tonight,\u201d New York manager Aaron Boone said. \u201cCertainly, part of that is them being able to match up, but part of it we just had a down night.\u201d\n\nNew York starter Domingo Germ\u00e1n (17-4) gave up five runs in 4 1/3 innings, allowing three hits with four walks and five strikeouts in his bid to become the majors\u2019 first 18-game winner. He had given up two or fewer runs in three of his last four starts.\n\nMarcus Walden (9-2), Boston\u2019s third pitcher, threw a scoreless inning for the victory.\n\nNew York\u2019s hitters looked baffled in a handful of at-bats, facing different types of pitchers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little different but it\u2019s September baseball, unfortunately. We\u2019ve got three more weeks of that,\u201d Gardner said. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the game. It doesn\u2019t matter who we\u2019re facing or how many times we see them, our job is go out there and put good at-bats together and try and score runs.\u201d\n\nWith the Yankees entering Fenway Park with a 16 1/2-game advantage in the standings over the third-place Red Sox, the matchup hardly held the billing usually provided the rivalry.\n\nBoston moved ahead 4-0, scoring all the runs with two outs in the fourth. Brock Holt had an RBI single on a grounder that took a bad hop past second baseman Gleyber Torres before Moreland hooked his homer around the Pesky Pole.\n\nGardner hit his to right off Andrew Cashner in the fifth, but Bogaerts\u2019 two-run double off the Green Monster came in the bottom half off reliever Nestor Cortes Jr.\n\nSPECIAL TRIP\n\nYankees C Gary S\u00e1nchez and DH Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n both visited former Red Sox slugger David Ortiz Friday at his residence. Ortiz is in the area recovering from a gunshot wound suffered in the Dominican Republic in June.\n\nS\u00e1nchez talked before the game about how Ortiz texted him and helped when the catcher was struggling last season.\n\n\u201cI know it\u2019s someone that obviously Gary looks up to a lot, and obviously David carries a lot of respect not only here but across the sport. He\u2019s a giant in our sport,\u201d Boone said. \u201cIf Big Papi\u2019s helped him out a little bit, I\u2019m grateful for that.\u201d\n\nGREAT ENTRY, GRAND EXIT\n\nBoston starter Jhoulys Chac\u00edn, signed by the Red Sox on Aug. 31 after he was released by Milwaukee, pitched two hitless innings. striking out four in his debut with the club. When he walked off and shook Cora\u2019s hand, he slipped down the stairs. He was OK and laughing.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nYankees: LHP CC Sabathia (right knee inflammation) threw a bullpen session that Boone called \u201ca positive step.\u201d \u2026 Boone also said LHP Jordan Montgomery (recovering from left elbow surgery in March) has \u201cput himself in the mix\u201d for October based on his recent work. He could make another rehab start Monday. \u2026 RHP Luis Severino (rotator cuff inflammation) pitched three innings for Double-A Trenton, giving up one run on five hits, striking out five without any walks. RHP Dellin Betances also pitched a hitless inning at Trenton, striking out one and walking one.\n\nRed Sox: Cora said that LHP David Price (cyst left wrist) played catch. Heath Hembree (right elbow inflammation) threw a 20-pitch bullpen.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nLHP J.A. Happ (11-8, 5.34 ERA) is slated to go for the Yankees on Saturday. Cora said after the game that RHP Travis Lakins (0-1, 4.70) would start.\n\n___\n\nMore AP baseball: www.apnews.com/MLB and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Boston Red Sox pieced together a victory by going to the bullpen six times.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Ken Powtak"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/06/yankees_red_sox_baseball_19916_c0-139-3338-2085_s1770x1032.jpg?8c5615b031f260c57156446573f0b1fd94b5dcca", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
