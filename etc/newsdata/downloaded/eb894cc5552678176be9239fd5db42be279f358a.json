With a customer focused business model built on a diverse product offering, deep relationships with our suppliers, a high quality multi- channel offer and exceptional customer service, we are confident we will maintain our market leading competitive position,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe retailer avoided a first strike against its remuneration report, even though proxy advisory firm ISS Governance Services and the Australian Shareholders' Association recommended shareholders vote against it, citing \"inferior\" disclosure and lack of performance conditions for a new \"variable reward\" incentive scheme.\n\nAbout 17.3 per cent of shares voted were against the remuneration report - just short of the 25 per cent needed to record a first strike - after a 21.7 per cent protest vote in 2018.\n\nAbout 17 per cent of shares were voted against the issue of 51,723 restricted shares to Mr Murray under the variable reward plan, which combines long and short-term incentives in an attempt to simplify remuneration.", "description": "Same-store sales growth strengthened at JB Hi-Fi stores in Australia and New Zealand, although demand for appliances remains sluggish.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.7074%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_52%2C$y_16/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/27a20a58e02c456cd8b555e9b5f75d783afec3d8", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
