Moscow and Tehran have both repeatedly denied Western allegations over hacking.\n\n\n\n\n\nGLOBAL HACKING CAMPAIGNS\n\nWestern officials rank Russia and Iran as two of the most dangerous threats in cyberspace, alongside China and North Korea, with both governments accused of conducting hacking operations against countries around the world.\n\nIntelligence officials said there was no evidence of collusion between Turla and its Iranian victim, a hacking group known as \"APT34\" which cybersecurity researchers at firms including FireEye https://www.fireeye.com/current-threats/apt-groups.html say works for the Iranian government.\n\nRather, the Russian hackers infiltrated the Iranian group's infrastructure in order to \"masquerade as an adversary which victims would expect to target them,\" said GCHQ's Chichester.\n\nTurla's actions show the dangers of wrongly attributing cyberattacks, British officials said, but added that they were not aware of any public incidents that had been incorrectly blamed on Iran as a result of the Russian operation.\n\nThe United States and its Western allies have also used foreign cyberattacks to facilitate their own spying operations, a practice referred to as \"fourth party collection,\" according to documents released by former U.S. intelligence contractor Edward Snowden and reporting https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/new-snowden-docs-indicate-scope-of-nsa-preparations-for-cyber-battle-a-1013409-2.html by German magazine Der Spiegel.\n\nGCHQ declined to comment on Western operations.\n\nBy gaining access to the Iranian infrastructure, Turla was able to use APT34's \"command and control\" systems to deploy its own malicious code, GCHQ and the NSA said in a public advisory.\n\nThe Russian group was also able to access the networks of existing APT34 victims and even access the code needed to build its own \"Iranian\" hacking tools.
