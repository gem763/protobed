Pacheco has previously claimed she was threatened by the 48-year-old actor, which he denies.\n\nAccording to the documents, Pacheco is asking the judge to set aside a room at a courthouse where she and her nanny\u2019s deposition can take place under more secure circumstances. She notes that people can\u2019t bring firearms or weapons into a courthouse.\n\nJEREMY RENNER SHUTS DOWN HIS BIZARRE APP CLAIMING TROLLS TOOK IT OVER BY IMPERSONATING HIM\n\nReps for Renner did not immediately respond to Fox News\u2019 request for comment.\n\nThe gossip site previously cited other court documents alleging that Renner stuck a gun in his mouth and threatened to kill himself and Pacheco.
