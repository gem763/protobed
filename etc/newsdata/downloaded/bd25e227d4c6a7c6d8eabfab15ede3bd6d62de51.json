It may sound innocuous right now, but it will appear amazingly and devastatingly stupid if India finds herself in a war with the world at some point for protecting our precious national sovereignty.\n\nThe idea of using softwares made by private players is a great security threat, but almost equally insane is the economic implications of the same.\n\nAt this point, we pay premium for using the softwares that we can easily make. And if we don\u2019t, we have also empowered (under our IPR act) any foreign company a right to walk into our homes and offices and even have us arrested if they want to!\n\nBut, even if we set the IPR issue aside and focus on cyber security, there is no explanation why we don\u2019t have a national OS that we control and is available to all Indians to use free of cost.\n\nWhile the idea of Bharat Operating System (BOS) has been floating around since a while, for some strange reason, the governments of past have never really understood the security implications of the same.\n\nWhat we really need is a state-made free-for-all OS that has graded versions ranging from military (highest security and mandatory) to government to business to home computers.\n\nThough the last two need not have extreme security built-in, in the long run it will be nice to have a complete shift to BOS across all sector, so they must have added freebies in terms of basic softwares and encourage us common Indians to use it, as it can save all of us a lot of money and we can be freed from the terror of IPR that MNCs are unleashing.\n\nThe idea of state provided and maintained softwares may have its limitations, but exploring it as a replacement in some sectors like Office or even Computer Aided Design (CAD) may have a huge implication in terms of money.\n\nIf India offers a PC with all the basic softwares to her people, it will be a big boost even for the entrepreneurs of the nations who are currently forced to use pirated softwares and thus are constantly under the threat of being raided and harassed.\n\nEven though privatisation is the Mantra of modern times, this is one sector where Indian government has to consider entering for the sake of not just national security but also as part of the ongoing initiative of providing business infrastructure to the people.\n\nWhile the security and economic implications of such a move are huge, its implementation is not very difficult.\n\nAny IIT (or even a state university, if IITs are not interested) can be roped into doing this job. As we are one of the best brains in software making, it is not at all a technologically difficult project for the state to take up. All it requires is a will and understanding of the threat.\n\nI hope that the current government, with its focus on national security as well as providing business infrastructure takes this issue up urgently.", "description": "I am watching Narendrabhai welcoming Chinese President Xi Jinping in Mamallapuram, and the part that really strikes me is Jinpingji alighting from a brute of a car that I could not recognise.
