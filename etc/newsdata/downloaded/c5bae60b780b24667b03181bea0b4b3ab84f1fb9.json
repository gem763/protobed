The air is expected to be especially dry, which also fuels fires.\n\n(MORE: Thousands forced to flee as Getty Fire threatens Los Angeles)\n\n\"So we know the footprint that this fire can make with heavy gusts of wind,\" Moore told ABC News Tuesday. \"What we're gonna see tonight, about 11 p.m., as these Santa Ana winds come through ... probably the worst winds Los Angeles has seen in the last two to three years.\"\n\nMoore, defending the decision to evacuate so many residents, warned that the winds could trigger significant fires by stirring up embers and then hurling them 1 or 2 miles away.\n\n\"We anticipate that nobody [in the evacuation zone] is going home tonight,\" Garcetti said Tuesday.\n\n\"I want people in Brentwood and Palisades ... to understand the department is doing this on history and based on very keen analysis of the weather patterns,\" Los Angeles Councilmember Mike Bonin said Tuesday. \"It is that analysis and that determined effort to protect that same thing from happening that is leading to the continued evacuation order.\"\n\nView of the out-of-control Getty Fire in the Santa Monica Mountains, in Los Angeles.
