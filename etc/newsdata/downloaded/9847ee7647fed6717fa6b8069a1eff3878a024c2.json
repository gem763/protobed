Highly-regarded in Argentina, Meneses took the Uruguay job after the last World Cup and has built well since, building around pillars of experience and sticking to a largely settled first team.

Comfortable at either 10 or 13, Cat is a fine footballer. Felipe Berchesi is a very able fly-half which means outside centre might be Cat\u2019s home for the tournament, but the 23-year-old is a creator with both hands and feet who will make an attacking impact.\n\nPast Record\n\nWales 1999 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stages (one win)\n\nAustralia 2003 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stages (one win)\n\nEngland 2015 \u2013 eliminated in the pool stages (no wins)\n\nPrediction\n\nFour losses, at least three of them by a sizeable margin and bottom of Pool Four.\n\nFixtures\n\nWednesday 25 September \u2013 Fiji vs Uruguay (6.15am), Kamaishi\n\nSunday 29 September \u2013 Georgia vs Uruguay (6.15am), Kumagaya\n\nSaturday 5 October \u2013 Australia vs Uruguay (6.15am), Oita\n\nSunday 13 October \u2013 Wales vs Uruguay (9.15am), Kumamoto\n\nOdds\n\nUruguay to win the World Cup: 5000/1", "description": "Uruguay\u00a0head to their fourth\u00a0Rugby World Cup\u00a0desperately looking for a first group stage win\u00a0since 2003.
