The nationwide launch follows a successful trial run in Manhattan\u2019s 163 locations over the past three months.\n\nThe plan was always to go national with the menu item, but the U.S. expansion wasn\u2019t originally planned until January 2020. Dunkin\u2019 Brands Group Inc. said it accelerated the wider launch after New York sales were more than double what it had forecast, with the item becoming its No. 2 selling sandwich in Manhattan \u2014 surpassed only by bacon, egg and cheese on a bagel.\n\nBeyond Meat shares gained as much as 3.3 per cent in New York.\n\nRestaurants are racing to line up non-meat menu items as Americans warm to patties and sausages that mimic the flavours and textures of the real thing but are made with plants. Beyond Meat, which has seen its stock rally more than 300 per cent since its May public offering, is already present on menus at TGI Fridays nationwide and in regional fast-food chains like Carl\u2019s Jr. and Del Taco.\n\nIts main competitor, Impossible Foods, snagged a big win earlier this year when its plant-based Whopper landed in some 7,000 U.S. Burger Kings. But the real prize \u2014 a spot on McDonald\u2019s Corp.\u2019s U.S. menu \u2014 is still anyone\u2019s game. The fast-food giant selected Beyond Meat for a plant-based burger test in Canada but has yet to choose an alt-meat supplier of its roughly 14,000 locations in its home market.\n\nBloomberg.com", "description": "Dunkin' accelerated its nationwide launch after New York sales were more than double what it had forecast", "authors": ["Anne Riley Moffat", "Deena Shanker", "Bloomberg News"], "top_image": "https://financialpostcom.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/beyond-meat.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
