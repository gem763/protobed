I just woke up feeling euphoric,\u2019 Dr Gelder said.\n\n\u2018I told the Trust I would happily expose myself to Pet Remedy again to confirm the effects, if they though it would be useful. I was absolutely stunned at what happened.\n\n\u2018I absolutely did not pinch her bottom for sexual gratification.\u2019\n\nDr Gelder even claimed he \u2018would have done the same\u2019 thing to a male nurse had he crossed paths with one that day.\n\n\u2018I have never behaved in that way before or since,\u2019 he said.\n\n\u2018Something happened to me on that day and I thought everything was just wonderful and I thought I had superhuman powers.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve never been high before or in that state before in my life. It was illogical and irrational. What I did was wrong and I didn\u2019t want to put her through it again.\u2019\n\nGelder, from Leicestershire, denies sexually motivated misconduct and the hearing continues.\n\nGot a story for Metro.co.uk?
