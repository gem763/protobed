By 2020, losses from trade uncertainty \u2014 including the secondary effects on confidence stemming from tariffs \u2014 would reach $US700 billion ($1.04 billion), equivalent to the value of Switzerland\u2019s economy, Ms Georgieva noted.\n\n\u201cWe have spoken in the past about the dangers of trade disputes. Now, we see that they are actually taking a toll,\u201d Ms Georgieva said, adding that in additional to stagnant global trade, the decoupling of the major economies was also a growing concern.\n\n\u201cThe current rifts could lead to changes that last a generation \u2014 broken supply chains, siloed trade sectors, a \u2018digital Berlin Wall\u2019 that forces countries to choose between technology systems,\u201d she warned.\n\nMs Georgieva said there was now sufficient evidence that \u201cnobody wins\u201d from trade disputes. \u201cSome lose more than others,\u201d she said.\n\nThe IMF has called on central bank to pursue loose, or accommodative, monetary policy in the face of the slowdown if they needed a dose of stimulus, but Ms Georgieva acknowledged they were grappling with their mandates under \u201cdifficult circumstances\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey should communicate their plans clearly, remain data dependent, and where appropriate keep interest rates low. Especially since inflation is still subdued in many countries and overall growth is weakening,\u201d she said in her speech.\n\nHowever, in both her speech and comments to the FT, Ms Georgieva noted that there could be unintended consequences as central banks push interest rates deeper into negative territory.\n\nMs Georgieva suggested the IMF would be exploring the \u201csearch for yield\u201d that was driving funds and companies towards riskier investments, as well as the distributional impact of low and negative interest rates.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNegative interest rates have spread across the eurozone and other European countries as central banks have sought to stimulate sluggish growth. Last month, Mr Trump called on the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates to \u201czero or less\u201d, although Jay Powell, the US central bank\u2019s chairman, said the Fed was not considering any such move.\n\nThe incoming IMF head said that with monetary policy so constrained, it was important for countries to gear up for a fiscal response to the slowdown, if it ends up being sharper than expected.\n\n\u201cLet me be clear. We are not there. But when it comes to preparing for the possibility of a co-ordinated response we should remember the advice of Shakespeare: \u2018Better three hours too soon, than a minute too late\u2019,\u201d she said.\n\nFinancial Times", "description": "Kristalina Georgieva said the fund would \u201caccelerate\u201d its work on the pitfalls of negative interest rates as one of its first steps under her leadership.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.2119%2C$multiply_0.7554%2C$ratio_1.777778%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/e_sharpen:25%2Cq_85%2Cf_auto/c881d04795e324296566cb93891cf32be7b146d5", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
