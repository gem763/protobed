Most families would pay less for better care.", "language": "en", "text": "With costs rising painfully, insurance companies denying care and nearly 30 million people still uninsured, America desperately needs an honest health policy discussion. That\u2019s why it has been so disappointing over the past several weeks to watch multiple candidates parrot right-wing attacks on \"Medicare for All,\" like claiming that it will greatly increase spending on health care or ringing alarms about raising taxes on the middle class.\n\nThe truth is the opposite: Medicare for All would sharply reduce overall spending on health care. It can be thoughtfully designed to reduce total costs for the vast majority of American families, while improving the quality of the care they get.\n\nOver my career, I have witnessed the problems with our health care system firsthand. As a pediatrician, I have seen how our fragmented, expensive system hurts children and families. As a researcher at Harvard Medical School, I have studied the causes of waste and overspending in our system. And as President Barack Obama\u2019s head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, I led the existing Medicare system and helped stand up Obamacare.\n\nBest fix for a patchwork health system\n\nWhat I saw convinced me that the Affordable Care Act was an essential step forward. But covering all Americans through a single-payer, federal insurance program would now be a wiser path. President Obama has said it himself: It is now time for \"good new ideas like Medicare for All.\"\n\nThe case for Medicare for All is simple. It would cover everyone \u2014 period. Done right, it would lower costs, a lot, while letting us leverage health care dollars to respond to public health crises like the opioid epidemic, invest in disease prevention and modernize care delivery with telemedicine. And it would be simpler, easing the onerous burdens of billing for doctors, endless paperwork for all health care professionals, and navigating the confusing coverage system for patients and families. Compared with some candidates\u2019 plans that retain our patchwork of coverage, Medicare for All wins twice: on both simplicity and savings.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., on April 29, 2019. More\n\nSome candidates have attempted to sidestep the cost debate by promising to spend less and accomplish the same goals. These proposals, such as relying on a public option or expanding Medicare Advantage, offering private plans within Medicare, provide too few details to allow real cost comparisons. But it is unlikely they will do as much as Medicare for All would to reduce national health care spending or reduce costs for families.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts suggested as much when she claimed in the latest Democratic presidential debate that one alternative proposal, \u201cMedicare for All Who Want It,\u201d would really mean \u201cMedicare for All Who Can Afford It.\u201d The reasons are simple. First, these alternative plans retain a costly architecture of private profits and payment complexity. And second, they don\u2019t have the scale of Medicare for All, which is crucial for simplifying billing, improving the quality and safety of care, and removing wasteful spending.\n\nNearly certain to save trillions\n\nFaced with these facts, opponents of Medicare for All too often revert to myths instead. The first myth is that Medicare for All will necessarily increase health care spending. That\u2019s wrong. The fact is that, without a change, Americans will spend over $45 trillion on health care in the next 10 years. Under Medicare for All, total health care spending would likely be far lower. The cost would depend on many implementation decisions that Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 bill, for example, leaves open for thoughtful exploration, careful choice and adjustments over time: payment rates to hospitals and doctors, content of the benefit package, details of price negotiations with drug companies, design of simplified administration and more.", "description": "The case for Medicare for All is simple.
