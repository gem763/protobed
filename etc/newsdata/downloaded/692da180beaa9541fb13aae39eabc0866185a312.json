I think we're making progress, but they don't always like to involve us - in the past they haven't.\"\n\nRicciardo: Drivers unhappy being in dark on proposals\n\nChampionship leader Lewis Hamilton said that F1 entertaining such experiments at this time was not compatible with its impending 2021 rules overhaul.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen asked by Autosport whether he shared Hamilton's disapproval over the timing of the proposal, Ricciardo said: \"I don't think it's the right time.\n\n\"I think if 2021 [delivers] what it should, then there's no reason to change anything of the format.\n\n\"And I think as well it would then dilute a lot of the weekend. It's like some other sports I follow, the product becomes diluted if you then have reverse-grid races, this and that.\n\n\"2021, I think that's enough changing. I think that [suggestion] is a bit desperate, and I don't think we're in a desperate time at all.\n\n\"As I said, there's some [sports] - like, I love the UFC [Ultimate Fighting Championship], the mixed martial arts and all that, and it got to a point where they were having fights on every weekend, and it's great for fans, you get to see a fight all the time, but you become less excited, less interested, because it's always in front of you.\n\n\"So I think like that with the races, if there's always a race on, and if they're reversed-grid and then kind of manipulating the result a little bit, I think it loses some of its value and some of its core.\n\n\"I'd prefer to keep that part for tradition.\"\n\nGet unlimited access to the world\u2019s best motorsport journalism with Autosport Plus", "description": "Daniel Ricciardo says Formula 1 drivers are \"pretty frustrated\" at being left in the dark over major developments such as the proposal to introduce a revised weekend format in 2020", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/KZupCRbwzfNmQu5qrQfDYg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTYwMDtoPTQwMA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6Cbo6_vCOt8ooU_RWKUrHw--~B/aD0yMDA7dz0zMDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/autosport_578/8af53e8de9f33d1d12caae750c4152ff", "published_at": "2019-09-27"}
