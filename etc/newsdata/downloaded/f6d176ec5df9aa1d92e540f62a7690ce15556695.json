And we have many hundreds of acres so that in terms of parking, in terms of all of the things that you need, the ballrooms are among the biggest in Florida, and the best.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe.\u201d With that pronoun, Trump spoke not as president of the United States but as de facto head of the Trump Organization. And he now endeavors to abuse his status as host of next year\u2019s G-7 summit to force foreign countries and U.S. taxpayers to pump millions more dollars into one of his properties.\n\nTrump is essentially requiring foreign governments to pay him the very definition of unconstitutional emoluments. Is this a president or a timeshare salesman?\n\nTrump is often criticized for representing only those who voted for him, but even that description seemed generous Monday. On French soil, Trump seemed to be representing only himself.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Trump has been unable (or unwilling) to distinguish the national interest from his own. And his l\u2019etat-c\u2019est-moi routine isn\u2019t just for the French. After meeting recently with mass-shooting victims, he rhapsodized about their \u201clove for me \u2014 and me, maybe, as a representative of the country \u2014 but for me.\u201d\n\nHe has badgered the Federal Reserve chairman to reduce interest rates, which would benefit him as a huge borrower. The president has made untold millions from his tax cuts and from foreign governments booking rooms and meals at his properties.\n\nTrump makes geopolitical decisions based on how he\u2019s treated personally. It\u2019s no mere coincidence that Japan, which nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize and gave him a fancy state visit, has escaped the worst of his trade wrath. By contrast, he canceled a visit to Denmark and claimed the prime minister had insulted the United States by labeling \u201cabsurd\u201d his (absurd) plan to buy Greenland: \u201cYou don\u2019t talk to the United States that way!\u201d\n\nAccordingly, Trump\u2019s peers at the G-7 were careful to stroke his ego with talk of his powerful traits, his lovely wife, his new grandchild. Even so, no one praised Trump as much as Trump.\n\nOn the environment: \u201cI think I know more about the environment than most people.\u201d\n\nOn oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge: \u201cI was able to get ANWR approved. Ronald Reagan wasn\u2019t able to do it.\u201d\n\nOn trade: \u201cWe never had a president that understood this.\u201d Until now!\n\nAsked about Russia rejoining the G-7, Trump found himself boasting: \u201cI ran one election and I won. Happened to be for president.\u201d\n\nAsked about his mixed messages on trade, he replied: \u201cIt\u2019s done well for me over the years, and it\u2019s doing even better for the country.\u201d\n\nHe said he\u2019d accept an invitation to visit Berlin, not because Germany is a key ally but because \u201cI have German in my blood.\u201d\n\nAbove all, he celebrated the greatness of Trump Organization holdings.\n\n\u201cI own great property in the U.K.\u201d he said when asked about new Prime Minister Boris Johnson, adding, \u201cI own Turnberry and I own in Aberdeen and I own in Ireland, as you know, Doonbeg and great stuff.\u201d\n\nGreat stuff! His travels to his properties in Ireland, Scotland, Virginia, New Jersey, Florida and elsewhere (on 255 days of his presidency, The Post calculated in June) have funneled them a fortune in taxpayer dollars.\n\nNow, it\u2019s Doral\u2019s turn. Seated earlier Monday with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Trump gave a hard sell for the resort: \u201cGreat place.\u201d \u201cTremendous acreage.\u201d \u201cNext to the airport.\u201d Nothing \u201cclose to competing with it.\u201d Later, he explained that \u201cmy people\u201d looked at potential G-7 locations and \u2014 surprise! \u2014 \u201cthey came back and said, \u2018This is where we\u2019d like to be.\u2019 \u201d\n\nIt would be a nice boost for the underperforming resort, yet Trump believes he is the one making a sacrifice. The presidency has cost him more than $3 billion, he lamented on Monday, from lost income from giving motivational speeches, for example.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care about making money,\u201d Trump claimed Monday. What\u2019s more, \u201cI\u2019m not going to make any money\u201d from hosting the G-7 at Doral.\n\nOf course not. And if you don\u2019t believe him, you can check his tax returns.\n\nTwitter: @Milbank\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\n\nRead more:\n\nMax Boot: Is Trump a liar or a fantasist?
