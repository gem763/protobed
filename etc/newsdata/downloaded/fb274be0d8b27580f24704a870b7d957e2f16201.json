The couple, along with Nikki\u2019s mom, had come from their hometown of Kansas City, Mo. to Florida for the birth and to see a specialist, after learning that their son suffered from a rare congenital disability called congenital diaphragmatic hernia. It\u2019s a condition in which the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen doesn\u2019t close during prenatal development. As a result, the stomach, intestines, or liver can migrate into the chest.\n\nJohn Henry, named after his grandfathers, had a small chance of survival.\n\n\"The amazing doctors got him on ECMO within 25 minutes [after birth],\" Nikki tells Yahoo Lifestyle. ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, also known as extracorporeal life support, is a pump that circulates blood through an artificial lung back into the bloodstream, providing both heart and lung bypass support outside of a baby's body.\n\n\"I think that may have been a record. All of the staff has been absolutely amazing,\u201d she says.\n\nNikki and Joe Ihus's son John Henry.

He had a lot of wires going every which way, but the most important were the cannulas in his neck that attached him to ECMO,\" she tells Yahoo. \"When they originally flipped him to his stomach, the ECMO flow went to zero, which means he was no longer supported...it was very scary.\"\n\nThankfully, doctors were able to stabilize John Henry. But alone in a new city, Nikki realized that she was running out of supplies and clothing. So she called an Uber to take her to a consignment shop called Rhea Lana's in St. Petersburg.\n\nWhen driver Belinda Smith pulled up, the the two started talking.\n\n\"I actually wasn't planning on talking, but at that point, I hadn't told really anyone what had just happened,\" Nikki says. \"Something like that isn't easy to keep bottled up. I started talking about my son and just spilled about his condition, why we were in Florida, what happened when, where I was going. I was crying by the end.\"\n\n\u201cWhen I saw the pickup location was a children\u2019s hospital, I had hoped it wasn\u2019t a sick child,\u201d Smith tells Yahoo Lifestyle. \u201cWhen I saw Nikki, and heard what she was going through, my heart just broke.\u201d\n\nBy the time they arrived at their destination, Smith had made a decision. \u201cI believe everyone gets in my car for a reason and not just a ride,\u201d says Smith. \u201cI dropped her off, first, and she thought it was the end of the ride. I went, pulled into a parking space, turned Uber off, and I said, \u2018I\u2019m just going to go in and find her.\u2019\u201d\n\nSmith purchased 30 new outfits, including a onesie that stated \"I am a superhero,\" for John Henry.\n\nTo Nikki, this wasn\u2019t a simple act of kindness. \"It is hard, nowadays, to make money and stay afloat,\" she says. \"Belinda had mentioned that Uber is her second job...to stop working, to help a complete stranger out, is so incredibly selfless. She really touched my heart and I will cherish the clothes that she purchased and helped me pick out.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Smith stopped by the hospital to meet John Henry.\n\n\"I was proud to introduce her to John Henry,\" says Nikki. \"I hope she can come back to visit soon.\"\n\nFor both women, the interaction has resulted in a friendship, something Nikki desperately needed in a new city as she cares for her firstborn.\n\n\u201cWe talk every day,\u201d Smith says.\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Nikki Ihus says she was moved by her Uber driver's \"incredibly selfless\" act of kindness.", "authors": ["Hope Schreiber"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/3Xna9piymGyv28YtlkVHOw--~B/aD0zMDI0O3c9NDAzMjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-10/420d3d00-f9ed-11e9-bdf1-f159e573872c", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
