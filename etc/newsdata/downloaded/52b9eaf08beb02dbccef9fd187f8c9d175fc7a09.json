Bernie Sanders as they rolled out the red carpet for Hillary Clinton. She has reason to believe a similar scenario is playing out this time around, but with a different target in mind.\n\nI am seriously considering boycotting October 15 debate to bring attention to DNC/corporate media\u2019s effort to rig 2020 primary. Not against Bernie this time, but against voters in early states Iowa, New Hampshire, South\u2026 --> https://t.co/x5P3GFGbyn pic.twitter.com/UgKCj6DGI0 \u2014 Tulsi Gabbard (@TulsiGabbard) October 10, 2019\n\n\"In this 2020 election, the DNC and the corporate media are rigging the election again,\" Gabbard charges. \"But this time it's against the American people in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. They are attempting to replace the roles of voters in the early states, using polling and other arbitrary methods which are not transparent or democratic and they're holding so called debates which really are not debates at all, but rather commercialized reality television.\"\n\nShe finishes by saying, in short, the DNC and the corporate media are trying to \"hijack\" this election.\n\nGabbard \"shares\" voters concerns. And that's why she's \"seriously considering\" boycotting next Tuesday's debate. She'll make her decision \"within the next few days.\"\n\nThe Hawaii congresswoman's sentiments were shared by at least one other Democratic contender, Marianne Williamson.\n\nI have great respect for Tulsi for saying such inconvenient truth. She is absolutely correct. https://t.co/HDRV5avPMO \u2014 Marianne Williamson (@marwilliamson) October 10, 2019\n\nAs of right now, Gabbard is one of 12 Democrats expected to battle on stage on Tuesday, Oct. 15 for the CNN/New York Times debate at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio.", "description": ".10/10/2019 14:20:11PM EST.", "authors": ["Cortney O'Brien", "Katie Pavlich", "Guy Benson", "Julio Rosas", "Bronson Stocking"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/212/0a5b0776-f914-4e49-b934-6403f48bc11a.png", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
