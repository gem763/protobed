Here's why some of Wall Street's top analysts think it could actually succeed in disrupting the $3.5 trillion industry.", "language": "en", "text": "For the Wall Street analysts who made their way to rural Georgia to visit a Walmart and hear about the company's health ambitions, it appears to have been love at first sight.\n\nThe analysts who attended the Friday opening of the first Walmart Health center in Dallas, Georgia, came back with high expectations of what the retail giant might be able to do in healthcare.\n\n\"We believe its goal is to change the face of healthcare in America, resulting in a clear positive for consumers and another avenue of growth for Walmart,\" the Morgan Stanley analyst Simeon Gutman wrote in a note on Monday.\n\nAnalysts from Barclays, Morgan Stanley, and Jefferies all traveled to Georgia for the grand opening. In research notes, they called the strategy \"revolutionary,\" said it was potentially disruptive to the entire industry, and laid out why they thought Walmart would be a winner as more retailers look to bulk up their work in healthcare.\n\nRead more: Walmart is opening health clinics, but that's just the start. We got the full story from the exec leading its push into the $3.5 trillion US healthcare industry.\n\nDoing to healthcare what Walmart did to retail\n\nThe new centers will provide primary care, counseling, eye and hearing exams, and dentistry. Walmart also plans to offer home care and telemedicine.\n\nThe goal is to do for healthcare what Walmart Supercenter stores did for retail: offer a breadth of services conveniently and at a much cheaper price point than rivals, Sean Slovenski, Walmart's president of health and wellness, told Business Insider last week.\n\nFor instance, a primary-care visit costs $40, while a dental visit costs $25. Walmart is starting by opening \"prototype\" health centers in northern Georgia that could quickly make Walmart into the largest provider of basic healthcare in the region, Slovenski said.\n\nIn particular, Gutman and his team at Morgan Stanley said the healthcare initiatives from Walmart could have the potential to affect roughly $800 billion of wasted healthcare spend, between giving better and more coordinated care, avoiding overtreatment, cutting down on administrative complexity, and bringing down the price of treatments.\n\n\"If successful, years from now we may look back and realize we attended an event that helped shape change in healthcare delivery in America,\" Gutman said.\n\nRead more: Companies like Walmart, CVS, and Amazon are beefing up their healthcare strategies. Here are their plans to upend the $3.5 trillion industry.\n\nHow Walmart Health could boost Walmart's earnings\n\nWalmart, with more than 5,000 retail locations in the US, has historically had a presence in healthcare. It's one of the biggest operators of pharmacies in the US. Even so, Walmart's revenues from its health and wellness businesses are nowhere near as big as its general merchandise sales and groceries. Analysts see the new healthcare clinic as a strategy to make healthcare the next big driver of growth for Walmart.\n\n\"We believe Walmart's approach to the healthcare conundrum is unique and revolutionary, will clearly be disruptive, and, in our view, will be the next driver of WMT share gains in the US, given the fact that 90% of the population lives within 10 miles of a Walmart,\" the Barclays analyst Karen Short wrote in a note on Monday.\n\nShort and the team at Barclays pointed to how Walmart was able to grow its grocery business from $23.2 billion in sales in 2001 to $184.2 billion in sales in 2019.\n\nThe move into healthcare could also help Walmart retain and grow traffic, the Morgan Stanley analysts said.\n\n\"All signs point to healthcare being an incremental traffic driver for Walmart as it adds more Health Centers next to a portion of its 3,500+ Supercenters,\" the analysts said.\n\nTo be sure, this isn't the first time Walmart's built out health clinics. While past attempts haven't panned out, Slovenski told Business Insider that the current push was a top priority for the company's senior leadership.\n\n\"We finally got to the point this past year with the right strategy, the right team, and the right timing,\" Slovenski said.\n\nOne extra perk of the new centers that caught the attention of analysts at Jefferies was the addition of veterinary services to a store location in Dallas, Georgia.\n\n\"Care also extends to pets, further ingraining Walmart into U.S. families and, in our view, fortifying its position as a long-term winner,\" the analysts wrote.", "description": "\"We may look back and realize we attended an event that helped shape change in healthcare delivery in America,\" one analyst said.", "authors": ["Lydia Ramsey"], "top_image": "https://amp.businessinsider.com/images/5d81358a2e22af4fd22f6c06-1536-768.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
