This comes as a North Korean official released a statement about how there could be an 'exchange of fire at any moment' as Mr Kim waits 'with patience' for Trump's administration in the US to come to the 'courageous decision' to create a denuclearisation deal\n\nHe visited the medical centre with the WPK Central Committee just over a year after he said the institution lacked modernisation, on the same day as North Korea's official Kim Yong Chol revealed the country getting increasingly angered by America's demands for a 'final and fully verified denuclearisation' while pushing other UN countries to strengthen their sanctions\n\nMr Chol said the US would fail if it used the 'deep personal relations' between Mr Kim (pictured inspecting the appliances at the medical centre yesterday) and Trump to 'delay tactics'\n\nThis comes at an increasingly-tense time in US-North Korea relations as a statement by senior North Korean official Kim Yong Chol released yesterday said there could be an 'exchange of fire at any moment' as there has been no substantial progress in securing a nuclear negotiation.\n\nTrump's administration would be 'seriously mistaken' if its ignores the end-of-year deadline proposed by North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un to create a deal where nuclear arms would be partly surrendered.\n\nHe said the US would fail if it used the 'close personal relationship' between the leaders to 'delay tactics'.\n\nMr Chol said the country was getting increasingly angered by Trump's administration's demands for a 'final and fully verified denuclearisation' while pushing other UN countries to strengthen their sanctions.\n\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump prepare to shake hands at the border village of Panmunjom in the Demilitarized Zone, South Korea in June 2019. North Korea said it's running out of patience with the United States over what it described as hostile policies and unilateral disarmament demands\n\nMr Kim, pictured, walks around the institution and says he will send a unit to continue improvements so the building has a 'flawless finish, just after it was heard he had given the US an end-of-year deadline to secure a deal where nuclear powers would be partly surrendered\n\nHe inspects dentistry equipment at a time when Mr Chol released a statement which accused Washington of trying to 'isolate and stifle' North Korea in a 'more crafty and viscous way than before'\n\nWashington has been attempting to 'isolate and stifle' North Korea in a 'more crafty and viscous way than before' instead of listening to Kim Jon Un's call to change its approach in nuclear negotiations, he said in the statement.\n\nAnd the country's talks were stalled after the collapse of a February summit between Mr Kim and Mr Trump in Vietnam where the US rejected demands for sanctions relief in exchange for a deal.\n\nThe North made a series of short-range missile tests a day after announcing it would resume nuclear negotiations with Washington, as a sign to show time is not on the side of the US.\n\nMr Kim said he would 'wait with patience until the end of the year for the United States to come up with a courageous decision'.\n\nWashington and Pyongyang resumed working-level discussion in Sweden earlier this month, but the meeting broke down amid acrimony with the North Koreans calling the talks 'sickening' and accusing the Americans of maintaining an 'old stance and attitude'.\n\nNorth Korea has pushed for denuclearisation which bears no resemblance to the American definition, with Pyongyang vowing to pursue nuclear development until the United States removes its troops and the nuclear umbrella defending South Korea and Japan.", "description": "Kim Jong Un visited the country's Myohyangsan Medical Appliances Factory just as North Korean official released a statement on tense US relations to secure nuclear negotiation, yesterday.", "authors": ["Phoebe Eckersley For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/27/11/20241872-0-image-a-10_1572176309553.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-27"}
