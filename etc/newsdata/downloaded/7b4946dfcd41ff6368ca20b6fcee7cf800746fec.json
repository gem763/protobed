That man deserved to enjoy his time in the pub without having it end the way it did,\u201d the volotile fighter said. \u201cI tried to make amends, and I made amends back then. But it doesn\u2019t matter. I was in the wrong. I must come here before you and take accountability and take responsibility. I owe it to the people that have been supporting me. I owe it to my mother, my father, my family. I owe it to the people who trained me in martial arts. That\u2019s not who I am. That\u2019s not the reason why I got into martial arts or studying combat sports. The reason I got into it was to defend against that type of scenario.\u201d\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston.", "description": "Legendary UFC fighter Conor McGregor has been charged with assault, for punching an elderly patron at a bar in Dublin, Ireland, in April.", "authors": ["Warner Todd Huston"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Getty-Images-6-640x335.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
