So what will happen to Brexit if either of them get into power?\n\nHere's a basic explanation.\n\nIs Boris Johnson's Brexit deal dead?\n\n(Image: REUTERS)\n\nNope. Well not exactly.\n\nThe deal is still active and agreed between the UK, the EU and 27 European leaders - so it can be taken up by whoever gets into 10 Downing Street, Labour or Tory.\n\nBut the Bill that puts it into law will be parked until after an election, when it'd have to be brought back to the UK Parliament from scratch.\n\nIt'll be easy to bring the Withdrawal Agreement Bill back and pass it if Boris Johnson wins a majority.\n\nIf he doesn't get a majority it's a different story. So the PM is gambling it all on winning the house.\n\nWhat happens if the Tories get a majority\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nBoris Johnson would have achieved his goal of clearing opposition to his Brexit plan.\n\nHe could bring back his Withdrawal Agreement Bill and, this time, get it through the House of Commons without it being whittled down by angry MPs.\n\nNo doubt he would still face opposition, but if he had an overall majority - of MPs buoyed by an election victory - he'd likely be able to get it through the Commons before the January 31 deadline.\n\nThere could still be a hold-up when the Bill got to the Lords, and the European Parliament, which both need to ratify it. But the path would be easier.\n\nIf he still faced opposition, Mr Johnson has not ruled out leaving with no deal at the end of January.\n\nWhat happens if Labour get a majority\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nLabour has vowed to try to negotiate its own, softer Brexit deal - one that protects workers' rights, has alignment with the single market and puts the UK in a customs union with Brussels.\n\nYou could expect to see Jeremy Corbyn going to Brussels in a bid to reopen talks with EU chiefs.\n\nBrussels leaders have previously been reluctant to do this, but a change of leadership in the UK would be a clear incentive to reopen negotiations.\n\nWhatever Labour come up with, that would then be put back to the people in a \"confirmatory\" second referendum.\n\nIt's likely people would be asked to choose between Remain and the Labour deal. Labour would only decide how to campaign in that referendum at some point in 2020 at a special conference.\n\nAll this would almost certainly require another delay to Brexit.\n\nWhat happens if the Lib Dems get a majority\n\nThis would be unprecedented but... they've said they'd revoke Article 50 . The Lib Dems also back a second referendum.\n\nWhat happens there's a hung parliament\n\n(Image: WPA Pool)\n\nWe know you hate to hear it, but... probably more of the same.\n\nHow Brexit unfolds will be defined by what groupings can be formed between Remainers - including small parties like the Lib Dems, who are widely expected to make gains - and Brexiteers.\n\nExpect more running battles, attempts by backbenchers to delay Brexit, or a surprising majority around one thing or the other.\n\nA hung Parliament could boost calls for a second referendum, because some would see it as the only way out now an election has been exhausted.\n\nBut whether enough MPs would back it for it to actually happen, through a vote in Parliament, is a totally different matter.", "description": "We're facing a new Prime Minister just 49 days before Brexit.
