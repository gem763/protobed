Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) just couldn\u2019t convince enough voters that she could beat President Trump. I mean if that bus tour she touted couldn\u2019t convince you, I don\u2019t know what else would (sarc.). Let\u2019s be honest, Gillibrand had no shot. That was made painfully clear after the first couple of debates. She\u2019s just not charismatic. Ranch dressing is more exciting than Gillibrand. And with that, she\u2019s officially out of the race. She hasn\u2019t decided whom she will endorse, but it\u2019ll be anyone but Trump for her, as usual (via NYT):\n\nSenator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who presented herself in the presidential race as a champion of women and families, said Wednesday that she was withdrawing from the Democratic primary after failing to qualify for a third debate next month \u2014 a development she described as fatal to her candidacy. Ms. Gillibrand said in an interview that she would endorse another candidate in the primary but had not yet picked a favorite. Though she stopped short of saying she would endorse a woman, Ms. Gillibrand, who has made electing women to Congress a personal cause, said the next president had to be capable of uniting the country and suggested that a woman might be best suited for the job. \u201cI think that women have a unique ability to bring people together and heal this country,\u201d Ms. Gillibrand said, adding, \u201cI think a woman nominee would be inspiring and exciting.\u201d But she added: \u201cI will support whoever the nominee is, and I will do whatever it takes to beat Trump.\u201d\n\nThis announcement also comes after a rather sad attempt for her campaign to try and meet the donor threshold by selling t-shirts, which the Free Beacon noted was going to cost her campaign $130,000:\n\nNew York senator Kirsten Gillibrand is willing to lose tens of thousands of dollars on a fundraising gimmick in an attempt to make the September debate stage. Gillibrand launched a t-shirt giveaway at a time when she needs approximately 15,000 additional unique donors to qualify for the third round of Democratic primary debates. She began offering first-time donors a campaign t-shirt retailing at $30 in exchange for a $1 contribution in August. If the giveaway proves successful, Gillibrand could lose nearly $130,000 on the cost of shirts alone, according to a Washington Free Beacon analysis. The campaign did not return request for comment.\n\nA desperate t-shirt push and polls that had her with less than one percent support; it was time to call it quits.", "description": ".09/02/2019 3:19:57AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/212/b10e3863-0c92-4e6a-94f6-302caa7d3f1b.png"}
