The results were confirmed in a replica test by another craft 4,000 miles away. Levin\u2019s spent the 43 years since studying the results.\n\nAccording to him:\n\nOn July 30, 1976, the LR [Labeled Release life detection experiment] returned its initial results from Mars. Amazingly, they were positive. As the experiment progressed, a total of four positive results, supported by five varied controls, streamed down from the twin Viking spacecraft landed some 4,000 miles apart. The data curves signaled the detection of microbial respiration on the Red Planet. The curves from Mars were similar to those produced by LR tests of soils on Earth. It seemed we had answered that ultimate question.\n\nSo why has the government sat on this information for nearly half a century? Well, it really hasn\u2019t. The results of the LR tests conducted during the Viking missions aren\u2019t exactly hidden information. Scientists have taken a look before and, generally speaking, there\u2019s no consensus that those particular experiments indicate that there is, or ever has been, life on Mars.\n\nCritics claim the test is nonspecific and, without corroborating data, inconclusive. But, Levin says that NASA hasn\u2019t followed up on the Viking missions with complimentary experiments to further the findings of the LR studies.\n\nLevin\u2019s concern isn\u2019t that his work\u2019s gone unfinished, but that we\u2019re about to send humans to a planet that many scientists believe could have space germs. He warns about the dangers astronauts might face if he\u2019s right about the results of the Viking missions:\n\nAny life there might threaten them, and us upon their return. Thus, the issue of life on Mars is now front and center.\n\nLevin concludes that the most logical path forward would be to focus on the LR findings:\n\nA panel of expert scientists should review all pertinent data of the Viking LR together with other and more recent evidence concerning life on Mars. Such an objective jury might conclude, as I did, that the Viking LR did find life.\n\nIn the past couple of years there\u2019s been a slew of evidence to support the idea that Mars, at some point in the past, had large bodies of water and an atmosphere. This is enough to convince many scientists that it would be stranger if Mars didn\u2019t host organic life at some point in time.\n\nBut, to the best of our knowledge, there\u2019s absolutely no scientifically accepted evidence for life anywhere outside of Earth besides the tardigrades and other microbes we\u2019ve managed to litter the cosmos with.\n\nThere are plenty of theories, and evidence to support those theories, but there\u2019s so far been no direct observation of extraterrestrial life.\n\nHowever, If Levin is right, and there is microscopic life on Mars, we could be setting our astronauts up for some kind of space germ-based disease. For all we know the \u201cMartian Flu\u201d could eradicate life on Earth within minutes of the first human returning from a years-long mission to the red planet. By that token, it could also turn us into super heroes who live forever and never lose our car keys.\n\nWe should definitely figure out what the middle-ground is before we send people to an alien planet\u2019s surface.\n\nI'm convinced we found evidence of life on Mars in the 1970s on Scientific American\n\nRead next: Fortnite's back as a Big Bang refreshes the whole game", "description": "", "authors": ["Tristan Greene"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2Fmars_disco.jpg&signature=dd844b4fc6f11b59bb9c9e3cac52237c", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
