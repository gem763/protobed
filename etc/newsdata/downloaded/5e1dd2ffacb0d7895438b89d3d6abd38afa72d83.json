Trump was initially briefed on Thursday for military options to retaliate against Iran for downing a U.S. surveillance drone. One of the things his advisers discussed with him was the potential for a high Iranian body count. With the possible death toll made clear, the president approved the preparations for striking Iran.\n\n\u201cYes, he was briefed on it earlier in the day,\u201d a senior administration official said.\n\n\u201cThe military has a standard in which the president is briefed on a potential strike\u2014the battle damage assessment is included in that,\u201d added a former national security official involved in past briefings. \u201cIt\u2019s always part of the package. And that includes possible military and civilian casualties.\u201d\n\nWhite House spokespeople declined to comment on the record for this report. The Pentagon declined to comment.\n\nLater on Friday, Trump fed the confusion further, telling NBC News\u2019 Chuck Todd that he hadn\u2019t given a final approval to a military strike against Iran at all\u2014even though he tweeted that the attack was 10 minutes out.\n\n\u201cI thought about it for a second and I said, you know what, they shot down an unmanned drone, plane, whatever you want to call it, and here we are sitting with a 150 dead people that would have taken place probably within a half an hour after I said go ahead,\" Trump said. \"And I didn\u2019t like it\u2026I didn\u2019t think it was proportionate.\"\n\nThe series of events were the first indication that the president had seriously considered military strikes against Iran\u2014a move he has for weeks publicly shied away from. Just Thursday, Trump walked back a tweet, in which he said Iran had made a \u201cbig mistake\u201d for shooting down an unmanned American drone.\n\nHouse Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith (D-WA) attended a briefing with the president at the White House Thursday with other congressional leaders.\n\n\u201cWe talked in great depth about what they felt the appropriate response would be,\u201d Smith said. \u201cThe gist was, the president was really wrestling with it. On the one hand, certainly you want to hold Iran accountable for this; on the other hand, nobody wants this to spin out of control.\u201d\n\nSmith said he was concerned that the White House was not consulting enough people when it came to Iran.\n\n\u201cThe meeting yesterday was incredibly helpful. It was the first one he\u2019s had. I\u2019m chairman of the Armed Services Committee, was ranking member before that, two-plus years, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve met with anyone at the White House,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI wish the [national security council] had more discussions. I wish they met more frequently with leaders.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the president is considering striking Iran at all in the near future. But two former Trump White House officials told The Daily Beast that they feared that if the president saw TV pundits knocking his decision to pull back\u2014including those on his favorite channel Fox News\u2014it would increase the likelihood the president would actually end up confronting Iran militarily, and soon. Trump hates being portrayed as \u201cweak,\u201d these former officials added.\n\nOver the last several days the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington, D.C. think tank known for its hawkish approach to Iran, wrote the White House and the State Department with guidance on how to handle the most recent attacks on tankers in the Gulf of Oman and the shooting down of an American drone. The message to the administration: Continue the so-called \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d campaign, which includes crippling the Iranian economy through sanctions and cutting off Tehran\u2019s access to the financial markets. Administration officials told The Daily Beast Friday that they were preparing to continue implementing that effort by announcing a new round of sanctions on Tehran.\n\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill were briefed this week on Iran not only by administration officials but also by former Obama administration officials, including Wendy Sherman, the lead American negotiator on the nuclear deal, who often keep in touch with the Iranians.\n\n\"We need to unambiguously seek to de-escalate tensions with Iran,\u201d said Jarrett Blanc, a former Obama administration official in the State Department who worked on the Iran nuclear deal. \u201cThere's no justification in our national security interests to test Iran\u2019s willingness to absorb military confrontation with the US. We need to get ourselves out of this situation.\u201d\n\nAmid the ongoing tensions between Washington and Tehran, the Trump administration has sent some of its top officials to the Middle East and Europe to shore up support for not only its stated maximum pressure campaign against Iran, but also the forthcoming unveiling of the Middle East peace plan. The State Department\u2019s special representative for Iran, who testified in front of Congress about Iran earlier this week, is in the Middle East meeting with regional partners, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Bahrain.\n\n\u2014with additional reporting by Sam Brodey and Justin Baragona", "description": "Trump said he called off an attack on Iran when a general told him minutes before that 150 people could die.
