Monson told the outlet that fans would stop by, or at least recognize the exterior, at least a few times a month for about a decade after the show went off the air.\n\n\"Maybe twice a month, someone would walk by, and they\u2019d say, 'Is this Elaine\u2019s house?' I would go, 'How would you know that'?\" she recalled.\n\nAccording to Monson, the show\u2019s production team shot footage of the exterior before she moved in (\u201cSeinfeld\u201d debuted in 1989) but returned just once after she was living there, to take footage of the exterior at night.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nWhile the exterior might appear familiar, the address likely won\u2019t: The Chelsea townhouse is situated on W. 20th St. in Manhattan, a far cry from the W. 75th St. address where Elaine lived on the series.\n\nThe inside is quite different too, as the building isn\u2019t divvied up into apartments, but rather a three-story residence (where the owners live) and a single three-bedroom apartment above, which they rent out.\n\nAccording to the listing, the six-bedroom, six-bathroom home spans \u201c4,730 square feet over five floors (in addition to an excavated and finished 850 square foot floor below),\u201d as well as \u201csoaring ceilings,\u201d and \u201ctwin black and gold Italian marble fireplaces\u201d in its double living rooms. There\u2019s also a landscaped garden in the back with its own fountain and pond, perfect for entertaining friends who drop in unannounced to talk about nothing.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPictures from the listing also indicate that the current owners didn\u2019t keep any out-of-place rattan pieces that Newman would very likely disapprove of.", "description": "It's unclear if China Panda will deliver its Supreme Flounder to this side of the street, though.", "authors": ["Michael Bartiromo"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/ElaineBenesSeinfeldGeorge-LangeNBCU-Photo-BankNBCUniversal-viaGettyImages.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
