He talks about the problem with white liberals \u2013 and his duty to provoke\n\nChris Morris first saw the reports on Sky News. The FBI had arrested an army planning \u201cfull ground war\u201d on the United States. A massive jihadi battalion, trained in Miami but backed by al-Qaida, was promising to \u201ckill all the devils we can\u201d \u2013 starting with Chicago\u2019s most famous skyscraper, Sears Tower.\n\nThat was in 2006. Two years later, Morris got a tipoff from someone involved in the trial that the case could be \u201ca bit whiffy\u201d. In fact, it was a colossal stitch-up. The bureau\u2019s biggest counterterrorism scalp of recent times was, says Morris, \u201call a huge lie, before it was called fake news. Totally manufactured nonsense.\u201d\n\nSix broke builders in Liberty City \u2013 the impoverished suburb of Miami where Moonlight was shot \u2013 had fallen under the sway of a local preacher. Narseal Batiste\u2019s cut-and-paste philosophy involved Haitian Catholicism, Judaism, karate \u2013 and a dash of Islam. He mouthed off but lacked the funds, foresight or any particular desire to take things further.\n\nSo the FBI paid informants, including a convicted rapist, to pose as emissaries from al-Qaida and egg Batiste on to accept $50,000 with the promise he would spend it on guns and explosives. He never did. \u201cInstead they wanted work boots and overalls, because they were construction workers, then ceremonial swords and horses to lead a protest to the governor\u2019s house about living conditions in Liberty City.\u201d\n\nMorris chucks up his hands, still agog, 13 years later. \u201cTheir idea was to push Sears Tower into a lake and swamp Chicago with a tidal wave. None of which is remotely possible. They might as well have wanted to invade Washington DC on hippos.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Committed to wallop\u2019 \u2026 Morris on the set of The Day Shall Come. Photograph: PR\n\nOnly one of the seven had any familiarity with the tower. They had no weapons or contact with anyone not being bankrolled \u2013 and scripted \u2013 by the FBI. The deputy director himselfadmitted any plans were \u201cmore aspirational than operational\u201d. Eventually, five of them were sentenced to a total of 44 years in prison.\n\nNext month sees the release of The Day Shall Come, the movie Morris made after being inspired by the case, along with the 400 or so similar ones he has come across since 9/11. He estimates one arrest is made every three weeks of a suspect the FBI has coached into declaring terrorist intent. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to capture real terrorists than it is to manufacture your own. And as someone at the Department of Justice said to me: \u2018We\u2019re not going to stop a system unless it doesn\u2019t work.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe film\u2019s hero is Moses (Marchant Davis), who runs a community farm and preaches peaceful revolution \u2013 aided by dinosaurs, summonable by trumpet \u2013 to a congregation of four, including his wife and young daughter. But a local informant (Kayvan Novak) shops him to a needy FBI agent (Anna Kendrick), eager to impress her boss (Denis O\u2019Hare), himself in need of a high-profile victory. With the aid of a fake sheikh, a literal gift horse for Moses (with whom he talks), and some empty uranium canisters, a case is constructed. Lives are at stake. More pressingly, so are promotions.\n\nSave for directing a few episodes of Veep, this is Morris\u2019s first project since 2010\u2019s Four Lions. He says that he is not concerned the films might be seen as too similar, that only the dopey would confuse the two. \u201cThey relate only in terms of the Wikipedia heading you might lazily use. Four Lions is about a group of terrorists and the flawed male psychology of the typical bunch of guys that constitutes that kind of cell. This is about a group of people the government decides are terrorists. About governments betraying citizens in the name of some bogus war on terror, flawed in its conception and execution.\u201d\n\nThis is also Morris\u2019s first full interview for almost a decade. Today, the most mysterious man in British comedy is wearing shorts, a T-shirt and a checked shirt that, later, he will suddenly unbutton and remove. He has ridden to his agent\u2019s office in Fitzrovia from Brixton, where he lives with his literary agent wife and two sons, on his own trusty steed: a white racer with brass bell and vast panniers. The bike is his own friend and confidant, \u201cpartly because it doesn\u2019t talk back\u201d.\n\nMorris has the alpha confidence of having been the cleverest man in the room for most of his 57 years, and probably the tallest, even without the ringlets on top. A lean wolf dressed as an off-duty headmaster, he also has the longest fingers I\u2019ve ever seen, which rap the table for emphasis or amazement or exasperation. It gets quite a hammering.\n\nMake no mistake: The Day Shall Come is different from Four Lions. Like much of his TV work, that film was an audacious mockery of known bogeymen, albeit slightly more deadly than the claptrap current affairs shows of The Day Today and Brass Eye, or the hipsters of Nathan Barley.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Morris in Brass Eye. Photograph: C4\n\nThe Day Shall Come, however, is a further departure: an imagined riff on an institutional injustice that \u2013 by Morris\u2019s own admission \u2013 has taken him 10 years to gen up on. I loved it. It has a wallop rare in cinema today; when you have done the immersive research, he says, \u201cyou\u2019re committed to wallop\u201d.\n\nThe films he prizes highest \u2013 Come and See, The Battle of Algiers, Son of Saul \u2013 involve \u201cquite insane levels of commitment. False button-pushing has to be resisted as an article of faith. Resist full sentimentality! Set fire to the screen!\u201d\n\nBut does The Day Shall Come assume too much knowledge on the part of the audience? Reaction so far seems split between those with recognition of the situation and those without. A black audience in Philadelphia, Morris reports, responded with nods. \u201c\u2018Yeah, the law is a mincing machine, they\u2019ll take advantage of any frailty you\u2019ve got.\u2019\u201d They indulged Moses and \u201claughed across an icy divide\u201d at the FBI. \u201cYou think: \u2018Oh, this actually is the firing range. We\u2019re sitting in it.\u2019\u201d\n\nMorris\u2019s core audience, though, has exhibited a little resistance. Perhaps such people only like to be challenged so far? \u201cOh God, white liberals are terrible! They\u2019re awful! There\u2019s a sort of feeling that they\u2019ve done the due diligence on their own conscience and if somebody comes in and says something else bad about them, that person must be wrong.\n\n\u201cOf course, I\u2019m talking about my friends here. It\u2019s a sort of privileged position whereby your conscience is allowed to operate in a particular way, without fracturing your worldview. Then they go and have a bracing latte.\u201d\n\nMorris has the flippant strictness of someone who has done his homework and is unsurprised you haven\u2019t. He didn\u2019t feel awkward being a white man telling a black man\u2019s story, he says, \u201cbecause I felt the story had rather rudely impinged itself on me. It was a colour blind inquiry; I was trying to hunt down a lie. And I ended up looking at a system where mainly white people are manipulating mainly black and brown people. That\u2019s the way the gradient is shaped. And people were extremely welcoming, despite my sort of alien appearance.\u201d\n\nHe says that he never considered making a documentary, much as he delights and despairs in the zany details of the real-life cases: the FBI informant sent to infiltrate a Californian mosque who so overdid it, the mosque reported him to the FBI; the fake imam the bureau devised to try and radicalise a Chicago carjacker whose own imam denounced violence. \u201cThey made up their own ideological godfather!\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Betraying citizens\u2019 \u2026 a scene from The Day Shall Come. Photograph: Publicity Image\n\nNo wonder people often laugh when they are being arrested. \u201cIt\u2019s so strongly against their sense of reality. They\u2019ve been living in a Truman Show existence, and then they\u2019ve bumped into the wall.\u201d\n\nYet he still insisted his film be fiction. \u201cYou have to be seductive. There\u2019s a universal story at the heart of this film that\u2019s quite hard to ignore. It doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to work. But what can you do? You have to point things out. And if you run into a room and say: anybody who doesn\u2019t agree is a fucking idiot, you\u2019ve elected to preach to the converted.\u201d\n\nHe swigs his coffee \u2013 black americano, not bracing latte \u2013 and gives the table a breather. \u201cBut I may be talking old-fashioned nonsense language. Because the way to persuade people might be to measure what they think, treat them like a Skinner animal: put some stimulus in their way that makes them behave differently.\u201d\n\nSpend two hours with Morris and you start to realise that, unlike most people in film or TV or comedy, or even journalism or politics, he is a scientist. \u2013 one who happens to like working in the humanities. Raised by two doctors, Morris studied zoology at Bristol, and has essentially been practising it ever since. His mind is as much analytical as imaginative. Institutional irrationality annoys, as do non-contextual metrics and linguistic slippage. At one point I ask if he thinks we need \u201cseismic change\u201d. He explains that the word only applies to earthquakes and volcanoes, so he would have to be in \u201ca certain kind of extreme water to suggest that\u2019s what we need\u201d.\n\nSuch keen observational skills might also explain the sometimes messianic impression he leaves. It\u2019s a bit misleading: Morris is perfectly nice and kind and calm as he completely wipes the floor with you.\n\nIt was during his time at Bristol that he was introduced to operant conditioning, the system pioneered by the American behavioural psychologist BF Skinner, who stuck rats and hermit crabs in (separate) boxes, exposed them to variant forces and recorded their reactions. Morris has de facto been doing this to us for decades. Think what we can still learn from, say, the celebrities who appeared on Brass Eye\u2019s drugs episode and Paedogeddon! special, from the media fallout and the reaction of others to what has or has not happened since to reporting, witch-hunting and moral panic.\n\nActual human-sized Skinner machines are around already, Morris thinks. We\u2019re just kidding ourselves that we\u2019re not trapped in them. The other day, an AA man showed Morris the snazzy monitoring kit in his van, which even recorded how long before a junction he indicated. \u201cI said: \u2018Isn\u2019t that creepy?\u2019 He said: \u2018Not really. My daughter\u2019s just passed her driving test and I\u2019ve got half-price insurance for her. And all I have to do is install a black box recorder in the car and a camera on the dashboard that measures exactly how she drives and the character of her facial movements. As long as she stays within the parameters set by the insurance company, her premium stays low.\u2019\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Four Lions (2010). Photograph: Publicity image from film company\n\nSoon, such tech will run in real time, thinks Morris. \u201cSo any change in her facial alignments will be picked up and a friendly warning on the dashboard will say: \u2018You\u2019re looking a bit tired, there\u2019s a Costa three miles on the right. If you pop in, your insurance level stays low.\n\n\u201cSuddenly, you\u2019ve got a Skinner machine that will nudge you in the direction that it wants you to behave. And we just happily ignore it! Or think it\u2019s amusing. The problem with Black Mirror is it\u2019s set in the future. But this isn\u2019t a paranoid future nightmare. It\u2019s just casually what\u2019s happening in the name of being helpful.\u201d\n\nMorris uses a 2G phone. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s particularly worried about being bugged, as he just assumes we all are anyway. What concerns him is the casual way we \u201cvolunteer data in the interest of some convenience we don\u2019t really need, which is probably going to come back and bite you on the arse much harder than the FBI would\u201d.\n\nHe sighs. People are beasts of instinct, not logic. The seriously poor residents of Liberty City \u2013 like those men stung by the FBI \u2013 voted Trump because \u201cpeople\u2019s sense of what should happen is very, very driven by exactly where they are, and what they think about the status quo. We may look upon it as rash or self-damaging, but it doesn\u2019t feel like that.\u201d Plus, if one person thinks they might have found an escape route, the rest of the tribe will cluster. \u201cWe were a bubble species long before the internet.\u201d\n\nTouring the world with Four Lions, says Morris, confirmed his view that \u201cevery human being is slightly racist and every nation has a different way of being racist\u201d. Australia especially so, he thinks. \u201cWhen did they repeal the White Australia Act? 1975? It\u2019s like a time-slip.\u201d America is \u201craw\u201d because of its recent slavery; Britain\u2019s racism is stranger, more complicated, but no less dismaying.\n\nThe shirt has come off, replaced by a neon cycling jacket for the trip home. Talk turns inevitably to Brexit and Boris Johnson, on whom Morris is reluctant to pass judgment because \u2013 ever the scientist \u2013 he hasn\u2019t observed him up close. Still, he does suspect that today\u2019s leaders are \u201cgiving signals that allow people to walk out into the street and shout their worst thoughts. When, actually, you should have just kept it to yourself, mate.\u201d\n\nAnd, just in case any of those white liberals happen to be reading: this means you. \u201cYou have very, very bien pensant liberals who are just bloody racist about Muslims. People saying: \u2018Well, I think they should dress more carefully, because otherwise they\u2019ll make you feel awkward on the tube and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s under those garments and they\u2019re weird anyway.\u2019\u201d The table gets a final smack. \u201cCome on, guys! We can do better than that.\u201d\n\nThe Day Shall Come opens in the US on 27 September and in the UK on 11 October.
