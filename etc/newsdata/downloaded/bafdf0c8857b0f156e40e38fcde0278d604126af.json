I've had some trolling. People get so invested in the characters - we're in their living rooms three nights a week for two episodes each night so I think people get quite passionate about it.\n\n\"People are not happy with Bethany, there have been a few people that have been really angry with me, it's because it's been so emotional, and Katie and Rob were brilliant.\n\n(Image: Doug Peters/EMPICS Entertainment)\n\n\"I think people thought the kiss should have been somewhere else in the story. I feel like it needed to happen, it's a soap, it's gonna be dramatic and because of what Sinead is going through, she's dying of cancer, and what Daniel is going through, he's losing his wife and that moment he just needed comfort. I feel like it does happen.\"\n\nLucy also announced that she will be leaving the soap in January 2020.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\nShe told us: \"I'm feeling nervous and excited to see what happens. I've got nothing lined up, I feel like I need a 9-week holiday.\"\n\nThe star also confessed that she isn't planning to appear on Strictly Come Dancing anytime soon.\n\n\"I don't think at the moment I want to do that, I want to focus on the acting side.\n\n\"I'd rather do dramas and things, I don't want to say yes to something like that and miss out on anything else.\n\n\"I would never say never to those kind of things, maybe in the future.\"", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Soap star Lucy admitted she has been trolled over Coronation Street scenes as she attends Pride of Britain Awards", "authors": ["Molly Pike", "Image", "Rex Pa", "Mike Marsland Wireimage", "Doug Peters Empics Entertainment", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20745105.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Pride-of-Britain-Awards-2019-London.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
