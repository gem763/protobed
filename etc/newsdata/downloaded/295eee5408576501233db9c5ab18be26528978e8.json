The Women\u2019s March website continued to host their photos and titles as co-chairs through this week, when the group announced the board turnover.\n\nA diverse cast of 16 new board members that includes three Jewish women, a transgender woman, a former legislator, two religious leaders and a member of the Oglala tribe of the Lakota nation will inherit an organization recovering from a failed attempt to trademark the Women\u2019s March name and fractured relationships with local activist groups and the Jewish community.", "description": "", "authors": ["Washingtonpost.Com Dc-Md-Va Womens-March-Cutting-Ties-With-Three-Original-Board-Members-Accused-Anti-Semitism"], "top_image": ""}
