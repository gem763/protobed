Bernie Sanders for the progressive mantle in 2020 Democratic presidential contest.\n\nCisneros and Newman have the backing of Justice Democrats, the progressive group that helped elect freshman U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., last year. They are among eight Democratic candidates who have launched 2020 primary challenges against sitting House Democrats and that are backed by Justice Democrats.\n\nNewman had previously received endorsements from 2020 Democratic presidential contenders Sanders, New York Sen. Kristen Gillibrand and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee. Gillibrand and Inslee both dropped out of the presidential race in recent weeks, while Sanders is neck-and-neck with Warren in many early voting state and national polls, trailing Democratic frontrunner and former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) waves as she takes the stage during the New Hampshire Democratic Party Convention at the SNHU Arena on September 7, 2019 in Manchester, New Hampshire. Nineteen presidential candidates will be attending the New Hampshire Democratic Party convention for the state's first cattle call before the 2020 primaries. More\n\n\u201cAt a time when women\u2019s reproductive rights are under attack daily from Republican lawmakers across America, Illinoisans deserve a leader with an unwavering commitment to fighting for women\u2019s access to reproductive health care,\u201d Warren said. \"Marie Newman is that leader. She understands that this isn\u2019t a moment to back down \u2013 it\u2019s time to fight back.\u201d\n\nWarren on Monday also endorsed two candidates, Kendra Brooks and Nicolas O\u2019Rourke, running for Philadelphia\u2019s city council. The two are aligned with the liberal group Working Families Party.\n\nCisneros is challenging Rep. Henry Cuellar, who was elected in 2004, while Newman is taking on Rep. Dan Lipinski, who has served since 2004 and followed his father Rep. William Lipinski into Illinois' 3rd District seat.\n\nIn this April 14, 2016 file photo Rep. Dan Lipinski, D-Ill. speaks on Capitol Hill in Washington. More\n\nCuellar and Lipinski are two of the most conservative Democrats serving in the House.\n\nLipinski, who fended off a Newman in a close primary race in 2018, opposes abortion rights and was the only Democrat in the Illinois congressional delegation to vote against President Obama\u2019s signature health care law, because it required organizations to provide employees with contraception even if that clashed with a religious group's beliefs.", "description": "The endorsements of immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros in southern Texas and marketing consultant Marie Newman in the Chicagoland district offer\u00a0Warren, a Massachusetts senator, an opportunity to underscore her alliance with the more liberal wing of the Democratic party.", "authors": ["Aamer Madhani", "Usa Today"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/dMMm8MxAVjVmieX8nCNWOA--~B/aD01MTg0O3c9MzQ1NjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media.zenfs.com/en-us/usa_today_news_641/dbdf796eaf08c53612183136773ef82b", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
