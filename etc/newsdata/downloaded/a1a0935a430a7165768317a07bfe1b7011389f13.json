Goldman\u2019s former equities head David Acton and his wife Brooke bought around the corner for $6.2 million in 2012, and that was topped in 2015 when Moelis Australia\u2019s managing director Chris Wyke and his wife Anna bought Walmer House for a suburb high of $7.2 million.\n\nHaving sold Walmer House, Stone McMahons Point\u2019s Annika Bongiorno has set a November 16 auction for Hutton\u2019s home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeeing is believing\n\nThe Dural estate of Gale and Paul McClosky features a grand sandstone manor.\n\nIn Dural, the bushland estate of Laservision chair and founder Paul McCloskey and his wife Gale is on offer for the first time for about $9.5 million.\n\nThe 2.23-hectare property features a sandstone manor built 35 years ago with resort-style inclusions like a home theatre, billiard room, cellar, pool, swim spa and 14-car \u201ccoach house\u201d garage with guest quarters.\n\nThe Dural property is also headquarters to the laser technology and communications giant, making sense of the corporate high-tech studio and suite of executive offices on the title.
