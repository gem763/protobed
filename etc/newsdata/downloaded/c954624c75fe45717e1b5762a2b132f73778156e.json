It\u2019s what I do, because the bag that travels by your side is the bag the airlines can\u2019t lose.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve got that out of the way, here are some other ways to pack right and pack cheap.\n\n1. Carry-ons are often free\n\nAnother reason to use a carry-on? Big airlines generally allow carry-ons for free. All you have to do is make sure the carry-on isn\u2019t too big; the good news is, each airline publishes size allowances on their websites (just look for \u2018baggage\u2019). Pay attention to this, because travelers are sometimes relieved of their oversized bags at the gate, so they can be placed in cargo.\n\nWATCH: HONOLULU AIRPORT WORKER FILMED TOSSING LUGGAGE DOWN CHUTE\n\n2. If you have must pay a bag fee, pay the cheapest one\n\nSmaller airlines like Spirit and Frontier charge a fee for every size bag, and the price varies depending on when you pay; the most expensive fees are slapped on at the airport. Don\u2019t wait \u2014 pay for your bag during the airfare booking process (and book on an airfare comparison site to get the cheapest tickets).\n\n3. Leave your valuables at home\n\nOK, some electronics are must-haves, so keep those in your carry-on, in the hotel safe, or on your person. The valuables you don\u2019t want to bring are things that are easily lost or stolen, like jewelry or maybe super-expensive sunglasses. Also, leave one-of-a-kind items at home, such as a child\u2019s drawing or an award \u2014 whatever. If you want to show these things off to family members, hand them a photo.\n\n4. Let your device multitask\n\nIn many cases, a phone is your library, a flashlight, a camera, TV, diary, document drop. Heck, you can even make calls on it! If tempted to add something to your bag, first ask yourself, \u201cIs this already on my phone?\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\n5. Keep most clothes in your closet\n\nUnless you\u2019re a bride heading to your wedding, nobody really cares what you\u2019re wearing, so leave most of your wardrobe at home. Just be sure that every pair of pants or skirt you pack goes with every top you pack \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have to be the same color, just hues that complement other items. Also, khakis generally weigh less than jeans, so pack accordingly.\n\nAs for footwear, don one pair of shoes and pack just one more. A third pair is OK if it\u2019s something light, like sandals, but you\u2019re trying to save space and keep the bag on the light side (some airlines charge a fee for overweight bags which range as high as $200). Finally, wear your heaviest stuff; you can take your coat off on the plane where you can turn it into a blanket for the ride.\n\n6. Do pack the necessities\n\nSomething for the rain, like a very small umbrella that could fit in a side pocket, or a cheap plastic rain poncho (again, nobody\u2019s going to care what you look like in it). Other necessities: charger cords for phones and other devices, medications, Band-aids, prescription glasses, contacts, and anything else you can\u2019t live without. Make sure to fit these in the carry-on, too.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\n7. Before you go, take some pictures\n\nGet out that phone camera and take a picture of your bag in case you decide to go the checked-bag route, and the airline loses it. With a photo, you\u2019ll have no trouble describing it. Also take pictures of your ID/license, plus any important documents such as passports or doctor\u2019s prescriptions. It\u2019s kind of comforting to have all this important stuff in one safe place. And never place your phone on a table in front of you, where people come and go (like an outdoor caf\u00e9). It\u2019s too easy for someone to reach down, grab it, and keep going.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n8. Pack a snack\n\nA couple of energy bars won\u2019t take up much room and may keep you from spending $7 on a bag of nuts in the airport. And grab yourself a collapsible water bottle, too (I\u2019ve seen them for under $10 online), because you can\u2019t bring water through security, but you can fill up once you\u2019re past the checkpoint. Great for the plane, too, since it\u2019s so easy to get dehydrated in flight.", "description": "If you pack light \u2014 and if you pack right \u2014 you pack cheap.", "authors": ["Rick Seaney", "Rick Seaney Is An Airline Travel Expert", "The Co-Founder Of"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/09/LuggageIstock22.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
