This week, he called on them to protest and even instructed members of his own paramilitary force to be on \"high alert\".\n\nThey could be seen in parts of Baghdad on Friday in a clear show of force.\n\nThe movement is unprecedented in recent Iraqi history both because of its spontaneity and independence, and because of the brutal violence with which a torrent of protests on October 1-6 was met.\n\nAt least 157 people were killed in early October, according to a government probe published on Tuesday, which acknowledged that \"excessive force\" was used.\n\nA vast majority of them were protesters in Baghdad, with 70 percent shot in the head or chest.\n\nSome have backed the government, including the powerful Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary force whose political branch is the second-largest parliamentary bloc.\n\nIraq's mostly-Kurdish north and Sunni west have stayed out of the protests.\n\nThe country has been ravaged by decades of conflict that finally calmed in 2017 with a victory declared over the Islamic State group.\n\nThus began a period of relative calm, with security forces lifting checkpoints and concrete blast walls and traffic choking city streets at hours once thought too dangerous.\n\nRestrictions had even softened around the Green Zone but were reinstated as the October demonstrations picked up in Tahrir Square, which lies just across the Tigris River.\n\nAuthorities also imposed an internet blackout, which has been mostly lifted although social media remains blocked.", "description": "More than a dozen demonstrators died in renewed rallies across Iraq's capital and the south on Friday, with the first reported use of live rounds in this wave of protests.
