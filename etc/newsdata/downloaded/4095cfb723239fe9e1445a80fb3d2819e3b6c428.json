He is being held without bond ahead of a detention hearing scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nFederal prosecutors say Mr. Peng was \u201ctrained in spycraft,\u201d exchanging classified national security information in exchange for cash.\n\nOn six separate occasions, Mr. Peng collected packages at hotels in Northern California and Georgia, according to court documents. In four of those cases, he collected packages containing SD cards with confidential information while dropping off a total of $70,000 for his source, prosecutors say.\n\nThe scheme began in March 2015 after Mr. Peng met with a Chinese intelligence officer, according to court documents. He completed a trial run in June 2015 and completed five more runs through June 2018 prosecutors say.\n\nThe pattern was the same throughout Mr. Peng\u2019s run, according to prosecutors. They say his source would place the SD card in a book wrapped in a bag. The book would be left at a hotel\u2019s front desk for \u201cEd,\u201d according to the criminal complaint.\n\nMr. Peng flew to China on at least one occasion to drop of the SD card, according to court documents.\n\n\u201cComing on top of our many recent Chinese espionage cases\u2014involving both national defense and intellectual property information\u2014this case illustrates the seriousness of Chinese espionage efforts and the determination of the United States to thwart them,\u201d said John C. Demers, Assistant Attorney General for National Security.\n\nMr. Peng is believed to have been working as a tour guide in San Francisco for Chinese students and visitors, according to the criminal complaint. He arrived in the United States on a temporary business visa, but became a naturalized citizen in September 2012.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
