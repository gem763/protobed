But Johnson instead attempted to shut down Parliament from the start of September \u2014 a decision that on Wednesday was ruled unlawful \u2014 meaning MPs did not have a chance to vote on the usual recess schedule.\n\nNOW WATCH: Fox News pundits are using white supremacist language tied to 'The Great Replacement' conspiracy theory", "description": "MPs denied Johnson's request for a parliamentary recess so the Conservative Party's annual conference in Manchester could go ahead as planned.", "authors": ["Adam Bienkov"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/A7_j5veoboJ8Sko.cwKUKQ--~B/aD02ODM7dz05MTE7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/business_insider_articles_888/e6860d52af3d630296e42d6e51ddfe8c", "published_at": "2019-09-26"}
