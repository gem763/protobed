What worries me is that lack of intensity,\u201d Zidane added after Real suffered their first defeat of the season.\n\nWith their midfield players totally suffocated by the PSG duo of Idrissa Gueye and Marco Verratti, Real struggled to bring the ball forward.\n\n\u201cFailing to create proper chances with the players with have up front - Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Eden Hazard - is a weird feeling,\u201d said Zidane.\n\n\u201cYou can play badly but if you have the intensity, if you fight for the ball, you\u2019re in the game,\u201d he added.\n\nPSG indeed showed more enthusiasm and Angel Di Maria opened the scoring in aggressive fashion, bursting into the area to connect at the near post with Juan Bernat\u2019s cross.\n\nGueye then burst through midfield to set up Di Maria for the second.\n\nKeeper Thibaut Courtois was not at his best but Zidane brushed aside any criticism of the Belgian.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s everybody\u2019s fault. We win together, lose together,\u201d he said.", "description": "Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane fumed at his team's lack of intensity after the 13-times European champions started their Champions League campaign with a chastening 3-0 defeat at Paris St Germain on Wednesday.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190918&t=2&i=1431396562&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF8H22I", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
