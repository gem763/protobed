The Hawaii Emergency Management Agency announced the siren was a mistake by 5:16 p.m. on Twitter.\n\nEmergency officials are investigating the incident, Caldwell said. The alarm follows statewide panic in January 2018, when a state employee clicked the wrong option during a practice test, sending an alert to seek shelter from a ballistic missile. It took officials 38 minutes to tell cell phone users the warning was false.\n\n\"What in the actual f*** is wrong with your guys system,\" one user tweeted Wednesday. \"This is twice now I've been in imminent fear for my life. You guys have some explaining to do.\"\n\nMany others were equally unhappy on Twitter:\n\nSirens went off by Waianae Boat Harbor.... Boys and coaches at football practice was tripping out.... AGAIN???? SOMEONE PUSHED THE WRONG BUTTON AGAIN??? \u2014 La Akuna (@LaAkuna) September 19, 2019\n\nAn actual emergency is gonna go down one day and everyone is gonna die clowning Hawaii EMA on Twitter \ud83e\udd21 \u2014 yeeyee (@cinnflavg) September 19, 2019\n\nGet it together HEMA.

There better be resignations over this or there needs to be a congressional hearing on why this keeps happening. Both state and Federal. People need to trust emergency warnings.
