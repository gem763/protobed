Illustration: Lauren Tamaki\n\nBetween shows during a shortened and stuffed Fashion Week that now includes trips to Brooklyn, I plan to catch \u201cParis, Capital of Fashion\u201d at the F.I.T. Museum. Is there any better time than New York Fashion Week to visit an exhibition that defines why Paris has been the capital of fashion for several centuries? The answer might give some much needed perspective to current fashion.\n\nOur sense \u2014 my sense \u2014 of what\u2019s new and interesting is complicated by a barrage of factors that just keep coming. Store bankruptcies and closings. Shrinking media pages and a digital shallowness. That millennial thing \u2014 which is, at best, a shifting target. Is it the big brands, the \u201cicons,\u201d that millennials love or the quirky, don\u2019t-define-me-bitch start-ups? It makes for amazing times. And actually it\u2019s the unprecedented speed of change that I love, the constant obliteration of values and assumptions, maybe more than the new stuff it produces.\n\nSo last evening, a poky rainy start to Fashion Week, I wandered out of a near-deserted Barneys, where I\u2019d been seeking shelter, and down past John Pawson\u2019s sublime monument to minimalism, the boarded-up Calvin Klein store, and into the warm hubbub of the Marc Jacobs boutique. Someone handed me a glass of Champagne. A forest of mannequins sported the black, feather-pieced knit caps from his fall collection. Jacobs, along with his friend the stylist Katie Grand, was again playing host to the young designer Tomo Koizumi, giving him the lower level to present his collection, as he did last season.\n\nTomo Koizumi.

Nicholson\u2019s hair \u2014 or was it a wig? \u2014 was plastered into a sleek, sharp-pointed cone that remained intact through changes and one bridal-like veiling.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s pretty tough hair,\u201d someone murmured behind me.\n\nKoizumi\u2019s overscaled, rainbow-bright creations were dense confections of tulle occasionally pierced with ribbons, and at least one piece came with built-in pantaloons. After each change, Nicholson would flounce and leap about with her unicorn hair, sometimes pausing to examine herself in a mirror, then perhaps fling herself to the floor, Norma Desmond style. Some in the crowd no doubt recalled the famous Viktor & Rolf show, when the model Maggie Rizer, standing in a catsuit on a revolving platform, was dressed in layer after layer of garments. But the point of that performance was to show how a silhouette was built. Nicholson was simply changing costumes and resuming her act.\n\nTomo Koizumi.

The hairstyle was punk by way of the 18th century. The ribbons were straight from Madame de Pompadour\u2019s bodice, the mirror and the self-regarding poses not a selfie but a tiny snapshot of Versailles. The silhouettes and fat sleeves were ancien r\u00e9gime, with perhaps a touch of Japanese tradition, while the lollipop tones held you fast to the greedy present.\n\nRodarte.

I was really taken with the images of the Rodarte collection that Kate and Laura Mulleavy released this week in lieu of a show. The backdrops and colors are in the vein of Franz Winterhalter\u2019s portraits of royals and society women, with a nod to the Surrealists in the deliberately mannered poses of the models. The models include Kirsten Dunst, Yalitza Aparicio, the members of the band Haim, and January Jones and Kiernan Shipka, who, having played the roles of mother and daughter in Mad Men, are now role-playing in a classic \u201cmother and daughter\u201d portrait \u2014 it\u2019s fabulous.\n\nThe clothes are hardly incidental and include dreamy evening gowns and ruffled or head-to-toe metallic looks that, to me, nicely played on the outmoded convention of \u201cday dressing.\u201d True, someone will probably hoot at them and say \u201cHousewives\u201d! Go right ahead. It was the total conception that set this modern fantasy apart.\n\nKhaite. Photo: Getty Images\n\nCatherine Holstein\u2019s Khaite show, this morning in Brooklyn, evoked the past, too, though with different results. Her inspiration was a visit to her grandparents\u2019 former home in Vermont after a break of 20 years. The idea allowed Holstein to deftly mix muted plaids with feminine tulle and jeans with a lovely ruched top with prim, sculptural sleeves. Also strong were well-fitted trousers in prints and solids with smart-looking jackets. But if she\u2019d hoped for the strange effect that a memory can have, that never happened.", "description": "Fashion critic Cathy Horyn reviews the spring 2020 collections of Tomo Koizumi, Rodarte, and Khaite.", "authors": ["Cathy Horyn"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/fashion/daily/2019/09/07/07-cathy-horyn-lede.w1200.h630.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-07"}
