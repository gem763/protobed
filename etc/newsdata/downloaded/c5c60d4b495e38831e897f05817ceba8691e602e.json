We don\u2019t have time for that right now.\u201d\n\nThe presidential candidate \u2014 who declared that America should \u201coutlaw assault weapons and the bullets needed to shoot them\" in the wake of a mass shooting in Odessa, Texas, that killed 7 people \u2014 spoke to the New York Times Magazine on Tuesday, about her surprising run for president.\n\nWriter Taffy Brodesser-Akner trailed the 67-year-old candidate to New Castle, N.H., where she campaigned in July and told an audience member, who asked for advice on healing from Trump\u2019s presidential election, \u201cYour personal anger depletes you. Trump isn\u2019t the problem. The system of complacency is the problem,\u201d while urging \u201cDon\u2019t hate Trump. Love democracy.\u201d\n\nWilliamson, a former cabaret singer and minister of a Detroit Unity church, told the New York Times that running for president wasn\u2019t originally an ambition of hers. Although in 2014, she ran for congressional office as an independent, the Times notes, she only \u201clearned of her presidential candidacy\u201d in 2017, while watching President Trump on television in her New York City apartment.\n\n\u201cThe thought came to me in such a clear and powerful way,\u201d she told the paper. \u201cIt was almost as though I could hear the spirit of my late father: \u2018This must not go unanswered.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe author, who after dropping out of Pomona College in California, published 13 books and appeared on Oprah as a spiritual advisor, shared with the Times that entering the presidential race as an outsider was jarring.\n\nSince Williamson announced her run in January, she\u2019s been ruthlessly mocked for her past and present comments. At a June event in New Hampshire, she claimed that mandatory vaccine laws are \u201cDraconian\u201d and \u201cOrwellian\u201d (she later insisted, \u201cI\u2019m pro-vaccination, I\u2019m pro-medicine, I\u2019m pro-science\u201d). She had also declared diagnosed depression \"a scam\" (of which she afterward admitted was \"wrong of me to say\") and was called a fat-shamer in her 2012 book, A Course in Weight Loss: 21 Spiritual Lessons for Surrendering Your Weight Forever.\n\nIn July, Williamson tweeted, \u201cMisrepresentations of my work are in high gear this morning, so just in case it need be said: I am not anti-vaxx. I am pro-science & medicine. I\u2019ve never suggested to anyone they should pray away their illness & not see a doctor. I\u2019ve never blamed a victim nor fat-shamed anyone.\u201d\n\nMisrepresentations of my work are in high gear this morning, so just in case it need be said: I am not anti-vaxx.

I\u2019ve never blamed a victim nor fat-shamed anyone. \u2014 Marianne Williamson (@marwilliamson) July 17, 2019\n\nHowever, the past eight months hasn\u2019t dissuaded her from running. As Williamson told the New York Times, \u201cPeople would say, \u2018You\u2019re out of your depth.\u2019 I feel I\u2019m in my depth. A deeper conversation is in the depth. I\u2019m the only one who mentioned American foreign policy in Latin America. I\u2019m the only one who mentioned that our health care system is basically a sickness care system. I\u2019m the only one who mentioned what Donald Trump is actually doing, collectivizing fear, and what it will take to override that. So was I out of my depth? Or is the conversation that was being promoted there not chronically superficial? And any conversation which is in fact of depth is made to appear silly?\u201d\n\nWilliamson is surely ready for a new onslaught of attacks. On Monday, one day before Walmart announced a plan to stop selling \"short-barrel rifle ammunition\u201d and handgun ammunition and to cease handgun sales in Alaska following the Odessa mass shooting, Williamson criticized a political system dependent on the National Rifle Association (NRA).\n\n\u201cIt is not just our gun policy but our politics that fails to free us of this insanity,\u201d she wrote in the Washington Post. \u201cUntil we override the nefarious influence of money on our politics, it will not be possible to break the National Rifle Association\u2019s chokehold on our society.\u201d\n\nShe later wrote, \u201cAmerica does not just have a gun crisis; it has a cultural crisis. America will not stop experiencing the effects of gun violence until we\u2019re ready to face the many ways that our culture is riddled with violence.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Lifestyle:\n\nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest for nonstop inspiration delivered fresh to your feed, every day.", "description": "Marianne Williamson told the New York Times of her candidacy, \"I feel I\u2019m in my depth.\"", "authors": ["Elise Sol\u00e9"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/rEv06LGLamfVbi74Llf3Ow--~B/aD0yMjgyO3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/b865a310-ce8d-11e9-b0dc-5d35302ac585"}
