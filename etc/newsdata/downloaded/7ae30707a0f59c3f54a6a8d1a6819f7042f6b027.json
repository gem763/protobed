Seems more like a \u201cI-Struggle-With-Masculinity\u201d parade to me. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Hope they grow enough over the next year to support / join LGBTQ fam next #Pride! \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08 https://t.co/DUb52ktWOP \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) August 31, 2019\n\nPretty sure brain-child AOC missed the point of the parade.\n\nImagine the outrage if a Republican Congressperson tweeted something like this about the Gay Pride parade. Buildings would be ON FIRE and MSNBC would be blaming Trump for creating a divisive and dangerous environment.\n\nBut since they\u2019re straight white dudes \u2026 guess it\u2019s ok for an elected official to discriminate against them.\n\nOne way to support the local LGBTQ community impacted by Boston\u2019s white supremacist parade?

Da heck?\n\nShe\u2019s. Just. Awful.\n\nI guess the point went right over your head. \u2014 Jack Dowd (@JackDowd65) September 1, 2019\n\nSo much so that she made their point FOR them.\n\nAOC, I thought you believed in democracy & want to hear everyone\u2019s voice? All I hear is anger & discrimination from you. A year ago, you were fetching drinks for drunks, now you spend all your time killing jobs in your district. Must be nice to make $180k a year Tweeting hate. \u2014 Glen Woodfin (@GlenWoodfin) September 1, 2019\n\nRight?\n\nI mean, it's fairly problematic how you just assumed everyone's gender. But, I'm enjoying the dinosaur costume person. \u2014 Rachel \ud83d\udc36\ud83d\udc99\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 (@RaychelTania) August 31, 2019\n\nI thought as a congresswoman you should be trying to bring people together. All you do is try to piss people off. This is why you will only be serving one term! \u2014 Scott Weger (@scott_weger) September 1, 2019\n\nWhat an idiotic statement. What moral authority does a inexperienced child like you have over anyone? \u2014 Tbone Corf (@SickofLibPigs) September 1, 2019\n\nNada.\n\nHeterosexuality isn\u2019t a choice. You\u2019re born that way. \u2014 AirborneHeel (@abnheel) August 31, 2019\n\nWell, this is awkward. pic.twitter.com/jbnJo2KsUv \u2014 Duly Elected Totally Not Prejudiced Woman of Color (@Salacious_Tweet) September 1, 2019\n\nThis. ^\n\nRelated:\n\nDude, take the L!
