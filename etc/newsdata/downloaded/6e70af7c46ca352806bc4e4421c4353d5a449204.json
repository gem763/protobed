Photo: Nate Jones\n\nWhen the Location Managers Guild hands out its annual awards next year, they may have a hard time overlooking Joker. For the film\u2019s grungy depiction of a crumbling Gotham City, director Todd Phillips eschewed soundstages, preferring real locations in Brooklyn, Jersey City, and the Bronx. In particular, the latter is home to a steep outdoor staircase where Joaquin Phoenix\u2019s Joker celebrates his descent into villainy with a limb-flailing, crotch-thrusting dance set to Gary Glitter\u2019s \u201cRock and Roll Part 2.\u201d It\u2019s a scene that carries real cinematic power, which means it was almost instantaneously turned into a meme. Now, visitors have found the real steps, and they\u2019ve started showing up in droves. On weekends, crowds begin arriving at this unassuming corner of the Bronx as early as nine o\u2019clock in the morning.\n\nOn a sunny October Saturday, the stairs, which are located off Shakespeare Avenue in Highbridge, were crowded with sightseers from all over the globe. Many film locations look less grand in real life, but the Joker steps remain as imposing as they are onscreen, looming over the beauty-supply and check-cashing shops of Jerome Avenue. With their narrow vertical orientation, the stairs are perfectly suited for the age of the Instagram Story, and their newfound popularity may be aided by the ease of transit from Manhattan: They\u2019re just a short walk from the 167th Street 4 station, itself only one stop away from Yankee Stadium. If you\u2019re in a sociological mood, you could say that the influx of tourists serves as a reminder of how self-reinforcing cycles of low crime and gentrification, as well as a certain internet-enabled frictionless-ness (the stairs have been tagged on Google Maps) have combined to break down notions of which urban neighborhoods are off-limits to newcomers. Instagram makes fl\u00e2neurs of us all.\n\nOn their Showtime show Monday night, Desus and Mero, both of whom grew up in the Bronx, devoted a segment to the stairs, with Desus affecting the persona of a Swiss tourist: \u201cOoh, uhn Jokerstepsen, ja!\u201d In person, locals seemed equally amused by the sudden influx of visitors. \u201cPeople were running away from this shit,\u201d a passerby named Fernando noted. \u201cNobody paid attention to this thing before.\u201d Hilly neighborhoods in the Bronx and Upper Manhattan are full of similar stairways, and to residents these particular steps were notable only for being incredibly inconvenient; most people in the neighborhood preferred a nearby stairway with a gentler slope. For years, Fernando only used them to work out. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing,\u201d he said of their transformation into a tourist attraction. \u201cIt\u2019s actually nice to see all these people doing this.\u201d\n\nMany reports about the steps call those flocking to the location \u201cJoker fans.\u201d That is not entirely correct. Two teenagers from Dallas, who\u2019d come to the Bronx with their dad while the rest of their family took a nap, hadn\u2019t seen the film yet. Neither had a pair of college students from Bangkok. Of a group of high-school freshmen from Woodside, only one had seen Joker, though for the rest of them it was not from lack of interest: \u201cWe don\u2019t have parents who want to go.\u201d It seemed that people were not coming all this way to pay their respects to a location they\u2019d seen in a movie; they were coming to recreate images they\u2019d seen online. \u201cThe meme blew it up,\u201d said one of the Woodside boys. They wanted to get a photo of themselves on the steps, but there was no one to take it. Eventually, I snapped it for them, a gaggle of teens torn between looking happy and looking cool.\n\nVictor, a photographer from Brazil by way of New Jersey, was less shy. He had painstakingly composed a tripod shot at the foot of the stairs, but had no one to press the shutter. I volunteered. He explained that I should hold the button down to fire off shots in machine-gun bursts. As I ducked behind the lens, he positioned himself a few steps up, and then his body burst into a series of theatrical flourishes. None of the first few dozen photos were quite right, so we went again. Then again.\n\nHigher up, the most focus-pulling visitor was Sakina, a young woman from Jersey City decked out in full Joker regalia. \u201cI didn\u2019t get it from Spirit Halloween or anything,\u201d she explained. \u201cI actually happened to find it all at the mall.\u201d She\u2019d seen Joker three times, and was looking forward to going again. \u201cWe\u2019ve never experienced an origin story recreated through a realistic lens. I thought it was really fascinating. Joaquin was amazing!\u201d Sakina had a tiny speaker blasting \u201cRock and Roll Part 2,\u201d and was trying to film a video recreating the dance, which she\u2019d learned that morning. But it was going slowly: Everyone who showed up wanted to take a photo with her. In any event, she didn\u2019t have a YouTube account yet \u2014 the rare case of content coming before the brand.\n\nAt the bottom of the stairs, Sakina\u2019s mother, Maya, struck up a conversation with a retired cop named Sam, who\u2019d trekked over from Throgg\u2019s Neck to get a photo for his son. He hadn\u2019t seen the movie, either. \u201cI just need to let the rush go through,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m retired \u2014 Monday, Thursday, Friday, doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201d He remembered the steps from his time on the beat. \u201cIn the \u201970s and \u201980s, you wouldn\u2019t walk through there. You\u2019d get killed. The drug dealers would stand in the middle, and they\u2019d watch you go up. If you didn\u2019t know somebody, they\u2019d stop you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHoboken was the same way,\u201d Maya said.\n\nAt the opposite end, a man named Michael was carrying groceries past the top of the steps. He stopped to take in the scene. \u201cIt\u2019s strange,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been living here all my life. They\u2019re just stairs to me.\u201d His friend noted the number of broken bottles that were still littering the site. They agreed the city should come in and clean up, just like they did when Joker was filming. Michael pointed out that Halloween was just around the corner. \u201cThere\u2019s gonna be a whole bunch of people dressed up as the Joker posted up taking photos.\u201d\n\nNot everyone in the neighborhood was so sanguine. Per Gothamist, some residents have put up flyers telling visitors, \u201cIt is disrespectful to treat our community and residents as a photo opportunity.\u201d And a few newcomers seemed to be slightly self-conscious about visiting a neighborhood they would ordinarily avoid. Upon stepping off the 4 train, a young blond man with a DSLR around his neck remarked to his companion, \u201cDude, I look like such a tourist right now.\u201d", "description": "The Joker Stairs are located off Shakespeare Avenue in Highbridge.
