I don\u2019t play a ton of Pokemon, but I do enjoy the universe and I love learning more about the creatures in it. So, Here\u2019s Another Pokemon! It\u2019s Shedinja! Thanks for the suggestion GlydeBane!\n\nShedinja Details\n\nType: Bug/Ghost\n\nAverage Height: 2'07\"\n\nAverage Weight: 1kg.\n\nFirst Added In Generation III\n\nThe Pokemon universe is filled with scary, weird, disturbing and confusing creatures. But somehow I keep learning of even weirder and creepier Pokemon. Like Shedinja, a creature that is literally just the husk of another Pokemon. That\u2019s actually, for real, what Shedinja is. This isn\u2019t even a living creature if we\u2019re being technical here.\n\nAccording to Pokedex entries found on Bulbapedia, Shedinja is created when a Nincada evolves into a Ninjask. During this process, the creature apparently molts from its old exoskeleton and leaves behind an empty husk. And for some reason, this dead pile of skin reanimates and becomes a creature.\n\nWhy? I don\u2019t know. Evil ghost magic, perhaps? Weirdly, nobody seems to be that concerned about this zombie beetle. Like, no one is freaking out or asking hard questions about life and death. They just capture and trade them, ignoring the fact that this is a literal corpse come to life.\n\nShedninja has no organs, blood or anything like that. It also doesn\u2019t move at all. It has wings, but they don\u2019t flap. It has a head, but it doesn\u2019t turn. It just moves around like a statue tied to a string.\n\nIf you think I\u2019m exaggerating what Shedinja is, just read the Pokedex description. It states that Shedinja is \u201cA discarded bug shell that came to life.\u201d The Pokedex entries also warn that looking into the hollow body of the creature through any cracks in its back is a big mistake. If you do decide to peek at the non-existing innards of Shedinja, you will get your soul stolen. So not only it this thing a dead bug corpse that floats around, but it is an evil ghost too. Have fun with that thing, kids!\n\nFavourite Fan Art\n\nI would probably scream and run away forever if I ever saw one of these in real life.\n\nRandom Facts", "description": "Every Pokemon is interesting and worth talking about.
