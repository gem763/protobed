So it was very clear when Ambassador Taylor spoke.\u201d\n\nThe Oversight Committee is one of three House panels leading the impeachment probe.\n\nDemocratic lawmakers said Taylor\u2019s testimony marked the most detailed and damning testimony yet in the the impeachment probe.\n\nHowever, many Republicans remained unmoved, describing Taylor\u2019s testimony as an official putting his \u201cinterpretation\u201d on the administrations communications with Ukraine.\n\nDeSaulnier, who was among the 95 Democrats who voted in favor of impeachment in July, said he wasn\u2019t optimistic about House Republicans breaking with their party over the issue.\n\n\u201cThis is so different from when I was a young man when we went through Watergate, where you had people on the Republican side who agreed a line had been crossed ethically and the lines have changed apparently,\u201d he told Hill.TV.\n\nStill, not all Republicans are on the same page.\n\nRep.

He later announced that he would not be seeking reelection next year.\n\n\u2014Tess Bonn", "description": "Rep.
