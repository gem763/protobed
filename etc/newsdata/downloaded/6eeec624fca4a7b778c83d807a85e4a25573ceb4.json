She lived on the same island, just up the road, but she wasn't interested in me,' he told the Herald Sun.\n\nHe said he would only see his mother when he was hungry, often finding her drinking at a club.\n\nHe lived with his grandmother until the age of ten, when she passed away.\n\n'That's when I found life very hard, from ten right through to 16. That's when everything fell apart, because she was the only person that I knew that really cared about me. She looked after me, she loved me, and after she passed away it was the hardest time I've ever gone through, trying to find that person that would do what grandma had done for me,' he said.\n\nMcDonald-Tipungwuti said he felt so alone during this point and he had no love or direction in his life.\n\nHe continued to live at his grandmother's home under the care of his aunties, until it was decided he would live with his brother.\n\nHe lived with his grandmother until she died when he was ten and he moved in with his brother - who tasked him with looking after he one-year-old baby. Pictured with Conrad Sewell\n\nMcDonald-Tipungwuti's brother was a decade older than him and had a one-year-old baby.\n\nHe tasked his younger brother with looking after the infant while he went out clubbing and drinking with the child's mother.\n\nThe future forward was in and out of school - partly to look after his nephew and partly due to bullying.\n\nHe barely knew English and was teased for being a 'loner' and 'dumb'.\n\n'I'd skip school all the time. I'd roam the streets and, in the end, I was on a collision course with bad things as there was no direction, no guidance and no way out in my mind. I was a bit scared of what was ahead,' he said.\n\nThings began to change for the teenager when a new school opened up there - the Tiwi College, where he would meet the woman he now calls 'mum'.\n\nThings began to change for the teenager when a new school opened up there - the Tiwi College, where he would meet the woman he now calls 'mum'.
