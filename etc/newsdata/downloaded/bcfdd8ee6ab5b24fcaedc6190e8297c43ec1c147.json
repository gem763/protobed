Fine, whatever, I could see women wearing these things to Pilates in the West Village. What makes this luxury activewear brand distinct from the rest is that these clothes are also drugs.\n\nAccording to Acabada\u2019s website, this is \u201cthe world\u2019s first ever CBD infused activewear collection.\u201d CBD \u2014 a non-psychoactive cannabinoid thought to have various medicinal properties \u2014 has become an increasingly popular add-on to coffee, candy, sprays, lotions, and cookies among brands looking to charge a bit more for their products, which, I admit, is my first thought upon perusing the Acabada site.\n\nUnder each product\u2019s size and fit are listed the muscle groups targeted by the CBD sewn (?) into the fabric: in the Delancey\u2019s case, for instance, you have 18 grams of CBD targeting the quads, calves, hamstrings, and back. If it works as promised, each item\u2019s CBD, which is known to have pain- and inflammation-reducing properties, could perhaps target the areas affected by exercise. But that\u2019s a big if. Popular as it is, CBD remains under-regulated and often overhyped.\n\nRobert Carson, a pediatric neurologist at Vanderbilt University who studies the use of CBD in treating kids with epilepsy, is similarly wary. \u201cMy first feeling is this is crazy,\u201d he says. \u201cBut, in actually thinking about it, and it kind of pains me to say it, this could be plausible.\u201d Carson makes the comparison to lidocaine patches (used for pain relief) or scopolamine patches (used for seasickness) \u2014 topical medicines can be (and are) transmitted via material worn on the skin. Still, while the delivery system is credible, Carson says there are other factors which complicate this particular product.\n\nAs stated by Baum, the highest CBD content among the Acabada garments is 25 grams, and many have fewer than that. Carson says it might be helpful to think of this amount in its liquid equivalent \u2014 and 25 grams equals less than an ounce. (For reference, a standard shot glass = 1.5 fluid ounces.) (I, too, am picturing dumping a shot on a new pair of leggings.) \u201cGetting that much oil into a garment seems possible,\u201d says Carson, \u201cbut how much of that can get into the skin?\u201d\n\nIn order to know how much CBD is actually transmitted per workout, per person \u2014 and whether there\u2019s any demonstrable effect \u2014 would require controlled, scientific study, which Acabada seems unlikely to pursue. The risk is too high, says Carson: \u201cWe see this with drug companies all the time \u2014 they spend millions and millions on a product, do a clinical trial, and it\u2019s a failure, and then they\u2019re done.\u201d\n\nBeing tested would mean having to prove their product \u201cworks,\u201d but as it stands, Acabada will likely focus on finding enthusiastic spokespeople who can speak to the difference their CBD clothing made in their workout routines. They can also count on repeat customers: Acabada states that their products\u2019 CBD content lasts, on average, 40 uses, which, for someone who works out twice a week, amounts to five months. Who can afford to buy a brand-new CBD sports bra every five months?\n\nSome other questions: is the CBD sweat-activated, or activity-dependent? What if you work out four times a year \u2014 will they really last ten years, or is there an expiration date? Can you wash your drug clothes, or does that suck out some of the CBD? Don\u2019t you most need pain relief after the exercise, when you\u2019d presumably take your CBD workout wear off? Isn\u2019t this what Icy Hot is for? Or even better, Tiger Balm? Would the Delancey jumpsuit look cute on me?
