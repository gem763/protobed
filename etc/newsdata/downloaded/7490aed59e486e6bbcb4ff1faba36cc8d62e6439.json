The S&P 500 slid 1.3% and Nasdaq Composite lost 1.4%.\n\nThe declines came a day after the Commerce Department added 28 Chinese entities to an export blacklist, citing their role in Beijing's repression of Muslim minorities in northwest China. The U.S. said the move wasn't related to trade negotiations with Beijing.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang urged the U.S. to withdraw its move against the Chinese firms, and said, \"China will continue to take firm and strong measures to uphold its national sovereignty, our security and development interests.\"\n\nHigh-level trade trade talks are set to resume Thursday, with a delegation led by China's top trade envoy, Liu He, scheduled to meet with U.S. officials in Washington.\n\nThe Trump administration has rattled markets in recent months with conflicting signals on trade, sometimes threatening to escalate the fight with Beijing while periodically offering signs that a resolution to the dispute is getting closer.\n\nChina's recent large purchases from the U.S. soybean market had signaled a potential thaw in relations. But China has also sought to narrow the scope of the trade negotiations, putting aside national-security issues and adding to market concerns that an immediate resolution is unlikely.\n\n\"They will not reach an agreement at any price,\" said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, a senior analyst at London Capital Group. \"Despite the optimism we see, there's a chance this week ends with another disappointment.\"\n\nShares in Domino's Pizza Inc. erased early declines to trade up 0.3% after the chain pizza restaurant said that sales growth may be slower than previously expected.\n\nElsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 and German DAX were both down 1%.\n\nShares in London Stock Exchange Group fell 4.6% after Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing pulled a $36.6 billion bid for its London rival, a deal that would have united two major trading hubs.\n\nGerman industrial output grew slightly in August, according to official data. The rise was a surprise after a dismal reading on Monday of manufacturing orders for the same month.\n\nIndustrial output increased 0.3% in August over July in adjusted terms, the statistical office said. Despite the better-than-expected output, the industry remains in a downturn, the Ministry of Economics said.\n\nThe British pound also stumbled on political headwinds Tuesday, falling 0.6% against the euro and the U.S. dollar amid increased skepticism a Brexit deal could be reached at the European Union Council of State next week.\n\nThe yield on the 10-year German bund edged down to minus 0.594%, according to Tradeweb, from minus 0.572% Monday afternoon. The yield on 10-year Treasurys also slipped to 1.516%, from 1.552% on Monday. Bond yields fall as prices rise.\n\nU.S. crude oil futures fell 1.2% to $52.11 a barrel, and gold gained 0.5%.\n\nThe Japanese yen and the Swiss franc, both viewed as havens, gained 0.3% against the dollar.\n\nIn Asia, Japan's Nikkei climbed 1% and Korea's Kospi gained 1.2%. Stocks in Shanghai and Hong Kong rose 0.3% as Chinese markets returned from a holiday.\n\nAlexander Osipovich and Eva Dou contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com\n\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\n\nOctober 08, 2019 10:54 ET (14:54 GMT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://morningstar.com/assets/img/30241a1.png", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
