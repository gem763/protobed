Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) and Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) wrote a letter to Ukraine\u2019s prosecutor general, Yuriy Lutsenko, expressing concern at the closing of four investigations they said were critical to the Mueller probe. In the letter, they implied that their support for U.S. assistance to Ukraine was at stake. Describing themselves as \u201cstrong advocates for a robust and close relationship with Ukraine,\u201d the Democratic senators declared, \u201cWe have supported [the] capacity-building process and are disappointed that some in Kyiv appear to have cast aside these [democratic] principles to avoid the ire of President Trump,\u201d before demanding Lutsenko \u201creverse course and halt any efforts to impede cooperation with this important investigation.\u201d\n\nSo, it\u2019s okay for Democratic senators to encourage Ukraine to investigate Trump, but it\u2019s not okay for the president to allegedly encourage Ukraine to investigate Hunter Biden?\n\nAnd then there is Joe Biden. In 2016, the then-vice president threatened to withhold $1 billion in U.S. loan guarantees to Ukraine if the government did not fire the country\u2019s top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin. According to the New York Times, \u201cAmong those who had a stake in the outcome was Hunter Biden \u2026 who at the time was on the board of an energy company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch who had been in the sights of the fired prosecutor general.\u201d The Post reports that it is \u201cunclear how seriously Shokin \u2014 who was under fire by U.S. and European officials for not taking a more aggressive posture toward corruption overall \u2014 was scrutinizing Burisma when he was forced out.\u201d But what is clear is that Biden bragged about getting him fired, declaring last year: \u201cI looked at them and said, \u2018I\u2019m leaving in six hours. If the prosecutor is not fired, you\u2019re not getting the money.\u2019 Well, son of a b\u2014-. He got fired.\u201d", "description": "", "authors": ["Marc Thiessen", "Washingtonpost.Com Opinions Democrats-Investigation-Might-Do-More-Hurt-Biden-Than-Trump"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
