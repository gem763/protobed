In order to flush out the mole, Wright writes, \u201cwe decided to feed what is known in the business as a \u2018barium meal,\u2019 in other words, offer a bait of sufficiently important intelligence that the two-legged source, if he existed, would have to relay it back to the Russians.\u201d A Barium Meal (also sometimes called a \u201cCanary Trap\u201d or a \u201cMarked Card\u201d) \u2014 a piece of meticulously crafted false information, provided to a suspected leaker in the hopes they will pass it on and incriminate themselves \u2014 is a well-known counterintelligence technique, and its use has been documented by all of the world\u2019s top intelligence agencies: the MI5, the CIA, the Russian FSB, and Coleen Rooney, the wife of English soccer star Wayne Rooney.\n\nIn a tweet earlier today, Rooney revealed she\u2019d set a canary trap by planting false information in her (private account\u2019s) Instagram Stories, from which she\u2019d blocked all followers but one. When tabloids wrote up news articles based on information they could only have gotten from those Instagram Stories, it became clear that only the single person watching Rooney\u2019s stories could have leaked them. The noose had been tightened; in its grip was Rebekah Vardy, another WAG. (WAG stands for \u201cWives and Girlfriends,\u201d and is used as a noun in the U.K. to describe the partner of a soccer star.)\n\nThis has been a burden in my life for a few years now and finally I have got to the bottom of it...... pic.twitter.com/0YqJAoXuK1 \u2014 Coleen Rooney (@ColeenRoo) October 9, 2019\n\nVardy has, naturally, responded on Twitter herself, insisting that she would never, how could Coleen do this while Rebekah is pregnant, etc. This is, first and foremost, absolutely top-notch celebrity gossip, even if you\u2019re not a soccer fan. (I sense this story will do more to make soccer popular in the United States than the MLS ever has.) But I was struck when reading Rooney\u2019s statement by the extent to which the ordeal had the smell of a national-security story: Not just the relatively sophisticated counter-intelligence technique Rooney used, but the amassing of evidence, the sudden announcement of the uncovered plot, the terse statement. It felt not entirely unlike the FBI\u2019s surprise statement in 2010 that it had identified 10 Russian spies, who it had been monitoring for a decade, in the U.S. It wouldn\u2019t be entirely surprising to hear that Rebekah Vardy was being deported to The Sun in a prisoner swap with Rooney.\n\nFamous people have always feuded with, backbit about, and leaked on each other, of course. But it\u2019s rare to see such a formal declaration, or one that uses such advanced methods \u2014 a sort of next-generation, Cold-War version of the hot war Kanye West and Kim Kardashian waged on Taylor Swift. We increasingly think of the internet\u2019s mega-platforms as state- or government-like entities, and perhaps we should start thinking of celebrities (who are, these days, only the front-facing chief executives of a complex backstage brand machinery) in the same way: The WAG as sovereign institution, fiercely protective of its informational borders, engaged in sophisticated protections of its self-determination \u2014 which is to say, in this environment, its ability to determine how it is covered and what kinds of attention are paid to it.\n\nOr maybe that\u2019s taking it too far. Maybe it suffices to say that this era of social media has a tendency to make spies of us all: sifting, gathering, and analyzing intelligence from vast feeds of data. Twitter and Instagram, like occupied or enemy territory, can be confusing and impenetrable, on both a social and technical level; what better way to describe the project of understanding the shifting conditions on the ground of a social platform than espionage? If Coleen Rooney is paranoid, it\u2019s only as much as James Jesus Angleton and the CIA ever were. If the people reading your feed are potentially enemy assets, why shouldn\u2019t you be engaged in vigilant counter-intelligence?
