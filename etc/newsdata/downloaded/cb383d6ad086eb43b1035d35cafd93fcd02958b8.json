Both the Biden campaign and Sen. Elizabeth Warren are calling on Big Tech to step up censorship and prohibit the president from engaging in protected political speech.\n\nElizabeth Warren has an ongoing feud with Facebook over its policies protecting first amendment rights. Warren said in a tweet, \"Facebook changed their ads policy to allow politicians to run ads with known lies -- explicitly turning the platform into a disinformation-for-profit machine.\"\n\nWarren of all people should be defending the rights of politicians to tell lies. For decades, she falsely claimed to be a Native American. And more recently, she can't stop repeating the lie about losing a job because she was pregnant.\n\nIn a bizarre decision, Warren then decided to test the waters of Facebook\u2019s tacit embrace of the First Amendment by running a political ad supporting Donald Trump. The ad falsely claims that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg had endorsed Trump for president. \"We intentionally made a Facebook ad with false claims and submitted it to Facebook's ad platform to see if it'd be approved. It got approved quickly and the ad is now running on Facebook. Take a look.\"\n\nWe intentionally made a Facebook ad with false claims and submitted it to Facebook\u2019s ad platform to see if it\u2019d be approved.

But even so-called \"fact-checkers\" were quick to point out that federal law requires broadcast networks to run campaign ads. So Warren lies even when she's accusing other people of lying.\n\nAnd Warren's claim that \"Facebook already helped elect Donald Trump once,\" sure sounds like a conspiracy theory to me. In Warren's mind, all this Trump-being-president stuff could have simply been avoided if Facebook had done a better job censoring \"fake news\" back in 2016.\n\nIn a speech at Georgetown University last Thursday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg gave a strong defense of his company\u2019s decision not to censor political speech on its platform. \u201cI know many people disagree, but, in general, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for a private company to censor politicians or the news in a democracy,\u201d Zuckerberg told the crowd. \u201cAs a principle, in a democracy, I believe people should decide what is credible, not tech companies.\u201d\n\nFor instance, people decided Warren's claims of Native American ancestry were not credible years before Warren revealed her DNA results.\n\n\"While I worry about an erosion of truth, I don't think most people want to live in a world where you can only post things that tech companies judge to be 100% true,\" Zuckerberg said.\n\nWarren was outraged at Zuckerberg's speech. She doesn't want people hearing what the Republicans have to say! Elizabeth Warren wants a monopoly on telling lies.\n\nMark Zuckerberg& - 39;s speech today shows how little he learned from 2016, and how unprepared Facebook is to handle the 2020 election. https://t.co/2JHCuihexR \u2014 Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 18, 2019\n\nKamala Harris is simply calling for President Trump to be banned from Twitter.\n\nIn a statement, a Biden campaign spokesperson said, \"Zuckerberg [had] attempted to use the Constitution as a shield for his company's bottom line, and his choice to cloak Facebook's policy in a feigned concern for free expression demonstrates how unprepared his company is for this unique moment in our history and how little it has learned over the past few years.\"\n\nDemocrats need Facebook to know what the liberal media figured out years ago: If Republicans are allowed to speak, people will start listening to them. And if Big Tech caves into demands from Democrats to censor their political opponents, Big Tech really will have a role in deciding the next president.", "description": ".10/23/2019 5:41:49AM EST.", "authors": ["Bronson Stocking", "Matt Vespa", "Timothy Meads", "Julio Rosas"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2016/298/1caae66a-11ed-42b7-8f50-cfe01c27eb96.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
