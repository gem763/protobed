Kevin Garnett scores, and Howard\u2019s face spreads into a shit-eating grin. \u201cHoly shit,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m gonna cum.\u201d\n\nIt feels almost comforting to see Sandler, who turned 53 this week, acting a dope onscreen. Dopiness is his bread and butter. \u201cWe grew up with him,\u201d the directors of Uncut Gems, devious brother-duo Josh and Benny Safdie, gushed before the film\u2019s premiere, before urging the audience to chant \u201chappy birthday, Sandman!\u201d in unison. Minutes later, as the lights went down, someone in the crowd broke the silence with another shout: \u201cOSCAR FOR THE SANDMAN.\u201d\n\nTo date, the Sandman has a grand total of zero Oscars. He\u2019s never been nominated, and has only ever piddlingly entered into the awards conversation at all. What he can boast is nine wins and more than 30 nominations at the Razzies, or anti-Oscars, which are annually awarded to the year\u2019s worst movies and performances. Most of these Razzie \u201cvictories\u201d were for Jack and Jill in 2012, and 2014\u2019s Grown Ups 2 was nominated in almost as many categories. Both of these movies were total critical disasters, almost universally designated by critics as noxious heaps of garbage.\n\nAll of this is to say that, for Sandler these days, you\u2019ve gotta sift through a dumpster fire filmography for the gems. This is an actor whose career probably should\u2019ve been in the gutter 20 years ago, and yet somehow he\u2019s still kicking\u2014and often earning at least $20 million per movie. So how did the Sandman end up here, on his 53rd birthday, at a serious film festival beside serious auteurs as an audience calls, sort of seriously, for his Oscar?\n\nAt its peak in the era of \u201990s rom-coms, much of Sandler\u2019s appeal was his boyish, love-starved, underdog charm, the way he could milk sympathy for his mild downtroddenness like a sweetly pathetic puppy. This posturing doesn\u2019t really work for Sandler in middle age, when droopy-cute eventually turns into just plain droopy. His evolution into stultified middle age is even mocked in Sandler\u2019s most recent Netflix trifle Murder Mystery, which ventures to make his progressively saggy jowls and sleep apnea the butt of several limp jokes. When we think of Sandler these days, this Murder Mystery character is most likely the image that appears, given that he\u2019s been kept busy churning out movies to fulfill his production company\u2019s deal with Netflix.\n\nUncut Gems, I\u2019m thrilled to report, will get you high enough that you forget all that. It falls under a category that really amounts to Sandler\u2019s side gig: the critically acclaimed, auteur-driven films that Sandler will step out of D-grade movie hell to star in every couple of years. The last time this happened was with Noah Baumbach\u2019s The Meyerowitz Stories in 2017, and it was a beautiful thing that year to watch the world remember how groovy and good Sandler can be.\n\nIn Uncut Gems this feeling is even more pronounced. The movie is an often oppressively tight character study of Sandler\u2019s Howard, a hustler jeweler and gambling addict who owes a bunch of angry people a bunch of money he doesn\u2019t have. In a goatee, tinted glasses, and diamond earrings, Howard is a bundle of manic energy, yelling, cursing, careening through the streets at a mile a minute. The Safdies pair his frenzy with an equally fraught score and zippy tracking shots that escalate the bipolar mood, painting Howard by turns as an almighty Greek god and pitiful nutty wretch\u2014both of which prove equally intoxicating, and often laugh-out-loud funny, too.\n\n\u201c It\u2019s Sandler\u2019s most enthralling performance since Paul-Thomas Anderson\u2019s \u2018Punch-Drunk Love,\u2019 and perhaps even better suited to his persona. \u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Sandler\u2019s most enthralling performance since Paul-Thomas Anderson\u2019s Punch-Drunk Love, and perhaps even better suited to his persona. For underneath his bland doofiness, Sandler\u2019s always nurtured a well of nervous energy. PTA understood this, probing the depths of the actor\u2019s outsider guise by imbuing him with an almost-scary hostility. Now the Safdies have gone even further, pushing Sandler\u2019s neurosis to its explosive extreme while hanging onto the thing that made him lovable in the first place: his humor.\n\nWhen Netflix renewed its four-movie deal with Sandler\u2019s Happy Madison production company, most people groaned. They knew what was coming: the scripts seemingly written overnight, the phoned-in performances, the jokes that feel plucked from a dated sitcom. But the deal only verified what box offices have been proving for years: Most people around the world are still ready to turn out for Sandler, lethargy and saggy jowls included, and Netflix is smart to capitalize on his enduring appeal.\n\nWith well-deserved kudos to the Safdies, this year critics can eagerly join that camp. An Oscar for the Sandman, indeed.", "description": "\u201cUncut Gems,\u201d the frenzied jeweler drama from the Safdie brothers, proves that Adam Sandler has much more left in him than recent movies like \u201cMurder Mystery\u201d made it seem.", "authors": ["Natalia Winkelman"], "top_image": "https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_1687,w_3000,x_0,y_0/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1568144642/190909-winkelman-uncut-tease_p0ryyd", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
