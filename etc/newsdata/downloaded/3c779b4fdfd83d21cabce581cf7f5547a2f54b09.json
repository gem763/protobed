After six weeks of agonising over what on earth happened to Hannah Roberts (played by Laura Haddock) and the impossible case of Shaun Emery (Callum Turner), The Capture closed tonight with a tragic ending for the framed soldier.\n\nAfter discovering he was merely a pawn to expose corrupt CCTV evidence, Shaun eventually handed himself into police a hero with PTSD, taking the wrap for the barrister\u2019s murder to protect what is a head ache of a moral dilemma: is it wrong to fake someone\u2019s crime if you know they\u2019re guilty?\n\nShaun Emery\u2019s tragic fate was inevitable in The Capture (Picture: BBC)\n\nShaun\u2019s story appears to be wrapped up. He\u2019s behind bars but he knows his daughter and ex-girlfriend are behind him, which we learned over the course of the six episode run is that really mattered to him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, detective Rachel Carey (Holliday Granger) blindsided all of by bursting into a private meeting with Danny Hart (Ben Miles) and DSU Gemma Garland (Lia Williams) to take a sudden U-turn and join the crusade to take down potential terror threats via any means possible \u2013 including a lie. Although, it almost panned out very differently for Rachel as Holliday Granger filmed alternative endings.\n\nBut surely there\u2019s an ulterior motive? And if so, does that mean there\u2019s a series two?\n\nWill there be a series 2 of the Capture?\n\nMetro.co.uk caught up with writer Ben Chanan who hinted there\u2019s definitely more of Rachel\u2019s story to explore, and after the success of series one, we\u2019d say there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll be catching up with the detective again.\n\n\u2018I am thinking about [series two],\u2019 Ben told us. \u2018We are talking about it but I cannot confirm or deny I\u2019m afraid.\u2019\n\nThat sounds like a done deal to us, and Ben agreed Rachel\u2019s move raises questions which need to be answered.\n\n\u2018I think Carey joining them at the end is a moral tragedy,\u2019 he continued. \u2018She\u2019s deciding it\u2019s best for her in every sense, to go along with it. It could be life threatening to her but it could also enhance her need to know the truth about things and this is where the truth is revealed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018There is ambiguity about what she\u2019s going in there for and I\u2019m going to leave that there\u2026\u2019\n\nThe Capture is available to stream on iPlayer.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
