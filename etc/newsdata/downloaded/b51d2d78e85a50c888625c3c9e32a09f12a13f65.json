You may recall this young activist's role in pioneering the climate strike movement and being the catalyst for her generation's worldwide movement towards a cleaner Earth. In her cover interview, Thunberg opens up about her personal struggles with depression, which she notes fuels her desire to continue the fight for climate change. In fact, her next global climate strike is scheduled to begin on Sept. 20. {Teen Vogue}\n\n\n\nIs Extinction Rebellion out-marketing fashion?\n\nClimate activist group Extinction Rebellion's threat to end London Fashion Week didn't quite come to fruition, as London Fashion Week is still in action. The group \u2014 who most recently smeared blood across their chests and staged a die-in \u2014 may not have succeeded in canceling fashion week but they are making a lot of noise. Their demands for the fashion industry to change its environmental practices have made headlines and prompted consumer awareness of the negative impact of fashion, an industry that is a major source of toxic chemicals and damaging pollution. {Business of Fashion}\n\n\n\nThe business of street style\n\nCustomers are now able to shop directly from street style imagery, making street style retail's new preferred selling tool. Retail buyers and fashion directors have been driving sales as of late, as the power of the influencer's reach begins to decline. For this reason, retailers have named their own staff as brand ambassadors and those to promote the latest season's merchandise. {WWD}\n\n\n\nKarl Lagerfeld tribute shirts to be sold on Farfetch\n\nStarting Sept. 26, Karl Lagerfeld tribute shirts will be sold on Farfetch. The shirts, which have been designed by Cara Delevingne, Kate Moss, Tommy Hilfiger, Diane Kruger, Takashi Murakami, Carine Roitfeld and S\u00e9bastien Jondeau, will each be replicated 77 times and sold for 777 euros each. The money from the sale of the shirts will go to Sauver la Vie, a charity that funds medical research at Paris Decartes University. {WWD}\n\n\n\nHow much is a celebrity's name worth?\n\nAs might be expected, celebrity-affiliated beauty and fashion brands have experienced faster growth than their non-celebrity branded counterparts. So how much is a celebrity's name actually worth? Beauty brands like Kylie Cosmetics and Fenty Beauty by Rihanna have amassed more sales in one year than their successful competitors have done in years. However, just having a celebrity's name tied to a brand doesn't guarantee its success. Rashida Khanom, associate director of beauty and personal care at Mintel, says \"it's a combination of a dedicated fan base, the right product and a strong business strategy\" that makes these brands successful. {Vogue Business}\n\n\n\nMoschino to show Pre-Fall 2020 collection in NYC\n\nMoschino will show its Pre-Fall 2020 womenswear collection in New York on Dec. 9. This show, which will take place at New York's Transit Museum in Brooklyn, will be the brand's first runway show in New York. \"New York felt new. New York, like fashion, never sleeps. If you can make Moschino there, you can make Moschino anywhere,\" says Jeremy Scott, the brand's creative director. {Fashionista Inbox}\n\n\n\nNever miss the latest fashion industry news.
