And the gentlemen\u2019s agreements that hold our fragile democracy together are often only as good as the paper they\u2019re not written on.\n\nThe rusted levers of our democracy are long overdue an upgrade. Take the Lords: the fact that over half our parliament is unelected ignores the voice of voters. And as The Independent has long made clear, Westminster\u2019s undemocratic voting system leaves millions of voters ignored at every election.\n\nThe winner-takes-all mentality of first-past-the-post elections encourages parties to ignore everyone except the base they need to win. It\u2019s no surprise our politics are so polarised and toxic. Countries with fairer electoral systems see cross-party collaboration not as a betrayal, but as something essential for the common good.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nWe can no longer avoid discussing how to reform our broken system. It\u2019s now time to set out a positive path for how politics works via a \u201cconstitutional convention\u201d of citizens.\n\nWe can all agree that power is too distant, out-of-touch and centralised. Now we urge all parties to back the Electoral Reform Society and others\u2019 call to do what\u2019s right, and work together to find a way forward.\n\nDarren Hughes\n\nChief Executive, Electoral Reform Society\n\nProtecting the Union\n\nThe Westminster leader of the SNP, Ian Blackford, has now made clear the price of SNP support for a possible future Labour government will be a second independence referendum. It will be an odd look for a new Labour prime minister of the UK to dangle a route to the break-up of that union as an incentive for others to back him.\n\nPerhaps some elsewhere in the UK might be prepared to contemplate that cost to see their party in power, but many who value Scotland\u2019s positive place in the UK would sadly conclude there\u2019s now one less party they can vote for.\n\nKeith Howell\n\nWest Linton\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

However, more and more private landlords are being forced to reconsider the property investment/letting market in view of the crackdown on tax benefits, extra stamp duty on buying more properties and the prospect of Mr Corbyn as prime minister.\n\nSurely a total rethink is necessary on our housing problem, from more affordable housing being built, investment by councils to not punishing the supposed \u201cgreedy landlord\u201d. Supply and demand hold sway in all areas, and just highlight the lack of overall long-term investment by successive councils and governments.\n\nMargaret Burke\n\nWhat really matters\n\nThe skies will not fall down if the UK leaves the EU on 31 October. We will still have insurmountable obstacles that have eluded us since time immemorial: from time travel to climate change, overpopulation, species extinction, the mysteries of DNA. Let alone the underfunding and understaffing of public services, cuts, the gender pay gap, religious prejudices, homelessness and housing shortages.\n\nThe complexities of the universe remain as elusive and intertwined as ever. Time to refocus our energies on unlocking them for the betterment of humanity.\n\nDr Munjed Farid Al Qutob\n\nLondon\n\nNot my cup of tea\n\nFollowing on from my protest regarding the use of leaf blowers, I\u2019d like to call out coffee machines that use capsules. Your Saturday IndyEats included an article introduced thus: \u201cQuick, convenient and downright tasty, the humble coffee capsule has revolutionised our daily cuppa (part in thanks to a rather suave George Clooney).\u201d\n\nFirst, I had always thought a cuppa was tea. A coffee is a coffee. But perhaps you thought you were being witty. Second, in what way, exactly, is a coffee capsule \u201chumble\u201d? It\u2019s over-packaged \u2013 and, therefore, damaging to the planet \u2013 and requires a bespoke machine. I recommend the truly humble filter or cafeti\u00e8re approach to a good coffee.\n\nThird, I\u2019m not sure I can be bothered to discuss Clooney and his advertising choices \u2013 except to say, perhaps, thank goodness he didn\u2019t promote leaf blowers.\n\nBeryl Wall\n\nLondon", "description": "The prorogation shambles has highlighted the weakness in our constitution: we\u2019re constantly just a hair\u2019s breadth from chaos.
