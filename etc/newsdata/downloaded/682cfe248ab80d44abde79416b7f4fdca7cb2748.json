China's decision to enter the Korean War in the fall of 1950 scotched U.S. efforts to unify the peninsula. The rapprochement between Richard Nixon and Mao Zedong in the 1970s compelled the two Koreas, fearing abandonment by their respective allies, to seek their own rapprochement, however temporary, in July 1972. The current trajectory of U.S.-China relations under Donald Trump towards strategic competition spells dire consequences for South Korea. Caught between its security patron and its giant neighbor, South Korea will be increasingly forced to choose between a rock and a hard place.\n\nSouth Korea's preferred position has always been to hedge its bets and act as a bridge-builder or \"middle power\" that can accommodate both Washington and Beijing's desires. But now it is under growing pressure to take sides.\n\nThe strategic reality for South Korea is that China is a behemoth neighbor that will never go away. The sheer size of the country is terrifying. China, a permanent ally of North Korea's, has a defense budget more than six times larger than South Korea's and an economy nine times larger. Moreover, history tells us that nation states in close proximity that do not share the same regime type, for instance democracy versus autocracy, tend to view each other as a threat. Recent Asan Institute polls show that 66 percent of Koreans perceive a threat from China. And yet South Korea cannot simply afford to ally itself with the U.S. against China's rise.\n\nThe dilemma for South Korea, in short, is that it cannot disengage from the Chinese economy to which its future is tied even as it maintains its strategic relationship with the United States. Since 1992, bilateral trade has increased more than 37-fold; China surpassed the U.S. to become South Korea's largest trade partner in 2003; and in 2015 the two signed an FTA removing tariffs on 90 percent of goods.\n\nThen there is the problem of reunification. South Koreans believe that even though Beijing remains allied with Pyongyang, eventually Seoul will need to buy Chinese acquiescence and strategic understanding to bring about reunification. That will mean renegotiating extractive industry contracts with Beijing; seeking Chinese understanding if it wants to maintain its alliance with the U.S.; and soliciting China's help in securing the northern border. Put simply, while denuclearization negotiations with North Korea require the United States, reunification of the Korean Peninsula requires China.\n\nAs a result South Korea's policies toward China are surely the most complex problem among U.S. allies in the Indo Pacific. And numerous hues of gray are something Americans find difficult to understand. The current strategic competition between Washington and Beijing effectively reduces the space within which South Korea can maneuver; instead, it forces it to choose on almost any issue where the U.S. and China diverge. Unfortunately for the U.S., South Korean choices increasingly tend toward delinking from U.S. interests.\n\nOn a list of 10 issues in the last six years that divided the U.S. and China, South Korea has effectively chosen to distance itself from U.S. interests in six. This was not a partisan matter in the country. Both conservative and progressive governments chose China. For example, when the U.S. and Japan opposed China's declaration of an air defense identification zone in the East China Sea in 2013, the Park Geun-hye government first quietly sought Beijing's agreement to exclude the submerged rocks of Ieo, and only when China refused did Seoul oppose the ADIZ with its American ally.\n\nAnd when the U.S. asked Seoul to support its push for an open and rules-based Indo-Pacific order, the Moon Jae-in government demurred for fear of alienating China and still does not openly support the strategy.\n\nThe trend only appears to be getting worse. On economic national security issues like 5G, the combination of U.S. pressure on South Korean companies to abandon business with Huawei and the South Korean government's relative inaction in giving instructions to the telecom sector are bound to damage the alliance, since the private sector makes its choices based on economics and not political strategy. And if the Trump administration goes further in its trade war against China and calls for a ban of semiconductor chip exports by \"like-minded allies and partners,\" then South Korean companies and the government will face an extraordinarily difficult decision, which in the end may not go in favor of Washington.\n\nA 60 percent \"defect\" rate for a U.S. military ally should sound alarms bells in Washington. The message here is that even if the U.S. is justified in pursuing a confrontational trade and security course against China, it must factor in the costs and benefits in terms of collateral damage to its allies.", "description": "U.S. Must Factor Collateral Damage to Allies into China Policy", "authors": [], "top_image": "http://english.chosun.com/site/data/img_dir/2019/10/14/2019101401216_0.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
