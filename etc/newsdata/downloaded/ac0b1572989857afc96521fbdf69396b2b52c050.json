Since the beginning of the movement, protesters have been following a common dress code: an all-black outfit. So far, no student from Wan\u2019s school has been arrested. When asked if he\u2019s worried about being arrested, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s no point in being scared, because the police are already arresting people indiscriminately.\u201d\n\nSecondary schools hold sit-ins and form human chains against anti-mask law\n\nSome schools, including La Salle College and St Paul\u2019s College, postponed their Dress Casual Day. A student from St Paul\u2019s College told Young Post that the school had announced the postponement through an e-notice, without proposing a new date for the activity, nor stating the reasons for the decision. Students had to wear their uniform to school today. Yet, Lau, a 17-year-old student, who is also a concern group member, said students were called on to wear a mask and put a black shirt on top of their uniform, and head to the school playground during recess.\n\nAbout 200 students showed up to the activity. They also waved a black flag that read \u201cLiberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our times\u201d, and sang the movement\u2019s anthem, Glory to Hong Kong.\n\nThe move was not supported by the school, which had previously urged students not to participate. But Lau said, \u201cStudents won\u2019t back down and succumb to the white terror. With the recently enacted anti-mask law, there will only be more students who choose to come out [against injustice].\u201d", "description": "Groups including Demosisto called on teens to wear the protester uniform during today's annual charity event.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://yp.scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/900x506/public/images/whatsappimage2019-10-10at18.54.04.jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
