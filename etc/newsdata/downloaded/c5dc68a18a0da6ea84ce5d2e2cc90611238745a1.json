An anniversary fact check.", "language": "en", "text": "At a 9/11 commemoration at the Pentagon on Wednesday, President Trump expanded on his lengthy history of recollections of Sept. 11, 2001, and its aftermath.\n\nBefore digging in, it is worth quoting at length.\n\nI vividly remember when I first heard the news. I was sitting at home watching a major business television show early that morning. Jack Welch, the legendary head of General Electric, was about to be interviewed, when all of a sudden, they cut away. At first, there were different reports: \u201cIt was a boiler fire.\u201d But I knew that boilers aren\u2019t at the top of a building. \u201cIt was a kitchen explosion in Windows on the World.\u201d Nobody really knew what happened. There was great confusion. I was looking out of a window from a building at Midtown Manhattan, directly at the World Trade Center, when I saw a second plane at a tremendous speed go into the second tower. It was then that I realized the world was going to change. \u2026 Soon after, I went down to Ground Zero with men who worked for me to try to help in any little way that we could.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s unpack this.\n\nAs the millions of Americans who witnessed the worst terrorist attack in U.S. history on live TV can attest, news shows did cut away from regularly scheduled segments to broadcast a live view of the World Trade Center towers after the first plane hit. Those same millions watched with horror as the second plane struck the second tower a few minutes later.\n\nBut Trump\u2019s claim here is a little different. He said he \u201cwas looking out of a window from a building at Midtown Manhattan\u201d that he had previously identified as his \u201chome\u201d when he watched the second plane hit with his own eyes, not on TV.\n\nTrump\u2019s penthouse at Trump Tower is on the 58th floor \u2014 high in the New York skyline \u2014 so it is possible that he had an unimpeded view of the World Trade Center all the way down on the southern end of Manhattan.\n\n[On 9/11, as the Pentagon burned, the White House couldn't find Donald Rumsfeld]\n\nThere are reasons to be skeptical, though. While on the campaign trail in 2015, he told rallygoers:\n\n\u201cI have a window in my apartment that specifically was aimed at the World Trade Center because of the beauty of the whole Downtown Manhattan. And I watched as people jumped, and I watched the second plane come in.\u201d\n\nThis an odd claim, considering that Trump Tower was four miles from the World Trade Center, and it would have been difficult to see people jumping from that distance. But for those millions who watched on TV, the sight of people jumping can never be forgotten.\n\nHowever, in an April 2019 tweet, sports columnist Rick Reilly said he once visited Trump Tower and looked through a telescope aimed at Downtown Manhattan. He said Trump told him, \u201cI saw the towers come down thr[ough] that telescope.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, my God,\u201d Reilly said he responded, to which Trump said, \u201cSolid gold.\u201d\n\nI once looked thru his telescope in his Trump Tower apt. that looked downtown. He said, \"I saw the towers come down thru that telescope.\" I lifted my head up. \"Oh my god,\" I gasped.\n\n\"Solid gold,\" he said.#Narcissist \u2014 Rick Reilly (@ReillyRick) April 12, 2019\n\nThere is one thing we do know for certain about Trump\u2019s whereabouts 18 years ago. In the afternoon, producers for WWOR in Secaucus, N.J., were desperate to broadcast something besides a loop of the planes hitting the towers. As The Washington Post\u2019s Timothy Bella reported last year, one of them thought to get a celebrity on the phone for an interview, and soon after, they reached Trump on his private penthouse line.\n\nA few minutes later, he was live on air. \u201cI have a window that looks directly at the World Trade Center, and I saw this huge explosion,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow, I\u2019m looking at absolutely nothing. It\u2019s just gone. It\u2019s just hard to believe.\u201d\n\nThen, when asked whether his building at 40 Wall Street, several blocks from Ground Zero, had seen any damage, Trump responded: \u201c40 Wall Street actually was the second-tallest building in downtown Manhattan, and it was actually, before the World Trade Center, was the tallest \u2014 and then, when they built the World Trade Center, it became known as the second tallest. And now it\u2019s the tallest.\u201d\n\nBrenda Blackmon, who was co-anchoring, told The Post in 2018: \u201cAny reaction I had, in the midst of everything that was happening, was, wow, that\u2019s insensitive. It just was.\u201d\n\n[The photo of the doomed 9/11 \u2018Dust Lady\u2019 still haunts us after all these years]\n\nSo that was the day of the attacks. In the Pentagon speech Wednesday, Trump also said, \u201cSoon after, I went down to Ground Zero with men who worked for me to try to help in any little way that we could.\u201d\n\nThis appears to be another version of a claim Trump began making only two days after the attacks and has continued to make, without providing evidence, for years.\n\nAs The Fix\u2019s Philip Bump reported in 2016, Trump was seen by multiple people in the media area outside the Ground Zero site on Sept. 13, 2001.\n\nAnd he did an on-air interview with a German outlet, during which a reporter asked him whether he would be involved in the reconstruction.\n\nTrump responded: \u201cWell, I have a lot of men down here right now. We have over 100, and we have about 125 coming. So we'll have a couple of hundred people down here.\"\n\nHe said something similar to an NBC News reporter the same day: \u201cI have hundreds of men inside working right now, and we\u2019re bringing down another 125 in a little while. They\u2019ve never done work like this before. And they\u2019re hard-working people, but they\u2019ve never seen anything like it.\u201d\n\nShe then asked him whether he had spoken to his men at the site and how they were reacting. He said, \u201cWell, there are a lot of them, but they\u2019ve never seen bodies like this. \u2026 The great thing is when they find somebody that\u2019s alive, like the five firemen that they just found a little while ago. \u2026 So they are working very, very hard, but it\u2019s a very depressing situation for these folks.\u201d\n\nLast year, the fact-checking website Snopes contacted two men who were deeply involved in the Ground Zero effort. One, a retired FDNY deputy chief, told Snopes that he never saw a large crew hired by Trump in the months he spent at Ground Zero, and that \u201cthere would have been no need for it.\u201d The other, a construction demolition expert who now runs a 9/11 first responders foundation, also said he knew of no evidence of a Trump-hired crew.\n\nThere is also a problem with the claim that it was \u201cgreat\u201d when his men \u201cfind somebody that\u2019s alive.\u201d This would mean that his men would have been at Ground Zero the day before, on the morning of Sept. 12, because the last survivor, a woman named Genelle Guzman-McMillan, was pulled from the rubble 27 hours after the towers collapsed.\n\nThese inconsistencies haven\u2019t stopped Trump from repeating versions of this story over the years. On the campaign trail in 2016, he said, \u201cEveryone who helped clear the rubble \u2014 and I was there, and I watched, and I helped a little bit \u2014 but I want to tell you: Those people were amazing.\u201d\n\nAnd two months ago, at a Rose Garden ceremony with 9/11 first responders, he said, \u201cAnd I was down there also, but I\u2019m not considering myself a first responder. But I was down there. I spent a lot of time down there with you\u201d \u2014 prompting frequent White House critic George Conway to push the satirical hashtag #LostTrumpHistory on Twitter.\n\nOn Wednesday at the Pentagon, the story seems to be tempered somewhat; he said he went down to Ground Zero \u201cto try\u201d to help. He didn\u2019t say that he did.\n\nRead more Retropolis:\n\n#LostTrumpHistory: Trump\u2019s 9/11 claims become a George Conway-pushed meme\n\nTrump\u2019s Fourth of July history speech: Turns out there weren\u2019t airports back then\n\nOn 9/11, as the Pentagon burned, the White House couldn\u2019t find Donald Rumsfeld\n\nThe photo of the doomed 9/11 \u2018Dust Lady\u2019 still haunts us after all these years\n\nF-16 pilot was ready to give her life on Sept. 11", "description": "The president told yet another story Wednesday about how he experienced the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.", "authors": ["Gillian Brockell", "Staff Writer For Retropolis", "September At Pm"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/Im9dXohUt7LZlwfJ8zIWByVGfyk=/1484x0/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/09-11-2019/t_bca2e3a855f94bf6b58028a0cc2d0e02_name_Trump_911_scaled.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
