REUTERS/Toby Melville\n\nIn a pivotal week that could decide the future of Brexit and the fate of the world\u2019s fifth largest economy, Johnson is trying to strike an exit deal with the EU to allow an orderly departure on Oct. 31.\n\nBut Johnson must navigate the complexities of EU politics to strike a deal at an Oct. 17-18 EU summit and then try to convince a deeply divided British parliament on Oct. 19 to ratify any deal.\n\nIf he succeeds, Britain will leave the bloc on Oct. 31 with arrangements to minimise disruption at borders and preserve the complex supply chains that underpin swathes of the economy.\n\nIf he fails, Britain faces an uncertain future - lawmakers will begin a battle to delay Brexit that could end up being decided in the courts, while Johnson will fight for a no-deal exit at the end of the month to ensure his political survival.\n\nBritish and EU negotiators are working through the weekend see if they can turn proposals put forward by Johnson, which were initially rejected by the EU, into a deal that works for both sides.\n\n\u201cNegotiations seem to be taking a more serious turn and that\u2019s encouraging,\u201d Jacob Rees-Mogg, a Brexit-supporting Conservative lawmaker who runs the government\u2019s business in parliament, told Sky News.\n\n\u201cIt is always difficult to put specific odds on things but it\u2019s certainly looking more positive this week than it did last week,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson is due to brief cabinet members on progress in those talks by conference call at around 1145 GMT.\n\nIf Britain leaves the EU without a deal, many expect serious short-term disruption with possible food, fuel and medicine shortages, and long term damage to Britain\u2019s reputation as a safe and stable home for foreign investment.\n\nThe government says it is doing everything it can to get a deal, and that it has contingency plans to mitigate the impact of a no-deal exit.\n\nIreland has proved the toughest issue in the Brexit talks: specifically how to prevent the British province of Northern Ireland becoming a backdoor into the EU\u2019s markets without having border controls.\n\nIreland fears controls on the 500-km (300-mile) border with Northern Ireland would undermine the 1998 Good Friday Agreement which ended three decades of sectarian and political conflict that killed more than 3,600 people.\n\nA WEEK IS A LONG TIME\n\nTo leave with a deal on Oct. 31, Johnson has just days to convince the EU to accept a compromise on border arrangements and then get leaders to sign off on a deal at an Oct. 17/18 EU summit in Brussels, likely to last late into the night.\n\nAlthough the talks have made more progress than many expected a week ago, sources in Johnson\u2019s office have said that a deal remains a long way off, echoing caution on the EU side of the negotiations.\n\nThe Sunday Times reported that Johnson will speak to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker by the end of Monday.\n\nIf successful in Brussels, Johnson then has to win a vote in the divided parliament that rejected his predecessor Theresa May\u2019s deal three times earlier this year. A vote is expected to take place in a rare Saturday session of parliament on Oct. 19.\n\nSince becoming prime minister in July, Johnson has yet to win a vote in parliament and, after kicking 21 lawmakers out of his party for not backing his Brexit plans, is well short of a majority.\n\nWhile his opening bid in the latest phase of negotiations with the EU received cautious endorsement at home that suggested it could find the necessary support in parliament, much will depend on the final shape of any deal.\n\nRelated Coverage Countdown to divorce: Meetings that will decide Brexit\n\nThe three main opposition parties, Labour, the Scottish National Party and Liberal Democrats are expected to oppose it.\n\nThat leaves Johnson\u2019s hopes pinned to a group of Labour rebels and the small party which notionally keeps him in power, Northern Ireland\u2019s Democratic Unionist Party.\n\nThe DUP position is unclear, after the party\u2019s deputy leader Nigel Dodds said the mooted eleventh-hour solution to the deadlock over Brexit could not work.", "description": "Brexit talks with the European Union aimed at striking a last-minute divorce deal are getting serious, Britain said on Sunday, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson prepared to update his cabinet on the state of negotiations.", "authors": ["William James", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191013&t=2&i=1440341926&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9C0BX", "published_at": "2019-10-13"}
