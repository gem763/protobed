Just roll down your car window, awkwardly yell into a box, and your food will materialize soon enough. But if you\u2019ve been waiting more impatiently than usual in the drive-thru lane recently, new data suggests it\u2019s not just your imagination.\n\nAccording to QSR Magazine\u2019s annual Drive-Thru Performance Study, fast food customers are indeed experiencing longer wait times than they used to. Their data suggests that the average customer waits for 255 seconds between placing an order and picking up their food, an increase of 20 seconds compared to 2018.\n\nWhat\u2019s responsible for the slowdown? QSR cites factors like bloated and increasingly complex menus, as well as an increase in mobile orders that add a new, unresolved wrinkle to restaurant logistics. It could also just be that more people are using drive-thrus, causing a kitchen backup.\n\nWatch: Popeyes Chicken Sandwich Review\n\nOf course, not every fast food chain is created equal when it comes to drive-thru speed. Dunkin\u2019, which has a relatively streamlined, breakfast-oriented menu, tops the speed rankings with an average time of under 217 seconds. The fact that they do much of their business during breakfast, which has an average speed of service of under 239 seconds, is also likely a factor.\n\nMeanwhile, Chick-fil-A is the biggest offender when it comes to slow drive-thru service, clocking in at nearly 323 seconds for the average order. That\u2019s despite the introduction of employees who move up and down the line of cars with ipads to both take orders and process payments. Given Chick-fil-A\u2019s immense popularity, it could just be that high demand is taking a toll.\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\nWhile technology can help to streamline the order process, improving drive-thru wait times might ultimately rest with speeding things up in the kitchen. For Arby\u2019s, who clocked in at a below-average 263.46 seconds, getting that number down is about tightening things up behind the scenes. \"We know we've got very complex menu items, and our guests are demanding those,\u201d said Arby\u2019s COO John Kelly. \u201cSo we have to make sure that the engine that we build in our kitchen is able to execute them in a very efficient way.\u201d\n\nSo the next time you\u2019re stuck waiting a while in your car, just know that the people who make big bucks selling you conveniently-available meat are aware of the slow service and want to fix it. And if you\u2019re really fed up with it, just get out of your car and walk into the dang restaurant.", "description": "New data shows the average fast food joint is 20 seconds slower than in 2018.", "authors": ["Tim Nelson"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/G9MYvCDf1gTh_aSM22JZ1w--~B/aD01MjY7dz03MDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/myrecipes_643/608c018b159e6378ae94eb02b940ccef"}
