Some of her games, like Cybele, which is about a relationship that takes place over an MMO, have been semi-autobiographical. Now, Freeman and her real-life partner, Jake Jeffries, have turned their relationship into an intimate video game called We Met In May. Kotaku spoke with both of them about what that process was like.\n\nThe avatars in We Met In May are representations of Freeman and Jeffries, and in four short vignettes, they invite you inside their relationship. Unlike the more melancholy Cybele, We Met In May is full of warmth and often extremely funny.\n\nOne vignette has Nina and Jake pouring sand all over each other on a beach date; another has Nina trying to hide her anime paraphernalia on Jake\u2019s first visit to her house. My personal favourite vignette is called \u201cStrike A Pose,\u201d which takes place in a vintage shop in Portland that Nina and Jake often visit. In that one, Nina tries on outfits, which then allows her to do magical girl-esque poses that knock over the avatar of Jake, flinging his body head over tail. When I played that game with my own boyfriend, he laughed at this sequence, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s me when I see Gita.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the silliest but most true-to-life vignette in We Met In May is the one where Nina\u2019s goal is to tweak Jake\u2019s nipples while he\u2019s cooking.\n\n\u201cI am absolutely like that and definitely do that in real life,\u201d Freeman told me over the phone last week, while Jeffries laughed. The specificity of these vignettes makes them feel universal. I may not tweak my boyfriend\u2019s nipples, but I do find ways to irritate him \u2014 out of love \u2014 on a daily basis.\n\n\u201cA lot of big games\u2019 [romance] stuff feels like cheesy Hollywood,\u201d Jeffries said. \u201cOr it\u2019s just generalised like\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then they fell in love and lived happily ever after!\u201d Freeman interjected. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely reflective of our interests. We both like weird romantic comedy stuff, and\u2026 it\u2019s very much based on real, smaller moments.\u201d\n\nAccording to Freeman, the whole genesis of We Met In May began with \u201cBeach Date,\u201d because no one else they knew loved sand, and pouring sand all over each other, as much as they do. They had only been dating for a couple of months but decided to put the game together for a game jam.\n\n\u201cI think for us a lot of these games came from the kind of place where it\u2019s like, a funny, poignant memory that really sticks out to us amongst all the other good moments,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cI think the ones we picked were the ones we saw mechanics in.\u201d\n\nAll of the vignettes in We Met In May are about the body in direct or abstract ways, she said, which guided her as a developer. \u201cEverything comes from a very physical place to draw on for the mechanic.\u201d\n\nFreeman specifically mentioned \u201cBeach Date\u201d and \u201cNothing To Hide\u201d as examples. Pouring sand naturally lends itself to a funny, physical mechanic, and positioning Nina\u2019s body in front of her anime body pillows also felt naturally game-like, in that it presents the player with a choice and a clear representation of what that choice denotes. For Freeman, it\u2019s about finding the moments in life where the various emotions associated with dating \u2014 affection, anxiety, excitement \u2014 are expressed physically.\n\nIn We Met In May, being in love isn\u2019t something that occurs at the end of a story. It\u2019s an active experience, reflected in tiny moments that are the sum total of the closeness you feel with another person.\n\nOne of my favourite details in \u201cBeach Date\u201d is that the game will pause and zoom in on Nina and Jake when they lock eyes. It\u2019s a visual representation of a moment that\u2019s hard to put into words \u2014 the moment where you just know.", "description": "Nina Freeman\u2019s calling card as a developer is allowing a player to enter into her life.
