It is a Fifth Estate alongside the other power structures of society,\u201d he said.\n\nZuckerberg framed the company\u2019s decisions around that concept, including its recent retreat from years of aggressive courtship of China, an obstacle to his vision of connecting the world\u2019s population.\n\nHe attacked the rapidly growing Chinese-owned app TikTok, saying the short video platform censored political protest, including in the United States, a charge the company denies.\n\nIn leaked audio of an address to Facebook employees weeks earlier, Zuckerberg spoke about TikTok as a formidable competitor, calling it the first consumer internet product built by a Chinese tech giant to find global success, but did not mention its approach to speech.\n\nRelated Coverage Martin Luther King's daughter tells Facebook disinformation helped kill civil rights leader\n\nOver the course of Facebook\u2019s charm offensive, Zuckerberg met with Chinese President Xi Jinping, learned Mandarin and posted a photo of himself running through Tiananmen Square.\n\nFacebook briefly won a license to open an \u201cinnovation hub\u201d in Hangzhou last year, but it was later revoked.\n\nZuckerberg effectively closed the door to China in March, when he announced his plan to pivot Facebook toward more private forms of communication and pledged not to build data centers in countries with \u201ca track record of violating human rights like privacy or freedom of expression.\u201d\n\nHe repeated his concern about data centers on Thursday, this time specifically naming China.\n\n\u201cI wanted our services in China because I believe in connecting the whole world and I thought we might help create a more open society,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cI worked hard to make this happen. But we could never come to agreement on what it would take for us to operate there, and they never let us in.\u201d\n\nHe received a question from the audience about what conditions or assurances he would need to enter the Chinese market, but did not address them in his response.\n\nFacebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg arrives to address the audience on \"the challenges of protecting free speech while combating hate speech online, fighting misinformation, and political data privacy and security,\" at a forum hosted by Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service (GU Politics) and the McCourt School of Public Policy in Washington, U.S., October 17, 2019. REUTERS/Carlos Jasso\n\n\u201cFEIGNED CONCERN FOR FREE EXPRESSION\u201d\n\nZuckerberg also defended the company\u2019s political advertising policies on similar grounds, saying Facebook had at one time considered banning all political ads but decided against it, erring on the side of greater expression.\n\nThat assertion was immediately panned by critics, among them candidates seeking the Democratic presidential nomination who have asserted the company should do more to address disinformation and abuse ahead of the November 2020 election.\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s campaign quickly accused Zuckerberg of using \u201cthe Constitution as a shield\u201d for Facebook\u2019s bottom line.\n\n\u201cHis choice to cloak Facebook\u2019s policy in a feigned concern for free expression demonstrates how unprepared his company is for this unique moment in our history and how little it has learned over the past few years,\u201d said spokesman Bill Russo.\n\nU.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, another leading contender for the Democratic nomination, has been especially vocal about her critiques of Facebook, bashing its advertising policy and calling for the company to be broken up on antitrust grounds.\n\nShe recently challenged Facebook\u2019s policy that exempts politicians\u2019 ads from fact-checking, running ads on the social media platform containing the false claim that Zuckerberg endorsed Trump\u2019s re-election bid.\n\nBut the focus on free speech is likely to win Zuckerberg some friends on the right, whom he has been courting aggressively in a recent visit to Washington and dinners at his home in California.\n\nRepublican lawmakers routinely accuse the company of showing \u201canti-conservative bias\u201d in its content moderation, without offering evidence. The company denies any favoritism.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nFacebook has been under scrutiny after finding Russian propaganda on its platform which many believe affected the outcome of the 2016 U.S. presidential election, won by Donald Trump.\n\nTrump has disputed claims that Russia has attempted to interfere in U.S. elections. Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied it.", "description": "Facebook Inc Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday defended the social media company's light regulation of speech and lack of fact checking on political advertising, while citing China's censorship as a roadblock to operating in the country.", "authors": ["David Shepardson", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191017&t=2&i=1441997462&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9G1XK", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
