It was discussed at a legislative hearing Wednesday. Representatives from Uber and Lyft did not attend.\n\nThe bill would require drivers to have digital or pin codes that they provide to riders. It also would prevent anyone but the ride-hailing companies from selling signs with their logos that are intended to mark cars as Uber or Lyft vehicles.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Members of Congress are asking ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft to improve safety and clean up their act.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Cathy Bussewitz"], "top_image": "", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
