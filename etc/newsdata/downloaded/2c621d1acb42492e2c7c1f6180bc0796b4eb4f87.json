She went to Georgetown University, where she hung a poster of the Taj Mahal on her wall, a quick answer to, but where are you from. After college, she went to work as a financial analyst, before moving into public health. In 1995, she spent two years in India with the Institute of Current World Affairs and later published a book about the experience. It concludes with Jayapal, in Seattle, becoming an American citizen. \u201cIn understanding India\u2019s influence on me, I no longer needed to try so hard to maintain it,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI no longer needed to prove anything.\u201d\n\n\n\nAfter the planes hit the Twin Towers, Jayapal decided to establish an advocacy organization for immigrant groups. It registered new Americans to vote and sued the Bush administration to stop 4,000 Somalis from being deported, bold moves at a time when many Democrats supported measures to detain, question, and deport immigrants suspected of terrorist activity. In 2014, she was elected to the Washington state Senate, and in 2016, to Congress.\n\nI first noticed Jayapal in 2017; she was the one person in either Congress or the White House I\u2019d seen comment on the repression of Muslims and other minorities in India. She kept my attention by doing what I, personally, was not used to seeing members of Congress do. In her first term, she was arrested on Capitol Hill for protesting Trump\u2019s immigration policies. This could have been a politically calculated performance, for all I knew, but there was a boldness to it, a breaking with the way things are done.\n\nShortly after the midterms, Jayapal was chosen to join Pocan as the new chair of the Progressive Caucus. As an activist, a woman, and an immigrant, she was a strong candidate. In her first public statement, she chose her words carefully; she was committed, she wrote, to a \u201cbold and strategic\u201d caucus. For Jayapal, those two ideas\u2014boldness and strategy\u2014don\u2019t have to be in conflict.\n\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s always trying to think down the road a little bit,\u201d she told me. \u201cWhat am I going to get out of this? What is the endgame here?\u201d To begin, she engineered a way to put such rising stars as California\u2019s Katie Porter on key committees. \u201cPolitical power is built,\u201d Jayapal said. \u201cIt\u2019s built through discipline and procedures, but it\u2019s also built through structures.\u201d She has raised the dues members pay to belong in the caucus, added staff, and built a stronger whip operation to better inform her members, forcing them to act as one. (The whip operation, she acknowledged, still isn\u2019t operating as it should.)", "description": "Can the progressive congresswoman transform the left's unruly energy into legislative victories?", "authors": ["Emily Tamkin"], "top_image": "https://images.newrepublic.com/95b575c57bf2eb309fa8f9285d25f246c9309dac.jpeg?w=1109&h=577&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-09"}
