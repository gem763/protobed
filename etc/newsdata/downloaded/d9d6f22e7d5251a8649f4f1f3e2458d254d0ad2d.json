Josh Fuentes hit his first big league home run.\n\nMiles Mikolas (9-13) went five innings and allowed three runs on five hits. He struck out five and walked one.\n\n\u201cThey had some tough at bats, fouled a lot of balls off,\u201d Mikolas said. \u201cI did my best to keep the ball on the ground but they got a couple up in the air. It\u2019s kind of self-explanatory when that happens here. The ball can do some tricky things here but I think overall it was an OK outing.\u201d\n\nColorado scored in the first on an RBI double by Arenado, but the Cardinals turned to the long ball again as Ravelo homered leading off the second.\n\nSt. Louis moved in front 4-1 on a sacrifice fly by Wong despite a fine play by Arenado. The star third baseman made a running over-the-shoulder catch in foul territory and turned and threw a one-hop strike to home, but a charging Bader knocked the ball loose from catcher Dom Nunez in a bang-bang play at the plate.\n\nOzuna led off the third with a home run against Melville (2-2).\n\n\u201cThey jumped on Tim, no doubt about it, with the long ball,\u201d Rockies manager Bud Black said. \u201cTough outing for him as far as five runs over three innings. But you\u2019ve got to get the ball down. You\u2019ve got to elevate pitches at times, but you\u2019ve got to elevate it just high enough where swings get underneath it. That was the case this afternoon, with those four home runs off Tim.\u201d\n\nLeading 6-3 going into the ninth, the Cardinals broke through for four more runs as reliever Wade Davis walked two and hit Paul DeJong with a pitch before giving up a two-run double to Matt Carpenter. Jake McGee relieved and Andrew Knizner had an RBI single with another run coming home on a balk.\n\nUMPIRE SHAKEN UP\n\nHome plate umpire Gerry Davis was struck in the chin by a foul tip off the bat of Fuentes in the fourth. The ball hit Davis with such force that it knocked his mask to the ground. After being looked at by medical personnel, Davis was escorted into the clubhouse for further examination. He was replaced behind the plate by first base ump Brennan Miller, and the rest of the game was handled by three umps.\n\nDOUBLE WHAMMY\n\nFowler also figured in the Cardinals\u2019 most recent two-homer start to a game. He and Tommy Pham hit successive home runs to open a game at Milwaukee on April 3, 2018.\n\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\n\nRockies: CF Ramiel Tapia was a late scratch from the starting lineup because of lingering soreness in his bruised right knee. Tapia left Wednesday night\u2019s game early after fouling a pitch off the inside of the knee.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCardinals: Return home for a key series against NL Central Division rival Milwaukee with RHP Adam Wainwright (11-9, 4.16 ERA) slated to pitch Friday night\u2019s opener. Wainwright\u2019s 16 career wins against the Brewers are the most among active pitchers.\n\nRockies: RHP Jeff Hoffman (1-6, 7.06 ERA) is making his sixth start this season at home, where he has gone 1-3 with a 7.33 ERA as Colorado opens a series against San Diego. He\u2019s bidding for his first win since May 29 against Arizona.\n\n___\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The St. Louis Cardinals had the upper hand from the start on a day the ball was flying out of Coors Field.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Dennis Georgatos"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/cardinals_rockies_baseball_06009_c0-183-4728-2939_s1770x1032.jpg?47853c96fbe3ea6e2554fe29ec52db7ed426a07a", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
