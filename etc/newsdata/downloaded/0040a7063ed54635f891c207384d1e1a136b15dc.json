And yes, Mark Zuckerberg, I\u2019m looking at you.\u201d\n\nFor Facebook, the situation is tricky. The social media company has struggled in recent years with what to allow and disallow on its site, especially after revelations that Russian operatives used the platform during the 2016 presidential election to post disinformation to inflame the American electorate. Facebook has moved to clamp down on false content. Yet when the company removes or buries messages, ads, photos and videos, it is often called out for bias and censorship. Facebook has faced particular wrath from conservatives, who have said the social network intentionally suppresses what they say.\n\n\u201cFacebook believes political speech should be protected,\u201d a spokesman for Facebook said on Saturday. \u201cIf Senator Warren wants to say things she knows to be untrue, we believe Facebook should not be in the position of censoring that speech.\u201d\n\nMs. Warren\u2019s campaign declined to comment on Saturday beyond her Twitter thread and Facebook ad.\n\nTruth in social media advertising is likely to become a bigger issue ahead of the 2020 presidential election. Mr. Zuckerberg is scheduled to speak about Facebook\u2019s political speech policies this coming week at Georgetown University.\n\nPresidential candidates have been spending huge sums on ads on Facebook and other social media platforms to reach voters. Some campaigns have focused on advertising specifically on Facebook given its sheer size \u2014 it has more than 2.2 billion users worldwide \u2014 and the ability to spread ads and content cheaply and quickly across the platform.\n\nLike her rivals for the Democratic nomination, Ms. Warren has spent a significant amount of money on Facebook advertising, which is a crucial way to reach potential grass-roots donors. Over all, her presidential campaign has spent more than $3.3 million on Facebook ads, according to numbers disclosed by the company.", "description": "The Democratic presidential candidate bought the ad to goad Facebook into removing misinformation in political ads, escalating her feud with the social network.", "authors": ["Cecilia Kang", "Thomas Kaplan"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/12/us/politics/12warren-facebook/merlin_162445950_8279f9c5-affd-4bca-ba9c-f116a8b65ac6-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
