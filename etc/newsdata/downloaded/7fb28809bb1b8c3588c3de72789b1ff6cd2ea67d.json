This was allegedly executed by \"waiving the fee, but charging the customer anyway, and applying the payment to up to three DirecTV Now accounts using fake email addresses.\"\n\nThe complaint claims customers were not told they had been signed up for a subscription, and that the company is said to have fielded regular complaints from customers who said that they were billed for accounts they did not sign up for. The complaint also details other alleged methods for increasing subscriptions without clients' consent.\n\nThe purpose of these efforts, the lawsuit alleges, was to create the false impression that the service was compensating for declines in the legacy DirecTV satellite business, and to help justify the company's acquisition of Time Warner, now called WarnerMedia. WarnerMedia is CNN's parent company.\n\nAT&T T CNN Business askedto respond to the merits of the lawsuit as well as for comment on specific allegations within it, such as claims the company pressured employees by setting aggressive sales targets and that employees were encouraged to use unrelated fees to create DirecTV Now accounts.\n\nRead More", "description": "A new shareholder complaint against AT&T claims the company encouraged employees to create fake accounts for its DirecTV Now streaming service to juice its subscriber numbers and mislead investors ahead of its acquisition of Time Warner, shareholders allege in an amended complaint filed last week as part of a lawsuit against the company.", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz", "Cnn Business"], "top_image": "https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190917123154-att-directtv-now--stock-super-tease.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-17"}
