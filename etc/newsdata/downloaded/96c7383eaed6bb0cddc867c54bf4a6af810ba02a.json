AP\n\nAs Democrats face off in third 2020 primary debate seeking to challenge his 2020 reelection bid debated in Houston, President Trump lambasted their proposals during a long, counter-programming speech in Baltimore, casting their positions on immigration, guns, health care and the economy as fringe views antithetical to the values of everyday Americans.\n\nIn remarks at the House Republican Conference member retreat Thursday night, Mr. Trump denounced the \"left wing agenda\" of the crowded field of Democrats running for president. He falsely accused them of supporting \"open borders\" and \"unrestricted migration,\" as well as backing a campaign designed to confiscate guns from law-abiding Americans.\n\nMr. Trump also said Democratic-led polices fueled poverty in urban areas, telling the friendly audience that his administration is committed to curbing homelessness in cities.\n\n\"We're going to have to step in and do something about it,\" he told the crowd.\n\nThe president has previously trashed Baltimore's Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings and his majority African American district.", "description": "As 10 Democratic presidential candidates seeking to challenge his 2020 reelection bid debated in Houston, Trump lambasted their proposals during a long, counter-programming speech in Baltimore", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2019/09/13/2460da5c-6d0a-4581-ae59-476b04f8f12f/thumbnail/1200x630/a23d3f6f313eac0fda95ac8c63aba767/ap-19256040130804.jpg"}
