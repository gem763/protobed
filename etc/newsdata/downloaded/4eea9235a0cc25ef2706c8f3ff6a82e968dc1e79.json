He suggested a government reshuffle was possible.\n\nThe rallies have gone on for a week despite the government announcing reforms to try and defuse them and win over Western donors.\n\nBanks have shut their doors for six working days.\n\nIn a statement, carried on the state news agency, Lebanon\u2019s Association of Banks said they would remain closed on Friday to protect customers, employees and properties.\n\nIt urged a political solution to the crisis and \u201creassured citizens that the banks are ready to resume their work as soon as the situation stabilizes.\u201d Bank operations will be limited to providing month-end wages via ATMs, the statement added.\n\nThe emergency reform plans announced this week include halving ministers\u2019 salaries and long-delayed steps to fix the finances of the state drowning in debt.\n\nThis has so far failed to appease discontent or prod Western donors to go ahead with pledged financing.\n\nPrime Minister Saad al-Hariri also said the banking sector would shell out 5.1 trillion Lebanese pounds ($3.4 billion) to help cut the 2020 budget deficit, including through a tax hike on profits.", "description": "Banks in Lebanon will remain closed until stability is restored out of safety concerns, the banking association said on Thursday, as protests raged demanding the government resigns.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources_v2/images/rcom-default.png", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
