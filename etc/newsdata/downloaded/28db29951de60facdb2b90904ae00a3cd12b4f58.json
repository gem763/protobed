Its 2020 phase is designed to upgrade its ability to counter medium- and intermediate-range missiles and potential future inter-continental ballistic missiles through the deployment of the SM-3 Block IIB interceptor.\n\nWhile NATO has denied that the system is directed against Russia, Norway and Russia share a 122-mile border, and an element of Norway\u2019s decision is a reluctance to antagonize its neighbor.\n\n\u201cI think [the decision] will prevent increased tension [with Russia],\u201d Julie Wilhelmsen of the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs told Norwegian news agency NTB.\n\nOn Tuesday, Norwegian defense chief Haakon Bruun-Hanssen requested another $3 billion to improve the country\u2019s defense, in the belief that Russia could blockade Norway in the event of a conflict, resulting in a need for access for NATO reinforcements. Norway would also be expected to contribute fighter jets and large naval vessels to the NATO mission if necessary.", "description": "Oct. 9 (UPI) \u2014 Norway will increase its 2020 defense budget by $218 million, the government announced, but it does not include participation in", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/06/BB-logo-highres.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
