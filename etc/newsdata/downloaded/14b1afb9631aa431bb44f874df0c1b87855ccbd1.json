Dermatologist Marnie Nussbaum concurs that retinols are the \u201cgold standard\u201d and \u201cone of the hardest working products \u2014 the MVP \u2014 in your beauty arsenal\u201d for treating aging skin. That\u2019s because retinols can help increase cellular turnover and encourage the formation of new skin, as well as the production of collagen and elastin, all of which help to reduce fine lines and wrinkles, according to Nussbaum. They also help fade discoloration, improve the appearance of pores, and repair UV damage.\n\nDermatologist Carlos A. Charles, the founder of New York City\u2013based Derma di Colore, told us he typically suggests that patients use retinols\u2019 prescription-strength cousin, retinoids, to treat wrinkles, but says that \u201cin the over-the-counter world, RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Night Cream can be used for those who prefer a milder retinol formulation.\u201d Rabach agrees, adding that the RoC is gentle enough to use on more sensitive, wrinkly skin around the eyes, too. When using a retinol, correct application is key to avoid irritating skin (which may still occur if you\u2019re just starting out). According to Gonzales, start slow and apply pea-size, just two to three times a week, and work up from there. Nussbaum adds that it\u2019s best to only use this (or any anti-aging cream with retinol) at night, since your skin has a better chance to repair itself while you sleep \u2014 and because retinol makes skin more sun-sensitive (so she additionally advises to wear a broad-spectrum sunscreen daily if you\u2019re using retinol creams nightly).", "description": "Dermatologists recommend the best wrinkle creams, including RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Anti-Aging Night Cream, Neutrogena Anti-Wrinkle Deep Wrinkle Daily Moisturizer With Retinol SPF 20, Restorsea Revitalizing Eye Cream, and more.", "authors": ["Dominique Pariso"], "top_image": "https://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/strategist/2019/08/22/wrinkle-creams/22-wrinkle-creams-lede.w1200.h630.jpg"}
