If science had enabled humans to harness the power of nuclear fission and fusion, he decided, it could also help forestall future destruction.\n\nAD\n\nWorking with many others in his field, he helped develop methods to detect \u2014 and hopefully deter \u2014 nuclear explosions around the world, resulting in verification systems that proved crucial to agreements such as the Threshold Test Ban Treaty, signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1974.\n\nAD\n\nNotable deaths in 2019: Ric Ocasek, Valerie Harper, Ross Perot, Toni Morrison, and others we have lost this year share Share Email this link Share on Pinterest Share on LinkedIn View Photos View Photos Next Image Ginger Baker, the prodigiously talented and volcanically temperamental rock drummer who helped form Cream, rock-and-roll\u2019s first supergroup, and inspired awe and imitation in a generation of drummers, died Oct. 6 at 80. Read the obituary (Mj Kim/AP)\n\nThrough his work in the 1970s and \u201980s at the Defense Department and the Federal Communications Commission, Dr. Lukasik also became a Zeligesque figure in the development of digital technologies. As the director of the Advanced Research Projects Agency, now known as DARPA, he backed the growth of ARPANET, an influential precursor to the Internet. And as chief scientist at the FCC, he helped commercialize spread-spectrum techniques, which were used for intelligence communications before becoming a cornerstone of WiFi and Bluetooth technologies.\n\nA man of wide-ranging interests, Dr. Lukasik amassed a collection of about 15,000 books on subjects including national security, shipwrecks, archaeology and geology, and participated in a 1988 effort to date the Shroud of Turin, venerated by millions of Christians as the burial cloth of Jesus. (Radiocarbon tests indicated the frayed length of linen was created in the Middle Ages, although Dr. Lukasik cast doubts on those findings.)\n\nAD\n\nHis focus later shifted from nuclear weapons to cybersecurity, a field that existed in part because of the support he secured for ARPANET. The network spawned a communications revolution that played out at first in DARPA\u2019s offices, where Dr. Lukasik encouraged the use of a system now known as email, checking messages about once an hour, often from a 30-pound \u201cportable\u201d computer terminal that he lugged on his travels.\n\nAD\n\nIn that primitive age of digital messaging, emails were generally read only through a teletype machine, which printed long ribbons of text. Dr. Lukasik, who later donated 50 boxes full of paper to the Charles Babbage Institute, was not one to throw things away. He recalled complaining to Lawrence Roberts, who ran DARPA\u2019s Information Processing Techniques Office: \u201cLarry, this email is great, but it\u2019s a mess!\u201d\n\n\u201cIn typical Larry fashion, he came in the next day, and said, \u2018Steve, I wrote some code for you that may help.\u2019 And he showed me how to get a menu of messages, or file them, or delete them,\u201d Mr. Lukasik said in an interview for \u201cWhere Wizards Stay Up Late,\u201d a history of the Internet by Katie Hafner and Matthew Lyon.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cRoberts,\u201d the authors noted, \u201chad just written the first mail manager software.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nLong after he left DARPA, Dr. Lukasik developed a reputation as a master of \u201cred teaming,\u201d an apocalyptic role-playing exercise in which he imagined potential national security threats from the perspective of U.S. adversaries. Friends said he anticipated the 9/11 terrorist attacks as well as Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\u201cSteve would sometimes refer to his efforts as atoning for his sins, for having authorized and funded the development of an infrastructure that became a kind of threat to the country,\u201d said Dr. Lukasik\u2019s longtime colleague Anthony Rutkowski, referring to the conceptual model at the heart of ARPANET and the Internet.\n\nAD\n\nIn a phone interview, Rutkowski recalled flying home from Frankfurt to the United States on Sept. 11, 2001, while reading a report by Dr. Lukasik on the potential use of airplanes, explosives and other weapons by terrorist groups that might destroy urban infrastructure and coordinate their attacks over the Internet. \u201cIt was the most surreal thing in my life,\u201d he said.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to Rutkowski, Dr. Lukasik later completed a report for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency on the potential for a state actor to \u201cmarshal resources surreptitiously using social networks,\u201d then disrupt elections and other sociopolitical institutions.\n\nRutkowski was unfamiliar with the report when the two friends met last year and discussed Russia\u2019s 2016 election interference. \u201cBet you never envisioned that happening,\u201d Rutkowski recalled telling Dr. Lukasik. \u201cHe said, \u2018Just give me a couple of moments.\u2019 And he went to his office, came back with this report and said, \u2018Here it is, in considerable detail.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAD\n\nStephen Joseph Lukasik was born on Staten Island on March 19, 1931. His father was an accountant, his mother a bank employee turned homemaker.\n\nA collection of old scientific books at his grandparents\u2019 home, along with stacks of science-fiction magazines, helped spark a childhood interest in the fundamental workings of the world. Steve set up a chemistry lab in his basement and entered Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., at 16.\n\nAD\n\nDr. Lukasik received a bachelor\u2019s degree in physics from the school in 1951 and a doctorate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1956. He taught at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J., where he led the fluid physics division and drew the attention of DARPA, partly through a research project he managed for the Department of the Army.\n\nAD\n\nDARPA hired him in 1966 to oversee research on the detection of nuclear explosions, and in 1971 he was named the agency\u2019s director. Dr. Lukasik was credited with broadening its scope, backing research on artificial intelligence, unmanned aerial vehicles, the use of computers to hear and understand speech, and the potential for humans to influence the Earth\u2019s climate.\n\nMost anything was up for study, he said, with one caveat: If \u201cyou\u2019re going to do something that looks like it\u2019s 40,000 miles away from defense, please leave our name off of it.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nBy 1975 he had left the agency, serving as chief scientist at Rand before holding the same title at the FCC from 1979 to 1982. He also worked at companies including Xerox, Northrop, TRW and SAIC.\n\nAD\n\nHis marriage to Marilyn Trappiel ended in divorce, and in 1983 he married Virginia Dogan Armstrong, an FCC policy analyst. In addition to his wife, of Falls Church, survivors include four children from his first marriage, Carol Ward of Boonsboro, Md., Elizabeth O\u2019Masta of New Market, Md., Gregory Lukasik of Hagerstown, Md., and Jeffrey Lukasik of Manassas, Va.; two stepchildren, Elizabeth Armstrong Parker of Falls Church and Alan Armstrong of Atlanta; 11 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.\n\nDr. Lukasik was still called upon to consult on national security issues in recent years. And while much of his work entailed red-teaming, he never abandoned science: At 81, he was awarded a patent for an invention involving a chemical warfare sensor made with carbon nanotubes.\n\nRead more Washington Post obituaries\n\nAD", "description": "He played a part in the development of artificial intelligence, email, the Internet, WiFi and Bluetooth.", "authors": ["Harrison Smith", "Obituary Writer"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/SC5uQyNdRjnk99BVPUA2uHSM7dc=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PGYRQFXKDQI6TIZJON4PX6Q3MM.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
