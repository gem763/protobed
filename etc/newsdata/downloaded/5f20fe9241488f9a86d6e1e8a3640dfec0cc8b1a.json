We try it in under 24 hours\n\nThe world\u2019s her Oyster (card): can you pack Taylor Swift\u2019s capital tour into a day?\n\n\u201cI saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent,\u201d trills Taylor Swift on London Boy, taken from her new album, Lover. \u201cSo I guess all the rumours are true / You know I love a London boy / Boy I fancy you.\u201d The rest of the lyrics take the pop star on a rose-tinted, whistlestop, Oyster-capped tour of the Big Smoke. So, with this song in my ears, and my dimples and accent, can I complete her jam-packed itinerary? Off I go on a tour of Taylor\u2019s London, lyric by lyric, to find out.\n\n13:15 \u2018We can go driving in, on my scooter\u2019\n\nI haven\u2019t got a scooter and my bike\u2019s got a flat, so I hop on the bus. What did Margaret Thatcher say about people and public transport?\n\nStreatham (home) to Brixton; bus; 9 stops; 1.6 miles\n\n13:53 \u2018I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon\u2019\n\nCamden Market is full of slightly scary men trying to sell you CDs, things with hemp leaves on and suspiciously cheap headphones. They don\u2019t do Taylor Swift T-shirts. They don\u2019t even sell \u201cMy Friend Went To London And All I Got Was This Lousy T-Shirt\u201d T-shirts. Rubbish.\n\nBrixton to Camden Town; tube; 10 stops; 6.1 miles\n\n14:28 \u2018Took me back to Highgate / Met all of his best mates\u2019\n\nHighgate tube has an extraordinarily long escalator. But what\u2019s there to do? It\u2019s just some trees and a car park. Boring.\n\nCamden Town to Highgate; tube; 4 stops; 3 miles\n\n14:56 \u2018And now I love high tea / Stories from uni / And the West End\u2019\n\nThere\u2019s a Mexican, Italian, Chinese, TGI Friday, Burger King, McDonald\u2019s, Pizza Hut, Bubba Gump Shrimp Co and a Wagamama, but no high tea today. The Ritz won\u2019t let me in for looking too scruffy. Fortnum & Mason costs a whopping \u00a360, so I scoff tea and scones for \u00a35.75 at John Lewis instead. Yum.\n\nHighgate to Oxford Circus; tube; 7 stops; 4.8 miles\n\n15:58 \u2018You can find me in the pub / We are watching rugby with his school friends\u2019\n\nLeicester Square\u2019s Carlsberg Sports Bar is showing Leighton Town v Thame United and some baseball, but no rugby. I\u2019ll have to imagine Taylor and her pals ordering \u00a35.95 pints of Peroni while watching Wales beat England 13-6.\n\nOxford Street to Leicester Square; walk; 0.8 miles\n\n16:32 \u2018Show me a grey sky / A rainy cab ride\u2019\n\nNo grey skies today. Disappointing.\n\nLeicester Square to Oxford Circus; black cab; \u00a36; 0.7 miles\n\n17:29 \u2018I enjoy nights in Brixton / Shoreditch in the afternoon\u2019\n\nShoreditch via Brixton? Should have listened to Journey Planner. At least I get to look out of an Overground train window.\n\nOxford Circus to Shoreditch via Brixton; tube/train; 21 stops; 9.3 miles\n\n18:03 \u2018... Took me back to Highgate\u2019\n\nHang on. We\u2019ve just been here. Next!\n\nShoreditch to Highgate; walk/tube; 8 stops; 5.1 miles\n\n18:52 \u2018So please show me Hackney\u2019\n\nDone!\n\nHighgate to Hackney Central; bus/walk/train; 19 stops; 5 miles\n\n19:41 \u2018Doesn\u2019t have to be Louis V up on Bond Street\u2019\n\n\u00a35,000 for a handbag? No thanks. It\u2019s also NEW Bond Street. Get your directions right, Swift.\n\nHackney Central to New Bond Street; train/bus/walk; 7 stops; 3.1 miles\n\n20:52 \u2018Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath\u2019\n\nDoesn\u2019t Liam Gallagher live around here?\n\nNew Bond Street to Hampstead Heath; bus; 23 stops; 3.5 miles\n\n21:40 \u2018I enjoy walking Soho / Drinking in the afternoon\u2019\n\nA quick pint in The Ship in honour of Born Slippy by Underworld. Lager, lager \u2026\n\nHampstead Heath to Wardour Street; bus/walk; 24 stops; 3.4 miles\n\n22:25 \u2018... Took me back to Highgate\u2019 (again)\n\nNot the giant escalator again!\n\nWardour Street to Highgate; walk/tube; 9 stops; 4.5 miles\n\n22:55 \u2018Show me Hackney\u2019 (again)\n\nSamey.\n\nHighgate to Hackney Central; bus/walk/train; 19 stops; 4.9 miles\n\n23:15 \u2018... up on Bond Street\u2019 (again)\n\nStill overpriced; thankfully closed now.\n\nHackney Central to New Bond Street; train/bus/walk; 7 stops, 3.1 miles\n\n23:55 \u2018... on the Heath\u2019 (again)\n\nIt\u2019s dark on the Heath. Thanks, Taylor!\n\nNew Bond Street to Hampstead Heath; bus; 23 stops; 3.5 miles\n\n00:55 End of song\n\nOne black cab, one Uber, eight buses, five trains, six tubes, 62.9 miles and 169 stops and I\u2019m home, just in time to read that Taylor has said that she never meant for us to do it in a day. \u201cOh no, you\u2019d never make it. You\u2019d make it in three years!\u2019\u201d she says. Proved you wrong there, Ms Swift ... but maybe there are no real winners.\n\nHampstead Heath to Streatham; Uber; \u00a332; 9.8 miles", "description": "The singer claims it would take three years to complete the itinerary in her new song London Boy.
