However, at 38, I had to face the fact that it might not happen. I ruled out IVF as it was costly and, at the time, not available on the NHS to single women.\n\nAfter six months of analysing and agonising, I made up my mind: I wanted to adopt.\n\nOver the following three years, that dream has been crushed by an extraordinary catalogue of incompetence, small-mindedness and prejudice that I have encountered from social workers.\n\nOne failed to turn up to a key appointment three times running. When I called to ask about the missed appointment, she would insist it was my mistake.\n\nI happily provided bank statements, mortgage statements, pension records and copies of my passport, birth and exam certificates.\n\nClaudia Connell, 53, (pictured) reflected on a Femail piece written eleven years ago, about her desire to have children\n\nI wasn\u2019t so happy when, time and time again, these were mislaid from my file.\n\nShe even lost my medical report a staggering eight times. Even when I sent it recorded delivery, the adoption department would deny having seen it. Eventually, in sheer frustration, I drove to the offices and hand-delivered it.\n\nMy social worker started to make chippy comments about my lifestyle, saying such things as: \u2018How the other half live, eh?\u2019 when I told her I was going to New York for the weekend to mark a friend\u2019s 40th birthday.\n\nShe began to say that she thought I was an over-achiever who might put unrealistic pressures on a child.\n\nTwo days before I was finally due to go before the adoption panel, a social worker contacted me to say it would have to be delayed because they had forgotten to do any criminal record checks on my family.\n\nTwo months later, with nothing resolved, I phoned my social worker and said I no longer wished to proceed.\n\nI was devastated \u2014 but, after months of incompetence and social prejudice, I had no confidence in the system.\n\nWhat I did next\n\nEleven years have passed and I still feel angry when I think of my attempts to adopt. I\u2019d agonised over the decision and felt ready and committed when I was approved by my local authority.\n\nAs someone who wasn\u2019t looking to adopt a baby or a toddler, I was a godsend \u2014 the overwhelming majority of adopters want children under two years old.\n\nI remember how upset I was when a social worker told me that children over eight are rarely wanted and, therefore, languish in the care system.\n\nClaudia (pictured age 38) spent around \u00a330,000 on IVF following her original story, but no longer recognises the person who was obsessed with having a child\n\nHad my local authority been more competent, then, today, aged 53, I could be the mother of a teenager. Maybe that child, thanks to the love and support it wouldn\u2019t otherwise have had, would have flourished and be on the way to university. I\u2019ll never know.\n\nIn the original story, I stated that the idea of trying IVF as a single woman didn\u2019t appeal, and yet that\u2019s exactly what I went on to do. Between 2007 and 2011, I underwent three rounds of IVF, all with donor sperm and two with donor eggs. The first two cycles failed, the third worked briefly before dissolving in a \u2018chemical pregnancy\u2019 (a very early miscarriage).\n\nI had the treatment overseas, which cost me around \u00a330,000 when you factor in the cost of travel and the drugs required.\n\nI haven\u2019t just made peace with it \u2014 I\u2019m glad I\u2019m childless\n\nThe whole episode played havoc with my physical and mental health. The artificial hormones made me pile on weight and plunged my body into early menopause.\n\nDuring the brief week when I was pregnant, I convinced myself I didn\u2019t want a baby after all and would have to abort it. But I lost it anyway.\n\nNow in my 50s, I don\u2019t recognise that deranged, obsessed person. It\u2019s not just that I\u2019ve made peace with being childless: I\u2019m glad I am childless.\n\nIn recent years, I\u2019ve undertaken three U.S. road trips and I\u2019ve bought a big house in Brighton that I\u2019m renovating, none of which would have been possible with young children.\n\nI understand the adoption process has been overhauled since my experience \u2014 it could hardly get any worse.\n\nA friend recently said I had the room to foster children in my new house if I wanted to. I informed her, politely, that my spare bedroom was earmarked as a sophisticated dressing room thank you very much \u2014 not a child\u2019s bedroom.", "description": "Claudia Connell was 38-years-old when she shared her desire to have children with Femail.
