Russian exports to Africa doubled in the last three years and have risen from one percent of total exports five years ago to four percent now.\n\nGrains account for a significant amount of exports, as do weapons, with Africa representing 15 percent of total arms sales for the world's second-largest exporter.\n\nRussian firms are also involved in oil operations in Ghana and Nigeria, diamonds in Angola and nickel elsewhere.\n\nRussia's traditional industries are giving it a competitive advantage in Africa, said Charles Robertson, chief economist at Renaissance Capital.\n\nRussian grain exports to Africa represent a significant amount of overall trade and are especially important for Egypt\n\n\"Chinese skills in arms and oil and gas are not as good as Russian skills,\" he said.\n\nNorth Africa dominates, accounting for about 80 percent of Russia's trade with the continent.\n\nPutin took modern Russia's first major steps in Africa in 2006, when he announced a deal in Algiers to write off Algeria's Soviet-era debt in exchange for a huge arms contract.\n\nAlgeria now represents 80 percent of Russian arms sales to Africa.\n\nPutin did it again in 2008 in Libya, exchanging debt for rail contracts and oil prospects, but the country's descent into war in 2011 left the projects stalled.\n\nRussia's experience in neighbouring Egypt has been much more positive, with Putin and President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi restoring a Soviet-era strategic partnership after Sisi came to power in 2013.\n\nCairo and Moscow have agreed a slew of deals for Russia to sell arms and build nuclear power plants, and Egypt -- the world's biggest grain importer -- is now mainly fed by Russian supplies.\n\nAfrican Union chairman Sisi will co-chair next week's summit.\n\n- 'Growing pie' -\n\nArms deals have been especially useful as Russia expands its interests into sub-Saharan Africa, with agreements reached over the last few years that included the Central African Republic, Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea.\n\nRussia has signed arms agreements in the last few years with the Central African Republic, Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea\n\nThe deals, Kalika said, offer a form of \"security in exchange for economic advantages\" and are especially welcome in countries where there is a \"weariness\" with China's role as a lender and investor.\n\nBut so far, experts say, Moscow appears to lack an overall strategy for doing business across Africa.\n\nRussian business instead seem to be seizing opportunities ad hoc, in contrast to the Turkish approach.\n\nAnkara has launched a major charm offensive in Africa, sending diplomatic and business delegations throughout the continent.\n\nEgypt is one of a few African countries that can be reached directly from Moscow\n\nThere are direct flights from Turkey to more than 50 African destinations.\n\nBy contrast, from Moscow it is possible to fly direct only to a handful of countries such as Egypt and Ethiopia.\n\nBut Robertson said it is not too late for Russia to take a bite out of the \"growing pie\" that African economies represent.\n\n\"Is there still a market? Yes, there is, because Africa's going to keep on growing and will be the fastest-growing part of the world by 2030,\" he forecast.", "description": "From diamonds and arms to nuclear power and oil, Russia has major business ambitions in Africa, even if it is coming late to the party.Western countries like...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/18/02/wire-19866252-1571362982-363_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
