It is right that complaints are properly investigated.\n\n'I am expecting it to take some time for the disciplinary process to run its course whereby I am hoping to clear my name and return to campaigning.\n\n'In the meantime, with the strong likelihood of an imminent general election, it is essential that Cities of London and Westminster Labour have a parliamentary candidate in place as soon as possible.\n\n'It is therefore with deep regret but for the good of the local and national party that I have formally withdrawn my candidacy.\n\nIt means Saxy (pictured with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn) is no longer a candidate for the key marginal seat of The Cities of London and Westminster, despite reportedly wanting to appeal and represent Labour at the next election\n\n'I want to thank everyone who has supported me over the last two years to build a campaign capable of electing a Labour MP in the heart of London.\n\nHe added: 'I encourage everyone to get behind a new candidate and help win for the vital transformation the constituency and country need.'\n\nThe party is now expected to open applications for the seat in a bid to oust Conservative incumbent Mark Field and fend off former Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who is now a Liberal Democrat.\n\nA Labour Party spokesman said: 'The Labour Party takes all complaints extremely seriously, which are investigated and any appropriate disciplinary action taken in line with the Party\u2019s rules and procedures. We can\u2019t comment on individual cases.'\n\nIt is not the first time Saxby has face accusations of improper behaviour.\n\nIn March the then 48-year-old apologised to his wife of 20 years after she accused him of repeated affairs \u2013 including one with a church organist.\n\nMomentum supporter Saxby said at the time he was taking a break from campaigning and was on leave from his duties at Saint Barnabas in Walthamstow, east London, while church officials investigated the claims.\n\nHis wife Christine told friends their marriage was struggling to survive after she discovered he not only had a brief affair in October, but she suspected he had been in a secret four-year relationship with an international pianist, who was a member of their congregation and who she counted a friend.\n\nSaxby (pictured with trans model Talulah-Eve) released a statement yesterday which said: 'I have been suspended from the Labour Party over a complaint I strongly refute'\n\nMrs Saxby told friends of her 'great pain and sadness' at finding out about his infidelity.\n\nThe suspected 'other woman' was a trained pianist and conductor who came to London to study for a Masters at the Royal College of Music.\n\n\n\nSaxby won a hotly-contested selection to become Labour's parliamentary candidate in Cities of London and Westminster in February last year after getting support from union Unite and the endorsement of shadow chancellor John McDonnell, who described him as a 'good socialist comrade'.\n\nThe central London seat, which includes the Houses of Parliament, was put on Labour's target list for the next election, after Foreign Office minister Mark Field, who has been the Tory MP since 2001, saw his majority slashed from 9,671 to 3,148 in 2017.\n\nBut critics questioned Saxby's suitability after a YouTube clip emerged showing him speaking alongside firebrand ex-MP George Galloway at a mosque in East London.\n\nIn the 2015 film, Saxby accused the Government of 'extremism' by bombing Syria, and claiming it was 'stigmatising Muslim children' with its anti-radicalisation Prevent strategy.\n\nLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn last year appeared at a campaign rally alongside Saxby and posed with him holding a placard that said: 'Steven's Team'.\n\nSaxby had been aiming for political office for years \u2013 telling a reporter in 2015 that he aimed to become the first churchman since 1801 to remain a vicar after being elected to Parliament.\n\nThere has traditionally been nervousness about clergymen exerting pressure on congregations to support a particular political party.\n\nTo that end Saxby sought to stand in a constituency away from his parish.\n\nA Labour Party source told MailOnline: 'Suspended individuals cannot be Party candidates so Steven Saxby was already not Labour's candidate.'", "description": "Steven Saxby (pictured) was suspended from Labour last week as the party looks into the complaint.
