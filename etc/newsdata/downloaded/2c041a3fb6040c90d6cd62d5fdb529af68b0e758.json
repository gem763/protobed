Brent trading volumes were double the average, while WTI were about 30% higher for the usually quiet Asian trading day, he said.\n\nProfit taking after the strong gains overnight had run into news of the U.S.-China trade talks, he said.\n\nIn Beijing, China\u2019s commerce ministry said the talks would be held and \u201cboth sides agreed that they should work together and take practical actions to create good conditions for consultations.\u201d\n\nStill evidence has been mounting that economies worldwide are being hit by the trade war, prompting downgrades of oil demand growth expectations.\n\n\u201cThe overall picture still hasn\u2019t changed. We haven\u2019t made any steps to a real agreement,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\nUnderlining concerns about growth, BP Plc\u2019s (BP.L) Chief Financial Officer Brian Gilvary told Reuters on Wednesday that global oil demand is expected to grow by less than 1 million barrels per day in 2019 as consumption slows.\n\nCrude inventories in the United States rose by 401,000 barrels in the week ended Aug. 30 to 429.1 million, compared with analysts\u2019 expectations for a decrease of 2.5 million barrels.\n\nCrude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub fell by 238,000 barrels, while refinery crude runs fell by 306,000 barrels per day, API said.", "description": "Oil prices eased on Thursday after a report showed U.S. crude inventories rose against expectations, even as Washington and Beijing confirmed they would hold ministerial level talks to try resolve a prolonged trade war.", "authors": ["Aaron Sheldrick", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190905&t=2&i=1426350109&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF84027", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
