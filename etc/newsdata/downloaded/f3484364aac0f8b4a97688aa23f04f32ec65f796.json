Trumps team up on Biden at vitriolic Minneapolis rally Read more\n\nThe US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit said lawmakers should get the documents they have subpoenaed from Mazars USA, which has provided accounting services to Donald Trump.\n\nThe House oversight committee subpoenaed records from Mazars in April. The records at issue include documents from 2011 to 2018 the House wants for investigation of the president\u2019s reporting of his finances, potential conflicts of interest and whether he may have engaged in illegal conduct before and during his time in office.\n\nThe list of documents makes no mention of Trump\u2019s tax returns, which are the subject of separate legal disputes.\n\nTrump could appeal to the supreme court. Jay Sekulow, an attorney for the president, reportedly said on Friday his legal team was \u201cevaluating the opinion\u201d and reviewing \u201call options including appeals\u201d.\n\nNeomi Rao, who was confirmed to the appeals court in March, to fill a seat vacated by the supreme court pick Brett Kavanaugh, dissented from the ruling. The other judges are Patricia Millett, appointed by Barack Obama, and David Tatel, appointed by Bill Clinton.\n\nIn the majority ruling, Tatel wrote: \u201cContrary to the president\u2019s arguments, the committee possesses authority under both the House rules and the constitution to issue the subpoena, and Mazars must comply.\u201d\n\nIn dissent, Rao wrote that the committee should have asked for the records under the House\u2019s impeachment power, not its legislative authority.\n\n\u201cThe constitution and our historical practice draw a consistent line between the legislative and judicial powers of Congress,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe majority crosses this boundary for the first time by upholding this subpoena investigating the illegal conduct of the president under the legislative power.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Wydra, a supreme court litigator and president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a progressive Washington thinktank, called Rao\u2019s dissent \u201cextraordinary\u201d.\n\nWriting on Twitter, Wydra added: \u201cIt ignores that Congress has very broad authority to investigate \u2013 far beyond the power of impeachment \u2013 and seems to suggest that courts have some say over the scope of impeachable offenses (they don\u2019t).\u201d\n\nOn running for the White House, Trump broke with precedent, if not law, in not releasing any information about his tax affairs.\n\nThe billionaire regularly claimed not to be able to release his returns due to being under audit, which in fact would not preclude their release. He promised to release such information eventually but has not done so in nearly three years in office.\n\nSlices of such information have since been made public by the media. Efforts to obtain Trump tax returns through the courts continue in various jurisdictions.\n\nThe House ways and means committee has sued the Trump administration over access to the president\u2019s tax returns. In New York, Trump sued to prevent Deutsche Bank and Capital One from complying with House subpoenas for banking and financial records. A judge ruled against him and Trump appealed.\n\nJudge rejects Trump's 'repugnant' immunity claim in tax-return ruling Read more\n\nTrump is also in court trying to stop the Manhattan district attorney from obtaining his tax returns. A judge in that case ruled this week the president\u2019s claim to immunity while in office was \u201crepugnant\u201d. Trump immediately appealed. Oral arguments were scheduled for 23 October.\n\nCommenting on Twitter on possible outcomes from Friday\u2019s ruling in the Mazars case, the Republican consultant and never-Trumper Rick Wilson counselled caution.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get all triumphant about Trump having to turn over his tax returns quite yet,\u201d he wrote.\n\nTrump, Wilson said, will \u201cappeal until the last dog dies\u201d and \u201cif he loses at supreme court he will defy the order, because he is lawless and [attorney general William] Barr will back him up.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration has consistently refused to comply with oversight efforts by Democrats in the House, most recently the formal impeachment inquiry launched in response to the president\u2019s attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, a leading political rival.", "description": "Trump appointee Neomi Rao dissents but court decides 2-1 that lawmakers must receive financial records from president\u2019s accounting firm", "authors": ["Martin Pengelly"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6b527856a155d8e7c7ff665e38f8c7fb309540e/0_100_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=a63b86aab6ccf8abb268805269c10d3a", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
