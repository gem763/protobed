He\u2019s fighting for his political life before Monday\u2019s election and it\u2019s Canadians\u2019 seeming embrace of internal divisions \u2013 as much geographic as ideological \u2013 that\u2019s putting Trudeau\u2019s job at risk four years after he waltzed to power with the mantra \u201csunny ways, sunny ways.\u201d\n\nAsked recently what he regretted most, Trudeau suggested that he hadn\u2019t succeeded in forging a common sense of national aspiration. \u201cWe find ourselves more polarized, more divided in this election than in 2015. I wonder how, or if, I could have made sure we were pulling Canadians together.\u201d\n\nCanada, it is commonly observed, has more geography than history. It\u2019s a country marginally bigger than the United States but with just 37 million people spread across six time zones. The economy of Western Canada, dependent on natural resources, has little in common with central Canada, which is now services-based. Then there is the issue of language. French-speaking Quebec is suspicious of \u201cles Anglos\u201d elsewhere, and vice versa.\n\nTrudeau managed to overcome these fissures in 2015, winning seats in Western Canada, where his Liberal Party usually loses, dominating Ontario, winning back support in Quebec and sweeping every seat in Atlantic Canada. His liberalism, at a time of growing populism and nativism, made him a global icon (and won him the endorsement of Barack Obama this week). But it was largely Trudeau\u2019s potential to forge national solutions that caught Canadians\u2019 attention.\n\nCanada\u2019s natural state of division appears to have caught up with him, however. Two examples are most important as Trudeau fights a three-pronged battle against the center-right Conservative Party, the left-wing New Democratic Party and the nominally separatist Bloc Quebecois. (The Liberals or the Conservatives have dominated elections since Canada\u2019s founding. But polls show they now enjoy the support of not even one-third of voters each, with the rest going to the other parties.)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nClimate change: Trudeau imposed a carbon tax. It\u2019s not high enough for Canada to meet its Paris Agreement obligations, but it\u2019s come under attack nevertheless from numerous provincial governments, which view it as just another tax grab by an overspending federal government. Meanwhile, Trudeau also sought to assuage energy-rich Alberta by backing expansion of a key pipeline to the West Coast.\n\nTrudeau was seeking to forge a middle path \u2014 a carbon tax and a pipeline. But he\u2019s likely to lose seats he now holds in Western Canada to the Conservative Party, which opposes the tax. And he\u2019s likely to lose seats too to the New Democrats, the choice of millennial voters who\u2019ve made climate change their priority and aren\u2019t impressed by Trudeau\u2019s \u201cpipeline politics.\u201d\n\nLaicite: The French word, which translates as \u201csecularity,\u201d encapsulates Trudeau\u2019s Quebec dilemma. Quebec\u2019s nationalist provincial government recently banned most public servants \u2013 teachers, police officers, bureaucrats \u2013 from wearing religious symbols on the job, just as is done in France. The law is popular among French-speaking Quebecers, who view it as protecting secular values and the \u201cneutrality\u201d of the state.\n\nBut to English Canadians, the law is seen as violating freedoms guaranteed in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms \u2013 Canada\u2019s equivalent to the U.S. Bill of Rights \u2013 and is deemed particularly intolerant of religious minorities.\n\nThe Bloc Quebecois, by rallying to the side of the Quebec government, has leapt in the polls and is challenging the Liberal Party for Quebec dominance. Weeks ago, the Bloc was deemed all but dead. The obituary was premature.\n\nTrudeau has accomplished much in four years. He made the tax system fairer by increasing taxes on the wealthy and reducing them on the poor and middle-class, especially families with children. He legalized assisted suicide and cannabis use. He renegotiated NAFTA in the face of an erratic U.S. president who denigrated Canada in ways the United States hasn\u2019t done before.\n\nTrudeau also has had his failures: The budget deficit is higher than promised, his pledge to reform the electoral system went nowhere and he\u2019s been hurt by scandal. Backroom machinations to protect SNC-Lavalin, one of Canada\u2019s few global corporations, proved to many Canadians that his promise to do politics differently was empty. The recent emergence of photos of Trudeau in blackface early in his professional life damaged the personal reputation of someone viewed as one of the world\u2019s few \u201cwoke\u201d leaders.\n\nIn 2015, Trudeau appeared destined for nothing less than two full mandates in power. Now, he\u2019s tied with the Conservatives in the polls and may be on the verge of a shocking reversal of fortune.\n\nThe center of the road can be a dangerous place.\n\nDrew Fagan is a professor at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy at the University of Toronto.", "description": "Canada\u2019s natural state of division appears to have caught up with Trudeau.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trudeaujustin_062019as_lead.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
