Biden and others in the Obama administration have said they urged for Shokin\u2019s dismissal because he was accused of neglecting corruption in his office and for failing to bring corruption cases.\n\nLutsenko also told The Washington Post on Thursday that the former U.S. vice president\u2019s son did not break any Ukrainian laws while serving on Burisma\u2019s board, in the former prosecutor general\u2019s first interview since the declassification of a whistleblower complaint that alleges Trump pressured newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to find dirt on the Bidens.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS Yuriy Lutsenko speaks at a session of the Ukrainian parliament in Kiev, Ukraine, in 2016.\n\nThe complaint by an anonymous U.S. intelligence official is at the center of a formal House impeachment inquiry into the president and alleges Trump used \u201cthe power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. elections.\u201d\n\nThe complaint includes a July 25 call in which Trump pressured Zelensky to \u201cdo us a favor, though\u201d and work with Giuliani and Attorney General William Barr to find damaging information on his potential political rival. The call, which the White House released a summary of last week, occurred just days after Trump suspended nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine.\n\nLutsenko\u2019s statements to the LA Times should be taken with caution considering the whistleblower\u2019s complaint says he was a source for Giuliani and Trump on many unsubstantiated claims about Ukrainian corruption investigations, including the ones related to the Bidens. The New York Times also reported Saturday that Lutsenko at one point took \u201cprocedural steps\u201d to further investigations involving Burisma founder Mykola Zlochevsky linked to Hunter Biden, resulting in Giuliani and Trump promoting stories about the Bidens to conservative journalists in the U.S.\n\nLutsenko was also involved in the U.S. State Department removing U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch in May, which happened as Giuliani increased pressure on the new Zelensky administration to get involved in U.S. politics. Lutsenko alleged that Yovanovitch interfered with the 2016 U.S. elections by handing him a \u201cdo not prosecute\u201d list and \u201chad blocked Ukrainian prosecutors from traveling to the United States expressly to prevent them from delivering \u2018evidence\u2019 about the 2016 U.S. election,\u201d the complaint stated.\n\nLutsenko admitted in April that he was the one who requested the \u201cdo not prosecute\u201d list. In Trump\u2019s July 25 call with Zelensky, the U.S. president threatened Yovanovitch by saying she\u2019s \u201cbad news\u201d and is \u201cgoing to go through some things.\u201d\n\nHouse investigators have scheduled an Oct. 2 deposition with Yovanovitch as part of the impeachment inquiry. The House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight committees also scheduled depositions with several other State Department officials, such as Ambassador Kurt Volker who resigned as U.S. special envoy for Ukraine a day after the whistleblower complaint was released to the public.\n\nThe committees also issued subpoenas on Friday for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who Giuliani said was aware of his shadow diplomacy with the Ukrainian government.", "description": "Yuriy Lutsenko, who was fired as Ukraine's prosecutor general, told Rudy Giuliani that he saw no wrongdoing by Joe Biden, according to the Los Angeles Ti...", "authors": ["Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9120da2100005b00fdc295.jpeg?cache=7fdqb9s3wn&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-09-29"}
