Consisting of 12 scenes written and staged by seven directors including showrunner Lee Liebeskind, the production conjures incidents that take place in the eponymous hostelry\u2019s Room 109 over the course of a year. The puppet- and mask-infused folk tale episode delivers poignant lyricism, as directed and choreographed by Robert Bowen Smith, with Paz L\u00f3pez as the storyteller. But other installments work in very different modes. Romance, loopy murder, slapstick hot sex, a grief-steeped haunting, professional wrestling and other comic and dramatic happenings, often involving minimal dialogue, make Room 109 a candidate for a \u201cDo Not Disturb\u201d sign the size of a Route 66 billboard.\n\nSeveral of the most satisfying scenes in \u201cCrystal Creek Motel,\u201d are wordless, or near-wordless, and set to mood-propelling indie rock-inflected music. Dan Mori supplies a droll sketch about a stressed-out traveler (the compelling Natalie Cutcher) who dances her way to optimism. In an amusing and ingeniously choreographed comic-erotic yarn by Tonia Sina (a leading figure in the \u201cintimacy direction\u201d field) and Jason Schlafstein (Flying V\u2019s producing artistic director), two near strangers (Cutcher and James Finley) fumble through a breathless hookup that has a fourth-wall-puncturing twist.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nTwo dream ballets surge with poignancy that benefits from Kristin A. Thompson\u2019s evocative lighting. A portrait of a woman reeling from romantic nostalgia (directed and choreographed by Smith and featuring Linda Bard, Momo Nakamura and Quincy Vicks) weaves in stylized, everyday movement. A glimpse of siblings separated by death (directed by Liebeskind, choreographed by Tiffanie Horner, and featuring Finley and Jordan Clark Halsey) deploys balletic partnering.\n\nNot all the segments in \u201cCrystal Creek Motel\u201d are successful. Among other failures, a drug-binge chronicle (by Kelly Colburn, featuring Madeline Key) is boring and overextended. A sentimental New Year\u2019s Eve episode (by Liebeskind, written with Nerissa Hart) is unconvincing. Overall, with a 2\u00bd -hour running time, the show often feels self-indulgently long-winded.\n\nKnitting these checkered scenes, Jos. B. Musumeci Jr.\u2019s pitch-perfect set incorporates some delightful surprises. And the drama is framed by a beautifully crafted tale that features two members of the motel\u2019s cleaning staff. The rapport between the women (Julieta Gozalo and the marvelous Erin Denman) evolves in touching ways, and Denman\u2019s exasperated expressions are superb. Let\u2019s get these two hospitality professionals a gig at a Ritz-Carlton.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nCrystal Creek Motel, by Flying V Theatre.
