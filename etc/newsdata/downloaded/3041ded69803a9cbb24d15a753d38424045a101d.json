How it works: 3 points for a correct score, 1 point for the right result.\n\nWelcome to The Prediction Challenge.\n\nIt's what millions of us do every day - predicting what the score will be in a Premier League match.\n\nWhether it's a thumping 4-0 home win, a sneaky three points on the road or a 0-0 bore draw, let's be honest \u2013 we all think we can tip the outcome of the next game.\n\nWell, now we've challenged Sportsmail's experts to test their prediction power.\n\nEach week, we'll ask one of our star columnists to go head to head with one of our top team of reporters.\n\nThey will offer their prediction for each Premier League match - and explain why they went for that score.\n\nThis week, it's our columnist Martin Keown against reporter Jack Gaughan ... and don't forget to tell us your predictions by leaving a comment below.\n\nSportsmail's columnist Martin Keown (left) takes on our reporter Jack Gaughan this week\n\nAll matches on Sunday at 3pm\n\nARSENAL vs EVERTON\n\nMartin Keown: Arsenal will sign off on a positive note ahead of the Cup final. Everton have made big improvements this season but Arsenal will be too good. Arsenal 2-0 Everton.\n\nJack Gaughan: Surely the Gunners are going to put on a show? You\u2019d hope so after the season they\u2019ve endured and with a slim chance of reaching the Champions League. They need results to go there way. Arsenal 2-1 Everton.\n\nBURNLEY vs WEST HAM\n\nMartin Keown: A very disappointing season for West Ham will end with defeat at Burnley, who will continue their good home form. Burnley 1-0 West Ham.\n\nJack Gaughan: West Ham were on the beach last week against Liverpool and Burnley will want to finish their home campaign with yet another win. Burnley 2-1 West Ham.\n\nCHELSEA vs SUNDERLAND\n\nMartin Keown: Chelsea can create history by winning their 30th Premier League game of the season. With the prospect of a Double on the horizon Chelsea will want to get the job done early. Conte will use his squad wisely ahead of the Cup final. Chelsea 3-0 Sunderland.\n\nJack Gaughan: A big finale, Antonio Conte hopes. Goals to be had against a wretched Sunderland side - this should be exceptionally one-sided. Chelsea 4-0 Sunderland.\n\nChelsea are getting ready to party as they lift the Premier League trophy on Sunday\n\nHULL CITY vs TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR\n\nMartin Keown: Who would bet against Harry Kane scoring another hat-trick? Tottenham have shown they are stronger mentally and Kane chasing a personal milestone has made life easier for them. Hull 0-3 Tottenham.\n\nJack Gaughan: Spurs are still relentless despite sewing up second spot already and showed that against Leicester on Thursday night. Same again here. Hull 0-3 Tottenham.\n\nHarry Kane will be looking to secure the Golden Boot when Spurs finish their season at Hull\n\nLEICESTER CITY vs BOURNEMOUTH\n\nMartin Keown: The 6-1 defeat by Spurs will have been a smack in the face for Craig Shakespeare. Another loss would harm his job prospects and this will really test his relationship with the players. Leicester 2-1 Bournemouth.\n\nJack Gaughan: Craig Shakespeare will be hurt by Thursday and want a reaction, while Bournemouth are hoping to cling on to their top 10 finish. Leicester 1-1 Bournemouth.\n\nLIVERPOOL vs MIDDLESBROUGH\n\nMartin Keown: I cannot see anything other than a Liverpool win. If they can't beat Boro then they don't deserve to be in the Champions League. Liverpool 3-1 Middlesbrough.\n\nJack Gaughan: Could it be nervy? Liverpool fans are hoping not, needing one final win to make sure they\u2019re back in the Champions League. Liverpool 2-0 Middlesbrough.\n\nPhilippe Coutinho and Liverpool are hoping to secure a Champions League spot\n\nMANCHESTER UNITED vs CRYSTAL PALACE\n\nMartin Keown: Palace will have their party hats on and can finally enjoy a Premier League game after playing under such pressure. United won't want to lose heading into the Europa League final... so I can see them equalling their record of 11 draws at home! Man United 1-1 Crystal Palace.\n\nJack Gaughan: A game Jose Mourinho would rather do without. A second string again, a second rate performance again. Man United 1-1 Crystal Palace.\n\nSOUTHAMPTON vs STOKE CITY\n\nMartin Keown: Southampton are without a goal in four games and that run will extend against a Stoke side who don't do a lot away from home. Southampton 0-0 Stoke.\n\nJack Gaughan: Tough to call. Claude Puel looks on the way out whereas Stoke have faltered badly and could finish as low as 16th. Southampton 0-1 Stoke.\n\nSWANSEA CITY vs WEST BROM\n\nMartin Keown: West Brom's season has tailed off. I expect Swansea to win a tight game. Swansea 2-1 West Brom.\n\nJack Gaughan: West Brom have struggled for results recently and Tony Pulis could look to grind out a draw to make sure they stay in the top half. Swansea 0-0 West Brom.\n\nWATFORD 0-3 MANCHESTER CITY\n\nMartin Keown: The wheels have well and truly come off at Watford, losing each of their last five games. A comfortable Manchester City win. Watford 0-3 Manchester City.\n\nJack Gaughan: City only need a draw but they will hunt for goals. Watford are all over the place, with Walter Mazzarri leaving. Watford 1-3 Manchester City.", "description": "Welcome to The Prediction Challenge.
