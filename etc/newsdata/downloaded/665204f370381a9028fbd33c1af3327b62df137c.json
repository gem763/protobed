She knew decades of research had established that children typically don\u2019t fully understand numbers until they are preschoolers, but she wondered what they knew before then. \u201cHow do they know these words are associated with numbers \u2014 or quantities in the world?\u201d she asked.\n\nAD\n\nWhat she and Lisa Feigenson, a cognitive scientist at Johns Hopkins, learned from experiments is revelatory: Babies are able to understand something important about numbers long before they can say them out loud. The researchers discovered that children as young as 14 months old are capable of recognizing that counting is related to quantity \u2014 even if they\u2019re still a few years away from truly understanding what \u201cone, two, three\u201d means.\n\nAD\n\nThe findings are one more piece in the puzzle showing how an infant\u2019s mind develops something fundamentally human: the ability to engage in complex, abstract thinking. And the results are surprising, because earlier research has shown that although young children often can say the numbers from 1 to 10, they don\u2019t truly understand what the numbers mean until they\u2019re about 4 years old.\n\n\u201cA lot of kids can repeat the numbers in sequence,\u201d Feigenson said. But it seems that early on, they are probably reciting, the way younger children can remember phrases such as, \u201cEeny, meeny, miny, moe,\u201d and \u201cMary had a little lamb.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThis work is really groundbreaking,\u201d said Sara Cordes, an associate professor of psychology at Boston College who was an editor for Developmental Science, which just published the findings. \u201cIt suggests that infants are linking the count routine to an understanding of numbers much earlier than we had thought before.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhen Wang proposed testing whether babies know what counting is, Feigenson told her, \u201c\u2018Jenny, you\u2019re crazy, they obviously won\u2019t.\u2019\u201d She tried to talk Wang out of it.\n\nAfter all, most children, if asked to hand over a set number of toys, can\u2019t reliably do that until about age 4. It\u2019s not until then that they really understand that words like \u201cthree\u201d and \u201cfive\u201d represent a precise quantity.\n\nAD\n\nBut Wang had done so much good work in her lab, with her dissertation well underway, Feigenson said, that she eventually agreed to the study. \u201cLive and learn,\u201d Feigenson thought.\n\nThe design of the experiment was simple: They played a hide-and-seek game with babies. Researchers showed 14- and 18-month-old babies four toys and hid them in a box. The babies couldn\u2019t see inside, but they could reach in to pull out toys.\n\nAD\n\nResearchers showed the babies the little dogs or cars, and counted out loud as they dropped them into the box, saying, \u201cLook! One, two, three, four \u2014 four dogs!\u201d\n\nOther times, they didn\u2019t count, but said, \u201cThis, this, this and this \u2014 these dogs!\u201d as they dropped them into the box.\n\nAD\n\nWhen they didn\u2019t use number words, the babies often became distracted after a researcher pulled out a single toy, as though they had no expectation there were more toys in the box.\n\nWhen the researchers did count, the babies expected more toys would come out and would reach into the box to find them. They didn\u2019t know the precise number but could remember the approximate number, reaching for about the right number of toys.\n\nFeigenson said the early results indicated \u201cit clearly worked \u2014 the babies are responding to counting. I thought, \u2018That\u2019s not right.\u2019 We ran four more studies, with different conditions.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThey tried replacing the counting numbers in the script with names, labeling the toys Sophie, Katie, Annie, Mary, before dropping them into the box. And the babies responded as they had without numbers \u2014 which is to say, not reaching for multiple toys. \u201cThat made us think we\u2019re actually finding something about babies\u2019 understanding about counting instead of just a way to improve their memory,\u201d said Wang, now a postdoctoral student who will become an assistant professor at Rutgers University.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cMy intuition was totally wrong,\u201d Feigenson said, not for the first time, even after 16 years as a professor at Hopkins specializing in the development of numeric ability in children. \u201cIt\u2019s great fun that the science continues to surprise me.\u201d\n\nWang said the research doesn\u2019t upend previous findings; scientists don\u2019t think a 1-year-old can understand what \u201cfive\u201d truly is. But it shows babies understand something about counting before they understand the number words, recognizing they are signaling quantity.\n\nAD\n\nIn Feigenson\u2019s Laboratory for Child Development, researchers study the origins of thoughts \u2014 how people learn, how much of humans\u2019 capacity to understand intricate ideas is innate, and how much is gleaned through their environment and social and educational cues. When babies see a block, do they understand the block will still be there after they blink? Do they understand it\u2019s solid? That if you drop it, it will fall?\n\nAD\n\n\u201cOur research would fall flat really fast if babies didn\u2019t enjoy the experiments,\u201d Feigenson said, because the only way to motivate an infant is to make an experience fun.\n\nStill, the work has its challenges, such as subjects falling fast asleep mid-experiment or starting to wail. \u201cThey cry, they\u2019re hungry, they need to take a break \u2014 they drop their pacifier on the ground,\u201d Feigenson said. Every scientist faces tribulations in the lab, she said. \u201cThe baby scientists just have funnier tribulations.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nThe counting study leads to a lot of other questions. Wang wonders how important the social aspects of the counting routine are to learning. Feigenson asked what it is about counting that signals to a baby the words are about quantity, and whether early counting affects later ability to think about math. They have been running studies testing whether babies respond to counting in a foreign language, and plan to test whether babies will respond to irregular counting, such as \u201cone, four, two, three.\u201d\n\nWang, whose first baby is due any moment, is already wondering about her daughter. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can stop thinking\u201d about the science as a new mom, she said. \u201cI\u2019ll be trying to figure out what she is thinking.\u201d\n\nAD", "description": "The findings at Johns Hopkins University are one more piece in the puzzle that shows how an infant\u2019s mind develops something fundamentally human: the ability to engage in complex, abstract thinking.", "authors": ["Susan Svrluga", "Reporter Covering Higher Education For The Grade Point Blog"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/bRW0A3LIT-pJILyFu3z9anec0BI=/1440x0/smart/d1i4t8bqe7zgj6.cloudfront.net/10-23-2019/t_2c3aacd86a204eed9b7c0835b6a6ce7f_name_Screen_Shot_2019_10_23_at_4_24_00_PM.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
