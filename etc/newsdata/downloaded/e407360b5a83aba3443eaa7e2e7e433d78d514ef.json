Political betting markets predict an election by Christmas.\n\nJohnson formally asked the European Union on Saturday night to delay the country\u2019s departure from the bloc for the third time after the British parliament postponed a decision on whether to back his divorce deal.\n\nJohnson was forced to send a letter to the EU to request a delay to Brexit\u2014but did so without including his signature. The request was accompanied by a second letter, signed by Johnson, saying he believes a delay would be a mistake.\n\nThe PM was required by law to ask the EU for an extension to the 31 October deadline after losing a vote in the Commons on October 19\u2014the first Saturday session since the 1982 Falklands War.\n\nThe political turmoil has brought forward the likelihood of a snap U.K. election.\n\nThe poll of investors, conducted by opinion sharing platform Procensus, found that a further 26% believe the Tories would be able to form a majority government with the help of Nigel Farage\u2019s Brexit Party. Not one investor, however, said the left-wing Labour Party would be able to come to power on its own. The rest predicted either a Liberal Democrat or Labour-led coalition.\n\nHelena Morrissey, the City fund manager who is in the running to replace Mark Carney as governor of the Bank of England, said: \u201cThe most important thing at this juncture\u2014and a point on which everyone I speak to agrees\u2014is that we move forward as a country. Personally, I am confident the Tories can lead, with a decent majority.\u201d\n\nSir Martin Sorrell, the advertising veteran, told FN: \u201cI think [the Tories] can win. The cabinet is a good one. The prime minister also has a strong post-Brexit vision.\u201d\n\nEuropean Council President Donald Tusk said on Twitter on Saturday that the extension request had arrived and he would begin consulting with EU leaders, who will respond in the coming days.\n\nIn his letter to Tusk, Johnson wrote: \u201cI regret causing my fellow leaders to devote more time and energy to a question I had hoped we had resolved last week.\u201d\n\nDavid Buik, a City commentator, said of the Procensus poll: \u201cYes, I think the Tories are the only party that could command a majority in the House of Commons, with a leader who is regarded as positive.\n\n\u201cRegardless of political persuasion I think the electorate is of the opinion that the prospect of a Corbyn government is far more daunting than Brexit\u2014deal or no deal\u2014and will vote accordingly.\u201d\n\nIn his letter to Tusk, Johnson said the government will press on with efforts to pass the revised Brexit deal agreed with EU leaders last week into law, and that he is confident of doing so by October 31.", "description": "", "authors": ["Chris Newlands", "Shruti Chopra", "David Ricketts"], "top_image": "https://images.barrons.com/im-102039/social", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
