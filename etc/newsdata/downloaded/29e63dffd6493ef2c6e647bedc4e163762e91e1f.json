After catching the ball, he ran up to the 25-time gymnastics world champion and autographed it for her as a well-deserved souvenir.\n\nTroy Taormina/USA TODAY Sports via Reuters\n\nTroy Taormina/USA TODAY Sports via Reuters\n\nTroy Taormina/USA TODAY Sports via Reuters\n\nThis isn't the first time Biles established herself on the pitcher's mound. In July 2016, she flipped in the air before throwing the first pitch at another Astros home game.\n\nDespite such a great start for the Astros, the team lost Game 2 to the Washington Nationals, 12 to 3, on Wednesday. The team heads into the third game in the series, which will be hosted by the Nationals, this Friday starting at 8:07 p.m. ET on FOX.", "description": "Simone Biles goes viral with her World Series opening pitch, in which she executed an amazing flip.", "authors": ["Abc News"], "top_image": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/simone-biles4-sh-ml-191024_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
