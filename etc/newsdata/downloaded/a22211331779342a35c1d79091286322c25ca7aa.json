They were both exactly the same from the same place. We do this all the time.\n\n\u201cOften, when the phone rings I can look at my husband Derek and say, \u2018That\u2019s Jennifer\u2019.\u201d\n\nJennifer had been told she had an identical twin sister by relatives in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, when she was a teenager and dreamed of meeting her.\n\nShe said: \u201cThe first thing I said to Kath was, \u2018Oh I have missed you\u2019 even though I didn\u2019t know her. I\u2019d been looking for that long.\n\n(Image: We Love TV)\n\n\u201cWe just clicked straight away, as though we\u2019d never been parted.\u201d\n\nThe sisters\u2019 bond became stronger after Jennifer\u2019s husband Howard died of sepsis in April. Distraught Jennifer had loved going on cruises with Howard and his unexpected death meant she cancelled one they had booked.\n\nKathleen stepped in and asked if they could go on one together.\n\nAt first Jennifer said no but changed her mind after daughter Nicole persuaded her and the pair set off on a Mediterranean holiday.\n\nJennifer said: \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d go on \u00adanother cruise. But Nicole said, \u2018It\u2019s what dad would have wanted\u2019. So I called Kathleen back and we booked.\n\n(Image: PAGE ONE)\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s always there to help me with Howard\u2019s death. If we are in Marks and Spencer I can just say to her \u2018I feel a bit tearful\u2019 and she comes round from the side of the table to sit with me.\u201d\n\nThe twins were joined by Howard on their holiday \u2013 in the form of a thimble sized pot of his ashes in Jennifer\u2019s handbag.\n\nShe said: \u201cI took Howard with me! He\u2019s been all over. He\u2019s been to see Bohemian Rhapsody and he comes to Marks & Spencer with us for coffee and cake.\u201d\n\nIn a special episode of Long Lost Family, viewers will see how the twins have integrated into each other\u2019s lives. They are filmed celebrating their 76th birthday with their families around them, before \u00adpacking for their cruise.\n\nTheir favourite place to go is Marks & Spencer for a coffee and a slice of cake.\n\nKathleen said: \u201cWe meet up every Wednesday and we go shopping.\n\n\u201cOur first stop is a coffee in M&S. We look at the clothes when we\u2019ve had a coffee. We love to sit and people watch as well, we make comments on people walking around and we make each other laugh.\n\n\u201cI was trying on a dress in a fitting room and it looked terrible but we were laughing so much the fitting room attendant asked if it was us making the noise.\u201d\n\nJennifer and Kathleen were separated as babies because there was not space for twins in biological mum Eva\u2019s two-up, two-down house. Kathleen, a former secretary, found out she was adopted when she was 21.\n\nShe wasn\u2019t aware of any siblings and didn\u2019t consider searching for any biological family until she was found by a researcher from the TV show.\n\nBut Jennifer was raised by Eva\u2019s neighbour Elsie Paul, meaning she had close contact with her \u201cauntie Eva\u201d her entire life, going on days out and doing her hair for her.\n\nWhen she was 13, a cousin told her that Eva was really her mum and she had an identical twin.\n\nElsie confirmed it but they continued to live as one happy \u00adfamily. Jennifer \u00adalways wondered about her lost sister and often searched for people who looked like her.\n\nShe began proper detective work in October 2009. Her daughter Nicole, 35, posted her story on an adoption website which was spotted by Long Lost Family.\n\nBefore their emotional reunion in March 2010, shown on the programme in April 2011, there were plenty of \u201csliding doors\u201d moments where their paths must have crossed.\n\nJennifer worked for years at Boots where Kathleen would come for her \u00adprescriptions and their kids were in the same drama group.\n\nJennifer reckons people were mistaking her for her sister before their reunion.\n\nShe said: \u201cOnce one of the girls I worked with came in and said, \u2018Oh you\u2019re stuck up, you.\u2019 I said, \u2018What are you talking about?\u2019\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018I shouted you yesterday in Sheffield.\u2019 I said I was at work and she said: \u2018My God there\u2019s someone who looks almost \u00adidentical to you!\u2019\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\n\u201cOf course she didn\u2019t know I had a twin, not many people did, and I thought yep, that\u2019s who I\u2019m looking for.\u201d\n\nIn another bizarre \u00admoment, Kathleen realised she had met her mum once before, when Eva was working as a bus conductor.\n\nKathleen said: \u201cI got on a bus one day with my children and a buggy. The \u00adconductress was talking to us and chatting to my daughter Julie.\n\n\u201cWhen we were getting off she asked to hold my son Richard and she cuddled him and loved him.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a bit odd at the time but when Jennifer told me Eva was a conductress and showed me a picture it clicked and I thought, \u2018That was her\u2019.\u201d\n\nThe twins make up for lost time by attending big family events and looking to the future.\n\nKathleen has two children, Richard and Julie, with her husband of 52 years, Derek, plus four grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.\n\nJennifer has her daughter Nicole, plus two stepdaughters, one of whom sadly passed away.\n\nShe has two grandsons and three step-grandchildren.\n\nKathleen said: \u201cI said to Jenny when I\u2019d met her that she should have been my bridesmaid and \u00adgodmother to my children, but she said we\u2019ve got to look forward and not back.\u201d\n\nAnd in the future, the twins see plenty of laughs, visits to family \u2013 and a trip to Center Parcs.\n\nKathleen added: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep laughing, it keeps you going.\n\n\u201cAs long as you\u2019ve got things to keep looking forward to.\u201d\n\n\u25a0Long Lost Family Twins: What Happened Next, ITV, October 28, 9pm", "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Kathleen and Jennifer featured on the first ever episode of the ITV programme in 2011", "authors": ["Helen Whitehouse", "Image", "Theshipsphotographer.Com", "Itv Rex Shutterstock", "We Love Tv", "Page One"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20653952.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_CP2_5422.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-19"}
