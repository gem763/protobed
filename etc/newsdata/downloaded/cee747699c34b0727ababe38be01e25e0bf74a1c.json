Decision on his participation for Monday\u2019s match at Sheffield United will be made in the forthcoming days.\"\n\n(Image: Arsenal FC via Getty Images)\n\nMeanwhile, Lacazette reckons Matteo Guendouzi can become world class at Arsenal because he is fiercely ambitious.\n\nThe 20-year-old midfielder has enjoyed a meteoric rise to the top in north London following his move from Ligue 2 obscurity in the summer of 2018.\n\nGuendouzi has made nine appearances for Arsenal in all competitions this season and Lacazette is confident he can push on and become one of the game's best midfielders.\n\n\"He is like the younger brother [in the friendship group with Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang],\" said Lacazette. We all really have a good relationship, we like to work and to laugh together so it's really good.\n\n(Image: Action Images via Reuters)\n\n\"I'm really happy for Matteo, he played really well, he helped the team when we needed him, he is really improving each season so we are all really happy with his performances this month.\n\n\"We can see that every top midfielder in the world is like this [demanding the ball and being brave in possession]. They all want to take the ball.\n\n(Image: PA)\n\n\"Matteo has a good ambition, he wants to be one of the best players in his position so every day he is trying to be the best and this month he showed that he can be.\"", "description": "The Gunners travel to Bramall Lane for Monday night's clash in front of Sky TV cameras", "authors": ["Jacob Murtagh", "Image", "Arsenal Fc Via Getty Images", "Action Images Via Reuters", "Pa"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article18991089.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Arsenal-Training-Session.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-17"}
