But this one brings more profits to Fidelity Investments. Not surprisingly, it\u2019s the version that\u2019s offered in most Fidelity-run retirement plans.\n\nThe other version is the right choice for investors. But it\u2019s less profitable for Fidelity, sort of an \u201cunder-the-counter\u201d product that\u2019s rarely offered to retirement plan participants.\n\nFidelity is one of the few fund companies that offer target-date funds based on active management as well as similar funds with portfolios made up of index funds.\n\nI\u2019m a big fan of indexing (as opposed to active management), and I decided this would make an interesting comparison.\n\nHere are two mutual funds managed by the same company, with identical goals. The only apparent difference is active vs. passive management.\n\nI asked myself: How would this difference affect the funds\u2019 expenses and performance?\n\nFor comparison, I chose two funds with target retirement dates of 2055. The bulk of these funds\u2019 portfolios are invested in equities.\n\nThe Fidelity Freedom 2055 Fund FNSDX, +0.15% is based on active management. The Fidelity Freedom Index 2055 Fund FDEWX, +0.13% uses indexing.\n\nThe difference between their names\u2026just one word\u2026is a detail likely to be overlooked by retirement plan participants.\n\nThe difference is costing lots of people lots of money.\n\nWhen compared with indexing, active portfolio management has two major drawbacks.\n\n\u2022 Active managers typically underperform their benchmark indexes. Thus their returns are usually less than those of the indexes.\n\n\u2022 Active management adds expenses that are charged to investors, further reducing returns.\n\nThe academics say that the most reliable predictor of the performance of two similar funds is operating expenses.\n\nAnd sure enough, Fidelity\u2019s actively managed 2055 fund has higher expenses and lower performance than the index version.\n\nHere\u2019s a brief comparison:\n\nTable 1: Short-term comparison of Fidelity 2055 target-date funds\n\nExpenses 2019 returns* Assets** FNSDX (active) 0.65% 15.02% $3,240 FDEWX (index) 0.12% 16.16% $602 *Through July 31 **In millions\n\nOver this seven-month period, the actively managed fund underperformed its index equivalent by more than a full percentage point. Roughly half that difference may be attributable to the higher expenses investors paid for that active management.\n\nBut the rest of the difference must be attributed to some other factor, and I think that is most likely the lower performance of the actively managed portfolio.\n\nThis underperformance is not a fluke of 2019, as we see in Table 2.\n\nTable 2: Longer term comparison of Fidelity 2055 target-date funds\n\nExpenses CRR 5 years ended 6/30/19 FNSDX (active) 0.65% 6.88% FDEWX (index) 0.12% 7.02%\n\nThe difference in 2019 appears to be due to relative underperformance of the actively managed fund. The difference in the longer term suggests the actively managed portfolio\u2019s performance was better than that of the indexes. But the difference was not enough to cover the higher management costs.\n\nAt the end of July, Fidelity reported the one-year performance of the index version of the fund as 4.45%; the actively managed version had a one-year return of only 1.3%.\n\nAs noted in Table 1, the actively managed fund has attracted more than $3.2 billion in assets. That\u2019s more than five times the assets in the index fund.\n\nI can only speculate about the reason for that striking difference.\n\nI think one reason is that, whether or not it is good for them, many investors continue to favor the hope that they might achieve superior performance from active management than from indexing.\n\nBut because the active version is obviously more lucrative for Fidelity, I\u2019m guessing Fidelity has promoted it much more heavily and offers it in many more retirement plans.\n\nThat means that millions of participants in 401(k) plans have the wrong choice, not the right choice, available to them.\n\nI want to advocate an easy fix: Require every retirement plan that offers an actively managed target-date fund to also offer the index-based version, if one is available.\n\nThis would be no burden for Fidelity, which routinely offers dozens of funds from which investors can choose. This would give investors a choice they deserve.\n\nIf the bookies in Las Vegas were taking bets on the long-term performance of actively managed funds vs. index funds, there\u2019s no question in my mind which would be favored.\n\nEarly this year, a study concluded that over the 15 years ended Dec. 31, 2018, the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.09% outperformed 92% of all actively managed large-cap core equity funds.\n\nFidelity has created the product that the bookies would likely favor \u2014 the target-date fund based on indexing. Fidelity, and the retirement plans that use its funds, should at the very least give investors the choice to have the odds in their favor.\n\nThe situation I\u2019ve described falls into the category of things that mutual-fund companies don\u2019t tell investors\u2026things that those investors really should know.\n\nTo find out what else is being kept from you, check out my latest podcast: \u201c21 things mutual-fund companies won\u2019t tell you.\u201d\n\nRichard Buck contributed to this article.", "description": "Look who\u2019s getting paid.
