This is about the game and rugby supporters across the world are absolutely astounded at this rigidity from World Rugby,\" Dodson told BBC radio.\n\nWorld Rugby's rebuke followed a terse exchange between the rival coaches, when Joseph suggested Scotland were out to avoid \"embarrassment\" and Scotland's Gregor Townsend said he \"had a good laugh\" at his opposite number's comments.\n\nJoseph was left fuming by Scotland's talk of legal action, saying the suggestion the hosts favored cancellation \"undermined\" their achievement in winning all three games so far.\n\n\"I feel they've undermined the achievements of the Japanese national team and the significance of Sunday's test match against Scotland for Japan,\" said the former All Black.\n\n\"We've played and won three test matches and that's put us in the best position in our pool,\" added Joseph. \"I'd like to remind everybody that hasn't been a fluke -- this team has been in camp for 240 days this year alone.\"\n\nOrganizers will assess the impact of the typhoon, set to strike the area on Saturday, before deciding to whether go ahead with the match at 7:45 p.m. on Sunday.\n\nJapan won three matches at the 2015 World Cup but failed to reach the knockout stage after a 45-10 loss to Scotland.\n\nBut they have captured the hearts of the baseball-mad nation after beating Russia 30-10, stunning Ireland 19-12 and thrashing Samoa 38-19.\n\nThe Pool A table-toppers will qualify for the quarterfinals if Sunday's game is cancelled, giving both teams two points for a 0-0 draw.\n\n\"My team is motivated by achieving something great -- not avoiding an embarrassment,\" insisted Joseph.\n\nScotland's Townsend later returned fire when he said: \"We know it wouldn't be an embarrassment to lose to Japan, we know they are an excellent side and we will have to play very well to win.\n\n\"I had a good laugh about them (Joseph's comments). You may know coaches use press conference to put messages out and get a response. Sometimes you don't get one.\"\n\nJapan, Scotland and Ireland are battling for the two quarterfinal places from Pool A. Ireland play their final game against Samoa on Saturday.\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP", "description": "World Rugby slammed Scotland over a \"disappointing\" threat of legal action on Friday as tempers flared over fears their pivotal game with World Cup hosts Japan will be cancelled because of a typhoon.
