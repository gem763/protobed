Gulen has denied involvement in the plot.\n\nAD\n\nGiuliani is now under scrutiny for his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Trump\u2019s political rivals. His earlier attempts to persuade the president to turn over the Turkish cleric represent another instance in which he appears to have been pushing a shadow foreign policy from his perch outside government.\n\nAD\n\nThe former New York mayor brought up Gulen so frequently with Trump during visits to the White House that one former official described the subject as Giuliani\u2019s \u201chobby horse.\u201d He was so focused on the issue \u2014 \u201cit was all Gulen,\u201d recalled a second former official \u2014 that White House aides worried that Giuliani was making the case on behalf of the Turkish government, former officials said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to arrest [Gulen] to do a solid for Erdogan,\u201d the second official said, describing the internal thinking.\n\nAD\n\nHowever, Trump appeared receptive to the idea, pressing his advisers about Gulen\u2019s status, the people said.\n\nOne former senior administration official recalled that Trump asked frequently about why Gulen couldn\u2019t be turned over to Turkey, referring to Erdogan as \u201cmy friend.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials were overwhelmingly opposed to the idea and told the president that the move could violate the legal process and damage him politically.\n\nAD\n\nWhite House officials did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear why Giuliani was championing a cause of such high importance to Erdogan \u2014 one the Turkish president personally raised with both the Obama administration and Trump. In 2017, Giuliani unsuccessfully pressed then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to help on another matter important to Erdogan: helping stop the U.S. prosecution of a Turkish Iranian trader, The Washington Post reported last week.\n\nAD\n\nGiuliani is not registered as a foreign lobbyist, as he would be required to do if he were being paid to lobby the U.S. government on a policy matter for a foreign interest.\n\nGiuliani told The Post in a phone interview late Monday that he never represented Turkey and so he does not need to register as a foreign lobbyist.\n\nIn a text exchange Tuesday afternoon, he declined to discuss whether he advocated for Gulen\u2019s extradition, writing: \u201ccan\u2019t comment on it that would be complete attorney client privilege but sounds wacky.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWhen told that multiple people described the conversations to The Post, Giuliani responded \u201cBull,\u201d and then liked the question with a thumbs-up emoji.\n\nAD\n\nHe did not return phone messages or respond to follow-up questions, except to add in a text that he \u201cwill not participate in an illegitimate, unconstitutional, and baseless \u2018impeachment inquiry.\u2019 \u201d\n\nFederal investigators are examining Giuliani\u2019s business dealings with two former associates who were arrested last week on campaign finance charges. A federal grand jury in New York has issued a subpoena to former GOP congressman Pete Sessions of Texas seeking records and other information on his interactions with Giuliani and his two associates. Giuliani has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nIn December, Trump told Erdogan his administration would take a look at Turkey\u2019s extradition request, the White House said at the time. In January, a U.S. delegation met with Turkish officials to discuss the request, according to Turkish state media.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nGiuliani\u2019s conversations with Trump about Gulen came on the heels of a similar effort by Michael Flynn, Trump\u2019s first national security adviser, and his then-associates to promote negative views of Gulen during the 2016 campaign and the presidential transition. \u201cWe should not provide him safe haven,\u201d Flynn wrote in a November 2016 opinion piece.\n\nFlynn admitted in December 2017 to lying about his contacts with the Russian ambassador and making false statements about work his consulting business did for Turkey. He has since argued in court that he is the victim of a government effort to smear him, although he has not withdrawn his guilty plea.\n\nReid Weingarten, an attorney for Gulen, said that he would find it disturbing if Giuliani was pressing for the cleric\u2019s return to Turkey on the heels of Flynn\u2019s efforts.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe have argued aggressively and I thought persuasively to both the Obama and Trump Justice Departments that the allegations against Gulen are false and that any effort to extradite him would fail legally and factually and would be an embarrassment to the United States,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cAfter Gen. Flynn\u2019s efforts on behalf of Turkey on this subject were exposed it is hard to believe Giuliani would follow suit.\u201d\n\nGiuliani has had a wide range of foreign clients even as he serves as the president\u2019s personal attorney. In interviews in recent months, Giuliani has acknowledged working with clients in Romania, Brazil, Bahrain, Colombia and Ukraine. He has represented an Iranian dissident group, once so controversial it was placed on the State Department list of terrorist organizations.\n\nGiuliani has said that he does not need to register with the Justice Department for his overseas clients because he does not lobby U.S. officials on their behalf.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t represent foreign government in front of the U.S. government,\u201d he told The Post earlier this year. \u201cI\u2019ve never registered to lobby.\u201d\n\nHowever, senior administration officials were so concerned that Giuliani might have been paid to push Turkey\u2019s interests that, at one point in 2017, they confronted him and asked him not to bring up Turkish issues when he met with the president, according to a person familiar with the conversation.\n\nWhen asked via text if he recalled the conversation, Giuliani responded by liking the question with a thumbs-up emoji.\n\nLobbying experts said that Giuliani\u2019s private conversations with Trump about policy matters \u2014 including his push for Gulen\u2019s extradition \u2014 could violate lobbying rules if he were pressing the matters on behalf of a foreign client.\n\nAD\n\nIn the case of the cleric, \u201cthe principal beneficiary of his work would be the Turkish government,\u201d said Joshua Rosenstein, a Washington lawyer who specializes in foreign lobbying rules.\n\nAD\n\nThe conversations Giuliani reportedly had with Trump about Gulen in 2017 came the same year he was representing Reza Zarrab, a Turkish Iranian accused of corruption.\n\nThe trader held embarrassing and politically damaging information about Erdogan and other top Turkish officials in his government, it was later revealed in federal court when Zarrab pleaded guilty to orchestrating a multibillion-dollar conspiracy to evade U.S. sanctions against Iran.\n\nErdogan had repeatedly lobbied Trump to release Zarrab, both in personal meetings and calls in the spring and summer of 2017, according to multiple administration officials and Erdogan himself. The Turkish president claimed publicly that Zarrab, charged in a conspiracy to violate U.S. sanctions against Iran, was a political \u201chostage\u201d of American law enforcement.\n\nAD\n\nGiuliani joined Zarrab\u2019s legal team in March 2017 and flew to Turkey in late February to meet with Erdogan to discuss a possible \u201cstate-to-state resolution in this case,\u201d according to court filings in the Zarrab case.\n\nIn affidavits filed in federal court, Giuliani said that \u201cat no time\u201d he had \u201cbeen involved in the representation of the Republic of Turkey\u201d or acted as the country\u2019s agent.\n\nHe acknowledged that his law firm did work for the Turkish government but said he was walled off from such discussions.\n\n\u201cNeither [my associate] nor I represent the interests of Turkey or the United States,\u201d Giuliani said in a May 2017 affidavit.\n\nHowever, lobbying experts said that his conversations with Trump and Tillerson to change U.S. policy on behalf of Zarrab, a foreign client, raised questions about why he did not register as a foreign lobbyist.\n\n\u201cIt seems Giuliani was acting on behalf of a foreign principal and representing those interests before a U.S. government official, which can trigger the registration requirement,\u201d said Matthew Sanderson, a Washington attorney who focuses on foreign lobbying registration.\n\nGiuliani maintained in an interview Monday that such registration was unnecessary.\n\n\u201cI have never lobbied for a foreign government,\u201d Giuliani said. He added that Zarrab was his client, not the Turkish government. \u201cI was working for him,\u201d not Turkey, Giuliani said. (Under foreign lobbying rules, registration is required not only for people representing foreign governments, but those representing other foreign interests on political matters in the United States.)", "description": "Former officials said Giuliani repeatedly made the case that the U.S. government should turn Fethullah Gulen over to Turkey, which has accused him of taking part in a 2016 coup.", "authors": ["Carol D.
