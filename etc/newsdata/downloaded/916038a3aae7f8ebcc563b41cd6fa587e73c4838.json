The rulings, which will be the first LGBT-related cases heard by the court since the retirement of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, could determine whether Title VII applies in cases of alleged anti-gay discrimination nation-wide.\n\nA potential precedent for the court involves a 1989 Supreme Court ruling in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins that discrimination on the basis of gender stereotypes is a form of sex discrimination, as well as an unanimous decision in the 1998 case Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, which protected workers from same-sex discrimination, but requires \u201cneither asexuality nor androgyny.\u201d\n\nThe cases, two involving gay men and one involving a transgender woman, will be heard in two hour-long arguments. The two gay plaintiffs, Gerald Bostock and Donald Zarda, argue that they were fired because of their sexual orientation and Federal Appeals Courts subsequently split on the question of whether their firings were prohibited under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nThe 11th Circuit in Atlanta ruled against Bostock, citing a 1979 decision that held that \u201cdischarge for homosexuality is not prohibited by Title VII,\u201d while the Second Circuit, in New York came to the opposite conclusion in Zarda\u2019s case, ruling that \u201csexual orientation discrimination is motivated, at least in part, by sex and is thus a subset of sex discrimination.\u201d\n\nThe argument in R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission poses a different question in whether Title VII applies to transgender people. Aimee Stephens was fired from a Michigan funeral home after transitioning to a transgender woman in 2013, and sued for sexual discrimination.\n\nIn a ruling from the Sixth Circuit, the court found that Title VII included transgender discrimination, stating \u201cIt is analytically impossible to fire an employee based on that employee\u2019s status as a transgender person without being motivated, at least in part, by the employee\u2019s sex.\u201d\n\nThe court\u2019s decision could determine whether \u201cgender identity\u201d is a protected class under the Civil Rights Act, and could have a major impact on sex-specific bathrooms, fitness standards, and athletic competitions, potentially changing the interpretation of a 1998 decision that forced Virginia Military Institute to admit women. In the majority opinion, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg then-argued that the ruling \u201cwould undoubtedly require alterations necessary to afford members of each sex privacy from the other sex in living arrangements.\u201d", "description": "The court\u2019s decision could determine whether gender identity is a protected class under the Civil Rights Act.", "authors": ["Tobias Hoonhout", "Andrew C.
