Oh, you scout them for the future, sure. And yes, you stash them on your dynasty rosters. And usually a few running backs become viable right away, a position where the ramp-up time can be next to nil.\n\nBut in 2019, it\u2019s safe to say, the Kids are Alright. And that was especially the case in Week 8.\n\nThe Giants fell at Detroit, but don\u2019t blame quarterback Daniel Jones, who rifled four touchdown passes. Gardner Minshew continued to mark his territory in Jacksonville, tossing three scoring passes (and rushing for 28 yards) as the Jags held off the Jets. And although the Bears had a gut-punch loss to the Chargers (imagine that, the Chargers winning a game like that), don\u2019t pin it on rookie tailback David Montgomery. The Iowa State product rattled off 147 total yards and a score.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nJones, it should be said, had a better fantasy day than real-life day. He lost a fumble, and the Lions charitably dropped at least one interception. But 322 yards and 7.9 YPA, we\u2019ll take those numbers. And Jones spread the ball nicely, using four primary targets against Detroit\u2019s depleted secondary. Heck, fellow rookie Darius Slayton had two of the scoring catches.\n\nThe Giants aren\u2019t going to the playoffs this year. What they\u2019re looking for is hope, and a glimpse of the future. Jones\u2019 best game remains the comeback victory at Tampa Bay in his starting debut, but this effort was at least a step forward. We\u2019ll scout him up close a week from Monday, when the Giants host Dallas in a grudge match.\n\nDaniel Jones was one step ahead of the Lions defense for most of Sunday. (Scott W.

He came through nicely \u2014 22-for-34, 279 yards, the three touchdowns. He only took two sacks and wasn\u2019t intercepted, though he did lose another fumble. His poise in the pocket can be a double-edged sword at times; occasionally, he holds onto the ball too long.\n\nMinshew\u2019s touchdown collection once again came at the expense of Leonard Fournette, who handled 26 touches for 136 total yards but couldn\u2019t get into the paint. One run was marked mere inches from the goal line. Positive touchdown regression is likely to come Fournette\u2019s way, any week now. But Jacksonville\u2019s passing game looms plenty formidable, with Chris Conley (4-103-1) and D.J. Chark (6-79-1) representing nicely. The only negative for the Jags offense \u2014 Dede Westbrook (neck/shoulder) was dinged up again, and didn\u2019t play in the second half.\n\nNick Foles could be back in three weeks. Minshew has given the Jaguars plenty to think about. Jacksonville draws Houston next week, then it\u2019s the Week 10 bye.\n\nMontgomery was started in 36 percent of Yahoo leagues this week, which showcases just how desperate we can be at the running back position. After all, he barely played against New Orleans last week, and was sitting on a mediocre batch of statistics (3.3 YPC, a piddly 11 catches). He stood as the RB38 before Sunday\u2019s play.\n\nMatt Nagy said he wanted Montgomery heavily involved this week, and the head coach kept his word. Montgomery carried 27 times for 135 yards \u2014 including a 55-yard scamper in the second quarter \u2014 and added four short receptions (12 yards). Meanwhile, Tarik Cohen had seven touches and Mike Davis just three. For once, the Bears seemed to pick a lane on offense and stick to it.\n\nThe Eagles could be a challenge next week \u2014 a defense that basically gives away the pass but stops the run fairly well. But Montgomery\u2019s handling of the bell-cow role should mark some territory. The Bears certainly don\u2019t want their offense to be defined by struggling quarterback Mitchell Trubisky.\n\nIf we were going to tackle every 2019 rookie of note, this column would never end. Miles Sanders had a breakout day working in Buffalo, exploding for 118 total yards and a touchdown on just six touches before a shoulder injury took him out of the action. Devin Singletary was also splashy in the same game, with 49 yards and a score on just seven opportunities. The future is bright for both of these backs, it\u2019s just a matter of when their teams decide they\u2019re ready for featured work.\n\nDK Metcalf\u2019s Week 8 was all touchdown deodorant \u2014 although he had just three catches for 13 yards, he scored twice. Red-zone work is always appreciated, and he might have more end-zone visits coming. Tampa\u2019s chewed-up secondary is on tap for Week 9.\n\nNote: I\u2019ll be back with more Week 8 takeaways later tonight.", "description": "A batch of rookies had strong showings in Week 8.
