The surprising part is the $110 million in guaranteed, the most guaranteed money ever in NFL history.\n\nWhile it isn\u2019t the highest percentage of guaranteed money ever given out in a contract \u2013 a number of players have fully guaranteed contracts \u2013 the number is large and carries some risk.\n\nJeff Diamond thinks the Rams did a good job in wrapping up Goff long-term, even if they had to pay a premium. A former president of the Minnesota Vikings and general manager of the Tennessee Titans, Diamond said there\u2019s certainly a roll of the dice but one worth taking for the Rams.\n\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s a calculated risk, as all player contracts are,\u201d Diamond told FOX Business. \u201cBut the Rams are paying the going rate for their franchise quarterback who has been a Pro Bowler the past two seasons and was a Super Bowl quarterback last year.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year in his third NFL season, Goff threw for 4,688 yards with 32 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. He made his second career Pro Bowl and took the Rams to the Super Bowl.\n\nAs for the overall size and scope of the deal, Diamond thinks it is on par with other quarterbacks around the league.\n\nThis past summer, the Philadelphia Eagles signed their young quarterback Carson Wentz to a four-year, $128 million contract that tacks on to the existing two years of his rookie contract. Wentz, who was on pace two years ago for an MVP caliber season before a season-ending injury, is primed for a big 2019 season.The Goff deal falls in line with what the Eagles did with their star quarterback.\n\n\u201cIt is slightly higher than the Carson Wentz deal, which is $154 mil over six years, and Wentz\u2019s new money was $128 million over four years, so Goff\u2019s deal is slightly above Wentz\u2019s,\u201d Diamond said.\n\n\u201cAnd Goff\u2019s new money of $134 million over four [years] or $33.5 million per year is below Russell Wilson\u2019s new money in his recently signed deal, which was $35 mil per year. So it appears the Goff extension is very much in line with what I would have expected.\u201d\n\nAnd the trickle down might hit other players, such as Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, who likely will be negotiating a new contract next offseason.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\n\"I think Dak Prescott will receive similar new money when he is extended by the Cowboys,\" Diamond said.", "description": "Jared Goff's new contract set a record for guaranteed money, but there is a level risk taken by the Los Angeles Rams.", "authors": ["Kristian Dyer"], "top_image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2017/11/0/0/jaredgoffkm.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "published_at": "2019-09-05"}
