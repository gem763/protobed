But, the ACLU noted, the government has not laid out a clear definition of how the Secret Service determines who qualifies as a subject of interest.\n\n\"For operational security purposes we do not comment on the means and methods of how we conduct our protective operations,\" a US Secret Service spokesperson told BuzzFeed News in an email.\n\n\n\nThe move falls in line with the increasing use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement and the broader government in general. Last week, a group of seven House Democrats sent a third letter to one of the most public providers of facial recognition technology, the tech giant Amazon, demanding details about the technology's accuracy and potential racial bias. (To be clear, Amazon does not appear to be involved in the US Secret Service's pilot.) The US Customs and Border Protection has also deployed the tech at airport gates, ostensibly to detect visa overstays and for national security, and the Transportation Security Administration has an upcoming plan to roll out the tech even more broadly at airports.\n\nYet Congress has never explicitly authorized the use of facial recognition technology on American citizens, according to an in-depth report by Georgetown Law's Center on Privacy and Technology. And the technology is still plagued by inaccuracies; an ACLU test of Amazon Rekognition in May, for example, showed that the technology falsely matched 28 members of Congress with arrest mugshots \u2014 and the false matches were disproportionately people of color.\n\n\"Unfortunately, our government agencies have a long history of labeling people threats based on their race, religion, or political beliefs,\" Stanley said. The group is concerned now that use of the technology to surveil the surrounding areas of the White House may clamp down on protests in the area. In Maryland, police already demonstrated their willingness to use facial recognition tech to monitor protesters during the unrest and rioting in Baltimore in 2015.\n\nHouse Democrats wrote in their letter last week that while facial recognition technology may one day serve as a useful tool for law enforcement, \"At this time, we have serious concerns that this type of product has significant accuracy issues, places disproportionate burdens on communities of color, and could stifle Americans\u2019 willingness to exercise their First Amendment rights in public.\u201d", "description": "A government document, published last week, describes how the Secret Service will scan video feeds and images of individuals passing by on public streets and parks near the White House.", "authors": ["Davey Alba", "Buzzfeed News Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-12/4/11/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-web-03/original-4042-1543942272-2.jpg?crop=1244:651;0,178", "published_at": "2018-12-04"}
