Raheem Sterling, Marcus Rashford and Harry Kane are the incumbents and have Southgate's trust but you could argue Tammy Abraham and Jadon Sancho are more deserving of starts on current form.\n\nThat said, Southgate is trying to create a culture where England starts are earned rather than handed out as a pat on the back.\n\nJohn Stones is out injured and Joe Gomez is slightly off colour, so it could be a central defensive partnership of Harry Maguire and Michael Keane which does not look the most convincing nor complimentary.\n\nEngland's other long-standing problem has been a lack of technical assurance and creativity in midfield, but James Maddison and Mason Mount look exactly what they need in this area. In fact, the pair have pushed Dele Alli down the pecking order with their performances.\n\nAsked what had impressed him about Mount, Southgate said: \u201cExactly what I thought of him when I saw him playing for our Under-16s. He\u2019s a quality player, an intelligent footballer, presses well, has a real eye for goal, good quality. So, nothing I\u2019ve seen surprises me at all.\n\nTeam news on the way shortly.", "description": "Excellent save from Pickford!", "authors": ["Daniel Zeqiri", "Live Updates", "Oliver Brown"], "top_image": "https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/football/2019/10/11/TELEMMGLPICT000212754915-xlarge_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqF9BD_fYQB0teZOF4IslN2Ui6L4XAoX9KJ12arlP6KhI.jpeg?imwidth=1200", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
