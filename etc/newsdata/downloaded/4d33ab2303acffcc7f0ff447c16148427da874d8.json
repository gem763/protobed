It is not a learning difficulty because it has zero effect on intelligence.\n\nHow people experience it, like with anything else, can vary greatly. And, as things currently stand, it is something that you live with for life.\n\nAlthough the exact cause is still a medical mystery, we know so much more about how we can help those with dyslexia.\n\nWhile some with dyslexia may be slower to read or write, it has no effect on their intelligence (Pic: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nDr Daryl Brown is the headmaster at Maple Hayes Dyslexia School. Daryl is the son of Dr Neville Brown who developed a unique morphological approach to literacy learning which is used at the school.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe method uses picture icons to attach meaning to morphemes, or word segments.\n\nUsing synthetic phonics, students are taught to build up pronunciations for unfamiliar written words by translating letters into sounds and blending the sounds together.\n\nSo, when it comes to dyslexia, he knows his stuff.\n\nHere\u2019s Daryl\u2019s 7 tips on how to support people with dyslexia in the workplace:\n\nMentor\n\nMake sure they\u2019re aware of who to go to if they find they are struggling \u2013 but don\u2019t leave it until there\u2019s a problem. Break the ice with a regular meeting just to make sure everything is going OK. It doesn\u2019t have to be formal, a few minutes chat at the right time can stop a minor difficulty escalating to a disaster. Make that chat part of the routine, the mentor should be proactive but discreet.\n\nAsk\n\nEach dyslexic will have come up with their own strategies. Ask them what they are \u2013 often what helps a dyslexic will also benefit others. They may also have different ways of doing things and looking at things. Take advantage of their expertise.\n\nVisualise\n\nA picture speaks a thousand words and makes life a hell of a lot easier for dyslexics (Pic: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nUse visual prompts in presentations and paperwork, like simple clipart images or colour coding to distinguish between key background information. Colour code for mandatory and advisory, much like road signs. Use the same prompts for all your presentations. Remember that complicated images and photographs will be distracting, so don\u2019t have them on the same Powerpoint slide as the information you want to be remembered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStandardise\n\nStick to the same format for paperwork/forms so it\u2019s easy to find/enter information. Organisations often have different forms for different purposes and for different departments.\n\nUse larger/bold print for important information. Use the same font for the paperwork and right justify rather than full justify large amounts of text. The visual pattern of the different line lengths will help the dyslexic keep track of where they are on the page.\n\nOrganise\n\nDon\u2019t attempt long tasks. Have tasks broken down into stages that can be \u2018ticked off\u2019. What needs to be done by the end of the day, the end of the week, and so on.\n\nMake sure time is set aside to complete them. This is good time management but dyslexics often also have organisational difficulties and operating a routine (like having a school timetable) with structured blocks of time will certainly help.\n\nMinimise\n\nToo many visual distractions in the workplace can get in the way of focus and productivity (Picture: Ella Byworth for Metro.co.uk)\n\nHave a clearly defined work area with minimal distractions. Many dyslexics will struggle to maintain concentration when there is background noise or if there are visual distractions like display screens. Make sure the work area is only for that purpose and go somewhere else for a break.\n\nPlan\n\nExtra time will be needed to work through written material \u2013 reduce this by giving out information before the meeting, give a bullet point list with key information, identify the keywords that may be difficult \u2013 this may include people\u2019s names and business names.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are the signs of dyslexia? According to the NHS, signs of dyslexia usually become apparent when a child starts school and begins to focus more on learning how to read and write. A person with dyslexia may: read and write very slowly\n\nconfuse the order of letters in words\n\nput letters the wrong way round\n\n(such as writing \u201cb\u201d instead of \u201cd\u201d)\n\n(such as writing \u201cb\u201d instead of \u201cd\u201d) have poor or inconsistent spelling\n\nunderstand information when told verbally, but have difficulty with information that\u2019s written down\n\nfind it hard to carry out a sequence of directions\n\nstruggle with planning and organisation But people with dyslexia often have good skills in other areas, such as creative thinking and problem solving.\n\nMaple Hayes Dyslexia School in Lichfield is rated Outstanding by Ofsted, with a glowing report on its provision for the most vulnerable in society. Daryl studied Geology at Oxford and completed his teacher training at Birmingham University. He then returned to Oxford to complete a doctorate in Geology before returning to Maple Hayes to teach. He has a Master\u2019s degree in the Psychology of Specific Learning Difficulties and took on the role of headteacher of the school in 2001 to help his father. Alongside Dr Brown senior, he has been working on the Dictionary of Morphemes and, through their studies, the duo have already mapped out around 49,800 words formed from 3,713 morphemes.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement", "description": "According to the British Dyslexia Association, 10% of the UK is thought to be dyslexic.
