(former All Blacks assistant coach) Wayne Smith is an example of that.\n\n\"He wanted to grow his awareness of the game. At one stage he was an attack coach, then he became a defence coach and crossed boundaries, so you have to be prepared to do that.\"\n\nDespite the advances in sports science and the evolution of rugby, he said, at its essence it was still a relatively simple game -- get hold of the ball, control it and create opportunities to exploit space.\n\nThe big problem was getting all 15 players on a team to work together to do exactly that, he said with a grin. And while coaches did not need to be an 'outside-the-box thinker' to be successful they did need to be adaptable.\n\n\"Rugby is a big challenge. You have got 15 players and you have to get them wanting to work together to get the outcome you want,\" he said.\n\n\"You don't need to be a radical thinker, there are other things that come first.\n\n\"If you want to develop as a coach, then the more you do the better you get. You don't get worse, you get better. But the higher the level you go, you do need something else.\"\n\n(Editing by Peter Rutherford)", "description": "By Greg StutchburyTOKYO, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Identifying talent, having the courage to select players with growth potential and showing a willingness to...", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/m_logo_636x382px.png", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
