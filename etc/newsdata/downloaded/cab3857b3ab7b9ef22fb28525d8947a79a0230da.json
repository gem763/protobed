Lance Gooden drew the ire of CNN anchor Poppy Harlow this week for mentioning \u201cfake news\u201d on the network.\n\nThe Texas Republican blasted the media for shrugging its collective shoulders over the Democrats\u2019 secretive impeachment inquiry when he was ordered to watch his language on CNN\u2019s air.\n\n\u201cDemocrats have the right to hold this inquiry the way they are doing it now,\u201d Ms. Harlow said Friday. \u201cThey do. That\u2019s just a fact.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying it\u2019s illegal what they\u2019re doing, but the American people are outraged,\u201d he said through cross-talk. \u201cThey are outraged by this process. And the fact that the fake news media is not outraged \u2026 is pretty telling.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cPlease don\u2019t insult the media on this network or on this show, on our show,\u201d the anchor replied.\n\nMs. Harlow then chided the Republican for a Sept. 26 Twitter post, which read, \u201cThe democrats want to impeach a president trying to expose a crime, then elect a person who committed a crime.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou say it\u2019s just a Twitter post, but it\u2019s your words and your words matter a lot,\u201d Ms. Harlow said.\n\n\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t say it\u2019s just a Twitter post. I said you\u2019re [comparing] a Twitter post to an impeachment inquiry,\u201d the congressman replied.\n\n\n\n\u201cI apologize,\u201d the anchor said. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have added the word \u2018just.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe democrats want to impeach a president trying to expose a crime, then elect a person who committed a crime. \u2014 Lance Gooden (@Lancegooden) September 27, 2019\n\nThe crux of Mr. Gooden\u2019s argument throughout the segment was that Democrats appear desperate to impeach the president with no evidence.\n\n\u201c[They\u2019ve said if] Nancy Pelosi had waited just a few more days, we probably wouldn\u2019t have gone down this path,\u201d the GOP congressman said. \u201cWhen I talk to my colleagues across the aisle, they have no idea how this thing ends. They have no plan. They just know that as soon as they actually cave and have to vote on something, then they\u2019re in a position they don\u2019t want to be in because they\u2019re having to take a stand on the record, which is what Republicans have a problem with.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
