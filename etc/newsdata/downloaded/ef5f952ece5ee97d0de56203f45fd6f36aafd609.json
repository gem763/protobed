(AP Photo/Paul Sancya)\n\nPresident Trump is on a fast track to an easy reelection. That's the conclusion reached by economic forecasters -- despite headlines from Washington that suggest Trump\u2019s political fortunes are only pointed south as he battles an encroaching impeachment inquiry and Republican defections over his handling of the Syrian crisis.\n\nMoody\u2019s Analytics projects the president will win handily next year if the economy doesn\u2019t badly stumble \u2014 and in fact, rack up a greater margin in the electoral college than the 304-to-227 victory he secured against Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\n\u201cIf the economy a year from now is the same as it is today, or roughly so, then the power of incumbency is strong and Trump\u2019s election odds are very good, particularly if Democrats aren\u2019t enthusiastic and don\u2019t get out to vote,\u201d Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics and co-author of the paper outlining the findings, tells CNBC\u2019s Brian Schwartz. \u201cIt\u2019s about turnout.\u201d (I laid out an argument against this kind of modeling here).\n\nBut assuming average Democratic turnout, the firm projects the 2020 map will look like this:\n\nThe finding jibes with those of other forecasting models that rely on measures of the economy\u2019s strength to predict which major party\u2019s candidate will win the White House next. Oxford Economics sees Trump winning 55 percent of the popular vote next year barring a \u201csignificant downturn\u201d in the economy.\n\n\u201cWhile a wide range of issues have influenced presidential elections over the last few decades, from health care and foreign policy, to taxation and government spending, one factor has been constant: It\u2019s the economy, stupid,\u201d Greg Daco and James Watson, two senior economists with the firm, wrote last week.\n\nAnd by the reckoning of the firm\u2019s model, three key economic indicators \u2014 unemployment, inflation and real disposable income growth \u2014 all favor Trump\u2019s reelection. They outweigh a \u201cnegative exhaustion factor\u201d with Trump that dents his support in the projection.\n\nDaco and Watson acknowledge the economy isn\u2019t everything. But their model, which leans on it, accurately predicts all but two popular vote outcomes going back to 1948. See their results here:\n\nThey point to two key caveats that could hamstring their model\u2019s accuracy this time. It \u201cexcludes noneconomic factors about a candidate\u2019s record that are vital in most elections\u201d and \u201cpays no attention to candidates\u2019 attributes such as race, gender or \u2018likeability\u2019 \u2014 a factor that may be centrally important in 2020.\u201d And a severe recession, \u201cpotentially triggered by a combination of rising tariffs, declining profit margins and an adverse financial market shock,\u201d could also turn the projection against Trump\u2019s reelection.\n\nAnother model, assembled by Trend Macrolytics, accurately predicts every presidential victor back to 1952 by focusing on the effects of the economy and incumbency on the electoral college, according to Donald Luskin, the firm\u2019s chief investment officer. It projects Trump will win reelection next year with 354 electoral votes \u2014 a margin that seems staggering on its face. \u201cTo get something that high, you have to go back to Ronald Reagan, and that may not be possible in the red-blue world we live in now,\u201d Luskin tells me.\n\nThe model stakes first-term incumbents with a heavy advantage. (That edge curdles into a disadvantage for candidates running to extend their party\u2019s hold on the White House into a third or fourth term. See: George H.W. Bush in 1992 or Al Gore in 2000.) And then it factors in six economic indicators, including oil prices, personal income, inflation and tax burdens.\n\nOne seemingly important measure the model doesn\u2019t include: The president\u2019s approval rating. Luskin says it actually doesn\u2019t carry much predictive power. And besides, Trump\u2019s remains in the middle of the pack for presidents around the 1,000-day mark in their first term:\n\nOf his own model\u2019s projection, Luskin says \u201cit is directionally correct, and I\u2019m willing to put real money that Trump is going to be reelected, assuming all the model inputs are the same as they are today.\u201d But he adds that \u201cyou and I and Mark Zandi should take a humility pill here. We still live in a world of imponderables, and these are very rough navigation tools.\u201d\n\nYou are reading The Finance 202, our must-read tipsheet on where Wall Street meets Washington.

The Post's Michael Birnbaum, William Booth and Quentin Ari\u00e8s: \"European and British negotiators struck a deal Thursday to split Britain from the European Union, raising the prospect that the country could be out of the bloc by the end of October. Negotiators working through the night in Brussels struck a deal Thursday morning after Prime Minister Boris Johnson signed on despite lingering questions about warring Brexit factions in London. The agreement would still need approval by European leaders and the British Parliament...\n\n\"It could still fall apart in Parliament, as a previous deal did under Johnson\u2019s predecessor, Theresa May. Diplomats said that if a deal is reached Thursday, it could still be possible \u2014 just barely \u2014 to get it ratified by the European Parliament by the end of the month, giving Johnson a strong incentive to wrestle his warring political tribes into submission.\"\n\n\u2014 Consumer spending slows: \u201cU.S. consumers unexpectedly pulled back on retail spending for the first time in seven months, reviving fears that a weakening economy could finally be taking its toll on American shoppers just before the pivotal holiday season,\u201d my colleague Abha Bhattarai reports.\n\n\u201cRetail sales slipped 0.3 percent in September from the month before, the U.S. Commerce Department said, as shoppers spent less on automobiles, building materials and sporting goods. Sales at department stores fell 1.4 percent from the month before, while online shopping slipped by 0.3 percent.\u201d\n\nWhat it means: \u201cRetailers, already rattled by [Trump\u2019s] ongoing trade war with China, are watching closely as they prepare for the all-important holiday shopping season. Recent sales declines signal \u2018an early chill for retailers,\u2019 Diane Swonk, chief economist at professional services firm Grant Thornton, wrote in a note to clients.\u201d\n\nBofA, JPMorgan Fueled by \u2018Incredibly Strong\u2019 U.S. Consumer If U.S. consumers are on the brink of a downturn, the nation\u2019s biggest banks aren\u2019t seeing it.

Trump, Xi and other heads of state are expected to participate in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum being held in Santiago from Nov. 11 to Nov. 17.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, uncertainty hangs over the Chinese commitment to step up farm purchases, WSJ's Chao Deng and Lingling Wei report: \"China has promised to buy more U.S. farm products, but questions remain over how much, the time frame for purchases, and what the U.S. might have to give in return...\n\n\"Chinese negotiators continue to say purchases must be based on actual demand and at fair-market prices, according to people briefed by the matter. The roughly $50 billion in farm products touted by [Trump] is far beyond what China has historically spent in any one year and would likely require Beijing to lean heavily on its state-owned firms to accomplish.\"\n\n\u2014 Senators look to defy Beijing pressing ahead on Hong Kong bill: \u201cRepublican senators said that \u201cthey want to move quickly on legislation to support pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong despite a threat of retaliation from China,\u201d Bloomberg News\u2019s Daniel Flatley and Iain Marlow report.\n\n\u201c\u2018Hong Kong is a high priority for me,\u2019 said GOP Senator Jim Risch, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. \u2018We\u2019re going to move on it as rapidly as we can.\u2019 Senator Roy Blunt, a member of the Senate GOP leadership, said there haven\u2019t been any discussions about the timing for a vote on Hong Kong legislation similar to a measure that passed the House Tuesday.\u201d\n\nSEC freezes assets of 18 traders over alleged manipulation The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said the traders had been manipulating more than 3,000 U.S.-listed securities for at least six years, using multiple accounts to create artificially high or low prices to buy or sell at a profit.

Vanity Fair's William Cohan: \"In the last 10 minutes of trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Friday, September 13, someone got very lucky. That\u2019s when he or she, or a group of people, sold short 120,000 'S&P e-minis'\u2014electronically traded futures contracts linked to the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 stock index\u2014when the index was trading around 3010. The time was 3:50 p.m. in New York; it was nearing midnight in Tehran. A few hours later, drones attacked a large swath of Saudi Arabia\u2019s oil infrastructure, choking off production in the country and sending oil prices soaring. By the time the CME next opened, for pretrading on Sunday night, the S&P index had fallen 30 points, giving that very fortunate trader, or traders, a quick $180 million profit. It was not an isolated occurrence...\n\n\"Traders in the Chicago pits have been watching these kinds of wagers with an increasing mixture of shock and awe since the start of the Trump presidency. They are used to rapid fluctuations in the S&P 500 index; volatility is common, of course. But the precision and timing of these trades, and the vast amount of money being made as a result of them, make the traders wonder if all this is on the level.\"\n\nPOCKET CHANGE\n\nBill Jackson, of St. Louis, gives a thumbs up to drivers that wave or honk as United Auto Workers outside the GM Wentzville Assembly Center in Missouri.
