You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nBut she decided she had to break her metropolitan duck this weekend \u2013 in the name of demanding a second Brexit referendum.\n\nShe joined a million people marching through the capital asking for just one thing: to be asked again.\n\n\u201cI just feel this is so important that I had to come,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, though. I always thought my first time in London would be for sightseeing. Not because the country was in existential crisis.\u201d\n\nThe march route, for what it\u2019s worth, took in Trafalgar Square, Marble Arch and the Houses of Parliament. \u201cSo I suppose I did get to see a few sights,\u201d she added. \u201cTwo birds, one stone, and all that.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Say during a march in London EPA\n\nAs MPs sat in the Commons for the first time on a Saturday since 1982, this vast rally outside was the physical embodiment of what campaigners say is the ever-growing support \u2013 and necessity \u2013 for a Final Say People\u2019s Vote to resolve Brexit once and for all.\n\nSupporters came \u2013 young and old, Labour and Tory, by train and by coach \u2013 from the four corners of the UK to listen to speakers, including Sadiq Khan, Jo Swinson and Star Trek legend Patrick Stewart, make the case for another referendum. They came wearing blue and yellow, and waving EU flags. One arrived, uniquely perhaps, with a saucepan lid and wooden spoon.\n\n\u201cFor making a noise,\u201d explained 70-year-old Marian Hemsted, from Sevenoaks in Kent, banging them together by way of demonstration. \u201cWe want them to hear us in parliament and get the message. I\u2019m not sure I have a strong enough voice to cheer everything I agree with today but I can hit a saucepan lid with the best of them.\u201d\n\nShe had come with daughter Rebecca and nine-month-old grandson Nathan. \u201cI\u2019m not sure he has an opinion on Brexit quite yet,\u201d she admitted of the tot.\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

There was one woman, Tanya Hall, dressed as an EU fairy: \u201cI made my wings using old coat hangers, tights and blue car spray from the back of the garage,\u201d the 51-year-old said. \u201cIt represents how wonderful the EU is.\u201d\n\nBut, with a referendum appearing to be somehow simultaneously both closer and further away than ever, there was also a sense of urgency, anger and purpose \u2013 among both the crowd and the speakers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen a greater contrast between a political system that\u2019s blocked and broken, versus the energy and clarity that comes from you all marching peacefully through the streets today,\u201d Christian Broughton, editor of The Independent, said during his speech. \u201cThe importance of giving you \u2013 giving everyone \u2013 the Final Say has never been clearer.\u201d\n\nOthers, including Michael Heseltine and Diane Abbott, were cheered as they riffed on other familiar themes: that Britain would be poorer out the EU, that the original referendum was built on lies, that Boris Johnson couldn\u2019t be trusted with a pair of scissors, let alone the well-being of an entire country.\n\nSandi Toksvig compared him to a dodgy used car salesman who had sold the public a broken vehicle from \u2013 wait for it \u2013 the \u201cNigel garage\u201d.\n\nIf that joke got a cheer, it was nothing compared to the reaction when the big screens showed live footage of the Letwin amendment being passed in the House of Commons \u2013 essentially making a Brexit delay more likely. Rarely can a vote in parliament have been greeted with such a roar. It was not dissimilar, one imagines, to how a world cup winning England goal might be greeted.\n\n\u201cThe whole referendum was built on lies,\u201d said 71-year-old Felicity Goodall, who had been walking with three generations of her family. \u201cNo one told us anything about the consequences of leaving the EU or the mess it would get us into for three years. We were hoodwinked then and we\u2019re being left voiceless now \u2013 and that can\u2019t be allowed to happen.\u201d\n\nIt would, as it happens, have been four generations of her family marching but her 97-year-old father, Stephen Goodall, who attended both previous London rallies \u2013 one last November and one in March \u2013 had come down with a cold on Friday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s devastated he can\u2019t be here again,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he\u2019s here in spirit. He is desperate to see the UK remain. He says the EU is the reason there has been 70 years of peace in Europe, and he should know. He fought in World War Two and was in the army for 30 years after.\u201d\n\nAs ever at these rallies there were plenty of placards. They ranged from the poetic (\u201cLet\u2019s stay with the stars\u201d) to the risque: \u201cNo one consented to this BJ\u201d, read one.\n\nKate Chacksfield\u2019s homemade effort declared her to be \u201cmiddle aged and slightly miffed\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the first sign I\u2019ve ever made,\u201d the 52-year-old mother-of-three, of London, said. \u201cBut I think, increasingly, I\u2019m more than miffed. I\u2019m angry by it all. Being in the EU brings so many opportunities \u2013 economically and culturally \u2013 and we are throwing away those opportunities so our children can\u2019t enjoy them.\u201d\n\nShe would not stop campaigning, she said, until the decision was reversed \u2013 nor was she alone in this.\n\nAsked what they would do if a deal was passed and the UK did, indeed, leave the EU, most were defiant.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d start campaigning to re-enter,\u201d said Alan Wheeler, a 50-year-old trade association director from Maidstone. \u201cI think all this energy and anger that you see today, it won\u2019t just disappear. People won\u2019t just accept it if we leave. They will campaign to become a member again. These rallies will continue now until, one way or another, Brexit is no more. It is too important to just let go.\u201d", "description": "For Pauline Hardman, it was her first ever time in London.
