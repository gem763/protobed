MLS has stated in its Fan Code of Conduct that \"Using (including on any sign or other visible representation) political, threatening, abusive, insulting, offensive language and/or gestures, which includes racist, homophobic, xenophobic, sexist or otherwise inappropriate language or behavior\" is prohibited at stadiums to preserve the safety of games.\n\nSome critics have said the Betsy Ross flag connotes slavery and has been used by far-right groups also flying the Confederate battle flag. But others claim that interpretation is an overstatement and that the flag refers solely to the fight for independence.\n\nShortly before July 4, Nike pulled a new shoe that featured the Betsy Ross flag on the heel before its launch date on the advice of former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who said he found the shoe offensive. Kaepernick has been an outspoken advocate of the Black Lives Matter movement and started a trend of kneeling during the \"Star-Spangled Banner\" at NFL games to protest police killings of African-Americans.\n\n\"It just kind of bothered me that [Nike was] going to take it away,\" Diana said. \"It\u2019s a great flag, and I love it.\"\n\nRSL said the stadium personnel's decision to ask that the flag be taken down during the game was in line with the team's belief that the symbol was too controversial to be permitted at the stadiums.\n\n\"Recently, and very controversially as well as surprising to us, the Colonial flag has been adopted as a symbol for hate groups,\" RSL Chief Business Officer Andy Carroll said in a statement to FOX 13. \"Any controversial flags or other similar banners or signs with symbols of hatred, divisiveness and/or intolerance whether intentional or otherwise will not be permitted in our stadiums.
