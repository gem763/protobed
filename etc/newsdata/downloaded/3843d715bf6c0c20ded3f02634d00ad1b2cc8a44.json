The Wall Street Journal reported that Carter\u2019s entertainment company, Roc Nation, would be helping the NFL enhance its game experiences and expand its social-justice ventures. Most recently, the venture has announced a line of merchandise and an initiative that will highlight a new song each month during NFL promotions.\n\nAs the 2019 season kicks off on Thursday, it remains unclear what this partnership will achieve\u2014especially in light of the news that Kaepernick was reportedly not consulted on its activism efforts. The league continues to wrestle with perceptions that it\u2019s a socially backward institution, and responses to the news of Jay-Z\u2019s profitable involvement with the NFL have varied from cautious optimism to strident criticism. Regardless of what Carter envisions, though, the 2019 season\u2014and the broader landscape of sports activism\u2014will undoubtedly bring no shortage of continued advocacy of all types from the players themselves.\n\nBeck Diefenbach/Reuters\n\n3. The Impossible Burger Marches On\n\nYou\u2019ll soon be able to buy the meat alternative in grocery stores.\n\nOlga Khazan writes about health.\n\nPlant-based meat has taken over Americans' taste buds\u2014and is now storming grocery stores. The Impossible Burger is slated to hit shelves as early as next month. Burger King and a few other burger joints already carry the soy-heavy meatless meat. A competitor product, Beyond Meat, is already in several restaurants and grocery stores. (Your correspondent, who is admittedly not a huge meat lover, has tried Beyond Meat, and finds that it smells like cat food while it's cooking but ultimately tastes like the real thing.)\n\nVeganism and vegetarianism are on the rise, and some Americans are growing more concerned about climate change, which cow farming contributes to. But many of the founders of these new-meat start-ups suspect that flavor and price are more important to Americans than environmental concerns are. Some health-minded people also point out that plant-based meats still contain a fair amount of saturated fat and sodium, so they're not necessarily healthier than regular meat. Whatever their motivation, those so inclined can have their \"beef\" and love it, too.\n\nJason Lee/Reuters\n\n4. Trade War Without End\n\nThe Trump administration is imposing more import taxes on China starting Sunday.\n\nMatt Peterson is the editor of The Masthead.\n\nThe trade war has never fit neatly into partisan boxes. Many Republicans and key congressional Democrats have supported the president\u2019s China tariffs because they think of China as a problem that needs solving. The trade warriors may not love everything the president does\u2014\u201cWe will need to refine tactics,\u201d Marco Rubio tweeted this week\u2014but they broadly agree that something needs doing.", "description": "Atlantic writers look ahead at their beats.", "authors": ["Annie Lowrey", "Hannah Giorgis", "Olga Khazan", "Ian Bogost", "Matt Peterson"], "top_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2019/08/RTSS2TY/facebook.jpg?1567190643"}
