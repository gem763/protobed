They seem to contain a lot of it and they retain it for a long time. We don\u2019t know whether they\u2019re predated on and whether that high dose is passed on to other animals,\u201d said Dr McGoran.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

He chased the mother, then seized the calf in his huge gape, clearly intent on killingit. After trying to drown it, he tried to crush it to death. All the while, the distraught mother looked on. Infanticide among hippos is rare but may result from the stress caused through overcrowding when their day-resting pools dry out. Amale may also increase his reproductive chances by killing young that are not his, triggering females to go into oestrus, ready to mate with him. Male hippos are also aggressively territorial, and brutal fights are not uncommon.

Its glazed eyes showed it was dead, and the three antennae-like projections growing out of its thorax were the ripe fruiting bodies of a \u2018zombie fungus\u2019.

Millions of plastic microfibres are shed every time we wash clothes that contain materials such as nylon, polyester and acrylic.\n\nOne of the biggest polluters in the Thames is wet wipes and sanitary products, which are often flushed down toilets. These are blocking sewage systems and are a huge issue both for the environment and also for water systems, Dr McGoran said.\n\nPlastic has been found throughout the world\u2019s seas, with pieces showing up everywhere from Arctic sea ice to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the deepest trench in the world. Often its harmful effects are obvious, particularly when whales die after choking on plastic bags or turtles become tangled in discarded fishing nets.\n\nPlastics also contain a range of potentially toxic chemicals, including additives used in their manufacture and substances that they absorb from the environment.\n\nThe impact of these chemicals leaching into the surrounding water is not well understood, although some previous work published in Biology Letters has suggested they can disrupt the growth of animal embryos.\n\nAccording to government figures, approximately 4.7 billion plastic straws, 316 million plastic stirrers and 1.8 billion plastic-stemmed cotton buds are used in England every year.", "description": "Crabs in the river Thames are ingesting \u201cshocking\u201d amounts of plastic with in excess of 100 synthetic fibres in some crustaceans, according to researchers.\u00a0 Almost all of the 55 shore crabs and 37 mitten crabs dissected by experts had plastic inside their stomachs, intestine or gills.\u00a0 Speaking at New Scientist Live, Alexandra McGoran from London\u2019s Natural History Museum said", "authors": ["Phoebe Weston"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/10/14/12/istock-501668332.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
