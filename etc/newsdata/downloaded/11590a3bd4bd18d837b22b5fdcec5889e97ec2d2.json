That makes it a bit clearer to be able to map out how you go about that. I expect it to be a little bit smoother. Obviously, with form and injury, the person can change,\u201d Finch said.\n\n\u201cBut the 14 guys we have got here, that\u2019s the plan to move forward with. Over the next 12 months and leading up to that World Cup to have that solid base of 14-16 players that can take us into that tournament.\u201d\n\nFinch\u2019s men lost to eventual champions England in the semi-finals of the 50-over World Cup earlier this year.\n\nThe T20 World Cup is the only piece of major silverware missing in Australia\u2019s bursting trophy cabinet and they have scheduled plenty of matches in the shortest format before next year\u2019s tournament.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just a bit of a change of mind-set of balancing up our team,\u201d Finch said. \u201cAll in all, we want to win as many games as we can and create a style and culture around the group of winning T20Is,\u201d he added.\n\nThe series will also give Australian fans the chance to see former captain Steve Smith and David Warner in action in an international match at home since their bans for ball-tampering.\n\nSmith was also suspended from Australian captaincy for two years, but the ban ends at the end of March. He was the leader for Australia in all three formats during the events of Cape Town last year.\n\nTim Paine was handed Australia\u2019s Test captaincy, while the mantle in the shorter formats went to Finch.\n\n\u201cNot on my radar at all,\u201d Smith said when asked if he was considering returning to captain the side again. \u201cFinchy and Painey are both doing terrific jobs so I\u2019m enjoying playing and pretty chilled.\u201d\n\nComments\n\ncomments", "description": "Australia\u2019s limited-overs captain Aaron Finch craves for continuity in team selection ahead of next year\u2019s Twenty20 World Cup at home as they prepare the blueprint for success with three-match series against Sri Lanka and Pakistan from Sunday.", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://arysports.tv/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Finch.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
