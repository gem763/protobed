They may be 60,000 disgruntled fans, enraged not just by your very existence in their world but your audacity to continue doing so, and you may just be one under-performing defensive midfielder, but, right now, this is your hill and you're going to die on it.\n\nIt was Granit Xhaka\u2019s pride that overshadowed Arsenal\u2019s deeply disappointing 2-2 draw with Crystal Palace and inherited William Gallas\u2019 cursed legacy in the process.\n\nWith a two-goal cushion relinquished, a howl of snide cheers greeted the captain\u2019s substitution on the hour mark. As the cheers turned to something altogether more sinister, Xhaka elected not to stand idly by, choosing instead to wave his arms, to beckon on the mob. You see once you\u2019ve already sped halfway down the road to perdition, you might as well roll down the windows and let the breeze hit you with everything its got.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

We are here because we have supporters. In football we are the workers inside [the pitch], but we play for them. We need to have respect for them when they are applauding us and also when they are criticising us.\u201d All true, of course, but slightly tinged coming from a manager only too happy to accept a human shield to put between himself and those howling for his own head.\n\nAnd so, after a relatively positive start to the season, Arsenal are mired by a familiar chaos. Lucas Torreira teared up on the touchline and had to be consoled by Hector Bellerin. Alexandre Lacazette \u2018liked\u2019 an Instagram post saying Xhaka can \u201cgo f**k himself\u201d and Emery should be sacked; Mesut Ozil is launching a PR offensive against the club, who\u2019ve responded by insisting the decision to ostracise their highest-paid player has united backing from the hierarchy; all played out in front of a fractured crowd baying for the next round of bloodletting. Even the classiness, that famed old mystique installed by Arsene Wenger, has now been traded in for a modern day account of Lord of the Flies, as written by Arsenal Fan TV.\n\nIn Ozil\u2019s absence, Xhaka has become the scapegoat; inheriting that particular nasty cross to bear from the likes of Theo Walcott and Shkodran Mustafi before him. Some resent him for being the captain, others simply because he is a symbol of a disjointed playing philosophy and is prone to the most clumsy of errors with a habit of not always facing up to them.\n\nHis presence in the starting eleven has been divisive, but that responsibility is actually a result of Emery\u2019s own dithering indecision around the armband and the consequent compulsion to pick a player anointed by his teammates, rather than risk losing a fragile dressing room by consigning a below-par player to the bench.\n\nXhaka\u2019s response was ugly and ill-considered, a product of weeks of discontent that finally reached a tipping point. To the majority of Arsenal fans, it was inexcusable and unforgivable. But when a player is made to walk like a sacrificial lamb, it can only be so long before they either implode or explode. In this case, it felt like we might have seen both.\n\nThe sight of a crowd turning on one of its own in a display of such mobbishness was equally as gruesome. And, for a few minutes, the aftershock seemed to suspend the stadium, half in anger, half in guilt, and the lack of any middle ground felt eerily symptomatic of a club swaying from one extreme to another.\n\nNow Emery\u2019s patched-up Arsenal head to Liverpool for a Carabao Cup tie that threatens ritual humiliation and red and white sleeved roadkill. Then the in-form Wolves and Leicester await to tuck into whatever remains.\n\nBut what is clear is that, as some supporters celebrate Xhaka\u2019s purgation, the pride of a wounded captain is far from the reason why Arsenal continue to fight a losing battle, and it\u2019s hard to find any glory in the sacrifice.", "description": "The problem is that, when a stadium turns into an exorcism, ushering you out in a seance of boos, pride leaves you with little choice but to defend yourself.
