It is nothing new and it has always failed.\"\n\nBERNIE SANDERS SLAMS ELIZABETH WARREN AS 'CAPITALIST'\n\nPointing to the former Soviet Union, Cuba and Venezuela, Bruce said socialism has a track record of failure, but that history does not faze its current proponents.\n\n\"They're still addicted to this notion that they're better than us, that they're the ones who can make the decisions that we can't -- that we're too dumb to know that we can't trust ourselves,\" she said.\n\nOn Sunday, self-proclaimed democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., brought up the topic when discussing progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. -- a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate like himself.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cThere are differences between Elizabeth and myself,\u201d Sanders said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cElizabeth I think, as you know, has said that she is a capitalist through her bones. I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\nThe comments come amid a rise in socialism in the Democratic Party, as candidates become more willing to openly embrace socialism over capitalism. It also follows polling showing that Democrats now view socialism more positively than they do capitalism.\n\nLast year, when asked if she was a capitalist, Warren reportedly said, \"I am a capitalist to my bones.\"\n\nFox News' Alex Pappas contributed to this report.", "description": "Tammy Bruce ripped\u00a0socialist political systems, claiming policies like the Green New Deal and Medicare-for-All show distrust for the American people to make their own personal decisions.", "authors": ["Charles Creitz"], "top_image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2019/10/Tammy-Bruce-GettyImages-1072888882.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
