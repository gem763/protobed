Anything that will reduce the thermal burden on, in particular, batsmen bowlers, wicket keepers, is likely to help them maintain their performance.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

Performances will deteriorate. Anyone who\u2019s ever tried to do anything while they\u2019re overheating will realise the motivation to do stuff - the ability to think while you\u2019re doing it and the performance level you achieve, is diminished, and as a consequence the spectacle of cricket will be diminished as well.\u201d\n\nIn 2017 England Captain Joe Root was forced to retire from a match in Sydney due to dehydration after temperatures climbed higher than 43C.\n\nThe report, published earlier this week, details how how batsmen and wicketkeepers are becoming increasingly susceptible to poorer performance as heatwaves continue to turn more extreme and frequent in cricket-playing nations.\n\nThe authors\u2019 core recommendations were that more games may need to be postponed or rearranged to cooler times of the day, as the world warms.\n\nProfessor Piers Forster, a climate change expert at Leeds University\u2019s Priestly Centre for Climate, who also worked on the report, said wearing shorts would send a strong message about climate change.\n\nHe told The Independent: \u201cWearing shorts is a change I would like to see. It will help fast bowlers and be a visible sign that the sport is taking climate change seriously. The resulting public debate would also focus the minds of the fans. Climate change is not going away and we need to all up our games to both achieve net zero emissions and to live and work in a warmer world.\u201d\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

For every player suffering, there are many more fans having to work and go about their daily lives in these increasingly harsh conditions. Sportspeople are not by nature bystanders and we can and must react to avoid the crises approaching us.
