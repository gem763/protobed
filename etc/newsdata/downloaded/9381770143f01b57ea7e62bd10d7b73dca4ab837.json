His closest rival, Elizabeth Warren, slipped in with little fanfare, delivered her speech and hit a brief selfie line before departing the show.\n\nTheir approaches to the steak fry were as divergent as their views on the role of government. But Warren and Biden increasingly face the same challenge: the pressure of success.\n\nThey\u2019re entering a critical phase of the Iowa campaign in a close race for first place. For Warren, it\u2019s a sign that the investments she\u2019s made in staff and personal interactions with voters have paid off. But it also means she\u2019ll increasingly be the subject of attacks from her rivals who want to blunt her rise. For Biden, months of attacks have done little to erode his standing among Democrats. But Warren\u2019s strength underscores his weaknesses among progressive voters, ensuring he won\u2019t be able to coast to success in Iowa or any of the other early voting states.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of precedent for candidates doing well in Iowa the summer before the caucuses only to fade when voting nears. With the caucuses just over four months away, more than a dozen other candidates are increasingly desperate to do whatever they can to overtake Biden and Warren. The dynamics suggest a volatile period ahead as Democrats begin to more seriously grapple with who they want to take on President Donald Trump next fall.\n\n\u201cAnything can happen,\u201d said J. Ann Selzer, the longtime director of the Iowa Poll, produced by The Des Moines Register and its partners.\n\nSelzer managed a poll released Saturday by The Des Moines Register, CNN and Mediacom, which found Warren running about even with Biden, who led their last poll in June. The survey showed more than 60% of likely Democratic caucusgoers could still change their minds on who to support.\n\nA number of lower-tier candidates who\u2019ve staked their candidacies on Iowa cite that large chunk of undecided voters as evidence they still have a shot, even as their campaigns stall.\n\nSen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, who boasts the most Iowa endorsements and a strong campaign team, warned supporters he\u2019d have to raise big money fast or drop out. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has staked her campaign on the idea that her Midwestern roots would endear her to Iowans, but she\u2019s stuck in low single digits despite frequent trips to the state. And former Texas Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, who drew mobs of supporters to small Iowa towns when he launched his bid, is now campaigning beyond the early primary states in search of a win.\n\nSome candidates are rethinking their Iowa strategies to better position themselves for a strong caucus showing.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who once seemed like Biden\u2019s biggest foe, parted ways with his Iowa political director in recent weeks. California Sen. Kamala Harris seemed mildly chagrined to have to dig out her cold-weather gear as she committed, jokingly, to \u201cmoving to Iowa\u201d in order to resuscitate a campaign stuck squarely in the middle of the pack.\n\nHarris has pledged to double her staff in the state and campaign in Iowa every week in October. And South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has been investing heavily in his Iowa operation and will, by the end of this month, nearly match Biden in staff numbers and field office openings.\n\nNot only did he have more than 1,000 supporters at the event, he invited more than two dozen donors in hopes of demonstrating he can win in a class of rivals with much higher national profiles. Buttigieg advisers met in Des Moines with donors Saturday evening to discuss his recent organizational surge to increase staff to 100 paid workers and 20 offices statewide, putting him on par with Warren.\n\n\u201cYou need to be in the hunt. You need to have the resources to compete,\u201d said Buttigieg, who raised a record $25 million in the second quarter and is expected to be competitive in the third quarter, which comes to a close next week.\n\nBiden\u2019s allies remain adamant that what Democratic primary voters most want is someone who can beat Trump, and that Biden is seen as the safest bet to do so. But some voters say as Biden has faced scrutiny for his past policy positions \u2013 and racked up repeated gaffes \u2013 that veneer of electability is showing cracks.\n\n\u201cI just wonder if he has what it takes anymore,\u201d said 50-year-old Frank Hansen of Des Moines. \u201cI think it has to be someone younger and ready to take on the future.\u201d\n\nHansen\u2019s wife, Holly, 51, attended this weekend\u2019s Steak Fry. Echoing her husband, she said, \u201cJoe Biden was the person seen as the strongest one. I\u2019m not so sure now.\u201d\n\nThe couple said they were looking to a newer class of candidates, including Buttigieg, O\u2019Rourke and Warren, who, despite being 70, \u201cjust seems new and fresh,\u201d Holly said.\n\nIowa political history holds warnings for Warren as well, after previous candidates peaked too early and weren\u2019t able to sustain their momentum through caucus night.\n\nIn the late summer of 2003, Howard Dean was the Iowa frontrunner; he eventually fell to John Kerry after being tagged as angry and unprepared for a national race. In the fall of 2007, Hillary Clinton still led in the polls, but eventually faced an upset to then-Sen. Barack Obama after he criticized her as running a too-careful campaign.\n\nIndeed, this week Warren\u2019s opponents stepped up their attacks against her, with Biden knocking her on raising taxes to pay for a single-payer health care system, while Buttigieg called her \u201cevasive\u201d about the tax issue.\n\nWarren has, however, stayed staunchly on-message, insisting when pressed by reporters this week in Iowa only that \u201ccosts will go down\u201d for the middle class if her health care plan is passed. Her response has been much like the campaign she\u2019s run in Iowa \u2013 steady and focused, with little fanfare and an eye on the end goal rather than the day-to-day fluctuations in the field.\n\nShe shrugged off questions about her strength in Iowa on Sunday.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t do polls,\u201d she said as she joined a protest with striking United Auto Workers members. \u201cWe are still months away from the Iowa caucuses and the first primary elections.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "They're entering a critical phase of the Iowa campaign in a close race for first place.
