Chart: Nationwide More\n\n\u201cSolid labour market conditions and low borrowing costs appear to be offsetting the drag from the uncertain economic outlook The question is whether this pattern will continue,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere were tentative signs of a softening in the jobs market in the three months to August, as employment fell, unemployment rose, and wage growth slowed a little.\n\n\u201cHowever, monthly data is often volatile and the unemployment rate remains close to 40 year lows and real earnings growth (i.e. after taking account of inflation) is close to levels prevailing before the financial crisis.\n\nREAD MORE: How no-deal Brexit could wipe out \u2018generation\u2019 of farmers and hit cheese prices\n\n\u201cMoreover, mortgage rates remain close to all-time lows \u2013 more than 95% of borrowers have opted for fixed rate deals in recent quarters, around half of which have opted to fix for five years.\u201d\n\nGardner said potential UK interest rate rises in the years ahead were \u201clikely to be capped\u201d by global trends, with weak growth around the world sustaining downward pressure on rates.\n\nSamuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said falling rates could push up price growth.\n\n\"Past precedent suggests that the majority of the decline in mortgage rates will feed through to higher prices, not lower interest payments. Accordingly, we expect house prices to rise at a slightly faster pace next year,\" said Tombs.\n\nREAD MORE: London prices are falling - but still 50% higher than a decade ago\n\nJeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and former residential chairman of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, said the figures suggested no \u201cfireworks in the market\u201d were visible or likely over the next few months.\n\n'What we are seeing on the ground is a continuing determination to find common price ground between buyer and seller, which is reflected in no real change to these steady transaction numbers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt, as far as we are concerned, that pent-up demand remains just waiting for the Brexit gun to fire before releasing what we expect to be a modest improvement in prices and activity.\u201d", "description": "One expert said there was pent-up demand, with many buyers and sellers 'just waiting for the Brexit gun to fire.'", "authors": ["Tom Belger", "Finance", "Policy Reporter"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Z7VKZUx.moIOHJPcP96KWA--~B/aD0yNjg1O3c9NDAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-08/7741a890-ba81-11e9-baef-89b61a822c1d", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
