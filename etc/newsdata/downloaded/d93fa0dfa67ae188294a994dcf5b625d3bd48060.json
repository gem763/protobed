Gastelum ended up facing Adesanya two months later at UFC 236 for the interim title, but fell just short in a classic battle.\n\nAdesanya was then able to unify the middleweight title in a near-flawless performance over Whittaker, and Gastelum, who took Adesanya to the brink, couldn\u2019t help but criticize Whittaker\u2019s performance.\n\nAnd Whittaker is not the least bit surprised.\n\n\u201cNah, I\u2019m not surprised,\u201d Whittaker said in an interview with Submission Radio. \u201cThe game and the culture around it, is everyone just wants to (expletive) on each other. And yeah, it\u2019s sad. It\u2019s sad that people have to try and (expletive) on each other to move up in the world. Like, I think I\u2019ve shown, you don\u2019t have to do that. But maybe he would have. We\u2019ll see. We\u2019re still quite young, both me and him, and I\u2019m sure our paths will cross.\u201d\n\nGastelum is scheduled to take on Darren Till in the co-main event of UFC 244, in a fight where Whittaker could likely face the winner.\n\nSo he\u2019ll definitely be keeping an eye out on Nov. 2, and despite the recent comments, is giving the edge to Gastelum.\n\n\u201cYeah, certainly I\u2019m gonna be watching it closely, cause they\u2019re very likely opponents in the future,\u201d Whittaker said. \u201cBut I would have to say, I would have to lean towards Gastelum, because I think he\u2019s a super underrated fighter in the middleweight division. But he\u2019s very sneaky in his approach to closing the distance and his approach in landing the strikes. He\u2019s quite quick. We\u2019ll have to see how Till makes the transition to middleweight. That\u2019s always a big question mark for me, watching guys jump up. So, I\u2019ll have to lean towards Gastelum at this point.\u201d", "description": "Robert Whittaker is not surprised with Kelvin Gastelum criticizing his last performance vs. Israel Adesanya.", "authors": ["Farah Hannoun", "Nolan King", "Simon Samano", "The Blue Corner", "Matt Erickson", "Mmajunkie Staff", "Mike Bohn"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/robert-whittaker-kelvin-gastelum-ufc-234-weigh-ins.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-25"}
