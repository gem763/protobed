It has made the quarterfinals at every World Cup.\n\nThat pool-stage record was in major danger when Fiji winger Josua Tuisova rampaged down the right wing in the early exchanges, bursting through one tackle and fending off another, to set up the try for flanker Yato.\n\nThat score added to a penalty by flyhalf Ben Volavola and gave Fiji a surprise 8-0 lead at the Sapporo Dome.\n\nAustralia recovered momentarily when Hooper drove over in the 18th and Christian Leali\u2019ifano converted for 8-7.\n\nVolavola kicked two more penalties but Hodge added a second try for Australia five minutes before halftime.\n\nFiji\u2019s powerful runners were bursting through tackles and knocking the Australians defense, and Australia was making error after error under the pressure.\n\nAlthough the momentum appeared to start shifting toward Australia by the end of the first half, Nayacalevu\u2019s try two minutes into the second lifted Fiji again.\n\nHe scooped up a dropped pass by Leali\u2019ifano, pushed the flyhalf away, and scampered half the length of the field to score between the posts.\n\nAustralia found more success in the tight exchanges and the rolling mauls, when Latu scored both his tries in the right corner, and took control of the game when Fiji had a player in the sin-bin late in the second half.\n\nThose gave the Wallabies enough breathing space to spread the ball a little wider, setting up late tries for center Kerevi and wing Koroibete.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Rugby World Cup: https://www.apnews.com/RugbyWorldCup and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Australia avoided the first big upset of the Rugby World Cup when it rallied from 21-12 down to beat Fiji 39-21 on Saturday.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Gerald Imray"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/21/japan_rugby_wcup_australia_fiji_76499_c0-101-2428-1516_s1770x1032.jpg?a81960d2604dbe2cd9119cf49f978e42b041fe0f", "published_at": "2019-09-21"}
