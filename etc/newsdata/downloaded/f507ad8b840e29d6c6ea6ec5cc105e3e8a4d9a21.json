REUTERS/Matthew Tostevin/File Photo\n\nThe policy committee is \u201cvery concerned\u201d about the strength of the baht and will further relax rules on capital outflows within 1-2 months, Bank of Thailand Governor Veerathai Santiprabhob told reporters and analysts.\n\nThai investors would be allowed to invest more abroad and exporters to keep foreign currencies overseas for longer, the governor had told Reuters in an interview last week. Exporters are now allowed to keep funds abroad for a year.\n\nThe BOT will ensure gold trading flows will not affect foreign exchange rates, given large gold investments in Thailand, Veerathai said. The governor was speaking at an analyst meeting held at the central bank.\n\nGold exporters may not need to rush to bring in foreign currencies, he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not a ban on gold trading\u201d.\n\nThere are plans to reduce the country\u2019s large current account surplus via cooperation with state agencies to speed up investment in infrastructure projects as planned, which will also help the country\u2019s economic restructuring, he said.\n\nIn January-August, Thailand\u2019s current account surplus totaled $25 billion and is expected to reach $34 billion this year, or 6.3% of gross domestic product (GDP), compared with last year\u2019s 11.5% of GDP, Veerathai said.\n\n(GRAPHIC: Thai Policy interest rate, GDP and CPI - here)\n\nHOW LOW CAN RATE GO?\n\nThe baht is Asia\u2019s best performing currency so far this year, up 7.5% against the dollar, driven by Thailand\u2019s hefty current account surplus and foreign fund inflows.\n\nThe baht\u2019s strength has affected exporters and tourism but the BOT will closely monitor the currency to prevent it from rising too fast, Veerathai said.\n\nThe BOT left its policy rate THCBIR=ECI unchanged at 1.50% last month, after August\u2019s surprise cut. But it downgraded its 2019 GDP growth forecast to 2.8% from 3.3%. Last year\u2019s growth was 4.1%\n\nSoutheast Asia\u2019s second-largest is not in a \u201crecession or crisis\u201d, Veerathai said, saying Thailand did not have to cut rates as many times as other countries because its policy rate was almost the lowest among emerging markets and it did not have problems with its external position.\n\nHowever, deputy central bank governor Mathee Supapongse said the BOT was still able to make use of existing policy space if needed, and monetary policy is still data-dependent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessary that the policy rate can\u2019t go lower than 1.25%, which is the record low,\u201d he said. \u201cThe 1.25% is not a magic number\u201d.\n\nThe BOT will next review monetary policy on Nov. 6.", "description": "Thailand is not in recession but growing below potential and the central bank is ready to take action if needed, while there are also plans for further measures to curb the baht's strength, central bank and government officials said on Thursday.", "authors": ["Kitiphong Thaichareon", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191010&t=2&i=1439104918&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9906R", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
