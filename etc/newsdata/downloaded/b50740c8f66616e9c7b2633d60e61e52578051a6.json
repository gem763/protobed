He stopped short of assigning blame, but the vessel was sailing near the Saudi port of Jeddah at the time of the attack.\n\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a terrorist move, nor was it carried out by an individual. It was carried out by a government,\u201d Rouhani said, adding that officials were also assessing rocket fragments.\n\nIranian Oil Tanker Attacked as Middle East Tensions Remain High\n\nThe Gulf has seen a surge in tit-for-tat attacks on oil facilities, drones and shipping traffic since Donald Trump\u2019s administration tightened sanctions on Iran\u2019s oil exports earlier this year. The measures are part of Trump\u2019s \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d policy aimed at forcing Iran to curb its ballistic missile program and support for proxy militia around the Middle East, but have been met with defiance by the Iranian government, which has, instead, rolled back its own compliance with the nuclear accord.\n\nAlthough all sides have said they want to avoid war, repeated incidents pose a growing risk to supplies from the world\u2019s most important oil-producing region.\n\nThe attack on the Sabiti tanker came weeks after a drone strike on a major Saudi oil facility which the kingdom blamed on Iran. Iranian officials have said they weren\u2019t involved in the attack, which rattled global oil markets, and was claimed by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.", "description": "Iran\u2019s Rouhani Vows Response to Oil Tanker Attack", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/picf75e7667a0aa649d1f355e37d8ade23c.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
