Additionally, he claims he suspects Agrizzi stole millions from the company.\n\nThese claims summarise the gist of the counter-narrative to Agrizzi\u2019s bombshell testimony at the state capture commission. Sources, some of them close to the Watson family, paint a completely different picture of the goings-on at Bosasa and question the motives of Agrizzi and some of his fellow whistle-blowers.\n\n\u201cThe Bosasa state capture story is all smoke and mirrors. This is, in fact, one of the greatest cases of industrial espionage ever. It is a case of insider capture, not state capture,\u201d says one insider who chose to remain anonymous. The source spent years in the senior ranks at Bosasa, and describes Agrizzi as \u201cvindictive and a schoolyard bully\u201d.\n\nAt least one witness who testified under oath at the commission appeared to share these sentiments. Peet Venter, the former accountant and auditor for the group, stated that Agrizzi wanted Bosasa, now trading as African Global Group (AGG), to surrender a large part of its business to a grouping that included Agrizzi and fellow senior employees Andries van Tonder, Leon van Tonder and Frans Vorster.\n\nWhen this did not happen, they \u201cplanned to take Bosasa/AGG and Gavin Watson down\u201d.\n\nVenter stated that he had been called to Agrizzi\u2019s house in November 2017, where he met with Agrizzi and Andries van Tonder.\n\n\u201cIt was clear that Mr Agrizzi wanted to destroy Mr Watson. I was told I had to type a statement to reveal the illegal activities of Mr Watson and that they would assist me in doing so.\u201d\n\nRead: Bosasa boss, state capture mastermind: Just who was Gavin Watson?\n\nVenter said he signed a statement \u2013 that he alleged was initially prepared by him but completed and edited by Agrizzi \u2013 because he was scared. Venter stated in his affidavit that he received many threats about his career from Agrizzi in November and December 2017.\n\nThese were allegedly made in an attempt to intimidate and blackmail him into signing the statement.\n\n\u201cMr Agrizzi used Telegram [Messenger] messages [an electronic messaging platform] with a very short self-destruct timer [the messages would disappear in seconds]. I cannot recall the exact wording, but it was something like \u2018you better make the right decision otherwise you will go down with Watson\u2019.\u201d\n\nIn December 2017, Venter again met with the two men at a restaurant close to Lanseria Airport north of Johannesburg.\n\n\u201cMr Agrizzi showed me a flowchart indicating his step-by-step action plan ... to take over some of the contracts from Bosasa, or alternatively how he will sabotage Bosasa. Mr Agrizzi made various changes to the first affidavit [statement] that I had initially prepared. I signed the affidavit under duress. Mr Agrizzi then became upset with the fact that I had walked away from him and he started blackmailing me. The final blow was when Mr Agrizzi released a copy of my unsigned and later my signed affidavit. A copy of the unsigned affidavit was sent to my then employer in August 2018. I was immediately suspended and later resigned.\u201d\n\nThese comments were made in a second affidavit that Venter had submitted to the commission.\n\nHis initial affidavit had been submitted earlier by Agrizzi as part of his collection of evidence. In the appendices to Venter\u2019s second affidavit, he included the flowchart plans he had allegedly been shown by Agrizzi in December 2017.\n\nIt appears to detail a plan targeting Bosasa.\n\nAt the top of one page is a box with the words \u201cnegotiations 15 December 2017\u201d. The flow splits into two streams, \u201cSuccessful\u201d and \u201cUnsuccessful\u201d.\n\nUnder the heading \u201cUnsuccessful\u201d there are several \u201ctriggers\u201d, including \u201csocial media\u201d, \u201cbanks\u201d, \u201cauditors\u201d and \u201cpoliticians\u201d, with an extra label stating \u201copposition parties\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe documents further include a detailed media plan, which proposed having a news article published each week for 14 weeks, as well as planned leaks to Carte Blanche, AfriForum, Corruption Watch, the EFF and the DA.\n\nSome of the Bosasa-related information to be leaked appears to relate to bribes and pay-offs, tax issues and other fraudulent activities.\n\nAccording to Venter, these documents were prepared at least as early as December 2017 and the issues raised in them correlate with the revelations that Agrizzi, Van Tonder and Vorster made to the commission in 2019.\n\nThe end goal, judging by the documents, seems to be a criminal investigation of matters including racketeering, collusion and bribery.\n\nUnder another title, \u201cRamifications\u201d, it is suggested that the directorate of Bosasa/AGG, including Watson, could be sequestrated, blacklisted, receive a criminal record and have limited future employment prospects.\n\nIt reads as if a massive takedown of the company and its senior directors was on the cards.\n\nA recording that appears to substantiate the existence of a plot to take over Bosasa from Watson also exists.\n\nIn response to a long list of questions and requests for comment, the Watson family were largely unavailable and unresponsive, with two exceptions.\n\nIn May 2019, Watson\u2019s daughter Lindsay, who was also head of legal services at the Bosasa group, said the following: \u201cThank you for your questions, we have unfortunately been advised not to answer any questions at this stage.\u201d\n\nAnother Watson family member, who does not want to be identified, stated the family had nothing to add and saw no point in making public comments on the matters being aired.\n\n\u201cThe ship has sailed, the horse has bolted. It matters not what the family says or Gavin Watson says, even if it is all denials. The public and the media\u2019s minds are made up. Obviously, at first a number of people wanted to respond to Agrizzi\u2019s evidence to the commission, knowing full well he was lying and to protect the company and the 4 500 employees, but sadly there was no value in responding. The rules of the commission dictate that anyone [to be] mentioned in the commission should be given two weeks\u2019 notice to respond, however, this was not afforded to anyone [at Bosasa]. Because of this, no one would have been able to respond immediately to Agrizzi. One would have to submit an affidavit to the commission and then wait and see if the commission would allow you to appear. The first time anyone [in the Watson family] knew of Agrizzi approaching the commission was when we saw him on TV,\u201d the family member said.\n\n\u201cThe family was never informed that their names were going to be mentioned and never given an opportunity to appear before the inquiry. One or two members of the family and other affected parties, including Kevin Wakeford, have submitted detailed affidavits to the commission. They have not been called to testify or appear, yet Agrizzi has been called to testify twice.\u201d\n\nThe family member continued: \u201cThe immediate effect [of Agrizzi\u2019s testimony] was the banks closed the business accounts. No bank would accept Bosasa/[AGG] as a client and a business cannot survive without a bank. You cannot pay suppliers or salaries and wages, and you cannot accept payments from clients. Effectively, you do not have to liquidate because you are insolvent, you have to liquidate so that you can get access to another bank account again. And if you move into voluntary liquidation, then all your clients have a right to cancel all their contracts with you. So, effectively, a business is destroyed in a matter of days while the commission may only give you an opportunity to appear before it months down the line. Within days, Bosasa had already been found guilty in a trial by media. It was effectively over.\u201d\n\n\n\nAgrizzi responds\n\nIn the book The Bosasa Billions, Agrizzi is quoted as laughing off the allegation that he had wanted to take over the business.\n\n\u201cWith R250 million of tax fraud there? It is unsaveable,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked to elaborate on this claim, Agrizzi said that Bosasa had a growing tax headache for years.\n\n\u201cTax losses were moved around the business [in a way] which one cannot do. So the hole is quite big at the moment.\u201d", "description": "In the week that Bosasa head Gavin Watson died in a car crash, a new book by James-Brent Styan and Paul Vecchiatto recounts Angelo Agrizzi\u2019s corruption allegations against his former boss.", "authors": ["James-Brent Styan", "Paul Vecchiatto"], "top_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/9185/f02d7985293645abac32f6a5332fbd52.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-01"}
