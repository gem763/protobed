REUTERS/Ralph Orlowski\n\nBERLIN (Reuters) - Bill McDermott stood down on Friday after a decade building up SAP (SAPG.DE) as the world\u2019s leading enterprise software company, handing the task of completing its transition to cloud computing to new co-CEOs Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein.\n\nSAP announced the management overhaul, with immediate effect, after rushing out third-quarter results that showed it gaining traction in its drive to offer a more streamlined range of services and boost profitability.\n\nThe announcement brings down the curtain on an era in which McDermott struck a string of multi-billion-dollar deals that helped establish SAP as Europe\u2019s pre-eminent technology group but also created complexity that frustrated many clients.\n\n\u201cSAP would not be what it is today without Bill McDermott,\u201d said Hasso Plattner, a co-founder of SAP who chairs the company\u2019s supervisory board.\n\n\u201cBill made invaluable contributions to this company and he was a main driver of SAP\u2019s transition to the cloud, which will fuel our growth for many years to come.\u201d\n\nThe new leadership combines Morgan\u2019s focus on customer relationships in SAP\u2019s North American markets with Klein\u2019s background in process innovation that is rooted in SAP\u2019s German heritage.\n\nPlattner founded the business in the early 1970s together with three former IBM colleagues and continues to exert decisive influence over SAP.
