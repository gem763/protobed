Now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on Saudi Arabia,\u201d he continued, adding: \u201cWe\u2019ll see?\u201d\n\nIranian-backed Houthi rebels have taken credit for the Saturday drone strike at the kingdom\u2019s Abqaiq plant and its Khurais oil field, which disrupted an estimated 5.7 million barrels of the kingdom's crude oil production per day. Tehran has denied responsibility for the attack.\n\nTrump reacted to the attack with furor over the weekend, tweeting Sunday that the U.S. was \u201clocked and loaded\u201d but would wait to discuss a response with the Saudis once they had a better idea of who was behind the attacks.\n\nOfficials in Washington and Tehran have frequently offered conflicting accounts of a number of clashes in the Persian Gulf, including over Iran's downing of a U.S. drone and of a series of explosions on foreign tankers earlier in the summer that the U.S. similarly pointed the finger at Iran for.\n\nAfter Saturday's attacks, Trump officials have released satellite photos of the damage, which they say indicate the attackers approached from the north, where Iran and Iraq are located relative to Saudi Arabia, rather than the south, where Houthi rebels in are based in Yemen, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe interruption of the equivalent of more than 5 percent of the world\u2019s daily oil supply shot crude oil futures higher Sunday evening, and Trump said he\u2019d authorized the release of U.S. strategic petroleum reserves in a \u201cto-be-determined\u201d amount to stabilize oil markets if necessary, but sought to ease concerns of any shortage.\n\nThe attack comes as tensions in the regions have simmered for months as Iran continues to take steps toward breaching the 2015 nuclear deal and amid hopes of a potential meeting between Trump and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani at the U.N. General Assembly later this week.", "description": "The US is \u2018locked and loaded\u2019 to retaliate, Trump said.", "authors": ["Caitlin Oprysko", "Bianca Quilantan", "Ma\u00efa De La Baume"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1174312406-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-16"}
