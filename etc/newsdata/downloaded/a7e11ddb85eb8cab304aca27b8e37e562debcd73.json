The semiconductor firm said its third-quarter operating profit likely fell 56% on a downturn in global memory chip prices, but that was better than what analysts had anticipated.\n\nTaiwan's stock index gained 0.7% to hit five-month highs while Hong Kong shares extended gains after the territory's leader said she had no plans to use the emergency regulation ordinance to introduce other laws.\n\nShanghai shares rose 0.6% after the week-long break, though gains were led mainly by defensive shares ahead of the crucial trade talks.\n\nSpending on retail goods and dining during China's National Day holidays returned to growth this year, offering unexpected respite to an economy that has been expanding at its weakest pace in almost three decades.\n\nStill a private survey showed China's services sector grew at its slowest pace in seven months in September.\n\nOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 lost 0.45% on Monday, unable to sustain gains made after positive tweets and news headlines about the trade talks.\n\nU.S. and Chinese deputy trade negotiators on Monday launched two days of talks aimed at paving the way for the first minister-level negotiations in months on Thursday and Friday.\n\nMere confirmation of the talks from Beijing has helped to improve the mood, or at least triggered text-reading algorithms to react by buying stocks and the yuan, said some market players.\n\n\"There are vague hopes on the upcoming talks. Trump must be yearning for a deal as his re-election prospects could be hurt if the economy keeps deteriorating,\" said Yukino Yamada, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities.\n\nBut prospects for progress in U.S.-China trade talks dimmed after Washington blacklisted Chinese companies over Beijing's treatment of predominantly Muslim ethnic minorities.\n\nAmong those blacklisted, trading in video surveillance company Hikvision was suspended while voice recognition front-runner IFLYTEK Co fell as much as 3.1%.\n\nTrump also said he hoped China found a humane and peaceful resolution to political protests in Hong Kong, and warned the situation had the potential to hurt trade talks.\n\nThe talks are getting underway ahead of a scheduled increase in U.S. tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, to 30% from 25% on Oct. 15.\n\n\"Since tariffs have been hurting trade, people are hoping Trump may postpone some of the upcoming tariffs. Nevertheless, you can't ignore that fact that, up until now, the market has underestimated Trump's determination on tariffs,\" Daiwa's Yamada said.\n\nTrump has said the tariff increase will take effect if no progress is made in the negotiations.\n\n\"This ongoing trade-war discussion is a much more secular theme rather than something that is going to be resolved in the next couple of days,\" said Maurice Meijers, a fixed-income portfolio manager at Dutch fund manager Robeco in Singapore.\n\nMeijers said he doesn't expect a sudden massive breakthrough that would give markets reason to rally. \"That's very unlikely, I'll expect this to be an ongoing theme.\"\n\nIn the currency market, the Turkish lira steadied after declining more than 2% on Monday over concerns about Ankara's planned incursion in northern Syria.\n\nTrump threatened to destroy Turkey's economy if Ankara takes a planned military strike in Syria too far even though the U.S. leader himself has opened the door for a Turkish incursion by his decision to withdraw U.S. troop from the area.", "description": "Asian shares inched up on Tuesday, with Chinese shares making decent gains after a week-long holiday, though investors remained cautious over U.S.-China trade talks after President Donald Trump said a quick deal was unlikely.
