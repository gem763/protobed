Gen Z and millennials surveyed were \u201cmuch more likely to report communism being presented favorably in elementary/middle/high school and college\u201d than those in Generation X, the Baby Boom and the Silent Generation.\n\n\u201cWhen we don\u2019t educate our youngest generations about the historical truth of 100 million victims murdered at the hands of communist regimes over the past century, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised at their willingness to embrace Marxist ideas,\u201d Ms. Smith said in a statement. \u201cWe need to redouble our efforts to educate America\u2019s youth about the history of communist regimes and the dangers of socialism today.\u201d\n\nHalf of all Millennials and Generation Z have an unfavorable view of capitalism, and one quarter of Americans believe @realDonaldTrump is a greater threat to world peace than Putin or Kim Jong-un.
