(AP) - Daniel Carlson couldn\u2019t make a field goal during his short stint in Minnesota and now he can\u2019t miss since getting a second chance in Oakland.\n\nCarlson returns to Minnesota on Sunday for the first time since the Vikings cut their former fifth-round pick two games into his rookie season and now he\u2019s one of the game\u2019s most accurate kickers.\n\n\u201cEvery kicker\u2019s going to have ups and downs. That\u2019s part of the job,\u201d Carlson said. \u201cSome days you\u2019re going to be the hero and some days not so much. That\u2019s part of it. You grow and hopefully you learn from those experiences. I think I have. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be the last kick I ever miss. Hopefully, I play many, many years.\u201d\n\nThe Vikings expected that to happen in Minnesota after trading up to use a draft pick on a kicker for just the second time in 40 years.\n\nBut Carlson didn\u2019t get much of a chance to prove himself. He made a 48-yard field goal and all three extra points in his Vikings debut but things quickly turned sour from there.\n\nThe next week in Green Bay, Carlson missed field goals of 48, 49 and 35 yards, with the last two failed tries coming in overtime and forcing the Vikings to settle for a 29-29 tie with the rival Packers.\n\nThat led to his release and the time off he spent working on his technique and approach before signing a few weeks later with the Raiders.\n\n\u201cThose were some tough times, getting cut early on in my NFL career, but it\u2019s been fun seeing how it\u2019s all worked out,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m in a great spot here in Oakland. I just want to improve and get better personally.\u201d\n\nCarlson has made 18 of 19 field goals attempts and all 22 extra points since joining Oakland, providing a sense of security for coach Jon Gruden at that crucial position.\n\nCarlson\u2019s biggest moment for the Raiders came last November when he kicked a 35-yard field goal on the final play of a 23-21 win at Arizona.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s an ice man,\u201d Gruden said. \u201cHe\u2019s kicked the ball in clutch situations. He helped us beat Arizona at the buzzer. His kickoffs have really improved, if you\u2019ve seen that. He\u2019s had some touchbacks. Great guy, got a huge upside, big leg, but we really are proud to have him.\u201d\n\nThings have worked out better for Carlson since his release than they have for the Vikings. Minnesota signed veteran Dan Bailey to replace Carlson but that hasn\u2019t gone smoothly.\n\nBailey made just 21 of 28 field goals last season with six of his misses coming from inside 50 yards.\n\nThat prompted the Vikings to trade a fifth-round pick this summer to Baltimore for kicker Kaare Vedvik. That pick proved to be a waste as well with Vedvik getting cut before the start of the season.\n\nBailey retained the job but then missed a field goal and had an extra point blocked after a penalty pushed it back to 48 yards in last week\u2019s 21-16 loss at Green Bay - the same place where Carlson\u2019s tenure in Minnesota ended.\n\nBailey is still building chemistry with new holder Britton Colquitt and hopes to get Minnesota\u2019s long-troublesome kicking situation back on track.\n\n\u201cI feel like we\u2019re really coming along there. I feel like we all have a lot of confidence in each other,\u201d Bailey said, reflecting on his miss against the Packers. \u201cObviously I would like for it to go in, and I wish I could have it back, but that\u2019s the nature of this deal. I felt like I put a good hit on it, so there\u2019s no alarms really going off on this end.\u201d\n\nBailey\u2019s eight missed field goals over the past two seasons are the most in the NFL and Minnesota ranks last in the NFL with a 73.3% accuracy on field goals since letting Carlson go.\n\nAll Carlson has done during that time is make his kicks, tying for the best field goal percentage in the NFL at 94.7% since signing with the Raiders last October.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I\u2019m happy for him,\u201d Vikings coach Mike Zimmer said. \u201cI mean, do I have regrets? I like our kicker who we have now, but did I second guess it? Sure. He\u2019s done great there, and I think he\u2019s a very, very talented kid. I wish him well, just not this week.\u201d\n\nNOTES: The Raiders traded an undisclosed 2020 draft pick to Green Bay for return specialist Trevor Davis. Oakland\u2019s returner, Dwayne Harris, missed a second straight practice with an ankle injury. \u2026 RT Trent Brown also missed practice for the second straight day with a sore knee. \u2026 RB Josh Jacobs (hip) and WR Tyrell Williams (hip) were both limited.\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Daniel Carlson couldn't make a field goal during his short stint in Minnesota and now he can't miss since getting a second chance in Oakland.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Josh Dubow"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/19/raiders_carlson_football_65287_c0-223-2911-1920_s1770x1032.jpg?43bd130bff7a618cd1ee5c6c4ff6d2c18ff807e2", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
