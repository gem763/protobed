These measures include the addition of new search tools on Tarion\u2019s Ontario Builder Directory and a new detailed information sheet highlighting the potential risks of purchasing certain types of pre-construction condominiums. Both initiatives are part of Tarion\u2019s mandate to improve and simplify the new home purchasing process with a focus on informed decision-making.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe purchase of a new home is often the most important one that many Ontarians will make,\u201d said Tarion\u2019s President and CEO Howard Bogach. \u201cAt Tarion, we\u2019re doing our part to ensure that these purchases are informed by a thorough understanding of the risks, builder history, and status of a given project. The initiatives that we\u2019re announcing today will contribute to a better informed purchasing process.\u201d\n\n\n\nEffective January 1, 2020, buyers of residential condominium units will benefit from new rules that require these purchase agreements to include information sheets highlighting the risks and considerations that come with the purchase, including:\n\npre-construction condominiums come with the risk that they may never be completed;\n\nearly termination conditions that would allow a developer to cancel a project;\n\ninformation about the status of the development (e.g., formal zoning approval,relevant approval authority and date of commencement of construction);\n\ninformation about any restrictions on the developer\u2019s land title that may prevent the project from going forward;\n\na purchaser has an initial 10 days under the Condominium Act, 1998 to cancel a sales agreement; and\n\nthe expected date when a purchaser can take occupancy.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, this new information sheet applies to agreements of purchase and sale for units where the purchase agreement for the project or phase of the project is signed after January 1, 2020. Please note that leasehold, common element and vacant land condominiums are excluded from this requirement.\n\n\n\nTarion has also made updates to its Ontario Builder Directory to include information about condo projects and builder history. Beginning today, prospective buyers will be able to search for condo projects by name and/or location and receive important information, including the name of the vendor/builder, the project name, the status of the project and the number of units. They can also see cancelled projects and any builders who have been convicted under the Ontario New Home Warranties Plan Act.\n\n\n\nTo learn more about these and other consumer education and protection initiatives available from Tarion, new home buyers are encouraged to visit Tarion.com\n\n\n\nAbout Tarion\n\nTarion Warranty Corporation is a private, not-for-profit organization established in 1976 to serve as the regulator of new home builders in Ontario and administrator of the new home warranty program.
