I mean just look at Ariel, the red-headed mermaid, from The Little Mermaid who was more than willing to give up her voice for a man. Not to mention how Kiss The Girl, a song about Prince Eric and Ariel\u2019s sexual tension, argues that consent isn\u2019t necessary in the lyrics \u2014 \u201cThere is one way to ask her / It don\u2019t take a word / Not a single word / Go on and kiss the girl.\u201d\n\nBut Disney has also been progressive in many ways, from its new adaptations of movies to how the production company is moving away from Prince Charming-type story lines. Disney has now taken a step further to improve its representation by turning to AI, using \u201cGD-IQ\u201d \u2014 a tool that reviews scripts to spellcheck gender bias.\n\nThe tool was developed by Oscar-winning actress, Geena Davis, the founder of the Davis Institute on Gender in Media, a research-based organization which aims to educate creators and audiences about the importance of eliminating unconscious bias in the entertainment industry. Using AI, Davis\u2019 company created the gender-bias tool called that analyzes scripts to pick up any gender bias, it counts the number of male and female characters and then evaluates whether the breakdown is representative of the actual population.\n\nThe tool, which was developed at the University of Southern California Viterbi School of Engineering, is being used to evaluate how many characters are part of the LGBTQ+ community, how many characters are people of color, how many have disabilities, as well as characters that are part of other minority groups that aren\u2019t frequently represented in film and television.\n\nIn a keynote speech in New Zealand earlier this year, Davis pointed out how this tool wasn\u2019t designed to \u201cshame and blame\u201d screenwriters and filmmakers, but instead it\u2019s to raise awareness of the unconscious bias lying in between the lines of scripts.\n\n\u201cNearly every sector of our society has a huge gender disparity, particularly in leadership positions,\u201d Davis said during her speech. \u201cSo how long is it going to take to correct that, to reach parity? No matter how hard we work, we can\u2019t snap our fingers and suddenly half the corporate boards are women. It\u2019s going to take a long time to make some of these changes.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s a promising step towards diversity in entertainment, this tool shouldn\u2019t have the final say at the end of day around what passes the representation test. Instead, hiring more women, people of color, and those from minority communities would provide a more accurate analysis of how characters like them should be represented to reflect real lives.", "description": "Disney has now taken a step further to improve its representation by turning to AI, using \u201cGD-IQ\u201d \u2014 a tool that reviews scripts to spellcheck gender bias.", "authors": ["Cara Curtis"], "top_image": "https://img-cdn.tnwcdn.com/image/tnw?filter_last=1&fit=1280%2C640&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn0.tnwcdn.com%2Fwp-content%2Fblogs.dir%2F1%2Ffiles%2F2019%2F10%2F200-calories-9.png&signature=44e3a016807b7c7c8eff4c265fb11910", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
