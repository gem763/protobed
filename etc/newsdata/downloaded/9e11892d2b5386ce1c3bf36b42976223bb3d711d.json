Publicly, of course, Ohio\u2019s leading Democrats insist that they can put the state back in their column in 2020. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who considered seeking the nomination, emailed a memo to the media this week extolling the state\u2019s \u201ccrucial role on the national stage,\u201d reciting the state\u2019s history as a bellwether with the not-so-subtle header: \u201cAs Goes Ohio.\u201d\n\nYet in private conversations, Ohio Democrats are less confident about their prospects next year. They acknowledge other states will be more competitive and important to their nominee. However, these same Democrats are quick to add that they may reclaim the state if \u2014 and it\u2019s a big if \u2014 they have the right nominee.\n\nIt is, in other words, the same debate Democrats are having nationally. Except here, in a state that has produced seven presidents and claims paternity over electing even more, it\u2019s personal.\n\nWill Elizabeth Warren finally face challenges tonight?\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren enters the debate with her campaign on the rise. She now rivals Mr. Biden atop national polls, and she raised significantly more money than he did in the past three months (though she narrowly trailed Senator Bernie Sanders for the largest haul in the field). Ms. Warren has offered crisp performances on the debate stage so far this year, and when she answers questions, she is particularly adept at sticking to the messages that animate her campaign \u2014 which revolves around the need for \u201cbig, structural change.\u201d\n\nThere is no reason to expect she will depart from that approach at tonight\u2019s debate. More than ever, though, Ms. Warren stands as a prime target for her rivals, given her strength in the race. She has already been jabbed over her support of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and her refusal to address whether she would raise taxes on the middle class to help finance such a health care system. But going after Ms. Warren, who is highly popular among Democratic voters, is also a dangerous move for other candidates, as voters may not be keen to reward negative attacks within the Democratic field.\n\nExpect optimism and an energetic performance from Bernie Sanders\n\nWhen Senator Bernie Sanders takes the stage tonight, it will have been exactly two weeks since he suffered a heart attack while campaigning in Las Vegas. Since then, he has been recuperating, first at the hospital and then at his home in Burlington, Vt. Beyond brief interviews with reporters, a handful of sit-down interviews with television networks at his home and an appearance by live-stream at a union forum in Iowa, Mr. Sanders has remained out of public view and off the campaign trail.\n\nShortly before 3 p.m. on Tuesday, Mr. Sanders did a walk-through of the debate stage with his wife, Jane Sanders. There were lots of smiles as he fiddled with his microphone and peered at the lights and cameras.", "description": "Follow our coverage of the CNN/New York Times debate.", "authors": ["Shane Goldmacher", "Reid J.
