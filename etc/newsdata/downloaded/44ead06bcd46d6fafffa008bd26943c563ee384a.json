Associated Press\n\nThough photos of the 2011 dinner are still available online, Epstein isn't featured in any, nor does his name appear on the event page \u2014 but he does appear in the background of a photo of Zack Bogue, the head of Montara Capital Partners.\n\nThe dinner is held annually by the New York literary agent John Brockman and his Edge group.\n\nBrockman describes his group as representative of \"the third culture,\" which \"consists of those scientists and other thinkers in the empirical world who, through their work and expository writing, are taking the place of the traditional intellectual in rendering visible the deeper meanings of our lives, redefining who and what we are.\"\n\nAccording to the BuzzFeed News report, Brockman was a proponent of Epstein's reintroduction to elite circles following his arrest and conviction for soliciting sex from a minor.\n\nA court sketch of Epstein at a status hearing in his sex-trafficking case in New York this year. Reuters\n\nEpstein was arrested on July 6 on suspicion of sex-trafficking minors. He was held without bail, awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking. On August 10, Epstein died by suicide at Manhattan's Metropolitan Correctional Center.\n\nIn his career as a financier, Epstein met and developed ties to some of the world's most famous names, like Bill Gates, as well as people like MIT's Marvin Minsky and LinkedIn's Reid Hoffman. In a New Yorker report published over the weekend, Gates was connected to Epstein through a donation to MIT.\n\nBut Epstein's arrest in July wasn't his first encounter with law enforcement. In 2008, Epstein was convicted of soliciting sex from a 14-year-old girl, and federal agents originally sought to connect him to the sexual abuse of nearly 40 girls. He served 13 months in a Florida jail before being released on probation.\n\nRead more: An elite group within one of America's most prestigious universities is embroiled in the ongoing Jeffrey Epstein scandal, and its director just quit \u2014 here's what's going on\n\nA plea deal arranged by Alexander Acosta, then the US attorney for Southern District of Florida, enabled Epstein to leave the facility and work from home up to 12 hours a day, six days a week. When Epstein was arrested this July, Acosta, then President Donald Trump's secretary of labor, resigned.\n\nIn the wake of Epstein's death, the federal case against him was dropped. But even with the case over, the fallout from the Epstein scandal continues.\n\nThe parties named above did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nCorrection: This article originally said the Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates attended the dinner.
