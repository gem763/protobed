Beats says it's sold 30 million Solo-branded headphones, and the new model will help it continue to compete in the on-ear headphone space against similar products from Sony and Bose.\n\nThe Solo Pro headphones use the same Apple H1 chip that Apple uses in the newest AirPods, and which Beats uses in the in-ear Powerbeats Pro. That's important, since the H1 chip allows you to pair your headphones to an iPhone or iPad just as easily as AirPods.\n\nYou just need to tap the screen once to pair initially, and then the Solo Pro headphones will sync each time you turn them on. The headphones turn on automatically when they're unfolded, too, which is a nice touch that I liked during my brief hands-on with them. Also, like AirPods, you can say \"Hey Siri\" to bring up Apple's voice assistant when you want to get directions, place a phone call, play music and more.", "description": "Apple's Beats brand announces the Beats Solo Pro noise-canceling headphones, which are easy to pair with iPhones and have \"Hey Siri\" support.", "authors": ["Todd Haselton"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106180719-1571080418928screenshot2019-10-14at11.04.59am.png?v=1571080461", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
