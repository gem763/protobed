And Trump keeps adding to the chaos.\n\nIn the four weeks since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., launched the investigation, Trump has taken steps that have drawn more criticism, not less, repeatedly testing the loyalty of his stalwart Republican allies. His actions have both intensified the questions at the center of the inquiry and opened new areas of concern.\n\nTrump angered GOP leaders and U.S. allies by clearing the way for Turkish attacks on Syrian Kurdish fighters, key American partners in the fight against the Islamic State group. He brazenly announced plans to hold next year's Group of Seven summit at one of his own Florida properties, prompting an outcry from ethics experts and members of both parties. And Trump and his advisers have repeatedly muddied their defense on the Democratic-led impeachment, initially denying some of the central allegations against the president only to acknowledge them, out loud and on camera.\n\n\"It is his persona to surround himself with chaos,\" said Alice Stewart, a Republican strategist who advised Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nChaos has indeed been a hallmark of Trump's presidency. Each controversy bleeds into the next \u2014 often so fast that the public doesn't have time to absorb the details of any one issue. Whether that is a deliberate Trump strategy or simply the consequence of Americans electing a highly unconventional, nonpolitician as commander in chief remains one of the fundamental questions of his presidency.\n\nThe most pressing question now is how the cascading controversies will impact Trump at one of his most vulnerable moments since taking office.\n\nAlready saddled by low approval ratings, he could face reelection with the dubious distinction of being just the third American president ever impeached. Though conviction and removal from office by the Republican-controlled Senate seems virtually impossible, Trump's handling of the coming weeks could linger with some of the voters he needs to hold in order to win in 2020.\n\nHis response thus far has been pulled from the standard Trump playbook : hurling deeply personal, sometimes vulgar, insults at his opponents, questioning the legitimacy of the investigations into his actions and distracting with other jarring decisions.\n\nFor example, there was his public call for China to investigate baseless corruption claims against Democrat Joe Biden just days after Democrats launched impeachment proceedings to probe Trump's similar request of Ukraine.\n\nThere are some signs that Trump's words and actions are being received differently, both in Washington and across the country, from other points in his presidency.\n\nPolls now show more Americans in favor of opening the impeachment inquiry than those who are opposed, a shift since earlier this year. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that 54% of Americans approved of the House decision to conduct an inquiry, while 44% disapproved. In a Pew poll conducted a few weeks earlier, the public was evenly divided on the question.\n\nA few prominent Republicans have moved in favor of the investigation, which centers in part on whether Trump used his office for personal political gain by asking Ukraine to investigate the unfounded accusations against former Vice President Biden.\n\nJohn Kasich, the former Republican governor of Ohio, is among the Republicans who now back an impeachment inquiry, though he told The Associated Press in an interview that he isn't ready to call for Trump's removal from office.\n\n\"This is an extremely serious matter,\" Kasich said. \"I wrestled with it for a very long time.\"\n\nKasich was persuaded by the White House's shifting story on why Trump withheld $400 million in military aid for Ukraine, one of the issues under investigation by the House.\n\nAfter insisting there was no quid pro quo at play \u2014 and allowing Republicans to use that as a rationale for opposing the impeachment inquiry \u2014 acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Thursday that one of the reasons the aid was held up was that Trump wanted Ukrainian officials to investigate a debunked conspiracy involving the Democratic National Committee. Mulvaney later tried to back away from that statement.", "description": "The impeachment investigation into President Donald Trump has thrust Washington into a political crisis.
