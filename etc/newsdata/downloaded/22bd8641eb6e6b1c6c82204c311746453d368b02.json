International Trade Secretary Liz Truss says that the US, Japan, New Zealand and Australia are all ready to negotiate a post-Brexit free trade agreement\n\nDowning Street has ordered Britain\u2019s trade negotiators to call a halt to talks with America over a post-EU deal \u2013 over fears that it might \u2018spook\u2019 Brussels and ruin the chance of a breakthrough in the Brexit impasse.\n\nOfficials at the Department for International Trade (DiT) have privately expressed their frustration that No 10 is not allowing them to close a deal with Washington in case it angers the EU in the run-up to the critical summit on October 17.\n\nThe DiT has hit back by arguing that securing deals with the US and other countries would help the talks by giving them \u2018leverage\u2019 for \u2018the purposes of EU negotiations\u2019.\n\nInternational Trade Secretary Liz Truss says that the US, Japan, New Zealand and Australia are all ready to negotiate a free trade agreement with the UK post-Brexit, describing them as \u2018very enthusiastic trading partners\u2019 who are \u2018very keen to get started\u2019.\n\nIn America\u2019s case, it would be the largest free trade agreement the US has ever signed with another nation.\n\nWashington\u2019s major priority is to cut UK tariffs on steel imports, while Ms Truss is determined to secure access to the US\u2019s market for financial services.\n\nMs Truss said at last week\u2019s Tory conference: \u2018There are negotiations to go through first, but we are going to be tough negotiators. This is because we are in a very strong position, we\u2019re striking our first trade deals in 45 years, we\u2019re the fifth largest economy in the world'\n\nMs Truss said at last week\u2019s Tory conference: \u2018There are negotiations to go through first, but we are going to be tough negotiators. This is because we are in a very strong position, we\u2019re striking our first trade deals in 45 years, we\u2019re the fifth largest economy in the world. We have a lot of opportunities that those other nations want to access, though it\u2019s got to be in our interest to strike a deal.\u2019\n\nMs Truss travelled to New York last month to meet her opposite number, US trade boss Robert Lighthizer \u2013 and to insist the UK will not compromise on food standards or access to the NHS as part of the deal.\n\nLondon and Washington have provisionally agreed to aim for a deal to be struck by July 2020 \u2013 assuming Brexit has finally been secured before then.", "description": "Officials at the Department for International Trade (DiT) are trying to close a deal.
