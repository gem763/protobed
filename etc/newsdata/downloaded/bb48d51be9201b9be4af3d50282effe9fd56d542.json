REUTERS/Phil Noble\n\n(Reuters) - AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) said on Wednesday it had received marketing authorisation from China\u2019s National Medical Products Administration for its top-selling drug, Tagrisso, to treat adults with a form of lung cancer.\n\nChina approved Tagrisso as a first-line treatment for adults with non-small cell lung cancer patients whose tumours have certain genetic mutations, AstraZeneca said.\n\nLast month, the British drugmaker said a late-stage study showed Tagrisso had significantly helped patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated metastatic non-small cell lung cancer live longer without the disease worsening.\n\nThe company has moved deeper into cancer therapy through wide-ranging deals, including those for immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Earlier this year, it agreed to a multi-billion dollar oncology deal with Japan\u2019s Daiichi Sankyo Co (4568.T).\n\nSales from AstraZeneca\u2019s oncology unit soared 57% to $2.17 billion in the second quarter, accounting for 38% of total product sales, with revenue from Tagrisso nearly doubling to $784 million.\n\nAstraZeneca had also raised its product sales forecast for 2019, thanks in part to strong sales of cancer drugs.", "description": "AstraZeneca Plc said on Wednesday it had received marketing authorisation from China's National Medical Products Administration for its top-selling drug, Tagrisso, to treat adults with a form of lung cancer.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190904&t=2&i=1426045857&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF830ID"}
