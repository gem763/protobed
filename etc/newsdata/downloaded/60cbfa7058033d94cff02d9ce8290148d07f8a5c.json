Luke\u2019s Church\n\nWhen it comes to green spaces, we\u2019re a bit spoilt in New York City. There are over 1,700 parks (even if it doesn\u2019t always feel that way) for our picnics, parties, and general frolicking to unfold. But 150 years ago, parks were still a privilege for the upper-class in America, if they even existed at all. So folks flocked to the next best thing: the cemetery. There, in the shady knolls of Boston\u2019s Forest Hills Cemetery, or amongst the gothic gates of Brooklyn\u2019s Green-Wood Cemetery, 19th century Americans got to engage in their two favourite pastimes: bonding with the dead, and feeling their pastoral oats. Elaborate walkways, gardens, and follies abounded in the cemeteries \u2013 one even had a liquor license \u2013 in a way that\u2019s made us wonder why cracking open a cold one with the deceased ever went out of style\u2026\n\nWoodland Cemetery, c. 1900 / Woodland Cemetery\n\nEuropeans first ran into the issue of overcrowded churchyards, so they invented the sectarian, \u201crural cemetery\u201d. The very first was Paris\u2019 P\u00e8re Lachaise in 1804. Back in the day, it was outlandish for Westerners to think they\u2019d be buried anywhere but the churchyard. Then came urbanisation, overpopulated cities, and a rising mortality rate from Yellow Fever, Tuburculpsis, Cholera, etc. \u2013 people were dropping like flies, and there was nowhere to bury them with dignity. In the 1880s, one census found that the \u201curban mortality rate was 50% higher than rural mortality rates\u201d in America. Rural cemeteries were on the outskirts of cities, spread out over massive plots of land, and thus considered less prone to disease.\n\nGreen-Wood Cemetery. \u00a9Green-Wood Historic Fund Collections. / Instagram\n\nThe United States took note, as well as inspiration from the sprawling Victorians gardens of Europe. After all, if they wanted to entice people into rural cemeteries, they had to find a way to make them appealing. In Massachusetts, there was Forest Hills Cemetery with its arboretum and sculpture garden, as well as the massive Mount Auburn Cemetery, whose 175-acres touted meadows, forests, follies, ponds, fountains and more. Often, they were called \u201cgrave gardens.\u201d\n\nEven if you didn\u2019t have an ancestor to picnic with, rural cemeteries became a place for city goers to retreat for a day. Nannies could take the baby for a stroll in the pram, while women paraded the avenues with parasols in one arm, and a man on the other.\n\nPhotographer and Green-Wood permanent resident James Cremer (1821-1893) captured this stereoview photograph (ca. 1870s) in Fairmount Park, in Philadelphia, as part of a series entitled \u201cScenery in Fairmount Park. \u00a9Green-Wood Cemetery / Instagram\n\nGreen-Wood Cemetery. \u00a9John S. Moulton, ca. 1880, courtesy of The Green-Wood Historic Fund Collections / Instagram\n\nIn Chicago, the Bohemian Cemetery even had its own liquor license, what with Scheiner\u2019s Beer Hall and Road House being adjacent to their greenhouses. It also boasted three different picnic groves for people to reconvene after a ceremony, Scheiners, Atlas, and Nagl\u2019s Grove.\n\nScheiner\u2019s Beer Hall and Road House by the Bohemian National Cemetery in Chicago\n\nMeanwhile, the great American parks were underway. Sure, the 50 acre Boston Commons, est. 1634, was the first official park is the United States \u2013 but it would be nowhere near as large as Central Park (778 acres), est. 1853, or Golden Gate Park in San Francisco which was built, in part, to deliberately one-up its East Coast rival at 1,013 acres filled with even more attractions (there\u2019s still a paddock of bison in the park. Bison). Cemeteries, as the misfit parks they were, followed suit.\n\n\u00a9Green-Wood Cemetery / Instagram\n\nUnfortunately, the post-war years left Americans more shell-shocked than ever. Something shifted (or perhaps peaked) in the American attitude towards death as a taboo and tragic subject in the 1950s. It became so much more of an out-of-sight-out-of-mind matter \u2013 partially because people were living longer, and making more money (hello, Baby Boomers).\n\nAs a result, the atmosphere of cemeteries grew decidedly more sterile, and the desire to hang in cemeteries dissipated \u2013 which isn\u2019t to say Americans had been literally dancing over their loved ones\u2019 graves all this time (leave that to the Romans). But it had an actively engaged role in the community. A cemetery was a place of quiet, nature and contemplation. It made room \u2013 mentally, and physically \u2013 for folks to digest all the nuances of their grief while the world didn\u2019t just pass them by, but meet them at the cemetery gates.\n\nGreen-Wood\u2019s Arch in a 1903 colour tinted photograph, sourced from a stereoview. \u00a9The Green-Wood Historic Fund Collections. / Instagram\n\nWe\u2019re happy to say that the pendulum is starting to swing back to hanging in cemeteries. More and more historic cemeteries are finding ways to reignite the century-old flame they had with the public, and not always in a macabre, spooky way. The Hollywood Forever Cemetery has movie nights. Mount Auburn Cemetery has begun hosting a book club, twilight walking tours, and \u2018treasure hunts\u2019 for fourth graders. There\u2019s even a Cemetery Picnic Club floating around the Twitterverse.\n\nGreve Cemetery in Hoffman Estates, Illinois. \u00a9Roger Meyer Family and the Shaumburg Township District Library.\n\n\u201cWe all experience and process death in different ways,\u201d explains Brooklyn\u2019s beloved Green-Wood Cemetery, one of the country\u2019s first rural cemeteries, on its eagerness to engage with the community. A visit there today is nothing short of charming, complete with a little green trolley that will shuffle you around from its notable sites, like the historic hilltop of the \u201cBattle of Brooklyn\u201d that took place in 1776. As the highest point in Brooklyn, it\u2019s got sweeping views of the city, complete peace and quiet, and four lakes for enchanting summertime evenings\u2026\n\nA shot rom Green-Wood Cemetery\u2019s \u201cshot is from last year\u2019s \u201cA Night at Niblo\u2019s Garden.\u201d / Green-Wood Cemetery via @maike_photog. / Instagram\n\nThe tallest part of Brooklyn. \u00a9landmarksofny / Instagram\n\n\u201cThose interested in the various human perspectives on death, dying, and memorialization will want to reserve a space for \u2018Cemetery Shorts\u2019 [this summer]\u201d says the Green-Wood staff on their movie nights. The grounds also host art exhibits, and teach beginner\u2019s bee keeping (did we mention there\u2019s a whole, secret world of Bee Villages in NYC?).\n\nGreen-Wood (not Greenwood, mind you. Locals are touchy on that) was itself founded on a curious bedrock back in 1838. It\u2019s got lush, undulating grounds that you won\u2019t see elsewhere in NYC, because it\u2019s actually on the site of an ancient glacier called \u201cthe Laurentide ice sheet\u201d. Notable graves include the author of The Wizard of Oz, Basquiat, and Leonard Bernstein. Local lore also says the vibrant monk parakeets nesting on its grounds came all from Argentina by way of a shattered crate at JFK in the 1960s. As a cemetery, it\u2019s astounding. As a park, it\u2019s one of the city\u2019s best kept secrets.\n\nOne last tip for the wise?
