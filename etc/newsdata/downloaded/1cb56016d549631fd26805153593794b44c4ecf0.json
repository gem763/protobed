What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\u201d\n\nMr. Trump then rejected the chief justice\u2019s position, tweeting \u201cSorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have \u2018Obama judges.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMr. Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) have made a priority of filing the federal bench with conservative appointees, and Mr. Trump has embraced the issue as a central point of his re-election bid. On the Supreme Court, Mr. Trump\u2019s two conservative picks have tilted the balance to the right, highlighting the importance of the president in determining the federal courts\u2019 makeup and the future course of the law.\n\n\u201cHistoric Milestone indeed!\u201d the president tweeted Friday, along with an article noting he has filled 150 judgeships.\n\nThree other federal circuit judges on the panel Saturday, all either Trump or Obama appointees, joined Judge Barrett in rejecting partisan characterizations of the judiciary, also criticizing news reports that emphasize which president picked a judge for the bench.\n\n\u201cWe certainly are not viewing ourselves as members of teams or camps or parties. It\u2019s a very frustrating thing about the way the media portray us,\u201d said Judge Stephanos Bibas, a Trump appointee to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia. \u201cMy boss is not my chief judge. My boss is not my appointing president, my boss is the Constitution and the laws,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe will interpret the law somewhat differently. And we have different legitimate understandings of how to do that. But none of us would have taken this job if we wanted to be legislators,\u201d said Judge Bibas, a former law professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cWe really aren\u2019t thinking, \u2018I\u2019m here to do the bidding of the party of the president that put me here,\u2019 \u201d said Judge Cornelia Pillard, an Obama appointee to the District of Columbia Circuit. \u201cOne of the things that really feels threatening, and frustrating\u2014although I understand why\u2014is how much what the public hears through the press is about the partisan lineups\u201d on the courts.\n\nThe moderator, William & Mary law professor Allison Orr Larsen, asked the judges what they perceived as the greatest threat to the judiciary.\n\nJudge Barrett said it was \u201cpeople perceiving us as partisan.\u201d While judges differ in their legal theories and methods\u2014and their votes sometimes can be predicted along ideological lines\u2014they aren\u2019t driven to produce specific outcomes, she said.\n\nJudge Barrett, a University of Notre Dame law professor before Mr. Trump appointed her to the Chicago-based Seventh Circuit in 2017, is a favorite of social conservatives who was considered for the Supreme Court vacancy that went to Justice Brett Kavanaugh. She has been suggested as a particularly serious contender should Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, age 86, or another female justice step down during Mr. Trump\u2019s term.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really understand why it is that people want so badly to put us on teams,\u201d said Judge Kevin Newsom, a Trump appointee to the Atlanta-based 11th Circuit. \u201cYou know, my Democratically-appointed colleagues on the 11th circuit, I love them, and I think they love me, and lots of times we see eye to eye. And when we don\u2019t, we\u2019re all still friends,\u201d he said.\n\nThe judges also raised concerns about the judicial-selection process, which has become heavily partisan in recent years. For generations, Senate custom required a supermajority to confirm judges, a requirement that promoted consensus nominees. In 2013, Senate Democrats, then in the majority, eliminated that provision for lower-court judges after Republicans used filibusters to block several Obama nominees. The move cleared the way to confirm Judge Pillard and others by majority vote.\n\nIn 2017, the Senate, under Republican control, took the next step by eliminating filibusters of Supreme Court nominees, allowing the confirmation of Justice Neil Gorsuch.\n\nJudge Pillard lamented those developments.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of authority and we are life-tenured. And so that\u2019s why people fight so hard,\u201d over judgeships, she said. But \u201cin a healthy system, we should all be confirmed by 99 or 100% of the vote. And it used to be that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that the Senate got rid of the filibuster,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m a beneficiary of that in terms of having this job. But it\u2019s a shame that it had to come to that.\u201d\n\nWrite to Jess Bravin at jess.bravin@wsj.com", "description": "Federal judges including potential Supreme Court pick Amy Coney Barrett bemoaned a partisan political environment that has led President Trump and some others to label them as extensions of the presidents who appointed them.", "authors": ["Jess Bravin", "Jess.Bravin Wsj.Com"], "top_image": "https://images.wsj.net/im-107316/social", "published_at": "2019-09-15"}
