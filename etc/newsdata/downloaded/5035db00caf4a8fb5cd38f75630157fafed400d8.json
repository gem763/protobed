Millennials are drinking staggering amounts of hard seltzer instead of beer. In the most recent reported sales figures, White Claw and Truly outsold every craft beer brand put together. In July, White Claw claims it outsold Budweiser. Yes, Budweiser.\n\nThe category has been growing at a triple-digit annual rate since 2016, and is expected to grow by about 300 percent in 2019. Amazingly, even that number is limited to some extent by production capacity. In other words, if there was more White Claw available, people would buy it.\n\nThis is no passing fad, either. According to Sanjiv Gajiwala, senior vice president of marketing for Mark Anthony Brands, which owns White Claw and the Mike\u2019s Hard line, after someone has purchased a can of their hard seltzer, \u201cone in three people will buy it again. That\u2019s pretty good.\u201d Even with their impressive sales, he maintains there\u2019s actually room for the brand to grow. While nearly every liquor store and supermarket carries White Claw, only 20 percent of bars and restaurants are currently selling it.\n\nWhite Claw is the top-selling hard seltzer in the country with about 60 percent of the market and Truly is in second place with about 30 percent. \u201cIn 2016, we sold the same amount of Truly in an entire summer that we now sell in a week,\u201d Boston Beer chief marketing officer Lesya Lysyj told me. \u201cWe are up 185 percent from this time last year.\u201d\n\nWith 90 percent of the market, and the solid savvy of Mike\u2019s Hard and Boston Beer behind them, White Claw and Truly are the story, and the other brands are playing catch up. (There\u2019s one exception: Four Loko is about to enter the market with a 14-percent ABV \u201csour blue\u201d seltzer, which should stir up the waters, at least in the shallow end.)\n\nFor most news outlets, these big numbers are the story. Okay, there was a piece in The Atlantic that let us know that drinking hard seltzer is a gloriously anti-intellectual decision, but you knew someone was going to say that.\n\nBut there are a lot of unanswered questions about the phenomenon. For instance, how is it that hard seltzer is outselling Budweiser, and yet lots of people still don\u2019t know what it is? So, what the hell is \u201chard seltzer\u201d anyway?\n\n\u201c How is it that hard seltzer is outselling Budweiser, and yet lots of people still don\u2019t know what it is? So, what the hell is\u201chard seltzer\u201d anyway? \u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not an easy answer. For one thing, the term \u201chard seltzer\u201d has only become the preferred term in the past eight to 12 months; before that, \u201cspiked seltzer\u201d led Google searches. \u201cSpiked\u201d continues to be used in advertising and publicity for most brands, which blurs the details of what this stuff is. \u201cSpiked\u201d implies that alcohol has been added to seltzer, like when you \u201cspike\u201d a punch by pouring in liquor. But these beverages are all brewed, not formulated.\n\nGajiwala fielded the question cleanly. \u201cWe ferment gluten-free grains to create alcohol,\u201d he said. \u201cWe then run it through our own proprietary Brewpure process to create colorless, flavorless liquid. We add carbonated water, flavors, and a little bit of cane sugar to bring out the flavor.\u201d That\u2019s as much detail as I found anywhere. What are the grains? What is the Brewpure process? That\u2019s proprietary information, I was told.\n\nTruly takes a different path. \u201cThe alcohol found in Truly is made from 100- percent all-natural cane sugar,\u201d said Lysyj, \u201cwhich is fermented during the brewing process, along with a hint of fruit. The result is a crisp and clean flavor profile, just like sparkling water\u2014but spiked.\u201d Like White Claw, this process gives Truly the ability to place the desirable \u201cgluten-free\u201d tag on its label.\n\nAll of the seltzers are brewed, not formulated. It\u2019s an important distinction, because of the taxation regulations of the federal and state governments. If beverage alcohol is brewed, it is taxed at a much lower rate than beverage alcohol that is distilled after brewing. (Wine and cider are taxed at an intermediate rate.) If these seltzers were actually \u201cspiked\u201d with vodka or neutral grain spirits, they\u2019d be significantly more expensive on the shelf thanks to higher taxes.\n\nSo that\u2019s what hard seltzers are, but why are they happening now? And how long will this trend last? Smirnoff Ice blew up the flavored malt beverage category, along with Mike\u2019s Hard Lemonade, but that settled down into a healthy niche. Cider keeps coming and going\u2014it\u2019s, unfortunately, in a \u201cgoing\u201d phase right now. Hard sodas, typified by Not Your Father\u2019s Root Beer, saw huge growth followed by a quick drop, probably fed by the large amount of sugar in the drinks.\n\nWhile none of these other drinks are exactly analogous, I do think these experiences helped hard seltzer to catch on, along with some other important trends and factors.\n\nI have to, of course, mention the vodka-soda, which is the most frequent drink ordered at bars and nightclubs. Given its popularity, any bartender you meet will tell you that vodka-soda pays the bills. Hard seltzer is the canned (or draft, if you can find it) equivalent of a fizzy vodka-soda, with its crisp snap, \u201chealthy\u201d vibe, and light flavor.\n\nLysyj pointed out to me two other significant trends that helped the growth of hard seltzer, the \u201cgrowth in the consumption of carbonated water in the U.S. and an overall interest in low-calorie alcoholic beverages.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d had products like hard seltzer in our pipeline for a while,\u201d she said, \u201cbut we felt that this was the right time to bring them into the marketplace.\u201d\n\nSo, will hard seltzer be around next summer or even this winter? \u201cFrom everything we\u2019ve seen,\u201d Lysyj said, \u201chard seltzer has staying power. People are trying Truly as an alternative to vodka-soda, light beer, and wine, and they\u2019re sticking around and buying more. It hits the rare sweet spot of flavor, refreshment and functional benefits that make it much more than a boom and bust.\u201d\n\nAnd Gajiwala pointed out that it\u2019s still a pretty new thing. \u201cI think there are a lot of people who haven\u2019t tried it,\u201d he said, and chuckled. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go get them to try it.\u201d\n\nWhile I\u2019m a bit more skeptical, when I look at hard seltzers, I see the creation of a new category\u2014not an extension of flavored malt beverages. I also suspect that even after something else new comes along and steals the spotlight, there is still going to be a ton of hard seltzer sold. And to be sparkling clear, I don\u2019t see anything on the horizon that could even come close to catching up to hard seltzer, let alone surpassing it.\n\nSo, hang on beer.
