But for some Instagrammers it\u2019s also now a job. Amelia Tait meets the influencers making a career out of blogging about Disney food, Disney fashion and Disney fun\n\nWhen she was living in New York City, AJ Wolfe would read guidebooks about Walt Disney World on her way to work. Wolfe used the books to \u201cescape from real life\u201d on her commute. Fifteen years later, she makes a living doing a job that didn\u2019t even exist then, and many can hardly believe exists now \u2013 eating sweets at the Most Magical Place on Earth.\n\nSince 2009, Wolfe, a mother of one from Texas, has posted pictures and food reviews of Disney food online at her Disney Food Blog, which has evolved into a wildly successful website, video channel and Instagram page. She has accumulated more than 82m views on YouTube and has more than 530,000 followers on Instagram. Like most content creators, Wolfe earns money by selling adverts and taking sponsorships directly from brands. She can hardly believe it. \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 incredible,\u201d she says.\n\nWolfe, 41, travels to Disney World once a month. On those days, she gets up at 6am, visits the park, tastes and takes pictures of the food and works until 2am editing content. \u201cIt\u2019s an unsustainable way of living if you\u2019re there every day,\u201d she says, \u201cbut if you\u2019re only there for a few days\u2026\u201d\n\nA decade ago, Wolfe relied on credit cards to pay for her frequent Disney trips. Now, she\u2019s essentially paid to go. \u201cI like to say Disney World is the opposite of New York: perfectly manicured, cultivated happiness versus the gritty reality of the city that never sleeps,\u201d she explains. \u201cI think that\u2019s why Disney approaches \u2018obsessive\u2019 levels for some people. It\u2019s such a marked escape from the worries and stresses of their real, day-to-day life.\u201d For years, \u201cDisney was an absolute obsession for me,\u201d she says. Now it\u2019s her career.\n\nWolfe is one of hundreds of people who make a living posting Disney content online, and one of many millions who enjoy consuming it. Though usually not officially affiliated with the brand itself, people who photograph themselves in Disney parks have collectively earned a small fortune by posting about the mouse.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Disney is an escape from the worries and stresses of our day-to-day lives\u2019: an ice-cream picture from AJ Wolfe, who runs the Disneyfoodblog.com\n\nWe\u2019re familiar with the concept of Instagram influencers \u2013 people who live polished and perfect lives that we love (and hate) to follow. But in a world oversaturated with #beauty and #bikini shots, niche influencers are on the rise, too. There are influencers who only post about Harry Potter \u2013 dressing up as characters and attempting to cook foods mentioned in the books \u2013 and influencers obsessed with Poundland, who show off their weekly bargains. There are vegan influencers, Christian influencers, dog influencers, kidfluencers. \u201cYou surround yourself with your tribe,\u201d Wolfe theorises of the trend. \u201cDisney is a happy place, a getaway, so it makes sense that you want to dive into it. When I\u2019m not in Disney World, I do the same thing. I think everyone wants to get a little taste of vacation life.\u201d\n\nOver the past few years, marketing agencies have begun to understand the benefits of \u201cmicro influencers\u201d. Typically, they have fewer followers than the traditionally internet famous, but small-time influencers are valuable because their followers are often more loyal and thus more likely to purchase recommended products. In an age of increasing distrust towards influencers, marketers feel micro influencers who command the attention of a close-knit group will provide a better return on investment.\n\nIn the early years of the internet, online spaces were fragmented. You might have logged on to 20 different websites, which might not have overlapped with the 20 sites visited by your neighbour. Today, however, we\u2019re stuck in a cycle of constantly checking Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, then Facebook again. Arguably, we are now trying to recapture more personalised online experiences. Between 2017 and 2018, membership of subject-specific Facebook groups increased by 40%, as more and more people sought to interact with like-minded people online. Niche influencers offer an opportunity for people to reclaim a personalised internet experience. We\u2019re less interested in following the same travel vlogger followed by 4m others. In short: love Disney? Follow the Disney micro influencer.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Working for Walt: InsidEARS Dave and Steph from Eastbourne, who post at @Krispysmore\n\nChelsea Watson is a Disney Instagrammer (@StyledByMagic; 65,000 followers) whose grid is bursting with bright colours and classic influencer shots. She twirls her skirts, pouts her lips and strikes over-the-shoulder poses. The key difference between Watson, 24, and other famous Instagrammers \u2013 the model Kylie Jenner, for example, or Britain\u2019s girl-next-door Zoella \u2013 is the mouse ears atop Watson\u2019s head. \u201cI know my family don\u2019t always fully understand how it works,\u201d Watson says, of her influencing career.\n\nIn 2017, she and her husband moved to Florida from New Hampshire so Watson could pursue a Disney career full-time and she now visits the parks \u201cat least twice a week\u201d. Her posts are dedicated to Disney-inspired fashion and accessories. She creates roughly three sponsored posts a month; brands pay her to advertise their products in a picture. Though she won\u2019t talk exact figures, this is now her sole income. \u201cIn a sense, I\u2019m just like any other fashion blogger,\u201d she says. \u201cThe dream is to always do something you love.\u201d\n\nWatson has a passion for fashion. But she also has a passion for Disney. When we speak over Skype, her hair is half-up-half-down in a big scrunchie, and she is wearing a Dumbo T-shirt in which the cartoon elephant\u2019s ears are tied into a cute little knot. \u201cDisney was such a formidable part of my generation\u2019s upbringing. We consumed so much as we were growing up that it made a lasting impact.\u201d\n\nIn a remarkably prescient essay from 1992, NYU professor David Forgacs wrote that anyone born after 1925 is a \u201cDisney baby\u201d, brought up on a diet of films, stories and merchandise dictated by the mouse. \u201cDisney babies grow, ideally, into Disney adults,\u201d he wrote, arguing that Disney adults have Disney babies of their own. Forgacs spoke of the way the parks marketed nostalgia and played with the boundaries between adolescent and child, in order to profit. \u201cChildren are a major source of Disney income, but only indirectly: it is adults who spend money on them,\u201d he reminds us.\n\nThis summer, a New York Post writer declared: \u201cSorry, childless millennials going to Disney World is weird,\u201d after a mother\u2019s Facebook rant went viral: \u201cPeople without children need to be banned!!!!\u201d But Watson and Wolfe say their audiences are diverse. They are followed by families, elderly couples and childless millennials. \u201cI\u2019m always taken aback by the mix of people,\u201d Watson says.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I don\u2019t ever want to lose our sense of magic\u2019: bloggers Britt and Jared who post at @Disney_atheart\n\nWhy does she think people find her content so compelling? \u201cI think it has a lot to do with the climate in general,\u201d she says. \u201cIn today\u2019s world, people want something happy and positive to focus on. Disney really is for everyone. It\u2019s not just for kids.\u201d She argues that Disney influencers give people \u201ca place to come together and talk about things they love. Be happy. Get away from the negativity for a while.\u201d\n\nNo one in Watson\u2019s personal life has criticised her for being a grown adult who loves Disney, but other Disney influencers haven\u2019t been so lucky. Britt and Jared are a married couple from Louisiana who have 32,000 followers on their Disney Instagram and YouTube profiles combined. They both still work full time (Jared as a pharmacist, Britt as a hairstylist), though Britt has doubled her income by selling homemade Mickey Mouse ears on Instagram.\n\nThey are watching 1999\u2019s Tarzan just before I Skype them and they tell me about a Mickey Mouse scarecrow outside their house for the autumn season.\n\n\u201cDo you ever get judged by people?\u201d I ask. \u201cOh my God,\u201d Britt exclaims. Jared offers a prolonged laugh punctuated with a simple, \u201cYeah!\u201d A few years ago, when Britt worked in a bank, she saw her colleague was swamped with work and offered to help. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a colouring book to colour?\u201d her colleague had retorted. \u201cThat\u2019s the rudest thing anybody has ever said to me,\u201d says Britt. \u201cJust because I like Disney doesn\u2019t make me immature. It makes me way more open-minded and broad, that I could find magic in places that you\u2019re struggling to find magic in.\u201d\n\nMagic isn\u2019t the only thing the couple find at Disney World. Britt says they were \u201cbroke as a joke\u201d before she began selling her ears. Now, if the couple have a big bill or need money quickly, she can open up her ear shop and instantly sell 40-50 pairs, which she will make in the course of a month. But the couple say they\u2019re not just motivated by money, they enjoy the opportunity \u2013 through the Disney vlogs they post every Monday \u2013 to share the parks with those who can\u2019t afford to visit them in real life.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018I know my family don\u2019t always fully understand how it works\u2019: Chelsea Watson who blogs at @StyledByMagic\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had people message us from all over the world saying they were suicidal and our videos helped them through the darkest parts of their lives,\u201d Britt says. \u201cIt\u2019s helped them through sicknesses. It\u2019s helped them through family feuds. It\u2019s helped them through their own depression, their own fights. It\u2019s amazing that us going on vacation is helping someone else.\u201d\n\nOnce, in the Magic Kingdom, the couple saw a Colombian woman standing alone, crying as she looked at ornaments in the year-round Christmas shop. She told them she was a cancer survivor and that her family had pooled all their money to send her to Disney World, but couldn\u2019t afford for anyone else to accompany her. \u201cIt was almost like an out-of-body experience,\u201d says Britt. \u201cI looked around\u2026 I can literally wake up any day and get on a plane and go to Disney World. I have a career out of going to this place; I\u2019ve made friends. It put into perspective how grateful we are to be able to do what we do.\u201d\n\nThey also enjoy Disney parks because they feel secure there. \u201cWe don\u2019t ever have to worry about not feeling safe. The world is really scary now,\u201d says Jared. When Britt goes to Disney, she is happy in the knowledge that everyone else is visiting for the same reason she is. \u201cWhen you go to a place like New York City, you don\u2019t know what the person standing next to you is there for.\u201d\n\nA reputation for being the happiest place on Earth means Disneyland has always been profitable, but it\u2019s undoubtable the company benefits from the influencer trend. Since 2018, Disneyland Paris has run an influencer programme called InsidEARS, giving a select number of influencers early access to information in the hope they\u2019ll promote the parks to a millennial audience, often Dinks (dual income, no kids) who have cash to spare.\n\nSteph and Dave, 34 and 32, are InsidEARS from Eastbourne. They have 30,000 YouTube subscribers and 14,000 Instagram followers. When they Skype me from their home office, they are sitting in front of a copy of the \u201cPurple Wall\u201d in Disney\u2019s Magic Kingdom park. Above the fireplace in their living room is a painting of Mufasa and Simba from The Lion King. \u201cWe have to create some story when we have an electrician come into the house,\u201d laughs Steph. \u201cBut when people comment online and say, \u2018You brighten my day up,\u2019 that\u2019s the best thing ever.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Global appeal: fireworks exploding over the castle at an event to mark the first anniversary of the opening of Shanghai Disneyland. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images\n\nSteph and Dave\u2019s viewers are mostly aged between 25-35. \u201cA lot of people think Disney is a kids\u2019 thing,\u201d says Dave. \u201cI\u2019m going to keep this going until I\u2019m old and wrinkly, and still going to the parks.\u201d Do Disney influencers ever get sick of Disney? None of the influencers I speak to can comprehend the idea of being sick of Disney. Their biggest fear is that their career will somehow dampen their love of the brand. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to get in the mindset that it\u2019s always work for me,\u201d says Chelsea Watson. \u201cI don\u2019t ever want to lose that sense of magic.\u201d\n\nBelieve it or not, Disney influencing can be difficult \u2013 a job is, after all, a job. There\u2019s a pressure to always be online, multiple outfit changes in the park, long days, and the ever-increasing expectations of fans. Still, as far as opportunities to earn money go, it seems you can hardly beat reviewing a Mickey-shaped ice-cream, or showing off your latest Disney products haul.\n\n\u201cWe just get out there and enjoy ourselves,\u201d says Dave. He says the couple often film themselves \u201cgiddy as kids\u201d at the airport before arriving at the parks, and that this is some of their most popular content. \u201cPeople share the same feelings we do,\u201d he says, \u201cso that must be the reason it does so well.\u201d\n\nIn essence, these influencers allow viewers all the escapism of a Disney holiday without the price tag. \u201cWhen you go to Disney World, you forget that the world has become so dark outside,\u201d says Britt, in Louisiana. Food blogger Wolfe concurs: \u201cWhen you\u2019re at Disney World, you\u2019re able to escape your stresses. And it\u2019s wonderful.\u201d", "description": "Disneyland has long been the holiday of a lifetime. But for some Instagrammers it\u2019s also now a job.
