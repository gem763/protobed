Labour and other MPs abstained, and in total, MPs voted 299-70 to hold a General Election. However, an election cannot be triggered without the support of two-thirds of all 650 lawmakers under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act introduced by David Cameron to appease then-Liberal Democrats leader Nick Clegg in 2011.\n\nThe prime minister will now put forward a new, one-line bill that only requires a simple majority. Mr Johnson hopes an election will clear out the House of Remainers who continue to obstruct the fulfilment of the 2016 referendum result.\n\nThe Conservatives do not have a majority in the House of Commons, however, so will require support from the opposition members. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn confirmed on Tuesday morning that he would back a December General Election in a major about-turn on his previous position.\n\nAccording to a statement from Mr Corbyn seen by The Mirror, the Labour leader said: \u201cI have consistently said that we are ready for an election and our support is subject to a No Deal Brexit being off the table.\n\n\u201cWe have now heard from the EU that the extension of Article 50 to 31st January has been confirmed, so for the next three months, our condition of taking No Deal off the table has now been met.\n\n\u201cWe will now launch the most ambitious and radical campaign for real change our country has ever seen.\u201d\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, said that the government wants all debate stages of the bill to take place on Tuesday, according to the BBC, with the Conservative MP saying the bill would be \u201cextremely short, simple, and limited in scope\u201d. The House of Lords would later consider the proposed legislation before becoming law.\n\nBoris Formally Accepts #Brexit Delay, Begs EU Not to Delay AGAIN in 2020 https://t.co/8LHw0wIYao \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 28, 2019\n\nOn Monday, Mr Johnson wrote to the European Council to formally accept a third Brexit delay, a \u201cflextension\u201d to January 31st, 2020. Parliament had forced through a law that compelled the prime minister to request an extension after he had pledged to take the UK out of the EU on October 31st.\n\nSpeaking after the government lost the vote last night, Prime Minister Johnson said that \u201cthis House cannot any longer keep this country hostage\u201d.\n\n\u201cI do not believe that this paralysis and this stagnation should be allowed to continue,\u201d he added, continuing that it was time \u201cto replace this dysfunctional Parliament with a new Parliament that can get Brexit done so the country can move on\u201d.\n\n\u201cAn election\u2026 would allow a new Parliament and a new Government to be in place by Christmas. Without that hard stop of an election, without that moment of truth, the electorate will, I am afraid, have a sense that we are all like Charlie Brown, endlessly running up to kick the ball, only to have Parliament whisk it away yet again, only to find that Parliament is willing to go on delaying and delaying, to the end of January, to February and beyond,\u201d Prime Minister Johnson said.\n\n\u201cWe cannot continue with this endless delay,\u201d he added.", "description": "A snap election looks certain after Jeremy Corbyn said he would back Prime Minister Boris Johnson's bill calling for a December 12th vote.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Boris-Johnson-5-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
