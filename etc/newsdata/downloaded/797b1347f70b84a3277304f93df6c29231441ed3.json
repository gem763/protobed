Things took a poignant turn, however, when they delivered an emotional speech reflecting on their recent strides toward living authentically as a genderqueer and nonbinary person.\n\nIn September, Smith announced they were embracing the gender neutral pronouns \u201cthey\u201d and \u201cthem.\u201d Prior to that announcement, the 27-year-old had been speaking about their gender identity in greater detail in various interviews.\n\nDuring their speech on Wednesday, Smith wiped away tears and described the moment as \u201coverwhelming.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe last year has been a wild ride of self-realization and has almost felt like a second coming out,\u201d they said. \u201cThe reason I\u2019ve been able to show all of the sides of myself to the public and express myself in these ways is because I felt incredibly safe.\u201d\n\nSmith went on to thank a number of high-profile LGBTQ community members, including writer Tom Rasmussen and transgender model Munroe Bergdorf, for offering support throughout their journey.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s live as loudly and queerly as humanly possible,\u201d Smith added.\n\nThe singer-songwriter\u2019s newfound confidence has already impacted their music. Earlier this week, they teased fans on Instagram, showing themself at work in the studio.\n\nSpeaking to \u201cThe Zach Sang Show\u201d on Tuesday, they said their next album would delve further into the dance-oriented sound of their latest single, \u201cHow Do You Sleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like I have recently shown people a side of me which I normally keep to myself or for my family and friends,\u201d Smith said on the radio show. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s almost given me permission to kinda do what I\u2019ve always dreamed of doing but I was always scared to do, which is pop music. I love pop music so much.\u201d\n\nWatch Sam Smith\u2019s full Attitude Awards speech below.", "description": "Speaking at the Virgin Atlantic Attitude Awards, the four-time Grammy winner pledged to live \"as loudly and queerly as humanly possible.\"", "authors": ["Senior Culture Reporter"], "top_image": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d9f8df2210000c307343d71.jpeg?cache=8cfsq7j4ca&ops=1778_1000", "published_at": "2019-10-10"}
