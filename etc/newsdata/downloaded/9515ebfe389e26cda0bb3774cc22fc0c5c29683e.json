Searches of Frazee\u2019s ranch outside the town of Florissant and at a nearby landfill failed to turn up the victim\u2019s remains, police said.\n\nKenney pleaded guilty in February to evidence tampering and as part of a plea bargain agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. In a court filing, Frazee\u2019s court-appointed lawyers indicated that they may blame Kenney for the slaying by naming her as an alternate suspect.\n\nKaylee has been placed in the temporary custody of Berreth\u2019s parents who have filed a federal wrongful death lawsuit against Frazee, claiming that he murdered their daughter to gain sole custody of the girl.\n\nThe criminal trial is docketed to last three weeks, and opening statements are tentatively set for Friday, a court spokesman said.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Keith Coffman; editing by Bill Tarrantand Leslie Adler)", "description": "Jury selection started on Monday in the murder trial of a Colorado man accused of beating to death his fianc\u00e9e with a baseball bat and burning the young mother\u2019s body, which has never been found.
