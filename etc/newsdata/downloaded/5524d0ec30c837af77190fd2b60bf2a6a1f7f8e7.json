He\u2019ll slap down liberal reporters to their faces. He\u2019ll tweet. He\u2019ll hold rallies. And all of this against insane odds. The Democrat-media complex is vast, well-financed, organized, and merciless. They control the cultural centers of the country. It\u2019s an uphill battle, but Trump always finds a way to find a seam and get under the Left\u2019s skin.\n\nRight now, Capitol Hill is engulfed with impeachment fever over a phone call Trump had with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. He allegedly threatened to shake down the Ukrainian leader into investigating Hunter Biden and his lucrative board position at an energy company, despite having zero experience in this line of work. The allegation is that he was there selling access. Trump threatened to withhold aid unless there was a probe, but a transcript of the phone call totally debunked these ludicrous allegations of quid pro quo. A whistleblower, who is reportedly a CIA agent, made the complaint, but House Democrats moved forward with their impeachment push before this document was released to members of Congress. This whistleblower also didn\u2019t listen in on the call, and most of the complaint is inaccurate and based on second-hand sources. It\u2019s trash.\n\nLOOK AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH! pic.twitter.com/QQYTqG4KTt \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 2, 2019\n\nIS THIS REAL LIFE \u2014 Caleb SkHull ?????? (@CalebJHull) October 2, 2019\n\nYet, while the media has also had a full-court press on Trump, he\u2019s one to expect that; these people hate him. But they also have been asking Joe Biden about his son\u2019s Ukraine ties, which did not go over well. And yes, even when this arrangement was being hashed out under the Obama administration, officials were worried about a conflict of interest issue. It\u2019s something to look into for sure. And Biden\u2019s statement that he pretty much didn\u2019t know what was going on has been blown up. Trump had some fun with it, using Nickelback\u2019s Photograph to torch the notion that Sleepy Joe didn\u2019t know about Hunter\u2019s dealings. There\u2019s a\u2026photo of Joe, Hunter, and two Ukrainian gas executives playing golf. I\u2019m sure they were just discussing yoga and grandkids.", "description": ".10/03/2019 3:15:47AM EST.", "authors": ["Matt Vespa", "Beth Baumann"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/269/1ae8ba40-ff26-4ff3-8f42-ceea942d7999.png"}
