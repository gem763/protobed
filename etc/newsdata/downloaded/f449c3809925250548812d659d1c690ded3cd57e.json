It feels like we gave Wolves the three points.\n\n\u201cWe know that all the points we have dropped this season we didn\u2019t drop because the opponent was so much better, we dropped them because of us. We were guilty for these dropped points. That is the main part and that hurts so much.\n\nWolves condemned City to their second defeat of the season (Nick Potts/PA)\n\n\u201cEven though we have created chances we didn\u2019t score and when you concede the first goal it is difficult to come back from that.\u201d\n\nCity, with Fernandinho and Nicolas Otamendi again paired in defence, were sloppy at the back and were lucky not to trail at the break. Misplaced passes presented Wolves with three gilt-edged openings in the first half but they could not capitalise.\n\nIt seemed they could pay for their profligacy as City stepped up in the second half and hit the bar through David Silva, but the visitors remained resolute and pounced twice late on.\n\nBoth goals were similar as Raul Jimenez broke to play in Traore for his first goals for over a year, the Spaniard twice slipping the ball past Ederson in cool fashion.\n\nWolves did not play like a side that had previously won only one Premier League game this season, nor did they seem fatigued after their Europa League trip to Turkey on Thursday.\n\nMexican forward Jimenez felt the team were getting back to the formula that served them so well last season.\n\nJimenez said: \u201cWe had a great performance. We think we did it well. We did the things that last season made us be top of the league. We have to continue like this for the next match.\n\n\u201cWe knew that City is a game that, when they have the ball, they leave some spaces when they are attacking.\n\nWalking into work this morning...\n\n\n\n\ud83d\udeb6\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\ude06 pic.twitter.com/CXKIxIWekJ \u2014 Wolves (@Wolves) October 7, 2019\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have too much time to plan the game because last Thursday we were playing in Turkey and we had two days for rest.\n\n\u201cSo it was just the things that we know, the things that we are good doing and just we made it.\n\n\u201cIn the first half I think we had some opportunities to score but the things happen for something and we were good enough to do it in the second half.\u201d", "description": "The champions find themselves eight points adrift of leaders Liverpool after losing to Wolves at the weekend.", "authors": ["Press Association"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/07/12/wire-19393408-1570448627-690_636x382.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
