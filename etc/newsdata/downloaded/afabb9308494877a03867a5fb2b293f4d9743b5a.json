While the central bank is optimistic of some recovery in the economy in upcoming quarters, there are signs the employment outlook may continue to deteriorate.\n\nAnalysts are closely watching Singapore\u2019s net employment data, job vacancies, average monthly earnings, and unemployment rates. Here\u2019s a look at what the labor-market gauges tell us about the outlook:\n\nNet Employment Outlook\n\nAmong 669 hiring managers in Singapore, attitudes toward the employment outlook in the final three months of the year are at their most pessimistic since the third quarter of 2017, according to the most recent ManpowerGroup survey released in September.\n\nThe difference between those saying staff numbers will increase in the fourth quarter versus those predicting a decrease is a slim 5 percentage points, the data show. Respondents in the manufacturer sector, which has been especially hard hit by the U.S.-China trade war, expect the weakest performance in a decade, according to Lee Ju Ye, an economist at Maybank Kim Eng Research Pte Ltd.\n\nJob Vacancies\n\nSelena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in Singapore, has her eyes on the job vacancy-to-unemployed ratio. DBS Group Holdings Ltd.\u2019s Irvin Seah and Maybank\u2019s Lee also closely track this gauge.\n\nThe measure slipped below 1 in the second quarter for the first time since the end of 2017, showing the city state\u2019s jobless outnumbered open roles.\n\n\u201cThe job vacancy-to-unemployed person ratio is key to me and it has dipped below parity, suggesting a softening in the labor market,\u201d said Seah.\n\nAverage Monthly Earnings\n\nPaychecks also have been feeling the pinch, at least through the first half of this year. Average monthly earnings rose 2.1% in the three months through June, the slowest pace since the start of 2017.\n\nUnemployment Rates\n\nTwo unemployment rates tracked in Singapore -- one for citizens, and the other for citizens and permanent residents -- have been on the rise for the past few quarters. While still below their post-recession peaks, neither measure has seen a quarterly decline in almost two years and each has been worsening of late.\n\nRetrenchments\n\nRetrenchments climbed to 2,900 in the third quarter, after easing in the previous three months, according to advanced quarterly data released last week. The biggest losses were in the services industries, although manufacturing and construction also saw job cuts.\n\nThe Ministry of Manpower will provide more detailed information about retrenchments in an upcoming report, including whether terminations among professionals, managers, executives, and technicians -- or PMETs -- rose again in the quarter.\n\nThat\u2019s a cause for worry for Seah.\n\n\u201cI look at the PMET share of retrenchment because this is the most vulnerable segment in the market,\u201d he said before the advance quarterly report was released. \u201cThis is against conventional wisdom as most people assume that the lower-wage workers are more prone to retrenchment, which is not the case in Singapore.\u201d\n\nRe-Entry Duration\n\nLing is also tracking how fast retrenched workers find new jobs, which offers more bleak news.\n\nThe government tallies the share of retrenched who return to employment within six months, for any given quarter. That \u201cre-entry\u201d rate dropped sharply to 59.9% as of the second quarter, with those with \u201cdiploma and professional qualifications\u201d declining to 57.7% from 70.9% in the first quarter.", "description": "Singapore\u2019s Labor Market Is Showing Strain as Economy Slows", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pica8d8f23953326e27bea51a204236955f.png", "published_at": "2019-10-28"}
