We say over and over that al-Hol is a ticking time bomb and [an] Isis academy. The world watches but does nothing,\u201d he said this week, adding that guns and other weapons had been smuggled into the camp.\n\nThe outbreak of violence comes as a group of British MPs calls for the government to take greater responsibility for UK Isis suspects being held in the camp.\n\nA cross-party delegation from both Houses of Parliament, which visited the SDF-controlled territory in northeast Syria last month, said in a statement that holding tens of thousands of prisoners is \u201cbeyond the capacity\u201d of local authorities.\n\nAmong the representatives were Lloyd Russell-Moyle MP, former Foreign Affairs Select Committee members Crispin Blunt MP, Adam Holloway MP and Lord Maurice Glasman.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is substantial and immediate,\u201d they said in a joint statement following a four-day visit. \u201cFailure to prioritise this would be international security negligence of the first order.\u201d\n\nIndependent news email Only the best news in your inbox Enter your email address Continue Continue Please enter an email address Email address is invalid Fill out this field Email address is invalid Email already exists.

In one account, a Kurdish official told AFP that Isis women had killed a woman after sentencing her to death in a \u201ccourt\u201d.\n\nA gunfight broke out when guards tried to intervene, which left another woman dead. In another incident, Doctors Without Borders said four women were injured by gunfire after guards confronted a protest. Local media later reported that a young man named Abdullah Ahmad was killed by Isis-sympathising women. It was unclear what the motive was.\n\nThe outbreak of violence this week is not the first time the alarm has been raised about conditions in the camp.\n\nIn an interview with The Independent earlier this year, Major General Alexus Grynkewich, deputy commander of the international anti-Isis coalition, described the potential for radicalisation in the camps as \u201cthe biggest long-term strategic risk\u201d in the fight against the jihadi group outside of ongoing military operations.\n\n\u201cThe anecdotal stories we have about some of the women with their children who were surrendering, if you will, is that there are hardcore Isis ideologues among them. We certainly have seen reporting from some of the partners who work in those camps that there is a fair amount of that ideology,\u201d he said.\n\nAl-Hol is the largest of a number of camps housing the families of Isis fighters. It has a population just shy of 70,000 people \u2013 mostly women and children from Syria and Iraq, together with about 9,000 foreign citizens.\n\nNearly half of its inhabitants are children under the age of 12. They will have been subjected to years of indoctrination under Isis, which may be continuing to this day.\n\nJournalists and humanitarian workers who have visited the camp have reported seeing women shouting Isis slogans, and there have been a number of attacks by alleged Isis sympathisers against other residents for not adhering to the group\u2019s strict religious rules. In July, a female foreign Isis detainee reportedly stabbed a Kurdish guard in the back, sparking an evacuation of NGO workers.\n\nThe international community has struggled to find an answer to the question of what to do with the thousands of residents of al-Hol, and a number of smaller camps in the country.\n\nForeign governments have shown little willingness to take back their citizens from the camps over fears they will pose a significant security risk. There are thought to be at least 19 British women currently at al-Hol, and camps Roj and Ain Issa, together with at least 30 of their children. Shamima Begum was moved to Roj from al-Hol, and the British government has removed her citizenship and said she will not be allowed to return home.", "description": "A detention camp holding thousands of Isis families in Syria is becoming increasingly unstable as women who remain loyal to the group have tried to continue its reign of terror after the fall of the \u201ccaliphate\u201d.", "authors": ["Richard Hall"], "top_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/04/01/10/gettyimages-1133283142.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-04"}
