Impeach Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nThe entrepreneur sat down with the ladies of ABC\u2019s \u201cThe View\u201d to discuss his campaign and the current political climate when he was asked about the possible impeachment of Mr. Trump.\n\nMr. Yang offered support for starting the impeachment process, given what he\u2019s heard about the president\u2019s private conversations with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, but he also warned the party of wearing de facto impeachment blinders.\n\n\u201cThis is the trap,\u201d Mr. Yang said Thursday. \u201cAnytime we\u2019re talking about Donald Trump, Donald Trump is winning and Democrats need an affirmative vision that people are just as excited about. Like, if the Democratic message is \u2018Donald Trump: bad. Impeach Donald Trump,\u2019 then we\u2019re actually increasing the chances of him getting a second term.\u201d\n\nThe candidate, a supporter of Universal Basic Income, also discussed his rising popularity and a recent Emerson poll showing him ahead of Sen. Kamala Harris in her home state of California.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re doing so well \u2026 because we\u2019re talking about problems Americans see around them every day,\u201d he told co-host Meghan McCain. \u201cThe fact that 30% of our stores and malls are closing because of Amazon \u2014 and Amazon is paying zero in taxes in return \u2014 and when I say that to Americans around the country they see it around them. The fact that we can build an economy that works for us. That vision will help address the problems that got Donald Trump elected in the first place. Americans are very smart. We understand what\u2019s going on around us.\u201d\n\n2020 candidate @AndrewYang says he\u2019s \u201con board with the decision to impeach Donald Trump,\u201d adding it\u2019s \u201cthe right thing to do regardless of the political calculation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a country of laws, you have to enforce the laws.\u201d https://t.co/4P9nADoa3S pic.twitter.com/eviAgY3OVX \u2014 The View (@TheView) September 26, 2019\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
