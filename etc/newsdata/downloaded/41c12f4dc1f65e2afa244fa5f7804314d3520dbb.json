The Bruges Group\u2019s chairman Barry Legg called it a \u201cdefective agreement\u201d, while Fishing for Leave\u2019s Aaron Brown labelled it \u201cBrexit in Name Only\u201d.\n\nChairman of The Bow Group, the UK\u2019s oldest conservative think tank, Ben Harris-Quinney said: \u201cWe were open-minded to a new deal and would support any deal that fulfils the terms of the Brexit vote with Britain leaving the EU in full, as well as both the Single Market and Customs Union.\n\n\u201cThis deal does not do that. Serious concerns remain over Northern Ireland and future regulatory alignment with the EU the UK would be forced to comply to. We oppose this deal and call on conservative and Brexit supporting MPs to vote against it to push for a managed no-deal settlement on October 31st.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday morning, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and president of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker announced that the two sides had agreed on an exit treaty. Later that evening, the EU27 endorsed the deal, and MPs will be voting on it in the House of Commons on Saturday.\n\nThe EU\u2019s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier outlined some of the arrangements for dealing with the Irish border issue: Northern Ireland will be part of a \u201climited\u201d set of EU rules related to goods, and while remaining in the UK\u2019s customs territory, would be an entry point into the EU\u2019s Single Market. What would be of significant objection to the DUP is that that the party has lost its veto over whether new Northern Ireland arrangements come into force.\n\nBiggest Poll Since EU Referendum Shows Big Public Majority for Honouring Brexit Vote https://t.co/eeExQyIDPW \u2014 Breitbart London (@BreitbartLondon) October 18, 2019\n\nWhile some Eurosceptics may have softened to the deal \u2014 in preference over a clean-break Brexit \u2014 the Northern Irish DUP has said it was \u201cunable to support these proposals in parliament\u201d, adding they \u201cundermine the integrity of the union\u201d.\n\nDUP MP Sammy Wilson called on his Conservative colleagues to \u201ctake a stand for the Union and join us in rejecting this deal. Internal and burdensome trade barriers will be erected within the UK without parallel consent from both unionists and nationalists. This is not Brexit.\u201d\n\nMr Harris-Quinney continued in the statement that the Bow Group believes the proposed deal \u201cfails to achieve sovereign independence of all the United Kingdom whilst committing to send in excess of \u00a339 billion to the EU\u201d.\n\nThe think tank also warned that the Political Declaration \u2014 which sets out the future relationship between the UK and EU \u2014 opens up the UK to regulatory alignment with the bloc as well as military cooperation, spending commitments, and abiding by Brussels\u2019 financial regulations \u201cwhich would potentially allow the EU and our parliament to further neuter Brexit\u201d.\n\n\u201cA no-deal Brexit remains the closest to honouring the Brexit vote and preventing its overturning by an unrepresentative parliament. That is the cause Brexiteer and conservative MPs should be committed to. The Bow Group, The Bruges Group, and Fishing for Leave call on them to listen to the people outside of Westminster and do so,\u201d he concluded.", "description": "Leading conservative and pro-Brexit think tanks have called on MPs to vote against Boris Johnson's \"defective\" withdrawal deal on Saturday.", "authors": ["Victoria Friedman"], "top_image": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/10/Brexit-Now-640x335.png", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
