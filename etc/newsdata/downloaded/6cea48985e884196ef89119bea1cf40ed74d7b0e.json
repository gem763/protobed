It really puts a smile on your face, says Ray\n\nThe new McLaren GT is the fourth and latest car in the British firm\u2019s Track25 business plan which will will see \u00a31.2bn invested in 18 news models and derivatives with a view to helping it remain a strong and independent part of the McLaren Group.\n\nThe new GT is powered by McLaren\u2019s powerful new 4.0 litre twin-turbo V8 petrol engine which develops a hefty 620 horse-power, equivalent to six Ford Fiestas.\n\nWill it fit in my garage? New McLaren GT Built: Woking, England Price: From \u00a3163,000 My car as driven: \u00a3201,650 Engine: M840TE 4.0 litre twin-turbo V8 (3994cc) Power: 620 PS Transmission: 7-speed seamless shift gearbox (SSG). Modes: Comfort, Sport and Track. Top speed: 203mph 0-60mph: 3.1 seconds 0-62mph (100km/hr): 3.2 seconds 0-124mp (200km/hr): 9.0 seconds 0-1/4 mile (400m): 11.0 seconds Braking performance: 124mph-0: 127 metres/ 417 feet 62mph-0: 32 metres / 105 feet CO2 emissions: 270g/km (WLTP) Average Fuel consumption: 23.7 mpg (WLTP) (I averaged 17.5mpg). Fuel tank capacity: 72 litres (15.8 UK gallons) Grand Touring range: 374 miles Dimensions Length: 4683mm (184.4 inches) Width: Mirrors in place: 2095mm (82.5 inches) Mirrors folded: 2045mm (80.5 inches) One door open: 2690mm (1059 inches) Both doors open: 3286mm (129 inches) Weight: 1530kg Underbody clearance: 110mm (130mm with vehicle lift). Designed to beat \u2018aggressive\u2019 traffic calming Chassis: Carbon-fibre single cell monocoque, with carbon-fibre upper rear structure and aluminium crash structures. Brakes: Cast-iron discs and calipers. Optional carbon ceramic discs with forged Wheels: Pirelli PZero tyres: 20-inch front, 21 inch rear. Dashboard: 7-inch high resolution infotainment screen/ 12.3 inch instrument cluster Luggage capacity: Front: 150 litres Rear: 420 litres Total: 570 litres\n\nThis is linked to a smooth but slick automatic 7-speed seamless shift gearbox (SSG) with manual over-ride paddles tucked behind a mercifully uncluttered-by-buttons steering wheel.\n\nThere are three settings. \u2018rack is self-explanatory and really only for use off-road on a race circuit.\n\nComfort proved perfect for tootling through town and through villages at low speed without feeling that the car is straining at the leash to break away, with ride height, ground clearance, tailored for urban conditions including coping with speed-bumps and other traffic calming measures,\n\nA pro-active damping control suspension system uses sensors to \u2019read\u2019 the road ahead, interpret what will happen next and react predictively within two milliseconds. Hydraulic steering also helps comfort and confidence.\n\nBut Sport mode is where the fun-factor really kicked in for me on gloriously serpentine mountain roads. On the tightest of turns the GT grips the road with impeccable balance, poise, imparting supreme confidence in its road-holding ability. It really puts a smile on your face.\n\nOvertaking is also made much easier with a burst of instant speed on those too infrequent straight stretches when a convoy of three holiday homes really does need to be passed with acceleration from rest to 60mph in just 3.1 seconds (0-62mph in 3.2 seconds), and up to 124mph ( I never got to that on a public road) in 9.0 seconds, covering a quarter of a mile in 11.0 seconds.\n\nBut the figures don\u2019t really do justice to the planted, balanced and fun feeling of driving the car on a long journey. There\u2019s launch control, if you must, for a really flying start.\n\nPlaying with the paddles you also get a wonderful soundtrack from the exhaust as you kick down though the gears on a hairpin bend then blast off again down the open highway or through a mountain tunnel.\n\nI was transported back to my childhood and felt like the late Sir Roger Moore \u2013 between his outings in the Saint and the Bond movies \u2013 in the opening scenes of the \u201870s adventure series The Persuader, playing aristocratic Lord Brett Sinclair, racing in his yellow Aston Martin DBS against his American co-star Tony Curtis playing rough-diamond rags-to-riches entrepreneur Danny Wilde in his red Ferrari Dino.\n\nSuch performance requires hefty stopping power with brakes that will slow down the car from 124mph to dead stop in 127 metres (417 feet) and from 62mph in 32 metres (105 feet).\n\nThey certainly do the job but need a firmer press than I\u2019d expected, so perhaps some light finessing in order on the final production cars.\n\nAverage fuel consumption is a meagre 23.7 mpg (on the new \u2018real word\u2019 WLTP measure), though my own spirited driving brought that down to just 17.5mpg, with official CO2 emissions a high 270g/km that will have green campaigners wincing.\n\nHowever, a fuel tank capacity of 72 litres (15.8 UK gallons) gives a theoretical grand touring range of 374 miles between fill-ups.\n\nBut even at the cheapest supermarket prices, you\u2019re looking at around \u00a390 per fill-up when using standard unleaded, never mind the more expensive higher octanes.\n\nClever design of the rearward extending tear-drop shaped cabin, means there\u2019s a surprising amount of space for luggage totalling 570 litres. Up front under the bonnet there\u2019s a deep and wide area of 150 litres big enough for two overnight bags which swallowed easily both my travel and computer bag.\n\nThe rear storage spreads 420 litres under the long, glass tailgate like a shallow ski-slope that rises in a gentle gradient from the back, over the low-riding mid-engine area, before dipping down again right up to the back of the two driver and passenger seats. But with judicious placing of bags and lying them flat, you can pack a fair bit \u2013 including a pair of skis or a golf bag and clubs - without obscuring the view through the rear mirror. There are also cross-straps to hold bags and coats in place.\n\nThere are three trim levels: Standard, Pioneer and Luxe and a choice of 16 standard colours, five of which are new for the GT.\n\nAverage fuel consumption is a meagre 23.7 mpg (on the new \u2018real word\u2019 WLTP measure), though Ray's more spirited driving brought that down to just 17.5mpg\n\nThere are three trim levels: Standard, Pioneer and Luxe and a choice of 16 standard colours, five of which are new for the GT\n\nThe rear storage spreads 420 litres under the long, glass tailgate like a shallow ski-slope that rises in a gentle gradient from the back, over the low-riding mid-engine area\n\nYou\u2019ll certainly save on your gym membership because getting in and out is a great test of your agility and a work-out for your abs as you negotiate the space left by the uplifted winged door. The electronic buttons on the sumptuous sports seats also take a bit of getting used to as you have to do it all with a sense of touch as they are out of sight.\n\nIt takes a bit of getting used to. But if, as McLaren hope, this is your \u2018everyday car, then it will soon become intuitive. But once inside and settled in behind the wheel it is \u2018ab fab.\u2019\n\nMcLaren GT luggage McLaren offers a full set of bespoke luggage items starting from \u00a31,700 for the semi-aniline leather garment case with a soft grey lining featuring the McLaren logo and a metal clothes hanger. A \u2018weekend bag\u2019 will set you back \u00a31,850 and a cabin bag \u00a32,800 But keen golfers will have to pay \u00a35,000 for the full-sized McLaren golf bag - and that\u2019s without the clubs.\n\nLike all supercars, it\u2019s not a cheap proposition. The new GT is priced from \u00a3163,000 (including VAT). However the car I drove was loaded up with a lot of extras which bumped the final price up by \u00a338,650 to \u00a3201,650.\n\nThe fetching Burnished Copper paint was a \u00a34,000 addition, 15-spoke forged alloy wheels added \u00a32,750, the sports exhaust \u00a33,400.\n\nThe electro-chromic panoramic roof. which you can lighten or darken in five stages from transparent to opaque like sunglasses to keep cool inside, was \u00a34,950 with privacy glass another \u00a3500. A solid roof is standard with a normal glass panoramic roof also an option.\n\nThe \u00a39,900 Luxe pack has a NASA-designed super-tough and easy to clean \u2018SuperFabric\u2019 luggage bay floor liner; power-adjusted and heated memory comfort seats; power-adjusted steering column; soft-grain Analine and leather interior, and piano gloss black interior surrounds.\n\nThe \u00a33,750 Practicality Pack adds items including a rear view camera, front and rear parking sensors, electrically folding and heated door mirrors.\n\nThe \u00a34,900 Premium Pack adds full LED headlights, premium Bowers & Wilkins 12 speaker audio system, powered opening and closing glazed soft-close rear tailgate, cabin air and pollen filtration.\n\nAnd a \u00a34,500 MSO (McLaren Special Operations) bright pack adds \u2018bling\u2019 for wheels, exhaust and exterior window surrounds.\n\nYou\u2019ll certainly save on your gym membership because getting in and out is a great test of your agility and a work-out for your abs as you negotiate the space left by the uplifted winged door\n\nThe interior is typically McLaren, with a button-laden centre console and a single portrait-mounted screen in the dashboard", "description": "McLaren stress that this is the their first true venture into the grand tourer market and that the new near 4.7m long GT is therefore arguably their most useable and engaging everyday car.", "authors": ["Ray Massey For Mailonline And Thisismoney", "Some Links In This Article May Be Affiliate Links.
