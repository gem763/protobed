But worse than squabbling amongst inebriated guests is the financial strain the happy day foists on whoever\u2019s paying for it \u2013 in my case, me.\n\nPolitics of love: The bitter wranglings of weddings mean the most romantic day of a couple's life is embroiled in the internal politics of the family\n\nOn average brides and grooms splash an obscene \u00a321,000 to say their nuptials in style. Romance comes at a price often out of reach from the average Joe\u2019s purse strings. It\u2019s cheaper to fly across the world to a tacky chapel than to have a comparatively \u2018small\u2019 wedding in the UK. And by small I don\u2019t mean a dozen guests \u2013 more like five or ten times that.\n\nEven despite bitter years of recession, wedding prices have soared to new extremes. Take marquees for example\u2026 tents perfect for frustrated happy campers. To sit in a drafty canvass tepee costs around \u00a35,000. Not for food and crockery\u2026 just empty space. Weddings really are a racket.\n\n\n\nWhile the wealthy couple may justify expenses such as these in their \u00a321,000 budget, normaltons gawp at the liberties taken because of the \u2018w\u2019 word. Maybe if the Government subsidised wedding reception costs, more of us would be happy to endorse Cameron\u2019s pro-marriage mantra!\n\nThis is the sad truth. There are so many couples out there, both with and without kids, who would like to say \u2018I will\u2019 in front of families and friends but who are put off by expense. Who in their right mind if strapped for cash would pick a wedding over a mortgage deposit for a house? The romantic in us may, but the practical part of us wouldn\u2019t.\n\nCostly: Many couples, both with and without kids, are put off by expense of a modern wedding, which costs \u00a321,000 on average\n\nAnd this is my dilemma\u2026 should I have waited those ten, twenty long years to save up enough to buy a house and then marry later after many stretch marks and kids\u2026 or marry now and worry about the financial implications later? Now is a good time to buy a house, if only you can. Am I going to have to rent forever because I put all the money I have into my wedding? By the time I have saved up again the housing market may have recovered so much that I can\u2019t afford anything \u2013 but I suppose the Chancellor might help me out on that score if he keeps up his current lousy performance.\n\nSo we decided to do it now, heart overruling head, but have had to badger our talented relatives to pay in kind-ness. So the clever organist, event planners, graphic designers, bakers and chefs in our families have been signed up for project get-this-wedding-off-the-ground-without-bankrupting-us-at-the-same-time. Voluntarily though of course!\n\nThe problem though is not so much the money side of it, but the expectation. The feeling is that if you are going to get married, you have to \u2018do it properly\u2019 \u2013 and all that entails. The only ones really benefitting are the suppliers who can add a zero to their quotes when they know it\u2019s for a wedding. You can of course pay \u00a350 for your marriage licence but the days of simple, no-fuss ceremonies have almost died out. Instead the bridal industry has created a monster, craving wedding d\u00e9cor galore, Jimmy Choos, gourmet menus and stretched limousines.\n\nThese bridezillas stalk wedding fair after wedding fair in their hunt for the next new fad at whatever price (it\u2019s OK \u2013 daddy/credit card/wealthy fianc\u00e9 will pay). Expectations of the day are as high as Everest. 12ft chocolate fountains, manor houses, gaudy rings and honeymoons in the Seychelles are must-haves \u2013 and they all share their clich\u00e9d \u2018princess for a day\u2019 dream.\n\nThey are boastful bores, who think that the only value of anything is monetary. Well frankly I for one resent having to pay through the nose for my nuptials, and I don\u2019t feel the need to brag about how much stuff cost. It\u2019s pathetic and vulgar \u2013 and that comes from someone without much money before you get any ideas! It\u2019s about love, ladies, not pound signs, and I don\u2019t care if your dress cost \u00a350 or \u00a35,000 as long as it looks good.\n\nSo much to do with modern weddings is posturing, keeping-up-with-the-joneses nonsense. People will happily borrow money to pay for the grotesque trappings of the modern \u2018celebrity\u2019-influenced ceremony, when we should all live within our means and remember what it\u2019s really about \u2013 two people pledging themselves to each other for the rest of their lives.\n\nFortunately there are still some romantics out there, if you look hard enough, so maybe McCartney was right all along. Can\u2019t Buy Me Love, everybody tells me so\u2026\n\n\n\n", "description": "FRANCESCA PREECE: Getting married is not about paying for a lavish ceremony. Maybe McCartney was right all along...
