That was the law which required him to write the extension letter if parliament had not approved either a deal or a no-deal exit by Oct. 19.\n\nAnti-Brexit campaigners had asked the court earlier this month for it either to issue an order forcing Johnson to ask for a delay or for it to instruct that a letter be sent to the EU on his behalf if he refused.\n\nThe campaigners also said he should face penalties including a fine or even prison if he did not comply with the Benn Act.\n\nThe court, has not yet ruled on the matter and was waiting to do so pending developments up to Oct. 19. But it said this month that government lawyers had given formal legal statements - averments - that he would abide by the Benn Act and it would be a serious matter if he did not.\n\n\u201cIt would be destructive of one of the core principles of constitutional propriety and of the mutual trust that is the bedrock of the relationship between the court and the crown for the prime minister or the government to renege on what they have assured the court that the prime minister intends to do,\u201d judge Paul Cullen, known as Lord Pentland, said.\n\nOpposition lawmakers said that by writing two letters, Johnson had broken his government\u2019s pledge to the court not to frustrate the legislation.\n\n\u201cHe may well be in contempt of parliament or the courts themselves because he\u2019s clearly trying to undermine the first letter,\u201d Labour\u2019s finance spokesman John McDonnell told Sky News.\n\nLabour\u2019s Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer told BBC television Johnson was \u201cbeing childlike\u201d, adding \u201cI am sure there will be court proceedings\u201d.\n\nTUESDAY? BREXIT LEGISLATION\n\nJohnson told parliament that \u201cnext week the government will introduce the legislation needed for us to leave the EU with our new deal on October 31\u201d. It is widely expected to have its first main stage of debate on Tuesday.\n\nSenior minister Michael Gove said on Sunday the government would seek to get the legislation required through parliament in order to get Brexit done and leave the EU on Oct. 31. Gove and foreign minister Dominic Raab said they believed the government had the numbers to pass a deal.\n\nFormer minister Amber Rudd, who quit the government over Johnson\u2019s willingness to pursue a no-deal Brexit, said she and most of the 21 Conservative lawmakers who were kicked out of the parliamentary party for backing attempts to block a no-deal exit, would support the legislation.\n\n\u201cHe has a fragile but sincere coalition of people who want to support it,\u201d she told Sky News.\n\nLawmakers will have the opportunity to bring changes to the legislation and Labour\u2019s Starmer and McDonnell said on Sunday the party would put forward amendments including on issues such as protecting worker\u2019s rights and closing the \u201ctrap door\u201d to a no-deal Brexit at the end of a transition period in December 2020.\n\nChanges proposed by lawmakers are also likely to include the need for a confirmatory referendum on the agreement. That would throw open the possibility of Brexit not even happening - although it is not clear whether there would be sufficient numbers among lawmakers to back such a plan.\n\nEU RESPONSE TO DELAY REQUEST\n\nThe chairman of European Union leaders, Donald Tusk, said on Saturday he had received the extension request and he would now be consulting with EU capitals on how to react.\n\nAfter a short meeting on Sunday, diplomats with the bloc said the EU would play for time rather than rush to decide on the delay request.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking for more clarity towards the end of the week, hoping that by that time we will also see how things develop in London,\u201d one senior EU diplomat said.\n\nLeaders of the 27 states that will make up the EU once Britain leaves are unlikely to deny the extension request.\n\nGove said the EU was \u201cwaiting to see what parliament does now\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll have an opportunity in the days ahead to consider the legislation that allows us to leave the European Union. If people vote for that legislation (..) then we can leave and we can leave in time,\u201d he said.\n\nELECTION?\n\nBoth the governing Conservatives and main opposition Labour Party say they want a new election, but Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he will not back any move to hold one until a no-deal Brexit is ruled out.\n\n\u201cAn election is inevitable because of the numbers in parliament, because we have got to break the impasse, the timing will be a matter for Jeremy Corbyn ... but it is inevitable that sooner or later this breaks into a general election,\u201d said Starmer.", "description": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson has sent an unsigned letter to the European Union requesting a delay to Britain's exit from the bloc, as well as a second note saying he did not want a \"deeply corrosive\" Brexit extension.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Piper", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191020&t=2&i=1442981615&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9J0C4", "published_at": "2019-10-20"}
