He is 28 now, ice-cold calm and without the delusions too many men drag with them to fights they have been selected to lose. Big Otto will be a better fighter, win or lose, after he meets Fury.\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true. You can form your own view. From 15p \u20ac0.18 $0.18 USD 0.27 a day, more exclusives, analysis and extras.\n\nThis is Fury\u2019s final outing before a planned trio of big fights next year, a triple that looks increasingly, in this modern business of shifting allegiances and endless claims, like a fantasy sequence; Fury fights and beats Deontay Wilder in February, gives the American a rematch in July and then fights either Anthony Joshua or Andy Ruiz late next year. It looks ridiculous, but stranger things have happened and there is certainly a growing feeling of discontent at fights that matter not getting made.\n\nThere is no simple solution to the uncertainty and conflict of the heavyweight division, a division wrapped in spirits and folklore, but a series of real fights will certainly help. \u201cI have the fights signed and sealed - they will happen,\u201d insisted Fury. \u201cI hope Wilder accepts the third fight.\u201d Wilder is meant to fight in November, a dangerous rematch with Luis Ortiz, and that fight is starting to look less and less likely. The rematch with Fury, this time in Las Vegas, is done, made, signed.\n\nShape Created with Sketch.

September top 10 pound-for-pound boxers in the world 1/11 Who is the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world? The ranking of The Independent's 10 best male boxers on the planet. Take a look through to see who comes out on top. AP 2/11 10. Manny Pacquiao (62-7-2) The Filipino looked sensational to outpoint Keith Thurman, flooring the American and rolling back the years at 40 years old to confirm himself as the No 3 welterweight in the world at worst. Considering the illustrious names on his resume, a place inside the top 10 pound-for-pound list and a world class win this year confirms his place here. AP 3/11 9. Juan Francisco Estrada (39-3-0) The two-weight world champion grabbed the lineal super flyweight title against Sor Rungvisai to snatch his pound-for-pound status and the WBC gold. Getty Images 4/11 8. Mikey Garcia (39-1-0) Despite coming up short against Errol Spence in their welterweight bout, Garcia is still a modern great as a four-weight world champion. Getty Images 5/11 7. Gennady Golovkin (38-1-1) Despite suffering the first loss of his career against Canelo Alvarez, Golovkin's stellar career keeps him in our rankings. Getty Images 6/11 6. Errol Spence (25-0-0) After his impressive win over Garcia in which he didn't drop a round, Spence added another big name to his record. Shawn Porter will be next, to unify the belts and perhaps further close the gap between himself and rival Terence Crawford in the P4P standings. Getty Images 7/11 5. Oleksandr Usyk (16-0-0) The undisputed, undefeated, unified cruiserweight world champion moves up in weight, but injury has delayed his debut against Carlos Takam. Getty Images 8/11 4. Naoya Inoue (18-0-0) The man nicknamed the 'monster' destroyed Emmanuel Rodriguez in two rounds to win the IBF world bantamweight title, elevating his status as one of the world's most dangerous fighters. Getty Images 9/11 3. Terence Crawford (35-0-0) Another three-weight world champion, Crawford enters our top three and reaffirmed his place as one of the sport's greats after a knockout win against Amir Khan. Getty Images 10/11 2. Canelo Alvarez (52-1-2) One loss and a whole heap of controversy but Canelo's record is one to be celebrated, a three-weight world champion and still just 28. The biggest star in the sport and an impressive win over Daniel Jacobs cements his standing, arguably has a claim to the throne, but he just misses out here. Getty Images 11/11 1. Vasyl Lomachenko (14-1-0) There can only be one. The king of the amateur game has stepped up to become the king of the professionals. Just 15 fights into his career and despite one career defeat, the current unified lightweight world champion sets records for days. Loma won a world title in his third fight, became a two-weight champion in his seventh, and a three-weight champion in his twelfth fight. The king. Less magic against a brave Luke Campbell, but more brutality, slashing body shots and exquisite balance and movement. Who's next? Commey, Lopez, Davis?

Getty Images\n\nIt has been a strange week here in the middle of the convention calendar, another week where people have continued to fall in love with Fury, his openness, his relentless good spirits. Exhaust and tyre specialists from Idaho have stopped for pictures. Even Wallin and his people have been bemused by Fury\u2019s approach to the fight. It is easy to neglect one of boxing\u2019s old truths about flattery being a danger when Fury walks from love and applause to universal praise. In boxing, especially heavyweight boxing, flattery and delusion, can be as solid in the eager ears of fighters as a bag full of diamonds and gold in their hands. Wallin has to be careful not to be lost in awe and Fury must make sure he remembers the old dangers of a sport he has mastered.\n\nWallin will need to use his southpaw jab, forget Fury\u2019s chin and just find distance by bashing away at the chest and the gloves. Wallin needs to somehow make Fury think, keep switching positions, be mindful of his own chin and at the same time force the fight. It is a bit like asking him to use three hands and three feet at Twister and complete a Rubik\u2019s Cube with his toes at the same time. Wallin does have some strong boxing people in his gang and they should be able to control his emotions once the hour approaches and he is suddenly in a highly volatile place he has never been before.\n\nFury has to look good in a fight that some will be critical of; Fury\u2019s fights in this desert city have been about profile, getting inside American homes, showing the public here what the big lad can do and preparing them for glory next year. Fury looks and sounds nasty to me and I\u2019m not expecting a lot of mercy once the first bell dings. He will win the WBC\u2019s newly minted Mayan belt, having adopted his Mexican disguise to become El Rey de los Gitanos. It is his latest mask.\n\nOn Wednesday night here I met with Gene Kilroy, one of the city\u2019s finest raconteurs and one of the last keepers of boxing\u2019s great oral tradition. Kilroy was Muhammad Ali\u2019s friend, his facilitator and he is the final living member of the inner circle. He was the first man in the ring after the Rumble in the Jungle, carried the coffins at the funerals of Ali\u2019s parents - yeah, Kilroy really was there.\n\nKilroy told me a story, he always tells me a story: When Ali met Jean-Pierre Coopman, The Lion of Flanders, in Puerto Rico for the heavyweight world title in 1976, everybody knew the outcome. Coopman was done in the fifth, his bank balance changed forever, his life never to be the same. \u201cHe\u2019d shared the ring with Ali,\u201d Gene explained. Anyway, at 2am, Ali and Kilroy were in Ali\u2019s hotel room and there was a knock at the door. \u201cYou order room service, Gene?\u201d Ali asked. Kilroy went to the door, opened it and there stood Coopman and his wife, the boxing king and queen of Belgium. Kilroy invited them in. \u201cThank you, thank you,\u201d said Coopman. \u201cYou gave me a chance, you changed my life.\u201d Wallin will be ringing a bell at 2am after the fight - Fury will be accepting the praise.", "description": "Tyson Fury will end his promotional singing, dancing and fighting tour of America here on Saturday night at the T-Mobile Arena with a homage to great Mexican boxers.
