That meant course organizers had to scramble, but American viewers got the benefit of a couple of hours of unexpected golf.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nAs the day began, Woods stood at 18-under, three strokes clear of Hideki Matsuyama and six clear of Rory McIlroy, Gary Woodland and Sungjae Im. But he had the poor fortune to start his round on the 490-yard, par-4 12th, the toughest hole, where he\u2019d bogeyed once and parred twice earlier in the tournament.\n\nWoods bogeyed that hole, allowing Matsuyama to draw within two. Matsuyama missed a short putt on the par-5 14th that would have put him just a single stroke back of Woods. Right after him, on the same hole, Woods rolled in a 10-footer for birdie to reestablish the three-stroke lead. Matsuyama birdied 16, pulling to within two strokes, but missed a long putt on 17 to force the issue. Woods played steady golf the rest of the way in, and never let Matsuyama get too close.\n\n\u201cThis was big,\u201d Woods said afterward. \u201cIt was a lot closer than people probably thought. ... It was definitely stressful.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nAs of 2013, Woods appeared stuck on 79 wins, his last coming at the WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational that year. Multiple surgeries and off-course problems appeared to signal the end of Woods\u2019 career as a winning golfer \u2026 that is, until he won the 2018 Tour Championship and followed that off with a historic victory at the 2019 Masters.\n\nBut that victory in Augusta appeared to have hollowed out Woods; he later indicated that he\u2019d spent so much effort getting back up to the mountaintop that he had nothing left once he was there. He missed the cut in two of the three remaining majors, and finished tied for 21st in the U.S. Open. He bowed out of the FedEx Cup playoffs in August and underwent knee surgery, announcing plans to come back for this tournament in Japan.\n\nWoods began the tournament on an ugly skid: three straight bogeys to open Thursday. But by the end of the day, buoyed by nine birdies over the final 16 holes, he held the lead. He would keep it for the next three days, through storms that threatened to wash out the entire tournament.\n\nWeather delays always play havoc with golfers\u2019 schedules, but this one was stranger than most. An entire day of play was washed out over the weekend, so Woods and several other players checked out an afternoon showing of \u201cJoker\u201d \u2014 and then Woods, Justin Thomas, Jordan Spieth, Gary Woodland, Bubba Watson and Ryan Palmer got stranded in a Domino\u2019s Pizza when the weather was too treacherous for shuttle buses to even drive.\n\nWhat does Woods\u2019 win mean for golf history? Frankly, not all that much. Snead\u2019s mark of 82 wins is a wee bit tricked up. As this article noted a few years back, Snead got credit for some wins he shouldn\u2019t, and didn\u2019t get credit for some that he should. Some of his wins came in shorter-than-54-hole tournaments, others came with partners, still others came with tiny fields of less than 20 players. Woods hit the mark under far more stringent conditions than Snead.\n\nAfter the win, NBC\u2019s Dan Hicks posted a fascinating photo of a young Woods meeting Snead, the who-could-have-imagined aura hanging heavy over the picture:\n\nWhat this win means for Woods is substantial. He\u2019s continuing to prove that he\u2019s still one of the best players on Tour \u2014 not dominant, certainly, but always capable of dominating. This may have been an inaugural tournament, but it was a full-field event, with a full complement of the world\u2019s best players in the field. (Brooks Koepka, who\u2019s one of the few players ever to face down Woods and win, wasn\u2019t in the tournament because of injury.)\n\nGoing forward, Woods still has to decide whether to pick himself as a member of the Presidents Cup team. (\u201cThe player definitely got the captain\u2019s attention,\u201d he smiled.) Beyond that? It\u2019ll be April and time for Woods\u2019 defense of his Masters title before you know it.\n\n\u201cPhysically I can\u2019t do anything that I used to do, four back surgeries and my body can\u2019t do what it used to,\u201d Woods said. \u201cBut I can certainly think my way around a golf course. I don\u2019t hit the ball anywhere near as far compared to the field. ... I know how to play, and I was able to do that this week.\u201d\n\n____\n\nJay Busbee is a writer for Yahoo Sports.
