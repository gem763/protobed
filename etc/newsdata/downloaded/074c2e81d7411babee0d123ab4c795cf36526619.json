I think I\u2019ve always had a desire deep down to experience this and to have an opportunity,\u201d said Smalling, the center back who was dropped from England\u2019s squad ahead of last year\u2019s World Cup. \u201cIt\u2019s something that I really look forward to and I don\u2019t want to live my life with (any) regrets.\n\n\u201cSerie A has always been a goal of mine to play in one day, because as a defender if you get the chance to experience Serie A you want to do it,\u201d Smalling added.\n\nSanchez, a Chile international, began his European career in Italy with Udinese before moving on to Barcelona, Arsenal and United.\n\nFor years, the Premier League has been a destination for top Serie A players and coaches but now coaches are coming back, too.\n\nMaurizio Sarri (at Juventus) and Antonio Conte (Inter) both returned to the Italian league this season after coaching Chelsea, while Carlo Ancelotti, another former Chelsea coach, is in his second season at Napoli.\n\nThe other players who recently moved from the England to Serie A were Danilo (Manchester City to Juventus), Bobby Duncan and Rachid Ghezzal (Liverpool and Leicester, respectively, to Fiorentina), Bobby Adekaye (Liverpool to Lazio), and Ken Sema (Watford to Udinese).\n\nWhile Lukaku has already scored two goals in two matches for Inter, Mkhitaryan and Smalling are expected to make their debuts with Roma against Sassuolo on Sunday.\n\nEven before playing a single match for his new club, Smalling alluded to an extended stay.\n\n\u201cIf it prolongs and the club\u2019s happy,\u201d Smalling said, \u201cthen I can definitely see a longer term future in Italy.\u201d\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nAndrew Dampf on Twitter: www.twitter.com/AndrewDampf\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Romelu Lukaku, Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Aaron Ramsey, Alexis Sanchez, Chris Smalling.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Andrew Dampf"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/italy_soccer_spotlight_epl_influx_90127_c0-174-4348-2709_s1770x1032.jpg?3d2c3b4125f986f6c87863eb5d2435d1325c6fd7", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
