To paraphrase, NCAT ruled that a blanket ban on all pets allowed for no circumstances under which companion animals might be allowed, and was therefore harsh and oppressive.\n\nThe residents who challenged the by-law had argued that recent changes to strata law showed the government wanted apartment residents to be able to have pets.\n\nOne thrust of the committee\u2019s appeal \u2013 apart from legal arguments \u2013 is likely to be that not allowing a building to ban pets is also unreasonable, because it impinges on the rights of people who want to live in blocks where pets are not allowed, for personal, health, cultural, or religious reasons.\n\nThe greatest danger for the anti-pet lobby is that the Appeals Tribunal could rule that, yes, they may have a by-law restricting pets \u2013 but not the one they had. And, with pro-pet numbers growing, the chances of them getting the 75 per cent vote required to pass a new one may be slimmer than a chihuahua\u2019s diamante collar.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat does this mean for the rest of NSW and, indeed, Australia? This one could go all the way to the Supreme Court, setting legal precedents for the state and elsewhere.\n\nWould anyone really take it that far? With all the heat already in the dispute, we should recall the phrase that some lawyers love to hear: \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of principle.\u201d\n\nJimmy Thomson edits the strata living advice website flat-chat.com.au.
