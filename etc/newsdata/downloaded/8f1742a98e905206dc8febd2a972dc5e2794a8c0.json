The internet enables global access and near-zero costs of distribution, but the scale required in technology spend can be enormous. As an example, Google spends over $US20b on R &D each year. Further, technology companies frequently have high fixed costs and low incremental costs. The marginal cost of adding a new customer is very low. As these businesses expand, they become extremely profitable and because of the benefits of scale and network effects, market leadership can often be self-reinforcing. This leads to a winner takes most outcome in many markets. Due to our reliance on our \u201cnational champions\u201d, we are particularly vulnerable to the impact of technology disruption and the emergence of these global giants\n\nThe second key theme occurring is the rise of AI and the increased automation in the workplace. In all parts of the world, we will see jobs disappear due to the impact of AI. However, the bulk of the new highly productive jobs that are generated will be created in most innovative places in the world. For example, Facebook is the second-largest media company in Australia and generates billions in revenue each year from Australian companies, yet it employs about 200 people in Australia compared to about 15,000 people at its head office in Silicon Valley. We need many local companies to become the best in the world at what they do and create the new jobs that our society will require to replace the jobs that will disappear.\n\nDepending on your perspective, there is a case for optimism and a case for pessimism.\n\nWe have seen some positive signs in Australia over the last 5-10 years. We are seeing more talented entrepreneurs start businesses and they are increasingly focused on being global rather than local in outlook. We are also seeing more venture capital to support these entrepreneurs. As a result, we have seen a very significant increase over the last few years in the number of Australian start-ups that have scaled into large companies. By our estimates, the formation of new companies that have the potential to evolve into global successes is occurring at a rate which is 2-3 times faster compared to 10 years ago.\n\nHowever, we are not the only country that is aware of the imperative of becoming more innovative. Other countries are focused on the same goal and we need to be moving forward rapidly to be gaining a source of competitive advantage. In their recent report \u201cAustralia\u2019s Digital Opportunity\u201d by AlphaBeta they identified that our technology sector contributes 6.6% of Australian GDP and employs 5% of Australia\u2019s workforce and underpins innovation and productivity growth. However, they also found that Australia\u2019s Gross Value Add of Information and Communication Technology industries is about half the level of our peers and is the second lowest in the OECD, measured as a percentage of GDP. We are a long way behind where we need to be if Australia is to continue to thrive in the twenty-first century.\n\nOur extraordinary track record of 28 years (and counting) of continuous economic growth masks a complex reality. Success as a nation in the future will be based on different factors to success in the past and we are not well prepared for a highly disruptive world of global software-driven business models. Australia has a burning platform, but we haven\u2019t yet absorbed that reality.\n\nAustralia\u2019s Gross Value Add of Information and Communication Technology industries is about half the level of our peers.
