He\u2019s telling Cousin Greg that everyone on board has to take off their shoes, but he might as well have been telling him to sharpen his knives. Everyone needs something sharp \u2014 nails, knives, shivs, razors \u2014 on hand as the family hashes out who the blood sacrifice will be. A lot of people make sense \u2014 Frank, Karl, Gerri, Tom \u2014 but it\u2019s like waiting to see who won\u2019t get the final rose as the family convenes to pick the special son. It turns out to be Kendall, who, by the episode\u2019s end, turns on dear old dad. A truly excellent spoof of the Succession theme posted by Friend of Vulture Demi Adejuyigbe asked who will get the kiss from Daddy, but it turns out Logan is the one being kissed and killed! Here\u2019s where our season-long power rankings stand after Waystar Royco\u2019s trip through the Meditteranean.\n\nKendall ripping up his statement and walking away\n\nI mean, my GOD! If I could superimpose the Ariana Grande \u201cAnd what about it\u201d gif over this scene, I would! Logan tells Kendall that his replacement needs to be someone with a killer instinct, and here comes Kendall with the killer-ing-est move of the season. Kendall\u2019s impressive showing last week in \u201cD.C.\u201d proved to be his undoing this week while yachting: Showboating in front of Congress made him \u201cthe face\u201d of the brand, he\u2019s been in a leadership position, he\u2019s blood. \u201cWhat\u2019s more,\u201d his dad says, selling him on the deal, \u201cI trust you.\u201d Kendall takes that trust, pirouettes on top of it, and then does a death drop when he calls out his dad\u2019s toxicity in front of the whole world.\n\nThe HATS!\n\nWe must take a moment to acknowledge the trove of luxurious accessories the Roys donned this episode. There\u2019s a lot happening here, sartorially: Shiv\u2019s wide-brimmed floppy hat will obviously get top billing in tomorrow\u2019s discussion about tonight\u2019s episode, but Kendalls straw (?) fedora (?) is really just a travesty so specific in its design that I must appreciate it. Logan\u2019s little navy number is worth writing home about, too. The costumes this episode are for the most part so specifically unfortunate \u2014 Kendall again wearing a brown suit, Stewy\u2019s striped shirt and blazer number, Shiv\u2019s Tiffany-blue swimsuit, Tom dressed like a Crayola box of bad pastel \u2014 that I have to laugh.\n\nRoman Roy\n\nRoman, according to everyone else but especially Cousin Greg, is \u201cwidely known as a horrible person.\u201d Tonight on Succession, though, Roman is singing a different tune. He\u2019s still himself, but dealing in a more reserved version of his usual pompous asshat-ery. He knows the sovereign money deal isn\u2019t legit, he jumps to Gerri\u2019s defense when everyone sits around the table playing a round robin of who Who Won\u2019t Get The Final Rose, and actually asks his siblings if they can act like siblings and not like deranged, ambitious monsters. With Kendall as the blood sacrifice, and Logan\u2019s name sullied, Roman is now solo COO. A powerful, but also incredibly stressful, way to end the season.\n\nTom Wambsgans\n\nTom was too obvious of a blood sacrifice, but it was delicious to watch him squirm at the table while everyone threw his name around. I\u2019m still not sure if Shiv was helping him or hurting him when she brought up his actual crimes, but it did hurt his feelings enough for him to float the idea of divorcing her. Tom is oafish and silly, but he does know how to twist the knife! A lot of things were not in Tom\u2019s favor this episode \u2014 his ridiculously preppy pastel outfits, the threesome \u2014 but incredibly in Tom\u2019s favor was that he had the balls to snatch Logan\u2019s chicken and take a bite! That was a power move! (Apropos of nothing, I did rewatch the 2005 Keira Knightley Pride and Prejudice this weekend in a fit of insomnia and I would like to say: One Tomellete, please.)\n\nGerri Killman\n\nStop positing in Gerri\u2019s direction, you clowns! First it\u2019s Kendall saying that general counsel has to be the one to go, and then it\u2019s either Karl or Frank (or maybe Karl and Frank), and then Shiv! Her baby boy Roman jumps to her defense, which was maybe my favorite serious moment of that scene: it shows his sense for optics \u2014 firing a woman for the cruises mess would absolutely not be the right move \u2014 and also that he trusts and likes her, just as Logan does.\n\nWilla\n\nThe beloved \u201cfuck off\u201d of the week goes to \u2026 Broadway\u2019s own Willa! (Does Willa have a last name? Remind me to Google Sands reviews to double check.) She was not pleased that her play was panned, and she threw a whole iPad into the ocean, absolutely the richest thing to happen on Succession in a minute.\n\nShiv Roy\n\nShiv went full Ivanka last week, tampering with the cruises witness. It was a big sacrifice, morally and ethically, but it wasn\u2019t a blood sacrifice. Still, doing Daddy\u2019s bidding has her stepping onto the yacht really feeling herself \u2014 imagine scheduling a threesome with your husband on a family trip! A true chaotic instinct! It\u2019s always at the last minute, though, that Succession reminds us that Shiv actually loves Tom, that she\u2019s not just keeping him around. (Remember how he bolstered her during the Pierce dinner?) Forget all the Waystar Royco stuff: Tom might want a divorce! He\u2019s still mad about the open marriage thing! And he drops this all on her as she\u2019s reading Sally Rooney\u2019s Conversations With Friends! (A book, if you are unaware, about fucked up marriages, infidelity, rich friends, and questionable poetry.) Shiv asking Logan to not fire Tom, and to not fire Tom as a favor to her, is her real jeopardizing move this season. Logan doesn\u2019t respect that!\n\nStewy Hosseini\n\nLogan and Kendall decamp from their yacht life to meet with Stewy in Paxos. Stewy, ever the lovable douche, has already started eating by the time they arrive. The two Roys are wearing suits; Stewy is in a striped T-shirt and a blazer. Even when Logan makes him a good enough offer, he rejects it, because he knows he has the perma-upper hand here. The proxy battle is the one true reckoning, and the shareholder meeting is still on the horizon, and it looks like Sandy and Stewy are still on the upswing.\n\nLogan Roy\n\nLogan starts the episode being told that he needs to be the blood sacrifice, and ends the episode teed up to be the blood sacrifice. Some Vultures who congregated to watch the episode together considered that maybe he intentionally chose Kendall because he knew Kendall was the Roy kid who\u2019d stab him in the back and give him an exit strategy that keeps the company intact. I think that\u2019s a little too generous to Logan, especially since this season has labored to show us that he\u2019s not a mastermind, and isn\u2019t always thinking five moves ahead. But still! Giving up Kendall and watching Kendall betray him has to make him a little bit of a proud papa: Ken is the businessman Logan raised him to be, even though Ken-as-broken-son is the son he prefers. But yeah, Logan\u2019s fucked.\n\nFisher Stevens-as-Hugo Baker\n\nI know, I know. I have to get over the fact that Fisher Stevens is on this show. But I can\u2019t! It is just such a ticklish bit of casting. Minutes into this season finale, publicist Hugo Baker tries to throw Karolina \u2014 his own boss! \u2014 under the bus to be fired! I absolutely love to see it.\n\nCousin Greg\n\nCousin Greg wasn\u2019t the sacrificial lamb, and instead he\u2019s charged with escorting Kendall back home. Even though he\u2019s safe and buzzed off his not-favorite ros\u00e9, he still had to suffer through that absolutely disgusting toe fungus! Hate to see it.\n\nConnor Saying \u201cGIF\u201d with a soft \u201cG\u201d\n\nI mean, of course he fucking does.\n\nJamie Laird\n\nDanny Huston has a uniquely unsettling genteel quality as an actor \u2014 totally adept at playing blue bloods and erudite types, but guys who eventually snap and snarl. He couldn\u2019t have just been on Succession for that line about \u201cfrench-kissing an armadillo.\u201d On the yacht, his real motives jump out! Laird tries to pass the Turkey deal off as legit, but Roman knows better. Right in front of Logan, Roman (with an assist from Karl) stops his pitch in its tracks: the Turkey guys were scrambling and bullshitting, and Laird is only pushing the deal because he\u2019s afraid of being pushed out. With Roman running the show now, could Laird\u2019s bruised ego (and bank account) come back snapping next season?\n\nConnor Roy\n\nConnor has to pitch himself to be the blood sacrifice. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of you, Con,\u201d Logan smiles pitifully. \u201cThank you. We\u2019ll bear it in mind.\u201d This absolute fool of a firstborn is just looking for a payday, though, and no one is calling for Connor\u2019s head. When Connor asks Logan for a bailout directly, his \u201cSuper dad\u201d tells him that his presidential campaign is an embarrassment and he needs to end it before they can discuss the cool $100 mill he\u2019s after. I, however, have faith in Connor Roy\u2019s presidential ambitions because I have so little faith in the Electoral College.\n\nSands on Broadway\n\nPoor Sands. Sands, the show, deserved better! What other play currently running on Broadway gives you drama, intrigue, and bug bites?! Dinner and a show!", "description": "The season draws to a close with a blood sacrifice, a betrayal, and so many hats.
