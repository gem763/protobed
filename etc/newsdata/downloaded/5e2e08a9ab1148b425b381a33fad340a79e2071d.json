REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni\n\nThe film depicts the last six months of Garland\u2019s life, arriving in London in 1968 as part of a sold-out concert tour meant to refurbish her financial state.\n\nAmidst a rocky custody battle with her fourth husband and accompanied on the tour by her fifth and final husband, Micky Dean, played by Finn Wittrock, Garland struggles with depression, anxiety and addiction.\n\nZellweger called her portrayal of Garland a \u201ccontinued sort of exploration\u201d between the famous actress and singer\u2019s public persona and her private experiences.\n\n\u201cThere are many parameters that are non-negotiable that have been said on the public record and through Judy\u2019s own words and things. So you kind of feel a sense of responsibility to represent that as authentically as possible\u201d, Zellweger said.\n\n\u201cAnd then the rest was pretty difficult to know because we\u2019re talking about very private moments that haven\u2019t been shared and it\u2019s sort of an interpretation of what the experiences of the person who was living under those circumstances at that time might be like\u201d.\n\nZellweger is known for method acting, where she doesn\u2019t break character even when a scene is finished filming - a trait that helped her fellow cast members inhabit Garland\u2019s world too.\n\nWittrock didn\u2019t even recognize his co-star the first time he saw her in character.\n\n\u201cFrom kind of that point on until the end, I very rarely saw this Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, you know? I hung out with Judy,\u201d he told Reuters Television.\n\nZellweger\u2019s performance has received positive reviews.\n\n\u201cRen\u00e9e was perfect because she\u2019s a great actress, but also she sings, she\u2019s very funny and she has a big heart,\u201d said Rupert Goold, the director of the film. \u201cAudiences feel they know Ren\u00e9e at a certain level, that she\u2019s one of them. And I think that\u2019s a very Garland-like quality.\u201d\n\n\u201cJudy\u201d is released in the US on September 27.", "description": "Ren\u00e9e Zellweger said she felt a \"sense of responsibility\" to portray the late singer Judy Garland as authentically as possible in the movie \"Judy,\" which was shown at the Toronto Film Festival on Tuesday to a standing ovation.", "authors": ["Reuters Editorial", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20190911&t=2&i=1428543661&w=1200&r=LYNXNPEF8A04L-OCAEN", "published_at": "2019-09-11"}
