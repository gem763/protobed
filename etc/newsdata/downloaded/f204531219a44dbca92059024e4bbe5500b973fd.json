The most recent water quality report detailed a lack of progress and the relatively low takeup of those programs.\n\nThe new regulations empower government officers to access relevant farm data, such as purchase records for agricultural chemicals, to ensure farm practices are environmentally sound.\n\nSome of the state\u2019s largest agricultural lobby groups \u2013 including AgForce, which represents grain producers and graziers, and various cane growers\u2019 bodies \u2013 have campaigned against the regulations and at the same time actively promoted the work of the controversial academic, Peter Ridd, who has called for reef science to be reviewed.\n\nOn Tuesday the Senate backed a motion for a federal inquiry along those lines.\n\nBut while the agricultural industry broadly opposed the regulations, some parts of the sector did so while backing the science.\n\nOn Wednesday, as debate in parliament continued, the peak body for the Queensland horticulture industry, Growcom, issued a pointed statement that backed the science and the need for industry to play a role.\n\n\u201cSome are simultaneously standing behind the science supporting the use of [the herbicide] glyphosate while also questioning the science on climate change and impacts on the Great Barrier Reef,\u201d Growcom chief executive David Thomson said.\n\n\u201cSo to be clear, Growcom agrees with the scientific community and state and federal governments that water quality and the health of the reef is impacted in part by runoff from farms.\n\n\u201cWhere Growcom does depart from the Queensland government is how to best address it. We do not believe regulation is an effective and cost-efficient mechanism of improving runoff water quality in the horticulture industry.\u201d\n\nSenate inquiry into Great Barrier Reef seen as bid to discredit Queensland laws Read more\n\nSome farmers with genuine concerns about the impact of the regulations have told Guardian Australia they became increasingly frustrated with the direction of the major lobby groups questioning the science.\n\nOne cane industry employee said: \u201cWe lined up against the government. That cost us our credibility, and that cost us a better deal that worked for us, and worked for the reef.\u201d\n\nWWF Australia chief executive officer Dermot O\u2019Gorman said the reforms would maximise the ability of the reef to recover from coral bleaching events and cyclone damage.\n\nO\u2019Gorman said there were already \u201cfantastic examples\u201d of farm programs where government and private investment had helped to improve practices, but that \u201cthis approach on its own simply hasn\u2019t delivered on the scale that the reef needs.\n\n\u201cThese regulations are necessary to ensure that all farmers and many industrial land users take the next step towards making sure their practices are safe for the reef.\u201d\n\nShani Tager from the Australian Marine Conservation Society said clear water was essential for the reef \u201cto give it as much resilience as possible in the face of climate change\u201d.\n\n\u201cOverwhelmingly we\u2019re really happy these new laws have gone through and we can start to see some progress on cleaning up the water quality on the reef,\u201d Tager said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been quite unfortunate that farming lobby groups have taken the approach they have to slow it down.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a small number of farmers who are doing the right thing and they won\u2019t have to change their practices at all. But this is getting everyone else up to speed, because we\u2019ve had 10 years of voluntary programs that haven\u2019t worked.\u201d", "description": "Queensland\u2019s government will limit the agricultural pollution harming the Great Barrier Reef", "authors": ["Ben Smee"], "top_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cca702b11215a7563807deb5fb061ea9b04ee677/0_141_4252_2552/master/4252.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=516e6cac652aa8e3c9002631561a7512", "published_at": "2019-09-19"}
