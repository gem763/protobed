RNC Raises $1 Million In Six Hours Off Bogus Impeachment Inquiry", "language": "en", "text": "Well, all this impeachment talk sure has rallied President Donald J. Trump's base. A new report shows that the Republican National Committee raised $1 million on Tuesday in just six hours.\n\nAt 2:00 PM on Tuesday, the RNC started blasting fundraising emails to supporters to help fight against Democrats supporting impeachment against the president. By 8:00 PM, the committee had raised $1 million.\n\nAs noted by the Daily Caller's Henry Rodgers, RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel is putting Democrats who support impeachment on notice. McDaniel tweeted, \"We will absolutely hold House Democrats accountable for this. @realDonaldTrump won Elissa Slotkin's district in Michigan, yet she's backing this baseless impeachment inquiry. In less than 6 hours, our anti-Slotkin effort alone raised over $350,000.\"\n\nWe will absolutely hold House Democrats accountable for this.@realDonaldTrump won Elissa Slotkin's district in Michigan, yet she's backing this baseless impeachment inquiry.\n\n\n\nIn less than 6 hours, our anti-Slotkin effort alone raised over $350,000.https://t.co/qJBJY3Rb1b \u2014 Ronna McDaniel (@GOPChairwoman) September 25, 2019\n\nI can only imagine this massive fundraising haul will continue every darn day that the Democrats push this nonsense. Now that the transcript is released and it shows that this clearly is a bogus witch hunt - again - you better believe that the MAGA base will defend their guy in the White House by donating whatever they can to take down the leftists who enable this nonsense.\n\nThis record day also comes just weeks after the GOP smashed monthly fundraising totals in August.\n\n\"The RNC smashed another fundraising record last month. Between @realDonaldTrump 's accomplishments and our grassroots infrastructure, Republicans are going to be unstoppable in 2020!\" McDaniel tweeted last week.", "description": ".09/25/2019 19:24:01PM EST.", "authors": ["Timothy Meads", "Matt Vespa", "Cortney O'Brien"], "top_image": "https://media.townhall.com/townhall/reu/s1280x720/2019/256/8bbe7de7-ab1d-4c0e-a53e-54441500a233.png", "published_at": "2019-09-25"}
