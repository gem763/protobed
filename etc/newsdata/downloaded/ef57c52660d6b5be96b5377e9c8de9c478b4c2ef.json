Not surprisingly, early information from the Bahamas shows widespread devastation after some locations were exposed to a terrifying barrage of nearly two straight days of major hurricane conditions (Categories 3, 4 and 5).\n\nGrand Bahama Island was under the eyewall of Dorian, the most severe part of the hurricane, for 40 straight hours as the storm crawled at a record-slow pace for a tempest so strong.\n\n[Dorian\u2019s horrific eyewall slammed Grand Bahama Island for 40 hours straight]\n\nThe Finnish satellite company ICEYE, which uses synthetic-aperture radar to discern features on Earth\u2019s surface, released an image taken by its satellite on Monday at 11:44 a.m. local time that shows the areas that were probably inundated on Grand Bahama Island. This satellite has an advantage over other Earth-observing satellites in that it\u2019s not limited by clouds associated with storms like Dorian.\n\nThe ICEYE image shows widespread flooding, though much of the water has encroached on the international airport and relatively sparsely populated areas, at least as of the time the picture was taken.\n\nThe enormous scope of the storm surge flooding is also apparent in these remotely sensed images from the Sentinel satellite, which shows Great Abaco Island before and after the storm:\n\nThe images acquired by the radar on board #Sentinel1 \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa\ud83d\udef0\ufe0f over #AbacoIsland in the #Bahamas show the mind-boggling magnitude of the storm surge as a result of #HurricaneDorian pic.twitter.com/QiRuu4Z0lI \u2014 Copernicus EMS (@CopernicusEMS) September 3, 2019\n\nOther images and videos coming out show widespread devastation, particularly in Marsh Harbor and Abaco. Officials have not had time to overfly and assess the damage on all of the 70-mile-long Grand Bahama Island, which had a Category 4 and 5 onslaught for an unimaginably long time.\n\n[Dorian weakens slightly but expands in size, putting Florida, Georgia and Carolinas at risk]\n\n\n\nAn aerial view of damage in the Bahamas from Hurricane Dorian.
