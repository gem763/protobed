As Trysta Krick details, someone forgot to tell Juan Soto. USA TODAY\n\nGeorge Springer was quick to defend himself for not hustling out a double in the bottom of the eighth inning of Game 1 of the World Series.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to necessarily run as fast as I can because, for some reason,\" said the Astros outfielder in his postgame interview of Houston's 5-4 loss to the Washington Nationals, \"if (Kyle Tucker) tags or whatever the case and I run by him, it\u2019s not good. I was watching the outfielder.\n\n\u201cIf I had gone to third, I\u2019m out. I'm out for sure.\"\n\nWith one out and the Astros trailing 5-3, Springer hit a long fly ball off the right-center field wall that scored Tucker from second base. But Tucker was forced to hold up at second in case Nationals right fielder Adam Eaton had made the catch.\n\nHad Springer, who was seen hopping out of the box on his way to first base, made it to third, he potentially could have tied the game by tagging up on Jose Altuve's line out to right field. After Altuve, Michael Brantley lined out to left field to end the eighth inning with the Nationals holding a 5-4 lead.\n\nHUGE mistake here by Springer. Jogs and watches it out of the box. Forced to settle for 2B. Should've been standing on 3rd with 1 out.\n\n\n\nNext hitter Altuve hits a fly ball that would have been deep enough for a sac fly. Should be a tie ball game. This cannot happen. #WorldSeriespic.twitter.com/CzWhilChlA \u2014 Danny Vietti (@DannyVietti) October 23, 2019\n\nSpringer came through all night, reaching base in four of his five at-bats, which included two walks and a solo home run in the seventh inning \u2013 setting a record with a homer in his fifth consecutive World Series game.\n\nAstros manager A.J. Hinch was asked about the play after the game.\n\n\"I'll have to take a look at it,\" he said. \"I didn't see that. There was a lot going on in that play.\"", "description": "Astros' George Springer was quick to defend himself for not hustling out a double in the bottom of the eighth inning of Game 1 of the World Series.", "authors": ["Scott Boeck", "Published A.M.
