About a year before the World Trade Center came down, the book came out. I was talking about Osama bin Laden. I said, 'You have to kill him. You have to take him out.' Nobody listened to me.\" Trump added that people said to him, \"'You predicted that Osama Bin Laden had to be killed, before he knocked down the World Trade Center.' It's true.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: It's not true.\n\nHis 2000 book, \"The America We Deserve,\" makes a passing mention of bin Laden but did no more than point to the al-Qaida leader as one of many threats to U.S. security. Nor does he say in the book that bin Laden should have be killed.\n\nAs part of his criticism of what he considered Bill Clinton's haphazard approach to U.S. security as president, Trump wrote: \"One day we're told that a shadowy figure with no fixed address named Osama bin Laden is public enemy Number One, and U.S. jetfighters lay waste to his camp in Afghanistan. He escapes back under some rock, and a few news cycles later it's on to a new enemy and new crisis.\"\n\nThe book did not call for further U.S. action against bin Laden or al-Qaida to follow up on attacks Clinton ordered in 1998 in Afghanistan and Sudan after al-Qaida bombed the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The U.S. attacks were meant to disrupt bin Laden's network and destroy some of al-Qaida's infrastructure, such as a factory in Sudan associated with the production of a nerve gas ingredient. They \"missed\" in the sense that bin Laden was not killed in them, and al-Qaida was able to pull off 9/11 three years later.\n\nIn passages on terrorism, Trump's book does correctly predict that the U.S. was at risk of a terrorist attack that would make the 1993 World Trade Center bombing pale by comparison. That was a widespread concern at the time, as Trump suggested in stating \"no sensible analyst rejects this possibility.\"\n\nStill, Trump did not explicitly tie that threat to al-Qaida and thought an attack might come through a miniaturized weapon of mass destruction, like a nuclear device in a suitcase or anthrax.\n\n___\n\nTRUMP: \"Nobody ever heard of Osama bin Laden until really the World Trade Center.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: That's incorrect. Bin Laden was well known by the CIA, other national security operations, experts and the public long before 9/11, with the CIA having a unit entirely dedicated to bin Laden going back to the mid-1990s. The debate at the time was over whether Clinton and successor President George W. Bush could have done more against al-Qaida to prevent the 2001 attacks.\n\n___\n\nWAR IN IRAQ\n\nTRUMP: \"In Iraq \u2014 so they spent \u2014 President Bush went in. I strongly disagreed with it, even though it wasn't my expertise at the time, but I had a very good instinct about things. They went in and I said, 'That's a tremendous mistake.' And there were no weapons of mass destruction. It turned out I was right.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: There is no evidence Trump expressed public opposition to the Iraq war before the U.S. invaded, despite his repeated insistence that he did. Rather, he offered lukewarm support. He only began to voice doubts about the conflict well after it began in March 2003.\n\nHis first known public comment on the topic came on Sept. 11, 2002, when he was asked whether he supported a potential Iraq invasion in an interview with radio host Howard Stern. \"Yeah, I guess so,\" Trump responded. On March 21, 2003, just days after the invasion, Trump said it \"looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint.\"\n\nLater that year he began expressing reservations.\n\n___\n\nRUSSIA\n\nTRUMP, on Syria: \"I want our soldiers home or fighting something that's meaningful. I'll tell you who loves us being there: Russia and China. Because while they build their military, we're depleting our military there.\"\n\nTHE FACTS: His assertion that a pullout of U.S. troops from Syria strategically hurts Russia is highly dubious.", "description": "President Donald Trump falsely boasted that he predicted Osama bin Laden's 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center and inaccurately asserted he had always opposed the war in Iraq in a news conference Sunday that often fell short on facts.
