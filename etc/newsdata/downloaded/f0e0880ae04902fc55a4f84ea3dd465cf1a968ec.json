The AP source was not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation.\n\nIn Odessa, many returned to their normal routines Tuesday after the shooting over the holiday weekend sparked fear and chaos there and in Midland.\n\nHere's what we know Tuesday:\n\nHow did the gunman get his firearm?\n\nPolice have not officially said how the shooter obtained the weapon he used. Officials including Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said the shooter previously failed a gun background check, and did not go through a background check for the rifle he fired Saturday.\n\nOnline court records show he was arrested in 2001 in connection with a misdemeanor offense, but that would not have prevented him from legally purchasing firearms in Texas.\n\nA \"mental health issue\" caused the gunman to fail a federal background check in 2014, a law enforcement official told the Associated Press. His request to purchase a firearm at the time was denied.\n\nMove over, 'Friday Night Lights': Texas shooting brings together Odessa, Permian teens to help survivors\n\nJohn Wester, an agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, confirmed the gunman had previously failed a federal background check for a firearm. Wester did not say when or why the check was failed.\n\nA private sale, instead of one at a licensed gun dealer, would have allowed the gunman to avoid the background check for a AR-style rifle.\n\nGunman was 'violent, aggressive person,' neighbor says\n\nIn an interview with the Associated Press, neighbor Rocio Gutierrez said the shooter was \"a violent, aggressive person.\"\n\nGutierrez said the man would shoot rabbits and other animals at all hours of the night.\n\n\"We were afraid of him because you could tell what kind of person he was just by looking at him,\" Gutierrez told the news agency. \"He was not nice, he was not friendly, he was not polite.\"\n\n'We are one': Community vows to heal as police investigate motive for West Texas shootings\n\nFBI Special Agent Christopher Combs said the shooter's home was \"a very strange residence\" that reflected his mental state.\n\nOdessa Police Chief Michael Gerke said Monday that the gunman had been fired the morning of the shooting. Both he and his employer at Journey Oilfield Services called 911 to complain, but no threats of violence were made. The gunman later called the FBI's tipline.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t speak to his motives or why he called,\u201d Gerke said.\n\nCombs described the calls as \"rambling statements about some of the atrocities that he felt that he had gone through.\"\n\nA Texas Department of Public Safety officer was unaware of those events when he pulled the gunman over 15 minutes later for failing to signal a turn. The man fired on the trooper during the stop and sped away, beginning his massacre.\n\n\u201cHe was on a long spiral of going down,\" Combs said. \"He didn\u2019t wake up Saturday morning and go into his company and then it happened. He went to that company in trouble and had probably been in trouble for a while.\"\n\nThe gunman was killed in a shootout with police following his rampage that spanned 10 miles. Authorities say the gunman fired on other motorists and passers-by around the two Texas cities.\n\nVictims' names released\n\nThe city of Odessa released the names of the victims Monday evening. The victims' ages ranged from 15 to 57.\n\nLeilah Hernandez, 15, celebrated her quincea\u00f1era in May, grandmother, Nora Leyva, told the Washington Post. Leilah's 18-year-old brother, Nathan, was shot in the arm while his arms were around her.\n\nMary Granados, 29, was a postal worker killed in the gunfire, the U.S. Postal Service confirmed. Rosie Granados, Mary's sister, told CNN that she heard Mary scream as she was shot while talking on the phone. \u201cIt was very painful,\u201d Rosie Granados told the news outlet.\n\nJoseph Griffith, 40, was waiting at a traffic light with his wife and two children when he was fatally shot, Carla Byrne \u2013 Griffith's oldest sister \u2013 told the Washington Post. \u201cThis maniac pulled up next to him and shot him, took away his life, murdered my baby brother,\" Griffith told The Post. \"Like nothing. We are so broken.\u201d", "description": "The gunman in the shooting in Odessa, Texas on Saturday obtained the gun he used in a private sale, evading a background check, according to reports.", "authors": ["Ryan W.
