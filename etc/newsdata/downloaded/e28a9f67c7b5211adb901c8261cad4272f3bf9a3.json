She said: \u201cThe government\u2019s goals are to support private sector innovation whilst safeguarding the public interest.\u201d\n\nMinisters are coming under pressure to protect British companies in the wake of a series of takeovers by foreign bidders and opposition parties welcomed Leadsom\u2019s move.\n\nRichard Tice, chair of the Brexit Party, told MarketWatch: \u201cWe are delighted that the government is intervening in this vital national strategic defense asset.\u201d\n\nStephanie Peacock, Labour MP for Barnsley East, said: \u201cThis is an important U.K. company with hundreds of British workers in a specialized industry and a supply chain that provides many more across the country.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cMinisters have referred this deal to the CMA [Competition and Markets Authority] on security grounds, but it should not be agreed without a binding guarantee that those jobs won\u2019t be lost or outsourced.\u201d\n\nCobham employs 10,000 people, including 1,700 in the U.K.\n\nThe CMA will investigate the transaction and review its national security implications. It has until midnight on October 29 to complete and submit the report to the secretary of state.\n\nRuss Mould, an investment director at retail stockbroker AJ Bell, said a muted stock-price reaction \u2014 Cobham shares were down 0.6% to 159.6p in lunchtime trading in London \u2014 suggested that \u201crightly or wrongly, the market expects the deal to go through\u201d.\n\nAn Advent spokesperson said: \u201cAdvent is committed to being a responsible steward of Cobham, encouraging its future growth and success. We will continue to engage constructively and cooperatively with the U.K. government in this part of their review.\u201d\n\nThe move by Leadsom also follows weeks of controversy surrounding the acquisition. Last month, Nadine Cobham \u2014 who was married to former boss Michael Cobham \u2014 wrote to defense secretary Ben Wallace asking him to intervene in the deal. She said Advent\u2019s purchase posed a threat to the UK\u2019s manufacturing capabilities and valuable high-tech jobs.\n\nBoth Cobham and Advent have claimed the takeover doesn\u2019t have any national security implications.\n\nThis is the second time the government has involved itself in a buyout in the last three months. In July, the former secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport, Jeremy Wright, issued a public interest intervention notice, launching a probe into the acquisition of U.K. satellite group Inmarsat ISAT, +0.00% by a private equity-led consortium on national security grounds.\n\nThe $3.4 billion bid by Apax, Warburg Pincus, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and the Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan Board was initially announced in March.\n\nSince 2003, there have only been 12 public-interest interventions, seven of which were on national security grounds, according to U.K. government data. There hasn\u2019t yet been a transaction that was prohibited following such intervention.", "description": "The U.K. government has ordered an investigation into the \u00a34 billion acquisition of defense manufacturer Cobham by U.S. private equity firm Advent...", "authors": ["Lina Saigol", "Selin Bucak"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HR366_cobham_ZG_20190916103738.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-18"}
