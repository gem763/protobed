British news media reported that government sources described the offer Wednesday as \u201ctake it or leave it.\u201d\n\nJohnson has repeatedly said that any deal with Europe cannot include the so-called \u201cIrish backstop,\u201d which is designed to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom, and Ireland, a member of the E.U.\n\nWithin only one month, Boris Johnson lost control \u2014 and a historic Supreme Court battle\n\nEven before the fresh proposals were spelled out, the Irish government poured cold water on a leaked proposal seen by the Daily Telegraph newspaper.\n\nAD\n\nJohnson\u2019s plan appears to cross red lines drawn years ago by European negotiators.\n\nNor is it certain that if a version of his plan were accepted by Brussels, he could win passage of the deal in a bitterly divided British Parliament.\n\nAD\n\nAt his speech before his fellow Tories, Johnson said that Brexit was foiling the country\u2019s ambition. He compared Britain to \u201ca world-class athlete with a pebble in his shoe.\u201d\n\nHe blamed his fractious lawmakers. \u201cIf Parliament were a computer, the screen would be stuck on the pizza wheel of doom,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cIf Parliament were a reality TV show the whole lot of us, I\u2019m afraid, would have been voted out of the jungle by now. But at least we could have watched the Speaker being forced to eat a kangaroo testicle.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u201cThat is why we are coming out of E.U. on Oct. 31 come what may,\u201d Johnson said, warning his European counterparts that Britain \u201cwas ready\u201d to leave without a deal.\n\nAnd yet, a bill passed by Parliament last month requires Johnson to seek a three-month delay of Brexit unless a deal is struck by Oct. 19. Johnson has said that Britain will leave the bloc by the Halloween deadline and that he will obey the law, prompting many to wonder whether he is seeking a loophole.\n\nAD\n\nImagining a Britain beyond Brexit, Johnson spun Conservative proposals to install super-fast broadband, recruit thousands of new police officers, build new hospitals and expand Britain\u2019s bus network.\n\nAD\n\nHe was, the prime minister said, a \u201cbus nut\u201d who liked to \u201cmake and to paint very inexact models of buses.\u201d\n\nWith an eye toward a coming general election, Johnson also tore into opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn, calling his Labour Party \u201cfratricidal, anti-Semitic Marxists.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s speech was peppered with jokes \u2014 some new, some old, some that seemed to unintentionally ridicule himself.\n\nJohnson\u2019s speech was peppered with jokes -- some new, some old, some that seemed to unintentionally ridicule himself.\n\nAt one point, while praising Britain\u2019s renewable energy sector, he noted that at times wind and solar \u201care delivering more than half our energy needs.\u201d But \u201cit was only a few years ago when people were saying that solar power would never work in cloudy old Britain and that wind turbines would not pull the skin off a rice pudding.\u201d In fact it Johnson himself, as mayor of London, who said that six years ago.\n\nJohnson ended his first conference speech as leader with another joke \u2014 this one about launching his rival Corbyn into space \u2014 before saying, \u201cLet\u2019s get Brexit done and let\u2019s bring this country together.\u201d He left the hall holding hands with his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, who resides with him at 10 Downing Street as his second divorce is finalized.\n\nAfter the speech, and as a detailed proposal winds its way toward Brussels, both sides of the channel were waiting to see what European leaders make of it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nThe Irish border has proven to be one of the most difficult issues facing negotiators over the past three years. The open border on the island helped bring peace to Ireland. A guarantee of an open border is central to the Good Friday Agreement, which ended the Troubles, as the 30 years of sectarian violence in Northern Ireland are known.\n\nToday the boundary is mostly invisible. A driver whizzing between Belfast and Dublin is not required to stop for any customs check or security control. There are no cameras, not even a sign post.\n\nThe E.U. is also keen to \u201cget Brexit done,\u201d but it has long signaled that it does not want border infrastructure on the island of Ireland.\n\nAD\n\nYet keeping a border open and free \u2014 if the two nations diverge on issues of trade and security \u2014 is not easy. Even friendly countries with the closest of ties have hard borders or at least some infrastructure, as do Norway and Sweden, Switzerland and the European Union, and the United States and Canada.\n\nAD\n\nAccording to the Daily Telegraph, Johnson will propose a solution of \u201ctwo borders, for four years.\u201d Northern Ireland, the paper said, would stay in the E.U.\u2019s single market for agriculture and industrial goods for four years, after which time Northern Ireland would decide whether to continue with the arrangement or align with the rest of Britain.\n\nThis would mean there would be customs checks between Northern Ireland and Ireland, which could happen away from the border, the Telegraph reported.\n\nAD\n\nIf Johnson does propose that the entire United Kingdom leave the customs union, it would mark a stark contrast with the Brexit deal negotiated by his predecessor as prime minister, Theresa May. Under that proposed agreement, the whole United Kingdom would have remained in the customs union.\n\nThe European customs union allows for free trade among the 28 member states. No tariffs or taxes are charged for the goods bought and sold among the members, who agree to charge the same tax on all goods entering the bloc from the outside.\n\nAD\n\nBut staying in proved problematic to Brexiteers \u2014 Parliament voted down May\u2019s deal three times. They want to be free of the E.U. customs union because membership limits Britain\u2019s ability to strike its own trade deals, with the United States, for example.\n\nAD\n\nBritain wants to leave the European Union\u2019s single market \u2014 which allows for the free, frictionless movement of goods, services, capital and people \u2014 by agreeing to abide by E.U. rules and regulations, to keep everyone on the same, level playing field.\n\nSome outside countries are members of the single market, but not members of the E.U., such as Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Those countries get access to the giant marketplace but do not have much say in writing the rules.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson accused of groping a journalist\n\nBrexit was not the only issue dominating the four-day Conservative Party conference. Johnson was repeatedly asked by journalists about claims he groped a Sunday Times columnist at a work luncheon in 1999. Johnson said he cannot remember the lunch but denied the claim.\n\nAD\n\nHe was also repeatedly asked about his relationship with the American business executive Jennifer Arcuri, whose technology company received thousands of pounds of public money from an organization that Johnson oversaw when he was mayor of London. Johnson denied any wrongdoing but did not deny that the two had an affair.\n\nThere was also moment of bizarre theater at the conference when Johnson was handed a disposable coffee cup by one aide only to have it snatched away by another aide seconds later. She said \u201cno disposable cups\u201d as she grabbed the drink from Johnson.\n\nJohnson later tweeted a picture of himself grinning and holding up a ceramic coffee cup. \u201cI got my coffee in the end,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nBooth reported from Brussels.\n\nU.K. Supreme Court rules Prime Minister Boris Johnson suspended Parliament illegally\n\nAfter Supreme Court defeat, Boris Johnson taunts Parliament\n\nToday\u2019s coverage from Post correspondents around the world\n\nLike Washington Post World on Facebook and stay updated on foreign news", "description": "Johnson is scheduled to address Britain\u2019s Conservative Party conference.", "authors": ["Karla Adam", "London Correspondent Covering The United Kingdom", "William Booth", "London Bureau Chief"], "top_image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/resizer/26Y5CuAWfpZFFsQn7v3JsyfgyuE=/1440x0/smart/arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/QT6NK3XFAUI6TNAD644ITGMC2I.jpg"}
