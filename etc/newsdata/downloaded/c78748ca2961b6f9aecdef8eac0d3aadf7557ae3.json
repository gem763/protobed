Claiming publicly that the man was Xavier Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s was a very big mistake.\"\n\nPolice Scotland had said earlier that a man was in custody in connection with a European Arrest Warrant.\n\nThe AFP news agency said the 58-year-old was allegedly travelling under a false name when the flight arrived in Glasgow from Paris.\n\nThe state prosecutor in Nantes, France, had said fingerprint and DNA tests were under way to determine the passenger's identity.\n\n(Image: Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images)\n\nDe Ligonn\u00e8s went on the run in 2011 after the bodies of his wife Agnes, 49, and children Tomas, 21, Arthur, 18, Anne, 16, and Benoit, 13, were found buried in the garden of the family house in Nantes, western France, along with their two pet Labradors, Jules and L\u00e9on.\n\nA female witness on Saturday told the Ouest France newspaper that De Ligonn\u00e8s had since managed to start a new life in Scotland.\n\n\"A very reliable source specifies that the fugitive had even remarried in Great Britain,\" the newspaper reported.\n\nThere was no indication as to whether this information had been passed on to the police, it added.\n\n(Image: Maxppp/PA Images)\n\nIt came after Scottish police had said the \"digital fingerprint\" of a man who landed in Glasgow on easyJet flight U26884 at 2.30pm on Friday corresponded to that of De Ligonn\u00e8s.\n\nHe was using a passport stolen in 2014 belonging to a man called Guillaume Joao, it was orginally claimed, but then this information was retracted.\n\nMr Joao\u2019s home in Limay, in the Yvelines department 40 miles of Paris, was raided by police.\n\n\"Mr Joao looks nothing like De Ligonn\u00e8s, and nor was the man who was arrested in Glasgow,\" said a French investigating source.\n\n(Image: Maxppp/PA Images)\n\n\"The digital fingerprint identification was only partial,\" he added.\n\nPierre Senn\u00e8s, the Nantes prosecutor, had called for \"prudence\".\n\nLast year police searched underground caves and abandoned potassium mines in the area around Roquebrune-sur-Argens, in the south of France, where De Ligonn\u00e8s was spotted by a CCTV camera in April 2011.\n\nThere was no sign of him there either.\n\nPolice Scotland said earlier: \"On Friday, 11 October 2019, a man was arrested at Glasgow Airport and remains in police custody in connection with a European Arrest Warrant issued by the French Authorities.\n\n\"Inquiries are ongoing to confirm his identity and we continue to liaise with our colleagues in the relevant agencies.\"", "description": "A man arrested at Glasgow Airport was initially thought to be French fugitive Xavier Dupont de Ligonn\u00e8s, who is accused of murdering his wife and four children", "authors": ["Peter Allen", "Chris Kitching", "Image", "Gamma-Rapho Via Getty Images", "Maxppp Pa Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20564257.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_Screen-Shot-2019-10-12-at-030239.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-12"}
