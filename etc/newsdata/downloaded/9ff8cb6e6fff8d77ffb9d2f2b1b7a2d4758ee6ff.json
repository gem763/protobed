Kamala Harris said on Monday night that President Trump should have his Twitter account suspended over his tweets about the whistleblower whose complaint has helped launch an official House inquiry into his potential impeachment.\n\n\"The President's tweets and his behaviors about this are just further evidence of the fact that he uses his power in a way that is designed to beat people down instead of lift people up,\" the 2020 Democratic presidential candidate told CNN.\n\n\"Frankly, when you look at what he's been tweeting today directed at the whistleblower, directed at so many people, you know, I, frankly, think that based on this and all we've seen him do before, including attacking members of Congress, that he, frankly, should be -- his Twitter account should be suspended.\u201d\n\nHarris said Trump\u2019s latest tweets, in which he called the whistleblower \u201cclose to a spy,\u201d is evidence that he is \u201cirresponsible with his words in a way that could result in harm to other people.\u201d\n\nTRUMP WANTS TO MEET WHISTLEBLOWER, SAYS SCHIFF MAY HAVE COMMITTED 'FRAUD AND TREASON'\n\n\u201cThe privilege of using those words in that way should probably be taken from him,\" she added.\n\nWhen asked if she thought suspending Trump\u2019s Twitter account could be seen as the tech giant silencing Trump\u2019s free speech, Harris doubled down on her argument that the president should not use \u201chis words in a way that could subject someone to harm.\u201d\n\n\"If he's not going to exercise self-restraint, then, perhaps, there should be other mechanisms in place to make sure that his words do not, in fact, harm anyone,\" she said. \"And that's my point. What we want to make sure is that his words do not actually result in harm to anyone.\"\n\nKAMALA HARRIS HITS 'LAWLESS PRESIDENT' TRUMP: 'THE GUY IS SCARED' AND 'DESPERATE,' KNOWS HE WILL LOSE IN 2020\n\nTrump on Sunday said he wants to meet the whistleblower who filed a complaint about his July phone call with the Ukrainian president and to have House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., questioned for \u201cfraud and treason.\u201d\n\nIn the series of tweets on Sunday, Trump said he wanted to meet with both the whistleblower and the person who supplied the information. He also questioned whether he was being spied on.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\u201cIn addition, I want to meet not only my accuser, who presented SECOND & THIRD HAND INFORMATION, but also the person who illegally gave this information, which was largely incorrect, to the \u2018Whistleblower,\u2019\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cWas this person SPYING on the U.S. President? Big Consequences!\u201d\n\nFox News' Stephen Sorace contributed to this report.", "description": "", "authors": ["Gerren Keith Gaynor", "Gerren Keith Gaynor Is A Digital Editor At Fox News.
