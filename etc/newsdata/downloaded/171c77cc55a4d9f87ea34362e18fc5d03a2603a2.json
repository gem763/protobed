I thought the primary was canceled.\n\nI\u2019m surprised Sanford pulled the trigger. He\u2019s been talking about running for months but always as just one option for his next step, even noting in the \u201cad\u201d he cut a few months ago that he might pass on a presidential run and start an \u201cadvocacy organization\u201d focused on federal spending instead. Sure seemed like he was teasing a primary challenge to Trump to get free media buzz for whatever his actual plans were.\n\nNope. He\u2019s doing it.\n\nMark Sanford explains why he is running against President Trump in the Republican primary. Only on Fox News Sunday. Check your local listings. #FoxNews #FNS pic.twitter.com/KYKo12QDZK \u2014 FoxNewsSunday (@FoxNewsSunday) September 8, 2019\n\nAs of yesterday, his home state of South Carolina won\u2019t even be holding a presidential primary in the spring. So why\u2019s Sanford running? To do damage to Trump in the media, I assume. Now that he\u2019s in the race, news networks will be even more eager than they were before to give him airtime. He\u2019ll have six months to make the case against the president every day to \u201csoft\u201d Trump supporters. How does that shake out next fall?\n\nThe interesting thing about Sanford\u2019s candidacy is how it complements the other insurgent campaign against Trump. Joe Walsh isn\u2019t running on issues; his anti-Trump pitch aims squarely (and ironically) at character and fitness. Sanford\u2019s the one running on issues, specifically the mind-boggling deficit Trump is somehow running in the midst of a booming economy. Can he win the Republican nomination reminding center-righties and the phony fiscal hawks who used to call themselves \u201ctea partiers\u201d that POTUS has completely upended party dogma on spending? Nah. Can he make some reluctant Trump voters a little more reluctant to reward Trump with another term, particularly with Walsh using his own media appearances to highlight the embarrassing Trump tweet/photo op du jour?\n\nMaybe, yeah. The number of Trump voters whom he and Walsh help turn against the president may be marginal but the 2016 election was won at the margins in key states. If nothing else, it may surprise some casual GOP voters who dislike Trump but don\u2019t follow politics closely to learn that he has several primary challengers now. Sanford and Walsh are marginally mainstreaming the idea that it\u2019s okay for Republicans to not want to reelect the president. Again, margins are important.\n\nSanford\u2019s candidacy might complement another (potential) challenger besides Walsh. He\u2019s buddies with Justin Amash, who\u2019s weighing a run for the Libertarian Party\u2019s nomination. If Sanford can galvanize, say, 10 percent of Republican voters to oppose Trump on grounds of fiscal responsibility, those Republicans would potentially be primed to switch to Amash in the general election. I wonder, in fact, if that\u2019s not the plan here, with Sanford prepared to \u201cpass the baton\u201d to Amash and endorse him in the general election. A guy who\u2019s consumed with profligate spending can\u2019t rightly support a Democrat against Trump, after all. (Walsh, who\u2019s focused on character above all, potentially could.) Maybe the idea is to build a small but meaningful libertarian constituency on the right that\u2019ll endure through the primary and into the general election and frighten Trump into taking spending more seriously.\n\nImagine if that constituency ended up helping elect Bernie Sanders president by siphoning off votes from POTUS.\n\nSanford\u2019s campaign website is already live and features two introductory videos, one called \u201cWhy I\u2019m Running\u201d that hammers at spending and the other called \u201cTwo Other Things\u201d that addresses norms and humility, a more Walsh-ian critique of Trump but one which Sanford\u2019s clearly designating as secondary in his campaign. Trump\u2019s going to lash out at him for his bizarre episode years ago as governor in which he disappeared to go be with his mistress in Argentina but that may end up doing POTUS more harm than good. It\u2019s a fair hit, it\u2019s just that character attacks are destined to backfire on him by reminding people of their misgivings about Trump\u2019s own character. (\u201cThis guy is goofing on Sanford for infidelity?\u201d) He\u2019s better off ignoring all of his challengers and hoping Republican voters do too.
