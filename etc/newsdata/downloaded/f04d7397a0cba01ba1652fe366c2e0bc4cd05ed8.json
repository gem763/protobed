Some \u201cNever Trump\u201d writers and commentators have morphed into supporters and being pro-Trump can be good for business, as the president is known to promote complimentary books and Fox News appearances to his tens of millions of Twitter followers.\n\nIn interviews with POLITICO, Goldberg and Hayes acknowledged having strong views on Trump, though stressed the need to address conservative ideas and issues beyond the current White House occupant.\n\n\u201cObviously, Trump plays a huge role in our day-to-day lives, day-to-day politics and everything,\u201d said Hayes. \u201cBut we\u2019re approaching this taking the longer view.\u201d\n\nThe Dispatch is launching with a staff of eight that includes David French, another National Review veteran critical of Trump, and managing editor Rachael Larimore, who served as online managing editor of The Weekly Standard until it shuttered in late 2018 and was most recently at The Bulwark.\n\nThe genesis of The Dispatch began during conversations around the Weekly Standard\u2019s closing, said Goldberg, though the two longtime friends have spoken for years about starting something together. Goldberg, Hayes and fellow co-founder and Dispatch president Toby Stock brought in investors, though they will own the majority of the media company.\n\nOn Wednesday, The Dispatch \u2014 which is powered by newsletter start-up Substack \u2014 will publish the first issue of its Morning Dispatch email, with additional newsletters and podcasts slated for the coming months. The co-founders have devised a membership model, with readers and listeners expected to pay $10 a month or $100 a year for all The Dispatch\u2019s content beginning early next year. One can also become a founding lifetime member now for $1,500, as radio host Hugh Hewitt did Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re rejecting the standard dot.com model because we don\u2019t want to monetize people\u2019s rage and piss people off just to get the clicks.\u201d - Jonah Goldberg\n\nHayes said the site, which fully launches in early 2020, is expected to publish just three pieces a day, including an anchor story that\u2019s buttressed by rigorous reporting or thoughtful commentary. \u201cWe\u2019re deliberately trying to slow things down,\u201d said Hayes. He emphasized the need for original reporting, of which he finds too little coming from the center-right, and plans to avoid getting in \u201cthe hot take business.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re rejecting the standard dot.com model because we don\u2019t want to monetize people\u2019s rage and piss people off just to get the clicks,\u201d said Goldberg.\n\nGoldberg said The Dispatch will cover Trump\u2019s \u201cmanifest flaws and mistakes he\u2019s made,\u201d as well as his \"dishonesty\" in office, though he acknowledged conservatives have been well-served by his judicial appointments and may find things to like in the president. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of cost-benefit analysis to be made about anything on Trump,\u201d he said.\n\nFor inspiration, Goldberg said he\u2019s looking to The New Republic of the 1980s and early 1990s, an ostensibly liberal publication that challenged Democratic orthodoxy. \u201cOne of the things the reporters were willing to do is call BS on their own side,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe want to bring back that tradition,\u201d said Goldberg, adding, \u201cWe want to be journalistically and intellectually skeptical of the people, politics, and institutions that are claiming the conservative or Republican mantle.\"\n\n", "description": "", "authors": ["-", "Jonah Goldberg"], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/5b/92/4ca4c88245e7a255d6a5efd2dd5a/191008-jonah-goldberg-gty-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-08"}
