Kennedy assassination, 1993\u2019s 600-plus page Case Closed, has called sensationalist left-wing moviemaker Oliver Stone a \u201cmaster filmmaker \u2026 but just a terrible historian,\u201d declaring that \u201cthe only thing he gets right in \u2018JFK\u2019 is the date on which Kennedy is killed.\u201d\n\nOddly enough, Stone, who seldom meets a far-fetched plot he doesn\u2019t fall in love with, and whose 1991 Kennedy film claiming the CIA engineered the assassination has direct roots in a 1967 KGB-backed hoax planted in the Italian Communist Party-owned organ Paese Sera, has an interest in Ukraine. He believes the nation\u2019s successful 2014 revolt against a regime under the thumb of Russia\u2019s ex-KGB officer ruler, Vladimir Putin, was a neo-Nazi, CIA-orchestrated coup.\n\nIt\u2019s quite a few years ago now since Stone fell in love with Putin, but the newest nameless toast of the town in Washington has other reasons for writing his or her August 12-dated action movie screenplay to the chairmen of the Senate and House intelligence committees.\n\nBecause of its wording and structure, two things become clear early on in reading the jump cut-filled missive:\n\nIts politicized purpose The impossibility of it being the work of a single individual\n\nIf you worked in a bank, and you heard from others that the bank president was pocketing cash, would you, as a whistleblower, appoint yourself judge and jury and declare that \u201cIn the course of my official duties, I have received information from multiple\u201d fellow bank workers that the bank president \u201cis using the power of his office to\u201d steal from the bank?\n\nYour knowledge of the incident being hearsay, you wouldn\u2019t be 100% sure. So your written whistleblower complaint would read that he \u201cmay be using the power of his office\u201d or you \u201cstrongly suspect\u201d or \u201cevidence suggests\u201d a crime or misconduct, etc. And that you would like to see a formal investigation to find out.\n\nOnly an outright partisan on a mission to get President Trump impeached would consider a phone call to which \u201cI was not a direct witness\u201d to be absolute evidence of guilt, as this letter asserts.\n\nThis government official states without any shimmer of doubt that \u201cthe President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election,\u201d therefore the whistleblower is \u201cdeeply concerned that the actions described below,\u201d further on in the complaint, \u201cconstitute \u2018a serious or flagrant problem, abuse, or violation of law\u2019\u201d and then proceeds even to cite an exact statute in regard to the intel agencies\u2019 inspector general: 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 3033(k)(5)(G). Again, not \u201cmay constitute\u201d\n\nA Carefully-Crafted Impeachment Primer For The Media\n\nWhich brings us to the second clear characteristic of the whistleblower\u2019s tract that becomes evident immediately in reading it: that these nine pages are the obvious work of a team of Democratic Party lawyers.\n\nEx-CIA analyst Fred Fleitz told Fox News Thursday night that he suspects \u201cDemocratic attorneys with the House Intelligence Committee\u201d because back on August 28, the panel\u2019s chairman, Democrat Adam Schiff of California, had an astounding premonition of the blowing of the whistle, as he made \u201calmost identical complaints\u201d in a tweet. He claimed: \u201cTrump is withholding vital military aid to Ukraine, while his personal lawyer seeks help from the Ukraine government to investigate his political opponent. It doesn\u2019t take a stable genius to see the magnitude of this conflict. Or how destructive it is to our national security.\u201d\n\nThis begs the question: why, if Schiff really believed \u201cthe magnitude of this conflict,\u201d didn\u2019t he move against Trump then? Perhaps because he knew that the audience was in for more exciting scenes from this skillfully shot action flick in just a few weeks\u2019 time.\n\nAs Fleitz said, \u201cthis is one of the most unusual whistleblowing complaints I\u2019ve ever seen; I\u2019ve seen a bunch of them. Not only was it perfectly written, but it was written with long legal citations, suggesting that it was written by a team of attorneys.\u201d\n\nWe already know that the individual is being represented by Andrew Bakaj of Compass Rose Legal Group, who has worked for some of Washington\u2019s most powerful Democratic Party politicians, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Hillary Clinton, and the late Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, as well as for the State Department \u2013 in, what do you know, the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine.\n\nInterestingly, the bio of the whistleblower\u2019s co-counsel, Mark Zaid, boasts that \u201cHe currently possesses TS/SCI eligibility and has had Q level access\u201d \u2013 the very highest level of Top Secret clearance. That not only indicates legal expertise in dealing with espionage matters; it means he\u2019s got plenty of friends within the intelligence agencies and the congressional intel committees, and no doubt at State and the Pentagon as well.\n\nWhen the whistleblower relates that \u201cOver the past four months, more than half a dozen U.S. officials have informed me of various facts related to\u201d the communications between Trump and his attorney Rudy Giuliani with Ukrainian officials, was it really \u201cme,\u201d or his or her legal representation utilizing their Rolodex?\n\nMoreover, the detail gone into in the complaint does not only extend to \u201clong legal citations\u201d as Fleitz notes; we\u2019re provided with lengthy footnotes telling all about the background of Ukrainian politics too. Now who might the targeted readership of such a well-crafted document be? The inspector general of the intelligence community who already knows all this or can have his staff dig it up for him? Members and staff of the House and Senate intel committees, who also already know or have the information at their fingertips?\n\nOf course not. These nine pages, whose lawyer co-authors knew would become public, are a primer for the media, to make sure they can cover the impending impeachment to the max.\n\nThe team of Democrat attorneys wrote the script. The establishment media will now dutifully project this Oliver Stone cinematic entertainment onto their screens.\n\nOver 60% of Americans still prefer the anti-American, Putin-loving director\u2019s myth about the JFK slaying, based on half-century-old communist disinformation, rather than what the easily-accessible facts show to be true. As 2020 beckons, President Trump\u2019s enemies think the voters will believe the plot of this motion picture too.\n\n\u2014 Written by Thomas McArdle\n\nNote to Readers: Issues & Insights is a new site launched by the seasoned journalists behind the legendary IBD Editorials page.
