That said, Boston would love to get him locked up on a number they like.\n\nThe Celtics made a four-year, $80 million offer to Brown but he turned it down, reports Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports.\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nBut even with history not on Brown\u2019s side, the Celtics have extended the 6-foot-7 swingman an offer of four years and $80 million, league sources told Yahoo Sports. But Brown believes in his ability to one day be a star and is pursuing a bigger offer, sources said. Next season the Celtics will have another major decision: figuring out if Jayson Tatum is worth the rookie-scale max.\n\nBrown sounded like a guy wanting to bet on himself speaking to The New York Times\u2019 Marc Stein:\n\n\u201cBut to be honest, [extension talks are] really not overwhelming me or ruling my thoughts. I know what type of talent I have. I\u2019m confident in myself. I\u2019m confident in my ability.\u201d\n\nBrown impressed this past summer with Team USA \u2014 where he was aggressive and attacking \u2014 and now is back with Boston (where Kemba Walker replaces Kyrie Irving at the point, hopefully leading to better chemistry on the court). There is an expectation Brown is going to return to the upward trajectory we saw in his second NBA season, and for stretches the second half of last season.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf Brown takes those steps forward this season he will hit free agency next July in what will be a down market. A young forward with his skills could interest a team such as Atlanta \u2014 a team with cap space, young players, and it\u2019s Brown\u2019s home state \u2014 or others, and if so they are coming in with a larger offer intended to make the Celtics balk (Boston has the right to match any offer, Brown is a restricted free agent).\n\nDo other teams see Brown as worth more than the $80 million Boston put on the table? We will not know until next summer, but it sounds like Brown is willing to make the bet the answer is yes.", "description": "Could Brown get more than that as a free agent next summer?", "authors": ["Kurt Helin"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/__2TJrhcz9Hd.HaKVvo_ww--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD03MjEuNDU0NTQ1NDU0NTQ1NQ--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/DIG7_IstiwtG1PBBvd1yLQ--~B/aD01NTg7dz05OTA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/nbcsports.com/c8ed066a66a502bb8a22d2efc2fa466b", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
