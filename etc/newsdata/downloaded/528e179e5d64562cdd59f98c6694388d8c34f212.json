Nearly four times as many black women were murdered.\n\n'These inequities result from the disproportionate exposure of racial and ethnic minorities to systemic inequities such as residential segregation, concentrated disadvantage, stress from experiencing racism, limited access to the best educational and employment opportunities, and other conditions that increase risk for experiencing violence,' the CDC authors said.\n\n'Racial and ethnic minority youths often live in communities with concentrated poverty, stressed economies, residential instability and neighborhood disorganization, access to firearms and illegal drugs, and low community cohesion and informal controls.'\n\nGuns were used in nearly 74 percent of all homicides, and about 40 percent of the time, the victim and their killer knew one another.\n\nOne in three of those killings followed an argument or some kind of conflict.\n\nPerhaps most disturbingly, infants were often the victims in homicides. Children under a year old were over at over three-fold greater risk of being murdered than were older toddlers.\n\n'The high homicide rate for infants reinforces the need for prioritizing child abuse and neglect prevention and intervention strategies,' the CDC report authors wrote.\n\n'Creating safe, stable, and nurturing relationships and environments is essential for the prevention of child abuse and neglect.'\n\nThat means better economic and social support for families, and better access to care and education, according to the report.\n\nWhen police shoot and kill someone in the line of duty, it is not considered a homicide, but a legal intervention, a category that also includes the execution of death row inmates in states where the practice is legal.\n\nAll but four percent of these deaths involved guns, and were most likely to occur in someone's residence (accounting for 38.4 percent of these deaths).\n\nAccording to the new report, 90 percent of fatal legal interventions followed another 'serious' crime.\n\nOver half of these were reported to be homicides or assaults and 11 percent were robberies.\n\nAlthough guns, violence and drugs are often lumped together, legal interventions involving the drug trade only accounted for about two percent of authority-involved deaths.\n\nThe CDC report authors were particularly concerned, however about the harm that Americans - particularly the youngest ones - inflicted upon themselves.\n\nMany suicides were precipitated by some sort of interpersonal conflict and/or substances like alcohol or drugs being used, as were mental health problems.\n\nCDC officials recommend programs to help people but especially students connect with their peers, resolve family conflicts and other support systems to try to stem the high rate of suicides among young people in the US.", "description": "Nearly 65 percent of the Americans who died violently took their own lives, and a quarter were murdered by others and guns were a driver of violent deaths, according to Thursday's CDC data.", "authors": ["Natalie Rahhal Deputy Health Editor For Dailymail.Com"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/03/20/19267884-0-image-a-7_1570130462822.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-03"}
