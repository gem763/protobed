It was completely transactional. It was not a relationship.'\n\nThe woman said she told 'like a million people' about what had happened with Lauer, but nothing was to happen until fall 2017 when the #MeToo waves rocking the media led colleagues to ask her about the Today anchor.\n\nShe told Meredith Vieira, Lauer's co-host, who was distraught and told her to go to NBC human resources with a lawyer, according to the book.\n\nDespite being promised anonymity, the woman claims the allegations reverberated throughout the organisation, with bosses and allies of Lauer urging it was neither 'criminal' nor 'assault.'\n\nNevils said these comments caused her to vomit and her daily office life became tortuous.\n\nShe was eventually placed on medical leave and paid 'seven figures,' while being invited to paint NBC as exemplary in its handling of the furore, Farrow writes.\n\nSources at NBC told Variety they were yet to read the book, but they plan to defend the company against any of Farrow's criticisms.\n\nLauer was fired from his $25million-per-year post on Today hours after the woman informed NBC executives of the affair. Her lawyer claimed that there was an 'absence of consent' in the relationship.\n\nLauer and his wife Annette Roque (above in 2013) finalised their divorce last month, two years after they split amid the sexual misconduct allegations against him\n\nAt least four other women came forward in the wake of Lauer's firing with their own allegations of sexual harassment.\n\nOne woman told the Washington Post that the anchor exposed himself in his office and asked her to touch him.\n\nA second said she had sex with Lauer in his office in the middle of the work day and a third claimed that he gave her a sex toy.\n\nFormer Today production assistant Addie Zinone alleged that she had a troubled, but consensual, relationship with Lauer in 2000.\n\nLauer refused to comment on any allegations of misconduct, claiming in April 2018 that he wanted to 'protect' his family from 'embarrassment'.\n\nFarrow's book 'Catch and Kill: Lies, Spies, and a Conspiracy to protect Predators' is scheduled for release on October 15\n\nHe and his wife Annette Roque separated in the wake of the allegations and finalized their divorce earlier this month.\n\nThe couple had been together for over 20 years and share three children - son Jack, 18, daughter Romy, 15, and son Thijs, 12.\n\nLauer has hired a team of lawyers ahead of the October 15 release of 'Catch and Kill', Page Six reported, citing an informant who said the disgraced anchor and his team were given the opportunity to fact-check and comment on the book.\n\nPublishers at Little, Brown and Company declined to comment but said they are 'extremely proud of the important reporting in \"Catch and Kill\", which has been meticulously fact-checked and vetted'.\n\nFarrow, son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen, won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on the extensive cover-up of Weinstein's sexual misconduct on the leading edge of the #MeToo movement two years ago.\n\nThe upcoming book is marketed as 'the story of the women who risked everything to expose the truth', detailing 'surveillance and intimidation deployed by wealthy and connected men to threaten journalists, evade accountability and silence victims of abuse,' according to Little, Brown and Company.", "description": "Former NBC News journalist Brooke Nevils, who later embarked on an affair with the father-of-three in New York, claims she drank six shots of vodka before joining Lauer in his suite.", "authors": ["Ross Ibbetson For Mailonline"], "top_image": "https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2019/10/09/10/18942596-0-image-a-2_1570611641745.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
