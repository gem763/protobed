According to the National Hurricane Center, hurricane-force winds now extend outward up to 60 miles from the center, while tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 175 miles.\n\nThe International Space Station flew over Dorian on Sept. 2 and astronaut Nick Hague snapped this stunning image of the hurricane's eye.
