Tom Brady says one day he'll 'wake up and feel like that will be enough'", "language": "en", "text": "New England Patriots star quarterback Tom Brady for the first time has publicly indicated he may be moving on from the team, or may be even from his NFL career.\n\nBrady, on a weekly radio program appearance Wednesday, gave a cryptic outlook on how he views his future, that is if he lets his current contract expire in 2019 and becomes a free agent.\n\n'One day I'll wake up and feel like that will be enough. When that day comes, that day comes. I don't know if it will be after this year. I don't know if it will be five years from now,' Brady, 42, said on WEEI's 'The Greg Hill Show.'\n\nCould this be the end for New England Patriots star quarterback Tom Brady? The 42-year-old, three time NFL Most Valuable Player says in a recent radio broadcast, that ''One day I'll wake up and feel like that will be enough'\n\nDespite his remarks on WEEI's 'The Greg Hill Show' Wednesday, Brady was still about about what his next move will be, if he allows his current contract with the Patriots to expire next year. He is pictured above at Sunday's 33 to 0 win over the New York Jets\n\nSome speculate that Bradley has indicated he may be close to being done with the Patriots, and maybe his career, after he recently put his $39.5 billion Massachusetts house up for sale\n\n'But I don't have to determine those things right now either,' still being coy about what his next move will be, reports Reuters.\n\n'That's kind of a good part where I'm at,' he said. 'So I think just taking advantage of the opportunity that I have this year and do the very best I can do. Those decisions come at the more appropriate times.'\n\nWhen the end comes for the six-time Super Bowl champion has been a topic of speculation. Just two days earlier ESPN's Adam Schefter noted that Brady had put his $35 million house in Massachusetts up for sale on the eve of his free agent status.\n\n'(He's) setting it up to move on,' Schefter said before the start of Monday night's game pitting the Patriots against the Jets.\n\nThe New York team lost 33 to 0.\n\nBut the city hasn't lost when it comes to Brady, who with his model wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen, already owns a $20 million apartment in Manhattan's Tribeca section. New York is also where the TB12, fitness and wellness brand, which Brady backs, wants to open a new store, reports the New York Post.\n\nBrady could be already set up to leave the Patriots since he and his wife model wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen own a $20 million apartment in Manhattan's Tribeca section (pictured)\n\nNew York is also where the TB12, fitness and wellness brand, which Brady backs, wants to open a new store. A sign for the brand's Gillette Stadium location in Foxborough, Massachusetts, is pictured.\n\nBrady and his spouse also have been spotted house hunting in nearby New Jersey and Connecticut.\n\nBut Brady insists his future remains uncertain.\n\n'I think that's the great part for me, I don't know. I think that's been a unique situation that I've been in,' said the three-time NFL Most Valuable Player who's played for two decades, all with the Patriots.\n\n'I think when you commit to a team for a certain amount of years, you kind of feel like your responsibility is to always fulfill the contract,' he said. 'For me, it's been good because I'm just taking it day by day and I'm enjoying what I have. I don't know what the future holds, and the great part is, for me, football at this point is all borrowed time.'\n\nBrady and his model wife Gisele B\u00fcndchen (pictured at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art in May 2018) also have been spotted house hunting in New Jersey and Connecticut, which provide an easy commute into New York City, if that's where the quarterback's future lies\n\nBrady has said previously that he plans to stay in the game until age 45.\n\nHis record includes 180 completed passes out of of 273 for 1,992 yards with 11 touchdowns and four interceptions this season. The undefeated Patriots have won seven games, so far, and host the Cleveland Browns (2-4) on Sunday.\n\nBrady's 72,506 passing yards rank second on the NFL's all-time list behind New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees (74,845).\n\nBrady took his place in history after surpassing Peyton Manning on his first attempt of October 10th's game against the New York Giants.\n\nBrady moved past Manning (71,940) with a 19-yard completion to running back Sony Michel with 14:20 left in the first quarter, on the Patriots' second play from scrimmage.\n\nBrady entered the game with 71,923 yards. He passed Brett Favre (71,838) in October 6's victory over the Washington Redskins.\n\nBrady also passed Manning on the all-time completions list when he completed his fourth pass of the game, the 6,126th completion of his career. Brady sits only behind Brees (6,621) and Favre (6,300) in that category.", "description": "Has Tom Brady signaled the end of his days with the New England Patriots is near?
