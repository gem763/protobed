We've played a big role in the Territory's history and we want to be a part of its future,\" Ms Hayes said. The Country Liberal Party hasn't won the seat since 1994 but many believe the polished industry leader could prove to be a serious challenge for Minister Gunner. A recent poll showed Michael Gunner's approval rating sits at -43 per cent. Ms Hayes' preselection would provide a large boost to the CLP after it was annihilated at the 2016 election.
