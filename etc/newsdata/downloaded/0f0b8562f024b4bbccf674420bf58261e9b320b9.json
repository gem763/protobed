(Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nRudolph W. Giuliani, whose actions as President Trump\u2019s personal lawyer have helped set in motion an impeachment inquiry, abruptly canceled his scheduled paid appearance at a Kremlin-backed conference in Armenia next week.\n\nGiuliani, who confirmed to The Washington Post on Friday morning that he would attend the event, reversed himself that evening after The Post reported on his participation in the meeting, which Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin and other top Russian officials are expected to attend.\n\nThe two-day conference is sponsored by Russia and the Moscow-based Eurasian Economic Union, a trade alliance launched by Putin in 2014 as a counterweight to the European Union.\n\nAccording to an agenda for the event posted online, Giuliani was set to participate in a panel led by Sergey Glazyev, a longtime Putin adviser who has been under U.S. sanctions since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine five years ago.\n\nGiuliani said Friday evening that he was no longer planning to attend the meeting. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Putin was going,\u201d he said in a brief interview, adding in a text: \u201cDiscretion is the better part of valor.\u201d\n\nGiuliani\u2019s decision to take part in the conference astounded national security experts. His appearance would have come days after the release of a whistleblower complaint accusing Trump and Giuliani of pressuring Ukrainian officials for damaging information about Democrats.\n\n\n\nGiuliani meets with Armenian officials last year. (mil.am)\n\nTrump this summer withheld military aid from Ukraine, which counts on U.S. support to help fend off pro-Moscow separatists in the country\u2019s eastern provinces. As part of his efforts in Ukraine, Giuliani has said the focus on Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 election has overlooked what he claims was meddling by Kiev.\n\n[Whistleblower claimed that Trump abused his office and that White House officials tried to cover it up]\n\nThe agenda for the Eurasian conference showed Giuliani was the only American scheduled to speak at the gathering.\n\nIn an interview Friday before canceling his plans, Giuliani angrily rejected questions about whether it would be appropriate for him to attend the event at which he also appeared last year.\n\n\u201cI will try to not knowingly talk to a Russian until this is all over,\u201d he retorted.\n\nThe former New York mayor confirmed in the interview that he intended to accept payment for his appearance but declined to say how much he would have received or which group or person was going to pay him.\n\n\u201cIt goes to my company,\u201d Giuliani said.\n\nThe White House and State Department declined to comment.\n\nCurrent and former White House aides said there is internal exasperation with Giuliani\u2019s behavior and the fact that he does not clear his media appearances or paid speeches with the administration. Giuliani has said he works for the president in a personal capacity and does not take a salary from the government or the president.\n\nA spokesman for the Eurasian conference declined to comment on Giuliani but said Putin, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong are set to attend the conference in the Armenian capital of Yerevan on Tuesday.\n\nThe conference is a regular summit of the Eurasian Economic Union, an economic trading union whose members are Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia.\n\nIt is the brainchild of Putin and was created in response to democratic upheavals taking place at the time in former Soviet countries. Putin has aimed to use the group to establish Russia as a bulwark against Europe and a center of gravity in the former Soviet region, describing the EEU as \u201ca new supranational union that could become one of the poles of the modern world.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the group part of an effort to \u201cre-Sovietize the region.\u201d\n\nNational security experts said Giuliani\u2019s presence at the event could have bolstered the E.U. rival.\n\nDavid Kramer, a former State Department official responsible for Russia and Ukraine during the George W. Bush administration, called it \u201cterrible judgment\u201d for Giuliani to have agreed to attend, saying his participation would have lent \u201ccredibility to an organization Putin set up as an alternative to the European Union.\u201d\n\nMichael McFaul, who served as U.S. ambassador to Russia in the Obama administration, said he was surprised Giuliani would agree to attend the Eurasian conference, particularly since the organization was a flash point in Russian-Ukrainian tensions. He noted it was created by Putin at a time when Ukraine was considering joining the European Union.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember anything like this,\u201d McFaul said. He said Giuliani, as a private citizen, has a right to speak to any organization but called the conference an \u201codd\u201d choice.\n\n[In gambit for Trump, Giuliani engaged parade of Ukrainian prosecutors]\n\nAn agenda of the two-day summit says it is focused on transit in the region. The agenda, which was posted online in English, states clearly that Putin is set to take part in the official closing ceremony on Tuesday with Rouhani and leaders of the EEU\u2019s other member countries.\n\nGiuliani said Friday evening that \u201cI\u2019ve never seen the website,\u201d adding: \u201cI thought I was speaking at an Armenian security conference.\u201d\n\nIn a text, he added that the event \u201cwasn\u2019t that important.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need to give the Swamp press more distractions,\u201d he added.\n\nGiuliani had been scheduled to appear on a panel titled \u201cDigital financial technologies \u2014 new opportunities for integrating payment systems of the Eurasian continent in transport logistics.\u201d\n\nThe moderator listed on the agenda is Glazyev, an economist who served as one of Putin\u2019s top advisers until this August and who is viewed in Moscow\u2019s diplomatic circles as a possible successor to him. Next week, he is expected to be appointed to a top post at the commission that oversees the EEU.\n\nGlazyev was one of a number of senior Russian government officials sanctioned by the Obama administration in 2014 as punishment for Russia\u2019s incursion into Crimea.\n\nLast year, Giuliani was also listed as a participant in a panel moderated by Glazyev. In a photo posted online by the group, Giuliani can be seen standing at a lectern to the left of a group of seated men that include Glazyev.\n\nGiuliani told The Post on Thursday that he did not realize Glazyev would be present at last year\u2019s meeting before attending.\n\n\u201cWhen we found out he was on the panel, the head of my security detail said [to the organizers], \u2018The mayor is just going to be giving a speech and leaving, and if you don\u2019t like that, screw you,\u2019 \u201d Giuliani said.\n\nGiuliani said he could not remember whether he and Glazyev spoke at the event.\n\n\u201cI was discussing Russian collusion,\u201d he said, sarcastically. \u201cHe helped me tank the case. Do you know what an idiot you sound like right now?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does it matter what I did at the conference?\u201d Giuliani added.\n\nBefore backing out of the event, Giuliani said that he was unaware his panel at next week\u2019s conference was again scheduled to feature Glazyev.\n\nIn interviews this week, Giuliani has rejected any scrutiny of his conduct, saying attention instead should be put on his claims about former vice president Joe Biden and the Democrats.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not an idiot. I know you all are going after me. I know what you guys are doing with this,\u201d he said.\n\nFerris-Rotman reported from Moscow.
