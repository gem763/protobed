In 90 minutes he might not give you what he is giving you as an impact off the bench. That's clever management.\n\nI'm very aware that being a manager you have to put people in the right position and that is part of your skill. So I would give Marcelo Bielsa credit that Nketiah is coming off the bench and scoring.\n\nSome young players who start regularly lose their efficiency. They think they are ready for the 90 minutes but they aren't quite.\n\nI fully understand what Bielsa is doing and fully respect it - because he has been a manager for a long, long time.\n\nAt the minute - I wouldn't change a successful situation. Nketiah is still a very, very young man and every time he comes on, he scores. So why change anything?\n\nLeeds are improving week in, week out and I think they will be one of the two that go up automatically, because Bielsa is superb.\n\n(Image: Richard Lee/BPI/REX)\n\nIan Holloway is a pundit on EFL on Quest throughout the season.

His style suits them, going back to how Carlos Carvalhal played.\n\nThey thought they were on their way back then - but their nearest neighbours have usurped them.\n\nThat's football. That's exactly what happens. That is why Marco Silva is finding it difficult at Everton, because Liverpool are doing so well.\n\nYou look at your closest neighbours and you need rivalry, but you need to be doing well when they are. Otherwise your fans aren't very happy.\n\nWednesday actually started this by having a resurgence and reaching the playoffs a couple of times while Chris Wilder went to Sheffield United and got them promoted once then did it again.\n\nUnited went from being miles away from them to overtaking them, and Wednesday won't like that. But that's life and they have to deal with it - and Garry has made a tremendous start.\n\nRowett the man for Millwall\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nGary Rowett has a work ethic that you must have to go to Millwall. They want their teams to be up for it, on the front foot, aggressive and in your face.\n\nI think they've got a good manager. He will have learned from things that didn't go as he would have wanted at Derby and Stoke.\n\nThere is a very passionate side to Millwall's support and hopefully they will connect with Gary. I can see them having a good marriage and I wish him all the very best.\n\nSwansea vs Cardiff will be crazy\n\n(Image: Getty Images)\n\nWhat a passionate affair Swansea vs Cardiff is going to be. It's the craziest game of the weekend.\n\nSwansea made a great start to the season but had a bit of a dumping at the hands of Brentford in midweek, getting beat 3-0. Keep your eye on Brentford, they have won two in a row and are a very, very good side.\n\nCardiff are a little bit up and down under Neil Warnock but I expect them to gain momentum as the season progresses.\n\nIt's a huge match - the fact they haven't played each other for quite some time makes it even bigger - but please don't ask me to call the score!\n\nBoth teams have had some success and they want it back again - but let's make sure it's the football that does the talking and nothing in the stands.", "description": "In this week's EFL column, EFL on Quest pundit Ian Holloway discusses the on-loan Arsenal striker at Leeds", "authors": ["Ian Holloway", "Image", "Mark Cosgrove News Images Rex", "Richard Lee Bpi Rex", "Getty Images", "Quest"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20703716.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Preston-North-End-v-Leeds-United-EFL-Sky-Bet-Championship-Football-Deepdale-Preston-UK-22-Oct.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-24"}
