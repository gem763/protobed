McGregor, who never had a pro boxing match, stepping into the ring with an all-time great boxer was an especially risky proposition.\n\nBut McGregor was at the peak of his popularity, with a string of million-plus-selling pay-per-views and having won the featherweight and lightweight titles less than a year apart. So the bombastic Irishman got his way and became part of one of the biggest money one-night events in UFC history in August 2017, and even acquitted himself better than expected in his 10th-round TKO loss.\n\nNowadays? McGregor doesn\u2019t even dictate the terms of his own division.\n\nUFC president Dana White, who spent much of his youth in South Boston, sat down with The Boston Globe in the lead-up to Friday night\u2019s UFC on ESPN 6 event. The UFC boss told the Globe that, while he expects McGregor to fight, it\u2019s up to UFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov to decide which direction he wants to go next, not the other way around.\n\n\u201cKhabib is the man now,\u201d White said. \u201cConor isn\u2019t the man anymore, so Khabib gets to sit back and call the shots.\u201d\n\nDespite all his various missteps and legal issues in recent months, McGregor is still a drawing card. Whether it\u2019s a fight with Justin Gaethje or the winner of next month\u2019s Nate Diaz-Jorge Masvidal fight, one way or another, McGregor will find his way into a major event.\n\n\u201cNext month at Madison Square Garden, we\u2019ve got Diaz vs Masvidal, sold out,\u201d White said. \u201cSo whoever wins that fight could fight McGregor. We\u2019ve got \u2018Cowboy\u2019 Cerrone, we\u2019ve got Justin Gaethje, but what Conor wants right now really is the Khabib rematch. So we\u2019ll see how that whole thing plays out.\n\n\u201cBut if you\u2019re Khabib, you got the Tony Ferguson fight, George St. Pierre wants to fight, and you\u2019ve got the Conor McGregor fight.\u201d\n\nMcGregor lost to Khabib last year at UFC 229 by fourth-round submission.", "description": "Conor McGregor doesn't wield the power he used to, and Dana White says it's up to Khabib Nurmagomedov if wants a McGregor rematch.", "authors": ["Mma Junkie Staff", "Blue Corner", "Mike Bohn", "Dave Doyle"], "top_image": "https://usatmmajunkie.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/khabib-nurmagomedov-conor-mcgregor-ufc-229-pre-ap-3.jpg?w=1000&h=576&crop=1", "published_at": "2019-10-18"}
