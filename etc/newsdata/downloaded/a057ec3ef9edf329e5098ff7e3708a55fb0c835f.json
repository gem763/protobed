I called to say goodbye.\"\n\nShay, who had suffered a long illness, organised the stunt around a year ago over lunch and recorded the message on a phone with the help of son Jonathan. Shay was banging on a coffee table beside him for the full effect.\n\nImage copyright @Andrea36496119 Image caption Shay came up with the idea for the pre-recorded message a year ago.\n\nJonathan told the BBC that his dad was \"a larger than life character who always wanted to make people laugh\".\n\nHe said: \"He wanted something special and for everyone to remember him as he was, so that everyone, especially my mother, did not leave the graveside sombre. \"\n\nThe 41 year-old said he was surprised by the reaction the video has had online.\n\n\"I didn't realise it was being recorded at the time. It was supposed to be a moment for us as a family. It was only when I woke up this morning that I realised it had had such an impact.\"\n\nPosting on Twitter with the hashtag #Shayslastlaugh, Shay's daughter, Andrea, said: \"What a man. To make us all laugh when we were incredibly sad. He was some man for one man. Love you forever Poppabear.\"\n\nAnd speaking to those who wanted to send their condolences, she added: \"My dad wanted us to leave the cemetery laughing, and to celebrate his life... He would love to know how many people he made laugh! He was an amazing character.\"\n\nThe video has led many online to pay tribute to Shay but also share their own experiences of when they were able to see the funny side of grief.\n\nOn Reddit jessflyc told the story of when her dad died, just before last Christmas.\n\nShe said: \"We were waiting for the coroners to come pick him up and when they rang the doorbell it started playing a very cheery version of Jingle Bells. My family cracked up. It was just so odd. The coroners must have thought we were crazy when we opened the door giggling.\"\n\nThe Canadian Comrade also shared their story of the time their dad's ashes were delivered home by a crematorium office assistant.\n\n\"He showed up with a box and my aunt ran outside. 'Is this another gift? Who's the package from? It must be something good,' she said.\n\n\"The poor assistant was just shocked and my mom and I are laughing so hard we are almost literally on the ground. We still laugh about it and make fun of my aunt for that one.\"\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nThe Irish Defence Forces Veterans Association has also sent their \"sincerest condolences and prayers\" to Shay's family.", "description": "Shay Bradley's dying wish was to have a message played at his funeral from beyond the grave.", "authors": ["Kris Bramwell", "Bbc News"], "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1024x576/p07r116f.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-14"}
