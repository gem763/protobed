And now we say 'good luck. Good luck surviving.' Disaster.\" pic.twitter.com/ktyDqsM4lS \u2014 Bobby Lewis (@revrrlewis) October 7, 2019\n\nWhat kind of message is it? Pretty much the same one we sent Sunni tribal leaders in Iraq in 2011. Now we have a bipartisan track record of cutting and running.\n\nImmediately after getting blasted on Fox & Friends, Trump took to Twitter to defend the decision. Sure, the Kurds fought our battle against ISIS, Trump argued, but don\u2019t forget that we paid them \u201cmassive amounts of money and equipment to do so.\u201d It\u2019s no longer in our interest to fight ISIS, Trump says, and says that fight should be left to Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Russia:\n\n\u2026.including capturing thousands of ISIS fighters, mostly from Europe. But Europe did not want them back, they said you keep them USA! I said \u201cNO, we did you a great favor and now you want us to hold them in U.S. prisons at tremendous cost. They are yours for trials.\u201d They\u2026.. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\n\u2026.almost 3 years, but it is time for us to get out of these ridiculous Endless Wars, many of them tribal, and bring our soldiers home. WE WILL FIGHT WHERE IT IS TO OUR BENEFIT, AND ONLY FIGHT TO WIN. Turkey, Europe, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Russia and the Kurds will now have to\u2026.. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\n\u2026figure the situation out, and what they want to do with the captured ISIS fighters in their \u201cneighborhood.\u201d They all hate ISIS, have been enemies for years. We are 7000 miles away and will crush ISIS again if they come anywhere near us! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 7, 2019\n\nDid Trump watch Kilmeade before sending this? I\u2019d bet that\u2019s what prompted this thread. If that set Trump off, one can only imagine what he thought of Lindsey Graham\u2019s call into the show later, in which Graham called the idea \u201cunnerving to its core\u201d:\n\nOne of the president\u2019s strongest defenders in the Senate \u2014 Lindsey Graham of South Carolina \u2014 called into \u201cFox & Friends\u201d Monday morning, saying the president\u2019s decision \u201cimpulsive.\u201d \u201cI hope I\u2019m making myself clear how shortsighted and irresponsible this decision is in my view,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThis to me is just unnerving to its core.\u201d He said that ISIS is not defeated and that is \u201cthe biggest lie being told\u201d by this administration. Graham said he would be introducing a Senate resolution opposing this and ask for a reversal of the decision.\n\nTo put it mildly, this is disappointing but maybe not all that surprising. This was the same decision Trump wanted to take last December, one that prompted James Mattis to resign in protest. The backlash at that time forced Trump to back down, but he never changed his mind about the policy. This was inevitable, even if the timing might be even worse now than it was last December. He\u2019s in the middle of an impeachment fight in which he needs allies like Graham (whether Trump likes it or not). If they see Trump as an existential threat to the security of the US, they might not be so keen to offer public defenses of Trump, although Graham injects one here anyway.\n\nWell, at least this guy\u2019s happy about Trump\u2019s decision. Maybe he can start a morning show in DC.", "description": "Trump: Hey, the Kurds got \"massive amounts of money,\" so it's cool to leave.", "authors": ["Ed Morrissey", "John Sexton", "Jazz Shaw", "Karen Townsend"], "top_image": "https://hotair.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fox-friends-syria.png", "published_at": "2019-10-07"}
