Close to 29,000 cartridges were tucked away inside a Cadillac Escalade. Another 30,000 were stacked in a garage. Some were packaged in black boxes with colorful lettering, cheerful images of Fred Flintstone and descriptions of candy-like flavors like mai tai, strawberry shortcake and Fruity Pebbles.\n\nThey were the sorts of vaping products that have been identified as possible culprits in a perplexing lung illness that has sickened at least 800 people across the country and killed at least 14.\n\nAs health officials grapple with a public health crisis they are struggling to understand, police departments are in the midst of a swift crackdown on vaping products containing THC, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. In the Phoenix area, the authorities recently raided three homes over eight days, seizing hundreds of THC cartridges at each. In Wisconsin, detectives arrested two young brothers accused of running a large-scale THC cartridge assembly operation inside a condo. And in Nebraska, sheriff\u2019s deputies found a stash of cartridges in a car parked at a truck stop.", "description": "THC vaping cartridges have been found in disparate places, by varying numbers, suggesting a sprawling black market.", "authors": ["Julie Bosman", "Mitch Smith"], "top_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/27/us/00VAPING-POLICE04/00VAPING-POLICE04-facebookJumbo.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-01"}
