The committee called on authorities to ensure that \"logging is, and remains, strictly prohibited within the [protected] property, and that no logging operations are allowed in the buffer zones of the property if they could negatively impact natural processes.\"\n\nIn response, Gheorghe Mihailescu, Romsilva's general director, invited UNESCO specialists \"to evaluate how the rules of compliance are respected.\"\n\nTuesday's complaint raises the issue to the level of the European Commission \u2014 where concerns about deforestation have taken on new urgency following criticism of forestry practices in Brazil's Amazon rain forest.\n\nThe Commission in July published a strategy to tackle deforestation; the European Parliament is due to discuss the issue at a plenary session later this month.\n\nCarmen Avram, a newly elected Romanian MEP from the Socialists and Democrats, wants Brussels to crack down on illegal logging in Romania, according to a question she sent to the Commission in July.\n\nIt's personal for her. A documentary producer for Romanian TV, she said she \"was dealing a lot with reports of criminal deforestation in Romania so my very first concern as an MEP was to raise the issue in the European Parliament.\"\n\nShe said the country's forest authority has now asked her to visit her home country to \"see with my own eyes that now everything looks great. Well, I can agree we might finally have a more effective reforestation program, but 'great' is not the word I would use.\"", "description": "NGOs accuse Romania of improperly managing old-growth forests; the forest management company defends its practices.", "authors": ["Kalina Oroschakoff", "Arthur Neslen", "Hans Von Der Burchard"], "top_image": "https://www.politico.eu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/GettyImages-1052346710-1200x628.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-10"}
