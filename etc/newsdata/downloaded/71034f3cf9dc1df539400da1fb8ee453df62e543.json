REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nIt was the second time in less than a month that Alexander Vindman, an U.S. Army lieutenant colonel who sits on the National Security Council (NSC) and who listened in on the call, had contacted the lead NSC counsel about what he saw as inappropriate requests of Ukraine, according to his prepared testimony, seen by Reuters on Monday.\n\nIn the prepared remarks, Vindman said that if President Volodymyr Zelenskiy did as Trump asked in the July 25 call and investigated Biden, it would \u201cundermine U.S. national security.\u201d\n\nVindman, a veteran who was awarded a Purple Heart, will be the first current White House official to testify in the House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment inquiry, which was largely prompted by a whistleblower report on the call between Trump and Zelenskiy.\n\nOn the July 25 call, Trump pressed Zelenskiy to investigate Biden, a former vice president and a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination to run against Trump in 2020.\n\n\u201cI was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen, and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government\u2019s support of Ukraine,\u201d Vindman said in his prepared statement.\n\nHe voiced similar concerns to the NSC\u2019s lead counsel after a meeting on July 10, his prepared remarks say, as did Fiona Hill, a former NSC adviser on Russia who has testified to impeachment investigators.\n\nAt that meeting, Vindman said the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, told Ukrainian officials that they needed to \u201cdeliver specific investigations in order to secure a meeting with the President,\u201d at which point National Security Advisor John Bolton cut the meeting short.\n\nAfter the meeting, according to Vindman\u2019s prepared remarks, Sondland said it was important that the Ukrainian investigations center on the 2016 election, the Bidens and Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company whose board included Biden\u2019s son Hunter.\n\nThe president\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and others have made discredited allegations that when Biden was vice president, he had a prosecutor fired to halt an investigation into Burisma.\n\nBoth Vindman and Hill told Sondland his statements in the meeting were \u201cinappropriate,\u201d according to Vindman\u2019s prepared remarks.\n\nVindman\u2019s testimony is at odds with that of Sondland, who spoke to congressional investigators in closed hearings this month. Sondland told them he did not understand \u201cuntil much later\u201d that Burisma was connected to the Bidens.\n\nSondland said in his opening statement to them that he did not recall taking part in any effort to encourage an investigation into the Bidens.\n\nVindman could be an important witness in the probe. His statement notes his two decades in the Army, including combat in Iraq, where he was wounded.\n\n\u201cI am a patriot and it is my sacred duty and honor to advance and defend OUR country, irrespective or party or politics,\u201d Vindman says.", "description": "A high-ranking White House national security official will tell congressional impeachment investigators on Tuesday that he was so alarmed about a call in which U.S. President Donald Trump pushed Ukraine's leader to investigate former vice president Joe Biden that he reported it to a top government lawyer.", "authors": ["Karen Freifeld", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191029&t=2&i=1446070777&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9S08L", "published_at": "2019-10-29"}
