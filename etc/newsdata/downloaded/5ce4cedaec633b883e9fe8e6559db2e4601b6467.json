The stock price declined quickly at the market open, bottoming under $131 per share, before closing at $135.34.\n\n\"This is not the same old Caterpillar, where a shortfall like the one that we saw this morning would result in giant layoffs, a suspension of the buyback and maybe even a dividend slice,\" Cramer said.\n\nCEO Jim Umpleby, he noted, pledged to mitigate Caterpillar's episodic business model that made it a tough industrial stock to own. The \"new\" Caterpillar is doing more with less, he added.\n\n\"If you were listening to the conference call, you could tell the moment when the bad story turned good, because it's when the analysts' ... questions created a very positive impression,\" Cramer said. \"This new CAT is the kind of industrial you can stick with during a downturn. Rather than worrying about CAT, I think you should buy it into weakness, knowing you'll be protected by that buyback and that dividend.\"\n\nChipotle had a roller coaster of a trading day, surging above $814 before ending the session at $788.19. The restaurant company shattered quarterly estimates, turning in $3.82 earnings per share on $1.4 billion revenue. Same-store sales had double-digit growth, compared with the 9.3% that Wall Street expected.\n\nAlthough it lost more than 5.16% of value during the trading day, Chipotle's shares are up more than 82% this year.\n\n\"When I look over that quarter, I think you're being given a rare buying opportunity here,\" Cramer said. \"It had 11% same-store sales growth, for heaven's sake. The stock was due for some profit-taking.\"", "description": "Jim Cramer breaks down the counterintuitive trading in Chipotle and Caterpillar and instructs investors to buy the dip.", "authors": ["Tyler Clifford"], "top_image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/106057322-1564758138390rtx71yku.jpg?v=1571866219", "published_at": "2019-10-23"}
