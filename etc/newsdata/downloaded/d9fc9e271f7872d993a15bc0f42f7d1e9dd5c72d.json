Gripping a one-point lead with less than a minute to play, Sun players made good defensive decision after good defensive decision to keep the Mystics at bay.\n\nGame 4 was a tidy microcosm of a series that has been defined by wild swings of momentum. The Sun led twice by large margins \u2014 18 points in the first quarter and 16 in the third \u2014 only to see its leads disappear at the hands of the sharpshooting Mystics. Leading by one point with less than a minute to go, they survived by keeping Washington from getting a clean look in the game\u2019s final seconds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been hard in this series,\u201d Washington Coach-General Manager Mike Thibault said. \u201cWhoever digs themselves a hole, every team has come back in this series, both teams have come back. But it\u2019s hard when you\u2019re looking at the deficit we were looking at. I think it was 18 at one point, and the fact that we were ahead says a lot of good things, but then our execution once we got the lead was not great.\u201d\n\n[Mystics will try to block out the noise and close out the WNBA Finals at home]\n\nConnecticut did well shutting down the three Mystics starters who played significant minutes in the fourth quarter. All but four of the team\u2019s 18 points in the final period came from bench players, and Washington didn\u2019t get to the free throw line once in the final 10 minutes (the Sun went to the line eight times). Elena Delle Donne, playing with a herniated disk in her back that is pinching a nerve, didn\u2019t appear to be looking for her shot as aggressively as she normally might.\n\nStill, the Mystics can take some solace in the fact that the game was close until the end despite all five of Connecticut\u2019s starters scoring in double figures, the Sun out-rebounding Washington 39-29 and Connecticut making 23 free throws to the Mystics\u2019 10.\n\n\u201cIf we play our game from the start, we\u2019ll be fine,\u201d starting guard Natasha Cloud said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t come out ready to play. It took us until halftime to decide that we wanted to turn it on, and when you\u2019re down 18 and you have to fight back, you get their players back, you get them confident by letting them score and do whatever they want in the first half. We\u2019ve got to be better. . . . It\u2019s do-or-die time now. There\u2019s no talking about it, there\u2019s just doing it.\u201d\n\nJonquel Jones led the Sun with 18 points and 13 rebounds, and Maryland graduate Alyssa Thomas had 17 points. It wasn\u2019t exactly a problem for the Mystics to allow two Connecticut players to get hot, but permitting high-scoring nights from all five starters spelled doom \u2014 especially with neither Delle Donne nor Emma Meesseman contributing their normal amount of points.\n\nThe league MVP had 11 points on 5-for-8 shooting and took just one free throw. Meesseman\u2019s 12 points were crucial to the Mystics\u2019 second-half surge, but she didn\u2019t score before halftime.\n\nAerial Powers led Washington with a big 15-point performance off the bench, forward Ariel Atkins had 14 and Cloud had 13 points and seven rebounds.\n\n\u201cI was a little looser today, so I felt better,\u201d Delle Donne said of her back. \u201cHopefully I\u2019ll continue to progress and feel even better Thursday. But yeah, they were playing more aggressive defensively. They weren\u2019t just letting us sit outside and shoot threes comfortably. So I was trying to just draw attention by driving and hoping to get other people open.\u201d\n\nWashington had to claw and scratch its way through the second half of a potentially title-clinching game that looked out of reach at the start.\n\n[In Game 4, Mystics came all the way back \u2014 and nearly won \u2014 thanks to their bench]\n\nAfter a poor first half, the Mystics erased a 16-point deficit in the third quarter thanks in large part to a barrage of three-pointers. Meesseman had a crucial six points late in the third that gave Washington a needed push.\n\nThe Mystics and Sun started the fourth quarter with the score knotted at 68 and Thibault, in a move that both displayed his trust in the team\u2019s second unit and reminded spectators of Washington\u2019s depth, kept four bench players on the floor. Delle Donne didn\u2019t check in until midway through the quarter. By then, the score was still tied.\n\nWith Washington unable to complete the comeback, Delle Donne\u2019s team returns home with one last chance to secure the franchise\u2019s first league title.\n\n\u201cI will say this,\u201d Powers said afterward, \u201cthe only positive in this is being able to wrap it up at home and being able to celebrate with our fans and our family.\u201d", "description": "A topsy-turvy Game 4 ends with the Connecticut on top, 90-86, forcing a winner-take-all finale in Washington on Thursday.", "authors": ["Ava Wallace", "Reporter Covering Local Colleges", "Ava Wallace Covers College Sports With A Focus On Georgetown", "Navy", "Maryland", "As Well As Tennis", "The Wnba For The Washington Post.
