Frank Harris, also a touted dual-threat recruit as a Texas high school senior three years ago, is just getting started at UTSA.\n\nBrewer is set for his 18th start in 19 games with the Bears, and his 23rd game overall, when they host UTSA on Saturday. Harris will start and play in only his second game for the Roadrunners.\n\n\u201cWe had very, very high expectations from the moment we got here for Frank Harris, and it took a while to get here,\u201d said Roadrunners coach Frank Wilson, who after taking the job in January 2016 almost immediately began recruiting Harris, then a high school junior less than 30 miles from the UTSA campus.\n\nHarris was verbally committed to the Roadrunners before a torn ACL in his left knee midway through his senior season. He redshirted at UTSA in 2017, then sustained an ACL injury in his other knee before the 2018 season.\n\nMore than 1,000 days after playing his last game, Harris made his UTSA debut last Saturday in a 35-7 season-opening win over Incarnate Word. He set a school record for a debut by completing his first 13 passes, and finished 28 of 36 for 206 yards with three touchdowns. His 123 yards rushing broke the school record for a quarterback.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that we were surprised because we\u2019ve had good defenses over the years, and whether it was in a spring or a fall camp, he\u2019s flashed that against our very talented defenses,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cSo to see him do it against someone else was confirmation of something that we thought it would be.\u201d\n\nAs a returning starter for the Bears last season, Brewer early on shared snaps with a graduate transfer. He threw for 3,019 yards, finishing last year and going into his junior season as their clear No. 1 quarterback.\n\nIn a 56-17 season-opening win over Stephen F. Austin, Brewer was 21-of-31 passing for 199 yards and three touchdowns in just more than a half. Coach Matt Rhule said Brewer checked the Bears into the right plays on each of those TD passes.\n\n\u201cI think his ability now to really play like a pro, see what\u2019s happening and get us in the right play versus those pressures, to me, is the big difference,\u201d Rhule said.\n\nLONE POWER WIN\n\nUTSA, a program only in its ninth season, is 1-12 against Power Five conference teams. That lone win was 17-10 at Baylor two years ago. The Bears won 37-20 last year in the Alamodome.\n\nWAYS TO IMPROVE\n\nWhile Baylor had a lopsided victory in its opener, Rhule pointed out that the defense gave up four big plays and Bears quarterbacks got hit too often even without getting sacked.\n\n\u201cI always tell our team, you didn\u2019t play well, you didn\u2019t play bad, you played how you played,\u201d Rhule said. \u201cI do believe our biggest improvement though is always Week 1 to Week 2.\u201d\n\nBLOCK THAT KICK\n\nAfter blocking seven kicks last season, their most since 1989, the Bears blocked a punt and a field goal attempt in their opener against Stephen F. Austin. No other team nationally blocked two kicks last week.\n\n\u201cIt really comes down to players. If you ever notice our field goal block team, when they rush, they never look to see if the ball was made or not,\u201d Rhule said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it went through or not. All that matters is our effort. Anytime you start to have success in something, it starts to take hold and take root.\u201d\n\nEXTRA POINTS\n\nSincere McCormick ran 12 times for 74 yards last week against Incarnate Word, when he became the first true freshman to start at tailback for UTSA since the program\u2019s very first game on Sept. 3, 2011. \u2026 Baylor WR Denzel Mims has a catch in each of his last 25 games played, and is 49 yards receiving from 2,000 in his career. \u2026 UTSA had 11 different players catch passes in its opener; Baylor had 10.\n\n___\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "Charlie Brewer is finally entrenched as Baylor's quarterback, now in his third season starting games.
