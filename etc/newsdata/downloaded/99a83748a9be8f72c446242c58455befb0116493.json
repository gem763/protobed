This may mean the customer is unable to use an ATM or travel to an alternative cash machine, bank branch or one of the 200 retailers teaming up with the bank to offer cashback under a new scheme launching next year.\n\nCampaigners accuse the bank of failing to do enough to promote the cheque books. Meanwhile, customers are baffled by the decision to revert to an old-fashioned payment method.\n\nAn industry source adds that the cheque service is not built to sustain this number of customers. They accused Barclays of exploiting a loophole following the backlash.\n\nMoney Mail understands that just 387 customers of all banks nationwide are registered to cash cheques at the Post Office, and only 1,884 were processed last year.\n\nAs banks and ATMs close at an alarming rate, rural communities are increasingly dependent on the national network of 11,500 Post Offices for banking services.\n\nSince Barclays' shock announcement that it is ending its cash withdrawal service, Money Mail has been inundated with letters and emails from distraught customers unsure how they will now access their money.\n\nBanking chief must think again for sake of the elderly Plea: Jane Vass Director of Policy and Research at Age UK By JANE VASS, Director of Policy and Research at Age UK Imagine you are someone in their 80s, who lives in a village and no longer drives. There's no bus and no ATM \u2014 but there is a village shop with a Post Office counter, which is the centre of your community. And it's not only people in villages who are affected. A third of bank branches have closed since 2015, shops don't always offer cashback, and even if you live in a town and there is a bank branch only half a mile away, you may not be able to get there. Free ATMs are disappearing or being converted to paid-for ATMs at the rate of 600 a month, so if you do have access to one, you may have to pay to use it. These are the sorts of issues facing the older people who have written to us to express their dismay at Barclays' decision to stop offering customers cash withdrawals at the Post Office. They may have nowhere else to go to access that little bit of cash to buy a newspaper, pay the hairdresser who comes to their house, or to repay the carer or friend who buys some shopping for them. As long ago as 2001, Age UK's predecessor, Age Concern, was arguing for banks to make their services available through Post Offices. Not only would this benefit customers, we said, it would also make up to some extent for bank branch closures, and help to make the Post Office network financially sustainable by encouraging people to use it and through fees paid by banks \u2014 surely a win for all. However, we always felt that for this to be truly effective, all banks would have to be on board so there was a clear message: you can use the Post Office. It took more than ten years, but banks gradually joined in and, in 2015, all major High Street banks signed a deal to make core services accessible through Post Offices. That's why Age UK is urging Barclays to think again, and imploring other banks not to follow suit.\n\nMany are elderly, have mobility and health issues or are vulnerable and describe the Post Office as a lifeline.\n\nAnne Wood, 86, has struggled to use cash machines since her eyesight deteriorated. And even if she could, the village where she lives, near Christchurch, Dorset, does not have any ATMs.\n\nAccessing cash would mean waiting for an unreliable bus or taking an expensive taxi journey to the next nearest town.\n\nThe former primary school teacher says she has not been offered a special cheque book to withdraw cash and does not think much of the idea.\n\nShe says: 'Why could I not just use my normal cheque book, although even this wouldn't be as convenient as my debit card?\n\nAnd why is the restriction to \u00a3100 when I have a good balance? It will be much less bother to change to another bank. I am disgusted with Barclays.'\n\nSince Barclays' announcement that it is ending its cash withdrawal service, we have been inundated with letters from distraught customers unsure how they will access their money\n\nAnother customer, Mark Sims, who lives in South Hams, a rural, coastal part of Devon, says many elderly people in his village who are barely mobile rely on the Post Office as a lifeline.\n\n'There are no banks or cash machines in the village \u2014 the nearest bank branch is a 28-mile round trip and there is no decent public transport.'\n\nMark, 59, says Barclays' cheque book scheme is going 'three steps backwards', and adds: 'Aren't banks trying to stop people using cheques? This decision was not thought through and has ended up an utter mess.\n\n'If Barclays thinks the cheque book is a solution, it should offer one to all customers.' It is estimated that the move to axe cash withdrawals from Post Offices will save Barclays just \u00a37 million a year \u2014 a fraction of the \u00a317 million daily profit the bank is forecast to have made over the summer.\n\nLast week, 124 MPs signed a letter to chief executive Jes Staley urging him to reverse the decision.\n\nIn the meantime, experts are calling on the bank to at least offer its cheque book to every customer that wants one.\n\nGareth Shaw, head of money at Which?, says: 'Barclays' decision to offer cash withdrawals via cheque books to select customers will only further add to confusion, and does nothing to help the huge numbers of people who will be excluded from this measure and left feeling abandoned.'\n\nWatchdog the Payment Systems Regulator says it is concerned about the impact Barclays' decision will have on customers. It will closely monitor the steps the bank plans to take to make sure there are suitable alternatives.\n\nThe Financial Conduct Authority says: 'We require all regulated firms to treat customers fairly.\n\nAccess to cash and other banking services is vital for communities, financial inclusion and the resilience of the economy. We expect banks to make arrangements for these services to be provided.\n\n'Barclays need to ensure that they identify the customers most impacted, particularly those who are vulnerable, and the availability of alternative ways of accessing cash.'\n\nBarclays refuses to disclose how many cheque books have been sent to customers, but says it expects demand to be low, as in most cases it should be able to identify a nearby free ATM or retailer offering cashback for customers to use instead.\n\nIt has promised to freeze branch closures for two years where the branch is 'Last in Town'.\n\na.murray@dailymail.co.uk", "description": "Barclays is offering customers cheque books so they can get cash at Post Offices.
