Fewer millennials (34%) think they earn more (the remaining 21% selected \"don't know\").\n\nThe survey polled 2,096 Americans about their financial health, debt, and earnings for a new series, \"The State of Our Money.\" More than 670 respondents were millennials, defined as ages 23 to 38 in 2019.\n\nThat the majority of millennials think they earn less money than the rest of their cohort is reflective of the stagnant wages they're experiencing. Americans ages 25 to 34 on average have seen incomes increase by just $29 since 1974 when adjusted for inflation, according to a SuperMoney report that analyzed US Census Bureau data. That year, they were earning an average of $35,426. By 2017, that rose to a mere $35,455.\n\nOlder millennials have it particularly hard. They graduated in the midst of the Great Recession and entered a tough job market; a delay in finding a job, or starting your first job with a low salary, can ultimately affect long-term earning potential.\n\nMillennials think they have less debt than their peers\n\nHowever, millennials are slightly more positive about their debt situation in comparison to their friends \u2014 48% think they have less debt than their peers, while 35% think they have more. Seventeen percent said they didn't know.\n\nThey're both right and wrong, according to additional survey findings.\n\nOnly about 28% of millennial respondents have a mortgage, so most millennials aren't carrying the debt of homeownership. But of those who do have a mortgage, half owe more than $100,000, while the other half owe less.\n\nMost of those who have credit-card debt do owe less than their peers \u2014 more than half of the survey respondents with credit-card debt owe less than $5,000. However, it's worth noting that more than half of millennial respondents carry credit-card debt in the first place \u2014 so even if they owe little, they still owe more than those who don't have credit-card debt at all.\n\nAround 28% of millennial respondents have undergrad student-loan debt, meaning the majority aren't faced with this burden. If millennials are reading anything about the student-debt situation, those who don't have it are likely to think they have less debt than the rest of their generation. The same is probably true for those who do have student-loan debt, but owe less than the nearly $30,000 average.", "description": "Millennials are pretty grim about their wages \u2014 at least when they compare themselves to the rest of their generation.", "authors": ["Hillary Hoffower"], "top_image": "https://image.businessinsider.com/5db9abe4dee0196d490f6e8e?width=1200&format=jpeg", "published_at": "2019-10-30"}
