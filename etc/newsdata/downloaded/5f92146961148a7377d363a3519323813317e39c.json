I was actually dozing off and it startled me awake,\" passenger Sam German told ABC 7 Chicago. \"We just heard something pop and then like a rattle. It sounded like a flat tire basically,\" he added. USA TODAY has reached out to Southwest for further details regarding the tires.\n\nAnother passenger, Jill Ariola, told the outlet, \"If you ever had a flat tire, it was the same type of deal. You kind of hear it flap flap flap, and then we just listed a little bit. The pilot did a great job. There was no swerving; there was no drama.\"\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nAttention travelers 65 and older: Southwest Airlines getting rid of its senior discount fares\n\nNo 737 Max for holidays: United joins Southwest, American in pushing plane's return to 2020\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2019/10/15/southwest-evacuates-flight-chicago-after-tires-blow-out/3983589002/", "description": "Southwest Airlines\u00a0evacuated a flight Monday morning at Chicago\u2019s Midway International Airport, blaming a hydraulic issue with the landing gear.", "authors": ["David Oliver", "Published A.M.
