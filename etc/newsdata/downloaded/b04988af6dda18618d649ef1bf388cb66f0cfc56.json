And inside the courtroom was just as busy, with five lawyers appearing before the justices.\n\nPamela Karlan, a professor at Stanford Law School, argued on behalf of the gay employees in Bostock v. Clayton County and Altitude Express v. Zarda. Jeffrey Harris, a lawyer with the firm Consovoy McCarthy, made his Supreme Court debut representing the employers in Bostock and Zarda.\n\nDavid Cole of the American Civil Liberties Union represented the transgender employee, while John Bursch of Alliance Defending Freedom argued for the person\u2019s employer in Harris Funeral Homes v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. U.S. Solicitor General Noel Francisco shared time with the employers in both arguments.\n\nFollowing a new rule announced last week by the high court, the justices allowed each advocate to make a two-minute presentation before jumping in with questions.\n\nSome common themes from the justices\u2019 questions were what \u201csex\u201d meant in 1964, whether the court should act when Congress could amend the law, and what this could mean for single-sex bathrooms, sports, and more.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was the first to fire off a question. She brought up the fact that when Congress passed Title VII as part of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, it couldn\u2019t have been in Congress\u2019 mind that discrimination \u201cbecause of sex\u201d meant discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nGinsburg underscored this point by noting that homosexuality was at that time classified as a mental disorder, and many states criminalized sodomy.\n\n>>>Listen to \u201cSCOTUS 101,\u201d a podcast with Elizabeth Slattery and friends bringing you up to speed on what\u2019s happening at the Supreme Court.\n\nKarlan admitted that is true\u2014calling it the \u201cdays of \u2018Mad Men,\u2019\u201d in a reference to the hit TV series\u2014but said the court has interpreted Title VII to cover other things that weren\u2019t within Congress\u2019 mind, such as sexual harassment and sex stereotyping.\n\nWhen Harris took the lectern, he explained that sex and sexual orientation are \u201cindependent and distinct characteristics,\u201d and that Title VII requires courts to compare similarly situated people for differential treatment.\n\nFrancisco echoed this, saying that sex means \u201cwhether you\u2019re male or female, not whether you\u2019re gay or straight.\u201d He argued that any doubt regarding the meaning of sex in Title VII \u201cis removed by the history \u2026 and related statutes since.\u201d\n\nJustice Samuel Alito noted that Congress has considered various proposals to amend Title VII and, in fact, the House of Representatives passed the Equality Act last spring. He asked whether the courts should leave this policy issue to the legislative branch.\n\nKarlan countered that a ruling that sex discrimination includes sexual orientation would be no different from the court\u2019s earlier rulings finding male-on-male sexual harassment and sex stereotyping were forms of sex discrimination.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts pointed out that roughly two dozen states have passed laws prohibiting employment discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and many have at the same time provided robust protections for religious liberty.\n\nHarris picked up on this point, noting that Wisconsin was hailed as a civil rights pioneer when it passed a law banning sexual orientation discrimination in employment in 1982. Such laws would not have been necessary, he said, if Title VII\u2019s ban on sex discrimination already included sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nFrancisco also addressed this point, saying that Congress is better suited to weigh the competing interests at stake and address the need for religious or other exemptions. He suggested the Supreme Court should not short-circuit the democratic process and instead allow Congress to work out what changes, if any, the American people want to see in Title VII.\n\nThe justices spent a lot of time talking about whether employees\u2019 interpretation of Title VII would spell doom for single-sex bathrooms, sex-specific dress codes, single-sex college sports teams, and shelters for battered women.\n\nTitle VII, after all, is a statute promoting women\u2019s equality, Bursch pointed out, and it allows employers to acknowledge that there are differences between men and women.\n\nBut the ACLU\u2019s Cole tried to avoid answering these questions, eventually responding that one has to consider \u201cnot just whether [a single-sex or sex-specific policy] differentiates, but whether it differentiates in a way that injures,\u201d and whether a reasonable person would experience \u201ca significant or trivial harm.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost instances, that\u2019s not going to be a significant harm,\u201d Cole said, but when, for example, \u201cyou ask a transgender person to dress in a way that is contrary to their sense of gender identity, you have imposed a significant harm.\u201d\n\nKarlan put it slightly differently, explaining that you first look for people being treated differently based on their sex, and then you ask if a reasonable person would be injured by that differential treatment.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch wanted to know how one decides what is \u201creasonable.\u201d Karlan replied that an \u201cidiosyncratic preference\u201d wouldn\u2019t void a dress code or bathroom policy.\n\nAnyone hoping for clarity after the day\u2019s argument was left wanting. After two hours of oral argument and dozens of questions, there was not much agreement among the justices.\n\nJustices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor suggested several times that they think the text clearly favors the employees\u2019 view. Alito and Roberts mentioned concerns about the court\u2019s overstepping its boundaries.\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh, the high court\u2019s newest justice, barely spoke at all. The justices will take the next several months to wrestle with the questions in these cases and likely issue rulings by the end of June.", "description": "The Supreme Court, returning this week for the beginning of its 2019-2020 term, heard oral argument Tuesday in three cases asking it to decide whether the definition of sex in U.S. law includes sexual orientation and gender identity.\u00a0\n\nAt issue is the meaning of the word \u201csex\u201d in Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the primary federal law prohibiting discrimination in employment.", "authors": ["Elizabeth Slattery", "Legal Fellow", "Appellate Advocacy Program Manager", "Meese Center For Legal", "Judicial Studies", "Elizabeth Slattery Researches", "Writes On The Rule Of Law", "Separation Of Powers", "Civil Rights", "Other Constitutional Issues."], "top_image": "https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/styles/facebook_optimized/public/images/2019-10/GettyImages-1174524784.jpg?itok=2TA4dvRn", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
