President Donald Trump and other Republicans have also accused companies like Facebook and Twitter of building an anti-conservative bias into their content moderation decisions, a claim for which there's no clear evidence.\n\nThe upstart social network, which became the most downloaded app in the U.S. in 2018, argues that it stands apart from those more established forebears. \u201cI joined TikTok at the start of this year because I found the platform's fun and entertaining environment to be a breath of fresh air in an online world that has increasingly migrated toward argument and divisiveness,\u201d Pappas wrote in the blog post. \u201cTikTok is different. Our mission is to inspire creativity and bring joy.\u201d\n\nThe broad Washington backlash against Silicon Valley isn't the only potential political pitfall facing TikTok. It's owned by Beijing-based tech company ByteDance and is becoming wildly popular just as U.S. policymakers fret about the rise of Chinese technology and telecom firms. The Trump administration and a large, bipartisan bloc of lawmakers say such companies pose a national security risk given Beijing's tight control over, and entanglement with, companies that operate in China.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) last week urged the government to investigate ByteDance by reviewing its 2017 acquisition of musical.ly, another social video platform that ByteDance merged with TikTok. \"Ample & growing evidence exists that TikTok\u2019s platform for western markets, including the U.S., are censoring content in line with #China\u2019s communist government directives,\" Rubio tweeted.\n\nThe firm's executives are already showing signs they may be bracing for Washington attention. ByteDance registered to lobby in the U.S. starting in June, listing \"general issues affecting internet companies\" among its priorities. U.S. firm Covington & Burling also registered to lobby on behalf of ByteDance in July to \"provide advice on technology policy issues.\"\n\nPOLITICO NEWSLETTERS Morning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Indian government officials weighed banning the app due to fears about sexually explicit material, according to a February report. Bark, an app aimed at helping parents safeguard the online well-being of their children, had suggested this spring that \u201cTikTok is quickly becoming a hotbed of abuses ranging from cyberbullying to sexploitation.\u201d\n\n\u201cTikTok has no broader parental controls,\u201d Bark wrote in a March blog post. \u201cEven if you set your own account to private, you may still be exposed to sexual or violent content posted to the public feed.\u201d\n\nTikTok, however, pledges that these content issues will be a growing focus for the firm and part of its desire to keep users feeling safe and comfortable on the network.\n\n\u201cThese steps are just the latest efforts in our ongoing commitment to maintaining the app experience users expect while providing them the protections they deserve, and we will continue to provide updates and transparency in the months and years ahead,\u201d Pappas said Tuesday.", "description": "", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://static.politico.com/87/84/79c8d5c1421db24216d0b41c739e/191015-tiktok-ap-773.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-15"}
