REUTERS/Jason Lee/Illustration/File Photo\n\nThe greenback was a little weaker against the yuan and the Australian and New Zealand dollars as well as the euro, though movements were slight as caution tempered enthusiasm for risk.\n\n\u201cAll it takes is one tweet, one headline to change the landscape,\u201d analysts at OCBC Bank in Singapore said in an email.\n\n\u201cThe current situation points to a heavy USD posture, but given the shifty sentiments, we urge caution in excessively chasing the risk-on trades higher.\u201d\n\nTop U.S. and Chinese negotiators wrapped up a first day of trade talks on Thursday, with U.S. President Donald Trump describing the meetings as \u201cvery, very good negotiation with China\u201d.\n\nBusiness groups, too, expressed optimism the two sides might be able to ease a trade war that has sapped economic growth around the globe.\n\nAnd a scheduled meeting between Trump and China\u2019s Vice Premier Liu He, the chief Chinese negotiator, at 1845 GMT is seen as a further positive, after the U.S. blacklisting of some Chinese technology firms made for a bumpy lead-in to the talks.\n\nImproved risk appetite pushed the safe-haven yen JPY= lower to 108.00 per dollar, its weakest since Oct. 1, and lifted the Chinese yuan CNY= to 7.0983 per dollar, its strongest since Sept. 23.\n\n\u201cInvestors are ready to celebrate any form of a U.S.-China trade deal, even a limited one,\u201d said FXTM analyst Han Tan.\n\nAgainst a basket of currencies the greenback was a little softer at 98.655 .DXY. The Australian dollar AUD= rose 0.3% to a two-week high of $0.6782 and the kiwi NZD= edged higher to $0.6320.\n\nAlso undermining the dollar, data showed on Thursday U.S. consumer prices were unchanged in September and underlying inflation retreated, supporting expectations the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in October.\n\nThe euro EUR= rose 0.1% to $1.1013.\n\nSterling was little changed, but at $1.2437 sat just under a two-week high it hit after soaring 2% overnight, its largest daily percentage gain in seven months, driven by hopes for a Brexit resolution.\n\nIrish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Thursday a Brexit deal could be clinched by the end of October to allow the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, after what he called a very positive meeting with Boris Johnson.\n\nIreland is a major factor in the prolonged Brexit impasse, though details of the pair\u2019s discussion or parameters of a possible breakthrough were scarce.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot to play for still and the script can change at any moment in Brexit, so it\u2019s tough staying long GBP for any period of time,\u201d said Chris Weston, head of research at brokerage Pepperstone in Melbourne.\n\n\u201cIt does feel that ahead of the (British parliament meeting on) 19th October that traders will be buyers of weakness, but it\u2019s risky and, given the implied volatility, I would be keeping my position size to a minimum.\u201d", "description": "Hopes of progress in U.S.-China trade talks held down the dollar and lifted riskier currencies on Friday, while optimistic comments from Europe on Brexit boosted the British pound.", "authors": ["Hideyuki Sano", "Min Read"], "top_image": "https://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20191011&t=2&i=1439551841&w=1200&r=LYNXMPEF9A0AN", "published_at": "2019-10-11"}
