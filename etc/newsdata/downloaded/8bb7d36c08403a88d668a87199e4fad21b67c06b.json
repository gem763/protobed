Kavanaugh listens to senators make their opening statements during his Supreme Court confirmation hearing in September 2018. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post)\n\nIn a head-spinning few days, Republicans have moved into a full offensive posture over the latest allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, leaving congressional Democrats in a defensive crouch as they try to change the subject.\n\nTuesday\u2019s dueling news conferences, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), perfectly captured the new dynamic.\n\nAfter their respective policy lunches, McConnell devoted his entire opening remarks, more than three minutes, to the Kavanaugh issue, highlighting a clarification the New York Times added to a story about how an alleged victim did not recall an alleged incident of sexual misconduct during the justice\u2019s college days.\n\n\u201cI think it is truly outrageous. We had this investigation a year ago; we had this vote a year ago,\u201d McConnell told reporters.\n\nThat came after McConnell, opening the Senate floor Monday, devoted his entire remarks, more than five minutes, to the Kavanaugh issue with just as much indignation.\n\nSchumer never mentioned the latest Kavanaugh imbroglio in Tuesday\u2019s opening comments and appeared exhausted when the topic came up as the very first question.\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019ve said this before, very simply. I never thought Kavanaugh should be on the bench, and I still don\u2019t today,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nIn Senate floor speeches Monday and Tuesday, Schumer covered the waterfront of pending issues: President Trump\u2019s ongoing demands for more money to build a barrier at the border, the overall government funding deadline of Sept. 30, potential gun-control legislation and even a federal regulatory review of Chinese telecom firms.\n\nNo Kavanaugh.\n\nSince the first allegations emerged a year ago Monday, in a Washington Post story, the Kavanaugh saga has evolved in a familiar refrain.\n\n[Inaction on Kavanaugh allegations reignites political rancor]\n\nSeemingly credible accusations get made; Democrats pounce and demand investigations. Republicans grow quiet, until some other allegation emerges that appears to go too far. Then Republicans go into full umbrage mode, pushing Democrats back until the nominee is confirmed (or, in this week\u2019s case, until Democrats change the subject).\n\nSome Democrats acknowledged that the ground had completely shifted. The Post\u2019s Seung Min Kim asked Sen. Richard J. Durbin (Ill.), the No. 2 Democrat in leadership, if Republicans were enjoying this story.\n\n\u201cWell, they are,\u201d he said.\n\nAt that moment on Tuesday, a GOP senator was holding the floor blasting those Democrats who were calling for Kavanaugh\u2019s impeachment over the issue, including two senators running for the 2020 presidential nomination, Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.).\n\nDurbin lamented that so many jump to impeachment, whether of Trump or other administration officials. It is virtually impossible to get to a two-thirds majority for a conviction in the Senate \u2014 which means any impeachment would divert the Democratic-led House\u2019s energy from kitchen-table issues.\n\n\u201cYou know, it\u2019s become a knee-jerk reaction among many Democrats that if you\u2019re unhappy with President Trump or some of his appointments, impeachment is a recourse. It\u2019s rare in American history,\u201d the Democratic whip said.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t believe that this is what we should be doing at this point. I mean, I voted against the man; I don\u2019t believe he should be on the Supreme Court,\u201d he added.\n\nSenior House Democrats have also tried to sidestep the Kavanaugh matter, although their inquiry into Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign has the potential to turn into its own impeachment process.\n\n\u201cWe are concentrating our resources on determining whether to impeach the president,\u201d Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, told a New York radio station Monday.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), asked whether the House needed to look into the new allegation against Kavanaugh, said \u201cno.\u201d\n\nAs a senior member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Durbin had a front-row seat for last September\u2019s epic clash over Kavanaugh. It played out in similar fashion, albeit in a longer, slower process than these past few days.\n\nOn Sept. 16, 2018, The Post story landed, with Christine Blasey Ford, a professor in Palo Alto who grew up in the Maryland suburbs at the same time as Kavanaugh, accusing him of pinning her to a bed during a high school party and trying to take her clothes off.\n\nKavanaugh denied the allegation.\n\nComing on the heels of the #MeToo movement, the claim knocked Republicans back on their heels. They agreed to hold a hearing with Ford and then Kavanaugh to address the issues, but Republicans were afraid to be seen even asking Ford or the nominee about the allegations, so they hired a female Arizona prosecutor to ask the questions.\n\nAs the hearing approached, more allegations surfaced against Kavanaugh, most prominently from high-profile attorney Michael Avenatti\u2019s client talking about gang rape parties.\n\n[In the Trump era, Sen. Susan Collins\u2019s declaration as a New England moderate is challenged]\n\nWhen the hearing unfolded, Ford\u2019s testimony was poised and, to most senators, credible. Midway through questioning of Kavanaugh, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) started asking his own questions, latching on to the most fantastic allegations and asking the then-federal judge if he had committed those crimes.\n\nIt conflated the stories and made the entire process look bad, which created a conservative rallying cry on behalf of Kavanaugh. He won confirmation, with just 50 votes, on Oct. 6.\n\nThat clash helped galvanize conservative voters, who helped Republicans flip Senate seats in the red-leaning states of Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota, adding to the GOP majority during a midterm election that was otherwise miserable for Trump\u2019s party.\n\nNow, Democrats fear that this is deja vu, all over again.\n\nThe New York Times posted a story Saturday night by two reporters summarizing findings of their new book, which appeared to back up a claim of sexual misconduct by Kavanaugh while at Yale University.\n\nSuch verification would raise the possibility that the justice lied to the Senate in his hearing last September, a potentially impeachable offense. Harris and Warren called for impeachment hearings.\n\nBut the Times story included another allegation of similar behavior that drew most of the attention, until editors posted an update Sunday that included the denial by the alleged victim.\n\nLike Graham a year ago, Republicans jumped on this journalistic mishap to try to destroy the overall content of the book. \u201cI\u2019m distressed by the declining journalistic principals, so much on display,\u201d McConnell said Tuesday.\n\nWhile Democrats tried to turn the focus back to gun legislation, the GOP leader signaled that he was happy to keep talking about the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake about it,\u201d he said Tuesday, \u201cJustice Kavanaugh is going to be on the Supreme Court as long as he chooses to serve.\u201d\n\nRead more from Paul Kane\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "description": "Republicans eagerly focused on the latest claims about the Supreme Court justice, trying to use the issue against the Democratic Party.", "authors": ["Paul Kane", "Senior Congressional Correspondent", "September At Am", "Paul Kane Is The Washington Post'S Senior Congressional Correspondent", "Columnist.
