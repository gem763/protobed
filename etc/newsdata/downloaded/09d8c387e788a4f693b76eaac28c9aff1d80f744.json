Back in July, Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler objected to a statement Sanders made in the first debates in the Democratic presidential primaries: \u201cThree people in this country own more wealth than the bottom half of America.\u201d Kessler acknowledged that \u201cthis snappy talking point is based on numbers that add up.\u201d But then he added that \u201cit\u2019s also a question of comparing apples to oranges.\u201d According to Kessler, it makes no sense to compare rich apples like Jeff Bezos (who own real capital) with millions of poverty-stricken oranges (who possess only debt). In Kessler\u2019s words, \u201cpeople in the bottom half have essentially no wealth, as debts cancel out whatever assets they might have.\u201d Ad Policy\n\nKessler\u2019s puzzling rebuttal drew much criticism, including sharp words from John Nichols of The Nation. Simply on logical terms, it\u2019s hard to understand why one should exclude the poor from comparisons with the rich simply because the poor have debt rather than capital. Indebtedness combined with a lack of assets, after all, is a big part of the condition of being poor. By Kessler\u2019s reasoning, it\u2019s impossible to compare the rich with the poor at all.\n\nLast Wednesday, the Post took issue with a Sanders tweet that stated, \u201c500,000 Americans will go bankrupt this year from medical bills.\u201d The fact-checker acknowledged that Sanders was providing an accurate gloss on some of the scholarly literature on this topic, including an editorial from the American Journal of Public Health (AJPH). But the fact-checker claimed that the \u201cAJPH editorial did not undergo the same peer-reviewed editing process as a research article.\u201d This assertion is misleading: The editorial was appropriately peer-reviewed.

But the Post\u2019s preferred study differs on methodological grounds that are themselves shaky and contestable: The study takes an extremely narrow view of causation and counts only people whose bankruptcy was \u201ccaused by a hospitalization.\u201d It only takes a moment\u2019s reflection to realize that there are many other ways that medical debt can accrue aside from hospitalization, including loss of income. The AJPH editorial is on firmer ground in recognizing that people who suffer from health problems are likely pushed into poverty by multiple interconnected factors that are not in reality separable.\n\nAs with the earlier fact-check on inequality, The Washington Post is trying to use fact-checking as an ideological weapon. Sanders is under attack not for making false statements, but for calling attention to facts that are politically unpalatable for those who are happy with the economic status quo. It\u2019s unclear why the Post so often goes after Sanders in such a myopic fashion: The paper denies that its coverage is influenced by billionaire owner Jeff Bezos, but institutional bias can be more subtly grounded in factors like the economic class of the editors or the newspaper\u2019s being embedded in elite Washington culture.\n\nWith these polemics-disguised-as-rebuttals, the Post is discrediting the entire journalistic genre of fact-checking. This is dangerous in a way that goes beyond any damage it does to Sanders as a presidential candidate. In truth, Sanders has little to worry about. The fact-checks are so ludicrous that they are unlikely to sway any voters. What they are more likely to do is feed into a pervasive distrust of the mainstream media, which is bad for democracy.

As is well known, Trump is a pathological liar on a scale never seen before in American politics. He makes Richard Nixon and Joseph McCarthy look like Boy Scouts. Many journalists, notably Daniel Dale of CNN, have done a commendable job in keeping track of Trump\u2019s unending Niagara of prevarication, fibs, invention, and nonsense. Current Issue View our current issue\n\nTrump himself worries about the danger that the media will hold him accountable, which is why he mocks fact-checking. On Monday, he tweeted, \u201cThe LameStream Media has gone totally CRAZY! They write whatever they want, seldom have sources (even though they say they do), never do \u2018fact-checking\u2019 anymore, and are only looking for the \u2018kill.\u2019 They take good news and make it bad. They are now beyond Fake, they are Corrupt\u2026. The good news is that we are winning. Our real opponent is not the Democrats, or the dwindling number of Republicans that lost their way and got left behind, our primary opponent is the Fake News Media. In the history of our Country, they have never been so bad!\u201d\n\nMaggie Haberman of The New York Times offers a useful gloss on Trump\u2019s tweets: \u201cA Trump adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said weeks ago that the president, whose own approval ratings have stayed upside down, needs voters to feel negatively not just about his opponents but about longstanding institutions.\u201d\n\nHaberman\u2019s analysis is persuasive: Trump\u2019s path to reelection runs through discrediting any independent institution that might hold him accountable, be it the FBI, congressional Democrats, or the mainstream media.\n\nUnfortunately, media outlets sometimes help Trump along in his desire to tarnish them as reliable independent sources of truth. The Washington Post is doing journalism no service by turning fact-checking, which should be grounded in empirical evidence, into a tool for polemical mudslinging. We need accurate, sober, well-aimed fact-checking more than ever to document Trump\u2019s many lies\u2014as well as the occasional false statements of other politicians (including Sanders). Unfortunately, the Post has decided to expand the parameters of fact-checking in a way that undermines the entire enterprise.\n\nThe mainstream media has already lost the MAGA-heads who agree with Trump\u2019s crusade against \u201cfake news.\u201d Now it might also lose the millions of Americans who recognize that Sanders\u2019s presentation of economics is closer to the mark than the Post\u2019s bizarre exercises in politically motivated nit-picking.", "description": "The Washington Post is feeding into Trump\u2019s agenda by turning fact-checking into an ideological weapon.", "authors": ["Jeet Heer", "Today Am", "Yesterday Pm", "September", "Tom Tomorrow", "Calvin Trillin", "Kelli Russell Agodon", "Jen Sorensen", "Our Readers", "The Nation"], "top_image": "https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Sanders-paper-ap-img.jpg", "published_at": "2019-09-03"}
