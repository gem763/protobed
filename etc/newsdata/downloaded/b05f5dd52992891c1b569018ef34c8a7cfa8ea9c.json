Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, the most high-profile member of the personal legal team during both the Russia investigation and the Democrats\u2019 ongoing impeachment inquiry, is providing free legal services to the president.\n\nIn an interview earlier this month with Yahoo News, Giuliani responded with an unequivocal \u201cYes, sir\u201d when asked if he is representing Trump pro bono, including covering expenses. Jay Sekulow, Trump\u2019s other main personal attorney, says his work for Trump is paid, but declined to say by whom or how much.\n\nUntil now, Trump\u2019s legal arrangements have been in a gray area of regulation, but critics are trying to change that and the OGE is currently considering establishing new rules for how members of the executive branch can pay for their personal legal needs.\n\nCraig Holman, a lobbyist for Public Citizen, a nonprofit, nonpartisan foundation dedicated to combating corruption, has petitioned the OGE to establish guidelines covering personal attorneys for executive branch officials. Holman, who testified before the office earlier this month, described the current situation \u2014 where there are few guidelines and it is unclear where Trump\u2019s lawyers are getting their money from \u2014 as \u201cthe Wild West.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Office of Government Ethics has never until now started developing any consistent rules and regulations to govern legal expense funds for the executive branch,\u201d Holman said. \u201cSo if you go back and take a look at the few opinions they\u2019ve offered over the course of the last several decades, you\u2019ll find them completely contradictory and inconsistent.\u201d\n\nThe term for free legal services, \u201cpro bono,\u201d is a shortening of the latin phrase pro bono publico, for the public good, and therefore not taking a fee.\n\nGiuliani declined to answer follow-up questions about his legal work for Trump, but Sekulow, who is paid, said he didn\u2019t see anything wrong with that arrangement. \u201cPro bono is exactly that. It\u2019s pro bono,\u201d he said.\n\nSekulow declined to discuss any specifics regarding his payment as part of Trump\u2019s legal team, including the amount or source of payments. \u201cI don\u2019t discuss my fees situation,\u201d he said. \u201c... I don\u2019t discuss ever what the fee arrangements are, but I\u2019ve been compensated.\u201d\n\nWhile Sekulow wouldn\u2019t discuss details, he insisted that there wasn\u2019t anything improper being done. \u201cI can\u2019t discuss how we\u2019re being paid, but it\u2019s obviously appropriate,\u201d Sekulow said.\n\nHowever, other leading lawyers and legal experts who spoke to Yahoo News believe there are problems posed by Trump receiving free legal services from Giuliani.\n\nCharles Fried, a Harvard Law professor who served as solicitor general under President Ronald Reagan and serves on the board of the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, said it would be \u201cobviously problematic\u201d for Trump to have a member of his legal team working pro bono.\n\n\u201cHe is ... receiving hundreds of hours of legal services, which, you know, people like Giuliani charge a thousand dollars an hour. [Trump is] getting that for free,\u201d Fried said.\n\nUntil the OGE issues new rulings, the issue of presidential legal representation will likely remain sparsely regulated, in part because there is limited precedent for a president needing extensive personal legal services. In the 1990s, when Clinton\u2019s lawyers went to the OGE, the president\u2019s use of a team of personal attorneys for a major case was largely uncharted legal territory in the landscape of new regulations enacted after the Watergate scandal.\n\nIn Clinton\u2019s case, ultimately, the OGE advised his attorneys on how to set up an independent trust that would raise money to pay his lawyers \u2014 referred to interchangeably by ethics experts as a \u201clegal defense fund\u201d or a \u201clegal expense fund.\u201d\n\nIn late 2018, the office began a rule-making process to provide a broader framework for executive branch officials\u2019 legal expenses. Holman expects that the OGE\u2019s rule-making process will go beyond creating rules for legal expense funds to cover parallel subjects like the free legal services Giuliani provides to Trump. \u201cIt will address all the issues related to legal services for public officeholders, including pro bono and crowdsourcing,\u201d he told Yahoo News.\n\nScott Amey, general counsel of the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan watchdog group, also said the OGE had been too slow to act. Amey said new guidelines could come from the rule-making process, but in the meantime, officials should proceed cautiously.\n\n\u201cLegal defense funds and pro bono legal services offered to any government employee, including the president, raise a host of conflict of interest and ethics questions that require answers,\u201d Amey said. \u201cThe Office of Government Ethics is seeking advice and might have a rule or guidance in 2020, but government ethics officials are facing this problem now, and any decisions about receiving money or services should be handled with the public interest in mind.\u201d\n\nThe OGE declined to comment. Two other personal attorneys who worked for Trump during the special counsel investigation, John Dowd and Emmett Flood, also declined to comment. William Consovoy, who represented Trump before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and recently argued that the president would have immunity from criminal investigation or prosecution even if he shot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nEven if the OGE comes up with a set of new rules covering the president, it\u2019s unclear what impact that would have on Trump. Typically, the OGE makes recommendations to the executive branch or, in criminal cases, referrals to the Department of Justice, but rules from the office are nonbinding, and it is up to the other federal agencies whether to follow the OGE\u2019s guidance.\n\nThe Trump administration has previously run afoul of federal ethics watchdogs and ignored their recommendations. In February 2017, the office recommended that the White House consider taking disciplinary action against Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to the president, after she gave an apparent endorsement of the private business of Ivanka Trump, the daughter of and an adviser to the president, in potential violation of the Hatch Act. A White House lawyer responded by brushing off the issue.\n\nWhite House adviser Kellyanne Conway.

I don\u2019t get near that,\u201d Sekulow said of the ethics office.\n\nWhite House counsel Pat Cipollone did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nEven though Trump would not necessarily have to abide by any future OGE rules on legal counsel, there are laws that govern his conduct. The president is exempt from much of the regulation that bars other executive branch officials from taking gifts worth over $20; however, the president is subject to bribery laws and is prohibited from taking gifts \u201cin return for being influenced in the performance of an official act.\u201d\n\nTony Essaye, a retired attorney who was the executive director of one of Clinton\u2019s legal defense funds, said pro bono work would raise \u201ca lot of issues and questions ... as to where people are giving free services to the president they get a certain degree of influence.\u201d\n\nEssaye offered a broad example: \u201cIf you\u2019re doing a lot of work for me free, if you come to me and say, \u2018Look, I\u2019ve got a friend who I would like you to do this for, or that for,\u2019 I\u2019m more inclined to be willing to do that because I appreciate what you\u2019ve done for me.\u201d\n\nBased on past cases, Paul Light, a New York University professor of public service and former director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, predicted regulators would eventually determine that Trump should be charged market rate for legal services.\n\n\u201cThe history of this is that a fair market value is determined not by the president, not by the White House, not by presidential counsel of any kind, it\u2019s to be determined by the federal government,\u201d Light said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t Donald Trump\u2019s call. This will be eventually the call of a federal bureaucrat.\u201d\n\nLight said Trump\u2019s legal team should be keeping meticulous records and tracking their billable hours. \u201cTo be on the safe side, one would urge any president, not just Trump ... to register the pro bono gift of legal services for future review,\u201d he said.\n\nSekulow would not comment on how his team is tracking and charging for their work. \u201cI\u2019m not going to discuss our billing, but we send bills and get paid,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ll say.\u201d\n\nThe opacity surrounding Trump\u2019s legal defense, which doesn\u2019t include a fund, is very different from how it was handled with Clinton.\n\nBack in 1994, to address the OGE\u2019s concerns about the appearance of undue influence, the Clintons\u2019 legal team determined their legal defense fund would have a number of voluntary safeguards. It would have a $1,000 individual contribution limit and semiannual reports disclosing its donors, and it would be forbidden from advertising or soliciting donations and from accepting money from political action committees, corporations, lobbying groups, professional associations or labor unions.\n\nUltimately, there were two trust funds established for the Clintons\u2019 legal defense \u2014 and they provided a dramatic example of how the president\u2019s legal expenses could be an attractive target for outside interests seeking to gain influence with the White House.\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Bill Clinton denies improper behavior with White House intern Monica Lewinsky as first lady Hillary Clinton looks on, January 1998.

Daily News via Getty Images) More\n\nBill and Hillary Clinton established the first fund in 1994 as the president faced legal issues, including a sexual harassment suit from Paula Jones. The fund ran into trouble when Ya Lin \u201cCharlie\u201d Trie, a restaurateur from Clinton\u2019s home state, delivered a manila envelope full of hundreds of thousands of dollars in money orders. Some of the money was linked back to a Taiwan-based organization that had chapters in the United States.\n\nAfter a series of meetings at the White House, the donations were returned. Trie was later indicted in connection with other suspicious donations to the Democratic National Committee and pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations.\n\nBy 1998, as the Monica Lewinsky scandal loomed, donations were no longer coming into Clinton\u2019s original legal defense fund as a result, in part, of what a CNN report termed \u201cthe embarrassment\u201d that lingered after the Trie episode. Clinton\u2019s supporters established a second fund that relaxed some of the strictures, increased the contribution limit tenfold, and permitted advertising and solicitations for donations.\n\nEssaye, who was appointed to run that second fund, said the OGE also stipulated that the Clintons\u2019 defense trust should not have the Clintons serve as its grantors, as they had with the first fund, since they were also the trust\u2019s beneficiaries. This time around, the fund had independent leadership, and specific rules were put in place to make it independent of the Clintons\u2019 control.\n\n\u201cThe money would not go to the Clintons. It would go directly to the law firms, and that\u2019s essentially what occurred,\u201d Essaye explained.\n\nBy contrast, Trump\u2019s arrangement with Giuliani and Sekulow, which doesn\u2019t involve a legal defense fund, lacks these conflict of interest safeguards and offers no transparency.\n\n\u201cTrump just ignores all that stuff, I suppose,\u201d Essaye said.\n\nNeil Eggleston, who served as President Barack Obama\u2019s White House counsel from 2014 to 2017, said Republicans \u201cwould have gone crazy and insisted on investigations and subpoenas\u201d if Obama employed a personal legal team with undisclosed income sources, foreign ties and pro bono work.\n\nHowever, he suggested the Trump administration is \u201cjust a different presidency\u201d in how it addresses ethical and legal concerns, pointing out how White House officials pushed aside the OGE\u2019s concerns about Kellyanne Conway.\n\n\u201cThese kind of issues, they just don\u2019t really pay much attention to,\u201d Eggleston said of the Trump White House. \u201cIt\u2019d be weird if they were cutting square corners on this when they don\u2019t cut square corners on anything else.\u201d\n\nBut the questions surrounding potential conflicts of interest could prove troublesome for Trump\u2019s legal team, particularly for Giuliani, whose sources of outside income have attracted the attention of law enforcement agencies.\n\nGiuliani has been linked to work in more than a dozen foreign countries through his former law firm, other legal work and his security consultancy. Two of his business associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, were arrested on Oct. 9 and charged with illegally trying to direct foreign funds to American political campaigns. Federal prosecutors are reportedly investigating Giuliani\u2019s relationship with the two men.\n\nRudy Giuliani with Ukrainian-American businessman Lev Parnas. (Photo: Aram Roston/Reuters) More\n\nA lawyer for Parnas reportedly argued in Manhattan federal court on Oct. 23 that some of the evidence supporting the campaign finance charges against Parnas may be protected by executive privilege due to Giuliani\u2019s simultaneous representation of Parnas and Trump. That unusual argument ties the criminal case directly to the White House.\n\nFried, Reagan\u2019s former solicitor general, described the mix of Giuliani\u2019s foreign ties and pro bono work for Trump as troubling. \u201cHe\u2019s not allowed to take money from a foreign government,\u201d Fried said of Trump. \u201cHe is, however, receiving hundreds of hours of legal services \u2026 for free, and Giuliani is able to do that, in part, because he\u2019s making money representing foreigners. Why don\u2019t you work it out?\u201d\n\nWhile Giuliani has attracted the most attention because of his pivotal role in the impeachment inquiry, the president\u2019s other top lawyer, Sekulow, also has income sources that have come under scrutiny.\n\nIn addition to his work for Trump, Sekulow has a private law firm, and he and his family also operate \u2014 and receive substantial income from \u2014 a network of nonprofit charitable organizations that describe themselves as dedicated to religious advocacy. In the past two years, as Sekulow served as Trump\u2019s attorney, he has shifted parts of his empire of nonprofits to focus on pro-Trump legal work.\n\nYahoo News reviewed four years of tax filings that showed that his main nonprofit fundraising entity, legally named Christian Advocates Serving Evangelism, took in over $216 million in aggregate revenue from 2015 to 2018. This money is largely from contributions, and while some of it flows through visible tributaries like professional fundraising vendors, other funds come from unknown sources into the charity\u2019s coffers with no transparency of any kind. Nonprofits are not required to disclose individual donors, and it is unclear who is funding Sekulow\u2019s various organizations.\n\nThe best-known charity associated with Sekulow is ACLJ, the American Center for Law and Justice, described as a law firm dedicated to protecting \u201creligious and constitutional freedom.\u201d ACLJ was founded in the 1990s by televangelist Pat Robertson and began its existence championing Christian conservative causes such as school prayer and opposition to abortion. During the Obama administration, the group began to pursue cases aligned with the Republican agenda, such as mounting legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act.\n\nACLJ sends funds to partner organizations around the world, but Sekulow at first said it doesn\u2019t \u201cget foreign money,\u201d then offered a clarification.\n\n\u201cNow, I say we don\u2019t accept foreign money. I couldn\u2019t tell you every donor,\u201d Sekulow said. \u201cYou know, we have hundreds of thousands of donors. But I don\u2019t recall a situation where we\u2019ve ever had what I would call a foreign donor. We don\u2019t take government donations.\u201d\n\nRecently, Sekulow\u2019s charitable organizations have taken on an increasingly pro-Trump bent. An analysis of ACLJ-National\u2019s filings in federal district and circuit courts shows that, since the president was elected in 2016, 16 of the 31 cases the group has become involved in, either as a party or through friend of the court briefs, appear to be directly tied to either defending Trump\u2019s policies, pursuing investigations that would be useful to his legal defense or simply to antagonizing his political opponents.\n\nJay Sekulow (Photo: Shahar Azran/Shutterstock) More\n\nACLJ\u2019s most recent federal case is a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit that seeks records of former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s communications with a person who was purportedly Comey\u2019s confidential informant in the White House. ACLJ has also filed FOIA requests aimed at exposing Obama officials\u2019 purported \u201cunmasking\u201d of the identities of Trump allies in connection with the Russia investigation and records related to Uranium One, a company that directed money to the Clinton Foundation amid a Russian takeover. The organization\u2019s digital and radio platforms also regularly tout the work of Trump\u2019s legal team and attack the impeachment inquiry.\n\nOn his daily radio broadcasts, Sekulow is fond of saying that he switches between \u201cwearing my ACLJ hat or my lawyer for the president hat.\u201d But even he said the ACLJ\u2019s work has overlapped with some cases involving Trump because of the organization\u2019s focus on \u201cconstitutional issues.\u201d\n\nThose charitable groups, which pay substantial sums to Sekulow and firms he owns, and whose donors are not identified, have also engaged in what appears to be pro-Trump advocacy.\n\nLloyd Mayer, a professor of law at Notre Dame, said this mixing of nonprofit and business also could be problematic from the standpoint of tax law. \u201cIf he is using the charity to benefit his private legal practice,\u201d he said, \u201cthat would raise issues of private benefit,\u201d among other concerns.\n\nIn other words, a tax-exempt charity like the ACLJ might not be permitted to support legal work that benefits a client \u2014 like Trump \u2014 whom Sekulow represents in his private practice.\n\nHowever, Sekulow said the ACLJ is \u201cvery specific about ... making sure that the work of the ACLJ fits within the parameters\u201d of its mission.\n\n\u201cEverything is done according to the rules and regulations with the Internal Revenue Service, and we\u2019re meticulous in our accounting,\u201d he said of the ACLJ.\n\nPhillip Hackney, a professor at the University of Pittsburgh\u2019s law school who focuses on tax law for charities, argued that IRS enforcement would ultimately be unlikely. Like many of the other aspects of Trump\u2019s legal team, he said, the involvement of ACLJ in funding Sekulow and engaging in legal advocacy for the president falls into a \u201cgray space\u201d between providing a benefit to a private party and \u201clitigating out important ideas\u201d that \u201cotherwise normally wouldn\u2019t have an opportunity to present themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard for the IRS to do anything about it,\u201d Hackney said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of hard for the IRS to make those distinctions in any way in which it does not come out itself seeming biased.\u201d\n\nWith the IRS unlikely to act, it may ultimately be up to the OGE to determine what rules, if any, apply to Trump and his unusual arrangement for legal services. And nothing is likely to happen on that front before the impeachment inquiry and possible trial take place this year.\n\nWhile the OGE is \u201ctaking it seriously now, they are not going to come up with anything until 2020 and probably after the election,\u201d says Holman of Public Citizen.\n\n\u201cWe are going to go into the 2020 election cycle with no rules governing how legal expense funds are handled or whether a lawyer can offer gifts of legal services or not,\u201d he continued. \u201cLiterally, no rules, and worse yet, no transparency.\u201d\n\n_____\n\nDownload the Yahoo News app to customize your experience.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:", "description": "Until now, Trump\u2019s legal arrangements have been in a gray area of regulation.
