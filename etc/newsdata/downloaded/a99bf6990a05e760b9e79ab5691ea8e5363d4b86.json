Immediately below is a status light with Status 2 and Status 1. Finally, the top left of the device says 'Prototype 1 Not for Sale\u2019.\u201d\n\nWhile Sony is yet to confirm any features for the PlayStation 5, it has finally confirmed the name, as well as a Holiday 2020 launch date.\n\n(Image: Playstation)\n\nIn a blog about the news, Jim Ryan , President and CEO of SIE, said: \u201cSince we originally unveiled our next-generation console in April, we know that there\u2019s been a lot of excitement and interest in hearing more about what the future of games will bring.\n\n\u201cToday I\u2019m proud to share that our next-generation console will be called PlayStation 5, and we\u2019ll be launching in time for Holiday 2020.\u201d\n\nIn the blog, Mr Ryan also revealed some of the key innovations to expect in the PlayStation 5 controller.\n\nThe first innovation is haptic feedback, which will replace the \u2018rumble\u2019 technology in current controllers.\n\nVideo Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now\n\nMr Ryan explained: \u201cWith haptics, you truly feel a broader range of feedback, so crashing into a wall in a race car feels much different than making a tackle on the football field.\n\n\u201cYou can even get a sense for a variety of textures when running through fields of grass or plodding through mud.\u201d\n\nSecondly, Sony is including \u2018adaptive triggers\u2019 in the controller\u2019s trigger buttons.\n\nMr Ryan added: \u201cDevelopers can program the resistance of the triggers so that you feel the tactile sensation of drawing a bow and arrow or accelerating an off-road vehicle through rocky terrain.\n\n\u201cIn combination with the haptics, this can produce a powerful experience that better simulates various actions.\u201d", "description": "The images indicate that the console will have a V-shaped design - a feature that has been heavily rumoured", "authors": ["Shivali Best", "Image", "Playstation"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20663895.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/0_Playstation-5.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-21"}
