On Brennan, \u201cit was always, \u2018he\u2019s an idiot, he\u2019s a crook, we ought to investigate him,\u2019\u201d this person said, characterizing Trump\u2019s outbursts.\n\nSince the beginning of his presidency, Trump has also repeatedly attacked Brennan publicly, tweeting about the former CIA director more than two dozen times. He\u2019s questioned Brennan\u2019s mental acuity and called him a liar, a leaker and blamed him for having \u201cdetailed knowledge of the (phony) Dossier,\u201d a reference to the raw intelligence reports on Trump\u2019s alleged Russia ties by British former MI-6 officer Christopher Steele. He also tried to unilaterally strip Brennan of his security clearance\u2014a process the White House reportedly never went through with \u2014 and urged the House to call him in for questioning.\n\nThe emerging focus of the Barr-Durham investigation \u2014 the CIA and intelligence community\u2019s work with the FBI on the Russia probe \u2014 emphasizes the increasingly blurred lines between politics and law enforcement in the Trump era. In May, Trump gave Barr unprecedented authority to review the intelligence community\u2019s \u201csurveillance activities\u201d during the 2016 election, issuing a sweeping declassification order that granted Barr \u201cunprecedented\u201d powers over the nation\u2019s secrets, former officials said.\n\nIt was a break with protocol that Trump\u2019s allies see as a necessary check on the so-called \u201cdeep state\u201d but that critics have lambasted as an attempt to create the impression of scandal\u2014especially given Barr\u2019s comments earlier this year hinting at a predisposed belief that inappropriate \u201cspying\u201d occurred in 2016 and that the Steele dossier may have been Russian disinformation.\n\nBarr\u2019s evidently close involvement with the Durham probe is in keeping with his reputation as a micromanager\u2014and a fierce advocate of presidential prerogatives. As attorney general during the George H.W. Bush administration, he described later for an oral history interview, he comes across as a seasoned, bare-knuckled bureaucratic brawler who closely coordinated his actions with the White House counsel\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cHe was very competent and very detail-oriented,\u201d said Bill Kristol, who was chief of staff to Vice President Dan Quayle and worked with Barr back then. Barr was \u201ca very involved manager\u201d of his department, Kristol said.\n\nDurham\u2019s report is likely to land well after the results of an inquiry by the Justice Department\u2019s Inspector General, who is examining the FBI\u2019s applications to a secret court in 2016 and 2017 to obtain surveillance warrants on a Trump campaign aide. Trump-friendly commentators have been raising expectations about the IG report, predicting that it will show the FBI purposefully misled the court to surveil Trump\u2019s campaign, and have expressed frustration in recent days over its delayed release.\n\nBut former FBI officials on the receiving end of that probe say the president\u2019s allies are setting themselves up for disappointment.\n\n\u201cIs the IG report going to say we made mistakes? Yes,\u201d said one of the former officials. \u201cBut it won\u2019t say we did so for some nefarious purpose. So the report will be a dry hole for Trump and his supporters. Which is why [Barr and Durham] have now gone to this other theory, positing that the CIA was engaged in some rogue operation to overthrow Trump and therefore feeding the FBI bullshit,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s complete nonsense.\u201d", "description": "President Donald Trump\u2019s obsession with former CIA director John Brennan could be on a collision course with an ongoing Justice Department probe as Attorney General Bill Barr takes a more hands-on approach to examining the intelligence community\u2019s actions in 2016.
