Embrace it. Win two of three games over the Astros in a weekend set at Nationals Park, and the Nats would be . . .\n\nAD\n\nAll right, all right. Walk it back a bit. If going 1-0 today \u2014 Manager Dave Martinez\u2019s unrelenting mantra \u2014 means ignoring the possibilities ahead, then at least, with Thursday\u2019s day off, consider the hows and whys of the Nats\u2019 arrival at a place where (admit it) we\u2019re all wondering if a return to Texas will even be necessary.\n\nAD\n\nThe roots of it all were established back in the season, both by happenstance and with purpose. But they have sprouted here, over two games in which the better, more meaningful at-bats have been delivered by the Nationals, not the we\u2019ve-broken-the-code-of-baseball Astros. In those two games \u2014 victories by Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg over Gerrit Cole and Justin Verlander \u2014 the gutsiest pitches and the better defense was turned in by Washington.\n\nSum it up this way: The Nats have risen. The Astros have shriveled.\n\nAD\n\nTake two instances from Wednesday: Tie game, bottom of the sixth, two outs, Astros on first and second, Strasburg on fumes, pinch hitter Kyle Tucker at the plate. The Astros are masters at spitting on a pitcher\u2019s best pitch, at fouling off others and forcing you to give in. On a 3-2 count with the runners on the move, Strasburg had 113 behind him \u2014 and a brilliant one ahead. The, um, backbone it takes to execute the curveball that struck Tucker out can\u2019t be overstated. It might be the pitch of Strasburg\u2019s career.\n\nAD\n\nAnd it set up the seventh. Forget what the Nationals did right \u2014 led by catcher Kurt Suzuki\u2019s mammoth, tiebreaking homer off Verlander \u2014 and consider what the Astros did wrong. Verlander walked the next hitter, Victor Robles, his last. Reliever Ryan Pressly walked his first batter and later uncorked a wild pitch. Cap it off by Alex Bregman \u2014 the presumed American League MVP who is all but melting down here \u2014 throwing away a ball to third, and the anatomy of the Nats\u2019 decisive six-run inning was rooted as much in Houston\u2019s knees absolutely buckling as it was in anything the Nats did right.\n\nWhich fits how the Nats got here, by playing with house money for the past five months. Whatever the end result of this series and this season end up being, the story will begin, in a way, on May 23 with that mark that is now seared on the brain of every Nationals fan: 19-31. They reached that bottom and began the trudge back, and a looseness developed. Whether it was related directly to the poor start or not, it\u2019s undeniable. Hey, no one expects anything of us now, so what the bleep?\n\nAD\n\nTo their credit, the Nationals have largely dismissed the \u201cno one believed in us\u201d tripe sometimes embraced by teams that were written off. Rather, they have wrapped themselves more in \u201cwe believed in ourselves,\u201d which of course matters more anyway.\n\nAD\n\nSo it\u2019s worth reminding yourself, as the lining of your stomach gradually deteriorates over the course of these games, the unlikelihood that they\u2019re here at all. Not just with the 2-0 lead. But in the World Series.\n\nThe freedom with which they played led them to 93 wins in the regular season when that number appeared unrealistic. That run included eight straight wins to close the regular season, which means they were on a full-on 17-2 sprint into Wednesday night\u2019s game, which is an unprecedented stretch for this franchise since baseball returned to Washington 14 years ago. Now it\u2019s 18-2. What\u2019s the difference?\n\nAD\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve kind of been playing games like this for four months or whatever,\u201d said first baseman Ryan Zimmerman, a version of a line that has ping-ponged around the Nats\u2019 clubhouse since the calendar flipped to October.\n\nAD\n\nPressure is what you make of it, of course, and different characters react in vastly different ways. But it\u2019s undeniable the Los Angeles Dodgers, winners of the previous two National League pennants, had more of it on them than the Nats in the division series between the two. Did that decide the outcome? Not likely. Were the Nats freed up because of it? I\u2019d say so.\n\nNow here come the Astros, World Series champions in 2017, ALCS participants in 2018, characters for whom no consolation prize will do.\n\nAD\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in alleviating the pressure,\u201d Houston Manager A.J. Hinch said before Game 2. \u201cYou have to know it\u2019s there. It\u2019s going to be there regardless. You can\u2019t fake it. You can\u2019t pretend it. You embrace it. You deal with it. You have to be comfortable with it.\n\n\u201cSo rather than try to pretend like it doesn\u2019t exist, you have to figure out a way to use it to your advantage and use it as motivation.\u201d\n\nAD\n\nWithin all that are some great notions, and Hinch would seem adept at delivering that message, in bits and pieces, to his charges. But you know what? Martinez doesn\u2019t even have to bother. Go 1-0 today? That was true May 24. It was true Oct. 23.\n\nAD\n\nThere are, as we enter the final week of the season, new wrinkles for the Nats, too. Since he endured chest pains in the dugout and ended up in an ambulance to the hospital on Sept. 15, Martinez has been prevented from ingesting caffeine. He used to be hyper. Now, how can he help but be calm?\n\n\u201cThe guys in the dugout always come up to me and they put their hand on my heart to see what\u2019s wrong,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cAnd I have to tell them all the time, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m fine.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhich is how the Nationals are right now. Just fine. More than fine. Washington\u2019s last World Series title, in 1924, is preserved on grainy black-and-white film. Close your eyes and envision the HD version this team is filming. Enjoy the weekend.
