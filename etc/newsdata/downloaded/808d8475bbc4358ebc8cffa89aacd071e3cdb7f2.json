(AP) - The Broncos haven\u2019t been the same since linebacker Danny Trevathan bolted to the Bears following Denver\u2019s Super Bowl parade 3\u00bd years ago.\n\nThey\u2019re 20-29 since then, including a loss at Oakland in their opener last week under Vic Fangio, their third head coach in that span.\n\nThe Bears?\n\nThey\u2019ve gone 20-30 during Trevathan\u2019s time in Chicago, including 8-24 in two seasons under former Broncos coach John Fox and last year\u2019s 12-5 mark under Matt Nagy that snapped an eight-year playoff drought but ended with a deflating playoff loss at home to the Eagles.\n\nAfter that game, the Bears also lost Fangio, their highly respected defensive mastermind, to the Broncos, who gave him his first head coaching job.\n\nFangio said he loved coaching Trevathan, and Trevathan said he loved playing for Fangio.\n\n\u201cThe good thing about it is that there is always something that you can learn. He\u2019s definitely one I learned from,\u201d Trevathan said.\n\nTrevathan returns to Denver on Sunday when the Bears (0-1) visit the Broncos (1-0) for Fangio\u2019s home debut, and linebacker Todd Davis , who became the starter when Trevathan left, is hoping to play after returning from a torn calf that sidelined him for eight weeks.\n\nDavis said he learned a lot from Trevathan and would love to show him firsthand.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s always a guy that\u2019s going to finish every play. He\u2019s a tough, nasty player and that\u2019s what I love about him and I tried to bring that with me when he left because I definitely like what he brought to the game,\u201d Davis said.\n\nDavis fondly recalls how Trevathan lost two molars in a game against the Chargers, accidentally swallowing one and spitting out the other after he\u2019d forgotten to put in his mouth guard.\n\n\u201cIt just shows how tough he is,\u201d Davis said. \u201cI love him and I love the way he plays.\u201d\n\nVon Miller said Davis plays the same way, calling him \u201cour big-hit guy, our big playmaker guy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, he\u2019s a thug. He\u2019s our thug,\u201d Miller said. \u201cEvery team has got to have one and Todd is ours. It\u2019ll be great to have Todd back in the defense.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019ll be great to see Trevathan back in Denver, Davis said.\n\n\u201cIt was tough to see him leave because he was such a huge piece of this defense, helped us win a Super Bowl,\u201d Davis said. \u201cBut also it was my opportunity to shine so I feel like I took advantage of it and now I\u2019m here and we get to play each other, so it\u2019ll be fun.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\n\n___\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.", "description": "The Broncos haven't been the same since linebacker Danny Trevathan bolted to the Bears following Denver's Super Bowl parade 3\u00bd years ago.", "authors": ["The Washington Times Http", "Arnie Stapleton"], "top_image": "https://twt-thumbs.washtimes.com/media/image/2019/09/12/bears_broncos_preview_football_58596_c0-136-3500-2176_s1770x1032.jpg?40b390fe166cae563aef92821e83bf13d1eb940b", "published_at": "2019-09-12"}
