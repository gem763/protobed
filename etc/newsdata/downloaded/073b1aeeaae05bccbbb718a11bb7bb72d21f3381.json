What\u2019s new is how he is succeeding in corrupting our government.", "language": "en", "text": "A normal government that cared about corruption in Ukraine, as officials in this administration sometimes pretend they do, would seek improvements in its judicial system. But Trump has no such concern, as you can tell from his July 25 phone call with Ukraine\u2019s president. He never mentions corruption, but presses only for two specific investigations he hopes will benefit his domestic political fortunes.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nA government committed to rescuing Americans from unfair detention abroad \u2014 as Trump likes to boast he is \u2014 would be committed to rescuing all Americans from unfair detention abroad.\n\nBut this administration picks and chooses, based on Trump\u2019s whims and grudges. For a Christian cleric held in Turkey, Trump goes all out. For a New York Times reporter endangered in Egypt, the administration does not bestir itself, as Times publisher A.G. Sulzberger recently recounted.\n\nSome officials have indulged these impulses almost from the start. That Times reporter barely escaped arrest two years ago. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross\u2019s dishonest maneuverings to get a question about citizenship added to the 2020 Census took place in the spring of 2017. Last year, officials devised their policy to separate children from parents at the border, and then repeatedly lied about it.\n\nAD\n\nAD\n\nBut as time goes on, the government more and more is endorsing and amplifying policies that serve Trump\u2019s political interest. Just recently:\n\n\u25cfAs soon as Trump decided to make political hay out of California\u2019s homeless population, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler accused the (Democratic) state of allowing human feces to pollute its waterways and demanded action. Around the country, 3,508 community water systems are out of compliance with standards; only California attracted the EPA\u2019s attention.\n\n\u25cfWhen the House Ways and Means Committee requested Trump\u2019s tax returns, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Charles Rettig flatly refused \u2014 though the law says the returns \u201cshall\u201d be turned over if requested.\n\nAD\n\n\u25cfWhen another House committee wanted former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski to testify about Trump\u2019s efforts to fire special investigator Robert S. Mueller III, White House counsel Pat Cipollone \u2014 who is supposed to represent the law, not the president\u2019s personal well-being \u2014 happily asserted executive privilege on behalf of this tale of obstruction, though Lewandowski never actually worked in the White House.\n\nAD\n\n\u25cfIndulging another Trump obsession, the State Department has intensified an investigation of Obama-era officials who sent emails to Hillary Clinton \u2014 including by retroactively classifying some of their messages, as The Post reported a few days ago.\n\n\u25cfWhen the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general ruled that the whistleblower complaint about Trump and Ukraine should be sent to Congress, the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel conveniently offered a contrary opinion. No, the OLC said, \u201cthe appropriate action is to refer the matter to the Department of Justice.\u201d\n\nAD\n\n\u25cfWhich was doubly convenient, in fact, because Justice, with great efficiency, determined that \u2014 although soliciting assistance from a foreign power on behalf of a political campaign is against the law \u2014 Trump had nothing to worry about, on the pretext that prosecutors were unable to assign a dollar value to the help he had solicited. Case closed. Case never even opened, in fact.\n\nAD\n\nWhat\u2019s going on? Senior officials who had the fortitude to defend the rule of law have gradually been replaced by those who put ambition over principle. A few who still try to do the right thing are kept in vulnerable \u201cacting\u201d positions and hemmed in by toadies and hacks in subordinate positions.\n\nMeanwhile, honest civil servants leave or become demoralized. They watch first-class research agencies be deliberately disrupted and degraded. They see Trump firing (Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch) and threatening (the still anonymous whistleblower) honest professionals. Resistance to abuse of power naturally dwindles.\n\nAD\n\nYes, take this as a warning of what a second term would mean. Norms get eroded, a nonpartisan bureaucracy can be corrupted.\n\nBut remember also that the whistleblower and intelligence inspector general refused to bend. Thousands of public servants like them are continuing to fulfill their missions as best they can. We need to keep faith with them as they work, often under pressures we can\u2019t imagine, to keep government fair and honest.\n\nAD\n\nRead more from Fred Hiatt\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.\n\nRead more:\n\nPaul Waldman: Even Trump\u2019s own aides know how corrupt he is\n\nDana Milbank: It was never about \u2018America First.\u2019 It\u2019s always been Trump first.\n\nMegan McArdle: One day, the Trump superpower of his shameless self-regard may fail him\n\nThe Post\u2019s View: Trump\u2019s corruption is black and white\n\nGreg Sargent: Trump\u2019s corruption is getting worse.
