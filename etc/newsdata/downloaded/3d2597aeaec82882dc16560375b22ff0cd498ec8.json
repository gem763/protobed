Interim coach Bill Callahan said Monday the 35-year-old has been \u201cworking diligently\u201d on his rehab.\n\nSmith has been throwing \u201cfor some time now,\u201d Callahan said. On Monday, he was spotted working with coaches on the team\u2019s practice field. He was also seen in the locker room, wearing a long, black brace on his right leg.\n\nThe quarterback suffered a compound fracture last November against the Houston Texans, requiring 17 surgeries due to infections.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like it, I really haven\u2019t,\u201d Callahan said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like the effort he\u2019s pouring into his rehab. It\u2019s so impressive, and for him to be going out there in the stages he\u2019s gone through, he\u2019s got the ultimate respect from all of us.\n\n\u201cI think as a competitor, wanting to get back out on the field again and wanting to play again after what he\u2019s gone through, the trauma he\u2019s gone through, that just speak volumes for his passion and for his will.\u201d\n\nIn July, Smith was placed on the team\u2019s physically unable to perform list. He will not play this year as he did not get his external fixator \u2014 a medical device used to stabilize the leg \u2014 removed until mid-July.\n\nSmith has not addressed local media since the injury, but has told a few reporters he plans on playing again.\n\nWithout Smith, the Redskins have struggled to find stability at quarterback. They\u2019ve cycled through five signal-callers since his injury and drafted rookie Dwayne Haskins to be his replacement. The coaching staff, though, views Haskins as not ready for game action. Case Keenum will start again Thursday against the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nSmith, who signed a four-year, $94 million extension when traded to the Redskins in 2018, carries a $20.4 million cap hit for 2019 and a $21.4 million hit for 2020.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a progression that he\u2019s built up,\u201d Callahan said of Smith\u2019s rehab. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t just come out there and started throwing 50-yard bombs, but it\u2019s been over time.\u201d\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
