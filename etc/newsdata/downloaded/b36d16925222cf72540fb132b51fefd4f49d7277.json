Ryan Tannehill has been informed he\u2019ll get the start Sunday against the #Chargers, sources tell me and @TomPelissero. Former No. 2 overall pick Marcus Mariota goes to the bench. \u2014 Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) October 16, 2019\n\nScroll to continue with content Ad\n\nMariota, who has been the unquestioned starter in Tennessee throughout nearly his entire career in the NFL, struggled early Sunday. He went 7-of-18 for 63 yards and threw two interceptions. Titans coach Mike Vrabel then made the switch in the second half to Tannehill. He wasn\u2019t great, either, but he performed better than Mariota.\n\nTannehill finished 13-of-16 for 144 yards with one interception, and led the Titans into the red zone on multiple occasions. Vrabel is ready to see what the 31-year-old can do with a full game.\n\n[Watch NFL games on your phone for FREE with the Yahoo Sports app]\n\nStory continues\n\nTannehill signed a one-year deal with the Titans this offseason to facilitate a trade, which sent the Miami Dolphins a pair of draft picks. He compiled a 42-46 record as a starter over six seasons in Miami, and hit more than 4,000 passing yards twice.\n\nThough he started the season as a backup, Tannehill still knows he can get the job done.\n\nThe Titans will reportedly start Ryan Tannehill on Sunday, sticking with the quarterback after benching Marcus Mariotta in the second half last week. (Matthew Stockman/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cI have a ton of confidence in myself,\u201d Tannehill said, via ESPN. \u201cYou have to, to play this position. I believe in myself a whole lot.\u201d\n\nWhile he has had a few big games, Mariota has struggled in Tennessee this season \u2014 especially in his past two outings. He went 13-of-22 for 183 yards in the Titans\u2019 loss to the Buffalo Bills before the rough Denver loss, and was sacked five times. The former Oregon standout does have a playoff win under his belt in Tennessee, though has not led the Titans to a season better than 9-7.\n\nMariota is in the option year of his initial rookie contract, too. He sounded confident after the loss Sunday, but Tannehill is capable of holding down a starting job, given his history. If he can maintain that spot through the end of the season, Mariota could be one of two top quarterbacks from the 2015 draft searching for a new home this offseason.\n\n\u201cThings happen for a reason,\u201d Mariota said Sunday. \u201cI truly believe that. I can learn from this. I\u2019m going to grow from this and I\u2019ll become a better player.\u201d\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:", "description": "The Titans will reportedly start Ryan Tannehill on Sunday, sticking with the quarterback after benching Marcus Mariota in the second half last week.", "authors": ["Ryan Young"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/PygJvDTi9r9TIOUkIgkHtg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyODA7aD04NTMuMzMzMzMzMzMzMzMzNA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/6CyFVP4wOKsJz6bhUorE9g--~B/aD0yOTIwO3c9NDM4MDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-images/2019-10/8d0cdbe0-efb5-11e9-afdd-31dc03240e3d", "published_at": "2019-10-16"}
