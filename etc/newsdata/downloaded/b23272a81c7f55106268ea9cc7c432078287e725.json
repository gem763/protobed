It still leaves the Federal Reserve under pressure to cut interest rates and President Donald Trump facing challenges heading into next year\u2019s election.\n\nWhether the longest expansion in history remains intact may ultimately depend on whether consumers are able to maintain spending enough to offset the slump in manufacturing amid the U.S.-China trade war.\n\n\u201cSuddenly the idea of stall speed is much more important today than it has been for most of the expansion,\u201d said Stephen Gallagher, chief U.S. economist at Societe Generale (PA: ) SA. \u201cThe economy is running on one engine, and that\u2019s the consumer.\u201d\n\nAt Commerzbank AG (DE: ), currency strategist Ulrich Leuchtmann told clients in a report on Wednesday that \u201cthe fact that stall speed is becoming an issue of common interest\u201d may undermine demand for U.S. assets.\n\nTaking a page from aviation, in which the stall speed is the slowest a plane can fly while still maintaining a level flight, the economic equivalent is the point at which growth is no longer self-sustaining.\n\nConsumer Response\n\nThat happens when consumers and companies pull back in the face of the lackluster economic performance.\n\n\u201cWhen economic actors become sufficiently concerned -- whether justified or not -- a mild slowdown can easily become worse,\u201d Eric Lascelles, chief economist at RBC Global Asset Management Inc., wrote in a report last month.\n\nThe outlook for growth has indeed softened, with the manufacturing sector already slipping into a recession during the first half of the year, capital investment weakening and job gains moderating. Analysts expect growth in gross domestic product to slow to 1.7% next year.\n\nIn expansions dating back to the 1940s, real GDP growth below 2% was almost always followed by a recession, according to Lascelles. Now, he and other economists expect the economy can avoid buckling at that pace. A reduced stall speed means growth can be slower and monthly payroll gains can be softer and still sustain the expansion.\n\nGrowth Potential\n\nThe stall speed has largely declined because the potential growth rate of the economy has slowed.\n\nThe two concepts are closely tied. Potential growth is the pace at which the economy can expand without inflation heating up. Right now, the Fed sees potential growth at 1.9%. Predictions by the Congressional Budget Office for the rate have also come down over time. It\u2019s eased amid demographic changes like slower population growth and softer productivity gains.\n\n\u201cThe problem here is if potential growth is slowing, what constitutes a rapid expansion today is very different than what it looked like maybe 40 years ago,\u201d said Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Barclays (LON: ) Plc.\n\nAnd the expansion has been lackluster. Since the end of the recession in 2009, GDP has increased about half as much on a percentage basis as it did during the 1991-2001 expansion, the nation\u2019s second-longest. Wage growth has remained subdued and inflation has repeatedly missed the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\n\nWhat Our Economists Say\n\n\u201cWe expect stall speed for the economy to be in the vicinity of 1.4-1.5% real GDP growth (in year-on-year terms). Below that, household income creation slows to such a pace that consumers are unable to shoulder the growth burden.\u201d--Carl Riccadonna and Yelena Shulyatyeva, Bloomberg Economics\n\nMore Vulnerable\n\nMost economists predict the economy can stay above their self-defined stall speed level next year, but Joachim Fels and Andrew Balls of Pacific Investment Management Co. expect growth to slow to about 1% in the first half of 2020.\n\n\u201cWhile a recession is not our base case, it doesn\u2019t take much to tip over an economy that is moving along at stall speed,\u201d Fels and Balls wrote in the report last week.\n\nWhile a slower stall speed means the economy can expand at a more subdued pace without signaling imminent recession, the bad news is that it doesn\u2019t mean the U.S. is less exposed to a downturn.\n\nLower potential growth \u201ctells you that a shock that we may have experienced before the crisis which may not have tipped you into recession could certainly do so now,\u201d said Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank AG (DE: ).\n\nAs economic growth withers, fiscal and monetary stimulus, provided that they are employed in a timely fashion, can give the economy much-needed lift. But policy makers at the Fed and in Congress have less room to keep the nation from hitting stall speed -- or possibly accelerating out of it.\n\n\u201cIt raises the risk of the end of the economic cycle,\u201d Gapen said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done what we can do on the fiscal side. There\u2019s limited space for monetary policy to react.\u201d\n\n(Adds Commerzbank (DE: ) report in sixth paragraph.)", "description": "U.S. Slowdown Spurs Concern Economy Is Near Stalling", "authors": [], "top_image": "https://i-invdn-com.akamaized.net/content/pic4d119bade9a8e8a82ebc9a143fb724f5.jpg"}
