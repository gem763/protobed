It is going to be significantly higher than that.\n\n\"The public needs to prepare for unimaginable information\u2026 I have never lived through anything like this and I don\u2019t want to live through anything like this again.\u201d\n\nHis words came as the sheer devastation wrought by the category 5 storm started to emerge.\n\nThe UN estimates some 76,000 people are now in immediate danger of disease and starvation, while the Red Cross said some 45 per cent of homes in some areas had been either severely damaged or destroyed. Surveyors put the total cost of the catastrophe at $7 billion.\n\nAerial photos show miles of flattened and flooded communities across the Aboco Islands and Grand Bahama \u2013 both of which bore the brunt of Dorian\u2019s 185 mph winds. On the ground, local journalists reported that vast swathes of the islands were essentially uninhabitable with water and power supplies down and bodies piling up. Militias have been formed, local media said, to prevent widespread looting.\n\nAs aid workers poured into the country on Thursday and Friday, meanwhile, harrowing tales started to emerge from those who had been caught in the churning storm.\n\nOne man, Richard Johnson, told of how his six-year-old brother Adrian was missing after being whipped by the winds into churning flood waters. \u201cGiven the circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm not that hopeful.\"\n\nAnother survivor, Ramond King, said he could only watch as swirling gusts ripped the roof off his home \u2013 then took his neighbour's entire house away into the sky. \u201cThis can't be real, this can't be real,\" he said. \"Nothing is here, nothing at all. Everything is gone, just bodies.\"\n\nIn the waterside community of Mudd \u2013 now not much more than ruins \u2013 people were reported to be picking through the debris while avoiding a body hanging underneath a tree branch.\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t nobody come to get them,\u201d said Cardot Ked, who has lived in the area for 25 years.\n\nAn aerial view of damage from Hurricane Dorian in Marsh Harbour More\n\nAid supplies being delivered to the country now include eight tonnes of ready meals, storage units and generators, the UN World Food Programme said. Some \u00a34.3 million has been put aside by the agency to fund a three-month emergency operation there.\n\nNeighbouring Jamaica has said it will send 150 military personnel to secure lawless areas, while, in Barbados, prime minister Mia Mottley linked the devastation to climate change.\n\n\u201cWe are on the frontline of the consequences,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the vulnerability that attaches therefore to us is a matter we\u2019re trying to get the international community to deal with consistently.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cPeople say the words and hear you, but they don\u2019t follow through.\u201d\n\nBut as both rescue and reckoning started in the Caribbean, the hurricane has now started to strike the US.\n\nAlthough downgraded to a category 2 storm, it looks set to cause significant damage as it barrels up the country\u2019s north-east coast. Millions of people have been ordered to evacuate in North and South Carolina.", "description": "The death toll from Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas will be \"staggering\", the country\u2019s government has warned \u2013 as the storm now begins to batter the US east coast.The official body count in the Caribbean nation stood at 30 on Friday morning but, with thousands missing, it is expected to rise", "authors": ["Colin Drury"], "top_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/z2cNiAZigc2aIsxm_RBxhw--~B/aD0zNTE7dz01MjY7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/7a506c51a78294f093cbc90d8b40aea3", "published_at": "2019-09-06"}
