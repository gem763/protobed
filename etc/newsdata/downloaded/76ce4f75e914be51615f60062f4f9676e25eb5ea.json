The Nationals are expected to counter with right-hander Anibal Sanchez, who was 11-8, 3.85.\n\nSt. Louis is paced on offense by first baseman Paul Goldschmidt (34 homers, 97 RBIs in regular season), infielder Paul DeJong (30, 78) and outfielder Marcell Ozuna (29, 89).\n\nThe backup catcher is Matt Wieters, who played for the Nationals last season. Cardinals infielder Kolten Wong, who turns 29 Thursday, has four postseason homers.\n\nThe Cardinals won three of four games in Washington from April 29 to May 2 and then won two of three in St. Louis last month. Patrick Corbin got the only win in that series for the Nationals.\n\nWainwright won the last game of the second series for the Cardinals, beating Washington ace and St. Louis native Max Scherzer Sept. 18.\n\nSign up for Daily Newsletters Manage Newsletters\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.
