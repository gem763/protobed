It also grants the ranking Republican on the committee the authority to issue subpoenas \u2014 with the concurrence of the Democratic chair.\n\nThe move comes after Trump and congressional Republicans denounced the probe as \"illegitimate\" because Democrats launched the probe and began closed-door witness interviews without a full House vote.\n\nIn a letter to House Democrats on Monday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the move now was \"to eliminate any doubt as to whether the Trump Administration may withhold documents, prevent witness testimony, disregard duly authorized subpoenas, or continue obstructing the House of Representatives.\"\n\nThe House Rules Committee scheduled a Wednesday meeting to review the draft and set up a full House vote on it for Thursday.\n\nRead the text of the draft below.
