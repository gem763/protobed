They called us mass murderers, white supremacists, and terrorists. Let's send a clear message that they will never take our guns. pic.twitter.com/Joe0A0hfXY \u2014 NRA (@NRA) September 26, 2019\n\nThen for whatever reason, Shannon Watts decided to open her yap and jump into the fray (although she likely blocked the NRA after tweeting this):\n\nWhere the lie tho?@IlhanMN: \u201cWe\u2019re advocating to make sure people don\u2019t have access to commit mass murder; that\u2019s what you guys are advocating for.\u201d@AOC: \u201cCan you tell me about the assault weapons that killed Latinos that you all are contributing an environment of hate on?\u201d https://t.co/sZGUdh3GTx \u2014 Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) September 26, 2019\n\nShe\u2019s so awful\n\nAnd speaking of awful.\n\nHey @NRA, why don\u2019t you release my full, unedited interview? You know, the one where my first answer to your question was \u201cAren\u2019t y\u2019all broke?\u201d I think the public would like to see it in full. Releasing it is the right move \u2013 unless of course you think it\u2019ll make you look bad. https://t.co/kOXfkOERFF \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 26, 2019\n\nSpoken like a real elected official, right? Super eloquent and classy as ever.\n\nBut wait, it gets better.\n\nYo, @NRA \u2013 you seemed to have had a lot of time yesterday waiting outside my office and making videos about me. Yet you\u2018re suddenly so quiet & pressed about answering my question. Are you scared or just punking out? Release the raw video. https://t.co/kkbcsFVg9Z \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) September 26, 2019\n\nYO NRA.\n\nAre you just punking out?\n\nWe\u2019d be embarrassed for her but she clearly has zero shame so why bother.\n\nFull or edited video. Doesn\u2019t make any difference. You\u2019re out, along with your socialist buddies, to illegally confiscate firearms from law abiding citizens. If you can\u2019t govern without an unarmed citizenry, you\u2019re horrible at governing. \u2014 William Waring (@billwaring) September 26, 2019\n\nBut she\u2019s a great Twitter troll, right?\n\nSHAMEFUL: The Squad smears the NRA as \u2018mass murderers\u2019 and \u2018white supremacists\u2019https://t.co/PNNfSTHylf \u2014 Brad Polumbo (@brad_polumbo) September 26, 2019\n\nFrom the Washington Examiner:\n\nOmar, when pressed on her support for gun control, responded, \u201cWhat we are advocating for is that people don\u2019t have access to commit mass murder \u2026 which is what you guys are advocating for.\u201d This is all unhinged, despicable rhetoric. There\u2019s absolutely nothing to substantiate the insinuation that the NRA, whatever its faults may be, supports white supremacism or acts of violence in any way. The fact that they disagree with Democrats on complex matters of gun policy does not make the organization, or the millions of law-abiding Americans who belong to it, white supremacists \u2014 and any suggestion otherwise is a vicious smear. The NRA deserves credit, not condemnation, for protecting our right to self-defense rather than caving to emotional hysteria and the Left\u2019s baseless fearmongering about gun violence to try and restrict Second Amendment rights. But even if you disagree with them on all or most policy issues, the absolute least you must admit is that they\u2019re not racist or evil just because they dissent from Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s gun control agenda.\n\nBad stuff.\n\nHey, @AOC, why aren't you busy representing your district instead of playing stupid games on Twitter? You know, the job you're actually getting paid to do. I think the public would like to see their representatives actually doing their jobs. \u2014 Quantum Flux (@QuantumFlux1964) September 26, 2019\n\nElected official attacking a civil rights organization. pic.twitter.com/NuPIVp07uP \u2014 AirborneHeel (@abnheel) September 26, 2019\n\nMaybe spend less time attacking a civil rights organization that represents MILLIONS of law abiding citizens and more time picking better friends?

I will write a check today \u2014 Pweez No Block (@AnonTrader3) September 26, 2019\n\nThe NRA provided my initial gun safety courses 25 years ago when I purchased my first firearm. I eventually used that training to obtain my concealed carry license. I\u2019m a responsible gun owner, and I own many, including AR-15\u2019s.
