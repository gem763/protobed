She said she wasn\u2019t allowed to appeal what happened to her and now he can\u2019t either.\n\n\u201cThe fact that he tried to appeal his sentence, it just goes to show that he doesn\u2019t think he deserves the 18 years.\n\n\u201cI hope this gives him all the time to sit in his cell and think about how he destroyed our family.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a coward in every way. I hope he never sees the light of day again.\n\n\u201cHe has 18 years now to think about that.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t make eye contact with us, he just sat and looked at the judge.\n\n\u201cHopefully this is some closure for us and this is over for us that he can\u2019t try to get out anymore.\u201d\n\nCCTV footage tracked Cassidy\u2019s movements to and from where he dumped Ms Gates.\n\nThere was no footage of the incident but imagery showed a male dragging a person to the location where the victim was discovered 12 hours later.\n\nCassidy pleaded guilty in 2018 at the Central Criminal Court to rape and assault causing serious harm.\n\nHe had 34 previous convictions, including one for soliciting sex in the UK and two for assaults in this country.\n\nUpholding his sentence, Mr Justice Michael Peart said the events were \u201cso horrific\u201d, he would refrain from describing them in detail.\n\n(Image: AFP/Getty Images)\n\nCounsel for the DPP Vincent Heneghan told the court Cassidy had initially denied the offence and his \u201cattitude only changed when he was confronted with DNA evidence\u201d.\n\nHe said one could not get away from the \u201csheer savagery of the attack\u201d, which lasted approximately 30 minutes.\n\nCounsel for Cassidy Roderick O\u2019Hanlon submitted his client wasn\u2019t given enough credit for the mitigating factors.\n\nHe said his client co-operated with the Garda investigation, notwithstanding his \u201cinitial denial\u201d.\n\nThis was followed up with a plea of guilty which, it was accepted, was entered early.\n\nMr O\u2019Hanlon said it was accepted by the sentencing judge that Cassidy\u2019s actions since the offence \u201cindicated an attitude of remorse\u201d.\n\nHowever, Mr Justice Peart said the sentencing judge correctly held that the headline sentence of life\n\nimprisonment could be reduced to a finite sentence of 18 years, on account of Cassidy\u2019s guilty plea and remorse.\n\nMr Justice Peart said the Court of Appeal was unable to identify any error in the sentencing judge\u2019s approach.\n\nThe appeal was therefore dismissed.", "description": "The victim's daughter spoke out after Anthony Cassidy lost an appeal against the severity of his 18-year sentence", "authors": ["Ciara Phelan", "Image", "Afp Getty Images"], "top_image": "https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article17490875.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_laura-gates.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-09"}
