Merrill has two children, aged 1 and 2.\n\nHer husband Kevin Merrill, 54, was sentenced Oct. 10 to up to 22 years in federal prison on counts of conspiracy and wire fraud for his role in a $394 million Ponzi scheme that the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Securities and Exchange Commission busted last year. Merrill had already pleaded guilty, along with co-conspirators Jay Ledford, 55, and Cameron Jezierski, 28.\n\nFrom 2013 through last year the three had run an elaborate scheme in which they allegedly raised money from outside investors purportedly to profit from investing in consumer debt portfolios, authorities said. In reality they were paying older investors with new investors\u2019 money, while diverting $73 million into their own pockets, prosecutors said.\n\nFederal investigators said Kevin Merrill amassed $39 million, six real-estate properties, 25 cars, a boat, a shared interest in a plane, jewelry and an insurance policy. When he was arrested in Maryland last year he allegedly had $520,000 in cash in his safe, authorities said.\n\nInvestigators froze all his assets, but his wife Amanda allegedly moved quickly to cash out the American Express points and to take cash and personal belongings from the couple\u2019s home in Florida, including cash from the safe, investigators said. She was recorded getting instructions over the prison phone from her husband on how to open the safe, according to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\n\nNeither Amanda nor Kevin Merrill\u2019s attorneys could immediately be reached for comment on the case. American Express declined to comment on the credit-card points.\n\n\u201cWhen the district court enters an order in a case, we expect the affected persons to abide by the order, not conspire to remove and hide assets,\u201d Hur added.", "description": "She was charged with trying to redeem the points for gift cards at Starbucks, Sephora and Home Depot.", "authors": ["Brett Arends"], "top_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-HT184_arends_ZG_20191011165304.jpg", "published_at": "2019-10-22"}
