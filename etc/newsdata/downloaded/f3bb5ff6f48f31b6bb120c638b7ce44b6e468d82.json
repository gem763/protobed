Superior Court Judge Anne-Christine Massullo told the jury that details likely will be made public during approval hearings in February or March.\n\nThere were audible cheers from the jury following the announcement that the trial, which was expected to last for three months, would not continue.\n\nSutter, which is based in Sacramento, Calif., stood accused of violating California's antitrust laws by using its market power to illegally drive up prices.\n\nHealth care costs in Northern California, where Sutter is dominant, are 20% to 30% higher than in Southern California, even after adjusting for cost of living, according to a 2018 study from the Nicholas C. Petris Center at the University of California, Berkeley, that was cited in the complaint.\n\nThe case was a massive undertaking, representing years of work and millions of pages of documents, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said before the trial. Sutter was expected to face damages of up to $2.7 billion.\n\nSutter Health consistently denied the allegations and argued that it used its market power to improve care for patients and expand access to people in rural areas. The chain of health care facilities had $13 billion in operating revenue in 2018.\n\nThe case was expected to have nationwide implications on how hospital systems negotiate prices with insurers. It is not yet clear what effect, if any, a settlement agreement would have on Sutter's tactics or those of other large systems.\n\nKaiser Health News is a nonprofit, editorially independent program of the Kaiser Family Foundation.
